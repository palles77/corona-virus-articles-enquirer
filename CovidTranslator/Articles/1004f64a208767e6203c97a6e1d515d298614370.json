Deletion of the A35 gene resulted in increased virus-specific immunoglobulin production, class switching to IgG isotypes, and virus-specific IFN\u03b3 secreting splenocytes. The MVA35 deletion virus provided excellent protective efficacy against virulent virus challenge. These results suggest that A35 deletion mutant strains will have superior vaccine performance for poxvirus vaccines as well as platform vaccines for other infectious diseases and cancer.",

The most dangerous emerging poxvirus is monkeypox, which is a zoonotic poxvirus that causes a smallpox-like illness and has a 10% fatality rate in humans. There is growing concern as Monkeypox incidence has increased 20 fold since the 1980's [11] . Monkeypox is endemic to Africa, but in 2003 there was an outbreak in the United States that was associated with the importation of African rodents [12, 13] . This outbreak resulted in more than 80 cases, but because this was an attenuated strain, no deaths occurred [13, 14] . In addition to the threat of emerging poxvirus infections, there is also concern that the smallpox virus could be used as a biowarfare agent, resulting in widespread sickness and mortality in a now largely unvaccinated population. Thus, safer poxvirus vaccines are needed in the face of emerging disease and bioterrorism.",

Attenuation of this virus occurred after >570 serial passages in chicken embryo fibroblasts (CEF), resulting in deletion of approximately 25 kb of the VACV genome [15] , including genes encoding immunomodulatory proteins [16] , and the inability to replicate in most mammalian cells [16] . MVA is being tested as a vaccine to protect against poxviruses [17] [18] [19] , and is also being used as a platform vaccine for other infectious diseases and cancer [20] [21] [22] . Poxviruses make good platform vaccines because they are stable and easy to produce, induce robust, durable cellular and humoral immune responses, and can accommodate the insertion of large pieces of foreign DNA [23] . MVA has been shown to be safe when administered to immunodeficient mice [24] , non-human primates [25] and humans [26, 27] . Recent vaccine trials have shown that MVA can be given safely to those infected with HIV [28] and those with atopic dermatitis [29] , two populations that cannot receive the traditional vaccine. Thus, this attenuated VACV shows promise as a safer alternative poxvirus vaccine and also as a platform vaccine.",

The immunogenicity of MVA may especially be a concern in populations with an already weakened immune system, such as cancer patients. Data available suggest that multiple doses of MVA may need to be administered in order to achieve the level of immunogenicity obtained with traditional replication-competent strains [31] . One strategy that can be used to enhance the immunogenicity of MVA is to identify and exclude genes that are immunosuppressive.

It is an important virulence factor in the mouse model, increasing virulence of the Western Reserve (WR) virus by nearly 1000-fold, but A35 is not required for replication of the virus [32, 33] . In addition, we have shown that A35 in WR suppresses in vitro MHC class II-restricted antigen presentation [34] , and, following intranasal (i.n.) infection in mice, the protein mediates immunosuppression, significantly decreasing virus-specific antibody production, IFN\u03b3-secreting T cells, and CTL killing, resulting in the inability to control viral replication in target organs and thus contributing to morbidity and mortality of the host [33] . It was unknown whether A35 would have similar effects in MVA, or if some genes missing from MVA would be required for A35 functionality in MVA. Here, we characterize the A35 gene function in the background of the MVA genome and describe its immunosuppressive effects.",

[33] . We next wished to determine if removal of A35 from an attenuated vaccine strain would affect replication or increase immunogenicity. To determine the role of A35 during infection with attenuated poxvirus strain MVA, a mutant virus missing the A35 gene was constructed. Similar to our previous A35 deletion mutant in the WR strain (designated A35\u0394) [32] , a PCR product containing the E. coli gpt gene with A35 flanking regions on either side was transfected into MVA-infected cells, and recombinant viruses were selected and purified. To confirm that A35 had been successfully knocked out of MVA, PCR analysis was performed using primers in the flanking regions. As shown in Fig 1a, PCR amplification of the parent MVA virus yielded a product of 1.5 kbp, and PCR analysis of two independently isolated MVA35\u0394 (MVA35\u0394-1 and \u22122) mutants resulted in an approximately 400 bp larger product when compared to the product from parental MVA. This is the expected size increase as a result of the insertion of the gpt-containing PCR fragment [32] . There was no wild type A35 detected in the mutants suggesting that the A35 gene had been successfully removed and indicating that the mutants were purified from MVA parental virus. To further confirm the absence of A35 from the recombinant viruses, a Western blot was performed to analyze reactivity with rabbit anti-A35 polyclonal sera [32] using lysates from MVA and MVA35\u0394 infected cells (Fig 1b) . A protein band of about 23 kDa (the approximate size of A35 [32] ) was recognized in the lysates from the WR and MVA-infected cells, and this protein band was absent in the WR-A35\u0394, MVA35\u0394-1, and MVA35\u0394-2 infected cells. Together, these data indicated that A35 was successfully knocked out of MVA in these two independently derived mutants.",

Since MVA is missing ~ 25 kb of the genome of WR, we assessed whether A35 might be required for MVA replication. The MVA35\u0394 virus formed normal, MVA-sized foci on BHK-21 cells (Fig 2a) , indicating that the loss of A35 had no apparent effect on normal viral replication and spread in these cells.",

At various times post infection, cells and media were collected and the amount of virus in each was determined by titration on BHK-21 cells. For virus produced in the cells, there was <2-fold difference between the amount of virus produced by MVA and MVA35\u0394 at all time points tested. Similarly, for virus in the supernatants, MVA35\u0394 showed no decrease in virus production. A one step growth curve was also used to compare the growth of MVA to MVA35\u0394 in primary CEF, and at no time point tested was A35 required for viral replication (Fig 2b) . Similar results were seen using both MVA35\u0394-1 and MVA35\u0394-2 viruses. Together, these data indicate that A35 is not required for the normal replication of MVA in BHK-21 cells and primary CEF and further our conclusion that A35 is not required for VACV replication or spread from cell to cell.",

Our previous data with WR indicated that removal of the A35 gene results in an increase in both cellular and humoral immunity [33] , so we hypothesized that its removal from MVA would boost its immunogenicity. In WR it was possible that A35 protein interacted with another viral protein required for its function, and since MVA has several large deletions, this interacting protein may have been deleted, rendering A35 nonfunctional. To begin to understand the effects of A35 in MVA on the immune response, we compared the production of anti-VACV specific Ig in the sera of mice infected with either MVA or one of the two MVA35\u0394 viruses (Fig 4) . Infected mice had significantly greater amounts of anti-VACV antibody than PBS treated control mice, indicating that the response seen was VACV-specific. Mice infected with MVA35\u0394 had significantly greater amounts of total VACV-specific serum Ig than those infected with MVA on days 7 and 10 post infection (pi), indicating that A35 is immunosuppressive in MVA. We also analyzed the production of IgG and its subclasses on days 7 and 10 pi (Fig  5) , as antibody isotype switching is important for antibody functions. By day 10, mice infected with MVA35\u0394 virus produced significantly more VACV-specific IgG, IgG 1 , and IgG 2a than those infected with MVA. There was no significant difference in IgM production on these days. Infection with either mutant MVA35\u0394 virus yielded similar results, and representative data are shown. These data indicate that A35 in MVA decreases VACVspecific antibody production and inhibits isotype switching to IgG and subclasses IgG1 and IgG2a.",

Mice were infected and on day six pi splenocytes were harvested and assayed for VACV specific IFN\u03b3 production.

Similar results were seen with both MVA35\u0394 viruses and when splenocytes were stimulated with VACV-infected P815 cells. No IFN\u03b3 was produced by splenocytes from PBS control mice or in any of the groups without addition of virus or infected P815 cells, thus demonstrating the specificity of the response. Since CD8+ T cells produce most of the IFN\u03b3 following a VACV infection [39] , we also measured the percentage of CD8+ T cells in the splenocytes of infected mice on days 7 and 10 pi (Fig 6b) .

To understand more about the mechanism of A35-mediated immunosuppression during infection with MVA, we performed flow cytometry to measure the percentage of cellular subsets within the spleens of MVA and MVA35\u0394-infected mice. On day 6 pi, there was little change in splenocyte populations (Fig 7) . There was a small but significant increase in the percentage of cells expressing CD11b and the Ly6 marker for granulocytes in the splenocytes of the MVA35\u0394-infected mice compared to MVA-infected mice (Fig 7a) . The CD11b difference was maintained on day 8 pi (data not shown). Also, on day 8 pi, there was a small but significant increase in the percent of DX5+ natural killer (NK) cells found in the MVA35\u0394 group compared to the MVA group (data not shown). Since our in vitro data indicated that A35 in WR specifically affects the APC [34] , we also looked at APC subsets within the spleen, including B cells (B220+CD11c\u2212), macrophages (CD11b+CD11c\u2212), and dendritic cells (CD11b-CD11c+), and found that on day 6 pi, there was a small but significant increase in the percent of macrophages in the spleens of the MVA35\u0394-infected mice compared to those infected with MVA (Fig 7b) . There was no significant difference between the groups in the percentage of total MHC class II expressing cells (Fig 7a) . Thus, infection with MVA results in a small but significant increase in cells expressing CD8 (Fig  6b) , and A35 modestly reduces an infection-induced increase in the percentage of granulocytes and CD11b+ expressing cells in spleens (Fig 7) .",

Removal of A35 from the WR strain of VACV did not reduce vaccine efficacy [33] . Many studies have been performed to determine the protective antigenic epitopes of VACV [43, 44] , but only the most recent of these studies has shown that epitopes derived from A35 can bind certain MHC class I alleles [45] . We therefore tested whether the removal of A35 from MVA would decrease vaccine efficacy due to the loss of predicted protective epitopes or perhaps increase efficacy due to enhanced immune responses. Mice were vaccinated i.m. with 10 7 MVA, MVA35\u0394, or PBS as control, and four weeks later were challenged i.n. with 500 \u00d7 LD 50 virulent WR virus (Fig 8) . PBS control mice quickly lost weight, and all died by 4 days post challenge. All MVA or MVA35\u0394 vaccinated mice survived the challenge with no significant weight loss and no signs of illness. Similar data were obtained for MVA35\u0394-1 and MVA35\u0394-2 virus isolates. Together, these data support the hypothesis that an MVA-based vaccine that excludes the A35 gene will be more immunogenic than and at least as efficacious as the wild-type MVA vaccine.",

Since A35 is highly conserved in mammalian-tropic poxviruses, it is probably effective in many host mammals. In this manuscript, we provide a characterization of A35 in the attenuated VACV vaccine strain, MVA, and show that A35 inhibited adaptive immunity, including the generation of IFN\u03b3 secreting T cells and antibody production. These results are consistent to what we have observed for the A35 gene in the WR virus [33] . A35 was not required for replication in MVA in either BHK-21 cells or in CEF, the cells in which MVA was derived. This is fortuitous for vaccine production of MVA35\u0394 mutant viruses. During its >570 passages in CEFs, MVA lost many of the immunosuppressive genes found in VACV, including the secreted receptor homologs for IFN\u03b3, IFN\u03b1, IFN\u03b2, and TNF [16] . MVA did retain a few immunoevasion genes, including the IL-1\u03b2 receptor homolog [16] and A35 [32] . Since genes are lost through random mutation in the absence of selection, the retention of certain genes is probably simply random.",

Unfortunately, MVA fails to elicit the same high levels of B and T cell responses as the traditional replicating poxvirus vaccines [17, 24, 31] . We therefore removed A35 from MVA in hopes of increasing its immunogenicity. The results of this experiment could not be predicted however, because MVA might have lost some required viral A35-cofactor gene through its passages and large genome deletions. We show here that A35 does indeed function to suppress the specific immune response in the background of the MVA genome. Removal of A35 resulted in increased antibody production, isotype switching to IgG and its subclasses IgG1 and IgG2a, and IFN\u03b3 secreting T cells, suggesting that removal of A35 from poxvirus-based vaccines will enhance their immunogenicity. In WR, the improved immune response in the absence of A35 correlated with improved control of virus replication in target organs [33] , but since MVA does not replicate in mammalian tissues, we could not perform those experiments here. It was possible that removal of the A35 gene would diminish poxvirus vaccine efficacy if an anti-A35 immune response were protective. However, we showed that vaccination with MVA35\u0394 virus protects mice as well as wild type MVA from a virulent challenge.",

            "text": "Removal of A35 significantly increased virus-specific Ig, IgG, IgG 1 , and IgG 2a . The latter two IgG subclasses were specifically chosen since they can be used as a measure of the Th2 and Th1 immune responses, respectively [46] . A predominantly Th1 response is associated with smaller lesion size and decreased viral replication in mice and humans [47, 48] . Following VACV infection, persons with atopic dermatitis produce higher levels of cytokines and antibodies associated with the less protective Th2 response [49] , resulting in uncontrolled replication of virus in the skin. In addition, a recombinant VACV expressing IL-4 (a Th2 cytokine) was more virulent than wild-type virus [50] . However, we found no evidence that A35 was skewing the immune response towards the less protective Th2 response. Instead, A35 inhibited class switching to both IgG 1 and IgG 2a isotypes. These data are consistent with our in vitro data which indicate that A35 specifically inhibits the MHC class II:CD4 T cell interaction [34] , required for induction of isotype switching [39] . It has been reported that splenic DCs from VACV-infected mice were deficient in presenting a model antigen to specific CD4+ T cells [51] . Our data showed that the removal of the A35 gene in WR caused elevated antibody levels at least up to one month after vaccination [33] , suggesting that A35 deletion mutant viruses may give effective protection for longer time periods. Together these data support the removal of the A35 gene from poxvirus vaccine strains used for poxvirus vaccination or other infectious diseases and cancer.
