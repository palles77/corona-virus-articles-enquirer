During the metropolitan-wide quarantine, the National Health Commission and the China Centre for Disease Control urged the use of facial masks in all public spaces, put in place strict home containment policies, postponed schools and industry reopening to reduce communal activities and person-to-person transmission. A massive screening program was implemented for individuals in close contact with the infected or high-risk individuals 8-10 . The strict control in Wuhan has been effective, with the daily reported confirmed cases significantly reduced from 1500-2000 at its peak to 10 cases or less a day 11 . However, the implementation of the quarantine has also severely damaged its economy, with predictions that the Chinese economy will grow by less than 4% in the first quarter of 2020 12 . The daily life of Wuhan residents has also been seriously disrupted, and the long duration of home containment may result in mental and psychological issues 13, 14 .",

Since late February, major cities across China have gradually eased their restriction levels and partially resumed public transportation 15 . As the epicentre of the outbreak, Wuhan faces the dilemma of balancing the substantial accumulating economic losses with the hard-earned control of the epidemic. Lifting the quarantine restrictions in the city and reopening transport links with the rest of China has become the top priority for the policymakers. We aim to determine to what level of the two commonly used control measures, social distancing and facial mask usage, are necessary to prevent a resurgence of the epidemic due to either residual active cases in Wuhan or imported cases after lifting the quarantine.",

In contrast, lifting the quarantine on 18 th April allowed public person-to-person contact adjusted back to the pre-quarantine level with a substantially lower level of facial mask usage (75%). However, a low facial mask usage (<50%) combined with an increased public contact (>100%) would always lead a significant second outbreak in most quarantine lifting scenarios. Lifting the quarantine on 25 th April would ensure a smooth decline of the epidemics regardless of the combinations of public contact rates and facial mask usage.",

While our model predicts that public transmission accounts for the majority of transmission prior to the quarantine, household transmission is the dominant route of transmission during the quarantine. This is intuitively reasonable as the quarantine has significantly reduced the public contacts of the residents and increased their contacts with family members in a closed household environment. In cases where the epidemic is able to be contained without a second outbreak, the dominant route of transmission would switch back to the public transmission after lifting the quarantine ( Figure S4a ). In cases where the epidemic results in a second major outbreak (Figure 4b) , the second outbreak would be predominantly driven by household transmission. Our estimate that ~70% of all infected cases was due to household transmission is also in a broad park agreement with a recent report of WHO (78-85% 16 ). Further, we estimated 5% hospital-acquired infections in (patients, 1.1%; medical staff 3.8%), which is consistent with a recent clinical report 17 .",

If residents return to the same level of activities as the pre-quarantine very high level of facial mask usage rate of 85% (or other powerful interventions) will be required. Any additional public interactions, such as the influx of the five million returning residents to Wuhan, may trigger a second outbreak. Governments will need to determine how to minimise public contacts from workplaces, venues for essential daily commodities, residents, leisure, entertainment venues and public events although limiting or modifying the later may be important. Intercity travel should be minimised, and the return of the residents may need to be staged. The full restoration of the intercity public transportation may take months, and careful planning of the size of population inflow is necessary.",

Our predictions are based on an assumption of a homogenous population, and in reality, human behaviours and interactions are far heterogeneous and complex. Population-dense areas are prone to virus transmission and sporadic outbreaks. High-risk hotspots are needed to be identified ahead and subjected to further monitoring after quarantine lifting. The decision regarding the degree to which the quarantine is lifted requires a balanced consideration of the direct economic cost of the quarantine. Given the current Chinese per-capita GDP is US$10,099, every day of the quarantine of Wuhan, a city of the population of over 10 million, means a direct economic loss of US$280m. The degree to which it is lifted should balance the economic implications and likelihood of a second outbreak.
