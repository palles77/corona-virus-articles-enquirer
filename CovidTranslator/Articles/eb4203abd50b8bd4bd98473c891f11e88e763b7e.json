In this Review, we discuss the current mechanistic understanding of structures in 5\u2032 untranslated regions (UTRs) of eukaryotic mRNAs and the emerging methodologies used to explore them. These structures may regulate cap-dependent translation initiation through helicase-mediated remodelling of RNA structures and higher-order RNA interactions, as well as cap-independent translation initiation through internal ribosome entry sites (IRESs), mRNA modifications and other specialized translation pathways. We discuss known 5\u2032 UTR RNA structures and how new structure probing technologies coupled with prospective validation, particularly compensatory mutagenesis, are likely to identify classes of structured RNA elements that shape post-transcriptional control of gene expression and the development of multicellular organisms.",

Such intricate activities can be traced to the ability of RNA to fold into complex secondary structures and tertiary structures. In many cases, these RNA structures appear more dynamic than globular protein domains or the double-helical DNA structure. Primarily in bacteria and archaea but also in algae, fungi and plants, prominent examples of RNA structure-directed functions include ribozymes and metabolite-sensing riboswitches 3,4 . The roles of RNA structures in splicing and in gene regulation by non-coding RNAs may have been a driving force in the evolution of ancient eukaryotes 5,6 . Most strikingly, the peptidyl transferase centre of ribosomal RNA (rRNA) is a structured remnant of the RNA world that is central to protein synthesis in all living cells.",

These drugs block the dissociation of eIF4A from RNA and thereby reduce eIF4A recycling. Ribosome profiling of silvestroltreated human KOPT-K1 leukaemia cells revealed a decrease in the translation efficiency of mRNAs with long 5\u2032 UTRs 47 , including oncogenes, chromatin modifiers and transcription regulators, which may require tight control of their expression. Interestingly, many of these silvestrol-sensitive transcripts appear to encode a specific structural element in their 5\u2032 UTRs: 12-nucleotide long (CGG) 4 motifs that can fold into stable, energetically favourable RNA G-quadruplex (RG4) structures in vitro 47 (FIG. 2b) , discussed further below.

            "text": "We focus here on mRNA structures with functions in translation initiation, which is ultimately linked to the ribosome -the macromolecular complex that harbours this peptidyl transferase activity. The great number of protein and RNA components involved in ribosome initiation, scanning, elongation and recycling of mRNAs highlights that translationespecially translation initiation, which is one of the most crucial steps in translation 7,8 -is a highly regulated process (BOX 1) . Indeed, the ribosome itself, which for a long time was regarded as a constitutive, housekeeping molecular machine, has only recently been appreciated to be functionally heterogeneous with respect to its associated proteins 9, 10 . Translation regulation can also involve structures in the mRNA itself, which are rearranged and unfolded by the ribosome and by RNA remodellers such as RNA helicases. This complex and dynamic interplay of mRNA structures and the translation machinery raises an important question: how much regulatory potential is encoded in mRNA structures or in the structure-mediated sensing and recruitment of interacting factors such as RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) or trans-acting RNAs 11-13 ? One of the great challenges in answering this question has been to accurately find mRNA structures that modulate translation. Although mRNA primarily transmits genetic information from DNA to protein through its coding sequence (CDS), the 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 untranslated regions (UTRs) are non-coding and do not directly contribute to the protein sequence. Free from the constraints of encoding proteins, UTRs can form considerable Watson-Crick and non-canonical base pairing that can potentially impact every step of translation. Indeed, algorithms for modelling RNA secondary structure 14, 15 have suggested that UTRs have the potential to engage in intricate RNA base-pairing patterns, which may change in response to protein binding and may impact the recruitment of ribosomes. Although these algorithms have had difficulty in processing long RNA sequences and predicting long-range interactions or complex structures such as pseudoknots and still fail to account for protein interactions, the past decade has witnessed a burst of advances in integrating these methods with experimental RNA structure probing methodologies. Such integration raises the prospect of determining the complete ensembles of folding states of all transcribed RNAs in a given cell type at a given time and of understanding how these structural ensembles may give rise to intricate gene regulation programmes. Expected improvements of these methods would enable precise validation of functional mRNA structures inside cells.",

It is also important to mention that even within 5\u2032 UTRs, unstructured (linear) regulatory elements are likely to have a crucial impact on translation [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] . Linear elements include upstream open reading frames (uORFs) [22] [23] [24] and the sequences around the start codon of the main ORF. Such sequence elements have been dissected and discussed elsewhere 17, 21, 25 . As a classic example, a strong Kozak sequence 26 improves start codon recognition as a feature of highly translated mRNAs. Analysis of the relative strength of AUG codon recognition of all possible translation initiation sites has recently revealed specific responsible sequence motifs around start sites in mammals 27 .",

Instead, the cell may reversibly change its expression profile by adjusting the stability and translation of pre-existing mRNAs in the cytoplasm. For example, activated macrophages derepress the translation of 90 mRNAsmany of which encode anti-inflammatory regulators -within 1 hour of immune stimulation 29 .

Whereas the length of the 3\u2032 UTR immensely increased during eukaryotic evolution, the 5\u2032 UTR has maintained a median length of approximately 53-218 nucleotides 17, 19, 32, 33 .

As canonical translation initiation requires that the 43S pre-initiation complex scans the 5\u2032 UTR to reach the start codon (BOX 1), such overall high GC content in the 5\u2032 UTR has been thought to cause inefficient scanning and a lower rate of initiation. Indeed, in classic examples, the prediction of complex secondary structures in GC-rich 5\u2032 UTRs has been correlated with inhibition of translation 35 , for example, in the mRNA of the metabolic enzyme ornithine decarboxylase 36 . However, these secondary structure predictions and particularly their functional relevance in cells have not been established. Predictions typically calculate the most stable base pairing of an RNA as the one that has the overall lowest computed \u0394G. Although determining the \u0394G of an entire RNA structure in an mRNA takes into account the transition of an RNA domain from its fully folded to a completely linear form, scanning is thought to require only local melting of RNA structures rather than linearization of the whole 5\u2032 UTR. Indeed, emerging data indicate that strong local RNA structures and protein interactions may have important roles in impeding ribosome scanning 37 . Given the limitations of predicting global 5\u2032 UTR mRNA structures in guiding the discovery of RNA structures, the search for individual functional mRNA structures may be more promising. In the next sections, we take a closer look at interesting candidate 5\u2032 UTR RNA structure motifs that regulate mRNA translation and at the methods used to find and confirm them.",

Some mRNAs lack a 5\u2032 UTR completely, for example, all mRNA species in mammalian mitochondria are leaderless 38 , but they are generally rare in higher eukaryotes 19 . Some human mRNAs with an extremely short 5\u2032 UTR (12 nucleotides on average), known as translation initiator of short 5\u2032 UTR (TISU), undergo scanning-free initiation 39 . By contrast, some 5\u2032 UTRs are highly structured and can block entry of the ribosome. One of the first and best-studied examples is a small 5\u2032 UTR structural element -the iron responsive element (IRE) 40 which affects the translation of a subset of mRNAs that are important for iron homeostasis 41 . Briefly, a single conserved IRE stem-loop close to the cap of the mRNAs encoding either the iron storage protein ferritin or iron transporter ferroportin is bound by iron-regulatory protein 1 (IRP1) or IRP2 in low-iron conditions. IRP binding represses translation initiation by preventing the 43S pre-initiation complex from associating with the mRNA 42, 43 (FIG. 2b) . The IRE-IRP ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complex sterically blocks ribosome access to the cap and 5\u2032 UTR. Other stable RNA secondary structures such as capproximal hairpins 44 might block the assembly of the 43S pre-initiation complex onto the 5\u2032 UTR 35, 45 . The DEAD-box RNA helicase eukaryotic initiation factor 4A (eIF4A), as part of the eIF4F complex that is assembled at the cap, is thought to be crucial for unwinding such structures and therefore preparing a clear path for ribosome scanning 46 ",

            "text": "Recent studies suggest that the function of eIF4A in binding and unwinding RNA can have specific effects on target mRNAs, at least in part through structured RNA elements in 5\u2032 UTRs [47] [48] [49] . Although scanning is assisted by the ATPase-dependent duplex-unwinding activity of eIF4A 50 , these studies indicate that eIF4A activity is sensitive to both local RNA structures and sequence motifs. Unwinding of local structures may also explain why certain mRNAs that harbour long 5\u2032 UTRs and high GC content are still efficiently translated. For example, the 5\u2032 UTR of the LINE1 mRNA has a high GC content of 60% and is 900 nucleotides in length but is still translated in a cap-dependent manner at a rate similar to that of the very well translated \u03b2-actin mRNA 51 . studies 55 , RNA structures and the RNA helicase activity of eIF4A could be relevant for cancer research 47 . Consistent with this possibility, ribosome profiling in silvestrol-treated breast cancer cells revealed that translation initiation was reduced at hundreds of mRNAs, and sensitivity to eIF4A inhibition correlated with the complexity of the inferred structures and the increased length of their 5\u2032 UTRs 48 . However, only 25% of 5\u2032 UTRs of eIF4Asensitive mRNAs contain (CGG) 4 motifs 48 , so mRNAs with long 5\u2032 UTRs and structural features other than RG4s may be required for eIF4A sensitivity 56 . It remains to be determined how many of these 5\u2032 UTR motifs in fact fold into RG4 or other structures. Agreeing in part with the drug-based eIF4A inhibition studies, eIF4A knockdown in MCF7 breast cancer cells followed by polysome profiling and RNA-sequencing analysis revealed eIF4A-sensitive mRNAs that harboured 5\u2032 UTRs with a highly negative \u0394G and GC-rich motifs with potential to form RG4s, these measurements also uncovered U-rich and GA-rich sequence motifs 57 . Moreover, a more recent study using the eIF4A inhibitor rocaglamide A (RocA) found that 5\u2032 UTR structures, including RG4s, contribute little to translation repression 49 . Rather, by use of toeprinting and RNase I footprinting, RocA was suggested to clamp eIF4A onto polypurine motifs in the 5\u2032 UTRs of target mRNAs. Further increasing this effect of RocA is the possibility that eIF4A 'trapping' on certain mRNAs may sequester the helicase from being recycled to other mRNAs that require resolution of 5\u2032 UTR structures, including those with RG4 structures.",

A helicase that may have overlapping activity with eIF4A is the budding yeast helicase Ded1, which appears to be required to scan through long, structured 5\u2032 UTRs 58 . Other helicases with redundant function in translation, such as the DExH-box protein DHX29, can partially rescue the unwinding of structured 5\u2032 UTRs in the absence of eIF4A activity 59 . In addition, the eIF4A cofactor eIF4B has been found to stimulate translation of long mRNAs containing structured 5\u2032 UTRs in budding yeast independently of eIF4A, as demonstrated by ribosome profiling, which also correlates with 5\u2032 UTR structure accessibility assessed in vitro 60 . Finally, following the release of eIF4A upon recognition of the start site, the budding yeast DEAD-box helicase Dhh1 specifically promotes translation of mRNAs that have long and highly structured coding regions 61 .

For example, pseudoknots are complex intramolecular RNA structures consisting of at least two intercalated stem-loop structures that form a knotlike three-dimensional shape. A pseudo-knot structure conserved across mammals, along with contiguous helices, has been proposed to reside in the 5\u2032 UTR of human interferon gamma (IFNG) mRNA 82, 83 , on the basis of in vitro ribonuclease mapping, in-line probing and compensatory mutagenesis coupled with structure-function experiments (FIG. 2b) . This pseudo-knot signals to another member of the innate immunity pathway, protein kinase R (RNA-activated) (PKR), which is induced by interferon. PKR is typically activated by double-stranded RNAs of >33 bp in length, which do not appear naturally in the cell but are commonly generated by viruses during infection 84 . Normally, initiating ribosomes unfold the pseudoknot in the IFNG 5\u2032 UTR. The pseudoknot structure refolds as part of a larger, base-paired RNA structure of sufficient length to attract a PKR dimer. The interaction of PKR with the IFNG 5\u2032 UTR is thought to locally activate the kinase, which phosphorylates eIF2\u03b1 and results in repression of IFNG translation (FIG. 2b) . Thus, as part of a feedback loop, this RNA structure adjusts translation of its mRNA to PKR activity levels to prevent excess interferon synthesis 82, 83 .",

Indeed, pseudoknots constitute a well-known structural motif 87 in bacterial riboswitches and ribozymes and have roles in eukaryotic pre-mRNA processing such as in splicing 88, 89 and adenosine-to-inosine editing 90 . Furthermore, there are prominent examples of cis-regulatory pseudoknots in the CDS that interact directly with translating ribosomes to induce programmed frameshifting (reviewed in . Frameshifting pseudoknots can either lead to the production of different polypeptides, as first described in retroviruses [94] [95] [96] , or act as mRNA-destabilizing signals 92,97,98 embedded in coding regions that induce no-go decay or nonsense-mediated decay in eukaryotes. Thus, pseudoknots couple translation to trans-acting sensors such as PKR or regulate frameshifting and transcript decay in cis to fine-tune mRNA expression. Finally, as discussed next, higherorder structures, including tertiary structures such as pseudoknots, recur in 5\u2032 UTRs that control translation in a cap-independent rather than a cap-dependent manner.",

Viruses evolved IRESs to efficiently hijack the host translation machinery for replication and to overcome the cellular block of cap-dependent translation initiation upon viral infection. Many viral mRNAs rely solely on internal initiation of uncapped viral RNA by specific 5\u2032 UTR RNA sequence elements or secondary structures that directly recruit the ribosome for their translation (FIG. 2b) . Interestingly, alternative modes of internal but cap-dependent translation initiation are also well established in viruses and are suggested to occur in some eukaryotic mRNAs (Supplementary information S2 (box)).",

Indeed, most proposed cellular IRESs reside in mRNAs that rely on internal initiation for sustained translation in conditions of stress, mitosis or apoptosis, which reduce global cap-dependent translation (reviewed in REFS 100-105).

Only in the past 10 years or so have new experimental tools and controls been developed that stringently assess the activity of proposed cellular IRESs 110 . The importance of RNA structure for IRES activity has only been indicated for some cellular IRESs, and RNA structures have been chemically and enzymatically probed for only a handful of examples (Supplementary information S3 (table) ). Overall, cellular IRESs appear to be less structured than viral IRESs 111,112 , with few structural similarities to each other 113 , and their mechanisms of action are largely unknown. The activity of cellular IRESs can depend on rather short motifs 114 and on the assistance of translation initiation factors or RBPs that serve as IRES trans-acting factors (ITAFs; reviewed in REFS 112, 115, 116) (FIG. 2b) . Although several ITAFs are common to viral and cellular IRESs 112, 117 , only a few ITAFs are well characterized. IRES-ITAF interactions may contribute to stabilizing unstable IRES structures or to inducing a conformational change of the IRES RNA that enables the recruitment and correct positioning of the ribosome. We propose that cellular IRESs can largely be categorized into three groups based on which factors or mRNA elements interact with the IRES structure: assisting ITAFs that remodel IRES structures; uORFs that sequester ribosomes and affect IRES structures; or RG4 structures as part of IRES structures (FIG. 3) .",

Examples include the IRESs in the MYC 118 , apoptotic peptidase activating factor 1 (APAF1) 119 and BCL-2 associated athanogene 1 (BAG1) 120,121 mRNAs. The protooncogene MYC IRES is activated by genotoxic stress, viral infection or apoptosis. A point mutation found in the MYC IRES structure 122 in cell lines derived from individuals with multiple myeloma was predicted to lead to the formation of an additional stem-loop that increased both IRES activity 123 and binding of the ITAFs Y-box-binding protein and polypyrimidine tract-binding protein 1 (PTB) 118 . In the highly structured APAF1 IRES RNA, binding of NRAS upstream gene protein (UNR) to a purine-rich region in a stem-loop opens two stem-loop structures and allows neural PTB (NPTB) binding 119 , which generates a single-stranded site for 40S recruitment (FIG. 3a) . Similarly, poly(rC)-binding protein 1 (PCBP1) opens the structure of the BAG1 IRES, but ribosome recruitment requires the subsequent binding of PTB, for example upon heat stress 120, 121 . Thus, different IRESs require sequential or combinatorial binding by ITAFs to induce the structural changes that serve to recruit ribosome subunits in a cap-independent manner. At present, only a handful of ITAFs have been characterized. In the future the identification of additional RBPs that can either stabilize IRES structures or favour the internal recruitment of ribosomes will be an important area of investigation.",

In the CAT1 mRNA, structural remodelling of the 5\u2032 UTR in cis by uORF translation mediates unfolding of inhibitory 5\u2032 UTR structures and a switch to a translationally active state of the IRES structure upon amino acid starvation 124, 125, 128 (FIG. 3b) . In contrast to IRES activation by uORF translation, uORFs can also repress IRES activity, as seen in the VEGFA 127 and FGF9 (REF. 126 ) mRNAs. In a VEGFA mRNA isoform, a uORF embedded in the IRES is translated in a cap-independent manner and this uORF suppresses IRES-mediated expression of the main ORF 127 , possibly by unfolding the IRES structure. In the FGF9 mRNA, translation of a uORF upstream of the IRES suppresses FGF9 protein synthesis in normal conditions, whereas hypoxia-induced inhibition of capdependent translation and a switch to IRES-dependent translation increases FGF9 protein levels 126 .",

A recent study identified and characterized conserved structured IRESs in the 5\u2032 UTRs of a subset of genes in the homeobox (HOX) gene family 133 , which encode key regulators of embryonic development and tissue patterning (FIG. 3d) . The HOX 5\u2032 UTRs repress their cap-dependent initiation in normal physiological conditions through the cooperation of RNA elements -an IRES and a newly described 5\u2032 proximal translation inhibitory element (TIE) 133 , which acts as a potent inhibitor of cap-dependent translation (FIG. 3c,d) . The TIE acts in a highly modular fashion, as its placement upstream of the well-initiated 5\u2032 UTR of the mRNA encoding \u03b2-globin suppresses cap-dependent translation of a reporter mRNA. Thus, translation initiation of the HOX mRNAs is enabled from IRESs in physiological conditions, as TIE motifs enable these mRNAs to bypass the cap-dependent pathway. This TIE-IRES coupling perhaps enables more intricate control of expression in time and space by ribosomes, as suggested by the finding that some HOX IRESs selectively require a specific ribosomal protein, RPL38, for their activity 133 (FIG. 3d) . For example, RPL38 expression is markedly enriched in specific regions of the embryo, such as developing somites (precursors of vertebral elements), and is required at these locations to control HOX gene expression at the post-transcriptional level through IRES elements within HOX 5\u2032 UTRs. Thereby, certain ribosomal proteins, such as RPL38 (REF. 133 ) and RPS25 (REF. 134 ), as well as the pseudouridylation modification of rRNA 135 , can specifically regulate IRES-dependent translation and highlight the specific contribution of the ribosome itself to gene expression 136 .",

These interactions were studied further in two mRNAs encoding the cell proliferation regulators c-Jun (also known as AP1) and B cell translocation gene 1 protein, which are subject to eIF3-mediated translation induction and repression, respectively. Characterization of the Jun 5\u2032 UTR led to the identification of a conserved hairpin that may serve to directly recruit eIF3 for translation activation. Although disruptive mutations in the hairpin abolish eIF3-dependent translation activation, it remains unknown whether the RNA structure is necessary for function, as compensatory mutations are required to demonstrate the relevance of the structure. Interestingly, a putative IRES in the Jun 5\u2032 UTR that directs internal translation in glioblastoma cells 146 has previously been mapped to the same region as the suggested eIF3-bound stem-loop. It remains unclear whether the putative stem-loop is part of this IRES or is required for IRES activity. Analysis of additional eIF3 target mRNAs is necessary to determine how widespread this alternative initiation pathway is and to what extent 5\u2032 UTR RNA structures are required for it. In this respect, a specific eIF3 subunit, eIF3d, was surprisingly found to directly bind to the 5\u2032 cap 147 (FIG. 2b) , a role previously thought to be exclusive to eIF4E. This non-canonical cap interaction may serve to regulate transcript-specific translation of certain eIF3-bound mRNAs such as Jun 147 . Overall, eIF3-specific translation represents an additional role for eIF3 in selective translation.",

Reversible RNA modifications have long been overlooked with respect to their impact on mRNA structure and translation (reviewed in REFS 148, 149) . The most prevalent internal chemical modification of RNA, N 6methyladenosine (m 6 A) 150 (FIG. 4a) , was recently shown to stimulate internal ribosome recruitment 151 (FIGS 2b,4b) . In vitro footprinting and translation assays showed that initiation complexes bind to m 6 A-containing 5\u2032 UTRs, which stimulates cap-independent translation through the direct interaction of m 6 A with eIF3 (REF. 151) (FIG. 4b) . This type of initiation requires scanning and a free 5\u2032 end but is independent of the 5\u2032 cap itself or cap-binding proteins. This mechanism may indicate that m 6 A in the 5\u2032 UTR can serve as an alternative to the cap and is selectively bound by eIF3 to stimulate initiation at sites termed 'm 6 A-induced ribosome engagement sites' (REF. 151 ). This effect of 5\u2032 UTR m 6 A on translation becomes especially important in stress conditions, such as heat shock 152 , which selectively increases and redistributes m 6 A in 5\u2032 UTRs, especially in those of newly transcribed mRNAs (FIG. 4b) . During heat stress, the m 6 A 'reader' YTH domain-containing family protein 2 (YTHDF2) localizes to the nucleus and promotes the maintenance of 5\u2032 UTR m 6 A levels by inhibiting binding of an m 6 A 'eraser', fat mass and obesity-associated protein (FTO) 152 . This process mediates selective cap-independent translation of stress response transcripts, such as those of the heat shock-induced heat shock protein 70 (HSP70; also known as HSPA) gene family, which are m 6 A-modified at a single site 152 . A single m 6 A in a 5\u2032 UTR is also sufficient to recruit eIF3, which by itself can attract the 43S preinitiation complex 151 . As m 6 A content increases in stress conditions, which also activate IRES-dependent translation of specific mRNAs, it would be interesting to determine to what extent m 6 A modifications in cellular IRESs are responsible for mediating cap-independent translation.",

Using nuclease probing, m 6 A was recently found to disrupt local RNA structures termed m 6 A switches (REF. 153 ) in mRNAs and lncRNAs [153] [154] [155] , thereby rendering previously paired RNA motifs less structured and thus accessible to 'indirect readers' (FIG. 4c) . The RNA duplex-destabilizing effect of m 6 A is supported by nuclear magnetic resonance and thermodynamic measurements in vitro 156 and by the correlation of in vivo click SHAPE (icSHAPE)determined local RNA structural changes at or near predicted m 6 A sites in the transcriptome 154 . It will be crucial to define to what extent the locally unfolded 5\u2032 UTR sequences around m 6 A modifications favour translation initiation by the scanning ribosome 154 . Furthermore, m 6 A readers integrate many cues from the 5\u2032 UTR 152 and 3\u2032 UTR 157-159 that have been associated with increased translation efficiency or mRNA decay (FIG. 4b) .

However, increased co-transcriptional methylation of A to m 6 A in mRNA coding regions during slow transcription 162 as well as disrupted tRNA selection by m 6 A in the CDS 163 was recently shown to result in decreased translation efficiency and elongation dynamics, respectively, of m 6 A-modified mRNAs (FIG. 4b) .",

Although the cell membrane is an obvious barrier to getting large RNA-modifying molecules into cells, cell-permeable chemicals such as dimethyl sulfate (DMS) and SHAPE reagents have proved successful for RNA structure probing inside living cells (FIG. 5a,b) , and they are now being applied to map the folding of the transcriptome in vivo (reviewed in (FIG. 5c) . Transcriptome-wide comparison of RNA structures in vivo and in vitro by DMS treatment followed by deep sequencing (DMS-seq) has revealed that in cells, mRNAs are generally less structured than they are in vitro 172 (Supplementary information S1 (box)). Analysis of living cells by icSHAPE has also shown that RNAs are less folded in vivo, although the extent of unfolding varies between RNA classes 154 , and RNA structural features in vivo may be used to distinguish between coding and regulatory RNAs. For example, the region just upstream of the start codon appears particularly less structured in cells 173 . Nevertheless, the structural interpretation of these data remains uncertain, as cellular mRNAs are covered with RBPs, RNA helicases and translating ribosomes that constantly remodel the mRNP and influence the RNA structure [172] [173] [174] .

Thus, an unstructured element embedded in an RNA structure may actually be the driving force of a structured motif. In the case of IRESs, this notion could provide an explanation for the discovery of short linear poly(U) motifs that harbour IRES activity 144 , for the finding that the ITAF PTB recognizes and binds to a polypyrimidine-rich motif, (CCU) n , in structured cellular IRESs 114 , or for the detection of an unstructured region that is important for the activity of the turnip crinkle virus IRES 190 , despite the fact that viral IRESs are thought to largely be structured.

We encourage the field to more routinely apply compensatory mutagenesis to evaluate the physiological relevance and functional contribution of candidate mRNA structures. As experimental methods continue to improve, a major goal for global structure probing is their application across diverse cell types and tissues in the context of development, cell differentiation, stress or disease. This approach is especially important as intricate modes of gene regulation such as translation may be highly cell-type specific. Emerging technologies that are highly complementary to in vivo structure probing include advances in cryo-electron microscopy 196 , which may soon reveal the intricate interactions of the ribosome and structured mRNA elements 197 , including cellular IRES elements. Moreover, cryo-electron tomography in situ 198 may soon provide threedimensional snapshots of translating ribosomes and their template mRNAs in native cells. These methods may also profit from machine learning algorithms and conventional biophysical modelling to more accurately predict and model structures in mRNA 5\u2032 UTRs 199 . We speculate that such advances will enable an mRNA-centric view of translation, in which one can visualize how the ribosome and RBPs change the accessibility of RNA structured domains to control translation in time and space. It has long been appreciated that the ribosome is a dynamic, multi-state machine that has originated from the ancient RNA world. Upcoming advances raise the promise of understanding whether mRNAs and their structures provide, on top of the ribosome, a new layer of gene regulation that allows the control of translation to meet the needs of modern eukaryotic biology.",

The length of 5\u2032 untranslated regions (UTRs) has increased in eukaryotes during evolution, with median lengths ranging between 53-218 nucleotides (nt). We compared RefSeqannotated 5\u2032 UTR lengths of reviewed and validated transcripts (n) between species for which at least 100 5\u2032 UTRs are annotated. For yeast, we used the 5\u2032 UTR lengths as annotated in REFS 34, 35 . The violin plots depict the distribution of 5\u2032 UTR lengths for 15 species sorted according to decreasing median 5\u2032 UTR length, including human (Homo sapiens), fruit fly (Drosophila melanogaster), thale cress (Arabidopsis thaliana), mouse (Mus musculus), maize (Zea mays), zebrafish (Danio rerio), rat (Rattus norvegicus), wasp (Nasonia vitripennis), western clawed frog (Xenopus tropicalis), cow (Bos taurus), wild boar (Sus scrofa), tomato (Solanum lycopersicum), chicken (Gallus gallus), dog (Canis lupus familiaris) and the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The data range for each species was trimmed to a maximum of the third quartile plus three times the interquartile range (Q3 + 3 \u00d7 IQR). Cellular structured internal ribosome entry sites (IRESs) use diverse modes to recruit ribosomes, and their activity is often induced following a change in cellular condition. a | Many IRESs rely on binding by RNA-binding proteins known as IRES trans-acting factors (ITAFs) for ribosome recruitment. Such RNA chaperones remodel the IRES structure and thereby prepare a landing platform for the ribosome. In the IRES of apoptotic peptidase activating factor 1 (APAF1) for example, binding of NRAS upstream gene protein (UNR) to a purine-rich region in a stem-loop opens two stem-loop structures and allows the binding of neural polypyrimidine tract binding protein (NPTB) 119 , which creates a ribosomeaccessible site for translation. b | Cellular IRESs can also use upstream open reading frames (uORFs) to regulate IRES activity. In the 5\u2032 untranslated region (UTR) of the arginine- lysine transporter amino acid transporter, cationic 1 (CAT1) mRNA, translation of a uORF within the IRES is induced upon amino acid stress. This stalls ribosomes in the uORF and causes a structural switch in the IRES to an active conformation, which enables the translation of the main ORF 124, 125 . In addition, the association of the ITAFs PTB and heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein L (hnRNPL) with the IRES increases and is required for translation during starvation 200 . c | Cellular IRESs can integrate signals in cis and trans to modulate internal ribosome recruitment. Whereas a translation inhibitory element (TIE) blocks cap-dependent initiation, uORF translation, ITAFs or RNA Gquadruplexes (RG4s) can all increase (green) IRES-mediated translation in a transcriptspecific manner; uORF translation can also inhibit (red) IRES activity. d | In a subset of homeobox a (Hoxa) mRNAs in the mouse embryo, an IRES recruits ribosomes in a tissuespecific manner 133 . Several of these Hoxa IRESs additionally depend on the ribosomal protein RPL38 (L38) for their activity and a TIE at the cap that blocks cap-dependent initiation.

The grey arrow indicates the site of 2\u2032-OH attack of the RNA by the probe. Different probes induce singlestrand-specific chemical labelling (star) or cleavage by enzymes or probes (blue Pac Man shape, single strand specific; orange Pac Man, double strand specific). b | RNA probing either labels RNA through a covalent reaction of a chemical probe with accessible nucleotides (top) or cleaves the RNA backbone with RNases (bottom). A pool of modified or cleaved RNAs is transcribed into cDNA by reverse transcription (RT), and modified or cleaved sites are identified by their effect on RT. c | A 5\u2032 untranslated region (UTR) ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complex that inhibits ribosome scanning reduces the accessibility of the mRNA for the probe in cells. In in vivo RNA structure probing, shown here for DMS treatment followed by deep sequencing (DMS-seq) and in vivo click SHAPE followed by deep sequencing (icSHAPE-seq), RNA structures areprobedincells bychemicalmodification. Data analysis of in vitro-probed and in vivo-probed RNA can indicate the presence of RNA structures as protein binding sites, owing to masked probe accessibility or to remodelling of the structure by protein interaction. Where a 5\u2032 UTR RNP complex inhibits the translation of an open reading frame (ORF), the accessibility of the probe to poorly translated coding sequences might increase in the absence of ribosomes. d | In multidimensional mutate and map chemical probing, a mutation (red) that eliminates base pairing exposes the mutated nucleotide and its partner nucleotide (orange) to chemical modification (pins). In mutatemap-rescue probing, a mutation is rescued from modification by a compensatory mutation of the partner nucleotide (green).

            "text": "The translation of most eukaryotic mRNAs is initiated by ribosome recruitment to the 5\u2032 cap, followed by ribosome scanning towards a start codon (see the figure) . Canonical cap-mediated initiation mainly occurs by recruitment of the 40S small ribosomal subunit and its associated eukaryotic initiation factors (eIFs) to the 5\u2032 end 7-methylguanosine (m 7 G) cap structure (reviewed in REFS 7, 8, 20) . The first step of initiation is the assembly of the trimeric eIF4F cap-binding complex at the 5\u2032 cap, wherein cap-binding protein eIF4E interacts with the scaffolding initiation factor eIF4G and the RNA helicase eIF4A. Poly(A) binding protein (PABP) on the 3\u2032 poly(A) tail interacts with eIF4G at the cap, thereby circularizing the mRNA. Through its interaction with eIF3, eIF4G recruits the 43S pre-initiation complex (step 1), which consists of eIF3, the 40S ribosomal subunit, the ternary complex of GTP-bound eIF2 and the initiator tRNA (eIF2-GTP-Met-tRNA i ), and eIF1, eIF1A and eIF5 (not shown). Once the 43S complex binds the mRNA near the cap, it travels ('scans') along the 5\u2032 untranslated region (UTR) in the 5\u2032 to 3\u2032 direction (step 2) in an ATP-dependent reaction, with partial hydrolysis of the eIF2bound GTP to GDP in the ternary complex, until it encounters a start codon (AUG). The RNA helicase eIF4A migrates with the 43S complex and unwinds inhibitory RNA secondary structures in the 5\u2032 UTR (a stem-loop structure is shown). Stable binding of the 43S complex at the start codon yields the formation of the 48S initiation complex (step 3) and triggers GTP hydrolysis and release of eIFs. Subsequently, the 60S large ribosomal subunit joins the 40S ribosomal subunit to form the elongation-competent 80S ribosome (step 4), which then proceeds to translation elongation (step 5). Starvation and other stress conditions inhibit the formation of the ternary complex through phosphorylation of eIF2\u03b1 and block eIF4F assembly by sequestering eIF4E, which is bound by E-binding protein (not shown), thereby suppressing cap-dependent translation initiation. 4B, eIF4B; ORF, open reading frame. 201 and are increased during stress 152 . According to its position in the mRNA, m 6 A is bound by readers that can induce cap-dependent translation or internal ribosome recruitment. In the 5\u2032 UTR, eukaryotic initiation factor 3 (eIF3) can directly bind m 6 A and facilitate internal translation initiation 151 . Stressresponsive 5\u2032 UTR N 6 -adenosine methylation, for example during heat shock, is preserved by YTH domain-containing family protein 2 (YTHDF2), which blocks binding of the eraser fat mass and obesity-associated protein (FTO), thereby promoting cap-independent translation initiation of stress response mRNAs 152 . m 6 A in the coding sequence (CDS) is linked to tRNA selection 163 , and at the 3\u2032 UTR it is linked to increased translation owing to Leppek ",
