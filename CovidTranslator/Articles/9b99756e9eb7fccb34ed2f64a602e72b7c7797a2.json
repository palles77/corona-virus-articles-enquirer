However, it has the potential to cause severe infection in young children and immunocompromised adults. Both SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV were shown to express proteins with the potential to evade early innate immune responses. However, the ability of HCoV-OC43 to antagonise the intracellular antiviral defences has not yet been investigated. The potential role of the HCoV-OC43 structural (M and N) and accessory proteins (ns2a and ns5a) in the alteration of antiviral gene expression was investigated in this study. HCoV-OC43M, N, ns2a and ns5a proteins were expressed in human embryonic kidney 293 (HEK-293) cells before challenge with Sendai virus. The Human Antiviral Response PCR array was used to profile the antiviral gene expression in HEK-293 cells. Over 30 genes were downregulated in the presence of one of the HCoV-OC43 proteins, e.g. genes representing mitogen-activated protein kinases, toll-like receptors, interferons, interleukins, and signaling transduction proteins. Our findings suggest that similarly to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, HCoV-OC43 has the ability to downregulate the transcription of genes critical for the activation of different antiviral signaling pathways. Further studies are needed to confirm the role of HCoV-OC43 structural and accessory proteins in antagonising antiviral gene expression.",

HCoV-OC43 belongs to subgroup A of the betacoronaviruses. These are positive-sense single-stranded RNA viruses with a large genome size at 30,780 bases [1] . The viral proteins that contribute to the structure of coronaviruses include the Membrane (M), Nucleocapsid (N), Envelope (E) and Spike (S) glycoprotein. Betacoronaviruses possess a unique protein on the surface alongside the S glycoprotein called Hemagglutinin esterase (HE). Each coronavirus possesses its own set of unique accessory proteins. The accessory proteins of HCoV-OC43 are called ns2a and ns5a [2] .",

In Vero E6 cells expressing SARS-CoV N protein, interleukin 6 (IL6) was activated through nuclear factor kappa B (NF-\u03baB) [12] . On the contrary, the M protein of SARS-CoV suppresses NF-\u03baB activity and contributes to the pathogenesis of the virus [13] . In addition, many proteins in SARS-CoV were 1 3 shown to have the ability to antagonise interferon (IFN) and counteract the innate immune response. The ORF3b and ORF6 accessory proteins have the potential to antagonise IFN by different mechanisms [14] . SARS-CoV M protein was recently shown to suppress IFN production [15] . The structural and accessory proteins M, ORF4a, ORF4b, and ORF5 of MERS-CoV were shown to be potent IFN antagonists [16, 17] . It is still unknown whether the evasion mechanisms described above have a certain role in the severity of SARS and MERS. It is noteworthy that several people infected with SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV do not develop severe symptoms [18] [19] [20] [21] .",

The PCR array monitored the transcriptional activity of different genes involved in the activation of antiviral and pro-inflammatory proteins following amplification of RNA transcripts by real-time RT-PCR. Total RNA from transfected and mock-transfected HEK-293 cells was extracted using an RNeasy\u00ae Kit (Qiagen TM ) with on-column DNase digestion according to the manufacturer's instructions. The RT 2 First Strand Kit (Qiagen TM ) was used for cDNA synthesis. The RT reaction was then added to RT 2 SYBR Green ROX qPCR Mastermix (Qiagen TM ), and the PCR was carried out in a 96-well plate (Qiagen TM ) on an ABI 7500 Fast Real-Time PCR system (Applied Biosystems TM ). Cycle threshold (C T ) values were exported to an Excel file to create a table of C T values. This table was then uploaded on to the Qiagen data analysis web portal (http://www.qiage n.com/geneg lobe). Quality control was performed as the array contains controls to monitor genomic DNA contamination (GDC), first strand synthesis (RTC) and real-time PCR efficiency (PPC). Samples were assigned to controls and test groups. C T values were normalised based on a manual selection of reference genes with glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) chosen as the housekeeping reference gene. Fold regulation comparisons were used to profile antiviral gene expression. Fold change/regulation was calculated using delta delta C T method (\u2206\u2206C T ) where \u2206C T is calculated between the gene of interest (GOI) and GAPDH, followed by \u2206\u2206C T calculations (\u2206C T (Test Group)-\u2206C T (Control Group)). Fold change is then calculated using 2^ (-\u2206\u2206C T ) formula. Thereafter, the data analysis web portal was used to provide the scatter plot, the volcano plot, the clustergram, and the heat map. The fold regulation threshold was \u2265 2 for upregulation and \u2264 -2 for downregulation.",

HCoV-OC43 ns5a accessory protein is known to be a viroporin involved in virion morphogenesis and pathogenesis [30] . In its absence, there is a reduction of virulence, inflammation and replication in infected mice [30] . Murine coronavirus accessory protein 5a is homologous to ns5a protein, and it has been found to antagonise IFN induction [31] . Our results showed that the expression of PRRs, IFNA1, IRF7, MYD88, and MAVS, all important for the induction of an antiviral response, was downregulated in the presence of HCoV-OC43 accessory proteins ns2a and ns5a. Moreover, the expression of interleukins, chemokines, FOS, JUN, IRFs, and IFNA1 was downregulated in the presence of ns5a protein. FOS and JUN are transcription factors involved in the induction of inflammatory cytokines [32, 33] . Altogether, our results suggest HCoV-OC43 ns2a and ns5a have the potential to induce a shift towards an anti-inflammatory response and blockage of the type I IFN pathway. However, in vivo studies are required to confirm the type of immune response HCoV-OC43 elicits during infection. In the absence of adequate immune responses, the virus will be able to replicate and spread freely.",

The function of the N protein is to ensure the replication and transcription of viral RNA while disrupting the cell cycle [37, 38] . Indeed, SARS-CoV N protein inhibits the progression of the cell cycle and activates the proinflammatory factor cyclooxygenase-2 [39] . Moreover, it was shown that SARS-CoV N protein inhibits IFN-\u03b2 expression [14] , while it activates IL-6 expression [13] .

TAK1 is a protein kinase known to be a critical mediator of the inflammatory response as it is activated by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and other TLR/NLR agonists, TNF-\u03b1 and IL-1 [41] . Binding of IL-1 and LPS to their receptors activates TAK1 through a common pathway whereby the kinases IRAK1 and IRAK4 recruit TRAF6. TNF-\u03b1 activates TAK1 via a similar mechanism, which is mediated by RIP1 and TRAF2. Activation of TRAF2 and TRAF6 leads to the generation of K63-linked polyubiquitin chains, which bind to the adaptor proteins TAB2 or TAB3. TAK1 is bound constitutively to the accessory protein TAB1 and to the homologs TAB2 or TAB3. Once activated, TAK1 transduces the signal to NF-\u03baB, c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), and p38 via phosphorylation of IKK, mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase 4/7 (MKK4/7), and MKK3/6, respectively. Ultimately, NF-\u03baB and other transcription factors downstream of p38 and JNK are activated, resulting in the transcription of genes important for inflammatory and immune responses. Interestingly, Protein kinase R (PKR) interacts with TRAF6, TAK1, and TAB2 as a scaffold protein to mediate TLR3-dependent NF-\u03baB and MAPK activation [42, 43] . The strong downregulation of TAK1 expression observed in our study could be due to: 1) the inhibition of TAK1 expression by direct interaction of HCoV-OC43 protein with TAK1 preventing binding of other mediators like TRAF2/6 or TAB2/3; 2) the upregulation of expression of negative regulators of TAK1 like PP2C or PP6 phosphatases, and deubiquitinases such as ubiquitin-specific peptidase 4 (USP4) [41] .",

Our study showed that all tested HCoV-OC43 proteins were able to downregulate the expression of IFNA1, suggesting resistance to IFN-\u03b1 induction. The interaction between HCoV-OC43 proteins and the host cell requires further investigation to understand the processes that could contribute to overall resistance to the antiviral state. Having all these HCoV-OC43 proteins with potential inhibitory effects expressed in close proximity in infected cells indicates a high replicative capacity of the virus.",

While SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV were shown to induce proinflammatory cytokines in vitro [44, 45] , HCoV-OC43 accessory and structural proteins have the potential to inhibit inflammatory response in HEK-293 cells. Further studies are in progress to confirm the role of HCoV-OC43 structural and accessory proteins in antagonising antiviral gene expression, and to elucidate the nature of the immune response and the level of inflammation seen during HCoV-OC43 infection.",
