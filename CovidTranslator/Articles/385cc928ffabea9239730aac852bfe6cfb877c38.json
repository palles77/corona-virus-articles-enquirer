For cDNA synthesis, we used custom oligo-dT primer with a barcode and adaptor-linker sequence (CCTACACGACGCTCTTCCGATCT-XXXXXXXX-T15). After first-strand synthesis, samples were pooled together based on Actb qPCR values and RNA-DNA hybrid was degraded with consecutive acid-alkali treatment. Then, a second sequencing linker (AGATCGGAAGAGCACACGTCTG) was ligated with T4 ligase (NEB) followed by SPRI clean-up. The mixture then was PCR enriched 12 cycles and SPRI purified to yield final strand-specific RNA-seq libraries. Libraries were sequenced using HiSeq 2500 (Illumina) using 50bpX25bp pair-end sequencing. Second mate was used for sample demultiplexing. Reads were aligned to the GRCm38.p2 assembly of mouse genome using STAR aligner. Additional options were \"--outFilterMultimapNmax 15 --outFilterMismatchNmax 6 --quantMode TranscriptomeSAM\". Aligned reads were quantified using quant3p script (github.com/ctlab/quant3p) to account for specifics of 3' sequencing: higher dependency on good 3' annotation and lower level of sequence specificity close to 3' end. RefSeq genome annotation was used. Using MACS2 peak caller around 70000 putative exons were identified (peaks in rnaseq alignment not overlapping with known exons). Around 6600 of them were assigned to a gene located within 5000 bp and added into annotation. For on average 1 million reads per sample that mapped to multiple genome positions there were only one exonic alignment. For these reads multimapper flags were removed for read counting purposes. Actual read counting were carried out by ht-seq with enriched genome annotation and alignment with fixed multimapper flags. DESeq2 was used for differential gene expression analysis which was used as ranked list in pre-ranked GSEA analysis to identify pathway enrichments. RNA-seq data were deposited to the European Nucleotide Archive under the accession number PRJEB10074.

Mice were infected with 1x10 6 PFU/mouse i.p. for 28 days. Isolated PECs were stimulated with 2 uM gp150 peptide (LSNNNPTTIMRPPVAQN) or 1 \u03bcg/ml ovalbumin (SIINFEKL) or a nonspecific peptide (Flu NP 366-374 ) for 5 h at 37\u00b0C in the presence of Brefeldin A (Biolegend, 420601) and Monensin (Biolegend, 420701). Thy1.1 + T cells (CD4 + TcrV\u03b212 + V\u03b111.1/11.2 + for gp150, CD8 + MHC I tetramer for Ova for OT-I) were stained for intracellular IFN-\u03b3 and analyzed on LSR Fortessa (BD Biosciences). Virus Reactivation from Splenocytes was Not Detected in Mice after 42 Days of Virus Infection, Related toFigure 1(A) All Atg f/f -LysMcre and wild-type littermates were infected with 1x10 6 PFU MHV68 intraperitoneally (i.p.) for 42 days to determine frequency of virus reactivation in splenocytes during latent infection using LDA analysis. Only the graph for Atg5 f/f -LysMcre mice is shown for representation. Data points indicate the percentage of wells that were positive for cytopathic effect (CPE) on a mouse embryonic fibroblast (MEF) monolayer at a given cell dilution.(B) The presence of preformed virions in latent cells were tested by disrupting PECs and splenocytes using 0.5 mm silica beads for 1 min, twice and subsequently plated in limiting dilutions similar to (A). All LDA experiments are N=3 or 4 with three to five mice pooled per experiment. Data are the mean +/-SEM and p-values were obtained by paired t-test over all dilutions. Only significant comparisons are indicated. ****p <0.Immune Cell Analysis in the Peritoneum of Latent Atg5 f/f -LysMcre Mice, Related toFigure 4",
