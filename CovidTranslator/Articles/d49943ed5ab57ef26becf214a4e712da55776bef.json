Originally developed to screen protein-protein interactions and enzyme activity [1] , these arrays have become standard tools for detecting disease specific antibody (Ab)-antigen interactions in various disease states [2, 3, 4, 5] . Other screening methods like SEREX (serological analysis of cDNA expression libraries) or 2-D PAGE require additional steps to identify the antigens and suffer from poor reproducibility [6] . This is not the case with protein microarrays as each spot is individually addressable and hundreds of arrays can be produced in the same lot resulting in high degree of uniformity. Most of these arrays are made by printing individually purified proteins or lysates onto glass slides that have been coated with nitrocellulose (FAST and PATH arrays) (Fig. 1) . Other surface chemistries are used and different spotting methods such as NAPPA (nucleic acid programmable protein arrays) have been demonstrated as well [7] . The resolution of these arrays is only limited by the feature size (\u223c100 \u03bcM diameter for spots on printed arrays) and the number of spots that can be printed on them.",

Traditionally there have been three categories of protein microarray: (1) functional arrays, (2) lysate arrays, and (3) capture arrays. Functional protein arrays are printed using full-length proteins or large domains of proteins that retain their native functional activity [1] . Lysate arrays contain gross cellular lysates rather than individually expressed and purified proteins. The last category of arrays, capture or antibody arrays, are printed with antibodies that are meant to bind and pull down targeted proteins in a sample that can then be detected using a specific secondary antibody much like an enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) [8] . Proteins that are used in preparation of functional arrays are often produced using a baculovirus system in insect cells (sf9 cells) and include an epitope tag, such as GST, to facilitate purification [2] . One drawback to using proteins expressed in such a system for evaluating human self antigen responses is that they may not display normal levels of posttranslational modifications. Thus, a serum response that is directed against modified residues may be overlooked [9, 2] .",

Roche is currently developing such an array that will tile the entire proteome at a resolution using overlapping peptides. The resolution is important for epitope mapping (complimentary determining regions of antibodies bind to epitopes of approximately six amino acids). While peptide arrays offer the highest density, there is the disadvantage that some binding interactions that require native protein conformation may not be observed [9, 2, 1] .",

            "text": "Cancer antigens have demonstrated incredible importance in the clinic for screening and as prognostic indicators [10, 11, 9, 12] . The experimental design for identifying novel antigens using protein arrays often involves probing the arrays with sera or other body fluids (e.g., synovial fluid, cerebrospinal fluid, or sputum) that contain Ig's that may recognize epitopes of antigens spotted or printed on the arrays. Typically, the arrays are incubated with an appropriate dilution of the Ig (empirically determined) from a diseased group as well as from an age/sex-matched healthy donor group. The arrays are then washed to remove unbound Ig and incubated again with a secondary detection antibody that has been conjugated to a fluorescent dye. Image data is then collected by scanning the arrays using a fluorescent scanner (Fig. 2) . Differences in antigen reactivity between the patient and control groups can then be determined. However, this oversimplifies the roles that data normalization and analysis play in these studies. Protein microarrays suffer from greater artifacts and increased background compared to nucleic acid microarrays and since many cancer antigens may show only subtle differences in reactivity it is necessary to normalize to account for artifacts that may obscure those antigens [2] . Effective statistical methods have been developed to smooth away regional artifacts and quantile normalization often is conducted prior to statistical comparison of the two groups [2, 13] . It is often desirable to screen a smaller cohort of patients using more costly high density arrays in order to identify candidate self antigens. These markers may then be validated by screening many more patients for reactivity using more focused assays, as this approach can be more costeffective and higher throughput. Histological methods such as immunohistochemical (IHC) staining are often employed to validate candidate cancer antigens identified in protein array screens [2] .",
