Although canine CV has been identified and characterized in southern China in recent years, its epidemiology in other regions of China and its precise molecular characteristics have not been examined. In this study, we examined 141 fecal specimens collected from domestic dogs with or without diarrhea in Heilongjiang province, Northeastern China, during 2014 to 2016. A total of 18 out of 141 samples were found to be positive for canine CV by real-time quantitative PCR. In the diarrhea samples, canine CV was detected in coinfections with canine parvovirus 2. More importantly, two different canine CV strains were detected in one sample. Five canine CV genomes were successfully amplified. Sequence analysis showed that there were two unique amino acid changes in the Rep protein (N39S in the K1 strain, and T71A in the XF16 strain). Phylogenetic analysis indicated that canine CV could be divided into four genotypes, and specific nucleotide mutations could be used for confirming the four genotypes. Moreover, recombination analysis revealed that a total of eight recombination events were found in five genomic sequences. Molecular evolution analysis showed that the canine CV has been under purifying selection. This study provides evidence that at least three genotypes of canine CV are co-circulating in China. Continuous epidemiological surveillance is therefore necessary to understand their importance for the evolution of canine CV.",

Circoviruses have two main inversely arranged ORFs encoding the replicase protein and capsid protein, respectively [2, 3] . Circoviruses have been identified in a number of birds and other animals as well as humans. While some circoviruses cause subclinical infections, others can cause serious diseases with a serious economic impact [4] , such as porcine circovirus 2 (PCV2), which affects pigs all over the world [5] . Circoviruses have been confirmed to be associated with vesicular and hemorrhagic and enteric diseases as well as low body weight, poor body condition, and feathering disorders in birds [6, 7] . An immunosuppressive effect has been observed in infections with PCV2, psittacine beak and feather disease virus, pigeon circovirus, and duck circovirus [8, 9] .",

            "text": "JQ821392). The canine CV 2 group consisted of most of the Chinese strains investigated as well as three strains that were detected in the year 2014, 13 strains from 2015 and 24 strains from 2017. The canine CV 3 group included six strains from China detected in the years 2014 and 2015. The other nine strains, including the USA UCD3-478 strain (KC241983), belonged to the canine CV 4 group, which included five strains from this study and three strains isolated from Guangxi Province, China, in 2015-2016. Some individual nucleotide sequence polymorphisms could be used for differentiating the four genotypes. The nucleotide substitutions specific to the genotype canine CV 2 were mainly localized at positions 525 (G to T), 579 (G to A), 1066 (A to G), 1219 (T to A), 1258 (A to G), 1281 (T to A), 1489 (G to T), 1509 (G to A), 1513 (G to A), 1558 (C to A), 1638 (A to T) and 1639 (T to C). The nucleotide variations at six positions 891 (C to T), 961 (T to A), 970 (G to A), 1021 (C to T), 1129 (A to G) and 1192 (A to T) were unique for the genotype canine CV 3. Finally, five positions, 1212 (T to G), 1213 (T to C), 1219 (T to C), 1372 (T to G) and 1435 (G to A) contained variations that were unique to the genotype canine CV 4.",
