N-terminal or C-terminal HA tags were introduced into each construct by PCR with gene-specific primers possessing the tag sequence. HA-tagged DUGV L(1-169) was subcloned from DUGV-L cDNA (Anne Bridgen, University of Ulster, unpublished data) into pCAGGS-MCSII. A bacteria expression plasmid to generate recombinant CCHFV OTU domain was made by subcloning L(1-169) cDNA into the pGEX6P-1 vector (Amersham, Little Chalfont, United Kingdom). To generate catalytically inactive variants of L(1-169), a single mutation of C 40 to A or a double mutation of C 40 and H 151 to A were generated in the pGEX-GST-L(1-169) or pCAGGS-HA-L(1-169) plasmids, respectively. To generate the CCHFV-L 1A single mutant, the C 40 to A mutation was generated in the pCAGGS#12 vector (see above), cleaved with DraIII and then a DraIII cleavage product derived from pGEMT-L was inserted into it. In all cases, mutagenesis was performed using the QuikChange XL Site-Directed Mutagenesis Kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA, USA). PRRSV-nsp2 cDNA was subcloned into the pCAGGS-MCSII vector. An N-terminal HA epitope tag was introduced by PCR. EAV nsp2N was synthesized by Top Gene Technologies (Montreal, QC, Canada) and subcloned into pFLAGCMV2. pCDNA3-nsp2/3-GFP was derived from Sindbis virus expression vector pSRE-nsp2+3GFP, a derivative of pSRE-nsp2+3His vector (Snijder et al., 2001) . In brief, using a smaller shuttle construct, the SmaI restriction site at the junction of the nsp3-and His-tag-coding sequences of pSRE-nsp2+3His was digested to insert the eGFP gene. The latter was derived from vector pEGFP-N1 (Clontech) from which it was cut using BamHI and XbaI, followed by filling of sticky ends. Using MluI and NotI, the nsp2/3-GFP sequence was transferred from pSRE-nsp2+3GFP to pCDNA3 (Invitrogen), where it was placed downstream of the CMV promoter. Compared to native nsp2-3, the expression construct carried an additional N-terminal Methionine and a G-1064\u2192P substitution at the C-terminal position of nsp3.",

To generate recombinant Sindbis viruses 169 and MT, CCHFV-L(1-169) and L(1-169)2A, along with N-terminal HA tags, were PCR-amplified and subcloned into the BstEII restriction site of the dstE12Q vector. The 169GG and MTGG constructs, expressing ISG15 and Flag-tagged L(1-169) or L(1-169)2A cDNAs were cloned into the BstEII restriction site of the dstE12Q vector by multiple steps. ISG15-IRES-L(1-169) and ISG15-IRES-L(1-169)2A were generated by cloning ISG15 into pMIG and replacing the GFP ORF in pMIG with either L(1-169) or L(1-169)2A. To facilitate cloning, the N-terminal HA tags of L(1-169) and L(1-169)2A were replaced with a N-terminal FLAG tag. L(1-169) or L(1-169)2A were PCR amplified with primers containing a 5' HindIII site and 3' BstEII and ClaI sites and subcloned into pFLAGCMV2. The resulting constructs were digested",
