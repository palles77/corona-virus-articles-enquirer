According to the vaccination protocol in Iran, all pilgrims had received meningococcal vaccination, but influenza vaccination is not mandatory and we do not have data about its vaccination in this group. However in a review by Gautret et al. no remarkable effect of influenza vaccination on the influenza infection of pilgrims was found.

These results were in accordance with previous studies which have performed among pilgrims of different countries. A cohort of 5235 pilgrims attending the 2013 Hajj showed the lack of MERS-CoV in nasal carriage [13] . In a study on 154 French Hajj pilgrims in 2012, in spite of high rate of respiratory infections, MERS-CoV was not detected [14] . These findings suggest that MERS-CoV in its current form has poor interhuman transmission and may not have the pandemic potential as seen in influenza A/H1N1 in 2009.

At the end of the year, during November and December 2013, A/ H3N2 viruses became predominant until February 2014, but in March and April 2014 influenza B viruses were dominated. In May 2014 besides influenza B, A/H1N1 had a rise and during June and July both influenza A/H1N1 and B viruses had similar circulation. The last month of the year 2014, showed similar circulation of three strains until May 2015, but in January 2015 A/H1N1and in March and April influenza B viruses were predominant strains with co-circulation of the other viruses. In October 2015, influenza A/H1N1 and A/H3N2 viruses had similar circulation but in November and December 2015, A/H1N1 became predominant strain. In January 2016, A/H1N1 was common with co-circulation of A/ H3N2 and B viruses. In February there was a decrease in A/H1N1 circulation with a slight increase in A/H3N2 and a sharp rise in B viruses. In March 2016 influenza B viruses were common but in April and October A/H3N2 and B viruses had similar circulation while in November and December 2016, A/H3N2 virus was predominant. Fig. 1 shows the prevalence of different influenza strains during the months of the years (2013-2016). In 2014 dual infections of influenza A/H1N1and B viruses were detected in three pilgrims returning from Karbala in May and one pilgrim arriving from Karbala in June. Four dual infections of influenza A/ H1N1 and B viruses were detected in June and July in non-pilgrim patients. During 2015 six dual infections of influenza A/H3N2 and B viruses were detected which two were in pilgrims returning from Umrah in February and Hajj in October and four were detected in February, March, June and October in non-pilgrim patients. Six dual infections of influenza A/H1N1 and B viruses were identified in general population in February, November and December 2015.
