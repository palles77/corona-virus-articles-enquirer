The chronic demyelinating lesion was not usually associated with perivascular cellular infiltrates, although acute demyelination was associated with infiltrating inflammatory cells.

The reproducibility of this model now allows a detailed study of virus, host and genetic factors affecting virus persistence and replication in oligodendrocytes, remyelination and recurrent demyelination. The aetiology and pathogenic mechanism(s) of injury in multiple sclerosis, the most common demyelinating disease of man, is unknown. A large body of epidemiological and experimental evidence suggests that this disorder is due to an autoimmune and/or viral disorder 13 \u2022 The availability of the ts8 model should help to further our understanding of the pathogenic mechanism and genetic control of virus-induced acute and recurrent demyelination.",
