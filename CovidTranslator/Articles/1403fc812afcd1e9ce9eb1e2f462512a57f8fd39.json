This study provides a comprehensive overview of gene families involved in chlorogenic acid and luteolin biosynthesis in L. japonica, as well as its substitutes Lonicera hypoglauca and Lonicera macranthoides. The gene sequence feature and gene expression patterns in various tissues and buds of the species were characterized. Bioinformatics analysis revealed that 14 chlorogenic acid and luteolin biosynthesis-related genes were identified from the L. japonica transcriptome assembly. Phylogenetic analyses suggested that the function of individual gene could be differentiation and induce active compound diversity. Their orthologous genes were also recognized in L. hypoglauca and L. macranthoides genomic datasets, except for LHCHS1 and LMC4H2. The expression patterns of these genes are different in the tissues of L. japonica, L. hypoglauca and L. macranthoides. Results also showed that CGAs were controlled in the first step of biosynthesis, whereas both steps controlled luteolin in the bud of L. japonica. The expression of LJFNS2 exhibited positive correlation with luteolin levels in L. japonica. This study provides significant information for understanding the functional diversity of gene families involved in chlorogenic acid and the luteolin biosynthesis, active compound diversity of L. japonica and its substitutes, and the different usages of the three species.",

            "text": "Chlorogenic acid is a major family of soluble plant phenolics (Clifford, 1999) commonly found in Asteraceae, Solanaceae, and Rubiaceae (Molgaard and Ravn, 1988) . L. japonica and its substitutes belong to the Caprifoliaceae family, which exhibits accumulation of CGAs in their flowers, stems, and leaves (Chen et al., 2010; Zhang et al., 2009) . Luteolin is a flavonoid commonly found in fruits and vegetables. This compound has anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and anti-cancer properties (Lim et al., 2012) . Both CGAs and luteolin-7-O-glucoside (L7G) are standard compounds used to evaluate the chemical quality of L. japonica. However, only chlorogenic acid is used to evaluate the chemical quality of L. hypoglauca, L. macranthoides, L. confusa, and L. fulvotomentosa (Chinese pharmacopoeia, 2010). The content of chlorogenic acid in buds of L. japonica is higher than in its leaves (Zhao et al., 2010) , whereas in L. hypoglauca, buds have lower CGAs than leaves (Deng, 2007) . Generally, the biosynthesis of CGAs and luteolin is controlled by the phenylpropanoid pathway and can be divided into two stages (Fig. 1 ). The first stage leads to the synthesis of the universal precursor, p-Coumaroyl-CoA, under the catalysis of phenylalanine amononiar-lyase (PAL), 4-coumarate CoA ligase (4CL), and cinnamate 4-hydroxylase (C4H). In the second stage, luteolin is synthesized under the catalysis of chalcone synthase (CHS), chalcone isomerase (CHI), flavone synthase (FNS), and a P450 modifying enzyme. CGA is synthesized under the catalysis of hydroxycinnamoyl-CoA quinate hydroxycinnamoyl transferase (HQT). Bai et al. (2010) isolated a LJHQT gene and showed that the tissue distribution of HQT is correlated with the pattern of CGA abundance. Yuan et al. (2012) completed L. japonica transcriptome and obtained genes in the biosynthetic pathway of CGA and luteolin.",

Two C4H (LJC4H1 and LJC4H2) and two 4CL (LJ4CL1 and LJ4CL2) exist in L. japonica. C4H is a P450dependent monooxygenase cytochrome that catalyzes the conversion of cinnamate into 4-coumarate (also known as p-coumarate; Fig. 1 ) (Lu et al., 2006) . LJC4H1 and LJC4H2 showed 53.95% and 60.40% identity at the nucleotide and amino acid levels. They included the consensus Cytochrome P450 domain (IPR001128), suggesting that LJC4Hs have the same type of biochemical activity. The importance of 4CL genes and the proteins they encode is especially evident when one considers the role of the activated thioester p-coumaroyl CoA in plant secondary metabolism. In higher plants, p-coumaroyl CoA represents the starting point for the biosynthesis of not only phenylpropanoid compounds, but a wide variety of other secondary metabolites as well (Vogt, 2010) . LJ4CL1 and LJ4CL2 show 18.92% identity at the nucleotide level and 30.30% at the amino acid level.

The buds are used as Jin-Yin-Hua or Shan-Yin-Hua medicine, whereas the stems and leaves are used as Ren-Dong-Teng medicine. Previous studies have indicated that the active compound content differs among the plant parts (Deng, 2007; Zhao et al., 2010) . This study confirmed that the chlorogenic acid and luteolin contents are significantly different between the buds and the leaves of L. japonica. Organ preferential expression of PAL, C4H, 4CL, CHS and CHI (Li et al., 2008; Rani et al., 2012; Roslan et al., 2012) is exhibited in the leaves, stem, and roots. PAL1, PAL2, and PAL4 are related to tissue-specific lignin synthesis in the leaves of A. thaliana (Olsen et al., 2008) . Few papers have reported on the gene expression patterns in flowers. In this study, genes expressed in buds and leaves of L. japonica were analyzed. However, in the first step of biosynthesis, only the transcripted levels of LJPAL1, LJC4H2, and LJ4CL2 were higher in the buds than that in the leaves. The total activity of C4Hs in the buds was lower than that in the leaves, and PAL and 4CL did not change significantly. In the last step, LJHQTs did not show significant organ preferential expression, suggesting that LJPAL1, LJC4H2, and LJ4CL2 are among the critical genes that regulate CGA content within the organs. The activities of these individual enzymes in L. japonica need to be further analyzed. LJCHS1, LJCHI2, LJFNS1, and LJFNS2 in the last step exhibited bud preferential expression, suggesting that LJPAL1, LJC4H2, LJ4CL2, LJCHS1, LJCHI2, LJFNS1, and LJFNS2 are among the critical genes regulating the luteolin content of the organs. Therefore, only the first step of biosynthesis controls the CGAs, whereas the two steps control the luteolin content in the bud of L. japonica.",

Based on the phylogenetic analysis, PAL, 4CL, CHS, and CHI paralogs were used to predict functional diversity. HQT paralogs could be the same function. According to the results of gene expression analysis, only HQT orthologs and paralogs have a similarly expressed pattern in different tissues among different species. This finding suggests that the complexity of orthologs and paralogs in the first step of CGA biosynthesis and the two steps in luteolin biosynthesis could induce functional diversity and chemical compound difference.",

Twelve genes in L. japonica and all the genes in L. hypoglauca and L. macranthoides were reported for the first time in this work. Results revealed that in biosynthesis, only the first step controls the CGAs, whereas both steps control luteolin in the bud of L. japonica. The expression of LJFNS2 exhibits positive correlation with luteolin levels in L. japonica. In addition, the higher activity of LHPAL may be related to the higher content of active compounds in the leaves of L. hypoglauca. The different usages of the three species of L. japonica and their substitutes were comprehensively studied according to expression diversity of orthologs and paralogs in metabolic pathways.",
