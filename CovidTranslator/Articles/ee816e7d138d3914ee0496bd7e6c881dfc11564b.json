Healthy, full-term infants were enrolled at birth and followed until 5 years of age. Children with co-morbid conditions other than mild asthma were excluded. Pediatricians trained in infectious diseases and nurse practitioners conducted all sick and well-child visits. History and physical examination findings were recorded on a standardized clinical form. Investigators were instructed to collect a nasal wash if a child presented with fever >38.3\u00b0C, acute otitis media, or LRI (defined below). Specimens were kept on ice and processed immediately for viral cultures with an aliquot snap-frozen and stored at -70\u00b0C. All samples were cultured for viral respiratory pathogens on human neonatal kidney, HEp-2, rhesus monkey kidney, human embryonic lung cell lines and Madin-Darby canine kidney cells (during influenza season).",

This proportion was then extrapolated to all episodes of URI and LRI without an identified etiology (including those with and without available specimens for testing) to determine the overall number of LRI and URI episodes associated with HCoV ( Figure 1 , online only). Incidence was calculated by multiplying the number of LRI and URI episodes by the estimated proportion of LRI and URI episodes with detectable HCoV and then dividing by the total child-years of follow-up for the clinic population. Because some specimens were missing or depleted and some nasal wash specimens were never obtained for some episodes of LRI and URI, we examined the association between specimen availability and sex, race, age, follow-up time, examination year, and the presence of fever using multivariable logistic regression. To account for possible selection bias associated with specimen availability, we computed the proportion of LRI and URI with detectable HCoV weighted by the inverse of the probability of the specimen being available based on these covariates 17 . Details of these estimations including calculation of confidence intervals are found in the Appendix (online only).",

            "text": "Notably, half of the HCoV-infected children with LRI were diagnosed with acute otitis media while overall only 19% of children with LRI in the cohort were diagnosed with acute otitis media (p=0.03). Similarly, 51.2% of the children with HCoV-associated URI had acute otitis media. Thus, our data support previous reports that HCoV is associated with acute otitis media. 22 The detection rate of HCoV in healthy children has not been extensively studied and the samples obtained in our clinic during well visits are no longer available. One study done in atopic children found similar rates of detection of 229E and OC43 in children with respiratory illness (5.5%) and those who were asymptomatic (4.4%). 23 Recently Dare et al 24 tested specimens obtained from a group of healthy control patients for different human coronaviruses. HCoVs were not detected in the 34 well children less than one year of age and in only one of the 51 healthy children one to four years of age. Boivin et al, found HCoV-NL63 in 3.0% of children hospitalized for acute respiratory illness and 1.7% of asymptomatic children. Interestingly the mean age of symptomatic children was 10.1 months and 24.3 months for asymptomatic children (p=0.04). 25 These findings suggest that asymptomatic infection may be more common in older children. Additionally, co-detection of other viruses is also more common with the use of increasingly sensitive diagnostic tools. One recent study showed 27% of viral respiratory episodes were associated with the detection of more than one virus 26 . In that study, children with more than one virus detected were more likely to require hospitalization and were more likely to be <12 months of age.",

Vigorous statistical attempts were made to control for these missing samples. In addition, another HCoV strain, HCoV-HKU1, was discovered recently and was not included in this study due to further depletion of samples. Hence the overall incidence of HCoV determined in this analysis likely underestimates the true burden since it does not include HCoV-HKU1. Despite the fact that HCoV strains were associated with 67 medically-attended URI visits/1000 child-years and a modest amount of LRI, it is still unclear if these viruses cause a significant enough burden of disease to warrant vaccine development. The exclusion of immunocompromised children or those with other chronic diseases likely underestimates the burden and severity of disease.",

A high proportion of HCoV infections are associated with acute otitis media.
