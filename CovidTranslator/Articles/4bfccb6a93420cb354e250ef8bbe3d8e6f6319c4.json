A cohort study of convalescent SARS-CoV patients (56 cases, from Beijing hospital of Armed Forces Police, China) revealed that the specific IgG Abs and NAbs were highly correlated 2 , peaking at month 4 after the onset of disease and decreasing gradually thereafter (Figure 1). Since titers decreased markedly after month 16, IgG Abs and NAbs remained detectable in all patients throughout 2 years follow-up, except for at the last visit (at month 24) in which 11\u00b78% samples turned to negative. Then Cao et al extended the follow-up time to 3 years, IgG Abs and NAbs were detectable in 74\u00b72% and 83\u00b79%, respectively, at month 36 3 . Another study (176 cases, Shanxi 7 designated SARS hospitals, China) showed a similar result, up to 11\u00b78% serum samples were IgG Abs positive at day 7 after the onset of symptom of SARS-CoV 4 . The positive rate increased gradually, reached 100% at day 90, and remained unchanged until day 200. About 93\u00b79% and 89\u00b76% of these patients, respectively, were detectable after 1 and 2 years. Notably, 3 years later, 50% of the convalescent patients still had SARS-CoV specific IgG Abs. The longest follow-up study (23 cases, Beijing, China) showed that only 8\u00b77% patients of recovered patients sustained low levels of specific IgG Ab to SARS-CoV 5 . These finds suggested that the immune responses of specific Abs were maintained in more than 90% of recovered SARS-CoV patients for 2 years. Since the SARS-CoV epidemic 17 years ago, specific IgG Abs to SARS-CoV may have been wanned in most surviving patients, which could not be sufficient to protect against challenge with SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, previous experimental SARS-CoV vaccines and neutralizing antibody could be a novel preventive and therapeutic option for COVID-19. Besides, not all (only 11\u00b78% at day 7 and reached 100% at day 90) patients acquire specific SARS-CoV Abs in the early period after recovery, which highlights the importance of the detection of Abs titers for convalescent COVID-19 patients. Otherwise, these patients with low titers of Abs may not efficient for the clearance of SARS-CoV-2. These experience from SARS-CoV are expected to have some implications for the treatment, management and surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 patients.
