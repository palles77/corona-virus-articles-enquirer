Therefore, the RdRP is often described as a low-fidelity enzyme. However, until recently, a complete description of the kinetic, thermodynamic and structural basis for the nucleotide incorporation fidelity of the RdRP has not been available. In this article, we review the following: (i) the steps employed by the RdRP to incorporate a correct nucleotide; (ii) the steps that are employed by the RdRP for nucleotide selection; (iii) the structure-based hypothesis for nucleotide selection; (iv) the impact of sites remote from the active site on polymerase fidelity. Given the recent observation that RNA viruses exist on the threshold of error catastrophe, the studies reviewed herein suggest novel strategies to perturb RdRP fidelity that may lead ultimately to the development of antiviral agents to treat RNA virus infection.",

Unfortunately, mutations that produce replicationincompetent or perhaps translation-incompetent genomes are not scored in these assays.

As the number of mutations in the viral genomes increases and passes this error threshold, the fitness decreases significantly, ultimately resulting in extinction. Therefore, agents that increase the mutation frequency of the virus should be effective antivirals. This prediction was confirmed by studies of ribavirin that showed that the mechanism of action of this antiviral agent is lethal mutagenesis (Crotty et al., 2001 . Given the importance of incorporation fidelity for the viability of RNA viruses and the potential to exploit smallmolecule modulators of incorporation fidelity as antiviral agents, a precise description of the molecular basis for incorporation is warranted. In this article, we review the kinetic and thermodynamic analysis of correct and incorrect nucleotide incorporation catalyzed by the RdRP from poliovirus (3D pol ) highlighting the steps that are essential for nucleotide substrate selection. In addition, we review the structure-based hypothesis for 3D pol fidelity that likely extends to all animal virus RdRPs.",

Both 3 -hydroxyls of the substrate are competent for templated extension resulting in a symmetrical substrate, termed sym/sub ( Fig. 1) . The enzyme binds productively to sym/sub regardless of the orientation of binding and regardless of which of the two 3 -hydroxyls is in the catalytic center. The 4nucleotide template permits either single or multiple rounds of nucleotide incorporation to be evaluated by selecting the appropriate nucleotide or nucleotides employed in the reaction. 3D pol -sym/sub complexes recapitulate a biologically relevant elongation complex (Gohara et al., 2000) ; therefore, analysis of the mechanism of nucleotide incorporation in vitro using this substrate is likely to be relevant to the reaction in vivo.",

Chemistry occurs, forming a ternary product complex ( * ER n+1 PP i ); this complex isomerizes to form a ternary product complex (ER n+1 PP i ) from which PP i can dissociate. After dissociation of PP i , a 3D pol -sym/sub product complex (ER n+1 ) remains that is competent for the next cycle of nucleotide incorporation. For poliovirus 3D pol , two steps in the mechanism are partially rate-limiting for correct nucleotide incorporation: the conformational-change step (step 2) prior to phosphoryl transfer and the phosphoryl-transfer step (step 3) (Arnold and Cameron, 2004b) . The kinetic and thermodynamic analysis of correct nucleotide incorporation described above has been interpreted by using the structural model for the 3D pol -sym/sub-ATP complex illustrated in Fig. 2 . Binding of the incoming nucleotide in complex with divalent cation to the 3D pol -primer/template complex is driven by the metalcomplexed triphosphate moiety of the nucleotide ( Fig. 2A) . Once bound, a conformational change occurs to bring the metal-complexed triphosphate moiety into the appropriate position to interact with the conserved aspartyl groups of the enzyme, and at the same time, organizes the active site for acceptance of the second metal ion required for catalysis ( Fig. 2B ). Finally, catalysis occurs (Fig. 2C ).",

            "text": "It has been well documented that substitution of Mn 2+ for Mg 2+ as the divalent cation cofactor in polymerase-catalyzed reactions decreases the stringency of substrate selection and incorporation fidelity (Arnold et al., 1999; Beckman et al., 1985; Goodman et al., 1983; Huang et al., 1997; Liu and Tsai, 2001; Tabor and Richardson, 1989) . However, the detailed mechanistic basis for the destructive effects of Mn 2+ was not completely understood until recently . By using Mn 2+ as the divalent cation cofactor, the ability to diminish the rate of phosphoryl transfer for incorrect nucleotides relative to correct nucleotides is lost completely, leaving only the conformational-change step for nucleotide selection (Scheme 2) . When Mn 2+ is employed as the divalent cation, the conformation of Scheme 2. Comparison of the conformational-change step and the phosphoryl-transfer step for 3D pol -catalyzed correct and incorrect nucleotide incorporation in the presence of Mg 2+ and Mn 2+ . ground-state binding of metal-complexed nucleotide; (B) reorientation of the triphosphate into the catalytically competent configuration; (C) phosphoryl transfer and pyrophosphate release. While the kinetic mechanism suggests a conformational change prior to pyrophosphate release, kinetic data do not provide any information to permit a molecular description of this step. Images were generated from the model previously described (Gohara et al., 2000) . Nucleotide and side chain motions were derived from (Johnson et al., 2003) by approximate rotation and translation movements. Atom colors correspond to the following: red, oxygen; blue, nitrogen; gray, carbon; magenta, Mg 2+ or Mn 2+ . The images were rendered with WebLab Viewer Pro (Accelrys Inc., San Diego, CA). Reproduced with permission from Biochemistry (2004), submitted. \u00a9 1998 Am. Chem. Soc. the metal-bound triphosphate coupled with the additional adventitious interactions that can occur between the enzyme and Mn 2+ increases the stability of the activated ternary complex (Scheme 2, step 2). Compared to reactions in the presence of Mg 2+ , the increase in stability of the activated ternary complex is the same regardless of the nature of the nucleotide (correct or incorrect). In addition, the capacity of Mn 2+ to bind more tightly to the \u2424 and \u2425 phosphates makes the ori- entation of the triphosphate independent of interactions with residues in the ribose-binding pocket. Consequently, perturbations in the orientation of the triphosphate will not occur in response to binding of a nucleotide with an incorrect base or sugar configuration. Therefore, the inability to couple the nature of the bound nucleotide to the efficiency of phosphoryl transfer is the primary reason for the observed loss of 3D pol fidelity in the presence of Mn 2+ .",

Restated, these two steps would be used by the enzyme to distinguish a correct nucleotide from an incorrect nucleotide. Through evaluation of the differences between correct and incorrect nucleotide incorporation catalyzed by 3D pol , it was found that there is no difference in ground-state binding (step 1) regardless of the nucleotide substrate employed (Table 2, Fig. 3) . Therefore, ground-state binding cannot contribute to the process of nucleotide substrate selection. The reason for this observation likely reflects the use of the triphosphate for ground-state binding instead of the ribose or base. However, the two steps in the kinetic mechanism for nucleotide incorporation catalyzed by 3D pol that provide the greatest contribution to fidelity are formation of the activated ternary complex (step 2) and phosphoryl transfer (step 3) (Schemes 1 and 2,  Fig. 3) .",

Six of these interact with the nucleotide substrate: Asp-233, Asp-238, Asp-328, Ser-288, Thr-293, and Asn-297 (Fig. 5A) . In order to determine the importance of these residues for nucleotide selection, 3D pol derivatives were created in which some of these residues were changed to alanine. The derivatives were subsequently purified and the mechanism of nucleotide selection determined by evaluating the kinetics of incorporation of correct and incorrect nucleotides (Gohara et al., 2000 . The results obtained from the studies of incorporation of correct and incorrect nucleotides with wild-type 3D pol and the 3D pol derivatives permitted the identification of essential amino acid residues and the interactions that are important for correct nucleotide selection. The model for nucleotide binding in Figs. 2 and 4 can be expanded to include these interactions. The first step is binding of the nucleotide in the ground state. In this ground-state configuration, the ribose cannot bind in a productive orientation because the interaction between Asp-238 and Asn-297 observed in the unliganded enzyme occludes the ribose-binding pocket (Gohara et al., 2000 . A conformational change occurs that orients the triphosphate for phosphoryl transfer. This transition is proposed to be partially rate-limiting for correct nucleotide incorporation (step 2 in Scheme 1) (Arnold and Cameron, 2004b; Arnold et al., 2004) . Moreover, the stability of the complex in this conformation will dictate the efficiency of phosphoryl transfer as any movement in the position of the triphosphate will produce either a suboptimal orientation or a suboptimal distance for catalysis. In order to maintain the triphosphate in the appropriate orientation, an extensive hydrogen-bonding network is involved that can be traced to residues in the ribose-binding pocket (Fig. 5B) . Formation of this network requires reorientation of Asp-238 and Asn-297 as well as interaction of the oxygen of the \u2424-phosphate with the 3 -OH of the nucleotide substrate. The position of the ribose is held firmly by interactions between the 3 -OH and the backbone of Asp-238 and by interactions between the 2 -OH and Asn-297. The backbone of Asp-238 is restricted by the interaction of the Asp-238 side chain with other residues in the pocket, perhaps Ser-288 and Thr-293 (Fig. 5B) . The appropriate organization of this complex will permit binding and/or alignment of the second divalent cation cofactor, permitting phosphoryl transfer, translocation and pyrophosphate release (Arnold and Cameron, 2004b; Arnold et al., 2004) .",

Stabilization of the triphosphate conformation requires conserved structural motif A (Fig. 6) . Stabilization of the triphosphate-metal complex in the active conformation requires of a network of hydrogen bonds provided mostly by the backbone of the residues in motif A (Fig. 6) . Therefore, any movement of the motif A side chains located in the sugarbinding pocket will be transmitted through the rest of motif A, consequently perturbing the position of both the sugar and Fig. 6 . A conserved mechanism for linking binding of a correct nucleotide to the efficiency of phosphoryl transfer. The nucleotide-binding pocket of all nucleic acid polymerases with a canonical \"palm\"-based active site is highly conserved. The site can be divided into two parts: a region that has \"universal\" interactions mediated by conserved structural motif A that organizes the metals and triphosphate for catalysis and a region that has \"adapted\" interactions mediated by conserved structural motif B that dictate whether ribo-or 2 -deoxribonucleotides will be utilized. In the classical polymerase, there is a motif A residue located in the sugar-binding pocket capable of interacting with motif B residue(s) involved in sugar selection. This motif A residue in other polymerases could represent the link between the nature of the bound nucleotide (correct vs. incorrect) to the efficiency of phosphoryl transfer as described herein for Asp-238 of 3D pol . Reproduced with permission from Biochemistry, 2004 , submitted. \u00a9 1998 triphosphate and reducing the efficiency of phosphoryl transfer as described above for Asp-238 of 3D pol . The position of residues in motif A can be altered both by either the base or the ribose of the nucleotide (Fig. 6 ). Similar to Asn-297 (motif B) for 3D pol , T7 RNA polymerase uses His-784 (motif B) for hydrogen bonding to the 2 -OH of the NTP substrate (Brieba and Sousa, 2000) . In HIV RT, Phe-160 (motif B) has van der Waals interactions with the 2 -H of the 2 -dNTP substrate (Gutierrez-Rivas et al., 1999) . In the presence of a 2 -OH, Phe-160 will cause movement of Tyr-115 (motif A). Likewise, the presence of a motif B residue in DNA polymerases (e.g. T7, BF, KF, Taq and RB69) will cause movement of motif A via the motif A residue located in the sugar-binding pocket (Beese et al., 1993; Cheetham and Steitz, 1999; Doublie et al., 1998; Johnson et al., 2003; Li et al., 1998; Yin and Steitz, 2002) .",

Nucleotide binding by G64S 3D pol is equivalent to wild-type 3D pol regardless of the nature of the nucleotide, correct or incorrect, consistent with the finding that binding is governed primarily by the triphosphate moiety (Table 3) . However, the overall efficiency of RMP and GMP incorporation was reduced significantly relative to wild-type 3D pol , suggesting a decrease in either the conformational-change step or the phosphoryl-transfer step ( Table 3 ). The fidelity of G64S 3D pol increased compared to wild-type enzyme, and the capacity of the G64S substitution to permit decreased utilization of RTP could be explained by increased fidelity of this derivative relative to wild-type 3D pol . The mechanistic basis for this increased fidelity is a change in the stability of the activated ternary complex compared to wild-type 3D pol (Arnold and Cameron, 2004a) .
