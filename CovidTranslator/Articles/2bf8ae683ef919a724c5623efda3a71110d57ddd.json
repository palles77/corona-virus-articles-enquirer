However, recently it was discovered that IFITs could directly recognize viral RNA bearing a 5\u2032-triphosphate group (PPP-RNA), which is a molecular signature that distinguishes it from host RNA. Here, we report crystal structures of human IFIT5, its complex with PPP-RNAs, and an N-terminal fragment of IFIT1. The structures reveal a new helical domain that houses a positively charged cavity designed to specifically engage only single stranded PPP-RNA, thus distinguishing it from the canonical cytosolic sensor of double stranded viral PPP-RNA, RIG-I. Mutational analysis, proteolysis and gel-shift assays reveal that PPP-RNA is bound in a nonsequence specific manner and requires approximately a 3-nucleotide 5\u2032-overhang. Abrogation of PPP-RNA binding in IFIT1 and IFIT5 were found to cause a defect in the anti-viral response by HEK cells. These results demonstrate the mechanism by which IFIT proteins selectively recognize viral RNA and lend insight into their downstream effector function.",

During viral infection, non-self molecules are derived from viral genomes generally in the form of double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) or 5\u2032-triphosphorylated RNA (PPP-RNA) that is not protected by a 5\u2032-cap. The canonical host proteins responsible for sensing or interacting with these foreign nucleic acids include the Toll-like receptors (TLRs), retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I)-like receptors (RLRs) and nucleotide oligomerization domain (NOD)-like receptors (NLRs) 1 . Recently, an unbiased proteomics approach discovered that the interferon-induced proteins with tetratricopeptide repeats (IFITs) could also directly engage PPP-RNA 2 .",

Most of these functions are thought to occur through disruptive protein-protein interactions between IFITs and host cellular factors. Through their TPRs, human IFIT1 and IFIT2 were shown to inhibit key steps during translation initiation by interacting with the 'e' or 'c' subunits of eIF3 5, 6 . However, the surprising finding that IFITs can bind RNA suggested a more direct role -following infection/interferon-stimulation, it was found that IFITs form large multi-protein complexes with other family members and several different RNA binding proteins, leading to viral clearance 2 . Like RIG-I, productive binding of both IFIT1 and IFIT5 were shown to depend on the presence of cytosolic PPP-RNAs 2,7,8 . However, crystallographic and biochemical analyses of RIG-I bound to RNA revealed that it is a dsRNA-specific translocase 9 , which optimally interacts with blunt ended PPP-RNA [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] .

In most multi-TPR-containing proteins such as O-linked GlcNAc transferase (OGT), the relationship between successive TPRs is regular and repeating such that they form open-ended superhelical structures with distinct convex and concave surfaces 4, 16 . In IFIT5, of its total 24 \u03b1-helices, 18 form canonical TPRs (TPRs 1-9; Fig. 1a ), while the remaining 6 helices intervene between the TPRs such that the regular repeating relationship between them is disrupted.

This is facilitated by a connecting 17-residue loop (L1) containing a highly conserved CHFTW pentapeptide motif that is invariant among the overwhelming majority of IFIT proteins ( Supplementary Fig. 2 ), and forms a single turn of a helix that packs against the concave inner face of Subdomain I ( Supplementary Fig. 4 ).

Subdomain II forms a canonical four-TPR repeat domain where strikingly, its first helix (\u03b17) interacts with Subdomain I in a manner reminiscent of TPR protein-ligand interactions observed previously 17 (Supplementary Fig. 4) . This leads to the concave surface of Subdomain II forming one wall of a large cavity in the centre of the protein closed off at its base by helix a2 (Fig. 1b) . The same TPR-ligand relationship between Subdomains I and II is maintained in the nIFIT1 structure as well ( Supplementary Fig. 3 ).",

All of the structures were similar, therefore we initially describe the general features of IFIT5-oligo-C complex since it was the highest resolution structure. Difference Fourier maps revealed strong positive electron density within the central positively charged pocket from which the 5\u2032-triphosphate and the first four nucleotides of the RNA could be reliably modelled ( Fig. 2a and Supplementary Fig. 10a ). The 5\u2032-triphosphate group is nestled deep within the pocket and makes a multitude of electrostatic interactions with protein side chains from helix \u03b12 (Glu33, Thr37 and Gln41) located at the very base of the pocket, and residues from the concave inner surface of Subdomain II (Lys150, Tyr250 and Arg253) (Fig. 2c) . Arg186, which in IFIT1 (Arg187) was previously identified to be required for RNA interaction, makes a weak salt-bridge with the \u03b1and \u03b2-phosphates and Van der Waal contacts with the first ribose moiety. These RNA interacting residues are for the most part conserved in sequence and structure between IFIT5 and IFIT1 ( Supplementary Figs. 2 and 7) , the only IFITs that have been shown to bind PPP-RNA with significant affinity 2 . One notable exception is Thr37, which is replaced in IFIT1 by Arg38, suggesting slight differences in RNA recognition between IFIT1 and IFIT5. Conversely in IFIT3, which is known to not bind PPP-RNA 2 , Tyr250 is substituted with a negatively charged residue -Asp242, and Arg186 with His182 ( Supplementary Fig. 2) , both of which would directly interfere with RNA binding.",

Based on ligand distances and geometry, the ion is likely Mg 2+ from the in vitro transcription reactions, but could potentially also be Na + (a component of the crystallization buffer). It is unlikely that capped mRNA can be accommodated within this pocket owing to size constraints. Additionally, given the critical interactions made with the \u03b3-phosphate and the metal ion, the pocket is unlikely to accept with significant affinity 5\u2032-monophosphorylated or 5\u2032-hydroxylated RNA.

Notably, the first two bases do not make any specific hydrogen bonds with protein residues and there is ample space adjacent to the pyrimidine ring edges, suggesting that the larger purine bases can also be easily accommodated (Fig. 3) . The structure of the oligo-A complex confirms this notion and reveals that the adenine rings reach further out into the periphery making additional nonspecific Van der Waals contacts with Thr371, His374 and Phe339, which were absent with the pyrimidine bases ( Fig. 3b-d) .",

SAXS analysis revealed significant reductions in the radius of gyration (R g , ~2.5 \u00c5), the maximum dimension (D max, ~25 \u00c5) and the volume (~14000 \u00c5 3 ) of the protein upon addition of RNA ( Fig. 4c and Supplementary Fig. 14) . The scattering curves show good agreement between solution (R g , 28.2 \u00c5) and crystal structure (R g , 27.5 \u00c5) for the RNA-bound form ( Supplementary Fig. 14h) , in contrast to the apo form, which displays significant differences (solution R g , 30.6 \u00c5; crystal structure R g , 28.3 \u00c5). This suggests that in solution, the apoprotein is either more open or possibly flexible. To discern between these possibilities, we subjected the SAXS data to a Porod-Debye analysis, which provides information on the degree of flexibility present in the scattering sample 19 . For both apo and RNA-bound IFIT5, the Porod-Debye plot showed characteristic plateaus that indicate the presence of distinct conformations for both species (Supplementary Fig. 14k,l) .

Consistent with the crystal structure, we found that IFIT5 could shift both PPP-ssRNA and PPP-dsRNA with at least 3-nucleotide overhangs, but could not efficiently shift blunt-ended PPP-RNA or PPP-dsRNA with 1-2 nucleotide overhangs ( Fig. 5a and Supplementary Fig.  16) .

As a negative control we used IFIT3, and it could not shift any species of RNA ( Fig. 5a and Supplementary Fig. 16b) .

Other RNA viruses, such as positive-sense (+) viruses which have 5\u2032-capped genomes, can also generate cytosolic PPP-RNAs as replicative intermediates during their lifecycle. Hence, the evolution of a binding site to specifically recognize PPP-RNA allows IFITs to distinguish self from non-self RNAs since cytosolic host ssRNAs bear a 5\u2032-monophosphate (on rRNA and tRNA) 20, 21 or are 5\u2032-capped (in the case of mRNA).
