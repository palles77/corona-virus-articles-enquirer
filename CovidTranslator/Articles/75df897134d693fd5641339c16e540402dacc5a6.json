Some fundamental advantages of viruses, compared to synthetically programmed materials, include the highly precise spatial arrangement of their subunits into a diverse array of shapes and sizes and many available avenues for easy and reproducible modification. Here, we will first survey the broad distribution of viruses and various methods for producing virus-based nanoparticles, as well as engineering principles used to impart new functionalities. We will then examine the broad range of applications and implications of virus-based materials, focusing on the medical, biotechnology, and energy sectors. We anticipate that this field will continue to evolve and grow, with exciting new possibilities stemming from advancements in the rational design of virus-based nanomaterials. and nanoscience. To date, it has not been feasible to synthetically create nanoparticles of comparable reproducibility, beauty, and utility. In a collaborative effort, research into \"physical or chemical virology\" is directed toward unraveling the processes of self-assembly and genome packaging, understanding and controlling self-assembly of virus-based materials into higher-order hierarchical structures, engineering and studying virus-based and virus-like materials for applications in the health and energy sectors, and scaled-up manufacturing of such materials for applications in clinics and in devices. In this review, we provide a general synopsis of the engineering of virus-based and virus-like materials and we will discuss the manifold and diverse applications of such. We start by introducing the use of viruses from a materials perspective and consider the methods for producing and modifying these particles. We then survey some recent developments in the expansion of their applications, with discussion focused on the utilization of virus-based materials for medicine (delivery systems and contrast agents), biotechnology (nanoreactors and sensing devices), and energy (battery electrodes and storage devices). Finally, we assess the opportunities and challenges for clinical or commercial application of virus-inspired materials.",

            "text": "Nanoscale engineering is revolutionizing diverse disciplines in science and engineering. The use of viral scaffolds in particular has led to advancements of scientific knowledge in selfassembly and the development of novel materials with wide-ranging applications. Viruses have been studied for more than 100 years, and more than 5,000 types of viruses have been discovered and described. They come in a variety of shapes and sizes, and from a chemist's point of view they harbor many natural features that are uniquely relevant to nanotechnology crystal structures. [11] [12] [13] [14] In this manner, viruses can simply be used as well-ordered materials, separate from their normal role in infection. Most viruses are made up of coat protein subunits that naturally self-assemble into truly monodisperse particles. With more understanding of the coat protein building blocks and chemical biology, ever increasing complex assemblies can be programmed, including nanoboomerang-and tetrapod-shaped virus materials. 15 Large-scale production of viruses can be easily achieved through propagation in their natural hosts or expression in a heterologous system (see Section 2.2). Additionally, these particles come in a variety of shapes and sizes 16, 17 that can function as nanoscaffolds that can be easily and reproducibly modified 18 . As shown in Figure 1 , the most common architectures are icosahedrons, filaments, and phage head-and-tail structures, but more diverse structures such as spindle-, zipper-, and bottle-shaped viruses also exist. 17, 19 While there is the biotechnology arm where we seek to engineer particles for applications in medicine and energy, there is also a basic arm that investigates virus assembly and structure. These two arms of research are interconnected, with crosstalk between the two fields providing insights for advancement. For example, study of the physics of the packing signals of RNA viruses led to its application in the encapsulation of therapeutics for nanomedical applications (see Sections 4.1.4-4.1.5). 14, 20 Additionally, fundamental understanding of the interactions involved in particle self-assembly informed the fabrication of novel imaging agents (see Section 4.1.2). 21, 22 Through multidisciplinary collaboration, the use of viral scaffolds as unique materials for diverse applications can be realized.",

            "text": "To differentiate between viruses containing their native nucleic acid, which are referred to as viral nanoparticles (VNPs), viruses devoid of their nucleic acid are considered virus-like particles (VLPs). Further classification of viruses can be based on a number of features, including the shape and structure of their capsids (as shown in Figure 1 ), the type of nucleic acid they contain (double-stranded (ds) or single-stranded (ss), RNA or DNA), and their host species. Classical virology taxonomy utilizes the Baltimore classification of viruses, in which the viruses are grouped both according to their genomes as well as their method of replication. 23 Figure 2 illustrates the seven different classifications of viruses, demonstrating how they have evolved many different strategies for replication. However, for the most part, we will be considering plant viruses and bacteriophages (noninfectious particles) for use as materials, making the native cargo of the capsids less relevant. Mammalian viruses, such as adenovirus (class I -dsDNA virus) and adeno-associated virus (AAV, class II -ssDNA virus), do offer many advantages for applications in gene therapy, in which they can be administered to make modifications to the genetic sequence for therapeutic or prophylactic purposes (see Section 4.1.4). 24 They also present opportunities in cancer immunotherapy, as seen in the recent approval of T-VEC for treatment of melanoma (see Section 4.1.3). Nevertheless, bacteriophage-and plant virus-derived materials may offer advantages, as their manufacture is scalable through fermentation and molecular farming. Additionally, these materials are not infectious toward mammals, adding another layer of safety. Both these factors are important considerations as we move toward clinical applications and commercialization.",

            "text": "Other than genomic content and host species, shape and size are important characteristics that should be considered for the choice of material used. Section 4.1.1 highlights some of the design guidelines for determining the desired properties for delivery vectors for nanomedical applications. For icosahedral viruses, the triangulation number, or T number, is one method of classification that gives an indication as to their size (see Figure 1 ). The T number was first described by Donald Caspar and Aaron Klug in 1962. 25 By multiplying by 60, it can be used to determine the number of coat proteins in a capsid. For example, a T = 1 virus has 60 coat proteins, while a T = 4 virus has 240 coat proteins. The proteins are clustered into pentamers and hexamers, and a virus with icosahedral symmetry therefore consists of 12 pentamers and 10(T-1) hexamers. Size plays a factor in the transport and clearance behavior of a particle, as well as the amount of cargo that can be carried and delivered to a cell, a challenge with the smaller AAV (T = 1, ~20 nm in diameter). Additionally, the shape of the particles affects the possible modifications and functions that could be applied to the capsid. For example, icosahedrons have the advantage of possessing an interior cavity that can be used for the infusion and encapsulation of various payloads. On the other hand, high aspect ratio particles can be used to form wires, which can then be applied for energy applications. Overall, it is clear that there is a diverse library of virus particles to select from, no matter the application.",

            "text": "A variety of methods have been developed for the production of virus particles, and we will discuss their manufacture in bacteria, yeast, insect cells, plants, and using cell-free systems, starting with one of the most widely utilized systems for the rapid production of proteins with ease of scale-up, Escherichia coli. 26 Although other prokaryotic systems can also be considered, such as Pseudomonas fluorescens, 27 the wealth of knowledge surrounding E. coli production makes it popular, and therefore it has also been widely applied for the production of VLPs. Viral coat proteins can be expressed and spontaneously self-assembled in the bacterial cells, and this has been demonstrated for bacteriophages, such as Q\u03b2 28 and MS2, 29 as well as for heterologous expression of other viruses, such as plant virus-based TMV 30 and mammalian virus-based hepatitis B virus (HBV) core particles. 31 It should be noted that while VLPs formed in this way do not contain their own genomic content, they are also not \"empty\", as they tend to package host nucleic acids. For example, about 25% of the mass of Q\u03b2 VLPs (a system that has undergone clinical testing) consists of E. coli RNA. 32 For applications where the packaged nucleic acid is undersirable, several methods have been developed to remove the nucleic acid components after particle assembly. [33] [34] [35] These methods include treatment with heavy metals such as lead acetate, 33 incubation in alkaline conditions for RNA hydrolysis, 34 and induction of osmotic shock using a high molarity sodium sulfate solution. 35 Another approach for production of empty VLPs is in vitro assembly of coat protein subunits after production in E. coli and purification. In vitro assembly is also a way to overcome challenges with insolubility of some eukaryotic capsid proteins in the bacteria cells that result in their accumulation in inclusion bodies. 36 Digressing briefly, it is of significance to note that some headway has been made with producing soluble eukaryotic cDNA of the virus genome, or even in vitro RNA transcripts to the leaves of the plant after gentle abrasion. 54, 55 Agroinfiltration by injecting a suspension of Agrobacterium tumefaciens bacteria into leaves is also used for molecular farming in plants. 56 These bacteria transfer part of their tumor inducing plasmid into the plant cell, which can be exploited for transient expression of genes of interest. Of note, Medicago Inc. uses this plant-based approach for the efficient production of VLP-based vaccines for influenza and rabies, among others. Other therapeutics such as the ZMAPP monoclonal antibody cocktail against Ebola virus (EBOV) from Mapp Biopharmaceutical also utilize plant production with agroinfiltration. 57 Replication of intact VNPs such as BMV has been demonstrated. 58 Additionally, viral capsids of CPMV completely devoid of RNA (either virus or host) can be produced in this way. 59 Whereas BMV production utilized plasmids that transiently express BMV RNAs to systemically infect plants, for empty CPMV (eCPMV) VLP production, using plasmids encoding just two proteins was found to be sufficient: VP60, which is a precursor to CPMV's two coat proteins, and 24K proteinase for proteolytic processing of VP60. As mentioned previously, consistent empty VLP production in vivo has only been demonstrated for the eCPMV platform. Aside from farming in the plants themselves, some new technology that may be applied in the future for the production of VLPs is the use of plant cell packs for transient expression, where plant suspension cells are packed into a \"cookie\" through suctioning, then Agrobacterium containing the gene for the protein of interest applied. 60 This approach has been proven to produce high yields of recombinant proteins and can be applied in a high throughput manner, making it an attractive option for VLP expression.",

The beauty and utility of these particles have been recognized, and efforts have been made toward mimicking these nanoscale architectures through self-assembly of protein nanomaterials. 65 The unique genetically encoded protein shell architecture of virus-based scaffolds allows for a large range of techniques that can be used to tailor and modify these materials. Among the most frequently used of these that we will discuss are genetic engineering, bioconjugation, infusion, biomineralization, and self-assembly ( Figure 3) .

Nucleic acid sequences of viruses are relatively small, and therefore many of their genomes have been sequenced and are well characterized. Using genetic engineering, insertion or replacement of residues can be performed to add functional groups, with cysteine mutants being the most popular due to possible disulfide linkages, association with gold, and bioconjugation with thiol-selective chemistries. [66] [67] [68] [69] [70] Insertion of unnatural amino acids is also possible, allowing for more diverse chemical modifications. 71, 72 Additionally, removal of residues can be accomplished such that only a single unique reactive site remains on the coat protein. 73 Aside from single residue modifications, larger changes such as insertion of purification tags can also be accomplished. For example, due to their affinity and coordination with nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid (Ni-NTA), polyhistidine tags have been expressed on viral capsids to serve as anchors for applications that include tethering them to surfaces, attaching other particles such as nanogold and iron oxide, and assembling higher-order structures.

Both the interior and exterior surfaces of many viruses have been shown to be amenable to chemical modifications. [88] [89] [90] Some common groups that can be functionalized include lysine, aspartic/glutamic acid, cysteine, and tyrosine residues, which lend themselves to standard bioconjugation reactions involving Nhydroxysuccinimide (NHS) ester conjugation, carbodiimide activation, Michael addition, and azo coupling chemistries. Some alternatives to these natural amino acids include replacing methionine residues with homopropargyl glycine (HPG) or azidohomoalanine (AHA) residues to add alkyne or azide functionalities, respectively. 71 Another interesting method utilizes mutant tRNA synthetases to attach unnatural amino acids to amber suppressor tRNAs for incorporation of these amino acids at amber stop codon sites. 72, 91 Among the amino acids incorporated in this way are O-methyltyrosine, pazidophenylalanine, p-acetylphenylalanine, p-benzoylphenylalanine, 3-(2-naphthyl)alanine, and p-aminophenylalanine (pAF). p-azidophenylalanine and pAF are particularly noteworthy due to providing azide and amine groups, respectively, for selective coupling reactions. As can be noted, incorporation of azide and alkyne groups is an especially widespread strategy. These conjugation handles allow for copper(I)-catalyzed azide-alkyne cycloaddition (CuAAC), an efficient and biocompatible procedure that has found great versatility. [92] [93] [94] [95] [96] Reaction without copper catalysis can also be achieved by utilizing cyclooctyne derivatives, which lower the activation barrier due to the ring strain. 97 Additional reaction handles that have been utilized include aldehydes and ketones for hydrazone or oxime condensation reactions. 88, [98] [99] [100] Selective formation of aldehydes or ketones is possible, where pyridoxal 5'-phosphate (PLP)-mediated transamination specific for the N-terminus leads to in situ oxidation of the N-terminal amine. 101 The formed ketone or an aldehyde group can then be used to form stable oxime linkages with alkoxyamines. With the availability of a wide range of chemically modifiable natural and unnatural amino acids, multiple functional groups can be simultaneously incorporated within a single virusbased particle to result in the formation of a versatile, multifunctional platform.",

            "text": "One area of particle modification that is of great interest is the formation of protein/polymer hybrid conjugates. Polyethylene glycol (PEG) is a polymer frequently used for shielding biological interactions, and attachment of PEG through aforementioned bioconjugation techniques is fairly standard. 89, 102, 103 More sophisticated polymerization chemistry techniques have also been shown to be applicable for polymer attachment to virus-based particles, and more widespread application of these could confer advantages of better efficiency and more control over the polydispersity. Atom-transfer radical polymerization (ATRP) is one such method, where small initiators can be added to the particles first then polymerization from the capsid carried out through the introduction of monomers, resulting in easier purification of the smaller reagents as well as overcoming challenges with steric hindrance of large bulky polymers. 33, 104, 105 Incorporation of polymers using this method has proven to useful for the attachment or complexation of large payloads of MR contrast agents, chemotherapeutics, and siRNA and for both interior 33, 104 and exterior 105 modification. Polymers could also be synthesized first with ATRP before attachment to the viral capsid, such as for the display of glycoproteins. 106 (ROMP) is another method for biocompatible polymer synthesis, and it was utilized to prepare water-soluble polynorbornene-based polymers with strict size and architecture control, which had a good safety profile when attached to Q\u03b2 and delivered to fibroblast cells. 107 Aside from chemistries that rely on covalent bonds, supramolecular chemistry strategies can also be utilized for virus modification. For example, by taking advantage of the hydrophobic interior of \u03b2-cyclodextrin that allows it to accommodate a range of guest molecules, virus particles first modified with \u03b2-cyclodextrin moieties can then be functionalized with derivatives of such guest molecules. This approach has been demonstrated using derivatives of adamantine for the display of an imaging agent, chemotherapeutic drug, targeting ligand, and PEG polymer. 108 In a similar manner, charge-transfer interactions between electron donors and acceptors can also be used for derivatization of viral scaffolds. As an illustration, attachment of pyrene molecules allowed for particle functionalization through interaction with electron-deficient dinitrophenyl and pyridinium motifs. 109 ",

Viruses are generally flexible and contain pores that allow for diffusion of small molecules, such as drugs and contrast agents, into and out of the capsid. Retention of the molecules inside the capsid can then be achieved through electrostatic and/or affinity interactions with the nucleic acid within the shell 93, 110, 111 or interactions with polymers conjugated internally. 33, 104 Encapsulation of molecules can also be accomplished by gating using pH or metal ion concentration to trigger structural transitions. Using the gating process, molecules are allowed to diffuse into the particle under an environment where the capsid is in a swollen, open conformation, and then the molecules are trapped within the capsid as the pores are closed off through change in buffer conditions.

There is a great breadth in the types of cargo that can be encapsulated through self-assembly, including gold nanoparticles, quantum dots, and photosensitizer drugs. 21, [123] [124] [125] [126] Since coat proteins naturally self-assemble around negatively charged nucleic acids, in general a more negative surface charge results in more efficient encapsulation of the foreign cargo. 123 Native packaging mechanisms can also be utilized, which was demonstrated with adding oligonucleotides mimicking the origin of assembly for RCNMV's packaging of its RNA on various nanoparticles to induce particle formation around the different cargo. 127 Size plays a factor in assembly due to its effect on the radius of curvature, and differently sized cargo could result in alterations in the morphology and physical characteristics of the capsid. [123] [124] [125] As seen in Section 3.1, coat proteins can be genetically modified for incorporation of foreign protein cargo during particle assembly. One study fused the coat proteins of CCMV to elastin-like polypeptides (ELPs), which exhibit lower critical solution temperature (LCST) behavior, and the investigators found two different self-assembly pathways from the resultant hybrid. 128 While VLPs consisting of 90 coat protein dimers were formed under normal pH-induced self-assembly conditions, when the NaCl concentration was increased to lower the ELP transition temperature, the ELP-induced assembly resulted in the formation of smaller particles consisting of 30 coat protein dimers. Enzyme facilitation is another method for coat protein modification, which was demonstrated through the use of sortase A to covalently attach a protein with a C-terminal LPETG tag to glycines at the N-terminus of CCMV coat proteins before assembly for protein encapsulation. 129 Specific binding interactions with the coat protein can also be exploited for self-assembly. Engineering of coiled-coil protein interactions was established by introducing a lysine coil at the Nterminus of CCMV that can associate with a glutamic acid coil at the C-terminus of a fluorescent protein, which resulted in encapsulation of the protein when the two modified proteins were combined. 130 Introducing histidine tags that have affinity for Ni-NTA is another method. 77 Additionally, some interactions that naturally exist for some particles include the association of scaffold proteins with bacteriophage P22 that aids in viral assembly 131, 132 and the binding of translational repression operator proteins to RNA stemloops within MS2 bacteriophages. 14 Fusions to these proteins can then be utilized for encapsulation of materials of interest, such as enzyme cascades and therapeutic molecules.",

            "text": "It is likely that the shape and flexibility of PVX plays an additional role in its ability to diffuse throughout the tumor. A comparison between the diffusion profiles of a spherical and rod-shaped particle was performed with CPMV and TMV using a spheroid model, and it was shown that whereas CPMV experienced a steady diffusion profile, TMV exhibited a two-phase diffusion behavior that entailed an extremely rapid early loading phase, which could be attributed to its movement axially, acting like a needle. 147 Some other advantageous properties that are conferred by elongated particles include better margination toward the vessel wall and stronger adherence due to greater surface area for interaction, which not only have implications for tumor homing but also for enhanced targeting of cardiovascular disease. 148, 149 Shape is a difficult parameter to account for due to the challenge of producing monodisperse particles that can be precisely and reproducibly tailored at the nanoscale, but this challenge can be surmounted using VNPs and VLPs due to the specificity of their self-assembly process. Some bottom-up assembly approaches have been investigated recently to elucidate the role of aspect ratio in cell uptake, biodistribution, and tumor homing. In one approach, CPMV particles were linked together to form chains in order to maintain charge and surface properties while modifying the aspect ratio, and dimers with an aspect ratio of 2 were found to target cancer cells more efficiently than single particles. 150 Higher aspect ratios were investigated in another study that utilized in vitro assembly of TMV around synthetic RNA to form rods of various lengths (300, 130 , and 60 nm, corresponding to aspect ratios of 16.5, 7, and 3.5) . 151 For receptor-targeted particles modified with the RGD ligand, rods with an intermediate aspect ratio of 7 were found to be more efficient at tumor targeting due to a combination of better macrophage avoidance and greater adhesion to target integrins compared to the short rods and better diffusion within the tumor compared to the long rods. Based on the aforementioned spheroid study with TMV, 147 it is likely that the three aspect ratios experience similar axial diffusion during the initial rapid phase, but then longer particles are impeded during the slower distribution phase. In contrast, PVX particles with an aspect ratio of 40 appear not be hindered by their length and in fact experience better penetration in relation to icosahedral CPMV. 143 Some possible reasons to account for this include a thinner cross-section and greater flexibility for PVX compared to TMV. To further expand understanding of the role of shape, other factors such as density and flexibility should be considered in future studies.",

            "text": "Surface presentation of shielding polymers also plays a role in the in vivo behavior of virusbased particles. PEG is the standard polymer used to reduce immunogenicity and nonspecific cell interactions. The importance of polymer coatings is particularly apparent in the study highlighted above with different aspect ratios of TMV. Although it was found that targeted particles fared better when intermediate in size, coating the TMV with PEG allowed the shorter rods to be better able to avoid clearance and, paired with their superior diffusion properties within the tumor, resulted in increased passive tumor targeting of the short 60 nm PEGylated rods. 151 Surface PEGylation has been applied to many VNPs and has been established as a broadly applicable method for extending circulation time. 102, 138, 152, 153 Additionally, differences in the route of clearance was also observed, with non-PEGylated TMV and PVX filaments getting filtered through the kidneys, while PEGylated particles do not, likely due to the increase in the width of the particles after conjugation preventing renal filtration. 102, 138, 154 The conformation of the PEG coating can be predicted computationally through estimating its surface coverage on the particle and its hydrodynamic radius to determine the packing density of the polymer. The use of higher molecular weight PEG generally results in a higher hydrodynamic radius and thus better shielding, but hydrodynamic radius is only an average and polymers can extend and collapse in solution. Despite a smaller predicted radius, branched PEG with multiple sites of attachment to the particle has been shown to be more effective at shielding than linear PEG four times its molecular weight, likely because simultaneous tethering of the ends of the PEG traps it closer to the particle, reducing its movement and the possibility of nonspecific protein adsorption. We hypothesize that the branched PEG leads to a more efficient shield, preventing the formation of a protein corona that may tag the virus-based nanoparticles for recognition by the innate immune system and lead to removal from circulation ( Figure 6 ). 102 Therefore, the dynamics of PEG in solution should also be considered when determining its conformation for optimization of particle shielding.",

For more control and diversity of polymerization, chemistries have been established for grafting polymers to and from viral scaffolds using ATRP and ROMP, as discussed in Section 3.2, but their properties in vivo have not yet been established. The use of serum albumin has been recently investigated for coating of TMV and shown to be more effective than medium-length PEG (5000 Da), with circulation times up to 10-fold greater in comparison. 159 Self peptides based on human CD47 could also be considered for inhibiting phagocytic clearance of the nanoparticles. 160 Along with surface modifications that allow them to avoid undesirable cell interactions, particles can be enhanced for specific cell targeting through the display of receptor-specific or disease environment-specific ligands. Some examples of targets that have been used for specific uptake of virus-based nanoparticles include epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) 161, 162 and folate receptor (FR). 163, 164 In such a manner, overexpressed receptors or environmental cues can be tracked for diagnostic or drug delivery purposes, which will be discussed in the following sections. To obtain the most favorable ligand display density, there is a balance between increasing avidity and reducing cellular receptor depletion that arises from increased ligand density. 165 While multivalency and a higher degree of labeling with targeting ligands is beneficial for stronger cellular interactions, too many ligands may reduce the extent of endocytosis through exhaustion of cellular receptors. Another design parameter for the inclusion of targeting ligands is the linker used for attachment. For example, the inclusion of PEG can assist in increasing circulation time and avoiding nonspecificity as discussed above. Additionally, PEG linkers can improve cell targeting by adding flexibility and enhancing presentation of targeting peptides. 166 By altering the characteristics of the linker, the interaction of the ligand with its target and the overall behavior of the particle in vivo can be tuned.",

            "text": "Fluorescence imaging is the main modality for preclinical evaluation and was used to aid in the establishment of the design rules in Section 4.1.1. Fluorescent agents can be incorporated into viral capsids through bioconjugation, 170, 171 genetic engineering, 84, 86 infusion, 110, 114 and self-assembly. 21, 130 Fluorescence is useful for quantification of particle uptake using flow cytometry, visualization of particle localization through confocal microscopy, and determination of biodistribution using in vivo imaging. Although high dye densities can easily be achieved through efficient capsid modification strategies, sensitivity decreases after a certain threshold due to fluorophores experiencing quenching when placed at distances less than approximately 10 nm. Therefore, a fairly low density of around 10% is more ideal for achieving optimal fluorescence intensity. 172 Encapsulation of indocyanine green can be utilized as a method for near infrared (NIR) photoacoustic imaging, and it has shown greater photostability compared to the chromophore alone. 173 As advancements are made, another aspect that could be explored is the integration of gold nanoparticles with fluorophores for metal-enhanced fluorescence with improved quantum yields and decreased photobleaching. 174 First iteration native and PEGylated particles can be directly evaluated for their biodistribution, pharmacokinetics, and tumor homing behavior through fluorescence imaging. 84, 90, 102, 138, 143, 175 Overall, particles are cleared mainly through the liver and spleen, with filamentous particles having a higher rate of spleen clearance compared to icosahedra l particles, 138, 143 localizing with B cells within the white pulp over time. 102, 138 Due to leaky vasculature and poor lymphatic drainage, the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect is found in solid tumors and can be utilized for tumor imaging through nanoparticle deposition. Using both mouse and chicken chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) models with tumor xenografts, the passive partitioning of particles to the tumor can be observed (Figure 7) . 84, 143 As discussed in the previous section, evaluation of localization of particles inside the tumor revealed enhanced accumulation and penetration of rod-shaped particles. 143 Besides passive tumor homing properties, natural interactions of viruses with certain cells can also be exploited. CPMV in particular exhibits unique specificity in interacting with surface vimentin, which is found on endothelial, cancer, and inflammatory cells. [176] [177] [178] [179] The native affinity of CPMV for surface vimentin allows for high-resolution imaging of microvasculature up to 500 \u03bcm in depth, which cannot be achieved through the use of other nanoparticles, as they tend to aggregate and block the vasculature. 180 This interaction can be utilized for a range of applications, such as delivery to a panel of cancer cells including cervical, breast, and colon cancer cell lines, 110 delineation of atherosclerotic lesions, 177 and intravital imaging of tumor vasculature and angiogenesis. 180 Another example of an existing endogenous association is CPV with transferrin receptor (TfR), an important receptor for iron transport into cells and highly upregulated by numerous cancer cell lines. 52 Even after dye labeling, CPV retains its specificity for TfR and was shown to bind to receptors found on HeLa cervical cancer cells, HT-29 colon cancer cells, and MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells. As a quick side note, in vivo imaging of bacterial infections and differentiation between F-positive and F-negative E. coli strains is also possible through specificity of binding of M13 phage. 181 Specificity can also be introduced through the incorporation of targeting ligands for molecular imaging. RGD is a targeting peptide that is frequently used due to its high affinity for \u03b1 v \u03b2 3 and \u03b1 v \u03b2 5 integrins, which are involved in angiogenesis and associated with cancer proliferation. 81, 151, 182, 183 The association of RGD-targeted particles with tumor vascular endothelium has been demonstrated in mice, although the study also indicated that better tumor localization would be achieved with greater circulation time imparted through incorporation of a better shielding linker (see Section 4.1.1). 151 CPMV displaying peptide F56, which was discovered through phage display, has been used to target vascular endothelial growth fa ctor receptor-1 (VEGFR-1), with accumulation throughout the tumor observed compared to no detectable uptake of non-targeted particles. 99 Other options that have been explored include FR targeting with folic acid (FA), 164, 184, 185 TfR with transferrin, 186 and prostate specific membrane antigen (PSMA) with a PSMA antibody. 187 In recent years, a target that has been approached from many angles is epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), an important biomarker overexpressed on many malignant cell types. Strategies range from display of EGF on Q\u03b2 through genetic engineering, 162 using phage antibody libraries to select for fd phages with single-chain antibody variable fragments (scFvs) specific for EGFR as well as its related receptor human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2), 101 conjugation of EGFR antibodies on MS2, 188 and also chemical attachment of GE11 peptide on PVX. 161 These studies all evaluated cell binding in vitro and there are some promising results indicating partitioning of targeted particles to tumor cells compared to macrophages in co-cultures, 161 and it would be of interest to see their development in mouse models.",

MRI is a clinically relevant method for noninvasive disease characterization with good soft tissue contrast, and the use of contrast agents in conjunction with MR can improve the signal-to-noise ratio to highlight differences between diseased and normal tissues. Gadolinium is one such paramagnetic contrast agent that can be used to achieve brighter signal in T 1 -weighted imaging. Molecular imaging of atherosclerotic plaques was achieved at dosages 400 times lower than clinically used for angiography with the encapsulation Gd chelated with 1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecane-1,4,7,10-tetraacetic acid, or Gd(DOTA), within TMV targeted to VCAM-1. 148 The high contrast can be attributed to the high payload of 1200 Gd/TMV, the slower molecular tumbling rate resulting from attachment of Gd(DOTA) to the macromolecule, inclusion of the targeting peptide, and the advantage imparted by the shape of TMV for drifting laterally to the vessel wall.",

While early work looked at the direct binding of Gd to natural metal binding sites in the capsid of CCMV, 193 the use of chelation and bioconjugation was quickly introduced to mitigate concerns of free Gd leading to toxicity in patients with underlying kidney disease, with explorations using both DOTA 93, 194 and diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (DTPA). 195 These approaches resulted in per particle T 1 relaxivities on the order of 1,000 to 8,000 mM \u22121 s \u22121 measured at 64 MHz. While fairly high and much greater than 20 mM \u22121 s \u22121 for Gd alone, these values do not approach the measurement of around 28,000 mM \u22121 s \u22121 per particle from the initial study with direct attachment of Gd. 193 To improve contrast, interior and exterior labeling 196, 197 as well as rigidity of linkers 198 was explored with MS2 using chelators based on hydroxypyridinonate (HOPO) due to its 3-fold relaxivity enhancement compared to clinically used Magnevist, or Gd(DTPA). Internally modified capsids and more rigid linkers, in particular the S,S enantiomer of 1,2-cyclohexyldiamine, each demonstrated approximately 30 to 40% higher relaxivities. Enhancing Gd loading was another method explored to increase per particle relaxivity, either using ATRP to amplify density of groups with which to attach the contrast agents 104, 105 or using branched oligomers with multiple Gd(DTPA) complexes attached. 199, 200 The greatest success with this approach led to the incorporation of over 9,000 Gd(DTPA) per P22 particle, with per particle relaxivities exceeding 200,000 mM \u22121 s \u22121 . 104 In vivo imaging was first demonstrated using P22 conjugated to Gd(DTPA) in order to visualize blood vessels in a mouse, with clear depiction of the carotid artery, mammary arteries, the jugular vein, and veins in the head at a resolution of 250 \u03bcm. 200 More recently, relaxivities approaching 1,000,000 mM \u22121 s \u22121 per particle were reported by utilizing TMV's greater surface area conferred by its shape to introduce a large payload of Gd(DOTA), accompanied by thermal transition of the rods using conditions that result in 200 nm spheres. 201 Coating interiorly labeled TMV particles with silica could potentially increase the relaxivity 3-fold as well as lead to greater macrophage uptake and hence contrast. 202 It is expected that a combination of these research directions investigating chelators, linkers, conjugation, shape shifting, and coating will result in particles with even greater contrast for better visualization of disease.",

Manganese research is relatively new and labeling of P22 with Mn porphyrins was shown to have a per particle relaxivity of 7,000 mM \u22121 s \u22121 at 90 MHz, and while this is low compared to advancements in Gd imaging, it is a promising avenue to pursue due to the reduced toxicity of Mn. 203 Unlike Gd and Mn, iron oxide is a contrast agent for T 2 -weighted imaging and is observed from a resultant darker image. Interestingly, the first demonstration of MR imaging with iron oxide was in plants, where cubic iron oxide nanoparticles were encapsulated within BMV, Nicotiana benthamiana leaves were infiltrated with the modified virus, and imaging was performed with cell-to-cell trafficking of the encapsulated iron oxide observed. 204 Encapsulation of iron oxide nanoparticles and phantom imaging has been demonstrated with hepatitis B core VLPs. 77 Moving toward translation, attachment of iron oxide nanoparticles along with SPARC binding peptides to the surface of M13 was effective for the imaging of prostate cancer (Figure 8) . 205 Another MR contrast approach that is quite new is chemical exchange saturation transfer (CEST) and hyperCEST imaging. Xenon-based agents in particular have been explored for viruses. After selective saturation of these nuclei, an enhanced water signal is observed due to saturation transfer to surrounding bulk water. This technique has found success with MS2, 206 M13, 207 and fd, 208 with sensitivities as low as 230 fM. 207 By additionally incorporating scFVs that recognize EGFR, molecular imaging and contrast specificity were demonstrated with MDA-MB-231 cancer cells, with essentially no contrast in Jurkat negative control cells. 208 Due to the more than 10,000-fold increase in sensitivity, there is a lot of potential in this new technology.",

            "text": "Instead of live viruses, safer alternatives for vaccines have since been established, including attenuated viruses, inactivated or subunit viruses, non-infectious VLPs, nanoparticle delivery, and nucleic acid vaccines. 215, 216 Vaccines have been researched for a wide range of diseases, with great success for some diseases such as polio 217 and measles, 218 but some important vaccines such as for HIV and EBOV are still lacking, which are discussed below. Eliciting effective and long-term immune response is one challenge for vaccines, and the use of virus capsids offers the advantages of multivalent antigen presentation, incorporation of multiple epitopes, and particle stability. Since the field is enormous, we would like to feature just some of the research on vaccination, focusing on a few studies in the areas of infectious disease, brain disorders, and cancer. For a more comprehensive overview of virus-based particles for vaccines, the reader is invited to consult further reviews. 219, 220 In the realm of infectious diseases, HIV is particularly challenging to address due to sequence diversity and difficulty in generating broadly neutralizing antibodies. This is likely to be partially due to its structural characteristics, consisting of a low number of envelope spikes that allows it to escape recognition as foreign and increases the likelihood of evolving envelope determinants that mimic self. 221 High density display of HIV antigens is one method to combat this, with trimeric glycoproteins gp41 and gp120, as well as their precursor gp160 being highly targeted. As an example, a recent investigation studied the effect of presentation of the particularly conserved membrane-proximal external region (MPER) of HIV-1 gp41 on VLPs, and the approach produced anti-MPER antibodies that showed neutralizing activity in a rabbit model. 222 Albeit moderate, the production of neutralizing antibodies is a valuable therapeutic response that could be improved through modifying MPER presentation. Another potential target for vaccines is CCR5, a cellular self-protein found to be involved as a co-receptor for HIV replication and pathogenesis. High-density display of CCR5-based peptides on Q\u03b2 resulted in high IgG antibody titers, which was able to protect 25% of rhesus macaques against intravaginal challenge with the highly virulent SIVmac251 strain. 223 In terms of potential vaccines undergoing clinical trials, some success has been seen for the use of a treatment combining ALVAC, a canarypox vector vaccine, with boosters of AIDSVAX, a gp120 subunit vaccine, where vaccine efficacy of 31.2% was observed in a study consisting of 16,395 subjects in Thailand. 224 While work still remains to be done to improve the efficacy of HIV vaccines, great strides have been made in recent years toward its realization.",

Ebola VLPs have been generated consisting of glycoprotein, nucleoprotein, and VP40 matrix protein from the virus using a baculovirus expression system, and cynomolgus macaques vaccinated with the VLPs were completely protected against lethal EBOV challenge, with strong T cell responses likely contributing. 225 Further investigation of Ebola VLPs consisting of glycoprotein and VP40 also produced in insect cells demonstrated the potential of delivery without adjuvants and revealed a strong immune response that protected against lethal challenge in mice when high doses (50 \u03bcg) were utilized. 226 Optimization is still needed to enhance immunogenicity, and some prospects include improving glycoprotein incorporation during VLP assembly and including immunostimulatory molecules within the particles. A potential safer alternative to Ebola VLPs is the use of other viruses to display EBOV antigens instead. Vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) is one such virus that has been studied, and using highly attenuated forms of VSV that have been genetically engineered to incorporate EBOV glycoprotein in place of its own has been an effective strategy, with a single dose being sufficient to protect both guinea pigs and macaques from challenge. 227 These results are highly encouraging, and it will be interesting to see if there is effective protection against other strains of EBOV.",

            "text": "Aside from vaccines for human viral infections, it is of great interest to investigate animal vaccines as well for the protection of pets and livestock. An early study inserted a short epitope from the VP2 capsid protein of mink enteris virus (MEV) within the capsid of CPMV and found that it imparted protective immunity against clinical disease in mink, with a dose of 1 mg not only offering complete protection but also reducing shedding of the virus. 79 Since the epitope occurs in canine parvovirus and feline panleukopenia virus as well, the same platform could be used for protection of minks, dogs, and cats. As another example, foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) is a highly infectious virus that affects cloven-hoofed animals such as cattle and sheep, which are important in farming. Empty FMDV capsids produced using a baculovirus system and tested in guinea pigs were able to generate neutralizing antibodies against FMDV, but at a lower level than the commercial inactivated vaccine. 228 There was still good antigenicity and immunogenicity, and use of crude protein extracts may have resulted in lower particle quantities in the experimental setup. Thus, the results are exciting for the use of noninfectious empty capsids to treat FMDV. Bluetongue virus (BTV) is another problematic disease that has been detrimental to the agricultural industry due to its high morbidity and mortality, affecting ruminants such as sheep and cattle. VLPs of BTV produced using a baculovirus expression system were found to be protective against infection when tested in sheep, with effective delivery of both singleserotype and multi-serotype cocktails and no interference observed from the presence of antibodies against other serotypes. 229 BTV VLPs can also be assembled in plants using a CPMV-based HyperTrans vector system, and vaccination with these VLPs provided protection against BTV challenge. 230 The particles were found to elicit a strong antibody response in sheep after a booster dose, comparable to live, attenuated virus used in a commercial vaccine. The development of vaccines in plant-based systems could result in cheap, easily scalable production without the danger of animal pathogen contamination. 231 Interestingly, vaccines can also be applied to brain disorders such as addiction and Alzheimer's disease. Nicotine from tobacco use is the most common drug addiction worldwide, and reduction of nicotine transport to the brain has been found to decrease dependency on the drug due to reducing stimulation of the mesolimbic reward system. 232 Nicotine covalently coupled to Q\u03b2 resulted in high drug-specific IgG antibody production in vaccinated mice, and the binding of the antibodies to nicotine caused a decrease in nicotine levels in the brain of up to 90% in individual mice. 233 Further, Phase I trials found that this approach was safe and well tolerated, with high antibody production against nicotine in all individuals. Phase II trials have demonstrated that nicotine vaccines can be effective for patients quitting smoking, but there is still room to improve antibody titers for greater efficacy. 234 Turning to Alzheimer's disease, amyloid-\u03b2 (A\u03b2) peptide deposits are associated with the development of the neurodegenerative disorder and can be targeted with vaccines to reduce aggregation and ameliorate symptoms. In one study, hepatitis B virus core proteins displaying two 15-amino acid A\u03b2 fragments taken from the N-terminus were assembled into chimeric VLPs and used in the immunization of an Alzheimer's transgenic mouse model without inclusion of additional adjuvant. 235 The VLPs elicited a potent humoral response that reduced A\u03b2 deposition and microgliosis, and there was a resultant improvement in learning and memory, with immunized mice more readily learning and remembering the location of the hidden platform in a Morris water maze. Another therapeutic that has potential for Alzheimer's disease is CAD106, a Q\u03b2-based vaccine displaying the first six amino acids of A\u03b2 that is undergoing Phase II testing for long-term treatment of patients with mild Alzheimer's disease. 236 Overall, multiple exposures to CAD106 resulted in a prolonged time to antibody titer decline, and the treatment had favorable safety and tolerability profiles, with no occurrences of the severe adverse responses found in A\u03b2 antibody therapies, such as meningoencephalitis and autoimmune disease. More time is needed to observe the long-term treatment effects of the vaccine, but so far the results are promising.",

Recently, Merck brought Gardasil 9 to market, an HPV vaccine upgrade from Gardasil that protects against 9 serotypes of HPV that account for 90% of HPV-related cancers. 237 While this is fantastic news, alternatives are necessary due to issues with cost and distribution in the developing world. Commercial vaccines are VLPs derived from the L1 major capsid protein of HPV, which is not conserved across serotypes. Thus, a simpler approach that can be more broadly protective would be more ideal. As an example, efforts have been made to produce highly immunogenic L2 VLPs that are stable over time without refrigeration. 238 Although the L2 minor capsid protein of HPV is less exposed and less immunogenic, it is highly conserved across serotypes, and MS2 displaying a short L2 peptide from HPV type 16 worked particularly well in preclinical mouse models. Reconstituted virus after spray drying remained highly immunogenic without use of an adjuvant even after 7 months of storage at room temperature, and mice vaccinated with the 16L2-MS2 VLPs were additionally protected from heterologous HPV pseudovirions of types 31 and 45, while Gardasil only protected against type 31.",

HER2 is a receptor overexpressed on breast cancers that tend to be more aggressive and is one potential target for cancer immunotherapy. Presentation of P4 378-394 , a B-cell epitope from the extracellular domain of HER2, on PVX led to higher antibody titers that were specific to HER2 compared to soluble P4 peptide alone. 239 PVXbased carriers are promising for vaccines due to their tropism toward B cells 154 and large surface area imparted by their filamentous nature leading to high multivalency. A different approach against HER2 cancer cells resulted in T cell mediated tumor prevention by utilizing the association between the minor capsid protein VP2 of murine polyomavirus (MPyV) with the internal surface of major capsid protein VP1. 240 The VP2 coat proteins were fused to HER2 1-683 and the particles were assembled in such a way that immunization of mice with the VLPs resulted in antibodies to VP1 but not HER2. On the other hand, the VLPs induced the production of HER2-specific T cells, and in both an autochthonous HER2 breast cancer mouse model and a model in which mice were challenged with HER2-positive D2F2/E2 cells (but not in a model with HER2-negative D2F2 cells), complete protection against tumor growth was observed for over 80% of the mice. Therefore, this is a potential approach for a potent prophylactic vaccine against HER2 cancer. Beside cell surface receptors, Tn antigen, a tumor-associated carbohydrate antigen, has been widely explored for presentation on viral capsids, with investigations into utilizing particles such as CPMV, TMV, and Q\u03b2. [241] [242] [243] Although Tn is one of the weakest antigens, strategic patterned display of the antigen was able to induce a potent humoral immune response that recognized human tumor cells. Evaluation of Tn presentation for in vivo cancer protection will be an essential next step for carrying this forward as a cancer vaccine therapeutic.",

            "text": "It is clear that by taking advantage of the body's natural immune system, myriad applications for virus-based vaccines can be realized. We would like to briefly highlight the application of viruses for immunotherapy as well, especially with the recent groundbreaking approval of the first oncolytic virus (OV) for cancer therapy by the FDA in October 2015. 135 T-VEC was approved for the treatment of melanoma patients and is a viral vector based on HSV type 1. The mechanism of action for OVs is not yet well understood but appears to involve both lysis from more rapid replication within tumor cells as well as promotion of systemic antitumor immune response. 244 T-VEC encodes for granulocyte-macrophage colonystimulating factor (GM-CSF), a cytokine involved in dendritic cell recruitment maturation that aids in additional stimulation of anti-tumor immunity. In phase III clinical trials, treatment with T-VEC led to durable responses, even for patients with advanced stage IV disease. The approval of T-VEC is a significant step forward, and future investigations will be important for enhancing efficacy through combination approaches (Figure 9 ) as well as for the establishment of safety profiles and regulatory guidelines. For more information on the action of OVs and other recent developments in this field, please refer to the following reviews. 244, 245 As a final example of the effectiveness of virus particles for immunostimulation, a recent study, in which we collaborated with the Fiering Lab at Darmouth University, demonstrated that in situ vaccination of tumors with eCPMV, just the capsid without any nucleic acid or modification, could help overcome the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. 246 Treatment with eCPMV led to reduction and even regression of tumor growth and metastasis in a variety of mouse models, including melanoma, ovarian carcinoma, colon cancer, and breast carcinoma. eCPMV was found to specifically target and activate neutrophils in the tumor microenvironment, leading to a strong and rapid anti-tumor response. The response was found to be systemic and durable, with mice that eliminated primary B16F10 melanoma tumors through eCPMV-mediated immunity resistant to re-challenge and three out of four mice completely rejecting the tumor (Figure 10 ). Systemic protection is likely the result of immune memory against tumor antigens and mediated by T cells. These results were established for unmodified eCPMV, therefore opening the opportunity for further enhancement of efficacy through the display of antigens or the inclusion of adjuvants and chemotherapeutics.",

            "text": "A similar outcome for combining targeting and transfection can also be achieved through covalent coating of adenovirus with a hydrophilic polymer to result in retargeting of the virus as well as protection from antibody neutralization. 155 High immunogenicity is one of the downfalls for adenovirus delivery, resulting mainly from intravascular injection, 265 and antibodies produced are primarily against the hexon capsid protein. 266 While adenovirus can still be utilized for local administration, by shielding the hexons and incorporating targeting ligands, systemic delivery with target selectivity independent of CAR is made possible. Amine-reactive pHPMA-based polymers (mentioned previously in Section 4.1.1) have been used for adenovirus coating, and further modification of the virus with targeting ligands such as basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) 155 or antibodies against E-selectin and P-selectin glycoprotein ligand-1 (PSGL-1) fused to IgG1 Fc 267 have been demonstrated for retargeting of adenovirus to cancer cells and tumorassociated vasculature. Additionally, pHPMA-coated adenovirus with activatable cell penetrating peptides attached enabled cytoplasmic delivery of the virus to metalloproteinaseoverexpressing tumor cells. 268 Transduction with pHPMA copolymer coatings was shown to be maintained not only in cell cultures but also in vivo in mouse models. 267, 269 PEG has also been shown to be an effective polymer for shielding 270 and retargeting. 271 As an improvement to simple PEG coatings, complexation with copolymers of PEG and PEI resulted in the ability to transduce CAR-negative NIH 3T3 cells, with the added benefit of less toxicity compared to PEI alone. 272 Aside from PEI, cationic poly(amidoamine) (PAMAM) dendrimers can also be used for enhancing gene delivery. Through the addition of EGFR-specific ligand GE11, dendrimer-coated adenovirus carrying the sodium iodide symporter gene (NIS) was successfully applied for radiovirotherapy in a liver cancer xenograft mouse model, in addition taking advantage of iodide for 124 I PET imaging of viral distribution. 157 While mammalian viruses have the machinery for gene transduction, phages and plant viruses also hold potential for gene delivery and gene silencing. Early phage gene delivery was reported through targeting M13 to EGF with a mammalian gene cassette inserted into the vector backbone. 273 Transduction was low but could be improved through the use of multivalent phagemid-based vectors (discussed in Section 4.2.1) and genotoxic treatment such as heat shock, UV irradiation, and camptothecin treatment. As a more practical method to overcome cellular barriers of mammalian cells, inspiration from HBV was taken and the PreS1 region of the HBV envelope protein involved in virus attachment during infection was displayed on bacteriophage T7, which resulted in more efficient gene transfer when tested in HepG2 human hepatocellular carcinoma cells. 274 Another hybrid phage complex, this time with cationic polymers poly-D-lysine (PDL) and diethylaminoethyl-dextran (DEAE-DEX), was also able to improve transgene expression, and cell type specificity was retained from the display of RGD. 275 Gene delivery with plant viruses is only beginning to take shape and has recently been demonstrated through assembly of CCMV coat proteins around heterologous RNA derived from Sindbis virus (SINV), which was shown to be released into the cytoplasm of mammalian cells through co-delivery of Lipofectamine-2000 ( Figure  11 ). 276 For gene silencing, MS2 phage has been especially popular for packaging of RNA. Encapsulation of a cocktail of anti-cyclin small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) to silence expression of cyclin A2, cyclin B1, cyclin D1, and cyclin E1 in MS2 was shown to protect the RNA from degradation for over 3 months when stored in the fridge. 277 Targeting these VLPs to hepatocellular carcinoma cells resulted induced apoptosis in over 90% of the cells at 150 pM siRNA concentration, with no substantial effect on the viability of normal hepatocytes. siRNA delivery with MS2 has been corroborated, with delivery of Bcl2 siRNA packaged within MS2 targeted to TfR of HeLa cells causing enhanced gene knockdown and apoptosis compared to non-targeted particles and having effectiveness similar to a commercial lipid transfection reagent. 20 miRNA-mediated RNA interference (RNAi) has also been explored, with MS2 conjugated with HIV-1 Tat 47-57 peptides shown to be able to effectively transfer encapsulated pre-miRNA into a range of cell lines and tissue types, which was processed into mature miRNA and subsequently suppressed expression of specific target gene. 278 The same group also showed packaging of antisense RNA delivered with the same Tat peptide for inhibition of hepatitis C virus (HCV) RNA translation. 279 While so far these studies have mainly been proof-of-concept, they suggest VLPs have much potential as gene delivery systems, with many directions for gene therapy applications.",

Photothermal therapy is an area whose potential has barely been tapped in the virus realm. In general, heat is produced by metallic nanostructures through the absorption of NIR or infrared light to induce hyperthermia, which can be utilized for killing susceptible tumor cells. Using such an approach, treatment can be applied to a specific area and toxicity elsewhere is reduced. So far, there has been one study, in which 1.3 nm gold was covalently attached to adenovirus and delivered to HeLa cells, where the possibility of using virus-based particles for a combination of photothermal and gene cancer therapy was discussed. 280 Other studies since then have also been successful in attaching gold to VNPs, 281, 282 but photothermal therapy using these formulations has yet to be explored.",

Initially, PDT was applied as an antimicrobial approach, using CCMV functionalized with a ruthenium-based photosensitizer and directed to Staphylococcus aureus using both an electrostatic approach with PLL and a targeted approach with an antibody for protein A, which is present in the cell wall. 283 PDT was demonstrated at standard antimicrobial fluence rates of up to 55.2 J cm \u22122 , with cell reduction of about 3 orders of magnitude observed and more selectivity imparted through the use of anti-protein A for targeting. Since then, PDT has been applied as a therapeutic against cancer cells. The buckyball C 60 has been attached to CPMV and Q\u03b2 to improve solubilization of the photosensitizer, 94, 284 and to aid in delivery to and treatment of PC-3 prostate cancer cells. 284 Internal conjugation of porphyrins to MS2 combined with external display of aptamers for protein tyrosine kinase 7 receptors on Jurkat leukemia T cells has been established for selective killing of Jurkat cells when cultured with erythrocytes after 20 min of illumination at 415 nm. 285 Additionally, as a proof-of-concept study, glycan decoration of Q\u03b2 was shown to be an effective strategy for targeting cells bearing CD22 receptors that are involved in the regulation of B cells, and this was illustrated with the delivery of metalloporphyrins for specific elimination of CD22positive cells. 286 To move toward clinical application of PDT, use of photosensizers that can be excited in the NIR range would be more ideal for better tissue penetration.

Methods for conjugation have also been recently established for spheres made from thermal transitioning of TMV and utilized for the loading of doxorubicin, which was found to be effective for chemotherapeutic delivery to breast cancer cells. 292 Besides chemical conjugation, Dox can be loaded by infusion into RCNMV and incorporated into a fibrous matrix made up of polylactic acid (PLA) and polyethylene oxide (PEO) nanofibers. 113 The combination of the two systems could be tailored to result in either a two-phase release profile or a first order release profile, depending on whether the virus was co-spun with the fibers or the matrix immersed in the virus solution after electrospinning, respectively.",

However, different targeting strategies were used, making it difficult to draw conclusions as to the relative efficacy of the two drugs. Another study assessed the range of therapeutic cargo that could be encapsulated within MS2, including doxorubicin, cisplatin, and 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), along with ricin toxin A-chain (RTA). 277 Using SP94-targeted formulations that bind to Hep3B hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells with 10 4 -fold higher avidity compared to other cell types, the encapsulation of Dox individually was shown to be more effective than free Dox, while encapsulation of a cocktail comprised of all three chemotherapeutics was even more effective, with an IC 50 concentration below 1 nM.

The highly potent platinum DNA-binding drug phenanthriplatin was introduced within the carrier and shown to be released under acidic conditions. When TMV delivery of phenanthriplatin was applied in a triple negative breast cancer mouse xenograft model, much greater efficacy was observed for TMVphenanthriplatin compared to free drug or clinically used cisplatin controls, with 4-fold smaller tumor growth. This is likely due to better transport of the drug to the tumor cells with the nanocarrier. The combination of TMV and phenanthriplatin shows potential for bringing an effective new chemotherapy into the clinic, but virus-based nanoparticle drug delivery is a quickly growing field, and it is expected that progression toward other clinical applications is also fast approaching.",

Coating of TMV with different cell binding motifs derived from integrin binding matrix proteins collagen and fibronectin onto a high binding plate demonstrated that the peptide sequence displayed plays a role in cell adhesion and morphology. 306 While cells cultured on TMV with RGD motifs formed filopodial extensions, they adhered more weakly compared to cells that remained rounded when cultured on TMV displaying P15, a collagen I mimetic sequence. For screening the influence of various biochemical cues on cell proliferation and morphology, phage-chips have been constructed such that arrays of M13 nanofibers labeled with various peptides or growth factors and self-assembled on gold chips can be monitored using surface plasmon resonance (SPR) spectroscopy for their effect on cultured cells. 307 Further progression toward mimicking the ECM looked at synthesizing fibrous matrices through electrospinning of RGD-modified viruses with polymers. 308, 309 Nanofibers made up of TMV with polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) 308 and M13 with poly(lactic-coglycolic acid) (PLGA) 309 formed biodegradable fibrous matrices that enhanced cell adhesion, proliferation, and spreading of baby hamster kidney (BHK) and fibroblast cells, respectively, compared to scaffolds of the polymers alone.",

In an early study, M13 with RGD motifs was self-assembled into parallel arrangements through slow drying or dragging methods to form thin films on which oriented growth of NIH-3T3 and Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells were achieved, with the shear method producing the most consistent results. 310 Investigation of the ECM deposited by cells cultured on these films revealed correlation between cellular alignment and the orientation of fibronectin and collagen I deposition. 311 NIH-3T3 fibroblasts produced more ECM proteins, which resulted in more of a tendency to deviate from the original patterning, and thus the fibroblasts displayed reduced alignment over time as well as when compared with less ECM-producing BHK cells. Other methods for the alignment of viral nanorods, and subsequently cells, include shearing force from fluid flow through glass capillaries 312, 313 and microcontact printing combined with dip-coating. 314 Myogenic differentiation of myoblast cells can be achieved through exposure to differentiation media after oriented cell growth. 313 In addition to forming 2D films, fabrication of 3D aligned fibers is possible based on interfacial polyionic complexation, which was demonstrated by injecting negatively charged, RGD-labeled M13 phage into a solution of cationic polymers PEI, PLL, and chitosan. 315 NIH-3T3 fibroblast cells encapsulated through co-injection with the phage solution grew well within the fibers and after seven days began to spread along the matrix within the phage fibers, demonstrating the potential of virus scaffolds for cell growth and remodeling. 3D tissue cultures have also been formed through treatment of cells with hydrogels that can then be magnetically levitated, and cell clustering could be controlled by the magnetic field profiles of the magnets used. 316 Hydrogels were fabricated through simple combination of solutions of gold nanoparticles with M13 displaying RGD, 317, 318 with the additional inclusion of magnetic iron oxide nanoparticles for levitation. The 3D cell cultures were able to recapitulate in vivo behavior, as observed by similar protein expression patterns as well as infiltration of highly invasive glioblastoma cells when co-cultured with astrocytes.",

In addition to cell binding motifs, immobilization of growth factors to phages has been demonstrated to retain bioactivity, with bFGF shown to promote NPC proliferation and NGF leading to greater neural differentiation. 321 Furthermore, a recent study demonstrated that electroactivity could also be used to augment neural tissue regeneration. 322 TMV that was modified with polyaniline and further doped with poly(styrenesulfonate) (PSS) was aligned by flow through capillary tubes and shown to increase the percentage of cells with neurite outgrowths as well as the percentage of cells with bipolar morphology.",

            "text": "Virus scaffolds are not limited to neural differentiation, and by far the most extensive research has been performed in osteogenic differentiation. An early study looked at osteoblast differentiation of bone marrow stromal cells on icosahedral turnip yellow mosaic virus (TYMV). 323 Osteocalcin gene expression and onset of mineralization were found 7 days earlier for cells grown on TYMV-coated substrates compared to tissue culture plastic when cultured in osteogenic media, indicating the nanotopology imparted by the TYMV supports osteogenic differentiation. Similar data was found for substrates coated with rodshaped TMV, with further DNA microarray data showing differential expression in a large panel of genes and bone morphogenetic protein 2 (BMP2) in particular found to be especially important in osteogenic differentiation in this manner. 324 There was a rapid onset in BMP2 gene and protein expression, and this enhancement was only found when TMV was coated on the substrate and not when added to the cell media, verifying the role of nanotopology. 325 Additional conjugation of phosphate groups to the exterior of TMV further boosted differentiation by aiding in the incorporation of calcium and consequently highly enriched mineralization of the ECM. 326 A related strategy for mineralization utilized genetic engineering to display highly negatively charged E 8 peptides on M13 phage, which could then be self-assembled into nanofibers in the presence of calcium ions and led to hydroxyapatite formation with the addition of phosphate ions. 327 The effect of multivalent presentation of various ligands has also been studied, and rapid differentiation and nodule formation was observed for substrates with TMV coated with RGD after only 2 days in serum-free osteogenic media. 328 While this was found for TMV genetically engineered to display RGD, TMV chemically conjugated to RGD also enhanced bone differentiation. 329 In the absence of osteogenic supplements, presentation of RGD with the addition of synergy peptide PHSRN on M13 was actually found to be sufficient to induce osteoblastic differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs). 330 Display of DGEA peptide derived from collagen. 331 along with PDPLEPRREVCE derived from osteocalcin and YGFGG derived from osteogenic growth peptide 332 on M13 have also been shown to accelerate proliferation and differentiation of MSCs into osteoblasts. M13 is capable of selfassembly into long-range ordered morphologies using dip-coating methods, forming nematic orthogonal twists, cholesteric helical ribbons, and smectic helicolidal nanofilaments based on conditions such as phage concentration and pulling speed. 333 Films formed using RGD and EEEE peptide-labeled phages could be used to control both soft and hard tissue formation, with smectic hilcolidal nanofilament surfaces in particular demonstrated to form enamel-like composites when treated with calcium and phosphate ions. Moving toward 3D scaffolds, TMV-RGD was incorporated within porous alginate hydrogels and resultantly produced greater cell attachment and enhanced osteogenic differentiation. 83 3D printed scaffolds composed of hydroxyapatite and \u03b2-tricalcium phosphate is another approach, and introduction of M13-RGD combined with chitosan within the scaffold pore not only led to osteogenesis but also angiogenesis, with inclusion of VEGF further enhancing the effect (Figure 13) . 334 A new direction in this area is the incorporation of gene delivery within tissue engineering constructs. Mutant FLAG-tagged AAV was tethered to scaffolds made up of PLGA and gelatin sponge through anti-FLAG antibodies, and virus transduction was observed when HeLa cells were seeded onto the scaffold, both in vitro and when implanted in vivo into nude mice. 335 Furthermore, transduction was observed for cells cultured on drop-cast films consisting of hybrid phages constructed from the combination of M13-RGD phage with an AAV-derived gene cassette. 336 While still in its early stages, with further developments, tissue regeneration and reprogramming of cellular defects could be made possible through the combination of tissue engineering and gene delivery.",

            "text": "Based on the original research in which f1 phage was studied, 338 E. coli filamentous bacteriophages, which include f1, fd, and M13, are some of the more common platforms utilized for phage display. The general structure of filamentous phages is shown in Figure  14 , 344 which illustrates how the phages are comprised of a number of minor and major coat proteins. Out of these, the pIII and pVIII proteins are what are usually utilized for the display of foreign proteins, 345 likely due to greater accessibility at the tip and sides, respectively, but display with pVI, 346 pVII, 347, 348 and pIX 348 have also been successfully implemented. In brief, phage display utilizes the genetic programming of the phage coat proteins; insertion of random sequences of DNA within the protein genes can be used to form a library of phages with billions of different foreign peptides or proteins presented. 342 After several rounds of panning and amplification to isolate the specific phages that bind to a target, the identity of the binding peptides or proteins displayed can be determined through sequencing. Whereas insertions at pVIII are limited to around 9-mers, 349 cyclic phage libraries 350 and libraries displaying sequences of up to 38 random residues on pIII are possible. 351 Phage display is not only limited to filamentous phages, as libraries based on other phages such as lambda and T7 are also possible. 352, 353 Another alternative that has proven useful in phage display is the use of phagemids. 354 Phagemids typically contain traditional plasmid aspects, with a plasmid replication origin, restriction enzyme recognition sites, and an antibiotic selection marker, as well as phage aspects, including a phage origin of replication and a gene for pIII fused to any protein of interest (Figure 15 ). 355 By co-infection with a helper phage to supply other structural proteins required for phage formation, complete virions assembled around phagemid DNA can be recovered. The advantages of using phagemids include ease of cloning and recombination, more efficient transformation, a smaller genome for incorporation of larger foreign genes, and greater genetic stability over multiple rounds of propagation. 354 Phage and phagemid display technology have given rise to numerous opportunities for the isolation of protein-based ligands for a range of applications. In its simplest form, screening can be performed in vitro, where the target of interest is immobilized on a solid support.",

            "text": "Using this technique, peptides have been identified that are specific for targets that include inorganic materials such as hydroxyapatite, 356 silver, 357 and quantum dots, 13 as well as organic materials such as microtubules, 358 fibrin, 359 and integrins. 360 As some examples, these binding peptides can be used for biomineralization for formation of hard tissue 356 as well as for nucleation, growth, and patterning of metals. 357 It should be noted that many of the examples found in other sections that involve mineralization rely on the use of metal binding peptides for nucleation. Additionally, peptides can be selected that not only bind but also obstruct the function of its targets, such as demonstrated with peptides identified for inhibition of proteases such as human neutrophil elastase, 361 as well as cancer-associated matrix metalloproteinases. 362 The versatility of the technology can be expanded beyond peptide identification. For example, phage libraries can be designed for the display Fab antigen-binding fragments and scFvs, 339 which has implications for identification of antibodies for bioassays as well as immunotherapy. Some examples include the construction of a Fab phage display library for the isolation of antibodies specific to human prostate cancer cells 363 and the generation and identification of scFv antibodies that recognize a marker of angiogenesis, VEGFR-3. 364 Besides Fabs and scFvs, an alternative method of display where the antibody heavy-and light-chain variable regions were separately displayed on pVII and pIX, respectively, was demonstrated to effectively drive the formation of functional Fv heterodimers, which may have greater affinity and stability compared to scFvs. 365 Enzymes and their substrates can also be displayed on phages, either independently or together on a single particle, in order to screen for functional enzyme catalysts. 366 Co-presentation of the enzyme and substrate can be achieved using an intervening linker between the two, and then active enzymes can be selected for by panning for product formation. 367 Aside from immobilization of isolated targets on a surface, selection methods have also been demonstrated with cultured cells, as well as ex vivo and in vivo, to select for cell binding peptides. 343 Using panning against cell lines of various types, such as fibroblasts and myoblasts, 368 peptides with high cellular specificity can be identified. In this manner, peptides have been isolated that have specificity for endothelial cells associated with atherosclerosis, 369 breast cancer cells, 370 hepatocellular carcinoma cells, 371 melanoma cells, 372 and ovarian cells, 373 among others. Ex vivo panning works similarly, except the library is screened against cells or tumor masses that have been isolated, and binding peptides have been identified for a range of cell types that include neuroblastoma cells, 374 islet cells, 375 and colonic adenoma cells. 376 In vivo phage display is particularly noteworthy and lends itself to many different applications. For example, peptides targeting specific organs can be examined using in vivo screening of random peptides in a mouse model. 377 After multiple rounds of phage administration, isolation, and amplification, peptides that localize to the brain and kidney were identified. Furthermore, attachment of brain targeting peptides to fixed red blood cells resulted in the accumulation of the cells in the brain at a greater extent than the kidneys. Another investigation that also studied kidney targeting in vivo found that peptide specificity could be used for the tailoring of pharmacokinetics. 378 By directing clearance toward the kidneys and away from the reticuloendothelial system, more rapid clearance could be achieved. In vivo screening has also been applied in humans for the mapping of unique zip codes lining the vasculature. 379 Unique tripeptide motifs specific for various regions around the body were identified after biopsies of the bone marrow, fat tissue, skeletal muscle, prostate, skin, and liver were performed, which could be utilized toward the creation of a map of molecular signatures along the human vasculature.",

The first probe tends to also be an antibody with specificity for the target, but phage display has introduced the opportunity for using peptides for target recognition. For example, phages decorated with peptides isolated from phage display have been used in ELISAs for the detection of anthrax spores 383 and the surface antigen of HBV. 384 For an alternative to the presentation of peptides on viruses, antibodies can also be presented on the viral scaffold for multivalent detection, and the previous section discussed how phage display and genetic engineering could be used for the display of antibodies and fragments thereof. As another approach, it was recently demonstrated that functionalization of PVX-based nanoparticles with protein A fragments can be used to display whole antibody molecules by using protein A's property of binding to the Fc region of the heavy chain of IgGs. 85 The PVX particles could then be used as a plug-and-play system for the display of a variety of antibodies, with a level of orientational control not achievable with chemical conjugation.",

HRP is a popular enzyme for ELISAs due to its ability to convert chromogenic substrates into colored products and chemiluminescent substrates into fluorescent products. 382 Immobilization of HRP, as well as glucose oxidase (GOX), has been explored using CPMV 386 and TMV 387 platforms. While the addition of sensing molecules to the virions will be required for their use in ELISAs, the display of the enzymes themselves on the particles can be directly used for sensing. GOX catalyzes the oxidation of glucose and concurrently generates hydrogen peroxide, which can then be reduced to water by HRP in the presence of a substrate. Therefore, the two enzymes can be coupled to form a glucose sensing system, where HRP substrate conversion can be used for detection. In fact, the TMV nanorods resulted in up to 45-fold higher substrate conversion rates than control samples with the same input of enzymes, which could be due to a combination of a greater surface area and better steric accessibility of the presented enzymes. This is only one example of the potential of enzyme-based sensors, and the immobilization of enzymes that catalyze other reactions could also be considered for the creation of sensitive biosensors.",

            "text": "Optical sensors also encompass those that utilize SPR for detection. For example, LbL assembly of cationic M13 with anionic gold nanoparticles resulted in the development of an SPR spectrum that was sensitive to humidity. 392 It is therefore possible to utilize electrostatic assembly to integrate viruses in humidity sensing devices. SPR has also been applied as sensors for immunoassays, such as exemplified by the detection of the food-borne bacterium Listeria monocytogenes using a gold SPR sensor chip. 393 M13 displaying an scFv antibody recognizing L. monocytogenes cells was immobilized on the sensor chip before injection of samples for measurement. The change in resonance due to the binding of cells allowed for specific detection down to levels of around 2 \u00d7 10 6 cfu/mL. Surface enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) has been another approach that has been considered for sensing. 394 It relies on signal enhancement of the Raman signal when in close proximity to the surface of a noble metal. Due to the sensitivity of the technique and the unique signature of various reporters, SERS is a promising technique for multiplexed analysis. M13 phage, selected by phage display for binding to the model rabbit anti-goat IgG antigen, was labeled with Cy3 Raman reporters that were conjugated to Au@Ag core-shell nanoparticles. Due to a high surface area for reporter presentation, the resultant M13 construct imparted an exponential increase in the Raman intensity observed when compared to similarly labeled antibodies against the model antigen. M13 has also been applied in a colorimetric sensor that was based on changes in the modulation of its self-assembled structure, but this application is discussed in more detail in Section 4.3.1. 395 Besides optical sensing, viruses have also found application in electrochemical sensing. The three different examples we will highlight involve electrochemical impedance spectroscopy 396 and amperometry 397, 398 for measurements. In the first example, a gold electrode surface on which a M13 monolayer was attached was used for the detection of an antibody as well as prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA), a marker of prostate cancer. 396 The resistive component of the impedance, Z Re , measured from 2 to 500 kHz, increased upon analyte binding, and measurement of this characteristic could be used for highly specific detection of down to concentrations of around 100 nM. In the next example, a thin film of TMV conjugated with electroactive oligoaniline was used for the detection of volatile organic compounds, specifically methanol and ethanol. 397 The response current was measured from the thin film sensor, and there was a high response observed in the presence of ethanol and methanol over what was observed for acetonitrile, isobutyl alcohol, tetrahydrofuran, toluene, and acetone. Moreover, the current measurements exhibited reproducibility as well as a quick response time for both absorption and desorption of the compounds. Finally, the last example involves the application of a solution of TMV displaying binding peptides for TNT for in-solution sensing of the molecule. 398 As a result of binding of TNT to TMV, the diffusion coefficient of the TNT was reduced and a differential Faradaic current signature of the electroactive compound was caused. The differential current was proportional to TNT concentration and therefore could be used for TNT sensing. Detection using this method is not limited to just TNT and can be expanded to other relatively small electroactive species.",

In the original area of HIV detection, Armored RNA was expanded beyond RT-PCR assays to the branched DNA (bDNA) assay, which provides a reliable method for quantification of HIV-1 RNA but requires a longer 3 kb RNA control. 414 The standard strategy for RNA encapsulation within MS2 is limited to only around 2 kb, but increasing the packaging efficiency to overcome this limit can be achieved through incorporating more translational repressor stem-loops within the RNA, which specifically interact with the MS2 capsid and trigger the self-assembly of the viral shell around the cargo. 415 In such a manner, Armored RNA containing the longer HIV pol gene was successfully synthesized and performed reliably as a standard for the bDNA assay. 414 HCV Armored RNA has also been developed for RT-PCR and bDNA assays, and additional work demonstrated its applicability in genotyping assays as well, allowing the distinction of a specific subtype of HCV. 404 For real-time RT-PCR reactions, false negatives could occur when a singleplex primer/probe assay is used since mismatches with a set of primers could exist in a number of samples, thus dual-specific RNA controls in duplex assays were tested, and resultant enhancement in the sensitivity of detection was found compared to monospecific assays. 405, 416 Beyond controls for the detection of single virus types, Armored RNA chimeras have also been created. 407, 417 In one study, a chimeric RNA sequence was derived from a mix of gene fragments from HCV, HIV-1, SARS coronavirus 1, and SARS coronavirus 2. 417 They were able to package the fairly large 1.2 kb RNA sequence within MS2 and demonstrate its versatility as a control for the multiple different RT-PCR assays for the detection of each individual virus. In another study, RNA fragments from influenza A, influenza B, and SARS viruses were spliced together into one fragment in order to create a single control for the simultaneous testing of these common respiratory viruses that may result in similar clinical symptoms. 407 Using multiplex RT-PCR for the three viruses with different reporter dyes, simultaneous amplification and detection could be achieved with a highly sensitive detection limit of 10 1 copies/\u03bcl of the Armored RNA for all the viruses.",

Early work in this area utilized lambda and filamentous fd phages for DNA packaging, and greater stability of the DNA was observed. [418] [419] [420] Containment of control dsDNA within lambda phage conferred resistance to DNase digestion, with reliable amplification in PCR assays for HBV 418, 419 and cytomegalovirus. 418 When stored in SM buffer, the protected DNA was stable for at least a few months, but stability for more than 5 days in plasma at room temperature could not be achieved, which may be a result of greater susceptibility of lambda to plasma proteases compared to MS2. 418, 419 For ssDNA, encapsulation in fd phage was demonstrated with DNA taken from parvovirus B19. 420 The resultant controls were resistant to nuclease degradation and performed similarly to the native virus in PCR assays, with very similar growth curves observed. Furthermore, the constructs remained stable at both 37\u00b0C and 45\u00b0C when diluted in human plasma for periods of at least 4 weeks. More recently, a return to the Armored RNA roots was taken with the demonstration of encapsulation of dsDNA in MS2, which resulted in extra stability over lambda as was found for fd phage but without being limited to ssDNA. 421 By conjugating sulfhydryl-modified DNA sequences of interest to an amine-modified stem-loop DNA structure, assembly of dissociated MS2 CPs could then be triggered around the stem-loops to form Armored DNA. Using this strategy, the formation of MS2 capsids packaging HBV and HPV DNA sequences with lengths ranging from 1.3 to 6.5 kb was accomplished, which is astonishing given that the genome of MS2 is only 3.5 kb. The Armored DNA controls performed well in PCR and genotyping assays, and storage in newborn calf serum even after 6 months at 4 \u00b0C was shown to not affect performance.",

For example, recombinant RNA particles based on CPMV can also be utilized as internal controls for RT-PCR assays. 422 To produce these particles, a cDNA clone was engineered to contain sequences for the desired control RNA alongside RNA-2 of CPMV, which codes for its coat and movement proteins. In the proof-of-concept study, two sequences from FMDV and one from swine vesicular disease virus (SVDV) were cloned together into the cassette. Using agroinfiltration of cowpea plants with the combination of this plasmid along with another plasmid for RNA-1 of CPMV, which is responsible for its replication and proteolytic processing, recombinant CPMV particles were propagated in and recovered from their host plant. The CPMV component containing RNA-2 was separated from the RNA-1 component using a Nycodenz density gradient, resulting in a non-infectious construct due to its reliance on RNA-1 for replication. The particles performed well as positive controls for the detection of both FMDV and SVDV. Additionally, they were resistant to RNase and performed reliably even after 33 days storage in a 10% suspension of bovine epithelium at room temperature. This method may provide a low cost alternative to Armored RNA, while maintaining the advantages of stability and rapid production.",

The EBOV sequence was taken from a region in the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase gene (L-gene) that showed homology between all published EBOV sequences. Detection of both the EBOV and TMV sequences was accomplished using multiplex RT-PCR with the EBOV-TMV particle. Aside from the EBOV primer binding sites, the EBOV sequence was scrambled, therefore posing no threat of infection. Overall, EBOV-TMV is a scalable construct that could be easily adapted as a control for EBOV diagnostics, and the technology could be further applied for mimicking other filamentous viruses.",

Resultantly, product accumulation and delayed loss of fluorescence was observed with the spatially constrained HRP. Further investigation with the confinement of the enzyme Pseudozyma antartica lipase B (PalB) within CCMV utilized a heterodimeric coiled-coil linker to first attach PalB to CP subunits before assembly. 426 Through varying the ratio of CP with and without PalB during assembly, the average number of encapsulated enzymes could be controlled. Encapsulated PalB had a higher activity compared to non-encapsulated PalB, which was hypothesized to be due to a higher enzyme concentration when considering just the capsid alone. Additionally, there was no effect on the reaction velocity when varying the number of encapsulated enzymes between one and four PalB per capsid, which is likely due the presence of generally only one substrate molecule per capsid, making more than one enzyme unnecessary for substrate conversion.",

This strategy resulted in up to 18 enzymes encapsulated within the particle. The enzymes remained active after encapsulation, and the capsid was found to offer some protection against thermal degradation, protease digestion, as well as hydrophobic adsorption. A one-pot expressionassembly approach has also been utilized for enzyme tethering within P22, with initial studies investigating programmed encapsulation of alcohol dehydrogenase D (AdhD) 428 and homotetrameric \u03b2-glycosidase enzyme CelB 429 using plasmids harboring both genes for the P22 CP and for its scaffold protein (SP) fused to the enzyme of interest. SPs associate with the interior of the P22 capsid in such a way that the enzymes are consequently encapsulated during expression and assembly of the proteins in E. coli. AdhD encapsulated in P22 was less active due to enzyme crowding effects but overall had a similar catalytic efficiency and did not exhibit substrate inhibition, unlike free AdhD. 428 With encapsulation of CelB, which is only active in its tetrameric form, incorporation of multimeric enzymes in P22 was demonstrated. 429 Surprisingly, unlike AdhD encapsulated CelB did not result in loss in activity or change in substrate affinity. Additionally, embedding the encapsulated CelB in an acrylamide gel and dehydrating and rehydrating the gel resulted in over 60% retention in activity, which could be attributed to substrate diffusion limitations, therefore presenting the utility of P22 nanoreactors for enzyme immobilization applications.",

Not unexpectedly, while introduction of negative charge had an inhibitory effect, additional positive charge resulted in greater catalysis of the negatively charged phosphatase substrate. Therefore, engineering of nanoreactors can be used to control the flux and extent of reaction. Another benefit of nanoreactors, also seen above with PepE, is the bestowment of stabilization. As an additional example, encapsulation within P22 of phosphotriesterase, which has low heat tolerance and is prone to hydrolysis, yielded protection from proteases and desiccation as well as thermal stability with activity even at 60\u00b0C, making it a more practical option as an enzyme for combatting various harmful insecticides and nerve agents. 431 The strategy for sequestration of enzymes within P22 during expression is also valuable for the recovery of otherwise insoluble proteins. 432 Some recombinant proteins are trafficked to inclusion bodies during production in E. coli, making recovery difficult. \u03b1-galactosidase (GalA) is one such protein that was studied, and encapsulation within P22 was shown to allow for successful rescue of properly folded GalA.

For example, it was determined that the immobilization of cytochrome P450 (CYP450) inside P22 could be used for its stabilization and delivery to human cervix carcinoma cells with retention of substrate conversion activity, which could be further exploited for enzymatic prodrug therapies. 132 In addition, encapsulation of NADH oxidase, which predominantly reduces oxygen to hydrogen peroxide, was demonstrated as a method for bacterial growth inhibition by triggering oxidative damage in E. coli cultures. 433 Notably, a recent breakthrough in nanoreactor technology is its use for the catalysis of hydrogen production. 434 Sequestration of oxygentolerant nickel-iron (NiFe)-hydrogenase in P22 provided greater stability for the hydrogenase and resultantly, a greater than 100-fold increase in proton reduction activity over the free enzyme was observed. With the scalable production of encapsulated hydrogenase through simple fermentation, cheap and sustainable clean fuel production can be realized.",

Assessment of enzyme cascade encapsulation was evaluated with the tetrameric CelB, the monomeric ATPdependent galactokinase (GALK), and the dimeric ADP-dependent glucokinase (GLUK), which processes lactose into galactose and glucose, phosphorylates galactose to form galactose-1-phosphate, and phosphorylates glucose to glucose-6-phosphate, respectively (Figure 19 ). Using multienzyme GLUK-CelBSP and GALK-GLUK-CelB-SP fusions, coencapsulation of two-and three-enzyme cascades within P22 was achieved. When compared to a 1:1 mixture of individually encapsulated CelB-P22 and GLUK-P22 controls, GLUK-CelB-P22 showed greater enzymatic conversion under inhibitory conditions for CelB. GALK-GLUK-CelB-P22 additionally showed a greater than 2-fold faster turnover rate than GLUK-CelB-P22, suggesting all three proteins assembled property into their active forms and were successfully encapsulated. Therefore, enzyme assemblies are of import in facilitating the construction of complex metabolic systems.",

Since their natural hosts for infection are plants, at first glance it appears counterintuitive to apply such nanoparticles for this particular application. However, the pioneering study utilized RCNMV for combatting parasitic root nematode infections and demonstrated that such particles have better mobility in the soil, therefore improving the bioavailability of the abamectin pesticide for nematode control. 112 Using ligand gating for infusion (see Section 3.3), the neutrally charged pesticide could be loaded within RCNMV. In such a manner, the abamectin cargo is protected against oxidation and can be released over time. Encapsulated and free abamectin showed similar efficacies in liquid nematode cultures, but when tested on infected tomato seedlings, the viral delivery of abamectin resulted in healthier root growth and reduced root galling compared to abamectin alone. These results have important implications for the agricultural industry, where parasitic nematodes have resulted in astronomical costs on the order of $118 billion worldwide due to crop damage, 435 and future considerations with noninfectious VLPs could further refine this strategy of using the naturally evolved mechanisms of such viruses for cargo delivery to plants.",

The utilization of plants as a production platform has undergone rapid growth, and cost-effective, highly scalable, and safe production of protein pharmaceuticals with post-translational modifications can now be achieved using plant viral vectors. 436, 437 Due to these advantages in cost and production, plant systems offer the potential for rapid pharmaceutical development, especially for more impoverished areas.",

            "text": "One of the first examples of transfecting plants with viral vectors that demonstrated rapid production of a protein relevant to pharmaceutics utilized an expression vector based on TMV. 438 High level heterologous expression of biologically active \u03b1-trichosanthin, which can inhibit HIV replication in vitro, was achieved through insertion of the gene into a TMV plasmid. By controlling its transcription using a subgenomic promoter, regulation of the expression of the specific gene could be achieved. Further research of such N. benthamianabased expression systems found that suppression of post-transcriptional gene silencing (PTGS), the plant's adaptive immune system, resulted in enhanced efficiency and was possible through co-expression of the P19 protein of tomato bushy stunt virus (TBSV). 439 In parallel, the development of the magnICON \"deconstructed\" TMV vector system 440 has resulted in advancements in the production capacity without need for PTGS suppression. 441 The magnICON system involves engineering DNA modules for replication, the gene of interest, and recombination, with the advantage of being easily modifiable using Gateway technology, a universal system for cloning. The modules are then delivered to plants by Agrobacterium and result in transient gene expression and production of viral RNA replicons that can replicate autonomously. 440 Furthermore, through \"magnifection,\" or weak vacuum infiltration of the plants immersed in the Agrobacterium suspension, transfection at a large scale can be quickly achieved without the need of the CP gene or the wait for systemic plant movement. 442 A large variety of biologically relevant pharmaceutics have been produced using magnICON, including VLP vaccines, 443, 444 antibodies, 445, 446 plague antigens, 447 cytokines, 448 and growth hormones. 449 The TMV RNA-based overexpression (TRBO) vector is another replicon system that has been developed and has shown promise for high-level protein expression, with greater yields than demonstrated with the aforementioned P19-enhanced transient expression ( Figure  20) . 450 Essentially, the TRBO vector is a 35S promoter-driven TMV expression vector with the CP gene removed. The CP deletion resulted in a higher efficiency of recombinant protein expression, which was demonstrated for a range of proteins, including GFP, adenosine kinase, the 10 th domain from human fibronectin, and some proteinases. Another study also demonstrated the usefulness of the TRBO vector for production of R8, a chimeric allergen derived from dust mites that could be applied for asthma diagnosis or immunotherapy. 451 Similar expression systems have been derived from plasmids based on PVX and other potexviruses. Complete PVX constructs can be used for the expression of recombinant proteins alongside PVX CPs through insertion of an internal ribosome entry site, which allows for initiation of translation in the middle of an mRNA, between the two genes. 452 Similar constructs that instead have an intervening FMDV 2A cleavage sequence can be used to create proteins expressed as a fusion to the CP. 453 While larger inserts tend to result in genetic instability and loss of the gene of interest, 454 the combination of introducing a heterologous subgenomic promoter from bamboo mosaic virus and deleting a portion at the N-terminus of the CP was found to be a successful strategy to increase transgene expression stability. 455 Deconstructed vectors have also been used for PVX-based expression systems. For example, through replacement of the CP gene and the triple gene block (TGB) that encodes movement proteins, efficient production of the gene insert can be achieved. 456 Suppression of PTGS helped to improve yields, with transient co-expression of P19 from TBSV or HC-Pro from tobacco etch virus (TEV) resulting in a 44% and 83% increase in gene expression, respectively. 457 Amplicon-plus Targeting Technology utilizes this benefit of gene silencing suppression to enhance production. 458 This technology involves using a transgenic TEV-B tobacco line that expresses the suppressor gene that is then infected with a PVX amplicon containing the gene of interest. Successful production of a highly labile L1 vaccine protein from canine oral papillomavirus was achieved when this system was used for the expression of the recombinant protein fused to a chloroplast targeting peptide. Coupling of PVX and TMV viral vector systems has also been evaluated and was demonstrated to be a useful approach for resolving complications from competition between multiple replicons in the same cells. 446 With the noncompetitive viral systems, expression of assembled oligomeric proteins can be accomplished, such as for construction of full-length IgG with its heavy and light chains. 445, 446 Some other examples of potexvirus vectors include vectors based on plantago asiatica mosaic virus (PlAMV) 459 and foxtail mosaic virus (FoMV). 460 The recombinant PlAMV vector was found to have greater genetic stability and longer retention of the inserted gene compared to PVX, likely due to stronger RNA silencing suppression activity found from the first movement protein in its TGB. 459 On the other hand, the FoMV-based FECT vector series utilized deconstructed plasmids in which the CP and TGB were deleted and required co-expression of the P19 suppressor of PTGS. 460 Moving on to other systems, CPMV-based expression systems have also shown great versatility for the enhanced expression of a large range of proteins, including antibodies, 461 human gastric lipase, 462 and VLP vaccines (such as BTV VLPs discussed in Section 4.1.3). 230 CPMV is a bipartite virus with RNA-1 providing replication and protein processing capabilities and RNA-2 coding for movement and coat proteins. By altering the shorter RNA-2 through removal of the movement and coat proteins and appending the gene of interest, expression of foreign genes can be achieved through inoculation of plants with constructs of both RNA-1 and the modified RNA-2. 463, 464 Agroinfiltration of just the RNA-2 construct with the TBSV P19 suppressor of silencing was found to overcome the necessity for RNA-1, and additional elimination of the second start codon in the 5' untranslated region (UTR) of RNA-2, located at position 161, resulted in hypertranslation of the downstream protein, likely due to AUG 161 being inhibitory for overall translation. 465 With this discovery, high protein expression could be achieved without restrictions on insert size and without the need for RNA-dependent RNA polymerases.",

Medicago Inc. uses CPMV-HT for its large-scale production of enveloped influenza H5 VLPs, with observed budding from the plasma membrane resulting in envelopment and similar structural characteristics to influenza viral particles. 467 eCPMV can also be produced using the pEAQ system, where the necessary proteins for CPMV formation, namely its VP60 CP precursor and a 24K proteinase, could either be expressed from the same vector or from two CPMV-HT vectors to form the mature eCPMV particle devoid of any nucleic acid encapsulated. 468 Since the pEAQ vector is nonreplicative, levels of expression of multiple proteins can be controlled through co-infiltration of appropriate concentrations of the expression vectors. In such a manner more complex VLPs such as BTV VLPs consisting of up to four different proteins can be assembled. 230 Our last examples of plant viral expression vectors come from geminiviruses, which are small ssDNA viruses with twinned capsid morphology. The in-plant activation (INPACT) expression platform is notable for its use of a split-gene cassette in stably transformed plants. 469, 470 The INPACT cassette is based on a deconstructed tobacco yellow dwarf virus (TYDV) genome and consists of two components: (1) the gene of interest split into two exons with flanking large intergenic regions (LIRs) and a small intergenic region (SIR) in between, and (2) Rep and RepA activator genes required for replication and activation of recombinant protein production that are inducible by ethanol. Binding of Rep to a site within the LIR initiates rolling circle replication of the replicon system. With ethanol induction, protein production is separate from plant growth, allowing high levels of protein expression that could be cytotoxic or inhibit plant development.",

The system resulted in noncompeting replicon amplification and protein expression, with efficient assembly of the IgG tetramer. As a final example, pRIC is a similar BeYDV-derived autonomously replicating vector 472 that presented an advancement to a previous high expressing but non-replicating pTRAc cassette. 473 The pRIC replicon gene vector was created by the addition of the SIR, LIR, and Rep/RepA genes and resulted in gene amplification up to 2 orders of magnitude and up to 7-fold greater production of HPV-16 major CP L1 and HIV-1C p24 subunit vaccine antigens compared to pTRAc. 472 There are clearly many options for quick and high yielding recombinant protein production in plants. Although MagnICON has been used widely in the past, its utilization of multiple modules likely detracts from its efficiency, and the development of other systems using single constructs may lead to greater popularity. The main applications for plant-based production have been for antibody and vaccine production, but pharmaceutical proteins of all types can also be produced with the above techniques.",

            "text": "The high aspect ratio structures formed by TMV and phages M13 and fd have also long been used to produce and study liquid crystalline arrangements, which may find applications in next-generation electronic displays. To yield liquid crystalline assemblies, in-solution mixing protocols have been developed to drive the alignment and spatial organization of the proteinaceous building blocks. A classical approach makes use of concentration gradients such that a nematic liquid crystalline phase is generated at a critical concentration. 516 The onset of ordering can be explained by the Onsager theory for isotropic-nematic phase transition, which states that there is competition between translational and orientational entropy, leading to higher densities favoring the nematic phase in order to confer greater translational entropy. 517, 518 Filamentous viruses are able to form the same mesophases exhibited by other rod-shaped liquid crystal materials: nematic, cholesteric, smectic A, and smectic C, and they can exist interchangeably. 477, 519 For example, M13 phage-based liquid crystals present a nematic phase at low concentrations. As the concentration increases, a cholesteric liquid crystalline phase is observed. Finally, at high concentrations, the system exhibits a smectic liquid crystalline phase. Furthermore, based on the anisotropic nature of the filamentous viruses, external stimuli such as electric and magnetic fields can be applied to tune the ordering, therefore allowing alignment of the whole sample. 13, 520, 521 Ordering can also be achieved at liquid/liquid and liquid/solid interfaces. For instance, when the oil/water interface between perfluorodecalin and water was explored, it was found that TMV rods aligned parallel to the interface at low concentrations but aligned normal to the interface at high concentrations, which could be attributed to a compromise between maximizing interfacial interactions and minimizing electrostatic repulsion between the rods. 475 Parallel alignment of TMV can also be achieved through assembly at interfaces between buffer and a lipid monolayer supported on a submerged hydrophobic substrate, with the inclusion of Ca 2+ ions helping to screen Coulomb repulsion between the particles. 522, 523 Another possibility for the formation of assemblies of high aspect ratio viruses is through mixtures with spheres; the increased free energy at the interface favors the assembly of uniform structures. 524, 525 This was observed in a study where isotropic, nematic, lamellar, and crystalline phases were obta ined through the modulation of the concentration of TMV, the concentration of BSA or PEG spheres, and the ionic strength.",

            "text": "Addition of divalent metal cations has also been shown to induce the formation of ordered aggregates of TMV. Precipitates of TMV with nematic liquid crystal properties were formed with the addition of ions such as Cd 2+ , Zn 2+ , Pb2 + , Cu 2+ , and Ni 2+ , an effect that did not extend to the alkaline earth metals Ca 2+ and Mg 2+ . 526 Furthermore, highly ordered, optically birefringent films were formed when the aggregates were dried on a glass surface. It is hypothesized that TMV contains low-affinity metal binding sites that induce its crosslinking in the presence of the metal ions. While beneficial for liquid crystal applications, this behavior poses an important consideration when formation of well-dispersed biomineralized TMV is desired in the formation of hybrid materials. For example, achieving conditions for dense copper deposition without aggregation of the TMV templates is a challenge. 527 Nevertheless, exciting new properties may be possible as a result of particle assembly. Assembly of TMV in the presence of Ba 2+ is of particular interest, as instead of the liquid crystalline ordering found for other divalent metal ions studied, the TMV crystallized into a hexagonal superlattice that may have interesting electronic properties. 528 In addition to in-solution techniques, electrospinning, wet spinning, and dip coating have been applied to generate long-range ordered filamentous virus-based films. 333, 529 For example, varied chiral liquid crystalline M13 phage films were obtained with the use of dip coating methods. 333 By carefully adjusting phage concentration, pulling speed, bathing conditions, M13 surface chemistry, and surface chemistry of the solid support, supramolecular M13 films with nematic orthogonal twists, cholesteric helical ribbons, or smectic helicolidal nanofilaments could be produced. These M13 arrays exhibited unique optical and photonic properties such that the films showed iridescence when illuminated, which has potential applications as reflectors or displays. Another potential area of application lies in colorimetric sensing. For example, matrices formed using dip coating of M13 displaying binding peptides for the explosive TNT showed significant enough structure changes in the presence of TNT vapors that levels down 300 ppb could be selectively distinguished (Figure 22) . 395 Another area of interest is the use of viral building blocks for the patterning of surfaces, which can be accomplished using a variety of strategies, including conjugation chemistries 530, 531 and electrostatic interactions. 479, [532] [533] [534] [535] [536] The patterning of virus-based nanobuilding blocks has also been demonstrated using photolithographic and microcontact printing strategies, where a hard elastomeric pattern is \"inked\" with virions and stamped onto a functionalized surface primed to interact with the virus-based nanoparticles. 537 Toward free-standing films, we have recently demonstrated the development of detachable mesoporous films, using a combination of nanosphere lithography and electrodeposition to form nanopatterned, conducting virus-polymer arrays (Figure 23) . 538 To accomplish this, a hexagonally close-packed array of polystyrene (PS) latex microspheres was created using colloidal or nanosphere lithography, yielding a mesoporous architecture. A conducting poly(pyrrole-co-pyrrole-3-carboxylic acid) film was then electrochemically polymerized in the interstitial voids between the PS beads by cyclic voltammetry. Following PS template removal, CPMV particles were deposited atop the conducting polymer film through electrostatic adsorption and hydrogen bonding. The resultant Janus polymer-virus film was found to be robust and stable, allowing it to be electrochemically delaminated from the substrate.",

[489] [490] [491] [492] [493] [494] [495] [496] [497] [498] [499] DNA hybridization facilitates controlled and reversible assembly through adjustment of sequence specificity, temperature, or chemical cues (e.g. access of free nucleotides). The TMV building block is one example where nucleic acid hybridization was applied for the programming of materials. 539, 540 Here, TMV underwent a mild disassembly protocol to expose the 5' end of its genome, which could then be used as a code to guide the assembly of vertical TMV arrays, either directly with the corresponding complementary oligonucleotides displayed on the surface, 539 or through an intervening DNA linker with sequences specific for both the TMV and the surface 540 . As an alternative nucleic acid-based method, RNA templates containing the TMV OAS can be patterned onto surfaces, giving a cue for the in situ formation of TMV arrays from the surface up when purified TMV coat proteins are added. 541, 542 Icosahedrons also make excellent building blocks for self-programmed assembly of crystalline arrays and lattices. Two-dimensional virus arrays of CPMV have been formed through a drop-and-dry method on a mica substrate, with packing symmetry controlled by modulating the PEG surfactant concentration. 543 The organization of the rhombic and hexagonal closed packed structures formed can be attributed to both steric requirements as well as the charge distribution around the capsid surface. Another approach utilizes interfacial adsorption of viral particles under a cationic lipid monolayer that is formed at the surface of an aqueous solution. 544, 545 Based on studies with CPMV and TYMV, varying 2D array architectures such as rectangular, hexagonal, and rhombic lattices were achieved using this method.",

The patchy, but symmetrical, charge distribution on the virus capsid surface enables the formation of binary cubic structures. The authors have also recently extended these concepts to the non-viral protein cage ferritin, yielding photoactive biohybrid crystals with phthalocyanine dyes. 554 More specifically, face-centered cubic crystals up to 100 microns in size were obtained in which the phthalocyanines maintained their native properties, suggesting that such materials could find applications in photodynamic therapy, water treatment, diagnostic arrays, and as an oxidant in organic synthesis.",

            "text": "Light harvesting systems, such as found in the photosynthesis machinery of plants, enable the conversion of light into energy. 571 Chromophores transport energy using F\u00f6rster resonance energy transfer (FRET), whereby electrons are excited upon photon absorption by one chromophore then transfer their energy to another chromophore as they undergo relaxation through further photon emission. The excitation energy gets transferred in a cascade from donors to acceptors when the energy levels of absorption and emission match. The photosynthesis system of plants contains precisely spaced arrays of chromophores that facilitate light harvesting and conversion into energy and is one o f nature's most sophisticated energy conversion complexes. 571 Synthetic light harvesting systems are of great interest in basic energy science and technology development for implementation in solar panels and other photovoltaic devices. Like photosynthetic machinery, viral capsids provide a means to precisely position chromophores with spatial control at the sub-nanometer level. Recognizing this engineering design space, a few examples have been published using the self-assembling TMV scaffold. 68, 572, 573 In brief, TMV coat proteins were covalently labeled with either a donor or an acceptor from a FRET pair and then assembled into disk or rod structures at a controlled ratio of donors to acceptors. Through assembly, the chromophores could be positioned in close proximity at tunable distances in such a way to achieve the most efficient FRET. Similarly, M13 displaying zinc porphyrins has also shown promise as a light harvesting antenna, and FRET was observed in which the porphyrin served as both a donor and an acceptor for exciton migration along the virus. 574 A very recent study has revealed groundbreaking work that further enhances the efficiency of energy transport in light harvesting devices. 575 For the first time, experimental evidence was found that demonstrated a super-F\u00f6rster regime where quantum coherence and classical incoherent mechanisms interact to enhance exciton transfer efficiency compared to what can be found with classical FRET. Genetic engineering of M13 was utilized to regulate the distances between chromophore binding sites to be either around 33 \u00c5 for the \"Classical F\u00f6rster\" clone or 10 \u00c5 for the \"Super-F\u00f6rster\" clone, a distance short enough for increased coupling strength but not too short to experience complete quenching. Fluorescence measurements from the virions modified with a range of donor-to-acceptor ratios of chromophores demonstrated the superior behavior of the Super-F\u00f6rster clone (Figure 25) . Additionally, there was a 68% enhancement in exciton diffusion length, an exciting outcome demonstrating enhanced exciton transport that has previously only been theorized. 576 As another part of the light harvesting process, filamentous viruses have also been employed for electron harvesting as nanowire-based photoanodes due to their ability to form porous networks with high surface area. Previous work has investigated the implementation of M13 in dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs). 560, [577] [578] [579] The design of DSSCs involves the presence of a dye or photosensitizer for light absorption that, when excited, transfers the energy into the conduction band of a TiO 2 photoanode, where it then diffuses to a current collector such as fluorine-doped tin oxide. By using M13 as a sacrificial template for photoanode formation, it was shown that a highly interconnected porous TiO 2 structure could be achieved for greater charge transport efficiency. Strategies to create a porous TiO 2 network included using electrostatic interactions for complexation of TiO 2 nanoparticles and M13 viruses, 577 layer-by-layer phage deposition before TiO 2 nucleation, 578 and crosslinking of the phages by glutaraldehyde to form a hydrogen before TiO 2 nucleation. 579 After removal of the sacrificial viral scaffold, the photoanode was found to possess improved electron diffusio n properties. With additional incorporation of gold nanoparticles, the dye molecules were found to also experience greater light absorption through localized surface plasmon resonance, therefore further improving light harvesting. 579 As another step toward improvement of DSSCs and other photovoltaics, stabilization of SWNTs by M13 through non-covalent binding before biomineralization of TiO 2 was used for successful incorporation of the SWNTs in the photoanode. 560 Due to the high electron mobility of the SWNTs, a high power conversion of 10.6% was observed with this strategy.",

The study presented the first report of the photovoltaic properties of BFO nanoparticles, which showed effective absorption of visible light but a solar power conversion efficiency of only 0.17%. On the other hand, the STO nanowires exhibited photocatalytic water reduction properties, and they could be used for the efficient hydrogen production under both UV and visible light. Additional research in this area investigated the improving the performance of STO nanowires under visible light. 580 Whereas dyesensitization was required in the previous study, 558 a new fabrication method was developed that utilized ammonia gas treatment to tune the optical absorption of the STO nanowires, which was successful for the manufacture of visible-light active photocatalysts.",

At a high enough TMV density, the film was found to form an antireflective surface due to its high surface area and surface roughness, which is beneficial for greater photoelectrochemical cell efficiency.

            "text": "nanostructures have already led to breakthroughs in optics and nanophotonics, 581-584 as well as in biotechnology and biomedicine. 585, 586 For nanometer-sized noble metal particles, the de Broglie wavelength of the valence electrons is of the same order of magnitude as the size of the particle, and as a result quantum size effects may be observed. The characteristic plasmon resonance bands that lead to extraordinary metal enhancement effects arise due to the oscillation of the valence electrons at a collective oscillation frequency. 586, 587 Knowing this, nanostructures can be designed and organized such that their plasmonic bands are finely tuned. For applications in the body, a plasmonic range in the NIR imaging window where light can penetrate several centimeters into the tissue is desirable. The substantial absorption and scattering properties of plasmonic nanostructures can then be used as contrast agents for optical imaging, such as optical coherence tomography 588, 589 and photoacoustic imaging. 590 As a demonstration of a potential application of plasmonics, sensing using viral plasmonics has been achieved by using M13 phage loaded with gold nanocubes for SERS. 591 Alternatively, the plasmonic nanostructures also have applications in a therapeutic context due to the transformation of the absorbed light into heat, 592, 593 which could be applied for the thermal ablation of tumors or the controlled release of drugs. 594, 595 Use as \"theranostic\" reagents, where diagnostic imaging and therapeutic functions are merged, presents another option. 596, 597 Beyond healthcare, it should be noted that plasmonics can also be applied to many disciplines, including nonlinear plasmonics, electronic transport, local heating, biosensors, quantum optics, and metamaterials. 598 Virus-based plasmonic metamaterial synthesis was first demonstrated with BMV shells assembled around gold nanoparticle cores, where 3D crystals formed by the particles exhibited an optical transmission spectrum indicative of multipolar plasmonic coupling between adjacent gold cores. 124 More recently, MS2 phages were functionalized with internal gold nanoparticles and external fluorophores, with the intervening distance controlled using oligonucleotide hairpins (Figure 26) . 174 Enhancements in fluorescence intensity and corresponding decreases in lifetime were observed, and the results correlated well with expectations of the effect of the separation between the plasmon and gain materials. [599] [600] [601] In the reverse configuration (internal fluorophores and gold nanoparticle antennas), fluorescence enhancement was also observed, and it was found to be a function of nanoparticle size and the separation between the plasmon and gain material. 602 Some interesting electromagnetic effects can only be generated through well-structured ordering of plasmonic materials, a property that viruses can provide. A recent example exploring this potential involved the precise placement of plasmonic gold nanoparticles with defined spacing and symmetry using cysteine-functionalized CPMV. 281 The CPMV was engineered to allow gold to be placed at the 12 vertices around the capsid. The resultant plasmonic nanocluster demonstrated resonances at visible wavelengths due to interactions of neighboring gold nanoparticles, and finite-element simulations suggest the structure is likely to give rise to a 10-fold enhancement of the local electromagnetic field through near-field coupling.",

For many diseases, there is still much to tackle to improve the effectiveness of their diagnosis and treatment. One challenge of great interest for the transition of new virus-based nanomaterials into the clinic will be to attain more exquisite control over the ability to regulate the immune response and clearance behavior for specific applications. The immunogenicity of the proteinaceous coat of viral particles can be advantageous for immunotherapy but is undesirable when the particles are used as nanocarriers for imaging and drug delivery. It has been shown that the elimination of particles by antibodies can tuned with PEGylation, and alternative coatings such as serum albumin can further reduce an immune response. By conferring stealth properties, repeat administration of virus-based nanomaterials for applications in diagnostics and therapeutics will become achievable.",
