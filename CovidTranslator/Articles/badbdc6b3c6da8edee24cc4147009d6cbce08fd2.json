By July 2003, the global outbreak was declared over. A new coronavirus, SARSassociated coronavirus (SARS-CoV), was identified as the causative agent; this virus appeared to have a zoonotic origin, as genetically similar coronaviruses have been identified in several animal species. The global response to the outbreak was extensive. Within a short period, the pathogen had been identified, new diagnostic tests were developed, surveillance systems were created, infection control and prevention measures were instituted, and transmission among humans stopped. It is unclear if and when person-to-person SARS-CoV transmission will reappear. However, procedures have been established by public health organizations, including the World Health Organization (WHO) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), to help guide diagnosis, reporting, surveillance, and prevention.",

            "text": "In 2002 and 2003, a previously unknown infectious agent caused a widespread, global outbreak of life-threatening respiratory infections. The illness was called severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and was one of the first emerging infections in recent history to test the global public health response. Strategies used to prevent and control SARS helped to shape future public health response to infectious disease emergencies such as the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic. SARS emerged in Guangdong Province, China, in mid-November 2002 and was first officially reported to WHO in February 2003. In mid-March 2003, WHO issued an alert calling attention to several outbreaks of severe atypical pneumonia in Hong Kong, Hanoi, and Singapore. Many of the initial SARS infections were traced to a guest staying at a Hong Kong hotel, and global spread occurred quickly with multiple outbreaks reported in China, Southeast Asia, Europe, and North America. By mid-April 2003, the causative agent was identified as a new coronavirus, SARS-CoV. An unprecedented global outbreak response (including the implementation of surveillance systems, epidemiologic studies, appropriate infection control measures, and development of laboratory diagnostics) was swiftly initiated. In July 2003, WHO announced that the SARS outbreak was over. Although a few laboratoryassociated SARS infections were reported in Asia after the outbreak was declared over, no infections have been reported worldwide since early 2004. Almost all persons with SARS were reported from China, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Singapore, or Toronto, but overall, as of December 2003, WHO had received reports of SARS from 29 countries and regions: 8096 persons with probable SARS, resulting in 774 deaths, a case-fatality rate of 9.6%. In the United States, eight infections were documented by laboratory testing, and an additional 19 probable infections were reported. The syndrome arose and vanished within several months, and it is unclear when or if SARS will return.",

During the 2002-2003 SARS outbreak, several strains of a coronavirus unrelated to previously described coronaviruses were identified and isolated from clinical samples, including respiratory secretions, urine, and autopsy tissues.

Studies of animal ecology and virus evolution have revealed that SARS-CoV-like viruses are also present in other animals, including those commonly traded at live animal markets in southern China (e.g., masked palm civet, raccoon dog, red fox). At this time, it is unclear if these animals are susceptible hosts or carriers of SARS-CoV, but recent research indicates that the masked palm civet probably served as intermediate host between bats and humans during the 2002-2003 outbreak. Sequence analyses of SARS-CoV have shown that SARS-CoV-like viruses that infect masked palm civets are very similar (genome identity >99.6%) to the SARS-CoV that infected humans in the 2002-2003 SARS outbreak, suggesting that the virus had only recently circulated in the masked palm civet. The increased prevalence of SARS-CoV immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies among animal traders compared with a control group (13% versus 1% to 3%) further supports this theory. In addition, the absence of SARS-CoV antibodies in the general population without clinical evidence of SARS suggests that SARS-CoV did not widely circulate before the 2002-2003 SARS outbreak.",

Studies have determined that SARS-CoV can remain stable on environmental surfaces for several days, although the virus can be easily inactivated by disinfectants. The virus has been isolated from respiratory secretions, saliva, tears, urine, and stool. Viral shedding generally does not persist beyond 4 weeks, except in stool, in which the virus can be detected by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for longer than a month. Isolation of the virus more than a month after the onset of illness is rare. Virus detection in nasopharyngeal specimens using quantitative RT-PCR found that the level typically peaks during the second week of illness, often when severely ill patients are seeking medical care. As patients improve clinically and the viral load decreases, transmission of the virus also decreases. Unlike other respiratory viral infections, such as influenza, transmission before symptom onset has not been reported. During the recent SARS outbreak, transmission occurred primarily in hospitals, less so within households, and to an even lesser extent within communities.",

Being familiar with the clinical features of SARS-CoV disease, assessing travel history and exposure risk, and recognizing unusual clusters of unexplained pneumonia can help maximize early detection. In the absence of person-to-person transmission, public health and healthcare personnel should be aware of specific settings that should raise suspicion for SARS-CoV infection (www.cdc.gov/ncidod/sars/ absenceofsars.htm).

Additional studies confirmed that after 7 to 10 days, RNA was detectable by RT-PCR in the majority of both respiratory and stool specimens. Second generation RT-PCR assays, developed after the outbreak ended, can detect SARS-CoV RNA in more than 80% of respiratory specimens within the first 3 days of symptom onset.

This milestone is important because an undetectable anti-SARS antibody in a serum specimen obtained more than 28 days after onset of illness is one of three exclusion criteria recommended by the CDC when defining an infection as a probable SARS case. A 3-year study that followed the progression of antibody titers in 56 patients with SARS found that levels of anti-SARS-CoV IgG peaked 4 months after onset of illness, then decreased; 3 years after infection, IgG was still detectable in 26% of patients.

Because of apparent lack of circulating SARS-CoV in humans, a single reactive serologic test may support a diagnosis, but the positive predictive value of serologic testing is low, and confirmation by an experienced laboratory is still recommended. Test results that suggest a diagnosis of SARS must be evaluated in the context of clinical findings, exposure risk factors, and epidemiologic data. The positive predictive value of a laboratory diagnosis increases with the collection and testing of multiple and different specimen types.",
