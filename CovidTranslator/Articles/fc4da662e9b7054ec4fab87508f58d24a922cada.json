Disk susceptibility data of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae, Serratia marcescens, Proteus spp., Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter spp., Stenotrophomonas maltophilia and other non-fermentative Gram-negative bacilli causing nosocomial infections were evaluated. Data on annual patient-days and annual consumption (defined daily dose (DDD) per 1000 patientdays) of extended-spectrum cephalosporins (cefotaxime, ceftriaxone, ceftazidime, flumoxef, cefepime and cefpirome), \u2424-lactam-\u2424-lactamase inhibitor combinations (ticarcillin/clavulanic acid and piperacillin/tazobactam), carbapenems (imipenem and meropenem), aminoglycosides (amikacin, gentamicin and tobramycin), fluoroquinolones (ciprofloxacin (oral and injectable) and oral levofloxacin and moxifloxacin) from 1991 to 2003 were analysed. Increasing trends of incidences of several of these bacteria causing all nosocomial infections or nosocomial bloodstream infections were noted from 1991 to 2003. The annual patient-days of the hospital significantly increased, from 360 210 in 1991 to 672 676 in 2002 (linear regression analysis, P < 0.05), but slightly decreased in 2003 (629 168) owing to the severe acute respiratory syndrome epidemic in Taiwan. The rise in cefotaxime-resistant or ciprofloxacin-resistant E. coli and meropenem-resistant P. aeruginosa was significantly correlated with increased consumption of extended-spectrum cephalosporins, \u2424-lactam-\u2424-lactamase inhibitor combinations, carbapenems, fluoroquinolones and aminoglycosides (for ciprofloxacin-resistant E. coli and meropenem-resistant P. aeruginosa only) in the hospital (Pearson's correlation coefficient, r > 0.72 (or <\u22120.72) and P-value < 0.05). Increased ciprofloxacin-resistant K. pneumoniae and meropenem-resistant Acinetobacter spp. was significantly associated with the increased usage of extended-spectrum cephalosporins but not with the other four classes of antibiotics. This 13-year study in a hospital demonstrated significant changes in antimicrobial use, which may have affected antimicrobial resistance in certain Gram-negative bacteria at the hospital.",

            "text": "Antimicrobial resistance is an increasing threat in hospitalised patients, and both mortality and morbidity from infection are greater when caused by antimicrobial-resistant bacteria [1] [2] [3] [4] . Among these resistant bacteria, extended-spectrum cephalosporin-resistant Enterobacteriaceae, carbapenem-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii, and ciprofloxacin-resistant Enterobacteriaceae and non-fermentative Gram-negative bacilli (NFGNB) are of great concern because antimicrobial therapy for infections due to these resistant pathogens remains a clinical dilemma in hospitalised patients [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] . Increases in the prevalence of these resistant pathogens in hospitals are frequently related to the high selective pressure of antimicrobials commonly used in hospitalised patients, particularly extended-spectrum cephalosporins, \u2424-lactam-\u2424-lactamase inhibitor combinations, carbapenems, fluoroquinolones and aminoglycosides [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] . Importantly, susceptibility profiles of nosocomial pathogens are affected not only by a single agent but also by use of multiple agents [21] . The higher resistance of organisms to some antimicrobial agents is frequently associated with heavy use of fewer antimicrobials [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] . Understanding the hospital antibiogram and hospital profile of antimicrobial use is mandatory in solving the problem of antimicrobial resistance in hospitals.",

Second, widespread use of four major classes of antimicrobial agents in the hospital were significantly associated with the increase in cefotaxime and ciprofloxacin resistance in E. coli and carbapenem resistance in P. aeruginosa. Increased use of extended-spectrum cephalosporins was also significantly related to the increased incidence of cefotaxime resistance in K. pneumoniae and carbapenem resistance in Acinetobacter spp. The increased use of fluoroquinolones is also significantly associated with the increased incidence of cefotaxime resistance in K. pneumoniae and carbapenem resistance in P. aeruginosa.

A significant positive correlation between the increase in the use of extended-spectrum cephalosporins (particularly ceftazidime) and the increased prevalence of ceftazidime-resistant K. pneumoniae, Enterobacter spp. and P. aeruginosa has been described in many previous reports [17, [29] [30] [31] [32] . Our study further demonstrated this positive association with cefotaxime use and cefotaximeresistant S. marcescens. However, a significantly increased use of cefepime in NTUH failed to result in an increased rate of cefepime resistance in A. baumannii and even exerted a protective effect against this resistance (r = \u22120.952 and P = 0.012). Use of piperacillin/tazobactam has been demonstrated to reduce rates of ceftazidime-resistant or ESBL-producing K. pneumoniae [12, 29, 32] . However, our study showed a significantly positive association between piperacillin/tazobactam use and piperacillin/tazobactamresistant A. baumannii.",

However, cefotaxime resistance in Enterobacter spp. and ceftazidime-resistant P. aeruginosa declined gradually.

However, increasing resistance may further drive increased consumption of several so-called 'last-line' antimicrobial agents. In this study, the increase in the incidence of nosocomial infections due to multidrug-resistant P. aeruginosa and A. baumannii and cefotaxime-resistant E. coli and K. pneumoniae resulted in an increase in the use of carbapenems. The increased use of these agents was significantly associated with an increase in the incidence of nosocomial infections due to carbapenem-resistant A. baumannii and P. aeruginosa, S. maltophilia and other NFGNB, particularly among patients hospitalised in intensive care units (data not shown). Previous studies have demonstrated that the spread of pauci-clones of carbapenem-resistant or pandrug-resistant A. baumannii and poly-clones of carbapenem-resistant P. aeruginosa in intensive care units and other wards at the hospital contributes significantly to the increased rates of carbapenem resistance among these isolates [6, [10] [11] [12] .",
