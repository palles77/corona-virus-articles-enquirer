For example\uff0cthe Hospital Emergency Incident Command System (HEICS) has emerged as a popular incident command system model for hospital emergency response in the United States and other some countries. Since the inception of the HEICS in 1991, several events have transformed the requirements of hospital emergency management, including the 1995 Tokyo Subway sarin attack, and the 2003 Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) outbreaks in eastern Asia and Toronto, Canada. But HEICS should be continuous improved as additional challenges arise and as hospitals gain further experience with its use 5 . However, in China, due to different political system and other problems, most hospitals still lack the emergency management system similar to HEICS, even if there are some disadvantages in HEICS. In the past 20 years, the major respiratory infectious diseases in China are SARS outbreaks in 2003, H1N1 crisis in 2009, and small-scale prevalent of H7N9 in 2013. In terms of epidemic and transmission scale, this crisis of COVID-19 is close to SARS, so lessons learned from the SARS epidemic should be especially important in responding to the current emergency6 . In fact, the significant gap in the detection capacity of new infectious diseases and emergency incident responsive system had been found in China 7 . Unfortunately, these gaps are only recognized, but not paid more attention and improved in time, which has become a potential crisis.There is permanent resident population of about 1.8911 million, but the proportion of floating population is higher and the COVID-19 protection and control task is hard in Zhuhai. Our hospital, the fifth affiliated hospital of Sun Yat-sen University, is the only designated hospitals in Zhuhai. There are advantages and disadvantages to set up designated hospital for management and treatment COVID-19 patients in a comprehensive tertiary hospital. Compared with special infectious disease hospital, comprehensive tertiary hospital has powerful PCCM department, multidisciplinary consultation, and can mobilize more resources. For example, Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation (ECMO) was operated by group with the rich experience and All rights reserved. No reuse allowed without permission.",

On the contrary, too much administrative departments and related clinical departments were involved, resulting in poor implementation in treatment and management, based on traditional hospital responsive mode. But, our hospital could assess epidemic situation and regulate hospital strategy quickly, establish NCP department with direct leading and management by president of hospital, professional guidance by professor and faculty from PCCM. The infection department was transferred to the periphery in charge of infection control instead of NCP treatment. Depended on rich experience of respiratory specialist on treatment of viral pneumonia, COVID-19 patients had been treated well, particularly for 22 severe and critical patients. Within one month, six versions of the guideline for NCP have been published. Rather than sticking to the guidelines, the opinions from respiratory professor and the expert group had been thorough implemented dependent on individualized treatment, under the direct authorization of the president. Therefore, after the adjustment of the main treatment group and strategy, the overall treatment effect significantly improved, all patients were successfully cured and discharged.Meanwhile, zero infection in medical faculty was due to early finding of person-to-person transmission characteristic of COVID-19 and enough supply of protective equipment and materials from hospital and government financial support.",
