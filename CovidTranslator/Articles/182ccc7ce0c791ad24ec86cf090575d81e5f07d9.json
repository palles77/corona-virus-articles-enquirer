            "text": "The role of apoptosis in mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) infection is still controversial. To better assess the role of apoptosis in MHV infection, we used three different biologic phenotypes of MHV to examine their differential effect on the induction of apoptosis. MHV-A59 produces acute hepatitis, meningoencephalitis , and chronic demyelination. MHV-2 causes only acute hepatitis and meningitis, whereas Penn98-1 produces acute hepatitis and meningoencephaliti s without demyelination. We detected TdT-mediated dUTP nick-end labeling (TUNEL) staining in the livers and meninges of MHV-A59-, MHV-2-, and Penn98-1infected mice. TUNEL staining in brain parenchyma was only detected in MHV-A59-and Penn98-1-infected mice. We detected apoptosis by electronmicroscopy in olfactory neurons during acute infection with MHV-A59. The kinetics and distribution of TUNEL staining correlated with the pathologic damage and colocalized with viral antigen in some cells. At 1 month, TUNEL staining was found exclusively in areas of demyelination in the spinal cord of MHV-A59-infected mice; however, it was not found in nondemyelinated mice infected with MHV-2 or Penn98-1, or in mock-infected mice. TUNELpositive cells were identi ed as macrophage/microglial cells, some astrocytes, and some oligodendrocytes , by colabeling with cell-speci c markers. The presence of TUNEL staining in oligodendrocytes suggests that apoptosis may play an important role in MHV-induced demyelination. Journal of NeuroVirology (2002) 8, 392-399.",

MHV-A59 is a neurotropic virus that causes a biphasic disease in susceptible mice. Acute disease consists of severe hepatitis and focal meningoencephalitis, whereas chronic disease consists of demyelinating lesions, found mainly in the spinal cord (Lavi et al, 1984b) . The resemblance to multiple sclerosis (MS) makes it an attractive experimental model for MS (Lavi et al, 1984a; Lavi et al, 1999) . MHV-2, on the other hand, causes a monophasic disease, consisting of acute hepatitis and meningitis (Das Sarma et al, 2001b) . Penn98-1 is a recombinant virus produced with the backbone of MHV-A59 and an S gene derived from MHV-2. It causes acute hepatitis and meningoencephaliti s but does not cause demyelination (Das Sarma et al, 2000) . The phenotypic difference between these three closely related viruses provides an opportunity to study the contribution of various phenotypic properties to pathogenesis.",

Apoptosis induces elimination of virus-infected cells by cytotoxic T cells (Shibata et al, 1994) ; it slows viral spread (Clem et al, 1991) , or participates in an autoimmune process (Osborne, 1996) . Sindbis virus infection causes apoptosis during fatal encephalomyelitis in neonatal mice, whereas infection of adult mouse brain results in insigni cant cytopathology and only minimal apoptosis (Grif n et al, 1994a (Grif n et al, , 1994b . Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis virus (TMEV) infection is associated with abundant apoptosis in neurons and in mononuclear cells in the brain and spinal cord during acute infection. During the chronic demyelinating disease induced by the virus, apoptotic oligodendrocytes , macrophages, microglia, and astrocytes are found in demyelinating lesions (Palma et al, 1999; Tsunoda et al, 1997) . In experimental allergic encephalomyelitis (EAE), the disease is much milder in mice lacking Fas and Fas ligand molecules, with equal in ammatory response, suggesting that apoptosis contributes to the clinical disease and demyelination (Okuda et al, 1998; Sabelko et al, 1997; Waldner et al, 1997) . A pan-caspase inhibitor, injected prior to immunization, signi cantly reduces the incidence of EAE. Treated animals show less in ammatory in ltrates and demyelination, and reduced axonal loss (Furlan et al, 1999) . However, though molecules of the apoptotic cascade are well represented in the central nervous system (CNS) during the disease process in EAE, their expression is mainly in in ammatory cells and microglia but not in oligodendrocytes .",

Two studies show apoptotic T cells, macrophages, astrocytes, and oligodendrocytes in MHV-(JHM) infection (Barac-Latas et al, 1997; Wu and Perlman, 1999) , but neither one of these studies compared demyelinating viruses with nondemyelinating viruses, and therefore were unable to directly address the relevance of apoptosis to demyelination. In one of these reports, the authors interpreted the nding as indicating that the distribution of demyelination correlates with macrophage in ltration better than with the presence of apoptotic cells (Wu and Perlman, 1999) . This study did not investigate the nature of the apoptotic cells by cell-speci c markers and therefore could not identify parenchymal cell apoptosis. In another study, Fas-de cient mice infected with JHM virus variant J2.2-v1 did not show a different level of demyelination and in ammation from wild-type infected mice (Parra et al, 2000) . However, apoptosis can occur by a Fas-independent mechanism. In the present study we re-examined the potential role of apoptosis in MHV-induced disease using a variety of MHV strains with different biologic properties. We used a demyelinating strain of the virus (MHV-A59) in comparison to a nondemyelinating, strain (MHV-2), which we recently sequenced and characterize d (Das Sarma et al, 2001b) , and two newly constructed recombinant viruses (Penn98-1 and Penn98-2) that present a hybrid phenotype (Das Sarma et al, 2000) . The availability of these closely related viruses that differ in the demyelination phenotype helps to better de ne the role of apoptosis in demyelination.",

We use different strains and recombinant viruses with various biologic phenotypes to assess the contribution of apoptosis to the different components of the pathologic process, especially demyelination. Having the advantage of the different biologic phenotypes of the virus, we are able to show for the rst time that apoptosis correlates with the pathologic damage in MHV infection. During acute infection, apoptosis is found in the livers of all three viral phenotypes, as all three viruses cause hepatitis. TUNEL-positive cells are also seen in acute encephalitis; however, the intensity of staining does not always correlate with the intensity of the pathologic process. Whereas acute encephalitis in MHV-A59 infection is associated with extensive TUNEL-positive cells, the encephalitis caused by Penn98-1 and Penn98-2 is not accompanied by extensive TUNEL staining. We have previously shown that acute encephalitis caused by Penn98-1 and Penn98-2 is similar to MHV-A59-induced encephalitis in viral titers, in ammatory in ltration, and viral antigen distribution (Das Sarma et al, 2000) . The reduced ability of the Penn98 viruses to cause apoptosis may be an inherent property of these viruses, unrelated to CNS viral load. TUNEL staining was not detected in brain parenchyma of MHV-2-infected mice, consistent with a lack of brain parenchymal involvement in MHV infection (Das Sarma et al, 2001b) .",

Morphological identi cation of apoptotsis in hepatocytes in the liver and in neurons in the olfactory bulb supports the hypothesis that at least some of the parenchymal cell death during acute infection is due to apoptosis. Apoptotic cells are prevalent in regions of high viral titers (Fishman et al, 1985; Lavi et al, 1988) , but colabeling of TUNEL and viral antigen was seen only in a few cells in brain and liver. Also, TUNEL staining is not present in all dying cells, suggesting that apoptosis is not an exclusive path of cell death in this infection, and that a signi cant number of cells were also undergoing necrosis. The virus may induce apoptosis directly in infected cells or indirectly in uninfected cells by mediator molecules such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF) secreted by infected cells. An et al (1999) showed that MHV-A59 causes apoptosis in vitro in 17CL-1 cells, but not in DBT cells, in spite of productive infection in both cell lines; this indicates that apoptosis is not a universal mechanism of cell death in MHV infection.",

Proliferating macrophages and microglial cells play a very important role in the demyelinating process and apoptosis may be a mechanism of controlling the number of these cells in areas of damage. The distribution of F4/80C cells is found to be mainly in the center of the demyelinated lesion, as has been shown in other experimental systems of demyelination. Their role in demyelination is still debated, because these cells may have both functions that may indicate active role in demyelination or just as phagocytic elements to collect the myelin and cellular debris from the lesion. Similar role may be attributed to the apoptosis found in a small number of astrocytes near areas of damage. Apoptosis may represent a mechanism of controlling the level of proliferating astrocytes in reactive gliosis. However, TUNEL staining is also detected in CAIIpositive oligodendrocytes. Because TUNEL staining usually indicates an irreversible stage in the life of a cell, the presence of apoptosis in oligodendrocytes suggests that at least part of the demyelinating process is due to programmed cell death in oligodendrocytes. In the CNS, a single oligodendrocyte is responsible for the myelination of a large number of axons. The loss of only very few oligodendrocytes can account for extensive demyelinating damage. Moreover, apoptosis is usually a fast event and fragments of apoptotic cells are quickly phagocytosed (Majno and Joris, 1995) and only a small amount of ongoing active demyelination can be detected at any given time point. Thus, we conclude that, even if only a small number of oligodendrocytes in areas adjacent to the areas of demyelination are detected containing TUNEL staining at any particular time point in MHV infection, apoptosis is nevertheless a signi cant factor in MHV-induced demyelination. The fact that the majority of the apoptotic cells were macrophages and lymphocytes, as also reported in JHM infection (Wu and Perlman, 1999) , should not diminish the importance of apoptotic parenchymal cells.",

The relationship between apoptosis, in ammation, and tissue damage needs further investigation, perhaps by further dissection of the apoptotic cascade.",
