In this model, MAS represents the process of spatiotemporal interactions among individuals, and SWN describes the social relation network among agents. The model is composed of agent attribute definitions, agent movement rules, neighborhoods, construction of social relation network among agents and state transition rules. The construction of social relation network and agent state transition rules is essential for implementing the proposed model. The decay effects of infection \"memory\", distance and social relation between agents are introduced into the model, which are unavailable in traditional models. The proposed model is used to simulate the transmission process of flu in Guangzhou City based on the swarm software platform. The integration model has better performance than the traditional SEIR model and the pure MAS based epidemic model. This model has been applied to the simulation of the transmission of epidemics in real geographical environment. The simulation can provide useful information for the understanding, prediction and control of the transmission of epidemics. multi-agent system, small world network, epidemic, spatiotemporal transmission, geographic information system Citation:",

Thereafter some derivatives, such as SEIR model (E-exposed) and SIRS model [2] , were proposed. Based upon the simulation of the stochastic process of infection, onset and spreading of each SARS patient, Shi [3] constructed a system dynamic model of SARS spreading. Wang et al. [4] presented an improved dynamic model to assess the epidemic potential of SARS and the effectiveness of control measures. However, the epidemic system dynamic equations assume that the populations are total mixing and they neglect spatial effects spread of epidemics [5] .",

Liu et al. [14] and Deng et al. [15] utilized the MAS method to simulate the outbreak of the SARS as well as the process of stabilization under control. In these studies, they investigate how the different factors affect the development of disease and try to find some effective approaches to control the epidemic. However, this kind of model has some drawbacks. Although an epidemic is usually recognized as occurring over time, it obviously is a process involving space [16, 17] . But most of the existing MAS based epidemic models mainly focused on the impacts of the infection parameters such as infection rate and cure rate. Some researches touch on the spatial process of epidemic transmission. For example, Gong et al. [18] designed a prototype system based on the virtual geographic environment platform to carry out agent-based simulation of SARS transmission in a virtual community. However, most of these MAS based epidemic models still fail to take into account the influence of social relations among agents.",

It has been widely used in physics, mathematics, biology and other nature scientific fields. Newman studied disease transmission on a one-dimensional small world network [9] . However, most of SWN based models cannot be directly used to simulate the transmission of epidemic simulation by using real data. This paper presents a new method of integrating multiagent systems, small-world networks and geographic information systems for solving complex simulation problems regarding epidemic spatiotemporal transmission. Thereinto MAS represents the process of spatiotemporal interactions among individuals, SWN describes the social relationship among agents and GIS is used to manage and visualize the spatial datasets of simulation process. This method is then tested by simulating the flu spread in Guangzhou, a city in south China.",
