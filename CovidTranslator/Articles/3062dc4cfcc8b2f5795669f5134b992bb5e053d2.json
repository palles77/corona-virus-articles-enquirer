            "text": "Lassa fever (LF) is a severe viral hemorrhagic fever caused by Lassa virus (LASV). The LF program at the Kenema Government Hospital (KGH) in Eastern Sierra Leone currently provides diagnostic services and clinical care for more than 500 suspected LF cases per year. Nearly two-thirds of suspected LF patients presenting to the LF Ward test negative for either LASV antigen or anti-LASV immunoglobulin M (IgM), and therefore are considered to have a non-Lassa febrile illness (NLFI). The NLFI patients in this study were generally severely ill, which accounts for their high case fatality rate of 36%. The current studies were aimed at determining possible causes of severe febrile illnesses in non-LF cases presenting to the KGH, including possible involvement of filoviruses. A seroprevalence survey employing commercial enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay tests revealed significant IgM and IgG reactivity against dengue virus, chikungunya virus, West Nile virus (WNV), Leptospira, and typhus. A polymerase chain reaction-based survey using sera from subjects with acute LF, evidence of prior LASV exposure, or NLFI revealed widespread infection with Plasmodium falciparum malaria in febrile patients. WNV RNA was detected in a subset of patients, and a 419 nt amplicon specific to filoviral L segment RNA was detected at low levels in a single patient. However, 22% of the patients presenting at the KGH between 2011 and 2014 who were included in this survey registered anti-Ebola virus (EBOV) IgG or IgM, suggesting prior exposure to this agent. The 2014 Ebola virus disease (EVD) outbreak is already the deadliest and most widely dispersed outbreak of its kind on record. Serological evidence reported here for possible human exposure to filoviruses in Sierra Leone prior to the current EVD outbreak supports genetic analysis that EBOV may have been present in West Africa for some time prior to the 2014 outbreak.",

Starting in the late 1970s and continuing through the 1980s, the Kenema Government Hospital (KGH), a 350-bed hospital located in the heart of the LF endemic zone of Sierra Leone, was the primary study site for LF research (30) . The KGH LF program represented a successful partnership between the Sierra Leone Ministry of Health and Sanitation (MoHS), the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and other partners. Much of the authors' knowledge about LF and VHFs in general comes from the studies conducted at the KGH and affiliated sites during this period (18, 34, 35) . Following the end of the civil conflict in Sierra Leone (1991) (1992) (1993) (1994) (1995) (1996) (1997) (1998) (1999) (2000) (2001) (2002) , a diverse group of organizations including the Sierra Leone MoHS, the World Health Organization (WHO), the United States' Office for Foreign Disaster Assistance, the United States Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases (USAMRIID), and Tulane University and its partners (the Viral Hemorrhagic Fever Consortium, VHFC) reinstated the LF clinical and laboratory research program at the KGH (4, 12, 30) . The major aims of this effort have been to enhance the laboratory diagnostic capacity and training, to develop national and regional prevention and control strategies for LF, and to perform studies on clinical management, infection, and environmental control.",

Yet, the numbers of suspected cases presenting to the KGH increased (41) . This is due in part to the efforts of the KGH LF outreach team, who educate healthcare providers in rural health centers to the LF threat and alert them to the renewed availability of free LF testing and treatment at the KGH. Currently, the LF program at the KGH provides diagnostic services and clinical care for more than 500 suspected LF cases per year (41) with routine laboratory testing for LF using recombinant antigen immunoassays that were implemented in 2008. Since 2008, there have been continuous improvements in LF laboratory (LFL) testing at the KGH, including developing and refining recombinant antigen enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) for the detection of LASV antigens (viremia) and for LASV-specific immunoglobulin M (IgM) and immunoglobulin G (IgG) (11) (12) (13) 24) . A lateral flow immunoassay (LFI) was implemented in 2010 (11,12,24,41; Boisen et al. Improved Diagnosis of Lassa Fever Using ReLASV LF Immunoassays [in preparation]) for its simplicity, low cost, and widespread use in a variety of clinical and field settings, particularly in regions where electricity and other resources are not routinely available. This LFI, termed the ReLASV \u00d2 Antigen Rapid Test, was developed by Corgenix, Inc., and CE marked in 2013.",

            "text": "In early 2014, another VHF was first documented in West Africa. Multiple cases of Ebola virus disease (EVD), a severe VHF caused by Ebola virus (EBOV), have recently been described in West Africa. These are the first reported cases of filovirus disease in the West African subregion (19, 21) , except for the single nonfatal case of disease caused by Ta\u00ef Forest virus reported in Ivory Coast in 1994 (22) but not seen again. In the 2014 outbreak, the first EVD cases were detected in Guinea in the town of Gu\u00e9k\u00e9dou near the Sierra Leonean and Liberian borders (Kissi Kingdom) in early February 2014. EVD subsequently spread to other regions in Guinea, including the capital city of Conakry located in the southwestern region. EVD cases were also reported in Liberia, initially in the north bordering the area of the first reported cases in Guinea and later in the capital city of Monrovia. Sierra Leone reported its first laboratoryconfirmed EVD case on May 25, 2014, a case diagnosed by Augustine Goba, Director of the KGH LFL. The West African outbreak has since expanded into the most deadly and geographically dispersed EVD outbreak on record. To date (December 2, 2014), a total case count of 6,599, with 5,441 laboratory confirmed, 79 probable, and 1,079 suspected cases of EVD, have been reported in Sierra Leone, with 1,398 confirmed, probable, and suspected deaths. A total case count in Guinea, Liberia, Sierra Leone, Nigeria, Senegal, Mali, Spain, and the United States now stands at 15,935, with 5,689 deaths (46). Among patients meeting the case definition of LF, who were evaluated at the KGH Lassa Ward from 2008 to 2012, only 11% (190/1,740) were LASV antigenemic (41) . Over the same time span, 65% (1,143/ 1,740) of suspected LF patients tested negative for either LASV antigen or anti-LASV IgM, and therefore were considered to have a non-Lassa febrile illness (NLFI). The NLFI patients had a similar range of morbidity as acute LF cases, which accounts for their high case fatality rate (CFR) of 36% observed in this prior study (41) . Here, studies aimed at determining the causes of the febrile illnesses in non-LF cases presenting to the KGH are reported, including the possible involvement of filoviruses. Prior to the outbreak of EVD in West Africa, the authors had initiated development of EVD immunoassays supported by a NIAID SBIR R43 (Phase I) grant, guided by their experience with LF immunoassays. Genetic analyses of strains that have emerged in West Africa suggest that EBOV has been in Guin\u00e9e Foresti\u00e8re (Forested Guinea) for several decades (1). The Guinean rainforest extends south into both Liberia and Sierra Leone, evoking the possibility of prior human exposure to EBOV in all three countries. Therefore, serum samples were tested from NLFI patients for the presence of non-Lassa febrile agents, including arboviruses and filoviruses, and evidence is reported for possible human exposure to EBOV in Sierra Leone prior to the current 2014 EVD outbreak.",

All subjects met the LF surveillance case definition previously discussed in Khan et al. (30) . Patients with moderate to high symptom frequencies were selected in part based on the volume of the available sample to perform the numerous assays described here. Patients were subdivided into three groups depending on test results from ReLASV \u00d2 rapid tests and immunoassays. Subjects who presented to the KGH Lassa Ward with LASV antigenemia were classified as having acute LF. Subjects with circulating anti-LASV IgM were considered to have had Lassa prior exposure (LPE). As discussed previously (12) , LASV infection appears to interfere with class switching from a predominantly IgM to a predominantly IgG response. Thus, antigen-negative subjects with anti-LASV IgM may have been infected with LASV and become LF convalescent prior to presenting to the Lassa Ward with a NLFI. Subjects with neither LASV antigenemia nor anti-LASV IgM were considered to have a NLFI.",

The most frequent symptoms for all groups were fever, weakness, headache, vomiting, and coughing ( Table 1) . Values of clinical chemistries were also similar for the three subject groups ( Table 2) . LF patients had elevated levels of AST and ALT, enzymes found in the liver, cardiac and skeletal muscle, kidneys, brain, and red blood cells that can be an indicator of organ dysfunction or trauma, but the difference was not statistically significant compared to the elevations in LPE or NLFI groups. Previous studies have found AST and ALT to be significantly elevated in subjects with acute LF compared to other LPE or NLFI groups (12, 24) . The lack of significance in the current study appears to be due to the small sample sizes. While TP was significantly elevated in NLFI compared to LF or LPE groups, the levels of TP in LF patients was also high. Therefore, this marker has limited diagnostic or prognostic value. These results indicate that LF diagnosis should not be based on clinical symptoms or blood chemistries alone, in order not to be confounded with NLFI, which can present with similar symptoms. The use of immunodiagnostic tests provides a clearer method of differentiating LF patients from non-LF patients.",

Serum from the sample that tested positive in the filovirus-specific PCR in January 2012 (G-2266) was not available for testing in the EBOV IgG/IgM ELISA, preventing further characterization of this potential early case of EBOV infection without acute manifestation of EVD. The remaining serum volume was also not sufficient to permit reamplification of filoviral sequences, for cloning of selected amplicons, or for deep sequencing analysis. Patient G-2266 was a 26-year-old Sierra Leonean female who presented to the KGH LFW from another KGH ward as a suspected LF case. She presented with fever, weakness, dizziness, retrosternal pain, and bleeding at the time of presentation to the KGH LFW on January 17, 2012. Following a diagnosis of a NLFI, the patient was not admitted or followed as a suspected VHF case. The patient was LASV antigen-negative by LFI, ELISA, and PCR, and negative in P. falciparum and WNV PCR screens. She registered positive titers for LASV IgM, DENV IgG, CHIKV IgM, WNV IgM and IgG, and typhus IgM. Her serum cytokine profile was unremarkable, registering low levels of IL-10 and IL-8, at 20 pg/mL and 126 pg/mL respectively. A subset of samples collected in early 2014, prior to the identification of the EVD outbreak in Sierra Leone, was further characterized for IgM and IgG reactivity to EBOV VP40 and GP antigens independently (Supplementary Fig. S1 ). Generally, a correlation was not observed between IgM and IgG reactivity on both VP40 and GP antigens on the subset of sera tested. Some patients registered significant IgM reactivity against both antigens (G-3625), without corresponding measurable IgG titers (Supplementary Fig. S1A and B) . Patient G-3637 registered a significant IgM titer to VP40 but not IgG, and an IgG titer to GP but not IgM. Patient G-3640 only registered an IgG titer to VP40. A series of sequential serum samples was available from some patients, drawn throughout their stay at the KGH LFW. Analysis of IgM and IgG reactivities from a given patient over time can provide valuable information on seroconversion to a given infectious agent. Four sequential serum samples were analyzed from patient G-3642, showing consistent VP40 and GP IgG throughout the testing time frame (Supplementary Fig. S1A and B) . Overall, the sample size did not permit extrapolation of significant seroconversion trends, but it provided valuable insights for future studies.",

The patients were generally severely ill, irrespective of whether they were diagnosed with LF, accounting for the CFRs of 17% observed in both the LPE groups (Ag-/IgM + ) and the NLFI (Ag-/IgM-) groups. Signs and symptoms alone were not sufficient to provide a clinical diagnosis of VHF. There were also no differences in clinical chemistry measurements that could be used to distinguish acute LF patients easily from other groups. Elevations of AST in LF and TP in LPE are markers that may offer clinical guidance, but they are not diagnostic. Certain cytokines showed different levels in acute LF, LPE, and NLFI. IFN-c was significantly elevated in fatal cases of LF compared to fatal cases of LPE and NLFI. Focused research on cytokine levels in LF and other VHFs is likely to suggest possible treatment strategies. However, routine cytokine analysis is not feasible in most LF treatment centers, and the broad applicability of these findings for VHF diagnostic purposes is limited. Overall, the studies suggest that only specific diagnostic assays rather than clinical observation or other laboratory measurement can distinguish LF from other cause serious febrile illnesses in this region.",

Despite antimalarial treatment, it was found that 78% of subjects presenting with evidence of LPE or NLFI had detectable levels of P. falciparum DNA by PCR. In the LF patient group, 90% of LF patients also had PCR-detectable levels of P. falciparum in their blood. Nearly all patients were unresponsive to antimalarial therapy, and remained ill. Drug-resistant strains of malaria parasites have been circulating in West Africa, and there are concerns about the self-prescribed use of expired or inactive antimalarials in the region. Further studies of the parasite burden in LF and other febrile illness patients are needed. More studies are needed to determine whether the parasite burdens detected by PCR may be sufficient to induce VHF-like signs and symptoms that precipitated the subjects to seek medical attention.",

            "text": "Overall, 15% of the subjects presenting to the KGH Lassa Ward had detectable RNA in their blood that amplified with WNV-specific primers. Other studies are required to determine whether the RNA detected is specific for WNV or is a related flavivirus, and to confirm whether this important pathogen is responsible for any of the febrile disease burdens in this region of Sierra Leone. Acute infections with YFV were not detected in the cohort tested, although YFV is known to be present in Sierra Leone. A YFV vaccination program has not been implemented in the subregion, although proof of YFV vaccination is required prior to entry by all foreigners into Sierra Leone. Two cases of YFV since 2008 have been detected among patients presenting to the Lassa Ward at the KGH (unpublished data). PCR screening using oligonucleotides specific for DENV, CHIKV, RVF, CCHF, S. typhi STY1599, Lepto. Int. & RFA, R. prowasekii, and B. recurrentis did not reveal any of these or related pathogens in the panel of sera tested. Excluding the possibility that these agents are significant causes of the febrile illnesses in subjects presenting to the VHF Ward at the KGH will require the examination of larger cohorts. Moreover, it may be more appropriate to analyze other sample types. For instance, in some cases, such as S. typhi, it may be more appropriate to analyze stool samples rather than blood. PCR detects nucleic acids in patients with active infections. By contrast, serological studies detect recent to past exposures accumulated over many years. Therefore, a serological study was performed of the exposure to flaviviruses or arboviruses in the febrile illness subjects presenting to the KGH. A high level of exposures was detected in these cohorts to DENV, WNV, CHIKV, leptospirosis, and typhus. More than half of the subjects tested had anti-WNV IgG, while approximately one-fourth of the subjects tested positive for anti-WNV IgM (Supplementary Table S3 ). A recent study by Schoepp et al. (40) also detected the serological response to several of these same pathogens using in-house developed assays (USAM-RIID), albeit at lower levels than in the authors' studies using commercially available serological assays. Cross-reactive antibodies may be present in this serosurvey. For example, CHIKV positivity may reflect a prior infection by ONNV, a related but separate alphavirus. A rapid and accurate diagnosis of flaviviruses is notoriously difficult due to the significant cross-reactivity between members of the family, namely YFV, WNV, and DENV.",

This finding is significant because the patient presented to the KGH LFW in late 2011, more than 2 years before the recent EVD outbreak was detected. A substantial portion of NLFI patients (between 6.8% and 22%, depending on the stringency of immune assay cutoff applied) presenting to the Lassa Ward and tested in this study had IgG that reacted with EBOV proteins. Prior studies have suggested that exposure to filoviruses or filovirus antigens may be relatively common in some communities in Central Africa. For example, Becquart et al. found that the prevalence of EBOV-specific IgG was 15.3% overall, increasing to 32.4% ( p < 0.001) in forest areas (6) . No sociodemographic risk factors were found, but the antibody prevalence increased linearly up to 20 years of age. Becker et al. (5) found that 43.3% of the monkey sera and 6.9% of the human sera collected from various sites in Germany reacted positively with at least one of the three different filovirus antigens. The prevalence of EBOV antibodies in five gold-panning villages situated in northeastern Gabon was 10% (7) . Other studies found a lower seroprevalence of 1% in villages in Gabon outside of recognized outbreak areas. In this latter study, only IgG antibodies were found, and no IgM antibodies were detected.",

The samples analyzed by Schoepp et al. were collected between October 2006 and October 2008, while all of the samples analyzed in the current study were collected after mid-2011. We observed a higher level of background reactivity in our filovirus assay in older samples, potentially due to temperature fluctuations during storage that result in possible sample degradation, which may cause assay background. It is noteworthy that the samples tested by Schoepp et al. were provided by the VHFC, and thus consisted of banked samples that were collected over a 2 year period and subjected to similar storage conditions. Based on phylogenetic analyses, EBOV emergence and exposure to Sierra Leonean populations may be a relatively recent phenomenon, perhaps only a few decades old (1) .",

An individual with EVD presenting to a health facility in this region would have a high likelihood of being diagnosed with another disease, such as malaria, on clinical grounds alone. Rare infections with EBOV could escape detection by organized health surveillance systems that are in place because symptoms are similar to diseases endemic to the region. If such cases had presented to the KGH LF program and been admitted on clinical grounds, routine testing for LF would not have revealed a filovirus infection. No outbreaks of EBOV have been detected in the Eastern Province of Sierra Leone in the recent decade despite an active surveillance program for LF, a VHF that presents with indistinguishable case presentations. Milder or asymptomatic infections with EBOV or cross-reactive but less virulent or avirulent filoviruses could account for the seroprevalences observed in this and other studies. Fruit bats and other forest animals are considered to be reservoirs for EBOV. People living in the area may be exposed to degraded or otherwise inactivated EBOV proteins by consumption of the animals or foods that have been contaminated with saliva from bats or other animals. Repeated exposure to EBOV antigens without overt infection could account for the seroprevalence recorded here.",

Thus, future laboratory evaluations of people presenting with signs and symptoms of VHF must receive a differential diagnosis of LF and EVD. There is no drug treatment for EVD, but supportive care can improve survival. While there is no FDA-approved treatment for LF, ribavirin can reduce mortality in acute infections, but only if used early in infection (25, 27, 43) . Further studies of NLFIs other than LF and EVD in this population are also of interest, but a more extensive characterization than that reported here was not possible due to resource and infrastructure constraints during this project period. Distinguishing between EVD and LF infections will be a continuous challenge in West Africa going forward as the two diseases require distinct management. The EBOVspecific IgG-capture assays used in this study appear to be sensitive, specific, and robust, but more work will be needed to validate the assays fully with derivation of commercially acceptable levels of sensitivity and specificity. This will require further authentication of the assays using serum samples from EVD patients and comparison to other methods, such as IgM capture and virus neutralization. The development of a multiplexed LFI with the ability to differentiate between LASV and the filoviruses is under way, providing a panel approach for rapidly distinguishing among African hemorrhagic virus infections that present with similar symptoms.",

NGS has already been used successfully as both a diagnostic tool and a means to discover novel viruses associated with human diseases (2, 8, 15, 23, 44) . Applying NGS as a diagnostic tool holds the promise for a relatively unbiased view of the microbes infecting humans, as it does not require a priori knowledge of the pathogens present. It also has the potential to elucidate the spectrum of disease-causing viruses in patients with undiagnosed febrile illness, which is a common occurrence in health clinics around the world. NGS can also serve to increase the power of surveillance systems to detect infrequent zoonotic transmissions that have the potential to become pandemics. Epidemiological studies are ongoing with the aim of identifying factors that converged and potentiated the transmission and rapid dissemination of EVD throughout the Western African subregion in 2014. A potential index case for the current EVD outbreak may have been identified in Guinea (1). A recent report suggested that ecological factors may have contributed to the convergence of factors that culminated in the ongoing EVD outbreak in the Manu River region (3) . Anecdotal reports of an exceptionally dry and prolonged dry season, starting with sharply drier than normal conditions at the end of the rainy season, may have had an impact in triggering the transmission of EBOV from its natural host to humans. At least one conclusion may be derived from the current situation: it is clear that geographic expansion and increased human-to-human transmission of one of the most feared infectious agents known to science is underway.",
