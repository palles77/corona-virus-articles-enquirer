A limitation of our evaluation is that screening of HCWs was based on the presence of fever or mild respiratory symptoms in the last ten days, and that no data were collected in HCWs without these symptoms. The sensitivity and specificity of the reported symptoms could therefore not be estimated.",

            "text": "Another possible explanation for the unexpectedly high prevalence would be hospital-acquisition. However, all patients with fever or respiratory symptoms in both hospitals were routinely tested for SARS-CoV-2. At that time, a limited number of infected patients was nursed under strict isolation precautions, and only three SARS-CoV-2-infected HCWs mentioned exposure to an inpatient known with COVID-19. There was no clustering of infected HCWs in specific departments.Sensitive detection of COVID-19 cases in HCWs is crucial for hospital infection prevention policy,particularly for those who work with vulnerable patients. We therefore suggest adjusting the currently used case-definition for suspected COVID-19 in HCWs by taking fever as one of the possible symptoms and not as a required symptom. Further improvement of the sensitivity of COVID-19 detection in HCWs can be achieved by adding severe myalgia and general malaise to the casedefinition.",

Alternatively, total nucleic acids were extracted, with a known concentration of PDV as internal control, using the QIAsymphony DSP virus/pathogen midi kit and pathogen complex 400 protocol of the QIAsymphony Sample Processing (SP) system (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) with an input volume 400 \u00b5l and output volume of 110 \u00b5l. Amplification reactions were performed in a volume of 25 \u00b5L with TaqMan \u00ae Fast Virus 1-Step Master Mix (Thermofisher) and 10 \u00b5L extracted nucleic acids. A duplex PCR for Egen/PDV and if positive a duplex PCR for RdRP/PDV with optimised primer and probe concentrations were performed. 1,3 Amplification using Rotorgene (QIAgen) consisted of 5 min at 50\u00b0C, 15 min at 95\u00b0C followed by 45 cycles of 15 s at 95\u00b0C, 30 s at 60\u00b0C, and 15s at 72\u00b0C.
