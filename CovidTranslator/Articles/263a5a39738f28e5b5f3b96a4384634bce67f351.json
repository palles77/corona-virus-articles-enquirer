            "text": "Two multicentre surveys were conducted in France to estimate the prevalence of Cryptosporidium infection in calves using qualitative ELISA for detection of Cryptosporidium coproantigens and oocysts. The first survey involved 4-12-day-old calves in six dairy-calf distribution centres, collecting calves from seven Administrative Regions (Aquitaine, Bretagne, Franche-Comt\u00e9, Lorraine, Normandie, Nord, Pays de Loire). For each region, 20 calves were selected every month for 12 consecutive months (October 1995-September 1996. Prevalence of Cryptosporidium infection was 17.9% (Confidence Intervals (C.I.) 95%=[16.1%; 19.8%]) among the 1628 selected calves, of which only 5.3% had diarrhoea. The second survey conducted between November 1995 and May 1996 involved 4-21-day-old calves examined by veterinary practitioners who selected 189 livestock farms of dairy-or suckler-type in ten Administrative Departments (Allier, Cantal, Creuse, Doubs, Ille-et-Vilaine, Maine-et-Loire, Manche, Pas-de-Calais, Sa\u00f4ne-et-Loire, Vend\u00e9e). Cryptosporidia were detected in 105 (55.6%) of the farms. Among the 440 calves examined, of which 398 (90.5%) presented diarrhoea, cryptosporidia were found in 191 animals, i.e. a prevalence of 43.4% (C.I. 95%=[38.8%; 48.0%]). Breed of calves and type of housing had very little impact on prevalence in this survey. Some regional variations could be noticed, even if cryptosporidia infection is widespread. Monthly variations could be related to seasonal peaks in calving with a lower infection rate during summer.",

Overall, prevalence studies in cattle ranging from 3-day-old to adult usually give results of approximatively 20% of animals shedding oocysts (Qu\u00edlez et al., 1996; Olson et al., 1997) , while prevalence in neonates is higher, especially when diarrhoeic calves are concerned (Angus, 1990; Garber et al., 1994; Fagan et al., 1995; Qu\u00edlez et al., 1996; SAC Veterinary Services, 1996; de la Fuente et al., 1999) . However, the pathogenic role of cryptosporidia has remained controversial as they were often detected in combination with other enteropathogens such as rotavirus, coronavirus, Escherichia coli or Salmonella. Although some veterinary practitioners doubt the real pathogenicity of cryptosporidia, many experimental and field trials have demonstrated that cryptosporidia may act as a primary pathogen, sometimes being the predominant enteropathogens of calves (Tzipori et al., 1983; Heine et al., 1984; McDonough et al., 1994; SAC Veterinary Services, 1996 de la Fuente, 1999) .",

Within the first week of each month for 12 consecutive months, 20 calves from each selected region were systematically tested for cryptosporidia infection on their arrival at the corresponding distribution centre, e.g. 140 calves per month, 1680 calves for the whole year. Inclusion criteria of calves were restricted to a mean age of 8 days (4-12 days) at the time of sampling and to dairy cattle of the Montbeliard, Normand or Prim'Holstein breed. The survey started on 4 October 1995 and ended on 12 September 1996. Collection and shipment of faecal samples was done by technicians of the two firms concerned, taking into account the following criteria: single-use latex gloves for rectal sampling, single-use plastic sterile flask, and collection of a minimum of 5 g of faeces per sample. Each flask was identified with labels, sealed in polystyrene containers and accompanied by a case report form recording the date of sampling, the region and name of the distribution centre, the identification number of calves, breed, sex and the presence/absence of diarrhoea. All samples were mailed by express, at ambient temperature, and on the same day of sampling to the laboratory (Laboratoire V\u00e9t\u00e9rinaire D\u00e9partemental de Sa\u00f4ne-et-Loire, 71000 M\u00e2con). Cryptosporidium infection was detected by a commercial ELISA kit using anti-Cryptosporidium monoclonal antibodies (Cryptosure \u00ae , Rh\u00f4ne M\u00e9rieux Diagnostics). Faecal samples were processed according to the manufacturer's recommendations and results were expressed as 'positive' or 'negative'.",

The methodology of Survey 1 ensured a good representative sample of the entire population of dairy calves as most of the included calves came from different dairy farms. This kind of protocol also generated a lot of data for a moderate cost. However, it does not allow an estimation of infected farms and it introduces a systematic bias resulting in an underestimation of the prevalence of cryptosporidiosis infection as dairy calves presenting diarrhoea are not usually sent to distribution centres. That is demonstrated by the low rate of diarrhoea (5.2%) observed during Survey 1. This survey probably gives a good estimation of the prevalence of infection in calves populations free of clinical symptoms. Finally, prevalence of infection was pretty stable over the 1-year follow-up, except in July and August which had a lower prevalence of 7 and 8%, respectively. This result is linked to the seasonal incidence of calving which usually shows a decrease during summer. Consequently, the more susceptible calves, i.e. those younger than 1 month, represent a small population at that period of the year which might explain the lower contamination of livestock.",

This is reinforced by the fact that the selection of farms was the decision of the investigators who possibly selected livestock farms with a history of cryptosporidiosis. This second survey probably gives a good estimation of the prevalence of the infection in populations experiencing clinical symptoms. The 43.4% mean prevalence found in this survey confirms that the prevalence of cryptosporodiosis is higher in diarrhoeic than in non-diarrhoeic calves, as found in other studies (Angus, 1990; Qu\u00edlez et al., 1996) . Compared with the prevalence of oocyst excretion in diarrhoeic calves from other European countries, our results are higher than those in Denmark (17%), Hungary (27%), and UK (23-32.9%), similar to those reported in Italy (40%), Germany (40-44%), and the Irish Republic (44.4%), but lower than those from central Spain (52.3%), the Netherland (55%), and Finland (76%) (Angus, 1990; Fagan et al., 1995; SAC Veterinary Services, 1996; de la Fuente et al., 1999) .

However, our results reflect a prevalence of cryptosporidiosis at a point in time as calves were sampled only once. As the pattern of antigen and oocyst excretion in calves is intermittent and false negatives can result if animals are sampled only once (Farrington et al., 1995; McCluskey et al., 1995) , a 100% prevalence for calves between 1 and 30 days of age is possible, which means that all animals will pass oocysts at least once during this period of time (Xiao and Herd, 1994; McCluskey et al., 1995) .",

Various methods of detection (microscopical staining of faecal smears, directly or after concentration, formol-ether sedimentation, salt or sucrose flotation, enzyme immunoassays, immunofluorescent techniques, polymerase chain reaction) have been compared for their sensitivity (Robert et al., 1990; Xiao and Herd, 1993; McCluskey et al., 1995; Peeters and Villacorta, 1995; Webster et al., 1996) . Antigen capture ELISA techniques are sufficiently sensitive to detect clinical cases of cryptosporidiosis when numerous oocysts are shed (McCluskey et al., 1995; Peeters and Villacorta, 1995) , however, more sensitive techniques, such as immunofluorescence or concentration techniques, are necessary in cases of light infection with calves passing few oocysts (Robert et al., 1990; Xiao and Herd, 1993; Webster et al., 1996) . Consequently, an underestimation of our results is possible especially in Survey 1 in which most of the calves were asymptomatic.",

Cryptosporidia were detected in 43.4% (191/440 ) of the calves in Survey 2, while 90.5% (398/440) of the animals showed diarrhoea. The remaining diarrhoeic animals without Cryptosporidium infection at the time of sampling may reflect either a lack of sensitivity of the detection method and/or the involvement of other infectious agents (e.g. rotavirus, coronavirus, E. coli, Salmonella or Giardia), environmental or nutritional factors, which were not investigated according to our initial objective. The present surveys demonstrate that Cryptosporidium infection of calves is wide-spread in France and that further studies are needed to show the relative importance of cryptosporidia, which have emerged as major enteropathogens of calves, in the neonatal diarrhoea syndrome.",
