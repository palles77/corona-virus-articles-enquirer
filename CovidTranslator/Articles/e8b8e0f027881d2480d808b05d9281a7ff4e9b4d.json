Downregulation of hippocampal NR2A subunit was more 65 evident than NR2B in pristane and pristane+LPS at 7wLPS and 12wLPS.

This 117 is a suitable model to evaluate the break tolerance related to environmental factors associated 118 with SLE development. Nevertheless, there are no experimental evidences that relate 119 pristane-induce lupus with cognitive dysfunction associated with the development of 120 autoantibodies against hippocampal NMDA receptor subunits NR2A/2B. 121 In order to evaluate cognitive impairment related to memory deficits in a pristane-induced 122 lupus BALB/c mice, we analyzed the mRNA expression levels of NR2A/2B hippocampal 123 subunits in short and long-term memory task at 7 and 12 weeks after LPS exposition with a 124 behavioral test with the employment of Barnes maze.",

The platform has 20 holes of 2 inches of diameter 163 disposed along the perimeter with 3.2 inches among them (19 empty holes and one scape 164 hole with dark box). For reference points to reach the escape hole, we used extra-maze cues 165 around the room (circle, rhombus, triangle, and square in different colors) and for eliminating 166 odor cues, the experimentator cleaned the platform and the scape box in every trial with ethyl 167 alcohol at 70% (Fig 1, B) .

For the acquisition 175 phase (Day 1 and Day 1') we included two trials per mouse and consisted in place the mouse 176 into a white acrylic cylindrical chamber in the middle of the platform for 10 seconds and then 177 released it to explore the platform for a lapse of 180 seconds, finishing the trial when the 178 mouse entered by itself into the escape hole. In this phase, if the mouse did not enter in the 179 target hole, it can be guided by the experimentator. The probe trials were assessed to evaluate 180 memory and learning consolidation in mice that conformed subgroups and consisted in three 181 repetitions per mouse on the maze to reach the escape hole for 180 seconds, taking in account 182 all the procedures described previously. This phase was denominated Short Time Memory 183 (STM) and consisted of four probe trials (D1-D4). Once finished, mice were preserved for a 184 lapse of 48 hours and then evaluated for the Long Time Memory (LTM) at Day 7. We 185 considered to evaluate the behavioral performance with two parameters: the latency in 186 seconds to reach and enter in the escape box and the errors established as the deflections of187 the head in empty holes for each mouse prior to find and enter in escape box(Fig 1A).",
