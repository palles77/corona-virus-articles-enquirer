Since the mid-1970s, the country has been plagued by two epizootics that claimed thousands of casualties among the indigenous kudu population. Reasons as to why kudus appear to be exceptionally susceptible to the disease still remain speculative at best. Because the Namibian economy relies heavily on trophy hunting, game meat hunting, and ecotourism, the current severe spread of rabies among kudus calls for effective measures to protect these antelopes. Oral vaccination of kudus may offer a possibility provided efficacious oral rabies vaccines are available. In this screening study, we explored options for attractive baits that facilitate optimal vaccine uptake by the target species and a bait distribution system that maximizes bait availability to the target species meanwhile minimizing bait depletion by non-target species. The results show that gelatin-based baits mixed with local (pods of the camel thorn tree) but also imported (apple-flavored corn meal) attractants are highly attractive for kudus providing a basis for future oral rabies vaccine baits.",

The Greater kudu, Tragelaphus strepsiceros, a large African herbivore, occupies the browser-trophic niche in southern Africa (Conybeare 1975; Owen-Smith 1979; Owen-Smith and Cooper 1985, 1989; Wilson 1970 ) and is the one most popular and iconic species of antelope in Namibia. However, since 1977, two epizootics of rabies occurred in the Greater kudu. While between 1977 and 2017, a total of 1049 cases of rabies were laboratory confirmed in this antelope species, the number of unrecorded cases is many times higher. During the first epizootic from 1977 to 1986, approximately 30,000 to 50,000 kudus or 20-40% of the total population are believed to have died of rabies (Barnard and Hassel 1981; Hassel 1982; H\u00fcbschle 1988; Schneider 1985) , and there is no indication that the ongoing intermittent outbreaks of the disease will subside any time soon.",

In addition to cattle and sheep farming, farming of kudus, the second-largest African antelope species, is an important economic branch. As one of the major game species for meat production and a highly priced trophy species, this antelope is very popular as a farmed game species across the country. Namibia hopes to promote its game meat production industry and exports to regional and international markets by 2020, after game was identified as a niche market with potential to grow. It is therefore understandable that in contrast to other African countries, a rabies outbreak among the kudu population can have a significant negative economic and health impact on the farming community of Namibia. Therefore, it has become critical to investigate pathways for effective rabies control in kudus in Namibia (Scott et al. 2012) .",

This assumption is supported by experimental studies in wild ruminants like white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) and red deer (Cervus elaphus) showing that oral administration with BCG vaccine and heatinactivated Mycobacterium bovis, respectively, is able to induce an immune response against bovine tuberculosis (Lopez et al. 2016; Nol et al. 2008; Palmer et al. 2014b) . Experimental studies resulted in commercial vaccines for oral administration in ruminants for immunization of calves in controlling diarrhea caused by bovine rotavirus and coronavirus. While these vaccines are taken up in the gastrointestinal tract (de Leeuw and Tiessink 1985) , in contrast, for oral vaccination against rabies using attenuated virus constructs, one needs to target the oral cavity (Baer et al. 1971 (Baer et al. , 1975 .",

Important preconditions, however, are that they possess a high safety profile and that a minimum effective dose has been established in experimental studies. Recently, it was shown that in principle, kudus can be vaccinated by the oral route and protected against a subsequent rabies infection, although further studies need to be initiated to optimize oral vaccine uptake and delivery (Hassel et al., unpublished) . Next to efficacious oral rabies vaccines, another considerable challenge is the development of suitable baits. Baits for delivery of vaccines and other pharmaceuticals have been developed for wild carnivores (Johnston and Voigt 1982; Linhart et al. 2002; MacInnes 1988; Schneider et al. 1987; Vos et al. 2004) , dogs (Matter et al. 1995; Schuster et al. 1998) , feral swine (Ballesteros et al. 2011; Campbell and Long 2007; Fletcher et al. 1990; Kaden et al. 2000; Kavanaugh and Linhart 2000; Snow et al. 2016) , and herbivorous species such as whitetailed deer (Palmer et al. 2014a, b) and prairie dogs (Abbott et al. 2018; Tripp et al. 2014) but not yet for kudus. Therefore, the objectives of this study was trying (i) to explore potential suitable baits for kudus that are attractive to and well accepted by the target species and facilitate optimal vaccine uptake and (ii) to identify a possible bait distribution system that maximizes bait availability to the target species meanwhile minimizing bait depletion by non-target species.",

The site was enclosed by a 3.2m high fence and guarded 24 h per day. Kudus were housed in pens of 7 m \u00d7 14 m in size consisting of a covered and an open area, which could be separated from each other by a sliding door and entered separately. Upon arrival, kudus received parasite treatment with doramectin (Dectomax-1% solution, Pfizer, Sandton, South Africa) as well as multivitamins and metabolic stimulant injections (Kyrophos Metabolic-V, Kyron Laboratories, Johannesburg, South Africa). Animals were fed two times a day. The diet consisted of lucerne straw and standard game cubes, alternated with game cubes plus ivermectin (Feedmaster, Windhoek, Namibia; Boskos WESenterprises, Thabazimbi, South Africa). Depending on availability (hot dry season), the diet was supplemented with pods of the camel thorn tree (Acacia erioloba) and umbrella thorn tree (Acacia tortilis). The pens were cleaned daily; drinking water was offered ad libitum and supplemented with regular addition of probiotics, minerals, and vitamins. The baiting studies were conducted under general permit nos. 101631, 101835, 101826, and 101825 for capturing and keeping of game animals and research permit nos. ",

To successfully control the disease in this antelope, innovative disease management tools for kudus are needed. Expanding the concept of oral vaccination against rabies as successfully developed for wild carnivores to kudus seems to be a feasible approach as shown recently (Hassel et al., unpublished) . This is the first time that baits for delivery of vaccines for kudus have been developed and tested experimentally. The bait ingredients were carefully selected according to reported food preferences of kudus in the field. Usually, kudus feed on different shrub and tree species but also small amounts of herbs and grass. Where shrubs, trees, and herbs are predominant, browse predominates the diet; however, when scarce, grass can be consumed in considerable amounts (Conybeare 1975; Hooimeijer et al. 2005) . Acacia tree spp. including camel thorn and umbrella thorn, some of southern Africa's most common trees, belong to the favored browse plants of kudus. Because the pods are highly nutritious and are actively sought when available in particular during the dry season (Owen-Smith and Cooper 1983), these pods were regarded the perfect attractant for our baits.",

However, differences were clearly visible between individual animals. Bait uptake was lower in pen 2 than in pen 1 during the first screening study (Table 1) ; the amount of food intake of the former group of animals was generally low. Also, both animals in group C of study 4 did not take any of the baits containing the vaccine sachet, irrespective of the bait type. As these baits were almost all rapidly accepted by the animals in the other groups (A, B, D) (Online Resource 6), obviously, it was not the palatability of the baits but the animals in this group C that somehow did not eat the baits (incl. the control bait) (Online Resource 6). Unfortunately, acacia pods are not everywhere easily available and also grinding the pods is not an easy task. Therefore, with the apple-flavored bait, we were also looking for alternatives to baits made from local material. Interestingly, this particular bait was also well accepted by the animals. Since this bait type would be much easier to manufacture, the material needed can easily be purchased. Under field conditions (study 3), both baits made from local material as well as baits that can much more easily be produced en masse were well accepted, however, more intensified studies with the different baits should be carried out to identify the most optimal bait.",

            "text": "Next to a safe and efficacious oral rabies vaccine and an attractive bait, the third component of oral vaccination concerns a suitable bait distribution system. In Europe and North America, oral rabies vaccine baits are distributed predominantly by plane using a pre-determined bait density per square kilometer; distance between individual bait drops is fixed, as well as the distance between the flight lines (M\u00fcller et al. 2012) . In certain areas like heavily populated areas, baits cannot be distributed by plane and are therefore distributed by hand. Sometimes, new strategies like clustered baiting using for example bait stations are used (Boulanger et al. 2006) . These techniques are also applied for wild boars (Sus scrofa), a species with a similar social structure as kudus (Ballesteros et al. 2011; Rossi et al. 2015) . Unfortunately, most of these bait distribution systems are not suitable for targeting kudus in Namibia. Hence, a system was tested that would reduce bait depletion by non-target species considerably, incl. insects and rodents. Also, the system to be developed should reduce exposure to the high temperatures and direct sun light that can be detrimental for the vaccine baits, both for the bait matrix (melting) and vaccine (titre). Piercing baits on thorns at a certain minimum height within the favored acacia trees by kudus (studies 2 and 3; Online Resources 3 and 4) could offer a suitable solution to bait depletion by non-target species, including smaller antelopes (browsers). A similar distribution system by placing baits at a certain height in canopies of trees to avoid bait competition by ground-dwelling animals and over-flying birds has already been suggested for baiting gorillas against Ebola (Dolgin 2008) . Furthermore, such a system reduces thermal stress for bait and vaccine while the canopy of the trees/shrubs in which the baits are placed protects it from direct sunlight. Also, placing the baits not on the ground between the grass vegetation but exposing them to air movement increases heat loss from the bait to the air by convection. Bait and vaccine uptake by larger browsers like eland (Taurotragus oryx) which share the range with kudus on many farms would not be disadvantageous, since this species has also been shown to be susceptible to rabies infection and would benefit from it. Due to the large areas affected by kudu rabies, optimal baiting strategies in Table 1 Results of the two-foodpreference test (baiting study 1) of three experimental bait types in comparison to umbrella thorn tree pods used as control baits. Experimental baits used were as follows: gelatin-based baits containing grinded pods of the camel thorn tree (type 1), gelatin-based baits containing pits of camel thorn tree pods (type 2), and apple-flavored corn meal baits (type 3) Pen 1 (n/N) Pen 2 (n/N) terms of bait delivery and distribution (spatial and temporal) would need to be developed in the future. For example, to achieve optimal bait uptake, baiting could preferably be done during the dry season when the kudus actively visit the waterholes. It would also be necessary to have a number of baiting stations, preferably near waterholes, and to lure the animals by Bpre-baiting^using camel thorn pods, to these stations. Also, based on the observation in baiting study 3, continued provisions of vaccine baits at baiting stations over several days need to be taken into account.",

Finally, a bait distribution system has been suggested that maximizes uptake by the target population meanwhile minimizing uptake by non-target species. However, this bait distribution system must be developed in more detail under field conditions to assure high bait uptake and hence, high vaccination coverage among free-roaming kudus and also to qualitatively and quantitatively identify potential bait competitors. Safari Den, and Voermol Feeds for generous donations. We also wish to express our thanks to the Namibia Agricultural Union who commissioned and supported these studies and secured the necessary funding. We are also grateful to the Ministry of Environment and Tourism, the Directorate of Veterinary Services of the Ministry of Agriculture, Water and Forestry, and the Namibian Civil Aviation Authority for expediting the issuing of all required permits for these studies. We would like to extend our thanks to Ortwin von Gossler, Helmut Halenke, Rainer Halenke, Peter Schaepe, Hendrik Herselman, and Johnnie Hamman for donating kudus and to Peter Reinhardt, Wilhelm, Sebson, Khaleb, and Severn for supervising the keeping of the animals.",
