African green monkey is a widely used non-human primate model in biomedical investigations. In this study, total RNAs were extracted from stool samples of 10 African green monkeys with diarrhea. Highthroughput sequencing was used to characterize viromes. PCR and Sanger sequencing were used to determine the full genome sequences. Great viral diversity was observed. The dominant viruses were enteroviruses and picobirnaviruses. Six enterovirus genomes and a picobirnavirus RNA-dependent RNA polymerase sequence were characterized. Five enteroviruses belonged to two putative new genotypes of species Enterovirus J. One enterovirus belonged to EV-A92. The picobirnavirus RNA-dependent RNA polymerase sequence had the highest nucleotide similarity (93.48%) with human picobirnavirus isolate GPBV6C2. The present study helped to identify the potential zoonotic viruses in African green monkeys. Further investigations are required to elucidate their pathogenic roles in animals and humans.",

African green monkey was considered a viral reservoir which might spread viral pathogens to humans (Chahroudi et al., 2012) . Some research investigated certain viruses in African green monkeys. Oberste et al. (2013) investigated three picornavirus genera (Enterovirus, Parechovirus, and Sapelovirus) in African green monkeys at the Dazark Zoo of Bangladesh, but none was detected. Gallagher et al. (2017) detected simian picobirnaviruses in fecal samples from diarrhea-free African green monkeys of the Caribbean region.

Although most enterovirus infections are asymptomatic, some may cause serious or fatal diseases, such as acute flaccid paralysis, aseptic meningitis, hand-foot-and-mouth disease, epidemic pleurodynia, diarrhea and severe respiratory disease Pons-Salort et al., 2015; Scully et al., 2018) . Enteroviruses may circulate between humans and NHPs. Some enterovirus types with a worldwide distribution in humans have been detected in NHPs (Sadeuh-Mba et al., 2014; Mombo et al., 2015) . It is therefore extremely important to identify the circulating enteroviruses among NHPs because they might mutate and infect humans, thereby causing new emerging diseases. Recently, a growing number of enteroviruses were reported in NHPs. SEV-gx was identified from stool samples of rhesus macaques (Ao et al., 2016) . Mombo (Mombo et al., 2017) detected EV-B112 in a chimpanzee fecal sample and EV-B113 in a mandrill fecal sample. Wang et al. (2016) identified Sev-nj1 from a fecal sample from rhesus. In this study, we detected six novel enteroviruses in stool samples from captive African green monkeys with diarrhea in China. Strain CHN/BJ/2018-1A might be a member of species Enterovirus A, most of which can infect humans. It had the highest similarity with human enterovirus 92 strain RJG7, which was found in an NHP with diarrhea (Oberste et al., 2007) .

Strain SPBV-3 detected in this study is indicated by a black dot. strains were found in five separate monkeys in this study. Coinfection of strain CHN/BJ/2018-1A and CHN/BJ/2018-1J was detected in one African green monkey. Whether the six enteroviruses were pathogenic to African green monkeys should be verified by additional research.

            "text": "The genus Enterovirus consists of 15 species, namely Enterovirus A-L and Rhinovirus A-C (ICTV Report, 2020). Members of a enterovirus species should share greater than 70% polyprotein amino acid sequence identity, greater than 60% amino acid identity in region P1 and greater than 70% amino acid identity in region 2C plus 3CD (ICTV Report, 2020). Enterovirus genotype was currently defined as sharing greater than 75% nucleotide similarity and greater than 85% amino acid identity in the VP1 coding region (Lukashev et al., 2018) . Four strains 1J, 8J, 9J, 10J shared 70.32%-73.53% polyprotein amino acid identity, 57.58%-61.06% amino acid identity in P1 and 80.78%-83.56% amino acid identity in region 2C plus 3CD ( Table 2 ) with strains of species Enterovirus J. We suggested that they should be classified into species Enterovirus J. VP1 sequences of these four strains and that of species Enterovirus J shared 50%-58.16% nucleotide similarity and 46.35%-55.45% amino acid identity ( Picobirnaviruses are small, non-enveloped viruses with a genome of two unrelated linear dsRNA segments. Picobirnaviruses have been detected in the faeces of humans and a wide range of animals worldwide, but their pathogenicity remains unknown (Malik et al., 2014; Delmas et al., 2019) . In this study, picobirnavirus sequences were detected from seven out of ten stool samples of green monkeys with diarrhea, suggesting a high picobirnavirus infection ratio in African green monkeys. Picobirnavirus strain PBV/Simian/KNA/08873/2015 RdRp sequence detected from an African green monkey in the Caribbean region (Gallagher et al., 2017) had 69.93% nucleotide similarity (92% coverage) and 63.27% amino acid identity (100% coverage) with that of the picobirnavirus in this study, illustrating the great diversity among picobirnaviruses in African green monkeys. The high nucleotide similarity (93%) of picobirnavirus RdRp detected in this study with that of human picobirnavirus GPBV6C2 found in a stool specimen from a patient with diarrhea indicated that African green monkey could be a reservoir of human picobirnavirus. The possibility that human picobirnaviruses could circulate among African green monkeys and humans could not be eliminated. Picobirnavirus strains in this study had a 100% identity, while enteroviruses showed diversity among the same animal colony. These viruses might have different evolutionary histories or dynamics, which is worthy of further investigations.",

Enterovirus and picobirnavirus reads accounted for the majority of mammalian virus sequences. Full genomic characterisation of six enterovirus strains and a picobirnavirus RdRp sequence were depicted. Two new genotypes of enteroviruses were defined. The enteroviruses and picobirnavirus identified in this study are worthy of further investigation to clarify their pathogenicity, and surveillance is needed to determine their transmission to humans or other animals.",
