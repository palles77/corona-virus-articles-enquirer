In addition, BMAP-28 provided some protection in vitro against human herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1). The parent peptides and mBMAP-28 analog protected mice from lethal i.p. infections in an acute peritonitis model at peptide doses significantly lower than those toxic to the animals, suggesting a satisfactory therapeutic index.",

Among the compounds that are currently under investigation for their therapeutic potential are a number of cationic antimicrobial peptides of the innate immune system, and their synthetic derivatives [11, 23] . Cationic antimicrobial peptides are present in all living organisms as a first-line host-defense mechanism against invading microbes. Most of these peptides rapidly inactivate bacterial, fungal or viral pathogens by a mechanism which in most cases is mediated by disruption of integrity of the microbial membranes [18] . This relatively non-specific mechanism is difficult to evade by susceptible bacteria, as indicated by the relatively rare selection of bacterial strains resistant to cationic peptides [6] and can be considered an interesting feature of these peptides in view of their development as anti-infective drugs.",

            "text": "In this study, we investigated the therapeutic potential of two natural peptides belonging to the mammalian cathelicidin peptide family [8, 12, 22] . These molecules were denoted BMAP-27 and -28 (BMAP is an acronym for 'bovine myeloid antimicrobial peptide', to indicate that both are antimicrobial components of the bovine neutrophils). The two peptides are 26 and 27 amino acid residues long, respectively, and are C-terminally amidated. They share a 28.5% sequence identity and an additional 50% similarity [19] . Prior structural studies suggested that both molecules include a 1-18 N-terminal region that undergoes an \u2423-helical conformation in membrane mimicking environments, and a non-helical, hydrophobic C-terminal region. Both BMAPs kill Gram-negative and -positive bacteria and fungal species at micromolar concentrations, and retain strong and broad spectrum antimicrobial activity in the presence of physiologic salt concentrations [19] . In addition, in vitro antibacterial and anti-parasite efficacy against Leptospira interrogans serovars and against Cryptosporidium parvum has recently been reported for BMAP-28 [10, 17] . The mechanism of action of these peptides is based on the ability to rapidly bind to and permeabilize the membranes of target microorganisms. However, BMAP-27 and -28 prove toxic to mammalian cells in a concentration range above 10 M, suggesting poor discrimination between prokaryotic and eukaryotic cell membranes. Structure-activity relationship (SAR) studies aimed to increase selectivity towards microbial organisms led to the design of truncated BMAP derivatives comprising the 1-18 N-terminal sequence and lacking the hydrophobic C-terminal region [19] . These compounds, denoted BMAP-27(1-18) and BMAP-28 (1) (2) (3) (4) (5) (6) (7) (8) (9) (10) (11) (12) (13) (14) (15) (16) (17) (18) , were virtually devoid of cytotoxic and haemolytic activities and displayed antimicrobial potency comparable to, or only slightly lower than that of the parent BMAP peptides. Similar properties were also shared by an analog of BMAP-28 with modified C-terminal region, named mBMAP-28. Collectively, these SAR studies suggested that the hydrophobic C-terminal tail is a major determinant of the toxicity of BMAP molecules to mammalian cells [19] .",

Specifically, we analysed the in vitro activity of BMAP-27 and -28 and of their analogs against a wide panel of Gramnegative and -positive clinical isolates, also including many antibiotic-resistant strains, and against the human herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1). Additionally, an 18-residue peptide comprising the C-terminal region and lacking the 1-9 N-terminal residues, has also been tested. Their potential to protect in vivo from infections by Gram-negative and -positive organisms was assessed using a mouse acute peritonitis model.",

Side chain protecting groups were as follows: Trityl (Trt) for His, t-butyl (tBu) for Tyr and Ser, t-butyloxycarbonyl (Boc) for Lys, and Trp and 2,2,4,6,7pentamethyldihydrobenzofuran-5-sulfonyl (Pbf) for Arg. To obtain C-terminally amidated peptides, the Fmoc-PAL-PEG-PS resin (0.16 mEq/g) was used. The synthesis was carried out at 45 \u2022 C in N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) with a six-fold excess of Fmoc-amino acids, activated in situ by an equivalent amount of 2-(1H-benzotriazole-1yl)-1,1,3,3-tetramethyluronium tetrafluoroborate (TBTU), in the presence of 0.6 N N-methylmorpholine. To improve the yield, difficult couplings were performed with an eight-fold amino acid excess, using an equimolar amount of O-(7-azabenzotriazole-1-yl)-1,1,3,3-tetramethyluronium hexafluorophosphate (HATU) as coupling agent. After cleavage and deprotection with a mixture of trifluoroacetic acid/water/thioanisole/phenol/ethandithiol/triisopropylsilane (81.5:5:5:5:2.5:1, v/v) for 2 h at room temperature, the crude peptides were repeatedly extracted with methyl butyl ether and purified by reversed phase high performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) on a preparative (19 mm\u00d7300 mm) C18 Delta-Pak column (Waters, Bedford, MA, USA) using an appropriate 0-80% water/acetonitrile gradient in the presence of 0.05% trifluoroacetic acid. Molecular masses were determined by electrospray mass spectrometry (ES-MS), using an API I instrument (PE SCIEX, Toronto, Canada). Purified peptides were dissolved in 0.05% TFA at approximately 1 mM concentration, divided in small aliquots and kept frozen at \u221220 \u2022 C until use. The concentration of BMAP-27 and BMAP-27 (1) (2) (3) (4) (5) (6) (7) (8) (9) (10) (11) (12) (13) (14) (15) (16) (17) (18) was determined at 257 nm considering a molar extinction coefficient of 195.1 for each Phe residue [4] , BMAP-28 peptides were measured at 280 nm, using a molar extinction coefficient of 5559 for Trp [4] and of 1280 for Tyr [7] .",

The antibacterial activity of these peptides was tested by a microdilution susceptibility assay towards 53 bacterial isolates. These included a variety of clinically relevant, antibiotic-resistant species: MRSA, vancomycin-resistant E. faecalis (VREF) (Fig. 1) and multi-resistant strains of P. aeruginosa and A. baumannii (Fig. 2) . BMAP-27 and -28 displayed a broad-spectrum activity with MIC values ranging from 1 to 8 M in most cases. These values confirm and extend those previously obtained against a limited panel of ATCC strains [19] . Despite structural similarity, the two peptides revealed different and somewhat complementary spectra of activity, i.e. BMAP-27 was more effective against Gram-negative species (MIC values of 1-2 M, Fig. 2 and Table 2 ), whereas BMAP-28 showed a better activity against Gram-positive strains (MIC values of 1-8 M, Fig. 1 and Table 2 ). Importantly, similar or even lower MIC values were observed when the activity towards antibiotic-susceptible versus antibiotic-resistant strains (e.g. MSSA versus MRSA strains and VSEF versus VREF strains) was compared (Fig. 1 ). Table 2 ). Conversely, BMAP-28(1-18) was slightly less effective than BMAP-28 against Gram-positive strains but showed significantly improved activity against Gram-negative strains. Thus, based on these in vitro data, removal of the C-terminal hydrophobic sequence not only results in improved selectivity towards bacterial versus mammalian cells, as already reported [19] , but also towards Gram-negative versus Gram-positive microorganisms. The BMAP-28(10-27) fragment, which lacks part of the N-terminal \u2423-helix and maintains the C-terminal hydrophobic region of BMAP-28, showed comparable activity against both Gram-positive and -negative microorganisms, and was only slightly less potent than BMAP-28 against P. aeruginosa (MIC values increased from 2-to 4-fold, Fig. 2 ). The modified mBMAP-28 analog, characterized by a more hydrophilic C-terminal region than BMAP-28, was highly potent against Gram-negative strains, with MIC values significantly lower than those of BMAP-28 (MICs of 0.25-1 M) towards A. baumannii and P. aeruginosa (Fig. 2) . By contrast, this analog showed a marked decrease in the activity against Gram-positive strains (most MICs are >32 M), with the remarkable exception of three highly susceptible S. agalactiae strains.",

The lack of the C-terminal region, or replacement of hydrophobic residues in this region with more hydrophilic ones, had no effect towards Gram-negative microorganisms and in some cases led to improved activity, as specially observed with mBMAP-28. Conversely, these modifications resulted in decreased activity against Gram-positive strains, with the notable exception of S. agalactiae, which remained highly susceptible. It is interesting to note that the decreased activity against Gram-positive bacteria parallels the decreased cytotoxicity towards mammalian cells observed upon removal or modification of the C-terminal tail [19] . Understanding of these differences in activity will require deeper investigations of bacterial surface components and of their interaction with the peptides.",

The use of an acute peritonitis model in mice was suggested by the results of in vivo toxicity tests, that indicated a much better LD 50 for i.p. rather than i.v. administration of these peptides. The in vivo results using the parent BMAPs are encouraging and parallel those obtained in vitro. BMAP-27 was highly protective against E. coli and P. aeruginosa, with 100% protection at respectively 0.2 and 0.8 mg/kg, and was considerably less effective against i.p. challenge with S. aureus (Table 5 ). Conversely, administration of BMAP-28 at 0.8 mg/kg resulted in 100% protection against i.p. injection of an MRSA strain and was less effective against E. coli and P. aeruginosa. Importantly, protection is achieved at peptide doses that are significantly lower than those which are toxic to animals (i.e. no i.p. toxicity up to 36 mg/kg), suggesting a satisfactory therapeutic index for these compounds. In keeping with the in vitro results, mBMAP-28 also protects mice from lethal i.p. dose of P. aeruginosa, whereas the 1-18 fragments are more effective in vitro than in vivo. These peptides are poorly or no protective in the mouse model used, suggesting that the hydrophobic C-terminal region is important for the in vivo activity.",

            "text": "Despite a wealth of published in vitro activity studies of antimicrobial peptides against antibiotic-resistant clinical isolates, there are only a few published reports of their in vivo activity. PG-1, a 18-residue cathelicidin peptide with a \u2424-sheet structure, was tested in a mouse model of acute peritonitis induced by S. aureus and P. aeruginosa [21] . The effective doses of PG-1 compare well with those of BMAP-27 and -28. A highly potent PG-1 analog proved effective in reducing oral microflora in humans, suggesting that antimicrobial peptides may be useful for treatment of oral infections [14] . Other in vivo studies examined the effect exerted by the sheep cathelicidin peptide SMAP-29 in an ovine model of acute pulmonary infection. This peptide is highly similar to BMAP-28 (63% identity) and proved effective after pulmonary deposition in a lamb pneumonia model induced by Mannheimia haemolytica. SMAP-29 reduced the bacterial concentration in bronchoalveolar fluid and in consolidated pulmonary tissues, as well as the severity of the lesions in the lungs, suggesting it may find an application in the treatment of respiratory tract infections [3] . Further in vivo studies were performed with indolicidin, a bovine cathelicidin peptide, using an animal model of systemic fungal infection caused by intravenous injection of Aspergillus fumigatus spores [1] . Free indolicidin was highly toxic to mice when injected i.v. (all treated animals died at 12 mg/kg peptide), whereas administration of the peptide encapsulated in lipo-somes significantly reduced toxicity. Liposomal entrapped indolicidin at 40 mg/kg considerably increased animal survival, suggesting that liposome carriers may improve the therapeutic index of toxic peptides [1] . Finally, indolicidin and other antimicrobial peptides were investigated in three rat models of septic shock. Treatment with all the peptides used in this study resulted in a significant reduction in plasma endotoxin and TNF-\u2423 concentrations and reduced the rates of animal deaths as compared to controls [9] .",
