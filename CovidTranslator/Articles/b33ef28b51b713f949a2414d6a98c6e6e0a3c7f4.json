            "text": "The nonsense-mediated decay (NMD) pathway presents a challenge for RNA viruses with termination codons that precede extended 3= untranslated regions (UTRs). The umbravirus Pea enation mosaic virus 2 (PEMV2) is a nonsegmented, positive-sense RNA virus with an unusually long 3= UTR that is susceptible to NMD. To establish a systemic infection, the PEMV2 long-distance movement protein p26 was previously shown to both stabilize viral RNAs and bind them for transport through the plant's vascular system. The current study demonstrated that p26 protects both viral and nonviral messenger RNAs from NMD. Although p26 localizes to both the cytoplasm and nucleolus, p26 exerts its anti-NMD effects exclusively in the cytoplasm independently of long-distance movement. Using a transcriptome-wide approach in the model plant Nicotiana benthamiana, p26 protected a subset of cellular NMD target transcripts, particularly those containing long, structured, GC-rich 3= UTRs. Furthermore, transcriptome sequencing (RNA-seq) revealed that the NMD pathway is highly dysfunctional during PEMV2 infection, with 1,820 (48%) of NMD targets increasing in abundance. Widespread changes in the host transcriptome are common during plant RNA virus infections, and these results suggest that, in at least some instances, virus-mediated NMD inhibition may be a major contributing factor. IMPORTANCE Nonsense-mediated decay (NMD) represents an RNA regulatory pathway that degrades both natural and faulty messenger RNAs with long 3= untranslated regions. NMD targets diverse families of RNA viruses, requiring that viruses counteract the NMD pathway for successful amplification in host cells. A protein required for long-distance movement of Pea enation mosaic virus 2 (PEMV2) is shown to also protect both viral and host mRNAs from NMD. RNA-seq analyses of the Nicotiana benthamiana transcriptome revealed that PEMV2 infection significantly impairs the host NMD pathway. RNA viruses routinely induce large-scale changes in host gene expression, and, like PEMV2, may use NMD inhibition to alter the host transcriptome in an effort to increase virus amplification.",

For example, a pyrimidine-rich, 400-nt sequence immediately following the gag stop codon in Rous sarcoma virus confers NMD resistance to the unspliced viral RNA by recruiting polypyrimidine tract binding protein 1 (PTBP1), which prevents UPF1 from binding (20, 21) . In contrast, Turnip crinkle virus (TCV) contains an \u03f350-nt unstructured region (USR) at the start of its 3= UTR that can confer NMD resistance to sensitive transcripts (22) . Introducing stable secondary structure into the TCV USR without changing its sequence abolished NMD protection, whereas significantly changing the sequence while maintaining the lack of structure maintained protection, suggesting that highly unpaired regions of RNA are inherently NMD resistant when positioned immediately downstream of a termination codon (22) . Ribosome recoding (frameshifting and readthrough) sites, which allow translation to continue past termination codons, can also protect NMD-sensitive RNAs (22) (23) (24) .

ZIKV capsid protein targets nuclear UPF1 for proteasomal degradation, causing a global inhibition of NMD (28) . The viral core protein of Hepatitis C virus (HCV) disrupts the interaction between host protein WIBG and EJC components, attenuating NMD (29) . Finally, the Cauliflower mosaic virus (CaMV) transactivator (TAV) protein interferes with the VARICOSE decapping complex, which is likely required late in the plant NMD pathway (30) .",

However, gRNAs can be stabilized by plant virus-encoded movement proteins (MPs), which bind to viral and other RNAs without known specificity and traffic them in a cell-to-cell manner through plasmodesmata and/or over long distances through the vascular system (31, 32) . Umbravirus Pea enation mosaic virus 2 (PEMV2) (family Tombusviridae) has a positive-sense, singlestranded gRNA (4.2 kb) that is targeted by NMD (22) and that encodes both cell-to-cell and long-distance MPs (p27 and p26, respectively) (Fig. 1A) . The best-studied umbravirus MP is the p26 orthologue from Groundnut rosette virus (GRV) known as plasmid ORF3 (pORF3). pORF3 localizes to the nucleolus and interacts with nuclear protein fibrillarin for long-distance (systemic) movement of GRV gRNA (32) (33) (34) (35) . pORF3 also binds nucleic acids nonspecifically (31) , and both pORF3 and PEMV2 p26 were previously shown to be able to increase the stability of Tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) gRNA (36) . The stabilization activity of pORF3 was posited to result from formation of dense ribonucleoprotein (RNP) particles consisting of pORF3 oligomers, fibrillarin, and viral RNA (31, 34, 35) .",

PEMV2 p26 and p27 MPs are expressed from overlapping ORFs on the PEMV2 sgRNA ( Fig. 1A) (37) . Elimination of p27 expression had no effect on virus accumulation in Arabidopsis protoplasts in a previous study (38) . In contrast, mutating the p26 start codon (PEMV2\u0394p26) resulted in a 4-fold decrease in viral RNA levels, suggesting that the p26 long-distance MP has an additional function that enhances accumulation of PEMV2 gRNA in single cells (38) . To determine if similar effects would be apparent in planta, wild-type (WT) PEMV2 or PEMV2\u0394p26 was subjected to agroinfiltration along with the p14 RNA silencing suppressor from Pothos latent virus (PLV) (39) into leaves of young Nicotiana benthamiana plants, which are widely used as laboratory hosts for a large number of plant viruses. p14 was included for all agroinfiltrations to increase transient gene expression and also to serve as an internal control for reverse transcription-quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR). Since agroinfiltration leads to expression of viral gRNA in nearly every cell within the infiltrated region, assaying gRNA accumulation in infiltrated (local) leaves reflects the efficiency of virus replication/stability independently of virus movement. At 3 days postinfiltration (dpi), PEMV2\u0394p26 gRNA accumulation in local leaves (i.e., infiltrated leaves) was reduced 4-fold compared with WT PEMV2 (Fig. 1B) , similarly to what was previously observed using Arabidopsis protoplasts (38) and further supporting the idea of a role for p26 in promoting genome stability independently of long-distance movement.",

            "text": "To determine if p26, by serving as an RNA silencing suppressor, is required for efficient viral RNA levels, we used transgenic N. benthamiana 16c (40) endogenously expressing green fluorescent protein (GFP) (Fig. 1C) . When additional GFP is overexpressed by agroinfiltration of plasmid PZP-GFP, both endogenous and infiltrated GFP levels are silenced, substantially reducing GFP fluorescence (40) . However, when an RNA silencing suppressor is infiltrated, a patch of strong GFP fluorescence is observed, as the GFP mRNA is no longer silenced. Indeed, coinfiltration of PZP-GFP with the p19 RNA silencing suppressor from Tomato bushy stunt virus (TBSV) (41) reversed the silencing and resulted in strong GFP expression (Fig. 1C) . However, coinfiltration of PZP-GFP with p26 or PEMV2 replicase-associated protein p33 had no effect on GFP silencing, demonstrating that both p26 and p33 were shown to lack detectable RNA silencing suppressor activity by this assay. Although PEMV2 lacks an RNA silencing suppressor, Pea enation mosaic virus 1, an enamovirus and helper virus for PEMV2, possesses an RNA silencing suppressor that likely confers protection to the PEMV2 genome during natural coinfections (42) . p26 protects both viral and nonviral 3= UTRs against NMD targeting. Since the RNA stabilization activity of p26 was not due to RNA silencing suppression, we hypothesized that the RNA-binding ability of p26 might confer protection against NMD by occluding UPF1 binding. An agroinfiltration-based NMD assay previously developed by Kertesz et al. (11) was used to determine whether the presence of p26 alone can protect NMD-sensitive transcripts. The GFP reporters used in this assay have been previously described (11, 22) and differ with respect to the composition and length of sequence downstream of the GFP ORF ( Fig. 2A) as follows: GFP-3=UTR PEMV contains the PEMV2 3= UTR; GFP-L (long sequence downstream of the GFP ORF) contains \u03f3500 nt from the bean phytohemagglutinin (PHA) gene; and GFP-S (short sequence downstream of the GFP ORF) contains only the CaMV 35S transcription termination sequence. Constructs with long 3= UTRs (GFP-3=UTR PEMV and GFP-L) are NMD sensitive, and GFP-S is NMD resistant (11, 22) . The GFP reporters used were previously described (22) . (B) GFP reporters were subjected to agroinfiltration along with p14 and Mock (-), p26, or U1D. (Top) At 48 h postinfection (hpi), infiltrated leaves were examined and GFP intensity was measured using ImageJ. Error bars denote standard deviations of results from at least 5 leaves. (Bottom) Total RNA was extracted from \"spots\" for Northern blotting (middle) and quantified by RT-qPCR using p14 as a reference. Error bars denote standard errors of results from 3 biological replicates (**, P \u03fd 0.01 [unpaired t test]). Translational efficiencies (TE%) were calculated by dividing the mean GFP intensity by the mean mRNA accumulation under each set of conditions, with Mock (-) set at 100%. (C) Effect of p26 expression on GFP-3=UTR PEMV transcript levels in the absence of NMD. GFP-3=UTR PEMV was coinfiltrated with p14 and U1D and either Mock (-) or HA-tagged p26 (HA-p26). At 48 hpi, GFP fluorescence was visualized (left), and GFP mRNA levels were determined by Northern blotting (center) and RT-qPCR (right). Error bars denote standard errors. Paired t tests from 5 leaves were used for \"\u03e9U1D\" (**, P \u03fd 0.01). Data representing GFP mRNA levels in the presence of NMD are included as a reference (stripes).

Ribulose bis-phosphate carboxylase was used as a loading control. (Right) Quantification of results from two independent experiments. Error bars denote standard deviations. GFP protein levels seen in the presence of NMD are included for comparison (stripes).

U1D is a dominant-negative UPF1 bearing an arginine-to-cysteine mutation in the conserved RNA helicase domain (R863C) that strongly interferes with NMD (11) . Background-adjusted GFP intensity was measured after 48 h in the infiltrated spots, and total RNA was isolated for Northern analysis and RT-qPCR. Compared to Mock samples, p26 increased accumulation of NMD-sensitive GFP-3=UTR PEMV and GFP-L transcripts by 4-fold and 3-fold, respectively (Fig. 2B, bottom) . Similarly, U1D increased accumulation of GFP-3=UTR PEMV and GFP-L transcripts by 6.1-fold and 2.7-fold, respectively (Fig. 2B, bottom) . In contrast, NMD-resistant GFP-S transcript levels were not enhanced by the presence of either p26 or U1D.",

Percentages of translational efficiencies (TE%) were determined by dividing the mean GFP intensities by the mean relative mRNA accumulation under each condition. In the presence of p26, GFP-3=UTR PEMV and GFP-L had TE% values of 48% and 54%, respectively, while the presence of U1D had only a minor effect (Fig. 2B) . Importantly, p26 did not decrease the TE% of NMD-resistant GFP-S transcripts, demonstrating that in vivo, p26 represses translation only of NMD targets with long 3= UTRs and does not cause global translation inhibition (Fig. 2B ). To determine if p26 directly inhibits translation in an in vitro assay, C-terminal histidine-tagged p26 (p26-His 6 ) was preincubated (10:1 molar ratio) with transcripts from a previously described luciferase reporter construct (5=89 \u03e9 3U; contains the PEMV2 5= 89 nt and 3= UTR) (43) , and translation was assayed for in wheat germ extracts (WGE). p26-His 6 reduced translation of 5=89 \u03e9 3U by over 4-fold compared to buffer of otherwise identical composition (see Text S1 and Fig. S1A in the supplemental material). p26 also reduced translation of a polyadenylated control RNA that lacks a 3= UTR (Fig. S1A) , indicating that translation inhibition is not restricted to transcripts with PEMV2 sequences. Similar observations have been made for cellular RNA-binding proteins that render transcripts inaccessible to the translation machinery or interfere with translating ribosomes (44) . Interestingly, p26 inhibited translation of both the NMD-resistant and NMD-sensitive reporters in vitro, but only the NMD-sensitive transcripts bearing long 3= UTRs were translationally repressed in vivo (Fig. 2B) .",

In the presence of U1D, HA-p26 increased GFP-3=UTR PEMV mRNA levels by 70% (versus 300% with active NMD), suggesting that p26-mediated protection is mainly but not exclusively associated with NMD (Fig. 2C ). Alternatively, it remains possible that the 70% increase in GFP-3=UTR PEMV mRNA levels seen with HA-p26 expression is attributable to incomplete NMD inhibition by U1D. While HA-p26 increased mRNA levels by 70%, translation of GFP was not significantly increased (Fig. 2D) , supporting the proposal that p26 was reducing the translational efficiency of NMD-sensitive transcripts.",

However, the relative (2-fold) increase in PEMV2\u0394p26 gRNA levels seen under conditions of NMD inhibition (\u03e9U1D) was comparable to the level seen with the WT (Fig. 2E ) and was not disproportionately higher (i.e., 4-fold) than that required to reach absolute levels equal to the WT levels (Fig. 2B ). This suggests that NMD inhibition alone is insufficient to compensate for the deleterious effects of the loss of p26 expression, demonstrating that p26 is a multifunctional protein involved in additional aspects of PEMV2 replication aside from NMD protection and long-distance trafficking.",

Long-distance movement of GRV gRNA requires intracellular transport of pORF3 to the nucleolus for interaction with fibrillarin nucleolar protein (32, 33) . To determine if nucleolar localization of p26 is required for protection of NMD-sensitive transcripts, 6 arginines that are necessary for nucleolar localization of pORF3 (45) and conserved in p26 (Fig. S2) were mutated to asparagine, generating \"RN\"-designated mutants (Fig. 3A) . WT p26 and p26-RN were C-terminally fused with GFP and inserted in place of the capsid protein ORF in a TMV expression vector that generates TMV gRNA that is incapable of systemic movement (46) . TMV expressing either p26-GFP or p26-RN-GFP was subjected to infiltration into N. benthamiana leaves, and local leaves were imaged by fluorescence microscopy 5 to 7 days later. Both p26-GFP and p26-RN-GFP formed large cytoplasmic inclusion bodies in infected cells that were similar in size to those seen in DAPI (4=,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole)-stained nuclei (Fig. 3B, left two panels) . The vast majority of p26-GFP and p26-RN-GFP was observed in the cytoplasm, supporting the earlier report that in \u03f397% of cells, GRV pORF3-GFP was detected only in the cytoplasm (45) . However, in \u03f31% of cells, p26-GFP localized to the nucleus, whereas p26-RN-GFP was always exclusively cytoplasmic/perinuclear (Fig. 3B, right) . Coexpression of p26-GFP and red fluorescent protein (RFP)-tagged DCP1 (a P-body marker) revealed that the p26 inclusion bodies were spatially separate from the P-bodies (Fig. 3C) , which are considered to be major sites of NMD decay in plants (6, 7) . Only p26-GFP was able to efficiently complement the defect in systemic movement of the TMV vector (Fig. S1B) , confirming the previously reported detrimental effect of the pORF3 RN mutations on systemic movement of GRV (45) . Leaves were subjected to infiltration with p14, GFP-3=UTR PEMV , and HA-p26, HA-p26-RN, or U1D. (Bottom) After 48 hpi, total RNA was extracted to assay for GFP mRNA levels by RT-qPCR.

Transcripts whose levels increased \u03fe1.8-fold when NMD was inhibited by U1D were considered possible NMD targets (Fig. 4A, blue) (n \u03ed 3,801) . Approximately 10% of the unique transcripts detected in this study showed \u03fe1.8-fold increases in transcript abundance with U1D, which is similar to what was observed with NMD inhibition mediated by upf1 knockdown or knockout in multiple eukaryotic systems (48) (49) (50) (51) (52) . Twenty percent of transcripts whose abundance increased \u03fe1.8-fold with NMD inhibition also showed \u03fe1.8-fold-increased abundance with HA-p26, and 34% of these NMD-sensitive transcripts showed \u03fe1.8-fold-increased abundance during PEMV2 infection (Fig. 4A) . Arabidopsis NMD targets were previously found to be involved in diverse biological processes (50) . Similarly, GO term enrichment analysis of transcripts upregulated \u03fe1.8-fold under all three sets of conditions resulted in few enriched processes but included macromolecule and protein modification as well as lipid and protein metabolism (Text S1 and Fig. S4 ; see also Data Set S2). Components of the NMD pathway whose transcripts are degraded by NMD as part of an autoregulatory system (SMG7, SMG9, UPF1, and UPF3) and EJC component CASC3 (53, 54) were selected for further RT-qPCR analysis. NMD inhibition (\u03e9U1D) and PEMV2 infection resulted in increased transcript levels for SMG7, SMG9, UPF1, UPF3, and CASC3, whereas HA-p26 expression increased transcript levels only for SMG7, SMG9, and UPF3 (Fig. 4B ). This suggests that HA-p26 and, to a greater extent, PEMV2 virus protect natural NMD targets from decay.",

The representation factor (r-factor) represents the number of shared genes divided by the expected number of shared genes from two independent groups, where a value of \u03fe1 indicates a higher degree of overlap than expected.

The lack of any correlation between the expression profiles of \u03e9HA-p26 and \u03e9U1D suggests that the presence of p26 alone does not cause global NMD inhibition but instead protects a defined subset of NMD targets.

Despite the availability of only limited data from reporter assays showing a link between 3= UTR length and NMD sensitivity (Fig. 2B) , examination of the entire transcriptome showed that the transcripts that were increasing in abundance in the presence of U1D did not have significantly longer 3= UTRs (Fig. 5A) .

Transcripts with increased abundance with HA-p26 expression had slightly longer 3= UTRs than downregulated transcripts (Fig. 5A ). Both NMD targets (UP U1D) and transcripts protected by HA-p26 (UP p26) had 3= UTRs that showed significantly higher GC-rich levels than were seen with the downregulated genes (Down U1D and Down p26) (Fig. 5B) .

Only the first 100 nt of the 3= UTRs were examined since the region immediately downstream of the stop codon is the primary location for NMD-resistant motifs (22, 58) . The only motif whose level was significantly enriched was a polypyrimidine hexamer among NMD-resistant transcripts (Fig. S6) . This observation supports earlier work demonstrating that polypyrimidine tracts near a PTC can bind PTBP1 and confer NMD resistance (21) .

            "text": "RNA viruses must protect their viral genomes from RNA degradation pathways for successful amplification. NMD is triggered by long 3= UTRs (\u03fe300-nt-long 3= UTRs in N. benthamiana [11] ), making most plant RNA viruses susceptible to this degradation pathway. Despite a fundamental requirement to circumvent NMD, little is known about how plant RNA viruses protect their genomes. TCV and other carmoviruses contain a ribosome readthrough recoding element that likely protects their gRNA and a short (\u03f350-nt) unstructured region that protects their coat protein/silencing suppressorencoding 1.45-kb sgRNA (22) . The PEMV2 frameshift recoding site also likely confers some protection to the gRNA, and p26 binding to the region downstream of p94 may confer additional protection. During natural infections, enamovirus PEMV1 (GenBank accession no. NC_003629) RNA would be accessible to p26 and, as seen with PEMV2, translation termination after the PEMV1 RNA-dependent RNA polymerase ORF leaves a 1,896-nt 3= UTR. Therefore, p26 might be beneficial for PEMV1 during coinfections by protecting PEMV1 gRNAs from NMD. Unlike results observed previously for some carmoviruses (22) , no cis-acting sequences protect the critical PEMV2 sgRNA, which encodes p26 and p27. We suggest that a novel form of protection of viral and host mRNAs against NMD is conferred by the trans-acting p26 long-distance MP on the basis of the following findings. (i) p26 expression alone protected NMD-sensitive transcripts from NMD (Fig. 2B) . (ii) A significant number of NMD-susceptible host transcripts with long, GC-rich 3= UTRs increased in accumulation in the presence of p26 or PEMV2 (Fig. 4) . In vivo, p26 repressed translation only of NMD-sensitive transcripts with long 3= UTRs (Fig. 2B) but repressed translation of all tested transcripts in vitro (see Fig. S1A in the supplemental material). A possible explanation is that under conditions of p26 or downregulated (non-NMD target) with U1D or HA-26 were examined using a cumulative distribution function (CDF) plot. P values represent the significance level of data from a two-sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov test for each data set. (B) CDF plots representing the GC% content of 3= UTRs from upregulated and downregulated transcripts with U1D or p26 expression. (C) Box plots represent the 3= UTR lengths for transcripts with \u03fe40% 3= UTR GC content. The horizontal line represents the median, while the upper and lower box edges represent the 90th and 10th percentiles, respectively. A value of \u03fe1.8-fold change in abundance was used as a cutoff for both upregulated and downregulated transcripts. P values are from a two-sided Kruskal-Wallis test performed to determine whether samples originated from the same distribution. (D) Minimum folding energies (MFE) of the 3= UTRs (100-nt window size) of upregulated and downregulated transcripts were calculated using RNAslider (77) . (E) Upstream ORFs (uORFs) were identified in annotated N. benthamiana transcripts using getorf (emboss). CDF plots for adjusted P values for transcripts with \u03fe0.9-fold change are shown for transcripts with and without uORFs from the U1D and HA-p26 RNA-seq data sets.",

A similar observation was previously reported regarding UPF1 binding (12) , where long 3= UTRs were found to be heavily associated with UPF1 in vivo whereas short 3= UTRs were shown to be insufficient for UPF1 binding.

It remains unclear if p26 association with viral RNAs is reversible and whether viral RNAs in p26 inclusion bodies are replication competent (i.e., accessible to the RNAdependent RNA polymerase and other components necessary for replication). MPs from diverse plant viruses may also confer NMD resistance to viral and host transcripts in addition to virus trafficking. Plant virus MPs in general are nonspecific RNA-binding proteins and thus may also provide protection to noncognate RNAs. In addition, the dianthovirus Red clover necrotic mosaic virus contains a 35-kDa MP that forms RNaseresistant RNP complexes (60) , which would likely also be immune to UPF1 surveillance.",

            "text": "Using a transcriptome-wide approach, we demonstrated that both PEMV2 infection and expression of p26 alone protect a substantial (up to 48%) portion of NMD-targeted transcripts. Due to the high degree of overlap of upregulated and downregulated transcripts during PEMV2 infection and U1D-mediated NMD inhibition (Fig. 4) , we suggest that NMD inhibition is a major factor in driving the transcriptome-wide changes in gene expression observed during PEMV2 infection. Interestingly, genes involved in lipid metabolism were disproportionately upregulated upon NMD inhibition, p26 expression, or PEMV2 infection (Fig. S4) . Tombusviruses have been shown to modulate lipid metabolism to promote the assembly of virus replicase complexes on peroxisome membranes (61) (62) (63) . In the present study, transcripts encoding the class III peroxidase superfamily proteins PER4 and PER15 (64) , as well as the critical peroxisome biogenesis protein PEX12 (65), were upregulated under all conditions (see Data Set S2 in the supplemental material). These data suggest that NMD inhibition by PEMV2 could Earlier studies demonstrated that UPF1 targets transcripts with GC-rich 3= UTRs (9, 10) , and both U1D and p26 were identified as preferentially protected transcripts with GC-rich 3= UTRs in the present study (Fig. 5B) . p26 expression alone led to increased transcript abundance for 30% of host NMD targets (versus 48% during PEMV2 infection), suggesting that PEMV2 may have additional anti-NMD properties. In silencingsuppressed N. benthamiana, PEMV2 gRNA accumulates to rRNA levels (Fig. S3C ) and the extraordinary amount of viral RNA in the late stages of an infection might also enhance NMD inhibition by serving as a sink for binding to and sequestering UPF1 and possibly additional NMD factors (Fig. 6, right) . Considering the amount of PEMV2 RNA present during an established infection, endogenous UPF1 is unlikely to have any substantial effect on PEMV2 accumulation; however, NMD surveillance would be severely impaired due to a lack of free UPF1 (Fig. 6, right) .",

In contrast, several host proteins confer NMD resistance when bound immediately downstream of a NMD-sensitive stop codon. PABPC1 binds poly(A) tracts and inhibits NMD when tethered immediately downstream of a PTC (66), while PTBP1 blocks UPF1 association by binding polypyrimidine tracts in the same region (21) .

Furthermore, the NMD pathway as a whole is largely dysfunctional during PEMV2 infection and that disfunctionality could be the driving force behind the large-scale changes in gene expression observed during virus infections. It remains unclear if RNA viruses directly benefit from host gene expression changes resulting from NMD inhibition, and future work will be aimed at examining the interplay between RNA virus replication and NMD inhibition.",

To avoid the presence of sequencing artifacts at the 5= ends, the first 9 nucleotides were also removed. Sequence reads shorter than 20 nt or orphan reads were eliminated prior to a final quality check with FastQC.

The replicase-associated protein (p33) and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (p94) (generated by ribosome frameshifting prior to the p33 termination codon) are translated from the gRNA, whereas the cell-to-cell and long-distance MPs (p27 and p26, respectively) are translated from a sgRNA that contains a 704-nt 3= UTR. Full-length transcripts of PEMV2 synthesized from the Cauliflower mosaic virus (CaMV) 35S promoter following agroinfiltration of N. benthamiana are capable of replication and movement independently of a helper virus(74); however, the enamovirus Pea enation mosaic virus 1 (PEMV1) is required for encapsidation and for transmission from RNA silencing suppressor from TBSV expressed from a Tobacco etch virus (TEV) translation enhancer, or PZP with p26 or the PEMV2 p33 replication-required protein was subjected to agroinfiltration along with PZP-GFP.

Since nearly 50% of all natural NMD targets increase in abundance during PEMV2 infection, the virus likely severely impairs the NMD pathway. This impairment likely accounts for a major portion of the substantial transcriptome differences evident during PEMV2 infection, which are also a hallmark of other virus-infected plants.",
