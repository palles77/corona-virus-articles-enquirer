An interesting extension of these older findings was made relatively recently when it was demonstrated that nonimmunogenic adjuvants, such as mineral oil with no content of microbial products, could also, by themselves, induce arthritis in certain arthritis-susceptible strains of rats after a single intradermal or subcutaneous injection at the root of the tail (4) .",

In the shoulder region of DA rats, a 2-cm2 area was shaved and lightly abrased with sandpaper during ether anesthesia.

The variation in arthritogenicity evident between various commercial products indicates that such modifications may occur, and we do not know if the quantitative content of mineral oil in a commercial product is the only factor determining arthritogenicity in the present experimental system. A second conclusion is that at least one of the mineral oil-containing products intended for application on skin can induce arthritis in the DA rat after being applied by a method similar to that recommended for use by humans (percutaneously). We carried out this provocation on mildly abrased skin, as this procedure has previously been shown to enhance the arthritogenic effects of percutaneous exposure of mineral oil present in FIA (5) . The product that has the capacity to induce polyarthritis after either intradermal or percutaneous exposure still did not induce any irritative reaction measurable by macroscopic or microscopic investigation. This is in line with our previous observation that the effects of these nonimmunogenic adjuvants occur mainly in the regional lymph nodes (12, 13) in which the adjuvants cause activation of T lymphocytes, which have a capacity to subsequently induce arthritis (14) . This also means, however, that such substances appear to be able to induce arthritis, at least after being applied to irritated skin, without giving rise to any types of local irritative reaction of the kind that are used to screen commercial cosmetic products for potential irritation or other adverse effects.",
