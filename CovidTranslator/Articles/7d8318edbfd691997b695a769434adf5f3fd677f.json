After that, filtration applications in respiratory protection, dust collection, and engine in-take air cleaning are elaborated. These are the areas that the author sees as the typical needed ones in China's fast pace economical development endeavor, where air filtration enables the protection of human health, environment and equipment for sustainability.",

These aerosols affect visibility, climate and human health and quality of life. For example, pollen, bacteria and virus carrying aerosols, if inhaled, could lead to severe breathing problem, lung infection and other sicknesses. Particulate and oil mist emissions from engine tail pipe and engine crank case ventilation system are carcinogens, thus are highly regulated in developed countries. Cabin air must be cleaned to remove aerosols and odors inside an airplane to create a healthy environment for the passengers. Meanwhile, aerosol particles are very damageable to machinery relying on clean air or liquid for operation. One straight example is engine intake air for combustion. The many particulate contaminants in air, if not filtered out before introduction to the combustion chamber, could cause non-reversible engine damage instantaneously, especially in a dusty environment engine operates, such as desert, mining plant, construction areas where a fair amount of flying dusts exist.",

Prof. Jiayong Chen (formerly Chia-yung Chen) had made significant contribution to filtration theory in his 1955 publication as mentioned earlier [2] , where he established a semi-empirical screen model to account for interference effect of neighboring fibers. His model is considered as one of the milestones of aerosol filtration theory and has been cited for more than 150 times (SCI statistics), including 12 citations in the 21 century. His work covered aerosol removal mechanisms through direct interception, Brownian diffusion and the force of inertia impaction, which is critical to designing air filters with low pressure drop and high filtration efficiency that is practiced routinely today. However, at the time Prof. Chen conducted his work in University of Illinois-Urbana in early 1950s, the understanding of these major mechanisms and quantifying them by mathematical modeling with experimental verification, and by taking into account fiber interaction on pressure drop and capture efficiency in the model, was a very big accomplishment. As previously, sieving was naturally thought to be the main mechanism for particle separation from a gas stream using fibrous media, which was later proven probably the least important for small aerosol particle separation before a surface cake is established. Once the cake is formed, sieving becomes dominant and a filter's life quickly ends because of high pressure drop rise across the filter media.",

Taking reverse air for example, air flow gives the bag its structure. Dirty air flows through the bag from the inside, allowing dust to collect on the interior surface. During cleaning, gas flow is restricted from a specific compartment. Without the flowing air, the bags relax. The cylindrical bag contains rings that prevent it from completely collapsing under the pressure of the reverse air. A fan blows clean air in the reverse direction. The relaxation and reverse air flow cause the dust cake to crumble and release into the hopper. Upon the completion of the cleaning process, dirty air flow continues and the bag regains its shape. Recent advances in dust collection system design focus on baghouse material optimization for easier cleaning and extended service life, and the use of cartridge filters to replace the baghouse and minimize the size of the dust collector while maintaining the same efficiency and capacity for energy, material, as well as operational cost saving.",

The fluted and pleated in-line, reduced-volume filters, provide high filtration performance while occupying less space. In these designs, almost the entire volume of the filter housing accommodates the filter media. The use of nanofibers on the media surface has allowed the thickness and density of the media to be reduced thereby decreasing the pressure losses through the media and the amount of material used. These nanofibers also show very high initial efficiency compared to standard cellulose media which only achieves its targeted efficiency level after it has built up a sufficient dust cake on its surface. Figure 12 shows an air induction system, in which nanofiber media is used in the air filter. However, nanofiber filter media is not an emerging technology any more [16] . It was first introduced for industrial application in 1981. It reached on and off road diesel engine application in 1993. In 1995, the self-cleaning pulse jet air cleaner was developed for military applications in high dust concentration environment. There are still challenges such as cost, chemical compatibility, durability, nanofiber layer adhesion and uniformity, and some hazards associated with solvent removal and disposal. As the use of nanofiber filter media expends, these manufacturing issues are being aggressively addressed.",

The major players include Cummins, Mann-Hummel and Baldwin, and their products are pictured in Fig. 13 [16]. These highly compacted filter system are becoming even smaller and lighter today due to OEM's (original equipment manufacturers) requirement to fully use the hood space and integrate multiple mechanical and electrical functionalities for fuel economy and emission reduction. In the foreseeable future, these technologies are expected to be used in the majority of new built diesel engines for both on-road and off-road vehicles to meet the ever stringent emission regulations worldwide.",

            "text": "Aerosol filtration has seen enormous advancement in the past decades based on customers' increasing demand for small size, high efficiency, and low pressure drop of a filtration system. Emission regulation also drives the evolution of filter media technology as well as filter configuration optimization. It is anticipated that the demand can only become stronger for human health protection and sustainable growth. Since filtration systems are to be challenged by different aerosol contaminants in different environment in the real world, developing robust filtration technology with better flexibility and functionality without significantly increasing the cost is expected to be the future trend. However, this can only be achieved by applying the existing knowledge, understanding the limitation of current technology, and interfacing with other disciplines to explore the possibility of the next big thing in aerosol filtration. In my personal opinion, breakthrough technologies may come from three aspects: (a) a deeper level of aerosol characterization, not only to understand its size and size distribution, but also to learn about its chemical-physical properties, especially for bio-aerosol that threatens human health directly; (b) fiber technology. Nanofibers will be further explored in terms of method, material capability and cost reduction. However, nanofiber with purposely designed functionalities such as anti-microbial, structural features and environmental compatibility are something major to consider; (c) media technology. This looks like an extension of fiber technology on the surface, but they do differ significantly in that media technology covers more ground and is more complicated. Process engineering is pivotal to the success of filter media making in order to gain specific media properties consistently to meet the various requirements. Disruptive technologies may come from new process design and process integration based on, but not necessarily limited to the already existing technologies such as dry and wet laid, spunbond, meltspinning, electrospinning, meltblowing, as well as fiber splitting to take advantage of multicomponent fibers for filtration.",
