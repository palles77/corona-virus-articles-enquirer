They satisfy the necessary and suf ficient conditions for formation of RNA thermometers and are highly conservative uncanonical structures, since these highly conservative structures were found in the genome of all 25 isolates of S. enterica.

Nucleic acids are known to melt at increasing temperature. Thus, a temperature shift may modulate the conformation of the regulatory RNA molecules, i.e., transition of molecular frag ments from a hairpin conformation to a single stranded state. A number of the presently known structurally and functionally different RNA thermometers control a variety of cellular processes. All the known molecular thermometers, both cis and trans acting, control translation by the isolation of the ribosome binding site; most of them are localized in the 5' UTR of heat shock or virulence genes.

Temperature is one of the key environmental parameters controlled by RpoS, while DsrA Bb , a small noncoding RNA molecule, regulates the temperature dependent increase in RpoS content. It was suggested [4] that DsrA Bb at 23\u00b0C forms a stable double stranded structure, preventing pairing with the rpoS transcript. Increase in temperature results in melting of the RNA molecule and disruption of its secondary structure, which leads to the binding of the anti SD region by the mRNA rpoS. This may stimulate transla tion by exclusion of the SD sequence and the site of translation initiation from the double stranded struc ture in mRNA rpoS under virulence initiation condi tions (37\u00b0C).",

It has a relatively complex secondary structure, including two to four hairpin loop structures, one of which contains the SD sequence and sometimes also the AUG start codon.

Its predicted structure contains two hairpins, with four uridine res idues forming nucleotide pairs with the SD sequence ( Fig. 1 ). Temperature dependent melting of one of the hairpins was confirmed experimentally. Binding of the ribosome with the SD sequence was found to occur only at the heat shock temperatures.",

This implies that still unknown types of RNA thermome ters should therefore exist. Bioinformatics analysis provided confirmations of this hypothesis [8] . Synthe sis of efficient artificial RNA thermometers was another confirmation of this hypothesis [9, 10] . The specifics of the molecular mechanism of bacterial sen sitivity to temperature fluctuations remain, however, incompletely understood. The results of our computer analysis of the chro mosomal DNA sequences of different S. enterica iso lates (obtained from the databases) confirmed the absence of 4U RNA thermometer similar to those pre dicted in [6] (Fig. 1) for the agsA gene of S. enterica and experimentally confirmed in vivo and in vitro for three out of the 25 analyzed isolates (NC_011147, NC_011274, and NC_006511). Since pathogenic microorganisms need to survive and replicate under divers conditions, including temperature fluctuations which may originate from the temperature differences between the environment and the host organisms, in pathogens the relevant mechanisms evolve, which were responsible for the regulation of gene expression and which have RNA thermometers among their ele ments. Since 4U RNA thermometers were not found in some Salmonella isolates, certain temperature sen sitive elements other than 4U RNA thermometers and probably other than the ROSE elements may exist in these strains.",

On the AFM image of pUC8 DNA on amino mica (Fig. 2) , the hairpins were visible as clearly delin eated projections on the DNA strands, so that their length was measurable directly on the image. Analysis of our results showed that 11-12 bp were involved in hairpin formation, while thermodynamic analysis of inverted repeats confirmed that the hairpin was formed by 26 nucleotides and had the free energy \u0394G = -17.8 kcal/mol. RNA molecules visualized by AFM usually look like condensed structures in most studies. We have previously visualized RNA transcripts immobilized on mica, which formed rod like condensed structures 122 \u00b1 10 nm long with the 4.5-5 length to width ratio [27] . We think that visualization of stretched uncon densed RNA molecules containing hairpin loop structures requires changing surface properties of the substrate (mica). The mentioned morphological fea tures of the RNA molecules visualized by AFM may result from a significant effect of the surface properties of the mica on which the RNA transcripts were immo bilized. The surface properties of the substrate, in turn, depend on the hydrophobicity and density of the cat ions localized on the mica surface. It should be noted that for visualization of RNA molecules, the same mica is used as for visualization of DNA molecules, i.e., the one with hydrophobicity and cation surface density preventing formation of condensed structures by linear and supercoiled double stranded DNA mol ecules immobilized on the surface, but rather favors the uniform distribution of the DNA fragments. We have shown earlier that small variations in the hydro phobicity and cation density on the mica surface may result in significantly altered morphology of immobi lized DNA molecules [28, 29] .",
