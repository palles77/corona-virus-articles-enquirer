A subunit vaccine candidate directed against porcine transmissible gastroenteritis virus and expressed in corn seed has been developed for oral delivery to swine. Here, we show that this vaccine, when administered to previously sensitized gilts, can boost neutralizing antibody levels in the animals' serum, colostrum and milk.

In the case of human vaccines, avoiding the use of needles reduces equipment costs, removes the requirement for trained medical personnel to supervise delivery and eliminates safety concerns associated with needle disposal. The economic benefits of oral over parenteral delivery are also apparent with animal vaccines, where equipment and labor costs can be substantially reduced. Also, in the cases of farmed animals destined for meat markets, carcass quality may be compromised by repeated injections and oral vaccines overcome this concern. Subunit vaccines are generally considered to have a low safety risk since they are well defined and do not contain attenuated or inactivated pathogens with the potential for adverse affects. Thus, oral delivery of subunit vaccines is a particularly attractive option for safe, inexpensive vaccination programs.",

Protective efficacy has also been recorded with some of these vaccine candidates in model species trials (reviewed in [1] ). A few plant-based vaccine candidates have advanced into early phase human clinical trials or target animal trials. Among human vaccines, these include those directed against travelers' diarrhea and Norwalk virus delivered in potato tubers [5, 6] , against hepatitis B virus delivered in lettuce leaves [7] and against rabies virus delivered in spinach leaves, themselves infected with a recombinant plant virus [8] . Immune responses were observed during these trials, and although there were some reports of nausea, presumably resulting from the administration of up to 150 g of unprocessed, unpalatable plant material, the vaccine candidates were generally well tolerated. In the case of farmed animals, a corn-based vaccine directed against transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) can induce protective immunity in piglets [9, 10] .",

The chosen plant material must also be ready for direct administration or must be suitable for inexpensive processing into an appropriate form for oral delivery to the target species. Much of the work to date on plant expression systems has been conducted using tobacco leaf tissue (discussed in [11] ). However, tobacco leaves are inedible, and therefore protein extraction is required prior to delivery. Several edible options have also been pursued, including the tubers and leaves of certain vegetable crops such as potato and lettuce, respectively [5] [6] [7] . Some fruits, such as bananas, are also being considered. However, perishable items are not practical for extended storage and expression levels can vary considerably between, for example, potato tubers taken from a single harvest [5, 6] .",

They have low water contents and naturally store proteins over long periods of time without degradation. Corn (Zea mays) is an especially attractive option because of its intensively studied genetics and the availability of established transformation procedures. Several vaccine candidate antigens have been expressed at high levels in corn seed and the proteins are stable when stored in this tissue for periods of at least a year and probably for much longer, obviating the requirement for a cold chain during distribution and storage [10] . Furthermore, the antigen concentration is uniform across a corn grain harvest, facilitating even dosing [3] . A wide range of processing alternatives have been developed by the food and feed industries to convert corn grain into readily edible forms and pilot-scale processes have been developed that ensure antigens are not degraded during processing [12] .

In brief, sequence encoding the S protein was synthesized with optimal codon usage for expression in Z. mays. An N-terminal cell surface targeting signal was included to direct accumulation of the protein to the cell wall. DNA encoding the S protein was introduced into immature zygotic Z. mays embryos by Agrobacterium tumefaciens mediated transformation and selection was imposed for transgenic callus. Transgenic plants with sequence encoding the S protein integrated into the nucleus were regenerated, and those expressing the highest levels of the S protein were taken through a plant-breeding scheme to increase and stabilize expression levels. This culminated in a large-scale grain harvest in which the S protein was present at 13 mg kg \u22121 , as determined using a sandwich enzyme linked immunosorbent assay [9] . At this concentration a practical antigen dose of 20-30 mg can be delivered in an amount of corn material easily consumed at a single feeding.",

Milk antibodies of the IgG class have typically disappeared within 48 h of farrowing, so the neutralizing antibody activities observed in milk samples collected 3 days after farrowing most likely reflect IgA levels. Protection against TGEV amongst nursing piglets has been linked to IgA levels [14] , indicating that the corn-based TGEV vaccine is inducing an immune response with the potential to confer protection.
