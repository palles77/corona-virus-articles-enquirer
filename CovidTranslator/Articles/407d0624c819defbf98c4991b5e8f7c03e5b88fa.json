The real-time estimation involves a number of important statistical problems to consider, and this chapter comprehensively describes commonly used estimation methods and their pitfalls. When estimating the case fatality risk (CFR) during the course of an epidemic, the data are right-censored because of the time delay from illness onset to death. A conventional survival analysis technique is employed for addressing right censoring. Identification of risk factors of death also requires the care for censored nature of the data, and we have devised a method that combines the survival analysis and logistic regression. Ascertainment bias is always a practical issue in interpreting the absolute value of the CFR or comparing CFR between different groups, and recent studies have shown that observational effort including seroepidemiological survey has to be made to overcome this bias.",

The virulence, i.e., the severity of infection, is assessed at a population level by estimating the case fatality risk (CFR), which is also referred to as the case fatality ratio or the case fatality rate abbreviated as the same, but we use the case fatality risk throughout this chapter due to its epidemiological nature to represent the risk (Kelly and Cowling, 2013) . CFR is defined as the risk of deaths from an infectious disease among the total number of cases (Ma and van den Driessche, 2008) . The virulence could be partly assessed by experimentally exploring specific molecular markers of the pathogen that should be known to be associated with severe complications, but available scientific evidence seldom rests on human infection, and moreover, the absence of such information during the early course of an epidemic always imposes substantial uncertainty.",

Although not covered in this chapter, our method relying on the logistic model with linear predictor enabled us not only to identify epidemiological determinants of MERS death but also to examine the time-dependent variation in CFR due to an increased case ascertainment rate influenced by extensive contact tracing efforts. We have shown that cases among senior persons under treatment were at particularly high risk of MERS death. That is, marked similarities between MERS and SARS were identified, as the CFR for MERS among patients aged 60 years or older under treatment was estimated as high as 48.2% (95% CI: 35.2, 61.3), while the CFR for younger healthy individuals was less than 15%. Compared to earlier models, the proposed model was shown to be advantageous in handling small sample data. By imposing an assumption that the heterogeneous risk of death is captured by the linear predictor of the logit model in (10), our approach was able to successfully identify risk factors from very small samples (i.e., 185 cases and 36 deaths) for the MERS outbreak in the Republic of Korea, and that identification can be put into practice in real time.",

First, comparison of multiple CFR estimates is always more informative than subjectively judging the absolute value of single CFR estimate (Nishiura et al., 2010) . The CFR estimate for the entire population is regarded as a summary measure of virulence, so the reduced order of virulence (approximately by a factor of 10) provides not only more accurate information but a more useful measure for assessing the impact of this pandemic. Nevertheless, knowledge based on additional information would be even more useful. Ideally, we would like to compare epidemiologically the virulence between different settings (e.g., comparison between age groups or countries) and to use this knowledge in the development of relevant public health policy. Understanding the heterogeneous risks of death by age and risk groups is critical in the effective design of intervention strategies. In other words, apart from discussing the changing assessment of the CFR as a whole, CFR i for age group i is probably more informative than CFR for the entire population (Nishiura, 2010b) . In this regard, a method for estimating relative case fatality was proposed elsewhere (Reich et al., 2012) .",

            "text": "Second, we cannot sometimes rely on case data due to heavy involvement of ascertainment bias. The 2009 influenza pandemic evoked a new concept in appropriately describing the virulence using a clearly defined denominator population (Nishiura, 2010a) . Comparing the confirmed CFR (cCFR) and symptomatic CFR (sCFR) estimates, it is likely that the substantial difference between them is mostly attributable to the size of the denominator population. That is, statistical estimation of the CFR involves not only the tendency to underestimate the CFR due to the time delay from illness onset to death, but also the risk of overestimation due to the difficulty in ascertaining all the cases, which tend to be biased toward severely affected patients. Confirmed cases represent only a small fraction of symptomatic cases, and thus, while diagnostic coverage is less than 100%, the cCFR will always be larger than the sCFR. It should also be noted that only a portion of infected individuals develop symptoms. In an analysis of metadata of experimental challenge with interpandemic influenza viruses in humans, it has been shown that approximately one-third of infected individuals remained subclinical throughout the course of infection. Although the evidence is still scarce regarding subclinical infection with the influenza A (H1N1-2009) virus, a population-wide serological study in the United Kingdom indicated that only one-tenth of infected individuals developed an influenza-like illness that required medical attention. If we define the denominator of the CFR as the total number of infected individuals and we refer to it as the infected CFR (iCFR), the iCFR will be 0.1 \u00c2 the sCFR, and the sCFR may be 0.1 \u00c2 the cCFR. In this regard, a method for estimating the so-called infection fatality risk (IFR) was proposed elsewhere (Wong et al., 2013) .",

            "text": "Estimation of IFR is interestingly based on two estimates in the numerator and denominator of the risk calculation. That is, the numerator is informed by the excess mortality due to uncertain number of deaths attributable to influenza, and the denominator is based on seroepidemiological survey of antibody-positive individuals. Due to that complexity of estimation, the timeliness of the estimation has remained very limited. Namely, both the estimation of excess mortality and a snapshot of seroepidemiological survey may be completed at the end of an epidemic, and the estimates of IFR have not necessarily been obtained during the early stage of an epidemic. While many observational efforts (e.g., the use of cohort of exposed individuals in a confined unit) have been made to avoid possible biases with absolute and relative case fatality (Lipsitch et al., 2015) , it remains a big challenge that the most robust and unbiased methods tend to require time and real-time features have yet to be established for those methods.",
