            "text": "Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) was recently demonstrated in the pancreas of about half the patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus in the absence of mumps, rubella or Coxsackie B virus. The present study addresses the question as to whether type 2 diabetes with an HCMV-positive pancreas differs from those with HCMV-negative pancreases with respect to age, sex, treatment, duration of disease, volume densities of B-cells and D-cells, mRNA levels of insulin and somatostatin, islet amyloid peptide deposits and major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I and class II gene transcription, and protein expression. HCMV-positive type 2 diabetic patients showed a tendency towards a shorter duration of disease and significantly increased levels of MHC class II on RNA. In addition, expression of MHC class II product (HLA-DR) was identified in duct epithelial cells and/or islet cells in 9 diabetic pancreases and in 2 non-diabetic glands. No MHC class I expression could be detected. No other clinical differences between HCMV-positive and HCMV-negative glands were found. All 10 HCMV-positive diabetics showed a strong expression of MHC class II mRNA in the pancreas. By immunocytochemistry, 4 of 10 demonstrated expression on the islets; three of ten also expressed MHC DR/3 on ductal cells. This finding might be related to the viral infection, as only 2 of the 9 HCMV-negative patients were HLA-DR/3 positive and none of the non-diabetic controls showed increased levels of MHC class II mRNA. These data suggest that HCMV infection in the pancreas is associated with type 2 diabetes. However, no conclusions as to a role of this virus in the aetiopathology of type 2 diabetes can be drawn at present.",

            "text": "Diabetes mellitus is a syndrome with heterogeneous pathogenesis (K16ppel 1984; Lef6bvre 1988 ) and amongst the various aetiological factors that may be involved in the development of diabetes are viruses (Rayfield et al. 1976; Notkins et al. 1984; Leiter et al, 1989) . From experimental work and studies in children with fatal virus infections, it is known that the encephalomyocarditis virus, and reovirus or Coxsackie B4 viruses can cause necrosis of the endocrine cells of the pancreas (Craighead and Steinke 1971; Jenson et al. 1980; Ujevich and Jaffe 1980; Ahmad and Abraham 1982; Onodera et al. 1983; Yoon et al. 1986; Foulis et al. 1990; Szopa et al. 1990 ). Most pancreases from patients with diabetes, however, lack signs of lytic islet cell necrosis, but display changes that are either compatible with autoimmune destruction of the/3-cells, as in type 1 diabetes (K16ppel et al. 1991) , or B-cell dysfunction, as in type 2 diabetes (K16ppel et al. 1991 ). Yet viruses might still play a role in the pathogenesis of diabetes by either triggering auto-immune B-cell destruction via expression of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) proteins (Bottazzo et al. 1985; Jennings et al. 1985; Foulis and Farquharson 1986; Suzumura etal, 1986; Campbell etal. 1988) or, alternatively, by persisting in B-cells and impairing their specific function (Oldstone et al. 1984; Oldstone 1989) . The latter hypothesis has been investigated in depth in animal studies using lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) and Venezuelan equine encephalitis (VE) virus as models. LCMV infection has been shown to decrease insulin production (Oldstone etal. 1984; Rodriguez et al. 1985) without any evidence of cell injury or inflammation. This was also observed with VE virus (Rayfield et al. 1976 ) and Coxsackie B4 virus (Yoon (Preece et al. 1977) and diabetes (Ginsberg-Fellner et al. 1985) in the absence of any inflammatory or necrotic islet changes. Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) has also been implicated in the aetiology and pathogenesis of diabetes. Diabetes developed in a child with congenital HCMV infection at the age of 13 months (Ward et al. 1979) . Nuclear inclusions in islet cells and insulitis were found in infants who died of disseminated HCMV infection (Hultquist et al. 1973; Jenson et al. 1980) . The HCMV genome was demonstrated in 15% of newly diagnosed type 1 diabetics who had islet cell antibodies as well (Pak et al. 1988 ). In a recent study we found HCMV nucleic acids in the islets of Langerhans in 44% of patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, but not the nucleic acids of mumps, rubella or Coxsackie B (L6hr and Oldstone 1990) . The nucleic acid sequences were detected in fixed, paraffin-embedded pancreatic tissue using slot blot and in situ hybridization as well as polymerase chain reaction derived DNA sequencing. To analyse the significance of this finding for the development of type 2 diabetes further, two subgroups of diabetics were formed from the original study group in which detailed clinical data were available, one HCMV positive and one HCMV negative. These were compared with one another and the healthy controls with regard to several variables such as treatment and duration of diabetes, mRNA levels of insulin and somatostatin, volume density of B-cells and D-cells, transcription of class I and class II MHC genes, protein expression of HLA-DR, and islet amyloidosis.",

The blocks of all 18 controls and the diabetics were subjected to RNA analysis (see below); in 15 of the 18 normoglycaemic patients detailed clinical data were available and blocks of those patients were therefore used for further studies. The clinical criteria for type 2 diabetes mellitus were abnormal glucose tolerance and elevated fasting blood glucose levels. No HLA typing was performed in these patients. Information on clinical data (age, sex, treatment with diet and/or oral hypoglycaemics or with insulin, and duration of diabetes) was extracted from the patients' records and summarized in Table 1 . Ten patients with a duration of the disease between 1 and 24 years received insulin (mean, 5 years). All other patients were treated with diet and/or oral hypoglycaemic drugs.",

Chance, Indianapolis, Ind., USA) and islet amyloid polypeptide (1:2000; rat IAPPtl 2_ 37t, kindly donated by Dr. O. Madsen, Hagedorn Res. Laboratories, Gentofte, Denmark). Class II MHC expression was identified by a monoclonal antibody A II (gift from Dr. A. Foulis, Glasgow, UK). This antibody is known to react with paraffin-embedded tissue (Epenetos et al. 1985; L6hr and K16ppel 1987) and raised against the purified human class II antigens, DR and DQ (Neefjes et al. 1986 ). After deparaffinizing, the endogenous peroxidase was blocked with 3% hydrogen peroxide in methanol. After further rehydration and washes in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), the slides were incubated with 10% normal porcine serum in a humid chamber at room temperature for 30 min. After shaking off the blocking serum, the monoclonal antibodies were applied diluted in PBS containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin. Incubation took place at room temperature for 18 h. After several washes in PBS, the secondary biotinylated antibody (rat anti-mouse IgG, Boehringer Mannheim) was applied at a 1:50 dilution for 30 min at room temperature. After several washes and a 30 min incubation with the avidin-biotin-complex (ABC, Vectastain) at room temperature, the slides were rewashed in PBS, reacted with 2,2 diaminobenzidine, rewashed, dehydrated and mounted for microscopic evaluation. Specificity of the antibodies was demonstrated by systematically including positive and negative controls. Human tonsillar tissue was used as positive control for the HLA-DR antibody. For identification of islet amyloid, sections adjacent to those immunostained for IAPP were stained with Congo red. The percentage of islets containing extracellular IAPP deposits was estimated and graded according to a semi-quantitative score ranging from grade 0 (no extracellular IAPP present in the islets), grade 2 (10 50% of all islets positive for extracellular IAPP) to grade 3 (more than 50% of the islets contain extracellular IAPP).",

Instead, the B-cells showed a tendency towards a decrease in volume density as well as insulin RNA/ribosomal RNA ratio, which rather suggests a reduction in their number.

Why there was no clear relationship between class II MHC mRNA and its product is poorly understood. Technical problems or yet unknown variations in the interplay between transcription and translation may be important. However, the fact that diabetic HCMV-positive pancreases expressed class II MNC mRNA more frequently than HCMV-negative diabetic glands may be related to the fact that viruses are known to induce class I and class II expression (Jennings et al. 1985; Rosenthal et al. 1985; Suzumura et al. 1986; Gaulton et al. 1989) .

Yet its significance for the pathogenesis of the disease is unknown. We found insular IAPP deposits in about 80% of the diabetic pancreases confirming the data of other studies (Westermark et al. 1987; Clark et al. 1990 ), but failed to demonstrate any relationship with the HCMV status in the patients.",
