In response to this, great endeavors have been made by food scientists over the last several decades. Nowadays, uses of food are no longer limited to attainment of satiety (Vitaglionea, Napolitanoa, & Fogliano, 2008) ; the uses of some food products like chitosan have been extended to biotechnological and therapeutic applications (Lai & Lin, 2009) . Today research in food technology spans innumerable fields of inquiry, ranging from product development (Hassan-Zadeh, Sahari, & Barzegar, 2008; Smoliner et al., 2008; Wattanathorn, Chonpathompikunlert, Muchimapura, Priprem, & Tankamnerdthai, 2008) to production management (Liu & Schaffner, 2007; Parkar, Flint, & Brooks, 2004; , from food safety to technology research (G\u00e4nzlea, Loponena, & Gobbettic, 2008; Loveday & Singh, 2008; Siracusaa, Rocculib, Romanib, & Rosa, 2008) .

Overview of the melamine event Melamine (also known as tripolycyanamide) has a number of industrial uses including the production of glues and plastics. According to US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) (2007), the tolerable daily intake (TDI) is around 0.63 mg/kg of a person's weight. There is no approval for direct usage of melamine in food, nor are there any guidelines in the Codex Alimentarius (World Health Organization, 2008); however, as its nitrogen content by mass is up to 66%, melamine was illegally added to watereddown milk in China to boost its apparent protein content as measured by the standard Kjeldahl and Dumas tests.",

Though it surfaced on 11th September, its preliminary symptoms had manifested three months earlier as parental complaints about Sanlu milk powder to AQSIQ (General Administration of Quality Supervision, Inspection and Quarantine). Since July 2008, an abnormally high prevalence of renal stone cases had been discovered among mainland infants; however, no action was taken at that time (Ma, 2008) . Not until later, when the event became public, did the mainland authorities endeavor to mitigate possible public health hazards and penalize the relevant perpetrators. In addition, medical care was provided freeof-charge to affected children under the Minister of Health, and a large-scale food investigation was carried out to comfort panicked parents on the safety of Chinese food. Unfortunately, the panic escalated. By 22nd September, more than 52,857 children had been treated for renal complications and at least 4 had died.",

Hitherto, 10 suspected kidney stone cases pertaining to tainted milk consumption have been found (Centre for Health Protection, 2008). As melamine contamination spread to different brands of milk and milk-containing foods, imports and sales of Chinese dairy products were banned by over 10 countries, including Colombia, Japan, Malaysia, Philippines, Singapore and Taiwan. In the United Kingdom, all Chinese products containing more than 15% milk ingredients were subjected to strict documentary and physical checks (Food Standards Agency, 2008) , whereas in the USA, the government advised citizens traveling to China with children to bring along their own baby food. Consequently, the influence of the food scare extended from public health to economic levels.",

In early October, authorities in China set melamine limits at 1 ppm in infant formula and 2.5 ppm in other products with milk content of 15% or above (such as liquid milk and milk powder). In addition, a new norm regulating the entire chain of dairy production was issued by the State Council, and the addition of illegal substances to fresh milk can now lead to the death penalty.",

The latter were first supported by Hs\u00fcn Tzu and his pupil Han Fei Tzu in around 200 B.C. in China. According to these two philosophers, though human nature is fundamentally evil, it can be made good via education and acculturation (Cai, 1996; Goldin, 1999; Han, 1964 Han, , 1992 Hs\u00fcn-Tzu, 1963) . As proposed by Han (Han, 1964 (Han, , 1992 Zhang, 1974) , one of the most efficient ways to facilitate this process is by law. Regardless of this, legislation can mainly function well as a way to handle the aftermath of an event; its effectiveness in malpractice prevention in the industrial context might not be as significant as perceived. In addition, since the Second World War, there has been a rise in the concept of Taylor's system which stands for the systematic scientific examination of all stages of the manufacturing process via piece-rate bonus schemes and time study of each industrial operation (McNeil, 2002; Taylor, 1947) . This led to an evolutionary change in agricultural and food production practices, leading to blurring of overall responsibility for the entire food manufacturing process, and posing considerable challenges in terms of accountability for food problems in a modern society.",

Despite this, to quote Premier Wen Jibao in a recent public address (Chen, 2008) , ''Many factories and milk dealers are lacking the most fundamental business morals and social responsibility. They are just cold-blooded''; it is human ethics that ultimately determine the boon and bane of food technology, affecting the success of a food safety security system.

Food-related ethical discussion started thousands of years ago. Historical evidence for this traces back to the ancient Greeks, and is evident in literatures left by ancient Roman and early Christian scholars (Zwart, 2000) . A detailed historical development of food ethics was successfully presented by Zwart in 2000, and selected ideas pertaining to food in major historical periods are listed in Table 2 . Despite such early recognition of the importance of ethics in relation to food, most of the effort made in this area is limited to food preparation; as such, exploration of morality in the application of food technology in the industrial context is lacking. Such ignorance, however, appears not to have lowered the importance of food technology ethics. Instead, its social impacts as manifested by the occurrence of food safety problems seem to be urging both the academic and industrial sectors to pay attention to the issue. In fact, along with industrialization and capitalism, cooperative labor tends to be more specialized, thereby widening the distance between food consumption and its production. Under such circumstances, consumers have to place unidirectional trust in the governance structure and safety of the existing agri-food system. This trust relationship is basic to a harmonious society. Violation of it by food suppliers is not only inconsistent with social norms, but also evokes far-reaching distrust of the food system underpinning social stability. In order to uphold the integrity of a society, legitimate practice in the food sector and fulfillment of food security, which according to the FAO (Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, 1996) means that ''all people at all times have access to safe and nutritious food to maintain a healthy and active life'' (Sec. 1.4), are pivotal. And at the most fundamental level of attaining these in corporate and industrial practice, ethical attitudes towards the application of food technologies and related knowledge are at the core.",

In fact, although public good orientation in industrial entities is important, ethics in food technology can never be assumed unless the welfare of primary non-social stakeholders (including the natural environment, future generations and non-species), as named by Wheeler and Sillanpaa (1997) , are taken into account.

Contrary to the deontological approach, it states that the morality of an action is determined by its overall contribution to the utility (i.e. happiness and pleasure) of a society (Goodin, 1995) . This idea was first proposed by Epicurus (DeWitt, 1954; Mitsis, 1988) and was later systematized by Jeremy Bentham, who suggested that pain and pleasure are two constitutional factors governing the operation of a society, hence any actions that could bring the greatest amount of pleasure to people in a community would be ''correct'' and ''good'' (Rosen, 2003) . Utilitarianism is one of the most prevalently used approaches for judgment making in both industrial and commercial sectors. Areas ranging from policy planning to economic analysis are also very often based on utilitarianism, using income or other economic parameters as the measure of welfare or utility (Pinstrup-Andersen, 2005) . From the utilitarian perspective, it is conceivable that applications of food technology and related knowledge in ways that are potentially harmful to public health should be discouraged.",

According to the maxim, each of us is obliged to treat others in the same moral way in which we would like to be treated. This idea signifies the importance of self-discipline and propriety as a way to live, and this empathetic notion is the norm in the social context (Confucius, 1938) but is also applicable to industrial practices. Other major concepts with regard to moral deeds and obligations can be found in the work of Mencius (Mencius, 2003; Shun, 1997) and Mo-Tzu (Mo-Tzu, 1963) . According to Mencius, man is born to have four virtues: ''Benevolence'', ''Righteousness'', ''Courtesy'' and ''Wisdom'', and all social actions performed should be in accordance with these four principles (Mencius, 2003) . For Mo-Tzu (Mo-Tzu, 1963) , he asserted that individuals in a society are fundamentally equal in the most basic sense. According to him, any perceived differences (such as education, race, wealth and social status) among people are merely artifacts made by humans; therefore, offering care and love to anyone should be equivalent, and acts that are harmful to others should be avoided. He believed that people are morally obliged not only to their families and acquaintances, but also to those they do not know. With the fulfillment of Mo-Tzu's ethical ideology in the industrial context, it is believed that food manufacturers could be more empathetic and perceptive with regard to the concerns of the public, and self-monitoring of industrial practices could be achieved.",

Under such circumstances, the introduction of ethics in food technology may further force them to sacrifice the profits of production and further add to their financial stress burden. Consequently, even though the need for moral conduct in food technology may be widely appreciated, their motivation to actually practice it might be limited. Education is also a prerequisite in fulfillment of food technology ethics as evidenced by the Chinese experience in the tainted milk scandal. In China, the food industry is often organized as a small-scale, labor-intensive one, lacking capital and hi-tech operations. Small-scale farmers have usually received little education on formal farming and husbandry practices; they might have thought that mixing certain ''magic'' chemicals (e.g. melamine) and preservatives to milk could make it look more nutritious and longer lasting, thus rendering it more profitable, with little understanding of the severity of the problems caused by their actions. This problem of under-education among workers in the agri-food system not only devastates food security but also compromises the carefully planned PGOM in some humane industries. Provision of professional training and workshops to relevant workers prior to commencement of their work may be useful in alleviating the under-education problem in a country, but support from the government and respective industrial entities would be a sine qua non.",

In view of this, it is high time that we afforded special consideration to collaboration between food researchers and other scholars, including those with expertise in ethics, social science, politics and commerce. Along with exchange of knowledge among disciplines, it is expected that a more integrative understanding of the multiple dimension of food science and technology can be achieved, thereby facilitating the establishment of more suitable and prompt measures and ethical practices in response to technological advances.",

Second, the authors' bias may be involved in the interpretation of others' work.
