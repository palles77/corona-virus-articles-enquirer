Rural-urban migration has resulted in inadequacy of sanitation, crowded living conditions and other basic infrastructure issues associated with population growth. It has thus contributed to the resurgence of many diseases, such as tuberculosis, cholera, typhoid, and plague, that are transmitted when living conditions and hygiene are sub-standard, and when overcrowding occurs. Cholera, thought to have been introduced into Peru in 1990 by bilge pumped from a freight ship, resulted in urban epidemics in Peru and parts of Latin America where it had previously been quiescent for over 100 years (2) . By the 1980s, crowded major urban areas in Africa and South America had experienced a dramatic re-emergence of yellow fever epidemics as the yellow fever virus was introduced by mosquitoes from rain forests into new and densely populated urban areas where bednets to give protection from mosquito bites were no longer being used, and where mosquito control activities had gone unfounded (3) .",

Drug-resistant microbes have then spread from person to person and geographically, raising the prospect that common infectious diseases could become prohibitively expensive or impossible to treat (4) . The bacterial infections that contribute most to human disease are also those in which emerging resistance is of most concern: diarrheal diseases such as dysentery; respiratory tract infections, including pneumococcal pneumonia and multidrugresistant tuberculosis; sexually transmitted infections such as gonorrhoea; and a host of hospital-acquired infections that are notoriously difficult and expensive to treat. Among the major infectious diseases, the development of resistance to drugs commonly used to treat malaria is of particular concern, as is the emerging resistance to anti-HIV drugs. Most alarming of all are microbes that have now accumulated resistance genes to virtually all currently available antimicrobial drugs, such as Staphylococcus aureus and Salmonella typhi, which now have the potential to cause untreatable infections.",

The Aedes mosquito species is now well established in most, if not all, large African cities, increasing the risk of explosive urban outbreaks of dengue (13) . Similar examples are occurring in Asia where dengue and dengue hemorrhagic fever have caused major outbreaks during 2004 in Indonesia and India (14) . In countries of the former Soviet Union, large amounts of stagnant water, created by ineffective irrigation schemes, provided mosquito breeding sites that permitted the reemergence of malaria in the most southern states, where a few incidental and probably imported cases in Tajikistan in the early 1990s multiplied to almost 20,000 reported cases in 1998 (15) .

It is thought to be only a matter of time until an animal influenza virus circulating in domestic animals recombines with a human influenza virus, and causes the next highly lethal influenza pandemic (19) . Intensive farming practices in Asia have placed humans in close proximity to domestic animals in densely populated areas. In 1997 in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of China, crowded conditions and live poultry markets adjacent to residential areas facilitated the transmission of a new avian influenza A virus (subtype H5N1), previously thought to be confined to birds. At least 18 humans were infected and six died, raising considerable alarm (20) . Although human-to-human transmission of the virus was documented, it was found to be relatively inefficient and uncommon (18, 21) . A reemergence of this same virus throughout Asia in late 2003 and 2004 has resulted in 42 human infections with 30 deaths in Thailand and Vietnam by 1 November 2004, and the continued threat of a global human pandemic (22) .",
