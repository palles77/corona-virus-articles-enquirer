            "text": "The initial step of virus entry into the host cell consists of receptor recognition and binding. For this, most viruses have a receptor binding protein at their surface. Many paramyxoviruses, as well as some orthomyxoviruses, polyomaviruses, rotaviruses, coronavirus, and adenoviruses, use sialic acid containing molecules as receptors at the cell surface [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] . Sialic acid residues are found at the outermost ends of gangliosides (glycosphingolipids) and N-and O-glycoproteins bound to Gal residues, with \u03b12-3or \u03b12-6-linkages. Additionally, sialic acids may be bound to other sialic acid in an \u03b12-8linkage [8] . The specific linkage of sialic acid residue to glycoconjugates is believed to be one of the major determinants of viral tropism in the above mentioned group of viruses. Different influenza strains vary in their specificities as regards sialic acid linkages (\u03b12-3 or \u03b12-6) and the type of sialic acid residue (NeuAc, NeuGc, or 9-O-Ac-NeuAc) (references in [9] ). Influenza A viruses bind to sialic acid-containing molecules with specificities that vary according to the host species Electronic supplementary material The online version of this article (doi:10.1007/s10719-012-9431-0) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users. [10] ; influenza human viruses mainly recognize \u03b12-6-linked sialic acids whereas avian influenza viruses prefer \u03b12-3- [10, 11] . A conversion from \u03b12-3 to \u03b12-6 sialic acid recognition is thought to be one of the changes that must occur before avian influenza viruses can replicate efficiently in humans and acquire the potential to cause a pandemic. In addition, it has been proposed that glycan topology, rather than sialic acid linkages, may be critical in interactions of influenza A with target cells [2, 12] . To add further complexity, influenza viruses are able to infect cells in the absence of any surface sialic acid [13] or independently of cell surface sialic acid content [14] .",

            "text": "Newcastle Disease Virus (NDV), a prototype of paramyxoviruses, is an avian enveloped RNA-negative strand virus that causes respiratory disease in domestic fowl, leading to huge economic losses in the poultry industry. The envelope of NDV contains two associated glycoproteins that mediate viral entry: the haemagglutinin-neuraminidase (HN) and fusion (F) proteins. HN is the receptor-binding protein that recognizes and binds to sialoglycoconjugates at the cell surface [1] and also has sialidase activity in separate sites [19] . Based on crystallographic studies of the HN of NDV, two sialic acid-binding sites have been described [20, 21] . Site I would support both receptor-destroying and receptor-binding activities, while site II only receptorbinding activity. It remains unknown whether both sialic acid-binding sites might interact with the same cell surface molecule(s). Site I of hPIV1 binds \u03b12-6-linked sialic acids, whereas site II binds both \u03b12-3and \u03b12-6-linked sialic acids [22] . A secondary sialic acid-binding site that bind \u03b12,3 sialyllactose in neuraminidase (0sialidase) from avian, human and swine influenza viruses has been described [23] .",

We analyzed the sialyl linkage specificity of NDV using different sialidases and lectins that recognize \u03b12-3 or \u03b12-6 sialyl linkages differently. Sialidase and lectin treatment revealed that NDV uses both \u03b12-3and \u03b12-6sialylated glycans. NDV interacts efficiently with the ganglioside-deficient cell line GM95, meaning that other sialylated molecules, i.e. N-linked glycoproteins, may function as effective receptors in the absence of gangliosides. Nevertheless, the interaction of NDV with the Lec1 cell line deficient in N-glycosylation was less efficient as compared with its parental CHO. After comparing the data concerning NDV interactions with both mutant cell lines, GM95 and Lec1, we concluded that glycoproteins seem to be more critical than gangliosides for NDV interactions with the target cell. The data presented here regarding NDV receptor specificity would be relevant for understanding viral tropism and for developing new antiviral strategies targeting viral receptors.",

            "text": "Enzymatic removal of cell surface sialic acid residues was achieved by treatment with sialidases from V.cholera and C.perfringens, both of which preferably cleave \u03b12-3linked sialic acid from glycolipids and glycoproteins (manufacturer's specifications); and sialidase from A.ureafaciens, which has a preference for cleaving \u03b12-6-linked sialic acids [42] . The efficiency of sialic acid removal after enzymatic treatment was tested by fluorescent lectin staining (Supplementary Fig. S2) . Surprisingly, we detected an increase in the FITC-MALI staining of CHO cells after C.perfringens sialidase treatment ( Supplementary Fig. S2B ), suggesting that the removal of several sialic acids might unmask some sialoglycoconjugates at the cell surface recognized by this lectin. We analyzed the effect of the depletion of receptors caused by sialidases on NDV binding, fusion and infectivity in enzyme-treated cells. The fusion activity of NDV with enzyme-treated cells was analysed by a fluorescent assay, as detailed in Methods. As expected, the removal of \u03b12-3linked sialic acid afforded a significant reduction in viral fusion in four of the five cell lines (Fig. 2a) ; pretreatment of cells with the \u03b12,6 sialidase afforded a 50 % NDV fusion inhibition only in ELL-0 cells. Similarly, the fusion of hPIV3, another paramyxovirus, was also inhibited after both \u03b12,3 and \u03b12,6 sialidase treatments [43] . Additionally, NDV efficiently fuses and infects 293 T cells (data not shown) that preferably have \u03b12-6-linked sialic acids at their plasma membrane [44] . This result strongly suggests that, if present at the cell surface, NDV may use \u03b12-6-linked sialic acids as receptors. C.perfringens sialidase treatment increased 1.3 fold the efficiency of NDV fusion with CHO cells (Fig. 2a) , in accordance with the observed enhancement of MALI lectin staining in C.perfringens sialidase-treated CHO cells ( Supplementary Fig. 2B ) suggesting that the unmasking of some sialoglycoconjugates at the CHO cell surface by sialidases would allow NDV to fuse more efficiently. The binding of NDV to target cells was also sensitive to sialic acid removal (Fig. 2b) ; including GM95 and Lec1, the treatment of cells with both \u03b12,3 sialidases reduced the level of viral binding from 30 % to 50 %, depending on the cell line. A.ureafaciens sialidase treatment of ELL-0 cells also elicited the reduction of NDV binding by about 20 % in comparison with the controls. In general, binding reduction after sialidase treatments was lower than the inhibition of fusion (Fig. 2b versus Fig. 2a) suggesting the absence of a total correlation between the receptors involved in binding with those that promote fusion. Another possibility lies in the differences in the methodology used to analyze both activities. Moreover, the incomplete inhibition of NDV binding after sialidase treatment of cells would potentially indicate a role for additional molecules, sialylated or not, since not all sialic acids are accessible to sialidases [45] . Using an in vitro assay, we have previously reported the interaction of NDV with gangliosides with sialic acid residues attached to internal sugars, such as in GM1 or GD1b [25] . The hydrolysis therefore of external sialic acid from disialo-or trisialo-gangliosides such as GD1a or GT1b would afford gangliosides such as GM1 and GD1b respectively (for a schematic representation of ganglioside structures, see Supplementary Fig. S3 ), which might be used for NDV binding but, hypothetically, not for fusion. Owing to the increase in the FITC-MALI staining of CHO cells (Supplementary Fig. S2B ) after \u03b12,3 sialic acid removal as well as the increase in NDV fusion (Fig. 2a) , an increase in viral binding was also expected. However, the data revealed a reduction in NDV binding of about 30 % as compared with the controls after sialidase treatments (Fig. 2b) of this cell line. It could be speculated that certain non-productive binding sites could have been removed after sialidase treatment, and then new productive binding sites could have been unmasked to allow viral fusion to occur more effectively. Major differences in fusion after \u03b12,6 sialidase treatment were observed in ELL-0 and CHO cells (Fig. 2a) . In spite of the low level of \u03b12-6-linked sialic acids in CHO cells (Fig. 1) , the fusion and binding of NDV to A.ureafaciens sialidase-treated CHO cells increased. The enzyme shows a preference for \u03b12-6-linkages, although it may also hydrolyze \u03b12-3-, \u03b12-8and \u03b12-9-linked sialic acids [42] , and hence NDV would have more opportunities to bind to receptor-depleted CHO cells without competition from the sialic acid moieties removed by the sialidase on the same cell surface.",

            "text": "The effect of sialic acid removal on NDV infectivity was also studied. Before infection, cells were treated with sialidase from V.cholerae, which showed the highest fusion inhibition effect in most of the cell lines of this study (Fig. 2a) . Following this, control and desialylated cells were infected with three different concentrations of rNDV-F3aa- perfringens-(50 mU/ml) or A. ureafaciens-(25 mU/ml) sialidases for 1 h at 37\u00b0C. After washing, 3 \u03bcg of R18-labeled NDV was bound to cells for 1 h at 4\u00b0C, after which they were allowed to fuse for 1 h at 37\u00b0C. Fusion was assessed by the transfer of the R18 red dye to the cell membrane and is referred to as the percentage of fusion in comparison with the control. Data are means\u00b1standard deviations of three independent experiments. b Cells were incubated with one of the three sialidases as in a, and the binding of NDV to target cells was analyzed by a FACS-based immunoassay, as detailed in Methods. Data referring to binding percentages of the controls are means\u00b1standard deviations of three independent experiments, except those of sialidase from A.ureafaciens. Statistical analysis was performed using the paired t test: **, p<0.01, highly statistically significant; ***, p<0.001, extremely significant mRFP recombinant NDV. As detailed in Methods, infectivity was monitored at 24 h post-infection, calculating the percentage of the red-fluorescent infected cells from the total number of cells. The results are summarized in Fig. 3 . At the highest viral concentration assayed (10 \u22122 dilution), the control cells were fully infected whereas no inhibition of infectivity was observed, except in ELL-0 and Lec1 cells (Fig. 3a) . Nevertheless, at the lowest viral concentration (10 \u22124 dilution) infectivity was almost completely inhibited in the five cell lines (Fig. 3c) . The effect of A.ureafaciens sialidase treatment of ELL-0 cells on NDV infectivity was also analyzed showing about 50 % of inhibition at both 10 \u22123 and 10 \u22124 viral dilutions (Fig. 3d) . The reduction in viral infectivity exerted by sialidase treatment was dependent on the viral concentration: the higher the viral titre the lower the inhibition of infectivity. It has been established that at low viral concentrations viruses use more specific routes for entry [46, 47] ; our results would suggest that the requirement of specific sialic acid residues in the initial interactions of NDV with cells may be bypassed in the presence of large concentrations of virus, as reported before for influenza virus [13] . In the N-glycoprotein-deficient cell line Lec1, it could be speculated that in the absence of specific glycoproteins the virus would always use less specific routes entry, being negatively affected by sialic acid removal at both low and at high viral concentrations. Moreover, it has been recently published that NDV may efficiently fuse and infect Lec1 cells suggesting that hybrid and complex-type N-glycans are not essential for NDV infection [48] . We also carried out some lectin competition assays, analyzing the effect of the preincubation of target cells with specific lectins on NDV binding, fusion and infectivity (Fig. 4) . The lectin from MALI, specific for \u03b12-3-linked sialic acids, inhibited fusion in four of the cells lines assayed in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 4a) . In general, these data correlate with those of sialidase fusion inhibition (Fig. 2a) . Unlike the data concerning the effect of sialic acid removal on NDV fusion in CHO cells (Fig. 2a) , we did detect an inhibitory effect of MALI preincubation of this cell line, observing about 70 % of fusion inhibition at the highest dose assayed. These data confirmed that \u03b12-3-linked sialic acid-linked glycoconjugates are involved in NDV interaction with CHO cells. As expected from the data of \u03b12-6- Figs. 1 and 2) , SNA lectin, which recognizes \u03b12-6-linked sialic acids, only exerted a significant inhibitory effect on NDV fusion with pretreated ELL-0 cells (Fig. 4a) . As a control, lentil lectin, which shows specificity for high mannose cores [49] , was ineffective at blocking NDV fusion (data not shown) in any of the five cell lines studied. The data concerning viral binding after lectin preincubation were similar to those of viral fusion inhibition, showing that MALI lectin reduced NDV binding in ELL-0, MEB4 and GM95 and CHO cells (Fig. 4b) , whereas no inhibition of binding was observed in Lec1 cells. Moreover, preincubation of ELL-0 cells with SNA lectin prior to NDV binding resulted in a strong reduction in viral binding, whereas, as expected, very little or no effect was seen in the other four cell lines. The negative effect of lectin preincubation on NDV infectivity shown in Fig. 4c was stronger at the lowest viral concentration (10 \u22124 dilution), like the data concerning the effect of sialidase on NDV infectivity (Fig. 3) .",

After sialidase treatment, cells were incubated with \u03b12,3N-, \u03b12,6Nor \u03b12,3O-STs to attach free sialic acid residues to the terminal position of the oligosaccharide chain with different specificities [50, 51] . The efficiency of resialylation was assessed in ELL-0 cells (Supplementary Fig. S4 ). The fusion of NDV with STs-treated cells was analyzed by fluorescence microscopy (Fig. 5) . The resialylation of ELL-0 cells with both \u03b12,3Nand \u03b12,6(N)-STs elicited a significant increase in NDV fusion, confirming the role of \u03b12-6 sialic acid linkages NDV interactions with this cell line. Moreover, the increase in \u03b12-6-linked sialic acids after ST resialylation in MEB4 and GM95 cells also afforded a partial restoration of the degree of NDV fusion, which would indicate that, if present, NDV may efficiently use these glycans. Resialylation with \u03b12-3(O) ST did not restore NDV fusion, as expected from our previous data, which indicated that O-glycoproteins were not essential for NDV activities [25] . The effect of sialic acid restoration on NDV infectivity was also analyzed in ELL-0 cells. The data ( Supplementary Fig. S5) show that viral infectivity was partially recovered after both ST treatments, recovery after \u03b12,6N ST incubation being even higher. The observed differences of NDV fusion recovery in Ell-0 cells after \u03b12,3(N)-ST treatment (75 %, Fig. 5 ) compared with infectivity recovery (30 %, Fig. S5 ) might be due to the different enzyme concentration used in both assays. Taken together, these results strengthen the conclusion that sialic acids attached with both \u03b12-3and \u03b12-6linkages are involved in NDV interactions with target cells. The interaction of NDV with \u03b12-3and/or \u03b12-6-linked sialic acids might depend on the cell line, which may account for the broad cell tropism of NDV.",

            "text": "As shown in Fig. 1 , MEB4 expressed approximately 4.5fold as much \u03b12-3-linked sialic acid as GM95, whereas Lec1 expressed 14.5-fold less sialic acids than CHO. Despite the low level of \u03b12,3 and \u03b12,6 sialic acid expression at the cell surface, GM95 and Lec1 cells showed a significant degree of fusion ( Fig. 1) and infectivity (Fig. 3 ) as compared with those of their parental cell lines, MEB4 and CHO respectively. Accordingly, NDV does not appear to require a large amount of sialic acids on the cell surface to interact efficiently with the target cell. Moreover, the rate of NDV fusion with the ganglioside-deficient cell line GM95 and with its parental MEB4 was similar at different viral concentrations (Fig. 6a) ; the same levels of viral infectivity ( Fig. 3 and data not shown) and binding ( Supplementary  Fig. S6A ) were also observed. GM95 cells were selected from the parent MEB4 cells of B16 mouse melanoma using antibodies against ganglioside GM3 [36] . Nevertheless, it has been reported that this mutant cell line may incorporate gangliosides from serum-containing medium in the cell culture [52] . To exclude this possibility, glycolipid extraction and TLC analyses of both MEB4 and GM95 cells were performed ( Supplementary Fig. S7 ). As reported previously [36] , ganglioside GM3 was detected in MEB4 cells but we failed to detect any gangliosides in the lipid extract obtained from GM95 cells nor in GM95 cells adapted for growth in serum-free medium (data not shown), confirming that GM95 was deficient in the expression of gangliosides. These results lead us to conclude that gangliosides are not an absolute requirement for NDV fusion and infection; the fusion of NDV with GM95 cells (Fig. 6b) ; binding was also less efficient in the mutant cell line than in CHO ( Supplementary Fig. S6B) ; moreover, in the absence of Nglycoproteins NDV infectivity was more dependent on sialic acid residues (Fig. 3) . Upon comparing the data of NDV interactions with both mutant cell lines, GM95 and Lec1, it may be concluded that glycoproteins seem to be more critical than gangliosides for NDV interactions with the target cell. Similarly, it has been shown that influenza virus cannot infect Lec1 cells, despite undergoing binding and fusion [39] . This was interpreted in terms of the idea that influenza virus specifically requires N-linked glycoproteins for infection, gangliosides being an attachment factor that is insufficient for infection.",

            "text": "Virus attachment and entry into the target cells have been described as a multistep process involving interactions of viruses with different molecules at the cell surface, attachment factors, correceptors and receptors with different affinities. The use of multistage binding and entry pathways is a common feature of many viruses, where primary receptors recruit virus particles to facilitate interaction with a more specific receptor that mediates viral entry. Many viruses use sialic acid-containing glycoconjugates as attachment molecules and then bind to additional receptors for entry [53] . The recognition and binding to typical sialic acid linkages is believed to be the major determinant of viral tropism for some viruses. Viruses that bind to sialic acid show a preference for \u03b12-3-linked sialic acids or \u03b12-6-linked sialic acids: in influenza viruses, avian species preferentially bind to \u03b12-3-linked sialic acids whereas human and swine viruses bind to \u03b12-6-linked sialic acids [11, 54] . It has also been suggested that avian species may serve as potential intermediate hosts for the interspecies transmission of viruses between birds and humans [55] . It has previously been determined that sialic acid is a determinant receptor for NDV infection of the host cell (revised in [1] ). Here, we have shown that NDV can productively use both \u03b12-3and \u03b12-6-linked sialic acids present at the cell surface glycoconjugates. The presence of both \u03b12-3and \u03b12-6-linked sialic acids in tissues from the upper respiratory tract of chickens [56] indicates that, in vivo, NDV might use both receptors to initiate infection. Different viruses also recognize both sialic acid linkages: paramyxovirus hPIV1 and hPIV3 [18, 43, 57, 58] ; polyomaviruses [4, 59] , adeno-associated viruses [60] , and even several influenza strains [61, 62] . For some viruses that recognize sialoglycoconjugates, a different role of gangliosides and glycoproteins has been proposed, and it has been suggested that binding to gangliosides is a previous, less stable and transient step than binding more specifically to N-glycoproteins [39, 52] . Nevertheless, for polyomaviruses, Qian and Tsai [63] have proposed that glycoproteins and gangliosides play opposite roles in virus entry, gangliosides being functional receptor glycoproteins acting as decoy receptors.",
