            "text": "Neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) can be both sufficient and necessary for protection against viral infections, although they sometimes act in concert with cellular immunity. Successful vaccines against viruses induce NAbs but vaccine candidates against some major viral pathogens, including HIV-1, have failed to induce potent and effective such responses. Theories of how antibodies neutralize virus infectivity have been formulated and experimentally tested since the 1930s; and controversies about the mechanistic and quantitative bases for neutralization have continually arisen. Soluble versions of native oligomeric viral proteins that mimic the functional targets of neutralizing antibodies now allow the measurement of the relevant affinities of NAbs. Thereby the neutralizing occupancies on virions can be estimated and related to the potency of the NAbs. Furthermore, the kinetics and stoichiometry of NAb binding can be compared with neutralizing efficacy. Recently, the fundamental discovery that the intracellular factor TRIM21 determines the degree of neutralization of adenovirus has provided new mechanistic and quantitative insights. Since TRIM21 resides in the cytoplasm, it would not affect the neutralization of enveloped viruses, but its range of activity against naked viruses will be important to uncover. These developments bring together the old problems of virus neutralization-mechanism, stoichiometry, kinetics, and efficacy-from surprising new angles.",

Likewise, they are markers of immunity against reinfection after an acute infection has been cleared. Such immunity can be lifelong [9] [10] [11] . Many vaccines against viral infections are good inducers of protective neutralizing antibody responses, but recalcitrant problems remain in the field of viral vaccination. One problem is antigenic variability. The antigenic targets for neutralizing antibodies on influenza virus vary abundantly, and therefore a new vaccine must be prepared every new season [7] . Hepatitis C virus (HCV) and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) are even more variable, and after years of research we still cannot induce immune responses that protect against them [7, [12] [13] [14] .",

Hence some proteins, particularly foreign ones, are both immunogens, inducing the production of specific antibodies against themselves, and antigens, the targets of the response. Other molecules, for example, small organic compounds, may bind with high specificity to antibodies without being able to elicit those antibodies except when conjugated to larger carriers [15] . Such small molecules are called haptens. They illustrate the important distinction between immunogenicity, the capacity to elicit an immune response, and antigenicity, the capacity to be recognized by the immune response [15, 16] . The more precise surface patch on an antigen that is directly contacted by the antibody is the epitope and the corresponding surface on the antibody in direct contact with the antigen is the paratope [17] .",

Attenuated variants of the simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV), which is closely related to HIV, have provided stronger protection than nonreplicating experimental vaccines against the wild-type virus, but the 2 Advances in Biology mechanism of protection is not completely elucidated [18] [19] [20] . In other cases, recombinant proteins representing subunits of hepatitis B virus (HBV) and human papilloma virus (HPV) induce strong protection [21, 22] . The HPV vaccine consists of virus-like particles that may have advantageous properties both antigenically and immunogenically: they may present native neutralization epitopes well and be seen by the innate immune system as pathogen-associated molecular patterns [23] . But subunit immunizations have failed to protect against HIV type 1 (HIV-1) [1, 7, 8, 14, 24] . Only in the RV144 clinical trial, which combined viral proteins expressed from a canarypox vector with recombinant subunit protein boosts, was some modest protection observed. But the vaccine had not induced NAbs [8, 25, 26] . Therefore, the hunt is on for other antibodies and immune responses that might explain the limited protection. Many different antiviral effects of antibodies have been described that do not qualify as neutralization [27, 28] . This brings us to some semantic clarifications.",

Therefore, the only reason to adhere to a strict definition of neutralization is that it may favor clarity and allow useful distinctions in the field of antiviral research. Neutralization, as discussed here, is defined as the reduction in viral infectivity by the binding of antibodies to the surface of viral particles (virions), thereby blocking a step in the viral replication cycle that precedes virally encoded transcription or synthesis [30, 31] . Classically the term was applied only to antibodies and fragments of antibodies, Fab and F(ab )2, but later it has naturally been extended to single-domain antigen-binding recombinant fragments and natural nanobodies [32, 33] . Likewise the definition can be expanded to cover similar activities by soluble forms of viral receptors [34, 35] , naturally occurring defensins, or other molecules of the innate immune system [36, 37] ; it can be extended to lectins, either derived from plants or soluble recombinant and hybrid forms of mannose C-type lectin receptors (MCLRs) [38] . With regard to small organic molecules, if they are said to be neutralizing, it should be clarified whether that is meant to imply that they act by binding to the surface of the virion [39] [40] [41] [42] [43] [44] [45] [46] [47] [48] [49] . This review, however, only discusses antibody-mediated neutralization.",

The enzyme releases progeny virus by digesting the neuraminic-acid moiety of the receptor for the virus.

Antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) is a wellestablished effect that requires effector cells and counteracts viral infection by killing the virus-producing cell [27, 28] . The antibodies involved may be neutralizing, when tested in the absence of effector cells (natural killer cells) but often are not. And some neutralizing antibodies are not of the right isotype to mediate this effect. Antibody-dependent cellmediated viral inhibition (ADCVI) has a more complicated relationship to neutralization, which may concomitantly occur in the assay used for measuring the effect. But to the extent that the inhibition depends on effector cells, it is not neutralization. Again, antibody isotype will affect the component in ADCVI that involves Fc-Fc-receptor interactions. Furthermore, the epitope location on the influenza virus haemagglutinin determines whether an antibody is merely neutralizing or also capable of mediating Fc-receptor interactions and thereby ADCC and protection in vivo in a mouse model [51] .",

Naked viruses need to penetrate a cellular membrane to enter the cytoplasm or instead they may inject their genome through a membrane [80] ; enveloped viruses must fuse their envelope with a cellular membrane in order to translocate their core and genome into the cytoplasm [79, [81] [82] [83] [84] [85] . Some viruses enter the cytoplasm directly from the cell surface; some depend on endocytosis for productive entry, sometimes because the reduced pH in the endosome triggers penetration or fusion [86] . If the virus enters directly from the cell surface, the genome-containing particle must again penetrate a barrier, the cortical cytoskeleton, which is an actin mesh with masks sometimes smaller than naked virions or viral cores [70, 87] . By entering after endocytosis, the virus surmounts this obstacle, delivering the capsid to a more central location. After these steps, the core may need to be uncoated, or to migrate to specific locations in the cell, before transcriptional or translational synthetic events take place, beyond which any inhibitory effects per definition no longer constitute neutralization.",

If the NAbs block necessary receptor interactions after attachment, that is also a mechanism of neutralization; so is interference with any other obligatory step in the entry of individual viruses, such as coreceptor engagement, endocytosis, fusion, or penetration. One way to explore postattachment neutralization (PAN) is to let virus adsorb to cells at a low temperature that does not permit fusion or internalization and then to add the NAb. It should not be inferred, however, that PAN does not interfere with receptor interactions: some receptor contacts may first be established at the lower temperature, and then the NAb binds and prevents further necessary receptor recruitments during the warm-up [88, 89] . PAN might even reverse attachment. Still, investigating the capacity for PAN may contribute to the characterization of a NAb. That a NAb is capable of PAN does not, however, demonstrate PAN as the Figure 1 : The mechanism of neutralization. Neutralization of enveloped viruses blocks viral attachment and entry. No other mechanisms are yet known; but entry can be blocked at different stages. The three blue virions to the right represent enveloped virus particles. The first has an IgG bound to its receptor-binding protein (green, for simplicity shown as a single copy). The bound NAb blocks the docking onto the receptor (grey) on the cell surface. The second virion has already established contact between its receptorbinding protein and the cell-surface receptor. The NAb binds to an epitope on the envelope glycoprotein (viral proteins with this function and topology are usually glycosylated) that may have become exposed after the receptor binding and blocks subsequent steps; these could be interactions with a second receptor or the fusogenic refolding of the envelope glycoprotein. The third blue virion is about to fuse with the cell membrane, but NAbs bound to membrane proximal epitopes on fusogenic proteins (not shown) prevent the completion of this process. The latter two interferences with entry could also occur in endosomes, but hardly the first, unless there are alternative attachment proteins the virus can bind to and thereby get internalized. The purple virion in the endosome is prevented by NAbs from fusing its envelope with the vesicular membrane. Alternatively, this purple virion could represent a naked virus particle, the penetration of which is prevented by the NAbs. The block of infection in the endosome could properly be called a postinternalization block of entry; for clarity, entry should refer to transfer of the viral core or capsid, or possibly only genome, into the cytoplasm. The red virion on the cell surface depicts a naked virion that binds to a cell surface receptor and injects the genome into the cytoplasm. This process may occur in vesicles or semisealed invaginations of the cell surface. If the NAbs have not prevented receptor interactions, they may interfere with the extrusion of the genome. The red virion in the cytoplasm has penetrated an endosomal membrane in complex with the NAb, allowing binding to TRIM21 (yellow box with arrow), which mediates the ubiquitination of the complex, targeting it for proteasomal degradation. This fairly recently discovered effect constitutes the clearest example so far of a postentry mechanism of neutralization. overriding mechanism at more physiological temperatures, nor does the lack of PAN at low temperatures exclude that it would occur at higher ones: receptor-induced epitope exposure on the entry-mediating viral proteins may require temperatures that do not block entry. If, nevertheless, PAN is detectable but less potent than preattachment neutralization there can be several explanations. First, it is conceivable that when receptor contact is already made, a higher occupancy by NAb on the remaining receptor-binding proteins for stopping entry is required than on the free virion. Second, kinetics come into play: the on-rate for the NAb binding will need to be higher when the attachment-entry process has begun than when the NAb binds in the absence of cells, and hence a higher NAb concentration is required if the on-rate constant is the same. Third, PAN may act partly by competition with receptors, thereby reversing attachment, which may require higher concentrations of NAbs than preventing it, because of the valency of the virus-receptor interactions and the strengthening of initial attachment by subsequent receptor recruitment.",

For example, NAbs have been demonstrated to block attachment of rhinovirus to HeLa cells [90] . The situation with poliovirus appears more complicated. But more recent elucidation of the mechanisms of picornaviral entry may shed light on precisely which necessary steps are prevented by neutralization and whether neutralizing mechanisms differ within the viral family [39-41, 65, 91, 92] . In the studies of polivirus neutralization, some NAbs were found not to block attachment, but to block endocytosis partially, to induce a pI shift in the virion, or to prevent transcription [58, [93] [94] [95] [96] . One study found that among NAbs inactivating unattached virus, only the bivalently binding minority were capable of PAN; the others were rendered capable of PAN through cross-linking of their Fc portions. Furthermore, neutralization coincided with the prevention of a structural change in the 135S RNA-containing virion and of the genomic extrusion that normally produces 80S empty capsids in the uninhibited infection process [97] . Finally, the capacity to aggregate poliovirus particles was recorded as an exception among the NAbs [97] .",

But in so far as it reduces infectivity it would qualify as a limited neutralizing effect, albeit with a complex dependence on antibody and virion concentrations. Typically, virion aggregation, as a function of antibody concentration, describes a domeshaped curve: at low concentrations of antibodies, crosslinking of antigens on individual virions is favored, at higher concentrations virions are bridged, but when the epitopes on the virions come close to being saturated, cross-linking can no longer occur. A quantal assay may be required for measuring the loss in infectivity: a large aggregate would diffuse more slowly than virions but might sediment onto susceptible cells; fewer cells may end up being infected than by a monodisperse suspension of virions, but those that do may attain a higher multiplicity of infection. In a quantal, that is, focus-counting, infectivity assay this could give a distinct reduction of infectivity [98] ; in assays based on the production of viral antigens or activation of reporter genes the effect could be smaller or absent. Still, a reduced infectivity would count as neutralization because it stems from how the virus is prevented from reaching and entering its target cells. In vivo, aggregation might have differential effects depending on target cell availability and requirements for diffusion, but their phagocytosis of aggregates, an ancillary inhibition not attributable to neutralization itself, might enhance the antibody-mediated inhibition.",

Occupancy theories of neutralization come in different versions with varying potential for direct experimental testing. Strong versions suggest that IgG molecules because of their bulk impede the function of viral attachment-or entry-mediating proteins. One antibody molecule per viral protein subunit or even per oligomer may be sufficient. If a certain number of unoccupied such viral proteins were required for infection, then all virions with higher occupancies would be neutralized. The minimum neutralizing occupancy would constitute the neutralization threshold. So far so good, but there are several complications.",

The unoccupied functional sites might need to be clustered in one area of the virion surface in order to function. But they may be moveable so that a sufficient number can be recruited into an entry complex together with receptors after the initial docking of the virion onto a single or too few receptor molecules [31, 84, [105] [106] [107] [108] [109] [110] [111] [112] [113] . If these viral proteins are not moveable, however, and they are unevenly distributed over the virion surface, it may only be when NAbs bind within the clusters that they have a neutralizing effect. All of these complications would be expected to soften the apparent thresholds of neutralization, even if it is postulated that a virion is either completely neutralized or not [84, 105, [108] [109] [110] .",

Functional spikes are shown in blue, decayed or otherwise nonfunctional ones in grey. Both virions have seven functional and five nonfunctional spikes but with different distributions over the two virion surfaces. If a virion requires a certain number of spikes in contiguity to form an entry complex and the spikes cannot move freely over the virion surface, the two different distributions will confer different neutralization sensitivities. The virion to the left is neutralized: three NAb molecules inactivate the constellation of active spikes and one binds redundantly to an inactive spike. The virion to the right is also neutralized but by only two NAb molecules, one inactivating a group of three spikes (three adjacent ones being postulated here to be the bare minimum for entry) and one binding redundantly to a spike that is functional but inert through lack of active neighbors. Effects of this sort could blur critical occupancy thresholds and reduce the steepness of neutralization curves in experiments with phenotypically mixed virus, of which the virions carry random assortments of antigenic and nonantigenic subunits of the envelope glycoprotein oligomers. Heterogeneity of the number (not shown) and distribution (shown) of functional entry-mediating viral proteins may explain how different occupancies are required for blocking viral entry. Some of these considerations apply also to naked viruses.",

Such a proportional relationship, applied to the full range of occupancies, we can call the incremental model, as opposed to models that postulate a threshold, which we can name liminal [105, 114] . Now, both models can be formulated mathematically in their pure form, but fitting them to data suggests that mixed models are the most realistic [31, 84, [105] [106] [107] [108] [109] [110] . Thus, there may be an absolute minimum of a close constellation of unoccupied entry-mediating molecules. But when the constellation is larger than necessary, any antibody binding still dents infectivity. And if the redundancy of entry molecules is huge, that denting may be negligible in relative terms. In other words, there is neither a strict proportionality, nor a sharp threshold. One version of the occupancy theory suggests that neutralization will occur when NAbs achieve a sufficiently dense coat on the virions [99] . This coating theory has several distinct implications. It invokes steric hindrance of access not only to the occupied entry-mediating molecule but to adjacent ones as well. It implies a linear relationship between virion surface area and the minimal number of NAb molecules required for neutralization. This linearity holds up approximately [99] . It would explain why antibodies to influenza virus neuraminidase do not neutralize [50, 115] : the density of that antigen is too low; there are four times as many hemagglutinin as neuraminidase molecules on the virus surface [99] . Some degree of neutralization does, however, result from cross-linking the antibodies bound to neuraminidase by anti-Fc antibodies [116] . Maybe the twolayered antibody coat gives greater steric interference.",

Certain mutations in HIV-1 Env reduce the degree of neutralization by a broadly active and potent NAb (10E8 [122] ) directed to a membrane-proximal epitope in the transmembrane protein. Although these mutations thus do not convert the NAb to a non-NAb, it is possible to study how the binding to the mutant virions affects their sensitivity to other NAbs, that is, how the residually infectious virus in complex with this still partly active NAb is neutralized [123] . The NAb enhances the neutralization by some antibodies to other epitopes in gp41 but reduces that by others, including those directed to adjacent epitopes as well as those specific for the CD4-binding site. The stoichiometry of the binding of the NAb to mutant trimers is lower than for wild-type Env: two instead of three paratopes bind [123] . This low degree of binding stabilizes the trimer and may have distant allosteric effects such that the binding of other NAbs is facilitated or impeded. Hence, this intriguing case may thus uniquely show that weakly neutralizing antibodies can counteract rather than add to the action of stronger ones. If the allosteric mechanism involves reduced affinity for the distant affected epitopes, it rather corroborates the occupancy theory than undermines it.",

But definitive evidence was lacking and many a virologist may have regarded neutralization as in practice synonymous with antibody-mediated inhibition of attachment and entry. Then a new intracytoplasmic mechanism of neutralization was discovered [140] [141] [142] . Studying adenovirus, James and colleagues found that its neutralization is greatly dependent on the presence of tripartite motif-containing protein 21 (TRIM21) in the target cells. TRIM21 is located in the cytoplasm, has a strong affinity for IgG, and ubiquitinates the antibody-antigen complexes that it captures, targeting them for destruction by the proteasome [141, 142] . One surprising aspect of how the intracytoplasmic neutralization works is that the adenovirus particle as an intact complex with the NAb must translocate across a vesicular membrane into the cytoplasmic compartment. At least one important route of adenoviral entry is internalization through macropinocytosis followed by penetration of the vesicular membrane. Hence as long as the macropinocytic vesicle remains intact, and the capsid ligated by the NAb has not penetrated from there, TRIM21 does not gain access to the complex. Only once penetration occurs can NAb-TRIM21 contact be established. Quite conceivably a single NAb molecule might be sufficient for targeting the complex to TRIM21, but it also seems possible that targeting would be enhanced by a greater number of NAbs bound [143] . Those considerations also raise questions of how many NAb molecules can traverse the membrane together with the virus particle; one hypothesis would be that a high occupancy of NAbs prevents entry, by blocking attachment, receptor interactions, or a later penetration step, but that TRIM21 acts as a safety net, enabling the neutralization of virions with low NAb occupancy. That would, however, imply substantial TRIM21-independent neutralization at the highest NAb concentrations, which does not seem to happen [143] . These new problems will be further explored in the analyses of stoichiometry and efficacy of neutralization below.",

They would have to translocate into the cytoplasm on their own. Indeed, the discovery of the TRIM21 mechanism seems to create a new dichotomy of virus neutralization, a mechanistic divide between potential NAb effects on naked and enveloped viruses. But then the TRIM21 mechanism may not apply to all naked viruses either. If picornavirus injects its genome into the cytoplasm, and the capsid therefore never enters [80, 97] , the result would be an absence of antibody-capsid complexes in the cytoplasm and hence a lack of targets for TRIM21.",

One effect that might come closest is the binding of NAb-virion complexes to Fc receptors, followed by endocytosis, and ultimately lysosomal degradation of the virus. This antibody-dependent routing of virus would qualify as neutralization according to the definition. With HIV-1, for example, internalization depending on low NAb occupancy and subsequent loss of infectivity were observed, albeit not categorized as neutralization, perhaps because the 8 Advances in Biology effect was too weak compared with regular neutralization [148] . But it should be noted that this mechanism would prevent entry: viable genome-containing cores would not enter the cytoplasm. The routing to lysosomal degradation may be inefficient because it is outcompeted by productive entry, which can occur across the endosomal membrane. Indeed, that may be the regular site of productive entry for HIV-1 [84, 85, 137] . Conceivably, the antibody in complex with the Fc receptor would block the fusogenic Env-receptor interactions by steric hindrance and thus delay fusion until degradation in the lysosomal compartment starts. Still, it might require lower occupancies by antibody molecules on the virions than the regular entry block, just as the much more vigorous TRIM21 mechanism would. Enveloped viruses among themselves also provide contrasting examples: low occupancies on flaviviruses can mediate enhancement of infectivity, whereas high occupancies by the same antibodies cause neutralization [81, [149] [150] [151] [152] [153] [154] [155] .

As already alluded to, virions (although here virus species are likely to differ substantially) may have a spectrum of propensities to infect, and neutralization may be a shift in such propensities, that is, not an all-or-nothing effect. But if we accept the premise that neutralization is a complete loss of infectivity of the individual virion, we could seek to know the molecularity of the neutralization reaction, that is, how many antibody molecules must bind to achieve neutralization.

This does not make sense: if binding is random and of equal affinity to the two kinds of epitopes, a certain number of noncritical epitopes would be bound with the same occupancy as for the critical epitopes. Hence, the order was erroneously obtained from kinetics and so-called single-hit molecularity was mistakenly inferred from the order; to cover these unjustified leaps the term single-hit kinetics is sometimes used.

The very method of stopping the neutralization reaction, namely, rapid dilution, is unsatisfactory since it makes the results contingent upon the degree of irreversibility.

Binding produces a change in the angle of the reflection of polarized light, which is monitored and translated into a resonance signal, proportional to the mass of protein that has bound. This technique has been used for measuring antibody binding to the neutralization targets of various viruses, including the HIV-1 Env glycoproteins. Modeling of the binding at different concentrations gives the on-rate constant, on , the off-rate constant, off , and their ratio, off / on = , the dissociation constant, a reciprocal measure of affinity; furthermore, since the maximum equilibrium binding is approached and can be extrapolated, the stoichiometry of binding can also be estimated. Such studies on the binding to conformationally flexible viral envelope glycoprotein oligomers that mediate entry into susceptible cells have recently become more relevant to neutralization through improvements in the mimicry of native antigens. The antigenicity of the receptor-binding subunit, gp120, of the HIV-1 Env trimer has been studied extensively, but, as mentioned, many of the epitopes that gp120 exposes are shielded on the native trimer [168] . Likewise, the uncleaved precursor of Env, although it trimerizes, differs antigenically from native functional trimers [102] . Still, in order to produce soluble trimers, truncated N-terminally of the transmembrane segment, that do not disassemble, a common approach is to delete the cleavage site between the subunits and to add extra trimerization motifs C-terminally of the truncation [169] [170] [171] [172] [173] [174] .

Even with trimers that mimic the native spikes structurally, if they are immobilized directly to the SPR chips by covalent, such as amide, coupling their antigenicity will be perturbed. Hence, it is advantageous to add His or epitope tags C-terminally at the truncation so that the trimers can be captured by Ni 2+ or antibody that is immobilized on the chip. When the cleaved and stabilized Env trimers are immobilized by such capture, they bind NAbs active against the corresponding strain of the virus excellently and non-NAbs negligibly. Take different antibodies directed to the CD4-binding site and to the variable V3 region as examples. Both groups contain antibodies that are neutralizing and others that are nonneutralizing against particular strains of HIV-1. They bind equally well to the monomeric Env subunit gp120 and to uncleavable mutant trimeric forms of Env derived from the same strains. But only the neutralizing ones bind well to the trimers derived from the strain they neutralize. Some NAbs to particular epitopes do not bind to monomeric or nonnative forms of Env: they are trimer-specific, whereas non-NAbs regardless of epitope fail to bind the native-like trimers ( Figure 3 ) [102, 103, 175, 183] . Hence, what NAbs have in common is that they recognize native-like entry-mediating viral proteins; what non-NAbs have in common is that they do not. How they differ or resemble each other in the recognition of other forms of Env is then irrelevant. This supports the occupancy theory of neutralization [31, 99, 106, 184] . Possibly, some antibodies that have been observed not to neutralize other viruses, in spite of binding to virions, may also turn out to recognize only nonfunctional forms of the viral surface proteins.",

But the immobilization of Env on the SPR ship can be precisely controlled and translated into trimer densities that can be compared with and adjusted to the observed densities of Env on HIV-1 virions. With improved knowledge, simulations of trimer densities on virions, and thereby realistic average trimer distances, may render the measured degree of bivalency of binding to the antigen on the SPR chip relevant to neutralization. Some NAbs, however, can bind to both defective and native-like trimers, and this would enhance binding through bivalency; other NAbs recognize only the native-like trimers and that would limit their avidity.",

But this was uncleaved Env protein, later found to expose nonneutralization epitopes; and the SPR was based on immobilized antibody with trivalent Env in solution, which does not simulate the potentially bivalent but often monovalent binding of IgG to virions. Also surprising at the time of publication was that Env from a neutralization resistant strain bound with faster on-and off-rates to NAbs (and non-NAbs) than did Env from a sensitive variant. The on-and off-rate differences canceled each other out, yielding no net affinity difference. This would point to a greater importance of low off-rates in conferring neutralization sensitivity than high onrates, although the other caveats about the SPR conditions might invalidate comparisons with neutralization. Certainly, the relative influence of the on-and off-rate constants may vary. But how they vary will be determined by the length of the preincubation with NAb in the neutralization assay.

Third, viral replication proceeds to produce viral product or induce the expression of a reporter molecule. Fourth, the product is measured in an assay and converted to a signal and compared with noantibody and no-virus (background, noise) controls [31] . The first two phases can be varied; the first one can even be eliminated. The second one can be performed at reduced temperature, so that internalization and entry are prevented. Figure 3 : The kinetics of NAb binding. Soluble envelope glycoprotein oligomers can be immobilized on SPR chips via His or epitope tags. If the trimers are good structural mimics of native functional oligomers, and the density of trimers approximate that on the virion surface, then the NAb binding involved in neutralization can be simulated and its kinetic constants can be determined by SPR. Here, a soluble, stabilized trimer of the envelope glycoprotein of a Clade A isolate of HIV-1 was studied. The subunits of the trimer are labeled in the schematic to the lower right; the black bars represent engineered disulfide bonds that were introduced to stabilize each protomer of the trimer. The trimer was immobilized and the binding of NAbs and non-NAbs was compared. The sensorgrams show the response (RU) over time (s) during an association phase (upward curve) and a dissociation phase (downward curve: in several cases dissociation is very slow and barely measurable). Antibodies directed to different groups of epitopes, as indicated for the three diagrams, are compared. The nonneutralizing antibodies are marked with arrows. Thus, neutralization correlates eminently with binding to trimers that are native-like according to electron microscopy. The figure is reproduced from Sanders et al. [103] with modifications.",

It is notable, however, that the TRIM21-dependent mechanism of neutralization of adenovirus and perhaps other naked viruses [142] would have a different relationship to the suggested two modes of neutralization: to the extent that the infectivity is reduced already in suspension or entry is delayed, the cytoplasmic action of the NAbs becomes redundant.

The virions on their own usually have a specific infectious half-life in suspension and the suspension mode of neutralization can be measured as the shortening of that half-life [194, 197] . As an example, for enveloped viruses with noncovalently linked subunits of the entry-mediating surface proteins, the NAb effect may be to induce the dissociation of an outer subunit so that the virus loses the capacity to bind to receptors; in the case of HIV-1, soluble forms of the main receptor, CD4, induce the dissociation of the gp120 subunit from the envelope glycoprotein spike. Such induced shedding, also mediated by some NAbs, may represent a premature triggering similar to, or more drastic than, what is induced by CD4 and coreceptor interactions at the cell surface or in an endosome in the absence of antibody during uninhibited entry [84, 132, 133, 198] .",

Its relevance to protection in vivo will be contingent on prolonged periods of viral exposure to antibody before encounters with susceptible cells; that relevance would also depend on whether the antibody binding has nonneutralizing inhibitory effects such as opsonization of the viral particles for cellular destruction through phagocytosis. The latter might dominate. It should also be noted that the spontaneous as well as the induced decay may affect the number of entry-mediating molecules on the virion that must be inactivated by NAbs in order to block infection: an IC 50 value of neutralization is not fixed but can vary with the preincubation time.

Hence combinatorial mathematical equations, derived from the binomial theorem, can be applied to interpret the data [105, 107, 108, 110] . But also this approach entails pitfalls. If the entry protein is oligomeric and each virion, as is usual, has more than one oligomer, the modeling must simultaneously juggle two levels of analysis, each with its own potential threshold. One consequence is that quite different models can imply indistinguishable empirical data, because changes in the model premises at the oligomer and virion levels compensate each other [84, 105] . Notably, the premise that each virion only possesses a single entry-mediating oligomer, and therefore only needs one, translates into exactly the same equation as the most extreme incremental model mentioned before, namely, that each oligomer contributes equally to the infectivity, no matter how many intact oligomers are left per virion or how they are clustered.",

There are two problems. First, single-hit neutralization with Poissondistributed binding and an average of 1.4 NAb molecules per virion implies a residual infectivity of about 25%. Since no infectivity was detected, either the virions were nonspecifically damaged by the procedure or the precision of the assay was insufficient for this kind of analysis. Second, the Poisson analysis of neutralization requires knowledge of the number of NAbs bound and the ensuing residual infectivity. The transition from a mere serum concentration to the multiplicity of bound NAbs would require much more information, namely, the average affinity and concentration [106, 205] . And the theoretical curve for logarithmic residual infectivity as a function of NAb concentration is then not linear even for single-hit neutralization [106, 205] . Only the curve postulating single-hit neutralization with average NAb multiplicity of binding on the -axis is linear [205] . In practice, however, an approximately linear curve may very well arise if the lowest dilutions of the serum happen to yield NAb concentrations far above the average value. Hence linearity observed under such conditions, contrary to the argument invoked in the study [204] , is not evidence for single-hit molecularity.",

Or at least the predicted relative infectivity for each model at the threshold value could be calculated and the readings could be compared with the theoretical value. With other molecularities than 1 (a minimum of one NAb per virion required for complete neutralization), the reading on the -axis at = 1/e is as theoretically arbitrary as it would be at, say, 50% neutralization, which does not mean it is uninformative; at least it might refute a single-hit molecularity [31, 106] . For the record, Poisson analysis involves the following. The natural logarithm of the still infectious fraction of virus, ln( / 0 ), is plotted on the -axis as a function of the average number of NAbs per virion, , on the -axis. The minimum number of NAbs per virion required for neutralization is stipulated to have the integer value . The infectious fraction of virions will be equal to the cumulated fractions with fewer than NAbs bound to them: / 0 = \u2211 \u22121 =0 ( \u2212 )/ !. Thus with = 1, the contested single-hit molecularity, and at an average of 1 NAb per virion, that is, = 1, / 0 = \u22121 so that ln( / 0 ) = \u22121: if the single-hit hypothesis was true, approximately 37% of the infectivity would remain when the virions have on average one NAb bound to them.

The single-hit molecularity has been elevated to virtual dogma on spurious grounds; it has been disseminated by textbooks [207] . The discovery of the TRIM21-dependent mechanism suggests that single-hit neutralization is molecularly plausible; it would then have been believed previously for the wrong reasons, and largely about the wrong viruses. In reality, the neutralization of adenovirus infection of mouse embryonic fibroblasts and of the human epithelial cell line HeLa occurred at average numbers of NAbs per virion of 1.6 and 4.8, respectively, when the NAb was murine. Both cell lines were IFN-stimulated to maximize TRIM21 expression. The explanation for the differing results between the cell lines would be that murine TRIM21 has a higher affinity for the murine NAbs than does human TRIM21 [143] . At lower TRIM21 levels much higher occupancies were required. Or at the extreme end, even saturating concentrations of NAbs yielded no measurable neutralization; likewise Fc mutants of NAbs, unable to interact with TRIM21, failed to neutralize. These new findings shed much light on the context-dependent and nonabsolute molecularities that are sufficient for neutralization. They also suggest a remarkable inefficiency of neutralization at steps before cytoplasmic entry. Therefore older observations with which they sometimes seem to clash should be revisited.",

But now that strong evidence suggests the endocytic pathway is productive, and indeed even obligatory [83-85, 137, 209-211] , this effect of the low antibody occupancies has become intriguing. Enhancing effects of low NAb occupancies on HIV-1 have also been observed [106] .

If genetically based causes are excluded, epigenetic ones, such as glycan-processing may be responsible for the persistence. If neutralization required conformational changes in the viral proteins, they might be induced to different degrees, and some virions might then be more resistant to the effect of NAb binding [58] .

It should be noted that the law of mass action does not imply any PF ( Figure 5 ): only when a subset of target molecules have aberrant, substantially reduced affinity would the neutralization tail off. Burnet fruitfully suggested that NAb dissociation is responsible for the PF [212] . This is compatible with the findings that both the addition of secondary antibodies, cross-linking those in the neutralizing serum, and the combination of NAbs to distinct epitopes can reduce the size of the PF [213] . The dissociation hypothesis gains further plausibility when applied to the dynamic competition between receptors and NAbs at the site of entry. It is also relevant that the degree of monovalent binding by IgG rises when binding approaches saturation, as expected from the well-established prozone effect [216] . Thus the avidity decreases and the competitive binding to receptors is favored over that to paratopes.",

Thus stoichiometry as assessed both by calorimetry and SPR correlated with the size of the PF: the higher the stoichiometry, the lower the PF [183] . This finding might also be related to dissociation, because with a stoichiometry of one paratope per viral oligomer, the vulnerability to dissociation would be greater. Indeed, other evidence indicates that a single IgG molecule per trimer, of some NAbs, is sufficient to block the function of that trimer [84, 105, 108, 110, 111, 114, 202] .

Thus, neutralization of adenovirus by the same NAb leaves higher or lower PFs in inverse proportion to the levels of TRIM21 in the target cell [143] . But eventually a double plateau establishes itself: increasing NAb occupancies and TRIM21 expression levels reach diminishing returns, and the residual infectivity plateaus out. Indeed, the higher the viral dose is, the more easily the combined defense by NAbs and TRIM21 is overwhelmed. Quite plausibly, other cellular factors, those responsible for the degradation of NAbvirus complexes after the TRIM21-mediated ubiquitination, become limiting at this point. Clearly, the old problem of the PF has been greatly illuminated by the discovery of the role of auxiliary cellular factors in neutralization. The question is how far these insights could extend beyond adenovirus neutralization [142] .",

That would imply synergy in neutralization, benefitting the induction of antibody responses to multiple epitopes by vaccination. But synergy in neutralization has also been observed when there seems to be none at the level of antibody binding to the antigen molecule and indeed when there could not be any synergy in binding because the synergizing NAbs are directed to overlapping epitopes [218] . Then the explanation must be different. A plausible one is the heterogeneity in the population of target molecules, that is, the antigens, which can be extensive for some viruses [219] . This heterogeneity does not have to be genetically determined alone but could also stem from variation in posttranslational modification. Thus, synergy would arise from how two NAbs complement each other by covering different epitopes, or sometimes different variants of the same epitope, for which the NAbs have distinct affinities. This kind of explanation would apply equally to synergy in efficiency, that is, potency, as in efficacy, the latter being reflected in a reduced PF.",

The slope of neutralization curves has been much less studied than the midpoint, that is, the potency, but it reflects an important property of the NAb and is partly the product of epitope heterogeneity; it can also be subject to paratope heterogeneity even for monoclonal antibodies when the intrinsic affinity is modulated by, for example, tyrosine sulfation, which will not be achieved uniformly over populations of NAbs produced naturally [215] .",

For some viruses such as HIV-1 it is already very difficult to obtain sufficiently good mimics of the native Env protein and to focus the immune response on conserved regions, so that the antibodies induced will also recognize the Env trimers of naturally occurring divergent variants of the virus. Therefore any further complications, such as requirements for antibodies to induce particular conformational changes in the antigens or indeed elaborate posttranslational modifications required for the strongest binding, would be most unwelcome. Likewise, it is gratifying if neutralization works in such a way that antibodies capable of blocking it do not readily arise: it may still be impossible to avoid inducing some irrelevant, inert antibodies or, with some viruses, antibodies that enhance infection.",

(b) The same trimer is shown in complex with a soluble form of CD4 and the Fab of an antibody that binds to the coreceptor-binding site (17b). This NAb neutralizes poorly as IgG and better as a Fab, because the epitope is not constitutively present and is relatively inaccessible in the viral entry complex when induced by CD4 interactions. Three copies each of CD4 and Fab molecules can be seen in the top view. (c) The same combinations as in (a) and (b) are shown first and last in the row.",
