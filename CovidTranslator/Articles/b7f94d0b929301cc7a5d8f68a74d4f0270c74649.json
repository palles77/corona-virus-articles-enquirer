After electroporation in human cells, recombinant 36 fluorescent Ndc80 and Mis12 multi-subunit complexes displayed native localization, 37 physically interacted with endogenous binding partners, and functionally complemented 38 depleted endogenous counterparts to promote mitotic checkpoint signaling and 39 chromosome segregation.

Recombinant BUBR1 1-571 (encompassing residues 1-571 of the 1050-153 residue BubR1 protein, which are sufficient for checkpoint function) (1) fused to a cyan 154 fluorescent protein (CFP) was introduced into HeLa cells at an EP slurry concentration of 155 10 \uf06d\uf04d. In mitotically arrested cells (by addition of the spindle poison nocodazole, a 156 condition that activates the SAC), CFP-BUBR1 1-571 distinctly localized to kinetochores, as 157 revealed by the typical punctuate staining and by co-localization with CREST, an established 158 kinetochore marker ( Figure 1C) . We have shown previously that BUBR1 kinetochore 159 recruitment in human cells requires dimerization with kinetochore-bound BUB1, a BUBR1 160 paralog, through segments that encompass a predicted helical domain in the two proteins 161 (33). In agreement with these previous observations, recombinant CFP-BUBR1 1-571-\u2206Helix , a 162 deletion mutant of BUBR1 lacking the BUB1 binding helix (deletion of residues 432-484) 163 was unable to localize to kinetochores (Figure 1D-F) . Collectively, these results demonstrate 164 that, following EP, recombinant CFP-BUBR1 1-571 binds to its endogenous kinetochore 165 receptor BUB1 in target cells. The efficiency of CFP-BUBR1 1-571 delivery was high and most 166 cells displayed uniform levels of the recombinant protein ( Figure S3) . Thus, electroporation 167 can deliver very similar amounts of recombinant protein into each cell. In the course of this 168 study, this became to be recognized as a general feature of this approach, largely 169 independently of the protein used. 170",

These functions 222 make MIS12C necessary for timely chromosome congression and faithful cell division. To 223 test the functionality of the recombinant CFP-MIS12 complex, we performed a 224 complementation assay in HeLa cells depleted of endogenous MIS12 complex by the RNA 225 interference (RNAi) methods using silencing RNAs (siRNAs) against multiple subunits, as 226 previously described (43). Effective depletion of MIS12C subunits and uptake of fluorescent 227 proteins was demonstrated by Western blotting (Figure 2A) .

In agreement with previous reports, depletion of MIS12C 231 compromised chromosome congression ( Figure 2B-C) , a consequence of reduced 232 kinetochore levels of NDC80 and KNL1 (43). As shown by live-cell microscopy, EP 233 delivery of CFP-MIS12C into depleted cells, but not of a CFP control, rescued chromosome 234 congression essentially to the levels observed in control cells, indicating that the recombinant 235 complex is functionally active (Figure 2B- The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the author/funder.

A previously described 293 NDC80 mutant (9A) carrying nine alanine mutations at the phosphorylation sites in the 294 protein's N-terminus establishes hyper-stable KT-MT attachments that cannot be corrected, 295 resulting in frequent chromosome congression errors (47) (48) (49) . We asked if a NDC80C 9A -296 GFP mutant electroporated in HeLa cells had dominant-negative effects in an established 297 biorientation and error correction assay (50). HeLa cells were allowed to enter mitosis in 298 presence of STLC, an inhibitor of the Eg5 kinesin (51) whose activity is crucially required for 299 centrosome separation and spindle bipolarization, resulting in the accumulation of 300 monopolar spindles in which sister kinetochores frequently attach to the same microtubule 301 organizing center (MTOC, the centrosome in this case) in a condition known as synthelic 302 attachment. Upon washout of STLC, Eg5 reactivation, and spindle bipolarization, a 303 functional error correction pathway is required to resolve the synthelic attachments and 304 achieve correct metaphase alignment (50). In this setup, control cells electroporated with 305 GFP or NDC80C WT -GFP corrected erroneous attachments and aligned their chromosomes 306",

Here, we have assessed the suitability of 367 batch EP for delivering recombinant proteins into living mammalian cells for various 368 applications in cell biology. In comparison to previous studies that focused on cytosolic 369 proteins devoid of specific localization, our focus was on kinetochores, which are small, 370 discrete subcellular structures. This was crucial, because it enabled a detailed assessment of 371 the effective degree of functional complementation of the electroporated samples. Our 372 results identify EP as a rapid, efficient, and semi-quantitative technique that enables the 373 delivery into various cultured mammalian cell lines of proteins of variable mass and 374 hydrodynamic radius, including the highly elongated NDC80C. Importantly, we provide 375 clear evidence that the delivered proteins remain structurally and functionally intact after 376 delivery, as witnessed by their correct kinetochore localization and, where applicable, ability 377 to complement RNAi-based depletion, dominant negative effects, and immunoprecipitation 378 with endogenous interacting partners. Thus, in addition to its ease of application, EP is very 379 attractive because it allows delivery in sufficiently large cohorts of cells, and is therefore 380 compatible with cell biochemistry, as clearly shown here. 381 .

Here, we have demonstrated how the introduction of a farnesyl chain in 387 vitro rescued the kinetochore localization of Spindly in cells treated with a farnesyl 388 transferase inhibitor. In the future, this approach may be extended to other lipid 389 modifications, and may allow monitoring the behavior of only one or a few modified 390 proteins at the time. Another obvious advantage of in vitro manipulations of macromolecules 391 is that it allows precision labeling with small fluorescent dyes, potentially bypassing limits 392 associated with tagging target proteins with bulky genetically encoded fluorescent proteins. 393",

After expression and 265 purification with an established protocol of a fluorescent version of the complex containing 266 NDC80-GFP (Figure S2), we electroporated it into cycling HeLa cells at an EP slurry 267 concentration of 5 \u00b5M. 12 hours after electroporation, cells were imaged by live cell video-268 microscopy. This revealed kinetochore localization of the recombinant NDC80-GFP 269 complex (Figure 3A), indicating that the considerable length of the complex is compatible 270 with efficient delivery. 271 HeLa cells carrying recombinant NDC80C-GFP in addition to endogenous NDC80C 272 displayed no alterations in cell cycle progression and proceeded through the different stages 273 of mitosis without detectable changes when compared to control cells (Figure 3A-B and 274 Supplementary movies S5-S9). Thus, delivering exogenous NDC80C-GFP does not cause 275 obvious cell cycle alterations or cytotoxicity. When NDC80C-GFP was electroporated into 276 other human cell lines, such as RPE, HEK293 and U2OS, equally clear kinetochore signals 277 were observed (Figure 3C). 278 To test weather recombinant NDC80C-GFP complexes establish their expected physical 279 interactions after EP delivery, we performed GFP-immunoprecipitation (GFP-IP) assays on 280 protein extracts generated from mitotic HeLa cells previously electroporated with NDC80C-281 GFP. Western blotting demonstrated that MIS12 and BUB1 were present in the NDC80C-282 GFP precipitates, but not in precipitates of GFP (Figure 3D). Thus, the electroporated 283 NDC80-GFP establishes physiologic interactions with its endogenous binding partners, 284 demonstrating the versatility of EP as a technique to probe protein interactions in living cells 285 both through imaging and through biochemistry. 286 287 An NDC80C mutant triggers a dominant-negative chromosome alignment defect 288Chromosome bi-orientation implies that the sister kinetochores attach to microtubules 289 emanating from opposite spindle poles.

This indicated that wild type mCherry-Spindly becomes farnesylated after intracellular 338 delivery. To further substantiate this, we treated cells with FTI-227, a selective farnesyl-339 transferase inhibitor (58). In presence of FTI-227, localization of recombinant mCherry-340 Spindly or GFP-Spindly was greatly reduced (Figure 4B-C), confirming that FT activity is 341 required for Spindly localization. 342 We therefore asked if in vitro farnesylation by FT rescued the localization of Spindly in cells 343 treated with FTI-227. mCherry-Spindly was farnesylated in vitro with recombinant 344 farnesyltransferase (FT) and farnesyl-pyrophosphate as a substrate, as described previously 345 (57). The resulting farnesylated mCherry-Spindly (mCherry-Spindly F ) and untreated GFP-346 Spindly were co-electroporated at the same EP slurry concentration (10 \u00b5M) in HeLa cells 347 that had been treated with FTI-227 for the previous 24 hours. Remarkably, mCherry-348 Spindly F , but not GFP-Spindly, successfully targeted kinetochores, showing that the 349 complementation of FT activity in vitro had bypassed the blockade of FT activity in cells by 350 FTI-227.

A Bacmid was then 449 produced from EMBacY cells and subsequently used to transfect Sf9 cells and produce 450 baculovirus. Baculovirus was amplified through three rounds of amplification and used to 451 infect Tnao38 cells. Cells infected with virus were cultured for 72 h before harvesting.

Peak fractions containing the NDC80C 9A -GFP complex 464were collected and further concentrated in a 10 kDa cut-off Amicon concentrator before 465 being flash frozen in liquid N2 and stored at -80\u00b0C. Recombinant CFP-MIS12 complex 466 was generated by fusing N-terminal CFP to PMF1. Baculoviral transfer vectors encoding 467 CFP-Mis12C expression were generated using biGBac platform (63). Baculoviruses were 468 generated in Sf9 cells, and expression of CFP-tagged MIS12C was carried out in Tnao38 469 cells for 72h-96h, at 27\uf0b0C. CFP-Mis12C was purified by a three-step protocol, as described470 previously for the non-fluorescent version (39): i) affinity purification of filtered supernatant 471 with 5 ml HisTrap FF column (GE Healthcare) and step elution with 300 mM imidazole; ii) 472 anion-exchange of the dialyzed eluate with 6 ml Resource Q column, elution with linear 473 PMSF).

In turn, these complexes recruit the protein KNL1, the spindle 807 assembly checkpoint (SAC) components BUB1, BUBR1, MAD1 and MAD2, and the outer 808 kinetochore proteins RZZ and Spindly. B) Overview of the electroporation (EP) work-flow 809 using adherent cells. (1) Cells are cultured under defined growth conditions according to 810 experimental requirements. (2) Prior to EP, cells are harvested by trypsinization, washed in 811 PBS, counted and resuspended in EP buffer. (3) Recombinant protein diluted in EP buffer is 812 added to cell slurries at desired concentrations (this stage is called EP slurry). (4) Cells are 813 pulsed between 1 and 3-times to allow for efficient delivery of recombinant proteins. (5) 814 Cells are tripsinised and then washed twice to remove non-incorporated protein, and then 815 plated on cover slips or culture flasks to allow for recovery. (6) After a recovery period, cells 816 are processed for imaging. C) Following EP of CFP-BUBR1 1-571 and over-night recovery, 817 cells were treated for 6 hours with nocodazole and then prepared for immunofluorescence 818 analysis. Kinetochores were stained with the marker CREST and DNA with SiR-Hoechst-819 647. Insets represents magnifications of the boxed kinetochores. Scale bar = 5 \u00b5m. D) CFP 820 alone, CFP-BUBR1 1-571 and the BUB1-binding-deficient mutant CFP-BUBR1 1-571-\uf044Helix were 821 electroporated under the same conditions used in C. Protein extracts generated from 822 electroporated cells were subjected to western blotting analysis with the indicated antibodies. 823 E) CFP-BUBR1 1-571-\uf044Helix fails to localize to kinetochores. Kinetochores were stained with the 824 marker CREST and DNA with SiR-Hoechst-647. Scale bar = 5 \uf06dm. F) Quantification of 825 KT levels for electroporated CFP proteins from cells shown in E. Each symbol represents a 826 single cell. Yellow lines indicate median values \uf0b1 interquartile range. G) SAC protein 827 MAD2 TAMRA electroporated into cells display proper localization to unattached kinetochores. 828 Kinetochores were stained with the marker CREST and DNA with DAPI. Scale bar = 5 829 \uf06dm. Insets represent magnifications of the indicated KT. H) Simultaneous electroporation 830 complex targets kinetochores and functionally complements 836 depletion of the endogenous complex 837 A) The indicated proteins, including CFP-labeled recombinant MIS12C, were electroporated 838 in mCherry-H2B-expressing HeLa cells previously treated with siRNAs to deplete the 839 endogenous MIS12C. Western blotting of cellular protein levels in extracts was performed 840 and showed a depletion in MIS12 and PMF1 levels of 93,7% and 87,6% respectively. B) 841 Frames collected at the indicated time points (min) of time-lapse live-cell fluorescence 842 microscopy movies depicts chromosome congression and segregation of cells from A. Two 843 representative phenotypes observed in cells with depleted MIS12C that were concomitantly 844 electroporated with CFP as control are shown. Green and red signal represents, respectively, 845 CFP proteins and DNA. Scale bar = 5 \u00b5m. C) Quantification of chromosome congression 846 and segregation defects in B. Each symbol represents a single cell. Yellow lines indicate 847 mean values \uf0b1 SD. D) Electroporated CFP-MIS12C rescues SAC defects in H2B-mCherry 848 HeLa cells depleted for endogenous MIS12C. Duration of mitosis (based on DNA and cell 849 morphology) of individual cells treated as in A but imaged in the presence of nocodazole 0.3 850 \uf06d\uf04d was plotted. Yellow lines indicate mean values \uf0b1 SD. Cellular delivery of a protein complex with an exceptionally large hydrodynamic 854 radius 855 A) GFP-labeled recombinant NDC80C WT binds to kinetochores and its localization is 856 compatible with normal mitotic progression. Panels show timepoints of time-lapse movies 857 for asynchronously growing HeLa cells electroporated with recombinant GFP proteins and 858 imaged live every 10 minutes. DNA was stained with SiR-Hoechst-647 and is shown in red. \uf0b1 SD. C) Additional human cell lines were electroporated with NDC80C-GFP. RPE1 862 cells are non-transformed human retinal pigmented epithelium cells. HEK293 cells are 863 human epithelium kidney cells. U2OS cells are human osteosarcoma cells. Following 864 recovery and staining with SiR-Hoechst-647 DNA dye, cells were imaged live and display a 865 clearly visible kinetochore localization of the delivered NDC80C-GFP complex. Scale bar = 866 5 \u00b5m. D) Immunoprecipitation analysis of protein extracts from cells treated as in A shows 867 that EP-delivered NDC80C-GFP WT establishes normal interactions with its endogenous KT 868 partners. Western blotting panels show immunoprecipitates performed with \uf061-GFP beads 869 and probed with the indicated antibodies. E) An error correction assay for the EP-delivery 870 of a NDC80C 9A -GFP mutant shows a dominant-negative effect on the correction of 871 improper KT-MT attachments. Panels display representative images of electroporated HeLa 872 cells treated with STLC to accumulate erroneous synthelic KT-MT attachments, followed by 873 STLC washout, release into MG132 (proteasome inhibitor that prevents mitotic exit), and 874 fixation 150 minutes after STLC-release. Inability to correct erroneous attachments results in 875 uncongressed chromosomes. Control cells were electroporated with GFP alone. Numbers 876 represent the percentage of cells with uncongressed chromosomes for each condition. KTs 877 were labeled with anti-CREST immunostaining, microtubules (MT) with an anti-TUBULIN 878 antibody and DNA with DAPI. Insets represent magnificatis of the indicated KT. In vitro farnesylation allows Spindly localization when farnesyl transferase is 883 inhibited 884 A) Kinetochore localization of unmodified recombinant Spindly depends on cellular 885 farnesylation. Panels show representative images of cells transduced with unfarnesylated 886 mCherry-Spindly in nocodazole-treated HeLa cells. Mutation of Cys602 to alanine prevents 887 farnesylation upon EP and reduces KT levels of the delivered protein. Kinetochores were 888 stained with CREST antibodies and DNA with DAPI. Controls cells were electroporated 889 . Insets represent magnifications of the indicated kinetochores. Scale bar = 5 890 \u00b5m. B) Quantification of KT levels for electroporated Spindly from cells in A and C. Each 891 symbol represents a single cell. Yellow lines indicate mean values \uf0b1 SD. C) In vitro 892 farnesylation of mCherry-Spindly before EP bypasses the need of cellular farnesylation to 893 achieve kinetochore localization. Cells treated with the farnesyl-transferase inhibitor FTI-277 894 were electroporated with either GFP, GFP-Spindly, mCherry, mCherry-Spindly, or in vitro 895 pre-farnesylated mCherry-Spindly (mCherry-Spindly F ) and then processed for 896 immunofluorescence analysis. Kinetochores were stained for CREST and DNA with DAPI. 897 Insets represent magnifications of the indicated KT. FP= Fluorescent protein. Scale bar",

MFI values were 907 corrected for average cell sizes and corresponding volumes. Lines correspond to linear fits 908 connecting individual measurement points. Error bars are SDM from 4 independent 909 samples. B) Quantification of EP-mediated protein uptake by fluorimetric analysis. Extracts 910 from HeLa cells electroporated with mCherry and analyzed with a fluorimeter show that 911 uptake is proportional to the input protein concentration. Fluorescence intensity of 912 protein extracts generated from a known number of cells that were electroporated with 913 different amounts of recombinant mCherry were quantified with a fluorimeter and 914 plotted against an input titration curve. The values obtained were subtracted for the 915 intensity values measured from a mock EP sample.

Defined concentrations of recombinant N-terminally acetylated \uf061SYN 919 serve as input control. Average intracellular concentrations are in the range of 0.05 to 0.5 920 \u00b5M, calculated based on experimentally determined cell volumes (21). D) By comparison to 921 the endogenous levels determined in panel C, cells electroporated with 400 \u00b5M \uf061SYN in the 922 EP slurry harbor ~100-fold higher levels of the recombinant protein (see input 923 concentrations for reference). E) Electroporation of \uf061SYN in A2780 cells produces low 924 levels of cell damage. Panels show anti-\uf061SYN immunofluorescence detection in A2780 cells 925 at different time-points following batch EP and recovery. DNA is shown in blue (DAPI), 926 actin in green (phalloidin) and \uf061SYN in red. Note that most cells harbor \uf061SYN (high 927 penetrance) and that intracellular protein levels are similar between cells (uniform delivery 928 efficiency). 22 hours after EP, adherent cells regain their physiological cell morphologies, an 929",

Improperly attached kinetochores trigger the spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC), causing a 237 mitotic arrest that delays entry into anaphase (29). The checkpoint pathway exhausts its 238 function only after all chromosomes have achieved bi-orientation on the mitotic spindle. Despite causing dramatic chromosome congression failures, depletion of endogenous 240 MIS12C is hardly compatible with checkpoint function because cells lacking the MIS12C 241 also fail to recruit KNL1, which is required for SAC signaling. Thus, MIS12C depleted cells 242 have a strongly weakened SAC that results in their premature anaphase and mitotic exit (43, 243 44). To assess SAC function under our RNAi conditions, we treated cells with 0.3 \uf06d\uf04d of the 244 microtubule-depolymerizer nocodazole, thus creating conditions that potently activate 245 checkpoint signaling in control cells. We then measured, by live-cell video microscopy, the 246 cells' ability to sustain a prolonged mitotic arrest. In agreement with the previous studies, 247 cells depleted of MIS12C were unable to mount a strong mitotic arrest and underwent 248 mitotic exit in presence of multiple unattached or incompletely attached chromosomes, 249indicative of a checkpoint defect. Electroporated CFP was unable to restore the SAC 250 response, while recombinant CFP-MIS12C restored mitotic duration to values similar to 251 those observed in control cells, indicating full rescue of SAC activity (Figure 2D).Collectively, these results indicate that electroporated recombinant MIS12C targeted the KT 253 as a functionally intact complex and that EP can be used for biological complementation 254 assays in combination with knockdown or knockouts. 255EP of a protein complex with an exceptionally large hydrodynamic radius and itsWith a long axis of approximately 20 nm (39, 40) the MIS12C is rather elongated, a feature 259 that at least qualitatively does not appear to interfere with efficient EP.
