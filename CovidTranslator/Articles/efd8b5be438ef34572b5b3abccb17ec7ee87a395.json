The LDH enzyme is present in all cells, but it is concentrated in muscle, liver, and kidney. LDH exists as five isozymes, LDH-1 through LDH-5, each composed of four subunits. Differential LDH isozyme levels are used diagnostically (Markert et al., 1975) . Isozyme LDH-1 (4H) has four heart subunits and is the major isozyme in heart. Isozyme LDH-2 (3H1M) has three heart and one muscle subunit and is the major isozyme in the macrophage-monocyte system and serum. The LDH-3 (2H2M) isozyme has two heart and two muscle subunits and is the major isozyme in lungs. Isozyme LDH-4 (1H3M) has one heart and three muscle subunits and is the primary isozyme in kidneys. The LDH-5 (4M) isozyme has four muscle subunits and is the major isozyme in liver and skeletal muscle. The concentration of LDH is elevated in serum as a result of organ infarction and significant cell death that results in loss of cytoplasm. For example, elevations of LDH result from conditions such as hepatitis, shock, hypoxia, extreme hypothermia, and meningitis, among others. The LDH enzyme has often been used in laboratory animals, along with troponin levels, to detect myocardial damage (Evans, 2009; Herman et al., 2006) . However, LDH stability is highly susceptible to freezing, and values are affected by storage conditions (Mitruka and Rawnsley, 1981; Tietz, 1976) . ",

The rabbit should be restrained as described above and the ear warmed by gentle stroking or using a lamp. Acepromazine maleate (1-5 mg/kg IM) may be given to calm the rabbit and aid in vasodilation. Topical oil of wintergreen, xylene, and local anesthetics have all been used to aid in vasodilation (Hrapkiewicz and Medina, 2007) . Xylene especially may be irritating if not thoroughly rinsed off the ear after blood withdrawal (Suckow and Douglas, 1997) . The collection site should be shaved and then wiped with alcohol or an antiseptic solution. Blood is first collected from the vein near the base of the ear, with successive samples taken from the alternate ear or by moving distally toward the tip of the ear. A 25G or 26G needle or butterfly catheter may be inserted into the vein while pressure is applied to the vein at the base of the ear. It is difficult to obtain sufficient blood volume using this method in dwarf breed rabbits due to the small size of their ears (Melillo, 2007) , and catheterization of this vein in dwarf breeds may lead to vascular necrosis, thrombosis, or sloughing of the ear (Vennen and Mitchell, 2009) .",

The lateral saphenous vein runs across the tarsal joint and can be sampled with a 1-ml syringe on a 23G-27G needle after applying digital pressure on the thigh to hold off the vein. The cephalic vein and tarsal vein are also accessible on the guinea pig, although only small volumes can be obtained from these sites, and bruising and hemorrhage often result.

In the guinea pig, the right jugular vein is larger than the left and will yield up to 2.5 ml of blood. A 24G needle on a 1-ml syringe can be directed caudally to enter the jugular vein just cranial to the clavicle (Shomer et al., 1999) . The cranial vena cava can be accessed with a 22G or 23G needle on a 3-or 6-ml syringe that is directed caudally into the sternal notch under the first rib. A ketamine-xylazine mixture has been described as the preferable method of anesthesia for this route of blood sampling (Dang et al., 2008) . However, the cranial position of the heart makes cardiac hemorrhage a significant risk when blood is sampled from the cranial vena cava (Joslin, 2009 ). The femoral vein can be used to collect up to 3 ml of blood with the guinea pig under anesthesia, in dorsal recumbency, and with the rear leg abducted. A 23G needle on a 1-3-ml syringe can be directed at a 45-90\u00b0 angle to the skin and inserted just ventral to the pulsing femoral artery within the femoral triangle (Joslin, 2009) .",

The lateral tail vein can be used for blood collection in an unanesthetized gerbil, although caution should be taken because of the increased risk of tail degloving injury in this species (Joslin, 2009) . Anesthesia should be used in the gerbil for blood collection from sites other than the tail vein. The saphenous vein or metatarsal vein can be distended using a tourniquet proximal to the stifle and a small blood sample is collected into the hub of a 22G needle. A 0.1-0.3-ml blood sample can be collected from the retro-orbital venous sinus of a gerbil by advancing a microhematocrit tube through the lateral canthus and holding off the external jugular vein behind the mandible (Joslin, 2009) . The medial canthus is also a viable approach to the retro-orbital sinus in the gerbil (Dyer and Cervasio, 2008) . Alternatively, small volumes of blood may be obtained from the lateral metatarsal vein, or from a clipped toenail. Large volumes of blood can be obtained by cardiac puncture under anesthesia as a terminal procedure in the gerbil, as in other species (Hrapkiewicz and Medina, 2007) .",

The remaining nucleated particles are leukocytes and these are quantified within a grid under a microscope. Electronic cell counters use a similar approach, except that red blood cells are lysed with a detergent solution before nucleated particles are quantified. A quantitative buffy coat analysis system (QBC, Becton Dickinson) expands the buffy coat layer in a specialized microhematocrit tube and quantifies the leukocytes by optical scanning.

The proximal femur is generally the preferred site in most species, including the rabbit. A spinal needle with stylet is typically used and inserted in the trochanteric ridge of the femur (Vennen and Mitchell, 2009) . The femur may also be surgically resected for direct access to the bone marrow (Powsner and Fly, 1962) , but this approach is not recommended due to the importance of the rear limb for weight-bearing in the rabbit (Suckow and Douglas, 1997) .",

The neutrophil cytoplasm stains pink because of numerous small granules, with a reddish hue due to several larger dark-staining granules (Campbell and Ellis, 2007) . By electron microscopy, these granules are identified as primary or azurophilic granules and secondary or specific granules, respectively (Jain, 1986) . Primary and secondary granules are believed to arise from two different sites on the Golgi apparatus (Marshall, 2008) .

For example, eosinophilia may be associated with abscesses or healing wounds in the rabbit or in cases of atopy and pyoderma (Melillo, 2007) . Elevated eosinophil numbers may be caused by a parasitic disease such as Encephalitozoon cuniculi in the rabbit, although eosinophilia is reportedly an uncommon response to parasites or hypersensitivity in this species (Melillo, 2007) . BASOPHILS The reference range for basophil numbers in normal rabbits is 0-10% (Table 3 .10), but can be up to 30% of the white blood cell differential count in healthy rabbits (Benson and Paul-Murphy, 1999; Vennen and Mitchell, 2009 ). The rabbit has higher basophil numbers than most species and may be the only laboratory animal with a significant number of basophils in circulation (Benson and Paul-Murphy, 1999) . Circulating basophils are usually inversely proportional to the number of tissue mast cells. Rabbit basophils are 8-12 \u00b5m in diameter, which is similar in size to the neutrophil. The nucleus is light purple and is less segmented than the nuclei of eosinophils or neutrophils. The rabbit basophil has many purple-black cytoplasmic granules (Campbell and Ellis, 2007) .",

Total leukocyte number is higher in blood obtained from male chinchillas anesthetized with ketamine and xylazine compared to blood obtained by cardiac puncture post-mortem (de Oliveira Silva et al., 2005) .Lymphocytes The reference range for lymphocyte number in the chinchilla is 19-98% (Table 3 .10).The lymphocyte is the most common circulating leukocyte in the chinchilla. The chinchilla responds to inflammation with an early increase in neutrophils and decrease in lymphocytes, resulting in little change in the total leukocyte count (Riggs and Mitchell, 2009) . Neutrophils The reference range for neutrophil number in the chinchilla is 9-78% (Table 3 .10). The neutrophil is the second most common circulating leukocyte in the chinchilla (Riggs and Mitchell, 2009 ). The chinchilla neutrophil has a nucleus that may be hyposegmented, similar to the Pelger-Huet anomaly in the rabbit. Heterophils lack myeloperoxidase, the enzyme that liquefies purulent material, causing chinchilla pus to be thick and caseous (Riggs and Mitchell, 2009) . Eosinophils The reference range for eosinophil number in the chinchilla is 0-9% (Table 3 .10). These cells are uncommon in the circulation of normal chinchillas (Riggs and Mitchell, 2009) .Basophils The reference range for basophil number in the chinchilla is 0-11% (Table 3 .10). These cells are uncommon in the circulation of normal chinchillas (Riggs and Mitchell, 2009) .Basophil and monocyte numbers were lower in blood obtained from male chinchillas anesthetized with ketamine and xylazine compared to blood obtained by cardiac puncture post-mortem (de Oliveira Silva et al., 2005) .Monocytes The reference range for monocyte number in the chinchilla is 0-6% (Table 3 .10). These cells are uncommon in the circulation of normal chinchillas (Riggs and Mitchell, 2009) .",
