A seroprevalence survey in 30 villages using haemagglutination inhibition (HI) tests for infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) and NDV antibodies was carried out from December 1997 to June 1998. The seroprevalences were 56.5% (95% CI 50^63%) for IBV and 2.2% (95% CI 0.5^3.8%) for NDV. All the villages had chickens that were positive for antibodies to IBV and nine of the villages had chickens that were positive for antibodies to NDV. This suggests that IBV may be responsible for a large proportion of the respiratory disease observed in backyard chickens in Yucatan. The implications of these \u00a2ndings are discussed, including the highly susceptible status of the backyard chickens in Yucatan to NDV and the possibility of this virus being one cause of the syndrome known as mortandad by the local people.",

Being part of the peninsula with the same name, it is an important feeding stop for migratory birds, including waterfowl, travelling between North America and Central and South America. Yucatan was o\u00a4cially declared free of NDV in its velogenic viscerotropic form in 1995 and it has so far mantained this status. Very little evidence of the presence of this virus has been found in backyard chickens, by isolation or serology, although a proper study has not been carried out. Despite the absence of virulent virus, it would seem likely that village chickens become infected with ND viruses of low virulence for chickens, since such viruses are thought to be enzootic in wild birds (Alexander et al., 1997) , which are in constant contact with free-range chickens. On the other hand, antibodies to IBV were found in a large proportion (80%) of samples obtained from backyard chickens from two Yucatecan communities and processed at the Immunology Department of the Faculty of Veterinary Medicine and Animal Production, Autonomous University of Yucatan (FMVZ-UADY). One IBV isolate of unknown pathogenicity, but antigenically di\u00a1erent from 12 reference strains, was obtained from backyard chickens in Yucatan that were experiencing respiratory disease (Gutierrez-Ruiz et al., 1998) . Respiratory signs and egg-shell defects are commonly observed in backyard birds, suggesting active IBV infection.",

The seroprevalence for IBV (56.5% 95% CI 50^63%) found in this study may be an under estimate, since only one serotype was used as antigen, although the M41 serotype usually gives more cross-reactions than other serotypes (Alexander et al., 1976) . In a survey performed on free-range chickens in California, 46.7% of 30 \u00a3ocks examined and 21.8% of birds tested were positive for IBV antibodies by an ELISA test (McBride et al., 1991) .

It might be expected that chickens located in towns around which commercial farms are situated would have higher prevalences owing to more frequent contact with vaccine strains used in commercial enterprises, but the results with naive backyard chickens indicate that this was not the case. All the commercial farms are located in the central zone of the state of Yucatan, but only small di\u00a1erences in seroprevalence were observed in the four zones into which the state is divided. A more likely explanation for the variation in seroprevalence is that, although active vaccination is not practised in villages against any disease, it is known that local governments every now and then introduce into their communities packages consisting of 6^10 chickens of commercial lines (broilers or laying types) whose origins are di\u00a4cult to trace but which may be from the surplus at commercial hatcheries, where live IBV vaccines are usually applied to 1-day-old chicks. Another explanation could be that di\u00a1erent IBV variants of di\u00a1ering pathogenicity are distributed in Yucatan, some of which have higher transmission rates than others. Also, the sampling design used in this study, although adequate to determine the overall seroprevalence in the state, is not necessarily the best to determine the actual seroprevalence in the individual communities; a much larger sampling number would be needed to achieve this. Any or all of these factors may have been involved in producing the observed di\u00a1erences in prevalence.",

            "text": "Eleven of the 21 positive sera had ND HI titres of only 4 log 2 (1/16), with 5 of 9 towns having only one reactor. This suggests that these may have been false positive results or perhaps that the birds were derived from those distributed by the government and vaccinated with live attenuated vaccines as day-old chicks. Three towns had chickens with titres of log 2 57, and, although the owners of these birds stated that they had not been vaccinated against NDV, there is a possibility that some of them had been vaccinated with more than one dose of vaccine before being introduced into the towns by the respective local governments. Another possible explanation of the results is that a slow circulation of \u00a2eld virus was occurring at the time of sampling, although no isolations were made. The low prevalence or absence in the HI test of detectable antibodies to NDV in the 30 communities sampled indicates that the backyard chickens in those communities would be highly susceptible to pathogenic NDV infections (Allan and Gough, 1974) . In their serological study in Uganda, Mukiibi-Muka and Olaho-Mukani (1998) found that the birds from one village out of the three sampled did not have antibodies to NDV, which indicates that, even in enzootic areas, some villages can remain fully susceptible to infection with virulent NDV. A seroprevalence of 4% was found in free-range chickens in California using an ELISA test (McBride et al., 1991) . Conditions were di\u00a1erent from those in Mexico but, despite there being no con\u00a2rmation of transmission between commercial and backyard \u00a3ocks, these researchers pointed out that the disease status could change at any time owing to lack of immunity and that therefore biosecurity measures should be reinforced (McBride et al., 1991) .",

Un estudio de sero-prevalencia en 30 pueblos usando las pruebas de inhibicion para la hemaglutinacion para el virus de la bronquitis infecciosa (VBI) y VEN se llevo a cabo de diciembre de 1997 a junio de 1998. Las sero-prevalencias fueron 56,5% (IC 95%, 50^63%) para VBI y 2,2% (IC 95%, 0,53 ,8%) para VEN. Todos los poblados tuvieron pollos positivos a anticuerpos contra VBI y 9 de 30 poblados tuvieron pollos positivos a anticuerpos contra VEN. Lo anterior sugiere que el VBI pudiera ser responsable de una alta proporcion de las enfermedades respiratorias observadas en pollos de traspatio en Yucatan, Mexico. Se discuten las implicaciones de estos hallazgos incluyendo la alta susceptibilidad de los pollos de traspatio en Yucatan al VEN y la posibilidad de que este virus sea una de las causas del sindrome conocido como`mortandad' por la gente local.",
