The amplification could be finished in 1 h under isothermal conditions at 63\u00b0C by employing a set of four primers targeting the 2C gene of DHAV-1. The RT-LAMP assay showed higher sensitivity than the RT-PCR with a detection limit of 0.1 ELD 50 0.1 ml -1 of DHAV-1. The RT-LAMP assay was highly specific; no cross-reactivity was observed from the samples of other related viruses, bacteria, allantoic fluid of normal chicken embryos, or the livers of uninfected ducks. Thirty clinical samples were subjected to detection by RT-LAMP, RT-PCR, and virus isolation, which obtained completely consistent, positive results. As a simple, rapid, and accurate detection method, this RT-LAMP assay has important potential applications in the clinical diagnosis of DHAV-1.",

Duck hepatitis leads to severe economic losses for duck raising farms. Duck hepatitis virus includes three serotypes DHV-1, DHV-2, and DHV-3. DHV-1 is distributed widely, while DHV-2 and DHV-3 have only been reported in the UK and the USA, respectively [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] . Duck hepatitis caused by DHV-1 can lead to mortality up to 95 % in young ducklings during the first week of life, thus accurate and efficient diagnosis is extremely useful to control the initial disease outbreak [1] . Recently, DHV-1 was renamed to DHAV, and DHAV has three genotypes (DHAV-1, 2 ,and 3) [8] [9] [10] [11] . DHAV-1 is distributed widely and prevalent in China, DHAV-2 have been only isolated in Taiwan until now [9, 10] , while DHAV-3 was first isolated in South Korea [11] , but now it is also epidemic in mainland of China.",

To address this, a virus antigen-based ELISA was first established in 1991 [13] , then a recombinant VP1 protein-based ELISA was developed, which showed agreement with the neutralization test [14] . Nucleic acid-based assays such as RT-PCR, real-time RT-PCR, and real-time quantitative PCR were developed and showed high specificity and sensitivity [1, 8, [15] [16] [17] . However, these assays need specialized and expensive equipment such as a thermal cycler or real-time PCR system, thus they are of limited application in rural areas.",

LAMP continues with the accumulation of 10 9 copies of target in less than an hour [18] . As a simple and efficient diagnostic technique, LAMP has been used in the detection of various RNA or DNA viruses, such as Avian leukosis virus [19, 20] , Barley yellow dwarf virus [21] , swine transmissible gastroenteritis coronavirus [22] , avian influenza virus [23] , and Foot-and-mouth disease virus [24] .

However, these assays require considerable operator skills, expensive equipment, and 2-4 h for amplification; thus, the application of these assays is limited in the field. Compared to traditional PCR technology, LAMP has more advantages. First, LAMP is more specific since it requires 4 or 6 primers to identify 6 or 8 specific domains [18, 19] , while PCR uses only two primers. Second, LAMP is more sensitive, for the amplification of LAMP is more efficient than PCR. Third, LAMP does not require expensive and complex equipment, instead it can be performed using a water bath or heat block for incubation under isothermal conditions. Finally, LAMP is time saving, the assay can be accomplished within 1 h, whereas the PCR technology typically requires 2-4 h [29] .",

After a comparison of different DHAV-1 subgroup genomes, the conserved domain 2C of the genome was selected as the domain for LAMP primer design and was used for screening a group of primers with good amplification efficiency. The 3D gene has also been used to design primers for detection of DHV-1 in the early reports, which encodes an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase [1, 17, 31] . Given that many viruses have RNA polymerase gene, we prefer to choose 2C gene as a detecting marker. A one-step RT-LAMP assay with high specificity and sensitivity was developed for rapid diagnosis of DHAV-1, which has no cross-reaction with DEV, MPV, AIV, R. anatipestifer (RA), S. enteritidis, and E. coli (O78), suggesting that this technique has high specificity to distinguish among some common avian viruses and bacteria at the nucleic acid level. The RT-LAMP has a detection limit of 0.1 ELD 50 per 100 ll, equivalent to 2 9 10 -1 pg DHAV-1 total RNA per reaction, which was 100 times more sensitive than the conventional RT-PCR, which suggested that this method is useful for the detection of low levels of DHAV-1 and is also useful for confirming the early stages of DHAV-1 infection when viral titers are relatively low.",
