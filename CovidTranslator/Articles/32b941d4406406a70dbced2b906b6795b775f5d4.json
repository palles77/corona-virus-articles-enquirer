These coronaviruses are associated with novel respiratory syndromes that spread from person-to-person via close contact, resulting in high morbidity and mortality caused by the progression to Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS). Areas covered: The risks of re-emergence of SARS-CoV from bat reservoir hosts, the persistence of MERS-CoV circulation, and the potential for future emergence of novel coronaviruses indicate antiviral drug discovery will require activity against multiple coronaviruses. In this review, approaches that antagonize viral nonstructural proteins, neutralize structural proteins, or modulate essential host elements of viral infection with varying levels of efficacy in models of highly pathogenic coronavirus disease are discussed. Expert opinion: Treatment of SARS and MERS in outbreak settings has focused on therapeutics with general antiviral activity and good safety profiles rather than efficacy data provided by cellular, rodent, or nonhuman primate models of highly pathogenic coronavirus infection. Based on lessons learned from SARS and MERS outbreaks, lack of drugs capable of pan-coronavirus antiviral activity increases the vulnerability of public health systems to a highly pathogenic coronavirus pandemic.",

SARS and MERS represent a new class of public health concern that may continue to emerge into human populations: respiratory syndromes caused by coronaviruses (CoVs) that are transmitted from person-to-person via close contact, resulting in high morbidity and mortality in infected individuals. Although SARS and MERS initially present as mild, influenza-like illnesses with fever, dyspnea, and cough, progression to more severe symptoms is characterized by an atypical interstitial pneumonia and diffuse alveolar damage. Both SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV are capable of causing acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), the most severe form of acute lung injury where alveolar inflammation, pneumonia, and hypoxic lung conditions lead to respiratory failure, multiple organ disease, and death in 50% of ARDS patients [4] . The total confirmed number of patients infected with highly pathogenic CoVs is relatively low (approximately 10,000 cases of both SARS and MERS since 2002), but CoVs are of particular concern due to high case fatality rates, lack of proven therapeutics, as well as the demonstrated ability of these pathogens to seed outbreaks that rapidly cross geographic and geopolitical borders into other countries and continents [5, 6] .",

Within the Coronaviridae family (order Nidovirales) four genera are recognized: alphacoronavirus, betacoronavirus, gammacoronavirus, and deltacoronavirus. The six HCoVs (Table 1) currently identified belong to the genera alphacoronavirus (HCoV-229E and HCoV-NL63) and betacoronavirus (SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, HCoV-OC43, and HCoV-HKU1). Gammacoronaviruses and deltacoronaviruses have no known viruses that infect humans, but contain important agricultural pathogens of livestock. Epizootic coronaviruses in animals cause a wide range of disease signs resulting from respiratory, enteric, and neurological tissue tropism. Although HCoVs cause primarily respiratory symptoms, the potential for a wide range of severe disease symptoms in humans caused by infection by future emergent coronaviruses cannot be excluded. Despite the severity and diversity of coronavirus disease signs and symptoms affecting a large number of important livestock species as well as humans, there are no proven therapies that specifically target CoVs.",

            "text": "In addition to CoVs known to cause disease in humans and livestock, a large number of highly diverse coronaviruses have been identified based on sequences collected from sampling bat species. Bat coronavirus (BatCoV) sequences recovered from sampling sites on different continents (Asia, Europe, Africa, North America) over the last decade contain putative BatCoVs from diverse branches of the betacoronavirus and alphacoronavirus phylogenetic tree [9] [10] [11] [12] . Importantly, the two coronaviruses that cause the most severe disease in humans, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, emerged from BatCoVs that were not previously recognized to infect humans or animals other than bats [12] [13] [14] . Recent studies suggest that BatCoV-SHC014 and BatCoV-WIV1 are genetically similar to SARS-CoV and enter cells using human receptors [10, 15, 16] . Similarly, BatCoV-HKU4 and BatCoV-HKU5 are MERS-like BatCoVs that may also be circulating in bat populations, and some MERS-like BatCoVs may also be able to recognize human host cell receptors [17] [18] [19] . Such BatCoVs are now called 'preemergent', because they may have the potential to emerge into human populations. Importantly, therapeutics that rely on host memory responses to target CoV infection are often not effective against pre-emergent BatCoVs that differ antigenically from known HCoVs, highlighting the need for pancoronavirus therapeutics that target conserved mechanisms utilized by HCoVs and BatCoVs [15] .",

            "text": "Research on coronavirus-specific antiviral drugs has focused primarily on highly pathogenic coronaviruses SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV due to the major potential consequences of pandemics resulting from these pathogens. SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV did not transmit as efficiently from person-to-person compared to other respiratory pathogens like seasonal influenza, but mortality in patients of SARS (approximately 10%) and MERS (approximately 35%) greatly exceeded typical seasonal influenza case-fatality rates (2.4 deaths per 100,000 cases) [24] . Air travel facilitated these CoVs in seeding outbreaks in regions distant from initial localized viral spread: SARS-CoV emerged in the Guangdong province of southeastern China in late 2002, and then spread rapidly to other parts of the world, with outbreaks in major cities including Beijing, Hong Kong, Singapore, and Toronto, resulting in one of the first pandemics of the twenty-first century [5] . Since MERS-CoV emerged in 2012, MERS cases have been exported from the Middle East to Europe, North America, Africa, and South East Asia, including a major outbreak of 186 people in the Republic of Korea in 2015 [25] . Superspreaders (individuals that transmit SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV to a large number of people) played an important role in initiating and perpetuating CoV outbreaks: the 2015 MERS-CoV outbreak in the Republic of Korea started from a single traveler case, and just five cases were responsible for more than 80% of the transmission events [25] . SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV were transmitted by close contact, with known outbreaks occurring in hotels, apartment buildings, and hospitals or health-care centers. Health-care workers, in particular, were at risk for infection by SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV at high rates [5, 26] . In addition, animal workers were more likely to come into contact with CoV infected animals, and a large percentage of MERS patients had contact with intermediate host camels [26, 27] . Analysis of severe SARS or MERS disease identified disproportionately high case-fatality rates in elderly patients (age > 65 years) and patients with pre-existing comorbidities including diabetes, heart disease, hypertension, and renal disease [4, 26, 28] . Based on these epidemiological considerations, pan-coronavirus therapeutics are needed to i) protect populations with occupational risk for transmission of CoVs, ii) protect populations with susceptibility to severe disease from CoVs, iii) work in concert with public health measures like quarantine and contact tracing, and iv) be rapidly deployable to geographically distant regions from local HCoV epidemics.",

            "text": "Advances in the study of highly pathogenic coronaviruses and potential pan-coronavirus drug candidates partially depend on the technology to genetically manipulate CoVs to probe mechanisms of viral pathogenesis and antiviral drug activity. Reverse genetics systems synthetically generate viruses from known viral sequences [29] . In situations where clinical isolates of infectious material are unavailable due to restriction for collecting patient samples, shipping infectious materials, or availability of containment laboratories, reverse genetics systems provide essential research materials for studies on viral pathogenesis and model development. Prior to the SARS pandemic, robust reverse genetics systems to manipulate the genomes of CoVs had already been developed by systematic assembly of cDNA cassettes into full-length infectious clones, allowing precise and targeted genetic manipulation of viral genes [30, 31] . Infectious clones allow the creation of near-homogenous viral stocks, whereas traditional viral stocks are prepared by amplification of infectious material in cell culture over many passages. Strategies to build reverse genetics systems were rapidly applied to both SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV within the first year of identification of these viruses [32, 33] . In addition to reconstructing epidemic strains of CoVs, reverse genetic systems allow targeting of mutations to specific viral genes and assembly of viruses when infectious civets and other small carnivore species located in wet animal markets. MERS-CoV has been identified in dromedary camels, and is particularly associated with active infection of juvenile camels. Novel emerging CoVs may occur in the future via infection from bat populations into other intermediate animal hosts. Additional evidence from BatCoVs indicates that pre-emergent CoVs with the ability to directly infect human cells may be poised for emergence into human populations. Based on prior research from SARS and MERS outbreaks, animal workers that have contact with intermediate animal host species and health-care workers that are exposed to nosocomial CoV infections are at increased risk of highly pathogenic coronavirus transmission. More severe disease in SARS and MERS cases resulted in patients that were over the age of 65 or had comorbidities such as obesity, heart disease, diabetes, renal disease, or hypertension. material is not available. As an example, the ability to isolate mutations in particular genes was applied to studies of the spike (S) glycoprotein of SARS-CoV, while maintaining the isogenic background of the viral replicase and other structural proteins. Mutations from zoonotic, early, middle, and late epidemic strains of the SARS-CoV outbreak were inserted into the S glycoprotein of the epidemic strain of SARS-CoV (Urbani) to determine the effect of evolution on viral entry into human cells as well as viral pathogenesis in rodent and primate models of disease [34] [35] [36] . By targeting mutations to a specific viral gene, reverse genetics systems allow researchers to probe cause-and-effect relationships of host pathogenic responses to viral genetic changes. In addition, reverse genetics techniques were utilized to study pre-emergent BatCoV strains: recombinant versions of BatCoV-HKU3, BatCoV-WIV1, and BatCoV-SHC014 (SARS-CoV-like), as well as BatCoV-HKU5 (MERS-CoV-like) viruses, were generated and used for in vitro and in vivo models of emerging coronavirus disease [15, 16, 37, 38] . Panels of zoonotic, epidemic, and pre-emergent viruses synthesized by reverse genetics techniques encompass a diverse array for use in high-throughput platforms for the discovery of countermeasures that are effective against the broadest range of CoVs without being reliant on procuring clinical isolates.",

            "text": "Like all other viruses, coronaviruses require host cell machinery to replicate their genomes, produce progeny virions, and cause disease. Cell lines require expression of the host cell receptor as well as expression of necessary proteases to facilitate viral entry, although additional host factors may also be important for infection. The S glycoprotein of coronaviruses, the main determinant of host cell attachment and viral entry, is not well conserved between HCoVs. Most human coronaviruses use different host cell receptors for viral entry, and may also require different host cell proteases that allow fusion of viral and cellular membranes ( Table 1 ) [39] . Although all known HCoVs have viral tropism targeted at the human respiratory tract, lung cell lines infected by a broad range of HCoVs have not been defined. A key feature of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV is that highly pathogenic coronaviruses grow to higher viral titer on a wider range of cell lines than the other mildly pathogenic coronaviruses HCoV-OC43, HCoV-229E, HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-HKU1 [40] [41] [42] [43] [44] . High throughput approaches to screen compound libraries for targeted activity against coronaviruses have been underdeveloped and limited in the number of viral strains used [45] [46] [47] [48] [49] [50] [51] [52] . Infection of panels of cell lines from various animal species with HCoVs and BatCoVs informs on the potential host range of the pathogen, and may help to identify susceptible mammalian host involved in viral spread. However, productive infection of cell lines does not always translate to recapitulation of pathogenesis in the same animal model that the cell lines are derived from, which may be due to receptor availability in live animals or other biological and immunological factors during infection.",

However, several limitations are associated with HAEs including difficulty in collection due to the scarcity of donors and difficulty in maintenance because of limited capacity for cell divisions. HAEs may be sourced from donors with a preexisting disease state, which could influence viral pathogenesis. In addition, because of the genetic variability of donors, HAEs cultures often differ in expression levels of genes crucial to infectivity, including the various host receptors for HCoVs, which leads to high variability in the infectivity of these cultures. Importantly, these in vitro methods fail to capture more complex viral interactions that occur with an intact immune system including infiltration of proinflammatory cells that may promote and contribute to ARDS in the most severe forms of SARS and MERS. Organ-on-a-chip models in development may provide the next generation of in vitro models that could capture these critical interactions between respiratory cells and immune cells, but infection of these novel culture systems has not been reported with coronaviruses [57] .",

Reproducible models of highly pathogenic coronavirus infection in common laboratory animal species have utility not only in development and testing of pan-coronavirus drugs, but also in elucidating mechanisms of viral replication or disease pathogenesis. Desirable qualities for animal models of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV include recapitulation of severe disease symptoms seen in SARS and MERS patients, and lethality caused by fulminant viral infection of the lung as indicated by high viral titers, inflammatory infiltrates, and aberrant cell signaling programs. Although therapeutic efficacy against viral transmission is essential to disrupting SARS or MERS outbreaks, current animal model development has focused on disease resulting from relevant infection routes (i.e. intranasal) over directly developing models of CoVs transmission.",

            "text": "Human Clinical Disease SARS manifests in humans as a severe atypical pneumonia associated with diffuse alveolar damage. SARS-CoV incubation period is 2-10 days. Initial flu-like symptoms of fever, cough, and shortness of breath may progress to pneumonia, and in severe cases infection may lead to Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS), the most severe form of acute lung injury. Pathological findings include the deposition of alveolar exudates and formation of hyalin membranes in severe cases. Overall mortality rate for SARS-CoV in reported cases was approximately 10%, with more severe disease in patients over age 65 disease signs, and virus was rapidly cleared from the lung in these models [60] . Serial passage of SARS-CoV in the lungs of mice by multiple research groups resulted in mouse-adapted SARS-CoV strains that caused lethal lung disease in wild-type mouse intranasal (IN) infection models [64, 65] . Mouse-adapted SARS-CoV MA15 is the best characterized small animal model of CoV infection, and has been used to test several pancoronavirus drug candidates [66, 67] . The benefit of mouseadapted models of SARS-CoV in wild-type inbred mouse strains includes reproducible susceptibility to disease assayed by survival, weight loss, and whole body plethysmography of individual mice as well as quantification of infiltrating cells, viral titers, histopathology, and transcriptomics and proteomics changes in target organs. To evaluate pathogenesis of emergent viruses in vivo, zoonotic SARS-CoV and preemergent BatCoV mutations have been incorporated into the SARS-CoV MA15 backbone, providing novel animal models for viruses that have the potential to emerge into humans [15, 35] . Additional valuable avenues of research on variables known to impact severe CoV disease in the MA15 models of SARS-CoV include age, dose, and host genetic contributions to disease phenotypes [68, 69] . The greatest limitations of SARS-CoV mouse-adapted models for drug discovery are the incorporation of mutations in the SARS-CoV genome (particularly for testing antiviral drugs that target viral genes with mutations) and acknowledged differences between mouse and human immune responses. Unlike SARS-CoV, human clinical strains of MERS-CoV (Table 3 ) did not replicate in mice, hamsters, or ferrets, and further studies of the host receptor identified critical amino acid residue differences between the MERS-CoV receptor, DPP4, in laboratory animal model species that prevented entry into cells compared to human DPP4 [70] [71] [72] . MERS-CoV infection of rabbits resulted in viral replication in the upper respiratory tract, but no clinical disease signs that reflect more severe MERS-CoV disease symptoms were reported, although the model has been used for limited testing of MERS-CoV antiviral therapeutics [73, 74] . However, due to the utility of the mouse-adapted SARS-CoV model, a mouse model continued to be pursued, and adenovirus-vectored transient expression of the human DPP4 receptor in mice and subsequent replication of MERS-CoV in these mice determined that MERS-CoV replication was dependent on human DPP4 expression in rodents [75] . Transgenic expression of human DPP4 in mice allowed MERS-CoV replication in mice, but resulted in lethal brain disease not representative of MERS-CoV infection in humans [76, 77] . Replacing mouse DPP4 with the expression of human DPP4 in mice resulted in a humanized DPP4 mouse model that allows MERS-CoV replication within the lung and some MERS-associated lung pathology, but no lethal disease [78] . Similarly, knock-in expression of the human DPP4 exons 10-12 in mice allowed viral replication but no overt MERS disease signs [79] . Serial passage of MERS-CoV in the lungs of these mice resulted in a MERS-MA virus that caused lethal disease in mice, including weight loss and severe lung pathology [79] . Identification of amino acids in mouse DPP4 that prevent entry of MERS-CoV into mouse cells led to the rational design of the mouse DPP4 gene edited by CRISPR/Cas9 to express two human DPP4 mutations (288/330 DPP4) [80] . 288/330 DPP4 mice supported viral replication without severe disease or lethality, but serial passage of MERS-CoV (generating a mouse-adapted virus called MERS-15) produced lethal disease in the 288/330 DPP4 mice [80] . Although many of the same metrics of disease to MA15-SARS-CoV are available in the MERS-15 or MERS-MA models for drug discovery of coronavirus antivirals, an additional drawback is the requirement for both mouse-adapted virus and a modified rodent host. Despite these limitations, mouse models of adapted SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV are currently the bestdeveloped models of highly pathogenic coronavirus infection available for pan-coronavirus drug discovery.",

Infecting NHPs by multiple routes likely caused a systemic infection potentially not representative of human MERS-CoV infection. Although the marmoset is currently the best developed NHP model of MERS-CoV disease, discrepancies in disease severity of marmosets infected by multiple routes and marmosets infected by the IT route illuminate potential difficulties with using this model for drug development studies. Small size and fragility of marmosets precluded serial blood draws on multiple days following infection, and may confound experimental outcomes resulting from MERS-CoV infection or treatment [92] .

Inhibiting highly conserved mechanisms involved in the coronavirus lifecycle is likely to result in a reduction of viral titers, alteration of host responses, and/or amelioration of disease signs. SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV are known threats to global health, but other novel coronaviruses may emerge in the future complicating drug design if antiviral targets are too specific to known viral strains. Unlike with influenza viruses, specific antiviral drugs like oseltamivir and zanamivir targeting coronaviruses are not yet available, but several promising candidates have been recently described in the literature. The most conserved proteins among CoVs are nonstructural proteins (nsps) involved in essential functions of the viral lifecycle. The structural proteins that make up the virion are less conserved than nsps, and accessory proteins are only functionally conserved among very closely related viruses ( Figure 2 ). In addition to potential lack of conservation between known and emerging HCoVs, targeting viral proteins can be problematic for drug discovery due to viral escape by mutation. Alternatively, antivirals that target conserved host factors utilized during the viral life cycle may also be potential pan-coronavirus antiviral therapeutics, but have the disadvantage of potential off-target effects.",

Efficacy of GS-5734 in post-exposure treatment of Ebola virusinfected nonhuman primates led to GS-5734 inclusion in an experimental therapy for an infant survivor of Ebola virus disease [45, 95] . These encouraging results demonstrated that GS-5734 may be an acceptable therapeutic intervention to lethal viral disease, even days after viral exposure, and tolerated by patients with viral diseases that were previously treated primarily with supportive care. Based on activity against MERS-CoV within a larger panel targeting lethal viruses from multiple viral families, additional studies demonstrated that GS-5734 decreased viral titers and viral RNA in in vitro models of both SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV infection of HAEs [66] . Additionally, GS-5734 had similar effects against other diverse CoVs including HCoV-NL63 and Mouse Hepatitis Virus (MHV, betacoronavirus group 2a) [66, 96] . Importantly, GS-5734 inhibited replication of pre-emergent BatCoVs including BatCoV-HKU5, BatCoV-HKU3, BatCoV-SHC014, and BatCoV-WIV1 [66] . Activity in vivo against CoVs was supported by ameliorated disease signs (weight loss, lung viral titers) in MA15 SARS-CoV infected mice treated prophylactically or therapeutically with GS-5734 [66] . Although viral resistance to GS-5734 was shown experimentally in vitro, mutations to conserved motifs in SARS-CoV and MHV resulted in decreased viral fitness in vitro and in vivo [96] . Altogether, in vitro and in vivo data support GS-5734 development as a potential pan-coronavirus antiviral based on results against several CoVs, including highly pathogenic CoVs and potentially emergent BatCoVs.",

Oral treatment with lopinavir-ritonavir in the marmoset model of MERS-CoV infection resulted in modest improvements in MERS disease signs, including decreased pulmonary infiltrates identified by chest x-ray, decreased interstitial pneumonia, and decreased weight loss [92] . MERS patient case reports of treatment regimens including lopinavir-ritonavir were associated with positive disease outcomes including defervescence, viral clearance from serum and sputum, and survival [99, 100] . Based on in vitro and in vivo activity against MERS-CoV, a clinical trial has been designed using combination of lopinavir-ritonavir and IFN-\u03b21b therapies in hospitalized MERS patients in Saudi Arabia [101] .",

Recently, it was demonstrated that excision of ribavirin nucleoside analogs by conserved coronavirus proofreading mechanisms likely accounted for decreased in vitro efficacy of ribavirin than expected [105] . Additional in vivo testing of ribavirin in mouse models found limited activity against MA15 SARS-CoV by ribavirin alone, and suggested that ribavirin treatment enhanced SARS disease signs [65, 106] . However, combination treatment of ribavirin and type I Interferons in primate models improved MERS disease signs [107] .

These proteins also perform important functions in the viral life cycle: S is the main determinant of cell tropism, host range, and viral entry; E facilitates viral assembly and release, and has viroporin activity; M maintains the membrane structure of the virion; and N encapsidates the viral RNA genome. Although most of these functions are essential to viral infection, CoVs tolerated E deletion and remained replication competent, but viral fitness was impaired [110] . Unfortunately, while structural protein functions are similar between CoVs, protein identity is less conserved than with nsps, making the development of pan-coronavirus therapeutics directly targeting structural proteins problematic. Genes encoding structural and accessory proteins are interspersed at the 3\u02b9 end of the coronavirus RNA genome (Figure 2 ). Deletion of accessory protein genes using reverse genetics systems demonstrated that these proteins were not essential for viral replication, but impacted viral replication or viral fitness in vitro and in vivo [111, 112] . However, unlike nonstructural proteins or structural proteins, significant variation in number, function, and sequence of accessory proteins between closely related viruses makes accessory proteins poor targets for pan-coronavirus therapeutic approaches.",

Several groups have attempted to inhibit host proteases (including furin, cathepsins, and TMPRSS2) that process viral S glycoproteins at the cell surface during viral entry [50, [120] [121] [122] . However, due to variation in viral S glycoproteins among different CoVs and variation in the host proteases required for viral entry ( Table 1) , combinations of protease inhibitors would be required for pan-coronavirus treatment regimens, particularly for emergent novel CoVs where host protease requirements have not been evaluated. Additional host targets with less established mechanisms of activity include Cyclosporins, a class of cyclophilin inhibitors with antiviral activity against coronaviruses in addition to immunosuppressive properties [123] . Non-immunosuppressive derivatives of cyclosporins like alisporivir retained antiviral properties in vitro against coronaviruses including SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, but were not effective against SARS-CoV in mouse models of infection [124] .",

            "text": "Interferons (IFNs) are a class of immunomodulatory compounds produced by host cells in response to detection of pathogen-specific motifs, resulting in IFN secretion that affects not only the stimulated cell, but also neighboring cells. Early in infection, IFN stimulation results in altered cellular transcriptional programs, leading to an antiviral state characterized by the activation of a large set of host genes with partially defined antiviral functions [125] . Based on these potentially beneficial immunomodulatory properties in the context of infections, IFNs have been used for the treatment of emerging viral infections where no specific antiviral drugs yet exist, with the greatest benefits resulting from administration very early following infection. For SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, Type I IFNs were effective at decreasing viral replication in vitro and showed additional benefits in in vivo primate models of infection [103, 104, 107, 126, 127] . IFNs used in the treatment of SARS and MERS patients often occurred in combinatory therapies with other drugs including ribavirin and lopinavir-ritonavir, although potential beneficial effects of therapies were limited, potentially due to administration at later times postinfection [108] . Upstream stimulants of IFN induction, including polyI:C resulted in IFN signaling cascade activation, with demonstrated effectivity in vitro and in vivo against SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV [67, 75] . Additional immunomodulatory compounds that regulate the expression of innate immune genes have been suggested as potential therapeutics for highly pathogenic coronaviruses; however, compounds that modulate the host response require significant testing in the most rigorous animal models before therapeutic applications could be pursued. For example, corticosteroids (methylprednisolone) were given as treatment during the SARS and MERS epidemics due to immunomodulatory effects that suppress inflammatory responses with no perceived benefit and possible deleterious effects [108, 109] .",

MERS-CoV continues to circulate on the Arabian Peninsula, providing the opportunity to investigate some treatments of MERS in clinical trials.

INDs must fulfill the Animal Efficacy Rule criteria of i) reasonable safety for initial use in humans, ii) pharmacological data that support reasonably well-understood mechanism of activity against the pathogen, and iii) efficacy in animal models with disease signs representative of clinical illness in humans (including one nonrodent model). While the vigorous pursuit of small animal models has been successful in generating rodent models that recapitulate severe SARS and MERS disease signs (including morbidity and mortality), progress in generating additional animal models has lagged, particularly in primate models of SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV infection. Past strategies for experimental treatment regimens primarily relied on combination therapies with approved drugs known to have acceptable safety profiles and broad-spectrum antiviral activity including IFNs, ribavirin, and corticosteroids. However, analyses of data returned from these treatments indicated that most regimens were not effective in treating SARS and MERS patients.

Virions exist as enveloped viral particles, with the Spike (S), Membrane (M), and Envelope (E) proteins decorating the outside of the membrane. Coronaviruses in genogroup 2a have an additional structural protein hemagglutinin esterase (HE), which has been omitted from this discussion. Inside of the virion, the Nucleocapsid (N) protein encapsidates the viral genome. The viral genome is composed of + sense, single-stranded RNA. At the 5\u02b9 end of the genome, a single polyprotein open reading frame encodes the more highly conserved nonstructural proteins(ORF1a, ORF1b). At the 3\u02b9 end of the genome, the functionally conserved structural proteins that make up the virion are interspersed with virus-specific accessory proteins (ORF3, ORF4a, ORF4b, ORF5, and ORF 8b). Accessory proteins are conserved between very closely related viruses like BatCoV-HKU4, BatCoV-HKU5, and MERS-CoV. There is no conservation of accessory proteins between known HCoVs.",
