More than 2400 viral species are known, with extraordinarily diverse morphologies and biochemical compositions [1, 2] . Their diameters range from 20 to 500 nm, and their genomes from 3000 to 375 000 nucleotides. They have single-or double-stranded RNA or DNA genomes packaged into icosahedral or helical protein shells, which are sometimes wrapped in a lipid envelope. The particle protects the viral genome, carries it from cell to cell in the infected host organism and transmits it from infected to uninfected hosts. Once delivered into a susceptible target cell, the viral genome usurps the cellular biosynthetic machinery to manufacture progeny viruses that spread to adjacent cells, leading to a characteristic pattern of tissue destruction. This provokes innate and adaptive immune responses (cellular and humoral), which combat the infection and protect the host from future exposures to the same virus. From one pharmacological perspective, the viral genome can be seen as a new class of tissuedestructive drug, and the viral particle as a nanosized nucleic acid delivery vehicle.",

However, for viruses to be more widely approved and used as anticancer drugs, they will have to meet stringent criteria for safety and efficacy, and should be amenable to pharmacological study in human subjects.

The E1a and E1b gene products prevent apoptosis and cell-cycle arrest in the infected cells by inhibiting p53 and Rb, respectively. Normal cells undergo rapid Rb-induced cell-cycle arrest and p53-induced apoptosis when infected by an oncolytic adenovirus lacking E1 functions, and the propagation of the virus is, thereby, aborted. However, in tumor cells in which the p53 and Rb proteins are frequently nonfunctional, the E1-deleted adenovirus can still propagate efficiently without fear of triggering premature apoptosis [12, 13] .",

            "text": "This targeting strategy provides a way to exploit defects in interferon signaling pathways in tumor cells. Virus infections tend to provoke the induction of type I interferons but successful viruses suppress this response (Box 1). When viruses are mutated to destroy their interferon suppression mechanisms, the release of interferon from the infected cell signals to neighboring cells to shut down protein synthesis, leading to the establishment of an antiviral state. In contrast to normal cells, tumor cells have defective interferon signaling pathways and, therefore, remain susceptible to the virus, even after exposure to interferon. Vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) infection provokes transcription of interferon genes but the virally encoded matrix (M) protein, by inhibiting mRNA transport, blocks the synthesis and release of active interferons. VSVs can, therefore, be rendered nonpathogenic by mutating the M protein so that it no longer inhibits interferon release [14] or by inserting an interferon gene into the VSV genome [15] . These nonpathogenic VSVs are still oncolytic because tumor cells are defective in their ability to produce and respond to interferon and, therefore, efficiently support the propagation of the defective viruses [16] . A second translational targeting approach, employed recently and with good effect to develop an oncolytic poliovirus, is to restrict the expression of viral genes by placing them under the control of a tissue-specific internal ribosome entry site [17] . Box 1. Virus replication Attachment is the first step in the virus life cycle ( Figure I ). Attachment proteins on the surface of the virion interact with specific receptors on the surface of the target cell. Attachment provides the trigger for entry, wherein the viral genome is delivered into the cytoplasm of the target cell. Entry occurs by membrane fusion for enveloped viruses and by endosomal disruption or particle translocation across the target cell membrane for non-enveloped viruses. Once inside the infected cell, viral genomes are transported to specific nuclear or cytoplasmic destinations where they can be expressed and replicated. The viral genome is then copied and amplified, the viral genes are expressed and the structural proteins are assembled to form new virus particles, which interact with the packaging signal sequences in the progeny viral genomes to form fully infectious, nucleic-acid-carrying progeny virus particles that are released from the cell. Viral genes encoding nonstructural and structural proteins are typically expressed sequentially. The nonstructural proteins, which are expressed earliest, have several functions. They drive the amplification of the viral genome, induce the expression of the structural (late) proteins and maintain the viability of the target cell long enough so that it can make viable progeny viruses.",

The second response of the infected cell is to activate its apoptotic program so that it will die before it releases progeny viruses.

            "text": "Viruses evolve by mutation and selection [23] . Viral mutation rates are generally relatively high (higher for RNA viruses than for DNA viruses) such that many, if not most, viruses in a 'pure' virus preparation carry a point mutation somewhere in their genome. A virotherapy product cannot, therefore, be so precisely defined as a small molecule because it is actually a swarm of quasispecies that are closely related, but not identical, to a consensus product [24] . Under selective pressure in the treated cancer patient, these viruses or their in vivo progeny might acquire the ability to infect non-target tissues, to evade the host immune response or to spread from the patient to their carers. These risks are likely to vary greatly depending on the biology and prevalence of the oncolytic virus in question. The risk of oncolytic virus transmission from a treated patient to their carer is expected to be higher when the virus is derived from an animal pathogen than when it is derived from a human vaccine. Oncolytic measles viruses are considered extremely safe in this regard. The measles virus was originally isolated in 1954 from the throat swab of a measles-infected patient (David Edmonston) and was attenuated by extensive tissue culture passage [25] . Most of the live attenuated measles vaccines in current use were derived from this Edmonston lineage, as were the oncolytic strains of measles virus that are currently under investigation. Because of the successful global deployment of the measles vaccine, most humans are immune to measles [26] . Hence, even if an oncolytic measles virus were to evolve new pathogenic potential, transmission from patient to (measles-immune) carer would be highly unlikely. The scenario of an oncolytic measles virus evolving to become a pathogen is highly unlikely because reversion to pathogenicity of the closely related Edmonston-derived measles vaccine has not been documented in more than a billion vaccinees, the vaccine strain is not shed in saliva or urine, and person-to-person vaccine transmission has not been convincingly documented [27] . Finally, in contrast to other viruses such as influenza, measles is monotypic and has an extremely slow rate of evolution. This explains how anti-measles immunity acquired by vaccination with the Edmonston vaccine strain, originally isolated in 1954 [25] , is still strongly protective against all currently circulating measles strains, more than 50 years later.",

Intravenously administered viruses are, therefore, eliminated rapidly from the circulation, and this process becomes faster after each subsequent exposure because of increasing antiviral immunity. So formidable are the barriers to efficient and accurate vascular delivery of viruses that skepticism has been expressed as to whether these agents will ever be exploitable as systemic therapies.

However, reductions in the concentration of neutralizing antibodies after terminating their production are very slow because the serum half-life of antiviral IgG is longer than 20 days [35, 36] .

Vascular permeability can be increased by local expression of vascular permeability factors such as vascular endothelial growth factor or by local inflammation secondary to treatment with external beam radiation or chemotherapy [46] . An alternative strategy for enhancing viral extravasation from tumor blood vessels is to engineer their attachment proteins to bind to receptors expressed on tumor blood vessel endothelium [47, 48] .

Key pharmacokinetic questions, usually left unanswered in Phase I virotherapy trials, are: (i) where do the virus particles go and how many reach the target site? (ii) How many target cells get infected, where are they located and what is their identity? (iii) Is the viral genome expressed in the infected cells and, if so, at what level and for how long? (iv) How many progeny viruses are released by infected cells, when are they released and where do they go? (v) How fast and how far does the virus spread and when is it eliminated from the body? Answers to these important questions are routinely obtained in preclinical studies by direct analysis of tissue samples harvested from multiple sites at multiple time-points but such analyses are not feasible in human trials. To study the pharmacokinetics of oncolytic viruses in a clinical setting, we need convenient, noninvasive monitoring strategies that can be used to quantify the expression level of virusencoded proteins and to map the distribution of virus-infected cells. Repeat testing should be undertaken in each treated patient to track the spread of the virus and to determine the time course of viral gene expression. Marker genes can be incorporated into the viral genome to facilitate this type of clinical monitoring.",

            "text": "After a long incubation period, oncolytic viruses are finally emerging as potentially useful anticancer drugs. Data currently emerging from ongoing Phase I and Phase II clinical trials are extremely encouraging, showing that tumor regressions can occur even after systemic virus delivery [67] . However, significant challenges remain. In particular, the clinical potency of oncolytic viruses must be increased if they are to become a truly effective cancer therapy, and it seems likely that their clinical potential will be fully realized only when they can be safely administered to patients receiving concurrent immunosuppressive therapy. To ensure their safe deployment in the setting of antibody depletion and transient immunosuppression, it is anticipated that future oncolytic viruses will have to be not only more potent but also more tumor specific than those currently tested, and amenable to noninvasive pharmacological monitoring. Mechanisms of tumor targeting by oncolytic viruses. (a) Transcriptional targeting. An essential viral gene is placed under the control of a tumor-specific promoter (some virus promoters are naturally tumor specific). Typically, the selected gene encodes an early viral protein that is essential for successful completion of the virus life cycle. This is applicable only to DNA viruses (excluding poxviruses) and retroviruses. (b) Translational targeting. The virus is engineered (or adapted) to disable viral proteins that antagonize the cellular interferon (IFN) response. Normal cells then release interferon upon infection, causing neighboring cells to shut-off translation. Infected cancer cells are impaired in their ability to release or respond normally to interferon. (c) Pro-apoptotic targeting. The virus is engineered (or adapted) to disable viral proteins that prevent apoptosis. Normal cells then die quickly upon infection before progeny viruses can be produced. Infected cancer cells are impaired in their ability to undergo apoptosis. Hence, the virus can generate progeny and spread only in the cancer cells. (d) Transductional targeting. The virus gains entry to its target cells through a receptor expressed more abundantly on tumor cells than on normal cells. The natural receptors for several viruses fall into this category. Alternatively, the attachment specificity of the virus can be reprogrammed towards tumor antigens by the display of single-chain antibodies or other polypeptide-binding ligands on the viral surface.
