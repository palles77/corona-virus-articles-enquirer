Purpose To investigate the level of knowledge and attitudes towards the influenza A(H1N1) outbreak across various ethnic groups and socio-demographic backgrounds in Malaysia. Method A cross-sectional, population-based, computerassisted telephone interview exploring knowledge and attitudes regarding influenza A(H1N1) was conducted in Malaysia. Between July 11 and September 12, 2009, a total of 1,050 respondents were interviewed (response rate 69.3%). Results The mean total knowledge score for the overall sample was 7.30 (SD\u00b11.961) out of a possible score of 13 (Chinese had the highest scores, followed by Indians, then Malays). Some erroneous beliefs about the modes of transmission were identified. The majority of the participants (73.8%) perceived the A(H1N1) infection as often deadly. Despite the overestimation of the severity of A (H1N1) infection, high confidence in preventing infection and low perceived susceptibility of infection were reported. Influenza A(H1N1)-related stigma was prevalent and exhibited differences across ethnic groups.",

Malaysia confirmed its first case of influenza A(H1N1) on May 15, 2009 . In response to increasing local transmission, Malaysia moved from containment to mitigation stage on July 9, 2009 [1] . Since then, the A(H1N1) pandemic has grown exponentially. On July 23, 2009 , approximately 2 weeks after the commencement of this study, the first death from influenza A(H1N1) was reported. On September 13, 2009 , the date on which our data collection finished, the total fatality count was 74 [2] .",

Non-response and irrelevant (non-applicable) responses (for example, questions regarding pork and pork products to Muslim respondents) were treated as missing values and, therefore, excluded from the analyses. T tests and one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) were used for comparisons of means; the chi-squared test was used to test the significance of differences in percentages. Post hoc comparisons using the Tukey's HSD test were conducted to evaluate pairwise differences among the means. Multiple linear regression analysis using the enter method was carried out to explore relationships between knowledge scores and socio-demographic variables that had a P value less than 0.10 in bivariate comparisons. Multivariate logistic regression analyses were used to determine factors associated with perceived susceptibility to A(H1N1), and perceived confidence in A(H1N1) prevention. A backward stepwise logistic regression selection method was carried out to select significant independent variables and make adjustments for covariates among variables. Wald chisquared statistics were used to test the significance of individual coefficients in the model. Goodness of fit was assessed with the Hosmer-Lemeshow test. Statistical significance was set to P<0.05. Figure 1 provides the flowchart of the CATI process. A total of 6,230 call attempts were made, resulting in 1,050 (16.9%) responding households. The low response rate was due to the large number of uncontactable households. However, of the total successful calls (1,750), 60.0% (n= 1,050) completed the interview. By ethnic group, the proportions that completed interview upon successful calls were 64.8% (436/673), 52.3% (352/673), and 64.8% (262/ 404) for Malay, Chinese, and Indian samples, respectively. Table 1 shows socio-demographic characteristics of the 1,050 respondents in the survey.

Compared to a recent Hong Kong study [14] , more respondents in Malaysia thought that A(H1N1) could be transmitted by eating pork products (31.3%, vs. 6.9%), more did not know that the A(H1N1) virus is transmittable via droplets (8.7%, vs. 2.0%), while fewer did not know that the A(H1N1) virus is transmittable via contact with contaminated objects (16.8% vs. 21.1%). Results of the multiple linear regression analysis using total knowledge score as the dependent variable indicated that provision of information and education should focus on the male gender, Malay ethnic group, people of lower education and income, and those living in rural areas. Participants who were female, Malay, employed, of high socio-economic status, and living in urban areas appeared to be more likely to overestimate the severity of A(H1N1) as they believed the A(H1N1) infection as often deadly. An overestimation of the severity of A(H1N1) should be prevented as it may cause unnecessary panic and distress to the community and may lead to interference of a wide range of daily activities. Thus, these specific groups of people may require targeted education [8, 10] . Despite the overestimation of the severity of A(H1N1), a high proportion of the participants in this study reported low perceived susceptibility to A(H1N1) infection, which did not change significantly over the study period, despite the increasing number of deaths. Because perceived susceptibility is expected to begin the process of adoption of preventive behaviors, health authorities and media should stress to the public to continuously adopt precautionary measures to prevent infection even if the number of reported deaths decreases.",

This is of particular concern because an individual may not engage in preventive behavior because of lack of perceived susceptibility to the disease [18] . Of interest, this confidence declined and remained lower even after the number of reported deaths peaked. It has been shown that perceived vulnerability for SARS was significantly associated with perceived threat [19] . Additionally, perceptions of risk and severity were found to influence public's behavioral responses to pandemic influenza [9, 20] More research is needed to investigate why the Malaysian public overestimates the severity of this new disease and yet under-perceives its risk of infection, to provide insight into how the health authorities or media should disseminate information to counteract these misconceptions in the future. The findings of our multivariate logistic regression analyses indicated that education to enhance perceived susceptibility to A(H1N1) infection should focus on people of older age and people living in suburban areas. Influenza A(H1N1) related stigma was prevalent and exhibited differences across ethnic groups. Finding of significant ethnic disparities in A(H1N1)-related stigma suggest further in-depth qualitative exploration on cultural values and beliefs related to each ethnic group. In this study, we also found that perceived severity of A(H1N1) infection was not associated with stigma. Despite widespread information about the control measures in response to the emergence of pandemic influenza A(H1N1), in particular, near one third of the study participants (including a majority of those that believed A(H1N1) infection is often deadly) did not fear being in contact with people with influenza symptoms, and approximately 50% were not afraid to be in contact with people who had just returned from overseas. Although health authorities have repeatedly emphasized that the A(H1N1) virus is not transmitted by food, a substantial minority avoided eating pork-related products for fear of infection.",

Moderate fear has been shown as most effective at motivating health-protective behaviors.
