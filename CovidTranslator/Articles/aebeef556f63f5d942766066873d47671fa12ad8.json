Even during early phases of infection, when the level of antibodies induced by ACTIVE IMMUNIZATION or administered by PASSIVE IMMUNIZATION is low, antibodies can reduce the size of the infecting inoculum and neutralize or eliminate virions during the first rounds of replication. This provides sufficient transient protection so that the cellular arm of the immune response can respond with proliferation and deployment of effector T cells that are required to eliminate virus-infected cells. Data indicate that this model is applicable to infection with HIV-1, simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) and the chimeric simian/human immunodeficiency virus (SHIV) [3] [4] [5] .",

            "text": "Despite extensive data supporting the general importance of antibodies in preventing virus infections (FIG. 1) , perceptions about the role of antibodies in preventing infection with HIV-1 have varied markedly over the past 20 years. Opinions have ranged from the wildly optimistic views held in the late 1980s that antibodies would be sufficient to protect against infection, to the bleakest predictions of the mid-1990s that primary isolates were resistant to antibodymediated neutralization and that no vaccine would ever be able to induce antibodies that are sufficiently broad and potent to provide protection. Many passive immunization experiments in various experimental models have, however, repeatedly established that antibodies can provide sterilizing immunity against HIV-1 (REFS 6-9). In addition, passive immunization experiments indicate that antibodies reduce the size of the infectious inoculum and allow the development of more effective cellular and humoral immune responses to the breakthrough virus 3 . These studies provide convincing data in all of the experimental models tested that neutralizing antibodies with appropriate specificity -when present in sufficient concentrations -are a correlate of immune protection. Even in humans, some studies indicate that antibodies transferred across the placenta might protect against transmission of HIV-1 from infected pregnant women to their infants 10, 11 , although more studies of this controversial issue in humans are required.",

At present, the consensus seems to be that induction of both humoral and cellular immunity by an HIV-1 vaccine will be required to achieve maximum protection. One obstacle to the development of an effective HIV-1 vaccine has been the difficulty in inducing broadly reactive, potent antibodies with protective functions. Defining epitopes and designing immunogens that will induce these antibodies is one of the main challenges that now confronts the HIV-1 vaccine field.",

            "text": "Given the 'rediscovered' importance of antibodies in the prevention of HIV-1 infection 25 , it is necessary to reexamine the question of which antibodies should be induced and how this might be achieved. As the most consistent correlate of immune protection against viral is a generic term for the ability of antibodies to reduce the infectivity of a virus particle by interfering at one of several different steps in the virus life cycle. For example, antibodies can bind to molecules on the surface of virions and prevent their interaction with cellsurface lectins and with various receptors 12, 13 . In the case of HIV-1, this type of inhibition is attributed to carbohydrate-specific antibodies that target the virus glycoproteins 14, 15 , to antibodies that target different adhesion molecules 16 , and to antibodies that are specific for various regions of gp120 such as the CD4-binding domain, the 'CD4-induced (CD4i) epitope' (located in the bridging sheet of gp120 that is created or exposed when gp120 interacts with CD4) 17 , and the V2 and V3 loops (see FIG. 2 and BOX 1) . In addition, many 'post-attachment' mechanisms have been documented. An example of this is provided by antibodies that prevent the fusion of virus and cell membranes. In the case of HIV-1, the human monoclonal antibody 2F5 (described later) might be such an antibody, preventing either the formation of the gp41 coiledcoil form or the fusion of virus and the cell membrane [18] [19] [20] [21] . Antibodies can also mediate postfusion neutralization of many viruses (although this ",

Studies of polyclonal sera have helped to identify the specificities of antibodies that are associated with protection 28, 29 , but it is the study of human monoclonal antibodies that has most clearly defined the few epitopes that are located in the two envelope glycoproteins, gp120 and gp41, that induce neutralizing antibodies in natural infection (TABLE 1) and mediate protection against infection in passive immunization studies. Induction of antibodies to each of these epitopes might ultimately be useful as a defensive shield against HIV-1 infection; however, each of these epitopes presents challenges to vaccine design. Figure 2 | Diagram of the structure of the HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein gp120. The gp120 molecule with the location of the variable regions marked in boxes (V1-V5). The glycosylation sites containing high mannose-type and/or hybrid-type oligosaccharide structures are indicated by the branched structures, and glycosylation sites containing complex-type oligosaccharide structures are indicated by the U-shaped branches. Epitopes in gp120 that induce neutralizing antibodies are highlighted in colour. These include the highly conformational CD4-binding domain (key epitopes highlighted in yellow), the CD4-induced epitope (green), an epitope composed of \u03b11\u21922 mannose residues (purple), the V2 loop (orange) and the V3 loop (blue).

An exception is the human monoclonal antibody IgG1b12, which was constructed using recombinant technology from the bone marrow of an HIV-1-infected donor 49 . This monoclonal antibody has exceptionally broad activity against primary isolates, thereby confirming the crucial role of the CD4bd in HIV-1 infection 32, 50 .

Although studies of polyclonal antibodies specific for the V2 region show potent antiviral neutralizing activity 66, 67, 72 , broad neutralizing activity against primary viruses is not a general property of V2-specific antibodies, as shown by the inability of several rodent and human V2-specific monoclonal antibodies (such as monoclonal antibody 697-D) to neutralize panels of T-cell-line-adapted and primary isolates 73 (M. K. Gorny, unpublished observations). This seems to be due to the fact that the V2 region varies not only in sequence but also in length, due to insertions and deletions that alter or eliminate conserved elements to which broadly neutralizing antibodies could be targeted. Given that viruses lacking the V1/V2 region or the V2 variable loop are capable of replication 74, 75 , this region cannot be essential for infectivity and therefore is relatively unconstrained in terms of mutation. Therefore, despite the fact that this region of the virus envelope carries out important functions -mediating gp41-independent interaction within the gp120 trimer 76 and shielding the region in and around the bridging sheet of gp120 responsible for interaction with chemokine receptors 74,75,77-79 -the V1/V2 loop is an improbable target for vaccines and, in fact, is specifically being deleted in some vaccine constructs to provide better access to neutralizing epitopes in and near the co-receptor binding site 80 .",

Several such human monoclonal antibodies have been identified 53, 57, 58 , showing that the relevant epitope(s) are immunogenic at least in a subset of infected individuals. One monoclonal antibody specific for the CD4i epitope, monoclonal antibody 17b, has been particularly useful in crystallographic studies of gp120 (REF. 59 ), but, surprisingly, monoclonal antibody 17b and other monoclonal antibodies to this epitope (such as 48D) in their complete IgG form do not neutralize most of the primary isolates tested 57 . Interestingly, the antigenbinding fragment (Fab) and single-chain fragments of these CD4i-specific monoclonal antibodies do have neutralizing function 58, 60 . The inability of the whole IgG CD4i-specific monoclonal antibody to neutralize can be explained by steric hindrance, given that the distance between the CD4i epitope on gp120 and the target cell membrane in molecular models seems too small to accommodate the entire IgG molecule 61, 62, 132 .

Given that ~50% of the mass of gp120 is composed of carbohydrate moieties 63 , it is perhaps not surprising that antibodies to carbohydrates have neutralizing activity against HIV-1 (REF. 14). The best studied of the neutralizing carbohydrate-specific antibodies of human origin is the monoclonal antibody 2G12, which targets a cluster of carbohydrate moieties in gp120 (FIG. 2) ; this monoclonal antibody has broad neutralizing activity for both T-cell-line-adapted and primary isolates of HIV-1 (REFS 15, 64) . Crystallographic studies have revealed its unusual structure, which allows for multivalent interaction with a conserved cluster of oligomannose-type sugars 65 ; however, the extremely unusual configuration of this monoclonal antibody and the poor immunogenicity of the epitope recognized by monoclonal antibody 2G12 (REF. 64 ) raise several questions. What is the probability that a vaccine could regularly elicit such antibodies? How could an immunogen be designed to mimic the unique cluster of oligomannose residues targeted by 2G12? And, what is the mechanism by which this monoclonal established by Yonezawa et al. 96 who showed that infectivity was retained when the V3 loop of an X4 virus was replaced by 43 amino acids from CXCL12a region that includes the \u03b2-hairpin domain that is structurally homologous to the V3 loop of X4 viruses. These data reveal mechanisms by which the virus envelope interacts with the chemokine receptors, support the crucial role of the V3 region in virus infectivity, explain why there must be marked conservation in the V3 loop, and provide a rationale for how antibodies to conserved V3 motifs can be so highly crossreactive.",

Moreover, most V3-specific monoclonal antibodies produced by infected individuals and selected using linear V3 peptides have little neutralizing activity for primary isolates despite broad immunochemical crossreactivity 45, 84, 85 . However, in addition to isolate-specific V3-specific antibodies, broadly reactive V3-specific antibodies with potent neutralizing activity have been described; such polyclonal and monoclonal V3-specific antibodies are conformation sensitive rather than specific for linear epitopes in the V3 loop 86 . The most broadly reactive of the neutralizing V3-specific monoclonal antibodies can neutralize a large proportion of clade B HIV-1 primary isolates [87] [88] [89] [90] , and have also been shown to neutralize viruses from clades A and F, which, by definition, must have shared or crossreactive epitopes 86 . V3-specific antibodies with broad specificity and functional activity (similar to monoclonal antibodies 447/52-D, 19b and 2182) are probably produced later in infection as a result of SOMATIC HYPERMUTATION in the variable-region immunoglobulin genes that occurs during maturation of the humoral immune response to any given antigen 91 . This apparent requirement for prolonged antigenic stimulation to induce broadly reactive V3specific antibodies is a challenging problem in terms of designing a practical vaccine strategy that will induce broadly reactive, protective V3-specific antibodies. So far, no clinical vaccine trial has addressed whether longer immunization regimens induce more broadly reactive neutralizing antibodies, in general, and more highly crossreactive V3-specific antibodies, in particular.",

For example, we now know that whereas isolate-specific V3-specific antibodies are produced early after infection or immunization 68, 69, 82 , broadly reactive V3-specific antibodies are characteristic of a more mature immune response 86, 88 . Similarly, the conclusion that V3-specific antibodies are ineffective for neutralizing primary isolates was based on inefficient depletion of antibodies from HIV-1 + sera with linear V3 peptides -a process that would have failed to effectively remove antibodies that are specific for conformation-sensitive V3 epitopes 97, 98 . Moreover, careful review of early studies, as well as more recent data published by several groups, shows that epitopes in the V3 loop are not cryptic but are at least partially displayed on the surface of R5 virus particles and R5virus-infected cells 36, 37, 89, 90, 99, 100 , and that V3-specific monoclonal antibodies can neutralize R5 as well as X4 viruses 86, 87, 89, 90, 101 .",

            "text": "Some of the epitopes discussed earlier that could serve as targets of neutralizing antibodies are found in constant regions of the virus envelope; others are localized to variable regions. Although some variable epitopes, such as the V3 region, retain conserved elements, present data indicate that, at the very least, more than two conformations exist. Therefore, to induce antibodies to neutralizing epitopes in variable regions, polyvalent vaccines will be required. This requirement for polyvalent vaccines against antigenically variable pathogens is well established, given the requirement for multiple-strain-based vaccines against organisms such as polio virus, influenza virus and Streptococcus pneumoniae. For these vaccines, extensive research was necessary to identify which and how many strains were required for maximum protection. In the case of influenza virus, the choice of vaccine strains is an ongoing concern as the antigenic nature of the organism is constantly changing. Similar challenges probably face the HIV-1 vaccine field. It is highly unlikely that a single construct will protect against all subtypes of HIV-1. Given the continuing evolution of the virus and the spread of subtypes throughout the world, the question is how to choose which and how many strains need to be represented in a vaccine to give maximum protection. Initial approaches to designing polyvalent HIV-1 vaccines have been based on choosing viruses that are representative of genetically defined 'clades' (or subtypes). Clades are defined on the basis of the nucleotide sequences of the HIV-1 genome, including those genes that encode the HIV-1 envelope glycoproteins. So far, three groups of HIV-1 have been identified (M, N and O). Within group M, which is the main group that infects patients worldwide, nine clades and 14 circulating recombinant forms have been identified. Several studies have shown that sera from HIV-1 infected individuals might neutralize several primary isolates from various clades with similar potency [118] [119] [120] . So, with the exception of clades B and E, which show distinct antigenic differences 121 , there seems to be no particular preference for sera from patients infected with one clade to neutralize other viruses from the same clade; a diagramatic representation of this is shown in FIG. 5. Similarly, studies of HIV-1-specific human monoclonal antibodies, most of which come from clade-B-infected individuals (such as those listed in TABLE 1) show their comparable potency in neutralizing many viruses from various clades 32, 86, 122 . These data raise important questions about the relevance of HIV-1 genotypic classification in vaccine design. Therefore, in addition to genotypic classification, other approaches are being used to identify representative viruses for inclusion in a polyvalent HIV-1 vaccine. Bioinformatic techniques are being used to search the HIV-1 sequence database for common epitopes that could induce cross-clade immunity 123 . Related techniques are being used to identify or construct HIV-1 envelope proteins that have antigenic similarities to presently circulating strains or to ancestral viruses that might more effectively elicit crossreactive immune responses 124 . A third approach is based on immunological studies of the HIV-1 will be recognized by the immune system. Given the number of HIV-1-specific monoclonal antibodies with neutralizing activity that have been described, it is not surprising that a similar strategy has been used to determine the B-cell epitopes that they recognize. For example, Zwick et al. 39 identified a peptide mimotope of the epitope that is recognized by monoclonal antibody IgG1b12. This peptide is a homodimer, the activity of which depends on an intact disulphide bridge that joins its polypeptide chains. Disappointingly, a vaccine constructed from this synthetic peptide and conjugated to each of two different carriers failed to elicit significant gp120 crossreactive antibodies. The broadly neutralizing V3-specific human monoclonal antibody 447/52-D has also been screened with a random phage library. Most of the peptides identified and sequenced contained the GPXR-motif characteristic of the tip of the V3 loop. One of the 15-mer peptides identified as binding strongly to monoclonal antibody 447/52-D was conjugated to a carrier and used to immunize rabbits. The sera from three of four rabbits showed neutralizing activity against two of five HIV-1 variants tested 110 . These results indicate that, at least for some epitopes, the use of mimotopes defined using monoclonal antibodies might lead to the design of immunogens that will induce neutralizing antibodies. Although not a simple task, designing such mimotopes should now be more feasible as the structures of several human monoclonal antibodies with broad neutralizing activity have been studied by NMR and X-ray crystallographic analyses 15, 95, [111] [112] [113] 133 . Information about the epitopes that these monoclonal antibodies recognize and the key features of their combining sites should be useful in the design of immunogens that will induce similar antibodies. The potential promise of this approach is suggested by results obtained with mimotope-based vaccines under development against human T-cell leukaemia virus type 1 (HTLV1) 114 , measles 115 , coronavirus 116 and herpes simplex virus 2 (HSV2) 117 .",

Potent and broadly reactive neutralizing antibodies have been described in studies of sera from HIV-1-infected subjects and by the study of neutralizing monoclonal antibodies derived from the cells of HIV-1-infected individuals. Therefore, protective antibodies are represented in the human B-cell repertoire; however, inducing these antibodies with candidate vaccines has proven difficult because, although a broad range of antibodies are produced in most individuals or animals immunized with candidate vaccines, the antisera have limited neutralizing activity measured by either qualitative or quantitative means. The design of new immunogens and new approaches might be informed by the epitopes that have been described that are targeted by human neutralizing antibodies. Each of these epitopes presents unique challenges to vaccine design, but useful nuances and patterns emerge (BOX 2) . From these studies, it becomes clear that research over the past decade has documented the ability of the human immune system to produce protective antibodies against HIV-1. The challenge of the coming decade is to understand how to build immunogens that will stimulate B cells to make these antibodies.",
