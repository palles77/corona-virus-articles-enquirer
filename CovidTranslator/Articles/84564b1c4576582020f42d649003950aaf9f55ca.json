A rapid and accurate diagnosis of these respiratory viruses is essential for an appropriate patient management. Molecular tests are the best detection option due to their high sensitivity and specificity. Seegene's Allplex\u2122 Respiratory Panel 1 (Allplex RP1) is a real-time one-step RT-PCR assay for the simultaneous detection of FLUAV, FLUBV, HRSV-A and HRSV-B. In addition, it allows the determination of FLUAV subtype (H1, H3 and H1pdm09).",

Study design: The Allplex RP1 assay will be compared with other two commercial molecular assays, Prodesse ProFlu+ and ProFAST+ (Hologic, Madison, WI, USA), and GeneXpert Flu/RSV XC (Cepheid, USA). Results: Allplex RP1, ProFlu+ and GeneXpert tests showed 95%, 91% and 96% of accuracy; and 94%, 88% and 95% of sensitivity, respectively. Moreover, Allplex RP1 showed a FLUAV subtype sensitivity of 91% and 88% for FLUAV-H1pdm09 and FLUAV-H3 respectively, and ProFAST+ assay showed sensitivities of 100% for both targets. The three assays showed a 100% of specificity and PPV, while the NPV were 84%, 73% and 86% for Allplex RP1, Prodesse and GeneXpert, respectively. Conclusions: In this study, Seegene's Allplex RP1 assay showed to be highly sensitive, specific, and suitable for detection of FLUV and HRSV, including FLUAV subtyping. In addition, it is also a hands-on-time saving assay due to the automated nucleic acid extraction and PCR setup.",

Influenza virus (FLUV) and human respiratory syncytial virus (HRSV) respiratory infections are responsible for significant morbidity and mortality in both pediatric and adult population worldwide [1, 2] . Seasonal FLUV has been estimated to affect 5-10% of the world's population [3] and by the age of two, practically all children are estimated to have been infected at least once with HRSV [4] . An early identification of the causative pathogen is essential for a prompt and appropriate patient management [5] . Furthermore, it minimizes the patient hospitalization stay and risk of complications, as well as it aims to establish a rapid implementation of isolation and control measures reducing the nosocomial transmission risk [6] . Microbiological tests are needed for a precise and rapid identification of the causative agents. Among them, techniques such as viral culture isolation and antigenbased assays have been widely used in the past. However, these techniques have low and widely variable sensitivity and specificity. Moreover, they are time-consuming and labour-intensive [7] . Therefore, molecular tests are nowadays considered the best detection choice as they have demonstrated to be the most sensitive and specific techniques. In addition, the use of multiplex PCR-based methods enables a rapid and accurate identification of multiple targets in the same reaction [8] .",

For the hospital routine testing, specimens were processed within the first 24 h either by immunochromatography (Binax Now RSV Card, Allere Scarborough Inc, USA), immunofluorescence (D 3 Ultra 8\u2122 DFA Respiratory Virus Screening & Identification Kit, Diagnostic HYBRIDS, USA) or real-time multiplex RT-PCR (Anyplex II RV16 Detection Kit, Seegene, Korea and GeneXpert Flu/RSV XC, Cepheid, USA) assays depending on the clinical needing. In case of FLUV or HRSV positive samples, two in-house real-time RT-PCR assays were also performed to determine the FLUAV subtype (H1, H1pdm09 or H3) or the HRSV genetic group (A or B). Then, samples were kept in aliquots at \u221280\u00b0C until their use for this clinical evaluation.",

According to manufacturer's instructions, Seegene's assay prior nucleic acids (NA) extraction required 350 \u03bcl of the respiratory sample to be eluted in a final volume of 50 \u03bcl by using an automation extraction protocol on Microlab NIMBUS IVD workstation, which also performed the PCR setup. The real-time RT-PCR was done on the CFX96\u2122 (Bio-Rad, California, USA) platform, and subsequently interpreted by Seegene's Viewer software. For Hologic's assay, NA were extracted from 200 \u03bcl of the respiratory specimen to be eluted in 100 \u03bcl using NucliSense easyMAG (BioM\u00e9rieux, Marcy l'\u00c9toile, France) according to manufacturer's instructions. The real-time RT-PCR was done on the SmartCycler (Cepheid, California, USA) platform. Cepheid's assay fully integrates and automates samples NA extraction, target amplification and detection from 300 \u03bcl of sample in the same cartridge. All samples were processed in parallel for the three respiratory virus detection assays with the aim to minimize the risk of bias in the comparison.",

Moreover, the three studied assays showed excellent specificity and PPV values. An important characteristic of Allplex RP1 to be highlighted is that it works detecting two different targets of FLUAV in a single reaction allowing to determine FLUAV subtype and then improving its detection. Though ProFAST+ assay showed highest sensitivity values than Allplex RP1 assay for FLUAV subtyping, Hologic assay required to perform an additional reaction increasing the final test cost. In addition, it is important to consider that in the case of Hologic only the subtyping of those samples that were positive for FLUAV for the ProFlu+ test was then tested by ProFAST+. Moreover, Allplex RP1 in contrast to both ProFlu+ and GeneXpert also provided information regarding the genetic group of HRSV, distinguishing between group A and group B. The availability of an assay that provides all these information is an excellent option to be used in the laboratory since it reports relevant epidemiological interest information [12] . Nonetheless, in this study the validation parameters for FLUAV-H1 could not be determined because there was no availability of seasonal FLUAV-H1 laboratory-confirmed samples. It is well-known that seasonal FLUAV-H1 does not circulate worldwide since the 2009-2010 season but a future circulation of this FLUAV subtyped cannot be discarded in a near future. The availability to detect this target, particularly in a commercial diagnostic method, might help to monitor the re-emergence of this FLUV subtype in the community.",

The automated process and the minimum hands-on time must be remarked as it can be used in a highthroughput laboratory workflow, minimizing human error risk and NA contaminations, improving the quality control and reducing the laboratory-related costs. In addition, the data interpretation software (Seegene Viewer) is optimized for multiplex assays and detects in a single channel multiple Ct and fluorophores values providing a semiquantitative information and also minimizing human error, which could occur with higher probability in the interpretation of fluorescent curves in the case of Hologic's assay.",
