It was discovered approximately 25 years ago in the laboratory of Melvin Bosma at the Fox Chase Cancer Center (PA, USA). A spontaneous mutation was noted in a colony of Balb/c mice, line CB17, while the investigators were studying allotypes of mouse immunoglobulins [1]. These mice were found to have minimal mouse immunoglobulin and, upon further investigation, they lacked both mature T and B cells, and precursors of T and B cells failed to differentiate into functional immune cells. The point mutation was later identified to affect the catalytic subunit of a mouse DNA-dependent protein kinase [2, 3] , resulting in severe impairment of the recombination of T-and B-cell receptors. These mice are, however, viable, surviving quite well in a pathogenfree environment, mainly by utilizing their innate immunity of natural killer (NK) cells, myeloid cells and monocytic cells for immune defenses. \u2020Author for correspondence Lupus Research 3rd Floor,",

            "text": "In view of its limited ability to mount an immune response to foreign tissues, immunologists quickly realized the advantage of such a SCID mouse in accepting allografts and xenografts. Indeed, both Mosier et al. [4] and McCune et al. [5] published their findings of engrafting human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) or human fetal thymus/liver in these mice. The terminologies hu-SCID-PBL or SCID-hu thy/liv were used respectively to distinguish these two experimental systems. The development of the two models in xenografts concurred with the discovery of HIV, which can only propagate in human immune cells. Both systems have been successfully used in testing therapeutics for HIV and in improving understanding of the pathophysiology of the virus [6, 7] . It was, however, found that the original CB17/SCID mice could be 'leaky', such that, as the mice get older, they can spontaneously repair the defect and could often have circulating immunoglobulins. Shultz et al. later bred the SCID mutation onto the nonobese diabetic (NOD) mouse, creating the NOD/SCID mouse, which has reduced 'leakiness', lower levels of NK cells and a defective complement system [8] . The development and modification of the NOD/SCID mice has been detailed in a recent review by Shultz et al. [9] . The most significant advance within the humanized mouse model is the creation of the SCID mouse, with the disrupted IL-2 receptor (IL-2R)-\u03b3 chain (c)-knockout (KO), the common cytokine receptor for IL-2, -4, -7, -9, -15 and -21 [10, 11] . Four independent laboratories have created or studied four separate lines with IL-2R-\u03b3c-KO mice that are now in use for engraftment of human hematopoietic cells and other tissues [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] . Two of the IL-2R-\u03b3c-KO mouse lines are on BALB/c -the Rag2-KO mouse, where the recombination activation gene 2 is deleted; thus, similar to the SCID phenotype, it lacks mature T and B cells. The origin of BALB/c -the Rag2 \u2212/\u2212 IL-2R-\u03b3c-KO used in Spit's laboratory -was a IL-2R-\u03b3c-KO mouse that was generated by A Berns and P Krimpenfort at The Netherlands Cancer Institute (Amsterdam, The Netherlands) [SPITS H, PERS. COMM.]. The Rag2 \u2212/\u2212 IL-2R-\u03b3c-KO mouse used in Manz's study came from M Ito at the Central Institute for Experimental Animals (CIEA; Kawasaki, Japan) [13] . The other two SCID lines with IL-2R-\u03b3c-KO on NOD/SCID mice originated from M Ito at CIEA and L Shultz at The Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME, USA) [11, 15, 16] and are designated as NOG and NSG, respectively. These NOD/SCID-IL-2R-\u03b3c-KO (NOG or NSG) mice and the BALB/c-Rag2 \u2212/\u2212 IL-2R-gc-KO (DKO for Ito's mice) mice are the most permissive hosts for xenografts and, in particular, human CD34 + stem cells, due in part to their lack of NK cells, whose differentiation depends on some of these cytokines. Subsequent to the original publications, many laboratories have used various strategies to achieve engraftment of human CD34 + stem cells, succeeding in effective differentiation and development of mature T and B cells, monocytes and NK cells. Human granulocytes and erythrocytes are, however, not well populated in these humanized mice. The data have been extensively described in several reviews, a number of which are summarized in TABLE 1. However, with the exception of using human fetal thymus, the engrafted and emerging human T cells were 'educated' on the mouse thymus epithelium and appeared to exhibit mouse T-cell restriction [14, 17] . While the human T-cell receptors were rearranged, the viral epitopes recognized by the immunized T cells were in the context of the mouse MHC molecules, rather than that of the human, in both the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) and influenza systems [14, 17] . It was, thus, hypothesized that providing human MHC HLA class I and II transgenes in these NOG, NSG or DKO mice would allow the engrafted human pre-T cells to be 'educated' and selected on the thymus epithelium, bearing human MHC elements (class I and II transgenes), and developing humanlike T-cell repertoires and responses. Accordingly, we and other investigators are currently establishing SCID or NSG mice with transgenic HLA class I genes, such as the A*0201 allele (A2-NSG) from NOD/SCID-HLA-A*0201 mice [18, 19] , as well as transgenic HLA class II DR1*0101 from NOD/SCID-DR1 mice [20] .",

The preclinical model to test therapeutics for the HIV virus was established with 50 million PBMCs per mouse, administered intra peritoneally. The requirement of such high inoculums of PBMCs is in part due to the presence of NK cells, which lyse or inhibit the engraftment of human PBMCs. The use of NOD/SCID mice with lower NK activity marginally improved the engraftment. Depletion of the NK activity with anti-NK antibody, such as anti-AsGm1 antibody, further improved the engraftment [21] . However, a syndrome of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) often occurred in this humanized mouse model. The engrafted animals lost weight and eventually died within 2-3 months. The humanized SCID mice have contributed immensely to biomedical research, despite the engrafted human cells being within 5% of the spleen or blood populations. TABLE 2 lists some of the studies where PBMCs or T cells have been engrafted into SCID mice for the monitoring and studying of infectious diseases, autoimmune disease of systemic lupus erythematosis (lupus), skin-graft rejection and adoptive T-cell immunotherapy.",

They compared the engraftment of PBMCs in NOD/ SCID versus NSG mice and clearly demonstrated better engraftment of PBMCs in NSG mice. Furthermore, 10-20 million cells intravenously or intraperitoneally were required to achieve engraftment of 50-80% of CD45 + cells in the blood and spleen. King et al. also tested the immune responsiveness of the engrafted PBMCs in a diabetes model, which was implanted with human islet cells in the spleen of a chemically induced diabetic NSG mouse. Upon engraftment of allogeneic PBMCs, the exogenous human islet cells were destroyed, resulting in subsequent diabetes. Thus, this study demonstrated that the PBMCs in the IL-2R-\u03b3c-KO mice can mount allogeneic responses to the human islet cells.",

The rationale of our investigation is founded on previous marginal success to obtain in vitro CMV antigenspecific cells from PBMCs of CMV-seronegative individuals [24] . The use of A2-NSG mice is based on the assumption that the antigen-presenting cells in these mice can facilitate improved immune responses. We have, thus, infused PBMCs derived from a series of healthy seronegative, HLA A*0201 + and non-HLA A*0201 + volunteer donors into nonirradiated A2-NSG mice (2-3 \u00d7 10 6 PBMCs intraperitoneally and 2-3 \u00d7 10 6 PBMCs via intravenal routes, totaling 5-6 million cells per mouse). Subsequently, on days 3 and 4, we immunized these mice by subcutaneous inoculation with irradiated HLA A*0201 + artificial antigen-presenting cells (AAPCs), transduced to express CMV-pp65 as immunogen. The AAPCs are mouse NIH 3T3 fibroblasts engineered to express a human class I HLA allele, and they can process and efficiently present viral epitopes on the expressed HLA allele, eliciting functional, virusspecific human T-cell responses, as previously demonstrated by Papanicolaou et al. [25] . These AAPCs express the human costimulatory molecules ICAM-1, B7.1 and LFA-3 as well as B 2 M and a single HLA class I heavy-chain molecule, such as HLA-A*0201. The A2-AAPC-CMV-pp65 cells were, thus, used as a surrogate vaccine.",

At this time, 40-92% of the spleen cells were human CD45 + mononuclear cells, of which 85-90% were CD3 + . Among the T cells, 13-37% were CD3 + CD8 + cells and 53-87% were CD3 + CD4 + cells. The harvested splenic T cells were subsequently expanded in vitro for an additional 10-21 days in the presence of irradiated HLA-matched AAPC-CMV-pp65 cells, and tested for CMV-pp65-specific T-cell responses. These included the quantification of CD8 + cells binding to the HLA-A2-CMV peptide tetramers and the production of IFN-\u03b3 when the human cells were sensitized with the specific CMV peptides. We found that approximately 2% of the cells were CMV-pp65 epitope-HLA A0201 tetramerpositive T cells. Approximately 1-2% of the CD8 + T cells also generated IFN-\u03b3, specifically in response to stimulation with CMV-pp65 peptide-loaded autologous EBV-transformed B cells [25] . Therefore, these studies suggest that in vivo sensitization in the humanized NSG mouse may indeed elicit primary CMV-pp65-specific T-cell responses from naive populations in CMV-seronegative individuals. TABLE 3 shows a summary of some of the immune functions of the spleen cells from the humanized mice immunized with A2-AAPC-CMV-pp65 cells. Interestingly, an A1 + B08 + donor also responded to the immunization with A2-AAPC-CMV-pp65 cells (TABLE 3) , although we did not have B08-specific peptide tetramers to test for antigen-specific T cells. These results suggest that the pp65 antigen was likely processed by the autologous antigen-presenting cells.",

These mice generally showed more than 50% engraftment of CD45 + cells, but they did not exhibit the typical GVHD of skin lesions or enteritis, perhaps consistent with the observation that there was little engraftment of human cells in the mesenteric nodes and Peyer's patches of the humanized mice (SU L, PERS. COMM.) [16] , probably due to the IL-2R-\u03b3c mutation. We have also intravenously transfused 5 million A2-CBMCs into A2-NSG mice and observed similar engraftment as when A2 + PBMCs were used. Furthermore, we can also elicit an immune response that was restricted to the HLA-A2 allele in the CMV system (data not shown). Presently, we have preliminary data suggesting that the immune response of PBMCs in A2-NSG mice appeared to be better, when comparing engraftment of the same donor in NSG and A2-NSG mice.

Indeed, there were fewer symptoms of weight loss and anemia related to GVHD, although the engraftment of CBMCs resulted predominantly in B cells in the bone morrow, with little T-cell engraftment observed [26] . As an alternative strategy to improve engraftment of human T cells, Camacho et al. developed the NOD/SCID mouse with HLA class DR1*0101 (NOD/SCID-DR1) transgenes [20] , where the DR1 transgene was located on chromosome 5. We characterized their immunobiology and the innate immunity, such as NK activity, LPS response and antigen presentation, and they were found to be similar to that of the NOD/SCID mice [27] . We found enhanced engraftment of human T cells in the transgenic mice, compared with NOD/SCID mice, whether the donors were DR1*0101 or not. Engraftment with human CBMCs resulted in slight changes in the architecture/structure of spleens, with no defined germinal centers of a normal spleen. Such chimeric mice were then immunized with an adenovirus cancer vaccine to human carcino-embryonic antigen (CEA). The engrafted human cells responded to this cancer vaccine by producing intracellular interferons when the spleen cells from the immunized chimeric mice were further cultured in vitro with CEA peptides [27] . Therefore, engrafted CBMCs can respond to the CEA vaccine in the humanized NOD/SCID-DR1 mice. Presently, we are breeding the DR1 transgene onto the NSG background, rendering the mice more amendable for engraftment of human hematopoietic cells, as elaborated earlier.",

Accordingly, adult PBMCs or CBMCs (5 million/mouse) could be injected either intravenously or via a combination of intravenous and intraperitoneal administration (2.5 million in each route of injection). Recipients could include various NOG, NSG or DKO SCID mice, with or without HLA transgenes. After 3 days postinfusion of human cells, the humanized mice could be immunized two-to three-times with the vaccine of interest. A total of 7-21 days following the second or third immunization, the sensitized mice could be challenged with the specific vaccinated antigen, in the form of tumor cells or tissues, expressing the putative antigen and matched for the HLA haplotype of the donor PBMCs or CBMCs. Ideally, using autologous tumor and tissues of the PBMC/CBMC donors would be the best strategy to avoid allogeneic rejection/reaction. For testing immune responsiveness, ex vivo immune functional assays could also be assessed, such as the measurement of the production of IFN-\u03b3 after further in vitro antigenic stimulation, as is commonly performed in vaccine evaluation.",

Immune responses of humanized A2-NSG-PBMC mice immunized with A2-AAPC-CMC-pp65 cells. Mice were engrafted with three different normal donors with HLA-A2 + or HLA-A1 + B08 + genotypes, negative for detectable CMV antibodies (n = 2 control mice per donor without immunization; n = 4 mice per donor with immunization). By 3 days postinfusion of human PBMCs, mice were immunized with irradiated A2-AAPC-CMV-pp65 cells. At 21 days postimmunization, spleen cells were analyzed for human CD45 + cells and subsets of T cells, and they were then further stimulated in vitro. Spleens from two mice were pooled. After culturing with HLA-matched irradiated AAPC-CMV-pp65 cells for 10-14 days, the cells were quantified for CD8 + cells binding to the HLA-A2-CMV-peptide tetramers from pooled cultures. B08-specific peptide tetramers were not available presently for this study. Some samples from pooled cultures were tested for production of IFN-\u03b3, after incubating with CMV specific pp65 peptides, presented by autologous PBMC-or EBV-transformed B cells [25] . Negative controls included nonspecific tetramer or peptides, with values of less than 0.2%.
