PCR-amplified dsDNA fragments containing the eIF2\u03b1 sequence were cloned into a pET28a vector using an In-Fusion HD Cloning Kit (Takara Bio), resulting in the kanamycin-resistant expression plasmid, pAA007. pAA007 was co-transformed into One Shot BL21 Star (DE3) chemically competent E. coli cells (Invitrogen), along with the tetracycline-inducible, chloramphenicol-resistant plasmid, pG-Tf2, containing the chaperones groES, groEL, and tig (Takara Bio). Transformed cells were grown in Luria broth containing kanamycin and chloramphenicol at 37\u00b0C on an orbital shaker. When the culture reached an OD600 of 0.2, 1ng/mL tetracycline was added to induce expression of chaperones. At an OD600 of 0.8, the temperature was reduced to 16\u00b0C, eIF2\u03b1 expression was induced with 1 mM IPTG (Gold Biotechnology) and the culture was grown for 16 hours. Cells were harvested and lysed with EmulsiFlex-C3 (Avestin) in a buffer containing 100 mM HEPES-KOH, pH 7.5, 300 mM KCl, 2 mM dithiothreitol (DTT), 5 mM MgCl2, 5 mM imidazole, 10% glycerol, 0.1% NP-40, and complete EDTA-free protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche). The lysate was clarified at 10,000g for 60 min at 4\u00b0C. Subsequent purification steps were conducted on the \u00c4KTA Pure (GE Healthcare) system at 4\u00b0C.",

Transformed bacteria were grown in Luria broth containing ampicillin, kanamycin, and chloramphenicol. For purification, 1x PhosSTOP (Roche) was added to the lysis and purification buffers.

U2OS were infected with EMCV-L Zn for 6 h, or treated with 500 \u00b5M arsenite for 1 h. 1 h prior to harvesting, cells were treated with 200 nM ISRIB or left untreated. 15 min prior to harvesting, all samples were treated with 20 \u00b5g/ml puromycin. Arsenite and EMCV-L Zn containing supernatants were kept on the cells during these treatments. Subsequently, cells were harvested and analyzed by Western blot, using the indicated antibodies. . Quantification of P-eIF2\u03b1 band intensities, corrected for eIF2\u03b1 band intensity, is shown in the right panel. Mock infected cells are set at 0% induction, maximum P-eIF2\u03b1 level was set at 100% induction. (B) Flow cytometry analysis of P-eIF2\u03b1 levels in cells treated with different arsenite concentrations. Results are shown as histograms (left panels) and the percentage increase in P-eIF2\u03b1 MFI is shown in the right panel. Mock infected cells are set at 0% induction, maximum P-eIF2\u03b1 level was set at 100% induction. A representative of two independent experiments is shown. Figure S3 . The P-eIF2\u03b1 plateau level corresponds to almost complete phosphorylation of the eIF2\u03b1 pool. (A) purified eIF2\u03b1 and P-eIF2\u03b1 samples, as well as mixtures that contain the indicated percentages of phosphorylated eIF2\u03b1 were analyzed by Western blotting. The ratios in band intensities of P-eIF2\u03b1 and total eIF2\u03b1 were quantified in ImageJ software, and used to create the standard curve shown in the right panel. (B) Cell lysates from Hela-R19 cells treated with the indicated arsenite concentrations for 1 h were analyzed by Western blotting, and ratios between P-eIF2\u03b1 and total eIF2\u03b1 signals were quantified in ImageJ software. Using the standard curve from (A) as reference, we calculated approximate values for the percentages of eIF2\u03b1 molecules that are phosphorylated in arsenite treated cells (right panel). Averages and standard deviations of two independent experiments are shown. Figure S4 . EMCV-L Zn induced ISR activity late in infection is not inhibited by increased ISRIB concentrations. HeLa-R19 cells were infected with EMCV-L Zn (MOI=10) for 6 h, or treated with 50 \u00b5M arsenite for 1 h. 1 h prior to harvesting, cells were treated with the indicated concentrations of ISRIB. Cells were fixed in PFA and SG formation was analyzed by IFA, using antibodies specific to G3BP1.",
