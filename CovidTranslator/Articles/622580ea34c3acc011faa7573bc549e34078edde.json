COVID-19 was first reported in Wuhan, China, in December, 2019, followed by an outbreak across Hubei Province, other parts of China, and now all over the world, particularly in South Korea, Iran, Italy, and Japan. A study in the New England Journal of Medicine by Zhong Nanshan and colleagues 1 reported nine cases with conjunctival congestion among the 1,099 cases enrolled. However, other ocular manifestations of COVID-19 are unknown, such as increased conjunctival secretion, epiphora, and diminution of vision. Several infected cases 2, 3 presented firstly with conjunctivitis before the onset of pneumonia, implying that the ocular route might be the potential transmission route of SARS-CoV-2 virus under certain conditions. A recent study revealed that SARS-CoV-2 also uses the cell entry receptor, angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), 4, 5 similar to SARS-CoV. Moreover, the expression and activity of ACE2 can be detected in the ocular surface, including the cornea and conjunctiva, 6 which provides transocular entry potential for SARS-CoV-2.",

Therefore, the present epidemiologic study summarized the manifestations present on the ocular surface. We enrolled 534 patients and found that COVID-19 patients exhibit ocular manifestations including conjunctival congestion (25), secretion (52), foreign body sensation (63), blurred vision (63), dry eye (112), itching (53), photophobia (15) , and tearing (55). The incidence of conjunctival congestion in our study is 4.68%, which is higher than that in Zhong's large sample report (9/1,099, 0.82%) and",

Therefore, we suggest that the conjunctival swab test for SARS-CoV-2 should be performed in patients with conjunctival congestion. Our study also found that the average duration of conjunctival congestion was 4.9 \u00b1 2.6 days (mean [SD]), ranging from 2 to 10 days. Two patients diagnosed with COVID patients had an initial symptom of conjunctival congestion, which reminds us that ocular manifestations occur early in the course of COVID-19. Therefore, healthcare workers should pay attention to patients' ocular symptoms and manifestations in the early stage of disease and should perform a conjunctival swab test for SARS-CoV-2 in patients with conjunctival congestion. SARS-CoV-2 is thought to be transmitted from person to person mainly through respiratory droplets or close contact. 11 The ocular surface is exposed to the outside environment, which may become a potential gateway for pathogens such as viruses to invade the human body. 12, 13 Thus, hand-eye contact should be avoided as much as possible. We found that a total of 332 COVID-19 patients had a history of hand-eye contact, including 286 cases who reported seldom hand-eye contact and 46 who reported frequent hand-eye contact.

The duration of conjunctival congestion ranged from two days to 12 days. Conjunctival congestion appeared mostly (72%) after the first clinical symptoms of COVID-19. Four patients (cases 11, 20, 23 and 24) had positive results for SARS-CoV-2 in nasopharyngeal swabs at the same time as the conjunctival congestion appeared.
