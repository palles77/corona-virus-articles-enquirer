            "text": "Nanotechnology is the study, design, creation, synthesis, manipulation, and application of materials, devices, and systems at the nanometer scale (one meter consists of 1 billion nanometers) [1] . Nanotechnology (sometimes shortened to \"nanotech\") is the study of manipulating matter on an atomic and molecular scale. Generally nanotechnology deals with structures sized between 1 and 100 nm in at least one dimension and involves developing materials or devices within that size. Much of the study of nanoscience relates to the phenomenon of self-assembly in which nanoscale building blocks selfassemble to form complex structures. Microbiology relates to nanoscience at a number of levels. Many bacterial entities are nanomachines in nature, including molecular motors like flagella and pili. Bacteria also form biofilms by the process of self-assembly (e.g., the formation of Curli-film by Eschericia coli). The formation of aerial hyphae by bacteria and fungi is also directed by the controlled and ordered assembly of building blocks. In addition, the formation of virus capsids is a classical process of molecular recognition and self-assembly at the nanoscale. Another completely different aspect is the use of nanoordered bacterial assemblies for nanotechnology. Nanoscience impacts several areas of microbiology. It allows for the study and visualization at the molecular assembly level of a process and facilitates identification of molecular recognition and self-assembly motifs and the assessment of these processes. These are relevant to many microbial processes as mentioned above. 21.2 Nanomaterials",

Materials that have one dimension in the nanoscale (and are extended in the other two dimensions) are layers, such as thin films or surface coatings. Some of the features on computer chips come under this category. Materials that are nanoscale in two dimensions (and extended in one dimension) include nanowires and nanotubes. Materials that are nanoscale in three dimensions are particles, e.g., precipitates, colloids, and quantum dots (tiny particles of semiconductor materials). Nanocrystalline materials, made up of nanometer-sized grains, also fall into this category. The nanomaterial field includes subfields which study or develop materials having unique properties arising from their nanoscale dimensions [2] : l Interface and colloid science has given rise to many materials which may be useful in nanotechnology such as carbon nanotubes and other fullerenes and various nanoparticles and nanorods. Nanomaterials with fast ion transport are also related to nanoionics and nanoelectronics. l Progress has been made in using these materials for medical applications. l Nanoscale materials are sometimes used in solar cells which combat the cost of traditional silicon solar cells.",

For inside the body, many companies are developing nanotechnology applications for anticancer drugs, implanted insulin pumps, and gene therapy. Other researchers are working on prostheses and implants that include nanostructured materials. Nanotechnology applications have not been marketed long enough for claims to be corroborated about risks to human health and environment. Still, small nanoparticles can enter the human body through pores and may accumulate in cells. The health effects of such nanoparticles are unknown.

            "text": "Nanobots are robots that carry out a very specific function and are ~50-100 nm wide. They can be used very effectively for drug delivery. Normally, drugs work through the entire body before they reach the disease-affected area. Using nanotechnology, the drug can be targeted to a precise location which would make the drug much more effective and reduce the chances of possible side effects. Figure 21 .1 shows a device that uses nanobots to monitor the sugar level in the blood [4] . Special sensor nanobots can be inserted into the blood under the skin where microchips, coated with human molecules and designed to emit an electrical impulse signal, monitor the sugar level in the blood. The drug carriers have walls that are just 5-10 atoms thick and the inner drug-filled cell is usually 50-100 nm wide. When they detect signs of the disease, thin wires in their walls emit an electrical pulse which causes the walls to dissolve and the drug to be released. A great advantage of using nanobots for drug delivery is that the amount and time of drug release can be easily controlled by controlling the electrical pulse [5] . Furthermore, the walls dissolve easily and are therefore harmless to the body. Elan Pharmaceuticals has already started using this technology in their drugs Merck's Emend and Wyeth's Rapamune [6] . Nanomedicine could make use of these nanorobots (e.g., Computational Genes), introduced into the body, to repair or detect damages and infections. Using nanotechnology, the drug can be targeted to a precise location which would make the drug much more effective and reduce the chances of possible side effects. In the future, these nanorobots could actually be programmed to repair specific diseased cells, functioning in a similar way to antibodies in our natural healing processes.",

The tools to conduct research in microbiology can be separated into two main fieldsmicroscopy, which is required for visualization, and molecular biology, which has been used to characterize (in some cases comprehensively) the genetic and proteomic makeup of these organisms. The initial steps in opening the field of microbiology came with the advent of the first microscopes. Bacteria were first visualized by Antony van Leeuwenhoek, using a simple, self-built microscope, around 1676. The microscopes built by Leeuwenhoek were not compound microscopes, relying instead on a single lens, more like a very powerful magnifying glass.

When imaged with AFM, the surface of the cell appears very smooth and is easily deformed, necessitating careful scanning at minimal force (Figure 21.9 ). The only apparent surface feature is the bud scar at the opposite end of the mother cell to the newly forming daughter cell. The surface appears smooth as the sugars obscure the membrane. ",

AFM has been used to characterize the unique surface structures of distinct mutants of S. mutans. These mutations are located in specific genes that encode surface proteins, thus using AFM characteristic surface features have been resolved for mutant strains compared to the wild type. Ultimately, characterization of surface morphology has shown distinct differences in the local properties displayed by various S. mutans strains on the nanoscale, which is imperative for understanding the collective properties of these cells in biofilm formation [19] .",

However, many studies have shown that nanoleakages, which are only around 20-100 nm wide [39, 40] compared to 10-20 \u03bcm wide microleakage gaps, occur within the hybrid layer even in the absence of gap formation. Although the spaces are too small to allow for bacterial penetration, they are large enough for enzymes and water to enter and cause degradation of resin/dentin bonds over time. The original interpretation of nanoleakage was that the silver dye used for the leakage studies occupied nanometer-sized spaces around naked collagen fibrils, where resin failed to infiltrate, or where residual water had not been displaced by the adhesive resin [41] . An improved understanding of the nanostructure of collagen fibrils in dentin would lead to reinterpretation of nanoleakage occurrence and may provide insights into the fundamental limitations of adhesives used in the restorative dental materials.",

Microfilled composites comprises silicon dioxide filler particles with less than 100 nm in diameter in conjunction with prepolymerized organic fillers, aggregated by crushing them into larger filler particles. Nowadays, the most commonly used resin composites, i.e., microhybrids and nanofilled composites, comprise filler particles ranging from ~20 to 600 nm. Other dental nanotechnologies rely on the delivery of molecules that facilitate tooth structure remineralization by means of noninvasive dental techniques that forestall caries, the latter being an active area of nanoresearch in dentistry. In agreement with Saunders [42] , the most tempting venue for speculation on the next 21.8 Nanodentistry phase of nanorestoration of tooth structure is biomimetics, i.e, mimicking processes that occur in nature [43, 44] .",

In enamel, the aim appears to be unraveling the ways to mimic nature's own nanotechnological mechanism by which the cooperative interaction between the nanoscale self-assemblies of amelogenin and the uniaxially oriented apatite crystals proceeds [42, 53] . Dentin, on the other hand, is linked to far more challenging scenarios.
