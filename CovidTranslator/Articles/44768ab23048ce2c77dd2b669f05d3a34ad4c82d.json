In cells infected with avian coronavirus infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), three proteins of 100, 39, and 35 kDa, respectively, were previously identified as mature cleavage products released from the 1b region of the 1a/1b polyprotein by the 3C-like proteinase. In this report, we show the identification of two more cleavage products of 68 and 58 kDa released from the same region of the polyprotein. In addition, two stable intermediate cleavage products with molecular masses of 160 and 132 kDa, respectively, were identified in IBV-infected cells. The 160-kDa protein was shown to be an intermediate cleavage product covering the 100-and 68-kDa proteins, and the 132-kDa protein to be an intermediate cleavage product covering the 58-, 39-, and 35-kDa proteins. Immunofluorescent staining of IBV-infected cells and cells expressing individual cleavage products showed that the 100-, 68-, and 58-kDa proteins were associated with the membranes of the endoplasmic reticulum, and the 39-and 35-kDa proteins displayed diffuse distribution patterns.",

            "text": "In addition to the viral proteinases, understanding of the functions of other cleavage products from the 1a and 1a/1b polyproteins is emerging. For example, the 71-kDa protein released from the human coronavirus 1a/1b polyprotein was shown to possess ATPase and RNA duplex-unwinding activities, confirming the previous predication that the protein may be the viral helicase (Heusipp et al., 1997a; Seybert et al., 2000a,b) . Immunofluorescence and biochemical studies demonstrated that several cleavage products are membrane-associated and colocalize with the viral RNA replication-transcription machinery (Bost et al., 2000; Denison et al., 1999; Ng and Liu, 2000; Schiller et al., 1998; Shi et al., 1999; Sims et al., 2000; Ziebuhr and Siddell, 1999; , suggesting the involvement of these products in viral RNA replication. More recent studies showed that the first cleavage product of mouse hepatitis virus-A59 (MHV-A59) 1a and 1a/1b polyproteins, p28, might play a direct role in viral RNA synthesis together with polymerase and helicase (Bost et al., 2000; Sims et al., 2000) . Other cleavage products, such as the MHV 22-kDa protein, may segregate into different but tightly associated membrane populations which may serve independent functions during viral replication (Bost et al., 2000; Sims et al., 2000) .",

Among them, the 100-, 39-, and 35-kDa proteins were specifically identified in IBV-infected cells. In this communication, we report the identification of the two previously unidentified products, the 68-and 58-kDa proteins, in IBVinfected cells with newly raised region-specific antisera. Meanwhile, two relatively stable intermediate cleavage products with molecular masses of approximately 160 and 132 kDa were identified. Analysis of the expression and processing kinetics showed that both the 160-and 132-kDa intermediate cleavage products coexist with their final cleavage products during the viral replication cycle. Furthermore, immunofluorescence analysis showed that the 100-, 68-, and 58-kDa proteins were associated with the membranes of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), while the 39-and 35-kDa proteins displayed diffuse distribution patterns.",

Taken together with the Q 3928 -S 2929 dipeptide bond (encoded by nucleotides 12310-12315) identified as the N-terminal cleavage site of the 100-kDa protein, cleavage at these positions would result in the release of five mature products with molecular masses of approximately 100, 68, 58, 39, and 35 kDa. Among them, the 100-, 39-, and 35-kDa proteins were specifically identified in IBV-infected cells (Liu et al., 1994 . To further identify and characterize the cleavage products, four new region-specific antisera, anti-100, anti-68, anti-58, and anti-35, were raised in rabbits against bacterially expressed viral proteins. The IBV proteins used to raise these antisera were encoded by nucleotides 12447-15131, 15536-16787, 16932-18494, and 19509-20414, respectively (Fig. 1) . Anti-100 was raised to replace V-58, which was raised against the IBV sequence encoded by nucleotides 14492-15520, and was used to identify the 100-kDa protein in IBV- infected cells (Liu et al., 1994) . The specificities of these antisera were tested by immunoprecipitation assay, showing that they could specifically precipitate their target proteins synthesized in both the in vitro system and intact cells (data not shown).",

To reduce the background, 5 g/ml of actinomycin D was added to the culture medium at 2 h postinfection and cells were labeled with [ 35 S]methionine and cysteine at 6 h postinfection. Cell lysates were prepared from cells harvested at 8 h postinfection and subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-100, anti-68, anti-58, V17, and anti-35. V17 was raised against the IBV polypeptides encoded by nucleotides 19154-20414 and used to detect the 39-and 35-kDa proteins in IBV-infected cells in a previous report . Immunoprecipitation with anti-100 resulted in the detection of the 100-kDa protein and a protein with an apparent molecular mass of 160 kDa (Fig.  2a, lane 10) . The 160-kDa protein was also detected by anti-68 (Fig. 2a, lane 9) . No product corresponding to the 68-kDa putative helicase domain-containing protein was detected by anti-68 (Fig. 2a, lane 9) . The detection of the 160-kDa protein with the two N-terminally specific antisera and the apparent molecular mass of the protein suggest that it may be an intermediate cleavage product containing the 100-kDa and the putative 68-kDa proteins. Immunoprecipitation of the same lysates with anti-58 resulted in the detection of two products with apparent molecular masses of 58 and 132 kDa (Fig. 2a, lane 8) . The 132-kDa protein was also immunoprecipitated by V17 and anti-35 (Fig. 2a, lanes 6 and 7) . In addition, V17 also precipitated specifically the 39-and 35-kDa proteins (Fig. 2a, lane 7) . Once again, very weak immunoprecipitation of the 35-kDa protein was observed (Fig. 2a, lane  7) . The 35-kDa protein was also weakly immunoprecipitated by anti-35 (Fig. 2a, lane 6 ). The detection of the 132-kDa protein by the three C-terminally specific antisera and the apparent molecular mass of the protein suggest that it may be an intermediate cleavage product derived from the C-terminal region of the polyprotein. Interestingly, the three C-terminally specific antisera also weakly immunoprecipitated the 160-kDa protein (Fig. 2a , lanes 6-8). The reason for this result is currently unclear, but it may reflect the interaction among the cleavage products.",

The protein was detected by Western blot in IBV-infected cells harvested at 24 and 32 h postinfection. As the equivalent human coronavirus 71-kDa protein was shown to be an RNA helicase (Heusipp et al., 1997a; Seybert et al., 2000a,b) , this protein is likely the IBV helicase. It is expected that such a functional product directly involved in viral RNA replication would be expressed at early stages of the viral replication cycle. In fact, the equivalent 71-kDa protein of human coronavirus was first seen in virus-infected cells at 5 h postinfection (Heusipp et al., 1997a) . The reason for the failure to detect the 68-kDa protein in IBV-infected cells at earlier time point is uncertain, but it might reflect the folding property, as discussed later, of the protein. The dramatic increase in the detection of the 68-kDa protein at 24 and 32 h postinfection may partially be due to the secondary infection of cells that remain uninfected during the primary infection. As significantly more cells (over 95% of cells) were infected at 24-32 h postinfection, it is understandable that more protein would be detected. A slight, but gradual increase of the accumulation of the human coronavirus 71-kDa protein over a time course of 15 h was also observed (Heusipp et al., 1997a) . Alternatively, the increase in the detection of the 68-kDa protein at 24-32 h postinfection may reflect the genuine accumulation pattern of the protein in virusinfected cells at late stages of the viral replication cycle. If this were the case, it may indicate that the protein might also be involved in processes other than viral RNA replication.",

First, the two products may have certain functions during the viral replication cycle. The 160-kDa product is particularly interesting in this aspect, considering the fact that it contains both the polymerase and helicase domains and the 68-kDa helicase protein is undetectable at early stages of infection. It is plausible that the 160-kDa protein might have both polymerase and helicase functions in the replication of viral RNA at early stages of the infection. In fact, some smaller positive-stranded RNA viruses encode single proteins containing both the polymerase and helicase domains (Buck, 1996) . The second interesting question is why only these two intermediate cleavage products were detectable in IBV-infected cells. As shown in Fig. 4 as well as in our previous report , other intermediate cleavage products were also observed when this region was expressed in intact cells. One obvious distinct feature of the cleavage site between these two products is that it is a Q-G dipeptide bond, while all the other cleavage sites in this region of the polyprotein are Q-S dipeptide bonds (Fig. 1) . However, no experimental data indicate that cleavage at the Q-G site is more efficient than at the Q-S sites.",

It suggests that the 68-kDa protein may misfold when expressed in intact cells in the absence of other viral components. In recent years, it was found that the proper folding of certain proteins requires the assistance of molecular chaperones (Ellis and van der Vies, 1991; Gething and Sambrook, 1992) . As the 68-kDa protein may be a component of the viral RNA replication complex, the protein is expected to interact with viral RNA and other viral proteins. Those viral RNA/proteins may act as a chaperone for the correct folding of the 68-kDa protein in IBV-infected cells. It would be of interest to define if the region of the 30 amino acid residues that were shown to be responsible for the aberrant migration of the 68-kDa protein on SDS-PAGE contain either RNA binding or protein interacting domains.

This 592-bp fragment was then cloned into PvuII-and NcoI-digested pKT0, giving rise to pKT-CITE. The IBV sequence that codes for the 3C-like proteinase was obtained by digestion of pIBV3C (Liu et al., 1997) with BglII and BamHI and was cloned into BglII-digested pKT-CITE, giving rise to p3C-CITE. Digestion of p3C-CITE with NcoI produced a 1510-bp fragment containing both the IBV 3C-like proteinase and the IRES sequences. This fragment was then cloned into NcoI-digested pIBV1b8 and pIBV20, respectively, creating the two dicistronic constructs.

The regions used to raise anti-100, anti-68, anti-58, anti-39, and V17 and the positions of the identified Q-S(G) cleavage sites of the 3C-like proteinase are shown. The first amino acid position (M 1(1b) ) of the 1b region of the 1a/1b polyprotein was counted from the methionine residue encoded by nucleotides 12459 to 12461. Also shown are the positions of the 33-kDa 3C-like proteinase, the intermediate and mature cleavage products released from the 1b region, and the diagram of the two dicistronic constructs.",
