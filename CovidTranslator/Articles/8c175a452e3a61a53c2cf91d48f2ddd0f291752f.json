            "text": "Influenza A viruses caused annual outbreaks in humans and domestic animals. Three major influenza A pandemics were recorded during the 20 th century: the 1918-1919 \"Spanish flu\" representing the H1N1 influenza virus, the 1957-1958 \"Asian flu\" (H2N2), and the 1968-1969 \"Hong Kong flu\" (H3N2) [1] [2] [3] . The 1918-1919 pandemic caused the highest number of casualties: more than 500,000 people died in the USA, and more than 50 million people died worldwide [3] . The \"Asian flu\" in 1957-1958 caused about 70,000 deaths in the USA, and the \"Hong Kong flu\" in 1968-1969 caused about 34,000 deaths [1, 4] . Since 1997, different subtypes (H5N1, H7N7, and H9N2) of avian influenza viruses have been identified. Among them, the highly pathogenic H5N1 influenza viruses have severely affected to the poultry industry and posed a serious threat to human health, resulting in more than 50% fatality among more than 300 confirmed human cases [5] . The Influenza virus membranes contain two glycoproteins: haemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA). HA mediates cell-surface sialic acid receptor binding to initiate virus infection. After virus replication, NA removes sialic acid from virus and cellular glycoproteins to facilitate virus release and the spread of infection to new cell. The distinct antigenic properties of different haemagglutinin and neuraminidase molecules are used to classify influenza type A viruses into subtypes: 16 for HA (H1-H16) and 9 for NA (N1-N9) [2] . Because of the importance of this enzyme in the pathogenesis of influenza virus infection, it has been regarded as a drug target for finding new drugs for the treatment of influenza [5, 6] . The avian H5N1 viruses might eventually become capable of species barrier crossing and of effective human to human transmission [1, 4] .",

Over 4,000 varieties of flavonoids have been identified [7] . Flavonoids can act as potent antioxidants, display anti-inflammatory, antiallergic, antihemorrhagic, antimutagenic, antineoplastic, and hepatoprotective activities [7, 8] . There have some reports anti-influenza virus activities by inhibiting NA activity of several flavonoids compounds such as EGCG, EGC, and ECG against neuraminidase from A/H1N1, A/H3N2 and B virus [9] ; and 25 flavonoids (apigenin, catechin, epicatechin, luteolin, quercetin, rutin, etc) against neuraminidase from A/PR/8/34 (H1N1), A/ Jinan/15/90 (H3N2), and B/Jiangshu/10/2003 [10] . However, there has hitherto been no report on the strong inhibition activity of gallocatechin gallate (GCG) against NA from H5N1 influenza virus strain A/Vietnam/1203/04, or on the structure-activity relationship activity among the aforementioned flavonoid compounds against NA from H5N1. Herein, we report on the in vitro inhibition study using compounds belonging to four groups of flavonoids (flavonol, flavanonol, isoflavone, and flavan-3-ol) and gallic acid, against NA expression from Pichia pastoris X33 (P. pastoris X33) and the structure-activity relationship of them. The detailed mechanism of GCG inhibition was investigated by enzyme kinetic and molecular docking studies.",

The vector pJ201 bearing gene encoding neuraminidase from H5N1 influenza virus strain A/Vietnam/1203/04 (amino acid residues: 63 -449, GenBank accession no. AY818141) was constructed and optimized genetic codons based of yeast P. pastoris using a custom gene synthesis service (DNA 2.0, Menlo Park, USA). The NA gene was isolated from the vector pJ201 by cutting with EcoRI and NotI and ligated into the EcoRI/NotI digested pPICZ\u03b1A vector (pNA). This construct allows secretion of the neuraminidase into culture medium with in-frame Nterminal \u03b1-factor secretion signal and the C-terminal peptide containing the c-myc epitope and the polyhistidine tag. The resulting construct, pNA, was used to transform E. coli DH5\u03b1 using a standard heat shock method. Transformants harbouring pNA were selected from LB agar low salt medium (1% w/v tryptone, 0.5% w/v yeast extract, 0.5% NaCl, pH 7.5) containing 25 \u00b5g/mL Zeocin TM . Plasmid pNA was amplified in E. coli DH5\u03b1 and was linearized by SacI digestion and transformed into P. pastoris X-33 by modified lithium chloride methods [11] . Screening for positive clones was done by PCR method with two sets of primers: set one contained NA primers and set two contained \u03b1-factor and 3AOX1 primers. The PCR were conducted by using PCRmix (Bioneer, Daejeon, Korea) with thermal cycling of 95 o C for 5 min, followed by 25 cycles of 95 o C for 1 min, 55 o C for 1 min, 72 o C for 1 min 20 sec with final step of 72 o C for 7 min and the PCR product was analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis.",

The 1161 bp gene encoding for 387 amino acids residues (63 ~ 449) of NA from Influenza virus A/Vietnam/1203/2004 H5N1 was cloned into the pPICZ\u00e1A expression vector (pNA) and the pNA plasmid was linearized by SacI digestion that was further incorporated into the AOX1 locus of P. pastoris. A single clone was selected for expression; the recombinant NA was resolved electrophoretically as a band of approximately 45 kDa (Fig. 1A) . To confirm that the clone secreted NA, Western blotting (Fig. 1B) was performed using the anti-His antibody; NA was apparent as the same band upon SDS-PAGE. To calculate the kinetic parameters of NA, enzyme activity was analyzed with fluorescent substrate ranging from 5 to 60 \u00b5M (final concentration). The Linewaever-Burk plot showed linear line interception on the 1/v axis. The Michaelis-Menten constant K m derived from the Lineweaver-Burk plot was 9.96 \u00b1 0.26 \u00b5M (Fig. S1 ).",

The primarily inhibition activity results were showed in Table 1 . EGC and gallic acid inhibited 9.3 and 14.0% of NA activity. Ampelopsin inhibited 27.9% of NA activity while ampelopsin glucoside inhibited 58.2% of NA activity. Quercetin inhibited 35.2% of NA activity. ECG inhibited 36.7% of NA activity, EGCG inhibited 58.0%, and GCG inhibited 87.1% of NA activity. Among the tested compounds, GCG, the best inhibitor against NA with an IC 50 value of 8.98 \u00b1 0.46 \u00b5M, was used to analyze the mode of inhibition. For the analysis of the inhibition mode of GCG, both Lineweaver-Burk and Dixon plots were used. K i value was calculated from the Dixon plots using the SigmaPlot program. The inhibition of NA by GCG is illustrated in Fig. 2 . GCG exhibited competitive inhibition toward NA because the Lineweaver-Burk plot of 1/v versus 1/[S] resulted in a family of straight lines with the same y-axis intercept ( Fig. 2A) . The K i value of GCG was determined to be 8.34 \u00b1 0.25 \u00b5M, from the common x-axis intercept of lines on the corresponding Dixon plot (Fig. 2B ).",

The free binding energy of GCG was determined to be -13.71 kcal/mol. The binding between GCG and the active site pocket of NA is shown in Fig. 3A . To elucidate the interaction of NA with GCG, the potential hydrophobic and H-bonds interactions between amino acid residues at the active site of NA and GCG were investigated using the Ligplot program. [9] . However, comparison between EGCG and GCG, GCG (2S, 3R type), which is a C-2 epimeric isomer of EGCG (2R, 3R type) showed 1.5-times higher NA inhibitory activity than EGCG. Puerarin which lack the B-ring, showed higher inhibitory activity compared with ampelopsin and quercetin. Quercetin which lacks the 5'-OH group of B ring and contains 2, 3-double bonds showed a bit higher inhibitory activity compare with ampelopsin but ampelopsin glucoside showed higher inhibitory activity, 1.7 and 2.1-times, than quercetin and ampelopsin, respectively. The attached glucose at 4'-OH of B-ring enhanced NA inhibitory activity. EGC lacking the C(4)=O in the C-ring and galloy moiety group showed lowest inhibitory activity compared to that ampelopsin, quercetin, puerarin. C(4)=O in the C-ring is important to enhance inhibitory activity.",

Structural activity relationship of flavonoids compounds against NA EGC, ECG, ampelopsin, EGCG and GCG contain the same B-ring and the increasing order inhibitory activity was EGC < ampelopsin < EGCG < GCG. EGCG and GCG have a galloy moiety at the 3-OH position, displayed stronger NA inhibitory activity than EGC and ampelopsin. So gallic acid was used for in vitro assay, and it showed 14.0% inhibition activity against NA from H5N1 at 200 \u00b5M. These results were similar with previous report about potent inhibitors of influenza virus growth including A/H1N1, A/H3N2 and B virus in MDCK cells of EGCG, ECG, EGC and the results showed that galloy group at the 3-OH of catechin skeleton plays an important role on the observed antiviral activity",
