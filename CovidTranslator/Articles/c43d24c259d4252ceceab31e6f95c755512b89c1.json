The enormous genetic diversity of IBV poses difficulty in diagnosing and controlling the virus. To understand the nature of IBV prevalent in the Kashmir Himalayas, we characterized two field strains, isolated from non-immunized broiler chickens, by sequence and phylogenetic analysis of S1 subunit of the spike glycoprotein. The analysis revealed both the isolates are identical to each other, with nucleotide and amino acid sequence identities of 99.4% and 98.4%, respectively. They exhibit variable sequence divergence in the S1 gene to that of the reference serotypes. Both are of ''Massachusetts type'' belonging to GI-1 lineage of the IBV g\u00e9notype. The phylogenetic analysis revealed both of the isolates clustered into the same branch as that of many IBV strains recently reported from China and Iran. Likely, these regionally-related isolates represent revertant vaccine strains which may have been disseminated across the region by wild migratory birds. This study provides the first report of molecular evidence and phylogenetic characterization of the IBV from the Kashmir Himalayas and implicate the possible role of wild migratory birds in the spread of IBV in the region.",

            "text": "IBV, like most other RNA viruses, shows a huge genetic variation due to lack of proofreading activity by viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. This genetic heterogeneity allows IBV to quickly adapt to selection pressures from host immune responses leading to the emergence of new variants. Further, genetic recombinations can occur between two different IBV strains at certain ''hot spot'' regions of the genome resulting in distinct variants. The enormous diversity of IBV has led to its classification into serotypes, protectotypes, and genotypes. Currently genotyping, which is based on the sequence similarity between S1 subunit of the spike glycoprotein, is by far the most used system. The S1 subunit forms the globular head of the spike and mediates receptor binding during the virus entry into the host cell. S1 is the major determinant of protective immunity and carry most of the virus-neutralizing epitopes including serotype-specific epitopes. In fact, most of the variations in the virus have been mapped to three major hypervariable regions (HVRs) located within the N-terminal region of the S1protien. These HVRs lies between the amino acid residues 56-69 (HVR-1), 117-131 (HVR-2), and 274-387 (HVR-3) [11] . The domestic poultry is considered the primary host of IBV affecting all ages. The virus also has been isolated from other species such as pheasants, quail, patridge, geese, pigeon, guinea fowl, duck and peafowl. IBV or IBVlike coronaviruses has also been detected in wild aquatic birds [7, 12, 15] , implicating their role in the epidemiology of the IBV. Nevertheless, IBV has a major economical impact on commercial poultry chickens causing significant mortality, morbidity and production losses. The initial target of IBV is the epithelial cells of the respiratory tract, which is often followed by secondary infection of Escherichia coli, accentuating respiratory signs. Respiratory disease is most frequently observed syndrome caused by IBV in broiler chickens at 2-8 weeks of age [8] . The variations in S1 subunit can advance tissue tropism of IBV to several non-respiratory tissues, such as the gastrointestinal tract, the kidney, and the oviduct. Infection of the enteric tissues is usually not associated with clinical signs, while replication in the kidney might cause nephropathy with high mortality (up to 60%) in young chicks [2] . Oviductal infection can cause permanent damage in immature birds, and, in hens can lead to a reduction or cessation of egg-laying, production of thin-walled and misshapen shells with a loss of shell pigmentation [8] .",

The tree analysis was obtained from the whole S1 sequences (1593 bp) of the two IBV/ JKGBL strains along with the 32 prototype strains retrieved from the GenBank. Both the JKGBL01 and JKGBL02 clustered with sequence belonging to the Beaudette (accession number M95169) representing genotype I lineage 1 (GI-1). The sequences were aligned with Clustal W and the tree was build using MEGA7 software. The prototype strains are designated by the genotypes and lineages followed by the strain name and GenBank accession number in parenthesis as described by Valstro et al. [16] . The isolates sequenced in this study are highlighted in bold. The scale of the bar represents genetic divergence i.e. the number of nucleotide substitutions per site prototype strains and subjected them to analysis along with the S1 gene sequences of two IBV/JKGBL strains using the Neighbor-Joining method [13] in the MEGA7 software suite. The analysis revealed that both of the strains belong to Genotype I lineage 1 (GI-1) of IBV (Fig. 1) . The GI-1 lineage represents most widely distributed genotype throughout the world, more likely due to the extensive use of homologous vaccine strains. As the IBV vaccines are live attenuated, there are chances of pathogenic reversion due to back passaging if the vaccines are not applied properly. Although both the JKGBL strains originated from non-vaccinated broiler flocks, there are chances that they are revertant strains which may have originally evolved from the live attenuated vaccine strains used in the region.",

Thus, we retrieved complete S1 sequences of the IBV strains reported from surrounding countries including China, India, Iran, Ukraine and Russian Federation, and subjected them to the phylogenetic analysis along with our strains. The analysis also included the common vaccine strains used in the region. The analysis revealed that the JKGBL01 and JKGBL02 strains are more closely related to the IBV strains reported from China and Iran (Fig. 2) . The analysis also revealed that the two strains were more closely related to the ''Mass type'' vaccine strains, in particular H120 and H52. Since there is the least possibility of domestic birds moving between Kashmir Kashmir each year during September-October from Siberia, Central Asia, China and Indian sub-continent and leave back during March-April. The role of migratory birds in the dissemination of IBV has been highlighted in a study by Huges et al. [7] wherein they show avian coronavirus isolated from healthy migratory birds in England have a high degree of genetic identity with the IBV H120 vaccine strain. Similarly, coronaviruses sharing close proximity to the IBV H120 vaccine strain have also been detected in healthy, unvaccinated, domestic peafowl and as well as wild peafowl in China [10, 14] . In Kashmir, live and inactivated Mass type vaccines based on H120 strains are extensively used by poultry farmers for the control of IBV. The two JKGBL strains showed close proximity to the IBV H120 vaccine strain and therefore may represent a revertant attenuated vaccine strains that may have arisen as a result of the widespread use of IBV vaccines in the local poultry populations and have been further disseminated across the region by the wild migratory birds. To better understand the potential role of the wild migratory birds in the transmission, dissemination, and evolution of IBV strains, the surveillance of coronaviruses in the wild migratory birds across the region is warranted.",

The tree shows the relationships between the S1 gene sequence of two IBV/JKGBL (D) strains and the IBV strains from Asian-Indian migratory bird flyway including India (IN), Iran (IR), China (CH), Russian Federation (RF) and Ukraine (UKR) and the vaccine strains (shaded triangle) used in the region. The IBV/JKGBL strains clustered with the strains recently reported from China and Iran. The IBV/JKGBL strains show maximum identity with H120 and H52 strains, both of which are the 'Massachusetts type' vaccine strains. The tree was constructed by the neighborjoining method with 1000 bootstrap replicates in MEGA7 software. The regional strains were designated by the country of origin, and the strain name as in Genbank and acession number in paranthesis. The vaccine strains were designated by the strain name and GenBank accession number in paranthesis. The scale of the bar denotes the number of nucletode subustutions per site valley, China, and Iran due to the presence of long stretch of Himalayan Mountains and non-existent trade links, we hypothesize the role of wild migratory birds in the dissemination of the IBV strain across the region. The Kashmir valley forms a part of the Asian-migratory flyway with major birding sites at Hygam, Hokersar, Shalibug and Mirgund wetland reservoirs. The major migratory birds prevalent in Kashmir include Brahminy Duck, Tufted Duck, Gadwall, Garganey, Greylag Goose, Mallard, Common Merganser, Northern Pintail, Common Pochard, Ferruginous Pochard, Red-Crested Pochard, Ruddy Shelduck, Northern Shoveler, Common Teal, and Eurasian Wigeon.
