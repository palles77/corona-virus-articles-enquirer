Its specificity was confirmed when detergent-treated purified CV 777 showed a prominent reaction with FIPV antibodies in ELISA; no reaction was obtained with intact virions, which indicated common determinants on an internal component of the particle. Antigenic cross-reactions at the nucleocapsid level were found in Western blot ELISA performed both ways (CV 777/FIPV antibodies; FIPV/CV 777 antibodies). In immunoprecipitation using [35S]methionine labelled FIPV, anti-CV 777 sera recognized exclusively the nucleocapsid protein. The significance of these findings for the classification of coronaviruses is discussed.",

Recent studies from our laboratory have demonstrated that CV 777 is similar in this respect: it possesses a glycosylated surface protein of Mr 85,000 to 135,000, an envelope protein of Mr 20,000 to 32,000 and an unglycosylated RNA-binding protein of Mr 58,000 [5] .

Using I E M and IFT, an antigenic relationship between CV777 and several coronaviruses had not been found in a previous study [15] . In the present paper, the problem is re-examined with the aid of m o r e sensitive techniques such as immunoblotting and immunoprecipitation. As will be shown, CV 777 is indeed antigenically related to a coronavirus at the nucleocapsid level.",

Figure 1 shows the Western blot-ELISA of CV 777 proteins with homologous and heterologous antibodies. When homologous antiserum was used, prominent bands were seen at positions corresponding to Mr of 52,000 and 41,000; they probably relate to the RNAbinding protein of Mr 58,000 found in 15% gels [5] and its degradation product.

Using FIP ascitic fluid, a strong band with a calculated Mr of 43,000 and three additional bands between Mr 25,000 and 30,000 (representing the nucleocapsid and envelope proteins, respectively, of FIPV) [7, 8] can be seen. When an anti CV777 hyperimmune serum is used, a band is seen occupying the same place as the FIPV nucleocapsid protein. Porcine epdidemic diarrhea virus immune sera from Belgium and the Netherlands gave identical patterns (results not shown). The specificity of the reaction was confirmed by the empty appearance of the lanes where negative cat and pig serum had been used. No reaction was found at the nucleocapsid protein position when blots of a mock infected N L F K cell lysate had been incubated with anti-CV 777 antibodies. Immunoblotting would not detect reactions with conformation-dependent antigenic determinants. To show the reaction between homologous or heterologous antibodies and FIPV antigens under non-denaturing condition, immunoprecipitation was employed using [35S]methionine labelled infected and non-infected cell lysates. The inverse experiment was not performed since CV 777 virus cannot be grown and labelled in culture. As shown in figure 3 , results of the RIP confirmed the cross-reaction between pig anti-CV 777 sera and the 43,000 protein of FIPV found in Western blots; the homologous reaction reveals the typical pattern of FIPV structural polypeptides with Mr of 210,000 (peplomer), 45,000 (nucleocapsid) and 25,000 to 32,000 (envelope).

Characteristics of the viral structural polypeptides supported this taxonomic proposal [5] . We now present evidence for an antigenic relatedness between CV 777 and FIPV which provides a decisive argument in favor of the classification of CV 777 as a coronavirus: in Figs. 1 to 3 , a two-way cross reaction is shown between the nucleocapsid At the present time, coronaviruses are assigned to four antigenic clusters. In 1978, Pedersen et al. studied eight mammalian coronaviruses and established two groups on the basis of cross-reactivities by immunofluorescence; the authors found that viruses within one group were antigenically unrelated to members of the second group [13] . We have confirmed the finding of cross reactions within one group, namely between transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) of swine, FIPV and canine enteric coronavirus, and showed that common determinants are present on all three structural polypeptides [7] . Surprisingly, another study at the virion subunit level revealed an antigenic relatedness between mouse hepatitis virus type 3 (MHV) and human coronavirus (HCV) 229 E which had been assigned to different clusters [6-1. Also, the HCV 229 E nucleocapsid protein can be detected by antisera directed against TGE, MHV and hemagglutinating encehalomyelitis virus (HEV) of swine [-21]. We have obtained preliminary evidence in immunoblotting assays that MHV strain A 59 and avian infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) strain M41 cross-react at the nucleoprotein level [Niesters 1986, unpublished observations], as do also FIPV and HEV [Yaling 1987, unpublished observations]. These observations, together with the finding that amino acid sequences are conserved between coronaviruses from different antigenic clusters [3] , indicate that common antigenic determinants may exist which are suitable for the identification of many, if not all, members of the family. 70 Zhou Yaling et al.",

Using ELISA, immunoblotting and RIP in the present study, however, we did find a cross reaction of CV 777 with FIPV. Upon re-examination, a reaction was also seen by IFT, which--when assessed by itself--would have appeared too weak to be considered as specific. Several explanations can be offered for the discrepancies obtained with the different techniques. The selected polyclonal antiserum may be crucial. It has been demonstrated that, e.g., FIP ascitic fluids may lack antibodies against one or two of the three viral proteins [8] . Since a cross reaction may exist at the level of only one of them--as found in this study--the antigenic relationship may thus escape detection. Cross-reactivities may vary with different serological variants of the viruses compared (e.g., M H V and HCV); the existence of antigenic differences between FIP viruses should also be taken into account [12, 13] . Due to its low sensitivity, the fluorescent antibody technique is not ideal for the examination of viral cross reactivities and contradictory results have indeed been obtained [1, 13, 15, 20] . In view of the high frequency of mutation and recombination of coronaviruses, the establishment of antigenic clusters within the family may be of only limited value.",
