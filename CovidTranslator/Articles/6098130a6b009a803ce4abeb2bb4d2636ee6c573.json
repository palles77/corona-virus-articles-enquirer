In this study, we investigated the role of autophagy on hepatitis C virus (HCV) RNA replication and demonstrated anti-HCV effects of an autophagic proteolysis inhibitor, chloroquine. Methods Induction of autophagy was evaluated following the transfection of HCV replicon to Huh-7 cells. Next, we investigated the replication of HCV subgenomic replicon in response to treatment with lysosomal protease inhibitors or pharmacological autophagy inhibitor. The effect on HCV replication was analyzed after transfection with siRNA of ATG5, ATG7 and light-chain (LC)-3 to replicon cells. The antiviral effect of chloroquine and/or interferona (IFNa) was evaluated.",

Silencing of autophagy-related genes by siRNA transfection significantly blunted the replication of HCV replicon. Treatment of replicon cells with chloroquine suppressed the replication of the HCV replicon in a dosedependent manner. Furthermore, combination treatment of chloroquine to IFNa enhanced the antiviral effect of IFNa and prevented re-propagation of HCV replicon. Protein kinase R was activated in cells treated with IFNa but not with chloroquine. Incubation with chloroquine decreased degradation of long-lived protein leucine.",

While cellular autophagy is thought to be in preparation for the turnover and recycling of cellular constituents [6] [7] [8] , this process has been proposed as a mechanism of virus replication complex formation in positive-stranded RNA viruses including poliovirus, equine arteritis virus and coronavirus [9] [10] [11] [12] . In these viruses, the replication complexes consist of double membrane vesicles in the cytoplasm, suggestive of an autophagosome origin [9, 12] . Recently, it was reported that transfection of HCV replicon induced autophagy [11] . Additionally, Sir et al. [13] demonstrated that the suppression of autophagy inhibited the replication of HCV. These findings suggested that the autophagy plays a pivotal role in HCV replication.",

Double membrane vesicles with the morphology of autophagosomes were identified at 2.3 vacuoles/cells in na\u00efve Huh-7 cells, while transfection of HCV replicon increased the number of vacuoles to about fourfold over untransfected Huh-7 cells (Fig. 1a, b) . Subsequent treatment of the cells with IFNa (100 U/ml) for 14 days to eliminate HCV replicon substantially decreased the autophagolysosome in cytoplasm of Huh7/Rep-Feo cells (Fig. 1a, b) . These observations suggested that HCV replicon induces formation of autophagosomes. To clarify the role of autophagy on the replication of HCV, Huh7/ Rep-Feo cells were treated with 3-methyladenine (10 mM) or a mixture of E64d (10 lg/ml) and pepstatin A (10 lg/ml) which inhibited autophagic protein degradation. Replication level of HCV replicon in cells was increased to about twofold after 18 h in control media, however incubation with 3-methyladenine completely blunted increases in replication of HCV replicon. Treatment with 3-methyladenine decreased the number of autophagosomes to about 19% of Huh7/Rep-Feo cells. Furthermore co-incubation with E64d and pepstatin A decreased replication of HCV replicon to about 66% of control (Fig. 2a) . Next, WST-1 assay was performed to check the cytotoxicity of these drugs. Treatment with 3-methyladenine or a mixture of Fig. 2 Inhibition of autophagy suppressed replication of HCV replicon. a Cells were treated with 3-methyladenine (3-MA) (10 mM) or a mixture of E64d (1 lg/ml) and pepstatin A (Pep) (1 lg/ml) for 18 h, the levels of replication of HCV replicon were assessed by luciferase assay. b Cells were treated with 3-methyladenine (10 mM), mixture of E64d (1 lg/ml) and pepstatin A (1 lg/ml) for 18 h.

Forty-eight hours after transfection, levels of HCV replication were analyzed by luciferase assay E64d and pepstatin A did not affect cell viability (Fig. 2b) . To clarify the role of autophagy induction in the replication of HCV, we suppressed the induction of autophagy by silencing autophagy-related genes (ATG5, ATG7, LC-3a and LC-3b) by siRNA transfection. Silencing of autophagy-related genes reduced the replication of HCV replicon to about 70% of control (Fig. 2c) . Transfection with siRNA of autophagy related genes decreased the number of autophagosomes to about 30% of control. These results indicated that autophagy plays a pivotal role in replication of HCV.",

Next, cytotoxicity of chloroquine was analysed by WST-1 assays. Huh7/Rep-Feo cells treated with chloroquine showed no significant effect on cell viability in doses of lower than 10 -5 M (Fig. 3b) . However, incubation with 10 -4 M of chloroquine reduced the cell viability to 25% of control. On the basis of the toxicity curve, the IC 50 of the drug was calculated to be 3.6 9 10 -5 M (Fig. 3c) . The average EC 50 of chloroquine was calculated as 2.2 9 10 -7 M (Fig. 3c) . The replication of HCV replicon was suppressed to nearly 40% of control at 10 -5 M of chloroquine, which did not affect cell viability. These data indicated that chloroquine efficiently inhibited the replication of HCV replicon in the absence of toxic effect to cells at the concentration of 10 -5 M. Accordingly, we used 10 -5 M of chloroquine for the following study.",

Ultrastructural analysis identified 0.94 \u00b1 0.1 vacuoles/100 lm 2 of autolysosomes in control cells; however, treatment with chloroquine increased the number of autolysosomes dramatically to about 13-fold over control (Fig. 5b) . Furthermore, the molecular form of LC3 protein of the cells, which is a component of autophagosomes, was examined by western blot analysis to ensure that chloroquine treatment leads to the accumulation of autophagosomes and autolysosomes. As shown in Fig. 5c , immunopositive protein bands for LC3-I and LC3-II forms were clearly evident in control cells. After chloroquine treatment, LC3-II expression increased at 4 h (Fig. 5c) to about threefold over control without enhancing LC3-I expression, and at 8 h (Fig. 5c ) LC3-II expression was further enhanced.

We found that the inhibition of autophagosome formation and autophagic proteolysis blunt the replication of genotype 1b subgenomic HCV replicon (Fig. 2a, c) . Sir et al.

However, treatment with both chloroquine and the mixture of E64d and pepstatin induced the accumulation of autophagosomes in cytoplasm. Therefore, it is likely that HCV does not utilize the double membrane structure as the localization of the viral replication formation. These results support the hypothesis that protein degradation due to autophagy is important for HCV replication. Chloroquine is a well-known inhibitor of autophagic protein degradation and is often used as an anti-malarial agent. Moreover, the anti-viral effect of chloroquine on other RNA viruses has been already reported in clinical trials [15, 16] . In our results, chloroquine inhibits the intracellular replication of an HCV replicon in a dosedependent manner (Fig. 3a) . This antiviral effect of chloroquine was clearly not due to cytotoxic effects (Fig. 3b) . Moreover, chloroquine possesses a synergistic effect with IFNa on HCV replication (Fig. 4a) . Although IFNa possesses strong anti-HCV effects, re-propagation of HCV replicon was observed after 3 weeks following 7 days of treatment with IFNa. Interestingly, co-incubation with IFNa and chloroquine for 7 days prevented repropagation of HCV replicon (Fig. 4b) . Chloroquine is a lysosomal weak base that is known to affect acid vesicles leading to dysfunction of several proteins [29] . It was demonstrated that disruption of lysosomal function impairs maturation of viruses through inhibiting the low-pH dependent proteases in trans-Golgi vesicles in HIV and the SARS coronavirus infection in vitro [15, 29] . However, little is understood about the mechanism of its antiviral effect. In previous reports, various drugs which possess inhibitory effects on the replication of HCV and have a synergistic action with IFNa have been proposed as new therapeutic agents to treat HCV. Some of them have proved to exhibit their anti-HCV effects through augmentation of IFN-induced antiviral gene responses [30, 31] . However, the anti-HCV effect of chloroquine was not associated with activation of one of IFN receptors signaling molecule PKR (Fig. 5a) . Our results showed chloroquine induced the accumulation of ineffective autophagosomes in cytoplasm of Huh7/Rep-Feo cells (Fig. 5b) and inhibited the degradation of long-lived protein leucine (Fig. 6) . These findings imply that chloroquine effectively impairs the function of autophagy in our experiment. These results indicated that chloroquine is a new anti-HCV agent that targets the autophagic proteolysis.",

            "text": "Previous reports have shown that chloroquine possesses anti-viral effects on various RNA viruses. Its beststudied effects are those against HIV replication, which are being tested in clinical trials [17, 18] . HCV coinfection is common in HIV-positive patients in USA and Europe [32, 33] . Since HIV infection accelerates the progression of HCV-related liver disease, treatment of HCV is generally recommended. However, co-infected patients have a greater risk of antiretroviral therapy-associated hepatotoxicity than patients with HIV only [34] . Moreover, treatment with ribavirin is believed to increase the risk of anemia in patients taking the HIV drug zidovudine [35] . A clinical study designed for HIV patients showed the safety and efficacy of chloroquine used for long terms up to 48 weeks [36] . Therefore, the combination therapy of interferon and chloroquine is, possibly, a hopeful therapy for HCV-HIV co-infected patients. Since chloroquine is known as one of the inexpensive drugs, therefore, chloroquine might provide a new effective, safe and economical therapeutic option for patients with HCV. In conclusion, autophagic proteolysis might be a new therapeutic target on the replication of HCV.",
