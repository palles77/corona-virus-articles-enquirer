Compared to the IgM testing, the IgG 26 testing was more reliable in which it identified 65 SARS-CoV-2 infections from the 79 confirmed 27 patients and only two false-positive cases from the 80 control group with a sensitivity and specificity 28 reaching 82.28% and 97.5%, respectively. However, only a slight difference (not statistically 29 significant) in the detected cases of SARS-CoV-2 infections was observed between the IgM and IgG 30 testing manner in patients at a different time of onset of disease. A performance comparison 31 between an ELISA kit using the same nucleocapsid antigen and our chemiluminescence method was 32 undertaken. The same false-positive cases were seen in both methods from the paired control group, 33 while ELISA kit can only detect half of the SARS-CoV-2 infections from paired SARS-CoV-2 confirmed 34 patients group than that of the chemiluminescence method, indicating a higher performance for the 35 chemiluminescence-immunoassay approach.

Prior to December 2019, a total of six coronaviruses have been documented to be capable of 45 causing disease in humans. These include two strains from Alphacoronavirus (HCoV-229E and HKU-46 NL63) and four from Betacoronavirus subfamily (HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV) 47 (5-10). Among them, the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East 48 Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) are the most well-described as they directly led to two 49 deadly large-scale outbreaks globally, with 8,096 cases infections and roughly 10 percent mortality 50 and 2,494 cases and 34.4 percent mortality, respectively(9, 10). 51 Recently, the outbreak of a severe pneumonia COVID-19 was confirmed to be caused by the 2019 52 novel coronavirus infections (SARS-CoV-2) that was originated from a seafood wholesale market in 53 Wuhan, China(11). So far, this novel coronavirus has spread throughout the whole of China and over 54 198 countries globally, causing over468,905 laboratory-confirmed cases of infections with 21,200 55 people dead posing a great threat to the global public health (http://2019ncov.chinacdc.cn/2019-nCov/). 56 Besides, there are still numerous suspected cases and a myriad of medical monitoring people who 57 were quarantined in specialized hospitals or at homes because of their previous epidemiological link 58 to confirmed SARS-CoV-2 patients. All of these put an extreme burden on the emergency, hospital 59 and public health system particularly the epidemic zone worldwide. Therefore, a timely, sensitive and 60 accurate diagnosis approach is urgently needed and of pivotal importance for surveillances of disease 61 dissemination and the prevention of further expansions. Conventional diagnosis methods such as 62 virus culture and microscopic analysis are generally time-consuming and labor-intensive with limited 63 sensitivity (12, 13).

Magnetic beads Magnosphere\u2122 MS300 used in this study are 106 commercially available in the JSR Corporation, Tokyo, Japan. Recombinant nucleocapsid antigens 107 were coupled to these tosyl magnetic beads using the catalytic reagent solution (3M Ammonium 108 sulfate / 0.1M Borate buffer, pH9.5) according to the manufacture's instruction, and the resultant 109 beads were further blocked by 0.05% BSA for six hours at 37 \u00b0C. The following testing and detection 110 procedure was automated on a chemical immuno-luminescence analyzer ACCRE6 (Tianshen Tech, 111 Shenzhen, China). It was comprised of those following steps. 50 microliter pure serum was firstly 112 incubated with the magnetic beads that were coupled with antigens for 5 minutes at 37 \u00b0C. 113 Subsequently, the unbound substance was gently removed and then washed by Tris buffer for three 114 times. Alkaline phosphatase labeled anti-human immunoglobulin (50\u00b5g/ml) was added and further 115 incubated for 5 minutes at 37 \u00b0C in the Mes Buffer. After three times washing to remove unbound 116 materials, the lumigen APS-5 substrate (50ug/ml) was eventually added. Ultimately, the light signal 117 was measured by the photomultiplier in ACCRE6 (Tianshen Tech, Shenzhen, China) as relative light 118 units, and the whole testing can be completed in 23 minutes. Confirmed SARS-CoV-2 positive-serum 119 and negative-serum were used as controls in each set test.

A close examination of their medical record reveals that all of them had 210 previous contact with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 individuals in at least 16 days ago, pointing to the 211 possibility that they were probably asymptomatically infected by SARS-CoV-2 for certain time already. 212 Fourteen cases (17.7%) from 79 SARS-CoV-2 confirmed patients were not identified by our serological 213 testing method (both the IgM and IgG manner). Interestingly, of them, seven people were younger 214 than 8-year-old or over 70-year-old.

Twenty-nine healthy people were recruited from the Shenzhen 81 University aging from 16 to 72 years old.

Nevertheless, a relatively low 191 sensitivity (30%-50%) in single upper respiratory specimen testing has been commonly reported 192 including the well-appreciated methods for SARS-CoV detections (20). Furthermore, since the SARS-193 CoV-2 expansion from 2020 January, several cases reported that consecutive negative detections of 194 SARS-CoV-2 RNA were observed for upper respiratory specimens testing like throat swabs in patients 195 with apparent clinical symptoms, and the positive results can only be achieved by collecting the 196 bronchoalveolar lavage fluid for re-testing.
