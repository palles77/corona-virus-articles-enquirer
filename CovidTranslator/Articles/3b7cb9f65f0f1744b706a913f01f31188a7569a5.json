MBP-selected CD4 \u00f7 T cell lines both from measles-infected animals as well as from rats challenged with guinea pig MBP (Gp-MBP) had a similar pattern of response in the presence of synthetic peptides to Gp-MBP and specifically responded in vitro only to the encephalitogenic and not the non-encephalitogenic or other control peptides. In primary splenic lymphocyte cultures from SAME animals, however, a low but significant T-cell response was obtained against the non-encephalitogenic peptide $67 (residues 69-81) of the Gp-MBP. Moreover, immunization of MV-infected rats with this peptide induced clinical and histological experimental allergic encephalomyelitis (EAE) in 38% of the animals. The results of the study show that the non-encephalitogenic peptide $67 can be rendered encephalitogenic in rats when an additional stimulus is given in the form of MV infection. The data indicate further that MV infection of the central nervous system (CNS) enhances the susceptibility of the CNS to autoimmune T cell aggression.",

By using a panel of synthetic peptides covering this Gp-MBP encephalitogenic region it was found that the fine specificity was identical in SAME and EAE-derived MBP-specific T cell fines. We further observed that measles virus (MV)-infected rats immunized with a non-encephafitogenic peptide of Gp-MBP developed EAE. These experiments indicate that MV infection of the CNS may not only lead to the generation and/or expansion of encephalitogenic MBP-specific CD4 + lymphocytes, but also may convert a non-pathologic CMAI to an encephalitogenic one. A combination of these two processes may contribute to a virus-induced immunopathological process within the CNS.",

From rats developing a SAME 4-8 weeks after infection, splenic lymphocytes were cultured during the disease period or within 3 weeks after clinical recovery.

The clinical severity of actively or passively induced EAE was assessed using a scale of 0-5 (Lassmann, 1983) .

Details of their phenotypic and functional characteristics have been published (Liebert et al., 1988) . The membrane phenotype was CD4 \u00f7, CD8-, and activated line lymphoblasts induced EAE-like lesions when adoptively transferred into naive syngeneic recipients. In addition, five MBP-specific T cell lines were obtained from Lewis rats with EAE which revealed the same properties as those derived from SAME rats. To determine the fine specificity of these autoreactive T cell lines a panel of synthetic peptides summarized in Table 1 was used in lymphocyte proliferation assays. As shown in previous studies, the peptides of the Gp-MBP designated $49 and $55 are encephalitogenic in Lewis rats whereas the peptides $53 and $67 are non-encephalitogenic (Offner et al., 1987) . 141 After the third or fourth in vitro restimulation, the T cell lines included in this study were highly MBP-specific and exhibited a significant lymphoproliferation (LPR) when purified MBP or peptides $49 and $55 were added to the cultures (Tables 2 and 3 ). The positive stimulation was obtained with MBP-selected T cells of SAME as well as EAE origin, and the pattern of reactivity against the different peptides was almost identical for the cell lines of both diseases. The stimulation indices (SI) varied to some extent between the individual cell lines. Higher SI were generally obtained with cells of EAE origin, but the range of the SI was overlapping with that seen with cell lines isolated from SAME animals. No significant LPR was observed upon the addition of the nonencephalitogenic peptides $53 and $67, and the cell lines did not proliferate in the presence of irrelevant antigens such as PLP, purified protein derivative (PPD) and MV and were thus antigenspecific. Furthermore, T cell lines with specificity for MV (SAME4-MV and SAME5-MV, Table 2 ) did not proliferate in the presence of Gp-MBP or its peptides.",

Therefore, the observation in SAME rats of a reactivity with peptide $67 led us to a set of experiments to define the role of MV infection in inducing the autoimmune response against this non-encephalitogenic peptide. For these experiments a dose of MV (103 TCIDs0 (tissue culture infectious dose) of CAM/RBH) was chosen that failed to induce a clinically recognizable subacute CNS disease in animals. Histologically, these rats did not reveal changes indicative of an encephalitic disease process when examined 28-42 days post-infection. Moreover, neither infectious virus could be isolated from nor MV antigen was demonstrable in brain tissue of these animals. However, in serum and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), low titers of neutralizing anti-measles antibodies were detected (in the range of 1 : 50 in serum and 1 : 10 in CSF) documenting the interaction of the host immune system with the infecting virus.",

This high degree of antigenic specificity is further supported by the failure of all these T cell lines to proliferate in the presence of MV particles, MV antigens and other control antigens or peptide sequences.

An additional reaction to the non-encephalitogenic $67 peptide was found in some rats but not to the other peptides included in this study. This observation is in line with perviously published results (Mannie et al., 1985) . Although the SI appear low compared to the reaction obtained from regional lymph nodes after adjuvant-aided immunization with autoantigens, the values for thymidine incorporation in presence of the $67 peptide of animals Nos. B733 and B745 clearly differ from the naive controls (Table 4 ). It has also to be remembered that we looked at a non-preselected population of splenic lymphocytes with many specificities and that no stimulus to the immune system other than the viral infection was 145 given. In such a situation it is known that antigen-specific lymphoproliferation is always low also in viral antigens (B. Askonas, personal communication). Nonetheless, from two spleen cell cultures from SAME rats, CD4 \u00f7 T cell lines with specificity for the $67 peptide could be isolated (data not shown). Although autoreactive T cell lines can be isolated occasionally from naive rats this requires sophisticated methods that were not used in the present study (Schluesener and Wekerle, 1985) . Unlike $49, the peptide $67 is not sufficient to induce EAE unless a concomitant immune response occurs against non-encephalitogenic peptide $53. As recently shown, this response is of a humoral nature whereas peptide $67 predominantly induces a T cell reaction (Hashim et al., 1988) . Surprisingly, the immune responses to $67 peptide immunization and MV infection act synergistically in the induction of EAE sinailady as immunization with both peptides $67 and $53. This phenomenon was not observed when rats were infected intraperitoneally or were preimmunized with inactivated measles virus, indicating that MV replication in brain cells is probably a prerequisite for a CNS autoimmune reaction to occur in this system.",

In the case of the experiments reported here where MV-infected Lewis rats were immunized with peptide $67, the MV infection could have generated a humoral immune response that leads to antibodies which interact with MBP. So far, preliminary attempts to detect antibodies against peptide $53 in the animal model have been unsuccessful. However, one also has to keep in mind that more than one encephalitogenic sequence may be expressed on the MBP molecule. For human MBP-specific T cells, for example, as many as ten potential T cell epitopes have been found by comparative proliferation with MBP and its fragments from different species that show limited amino acid sequence differences (Richert et al., 1989) . Furthermore, it has been shown that the T cell repertoire for rat MBP includes encephalitogenic clones with reactivity to non-69-84 determinants (Happ and Heber-Katz, 1988) . A minor I-E-restricted sequence encephalitogenic for the Lewis rat was defined recently as peptide $87-99 of Gp-MBP (Offner et al., 1989) .",

To explain this phenomenon several possibilities exist. It is conceivable that virus-induced damage to CNS tissue facilitates the subsequent priming or clonal expansion of pre-existing myelin-reactive T cells for example, via the induction of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II on astrocytes (Massa et al., 1987) and efficient presentation of neural antigen by these cells (Fontana et al., 1984; Sun and Wekerle, 1986) . Additionally, in measles viral infection, alterations in the surface of infected cells occur potentially resulting in the exposure of cellular components together with the viral envelope proteins (Notkins et al., 1984) . Such exposure taking place in infected brain cells may lead to the development of immunity against fragments of MBP that usually do not elicit immunogenic responses. Moreover, changes in the integrity of the blood-brain barrier as a consequence of a viral infection of the brain may facilitate the entry of antigenspecific CD4 \u00f7 T cells to the CNS.",
