Also, data is still scarce -for instance, the number of cases that are currently undiagnosed cannot be yet known, and there are limited available accurate numbers of performed COVID-19 tests in many countries. Nevertheless, we have chosen a conservative approach, possibly underestimating hospitalizations costs -the daily costs of COVID-19 admissions are probably higher than those established for pneumonia. In addition, other relevant costs in the NHS perspective are not being considered, as they would be difficult to measure -because hospitals are being directed to treat COVID-19 infections, there can be postponed treatments, and drugs/technologies where COVID-19 patients may be given priority over other patients. Thus, real savings subsequent to large scale testing may be higher than those we presented, as we did not consider opportunity costs and indirect costs (e.g., productivity losses subsequent to admissions or quarantines).",

Value of diagnostics usually encompasses turnover time, and both regulators and industry promoters are addressing this topic as well [7] .
