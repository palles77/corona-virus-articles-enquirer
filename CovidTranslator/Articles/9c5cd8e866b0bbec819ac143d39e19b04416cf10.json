A total of 123 patients were analyzed for their Clinical records, laboratory results including the diagnosis of HBV infection and liver function. Among 123 confirmed COVID-19 patients, the mean age was 51 years old and 59.3% were females (73/123). Fifteen were previously HBV infected patients, 66.7% of them were males (10/15), patients with HBV infection appeared to have a higher incidence of liver cirrhosis and an increased level of total bilirubin. Seven (46.7%) patients with HBV infection were defined as severe cases, while the severity rate was 24.1% for the patients without HBV infection (26/108). The mortality of patients with HBV infection was 13.3% (2/15) compared to 2.8% (3/108) for the patients without HBV infection.",

According to the announcement of the World Health Organization (WHO), the disease has been officially named as Coronavirus Disease-2019 (COVID-19) (2). The etiology of the disease was identified to be a novel \u03b2-coronavirus, named as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) based on the phylogenetic relationship with SARS-CoV. On March 11, 2020, WHO declared the outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 as a pandemic.

A recent research has demonstrated that SARS-CoV-2 infection was associated with live function damage in . Taking consideration of large group of people with HBV infection, the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection on patients with HBV infection requires a further assessment in order to design the specific treatment strategy. However, the impacts of SARS-CoV-2 infection on HBV patients are still not clear. For example, we do not yet know whether the SARS-CoV-2 infection is more severe in HBV patients and we also do not have much knowledge about the impact of SARS-CoV-2 on the course of HBV infection. In this retrospective study, we discovered that the liver impairment is a common feature in COVID-19 patients and as high as 46.7% patients with HBV infection develop to severe situation during the course of SARS-CoV-2 infection. This suggests that patients with HBV infection might be vulnerable group to SARS-CoV-2 infection.",
