            "text": "THOUGH the boundary region between the ER and the Golgi complex has been extensively investigated during the past few years, many questions remain about the organization of this part of the cell. Foremost among these is whether a separate intermediate compartment exists or whether this structure is functionally continuous with the ER. The available evidence strongly suggests that both in mammalian cells (Beckers et al., 1990) and in yeast (Rexach and Schekman, 1991) at least one vesicular transport step exists between the rough ER and the Golgi complex. A separate intermediate compartment, as has been postulated by several authors (Warren, 1987; Pelham, 1989; MeUman and Simons, 1992) would necessitate two distinct vesicular transport steps, one from the ER to the intermediate compartment and the other from this site to Golgi. In contrast, if the intermediate compartment is continuous with the ER, transport to the Golgi complex would require a single vesicular transport step. This region between the ER and the Golgi has been given a number of different names, including the salvage compartment (Warren, 1987) , the cis-Golgi network (CGN; Duden et al., 1991b; Mellman and Simons, 1992) , the ER-Golgi intermediate compartment (ERGIC; Hauri and Schweizer, 1992) and the \"budding compartment\" for coronaviruses (Tooze et al., 1988; Griffiths and Rottier, 1992) .",

In the case of the avian infectious bronchitis virus the M (previously referred to as El) protein of the virus, when expressed by itself, localizes to the region of the ER/cis-Golgi boundary (Machamer et al., 1990) . For another coronavirus, mouse hepatitis virus (MHV),~ which has been studied extensively at the EM level (Tooze et al., 1984 (Tooze et al., , 1988 Tooze and Tooze, 1985) , the situation is more complex. In this case the M protein of the virus, when expressed by itself localizes to late Golgi elements including the trans-Golgi network (TGN; Krijnse-Locker et al., 1992a) . Our present working model to rationalize the difference in localization of the M protein of MHV in infected cells (the bulk in pre-Golgi structures) and when expressed independently (the bulk in late Golgi) is that in infected ceUs the M protein is retained at the site of budding by an interaction with the second membrane protein, the spike (S) protein, as well as possibly with the viral nucleocapsid (Griffiths and Rottier, 1992) .",

The use of thawed cryosections enabled us to localize both the binding of a GalNAc-specific lectin as well as two markers of the intermediate compartment, p58 and the small GTPase tab2. In a complementary biochemical approach, using intact cells as well as SLO permeabilization, we investigated the conditions required for the M protein to acquire, first, GalNAc, and second, the Golgi modifications. Collectively, our data are consistent with a model whereby a single vesicular transport step would mediate traffic between the ER and the Golgi complex.",

Our data fully support and extend the observations made previously by Tooze et al. (1988) . As shown in Fig. 2 , images were found showing direct membrane continuities between the viral budding compartment and the rough ER. The budding region was also continuous with a cisternal element on one side of the Golgi stack. The architecture of the ER-Golgi boundary was much easier to appreciate in cytosol-depleted L cells that had been permeabilized with the pore forming toxin streptolysin O. Under these conditions the contrast of the membranes was visibly increased. The images in Figs. 3 and 4 indicate that the structure where MHV buds is directly continuous with the rough ER, the nuclear envelope and with cisternal elements on one side of the Golgi stack. In agreement with Tooze et al. (1984) , we could also find small amounts of virus budding into the rough ER, even at relatively early times, 6 h of infection ( Fig. 3 E) . The continuities between these structures became even more obvious when we carried out an analysis of serial sections (Fig. 5 ). In all these preparations the membranes of the rough ER (Figs. 3, A and D and 5) as well as the structures containing the budding virions were in direct continuity with approximately 30-nm wide membrane tubules. These tubules also appeared to contact the nuclear envelope; in oblique sections some images suggested that these tubules were attached to the nuclear pores ( Fig. 4 B) . Similar tubules were seen in our recent study on vaccinia virus infected cells (Sodeik et al., 1993) . The membranes of the budding compartment were also continuous with distinct electron-dense, tubular-cisternal structures (Fig. 3 A) . Such structures are occasionally seen in uninfected cells (not shown) but are far more prominent in MHV infected cells. They are very similar to the structures described by Hobman et al.

Again, after SLO permeabilization the structures containing the product of the glucose 6 phosphatase reaction were better visualized, especially the fine tubules in the perinuclear region. In general, the reaction product was equally patchy in the rough ER, nuclear en-velope and around the budding and budded virions (Fig. 6 ). The lumen of the compartment surrounding some virions reacted strongly while others were devoid of reaction product. This probably reflects a technical limitation of the method. The fine tubules in continuity with cisternal elements (presumably on the cis side of the Golgi) were also partially reactive (Fig. 6 , A and C). As shown in Fig. 6 , A and C the reaction product around the virions could often be seen to be continuous with the reaction in some Golgi cisternae. These tubules, as before, appeared to contact the nuclear envelope: some spotty reaction product occasionally extended into these tubules, at least their peripheral parts (Fig. 6 B) . cell.

Our studies, both with and without SLO treatment, confirm these findings and importantly, showed that the rough ER was essentially devoid of labeling in infected L cells (as well as in other cells, not shown). Since M is the major protein made upon infection this observation suggests that, at steady state no significant amount of GalNAc-containing M protein has recycled back to the rough ER. The tubular membranes containing the budding and budded virus were significantly labeled with HPA (Fig. 7, A-D). There was also some labeling of the Golgi stack, the plasma membrane as well as structures we believe to be endocytic organeUes (not shown).

In C, the section was double labeled with B-cop (10 nm gold) and Helix pomatia (HPA, 6 nm gold, small arrows).

These data confirmed that both the rough ER/nuclear envelope and the structures where MHV buds are enriched in PDI. The amount of label over the ribosome-containing membranes was about twice as high as over the budding compartment (Table I) . This difference should be interpreted with caution however, since the labeling efficiency may be different over the different structures (Griffiths, 1993) . Since we used GTPTS in many experiments in this study we also investigated whether this drug had any quantitative effect on the labeling of PDI.

The maturation of the O-linked oligosaccharides of the M protein follows a distinct pattern; in pulse-chase studies up to five different forms of the M protein appear sequentially and can be resolved on SDS gels (see Fig. 13 A) . To be able to relate the results obtained in earlier studies using sac(-) ceils with the L cells preferred for the morphological experiments in the present study, we compared the pattern of O-glycosylation of the M protein in both cells (Fig. 13 B) . To visualize the different forms of the M protein, cells were labeled at 5 h after infection continuously for 3 h, with [35S]methionine. In agreement with earlier data (Tooze et al., 1988; Krijnse-Locker et al., 1992a) in sac(-) cells five different forms were apparent (see Fig. 13 A for a summary). In L ceils the pattern of O-glycosylation was slightly different. The M5 form appeared to be absent while the M~ and M3 bands were more pronounced. The identity of the M protein bands in L cells was confirmed using biotinylated lectins. When we used Helix pomatia, which recognizes GalNAc, to detect the M protein, the Mt form was clearly enriched (Fig. 13 B) . The lectin also precipitated some of the M3 form, but not M0 and M4. In contrast, wheat germ agglutinin (WGA) preferentially recognized the M3 and M4 forms, consistent with the notion that this lectin is specific for SA (as well as for N-acetyl-glucosamine, which is probably not present in the M protein). The specificity of HPA was confirmed by adding 10 mM GalNAc at the start of the lectin incubation, which caused the disappearance of both the M~ and M3 bands, while GalNAc had no such effect on the WGA precipitation.",

Adding ATP or UDP-GalNAc alone made this conversion less efficient. In the absence of cytosol the addition of GTP~,S did not block the acquisition of GalNAc, although the Golgi modifications were absent. Finally, in the absence of cytosol but with GTP~S and ATP, the acquisition of GalNAc was facilitated by the addition of the sugar precursor UDP-GalNAc.

It is important to note that, whereas the fine structure of the MHV budding compartment may be altered by the infection, the same structure can be seen in uninfected cells. Thus, Tooze et al. (1988) carried out an extensive serial section analysis of uninfected sac(-) cells and described irregular tubular-cisternal elements reminiscent of the transitional elements shown earlier in the exocrine pancreas by Jamieson and Palade (1967) . The images shown by Tooze et al. (1988) also suggested that these structures were continuous with the rough ER.

Collectively, these data convinced us that the budding compartment is part of a continuum extending from the rough ER and from parts of the nuclear envelope down to a cisternal element on one side of the Golgi complex. These observations were further supported by the distribution of glucose 6 phosphatase reaction product. Furthermore, the budding compartment, as well as a cisternal element on one side of the Golgi stack labels for PDI, a marker that from immunofluoresence data is often considered to be exclusively present in the rough ER. We recently obtained a similar result in ts045 VSV-infected cells at 15\u00b0C; the structures where the VSV-G protein accumulated, including the first Golgi cisterna, also labeled for PDI (see below; Grifliths, G., R. Pepperkok, and T. Kreis, manuscript in preparation) . That the localization of PDI extends beyond the rough ER is also documented by Hobman et ai. (1992) , who showed that the post rough ER membranes where the E1 protein of rubella virus accumulates are also labeled with anti-PDI. Similarly, Oprins et al.

Since our data show that vesicular transport is not required for Gal-NAc addition, the logical consequence is that the budding compartment (or intermediate compartment) is the first compartment along the biosynthetic pathway from which /~-cop vesicles appear to bud. In agreement with this notion /3-cop was found in a recent study to localize mainly to cis-Golgi structures (Oprins et al., 1993) and a yeast homologue of E-cop, SEC21, has been found to be required for ER to Golgi transport in yeast (Hosobuchi et al., 1992) . In addition, when the transport of the newly synthesized G protein of VSV into the Golgi stack is blocked at 15\u00b0C much of the G protein is localized in/3-cop-containing buds found in close proximity to the Golgi stack (Griftiths, G., R. Pepperkok, and T. Kreis, manuscript in preparation). Further, in a parallel study, microinjection of anti-E-cop antibodies was shown to block the transport of the G protein into the Golgi stack; the compartment where the G protein accumulated under these conditions overlapped significantly at the immunofluorescence level with the intermediate compartment marker p53 (Pepperkok et al., 1993) .",

If this view is correct it would argue that the beginning of the functional Golgi complex (which we define as the compartment containing mannosi-dase I) would comprise the second cisterna on the cis side of the stack. In other words, we suggest that the first vesicular transport step would occur from the first cisterna into the second cisterna of the stack. This idea does not rule out the possibility that vesicles may also bud from more proximal regions of the intermediate compartment and still be targeted to the cisterna containing mannosidase I. We emphasize, however, that the three-dimensional organization of this ER/Golgi boundary is exceedingly complex. Clearly, more extensive structural analyses combined with double-labeling experiments using defined markers of both the intermediate compartment and the bona fide Golgi complex, and in particular mannosidase I, will be required in order to clarify this point.",

In rat liver this lectin labels neither the rough ER nor the bulk of the smooth ER; the labeling is restricted to poorly defined membrane elements close to, and including the Golgi complex (results not shown). These data indicate that the acquisition of GalNAc first occurs in the pre-Golgi budding compartment, a finding that has important implications for our biochemical studies.

Our in vivo labeling data showed that, under conditions that would be expected to block vesicular transport, where ~98 % of ATP was depleted, a significant fraction of the M protein acquired GalNAc but no detectable Golgi modifications were observed. The same result was seen at temperatures between 14 and 15\u00b0C, a condition expected to block ER to Golgi transport (Saraste and Kuismanen, 1984) . In both cases, when the block was reversed by either washing out the 2-deoxy-o-glucose and sodium azide or, for the low temperature experiments, by raising the temperature to 37\u00b0C the M protein was efficiently converted to the Golgi forms. This argues strongly that the protein had been blocked in a functional pre-Golgi, intermediate form and not in a transportincompetent state resulting from the blocking conditions.",

It is now generally accepted that for in vitro reconstitution of any vesicular transport step both cytosol and ATP are needed. Accordingly, in this study both cytosol and ATP were required for the newly synthesized M protein to acquire the Golgi modifications, consistent with the notion that ER to Golgi transport requires a vesicular transport step (Beckers and Balch, 1989; Beckers et al., 1990; Schekman, 1992) . In contrast, the intermediate compartment modification, GalNAc, was obtained in the presence of cytosol without ATP and in the presence of GTP3,S. In the absence of cytosol the results were more difficult to interpret. Under these conditions both ATP and UDP-GalNAc were required for efficient GalNAc addition. While the UDP-GalNAc requirement can be explained simply by the fact that this cytosolic precursor is lost after permeabilization, the ATP requirement is more difficult to explain. One obvious possibility relates to the phenomenon of\"quality control\" (Hurtley and Helenius, 1989) , the need for the protein to be folded in its correct conformation. The idea that ATP is not critical for folding of the M protein, which has only 25 amino acids exposed on the luminal side (Rottier et al., 1986) , is supported by our in vivo studies where ATP depletion had no obvious effect on the appearance of the M1 form. Whatever the explanation for the ATP requirement, we consider it unlikely that it reflects a vesicular transport step from the rough ER to the site of GalNAc addition since it occurs in the absence of cytosol and in the presence of GTPTS. In contrast, these conditions, as expected, blocked the appearance of the Golgi forms of the M protein.",

The nature of this regulation is at present unclear. We suggest that one important aspect in this process that has until now been neglected is a consideration of the structure that defines the boundary between the rough ER and the intermediate compartment or between the rough ER and the smooth ER in cells such as rat liver parenchyma. It is conceivable that this structure may act as a gating mechanism that regulates the exit of both membrane and soluble components from the rough ER.",
