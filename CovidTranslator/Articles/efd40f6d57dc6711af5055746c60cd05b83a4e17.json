Inactivated vaccines have been used in exotic and very susceptible carnivores as the use of attenuated CDV is unsafe in these species (Appel and Summers, 1995) . The canarypox-vectored CDV MLV (recCDVor rD) vaccine was licensed for use in dogs in 1997 in the USA (Pardo et al.,1997) with the bene\u00a2t that postvaccinal CDV encephalitis cannot occur with this vaccine.This vaccine is also being used in several Latin American countries where the \u00a2eld pressure of CDV infection is the greatest.

Although colostral antibody is vital for the protection of puppies during the \u00a2rst weeks of life, interference from this antibody can make a CDV vaccination program for puppies di\u2044cult to design. Newborn pups, given the opportunity to ingest colostrum, will acquire an initial CDV serum neutralizing antibody (SN) titre of up to 77 per cent of the serum titre of the dam (Greene and Appel, 2006) . If the titre of passively acquired SNCDVantibodies in the pup is too high, these can interfere with active immunization, whereas if the titre is too low, the pup could be susceptible to CDV infection. In order to overcome this very practical issue, a range of alternative approaches has been investigated.",

Intranasal administration of CAV-2 to pups in the face of CAV maternally derived antibodies is known to engender a good antibody response (Appel et al.,1975) . For this reason the potential of CAV-2 vectored CDV vaccines in puppies born to CDVand CAV-2 vaccinated dams was investigated (Fischer et al., 2002) . Two experimental replication-competent canine adenovirus type 2 (CAV-2)-based vaccines expressing CDV haemagglutinin (HA) and fusion (F) glycoproteins (vCA13 and vCA17, respectively), were tested in pups with maternally derived antibodies to CDVand CAV-2. CDV neutralizing antibodies were induced, and solid protective immunity against intracerebral challenge with virulent CDV was present, in all subcutaneously vaccinated pups, despite the presence of pre-existing systemic immunity to the CAV-2 vector. This approach may be an e\u2044cient strategy to overcome passively acquired immunity to CDV and CAV-2 in pups. However, when the same constructs were administered intranasally to pups with pre-existing systemic immunity to CAV-2, anti-CAV-2 vector interference was shown, suggesting limitations for the practical use of such recombinant viruses for intranasal vaccination in the face of maternally derived immunity.",
