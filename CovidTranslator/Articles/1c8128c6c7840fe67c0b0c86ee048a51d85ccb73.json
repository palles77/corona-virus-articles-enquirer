A survey is presented of recent advances in the study of the influences that Sias have as bulky hydrophilic and electronegatively charged monosaccharides on animal cells and on their interaction with microorganisms. Some highlights are: sialylation leads to increased anti-inflammatory activity of IgG antibodies, facilitates the escape of microorganisms from the host's immune system, and in polymeric form is involved in the regulation of embryogenesis and neuronal growth and function. The role of siglecs in immunoregulation, the dynamics of lymphocyte binding to selectins and the interactions of toxins, viruses, and other microorganisms with the host's Sia are now better understood. N-Glycolylneuraminic acid from food is antigenic in man and seems to have pathogenic potential. Sia O-acetylation mediated by various eukaryotic and prokaryotic O-acetyltransferases modulates the affinity of these monosaccharides to mammalian and microbial receptors and hinders apoptosis. The functionally versatile O-acetylated ganglioside GD3 is an onco-fetal antigen.",

            "text": "Sialic acids (Sia), a large family of neuraminic acid derivatives, are acidic monosaccharides common in higher animals and some microorganisms. They are found in cellular secretions and on the outer surface of cells, mostly as terminal components of glycoproteins and glycolipids (gangliosides) [1 ] . Sia are exposed to the cellular environment functioning in intrinsic and extrinsic communication and in defense. The same holds for mucin secretions, in which Sia not only increase viscosity but also help to protect epithelia from harmful substances and pathogens [2, 3] . It is not easy to describe a general role of Sia because these monosaccharides participate directly or indirectly in multiple and diverse cellular events. However, in addition to their negative charge, it is useful to divide their functions into two groups that explain many phenomena. Firstly, Sia act as a biological mask, that is an antirecognition agent by shielding recognition sites such as penultimate monosaccharides of glycan chains or (antigenic) proteins and other macromolecules of cell membranes including receptor molecules. In this way Sia contribute to cells being 'self'. This may be possible by their electronegative nature together with their bulky, hydrophilic chemical structure ( Figure 1 ). Secondly, Sia operate in the opposite way by being biological recognition sites, that is ligands for a great variety of molecules such as hormones, lectins, antibodies, and inorganic cations. Especially the latter two protein classes have been recognized recently as being involved in most important phenomena of cellular and molecular interactions in both physiological and pathological processes. In this respect, polysialic acids (PSA) are presently drawing much attention [4] . Furthermore, many microorganisms infect cells by binding to Sia and thus exploit the host organism. Elucidation of the underlying mechanisms will enable the development of therapeutic or prophylactic strategies [5] .",

Morell 35 years ago (summarized in [1, 6] ). The reason for this was the exposure of Gal residues and trapping of unmasked glycoproteins by a Gal-recognizing receptor. This finding tremendously influenced not only sialobiology but also the whole area of protein (lectin)-carbohydrate interaction studies [8 ] . In a similar way desialylation of erythrocytes, lymphocytes, and thrombocytes leads to sequestration from circulation by a galectin on liver and spleen macrophages [6] . Also tumor cells may be trapped in this way. Furthermore, interaction of CD44 on erythrocytes with hyaluronic acid on vascular endothelia leads to rolling and tethering of desialylated or aged erythrocytes thus facilitating sequestration [9] . In sepsis, the 'Ashwell receptor' normally modulating von Willebrand factor homeostasy mitigates the lethal coagulopathy by eliminating platelets desialylated by Streptococcus pneumoniae sialidase [10 ]. A model of reversible interactions of cells regulated by Sia is depicted in Figure 2 .",

A similar antirecognition strategy allowing better survival in the host and thus enhancing virulence is applied by microorganisms which coat themselves by colominic acid, a PSA, or express sialylated glycans mimicking mammalian structures (molecular mimicry). For example, group B Streptococcus presents terminal Sia a2,3Galb1,4GlcNAcunits, like human neutrophils which interact in the cell membrane with siglec-9 in cis. It was shown that the bacterial oligosaccharide binds in trans to the same neutrophil siglec-9 in a Sia-dependent manner resulting in the weakening of the neutrophil immune response and thus demonstrating a novel mechanism of bacterial immune evasion [11 ] .",

Sia are biosynthesized in many steps from glucose leading to both N-acetylmannosamine-6phosphate (ManNAc-6P) and phosphoenol pyruvate, which are condensed to Neu5Ac-9-phosphate followed by dephosphorylation [6, 7] . The formation of ManNAc-6P from UDP-N-acetylglucosamine (UDP-GlcNAc) is catalyzed by a bifunctional enzyme, the UDP-GlcNAc epimerase/ManNAc kinase (encoded by GNE), which is the key enzyme in Sia biosynthesis and can be feedback-inhibited by CMP-Neu5Ac. After the activation of Neu5Ac with CTP the resulting CMP-Neu5Ac is transported into the Golgi compartment and transferred to nascent glycoconjugates by a large family of monosialyltransferases and polysialyltransferases with varying specificities for glycoproteins and glycolipids [47] . Neu5Ac can be converted to Neu5Gc on the CMP-Neu5Ac level in the cytosol by the action of CMP-Neu5Ac hydroxylase (CMAH) [6] . The activity of this enzyme was lost during human evolution [38] .

In PSA of vertebrates and some microorganisms Sia are a2,8-connected and rarely a2,9-connected in homopolymers. In vertebrates PSA is attached to branched Asn-linked core glycans mostly of the neuronal cell-aggregation molecule NCAM (Figure 4 ) but also of other proteins like the voltage-sensitive sodium channel or neuropilin. Two polysialyltransferases (ST8SiaII and IV), highly selective for NCAM, assemble the polysaccharide chains (reviewed in [19] [20] [21] [22] ). Sialyltransferases involved in a2,8-oligo-sialylation of glycoconjugates during (neuronal) development were discovered in zebrafish [23] . In starfish and sea urchin up to 30 Neu5Gc residues were found to be linked linearly in a2 ! 5-O glycolyl -between the glycosidic bond of one Neu5Gc and the hydroxyl of the N-glycolyl residue of another Neu5Gc molecule [4] .

Only after the unmasking of a sufficient number of galactose residues (a 'cluster'), attachment to another cell, for example a macrophage, via galactose-recognizing receptors is possible. O-Acetyl (black dot) or N-glycolyl (black triangle) groups may inhibit the enzymatic release of Sia and the interaction of these monosaccharides with Siarecognizing receptors, for example, siglecs, or with viruses and bacteria. These Sia modifications are involved in fine-tuning of recognition events or can even be considered as molecular switches. O-Acetylation may fortify masking of immunogenic epitopes on microorganisms and enable escape from immune defense [49 ] . In this model symbols for Sia-recognizing receptors have not been drawn, and the symbol used for the Sia molecule could also represent oligosialic acids or polysialic acids, which may carry non-natural N-acyl or O-acyl modifications. The degradation of Sia is initiated by sialidases [6, 50, 51] , which strongly influence the behavior of normal and malignant cells. Polysialic acids can be split into Sia oligosaccharides by endosialidases from phages [52] . For de-O-acetylation of Sia a variety of esterases from animals and microorganisms are known [6, 53] .",

The bulky, electronegatively charged, much hydrated and 'slippery' PSA have an unstable conformation and therefore are not suited as a receptor [21] . PSA occupies large spaces between cells and thus regulates membrane-membrane apposition and blocks cell contacts and NCAM function. NCAM enables adhesion, signaling, and transport of synaptic vesicles resulting in differentiation, maturation, and function of neuronal cells. Therefore, PSA are mainly found during tissue and tumor development. PSA seem to reflect the primitive stage of differentiation and to enhance the metastatic potential of malignant cells. They are believed to reduce cell interactions through a form of permissive regulation, thus allowing only certain factors to influence a cell or through 'insulative' regulation in order to protect a cell from inappropriate or premature actions [21] . PSA seem to guarantee that NCAM contacts take place in a highly organized, time-specific and sitespecific manner. Correspondingly, the PSA level decreases during embryogenesis with the progression of neuronal differentiation, synaptogenesis, and circuit maturation in neonatal and adult animals. In adults, it persists only at sites that maintain neuronal plasticity like the hippocampus, thalamus, amygdala, and the olfactory bulb. In summary, PSA facilitate migration and maturation of neuronal progenitor cells, are involved in myelination of axons, learning and memory, regulation of circadian rhythms, secretion of hypophyseal hormones, chronic pain, emotional reactions such as anxiety and aggression, neuronal repair, and psychiatric diseases such as schizophrenia. Correspondingly, efforts are undertaken 510 Carbohydrates and glycoconjugates Structure of 9-O-acetylated disialo-ganglioside GD3 (9-OAcGD3; Neu5,9Ac 2 -a2,8Neu5Aca2,3Galb1,4Glcb1,1ceramide). The terminal Sia carries an O-acetyl (red) at C-9, which renders this frequent ganglioside an important regulator and biomarker of growth, differentiation, and malignancy of neuroectodermal tissues, as well as of lymphocyte function and apoptosis [17] . GD3 can directly be O-acetylated at C-7 by mammalian sialate-Oacetyltransferases, followed by migration of the O-acetyl to C-9. Therefore, both 7-OAcGD3 and 9-OAcGD3 occur in lymphocytes and tissues in various amounts.",

This versatility renders them important regulators of physiological events, although pathogens may exploit them for their own purposes. Among the numerous virus species recognizing Sia the oldest and most prominent example are influenza viruses where the role of Sia in their binding and spreading has been well investigated and led to the development of antivirals, based on the inhibition of the sialidase or 'receptor-destroying enzyme' involved in the infection mechanism [5] . At present attention is given to the study of the binding specificity of influenza and other viruses. A most prominent result is the difference between the human viruses (e.g. H3N2, recognizing N-acetylneuraminyl galactose that is a2,6-linked) and avian viruses (e.g. H5N1, showing a2,3-linkage preference). However, the efficiency of a virus to infect also depends on the distribution of such Sia glycosides on cells and on additional properties of cell membranes [27, 28] .

These membrane-bound I-type lectins belong to the immunoglobulin superfamily and occur in various cell types of the immune and hematopoietic systems of primates and rodents or in the central nervous system as is the case of the myelinassociated glycoprotein (MAG; Siglec-4). Each Siglec has a distinct preference for the Sia and linkage type. O-Acetylation can mask the ligand function of Sia in the case of sialoadhesin (Siglec-1), CD22 (Siglec-2), and MAG [17, 36] . Furthermore, the degree of O-acetylation of the capsular polysaccharide of Group B Streptococcus affects the interaction between the bacteria and CD33-related siglecs of leukocytes [37] . While mouse and ape CD22 preferentially bind to Neu5Gc, the human one prefers Neu5Ac, which parallels the loss of Neu5Ac hydroxylation in man.

For example, CD22 is an inhibitory receptor of B-cells that regulates multiple B-cell functions and lymphocyte survival. A future aim for the modulation of B-cell function and reduction of inflammation is to design CD22-specific inhibitors by synthesis of novel sialosides with hydrophobic substituents at C-9 of Sia [40] . Most human siglecs are related to CD33. They undergo rapid evolution and regulate leukocyte functions during inflammatory and immune responses [41] .

They bind to the tetrasaccharides sialyl-Lewis x and sialyl-Lewis a . Crystallographic studies revealed the formation of 'catch bonds' for selectins during the interaction with immobilized ligands, whereby large regions of the lectin domain switch between two distinct states [44] . A bond is called a catch bond if its lifetime increases with force up to a critical level. Such mechanosensitive bonds formed under nonequilibrium conditions can explain the threshold observed for leukocyte rolling. Lymphocyte L-selectin specifically recognizes also the sulphated version of sialyl-Lewis x found on the high-endothelial venules of peripheral lymph nodes. The selectins are involved in rolling and migration through the endothelium of lymphocytes and thus in immunological and inflammatory events. Tumor cells often bearing sialyl-Lewis x residues can also bind to selectins, which provide a route for tumor cell migration and metastasis formation [3] . Sia O-acetylation may impair this interaction [17] . Normal cellular human prion protein (PrP c ) contains both sialyl-Lewis x and Lewis x glycans. It was found to bind to selectins, but surprisingly only by the Lewis x moiety [45 ] . In that case sialylation prevents selectin interaction, which can be reversed by sialidase treatment.",

There is more evidence for Sia's positive or negative modulation of molecular and cellular interactions, thus rendering cells 'self', affecting immune reactions, regulating apoptosis or influencing receptor function, growth, differentiation, and aging. In particular, intensive research on PSA and siglecs has shed light on cell and neuronal tissue differentiation and immune regulation. Knowledge how tumor cells and microorganisms, especially viruses, can exploit the properties of Sia also increased appreciably. Still, more work is necessary to fully understand these phenomena, and it is necessary to obtain more information about the regulation of Sia biosynthesis, degradation, and modification on the gene and protein levels, how, for example hormones influence these events, as well as on structural aspects of Siareceptor interactions and supramolecular arrangement of sialylated glycans in cell membranes. This will increase the sialo-pharmaceutical possibilities to fight against the many infectious, immunological, malignant, psychiatric, and degenerative diseases in which Sia are involved.",
