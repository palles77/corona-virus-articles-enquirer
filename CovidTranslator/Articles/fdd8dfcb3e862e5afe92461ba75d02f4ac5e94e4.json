To better understand this inefficiency, we localized the expression of Pit2, the amphotropic receptor, in polarized human airway epithelia. Pit2 was expressed on both the apical and basolateral surfaces of the cells, suggesting that factors other than receptor abundance may limit apical gene transfer efficiency. Binding studies performed with radiolabeled amphotropic MuLV suggested that the apically applied virus binds to Pit2. Hypothetical barriers to retroviral gene transfer include the apical glycocalyx and other secreted products of epithelia.

            "text": "Gene transfer is a direct approach to treat inherited lung diseases, such as cystic fibrosis (CF). To correct or prevent the chronic lung disease associated with this autosomal recessive disease it is anticipated that some level of transgene expression must be continuously maintained. 1 This could be achieved using integrating vectors, such as Moloney murine leukemia virus (MuLV) and lentivirusbased retroviral vectors 2 or adeno-associated virus (AAV) vectors. 3 The most practical route for the direct delivery of vectors to the airway epithelium is by aerosolization or instillation. However, several studies indicate that the efficiency of gene transfer to polarized airway epithelia following apical application of viral vectors is poor, while transduction from the basolateral side occurs much more readily. Examples include serotype 5 adenovirus vectors 4, 5 and AAV2 vectors. [6] [7] [8] Localization studies of the receptors for adenovirus and AAV2 suggest that their expression is polarized to the basolateral surface, thus the abundance of these components, the treatment also decreased the transepithelial resistance to~35% of the controls, suggesting that the epithelial integrity was impaired. To attain an airway epithelial culture with a modified apical surface and intact epithelial integrity, we utilized 100 mM 2deoxy-D-glucose, a glycosylation inhibitor, to prevent the glycocalyx from reforming following enzyme treatment. This approach allowed the resistance, but not the apical glycocalyx to recover. Despite this physical modification of the cell surface, the amphotropic retroviral vector failed to transduce airway epithelia following apical application. These results suggest that factors other than apical receptor abundance and the glycocalyx inhibit amphotropic retroviral gene transfer in human airway epithelia.

[9] [10] [11] In contrast, the same envelopes infect epithelia readily when applied to the basolateral surface. The most simple intrepretation of these data is that the receptors for these envelopes are only expressed on the basolateral surface. However, there have been no studies localizing the expression of known retrovirus receptors in polarized airway epithelia. The receptor for the amphotropic pseudotyped retrovirus, Pit2, is an inorganic phosphate transporter, 12 while the receptor for xenotropic enveloped retrovirus was identified as XPR1, a gene of unknown function. [13] [14] [15] A putative receptor for the VSV-G envelope glycoprotein was suggested to be phosphatidylserine, but it is possible that other receptors or co-receptors exist. 16 In the present study, we sought to better understand the limitations to apical gene transfer with retroviruses, using the amphotropic enveloped MuLV-based vector as a model.",

To address this possibility, we transduced airway epithelia with Ad5-CMVPit2-eGFP and then applied the amphotropic MuLV vector to the apical surface. To demonstrate that the Pit2-eGFP construct is functional, amphotropic vector resistant CHO cells were transduced with 50 MOI of Ad5-CMVPit2-eGFP. As shown in Figure 2a , CHO cells transduced with the Pit2expressing adenoviral vector were susceptible to gene transfer with the TA7-\u2424gal amphotropic pseudotyped vector, while the parental cells were not. This confirms that the Pit2-eGFP protein is functional as a virus receptor and the expression level following adenovirus infection is sufficient to support amphotropic retroviral transduction. However, when we transduced airway epithelia with Ad5-CMVPit2-eGFP and 3 days later applied TA7\u00dfgal vector to the apical surface of KGF-treated cells, airway cells remained resistant to transduction (Figure 2b d). From these experiments, we conclude that the apical resistance to amphotropic MuLV transduction is not due to an absence of Pit2 expression.",

Importantly, this binding is blocked by goat anti-gp70 antiserum (second bar), but not normal goat serum (first bar). Since Pit2 is a sodium-dependent phosphate transporter, we used inorganic phosphate as a competitive inhibitor of Pit2 binding as described by others. 19 When 40 mM NaH 2 PO 4 was included in the solution with the apically applied MuLV, binding was inhibited (third bar).

Therefore, we used this reagent to inhibit the normal production of new proteoglycans and glycosaminoglycans necessary for the formation of the glycocalyx. We hypothesized that inhibiting glycosylation after enzyme digestion might block the formation of a new glycocalyx meshwork on the apical surface. To test this hypothesis, we first treated the apical surface of differentiated airway epithelia with the enzymes for 2 h at 37\u00b0C. Subsequently, 100 mM 2-deoxy-D-glucose was included in the cell culture medium. Following enzyme treatment and culture with 2-deoxy-D-glucose, the transepithelial resistance was measured and the apical surface was examined by scanning electron microscopy. As shown in Figure 7a , the transepithelial resistance recovered to control levels 5 days after culture in the 2-deoxy-D-glucose-containing culture medium. Scanning and transmission electron microscopy on day 5 demonstrated that the apical glycocalyx remained reduced in abundance (Figure 7b, c) . Immunostaining for keratan sulfate and collagen V showed that most of the surface area stained weakly, compared with the untreated controls, while sialic acid abundance was unchanged, essentially identical to the results shown in Figure 5g -l (data not shown).

As shown in Figure 8 , in control epithelia (Figure 8a ) or epithelia treated with enzymes and then maintained in 2-deoxy-D-glucose-containing media for 5 days (Figure 8b ), amphotropic MuLV failed to transduce cells following apical application. As a positive control, enzyme and 2-deoxy-D-glucose-treated airway epithelia were transduced apically with vector formulated with EGTA. We previously showed that EGTA opens epithelial junctions, allowing the apically applied MuLV vectors access to the susceptible basolateral surface. 9, 10, 17 Figure 8c shows that the EGTA formulated amphotropic MuLV vector efficiently transduces the epithelia, confirming that the Pit2 receptor is functional.

In contrast to the findings for the coxackie B and adenovirus serotype 2 and 5 receptor (CAR), where the receptor expression is polarized to the basolateral surface, 4,5 we found that Pit2 is present on both the apical and basolateral surfaces of airway epithelia. Furthermore, these studies indicate that the amphotropic MuLV vector binds to the apical surface of airway epithelia and that this binding is reduced in the presence of NaH 2 PO 4 , suggesting it is mediated by Pit2. 19 Therefore the limitation for apical Gene Therapy gene transfer with amphotropic retrovirus is more than the simple absence of the appropriate cellular receptor. Increasing Pit2 expression in airway epithelial cells with an adenoviral vector did not enhance apical gene transfer with the amphotropic retrovirus either, suggesting that the abundance of Pit2 is not the limitation. Potential physical barriers that might prevent the vector from reaching apical receptors are the glycocalyx and other secreted, adherent products of epithelia. Our studies indicate that the apical surface of human airway epithelia has a dense meshwork of material that is morphologically compatible with a glycocalyx. Furthermore, some of the components of this matrix were identified histochemically to include sialic acid, keratan sulfate, and collagen type V. Attempts to enhance gene transfer by removing apical glycocalyx components with enzymes or preventing its formation by growing cells in 2-deoxy-D-glucose-containing media were unsuccessful. The results suggest that factors other than Pit2 receptor abundance limit gene transfer from the apical surface of airway epithelia.",

Our studies confirm that glycoproteins modified by the addition of sialic acid moieties and keratan sulfate are present on the apical surface.

These products include mucins 30 and extracellular matrix components, such as collagen and fibronectin. 31 It was previously shown that the basement membrane of the airway epithelium contains several extracellular matrix molecules including chondroitin sulfate, heparan sulfate proteoglycan, entactin, laminin, fibronectin, and type V collagen. 25, 32 The present studies indicate that the apical surface of airway epithelia also contains type V collagen.

            "text": "Enzymatic modifications of the apical surface have previously been investigated as a means to enhance gene transfer with non-retroviral vector systems. Pilewski and colleagues found that human airway epithelia or MDCK cells expressing the mucin gene MUC1, a complex sialated glycoconjugate attached to the cell surface, were resistant to gene transfer with adenoviral vectors. 33 This inhibition was overcome by treating cell surfaces with neuraminidase to remove sialic acid moieties. In studies of AAV2-mediated gene transfer to airway epithelia, Bals and colleagues 7 reported that treatment of the apical surface of differentiated airway epithelial cells with various enzymes including trypsin, N-glycosidase F, neuraminid- ase, N-glycosidase A, and endoglycosidase H enhanced vector transduction from the apical surface. In the same study, the addition of mucin or heparin inhibited gene transfer. Pickles and coworkers 4 investigated the effects of enzymatic apical surface modifications on the apical gene transfer efficiency of serotype 5 adenovirus vectors. Polarized MDCK cells expressing GPI-linked CAR were used as a model. Enzymatic modification with neuraminidase, trypsin, keratanase, or elastase enhanced apical gene transfer to MDCK cells expressing apical CAR. 4 In contrast to these findings, Walters et al 34 recently reported that expression of GPI-linked CAR on the apical surface of polarized human airway epithelia was sufficient to confer apical infectivity with serotype 5 adenovirus. Further removal of glycocalyx components with neuraminidase or glyosidases did not enhance adenoviral gene transfer. 34 In contrast to these results with AAV2 and adenoviral gene transfer, the present studies indicate that the Pit2 receptor is expressed on both membrane domains of human airway epithelia. Despite the expression of Pit2 on the apical surface of airway epithelia, it does not support gene transfer with amphotropic retrovirus, with or without enzymatic modifications of the surface. Therefore, we conclude that factors other than receptor abundance limit amphotropic retrovirus gene transfer. There are several possible explanations for these results that require further study. The Pit2 protein that is sorted to the apical membrane may not functionally support viral entry while basolaterally sorted Pit2 does. It is also possible that there are additional co-receptors or co-factors required for infection via Pit2 and that these are missing from the apical surface. Furthermore, we have not yet determined whether fusion does occur for the apically applied vector. If fusion does occur, it is possible that steps that occur after the nucleocapsid enters the cytoplasm, such as reverse transcription and trafficking to the nucleus, are not equivalent following entry from the apical and basolateral cell surfaces. 35 It is important to note that that these findings with the amphotropic pseudotype can not be generalized to all enveloped viruses. Using the same model of primary human airway epithelia, we recently demonstrated that wild-type human coronavirus 229E 36 and influenza virus (A/Japan/305/57 (H2N2)) 37 both infect polarized airway epithelia when applied to the apical surface. Similar results were seen with wild-type respiratory syncytial virus and parainfluenza virus type 3 (McCray and Sinn, unpublished observations). Clearly some respiratory viruses evolved methods to efficiently bypass apical barriers on airway epithelia. These properties of apical infection might be adopted to improve current retroviral vector systems for airway gene transfer. Thus we conclude that there is no evidence of an absolute barrier to apical airway gene transfer for enveloped viruses.",

A propidium iodide stain was then applied to counterstain the nuclei and cytoplasm. Following immunostaining, the samples were examined with either epifluorescent (BX60, Olympus) or confocal microscopy (MRC 1024, BioRad, Hercules, CA, USA).",

Unless otherwise specified, following apical digestion with enzymes, airway epithelia were cultured in Ultroser G medium containing 100 mM 2-deoxy-D-glucose for 5-7 days.
