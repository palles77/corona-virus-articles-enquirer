Compared with controls, ALRI cases were more likely to test positive for respiratory syncytial virus, influenza, adenovirus, human metapneumovirus and parainfluenza viruses 1 and 3 (P \u2264 0.01 for all).

            "text": "We found that a high proportion of ALRI hospital admissions had the detection of bocavirus or rhinoviruses, but the etiologic contribution of these viruses remains uncertain. Bocavirus infection was previously shown to be more common among hospitalized ALRI cases in Sa Kaeo Province than among controls although 91% of bocavirus-positive ALRI patients <5 years of age were coinfected with another virus. 31 Rhinovirus infection in the current analysis was not significantly more common among cases than among controls, but differences approached statistical significance and were consistent with previously published work from our sites that did show a significant association between hospitalized ALRI and rhinovirus detection. 8 These data highlight the challenges of etiologic attribution with increasingly sensitive diagnostic assays for an increasing number of potential pathogens and underscore the value of testing controls without respiratory illness to assess causality. However, lack of association between ALRI and pathogen prevalence cannot definitively exclude the possibility that a pathogen is part of the causal pathway for disease. Our control design may not have been optimal to evaluate causality for all pathogens as we could not evaluate prolonged shedding from prior infection or shedding prior to the onset of symptoms. In addition to RSV, influenza a and B viruses, HMPV and HPIV1 and 3, we found that hospitalized ALRI was significantly associated with the detection of adenovirus, which differed from previous studies in Alaska (United States) 33 and Kenya. 34 Our data underestimate the bacterial contribution to childhood ALRI. We did not perform testing for Mycoplasma pneumoniae and Chlamydia pneumoniae during the analysis period, but a previous report from these sites found that only ~1% of ALRI cases among children <5 years of age were positive for each. 10 testing for tuberculosis was not done, and testing for other bacterial pathogens associated with severe pneumonia, such as S. pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae, was limited to blood culture. The sensitivity of blood cultures is low, and low blood volumes and prior antibiotic administration (~25%) likely limited the yield further. 14 The relative frequency of nontyphoidal Salmonella (n = 21) and Escherichia coli (n = 13) was unexpected; enteric Gram-neGAtive bacteria are generally easier to isolate than Grampositives like S. pneumoniae and may have been less affected by antibiotic Pretreatment. Previous studies have identified invasive Salmonella infection among children with pneumonia, including a study from Thailand that identified cases with radiographic evidence of pulmonary infiltrates. 35, 36 Even under ideal testing conditions, only a fraction of bacterial pneumonia cases are bacteremic. Based on a pneumococcal conjuGAte vaccine probe study in South africa, only 3.4% of pneumococcal clinical pneumonia cases had positive blood cultures. 37 Our conclusions were limited by surveillance that only captured ALRI cases requiring hospitalization, which missed the substantial outpatient burden and biased descriptions of seasonality and pathogen distribution toward cases severe enough to need hospitalization. Through community surveys, we believe that hospital-based surveillance captures 58-80% of all ALRI in these 2 provinces. 21, 38 Our findings provide informative data for rural Thailand, but it is not clear that results can be generalized to more urban settings or other nations. This analysis demonstrates a high incidence of hospitalized ALRI among young children in Thailand and suggests that important differences in IR exist by age, sex and season. Virus Infections account for the largest proportion of known pathogens, but a substantial proportion remain of unknown etiology. Our results underscore the critical need for effective prevention and control measures for high-burden pathogens such as RSV, highlight the potential impact of proven prevention measures (eg, influenza and pneumococcal conjuGAte vaccines) and emphasize the need for continued efforts to better define ALRI etiology, including the need for improved molecular-based diagnostic approaches in young children.
