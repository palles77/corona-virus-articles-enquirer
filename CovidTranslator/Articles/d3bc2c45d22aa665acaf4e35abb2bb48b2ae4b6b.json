The extract yield and amounts of nitric oxide (NO) and interleukin (IL)-6 were set to maximum for modeling predictions. The predicted optimum values for the mixing ratio were 49.5% for Rhodiola crenulata, 26.1% for Astragalus membranaceus, and 24.4% for Panax quinquefolius, and the predicted response values were 31.5% yield, 13.4% NO production, and 6.1% IL-6 production; actual values were 35.3% yield, 14.7% NO, and 6.6% IL-6. The optimum mixing ratio extract (OMRE) was used for the animal experiments. Treating mice with OMRE at 200 mg/kg produced significant increases in spleen indexes and T-cell/B-cell proliferation. OMRE treatment increased IL-10 and IL-6 production in concanavalin A-and lipopolysaccharide-induced T-and B-lymphocytes, respectively. These results provide a basis for the development of functional extracts and drinks.",

Unofficially, R. crenulata has been used as a fever reducer, sedative, and astringent and has been reported to show antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, antidiabetic, and liver toxicity protection activities (Choe et al., 2012; Kwon, Jang, & Shetty, 2006; Wu, Lian, Jiang, & Nan, 2009; Zou et al., 2015) . Recently, researchers have reported that R. crenulata has additional beneficial effects, including antioxidant activity (Kanupriya et al., 2005) and protection against neuron damage (Mook-Jung et al., 2002) . The main components mediating these effects are salidroside and tyrosol.",

The suitability of the model was further verified with variance analysis as shown in Supplementary Table S3 to verify not only the suitability of the reaction model but also the significance and coefficient of each term (Supplementary Table S3 ). From interacting terms, the p value for R. crenulata \u00d7 P. quinquefolia was 0.006, reflecting the greatest significance in the reaction model for this experiment. The contour lines for IL-6 production showed an increasing trend in the production of IL-6, an important cytokine in the immune response, as the mixing ratio of R. crenulata increased, but a decreasing trend in IL-6 production as the mixing ratios of P. quinquefolia and A. membranaceus increased, suggesting that A. membranaceus and P. quinquefolia did not greatly affect IL-6 production compared with R. crenulata (Fig. 2C) .",

To determine the optimum mixing ratios of R. crenulata, A. membranaceus, and P. quinquefolia, a reaction optimization tool was used in the mixture design. The optimization technique in the mixture design is a method to find the optimum level of factors by gradually moving towards the optimized direction through calculation of response variable values for the experimental point at each stage. By setting extract yields and amounts of NO and IL-6 produced by macrophages to the maximum, the determined reaction equation from the model was used to predict the satisfying numerical point. The predicted optimum values of the mixing ratio to obtain complex extracts with high extract yield, as well as immune enhancing activity, were 49.5% for R. crenulata, 26.1% for A. membranaceus, and 24.4% for P. quinquefolia, and the predicted response values based on the determined mixing ratios were 31.5% yield, 13.4% NO production, and 6.1% IL-6 production (Fig. 3) . To verify the predicted response values, extracts, referred to as the OMRE consisting of 50% R. crenulata, 26% A. membranaceus, and 24% P. quinquefolia were prepared, and 35.3% yield, 14.7% NO production, and 6.6% IL-6 production were obtained. In order to identify the substances that significantly affected the response variables and optimum mixing ratios to satisfy the response variables, we used mixture design. Our findings could be used to develop functional drinks with high added value in the food industry. Moreover, R. crenulata, which has various physiological activities, could show greater value in improving food quality by mixing R. crenulata with A. membranaceus and P. quinquefolia to develop a complex extract. Recent studies have reported the optimum mixing ratios for Petasites japonicus, Luffa cylindrica, and Houttuynia cordata mixture to treat respiratory diseases (Jeong et al., 2015) , and a mixture design has been used to optimizing the mixing ratio in Chinese quince jam production (Lee & Jang, 2009 ).",

Here, mice were treated with the OMRE by oral administration at 100 or 200 mg/kg, and the effects of OMRE on the spleen index are presented in Fig. 4A . When the mice were treated with OMRE at 200 mg/kg, the spleen index was significantly increased compared with that of the control group. The spleen index tended to increase when used at the lower dose as well (100 mg/kg); however, this difference was not statistically significant (Fig. 4A) . CVT-E002, an immunostimulatory polysaccharide-rich extract from the roots of North American ginseng (P. quinquefolium), was used as a positive control (Biondo et al., 2008) . The proliferation of splenic cells is one of the most important steps in the activation of cell-mediated or humoral immunity (Zhao, Li, Luo, & Wu, 2006) .

T-and B-lymphocyte proliferation was increased in the OMRE-treated group compared with that in the negative control group. Splenic cell proliferation capacity has been widely used as a method to screen for new immune stimulators because cell division and DNA synthesis can be stimulated by various antigens, mitogens, and cytokines (Kruisbeek, Shevach, & Thornton, 2004) . In this study,administration of OMRE increased the mitogen-stimulated proliferation of splenic cells in mice. These results suggested that OMRE activated mouse lymphocytes.",

            "text": "3.6. Cytokine production in mitogen-induced splenocytes OMRE treatment significantly increased IL-10 cytokine levels in Con A-induced T lymphocytes by stimulation of T cells (Fig. 5A ). IL-10 may act in an autocrine manner to suppress antigen-presenting cell (APC) pro-inflammatory responses, act directly on effector T cells to limit their proliferation and function, or promote the differentiation of naive T cells into regulatory populations (Couper, Blount, & Riley, 2008) . In LPS-induced B-lymphocyte supernatants, the amount of IL-10 was increased by OMRE treatment (Fig. 5A ). Most cytokines with B-cell growth factor activity in vitro, including IL-2, IL-4, and IL-10, are also able to induce partial differentiation of B cells into plasma cells secreting Ig (Banchereau & Rousset, 1992) . IL-10 is the most potent B-cell differentiation factor, inducing complete differentiation of B cells into mature plasma cells in association with CD40 activation (Rousset et al., 1992) . As shown in Fig. 5B , treatment with OMRE at 200 mg/kg significantly increased IL-6 production in Con A-or LPS-stimulated splenocytes supernatants. IL-6 stimulates the terminal differentiation of B cells into plasma cells and plays a central role in fever and acute phase responses (Muraguchi et al., 1988; Sica et al., 1990) . IL-6 is secreted by T cells and macrophages to stimulate immune responses and promotes T-cell proliferation, T helper cell differentiation, and T cell-mediated cytotoxicity by CD81 cells. Moreover, IL-6 synergizes with IL-1\u03b2 in the development of cell-mediated immune responses (Houssiau & Van Snick, 1992; Okada et al., 1988) .",

CON, saline-treated group; PC, CVT-E002\u2122 (100 mg/kg) treated group (positive control); OMRE, optimum mixing ratio extracttreated group. Values with the different letters are significantly different (p < .05). Fig. 6 . Effects of OMRE on the proliferation (A), IL-2 production (B), and IFN-\u03b3 production (C) in anti-CD3/CD28-stimulated T cells. Data were expressed as mean \u00b1 SD. Anti-CD3/CD28activated T cells were treated with OMRE (50, 100 or 200 \u03bcg/mL) for 72 h. Cell proliferation was assessed using the MTS/PMS assay as described in materials and methods. Amounts of IL-2 and IFN-\u03b3 were measured by ELISA, respectively. Data were expressed as mean \u00b1 SD. Values with the different letters are significantly different (p < .05).",
