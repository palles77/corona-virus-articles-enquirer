Since ISAV belongs to the same virus family as Influenza A virus, with similarities in protein functions, they may hence be characterised by analogy. Like NS1 protein of Influenza A virus, s8ORF2 of ISAV is implicated in interferon antagonism and RNA-binding functions. In this study, we investigated the role of s8ORF2 in RNAi suppression in a well-established Agrobacterium transient suppression assay in stably silenced transgenic Nicotiana xanthi. In addition, s8ORF2 was identified as a novel interactor with SsMov10, a key molecule responsible for RISC assembly and maturation in the RNAi pathway. This study thus sheds light on a novel route undertaken by viral proteins in promoting viral growth, using the host RNAi machinery.",

            "text": "Infectious salmon anaemia virus (ISAV) is a member of the Orthomyxoviridae family, and belongs to the genus Isavirus [1] . It is the causative agent of infectious salmon anaemia (ISA). Under normal conditions, ISA has only been detected in farmed Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar), and infected salmon exhibit clinical signs such as lethargy, anaemia, ascites, haemorrhagic liver, necrosis and congestion of internal organs [2] . The disease may result in high mortality with detrimental effects on farm production. Before the introduction of mandatory depopulation of net pens and production sites experiencing ISA outbreaks, the cumulative mortality during an outbreak could reach up to 90% [2] [3] [4] . The 14.3-kb genome of ISAV consists of eight singlestranded sense RNA segments, each ranging from 1.0 to 2.4 kb, encoding a total of 10 polypeptides [5] [6] [7] . The genomic segment 8 encodes two overlapping Open Reading Frames (ORFs) using a bicistronic coding strategy [8] , similar to Influenza A virus segment 8, which encodes the non-structural (NS) protein. The smaller product of ISAV segment 8 ORF1 is 591 nucleotides long encoding a 22-24-kDa matrix protein, and the 726 nucleotides-long ORF2 encodes a 27.4-kDa protein (s8ORF2) [6, 9] . The s8ORF2 is a viral structural protein [8] having two nuclear localising signals (NLSs). It shows nuclear localisation early in the infection cycle and later on localises to the cytosol as well [8] . It binds RNA and antagonises cellular type I interferon (IFN) response [8] .

            "text": "In counter-defence to RNAi defence mechanism, viruses utilise their polypeptides to inhibit the innate RNAi pathway [14, 15] . The mechanism of action of these polypeptides is based on their binding to cellular factors like ds RNA, or interacting with other RNA-silencing factors, to inhibit the RNAi pathway [15, 16] . RNA viruses produce ds RNA, transiently, during replication, transcription etc. in the cytosol. The presence of ds RNA is a pre-requisite for triggering RNAi pathway. The host cell recognises ds RNA in the cell cytoplasm as a pathogen associated cellular marker [17] and initiates antiviral RNA-silencing mechanism in all eukaryotes [18] [19] [20] . During this process, viral ds RNA is processed by Dicer nuclease into 21-25 nucleotide long siRNA duplexes [18] which in turn are diverted to RNA-induced silencing complexes (RISC) to silence the target viral mRNA [19, [21] [22] [23] . Indeed, RNA viruses are known to be pre-emptive towards cellular defences and have adopted strategies to evade such cellular defence mechanisms (reviewed by [24] and [25] ), by suppressing host RNAi pathways through a Viral Suppressor of RNAi or VSR [15, 26, 27] . A few of the VSRs of animal viral origin exhibit RNA binding and interferon antagonism simultaneously [28] . The VSR polypeptides, namely, Tat (HIV-1), NS1 (Influenza virus) and E3L (Vaccinia virus), VP35 (Ebolavirus) have three roles in common [29] [30] [31] [32] . They all are interferon antagonists, secondly, they all bind to ds RNA molecules and thirdly, they interact with RNAi machinery components to block RNAi pathway.",

This report identifies s8ORF2 as the third fish viral protein to be identified for RNAi suppressor function. It binds to ds RNA, siRNA and to Salmo salar Mov10 (SsMov10) of the RNAi pathway. Various domains were identified for RNAi suppression, RNA binding, SsMov10 interaction and dimerisation in vitro. The SsMov10 appears to play a significant role as s8ORF2 aide in RNAi suppression as it is a characterised RNA-induced Silencing Complex (or RISC-It is a multiprotein complex which uses miRNA or siRNA as the complementary strands and cleaves mRNA) maturing factor.",

To elucidate the role of s8ORF2 protein versus s8orf2 RNA in the RNAi-suppression assay, a nonsense mutant was generated by inserting a base (G) immediately after the start codon using sitedirected mutagenesis (Fig. 1c) . This nonsense mutant was termed NM-s8ORF2. Dose-dependent analyses of s8ORF2 and NM-s8ORF2 were done by incrementing the amount of DNA by 100 ng in each well. The addition of wt-s8ORF2 plasmid in increasing concentration, increased the suppression, reflected by increase in the population of GFP-positive cells from 5% with 100 ng to 25% with 500 ng (Fig. 1c) . The NM-s8ORF2 had minimal influence on GFP-expressing population, with a maximum effect at ~ 5.5% with (500 ng) suggesting that the VSR activity is a component of s8ORF2 protein but not its RNA, which was otherwise conserved in NM-s8ORF2.",

Alongside, an already studied Mungbean Yellow Mosaic India Virus (MYMIV) protein AC-2 fused to MBP was used as a negative control. MYMIV is a VSR but devoid of siRNAbinding activity [47] . The results showed no change in the mobility of GFP probe on incubation with GST, MBP and AC2-MBP proteins, whereas with s8ORF2, probe mobility was significantly reduced, suggesting that s8ORF2 possesses siRNA-binding activity (Fig. 2a) .

Also using COILS Software [8] , a coiling domain was predicted to be present in the C-terminal of s8ORF2 spanning 196-243 aa (illustrated in Fig. 3a ) [8] . Based on these predictions, we hypothesised that these domains might display the functions of RNA binding and dimerisation and therefore designed deletion mutants and tested them in the RNA-EMSA experiments (Fig. 3b) . We generated deletion mutants by PCR amplification, namely, \u0394NTD with 183 nt deleted from the N-terminal, \u0394CTD with 144 nt deleted from the C-terminus. These were cloned in the pGEX-4T-1 plasmid, and the purified proteins were obtained. Both the truncated polypeptides retained the RNA-binding activity, as shown in Fig. 3b, lanes 1-4 . We also made a double-deletion mutant in which both the N-and C-terminals were deleted; we denoted this mutant as \u0394DD. These RNA-EMSA experiments mapped the RNA-binding region of S8ORF2 between 62 and 195 aa (Fig. 3b, lane 6) . ",

The truncated s8ORF2 was made to interact with C-terminal deletion (\u0394CTD) on both GBKT7 and GADT7 vectors, respectively.

The experiment was done in duplicates and repeated thrice Fig. 5 In vitro analysis of SsMov10 activity in RNAi suppression. a SsMov10 interaction domain resides in C-terminal of s8ORF2 The yeast two-hybrid assays were performed according to the Manufacturer's protocol, Clontech Manual Gal-4 system in AH109 yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain. All the three assays were performed for reliability and were done in triplicates (the quadrants are mentioned against their numbers), where AH109 is the negative control yeast cells, and pAS2 N and SsMov-10 as the negative interaction controls. The data are from 3 independent experiments. b Confocal microscopy shows co-localisation of s8ORF2 and SsMov10. Transfected EPC cells express both SsMov10 (green) and ISAV s8ORF2 (red) in the cytosol, showing co-localisation. Pictures captured in confocal microscope at 63x magnification. Scale bar = 10 \u03bcM. Controls are untransfected cells immunostained with the same antibodies, and pictures were taken with the same intensity settings. The co-localisation was repeated thrice.

On co-transfecting s8ORF2 and SsMov10, in the GFP-reversal assay, we found enhanced GFP reversal compared to cells transfected individually with s8ORF2 or SsMov10 (Fig. 5c) , suggesting that SsMov10 may supplement the RNAi suppressor function of s8ORF2 endogenously. To support this hypothesis, we performed real-time qPCR experiments in infected TO cells. The physiological concentration of SsMov10 was estimated by real-time qPCR experiments, taking the EF factor as a control. These values were used as a reference for further analysis of correlation in the expression of the ISAV s8ORF2 protein with infection. However, these results should be supported and substantiated with siRNA-based silencing experiments (to silence endogenous SsMov10), but we were constrained due to the low transfection efficiency of TO cells, to carry out our experiments.",

It is evident in Fig. 6d (i) that the level of SsMov10 declines at about the end of viral replication cycle as well. These results suggest regulation of SsMov10 levels during the viral infection at 72 hpi (Fig. 5d (i) ). This could be the result of a constant check to prevent the protein from engaging in RISC Assembly, since the SsMov10 possesses RISC Assembly function [53] . Next, we analysed the effect of viral dose on SsMov10 transcript levels, which indicated a positive correlation of SsMov10 expression, at 12 hpi, the trend coherently visible even on increasing viral dose (Fig. 5d (ii) ). On increasing the viral titre successively by tenfold, there was an increased expression of SsMov10, in comparison with controls (not shown to avoid confusion). We observed a logarithmic scale turnover, in the values of SsMov10 expression, at least at mRNA levels. This trend leads us to hypothesise that a transcriptional control over SsMov10 (Fig. 6) , one of the crucial RNAi molecules, is present.",

The s8ORF2 protein was shown to bind to RNA in a dot-blot assay [8] . In the literature, RNA binding and interferon antagonism have been minimal requirements for recognition as a Viral Suppressor of RNAi protein. The viral protein which exhibits both functions has been shown to function as an RNAi suppressor as well, as identified for E3L of Vaccinia virus, followed by NS1 of Influenza A Virus and then Tat of HIV-1 [32, 56, 57] , where all these candidates exhibited both RNA binding and interferon antagonism. Consequently, with the leads of RNA-binding activity [8] and interferon antagonism [8, 58] , RNAi suppression was quite well studied. Therefore, the foremost goal was to identify the specificity of s8ORF2 binding. We have identified that s8ORF2 binds to siRNA as well as long RNA molecules, in the competitive EMSA experiments, in vitro. Here, we can speculate that it binds to the substrates of DICER and RISC in fish cells as well, presuming that this pathway is conserved in fish, similar to its conservation through plants, insects and mammals. We can warrant that since 22 bp and 300 bp are substrates to RNAi pathway, these RNA molecules point to site of s8ORF2's action [59] [60] [61] . The VSR protein binding to ds RNA would seize the input of ds RNA to DICER in the RNAi pathway (Fig. 6) , thereby paralysing the pathway, as is the case with VP35 (Ebola virus), NS1 (Influenza A virus), B2 (Nodamura virus) and E3L (Vaccinia virus).",

Thus, we proposed that these functions might exist as independent domains, and cloned three deletion mutants: the first, in which the N-terminal, predicted to be RNA-binding domain (\u0394NTD); second, the C-terminal predicted to cause dimerisation (\u0394CTD); and third, both N-and C-terminals were deleted (\u0394DD). Each of these deletion mutants was analysed for RNA binding, dimerisation and GFP-reversal activity. The RNA-binding activity was found to be focussed in the middle region (62-195 aa) . The dimerisation domain was found to be present in the C-terminal but was not responsible for the RNAisuppression activity. Therefore, we conclude that the RNAiinhibition-active domain is present in the middle region (62-195 aa) , which is doubly deleted for N-and C-terminals. It also has an Ago-binding GW motif at 114 GW 115 . The VSR polypeptides utilise this motif as a hook to seize the Ago-2 molecule and eventually RNAi pathway by selectively targeting host RNA for degradation and favouring vRNA for replication. This implied the presence of another host molecule interacting with s8ORF2, which provisionally aided it in countering the RNAi pathway.",

Since there is a modulation of SsMov10 expression, we predict the innate RNAi response getting stimulated analysed them bio-informatically from the protein library and performed yeast two-hybrid analysis by interacting with s8ORF2. SsMov10 was selected for further analysis, since it was the most studied and belonged to PTGS, whereas other molecules belonged to TGS. SsMov10 was found to interact with s8ORF2 in all the yeast two-hybrid assays, with the C-terminal domain responsible for the interaction. Yeast two-hybrid assay and confocal microscopy confirmed the interaction. Surprisingly, SsMov10 was found to exhibit RNAi-suppression activity.
