            "text": "The vaccine strategy during the inter-pandemic period is to prime the populations with a vaccine that offers some cross-protection against the pandemic virus until a \"perfect match\" pandemic vaccine can be made. However, the manufacture of pre-pandemic or pandemic vaccines by traditional methods, i.e., embryonated chicken egg-grown, may take up to 6 months. In addition, these traditional influenza vaccines are not very immunogenic and require heightened biosafety facilities and billions of embryonated eggs to manufacture enough vaccine doses to immunize high-risk individuals worldwide. Baculovirus-derived recombinant hemagglutinin (HA) protein from H5N1 viruses eliminates the need for the egg and biosafety requirements, but is not cost-effective and also has been shown to be poorly immunogenic ( Figure 1 ). 12 An alternative approach to generate an H5N1 vaccine seed virus without a need for high containment manufacturing facilities became possible with the advent of reverse genetics technology [13] [14] [15] [16] and the observation that the deletion of multibasic amino-acid cleavage site on the HA molecule did not affect antigenicity. Thus, the generation of candidate H5N1 vaccine strains, by reverse genetics, containing the modified HA and wild-type neuraminidase from the H5N1 virus and the remaining six genes from A/PuertoRico/8/34 became possible, and it was the first US Food and Drug Administration-approved egg-grown H5N1 reassortant vaccine. 17 This development has also facilitated generation of the coldadapted virus vaccine (Figure 1) , where a seasonal influenza virus, A/Ann Arbor/6/60, containing the modified HA and neuraminidase genes from an H5N1 virus is attenuated to enable limited replication, specifically in the upper airway and nasal passages. 18 However, these approaches still rely on an uninterrupted supply of embryonated eggs. As avian influenza viruses are highly lethal to chicken, ensuring the availability of embryonated eggs for vaccine production poses a major challenge. It should be noted that the current worldwide egg-grown influenza vaccine-manufacturing capacity operating at full capacity would also not be able to meet the demand. 19 To address these issues, dose-sparing strategies are being investigated to reduce the amount of antigen required to generate a robust immune response by the inclusion of adjuvants. 20, 21 Alternative egg-independent vaccine strategies outlined in Figure 1 are also being developed with a high degree of success in preclinical and clinical studies, namely mammalian cell-derived vaccines, viral vectors, recombinant proteins, virus-like particles, DNA vaccines, and passive immunization with a cocktail of monoclonal antibodies. 11, [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] The preferred profile for an effective pandemic vaccine should be safe and effective for all populations and health status, immunogenic preferably at low doses and with one administration, easily and inexpensively manufactured, effective against variant pandemic influenza viruses, induce both humoral and cellular immune responses, thermostable, and have a shelf life of over a year. As unadjuvanted vaccines do not meet many of these characteristics, the addition of adjuvants and adjuvant-independent strategies are being pursued. 20 Our group and others have developed a replication-deficient human adenoviral vector 5 (HAd) approach as a pandemic vaccine strategy. 27, 28 This vector approach has been used as a safe and effective vaccine strategy in preclinical and clinical studies for a number of infectious diseases, including human immunodeficiency virus, hepatitis B virus, measles, rabies, anthrax, Ebola, severe acute respiratory syndrome corona virus, and several forms of cancers. Furthermore, the Ad-vector approach has been shown to have an excellent safety profile in clinical trials. [40] [41] [42] This strategy eliminates the need for embryonated eggs required for virus growth, as well as the need for enhanced biosafety level 3 laboratories. The HAd vector can be grown to high titers in qualified cell lines in a short period of time and can overcome glycosylation issues, leading to better immunogenicity. Immunization by parenteral or mucosal routes leads to foreign gene expression without insertion of the HAd genome into the host's genome. Furthermore, the HAd vector engages the innate immune response by both Toll-like receptor-dependent and Toll-like receptor-independent pathways by targeting dendritic cells and macrophages, thus not requiring an adjuvant to engage both arms of the immune response. 43 As the HAd-vector delivery approach generates both humoral and cell-mediated immunity against the target disease, using this approach to generate an effective pandemic vaccine is a logical alternative to traditional egg-derived vaccines.",

This vaccine generated humoral immune responses against an antigenically similar virus, as well as CD8 \u00fe T-cell responses against the conserved HA518 epitope, which is conserved in nearly all human H5N1 viruses isolated since 1997, including human viruses isolated in 2007 (C.

Nevertheless, when these mice were challenged with a lethal dose of an antigenically similar virus A/Hong Kong/483/1997 (HK/ 483), all groups of mice were protected against death with the exception of groups that received either a vaccine dose of 10 5 PFU or an empty vector ( Figure 3a ). However, mice immunized with a vaccine dose of 10 6 PFU did show morbidity, with a weight loss of 12% on day 6 before fully recovering, whereas mice immunized with vaccine at >10 6 PFU doses exhibited little to no weight loss (Figure 3b). We have previously shown that HAd-H5HA vaccine induces CD8 + T-cell responses and confers protection against death even in the absence of neutralizing antibody responses against an antigenically distinct A/VN/1203/04 virus. 27 Hence, the protection conferred by the vaccine at 10 6 PFU dose may be due to CD8+ T cells and/or nonneutralizing antibodies through an antibody-dependent cellmediated cytotoxicity mechanism.",

Analysis of HA518 epitope specific CD8 + T cells indicates that the frequency of CD8+ T-cell responses at 56 weeks post-boost was similar to the levels induced at 4 weeks post-boost ( Figure 5 ). The frequencies of HA518 epitope-specific CD8 + T cells at 4 weeks post-boost were 1.07 and 1.08% for groups immunized by the i.m. or i.n. route, respectively, and at 56 weeks postimmunization they were 1.04 and 0.95%, respectively. Both groups had significant levels (P<0.001) of HA518 epitope specific CD8 + T cells as compared to the empty vector control groups. Nucleoprotein 147 (NP147) epitope-specific pentamer staining levels remained at background levels, indicating that the animals were not exposed to influenza viruses during the course of the study (data not shown). Following challenge with a lethal dose of HK/483 virus, all mice immunized with HAd-H5HA vaccine were protected and exhibited little or no morbidity, as indicated by weight loss (Figure 6 ). These data clearly indicate that HAd-H5HA vaccine generates long-lasting humoral and cellular immune responses and confers complete protection against lethal challenge even at 12 months post-immunization with no difference observed by route of immunization.",

            "text": "Since 2004, highly pathogenic avian influenza has been reported in birds in more than 60 countries, with 12 of those reporting human infections. 3, 4 More than 60% of the reported human cases have resulted in death. Current vaccines against seasonal influenza do not protect against the virulent strains of highly pathogenic avian influenza; thus, effective vaccines against highly pathogenic avian influenza are an urgent public health priority. 20 Previously, we found that 10 8 PFU of HAdH5HA was the optimal dose that generated protective immune responses determined by HI titers. Mice that received 10 6 PFU of vaccine had neutralizing antibodies and HI antibodies below the level of detection of the assays but still were completely protected, suggesting that protection against H5N1 lethal challenge in the absence of neutralizing antibodies or at levels below detection can be facilitated by other mechanisms, namely cell-mediated immunity or non-neutralizing and nonhemagglutinating antibodies, possibly by antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity. As this vaccine is administered by the i.m. route, mucosal antibodies do not play a role in protection. We have also shown earlier that although non-neutralizing antibodies play a role in the clearance of antigenically similar viruses, protection against antigenically distinct strains of influenza viruses requires cell-mediated immunity, namely cytotoxic T lymphocytes as well as antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity for protection. 49 Clinical trials involving traditional vaccine approaches have suggested that antibody responses generated by traditional vaccines in humans tend to wane and are not detectable 16 months post-immunization, but are detectable only after a booster immunization. 50 In the case of Advector vaccines, epitope-specific T cells generated against hepatitis C persisted in non-human primates for at least 12 months postimmunization, 51 and HAd-delivered herpes simplex virus (glycoprotein B (AdgB8))-induced specific antibodies and CD8+ T cells after i.n. vaccination were maintained for several months. 52 Similarly, antibody responses against p55gag antigen of simian immunodeficiency virus delivered by HAd were detectable 12 months postimmunization, whereas T-cell-specific responses were detectable for at least 6 months postimmunization in mice. 53 Schwartz et al. 54 have recently shown that protective immune responses against lethal challenge when vaccinated with a vesicular stomatitis virus vector expressing H5HA are detectable for at least 6.5 months post-boost in mice. Our data also show that humoral and cell-mediated immune responses induced by HAd-H5HA vaccine are detectable for at least 12 months post-immunization in mice. Pre-existing humoral immune responses to influenza will aid in preventing or limiting infection, whereas the pre-existing cell-mediated responses will aid in recovery or shortening the duration of illness. 49, 55 As both humoral and cellular immune responses induced by Ad-vector-based vaccine are long-lasting and cross-protective, the HAd-H5HA vaccine has the potential to confer protection against the drifted H5N1 variants.",

However, Leroux-Roels et al. have recently shown that an inactivated split A/ Vietnam/1194/2004 NIBRG-14 (recombinant H5N1 engineered by reverse genetics) egg-derived vaccine at a dose of 3.8 mg with a novel adjuvant system, ASO3, induced a fourfold increase in neutralization titers against clade 1 virus in 86% of the vaccines.
