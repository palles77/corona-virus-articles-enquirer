Methods: A retrospective observational study was performed in 23 French ICUs during the 2009 H1N1 pandemic. Levels of PCT at admission were compared between patients with confirmed influenzae A pneumonia associated or not associated with a bacterial co-infection. Results: Of 103 patients with confirmed A/H1N1 infection and not having received prior antibiotics, 48 (46.6%; 95% CI 37-56%) had a documented bacterial co-infection, mostly caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae (54%) or Staphylococcus aureus (31%). Fifty-two patients had PCT measured on admission, including 19 (37%) having bacterial co-infection. Median (range 25-75%) values of PCT were significantly higher in patients with bacterial co-infection: 29.5 (3.9-45.3) versus 0.5 (0.12-2) lg/l (P \\ 0.01). For a cut-off of 0.8 lg/l or more, the sensitivity and specificity of PCT for distinguishing isolated viral from mixed pneumonia were 91 and 68%, respectively. Alveolar condensation combined with a PCT level of 0.8 lg/l or more was strongly associated with bacterial co-infection (OR",

Causes of death included an overwhelming viral infection and primary or secondary bacterial infection. Because of the presumed high frequency of bacterial infection, most hospitalised patients with influenza pneumonia are administered antibiotics, even though bacterial co-infection is considered unlikely [2] . Indeed, bacterial pneumonia cannot be differentiated from viral pneumonia on the basis of the patients' characteristics, chest radiographic findings or routine laboratory results. Procalcitonin (PCT) is a recognised marker of bacterial infection and might be a prognostic marker in lower respiratory tract infections [3] . Few studies have assessed PCT levels in viral infections, except for paediatrics studies in which PCT was found to help distinguishing viral from bacterial meningitis [4] or pneumonia [5] . A small study in Singapore during the Coronavirus outbreak suggested that PCT remained at low levels in viral infections [6] .",

Thus, 103 patients formed the main cohort, of whom 48 (46.6%) had a documented bacterial co-infection associated with influenza A/H1N1v2009 infection (Table 1) . Microorganisms identified included Streptococcus pneumoniae (n = 26, 54%), Staphylococcus aureus (n = 13, 17%), group A Streptococcus (n = 4, 8%) and other microorganisms (n = 5, 11%).

Experience using biomarkers as an diagnostic adjunct during influenza pneumonia is very limited. Studies describing the ability of PCT or of CRP to discriminate between viral and bacterial infection have included few patients with influenza or severe disease [5] . A metaanalysis concluded that PCT was more accurate than CRP for the distinction between viral and bacterial infection [7] . Ingram et al. suggested that PCT levels assisted in the discrimination between severe lower respiratory tract infections of bacterial or A/H1N1 virus origin [8] .

This proportion may actually be underestimated because of the common administration of antibiotics prior to hospital or ICU admission. Overall, almost one-half of our patients had a documented bacterial co-infection, after excluding those having received prior antibiotics. This is clearly a much higher rate than that recorded during seasonal influenza [13] . Similarly to experience from Argentina [14] , the presence of bacterial co-infection was associated in our series with more severe disease.",

The 'true' proportion of patients with bacterial co-infection during influenza pneumonia is also difficult to ascertain. However, by excluding patients having received prior antibiotics, thus allowing a more accurate diagnosis of bacterial infection, we believe we have come closer to estimating the frequency and influence of bacterial co-infection in patients with severe influenza A/H1N1 pneumonia. PCT levels appear to discriminate well between patients having or not having bacterial coinfection during influenza pneumonia. Despite the small sample of patients in our series in whom both measurements of PCT and CRP were obtained, PCT levels appeared to more accurately discriminate viral from mixed viral and bacterial infection among patients presenting with community-acquired pneumonia of suspected viral origin during the influenza epidemic.",

Measurements of PCT levels at admission can help discriminate patients having bacterial co-infection from those with isolated viral pneumonia. Clinical trials from different settings have established that PCT can be safely used to help decide upon initiation and duration of antibiotic therapy, and thus potentially help to reduce antibiotic overuse [9, 15] . When combined with clinical judgment during influenza epidemics, a low PCT level may identify a subgroup of patients in whom empiric antibiotic therapy may be withheld or withdrawn early. ",
