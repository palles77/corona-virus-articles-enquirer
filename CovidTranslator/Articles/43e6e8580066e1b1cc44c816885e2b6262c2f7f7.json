Pneumonia accounts for 16% of all deaths of children under 5 years of age and was the cause of death of 935 000 children in 2015. Despite its frequency and severity, information regarding its etiology is limited. The aim of this study was to identify respiratory viruses associated with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) in children younger than 5 years old. Methods: One thousand four hundred and four children younger than 5 years of age with a clinical and/or radiological diagnosis of CAP in 11 hospitals in Mexico were included. Nasal washes were collected, placed in viral medium, and frozen at \u00c070 C until processing. The first 832 samples were processed using the multiplex Bio-Plex/Luminex system and the remaining 572 samples using the Anyplex multiplex RT-PCR. Clinical data regarding diagnosis, clinical signs and symptoms, radiographic pattern, and risk factors were obtained and recorded.",

Respiratory syncytial virus (types A and B) was found in 23.7%, human enterovirus/rhinovirus in 16.6%, metapneumovirus in 5.7%, parainfluenza virus (types 1-4) in 5.5%, influenza virus (types A and B) in 3.6%, adenovirus in 2.2%, coronavirus (NL63, OC43, 229E, and HKU1) in 2.2%, and bocavirus in 0.4%. Co-infection with two or more viruses was present in 22.1%; 18.4% of the samples were negative. Using biomass for cooking, daycare attendance, absence of breastfeeding, and co-infections were found to be statistically significant risk factors for the presence of severe pneumonia. Conclusions: Respiratory syncytial virus (types A and B), human enterovirus/rhinovirus, and metapneumovirus were the respiratory viruses identified most frequently in children younger than 5 years old with CAP. Co-infection was present in an important proportion of the children.",

            "text": "The viruses detected most frequently in the group of children under 5 years of age with lower respiratory infections in the present study were RSV types A and B (23.7%), enterovirus/ rhinovirus (16.5%), metapneumovirus (5.7%), PIV types 1-4 (5.5%), and influenza virus types A and B (3.6%). These results are similar to those reported by Jain et al. in a study involving children younger than 18 years of age with CAP requiring hospitalization in three hospitals in Memphis, Nashville, and Salt Lake City; the most commonly detected viruses were RSV (28%), human rhinovirus (27%), and metapneumovirus (13%) (Jain et al., 2015) . RSV has been reported previously as the most common respiratory pathogen in hospitalized children with lower respiratory infections (Noyola et al., 2004; Noyola et al., 2007) , as well as in children in the community (Manjarrez et al., 2003) . In the aforementioned study, performed in the state of Veracruz in outpatients with respiratory infections, the two most common pathogens were RSV (detected in 19.6% of patients) and rhinovirus (detected in 17.5%), followed by PIV (10.5%), influenza (10.4%), coronavirus (8.7%), adenovirus (7.2%), enterovirus (5.9%), metapneumovirus (5.3%), and bocavirus (2.5%) (Wong-Chew et al., 2015) . In a recent study of children hospitalized with respiratory tract infections and respiratory distress at the Instituto Nacional de Enfermedades Respiratorias (Mexico City), viral infections were detected in 59.7% of 432 enrolled patients, with human rhinovirus being the most frequently detected (76, 26.6%). Other viruses included influenza A virus in 27, RSV in 51, PIV in seven, adenovirus in six, and metapneumovirus in 13 (Moreno-Valencia et al., 2015) . One limitation of the present study is that the xTAG multiplex RT-PCR method does not differentiate between rhinovirus and enterovirus, so the potential role of rhinoviruses could be overestimated with the enterovirus detections added.",

Although some characteristics of the study populations are different (such as the recruitment time and age distribution), the higher percentage of co-infections in patients with pneumonia compared with upper respiratory infections in the Veracruz study, might suggest that co-infections cause more severe disease, suggesting complementary interaction among these viruses. This is also suggested by the multivariate analysis, in which it was found that co-infections are a risk factor for severe pneumonia. These observations are consistent with those of other authors who have reported RSV co-infections to be associated with a more severe disease than infections caused by a single virus (Harada et al., 2013) . However, whether the viral detection in nasal washes reflects the pathogen responsible for the lower respiratory disease or only reflects a nasopharyngeal commensal or asymptomatic infection is not known with certainty, particularly when highly sensitive molecular methods are used (Jansen et al., 2011) .",

One of the advantages of current molecular techniques is the high sensitivity to detect multiple pathogens. On the other hand, interpretation of the results provided by these assays requires further examination. Because of the increasing detection of some viruses, particularly rhinoviruses, coronaviruses, and bocavirus in patients with pneumonia, their specific contribution to lower respiratory tract infections needs to be evaluated. A recent study compared the frequency of detection of respiratory viruses in patients with CAP to the frequency of detection in asymptomatic subjects (Self et al., 2016) . RSV, human metapneumovirus, and influenza virus were notably more frequent in children with CAP (26.6%, 15.1%, and 3.4%, respectively) than in asymptomatic children (1.9%, 1.5%, and 0%, respectively) (Self et al., 2016) . In contrast, there were less striking differences in the detection of rhinoviruses (21.9% vs. 17.3% in patients with pneumonia and asymptomatic subjects, respectively) and coronaviruses (4.5% and 1.5% in patients with pneumonia and asymptomatic subjects, respectively). In fact, after multivariate regression analysis, rhinoviruses were found not to be significantly associated with the presence of pneumonia (Self et al., 2016) . Similar results have been reported by others, who have detected respiratory viruses in a large proportion of children without pneumonia (Zar et al., 2016; Rhedin et al., 2015) .",

In this study, in addition to the presence of co-infection, an association was found between other factors and the risk of severe pneumonia: lack of breastfeeding, use of biomass for cooking, and daycare attendance. Lack of breastfeeding and indoor air pollution have consistently been associated with severe lower respiratory tract infection and were considered as definite risk factors in a meta-analysis published in 2013 (Jackson et al., 2013) . In that report, parental smoking showed inconsistent results among studies and was considered as a likely risk factor for severe infection. In the present study it showed a protective effect, although there is no apparent explanation for this finding. Finally, daycare attendance was sporadically reported in association with severe infections and was considered a possible risk factor. Inadequate breastfeeding, indoor pollution, and second-hand smoke exposure have also been found to be risk factors for mortality in children with acute lower respiratory infections (Sonego et al., 2015) .",
