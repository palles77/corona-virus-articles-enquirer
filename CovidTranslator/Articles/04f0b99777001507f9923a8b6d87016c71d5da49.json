Today CPV-2a is most common in Europe while CPV-2b represents cu 80% of current field isolates in the United States'. In puppies this virus replicates in mitotic cells'j.' and is transmitted by the fecal-oral route causing a fulminating enteric disease. Initial infection most likely occurs in the tonsil, however, the virus rapidly spreads to other lymphoid tissues and to crypt cells in the gut'. Crypt cell death and erosion of the enteric lining results in the vomiting and diarrhea characteristic of this disease. Protection in very young puppies is mainly by passive transfer of maternal antibody to offspring. However, as maternal antibody declines, puppies become highly susceptible to infection. Susceptibility to parvovirus infection often coincides with the time that puppies are separated from the dam, significantly increasing their risk of exposure'.",

When combined with an automated total white cell count this information may yield more powerful, less variable analysis of cell surface proteins and leukocyte trafficking. Similarly, the acute phase response is well known as a nonspecific response to pathogenic injury14. Despite the nonspecific nature of this response, recent evidence has shown that the stimulus for production of acute phase proteins by the liver is a tightly regulated response to cytokines such as interleukin-1 (IL-l) and IL-6 which are released soon after infection15m17. In addition, the productlon of specific antibody reagents has fostered the development of quantitative assays increasing the accuracy and specificity of detecting acute phase reactants. Thus, elevated levels of one or more of these pro-inflammatory proteins may be predictive of clinical infection and disease. Elevated levels of IL-6, u-l acid glycoprotein (a-l AG), and serum amyloid A (SAA) have been described in association with acute as well as chronic diseases\"-*'.

It was crucial to the success of these studies to determine whether these parameters correlated with traditional signs of the clinical disease. Thus, it was necessary for the CPV2b challenge virus used in this experiment to elicit severe clinical signs allowing clear association of each nontraditional parameter with clinical signs and virus shed. Elevated a-1AG and SAA levels occurred at the same time that puppies developed clinical signs and virus appeared in feces. Furthermore, the quantity of a-1AG or SAA measured in individual samples correlated with the severity of clinical signs and virus shed. Peak a-1AG levels coincided with the drop in total leukocytes on day 7. Only one puppy did not have elevated levels of either a-1AG or SAA post-challenge. This puppy died 6 days post-challenge and showed other signs of infection (i.e. lymphopenia, virus shed, and a drop in neutrophil-CD4 expression). The other two puppies had a delayed response to virus challenge. They did not show clinical signs until days 6 and 7 post-challenge, and virus shed did not begin until day 8, at which time SAA levels became elevated. Thus, in these instances, elevated production of acute phase proteins closely followed the appearance of virus shed in feces and development of clinical signs. When everything is considered, these data demonstrate that after CPV-2b challenge, elevated production of a-1AG or SAA, as well as changes in CD6neutrophil expression, correlate with and provide quantifiable indicators of virus infection and clinical disease.",

There is no known function for CD4 on neutrophils, and the significance of a change in level of neutrophil CD4 expression in this disease is unknown. However, the changes in CD4 expression and cell trafficking of neutrophils observed after CPV challenge implicate a role for these cells in pathogenesis of CPV disease. The significance of these changes should be emphasized considering that alterations in CD4 expression were observed only after viral infection, and that vaccination protected from these effects. It is also noteworthy that among the parameters evaluated in this study, the loss of neutrophil-CD4 expression was one of the most consistent findings and occurred in all the nonvaccinated controls, and only in one vaccinate. Several possibilities could account for the loss of CD4 and for the neutrophilia/neutropenia pattern observed in the controls. One possibility is a direct effect of CPV infection on bone marrow neutrophil precursor maturation. Changes in homeostasis may have resulted in export of immature neutrophils into circulation32. In support of this claim is the neutrophilia present at the time that CD4-neutrophil expression was low, however, the visual cell differential analysis did not reveal an increase in immature (band) neutrophils to account for the observed neutrophilia, and neutrophilia was observed in several vaccinates in the absence of any CD4modulation.",
