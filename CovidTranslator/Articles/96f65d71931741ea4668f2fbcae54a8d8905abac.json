The 2019 novel coronavirus (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome ) caused a pneumonia outbreak originating in Wuhan, China, which is spreading around the country and has affected 32 provinces and regions of China as of January 27, 2020 [3, 4] . . Countries outside China, including Japan, the United States, Thailand, and South Korea, have also reported cases imported from Wuhan, China. With the joint efforts of Chinese scientists, health workers, and related departments, the pathogen causing this epidemic was quickly identified as a new type of coronavirus, 10 days after the first official report. After confirming the pathogen, specific detection methods were rapidly developed, with improvement in etiological diagnosis. As of January 22, 2020, it has been confirmed that the new coronavirus came from wild bats and belonged to group 2b of the beta coronavirus, which includes severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) [5] . . Although SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV belong to the same subgroup of beta coronaviruses, the similarity at the genome level is only 70%, meaning that the new virus is genetically different from SARS-CoV [ Figure 1A , http://links.lww.com/CM9/A209].",

Therefore, the epidemic laws and characteristics of the SARS outbreak and the painful lessons we learned in responding to the epidemic are of great value currently and in the future. Due to concerns about controlling the impact of the epidemic and the relatively less developed information exchange tools of that time, the early epidemics and characteristics of the early SARS cases were not reported. However, as we had participated in the epidemiological investigations of early SARS cases in 2003, we had collected important data about the early stages of the outbreak. Using these valuable data, we analyzed the characteristics of the early SARS cases and the progression of the outbreak. By comparing the epidemic situations of the two outbreaks, we found some strikingly similar characteristics and trends, providing lessons for better responses to the present and future epidemics.",

Several days later, seven medical staff members in the department that treated these patients developed symptoms. Retrospective investigation found that a hospital in subsequently, five family members also developed symptoms. This indicated that SARS-CoV emerged with high human-to-human transmission capability, characterized by familial and medical staff infections [7, 8] . . An investigation of family clustering identified 35 clusters involving 105 patients, in families with two or more family members in Guangzhou. The largest cluster was derived from a female patient. A total of 91 persons were infected due to visiting or nursing the female patient, and two of these people died [ Figure 1C , http://links.lww.com/CM9/A209]. This indicated that the super virus spreader emerged at the earliest stage of the outbreak, confirming the high infection capability of the virus [9, 10] . . Subsequent case investigations also showed that SARS-CoV had the capability to multiply and continuously undergo human-to-human transmission [ Figure 1D ]; at least four generations of cases were identified from one original patient. Among the clusters of cases, healthcare workers were common victims. As of April 13, 2003, a total of 48 medical institutions had medical staff with SARS-CoV infection, and 33 medical institutions in Guangzhou reported a total of 283 cases. The incidence among medical staff in the respiratory care department of a university affiliated hospital in Guangzhou was 61.7%",

Five days later, clusters of cases, including 15 healthcare workers, were confirmed to have been infected via patients, confirming that SARS-CoV-2 also has human-to-human transmission capability [ Figure 1E ]. Based on these results, it was concluded that SARS-CoV-2 also has high human-to-human transmission capability. It remains unclear whether earlier cases also showed this capability, and if so, how many victims were not identified. The close contacts of these unidentified patients might act as new infection sources and could become superspreaders.",

After discovering the earliest case identified on Nov 16, 2002, the incidence remained low until Jan 2, 2003. The peak of the incidence was observed between Jan 3 and Feb 4, 2003 , and the number of cases accounted for 54.7% of the total cases. According to the case numbers and the developmental characteristics, the SARS epidemic can be roughly divided into four stages: stage 1, from Nov 16, 2002 to Jan 31, 2003 ; stage 2, from Feb 1 to Mar 2, 2003 ; stage 3, from Mar 3 to Apr 2; and stage 4, after Apr 4 [ Figure 1F ]. Coincidentally, the SARS outbreak duration also coincided with the Chinese spring festival. Each year, the Chinese government launches a 40-day spring festival transport support system, and during this period, billions of people migrate around China. In 2003, the spring festival transport period started from Jan 17 to Feb 25, 2020 and coincided with the peak incidence [ Figure 1F , purple box]. The spring festival travel period in 2020 started from Jan 10 to Feb 18, which coincided with the rapid increase in SARS-CoV-2 cases between Jan 10 and 22, 2020 [ Figure 1F , red box]. Both outbreaks happened in the winter, when the two provinces have similar climate patterns suitable for virus survival and spread. Temperature and weather are risk factors of natural infectious diseases, and those in Wuhan and Guangzhou seem to be suitable for disease transmission. Given previous trends, this is unlikely to be the incidence peak of this new virus outbreak. The daily counts of SARS-CoV-2 cases were higher than the daily counts of SARS cases during its peak in 2003, implying a possibly higher number of cumulative cases. We analyzed the transportation between different and large cities. High frequency transportation is mainly distributed among megacities [ Figure 1G ]. The highest ranked cities include Beijing, Guangzhou, and Shanghai.",

Since SARS-CoV-2 is highly similar to SARS-CoV, some important characteristics of SARS-CoV could be used for this prediction. By combining the reported daily counts of SARS-CoV-2 cases and data from the SARS outbreak, we constructed a logistic model and predicted the incidence of SARS-CoV-2 over time. During the 2003 SARS outbreak, a total of 8000 cases were reported. With this data and the present situation, we predict that the cumulative number of SARS-CoV-2 cases might be 60,000-70,000. Logistic models were fitted to these data, and the cumulative and daily counts of SARS-CoV-2 cases were predicted. As shown in Figure 1I -1J, we also calculated the time needed to reach the peak of incidence under different scenarios. Setting the upper limit of cumulative incidence (K) to 50,000, 60,000, or 70,000, the end date of incidences will be in 56 days (Mar 6, 2020), 60 days (Mar 10, 2020), or 62 days (Mar 12, 2020), respectively.",

Fortunately, the Chinese government is implementing many efficient measures, including shutting down public transportation in Wuhan and other cities, reducing population migration, and encouraging personal protection such as mask-wearing. With these measures, case numbers could be reduced significantly. However, due to the lack of awareness regarding the human-to-human transmission capability of SARS-CoV-2 in the early stages, there is a possibility that superspreaders exist. These super-spreaders may be distributed in different places and are difficult to track. This represents the most important problem for this outbreak.",
