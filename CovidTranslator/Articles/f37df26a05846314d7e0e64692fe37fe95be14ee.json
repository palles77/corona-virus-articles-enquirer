            "text": "Chemokines and their receptors function in the recruitment and activation of cells of the immune system to sites of inflammation. As such, chemokines play an important role in mediating pathophysiological events during microbial infection. In particular, CXCL9, 10 and 11 and their cognate receptor CXCR3 have been associated with the clinical course of several infectious diseases, including severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and influenza. While CXCL9, 10 and 11 share the same receptor and have overlapping functions, each can also have unique activity in host defense. The lack of a preferred characterized animal model for SARS has brought our attention to ferrets, which have been used for years in influenza studies. The lack of immunological reagents for ferrets prompted us to clone CXCL9, 10, 11 and CXCR3 and, in the case of CXCL10, to express the gene as a recombinant protein. In this study we demonstrate that endogenous ferret CXCL10 exhibits similar mRNA expression patterns in the lungs of deceased SARS patients and ferrets experimentally infected with SARS coronavirus. This study therefore represents an important step towards development of the ferret as a model for the role of CXCL9, 10 and 11:CXCR3 axis in severe viral infections.",

            "text": "The CXCL9 (MIG), CXCL10 (IP-10), and CXCL11 (I-TAC) chemokines, along with their cognate receptor CXCR3 participate in the development and regulation of Th1 responses. The expression of CXCL9, 10, and 11 can be induced in virtually all cell types by a variety of stimulants including IFN-\u03b3, TLR activation and viral infection (Cameron and Kelvin 2003; Farber 1997; Rossi and Zlotnik 2000) . There is evidence in the literature that strongly suggests that CXCL10 is an important regulator of Th1 polarized immune responses (Krathwohl and Anderson 2006) , and that, in some instances, the CXCL9, 10 and 11:CXCR3 axis can generate pathological inflammatory conditions (Liu et al. 2001; Qin et al. 1998; Ruth et al. 2001; Sorensen and Ransohoff 1998) . While several reports have identified an increased expression of CXCL9 or CXCL10 following viral infection in animal models or humans (Cameron et al. 2007a; Christen et al. 2004; Dufour et al. 2002; Liu et al. 2001; Ruth et al. 2001) , the role of these chemokines and their receptor CXCR3 in the development of ARDS (acute respiratory distress syndrome)-like diseases associated with pathogenic pulmonary viral infections is unknown. Support for a role of this subfamily of chemokines in SARS comes from observations by ourselves and other groups showing a correlation between increased systemic levels of CXCL10 in SARS coronavirus (SARS CoV) (Cameron et al 2007b; Cheung et al. 2005; Tang et al. 2005 ) and H5N1-infected individuals (Peiris et al. 2004) , as well as chronically elevated levels of systemic expression of CXCL10 in patients with poor outcome post-infection (Cameron et al. 2007b; Tang et al. 2005) .",

Cynomolgus macaques (Macaca fascicularis) fail to show clinical symptoms following infection with SARS CoV, despite viral replication in the species (Marshall and Enserink 2004; Martina et al. 2003) . In mice, the SARS CoV replicates well, but the value of the model as representative of the human condition has been debated due to rapid clearance of the virus and the absence of clinical symptoms (Glass et al. 2004) . In contrast, SARS CoV replicates well in ferrets with infected animals demonstrating a number of clinical manifestations similar to those seen in humans, such as lethargy and elevated body temperature (Martina et al. 2003) . Furthermore, SARS CoV infected ferrets display histological evidence of pneumonitis, and a certain degree of mortality has been reported, which is also consistent with the human disease (Marshall and Enserink 2004; Martina et al. 2003) . Replication of SARS CoV occurs both in the upper and lower respiratory tract, and development of ARDS-like disease also occurs in some patients (Ng et al. 2006; Ye et al. 2007 ). Diarrhea has been reported in a portion of cases of human H5N1 infection, and was also noted in many infected ferrets (Sidwell and Smee 2000; Sweet C 1980; Zitzow et al. 2002) .",

Each gene was amplified by primers designed from consensus sequences derived from multiple nucleotide sequence alignments among various species. In the case of CXCL10, the full-length coding region was not fully sequenced due to the lack of sequence conservation at the 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 end of the coding region. To address this issue, sequences upstream and downstream of the open reading frame were sequenced by RNA ligase mediated rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RLM-RACE) (data not shown). For CXCR3, we amplified and sequenced a partial cDNA within the coding region. As expected, the predicted full-length amino acid sequences for ferret CXCL9, CXCL10, CXCL11 (126, 98 and 94 amino acids respectively) and the predicted partial CXCR3 sequence (229 out of 368 amino acids) show significant homology to corresponding sequences in various other species ( Figure 1A -D). Phylogenetic analysis was performed using ClustalW and phylogenetic trees constructed using protein parsimony with a bootstrap value of 100. The ferret nucleotide sequences were translated to amino acid sequences using \"Translate\" (ExPASy, proteomics). Amino acid sequences of other species were obtained from Genbank (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Genbank).

Therefore our CXCL10 induced chemotaxis data conformed to a classical bell-shaped chemotaxis dose-response curve, and was consistent with previous reports for recombinant human CXCL9 (Liao et al. 1995) and recombinant human IL-8 (Xu et al. 1995) .

Initially, we set out to validate the specificity of the primers and then aimed to test whether CXCL9, 10 and 11 transcription is induced in ferret blood cells upon LPS treatment. Quantitative real-time PCR on cDNA derived from ferret whole blood stimulated with LPS was performed and demonstrated that CXCL9, CXCL10 and CXCL11 mRNA expression was induced at various times following LPS treatment relative to unstimulated control cDNA. The peak increase for CXCL9 (3-fold above unstimulated control, P<0.05) and CXCL11 (greater than 8-fold above unstimulated control, P<0.01) occurred at 4 hours post-stimulation, while for CXCL10 the peak increase (60-fold above unstimulated control, P<0.01) occurred at 2 hours following LPS treatment (Figure 4) .",

Previous work has shown that CXCL10 mRNA expression is strongly up-regulated in conjunction with CXCR3 in mice infected with Lymphocytic Choriomeningitis Virus (LCMV), particularly in the pancreas and at early stages of infection (Christen et al. 2004 ). More recently, it has demonstrated that LCMV infection of the murine central nervous system (CNS) is associated with CXCL9 and CXCL11 up-regulation (Christensen et al. 2006) . Several animal models have shown that inflammation-based pathology induced by viral infections can be reduced by either neutralization of chemokines or blockade of their receptor (Carr et al. 2003; Dawson et al. 2000; Xie et al. 2003) . Treatment of spontaneously diabetic NOD mice with CXCL10 neutralizing antibodies suppressed the incidence of diabetes (Shigihara et al. 2005) . In the MHV mouse model of encephalitis, neutralization of CXCL9 or CXCL10 (or in CXCL10null mice) resulted in reduced neuropathology despite increased viral load (Dufour et al. 2002; Liu et al. 2001 ).",

Biologically active recombinant purified CXCL10 protein has been prepared and will be utilized immediately in a number of in vitro and in vivo assays.

The chemoattractant CXCL10, which recruits mainly Th1 cells and NK cells to the site of infection, was markedly increased in SARS (Cameron et al. 2007b) . Furthermore, the depletion of lymphocyte subsets from peripheral blood (unpublished data) might be partly due to the influence of CXCL10 in that up-regulation of CXCL10 in the lung might be influential in the recruitment and sequestration of lymphocyte subsets to the site of infection. This in turn may lead to severe pathological consequences as described in a number of viral infections including SARS and bird flu (Ng et al. 2006 ).",

The full length putative protein sequences obtained for A) ferret CXCL9, CXCL10, CXCL11 and B) partial putative protein sequence of ferret CXCR3 were aligned with all available orthologues from cow, dog, human, mouse, rat, pig and frog using ClustalW 1.83, and phylogenetic trees constructed using protein parsimony with a bootstrap value of 100. All chemokines cluster specifically within their orthologous groups. Accession numbers: CXCL9: NP_663705, NP_032625, NP_002407, XP_591770 Ferret peripheral blood was stimulated with 0.1 mg/ml LPS for the time points indicated. Utilizing primers specific for the ferret CXCL9, CXCL10, and CXCL11 genes, mRNA expression was quantified. The Y-axis indicates the abundance of mRNA after stimulation with LPS compared to untreated samples. Treatment time is indicated by X-axis. Error bars indicate the SD of the relative quantities of the triplicates. Quantity readings of triplicates at each time point are compared with quantity readings of unstimulated triplicates, using student's t test. The peak increases for CXCL9 and CXCL11 occurred at 4 hours poststimulation (P<0.05 and P<0.01 respectively), while for CXCL10 was at 2 hours following LPS treatment (P<0.01). Danesh et al.
