Over the last few years, researchers have advanced the mathematical theory of scale-free networks and used such theoretical advancements in pilot epidemic models. Scale-free contact networks are particularly interesting in the realm of mathematical epidemiology, primarily because these networks may allow meaningfully structured populations to be incorporated in epidemic models at moderate or intermediate levels of complexity. Moreover, a scale-free contact network with node degree correlation is in accord with the well-known preferred mixing concept. The present author describes a semi-empirical and deterministic epidemic modeling approach that (a) focuses on time-varying rates of disease transmission in both unstructured and structured populations and (b) employs probability density functions to characterize disease progression and outbreak controls. Given an epidemic curve for a historical outbreak, this modeling approach calls for Monte Carlo calculations (that define the average new infection rate) and solutions to integro-differential equations (that describe outbreak dynamics in an aggregate population or across all network connectivity classes). Numerical results are obtained for the 2003 SARS outbreak in Taiwan and the dynamical implications of timevarying transmission rates and scale-free contact networks are discussed in some detail.",

Even if effective countermeasures are available, a failure to completely contain a contagious disease may give rise to a far-reaching epidemic with considerable social disruption and economic impact. Both civilian and military homeland biodefense planners are thus faced with a broad spectrum of contagious disease threats and a sound conceptual framework is necessary to shape and plan threat responses. Arguably, well-designed epidemic modeling studies can contribute significantly to such a conceptual framework.",

Assuming an unstructured population and the standard incidence, disease transmission occurs by means of homogeneous mixing, where each contagious individual is free to contact and infect any susceptible individual. But if the population is structured according to cultural, socio-economic, demographic or geographic factors, there is a mixing matrix that constrains opportunities for disease-causing contacts. Proportionate and preferred mixing matrices have enhanced the explanatory and predictive powers of epidemic models since the late 1980s [6] .

This power law is associable with network evolution or growth. More specifically, in contrast to classical random graphs, a scale-free network is a growing open system that accommodates a new node by attaching it to certain preexisting network nodes. The growth process for a scale-free network gives rise to another distinguishing feature, correlated degrees of connected nodes [9] .

In their network-based SI, SIS and SIR analyses, Barthelemy and coauthors routinely assumed an unbounded total population and employed a uniform initial condition (forcing all node degree or connectivity classes to be initially infected at the same level); additionally, they concentrated on an epidemic's exponential growth phase. The principal finding of these analyses is that, once high connectivity classes become infected, a cascade of infection occurs and affects lower and lower connectivity classes over time. Lastly, with regard to a non-uniform initial condition, the investigators found that confining all initially infected individuals to a single high-connectivity class would lead to an outbreak involving a faster rise and a faster invasion of the network.",

Ying-Hen Hsieh at the National Chung Hsing University (along with colleagues at other universities and government organizations in Taiwan) co-authored some interesting descriptive and analytical papers dealing with the Taiwan SARS outbreak. Hsieh and colleagues used SARS hospitalization and fatality data spanning one month (May 5 through June 4, 2003) to obtain parameter values for an epidemic model (i.e., a system of ordinary DEs) without quarantine or hospital isolation [24] . Subsequently, these researchers included a two-level quarantine and hospital isolation in another system of ordinary DEs and they performed a stability analysis that identified necessary quarantine rates for outbreak containment [25] .",

In their study of SARS transmission and control in China, Zhou, Ma and Brauer assumed an inexhaustible supply of susceptible individuals, formulated a system of linear difference equations, and followed a process of trial and error in obtaining a time-varying transmission rate that enabled the model to closely match data on diagnosed cases per day [26] . A more complex model of the SARS outbreak in China was later put forward by Zhang, Lou, Ma and Wu [27] . These authors first quantified their 'basic adequate contact rate' using about three weeks of data on diagnosed SARS cases and then they obtained model results for the daily number of SARS patients (in good agreement with epidemiological data). Lastly, Gumel and co-authors studied a system of ordinary DEs with constant parameters and the chosen values of the two free parameters (transmission rates for contacts involving contagious individuals within and without hospital isolation) provided the 'best' agreement between calculated and reported cumulative SARS fatalities over time. After obtaining values of the two free parameters for four SARS outbreaks (Toronto, Hong Kong, Singapore and Beijing), calculations of cumulative probable cases over time generally conformed to reported data for each outbreak [28] .",

In other words, even though an epidemic model is capable of emulating a particular temporal feature of an outbreak, this does not mean that the underlying modeling approach is necessarily a systematic or suitable vehicle for analyzing outbreak dynamics on the whole. To examine the relative value of the proposed epidemic models of intermediate complexity, the present author also formulates and numerically evaluates a parallel or companion system of ordinary DEs.",

But the Center for Disease Control in Taiwan later published separate epidemic curves for both probable and laboratory-confirmed SARS cases [30] . Only 346 probable SARS cases were confirmed through laboratory testing. Arguably, the true number of SARS cases in Taiwan could have been larger (even substantially larger) than 346. As a consequence, an epidemic curve representing a total of 671 probable onsets in Taiwan is deemed to be adequate for our modeling purposes. One way of inferring new infections from symptom onsets is to uniformly shift these onsets backward in time according to the mean latent period. On the other hand, the Monte Carlo method is a more rigorous way to obtain average new infections per day. A useful Monte Carlo algorithm is straightforward and a single trial involves a tractable number of computations. First, obtain random latent periods for all onsets of illness (excluding the index case). Second, backtrack in time to determine when all infections began. And third, compile the total score for each time step. Averaging scores per day for a large number of Monte Carlo trials yields the desired infections per day.",

An early detection of symptoms or a later clinical diagnosis can trigger hospital isolation in the basic epidemic model. In other words, the hospital isolation sub-compartment, X I , accommodates initial and follow-on case-patients who are identified by either tracing activities or clinicians. Generally, a case-patient stays in hospital isolation until he or she is no longer contagious; the patient then continues to receive medical care for some period of time (ending in hospital discharge or death). During the 2003 SARS outbreaks, efforts to isolate contagious people were not always successful. Nevertheless, in the model, everyone with a case of SARS is eventually admitted to a hospital and each case-patient within the X I sub-compartment is assumed to be adequately isolated during the contagious period. The model does allow people with undiagnosed cases of SARS (who are outside the X I sub-compartment) to infect other individuals (who may be in hospitals or elsewhere).",

The conditional probability of infection could vary during an epidemic or outbreak if, for example, the disease-causing microorganism mutates and becomes more or less able to overcome the host's defensive mechanisms. Even in the absence of mutations, changes in environmental conditions might alter a microorganism's infectivity. Similarly, an actual rate of adequate contacts is likely to fluctuate with day-to-day human activities, imposed restrictions on these activities (e.g., quarantine) and a growing public awareness of an ongoing outbreak.

A 'pool' of red pixels (k 6 2 and j 6 12) and a few more red pixels along the connectivity class is relatively small, then the magnitude of the early spike is relatively large. Regarding the lower four graphs and a fixed location (j SEED = 3) of the initial infection, previously-considered values of e engender four time histories of the new infection rate in each connectivity class. In the 3rd (100th) connectivity class, lower (higher) values of the combinative mixing parameter produce higher (lower) peak values of the new infection rate. These influences of the combinative mixing parameter are consistent with curves in the lower graph of Fig. 4 . Fig. 6 does not reveal a cascade of infection affecting lower and lower connectivity classes over time. However, Fig. 7 displays new infection rates in very high connectivity classes (j = 300, 500 and 700) that are compatible with the concept of an infection cascade. More specifically, the maximum new infection rate in the 700th (500th) connectivity class precedes the peak rate in the 500th (300th) connectivity class. Perhaps it's worth noting again that sizes of very high connectivity classes are minuscule in our network-based model.",

Most importantly, under certain constraints, dynamical impacts of parameter variations in the basic epidemic model will also be aggregate dynamical impacts of the same parameter variations in the network-based model. The main constraint calls for maintaining the correspondence of transmission rates in the two models. A variation of parameters in Table 1 , for example, may significantly alter the dynamics of the Taiwan outbreak through changes in the disease transmission rate, which could be derived anew using the basic or network-based model. Alternatively, variations of parameters in Table 2 could be explored by utilizing either model with the appropriate previously-derived rate of disease transmission. In bringing this section of the paper to a close, quantitative results from the basic epidemic model elucidate changes in outbreak dynamics due to variations of selected parameters in Tables 1 and 2 .",

One parameter that accounts for the effectiveness of both contact tracing activities and medical surveillance is the proportion (u 2 ) of follow-on infections entering hospital isolation upon symptom onset. A reasonable estimate of u 2 for the Taiwan outbreak is 45/670, which appears in Table 2 and comes from published information on probable cases and quarantine. To assess how the Taiwan outbreak would have been altered by larger values of u 2 , the basic epidemic model is implemented with a single 'underlying' transmission rate. (See the red curve in the lower graph of Fig. 9 .) Calculated time histories of new infection rates and compartmental populations appear in Fig. 11 for four values of u 2 (45/670, 90/670, 135/670 and 180/670). Unsurprisingly, more effective contact tracing and medical surveillance could have substantially reduced the total number of infections and the total number of deaths. The proportion (u 1 ) of multiple initial infections entering hospital isolation upon symptom onset is another parameter dealing with contact tracing and medical surveillance. In the event of a single initial infection and a new emerging infectious disease, the prompt isolation of the index case-patient is unlikely and a null value of u 1 is appropriate. But multiple individuals who are simultaneously infected with a familiar pathogen would have different incubation periods and sufficient information may be at hand to promptly identify and isolate some of the index case-patients. The basic epidemic model with one underlying transmission rate is readily implemented for multiple initial infections and non-zero values of u 1 . Fig. 12 contains time histories of new infection rates and compartmental populations for 10 initial infections and three non-zero u 1 values (0.2, 0.4 and 0.6). In terms of the total number of infections and the total number of deaths, the potential benefits of quickly finding initially infected individuals are also large.",

Fig. 7 thus implies that individuals in very high connectivity classes can become infected well before those individuals in somewhat lower connectivity classes. But the upper four graphs in Fig. 6 suggest that the first generation of follow-on infections emerges by D + 25. (As the degree of the initial infection gets smaller and drops below 30 or so, the total number of infections in that connectivity class gets large and the first generation of follow-on infections becomes harder to identify.) After the first generation of follow-on infections, the upper half of Fig. 6 reveals remarkably similar exponential phases and general wave shapes for all four locations of the initial infection. And lastly, keeping the initial infection in the 3rd connectivity class, the lower half of Fig. 6 shows that different values of the combinative mixing parameter primarily affect magnitudes (rather than exponential phases) of new infection rates.

The common analytical framework for these two models assures congruence at the level of aggregate compartmental populations. Whereas the basic epidemic model is efficient in assessing the general dynamical impacts of disease progression and outbreak control parameter variations, the network-based model provides insights into disease transmission within and between connectivity classes. Both models were designed to support the development and/or evaluation of biodefense scenarios, requirements and investment alternatives. It's also worth emphasizing that biodefense investment decisions must often be made years before the formulation and implementation of new outbreak control strategies.",

Perhaps more importantly, in establishing biodefense requirements and making biodefense investment decisions, retrospective questions ('what would have happened if. . .') deserve as much attention as questions about possible future events ('what will happen if. . .'). Historical outbreaks are obviously tied to particular settings and epidemiological circumstances that may or may not appear again in future outbreaks. Nevertheless, sound analyses and interpretations of historical outbreak dynamics could play a stronger supporting role in the biodefense planning process.",

In reconstructing a primary pneumonic plague outbreak, for instance, log normal PDFs should be good choices for characterizing the progression of primary pneumonic plague infections and the insertion of these PDFs in the above models is an easy first step. On the other hand, determining a suitable scale-free contact network for primary pneumonic plague and getting enough data to evaluate the key parameters (Tables 1 and 2 ) could be more challenging tasks. It is interesting to note that the projection of respiratory droplets within a radius of 2 m or so is the main mechanism for transmitting both SARS and primary pneumonic plague from person to person. If the scale-free network in this paper is a reasonable vehicle for analyzing SARS transmission, then this same network might also be helpful in understanding primary pneumonic plague transmission.",

The two dimensionless parameters in the foregoing equation are k V , the average number of vaccinated people per case-patient, and e V or the vaccination efficacy (encompassing both the administration and in vivo performance of the vaccine). Also, the new time intervals are the elapsed time before the beginning of a targeted vaccination program, t VPD , the average time to identify and vaccinate susceptible people who are at risk of becoming infected, t V , and the average post-vaccination period of observation, t O .A SARS vaccine may be effective in preventing SARS infections yet ineffective in mitigating SARS cases. For this reason, new therapeutic drugs for SARS are as desirable as a SARS vaccine. Specific potential advantages of SARS chemotherapy include shorter contagious periods, reduced recovery times and fewer SARS-related deaths. In principle, the basic epidemic model can accommodate these attributes of chemotherapy through alterations of the relevant parameter values in",

(42), Wallinga and Teunis require that the Weibull PDF be zero. Additionally, the specified mean (8.4 days) and standard deviation (3.8 days) are sample statistics from the 2003 SARS outbreak in Singapore.Mean effective reproduction numbers inFig. 2are from Eqs.(42) and(43), with the symptom onset data inFig. 1as input.

On the contrary, nearly all red and reddish orange pixels lie on the diagonal in the lower-right density plot (e = 0.447).
