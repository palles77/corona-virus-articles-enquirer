We now report that an HCoV-OC43 mutant harboring two persistenceassociated S glycoprotein point mutations (H183R and Y241H), induced a stronger unfolded protein response (UPR) and translation attenuation in infected human neurons. There was a major contribution of the IRE1/XBP1 pathway, followed by caspase-3 activation and nuclear fragmentation, with no significant role of the ATF6 and eIF2-alpha/ATF4 pathways. Our results show the importance of discrete molecular viral S determinants in virus-neuronal cell interactions that lead to increased production of viral proteins and infectious particles, enhanced UPR activation, and increased cytotoxicity and cell death. As this mutant virus is more neurovirulent in mice, our results also suggest that two mutations in the S glycoprotein could eventually modulate viral neuropathogenesis.",

Indeed, we reported that the OC43 strain (HCoV-OC43) could infect and persist in human neural cell lines (Arbour et al., 1999) , and infect primary human and murine central nervous system (CNS) cultures (Bonavia et al., 1997; Jacomy et al., 2006) . Moreover, neurons were the main target of infection in the murine CNS , as well as in human co-cultures of neurons and astrocytes (M. Desforges and P.J. Talbot, unpublished data) . Furthermore, HCoV-OC43 induced a chronic encephalitis in susceptible mice , HCoV RNA was detected in human brains (Arbour et al., 2000) and HCoV-OC43 was associated with acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (Yeh et al., 2004) . Considering that murine hepatitis virus, MHV, the murine counterpart of HCoV-OC43, causes neurological disease in mice (Buchmeier et al., 1987) , we hypothesized that HCoV-OC43 might be associated with some human neurological diseases.",

PERK is activated following homodimerization and plays a major role in the phosphorylation of the translation initiation factor eIF2-alpha (Shi et al., 1998) . IRE1 is an endoribonuclease and kinase which undergoes oligomerization and autophosphorylation, leading to its activation following UPR induction (Tirasophon et al., 1998; Tirasophon et al., 2000; Yoshida et al., 2001) . IRE1 is responsible for the unconventional splicing of Xbp1(u) mRNA by excising an 26-nucleotide intron, yielding the Xbp1(s) mRNA form (Yoshida et al., 2001) . Xbp1(s) is translated into a transcription factor, XBP1, which translocates to the nucleus (Yoshida et al., 2001) . XBP1 induces the expression of genes related to proteasomal degradation of proteins (Yamamoto et al., 2004) . XBP1 may also promote the expression of the genes Grp94, an ER chaperone (Yamamoto et al., 2004) , and Chop (Lee et al., 2003) .

Various viruses have evolved different strategies to modulate its activation and/or benefit from it. Interestingly, the S proteins of the coronaviruses MHV (Versteeg et al., 2007) and SARS-CoV (Chan et al., 2006) were shown to induce UPR within cells. Even though the involvement of the coronavirus S protein in neurovirulence (Phillips et al., 1999) and the UPR in neurological diseases (Lindholm et al., 2006) have been suggested, no studies have, to our knowledge, been performed to identify specific amino acid residues within the S protein which would differ between coronavirus variants and correlate with an increased neurovirulence and UPR activation.",

Two HCoV-OC43 point mutations that reproducibly appeared upon persistent infection of human neural cell lines (H183R and Y241H) were introduced into an infectious cDNA clone (St-Jean et al., 2006) and generated an HCoV-OC43 variant which induced an increased UPR within infected human neurons, an interesting fact as this variant showed enhanced neurovirulence in mice (H.

First, we evaluated the susceptibility of the two wellcharacterized differentiated human neuronal cell lines NT2-N (Pleasure and Lee, 1993) and LA-N-5 (Hill and Robertson, 1998) to HCoV-OC43 (ATCC strain) infection. Immunofluorescence analysis confirmed the neuronal nature of the cells, as revealed by the detection of specific neuronal markers, NFM for LA-N-5 and \u03b2-tubIII for NT2-N (Fig. 1A , panels a and b), and their susceptibility to HCoV-OC43 infection was demonstrated by the detection of viral antigens (Fig. 1A , panels c and d). Furthermore, the infection was shown to be productive, as demonstrated by the increase in infectious HCoV-OC43 progeny virions in cell culture medium over a period of 72 h postinfection (Fig. 1B) .",

Considering that Cy3-CTP and Cy5-CTP do not incorporate at the same rate during the amplification stage, we performed duplicate microarray experiments in dye-swap to prevent label-bias in analysis (Tseng et al., 2001) . Results of internal chip controls showed a correlation of more than 95% compared to their expected modulation, confirming the reliability of our modulation results (data not shown). We identified a total of 275 genes, the expression of which was significantly modulated at 24, 48 and/or 72 h post-infection, in at least two independent infections, with a maximum p-value of 0.05. The transcriptomic profile showed a diversity in the modulation of expression of genes that we grouped into nine major cellular functional groups (Fig. 2) .",

The UPR occurring in human neurons is also associated with various neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease (Imaizumi et al., 2001) and Parkinson's disease (Imai et al., 2000) . Moreover, some studies also indicated that ER stress induced in neurons might underlie the neuropathological mechanisms leading to neuronal injury (Paschen, 2001) . Therefore, we sought to analyze the activation of the three UPR pathways, namely ATF6, PERK/eIF2-alpha and IRE1/XBP1. First, the modulation of expression of genes related to the UPR revealed by our microarray experiments, was confirmed by quantitative PCR in both NT2-N and LA-N-5 cells. Total RNA was reversetranscribed before performing real-time quantitative PCR, using primers specific to each gene of interest (Supplementary data 1). Our results showed a high correlation between the NT2-N and LA-N-5 neuronal models in the modulation of expression of UPR-related genes following HCoV-OC43 infection ( Table 1 ). The degree of induction (fold-induction) in the expression of the Atf4, Erdj3, Erdj4, Gadd34, Grp78 and Grp94 genes clearly indicated a significant similarity between the response of both NT2-N and LA-N-5 cells, establishing a relevant consistency between the two models (Table 1) . Moreover, even though there were some differences in the degree of induction of gene expression in the two cell lines for the Chop, Edem, Herp, P58-ipk and Xbp1 genes, an upregulation was always observed over the time-course of HCoV-OC43 infection (Table 1) . Indeed, the trend in the modulation of expression of these genes followed the same pattern in both NT2-N and LA-N-5 cells, which again revealed a consistency in the state of activation of the underlying pathways.",

Consequently, we sought to determine whether a HCoV-OC43 variant harboring mutations within the S protein related to enhanced neurovirulence in mice (H. Jacomy and P. J. Talbot, submitted for publication), could differentially induce the UPR in human neurons, compared to the so-called HCoV-OC43 wild-type, which we obtained several years ago from the ATCC. Two point mutations (H183R and Y241H) identified in the S protein of a HCoV-OC43 variant obtained from persistently infected human neural cell lines were introduced into the HCoV-OC43 genome using our fulllength cDNA clone pBAC-OC43 FL (St-Jean et al., 2006) , yielding a recombinant virus which we designated HCoV-OC43 rOC/U S183-241 . Before analyzing the effects of these mutations on UPR activation, we sought to determine whether both viruses showed similar kinetics of replication and dissemination in cell culture. The production of extraand intra-cellular infectious viral particles was evaluated at 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 48 and 72 h post-infection. No differences in extra-cellular infectious titers were observed between HCoV-OC43 wild-type and HCoV-OC43 rOC/U S183-241 (Fig. 3A, left panel) . However, a significant increase in the production of intra-cellular infectious viral particles was noted for HCoV-OC43 rOC/U S183-241 as compared to HCoV-OC43 wild-type (Fig. 3A , right panel). Moreover, cells infected by HCoV-OC43 rOC/U S183-241 produced more viral S proteins, as shown by flow cytometry at 24 h post-infection ( Fig. 3C ) and by immunofluorescence revealed by microscopic observation (Fig. 3B ). We then assessed the percentage of infected cells at 4, 16 and 24 h post-infection by flow cytometry and found that there were no differences between the two viruses in their spread in the neuronal cultures, as the percentage of infected cells was not significantly different (Fig. 3D ). Globally, our data indicate that the two viruses have the same capacity to release infectious particles in the cell medium and that their kinetics of dissemination within neuronal cultures were comparable. However, we did observe a significant increase in the amount of viral proteins and infectious viral particles within cells infected by the variant HCoV-OC43 rOC/U S183-241 .",

During the course of UPR, ATF6 is cleaved within the Golgi, leading to the appearance of ATF6 transcriptional factors, which are translocated to the nucleus where they mainly bind cis-acting ER stress-response element (ERSE) (Okada et al., 2002) . As the Grp78 gene is a major target of ATF6 and a central effector of the UPR, its expression was assessed by quantitative real-time PCR to determine the degree of activation of the ATF6 pathway. Infection of neurons with HCoV-OC43 wild-type did not result in any significant modulation of the expression of Grp78 (Fig. 4A ). On the other hand, infection with HCoV-OC43 rOC/U S183-241 did result in a 3-fold transient increase of Grp78 expression (Fig. 4A ). The level of expression of the corresponding GRP78 protein was examined by Western blotting but no significant difference in the expression of the GRP78 protein between mock-infected cells and infected cells by either HCOV-OC43 wild-type or HCoV-OC43 rOC/U S183-241 was detected (Fig. 4B ) . Thapsigargin-treated cells were used a positive control and did demonstrate the capacity of the neuronal cells to express GRP78 following activation of the UPR (Fig. 4B ). As Grp78 is the major gene modulated by the ATF6 pathway of the UPR, our data indicate that the ATF6 pathway is functional in the LA-N-5 cells but that it did not play a significant role in the UPR induced by infection with either virus.",

Strikingly, no significant decrease in protein translation was observed following infection by both viruses at 24 h post-infection, as compared to mock-infected cells, as revealed by autoradiographic gel and quantified after TCA precipitation ( Fig. 5B and 5C). The three intense bands present only in infected-cells, which likely correspond to the viral S, N and M proteins, showed a stronger expression in cells infected by HCoV-OC43 rOC/U S183-241 at 24 h post-infection, which correlates with our observations of intra-cellular infectious viral titers (Fig. 3A) , immunofluorescence ( Fig. 3B ) and flow cytometry (Figs. 3C and D). Thapsigargin-treated cells served as a positive control of protein synthesis inhibition, demonstrating that repression of mRNA translation could indeed occur in neurons. Staining of the gel with Coomassie blue was used as a loading control (data not shown).

Atf4 mRNA is known to be preferentially translated into a transcription factor when eIF2-alpha is phosphorylated . Considering that the ATF4 protein regulates the expression of the Gadd34 and Chop genes, respectively involved in the dephosphorylation of eIF2-alpha (Novoa et al., 2001) and in the induction of apoptosis (Matsumoto et al., 1996; Zinszner et al., 1998) , the potential modulation of expression of these genes was analyzed by quantitative PCR. Our results revealed clear differences in the kinetics of induction of the Chop gene expression after infection with HCoV-OC43 wild-type or HCoV-OC43 rOC/U S183-241 (Fig. 6A) . Chop was strongly induced at 48 h post-infection by HCoV-OC43 rOC/U S183-241 and its expression decreased at 72 h post-infection. On the other hand, infection with HCoV-OC43 wild-type led to a constantly increasing level of the Chop gene up to 72 h post-infection, but to a lower level than for HCoV-OC43 rOC/U S183-241 . Even though Gadd34 expression is also considered to be regulated by ATF4, its expression followed a different kinetics. Both HCoV-OC43 wild-type and HCoV-OC43 rOC/U S183-241 induced the upregulation of Gadd34, which expression gradually increased up to 72 h postinfection (Fig. 6A) , with a more pronounced induction after infection by HCoV-OC43 rOC/U S183-241 . Even though there was no significant level of phosphorylated eIF2-alpha at 48 and 72 h post-infection (Fig.  5A) , the level of expression of the ATF4 protein was evaluated to determine whether the expression of the Chop and Gadd34 genes could be linked to this protein. We were not able to detect any expression of the ATF4 protein following infection by both viruses (Fig. 6B) . The level of expression of the CHOP and GADD34 proteins was then assessed to verify whether the observed increase in expression of the corresponding gene led to an increase in the amount of the corresponding protein. Strikingly, no increase in the CHOP protein was observed even though we observed a 50-fold increase in gene expression at 48 h post-infection by HCoV OC43 rOC/ U S183-241 , compared to mock-infected cells. On the other hand, a slight increase in the amount of GADD34 protein could be detected at 72 h after infection by HCoV-OC43 rOC/U S183-241 . Thapsigargin-treated cells were used as a positive control to demonstrate that neurons could indeed be induced to up-regulate expression of these proteins.",

Our results also showed clear differences in the kinetics of induction of these genes by the two viruses.

This led us to assess the increase of Xbp1(s) mRNA by quantitative PCR, with primers spanning the 26-nucleotide intron (Hirota et al., 2006) , and measure the increase of the Xbp1(s) mRNA concurrently to the decrease of the Xbp1(u) form by RT-PCR, with primers flanking the 26-nucleotide intron (Hirota et al., 2006) (Figs. 7A and B).

The ATF6 pathway is thought to play a minor role, if any, in the UPR activated by both viruses. Indeed, its well known major target gene, Grp78, is merely expressed and no expression upregulation of the GRP78 protein is observed in both infection. The PERK/eIF2\u03b1 pathway is only transiently activated by both viruses in the first 24 h post-infection although HCoV-OC43 rOC/U S183-241 induced a strong translational protein shutoff starting at 48 h post-infection. However, no ATF4 protein was found during the course of infections by both viruses, even though Chop and Gadd34 gene were expressed. This could be explained by the expression of ATF3, also known to regulate their expression. Acronyms. IRE1: inositol-requiring enzyme 1; PERK: PKR-like ER kinase; ATF6: activating transcription factor 6; Xbp1 U : X-box binding protein mRNA unspliced form; Xbp1 S : X-box binding protein mRNA spliced form; ATF4: activating transcription factor 4; ATF3: activating transcription factor 3; eIF2\u03b1: \u03b1 subunit of eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2. infected by HCoV-OC43 rOC/U S183-241 exhibited more nuclear fragmentation than mock-infected or HCoV-OC43-infected cells (Fig.  8B ). Cells treated for 24 h with staurosporine, a common apoptosis inducer, served as a positive control. Moreover, cells experiencing intense activation of caspase-3 following HCoV-OC43 rOC/U S183-241 infection were also positive for viral antigens and nuclear fragmentation. Altogether, our results showed that HCoV-OC43 rOC/U S183-241 induced caspase-3 activation and nuclear fragmentation, two common apoptosis markers, as early as 48 h p.i., whereas HCoV-OC43 wild-type did not show any significant activation of either compared to mock-infected cells.",

Among the global transcriptomic modulation, several genes are associated with the translation machinery, neurotransmission, immunity and cytoskeleton factors.

Jacomy and P. J. Talbot, submitted for publication). As clearly shown in Fig. 3 , the comparison of infectious viral particles production between HCoV-OC43 wild-type and HCoV-OC43 rOC/U S183-241 showed that both viruses bear the same capacity to produce extracellular infectious particles and that they disseminated in neuronal culture at the same rate. However, HCoV-OC43 rOC/U S183-241 showed a more rapid and intense production of viral proteins and intracellular infectious viral particles. This suggests that discrete molecular viral S determinants could play a role in virus-cell interactions, leading to an increased capacity to produce viral proteins and infectious viral particles. More importantly, the resulting increase in viral proteins present in the ER suggest that the cells might experience a more intense UPR activation in order to cope with an increased ER stress caused by the burden of viral proteins. Therefore, mutations in the S protein of HCoV-OC43, which lead to an increased neurovirulence in mice, induce a different kinetics of UPR activation. Considering that an uncontrolled UPR appears to be associated with neurological diseases (Lindholm et al., 2006; Paschen, 2003) , we studied its level of activation following infection by HCoV-OC43 wild-type and HCV-OC43 rOC/U S183-241 in human neurons, which are the main target of infection and determined whether these mutations could lead to increased neuronal death (Fig. 9) .",

Indeed, we showed that HCoV-OC43 infection induced the upregulation of expression of a negative regulator of PERK and PKR activity, P58-ipk, and of a central gene in the ERAD complex, Edem, both solely under the control of XBP1 following activation of the UPR (Lee et al., 2003; Yamamoto et al., 2004) . Altogether, these results indicate an unambiguous activation of the IRE1/XBP1 pathway following HCoV-OC43 infection.

Moreover, we hypothesize that the increased expression of the cellular inhibitor of PERK P58-ipk, starting at 48 h post-infection, may help explain the absence of phosphorylation of eIF2-alpha at 48 and 72 h post-infection (Fig.  7A) . However, even if we were not able to detect any ATF4 protein (Fig. 6B ), we observed a significant upregulation of expression of the Gadd34 and Chop genes (Fig. 6A) , which are largely considered to be under the control of ATF4. However, although ATF4 plays a major role in the expression of these genes, other factors are known to regulate their expression. ATF3 is a transcriptional factor that has been shown to regulate Gadd34 and Chop gene expression (Haneda et al., 2004; Jiang et al., 2004) . Given that our microarray results showed an upregulation of the expression of ATF3 (data not shown), we hypothesize that Gadd34 and Chop might be induced by this transcriptional factor instead of ATF4. Furthermore, the expression of the Chop gene was also shown to be under the control of XBP1 (Lee et al., 2003) , which correlates with our results (Figs. 6A, 7A and B) . Considering our results showing upregulation of the Edem and P58ipk genes, solely under XBP1 control (Lee et al., 2003) , this adds to the possible involvement of XBP1 in the expression of Chop. The absence of expression of the CHOP protein is striking considering the strong upregulation of Chop mRNA by HCoV OC43 rOC/U S183-241 (Fig. 6A) . However, this may suggest a post-transcriptional regulation of the Chop gene in coronavirus infection, as it has already been shown for INF-beta by MHV (Roth-Cross et al., 2007) . Altogether, our results indicate that the PERK/eIF2-alpha pathway does not play a significant role in the infection of neuronal cells by HCoV-OC43.",

It is of interest to consider that such attenuation of translation can occur concurrently with increased protein degradation by the ERAD complex. The strong upregulation of Edem (Olivari et al., 2006) and Herp (Kim et al., 2008) gene expression (Fig. 6A) , especially after HCoV-OC43 rOC/U S183-241 infection might in part explain this phenomenon, as these proteins are associated with protein degradation during the UPR (Figs. 5B and C). Moreover, translational shutoff is a common hallmark preceding cell death, which was also already very strong at 48 h post-infection by the HCoV-OC43 rOC/U S183-241 variant, as shown by a viability assay (Fig. 5D) and evaluation of apoptosis induction by caspase-3 activation and nuclear fragmentation (Figs. 8A  and B) . Thus, considering the strong upregulation of gene expression of Edem and Herp known for their role in protein degradation, the significant activation of caspase-3 and the induction of nuclear fragmentation, we hypothesize that the strong decrease in protein synthesis detected following HCoV-OC43 rOC/U S183-241 infection might be the result of an increased protein degradation by the ERAD complex concurrently with initial activation steps of apoptosis.",

            "text": "While deciphering the UPR following a viral infection, one should bear in mind that redundancy between activated and non-activated pathways and compensating mechanisms for transcriptional gene control, may also lie elsewhere than within the three well-known UPR pathways. Indeed, such complex cross-talk between the UPR pathways using knock-out of XBP1 and ATF6 was reported (Lee et al., 2003) . This would account for the expression of Grp94, which is under the control of both XBP1 and ATF6, following infection by HCoV-OC43 rOC/U S183-241 at both mRNA and protein levels (Figs. 7A and B). Our results indicate that the expression of the Grp78 gene is slightly upregulated, but not to a significant level, as revealed by the absence of the corresponding protein in Western blot analysis (Figs. 4A and B) . Interestingly, the knock-out of ATF6 or XBP1 alone was shown to induce a very weak loss of Grp78 expression, showing redundancy between these pathways (Lee et al., 2003) . In contrast, other groups showed that XBP1 knock-out only slightly impaired Grp78 expression and that ATF6 is the major inductor of Grp78 (Yamamoto et al., 2004) . However, further studies need to be performed in order to decipher the cross-talk between ATF6 and XBP1 pathways. Nevertheless, our results do suggest that the low level of expression of Grp78 mRNA could account for the XBP1 activity, as it weakly induces the ERSE promoter (Yamamoto et al., 2004) , and that a full activation of the ATF6 pathway would have led to a strong GRP78 protein expression, as revealed by thapsigargin treatment (Fig. 4A) . Therefore, we hypothesize that the ATF6 pathway plays a minor role, if any, in the UPR activated by HCoV-OC43, leading to the absence of upregulation of GRP78 protein and that consequently GRP94 protein expression is likely to account for XBP1 activity.",

Indeed, others have already shown that the S protein of MHV (Versteeg et al., 2007) and SARS-CoV (Chan et al., 2006) or the 8ab protein of SARS-CoV (Sung et al., 2009) can alone induce the UPR and that only the presence or accumulation of the protein is thought to be responsible for the ER stress (Versteeg et al., 2007) . Our study clearly reveals that mutations within the S protein of HCoV-OC43 can differentially induce the UPR and lead to a stronger neuronal death by apoptosis, as shown by intense caspase-3 activation and nuclear fragmentation (Figs. 8A and B) . Interestingly, IRE1 was linked to the JNK pathway that is involved in apoptosis following the UPR (Urano et al., 2000) and JNK activation can be modulated by other virus, such as HCMV, to cope with cell death (Xuan et al., 2009) . One might speculate that the JNK pathway could play a role in the strong neuronal apoptosis induced by HCoV-OC43 rOC/U S183-241 , as we observed a strong and unambiguous activation of the IRE1/XBP1 pathway. Studies are currently underway to decipher the possible implication of the JNK pathway in our model.",

Microarray experiments were performed using the Low RNA Input linear amplification kit (Agilent) (Zhu et al., 2006) , according to the manufacturer's protocol, where CTP-Cy3 (Perkin-Elmer) and CTP-Cy5 (Perkin-Elmer) were incorporated into cRNA. Equimolar solution of cRNA from infected and mock-infected cells were hybridized for 17 h at 65\u00b0C on the Agilent 60-mer Oligo Microarray Human 1A v2, 22K chip, which represents 22,000 human transcripts. Microarray fluorescence was revealed using a ProScanArray HT scanner (Perkin-Elmer) at a 5 \u03bcm resolution and colorimetric intensity quantified using the ProScanArray Express software (Perkin-Elmer). Statistics were performed with the open-source software Microarray Data Analysis System (MIDAS) from the TM4 microarray software suite (Saeed et al., 2003) , using combined threshold for a significant gene modulation of p b 0.05 and a minimum of 2-fold modulation of expression in two independent viral infections. Transcriptomics time-point analysis was made from two independent infections, where each of the time-point was performed in dye-swap quadruplicate. cDNAs for quantitative real-time PCR were obtained from total RNA extracts reversetranscribed using the SuperscriptII first-strand kit with oligo-dT primers (Invitrogen), according to the manufacturer's protocol. Realtime quantitative PCR was performed using the DyNAmo SYBR green qPCR kit (NEB) with the Rotor-gene 3000 (Corbett Life Science) with 1 cycle of 95\u00b0C for 15 min, followed by 40 cycles at 94\u00b0C for 30 s, 60\u00b0C for 30 s, and 72\u00b0C for 30 s. Modulation of gene expression from quantitative real-time PCR was analyzed using the 2 \u2212\u0394\u0394Ct method (Livak and Schmittgen, 2001 ) and normalized to Gapdh expression. ANOVA tests followed by post-hoc Tahame's analysis were performed to determine the statistical significance of the differences in gene expression between samples, using SPSS software version 16.0.

Supernatants and cells were separately harvested and titers of extra-and intra-cellular viral infectious particles were assayed. (B) Detection of viral antigens within neurons infected by HCoV-OC43 wild-type or HCoV-OC43 rOC/U S183-241 . Merged images of immunofluorescence of LA-N-5 differentiated into human neurons infected with HCoV-OC43 wild-type (left panel) or HCoV-OC43 rOC/U S183-241 (right panel) showing HCoV-OC43 antigens (green) and DAPI (blue). (C) Kinetics of infection of neurons. Neurons were infected and, at the indicated times post-infection, fixed, permeabilized, labeled with antibody directed against HCoV-OC43 or HCoV-229E (isotype control) and labeled with secondary antibody AlexaFluor 488 anti-mouse. Grey area represent cells labeled with isotype control antibody and white area represent cells labeled with HCoV-OC43 antibody. (D) Percentage of infected neurons. Percentage of cells labeled with HCoV-OC43 antibody were quantified considering the background established with cells labeled with HCoV-229E isotype control antibody.",

Total eIF2-alpha served as a loading control. Thapsigargin-treated samples served as a positive control. (B and C) Protein synthesis analysis. Cell cultures were starved for cysteine and methionine for 30 min, then incubated with 35 S-radiolabeled cysteine/methionine for 15 min and harvested. Whole cell lysates were assayed for cpm (C) counts and resolved on a 4-12% polyacrylamide gel (B). Thapsigargin-treated cells served as a translational shutoff control. (D) Cell viability assay. Cell cultures were incubated with the MTS/PMS solution and absorbance was read at 492 nm. Cell viability is expressed as a relative percentage compared to mock-infected cells.
