This begs the question -why bioactive paper instead of bioactive plastic? Paper offers unique advantages over plastic including: 1) paper is very inexpensive and is manufactured locally in nearly every part of the world from renewable and recyclable resources; 2) paper has a long and successful history performing as filter media and barrier media, and can even function as sterile packaging; 3) paper is easily printed, coated and impregnated; 4) cellulose is particularly protein and biomolecule friendly; 5) paper is a good filter; 6) paper is biodegradable or easily burned; and, 7) the porous structure facilitates lateral-flow assays, chromatographic separations and inexpensive microfluidics devices. The focus of this review is research leading to largescale implementation of inexpensive bioactive-paper assays that can function without laboratories or significant instrumentation. I view the ''paper'' part of bioactive paper in the broadest context to include non-woven fabrics, and coated and uncoated paperboard. I do not consider examples involving small cellulosic adsorption pads and nitrocellulose films, which are widely used in ''dip-stick'' lateral-flow devices (e.g., over-the-counter (OTC) pregnancy test kits, printed electronic devices or instrumentation [42] ) and ''intelligent'' or ''active'' packaging involving plastic films.",

Modern paper machines produce a 10-m wide continuous sheet of paper at expressway speeds ($100 km/h). The dried paper sheet may be coated either directly on the paper machine or in a separate operation. From the perspective of bioactive paper, critical properties include surface chemistry, porosity and optical properties. In subsequent sections, I show that surface chemistry influences biomolecule immobilization, non-specific binding and color expression in enzyme-catalyzed reporting assays. Porosity, together with surface chemistry, influences wet properties, which are important for bioactive-paper fabrication by printing or coating. Finally, the optical properties may influence color-based or fluorescence-based reporting schemes. For example, many commercial paper types are treated with fluorescent molecules, called optical brightening agents, which are added to make paper appear white. Such surfaces would give a very high background in fluorescence-detection assays.",

It seems that paper treated with wet-strength resin may be a good substrate for the direct immobilization of biosensors. There are two caveats. The cationic surfaces will adsorb most biomacromolecules, so it may be necessary to use some kind of blocking to prevent non-specific adsorption [82] . Common blocking chemicals include Tween 20 (a non-ionic surfactant), BSA, casein or fat-free milk [83] . Second, there is no control of biosensor orientation and we might expect very cationic and reactive surfaces to denature protein-based and DNA-based sensors. The general sense from the literature is therefore that direct application is not a robust strategy because every biosensor/paper combination would have to be optimized before use.",

(3) The microenvironment around the biosensor is determined by the support-particle chemistry, not the paper surface. Thus, supported biosensors should be less sensitive to variations in paper-substrate properties compared to small, water-soluble biosensors. Blocking and reporting functions can be built into the carrier particles. Attaching biosensors to particles is a mature subject (e.g., there have been commercial latex-agglutination assays for decades). When dilute suspensions of latex particles, coated with antibodies, are exposed to antigen, antibody-antigen binding causes the latex dispersion to aggregate giving a visible response [91] . The early work involved polystyrene latexes, available as monodispersed particles, which had clean surfaces and could be magnetic. Streptavidin adsorbs spontaneously and irreversibly, giving particles that will bind biotinylated biosensors [92, 93] . Pichot\u00d5s group reported extensively on the preparation and the characterization of a wide variety of polymer colloids as potential support particles for biosensors [94] . They concluded that colloidal microgels based on poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) (PNIPAM) [95] were superior because PNIPAM gives little non-specific protein binding [96] . Following from Pichot\u00d5s work, my colleagues and I covalently coupled DNA aptamers and antibodies to carboxylated PNIPAM microgels [17] . Fig. 7 shows the conjugation chemistry. We were surprised to observe that simply air-drying the microgels after spotting them on filter paper immobilized the gels. They did not come off or move when the dried paper was subsequently immersed in buffer or eluted with buffer. Fig. 8 shows examples of elution experiments. The microgels did not move. Examples of signals given by the microgel-supported sensors are given in the Section 4 below.",

The biosensor (capture agent) is usually an antibody or antibody fragment that is immobilized on a support surface. Exposure of the test solution leads to antigen capture. After washing, a second antibody (secondary antibody) bearing an enzyme is introduced. Finally, the test surface is exposed to the substrate solution for the immobilized enzyme that catalyzes the production of a colored or fluorescent product. With care and some form of instrumentation for accessing color or fluorescence, ELISA can be quantitative. To avoid high backgrounds, it is often necessary to block the support surface by adsorbing a polymer, a biomacromolecule and/or a surfactant to prevent the non-specific binding of the antigen or the secondary antibody. Although it will be shown below that ELISA detection of paper works well, the multiple steps doom ELISA to ''offline'' appli-cations, where the exposed bioactive paper must be processed to generate a signal -not the best solution.",

Color-developing enzymes were spotted and dried onto one of the chambers for glucose detection. Capillary forces were used to carry the sample solution into the three chambers. Such devices could be very inexpensive and suitable for both point-of-care and developing-world applications.

The aptamer is also made to form a second duplex with another short DNA molecule labeled with a fluorescent group, so the fluorescence of the aptamer in the unbound state is quenched. When the target, ATP in this case, is introduced, the duplex dissociates in favor of forming an aptamer-ATP complex which fluoresces. Su et al. have shown that Li\u00d5s aptamers can be immobilized on microgels that can be inkjet printed onto paper, giving an aptamer-based sensor-reporter combination [17] . Nanoparticle reporters show some promise. Gold nanoparticles in size range 10-50 nm have an intense red color when the particles are separated by a distance equivalent to a few particle diameters. The color changes to purple when aggregation brings the particles closer together. In a typical sensing application, the particles are coated antibodies or aptamers [102] and a color change is observed when the target antigen induces aggregation of the gold particles. This is an attractive approach because the colors are very intense, typically nanogold-extinction coefficients are more than 1000 times greater than those of organic dyes [10] . In addition, the ability of thiols to chemisorb onto gold provides a simple route to immobilization. Fig. 12 shows a schematic representation of a DNA-aptamer biosensor employing a nanogold sensor [10] .",

            "text": "Most publications describe nanogold sensors that are dispersions in buffers. For gold to be useful on bioactive paper, the nanoparticles must function after drying and subsequent wetting of the sensor. Zhao et al. recently describe a paper-supported gold biosensor capable of detecting the presence of DNase I, an endonuclease, and adenosine, a small biomolecule [23] . For both targets, the biosensor functions by causing the dissociation of a gold-nanoparticle aggregate to give an intense red color (see Fig. 13 ). The DNase I sensor functions by degrading the DNA chains bridging the nanoparticles, whereas, with the adenosine sensor, the gold particles are weakly aggregated with an adenosine aptamer. The presence of adenosine strips the aptamer from the gold, causing the particles to disperse. This is an important publication because it demonstrates that a sensitive biosensor can be dried on paper, heated and stored while retaining activity upon subsequent exposure to the target solution. From a paper-science perspective, Zhao\u00d5s work is important because it shows that the details of the paper substrate are important. Papers coated with hydrophilic or hydrophobic polymers were suitable for the nanoparticle assay, whereas untreated filter paper was not because capillary forces caused the spotted nanoparticles to bleed over too great an area.",

Fig. 14 shows one example, taken from a patent application [104] . The biosensor consists of quantum dots with immobilized antibodies on the surface, which, in turn, are weakly bound to a surrogate facsimile antigen bearing a fluorescent quenching molecule. The quencher prevents fluorescent emissions from the quantum dot. Reporting occurs when the target antigen displaces the surrogate, separating the quencher from the quantum dot, which is then free to fluoresce.",
