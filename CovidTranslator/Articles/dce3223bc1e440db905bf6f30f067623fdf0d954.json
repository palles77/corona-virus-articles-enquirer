Even though they present their findings as a case study, they can also be analyzed as a retrospective cohort study of how well various levels of PPE use protect against infection in health care workers. The cohort is formed by 64 health care workers who were, \u22651 times, exposed to patients infected with Ebola. They can be divided according to their level of PPE use in no PPE use, gloves only, at least gloves and gowns, or more. Because we know if they became infected or not, we can calculate the relative risks and their 95% confidence intervals (Table 1) . We took the total number of exposures as the denominator in calculating the risks as an equivalent of person time. We added 0.5 to prevent cells with zero cases.",
