However, clinical and experimental evidence implicates the possibility of co-infection. In this report, reovirus was isolated from throat swabs of SARS patients, including the first case in Beijing and her mother. Identification with the electron microscopy revealed the characteristic features of reovirus. 24 of 38 samples from other SARS cases were found to have serologic responses to the reovirus. Primers designed for reovirus have amplified several fragments of DNA, one of which was sequenced (S2 gene fragment), which indicates it as a unique reovirus (orthoreovirus). Preliminary animal experiment showed that inoculation of the reovirus in mice caused death with atypical pneumonia. Nevertheless, the association of reovirus with SARS outbreak requires to be further investigated.",

Since then, an international team of researchers has completed the final proofs that SARS is caused by the primary suspect--SARS-associated coronavirus (SCV), a novel coronavirus [l-3] .",

It is known now that early in 1967, a case of fatal interstitial pneumonia caused by reovirus infection was reported [7] . In recent years, animal models of lung fibrosis, ARDS and BOOP were set Up [8, 9] between this virus and SARS, we made a further investigation on it. Electron microscopy (EM) examination of Hep-2 cells and Vero-E6 cells infected with the virus isolated from throat swab specimens of the first case in Beijing revealed characteristic reovirus particles with a size of about 60-80 urn in diameter. Fig. l(a)-(c) shows aggregates of reovirus particles in the cytoplasm of Hep-2 cells. The reovirus is observed in different mature stages, and two types of viral particles can be seen: the matured particles with dense central core, and the incompletely assembled virus particles with lucent core, both of which have capsid about 14 urn in thickness. Most of the viral particles were found in large clusters, which arranged in crystal-arrayed form (Fig. 1(c)-(e) ). The reovirus was also isolated by the same way from her mother, but SCV could not be isolated from throat swab specimens of both of them. In Vero-E6 cells infected with strain of SCv, typical coronavirus particles of 80-120 urn in diameter with a dark central nuclercapsid and envelope were seen ( Fig. l(f) ). It is important to note that coronaviruses within a vacuole and reovirus particles in cytoplasm were observed simultaneously in Vero-E6 cells infected with an individual SCV sample (Fig. l(f) ), while there was neither of these viruses in control Vero-E6 cells.",
