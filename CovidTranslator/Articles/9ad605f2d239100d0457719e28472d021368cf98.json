Of course, the public health authorities in Japan have started to prepare control measures for such events. We report here our attempts, using a mathematical model, to estimate outbreak size and to examine the most effective measures; comparing ring vaccination (contact tracing, isolation, and vaccination among contacts) and mass vaccination of the susceptible population in the area. The basic framework of the mathematical model follows a model used in previous research. The initial susceptible population is assumed to be 30 million persons. Concerning the important parameters, such as the number of initial-exposure cases, R 0 (infectious power, or natural history) and, the starting day of intervention after the initial exposure, we checked the robustness of our conclusions by sensitivity analysis. We found that mass vaccination is preferable to ring vaccination when the values for the initial-exposure cases and R 0 are high and when the start of intervention by public health authorities is delayed. In the base-case situation, the mass vaccination strategy needs almost 30 million vaccine doses. On the other hand, though ring vaccination needs fewer doses, it needs fewer than 50 000 doses in the worst-case scenario, that with larger first exposure, higher R 0 , or later start of public health authority intervention. This mathematical model can measure the prevalence of an infectious disease and can evaluate control measures for it before an outbreak. Especially, it is useful for the planning of the outbreaks of emerging diseases such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) or for bioterrorism attacks involving such diseases as smallpox. In further research, we will have to take into account the population people vaccinated of for smallpox, who account for about 70% of the total population in Japan.",

            "text": "Mathematical modeling is widely used in planning for responses to a pandemic, 1 and in the evaluation of control measures against severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), 2 and in the evaluation of vaccination policies. 3, 4 Especially, it is also widely used in planning responses to bioterrorism attacks in which smallpox could be used. [5] [6] [7] [8] By using a mathematical model, we tried to estimate outbreak size (i.e. total number of patients, outbreak duration, peak of the outbreak, and so on) and to examine the most effective measures, comparing ring vaccination (contact tracing, isolation, and vaccination among contacts) and mass vaccination of the susceptible population in the area. We report our findings here. This issue is somewhat controversial, i.e., one study found that mass vaccination was more effective, 7 while, on the contrary, another study concluded that ring vaccination was preferable. 8 However, these studies did not take into account the human resources limitations of the public health authorities, whereas, on the other hand, a theoretical model for HIV has considered this viewpoint explicitly. 9 However, this model ignored the deaths due to HIV, and thus, we cannot extent the model to smallpox. In this article, we report our model, in which we tried to take into account the human resources limitations of public health authorities for dealing with smallpox. There is no report of this kind of research with mathematical models of control measures, (namely, mass or ring vaccination) for smallpox in Japan (S. Tokuraga: The research for technological foundation from the viewpoint of precautionary medicine [unpublished manuscript]; 2003) . In this sense, this study could contribute to public health policy for the preparation of measures to deal with bioterrorism attacks using smallpox.",

We adopted the Markov model setting, following previous research, [5] [6] [7] [8] and the epidemiological characteristics, such as R 0 (infectious power, or natural history), were borrowed from previous research, 5 the natural history of smallpox is shown in Fig. 1 . In particular, we have assumed that the value for infectious power, R 0 , as in an actual case 10 is 1.5, and that it is distributed potentially in the prodromal and mainly in the symptomatic period, previously reported. 5, 10 We also assume that the incubation period lasts for 5 to 17 days, the prodromal period lasts for 2 to 3 days, and the symptomatic period lasts for 11 to 15 days, as in the base case. R 0 is the most commonly used and important number for infection control and is defined by the basic reproduction number (which means the number of persons who are infected from one patient if all the persons are susceptible). We have used the value of R 0 \u03ed 1.5, for the distribution of infectiousness, incubation, prodromal, or symptomatic period over each duration from the previous research. 5 We have also assumed, as in the previous research, that there is one initial-exposure case, and we assume that the initial susceptible population is 30 million persons, that is, the total number of the population who were born after 1976, when vaccination for smallpox had ceased (S. Assumption processed per day per public health worker a R 0 distribution follows data in previous research 5,11 b The durations of the incubation, prodromal, and symptomatic periods are according to previous research 5 susceptibles who were born after 1976 is just 50 persons. This contact number seems high, although it has been used in previous research. 7 In fact, in the episode in which a SARS-infected tourist visited Japan, 11 the public health authority had traced more than 200 contacts per day. Therefore 200 contacts per day seems to be a somewhat moderate number in our experience.",

            "text": "In general, comparing Table 3 and Table 4 , the total number of patients in the ring-vaccination scenario is smaller than that in the mass vaccination scenario for all patterns. Mass vaccination needs almost 30 million vaccine doses. Conversely, the necessary number of vaccine doses for ring vaccination is much smaller than that required for mass vaccination. If there is a larger number of initial cases, higher R 0 , and later start of intervention by the public health authority, more than 24 million vaccine doses are necessary. In such a scenario, mass vaccination is preferable to ring vaccination. Number of patients (3 months/6 months/1 year) indicates the estimated number of patients at 3 months, 6 months, or 1 year after the initial case was exposed Figure 5 illustrates the movement of the cumulative number of patients in the mass vaccination scenario where, R 0 \u03ed 1.5, and where the number of initial-exposure cases is 1000. It clearly shows that the total number of patients would reach 14 000 if intervention was delayed. Even if the public health authority could start intervention within 30 days after the initial case was exposed, the total number of patients would exceed 5000. On the other hand, as shown in Fig. 6 , ring vaccination can dramatically reduce the total number of patients. Namely, even in the worst case of delay, the total number of patients would be lower than 7000. If the public authority could start intervention within 30 days and it adopted ring vaccination, the total number of patients may be constrained to less than 2500. Therefore, we can conclude that ring vaccination is more effective when R 0 \u03ed 1.5 and the number of initial-exposure cases is 1000. Figure 7 shows such relationships in more detail. The upper areas of the declining lines indicate that for the combination of R 0 and number of initial-exposure cases, mass vaccination is more effective than ring vaccination. The blue line indicates the combination in the scenario in which the starting date of intervention is 30 days after the initial case was exposed. The pink line and yellow line indicate the combinations for 45 and 60 days, respectively. Obviously, Number of patients (3 months/6 months/1 year) indicates the estimated number of patients at 3 months, 6 months, or 1 year after the initial case was exposed Fig. 5 . Cumulative number of patients in the mass-vaccination scenario (R 0 \u03ed 1.5, number of initial-exposed cases \u03ed 1000) the later the intervention starts, the wider the area on the graph would be where mass vaccination is more effective. For instance, if the R 0 value is 9 and the number of initialexposure cases is more than ten, mass vaccination would be more effective.",

Besides, the ratio of the number of vaccinations in the mass-and ring-vaccination scenarios was fixed, as 3 : 1. In other words, they 7 assumed that the public health authorities traced and captured contacts and then administered vaccination shots, and after that, they started searching for other contacts. On the other hand, we propose that the public health authorities trace and capture contacts and then quarantine them, and after that, they start searching for other contacts. Vaccination is performed for the quarantined contacts after all contacts have been captured, because isolation stops further infections. Of course, vaccination can reduce the probability of disease onset in the infected period but not in the incubation period.

We have simply borrowed these parameters from previous studies in other countries and so we have assumed that there are no differences among policies or the human resources of the public health authorities between these other countries and Japan. We examined the sensitivity of the starting date of intervention, and it can be seen that it affected the epidemic curve dramatically, as shown in Figs. 5 and 6. Unfortunately, there is no official documentation of a detailed action plan in the case of a bioterrorism attack or of past experience in a similar situation. Therefore, we have to keep this point in mind when we interpret the results. We also have to emphasize that obtaining reliable parameters of policies in Japan is an important task for further studies. For instance, the experience of contact tracing, when a SARS patient visited Japan in May 2003, may provide good data for such studies. 11 Moreover, we also need to mention the interpretation of our findings. As we limited the total number of patients as an outcome measure, we may have ignored important aspects of countermeasures. For instance, adverse effects of vaccination, 12, 13 psychological disorders due to the isolation of contacts, 14 and so on. Therefore, our conclusion, which focuses only on the number of patients, may be biased if such ignored aspects are more important than the aspects we focused on. In principle, we have to evaluate all aspects of policy in their entirety but this seems to be a very difficult task, and it may be the next necessary step in this field.
