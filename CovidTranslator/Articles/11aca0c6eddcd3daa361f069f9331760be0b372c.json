            "text": "According to the Infectious Diseases Society of America, the role of an antimicrobial stewardship program (ASP) is to ensure appropriate antimicrobial therapy in order to optimize clinical outcomes while decreasing associated adverse events. 1 Inappropriate antibiotic prescribing may lead to adverse effects from antibiotics, antibiotic resistance, and health care costs. 1 In the pediatric population, overprescribing of antibiotics has been reported with conditions such as asthma and bronchiolitis. De Boeck et al 2 discovered that in 892,841 Belgian children, those who received a medication for asthma were prescribed antibiotics more often than those without an asthma medication (73.5% vs. 38.6%, respectively). 2 Vanderweil et al 3 reviewed 400,000 emergency department (ED) asthma visits of patients between 2 to 54 years of age and found antibiotics to be prescribed in 18% to 22% of instances, with an unjustified rate of 15% to 19%. Paul et al 4 found an unjustified antibiotic rate of 16% in their population of 5198 ambulatory care children with asthma, a number that the authors translated to 1 million of 60.4 million pediatric visits for asthma in the United States in children with no comorbidities. The 2007 National Heart, Lung, and Blood institute (NHLBI) and the 2016 Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA) guidelines proposed that asthma exacerbations should not routinely be treated with antibiotics. Antibiotic prescribing is justified on the basis of 1) comorbidities that may worsen patient outcome; 2) fever, purulent sputum, bacterial sinusitis, and/or evidence of pneumonia; and 3) patients with a documented infection. 5, 6 A variety of factors may contribute to the widespread pattern of unjustified antibiotic use. In infants who present with wheezing, antibiotics may be prescribed if the asthma diagnosis is confounded by a viral-induced bronchiolitis with radiologic findings suggestive of pneumonia. 4 Diagnostic uncertainty may drive antibiotic prescribing when a patient presents with a fever and no other objective signs of infection, such as elevation in white blood cell count or other markers of infection. Physicians may also provide antibiotics without clear bacterial findings owing to fear of readmission or to avoid medical-legal issues related to missing an infectious diagnosis at the initial presentation. 6 Parents may also request antibiotics to be prescribed for their child who presents with a likely viral infection, causing antibiotic-prescribing pressure. 7, 8 The clinical variances in antibiotic prescribing during an asthma exacerbation led the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) to establish a benchmark of care for unjustified use at 6.6%. 9 At our institution in 2013, Lee and El-Chaar 10 retrospectively examined antibiotic prescribing for children admitted for asthma during a timeframe that included another ASP intervention for respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) bronchiolitis. Following the intervention, over a 5-month period, the authors found that 25% of patients received antibiotics and 7.8% received antibiotics with no justification.",

This study had a concurrent chart review design that took place in the general pediatric and pediatric intensive care units (PICUs) and the pediatric ED from November 2015 to March 2016. This timeframe mirrored the months of our previous retrospective study. 10 Institutional Review Board designated our quality improvement (QI) project as exempt from review. Inclusion criteria were children between the ages of 6 months and younger than 18 years who were admitted with an asthma exacerbation. Exclusion criteria were comorbidities that would justify antibiotic use, such as chronic lung disease, cystic fibrosis, neuromuscular disorders, and Down syndrome. Children who received antibiotics at another institution prior to admission to our hospital were also excluded. In this concurrent chart review, we identified our patients by reviewing the daily census of the general pediatric and the pediatric intensive care units, for children admitted for an asthma exacerbation. Demographic data collected included age, sex, weight, comorbidities, and allergies. Data collected pertaining to the admission included length of stay, maximum temperature (T max ) at home, temperature on admission, T max during the first 24 hours of admission, prior antibiotic or systemic corticosteroid use, white blood cell count, neutrophils, immature neutrophils (bands), blood and urine culture results, chest x-ray findings, film array panel results, antibiotic agent used, if prescribed, days of therapy, where the antibiotic(s) was(were) started, if applicable and whether use was justified. We developed institutional guidelines for the appropriate indication of antibiotic prescribing during an asthma exacerbation, according to the NHLBI and GINA asthma guidelines ( Figure 1 ).

The ASP team met initially to determine how to implement this program, then again during each cycle, and a final time at the conclusion of our research. During these meetings, we discussed the findings and identified areas in need of future interventions using PDSA cycles. Decisions were made by consensus between stakeholders and suggestions communicated during our meetings and/ or via e-mails. The ASP was carried out in a series of PDSA cycles that assessed the impact/effectiveness of each intervention in real time, which was then used to spearhead the next step. This process was continuous and was divided into cycles 1, 2, and 3. The \"Do\" phase consisted of the development of the specific pediatric asthma ASP multidisciplinary team and institutional antibiotic guidelines. The \"Study\" phase determined whether our last cycle intervention was effective. Evaluation was carried out by the concurrent determination of antibiotic justification, performed by reviewing the daily patient census and meeting with the multidisciplinary team. The pharmacy resident performed weekly audits and feedback. In this case, the resident reviewed the admissions on a weekly basis, assessed antibiotic justification according to the guidelines, and had a discussion with the health care team if needed. Then, feedback was provided to the prescriber to discontinue the antibiotic if it was unjustified. In addition, periodic reminders of the ASP results were placed on the bulletin board in the general pediatrics and PICU areas. This involved a brief reminder of our guidelines, reviewing the asthma exacerbation cases for that week, and providing feedback to prescribers regarding justification of antibiotic prescribing. Findings from this phase served as the aim for the next intervention. This process may consist of several PDSA cycles to ultimately achieve our study goal.",

Taking both of these findings into account, cycle 3's objective was to work with our pediatric pulmonary division. This cycle occurred from February to March 2016. Following a journal club, members of the ASP and pediatric pulmonary division met to discuss the use of azithromycin in patients with asthma. During this meeting, it became apparent that a barrier to the service was identification of atypical infections, namely, Mycoplasma pneumoniae and Chlamydia spp. If a patient admitted with an asthma exacerbation was not improving despite standard of care, pulmonologists assumed that atypical microorganisms played a role and prescribed azithromycin. Pulmonologists were incorrectly informed that Mycoplasma titers were performed once a week when in fact they were drawn twice weekly. Therefore, if a patient was suspected of having an atypical microorganism, and the period of testing had just passed, the patient was not tested but was placed empirically on azithromycin.

Through rapid PDSA cycles, our ASP surpassed the 6.6% benchmark set by the AAP in reducing the percentage of unjustified antibiotics in children with asthma to 5.9%. It is encouraging that during our later cycles, there was no unjustified antibiotic use. Our baseline values for this study (7.8%) might have been influenced by a prior ASP program in our institution to reduce antibiotic use. Others reported rates of unjustified antibiotic use without any ASP intervention ranging from 15% to 19%. 3 To our knowledge, this is the first QI project to implement an ASP toward asthma, using PDSA cycles. Overall, antibiotics were prescribed more frequently in our institution (32%) than reported by Paul et al 4 (26.3%) and Vanderweil et al 3 (22%). Both of those studies 3,4 gathered data retrospectively over 3 to 11 years, using national surveys that identified patients through ICD-9 codes. Our data were collected on patients during months of the year when rates of asthma and infections were expected to be high. We chose this period of time to achieve the highest impact of reducing antibiotic use. If we had enrolled patients over the course of the year, it is possible our rate of antibiotic prescribing might have been similar to that of these authors. We also aimed to evaluate patients concurrently and discuss antibiotic needs with the health care team members in real time, a process that takes a considerable amount of time.

There was a 63% shortening of duration of symptoms in the arm that received azithromycin compared to placebo. This finding suggests the use of azithromycin is beneficial in this setting but still could not be confirmed by the evidence provided. Azithromycin is believed to act as an anti-inflammatory agent, as demonstrated in cystic fibrosis. It would be intriguing to demonstrate whether the degree of inflammation in patients with asthma matches that seen with cystic fibrosis, thereby justifying the role of azithromycin. This study was done in a particular cohort of subjects who were closely monitored by physicians and therefore, the results cannot be extrapolated to the general Reducing Unjustified Antibiotics in Children With Asthma Comorbidities Eczema (7), atopic dermatitis (1), Kabuki syndrome (1), developmental delay (1), pruritic rash (1) Eczema (4), obesity (2), GERD (1), scoliosis (1), seizure disorder (1), OSA (1), MRCP (1) Eczema (2), allergic rhinitis (1) Eczema (1) population. 11 The strength of our study was the PDSA cycle methodology with a close follow-up of the impact of each intervention. The concurrent chart review design, as well as the audits and feedback, allowed for the effects of each intervention to be monitored in real time. The multidisciplinary approach helped the execution of each intervention to occur more efficiently. Working with different specialties helped us to identify barriers in antibiotic prescription from different perspectives and allowed for collaborative efforts to overcome these issues.",

This led to a delay in prompt diagnosis by the physician of the causative organism and a delay in analysis by the team to determine whether or not the antibiotics were justified. It is important to note that the only way to confirm Mycoplasma infection is either by the presence of a positive polymerase chain reaction or a 2 to 4-fold increase in Mycoplasma titers drawn 3 to 4 weeks apart, something that was not done in our patients. 12, 13 Thus, the sole use of serology at one point in time as done in our institution does not provide an accurate diagnosis of Mycoplasma to assist in making the decision to treat it.",
