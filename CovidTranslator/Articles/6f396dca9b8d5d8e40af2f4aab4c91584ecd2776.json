ABEI-GC exhibited excellent ECL activity. On this basis, a label-free ECL immunosensor was developed for the sensitive detection of human immunoglobulin G (hIgG) by using ABEI-GC as the ECL nano-interface via a layer-by-layer assembly technique. ABEI-GC was first assembled onto an ITO electrode. Positively charged chitosan was then electrostatically adsorbed to the modified electrode. Finally, negatively charged antibody-coated gold nanoparticles were attached to the surface to form the ECL immunosensor. In the presence of hIgG, hIgG was captured by its antibody. In addition, an ECL signal was detected in the presence of H 2 O 2 when a double potential was applied. The ECL immunosensor for the determination of hIgG showed a linear range of 1.0\u00d710 \uf02d13 -1.0\u00d710 \uf02d8 g/mL with a detection limit of 5.0\u00d710 \uf02d14 g/mL. This immunosensor has high sensitivity, wide linearity and good reproducibility. The superior sensitivity of the proposed ECL immunoassay mainly derives from the incorporation of ABEI-GC, which not only improves the ECL intensity, response speed, and stability, but also provides a large specific surface for high levels of protein loading. This work reveals that ABEI-GC is good nano-interface for the construction of ECL biosensors. Our strategy is promising for protein detection and may open up a new avenue for ultrasensitive label-free immunoassays.",

However, conventional immunoassays based on labeling techniques are generally tedious, time-consuming, and costly, and may lead to the denaturizing of the modified biomolecules [3] [4] [5] . Therefore, there has been great interest in developing low-cost label-free biosensors. The main advantage of label-free strategies is that they do not require the labeling of the antibody or antigen with markers, which makes the experimental process simple, low cost, and timesaving. Label-free immunoassays combined with various detection techniques such as piezoelectricity [6] , surface plasmon resonance [7] , electrochemistry [8] , chemiluminescence (CL) [9] , and ECL [10, 11] have been developed.",

In our previous work, graphene was successfully functionalized with ABEI via \uf070-\uf070 interactions that exhibited good CL activity [23] .

When the double-step potential was applied to the electrode, a pulse ECL signal was obtained.

The impedance spectra consisted of a semicircle at high ac modulation frequency and a line at low ac modulation frequency, which demonstrated that the electrode process was controlled by electron transfer at high frequency and by diffusion at low frequency. The electron transfer resistance decreased with the decrease of the diameter of the semicircle. Our stepwise EIS measurements of the modified ITO electrode at different modification steps were carried out at the PDMS reservoir because this placement ensured the same electrode area. It can be seen that when ABEI-GC was assembled on the ITO electrode, the electron transfer resistance increased remarkably (Curve b) compared with the bare ITO electrode (Curve a). After further modification with chitosan, an insulating layer was created on the surface of as-prepared electrode, resulting in an increased electron transfer resistance (Curve c). Once the Ab-AuNPs were further assembled on the electrode (Curve d), the electron transfer resistance decreased significantly due to the superior conductivity of AuNPs, which facilitated the electron transfer between the protein active center and the electrode surface and led to a net decrease in electron transfer resistance. After further incorporation of BSA, the electron-transfer resistance elevated largely as expected (Curve e), because the proteins blocked the electron transfer. Therefore, we increased the electron transfer resistance after more hIgG was attached to the surface of the modified electrode (Curve f). The entire EIS dataset indicated that the electrode was modified as expected.",

To obtain optimal ECL signaling, the effects of pH value, pulse period, pulse time, pulse potential, initial potential, and concentration of H 2 O 2 on the ECL intensity should be investigated. The effect of pH on the ECL intensity was examined in the range of 8.95-11.37 in 0.02 mol/L CBS. Figure 6(a) shows the pH dependence of the ECL intensity; maximal ECL intensity was obtained at pH 9.95. The effect of the initial pulse potential in the range of \uf02d0.3-0.3 V was also investigated (Figure 6(b) ). When the initial pulse potential was 0 V, maximal ECL intensity was achieved; probably because the initial pulse potential of 0 V had a better diffusion controlled reaction on the surface of the modified electrode. Therefore, an initial pulse potential of 0 V was used in the following experiments. The effect of the pulse potential in the range of 0.4-0.8 V was studied as well ( Figure 6(c) ). The ECL intensity increased with the increase of the pulse potential because the electro-oxidation was much faster at higher electrode potential. A pulse potential of 0.6 V was adopted because the stability and reproducibility of the modified electrode declined if a high potential (above 0.6 V) was used. The effect of pulse time on the ECL intensity was examined in the range of 0.025-0.125 s (Figure 6(d) ). The ECL intensity increased with the pulse time. However, when the pulse time was longer than 0.1 s, the ECL intensity decreased rapidly at the second period and could not reach a stable ECL signal in the following period. This result occurred because the diffusion layer on the surface of electrode became thicker in a relatively long pulse time and could not recover in the next pulse. Therefore, a pulse time of 0.1 s was selected. The effect of the pulse period on the ECL intensity was investigated in the range of 10-50 s (Figure 6(e) ). The ECL intensity increased with the pulse period, which might have been due to more-effective diffusion of H 2 O 2 in a longer pulse period. To obtain a shorter analytical time and higher ECL intensity, a pulse period of 30 s was adopted in the following experiments. The ECL intensity increased with the increase of the concentration of H 2 O 2 and reached maximum at 1.0 mmol/L ( Figure 6 (f)). Therefore, 1.0 mmol/L H 2 O 2 was used in the following experiments.",

Due to the high conductivity and the electrocatalytic activity of the graphene-based immunosensor as well as the superior ECL property of ABEI-GC, trace amounts of hIgG were successfully determined by the as-prepared immunosensor with good ECL response. Furthermore, the large specific surface area of graphene afforded high protein loading and the gold nanoparticles could further enhance the ECL intensity. As a result, the sensor showed an extremely sensitive response to hIgG in a linear range of 1.0\u00d710 \uf02d13 -1.0\u00d710 \uf02d8 g/mL with a detection limit of 5.0\u00d710 \uf02d14 g/mL. Moreover, the label-free ECL immunosensor showed good precision as well as acceptable stability and reproducibility, which indicate great potential in clinical applications. This research provides a promising technique for protein detection, which may open up a new avenue for ultrasensitive label-free immunoassays.
