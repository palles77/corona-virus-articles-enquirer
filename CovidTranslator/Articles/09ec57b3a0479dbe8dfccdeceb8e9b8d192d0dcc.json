Similarly the Assyrians contaminated the wells of their enemies with rye ergot.

            "text": "In 1969 President Richard Nixon halted offensive biological and toxin research and production in the United States. Stockpiles of various biological agents and toxins, including Bacillus anthracis, botulinum toxin, and Francisella tularensis, were subsequently destroyed. In 1972 the United States, the United Kingdom, the USSR, and more than 100 other nations ratified the Biological Weapons Convention (BWC). The BWC prohibits the development, production, and stockpiling of weapons of mass destruction. 1, 3 Despite this, during the last 40 years, multiple signatory nations have violated the pact set forth by the BWC. Additionally, there has been a rise in the use of biological agents in terrorist attacks, including the anthrax attacks in 2001, which resulted in few deaths but widespread fear. 2 The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have organized biological weapons into three categories (Table 123-1) . Category A, or high-priority agents, include organisms that can be easily disseminated, result in high mortality, and have the potential to cause significant public panic. Anthrax, botulism, smallpox, tularemia, and the viral hemorrhagic fevers are included in category A. Category B agents, including food and water safety threats, are moderately easy to disseminate. Although mortality rates due to these agents are lower they may result in significant morbidity. Finally, category C agents are considered emerging pathogens. These agents may be adapted in the future to take full advantage of their pathogenicity, availability, and lethality.",

[6] [7] [8] Each community utilizing syndromic surveillance must ultimately set its own threshold level for activation. These thresholds should be set using historical data, hazard vulnerability analysis, and risk-benefit calculations for each syndrome.",

Although written assessments are easily administered to large groups of people and the data obtained are generally easier to analyze, they frequently focus on the capacity as opposed to the capabilities of a system. Although important, these factors do not ensure an effective emergency response. Exercises, in contrast, may be discussion based or operations based and generally provide a more realistic view of an organization's capability to mobilize resources and infrastructure. However, real-time exercises are rarely evaluated with standard metrics to identify and address performance gaps. 13 Moving forward it is essential to incorporate evaluations into routine public health functions. 14 In 2009 public health practitioners in both Los Angeles and New York City embedded assessments into influenza A H1N1 vaccination campaigns. 15 As a result, invaluable information was gained about the optimal placement of points of dispensing influenza vaccines within a community and the potential for scaling up electronic immunization information systems to better track immunization progress and manage supply and distribution of vaccines in a pandemic. 16, 17 Although it may be difficult to identify questions and develop research protocols in the midst of an emergency, the time between events can serve as an opportunity to engage leaders, develop template protocols, and prioritize areas for investigation. 14 SUMMARY Ultimately, leaders must make decisions regarding public health responses with imperfect, limited data. The information provided by surveillance systems, used in conjunction with clinical data, will ultimately help public health practitioners identify an etiologic agent. As preparedness strategies become more standardized and evidence based, our ability to respond to public health emergencies, including biological attacks, will improve. Each chapter in Section 12 will cover a specific biological agent. The authors will outline what is known about the agent currently and, from this, attempt to extrapolate how this agent might be used in a bioterrorism attack.",
