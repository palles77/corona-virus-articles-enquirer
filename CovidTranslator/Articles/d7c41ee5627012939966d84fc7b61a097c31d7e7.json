Foals should urinate within the first 24 hours of life, and urine should become progressively more dilute as they begin to consume a liquid diet. Newborn colts will occasionally be born with a persistent frenulum preventing them from dropping their penis to urinate. This condition is generally not a concern, as it will resolve over time. Many normal foals are born with a mild degree of carpal and fetlock valgus in their front limbs and slight varus in their hind fetlocks. This condition typically resolves as they grow. Foals should pass meconium, the first feces, within 12 to 24 hours. Meconium is dark brown to tan and may be hard or pasty. Subsequent milk feces are yellow tan and typically softer in consistency.",

A nasogastric tube is placed, and the aspiration to assess gastric residuals is negative. Approximately 60 mL of milk is given via the nasogastric (NG) tube. If the foal tolerates the feeding (no colic signs and <40 mL residual on subsequent NG tube aspiration), an additional 100 mL is fed 1 to 2 hours later. The goal is to reach approximately 400 mL every 2 hours (10% of body weight) over a 24-hour period. If unable to reach this goal within 24 hours, consider the addition of parenteral nutrition. Field Triage of the Neonatal Foal to milk, mare's milk replacer is high in potassium and low in sodium and chloride. When using a milk replacer, it is important to provide a fresh-water source to avoid the risk of hypernatremia caused by the excess salt ingestion. A milk replacer designed for foals is ideal to ensure adequate protein, fat, and carbohydrates. Most of the ingredients should be milk based rather than plant based.",

The signs of rib fractures may include tachypnea (often shallow rapid breathing), tachycardia, chest wall edema 1/\u00c0 crepitus at the fracture site, and clinical signs of hemorrhage. Auscultation over the fracture site may reveal a click that occurs with the respiratory cycle. Most rib fractures occur near the costochondral junction and are best visualized by ultrasound examination using a linear probe placed parallel with and on top of the rib.",

Clinical signs of ischemic enteropathy can range from mild colic and intolerance of enteral feeding to profound ileus, sepsis, and bloody diarrhea. Affected foals may present with other organ dysfunction. Sepsis may develop secondarily to bacterial translocation across the damaged gastrointestinal mucosal barrier. When presented with a foal with enterocolitis and diarrhea, it is important to institute symptomatic treatment regardless of the cause. Foals with enterocolitis often do not tolerate oral feeding. Injured enterocytes may be unable to digest nutrients resulting in bacterial overgrowth in the large bowel, gas production, and further colic. Auscultation and ultrasound examination should be performed to assess motility. A nasogastric tube should be placed to check for reflux and gastric distension. Decreasing or temporarily stopping enteral feeding may be necessary, as feeding may exacerbate clinical signs. Symptomatic therapy includes IV fluid support (see section on IV fluid therapy) Withhold feeding until motility returns; gradual reintroduction to enteral feeding (see nutrition section) Broad-spectrum antimicrobial therapy: for diarrhea, consider addition of metronidazole 15 to 25 mg/kg every 6 hours Parenteral nutritional support (see section on nutritional support) Antiinflammatory therapy Gastric ulcer prophylaxis Lactase supplementation when reinstituting feeding",
