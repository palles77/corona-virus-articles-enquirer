While much is known about peroxisomal matrix protein import, our understanding of how peroxisomal membrane proteins (PMPs) are targeted and inserted into the peroxisome membrane is extremely limited. Here, we show that PEX19 binds a broad spectrum of PMPs, displays saturable PMP binding, and interacts with regions of PMPs required for their targeting to peroxisomes. Furthermore, mislocalization of PEX19 to the nucleus leads to nuclear accumulation of newly synthesized PMPs. At steady state, PEX19 is bimodally distributed between the cytoplasm and peroxisome, with most of the protein in the cytoplasm. We propose that PEX19 may bind newly synthesized PMPs and facilitate their insertion into the peroxisome membrane. This hypothesis is supported by the observation that the loss of PEX19 results in degradation of PMPs and/or mislocalization of PMPs to the mitochondrion.",

How the cell assembles and maintains this complex array of subcellular organelles is a central issue in cell biology. It is also a critical subject of evolutionary biology given that the genesis of each organelle represents a watershed event in the evolution of eukaryotic life. The peroxisome is a ubiquitous organelle of eukaryotic cells that participates in a wide variety of metabolic processes (Wanders and Tager, 1998) . However, the mechanism of peroxisome biogenesis has yet to be elucidated, and there is no cogent model for the genesis of this organelle.",

Of these processes, most is known about peroxisomal matrix protein import. Proteins destined for the peroxisome matrix are encoded by nuclear genes, synthesized in the cytoplasm (Lazarow and Fujiki, 1985) , and contain either of two peroxisomal targeting signals, PTS1 and PTS2 (Subramani, 1993) . Import of these proteins is dependent upon PEX5 and PEX7, the receptors for the PTS1 and PTS2 (McCollum et al., 1993; Marzioch et al., 1994) , and occurs in an ATP-dependent manner (Imanaka et al., 1987) . The fact that the PTS receptors are predominantly cytoplasmic proteins (Marzioch et al., 1994; Dodt et al., 1995) has suggested models of import in which the receptors act as shuttles, delivering newly synthesized matrix proteins to the peroxisome Dodt and Gould, 1996; Hettema et al., 1999) . These models also invoke a variety of other peroxins that catalyze the translocation of proteins across the peroxisome membrane and return the PTS receptors to the cytoplasm.",

            "text": "Although peroxisomes play critical roles in numerous metabolic pathways they are not essential for cell viability. Therefore, it is not surprising that defects in peroxisome biogenesis can cause human diseases by interfering with peroxisomal metabolic processes. Zellweger syndrome (ZS) and related diseases are characterized by defects in peroxisome biogenesis and the loss of multiple peroxisomal metabolic processes (Lazarow and Moser, 1995) . Consistent with the complexity of organelle biogenesis, mutations in any of at least 12 different PEX genes can cause ZS. In most cases, loss of PEX gene activity disrupts peroxisomal matrix protein import, but has no effect on the synthesis of peroxisome membranes or import of peroxisomal membrane proteins (PMPs; Santos et al., 1988; Chang et al., 1999b) . However, there are a few rare ZS patients who lack detectable peroxisomal structures, indicating that the genes defective in these patients, PEX3 , PEX16 , and PEX19 , are involved in synthesis of the peroxisome membrane or import of PMPs (Matsuzono et al., 1999; South and Gould, 1999; South, S.T., K.A. Sacksteder, S.J. Gould, manuscript in preparation) . Studies in yeast have identified up to 20 PEX genes that are required for peroxisome biogenesis, and again, most mutants appear competent for PMP import (Hettema et al., 1999) .",

PMPs lack recognizable PTS1-or PTS2-like features (Subramani, 1993) , most pex mutants that disrupt matrix protein import have no effect on PMP import (Chang et al., 1999b) , and PMP import appears to be ATP-independent (Diestelkotter and Just, 1993) . To better understand the molecular mechanisms of PMP import and the synthesis of the peroxisome membrane, we examined the biochemical properties of PEX19, a protein that is required for the synthesis of peroxisome membranes in both human and yeast cells (Gotte et al., 1998; Matsuzono et al., 1999) . We report here that human PEX19 is a predominantly cytoplasmic PMP-binding protein, and we discuss the relevance of our findings for PMP import and peroxisome biogenesis.",

The plasmids pcDNA3-PEX3 , pcDNA3-PEX14 , pcDNA3-PMP34 , pcDNA1/Amp-PMP70 , pcDNA3-ALDP , and pcDNA3-ALDR all contained the full-length ORF for the gene downstream of the cytomegalovirus promoter and T7 promoter in the appropriate vector. Myc tags were appended to these genes and to human PMP22 , PMP24 , PEX11 \u2423 , and PEX13 by amplification using primers designed to append Asp718 and BamHI sites at the 5 \u0408 and 3 \u0408 ends, respectively, and these fragments were cloned upstream of and in-frame with a 12-amino acid myc tag in the plasmid pcDNA3myc (Yahraus et al., 1996) . The plasmids pJL59W-PEX10 , pJL59W-PEX11 \u2424 , pJL59W-PEX12 , and pJL59W-PEX13 contain the ORF of each gene in-frame with the GAL4 DNA binding domain of pJL59W. Control plasmids used in the blot overlay experiments (SP6-Tim23 , SP6-Aac2 , SP6-MIR1 , T7-IBV-M , and T7-VSV-G ) were obtained from Drs. Robert Jensen and Carolyn Machamer (The Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD). The plasmids pcDNA3-PMP70 myc, pcDNA3-\u232c C395 PMP70 myc, pcDNA3-\u232c C476-PMP70 myc, pcDNA3-\u232c C535 PMP70 myc, pcDNA3-\u232c C558 PMP70 myc, pcDNA3-\u232c C578 PMP70 myc, and pcDNA3-\u232c C598 PMP70 myc were created by amplifying the appropriate regions of the human PMP70 cDNA with oligonucleotides designed to append an Asp718 site immediately upstream of the start codon (GGTACCATG; start codon underlined) and a BamHI site after the last codon of the desired ORF. These fragments were cleaved with Asp718 and BamHI and inserted between the Asp718 and BamHI sites of pcDNA3myc. The plasmids pcDNA3-\u232c N119-PEX11 \u2424 myc, pcDNA3-\u232c N180 PEX11 \u2424 myc, pcDNA3-\u232c N210 PEX11-\u2424 myc, pcDNA3-\u232c C231 PEX14 myc, and pcDNA3-\u232c C270 PEX14 myc were all created in a similar fashion. Bacterial vectors designed to express 6xHis-PEX14, mutant forms of 6xHis-PEX14, 6xHis-PTE1, and 6xHis-XECI were created by transferring the coding regions of each clone into the bacterial expression vector, pT7-His (Geisbrecht et al., 1999) . For all plasmids, any regions generated by PCR were sequenced to ensure the absence of any unintended mutations.",

We used the yeast two-hybrid assay as a crude screen to identify candidate PEX19-binding proteins. Full-length human PEX19 was expressed as a GAL4 AD fusion and screened against a panel of GAL4 DNA BD fusions to all 14 known human PEX proteins. Coexpression of AD-PEX19 and BD fusions with PEX10, PEX11 \u2424 , PEX12, or PEX13 led to activation of GAL4-regulated reporter genes, shown here by LacZ filter assays ( Fig. 1 A) . These results were particularly intriguing because PEX10, PEX11 \u2424 , PEX12, and PEX13 are all integral PMPs, but their roles in peroxisome biogenesis differ: PEX11 \u2424 participates in the regulation of peroxisome abundance (Schrader et al., 1998) ; PEX13 is thought to act in matrix protein import as part of the receptor docking apparatus (Hettema et al., 1999) ; and PEX10 and PEX12 act in matrix protein import downstream of receptor docking (Chang et al., 1999a) . Although we failed to detect an interaction signal in strains that express AD-PEX19 and BD fusions with five other peroxin PMPs (PEX2, PEX3, PEX11 \u2423 , PEX14, and PEX16), negative results in this assay can be caused by a variety of nonspecific problems, such as poor expression, improper folding, and failure to target to the nucleus, none of which were controlled for in this study. Furthermore, it should be noted that the yeast two-hybrid assay is generally not useful for assessing interactions with integral membrane proteins (Drees, 1999 ) such as the PMPs tested here.",

To this end, we expressed and purified recombinant PEX19 in bacteria and tested whether it could bind a variety of integral PMPs with diverse functions. Equal amounts of recombinant PEX19 and a nonspecific control protein (XECI; Geisbrecht, B.V., and S.J.

Recombinant PEX19 bound PEX12 and PEX13, two of the PMPs that interacted with PEX19 in the yeast two-hybrid assay, as well as to two other peroxin PMPs, PEX3 and PEX14 (Fransen et al., 1998;  Fig. 1 B) . Importantly, PEX19 also bound three PMPs that do not appear to participate in peroxisome biogenesis: PMP70, a peroxisomal ATP-binding cassette transporter (Kamijo et al., 1990 ); PMP34, a peroxisomal solute carrier (Wylin et al., 1999; Fig. 1 B) ; and ALDR (data not shown), another ATPbinding cassette transporter of the peroxisome membrane (Lombard-Platet et al., 1996) .",

We tested this hypothesis, as well as whether PEX19 could bind PMPs within human cells, using a completely independent assay. Specifically, we targeted PEX19 to the nucleus and asked whether this resulted in nuclear accumulation of newly synthesized PMPs. Wild-type PEX19 accumulates in the cytoplasm when overexpressed (Fig. 3 A) , but a form of PEX19 containing a nuclear localization signal (NLS/PEX19) is instead targeted to the nucleus (Fig. 3 , B and C). Normal human fibroblasts were cotransfected with plasmids designed to express a variety of epitope-tagged PMPs and either pcDNA3 or pcDNA3-NLS/ PEX19 . 4 h after transfection, the distribution of the newly synthesized PMPs was determined by immunofluorescence microscopy. As expected for a PMP, PEX14myc was imported into peroxisomes in cells cotransfected with pcDNA3. In contrast, PEX14myc was found in the nucleus of cells that were cotransfected with pcDNA3-NLS/ PEX19 (Fig. 3 , D-F). This PMP was never detected in the nucleus in the absence of NLS/ PEX19 expression. NLS/PEX19 expression also resulted in the nuclear import of newly synthesized PMP34myc, ALDPmyc (a myc-tagged version of another nonperoxin PMP [Mosser et al., 1993 [Mosser et al., , 1994 ), PEX3myc, PEX11 \u2424 myc, and PEX12myc (Chang et al., 1997; Fig. 3 , G-U). Similar results were observed for PMP70myc, ALDRmyc, PEX10myc (Warren et al., 1998) , PEX11 \u2423 myc (Schrader (South and Gould, 1999) , PMP24myc (Reguenga et al., 1999) , and PMP22myc (Diestelkotter and Just, 1993 ; data not shown).",

One obvious possibility is that PEX19 may interact with regions of PMPs that are involved in targeting to peroxisomes. To test whether this might be true, we examined the regions of several human PMPs that are required for targeting to peroxisomes and tested whether they retained the ability to bind to PEX19. The integral PMPs, PMP70, PEX11 \u2424, and PEX14, were chosen for these studies. COOH-terminal truncations of PMP70, each of which carried a COOHterminal myc epitope tag, were expressed in human fibro-blasts and their subcellular distributions were determined by immunofluorescence. The first 124 amino acids of PMP70 were sufficient to direct it into peroxisomes (Fig. 4 , B and C). This same segment of PMP70 is efficiently misdirected to the nucleus in cells that overexpress NLS/ PEX19 (Fig. 4, D and E) . The first 101, 81, or 61 amino acids of PMP70 are also able to mediate peroxisomal targeting but only at reduced efficiency. These shorter pieces of PMP70 were localized to both peroxisomes and mitochondria, as shown here for \u232cC598 PMP70, the smallest of the three proteins (Fig. 4, F and G) . The positive identification of the tubulovesicular structures as mitochondria was confirmed by colocalization with a mitochondrial marker (Mi- toTracker; data not shown). These three pieces of PMP70 retained their ability to interact with PEX19, as seen by the misdirection of \u232cC598 PMP70 to the nucleus in cells overexpressing NLS-PEX19 (Fig. 4, H and I) .",

However, they are qualitative in nature since they rely on the nuclear mislocalization assay for assessing PEX19 interaction. To apply a more quantitative PEX19 binding assay to this question, we performed a limited analysis of PEX14 targeting elements. Epitope-tagged forms of PEX14 were generated and their subcellular distributions were determined by immunofluorescence. Full-length PEX14 was efficiently imported into peroxisomes, but a fragment of PEX14, containing amino acids 1-108, did not associate with peroxisomes (Fig. 6, A-E) . A segment of PEX14, containing amino acids 1-147, associated with peroxisomes but only poorly, with much of the protein being imported into mitochondria (Fig. 6, F and G) . The affinity of PEX19 for these three forms of PEX14 was determined by expressing and purifying each protein from bacteria and assaying its ability to compete labeled PEX14 from PEX19. Unlabeled full-length PEX14 effectively displaced labeled PEX14 at a concentration of 10 M, as expected (Fig. 6 H) . The mutant containing amino acids 1-147 of PEX14, which was targeted to peroxisomes only poorly, also competed poorly: the 1-147-amino acid segment showed weak competition at 10 M, competed 50% of the labeled PEX14 from PEX19 at a concentration of 30 M, and reduced the amount of labeled PEX14 to 10% of the control at a concentration of 100 M. The fragment of PEX14 that was not transported to peroxisomes, amino acids 1-108, failed to compete labeled PEX14 from PEX19 at all three concentrations. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that PMP targeting elements retain PEX19 binding. However, these results do not establish that PEX19 binds to PMP targeting signals, for we have yet to identify the targeting signals in these human PMPs.",

If true, the homogenization and permeabilization experiments may have released PEX19 from peroxisomes without affecting the distribution of other peroxisomal proteins. Because it is virtually impossible to control directly for this possibility, we decided instead to address this issue indirectly by determining whether farnesylation was critical for PEX19 function. PEX19 is farnesylated via the cysteine residue at position 296, and we generated a PEX19 mutant in which this cysteine is replaced by an alanine (PEX19/C296A) and is, therefore, unable to accept the farnesyl moiety. We transfected a PEX19-deficient human fibroblast cell line with pcDNA3, pcDNA3-PEX19, and pcDNA3-PEX19/C296A, and assessed the ability of each plasmid to restore peroxisome biogenesis in these cells (Fig. 7, D-F) . Transfection with the empty vector had no effect, expression of WT PEX19 led to rescue of peroxisome biogenesis in \u202b%05\u0641\u202c of the cells, and expression of PEX19/C296A led to restoration of peroxisome biogenesis in a similarly high number of the cells. Quantitation of relative rescue activities revealed that the C296A mutation had only a mild effect on PEX19 activity, reducing it to \u202b%08\u0641\u202c the activity of wild-type PEX19. Therefore, it appears that farnesylation has an ancillary effect on PEX19 function and that PEX19 functions well in the absence of the farnesyl moiety.",

We examined the fates of additional PMPs in PEX19-deficient cells to assess the role of PEX19 in the biogenesis of other PMPs. Immunofluorescence studies showed that normal human fibroblasts contain hundreds of PMP70-containing peroxisomes but, as previously demonstrated, PEX19-deficient cells lack detectable PMP70containing structures (Fig. 8, A and B) . Similar results were observed when these cells were stained with antibodies specific for the integral PMPs PEX13 and PEX11\u2424 (Fig. 8, C-F) . However, not all PMPs were undetectable in PEX19-deficient cells. Immunoblot experiments revealed that the integral PMP PEX14 was present at similar levels in PEX19-deficient cells as in other PEX mutants (data not shown) and was easily detectable in these cells by immunofluorescence. However, the PEX14 in these cells was not present in peroxisome-like structures or other small vesicles, but was instead mislocalized to the mitochondria (Fig. 9 , A-C). Similar mitochondrial mislocalization was observed for myc-tagged derivatives of several integral PMPs that were introduced by transfection. These included the integral PMPs PEX12 (Fig. 9 , D-F) and ALDP (Fig. 9 , G-I). Similar mitochondrial mislocalization was observed when PEX13 and PEX11\u2424 were overexpressed in the PEX19-deficient cells (data not shown). Snyder et al. (1999) recently reported that minute, PEX3-containing minivesicles may exist in PEX19-deficient cells of the yeast Pichia pastoris. We could not directly test whether similar structures exist in human PEX19-deficient cells because we lack antibodies of sufficient titer to PEX3. However, myc-tagged PEX3, like the other PMPs we tested, was easily detected in peroxisomes of normal cells, but was mislocalized to mitochondria of PEX19-deficient cells (Fig. 9 , J-L). ) is to the left, and the abundance of PEX19 in each fraction was determined by immunoblot (lower panel, arrow).

PMPs, like peroxisomal matrix proteins, are synthesized on cytoplasmic ribosomes and imported posttranslationally, but it is unclear how the cell recognizes PMPs, directs them to the peroxisome, and inserts them into the peroxisome membrane bilayer. PMPs lack the PTS1 and PTS2 signals that direct proteins to the peroxisome matrix and do not require either the PTS1 or PTS2 receptors for import into peroxisome membranes (Chang et al., 1999b) . Mutants that are defective in PMP import would be expected to lack detectable peroxisomal structures, and this phenotype has been reported for a Zellweger syndrome patient with mutations in PEX19, as well as a Saccharomyces cerevisiae pex19 mutant (Gotte et al., 1998; Matsuzono et al., 1999) .

The binding activity of PEX19 appeared to be specific for PMPs as PEX19 failed to bind peroxisomal matrix proteins or integral membrane proteins that reside in the plasma, Golgi, or mitochondrial membranes. The fact that PEX19-PMP binding could be assayed in vitro allowed us to further characterize the nature of PEX19-PMP binding. Using PEX14 as a test PMP, we found that the PEX19-PMP interaction displayed a dissociation constant of \u202b005\u0641\u202c nM, which is well within the range expected for a reversible protein-protein interaction. For comparison, it is interesting to note that the complex between PTS1-containing peroxisomal matrix proteins and PEX5, the PTS1 receptor, also has a dissociation constant of \u202b005\u0641\u202c nM (Terlecky et al., 1995) .",

In this second assay, PEX19 interacted with 14 human PMPs, including the same set of 7 PMPs that PEX19 bound to in the blot overlay assay (PEX3, PEX12, PEX13, PEX14, PMP70, PMP34, and ALDR) as well as 7 more PMPs (PEX10, PEX11\u2423, PEX11\u2424, PEX16, ALDP, PMP22, and PMP24). Furthermore, we observed that PEX19 interacted with four human PMPs in the yeast twohybrid assay: PEX10, PEX11\u2424, PEX12, and PEX13. All told, we observed interaction of PEX19 with nine human PMPs in at least two independent assays (PEX12 and PEX13 in all three assays; PEX3, PEX14, PMP70, PMP34, ALDR in the blot overlay and nuclear mislocalization assays; and PEX11\u2424 and PEX10 in the two-hybrid and nuclear mislocalization assays) and 14 human PMPs altogether. It should be noted that ours are not the first evidence that PEX19 can bind PMPs, as previous reports have demonstrated that S. cerevisiae PEX19 binds PEX3 (Gotte et al., 1998) and that P. pastoris PEX19 binds PEX3 and PEX10 (Snyder et al., 1999) . Although we did not detect interaction of PEX19 with several PMPs assayed in the yeast two-hybrid assay (PEX2, PEX3, PEX11\u2423, PEX14, and PEX16), these results are difficult to interpret in the absence of controls for the expression, folding, and nuclear targeting of the various GAL4BD-PMP fusion proteins.",

However, our inability to identify the PMP targeting signals in PMP70 and PEX11\u2424 was not due to a lack of effort.

A subset of PMPs localizes to mitochondria in PEX19-deficient cells. The distribution of endogenous PEX14 was determined in wild-type (A) and PBD399 (B) fibroblasts using affinity-purified PEX-14 antibodies. The distribution of PEX12myc (D and E), ALDPmyc (G and H), and PEX3myc (J and K) was determined in wildtype (D, G, and J) and PBD399 (E, H, and K) fibroblasts using antibodies specific to the myc epitope. PBD399 fibroblasts were also stained with Mi-toTracker (C, F, I, and L).

Such problems were not encountered during the search for targeting signals in peroxisomal matrix proteins (Subramani, 1993) , and this difference is worth discussing. It is our opinion that the difficulty in identifying concise PMP targeting signals lies in the nature of protein targeting assays. Conventional targeting assays obviously measure the targeting abilities of the test proteins, but it is generally not appreciated that they also measure the retention of the protein in the organelle after the targeting event. In the case of peroxisomal matrix proteins, the retention is provided by the passive barrier of the peroxisome membrane and the assay, therefore, reflects just the targeting information of the protein. In contrast, it is difficult to envision how PMPs could be retained unless they were inserted into the peroxisome membrane, a process that is unlikely to be passive. Thus, biologically defined PMP targeting signals are likely to include signals for two potentially distinct processes: targeting, which may involve the recognition by a PMP receptor, and retention, which may require insertion of the protein into the peroxisome membrane. The targeting elements we identified in PMP70, PEX11\u2424, and PEX14 all contained a putative transmembrane domain, and it will be interesting to determine the nature of the PEX19-binding sites in these and other PMP targeting elements.",

            "text": "In addition to the test proteins we used for determining whether peroxisomal targeting elements retained the ability to bind to PEX19, it is necessary to discuss three proteins that we did not use in these particular experiments. The first is Candida boidinii PMP47. If we define a PMP targeting signal as the minimal regions that are sufficient for targeting to peroxisomes and for which the functional elements are known, the only PMP targeting signal in the literature that meets this criteria is the mPTS of C. boidinii PMP47 (Dyer et al., 1996) . We considered testing whether PEX19 recognized this mPTS, but we found that this signal is not sufficient for peroxisomal membrane targeting in human cells (Gould, S.J., unpublished observations) and it was, therefore, unclear what benefit could come from such an analysis. The other two proteins that deserve mention are PEX3 and PEX16. We detected interactions between PEX19 and these two PMPs. Like any other integral PMPs we might have considered using PEX3 or PEX16 to test whether PEX19-binding sites reside within their PMP targeting elements. This is particularly true for PEX3 since previous studies have localized a low efficiency PMP targeting element to within the first 40 amino acids of this PMP Soukupova et al., 1999) . However, we consciously avoided using these PMPs for these particular experiments because they, like PEX19, are required for peroxisome membrane biogenesis along with PEX19 (Hettema et al., 1999; Matsuzono et al., 1999; South and Gould, 1999; South, S.T., K.A. Sacksteder, and S.J. Gould, unpublished observations) . Thus, they may interact with PEX19 in multiple places and for multiple purposes. For example, it is possible that PEX19 could interact with targeting elements during the biogenesis of PEX3 and PEX16, but also bind to other regions of PEX3 and/or PEX16 as it mediates the biogenesis of other PMPs. This is not to say that an analysis of targeting signals and PEX19-binding sites in PEX3 and PEX16 is unimportant. Rather, it reflects our view that such studies will be extremely important not only for what they will tell us about general PEX19-PMP interactions, but also for the information they will provide on the roles of these three proteins in the biogenesis of peroxisome membranes. In contrast, the analysis of targeting elements and PEX19-binding sites in PMPs that are not required for peroxisome membrane synthesis, such as PMP70 and PEX11\u2424, are likely to yield data that relates only to the general role of PEX19 binding in PMP biogenesis.",

It is formally possible that PEX19 utilizes its farnesyl moiety for association with peroxisomes and that our homogenization and permeabilization procedures released PEX19 from peroxisomes without disturbing peroxisome integrity in general. To assess the general relevance of farnesylation to PEX19 function we used site-directed mutagenesis to eliminate the farnesylation site. WT PEX19 and the resulting PEX19/C296A mutant were assayed for their ability to restore peroxisome biogenesis in PEX19-deficient cells, and we found that the mutant was almost fully active (80% of WT activity). High activity also has been reported for an analogous CAAX box mutant of P. pastoris PEX19 (Snyder et al., 1999) . These studies strongly suggest that farnesylation has an ancillary rather than a central role in PEX19 function, and makes it unlikely that PEX19 uses farnesylation as its primary means for associating with peroxisomes. Our results are based on the analysis of four independent, sequence-confirmed PEX19/C296A clones, and we have no explanation for the previous report that a C296S mutant of human PEX19 had no activity (Matsuzono et al., 1999) .",

One simple model that could explain these data is that PEX19 plays an important role in the biogenesis of PMPs. For instance, the bimodal distribution of PEX19 may represent a steady state view of a cycling PMP-binding protein that facilitates the early steps in PMP biogenesis, either as a chaperone or as a PMP receptor. Such a model provides many questions for future studies, such as whether PEX19 is indeed a PMP receptor, whether PEX19 binds PMPs in the cytoplasm before their import, whether PEX19 cycles between cytoplasm and peroxisome, and whether PEX19 has additional roles when present at the peroxisome membrane.",

For instance, we failed to observe accumulation of any PMPs in the ER in the absence of PEX19, a result that would be predicted for PMPs that transit through the ER before their import into peroxisomes, as has been suggested for PEX3 and PEX16 (for review see Kunau and Erdmann, 1998; Titorenko and Rachubinski, 1998) . Also, the fact that PEX19 is a predominantly cytoplasmic PMPbinding protein with an important role in PMP biogenesis does lend some support to the model that PMPs, or at least most PMPs, are synthesized on free polyribosomes and imported directly from the cytoplasm into peroxisomes (Lazarow and Fujiki, 1985) .",
