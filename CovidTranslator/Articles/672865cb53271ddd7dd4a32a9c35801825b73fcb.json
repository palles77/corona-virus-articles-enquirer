Using Latent Dirichlet Allocation modeling, we trained an eighttopic model from the corpus. We then analyzed the semantic relationships between topics and compared the topic distribution between COVID-19 and other CoV infections. Results: Eight topics emerged overall: clinical characterization, pathogenesis research, therapeutics research, epidemiological study, virus transmission, vaccines research, virus diagnostics, and viral genomics. It was observed that COVID-19 research puts more emphasis on clinical characterization, epidemiological study, and virus transmission at present. In contrast, topics about diagnostics, therapeutics, vaccines, genomics and pathogenesis only accounted for less than 10% or even 4% of all the COVID-19 publications, much lower than those of other CoV infections. Conclusions: These results identified knowledge gaps in the area of COVID-19 and offered directions for future research. : medRxiv preprint 6 topic coherence and human understanding. The final model is visualized as a bubble graph in Fig. 2, with one bubble representing one topic and the size indicating its popularity. As shown in the figure, all the bubbles are completely separate from each other, suggesting the suitability of the model. Increasing the number of topics would make each individual topic more specific and might increase overlap between topics. Decreasing the number of topics would result in topics to be more high-level abstract.",

The coherence score is calculated by the co-occurrence frequency of the words in the sliding window, which increases with the increase of sentence similarity, meaning the higher, the better. Although the coherence score can help to decide the most appropriate topic number, such number sometimes can be still large for manually understanding. Under this circumstance, manual examination should be performed to evaluate models with different numbers of topics with the aid of expert knowledge to thoroughly understand the corpus. For each model, 15 top words per topic were examined to assess scientific coherence of the words as a set, overlap in topic words across topics, and human understandability.

First, as a computer model, topic modeling has difficulties with understanding nuances and subtext. We identified eight major topics with frequent appearances, whereas some specific topics such as virus natural history and human-animal interface were buried due to low proportions. Future work will attempt to develop an approach to detect and visualize the conceptual sub-domains. Second, it is also necessary to be aware that the granularity of terms used to label topics may vary a little for different topics. We have tried our best to keep them at the same level through carefully curating the top words in each topic, as well as reviewing text intention of the corresponding publications. Third, the LDA model only provides a cross-sectional profile of the coronavirus research, which is methodologically different from academic disciplines such as evidence-based medicine and clinical assessment that synthesizing evidence centered on a specific question. But this study may facilitate these disciplines by informing what is already available and what is urgently required for the COVID-19 research.

An LDA-based model was used to identify the hotspots and their difference between COVID-19 and other CoV infections in a quantitative way. Generally, eight main research areas are identified, i.e., clinical characterization, pathogenesis research, therapeutics research, epidemiological study, virus transmission, vaccines research, virus diagnostics, and viral genomics. The results also indicate that studies in diagnostics, therapeutics, vaccines, viral genomics, and pathogenesis are urgently needed to minimize the impact of the COVID-19 outbreak. As COVID-19 can be considered a recent emerged disease, we characterize a 'snapshot' of this field at an early stage in its development.

Topic 4 is concerned with the epidemiological study with related words such as 'health', 'outbreak', 'model', 'epidemic', 'public', 'spread', 'global', 'emerge' and 'surveillance'.

Results of this exploration present a comprehensive overview and an intellectual structure of the coronavirus research. We identified eight major research topics, analyzed their semantic relationships, and compared the topic distributions between the evolving COVID-19 research and other CoVs research. This study found more frequent appearances of clinical characterization, epidemiological study and virus transmission in COVID-19 studies. However, there still is a lack of enough research on pathogenesis, therapeutics, virus diagnostics, vaccines and viral genomics, informing the directions of scientific development in this knowledge domain. Research hotspots in our results do show similarities with the selected knowledge gaps in \"A COORDINATED GLOBAL RESEARCH ROADMAP: 2019 NOVEL CORONAVIRUS\" published by the WHO [8], which is consensus of over 400 experts from across the world. Six of our eight distinct topics ('clinical characterization', 'therapeutics research', 'epidemiological study', 'virus transmission', 'virus diagnostics' and 'vaccines research') were listed as research priorities in the roadmap. This suggests that our topic modeling successfully captured the hotspots of CoV research, thus giving us a chance to quantify how much has been investigated about COVID-19.There exists an obvious phenomenon whereby the proportions of some topics of COVID-19 are smaller or larger than the proportions of topics based only on other COVID-19 infections.",

The epidemiological study plays a key role in the blockage of virus transmission. The study of viral genomics is relatively isolated, but it is important to identify pathogens and their variants at an early stage of virus outbreak. In response to the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak, scientists in China immediately started to research the source of the new coronavirus, and rapidly published the first genome of SARS-CoV-2 on 10 January 2020, which greatly promoted virus diagnostics and epidemiological research",
