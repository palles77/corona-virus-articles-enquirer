In contrast, those working in private practices, those who tended to 'just hope for the best' when trying to avoid zoonotic diseases, and those who were not aware of industry guidelines were less likely to use PPE.",

Zoonotic diseases can cause endemic disease with long term social and economic effects or dramatic impact and acute disease outbreaks leading to high mortality and morbidity.

They are likely to be amongst the first people to encounter animals infected with zoonotic pathogens and to engage in high-risk interactions with them. And indeed, infection rates among animal health professionals are high. For example, around 30-40% of the veterinarians surveyed in two studies in the USA reported having been infected with zoonotic diseases (Schnurrenberger et al., 1978; Lipton et al., 2008) . The proportions of veterinarians suffering from zoonotic diseases have been reported to be as high as 60-65% in two other studies conducted in the UK and South Africa (Constable and Harrington, 1982; Gummow, 2003) . Veterinarians are at a particularly greater risk when investigating or controlling emerging infectious disease outbreaks as evident in the Dutch outbreak of highly pathogenic H7N7 avian influenza virus (Koopmans et al., 2004) .",

Limited studies conducted to date indicate that awareness of zoonotic disease risks and uptake of infection control practices is very low among veterinary practices and veterinarians as individuals (Jensen and Lings, 1999; Lipton et al., 2008; Wright et al., 2008) .

Therefore, this study was conducted with the objectives to understand the perceptions of zoonotic disease risk among Australian veterinarians, the infection control practices they use to protect themselves and their staff from zoonotic diseases, and the factors influencing their use of these protective practices. We anticipate that the findings from this study will provide objective evidence of the current work practices among veterinarians in Australia that can help the industry and public health authorities to enhance science based zoonosis prevention policy for veterinary practice.",

Although it is not uncommon to select a non-random sample for conducting observational studies, it does impact the external validity of the study. However, veterinarians attending the AVA conference represented 26.1% of the total number of Australian registered veterinarians in 2011, as determined from the States and Territories individual veterinary registration board registration figures. Also, the distribution of respondents by state was similar to the expected distribution, suggesting that the sample was reasonably representative of Australian veterinarians. However, if a bias were present, we expect that the results presented in this manuscript would represent a 'best case' because attendance at such a conference suggests a level of engagement with the industry and that these individuals have some level of awareness of industry issues and undertake continuing professional development. Therefore, the practices in the entire population of Australian veterinarians are likely to be even less adequate than observed in this study.",

That 44.9% of the respondents reported having contracted zoonoses (with 25.2% reporting a confirmed incidence) is evidence of the risks faced by veterinarians during the course of their veterinary work. The levels of confirmed incidence are similar to those reported in two studies conducted in the USA (Schnurrenberger et al., 1978; Lipton et al., 2008) but lower than those reported in other studies conducted in the UK and South Africa (Constable and Harrington, 1982; Gummow, 2003) . It is difficult to compare the proportions from different studies directly as they were conducted at different times in different source populations, but they do confirm that veterinarians are at higher risk of zoonotic disease infections. Despite higher levels of zoonoses, about half of the veterinarians perceived that they were at low level of risk (a little likely/not likely/not at all likely) of being exposed to zoonotic diseases from various animal species and procedures. Perceived risk of zoonotic infections was a significant driver for adequate use of PPE, as those perceiving the likelihood of exposure to zoonosis to be low, were less likely to use adequate PPE (Table 2) , potentially exposing themselves to a higher risk of zoonotic infections. This is a logical association and concurs with established theories of health behavior (such as the protection motivation theory), which suggests that perceived risk influences motivation to take protective action (Rogers, 1975; Rogers and Prentice-Dunn, 1997) .",

Veterinarians with postgraduate education can be considered more likely to be informed about current industry issues as well as to be more aware of infection control practices.

However, legal cases have occurred in the USA in which veterinarians have been held liable for zoonotic disease infections contracted by staff, due to inappropriate isolation procedures, lack of education or unsafe work practices (Wright et al., 2008) .

This is probably due to the corporate nature of most non-private organizations which can be reasonably expected to have corporate occupational health standards and protocols covering all aspects of operations, of which PPE would be just one consideration. An association has previously been documented between having infection control committees (overseeing infection control programs) in veterinary teaching hospitals and these hospitals having written policy documents on infection control (Benedict et al., 2008) . Such programs are expected to be less likely in private veterinary practices, particularly smaller private practices with lower staff numbers. Murphy et al. (2010) also present evidence of this with none of 101 community veterinary clinics in southern Ontario having an infection control program. Similarly, a significant association between the absence of a written infection control policy in the work place and a low precaution awareness (based on reported likelihood to take protective action) was identified among small animal and equine veterinarians in the United States (Wright et al., 2008) . Given that 79.9% of the veterinarians in this survey worked in a private veterinary practice, the level of implementation of strict biosecurity protocols in the majority of veterinary workplaces is questionable and an area of concern.",

There was a similar but non-significant trend for equine veterinarians (Table 2 ). In contrast, in the US study by Wright et al.

In that study, most small animal and equine veterinarians but fewer than half of the large animal practitioners reported always isolating the patient and restricting human access when dealing with an animal suspected of having a serious zoonotic disease. Further investigations are required to understand the reasons for differences in adequate use of PPE in different practice types but the results of this study support the findings from research conducted in human health settings which show that uptake of infection control practices is influenced by a complex combination of institutional, logistical, social, and psychological factors (Whitby et al., 2007) .",

Veterinarians' use of PPE is associated with their perception of the risks, and their determination of risk must necessarily be grounded in their knowledge base and their attitudes, such as their ability to control the threat. Increasing information may help to bring veterinarians' use of PPE more closely in line with zoonotic disease risks. Good quality training can strengthen our communal knowledge about zoonotic disease risks and improve the quality of decision making about PPE use in different practice contexts. Further equipping veterinarians with a framework for risk assessment and risk management (such as presented in the AVA Guidelines for Veterinary Personal Biosecurity) provides a decision tree to assess and implement appropriate action to prevent pathogen transmission in any animal disease context. This is the approach needed to improve the quality of decision making by veterinarians regarding the use of PPE to address their zoonotic disease exposure risks.",

Veterinarians who do not consider PPE in the course of their daily work are failing in their duty of care (AVA, 2001) to adopt work practices that do not expose themselves, their staff and others to avoidable risk of zoonotic diseases. Targeted education of veterinarians about zoonotic disease risks is needed, along with a widespread campaign to increase awareness amongst veterinarians of the industry guidelines and standards relating to zoonotic disease, infection control programs, as well as their liabilities and legal responsibilities.",
