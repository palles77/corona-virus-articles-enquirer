            "text": "Three strains of porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) were isolated from dead or diseased pigs at different swine farms in Guangdong during 2011-2013, and their S genes were sequenced. In the same period, seven PEDV strains were also isolated in Guangdong by other laboratories. The spike sequences of 10 Guangdong isolates were compared with vaccine strains and reference pathogenic isolates using six bioinformatics tools. The results revealed that 10 Guangdong strains, excluding strain GDS03, had distinct characteristics in terms of primary structure, secondary structure, high-specificity N-glycosylation sites, potential phosphorylation sites, and palmitoylation sites. Phylogenetic analysis also confirmed these findings and revealed that all PEDV strains were clustered into three distinct groups. Ten Guangdong strains, not including GDS03, belong to Group 1, whereas four vaccine strains and GDS03 belong to Group 3, which is evolutionarily distant from Group 1. Alignment analysis of the neutralizing region amino acid sequences indicated that the amino acid substitutions of Y/D766S, T549S, and G594S that are present in the Guangdong strains, not including GDS03, were a sign of predominant genetic changes among the isolated strains. GDS03 is closely related to the 83P-5 vaccine strain, which suggests that it might represent re-isolation of the vaccine strain or vaccine variants. Taken together, these results indicate that there have been predominant new strains circulating in Guangdong from 2011 to 2013, and the circulating PEDV strains have a genetic composition that is distant from reference strains, especially the vaccine strains; however, the vaccinations might also provide some level of crossprotection, as there have been no changes in the neutralizing epitopes of SS2 and 2C10. This explains why there have been constant but infrequent outbreaks recently in comparison to late 2010 in which PEDV outbreaks were more frequent and severe. In addition, the USA-Colorado-2013 strain had the same amino acid substitutions in the neutralizing regions as the Guangdong strains except GDS03, which suggests that the information and strategies in this study may play role in PEDV variant research in other countries.",

            "text": "Porcine epidemic diarrhea (PED), which is characterized by vomiting, watery diarrhea, and dehydration, is a highly contagious enteric disease. When PED occurs in a swine farm, nursery piglets usually have high morbidity and mortality, although all of the pigs are susceptible. The etiological agent of PED is porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), which was first recognized in Belgium and the UK in 1978, and it quickly spread in Europe and Asia, resulting in severe economic losses [1] [2] [3] [4] . In China, PEDV infection is a continuing problem, although a dual-combination kill vaccine against PEDV and transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) is in use. Since late 2010, PEDV variant infections have become a severe problem in the Chinese swine-production industry. Guangdong, as one of the major swine-producing provinces in China, has suffered economic loss from these new PEDV outbreaks [5] [6] [7] [8] . Seven strains were isolated in these outbreaks. In the course of our continuous PEDV surveillance activities in Guangdong, we also isolated three Vero-adapted PEDV strains (GDS01-3) from Guangdong in 2012 and 2013. Apparently, PEDV infection status has greatly changed since late 2010. Although new variants were isolated, we have less knowledge and understanding of the reason for the circulation and of the molecular profiles of these new isolates.",

            "text": "PEDV is a positive-sense single-strand RNA virus belonging to Group 1 of the genus Alphacoronavirus, within the family Coronaviridae [9] . Its genome organization is similar to other coronaviruses and is arranged into orderly 5 0 -untranslated regions (5 0 -UTRs), the polymerase gene, spikes (S), open reading frame 3 gene (ORF3), envelope (E), membrane (M), nucleocapsid (N), and 3 0 -UTR [10] . The structural protein genes, including S, E, M, and N, are located downstream, with the ORF3 gene among the genes as the only accessory gene. Among the structural proteins encoded by the genes mentioned above, the S protein, a glycoprotein peplomer on the viral surface, plays an important role in the process of inducing neutralizing antibodies and specific receptor binding [11] . Several neutralizing peptides (SS2, SS6, 2C10, and COE) have been identified in the spike protein of PEDV [12] [13] [14] . In addition, mutations within the S gene are also associated with the adaption process in vitro and the induction of attenuation in vivo [15] . Some studies of CoVs S have revealed that the differences within the S protein influence the induction of syncytia in infected cells [15, 16] . To better understand the newly isolated PEDV strains in Guangdong and effectively prevent related outbreaks, it is necessary to investigate the molecular changes of the spike gene of the new variants and compare them with early reference isolates and glycoprotein peplomer vaccine strains. The evaluation of sequence property, primary structure, secondary structure, and leucine-rich repeat (LRR) regions could reveal whether the mutations change the structure and further impact the protein function. The aim of those tests is to form the basic structure profile of PEDV variants with reference strains. Post-translational modifications (PTMs) often strongly affecting the protein functions, N-glycosylation sites, and potential phosphorylation are studied as they relate to virus biology such as survival and virulence. In addition, palmitoylation as a special class of PTMs could enhance the surface hydrophobicity and membrane affinity of protein substrates and then may influence the virulence. Thus, palmitoylation predictions of both early strains and recent strains are needed. In this study, 10 Guangdong strains isolated from 2011 to 2013 and reference strains were evaluated for those bioinformatics features, and meanwhile, phylogenetic analysis of those strains was also performed. These findings provide useful evidence as to the nature of the circulating PEDV strains, and the implications of this study in terms of the strategies for future protection of PEDV infections are also discussed.",

These results indicated that there were at least two types of PEDV strains within the Guangdong set. Excluding the GDS03 strain, for the other nine Guangdong isolates, there were several amino acid substitutions compared with vaccine strains that changed the amino acid constitution of neutralizing epitope SS6 and neutralizing region COE. Interestingly, we noticed that both serine amino acid substitutions in COE (T549S and G594S) and in SS6 (Y/D766S) were not only present in the nine Guangdong variants but also present in other newly reported PEDV strains in China [24] and other countries such as USA. The retrospective study of the three amino acid substitutions revealed that the shift process not only existed in Chinese early strains but also presented in 2008-2009 Korea PEDV strains. From retrospective study and our analysis, the three substitutions could be seen as the marker, which make PEDV virus easy to live. Both China and Korea control the disease on pig farms with periodic vaccination strategy, and thus, we speculate that those mutations present in neutralizing regions may represent the virus evolution through escaping from the antibodies.

We noticed that this change did not suddenly appear since the shift process could be observed in the CNU-serial, KNU-serial, KH, and NK strains. Palmitoylation plays roles in modulating protein trafficking, stability, and numerous cellular processes, including signaling and apoptosis, and it has been reported that the palmitoylation site changes influence the influenza virus hemagglutinin cellular trafficking [30] and HIV-1 infectivity [31] . Thus, different palmitoylation site conformations between PEDV variants and pre-2011 Chinese strains may lead to changes in virus-host interactions and then influence the virus virulence. However, further experimental studies are required to identify the effects of the newly motif changes on virus biology.",

Thus, we also analyzed the ORF3 protein of Guangdong strains and the result showed that the ORF3 of GDS03 presents the characteristic continuous deletion of attenuated vaccine. Previously, the CHGD-01 ORF3 revealed notably five amino acid substitutions from other PEDV isolates [34] ; our study found GDS02, GD-1, and GD-A have the same substitutions with the CHGD-01 strain. Furthermore, GDS01, LC, CH-GD-2011, and particularly DX strain present four of five amino acid substitutions; the phylogenetic analysis showed those eight strains cluster in one group (data not shown). We speculated that the ORF3 of Chinese early strain DX maybe the origin of the seven Guangdong strains. These unique amino acid substitutions are further needed to test the virulence.",
