Human coronaviruses (HCoV) have been implicated in NVRI in hospitalized preterm neonates. The objectives of this study were to determine the incidence of HCoV-related NVRI in neonates and children hospitalized in a PNICU and the prevalence of viral respiratory tract infections in staff. All neonates (age 28 days) and children (age b 28 days) hospitalized between November 1997 and April 1998 were included. Nasal samples were obtained by cytological brush at admission and weekly thereafter. Nasal samples were taken monthly from staff. Virological studies were performed, using indirect immunofluorescence, for HCoV strains 229E and OC43, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), influenza virus types A and B, paramyxoviruses types 1, 2 and 3 and adenovirus. A total of 120 patients were enrolled (64 neonates and 56 children). Twenty-two samples from 20 patients were positive (incidence 16.7%). In neonates, seven positive samples, all for HCoV, were detected (incidence 11%). Risk factors for NVRI in neonates were: duration of hospitalization, antibiotic treatment and duration of parenteral nutrition (P`0.01). Monthly prevalence of viral infections in staff was between 0% and 10.5%, mainly with HCoV. In children, 15 samples were positive in 13 children at admission (seven RSV, five influenza and three adenovirus) but no NVRI were observed. In spite of a high rate of community-acquired infection in hospitalized children, the incidence of NVRI with common respiratory viruses appears low in neonates, HCoV being the most important pathogen of NRVI in neonates during this study period. Further research is needed to evaluate the long-term impact on pulmonary function.",

Their incidence varies between hospitals and within different services of each hospital. 1 A high incidence in paediatric and neonatal intensive care units (PNICUs) has been reported. 2, 3 Bacteria are the most common nosocomial agents identified, but respiratory and intestinal viruses were implicated in 23% of paediatric studies. 1 The negative impact of nosocomial viral respiratory infection (NRVI) on high-risk populations (patients who are young, immuno-compromised or afflicted with chronic disease) is well established. 4 Respiratory viruses, including respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), influenza and parainfluenza viruses and rhinovirus are the most common agents. We have previously reported a high incidence of human coronavirus (HCoV)-related infections in preterm neonates. 5 Effective preventative strategies that target nosocomial infections are based upon an appreciation of their epidemiology and their mechanisms of transmission. The epidemiological profiles of these NVRI are similar to those seen in the community in terms of frequency, season, ages affected and severity of illness. 6 Viruses are introduced into the hospital by patients (symptomatic or asymptomatic), visitors or staff. 7 Many studies have reported NVRI outbreaks in neonatal units but limited information is available on the frequency and mechanisms of NVRI.",

Causative agents included RSV (55%), rhinovirus (15%), enterovirus (15%), adenovirus (10%) and parainfluenza virus (7.5%). HCoV were not searched for in this study. Viral pneumonia was associated with a high level of morbidity, requiring oxygen and ventilatory support in 90% and 45% of cases, respectively. Prematurity was a contributing factor to severity. 22 Our study demonstrates a normal distribution of viral agents associated with community-acquired infections. In a prospective regional study on community-acquired infections, Lina et al. reported a viral origin in 36.1% of cases. RSV was the most common agent (36%), followed by HCoV (18.4%). 23 Children hospitalized during the epidemic period often introduce respiratory viruses into the hospital. 7 Goldwater et al. reported a rate of 47% in asymptomatic children hospitalized in a paediatric unit, higher than our 23.2%. However we failed to demonstrate any cross-infections with common respiratory viruses, such as RSV, between infected and non-infected children. This could be an argument against the use of specific RSV chemoprophylaxis in hospitalized high-risk neonates.",

            "text": "Our study confirms previous reports of HCoVrelated infections occurring in NICU. 5, 24 HCoV are widespread and responsible for one-third of common colds in children and adults. 25 Their role in lower respiratory infection is unclear. 26\u00b128 HCoV have been implicated in NVRI in elderly people attending a daycare unit. 29 HCoV have also been isolated in broncho-alveolar washings in immunocompromised patients, 30 but their role in nosocomial gastrointestinal disease remains unproven. 31 In 1982, an outbreak of necrotizing enterocolitis occurring in near-term babies was reported by Chany et al. 32 In our study, all the HCoV-infected neonates were symptomatic at the time of infection. The need for oxygen and ventilatory support were the main clinical features. In our previous studies, bradycardia and apnoea were the most frequent signs of infection. 5, 24 The lack of knowledge on HCoV epidemiology could be explained by an absence of effective diagnostic methods. Our study was based on indirect immunofluorescence (IIF) results, a standard method for diagnosis of respiratory viruses. We used two monoclonal antibodies specific for each HCoV serogroup, thereby increasing sensitivity. 9 Nucleic acid detection could be of interest in the diagnosis of viral NVRI. 33 PCR has demonstrated a greater sensitivity than IF for HCoV 9 and rhinovirus. 34 Molecular typing might establish mechanisms of transmission and leading to the development of more appropriate infection control measures, 33 noting the limitations of this procedure. 35 HCoV isolation in both neonates and staff suggests the possibility of patient\u00b1staff or staff\u00b1 patient transmission. HCoV are able to survive in aerosol particles, in suspension and after drying. 36, 37 Horizontal transmission is possible therefore, via air or hand contamination, as previously demonstrated for RSV. Hall et al. described an outbreak of nosocomial RSV infection in neonates with 34% of staff being contaminated. 38 Moisuk et al. reported a 35% rate in staff presenting respiratory symptoms during a parainfluenza virus outbreak occurring in a neonatal unit. 20 In conclusion, HCoV appear to be involved in NVRI in hospitalized preterm neonates. Further research is needed to evaluate the seasonal variation and the eventual impact on general and pulmonary health.",
