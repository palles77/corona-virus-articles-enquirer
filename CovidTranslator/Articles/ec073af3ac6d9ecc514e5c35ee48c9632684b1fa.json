This sequence is cleaved off by a membrane-bound protease during or immediately after synthesis: the exact length of the signal sequence in the PPT molecule has not yet been determined. Immediately preceding the sequence of substance K in the precursor is a pair of basic amino acids (Lys-Arg). A trypsinlike protease is thought to cleave the precursor after the second basic residue to liberate the N terminus of the substance K molecule. The N terminus of the substance P sequence (Arg-Pro) is preceded in the precursor by a single basic amino acid (arginine). Although the double basic amino acid 'signal' for proteolytic processing is again present, the Arg-Pro bond is selectively resistant to trypsin-like proteases and instead the cleavage occurs between the two arginine residues. Immediately following the sequences of substance P and substance K is the sequence -Gly-Lys-Arg -a pair of basic amino acids indicating a site of proteolytic processing, preceded by a glycine residue which is thought to be the donor of the amide group found at the C terminus of both peptides\". Other biologically active peptides may be liberated from the PPT sequences. In particular the sequence -Arg-Arg-Arg-Lys at the C terminus of both precursors could be a processing site, liberating peptides corresponding to residues 72-108 of cu-PPT and residues Ill-126 of p-PPT.

Alternatively they may arise from a single gene by alternative splicing events. The vast majority of eukaryotic genes consist of precisely defined regions coding for sections of mature mRNA (exons) interspersed with regions (introns) which are either deleted during the synthesis of mRNA precursors or 'spliced' out of the mRNA sequence during its maturation. The portion of the P-PPT mRNA that is missing from IX-PPT may correspond to a single exon, and both precursor mRNAs may be generated from a common gene product by different splicing events. A similar variable splicing mechanism enables a single gene (the calcitonin gene) to code for different products (calcitonin and calcitonin generelated peptide) in the thyroid and hypothalamus, respectively13.

The combined distribution of 'substance P only', 'substance P + substance K' and 'neuromedin K only' neurons might then account for the observed regional differences in substance P receptor subtypes in the nervous system. these data and the absence of a consistent abnormality in all patients with MS, a combination of influences and factors has been postulated. The most common hypothesis is that the patient with MS is genetically susceptible in some manner, possibly by way of an immunogenetic abnormality related to the major histocompatibility complex, and that a particular environmental exposure, presumably through an infectious agent such as a virus, leads to the destruction of CNS myelin'. However, explanations for recurrences, unpredictable progression and marked variations in intensity of the disease have not yet been approached by these theories.",

One of these is experimental allergic encephalomyelitis (EAE), an autoimmune response to a componerit of CNS myelin called myelin basic protein, injected with complete Freund's adjuvant which appears to be an essential but not understood 'facilitator'. Myelin'basic protein, which has a monomeric molecular weight of 18 500 and comprises 'approximately 30% of CNS myelin proteins, has been extensively studied because of this role in provoking EAES. Susceptibility to EAE varies among different animal species and strains. In rodents, the Lewis rat is the most susceptible\". Cellular immunity against myelin basic protein plays the primary role in the immunopathogenesis of acute EAE. Thus;' EAE may be passively transferred to unimmunized recipients with mononuclear cells from lymphoid tissue of sensitized animals'c canlinueoollpspd, Exposure of cells from sensitized animals to myelin basic protein bz vipo enhances the disease-producing effects of the cells transferred from donor to recipient' '. The acute form of EAE differs from MS in being more intense, usually monophasic, and pathologically showing more CNS inflammation than demyelination. However. there are now several disease models which permit the induction of a subacute or chronic form of EAE which resembles the clinical course of MS more closely,. exhibiting periods of exacerbation and remission, and which also exhibits pathology more similar to that of MS'2.'3. At least in the guinea-pig, the age of the animal is important for the development of chronic, as opposed to acute, EAE; juvenile guinea-pigs are the most susceptible to induction of the chronic form.",

A prominent feature of this demyelination was a perivascular mononuclear cell infiltration which resembled in some respects the pathology of EAE. Following this lead. it was then shown that lymphocytes from these animals had been sensitized to myelin basic protein. Furthermore, if these lymphocytes were exposed to myelin basic protein in vitro, they acquired the ability to transfer subacute demyelination passively into recipients. Control studies indicate that virus or myelin basic protein alone is neither being transferred nor causative in this passively transferred disease. Thus, this model provides preliminary information that a protracted virus infection of an unnatural and immature host may lead to subsequent demyelination and sensitization to a myelin component. It is tempting to speculate that the infection by JHM virus generates an autoimmune response against myelin basic protein, an immunogenic product of the oligodendrocyte. because the virus can manage only an abortive or chronic infection in a young unnatural host unable to support a full-blown. acute infection.",

Identification of the portion of the myelin basic protein molecule which contains the immunogenic determinants for the JHM-infected animals, whether these animals are sensitized to other myelin proteins more important in the pathogenesis of demyelination. whether humoral factors as well as cellular factors may be involved, and the possibility that the age of the animal or other temporal events influence the intensity and course of the disease may provide important new insights into the cause of MS.
