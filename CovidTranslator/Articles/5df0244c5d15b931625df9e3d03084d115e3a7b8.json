            "text": "Stimulator of interferon genes (STING; also known as MITA and MPYS, and encoded by TMEM173) is a signalling molecule associated with the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and is essential for controlling the transcription of numerous host defence genes, including type I interferons (IFNs) and pro-inflammatory cytokines, following the recognition of aberrant DNA species or cyclic dinucleotides (CDNs) in the cytosol of the cell [1] [2] [3] . The sources of DNA that induce CDNs include the genome of invading pathogens, such as herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV1), whereas certain bacteria can secrete CDNs following infection of the host 2,4 . Recent reports have indicated that potent activators of the STING pathway may also include self-DNA that has leaked from the nucleus of the host cell, perhaps following cell division or as a consequence of DNA damage 5 . Such DNA species may be responsible for causing various autoinflammatory diseases, such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) or Aicardi-Gouti\u00e8res syndrome (AGS), and may influence inflammationassociated cancer 5 . Polymorphisms in TMEM173 have been reported to influence STING-dependent innate immune signalling and might affect susceptibility to pathogen infection and contribute to severe inflammatory disorders (BOX 1) . STING signalling has now been shown to be essential for protecting the cell against a variety of pathogens and even against the development of cancer by promoting antitumour immune responses 6, 7 . Here, we review recent insights into the regulation of STING signalling and its role in autoinflammatory diseases and cancer. We also discuss new opportunities for the development of novel anti-inflammatory and antitumour compounds that specifically target this key signalling pathway.",

This event probably influences changes in STING conformation, which leads to a striking trafficking event in which STING, complexed with TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK1), relocates to perinuclear regions of the cell 2,16 . This process is required to deliver TBK1 to endo lysosomal compartments where it phosphorylates the transcription factors interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) and nuclear factor-\u03baB (NF-\u03baB).

Thus, the TLR9 and STING signalling pathways have evolved to sense different types of DNA species, although both pathways use IRF3 and NF-\u03baB to predominantly control gene induction. Furthermore, TLR9 is mainly expressed in pDCs and B cells, whereas STING is more broadly expressed 7, 18 . The STING pathway is also independent of AIM2 (absent in melanoma 2), which also interacts with non-specific dsDNA species but triggers caspase 1-mediated cleavage of the pro-inflammatory cytokines interleukin-1\u03b2 (IL-1\u03b2) and IL-18 from their precursor proteins 19 . However, STING signalling is known to potently influence the expression of the precursor proteins (but not their processing), and therefore it is possible that STING may act in concert with the AIM2 pathway 20 . Finally, although cGAS has been clearly implicated in regulating STING function through the generation of CDNs, other dsDNAbinding proteins have been shown to influence STING activity, such as \u03b3-IFN-inducible protein 16 (IFI16) and DEAD box protein 41 (DDX41), although the underlying mechanisms remain to be clarified 7 .",

It remains unclear how the genomes of DNA viruses, such as HIV and HSV1, trigger STING signalling, since the capsids are thought to deliver the viral genome to the nucleus through the nuclear pore 33 ; however, it is plausible that the viral nucleic acids may be exposed from the protective capsids soon after entry into the cell or at the nuclear pore.

Over 20% of individuals in the United States alone will suffer some form of inflammatory disease, such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA), SLE or inflammatory bowel disease 56 . In almost all cases, the aetiology of such diseases remains unknown. What is known is that patients with complex inflammation-related disorders, such as RA and SLE, exhibit high levels of antinuclear antibody (ANA), DNA and even nucleosomes in the blood, as well as high levels of circulating cytokines 57 . Self-DNA, probably from necrotic or inappropriately apoptosed cells, has therefore been implicated in the pathogenesis of these types of disease, with aberrant innate immune signalling being caused by a failure to distinguish between self and foreign nucleic acid 58 . The inability to efficiently eliminate self-DNA that could inadvertently trigger immune responses may also be a key factor in facilitating inflammatory disease. For example, a number of animal models with defects in DNases exhibit lethal inflammatory disorders. In some instances, DNase-related defects have been found in humans with comparable disease 57 . Defects in DNASE1, for example, have been implicated in autoimmune disorders in humans and mice 59 . Furthermore, mice with defects in the lysosomal DNA endonuclease Dnase2, which is essential for degrading DNA from apoptotic Figure 2 | STING signalling is essential for anti-pathogen host defence. DNA viruses and cyclic dinucleotides (CDNs) produced by certain bacteria stimulate stimulator of interferon genes (STING) activity to trigger the production of primary innate immune genes. The products from these genes can exert direct intracellular anti-pathogen activity as well as trigger the production of type I interferons (IFNs) and other cytokines that can protect uninfected cells and stimulate adaptive immune responses. cGAS, cyclic GMP-AMP synthase. cells engulfed by phagocytes, die before birth owing to the toxic effects of type I IFN overproduction 57 . However, Dnase2 \u2212/\u2212 mice are viable when crossed with mice deficient for STING (Tmem173 \u2212/\u2212 mice), as the production of apoptotic DNA-driven cytokine production by phagocytes is almost completely eliminated 20 . Mice defective in three-prime repair exonuclease 1 (Trex1; also known as Dnase3) similarly exhibit significant cytokine overproduction and inflammation and, importantly, TREX1-related mutations with concomitant disease have been reported in humans 60 . This indicates that STING signalling is responsible for the production of harmful pro-inflammatory cytokines generated by self-DNA derived from necrotic or inappropriately apoptosed cells. Such DNases almost certainly help ensure that apoptotic cells remain 'immunologically silent' follo wing phagocytosis. STING-dependent signalling was also found to be the cause of inflammation-aggravated lethality in Trex1 \u2212/\u2212 mice 61,62 . TREX1 is a 3\u0374 to 5\u0374 DNA exonuclease that degrades single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) and dsDNA substrates. Trex1 \u2212/\u2212 mice are viable but have a median lifespan of approximately 10 weeks owing, in part, to the development of inflammatory myocarditis 63 . Patients with severe SLE and AGS have been found to have mutations in TREX1, suggesting that defects in this protein are responsible for these diseases, possibly through the inability of phagocytes to degrade self-DNA 60 . Such patients typically die at a young age. However, Trex1 \u2212/\u2212 Tmem173 \u2212/\u2212 double knockout mice were relatively disease free, exhibiting reduced cytokine levels, reduced ANA levels and no signs of inflammatory myocarditis or early death 62 . Bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) or bone marrowderived dendritic cells (BMDCs) from Trex1 \u2212/\u2212 mice, but not from Trex1 \u2212/\u2212 Tmem173 \u2212/\u2212 mice, were found to produce high levels of inflammatory cytokines in the absence of any notable infection 5, 62, 64 . Furthermore, the adoptive transfer of wild-type bone marrow to irradiated Trex1 \u2212/\u2212 mice rescued mortality 62 . Thus, STING-dependent inflammatory cytokines produced by immune cells probably have an important role in TREX1-mediated inflammatory disease 65 (FIG. 3) .",

However, these might not be the only sources of cytosolic DNA. The hundreds, if not thousands, of mitochondria in the cytosol of most cells contain 2-10 copies of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA), which exist as closed circular dsDNA species of approximately 15,000 base pairs 67 . Recent evidence indicates that mitochondrial stress, such as that induced by viruses, can cause mtDNA leakage into the cytosol that can activate the STING pathway and the production of cytokines 68 . Although this particular example may be of benefit to the host, the sensing of mtDNA that has leaked into the cytosol following apoptosis-induced mitochondrial stress may have detrimental effects. However, as up to 50 billion cells undergo apoptosis in the body per day, it is thus inevitable Figure 3 | STING in autoinflammatory disease. Cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS) binds to cytosolic self-DNA and generates stimulator of interferon genes (STING)-activating cyclic dinucleotides (CDNs). The activation of STING by self-DNA can induce autoinflammatory disease. Mutations in three-prime repair exonuclease 1 (Trex1), which encodes a DNA exonuclease that degrades single-stranded DNA and double-stranded DNA substrates, can cause STING activation through failure to eliminate self-DNA that has leaked into the cytosol of the cell. Conversely, mutations in STING itself can lead to constitutive activity and autoinflammtory diseases such as STING-associated vasculopathy with onset in infancy.",

This in turn activates caspase 3 and caspase 7, which start to target cellular proteins. Despite the fact that certain caspases have an important role in apoptosis, they are not essential for cell death and in vivo clearance of cells, suggesting that they may exert other important functions 71 .

The effector caspases, caspase 3, caspase 7 and caspase 9, were shown to be required to prevent mtDNA-induced STING activation 69, 70 . How this occurs is not yet fully apparent but may involve caspase-mediated targeting of proteins involved in STING-dependent signalling or even indirect targeting of mtDNA. Of course, such events require that STING be present in cells undergoing apoptosis and fortunately, STING is not abundantly expressed in cells such as hepatocytes, which are known to contain thousands of mitochondria 7 .

It is possible that cytokines such as IL-1\u03b2 and IL-18 are secreted by damaged intestinal cells to facilitate wound repair 20, 72, 77, 78 . In the absence of wound repair, concomitant inflammation alters the microbial composition in the gut to species with enhanced genotoxic capacity, resulting in further inflammation, DNA damage and tumorigenesis 79 The phenotype of STING-deficient mice treated with AOM and DSS mimicked that of similarly treated MYD88-deficient mice; the loss of STING rendered mice susceptible to CAC 80 . Further investigation showed that AOM induced DNA damage and triggered STING-dependent cytokine production, including the production of IL-1\u03b2. It is thus possible that cGAS-STING recognizes early DNA damaging events to trigger the production of wound repair-initiating cytokines (FIG. 4b) . STING activation in damaged intestinal cells Carcinogens such as 7,12-dimethylbenz[\u03b1]anthracene (DMBA) cause DNA damage, which can result in the leakage of DNA into the cytosol and the intrinsic chronic activation of the STING pathway.

Carcinogens and inflammatory agents such as azoxymethane (AOM) and dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) also cause DNA damage that can result in the leakage of DNA into the cytosol and cause activation of the intrinsic STING pathway in intestinal cells. This event produces cytokines such as interleukin-1\u03b2 (IL-1\u03b2) or IL-18 that enable wound repair to commence.

Numerous immunotherapeutic strategies involving stimulating the adaptive immune response against cancers through checkpoint blockade are presently under evaluation in clinical trials. However, how adaptive immune responses are generated by DCs against tumour cells remains unknown. What is apparent is that type I IFN production by CD8\u03b1 + DCs is involved in tumour antigen-specific T cell activation through the cross-presentation of antigen and T cell priming 83 . The signalling pathway responsible for type I IFN induction is thought to be independent of the TLR or RIG-I-mitochondrial antiviral signalling (MAVS) protein pathways.",

One hypothesis for the underlying mechanism is that CD8\u03b1 + DCs engulf necrotic tumour cells, and the tumour cell-derived DNA triggers STING signalling in the DC 20,83-85 .

It is possible that STING is activated by DNA that is present in autophagosomes or in engulfed exosomes 83, 84 .

In some instances, STING agonists were shown to be effective against tumours that were resistant to programmed cell death protein 1 (PD1) blockade 88 .
