In 2002, a research project was carried out in a range of sectors of the Australian tourism industry to investigate the impact of the collapse of the HIH Insurance Company, the World Trade Centre attacks and the demise of Ansett Airlines on these organisations and the range of responses adopted to these events. This paper describes the preparedness of organisations to respond to these events; the personnel or human resource (HR) strategies implemented and the postscript, the organisational learning which had occurred. Interview findings indicate that there was little preparation for such events, a widespread reluctance to retrench staff, and limited organisational learning had taken place. r",

Issues explored included identifi-cation of the factors influencing the impact of these events, the relative impact of these three events on these organisations, and their short-and medium-term responses. The study also highlighted aspects of the broader operating environment, such as role of organisational policies in guiding responses to these events, and compared the events of 2001 with other 'shocks' experienced by the tourism industry. This paper, drawn from the broader study, focuses specifically on the preparedness of organisations to respond to these events, in terms of the role of policies in guiding their responses; the personnel or human resource (HR) strategies implemented, and the postscript, the extent of organisational learning which had occurred.",

Pearson and Mitroff (1993, p. 49) suggest that crises are events which pose threats to the viability of organisations. Faulkner (2001, p. 138) has distilled the work of a number of authors and indicated that the key elements of crisis situations are: a triggering event, which is so significant that it challenges the existing structure, routine operations or survival of the organization, high threat, short decision time and an element of surprise and urgency, a perception of an inability to cope among those directly affected, a turning point, when decisive change, which may have both positive and negative connotation, is imminent, characterised by 'fluid, unstable, dynamic' situations.",

            "text": "The attacks on the World Trade Centre clearly demonstrate the potential risk which terrorism poses for the tourism industry. A number of authors have highlighted the fact that tourists have become soft targets and are at risk from hijacking and terrorism (Faulkner, 2001) . Furthermore, studies have shown that tourists substitute risky destinations with safer choices, demonstrate a delayed reaction to terrorism and exhibit cultural differences in their reactions to risk (Sonmez, 1998, pp. 427-428) . For example, as a result of terrorist activity in 1985, 1.8 million Americans changed their foreign plans their following year (Sonmez & Graefe, 1998, p. 121) . When the HIH Insurance Company collapsed on 15 March 2001, it was Australia's second largest general insurer, with almost 40 per cent of the public liability market. In the following (June) quarter, the net premium for insurers increased by 7.5 per cent, indicating that HIH's rivals had taken advantage of its collapse to obtain premium price rises which had been limited by competition (White, 2002) . The terrorist attacks further compounded the impact on insurance premiums. Switzer (2002) records that premium forecasts made before September 11 indicated that the rises would be 25 per cent at the most, but after these attacks, the increases could be as high as 1000 per cent in some cases, as occurred in Thorpedale, Victoria. The public liability premium for the annual potato festival has risen 1000 per cent since 2000. In Tumbarumba, southern New South Wales, the 2002 Easter Tooma Gymkhana was cancelled after premium rises from $1600 to $10,000 (Hughes, 2002) .",

This period of learning has three phases, namely, defensiveness, openness and forgetfulness. When faced with a crisis, managers and employees involved may feel defensive and be moved to protect themselves. However, once the immediate threat or incident has passed, they may be open to understanding their organisation's vulnerabilities and assessing its performance in managing the crisis. It is in this phase of openness when most learning can take place. However, the extent to which organisational members are open to learning and the duration of this phase are largely dependent on the behaviour of the top management. After the crisis, operations must be restored as soon as possible. Hence, the sense of urgency which motivates a desire for change is lost and all the superficial learning is forgotten (Kovoor-Misra & Nathan, 2000) . They suggest that 'healthy forgetfulness involves moving on, but only after the necessary lessons have been learned.' (Kovoor-Misra & Nathan, 2000, p. 32) .",

Roux-Dufort (2000, p. 26) suggests that 'the organization's priority is to come back and maintain the status quo as soon as possible rather than exploring the extent to which the crisis is a privileged moment during which to understand things differently.' Confirming this view, Henderson (1999, p. 177) reports that the results of a survey of leading tourist attractions in Singapore investigating the consequences of the Asian financial crisis indicated that there was no crisis management planning and that there was a need for such planning in the light of the nature of the travel and tourism industry, with its exposure to risk and disaster. This finding confirms the observation made by Cassedy (1991, p . 1) that many tourism organisations do not include the possibility of disasters in their strategic plans. Indeed, Cassedy observes that 'given the travel industry's dependence on transportation, the exchange rate, the political situation, discretionary income and weather, this industry is highly susceptible to unexpected change' (Cassedy, 1991, p. 3) . This absence of some form of crisis management planning perhaps reflects the fatal mistake made by many businesses that a crisis will not happen to them (Spillan & Hough, 2003) . They report the results of a survey of small businesses in Pennsylvania and New York, which indicated from the 162 responses, that little emphasis had been placed on crisis planning in these businesses, the majority of which had less than 25 employees. The study also concluded that 'concern for crises was generated from the past experience of those crisesy' (Spillan & Hough, 2003, p. 406) .",

A number of interviewees were satisfied with their responses and did not see the need to do anything differently should a similar situation happen again: I just think that that what happened actually probably reinforced the way we went around doing our business, that we basically had in place the necessary procedures to actually alter the business accordingly to what was happening at the time. (Michael, accommodation, A: 130) I don't think they should change anything, they did a good job. (Kate, car hire, AS: 7) no, I don't think so.

But no, I wouldn't change much. (Lachlan, transportation, A: 300) One interviewee (Trevor, business tourism, M: 500) acknowledged that people in his organisation had been caught up in the emotion of the time, and that the next time such an event occurred, they would wait for reliable information before planning their response. Indeed, confirming Heath (1998) , there was broad acknowledgement that any responses should be based on accurate information: first one was, to rapidly y increase our intelligencegathering information, so to ensure that the decisions we were making were based on fact, not on reaction. (Ray, entertainment, GC) well the very first thing we had to do was to try to establish what effect it was going to have on those traditional feeder markets because it caught us totally unawares. (Nigel, accommodation, C) In discussing the perceived benefits of the events of 2001 to the tourism industry, a number of interviewees again highlighted the value of organisational learning as a result of these events: I think the operators get a chance to sit down and really look at what their business is all about y it forces people to also explore other markets that they probably wouldn't have explored in the first place, had the business been just bopping along. It also gives operators an opportunity to review their cost structures and rationalize if they need to and understand that their, their existing clientele is of utmost importance and their staff morale and staff, ability to be able to hold staff during those periods is also important in producing a product that continues to be outstanding. (Michael, accommodation, A: 130) One interviewee suggested that there were benefits at the industry and organisational levels: the benefits are, I reckon, for the industry would be just working out smarter ways of doing business, being more efficientythings like this made people sit up and pay attention and be a bit more strategic in their approach, marrying up short-term gain with long-term objectives. From our point of view, it's caused us to look fairly closely at the business in that respect. y it sharpens us up in our business management approach, it sharpens us up in our service delivery, because we're now competing for a tighter market. (Brad, tour operator, S) side-benefits should always be that we increase our level of understanding and the knowledge and intelligence y that is, despite a negative event, what do we learn from it? y so as to avoid it in the future, to be able to manage it more effectively in the future, but more importantly, to increase organisational capabilities to responding to events in the future, so everything is a learning experience, at a strategic and an organisational culture level. (Ray, entertainment, GC) Hence, while a number of interviewees learnt that their responses to these events had been adequate and hence would not change their response to future such events, other interviewees did learn a variety of lessons resulting in a number of organisational changes. Indeed, the value of the organisational learning which occurs at such times was acknowledged by some interviewees as a benefit of these events.",

The need to support personnel in such times by the provision of reliable information, reported by Heath (1998) , and the importance of workforce flexibility in areas such as work-time, mentioned by Buultjens and Howard (2001) , have also been confirmed.

Most importantly, it must be recognised that organisations are now operating in an increasingly volatile environment and it is imperative that good networks are developed and maintained so that accurate information can be gained on which appropriate responses to any crisis can be planned. It is vital that organisations become flexible in their approach to their operations, one aspect of such flexibility being with respect to staffing. In this study, work-time flexibility has been shown to be particularly important means whereby staff could be retained, as there was a widespread reluctance to retrench staff, who would be needed once the industry had recovered. It is also critical that lessons learnt during such times are not lost, but become part of the 'corporate memory', such that they can guide future decision-making.",
