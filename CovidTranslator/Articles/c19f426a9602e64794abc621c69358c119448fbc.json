Although great efforts have been made to find effective medication, there are still no drugs that truly cure viral infections. There are currently approximately 90 drugs approved for the treatment of human viral infections. As resistance toward available antiviral drugs has become a global threat to health, there is an intrinsic need to identify new scaffolds that are useful in discovering innovative, less toxic and highly active antiviral agents. 1,3,4-Thiadiazole derivatives have been extensively studied due to their pharmacological profile, physicochemical and pharmacokinetic properties. This review provides an overview of the various synthetic compounds containing the 2-amino-1,3,4-thiadiazole moiety that has been evaluated for antiviral activity against several viral strains and could be considered possible prototypes for the development of new antiviral drugs.",

In addition, nitrogen-containing heterocycles are important targets for medicinal chemistry, as they are found in more than half of the commercially available drugs and can also act as versatile intermediates in the synthesis of complex products that exhibit outstanding biological activities [15] . Most of the nitrogen-containing heterocyclic compounds exhibit better biological activity than non-nitrogen compounds [12, 16, 17] . Currently, there are approximately 90 drugs approved for use in the treatment of nine human viral infections caused by human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis B virus (HBV), hepatitis C virus (HCV), herpes simplex virus (HSV), Influenza virus, human cytomegalovirus (HCMV), varicella-zoster virus (VZV), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and human papillomavirus [18] .

            "text": "Five-membered aromatic systems with three heteroatoms at symmetrical positions, such as the 1,3,4-thiadiazole ring, have been extensively studied due to their pharmacological profile and physicochemical and pharmacokinetic properties. 1,3,4-Thiadiazole derivatives are known as compounds having significant and diverse biological activities such as antibacterial, antifungal, antitubercular [20], analgesic and anti-inflammatory [21, 22] , antidepressant and anxiolytic [23], kinesin inhibitors [24], etc. The 1,3,4-thiadiazole ring is also found in several medicines such as acetazolamide, methazolamide, cefazolin, cefazedone, sulfamethizole or megazol [20, [25] [26] [27] . The 1,3,4-thiadiazole nucleus provides the compounds with high lipophilicity and the ability to form mesoionic systems associated with discrete regions of positive and negative charges. These distinct features allow mesoionic compounds to efficiently cross cellular membranes, leading to good oral absorption, bioavailability and strong unique interactions with biological molecules (e.g., DNA, proteins, etc.) thus increasing the potential of 1,3,4-thiadiazole derivatives to exhibit biological activities [20, [27] [28] [29] . The thiadiazole ring is a bioisostere of the pyrimidine and pyridazine rings. The pyrimidine nucleus is commonly found in naturally occurring compounds of biochemical importance, as well as in drugs (e.g., pyrimidine nucleosides and nucleotides, nucleic acids, antiviral drugs), while the pyridazine nucleus is a component of some pharmacologically active compounds [20, [30] [31] [32] . The thiadiazole ring also acts as a bioisostere of the thiazole ring, and therefore thiadiazole derivatives can act in the same way as third-and fourth-generation antibacterial cephalosporins. This is an additional feature that highlights the high potential of this ring system in medicinal chemistry [20, 28] . Many researchers suppose there is a connection between the biological potential of 1,3,4-thiadiazoles and the strongly aromatic character of the 1,3,4-thiadiazole ring, as well as the presence of the toxophoric =N-C-Slinkage group. Furthermore, the high in vivo stability and low toxicity for higher organisms are also attributed to the 1,3,4-thiadiazole ring [20, 33, 34] . In addition, the amine derivatives of 1,3,4-thiadiazole are also studied. 2-Amino-1,3,4-thiadiazole moiety and its derivatives are known for their antitumor, antitrypanosomal and uricogenic properties [20, 25, 27, [35] [36] [37] [38] . 2-Amino-1,3,4-thiadiazole derivatives are currently being synthesized in many laboratories, and in previous papers, we described several 2-amino-1,3,4-thiadiazoles that exhibit antibacterial, antifungal, antitubercular [20, [39] [40] [41] [42] [43] [44] , and antiparasitic activities [27, 38] . The purpose of this paper is to present some small molecules possessing the 2-amino-1,3,4-thiadiazole moiety that have shown antiviral activity.",

            "text": "For many viral infections, only symptomatic treatment is indicated, while it is expected the immune system to fight off the virus. However, there are high-virulence viruses that cause serious viral infections where antiviral treatment is essential for patient survival. Although great efforts have been made to find effective medication, there are still no drugs that truly cure viral infections. Moreover, CH(OH)CH 3 (4) ; CH 2 CH 2 SCH 3 (5) In vitro HIV inhibitory activity using human T-lymphocyte (MT-4) cells gave moderate or low half-maximal effective concentration (EC50) values in comparison to efavirenz (EC50 value of 0.003 \u03bcg/mL). The best results were obtained for derivatives 1 and 5 ( Figure 1 ) with moderate EC50 values. Thus, compound 1 showed EC50 > 14 \u03bcg/mL against HIV-1 (strain IIIB) and EC50 > 12.4 \u03bcg/mL against HIV-2 (strain ROD), while the compound 5 showed EC50 > 12.6 \u03bcg/mL against HIV-1 and EC50 > 12.5 \u03bcg/mL against HIV-2. Low values for cytotoxicity concentration 50% (compound concentration that reduces the viability of mock-infected MT-4 cells by 50%), namely the CC50 value of 14.0 \u00b1 1.2 \u03bcg/mL for compound 1 and 13.3 \u00b1 0.8 \u03bcg/mL for compound 5, respectively, resulted in low selectivity index SI \u2264 1 (SI = CC50/EC50). Other derivatives showed lower activity with EC50 within the range of 47.4-125 \u03bcg/mL. However, chemical modifications on this scaffold might lead to compounds with enhanced activity as NNRTIs [65] . [66] from amino acid analogs were screened for anti-HIV-1 (strain IIIB) and anti-HIV-2 (strain ROD) activity by the inhibition of the virus-induced cytopathic effect in human MT-4 cells based on 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl) -2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay. 2-(Naphthalen-2-yloxy)-N-((5-(phenylamino) -1,3,4-thiadiazol-2-yl)methyl)acetamide 6 showed in vitro inhibitory activity with EC50 values of 0.96 \u03bcg/mL (HIV-1 strain IIIB) and 2.92 \u03bcg/mL (HIV-2 strain ROD), respectively, but low selectivity (SI < 1). Structure-activity relationship (SAR) studies have suggested that the substitution of the acetamide moiety with a thiadiazole ring may lead to more active derivatives compared to other compounds bearing different heterocyclic rings. Even though anti-HIV activity and selectivity of derivative 6 are limited compared to efavirenz (EC50 value of 0.003 \u03bcg/mL and SI \u2248 13333), it may serve as the basis for future modification in the search for new potent non-nucleoside antiviral agents [66] . A new class of HIV-1 NNRTIs, N-aryl-2-arylthioacetamides, has been identified in the last years [67] [68] [69] [70] . Studies on the crystalline structure of the RT-NNRTI complex suggested that NNRTIs have a common mode of action and interact with a hydrophobic pocket. N-aryl- 2-arylthioacetamides In vitro HIV inhibitory activity using human T-lymphocyte (MT-4) cells gave moderate or low half-maximal effective concentration (EC 50 ) values in comparison to efavirenz (EC 50 value of 0.003 \u00b5g/mL). The best results were obtained for derivatives 1 and 5 ( Figure 1 ) with moderate EC 50 values. Thus, compound 1 showed EC 50 > 14 \u00b5g/mL against HIV-1 (strain IIIB) and EC 50 > 12.4 \u00b5g/mL against HIV-2 (strain ROD), while the compound 5 showed EC 50 > 12.6 \u00b5g/mL against HIV-1 and EC 50 > 12.5 \u00b5g/mL against HIV-2. Low values for cytotoxicity concentration 50% (compound concentration that reduces the viability of mock-infected MT-4 cells by 50%), namely the CC 50 value of 14.0 \u00b1 1.2 \u00b5g/mL for compound 1 and 13.3 \u00b1 0.8 \u00b5g/mL for compound 5, respectively, resulted in low selectivity index SI \u2264 1 (SI = CC 50 /EC 50 ). Other derivatives showed lower activity with EC 50 within the range of 47.4-125 \u00b5g/mL.

The best results were obtained for derivatives 1 and 5 ( Figure 1 ) with moderate EC50 values. Thus, compound 1 showed EC50 > 14 \u03bcg/mL against HIV-1 (strain IIIB) and EC50 > 12.4 \u03bcg/mL against HIV-2 (strain ROD), while the compound 5 showed EC50 > 12.6 \u03bcg/mL against HIV-1 and EC50 > 12.5 \u03bcg/mL against HIV-2. Low values for cytotoxicity concentration 50% (compound concentration that reduces the viability of mock-infected MT-4 cells by 50%), namely the CC50 value of 14.0 \u00b1 1.2 \u03bcg/mL for compound 1 and 13.3 \u00b1 0.8 \u03bcg/mL for compound 5, respectively, resulted in low selectivity index SI \u2264 1 (SI = CC50/EC50). Other derivatives showed lower activity with EC50 within the range of 47.4-125 \u03bcg/mL. However, chemical modifications on this scaffold might lead to compounds with enhanced activity as NNRTIs [65] .

Structure-activity relationship (SAR) studies have suggested that the substitution of the acetamide moiety with a thiadiazole ring may lead to more active derivatives compared to other compounds bearing different heterocyclic rings. Even though anti-HIV activity and selectivity of derivative 6 are limited compared to efavirenz (EC50 value of 0.003 \u03bcg/mL and SI \u2248 13333), it may serve as the basis for future modification in the search for new potent non-nucleoside antiviral agents [66] .

It has been observed that the 2-amino-1,3,4-thiadiazole moiety may be a good group for anti-HIV-1 activity by providing promising antiviral agents. Moreover, the electronic properties of the N-aryl group influenced antiviral potency. The introduction of electron-withdrawing groups, such as fluorine or trifluoromethyl on phenyl ring (derivatives 8 and 9), enhanced antiviral activity compared to the unsubstituted phenyl derivative 7. SAR studies suggested that the steric/electronic properties of the N-phenyl substituents influenced the antiretroviral activity more than their positions. In addition, the nature of the N-aryl ring influenced the antiviral potency as can be observed for derivative 10 with a pyrimidyl ring which was the most active compound ( Figure 2 ) [47] . (7) substitution with F atoms (8, 9) Molecular modeling studies for the pyrimidyl derivative 10 showed the formation of two potential intermolecular hydrogen bonds involving a nitrogen atom and the amino group of the thiadiazole ring and aminoacids from NNBS of RT. In addition, the electron-deficient pyrimidine ring of the ligand establishes \u03c0-\u03c0 interactions with the electron-rich benzene rings of RT. Despite the docking simulation results, the inhibitory activity of compound 10 against HIV-1 (strain IIIB) replication in MT-4 cell culture was lower than that of zidovudine. However, given the butterfly-like orientation as a necessary structural condition for antiretroviral activity, these results reveal the promising inhibitory potential of this scaffold [47] .",

HAND affects 7%-15% of AIDS patients and is characterized by neuronal dysfunction including synaptic damage, neuronal degeneration and cell dropout [72] . Cells involved in HAND pathogenesis are macrophages and microglia, which are the main targets of HIV-1 infection in the brain. When infected with HIV-1, macrophages and microglia increase the production and release of several soluble neurotoxic factors, such as glutamate, inducing neuronal damage [71] .",

HCMV infection can be acquired through horizontal and vertical transmission. HCMV spreads from infected people through direct contact with body fluids that carry the virus, such as urine, saliva, cervicovaginal secretions, sperm and breast milk. Vertical transmission through organ transplantation, from mother to child or transmission via blood transfusion, is also possible [79, 80] . Blood tests indicate that 60%-90% of the adult population experienced HCMV infection at some time during their life [81] . Although most of these infections are asymptomatic, certain patient groups such as babies that are infected before birth and children or adults with weakened immune systems due to diseases or medications (e.g., HIV-infected patients, organ transplant recipients) can develop severe illnesses that require medical treatment [79] . HCMV is able to remain latent in several cells of the human body for a long time and can be reactivated if the person develops immune system suppression [79, 82] .",

Acute respiratory infections are most often caused by viruses. Over 200 viral serotypes are associated with human respiratory diseases [90] including Influenza A and Influenza B virus, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), parainfluenza virus (PIV), human adenovirus (HAdV), human coronavirus (HCoV), human rhinovirus (HRV), human metapneumovirus (HMPV) and human bocavirus (HBoV). In addition, two human polyomaviruses (HPyV), KIPyV and WUPyV, have been detected in patients with respiratory infections [91] . These infections affect all age groups, but nearly all severe episodes occur in children under five years, the elderly and immunocompromised individuals (e.g., HIV-infected patients) [87, 89] . In adults, viral respiratory infections are the cause of 30%-50% of pneumonia cases, 80% of asthma complications and 20%-60% of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbations [87] . Consequently, common viral respiratory infections cause a greater economic burden than many other clinical conditions in terms of medical expenses and productivity losses [87, 92] .

The 1918 flu pandemic was caused by Influenza A subtype H1N1 and killed 50 million people around the world [93] . The Asian Influenza caused by Influenza A subtype H2N2 occurred in 1957 and the Hong Kong Influenza caused by Influenza A subtype H3N2 took place in 1968 and made far fewer victims than the 1918 Spanish flu. About 70 people died in Asia in 2004-2005 due to the H5N1 strain of avian flu [93] . The 2009 flu pandemic (swine flu) was the second pandemic involving a strain of Influenza A virus. It was classified as Influenza A H1N1 2009 and the genetic material originated from three different species: human, avian and swine [7, 94] . The chemotherapy or prophylaxis of Influenza infections comprises agents blocking the Influenza A virus M2 proton-selective ion channel (amantadine, rimantadine) and neuraminidase inhibitors (zanamivir, oseltamivir, laninamivir, peramivir) [1, 93] . Both classes can While the synthesized derivatives have shown inhibitory activity against HCMV polymerase, their antiviral activity cannot be limited to a specific mechanism of action. These compounds may be active against cytomegalovirus by HCMV polymerase inhibition or by other mechanisms of action. In addition, during the experiments, many of these compounds also showed activity against other herpes viruses, such as varicella-zoster virus (VZV), Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), herpes simplex virus (HSV), and human herpesvirus type 8 (HHV-8). Pharmaceutical compositions containing such compounds or their pharmaceutically acceptable salts useful as antiviral agents have also been studied. Studies have been conducted for the administration of pharmaceutical preparations by parenteral, topical, oral or rectal route, depending on the purpose of their use to treat internal or external viral infections [86] .",

These infections are of the top five causes of mortality worldwide and the leading cause of mortality among children under five years of age in many developing countries [87, 89] . Acute respiratory infections are most often caused by viruses. Over 200 viral serotypes are associated with human respiratory diseases [90] including Influenza A and Influenza B virus, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), parainfluenza virus (PIV), human adenovirus (HAdV), human coronavirus (HCoV), human rhinovirus (HRV), human metapneumovirus (HMPV) and human bocavirus (HBoV). In addition, two human polyomaviruses (HPyV), KIPyV and WUPyV, have been detected in patients with respiratory infections [91] . These infections affect all age groups, but nearly all severe episodes occur in children under five years, the elderly and immunocompromised individuals (e.g., HIV-infected patients) [87, 89] . In adults, viral respiratory infections are the cause of 30%-50% of pneumonia cases, 80% of asthma complications and 20%-60% of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbations [87] . Consequently, common viral respiratory infections cause a greater economic burden than many other clinical conditions in terms of medical expenses and productivity losses [87, 92] . The World Health Organization has supported the monitoring of acute respiratory diseases worldwide since 1977 [91] .",

Patients may have an acute form as a recent infection, with relatively rapid onset or a chronic form. There are five main hepatitis viruses (HAV, HBV, HCV, HDV and HEV) with different ways of transmission and different impact on human health [97] . While HAV or HEV infection is usually mild, with most people recovering quickly and completely, infection with HBV, HCV or HDV often leads to chronic infections and progressive liver damage with the development of cirrhosis and liver cancer [97] . There are about 15 million people living with chronic HBV infection and about 14 million with HCV infection in the European Region [97] . Safe and effective vaccines for the prevention of HBV infection have been available since the 1990s. These vaccines also provide protection from HDV infection. Unfortunately, the HCV vaccine has not yet been developed [97, 98] . Many patients infected with HBV are adults born before the hepatitis B vaccine became available in the 1990s. In these cases, drug treatment is the only option [98] . Several nucleoside and non-nucleoside derivatives with anti-HBV (e.g., adefovir, entecavir, lamivudine, telbivudine, tenofovir) or anti-HCV activity (e.g., boceprevir, grazoprevir, elbasvir, ledipasvir, sofosbuvir, telaprevir) are in use [3, 99] and chronic infections with HBV and HCV can be currently controlled or even cured. Due to the costs of antiviral drugs for chronic hepatitis, access to treatment is a major obstacle in many countries and finding new, less expensive antiviral drugs is a necessity [97] .",
