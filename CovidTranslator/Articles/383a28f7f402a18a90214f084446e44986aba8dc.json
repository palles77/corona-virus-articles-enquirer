Intestines and intestinal contents of infected embryos were harvested and homogenized. After low speed centrifugation, the supernatant was concentrated by ultracentrifugation through a cushion of 30 or 60% sucrose solution, or by ammonium sulfate precipitation. The purification methods included sucrose gradient and Sephacryl S-1000 size-exclusion chromatography. Ultracentrifugation through a cushion of 60% sucrose solution was better than the other two methods for concentration of TCoV from intestinal homogenate. The most effective method for purifying TCoV and removing extraneous materials was size-exclusion chromatography as analyzed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. More spike-rich particles were observed in the sample purified by chromatography than those purified by sucrose gradient as examined by electron microscopy. Differentiation of turkey anti-TCoV antiserum from normal turkey serum was better achieved by ELISA plates coated with TCoV preparation purified by size-exclusion chromatography than that purified by sucrose density gradient. The results indicated that Sephacryl S-1000 chromatography was useful for purification of TCoV.",

By size-exclusion chromatography, coronaviral particles were observed only in the first small peak fractions but not in the late large peak fractions, indicating that a lot of extraneous materials in the intestinal contents were separated from the TCoV particles. This was confirmed further by the results of SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting that the second peak fractions contained many protein bands that shared similar pattern with the original supernatant of intestinal homogenate. In addition, most of these proteins were not detectable in the immunoblotting analysis. Comparatively, most of the protein bands of the first peak were recognized by turkey anti-TCoV antiserum in the immunoblotting analysis.",
