In the fall of 2014, concerns over initial reports of severe respiratory illness in EV-D68 cases in Canada, combined with a lack of clinical and epidemiological information on EV-D68 in general, prompted the Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC), in collaboration with select federal and PT partners, to launch a rapid response surveillance pilot to collect data for national reporting within weeks of the outbreak. All 13 PTs were invited to participate in the time-limited rapid surveillance pilot and seven agreed: British Columbia, Alberta, Ontario, New Brunswick, Yukon, Northwest Territories and Nunavut. With this, all five regions in Canada (i.e. Atlantic, Central, Prairies, Western and the Territories) and three of the four most populous provinces were represented. In addition, PHAC's Centre for Immunization and Respiratory Infectious Diseases (CIRID), the NML, the Canadian Field Epidemiology Program and Health Canada's First Nations and Inuit Health Branch were also involved in the pilot.",

The survey findings highlighted the following important success factors: pre-established processes and reporting mechanisms; and adequate resource capacity (particularly human resource surge capacity for additional surveillance demands). Because barriers to surveillance and reporting of pertinent case details caused delays and/or prevented jurisdictions from participating, it is recommended that barriers be identified and addressed prior to the emergence/re-emergence of respiratory pathogens to ensure timeliness in initiating such systems.",

At the federal level, it is important to understand the factors that allow PTs to participate in a national surveillance initiative and what factors sustain national reporting. For example, PHAC could provide forms and reporting mechanisms that minimize undue effort and demands on already-strained PT resources.",

First, close to half of the PTs did not participate in the surveillance pilot or complete an evaluation survey and therefore, only minimal information could be obtained on the usefulness of conducting surveillance on emerging pathogens such as EV-D68 from those jurisdictions. Most of the responses/results came from jurisdictions that participated in the pilot and depending on whether some questions were applicable to a jurisdiction or not, the denominators for percentage calculations were even smaller (i.e. fewer than five). Although non-participating jurisdictions were asked to provide their reasons for not participating, overall, feedback from nonparticipating jurisdictions was lacking. Secondly, the evaluation was conducted five months after completion of the pilot to coincide with a downturn in respiratory virus activity in the country, so as not to burden jurisdictions with the additional task of completing the survey during the active respiratory surveillance period. More complete and informative feedback may have been obtained if the survey was conducted within weeks rather than months following the completion of the pilot. The fall 2014 EV-D68 outbreak took place over a brief time period and resulted in a small number of deaths and cases with neurological manifestations. Nevertheless, the EV-D68 surveillance pilot provided PHAC and participating jurisdictions with an opportunity to test resource capacities and processes for emerging respiratory pathogens surveillance and to become better prepared to undertake future rapid surveillance initiatives.",
