The low pH environment of the endosome facilitates passage of the viral genome into the cytoplasm. For some viruses the mechanism of membrane penetration is now known to be linked to a pH-mediated conformational change in external virion proteins. As a consequence of infection there are alterations in the permeab~dity of the plasma membrane which may contribute to cellular damage.

Even so, very little is known in precise terms about the molecular details of interactions between animal viruses and the host cell receptors. However, with the advent of rapid sequencing of virus glycoproteins involved in these interactions, our knowledge of these processes should now quickly expand. It seems a very opportune moment, therefore, to reappraise the biological data up to the present time. This review will concentrate on a few well studied viruses. It is hoped that this will illustrate some of the general mechanisms involved whilst at the same time emphasising that specific details may not apply universally even to genetically closely related viruses.

The cell surface receptor may be restricted to a single species of plasma membrane receptor, as is probably the case for adenovirus 6\"7 and Epstein-Barr virus 8\"9. On the other hand, the recognition structure may have a more ubiquitous distribution. Sialic acids, for example, are essential components of the cell surface receptors for influenza, paramyxo, polyoma and encephalomyocarditis viruses and since a heterogeneous array of glycoproteins and glycolipids contain these residues, the number of potential receptor molecules is large.",

A well characterized virus receptor is glycophorin, a sialoglycoprotein binding site for influenza virus on erythrocytes 1\u00b0. The receptor for adenovirus type 2 on HeLa cells has been identified as a 42 kdalton glycoprotein 7. Less well defined is the receptor for Semliki Forest virus (SFV); histocompatibility antigens have been reported to be associated with the SFV binding site 11. However, since the virus will attach to and grow in MHC negative cell lines ~2, these glycoproteins may be involved in non-infectious adsorption. In this latter context, it is interesting to note that foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) does not appear to require specific receptor sites for binding to BHK cells 13, although interactions with specific cell membrane molecules may still be required for subsequent internalization and uncoating.",

Sialic-acidcontaining glycolipids (gangliosides) occur naturally in the plasma membrane of cells and act as receptors for cholera toxin, interferon and some glycoprotein hor-mones as well as for certain viruses. Of course, both gangliosides and glycoproteins may be involved in adsorption, since a virion approaching a cell would interact with glycoprotein first before making intimate contact with the plasma membrane containing gangliosides. Thus arboviruses may interact specifically with phosphatidylinositol and polyphosphoinositides ~4 and SFV infectivity is inhibited by treatment of host cell with phospholipase C iS. An interesting approach to investigating the biochemical nature of these binding sites is to solubilize membrane constituents from cells and to determine which components bind to the virus and hence inhibit its binding to cells. Schlegel et al. u, have carried out detailed studies with vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) and their work may be used to illustrate the general principles. Phosphatidylserine (PS) inhibited VSV plaque formation by 8(t-90%, whereas herpes virus plaque formation was unaffected. Moreover, PS-containing liposomes bind to VSV, suggesting that PS functions as a binding site for this virus. VSV presumably interacts with the hydrophilic polar head region of PS since it is that domain which faces the external environment. The specific binding of VSV to PS is likely to be mediated by the virus G protein and since the amino acid sequence is now known 17, it should be possible to define the precise region of the protein responsible for binding. The G protein-PS binding almost certainly involves more than simple ionic interactions, because otherwise anionic phospholipids would inhibit VSV binding and they do not I~. Finally, it is possible that PS has a role in promoting internal membrane fusion events between the virus G protein and the membrane of acidified endosomes.",

            "text": "In our introductory remarks it was pointed out that although some general observations may be made pertaining to early virus cell interactions, the specific details for different viruses, even for genetically related viruses, may not be the same. This is illustrated by the work of Carroll et al. lS who describe the different adsorption properties of the influenza A RI/5 and RI/ 5 + viruses with erythrocytes and attribute this to the different sialyloligosaccharide receptor specificities of their HAs. Erythrocytes were treated with Vibrio cholera neuraminidase to remove sialic acids and then modified with CMP-NeuAc and three purified sialyltransferases to contain either the NeuAc~t2,3Gal, NeuAcct2,6Gal or NeuAca2,6GalNAc linkages on cell surface glycoproteins. The HAs of the two viruses RI/5and RI/5 + had totally different specificities, binding respectively to NeuAcct2,3Gai and NeuAcct2,6Gal linkages. Similarly derivatized erythrocytes were used to study the receptor specificities of human influenza A (H3N2) isolates selected in the presence of either horse serum or guinea-pig serum (both of which are rich in glycoproteins containing NeuAcc~2,6Gal linkages). The receptor binding specificities of these variants were changed from NeuAcct2,6Gal specific in the parent virus to either NeuAcct2,3Gal specific or both linkage types were recognised ~9. The HA genes of these viruses were sequenced and the altered receptor binding specificities were shown to be due to amino acid substitutions at position 226 of HA1 v~, which lies at the base of the proposed receptor-binding pocket 2\u00b0. This pocket has on its periphery three of the major antigenic sites on HA (A, B and D, see Figure 1 ) 21 and antigenic analyses of the HAs with different receptor binding specificities show that most anti-haemagglutinin monoclonal antibodies raised against the NeuAc~2,6Gal-specific virus react equally well with both variants, but a small number fail to react with the NeuAcct2,3Gal-specific virus 22. These studies demonstrate that host-specified sialyloligosaccharides can exert selective pressure on influenza viruses, and in agreement with this it is known that influenza A (H3N2) viruses isolated from equine and avian sources are naturally NeuAcct2,6Gal-specific 23. This selective procedure has been demonstrated and shown to vary for influenza A (H3N2) variants of avian and human origin 2~. Whereas human isolates of either NeuAcct2,6Gal-or NeuAcct2,3Gal-specificity were stable when grown either in MDCK-culture or eggs, an avian NeuAcct2,6Gai-specific variant was stable in MDCK-culture but reverted spontaneously on passage in eggs. This reversion was again shown to involve amino acid substitution at position 226 of HA124. Concurrently we have described the selection of subpopulations of influenza A and B viruses by cultivation of virus in MDCK cells or in embryonated hens eggs 25\"2~. The latter host system clones out a population of virions with a different antigenic composition, as detected with both monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies, compared to the same parental virus cultivated in MDCK cells. The novel implication is that a non-immune selective mechanism involving host cell receptor sites may operate to select and generate antigenic variants of influenza virus, thus contributing towards antigenic drift and evolution of the virus. Since eggs are routinely employed for the preparation of influenza vaccines, these findings have important practical implications for vaccine design and efficacy. Table  1 shows haemagglutination-inhibition (HI) reactions of four influenza B viruses representative of 27 strains isolated and passaged in eggs or MDCK cells from specimens collected during a school outbreak of influenza in 198227 . The virus preparations were tested against anti-HA monoclonal antibodies prepared against influenza B virus cultivated in eggs or MDCK cells as shown in Table 1 . Three patterns of serological reactivity were discernible. Monoclonal antibody 195 reacted to high titres with all the influenza B viruses tested. Monoclonal antibody 209 reacted with all the viruses which had been isolated and subsequently passaged in MDCK cultures and with none of the viruses which had been cultivated in eggs at any stage in their passage histories. Antibody 238 reacted only with viruses which had at least one passage in eggs and with none of the viruses which had been passaged in MCDK cultures only. The mutually exclusive nature of the reactions of antibodies 209 and 238 with the 27 virus preparations tested was striking.",

However, this is not an explanation for the findings. None of the monoclonal antibodies gave HI reactions which were entirely determined by the last culture system in which the test virus was grown. Moreover, the reactions were influenza B specific and were not affected by absorbing the antibodies with homogenates of chorioallantoic membrane or MDCK cells. In experiments to investigate any biological differences between the antigenically distinct subpopulations, the range of erythrocytes agglutinated by the viruses was compared. Erythrocytes may be used as a model for cell-receptor specificity for influenza virus. Table 1 were tested with erythrocytes of chicken, turkey, man (group A, AB and O cells), rhesus monkey, guinea-pig, sheep, rat and horse. The viruses, irrespective of passage history, agglutinated the cells of these species to similar titres with the exception of sheep, horse and rat erythrocytes.

            "text": "The findings provide strong evidence that influenza B virus isolated from clinical specimens and grown in MDCK cultures comprises at least two biologically and antigenically distinct subpopulations. A minor proportion of the MDCK-grown virus is capable of growth in the allantois of fertile eggs without prior adaptation and possesses HA which is antigenically distinct from the majority of the virus which grows poorly or not at all in the allantoic cavity. The molecular basis of this MDCK/ egg selection has been investigated by HA gene sequencing and shown to be due to modification of a glycosylation site in an area corresponding to antigenic site B of the H3 structure 2s. The glycosylation site is present in all viruses isolated in MDCK-cultures, but is lost or modified in viruses adapted to growth in eggs. More recently the antigenic heterogeneity of influenza isolates has been directly demonstrated by electron microscopy of isolates labelled with monoclonal antibodies and immunogold reagents 29. These studies are not unique in providing evidence of distinct subpopulations of virus within a single strain. Other reports have documented biological or antigenic heterogeneity among populations of influenza A virus cultivated in eggs. However, for the first time evidence has been accumulated of strong selective pressure for antigenic variants exerted by the cultivation of viruses in eggs. A probable explanation for covariance between growth in eggs and antigenic character of influenza B virus is that one of the antigenic sites of the HA molecule is structurally and functionally related to the binding site for cell surface receptors. Analysis of influenza A haemagglutinin indicates that the epitopes with which monoclonal antibodies react are clustered into four independent antigenic sites in the three dimensional structure of the molecule (Figure 1 ) and, of these, site B appears to be topographically closest to the probable binding site for cell surface receptors.",

It is temperature an energy dependent and blocked by drugs that inhibit the microfilament system. To induce capping, ligands must cross-link receptors and form a two dimensional matrix on the cell surface. Thus monovalent Fab anti-receptor antibody cannot mediate capping.

Philipson et al. 42 have suggested that adenovirus particles need to contact and bind further receptors after the initial attachment event for internalization to proceed. Additional fibre-receptor contacts were considered to be brought about by lateral diffusion of receptor molecules in the fluid membrane bilayer 43, The importance of both the multivalency of the virus and the lateral mobility of its membrane receptors has also been emphasized recently in analyses of the positive cooperativity of binding of adenovirus 2 to HeLa cells 44. Further support for these ideas is provided by experiments in which the uptake of bound adenovirus was found to be impaired by blocking unoccupied receptors with free adenovirus fibre protein 33. At 37\u00b0C in the presence of metabolic inhibitors or cytochalasin B, membrane receptors would be free to diffuse, however, under these conditions uptake of adenovirus by HeLa ceils is inhibited 33. These results may be interpreted in two ways. Since these inhibitors also block surface redistribution, it may be argued that contact with further receptors is achieved by active cellmediated movement of virions rather than by passive diffusion of receptors. Alternatively, metabolicinhibitors and cytochalasin B may block the pinocytic internalization event. However, these agents do not prevent the entry of influenza virus into cytoplasmic vacuoles 45, but it must be remembered that adenovirus particles have only 12 fibre attachment structures per virion whilst influenza has an estimated 500-700 HA spikes per virion 46 and thus the pinocytic uptake mechanism for the two viruses may not be identical.",

Receptors for other molecules, for example u2-macroglobulin, only localize in coated pits after ligand binding 6~. Ultrastructurally the sites are recognised by a thickening on the cytoplasmic side of the membrane (Figure 3) which is due to a 170 kdal-62 ton protein called clathrin . Endocytosis at these specialized plasma membrane sites results in the formation of a coated vesicle containing the ligand-receptor complexes. A naked endosome is soon formed by dissociation of the clathrin coat which is then recycled back to the plasma membrane. Willingham and his colleagues have proposed that the coated vesicle is not pinched off from the plasma membrane but remains connected via a long narrow neck 63. Receptor bound ligand then migrates to the vesicle-neck junction and buds out through uncoated membrane. They call the newly formed vesicle containing the ligand-receptor complex a receptosome.",

Cytochalasin B does not stop SFV from reaching coated pits 64 and metabolic inhibitors do not prevent the clustering of bound c~2macroglobulin receptors into these sites 6~. Thus, transport to coated pits seems to proceed via a dansylcadaverine-sensitive mechanism that is independent of the cytoskeletal system and insensitive to metabolic inhibitors.",

Two lines of evidence, derived originally from studies on influenza and SFV, suggest that fusion is involved in the uncoating process. The infectivity of influenza virus is dependent on the post-translational proteolytic cleavage of the haemagglutinin molecule into two components termed HA1 and HA2. These subunits are linked by disulphide bridges and anchored into the viral membrane by the carboxyterminal end of HA2. The finding that the NH2 terminus of HA2 is highly conserved throughout the different influenza serotypes and is almost identical to the NH 2 terminus of Sendal virus F~ fusion protein strongly suggests that it mediates a fusion event 65. More direct evidence for its role in a fusion event comes from recent studies involving site-specific mutagenesis of a cDNA encoding the HA of influenza 66. Three mutant sequences within the first eleven amino acids of HA2 were generated and incorporated into SV40 vectors for HA expression in Simian cells. Two of the mutants involved substitution of glutamic acid for glycine and resulted either in no fusion activity or in a raised threshold-pH and reduced efficiency of fusion, whilst an extension of the hydrophobic region by substitution of glycine for glutamic acid gave a mutant protein with fusion characteristics comparable to wild type protein.",

In parallel studies SFV was induced to fuse with the plasma membrane of BHK cells by adsorbing cells with virus at 4\u00b0C and then briefly exposing the preparations to warm (37\u00b0C) medium at pH 5.5. In addition low-pH-dependent fusion of virus with liposomes was demonstrated. From this data it was proposed that the low pH environment of the lysosome promotes fusion of the viral and lysosomal membranes resulting in the release of the viral nucleic acid into the cell cytoplasm. The antiviral action of lysosomotropic agents such as chloroquine, amantadine and NH4 ~, all of which raise lysosomal pH 67 and block virus infection at an early stage prior to transcription, appeared to support their hypothesis. This work was extended to other enveloped viruses including VSV 6s-7\u00b0 influenza TM and rabies 72 and a pathway similar to that followed by SFV proposed. Furthermore, for influenza virus there is evidence that low pH causes a conformational change in the haemagglutinin molecule and exposes the domains of the molecule that mediate fusion 73-7~'. Bachi et al. vv have prepared a monoclonal anti HA antibody that recognises internalized virus but not virus adsorbed to the cell surface. The binding of this antibody to internalized virus was inhibited by treating cells with ammonium chloride. These findings provide further support for the hypothesis that a conformational change in the HA which initiates fusion activity occurs in an acidic cellular compartment. In addition to influenza virus, there is recent evidence that the envelope glycoprotein of another virus, La Crosse virus, a member of the Bunyaviridae, undergoes a conformational change at the pH of fusion activation 7s.",

The pH of macrophage phagocytic vacuoles and endocytic vacuoles of fibroblasts 79's~ is reduced to pH<6 prior to fusion with lysosomes.

However, after washing treated cells, the concentration of amantadine remaining in the lysosomal compartment is still greater than 84 Vaccine, Vol. 4, June 1986 that required in the extracellular medium to produce maximum antiviral activity s~. Other inconsistencies are that chloroquine inhibits Sindbis virus infection of subconfluent BHK cells but not of confluent BHK cells or Aedes albopictus cells TM.

Influenza A viruses, at least, mutate readily to overcome the effects of high levels of amantadine, and the mutants possess elevated pH-dependence of the HA conformational change required for fusion.

In contrast, examination of adenovirusinfected KB cells by the freeze-fracture technique, which permits the observation of large expanses of membrane, has shown virions apparently lodged between the bilayers of the plasma membrane 97. Hennache et al. 9s found that destabilization of HeLa cell plasma membranes with citrate buffer enhanced the attachment of adenovirus without affecting cell viability or sensitivity to infection. Freeze-fracture of citratetreated cells that had been adsorbed with virus at 4\u00b0C revealed protrusions on the E fracture face of the plasma membrane that were devoid of intramembranous particles. Such areas were not observed on uninfected controls. Similar results were also obtained by treating cells with adenovirus fibre protein covalently attached to Sepharose beads. Intramembranous particle-free areas rapidly disappeared on warming. It is tempting to speculate that particle clearance facilitates penetration since clearance of intramembranous particles has also been observed in the opposing granule and plasma membranes of mast cells immediately prior to fusion and exocytosis 99.

At a later stage, gold and virus particles were found lying free in the cytoplasm, suggesting that the adenovirus particles had escaped from the vacuole by Early virus-cell interactions: S. Patterson and J. S. Oxford membrane dissolution. This view was supported by the finding that the effect of Pseudomonas toxin, which acts at a cytoplasmic site, was enhanced by incubation with adenovirus. Currently little is known about the adenovirus components that mediate membrane penetration or dissolution. However, clues to possible mechanisms are provided by the investigation of Svensson m2. It was shown that at neutral pH adenovirus bound to cells via the fibre protein, whilst at low pH attachment was mediated by the penton base. In addition lysosomotropic agents were found to cause a partial inhibition of particle release from endosomes.

The particles in the C fraction were considered to be the first intermediates of uncoating. Unlike native virus they were sensitive to DNAase and this was considered to be due to loss of some of the penton base and fibre units from the vertices of the virus\u2022 Analysis of early uncoating intermediates have demonstrated particles with reduced amounts of penton base and fibre protein m4\"mS. These findings have also been correlated with the less angular morphologi- More recently it was shown that sensitivity to DNAase at the plasma membrane level is blocked by EDTA, EGTA, dithiothreitol and dansylcadaverine and led to the proposal that destabilization of attached virions follows reorganization in the plasma membrane m\u00b0. Cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions obtained by Lonberg-Holm and Philipsons' experiments m3 yielded D particles which were more sensitive to DNAase than C particles and considered to represent viral cores, The E subcomponent was the last to appear, it had a predominantly nuclear location and probably represents free viral DNA. After penetration into the cytoplasm, the adenovirus C particle is transported to the nucleus. Microtubules seem to be involved in this process since colchicine, a microtubule depolymerizing agent, delays or decreases virus production and in studies in vitro adenovirus was showed that a ts mutant irus associated with microtubules at the permissive, but not at the non-permissive temperature. The final destination of the C particle is the nuclear pore (Figure 3) where extrusion of the viral nucleoprotein core (D particle) into the nucleus occurs 5-. Histochemical studies have revealed increased ATPase activity in the nuclear membrane associated with nuclear pores rag. Since the ATPase inhibitor p-hydroxymercuribenzoate prevented association of virus with the nuclear pore, it was proposed that extrusion of the nucleoprotein into the nucleus is an ener~y-dependent process. virus at the non-permissive temperature produce a normal yield of particles, which have a full complement of viral proteins. However, three of the core proteins, VI, VII and VIII, are present in their uncleaved precursor form. Although containing infectious DNA, these particles are non-infectious. Examination of cells infected with non-infectious Ad2 tsl progeny virus indicate that there is a block at a late stage in uncoating resulting in the accumulation of a 150 S subviral intermediate which is composed of DNA and peptides V, pVII and trace amounts of VII ~lt'~12. Although not detected in cells infected with wild-type virus, the 150 S component was considered to be a short-lived intermediate of normal uncoating. Peptides VI and VII are basic, bind to DNA and are thought to be involved in packaging of viral DNA ll3. Complete dissociation of core proteins from DNA during uncoating thus seems to require proper post-translational processing. Previous investigations suggested that release of the viral core occurs within close proximity of the nuclear pore s2. However, Mirza and Weber ~ ~j found that much of the 150 S component was not closely associated with the nucleus and therefore proposed that release of the core can also occur at a non-nuclear associated site. The conversion of native virus into the modified 'A' particles which lack Vp4 is accompanied by a marked alteration in antigenic properties t~\u00b0't21 and is thought to reflect conformational changes in the virion proteins. These changes result in the exposure of hydrophobic groups, since 'A' particles will bind to liposomes ~22. Lonberg-Holm and Whiteley 122 have proposed that the 'A' particle can intercalate with the plasma membrane and represents the penultimate stage in uncoating. However, the observation that 'A' particles only become susceptible to nucleases after treatment with chymotrypsin suggests that additional steps are required. Protease treatment also causes loss of Vp2 and converts the 135 S 'A' particle into a 70-80 S 'C' particle j23. Thus the 'A' particles seem to require processing by a cell-derived protease in order to release their RNA. The detection of 70-80 S particles lacking Vp4 and Vp2 in infected cells supports these ideas.",

Immediate practical aspects include a possible differential entry of antiviral compounds in virus infected cells compared to normal cells, lshida and Homma 133 demonstrated that u.v.-inactivated Sendai virus interacted with cells to produce leakage of certain phosphorylated metabolites such as phosphatidylcholine, even though the cells were not lysed and SlCrlabelled intracellular components did not leak out. Pasternak and Micklem J34 have hypothesised that this leakage results from incorporation of the inherent leaky viral envelope !n the cell plasma membrane. The fusion event introduces non-specific hydrophilic channels into the cell membrane and results in leakage of low molecular weight compounds such as nucleotides, sugar phosphates and Na + and K + ions into and out of cells. Extracellular Ca 2+ and some other divalent cations reversibly prevent leakage and thus virally induced channels operationally resemble intercellular communicating junctions ('gap junctions') between cells 135. These effects are noted particularly with certain para-myxoviruses, although 'early harvest' virus which is unable to cause fusion and haemolysis is also unable to induce leakiness in cell membranes. No cell specificity is noted, which is not surprising since paramyxovirus receptors occur on a wide variety of cell types and similar changes are also noted in organ cultures ~36. Carrasco and Esteban ~3~ have described early (1 h postinfection) permeability changes in cell membranes induced by vaccinia virus. For example, the modified membrane permits the entry of the translation inhibitor hygromycin B, and the protein toxin ct-sarcin. Adenovirus infection also promotes the entry of high molecular weight toxin into the cell ~3s. It should be added that changes in permeat)mty to ions also occur during later stages of actual virus replication in cells and this phenomenon is not restricted to paramyxoviruses but also includes viruses not possessing a lipid envelope. At late times after virus infection, translation inhibitors which do not normally penetrate uninfected cells 139 can pass into cells.",

An increased entry of Ca 2+ is likely to have adverse consequences on general cellular metabolism, whilst a loss of intracellular nucleotides especially ATP and cyclic nucleotides is likely to be even more damaging. All cells have a tendency to swell because of osmosis but water entry is normally prevented by an active extrusion of Na + from cells through operation of the Na ~ pump. If the pump malfunctions through lack of ATP, for example, or if the surface plasma membrane is made so leaky that entry of Na + exceeds the capacity of the Na + pump to remove it, a net entry of Na + accompanied by water occurs with resultant cell swelling.

At 4\u00b0C parvovirus 31, coronavirus 32, and adenovirus ~3 attach randomly over the surface of cultured cells. Diagram summarizing the known three-dimensional structure of influenza HA and NA spikes and their relationship with the lipid bilayer and matrix protein of the virus. The paths of the polypeptide chains of HA and NA monomers are shown. The HA1 polypeptide chain is shown as a thin line and HA2 as a thick line. The diagram indicates the extension of the C-terminus of HA2 through the lipid bilayer with a known hydrophobic portion spanning the membrane and a short hydrophilic region on the internal side of the membrane. Three long helices in the HA2 chains, one from each monomer, pack together as a triple stranded coiled-coil to form the stem of the trimer. The N-terminus of HA2 (fusion activation site) is deeply embedded in the spike. HA1 forms a globular outer region of each monomer and contains the important host-receptor binding sites and the antigenic sites A, B, C and D (C may be subdivided to give a fifth epitope). The polypeptide chain then loops back again with the N-terminus of HA1 adjacent to the viral membrane 2\u00b0'21. The polypeptide chain of the NA monomer is composed of six identical folding units arranged in a propellor formation when viewed from above, down the axis of the spike. The fourfold molecular symmetry of the tetramer is stabilized in part by metal ions bound on the symmetry axis. The catalytic sites are located on the upper corners of the box-shaped tetramer. Antigenic determinants (dense spots) form a nearly continuous surface across the top of the monomer and encircle the catalytic site. A hydrophobic region in the NA stalk spans the lipid bilayer and a short sequence may be present on the cytoplasmic side (for a review of HA and NA structure, see Ref.141).SFV, on the other hand, preferentially adsorbs to the microvilli of BHK cells 34.

Studies on poliovirus 11a, coxsackie virus 1Is, echovirus 11~' , and rhi-117 o novirus have shown that at 37 C a proportion of cell bound virions elute and are unable to reattach. Eluted virions lack Vp4 and are antigenically distinct from native virus.
