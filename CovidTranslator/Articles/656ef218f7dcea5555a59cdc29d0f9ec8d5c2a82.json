Similar to its predecessor severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) CoV, 4 MERS-CoV is characterized by severe lung infection and high mortality rates (2).

RNA 9 isolation and microarray processing, quality control, and normalization from Calu-3 cells was 10 carried out as previously described (34). Differential expression (DE) was determined by 11 comparing virus-infected replicates to time-matched mock replicates. Criteria for DE in 12 determining the consensus ISG list were an absolute Log 2 fold change of >1.5 and a false 13 discovery rate (FDR)-adjusted P value of <0.05 for a given time point.14 Clustering and Functional Enrichment. Genes identified as differentially expressed were 15 used to generate clustered expression heat maps. Hierarchical clustering (using Euclidean 16 distance and complete linkage clustering) was used to cluster gene expression according to 17 behavior across experimental conditions. The DAVID online resource (david.ncifcrf.gov) was 18 used to acquire functional enrichment results for the genes in each cluster. DAVID output was 19 manually summarized for each cluster. Plots were generated with R.",
