            "text": "Along with tRNAs, enzymes that modify anticodon bases are a key aspect of translation across the tree of life. tRNA modifications extend wobble pairing, allowing specific (\"target\") tRNAs to recognize multiple codons and cover for other (\"nontarget\") tRNAs, often improving translation efficiency and accuracy. However, the detailed evolutionary history and impact of tRNA modifying enzymes has not been analyzed. Using ancestral reconstruction of five tRNA modifications across 1093 bacteria, we show that most modifications were ancestral to eubacteria, but were repeatedly lost in many lineages. Most modification losses coincided with evolutionary shifts in nontarget tRNAs, often driven by increased bias in genomic GC and associated codon use, or by genome reduction. In turn, the loss of tRNA modifications stabilized otherwise highly dynamic tRNA gene repertoires. Our work thus traces the complex history of bacterial tRNA modifications, providing the first clear evidence for their role in the evolution of bacterial translation.",

            "text": "Compared with the total complement of 61 sense codons, most bacterial genomes contain only 25-46 unique tRNA species (Grosjean et al. 2010 ). This apparent shortfall in decoding ability is mitigated by GU wobble base pairing that allows a single tRNA to decode non-complementary codons (Crick 1966) . Additionally, specific modifications to the first anticodon base of the tRNA also contribute to wobble base pairing, sometimes reducing translational errors (Yokoyama et al. 1985; Brierley et al. 1997; Marck and Grosjean 2002; N\u20ac asvall et al. 2004 Agris et al. 2007; Bj\u00f6rk and Hagervall 2014; Manickam et al. 2015) . Base modifications are carried out by several tRNA modifying enzyme (ME) pathways, that chemically modify the wobble position of a large fraction (42%) of all tRNA species (Grosjean et al. 2010; Machnicka et al. 2015; Boccaletto et al. 2018) . Given their potential impact on the effective tRNA pool and on translation dynamics, MEs should generally face strong selection, especially in species with a restricted tRNA repertoire. Indeed, in several bacteria, deleting MEs is lethal or otherwise deleterious for growth and translation (Wolf et al. 2002; Shippy et al. 2013; Bj\u00f6rk and Hagervall 2014; Gao et al. 2016) . However, in some cases MEs do not appear to be essential (Noguchi et al. 1982) , suggesting strong yet variable evolutionary impacts of tRNA modifications. Recently, Novoa and colleagues showed that MEs unique to the three kingdoms of life have shaped kingdom-specific tRNA pools (Novoa et al. 2012) . However, the detailed evolutionary history of diverse bacterial tRNA modifications and their impact on key components of bacterial translation remain unclear.",

We first determined the occurrence of each modification pathway in 1093 sequenced bacteria that represent the diversity of eubacteria, and then used ancestral reconstruction to infer the major evolutionary gain or loss events in the bacterial phylogeny. To determine the causes and impacts of change in tRNA modification, we analyzed two other key components of translation: tRNA gene pools and codon bias, thought to coevolve under translational selection (Ikemura 1985; Kanaya et al. 1999) . Finally, since both of these factors are in turn correlated with genomic GC content Hershberg and Petrov 2009; Wald and Margalit 2014) , we also mapped genomic GC content across the bacterial phylogeny. Thus, we aimed to generate a comprehensive model of the joint evolutionary history of important components of bacterial translation-tRNA genes and MEs-and their relationship with genomic GC content.",

            "text": "Each modified tRNA can recognize between 2 and 4 codons. Although there are no direct measurements of the effect of tRNA modification on translation rate, the presence of a multifunctional tRNA should amplify the effective tRNA pool, reducing ribosomal waiting times for the correct tRNA, and contributing to an increase in global translation speed. Modification also ensures that tRNA carrying amino acids coded by two synonymous codons do not recognize other nonsynonymous codons, potentially reducing mistranslation (Grosjean et al. 2010; Bj\u00f6rk and Hagervall 2014) . Thus, tRNA modifications may affect both translational speed and accuracy. Specifically, we hypothesized that the presence of a tRNA modification should selectively favor the tRNAs that it modifies (henceforth \"target\" RNA). Concomitantly, selection on tRNA that are not modified by the ME (henceforth \"nontarget\" tRNA; encoding the same amino acid) should be weakened, since their function would be redundant with the modified target tRNA. As such, we predicted that the evolutionary loss of nontarget tRNA should be permissible only in the presence of a modification that allows target tRNA to decode multiple sense codons. In contrast, the evolutionary loss of a modification should be associated with a generally irreversible expansion of the tRNA repertoire to include both target and nontarget tRNA. Finally, we expected that these changes in tRNA gene content should be correlated with changes in codon use as well as genomic GC content.",

We suggest that the expanded tRNA set weakened selection for MEs, allowing their repeated loss via drift. Conversely, in rare cases, a shrinking of tRNA diversity may have favored the evolution of a novel modification; or, the chance evolution of a new modification may have relaxed selection on the tRNA pool.

            "text": "We determined the occurrence of tRNA modifications across 1093 bacteria using homology searches for complete protein sequences of previously described MEs (see Materials and Methods). We assume that detected homologs are functional, and have the same modification function as that of the previously described enzymes. Within each modification pathway, we focused on the following enzymes that directly modify the tRNA and complete the modification (see Materials and Methods), and whose absence should effectively prevent the modification: (1) MnmE-MnmG for the (c)mnm 5 (s 2 )U modification, (2) CmoA-CmoB for the cmo 5 U modification, (3) Tgt-QueA-QueG-QueH for the Q modification, (4) TadA for the I modification, and (5) TilS for the k 2 C modification. Note that in our analysis, we did not consider GU wobble pairing, which is not mediated by specific modification enzymes. We observed that except for TilS (found in 98.18% of the studied bacteria), most MEs are not found in many bacteria ( fig. 1A) , suggesting that different modification pathways were gained or lost in specific lineages. The essential proteins RpoB and RplA (positive controls) were respectively present in 99.5% and 99.7% of analyzed bacteria, indicating that our homology detection method resulted in very few false negatives. When multiple enzymes are necessary for a modification, they tend to co-occur in bacterial lineages ( fig. 1A ). For instance, both MnmE and MnmG are absent only in Actinobacteria. Similarly, both CmoA and CmoB are primarily observed in c-proteobacteria and e-proteobacteria. However, this contradicts previous reports showing that the cmo 5 U modification is also active in Bacillus subtilis and Mycobacterium bovis str. BCG (Murao et al. 1976; Yamada et al. 2005; Chionh et al. 2016) . Despite an extensive search, we could not reliably identify the reported enzymes in the sequences of any other organisms (see Materials and Methods for details). Hence, here we focus on the proteobacterial cmo 5 U modification. In contrast to the co-occurrence of CmoA and CmoB, for the Queuosine modification, we found that QueG is often missing even when Tgt and QueA are present. However, 244 of these species had the QueH enzyme ( fig. 1B) , which was recently shown to function as a nonorthologous replacement for QueG (Zallot, Ross, et al. 2017) . The relative evolutionary instability of QueG corroborates a recent report suggesting that in some bacteria, Tgt alone may be enough to generate the Q modification (Zallot, Yuan, et al. 2017) .",

We used a posterior probability value of ! 0.7 to assign the ME state at each internal node in the bacterial phylogeny. Four of the five modification systems-MnmE-MnmG, Tgt-QueA-QueG-QueH, TadA, and TilS-were predicted to occur at the root of the phylogenetic tree; that is, they were already present in the eubacterial ancestor ( fig. 1B ). In contrast, CmoA-CmoB were gained/evolved much later: once at the root of c-proteobacteria, once in e-proteobacteria, and once in some species of d-proteobacteria ( fig. 1B ). However, given experimental evidence for functional cmo 5 U modification in species such as B. subtilis and M. bovis (Yamada et al. 2005; Chionh et al. 2016 ) that do not have well-supported homologs to the proteobacterial cmo 5 U genes, it is possible that the modification was ancient and the responsible genes diverged significantly in different bacterial lineages. Alternatively, these enzymes may have nonorthologous genes in the ancestor. However, we could not test these hypotheses because the relevant ME genes in these species are not known. Thus, in general, we suggest that most bacterial tRNA modifications are ancient. These ancient modifications were then independently lost multiple times, with a total of 12 major losses (on branches with at least 5 descendant bacterial species in our phylogeny; fig. 1B ) and 19 minor loss events (in lineages with fewer than five descendants; supplementary fig. S1, Supplementary Material online). The only exception to this pattern of repeated ME gains/losses is the k 2 C modification (TilS), which appears to be evolutionarily stable across bacteria.

Interestingly, for the (c)mnm 5 (s 2 )U modification, both target and nontarget tRNA were present in the eubacterial ancestor. Thus, a subsequent loss of any of these modifications should be strongly associated with the gain [or retention, in case of (c)mnm 5 (s 2 )U] of the respective nontarget tRNA. Both predictions were supported when we observed that the proportion of species that have nontarget tRNA is significantly different between bacteria with versus without a specific modification (P < 0.05, two-sample proportions test; supplementary fig.

Overall, these patterns suggest that the loss of tRNA modifications was associated with the retention or secondary gain of nontarget tRNAs, and the gain of MEs was associated with the loss of nontarget tRNAs.",

For instance, in three out of the five comparisons made for the (c)mnm 5 (s 2 )U and cmo 5 U modifications, at least five of the six nontarget tRNAs were present in a significantly higher proportion of species without the modification ( fig. 2A , C, and D; P < 0.05, twosample proportions test).

A previous structural report shows that the Q base binds both C and U with a strength equivalent to GU pairing (Morris et al. 1999 ). This binding is weaker compared with the canonical GC base pair, and thus the Q modification may be lost in genomes with high or low GC content where canonical GC base pairs may be preferred. This hypothesis fits three out of four cases for the loss of the Q modification. Overall, these results suggest that except for the Q modification, modifications were lost in only a few instances of shifts in GC content. Thus, GC content may be the major ultimate driver of changes in tRNA gene content and the subsequent loss of modification may generate selection to fix these changes. Altogether, 3 of the 14 major changes in modification status were not associated with significant shifts in either tRNA or GC content, and remain unexplained. These included one instance of the loss of the (c)mnm 5 (s 2 )U modification ( fig. 3B ) and two losses of the I modification ( fig. 3K-L) .",

However, as observed in the sister clade comparison, the phylogenetic regression and mapping also reveal clear instances of GC independent impacts of modification status on tRNA genes (figs. 4-7). The strongest impact of tRNA modification is observed the case of the Inosine modification, where the target tRNA was present in all species when the modification was present (fig. 6) ; and the nontarget tRNA were absent in most of these species (fig. 2D ). On the other hand, the loss of target tRNAs and presence of nontarget tRNAs is strongly associated with the loss of the Inosine modification (figs. 2D, 6, and 7). Thus, the bacterial tRNA repertoire is strongly affected by evolutionary changes in GC content as well as tRNA MEs.",

Here, we trace the evolutionary history of tRNA modifications across the bacterial phylogeny, showing that the eubacterial ancestor already had nearly all known modification pathways. Some modifications such as the k 2 C modification were lost in only a few bacterial species. A previous report showed that the absence of the k 2 C modification in such species was compensated by the presence of the nontarget tRNA Ile UAU and altered specificity of the Isoleucine tRNA synthetase (Taniguchi et al. 2013 ). Additionally, we show that several major bacterial clades lost other modifications, often accompanied by increasing tRNA diversity and shifts in genome GC content and codon use. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that an expanded tRNA pool gradually weakens selection on MEs, allowing their loss through drift. However, once the modification is lost, bacteria likely face strong selection to retain the expanded tRNA pool. In contrast, if GC shifts shrink the tRNA gene pool, selection would strongly favor the innovation or retention of tRNA modifications. We speculate that in Proteobacteria, such a process may have led to the evolution of the novel cmo 5 U modification. Alternatively, Proteobacteria may have evolved the new modification by chance, secondarily weakening selection on the nontarget tRNAs. Interestingly, we also uncovered instances where changes in tRNA or GC content could not explain the evolution of tRNA MEs. In some of these cases, we suspect that overall genome reduction may have led to the loss of the FIG. 6.

Nonetheless, our results strongly support the conclusion that ME evolution was dominated by frequent losses driven by weakened selection. Note that reversing the direction of causality in our arguments requires implausible events: the loss of nontarget tRNAs cannot generate selection favoring the loss of tRNA modifications, and there is no reason to expect that the gain of a modification enzyme should selectively favor the retention of nontarget tRNAs. Similarly, it is difficult to imagine how evolutionary gains or losses of tRNA modifications could precipitate genome-scale changes in GC content or genome size. Thus, our systematic phylogenetic analysis clarifies the contrasting roles of strong versus weak selection acting on tRNA modifications, and on the evolutionary history of key components of bacterial translation.",

However, we also observed some instructive exceptions to this pattern. For instance, comparing across sister clades, we found that $33% of the species that do not have the cmo 5 U modification also lack at least one nontarget tRNA. This should pose a problem because codons recognized by the missing nontarget tRNAs cannot be decoded efficiently. However, we observed that these codons were significantly depleted in these genomes, compared with species that retained the nontarget tRNA (supplementary fig. S5 , Supplementary Material online). Thus, these relatively rare codons may not pose a major problem even if they are inefficiently translated. It is also possible that these codons are decoded by the respective U-starting target tRNAs that can pair with A, G or U ending codons (Grosjean et al. 2010 ). This scenario is especially likely in species where the Q modification is absent. Recall that all bacteria lack the nontarget tRNA for this modification; hence species without the Q modification should be unable to translate many codons. We hypothesize that in species where both the Q modification as well as the nontarget tRNA are missing, there is an as yet undiscovered GU wobble base pairing between the target tRNA and codons complementary to the nontarget tRNA of the Q modification in these species.",

Our results support the hypothesis that these changes weakened selection on MEs and allowed their loss through drift. Conversely, we hypothesize that the loss of nontarget tRNA may have generated strong selection for the innovation of the cmo 5 U modification in c-proteobacteria and e-proteobacteria. It is also possible that the tRNA loss succeeded only in the wake of the chance innovation of the cmo 5 U modification. These patterns generate a number of testable predictions about the future evolutionary trajectory of translational components in various bacterial lineages. For instance, MEs may be lost in GC-rich bacteria without major consequences for translation; such losses should evolutionarily fix the expanded tRNA repertoire; and MEs should face strong positive selection in AT-rich clades with low tRNA diversity. Specifically, in AT rich bacteria, the combination of MEs and largely target tRNAs should confer higher fitness than a full tRNA set without MEs. We hope that future experimental work can test these predictions about the evolutionary dynamics of translation in specific bacterial lineages. Our analysis also shows that multiple key components of bacterial translation have evolved in close association with genomic GC content. Although the evolutionary and ecological forces driving GC shifts and GC independent changes in tRNA diversity remain unclear, our work highlights the rich evolutionary dynamics of wobble pairing, and more broadly, bacterial translation.",

For instance, our definition of the (c)mnm 5 (s 2 )U modification includes three different modifications: mnm5U, cmnm5U, and cmnm5s2U, each acting on different isoaccepting tRNA. These modifications have unique MEs that are involved in the last steps of the pathway. MnmE and MnmG are the common enzymes for each of these modifications and they carry out the first step of the modifying the Uridine base (Bj\u00f6rk and Hagervall 2014 and references therein) . Thus, we considered MnmE-MnmG to be crucial, and other enzymes such as MnmC, MnmA, MnmH, and trmL as auxiliary. The Q base is first biochemically synthesized as preQ 1 and then Q 1 in the bacterial cell using the enzymes FolE, QueC, QueD, QueE, and QueF. Subsequently, the Tgt enzyme replaces Guanosine in the anticodon stem loop with Q 1 , and QueA and QueG convert it to Q (Bj\u00f6rk and Hagervall 2014 and references within). A recent report shows that a nonorthologous enzyme QueH carries out the function of QueG in species that lack QueG but have the Q modification (Zallot, Ross, et al. 2017) . Another report has also suggested the possibility of Tgt alone carrying out the Q modification in the absence of QueA and QueG, assuming the existence of a Q salvage pathway (Zallot, Yuan, et al. 2017) . However, there is no evidence for this phenomenon across most bacteria in our analysis; hence, to be conservative, we considered all four enzymes (Tgt, QueA, QueG, and QueH) as crucial enzymes for the Q modification. For each modification, we only considered species that had all crucial enzymes as having the modification; and denoted species that lack any of these enzymes as lacking the modification.",

First, we downloaded Diwan and Agashe . doi:10.1093/molbev/msy110 MBE all available reviewed protein sequences for each of the MEs from the UniProt-KB database. We created a multiple sequence alignment using the t-coffee program (Notredame et al. 2000) with default parameters. We used this alignment to build an HMM profile, and then used the \"hmmsearch\" command in the HMMER suite (Eddy 2009 ) to detect the presence/absence of each ME. We used the amino acid sequences of all proteins from the 1093 genomes (downloaded in November 2016 from the NCBI ftp site) as the sequence search space, and set all other parameters to default. Each search generated a table with accession numbers of potential homologous hits with a corresponding e-value and bit score. There is no consensus in the field with respect to setting an e-value cut-off to detect true homologs. Here, we present a slightly informative method of deciding e-value cutoffs for detecting true homologs. To infer presence/absence with precision, we implemented a dynamic e-value cut-off to eliminate spurious hits. We did this by plotting the number of species in which the ME would be detected as we increased the e-value cut-off (supplementary fig. S6 , Supplementary Material online). We observed stable plateaus where the number of species in which an ME was detected did not change despite changing the e-value cut-off, suggesting that these represent robust e-value thresholds. Thus, for each enzyme we set an enzyme-specific e-value cut-off as the first e-value at the beginning of the most stable plateau (see supplementary fig. S6 , Supplementary Material online). For each ME, homologous hits that had e-values lower than this cut-off were considered true homologues. The information on Refseq ID of the detected homologues, organism in which they were detected and their current annotation is shown in supplementary table S2, Supplementary Material online.",

However, in our initial analysis we did not find CmoA and CmoB homologs in these or related species. A closer inspection of the B. subtilis genome also did not reveal these enzymes, as indicated in a previous report (Grosjean et al. 2014) . Instead, there were a few entries for these enzymes in the UniProt database (each with a poor annotation score). We therefore tested whether these enzymes are true homologs of the proteobacterial CmoA and CmoB, using homology detection (using \"jackhmmer\") (Eddy 2009 ). We observed that only the query organisms showed the presence of these enzymes (data not shown). A survey of the SEED database (Overbeek et al. 2005 ) also revealed the absence of CmoA and CmoB in all but one Bacillus species. When we carried out a blastp analysis using CmoA and CmoB enzymes from E. coli in M. bovis str. BCG, we observed no significant hits for CmoA and no hits for CmoB with e-values < 5 \u00c2 10 \u00c03 . Thus, although the modification may exist in several species, we could not reliably identify homologs of the proteobacterial CmoA and CmoB in other bacteria.",

We fixed the number of simulations such that the posterior probability that an enzyme is present for 100 randomly sampled nodes did not change (supplementary fig. S7, Supplementary Material online) . We used the enzyme with the most variable presence/absence state (queG) for this analysis, and assumed that calculations for all other enzymes would be more stable. The mapping resulted in 500 enzyme states at each node of the tree. We determined probabilities of each state at each node and assigned the state that had a posterior probability ! 0.7 (supplementary fig. S8 , Supplementary Material online) as the state of the enzyme at that node. In case the probability was < 0.7, we assumed the same state at the node as the preceding node. To determine gain and loss of tRNA modification pathways, we marked the branch that succeeded the gain or loss of all MEs for a given modification as the focal branch.

For each tRNA, we first tested the full model: tRNA presence/ absence $ GC content*tRNA modification status. To determine the impact of each explanatory variable, we compared the likelihood of the full regression model to the likelihood of the same regression when the R value was set to zero. For reduced models containing only GC content or modification status as the explanatory variable, we compared the likelihood of the regression of the reduced model with the likelihood of the regression of the full model. When these likelihoods were comparable (P > 0.05; likelihood ratio test), we inferred that the reduced model was sufficient to explain tRNA presence/absence, and hence had a significant impact on the evolution of the tRNA.

(B) Bacterial phylogenetic tree(Segata et al. 2013) pruned to show the evolutionary relationships between the 1093 bacterial species used in our study.Branch tips are colored by taxonomic group. Filled and open circles respectively mark the major gain and loss of tRNA modifications (with at least five descendent species in the relevant lineage), as inferred by ancestral reconstruction (see Materials and Methods). Circles are colored according to the modification, as indicated in (A). Values in parentheses indicate the posterior probability of each gain or loss event for each ME involved in the modification pathway. All other minor gain and loss events (with < 5 descendent species in the pruned phylogeny) are shown in supplementary fig. S1, Supplementary Material online. Asterisks at the root of the tree indicate the presence of the respective modification. (C) Genetic code table showing the target (solid boxes) and nontarget tRNA (dashed boxes) for each modification, colored as in (A). tRNA with a yellow border are those involved in GU wobble base pairing and were not considered in subsequent analyses. The column titled \"Anc\" indicates the presence (gray cells) or absence (white cells) of each tRNA in the eubacterial ancestor, inferred from ancestral reconstruction (see Materials and Methods). Value in each cell indicates the posterior probability of the inferred state for each tRNA.our analysis demonstrates a highly dynamic evolutionary history of tRNA modifications that is dominated by repeated secondary losses and fewer gains (a total of 260 loss events and 105 gains across the phylogeny; supplementary fig.

However, in four of these cases the direction of association opposed our initial expectation, and clades without the modification had lower tRNA diversity (fig. 3G, I, M, and N). In three of these cases involving Tenericutes and the endosymbiotic species from Enterobacterales (fig. 3G, I, and M), we also observed a significant reduction in the total number of tRNA genes (supplementary fig. S3G, I, M, Supplementary Material online), suggesting wide-ranging gene loss that is potentially a result of genome reduction. Indeed, previous reports have shown that reductive genome evolution in Mollicutes has led to the loss of several tRNA MEs (Yokobori et al. 2013; Grosjean et al. 2014).
