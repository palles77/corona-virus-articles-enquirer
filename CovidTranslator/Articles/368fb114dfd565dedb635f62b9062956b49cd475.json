The environmental resilience and sophisticated organization of biofilms are enabled by the extracellular matrix that creates a protective network of biomolecules around the bacterial community. Current anti-biofilm agents can interfere with extracellular matrix production but, being based on small molecules, are degraded by bacteria and rapidly diffuse away from biofilms. Both factors severely reduce their efficacy, while their toxicity to higher organisms create additional barriers to their practicality. In this paper we report on the ability of graphene quantum dots to effectively disperse mature Staphylococcus aureus biofilms, interfering with the self-assembly of amyloid fibers -a key structural component of the extracellular matrix. Mimicking peptide-binding biomolecules, graphene quantum dots form supramolecular complexes with phenol soluble modulins, the peptide monomers of amyloid fibers. Experimental and computational results show that graphene quantum dots efficiently dock near the N-terminus of the peptide and change the secondary structure of phenol soluble modulins, which disrupts their fibrillation and represents a novel strategy for mitigation of bacterial communities.",

Biofilms are implicated in numerous technological problems from water membrane failures to airplane crashes 1,2 as well as in various diseases from persistent infections to cancer 3, 4 . Biofilms also form a large component of the ecosphere on Earth and their dysregulation can also cause significant ecological consequences. 5 Biofilms act like multicellular organisms and possess exceptional adaptability and resilience to environmental factors and pharmaceuticals. 6, 7 Both of these properties are afforded by the protective function of extracellular matrix (ECM), which is made from several types of biomolecules (i.e., polysaccharides, DNA, and peptides). 8, 9 To date only a few classes of compounds have been shown to be effective anti-biofilm agents. 10, 11 Peptides rich in amino acids such as proline, arginine, phenylalanine or tryptophan have shown broad-spectrum activity in killing bacteria within biofilms by targeting a universal stringent stress response in bacteria. 12 However, they are currently being developed only as antibiotic adjuvants because they are subject to rapid proteolytic degradation and are relatively expensive to synthesize. Small molecules have been used to inhibit the quorum sensing (QS) system 13 or interfere with the polymerization of amyloid proteins. 14 While further exploration of these strategies of biofilm inhibition need to be explored, the rapid loss of the small molecules due to diffusion into environment reduce their efficacy and increase their environmental toxicity.",

            "text": "These problems with the design of effective anti-biofilm agents prompted us to search for new materials platforms. Graphene quantum dots (GQDs) are a single layer graphene a few nanometers in diameter. They are often regarded as biocompatible alternatives of II-VI semiconductor NPs also known as quantum dots (QDs). 15 GQDs have been investigated for antibacterial activity due to reactive oxygen species production and membrane disruption. [16] [17] [18] While these functionalities highlight the significance of GQDs as a part of microbiology toolbox, we hypothesize that these nanoscale particles can interfere with the self-assembly processes of biomolecular components of the biofilms. Representing the common tendency of nanoscale particles to self-assemble, this hypothesis is grounded in the multiple observations of GQDs and other NPs to specifically interact and assemble with other nanoscale particles and biomolecules. [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] As applied to biofilms, GQDs can form 'decoy' complexes with the key structural components of ECM, thereby inhibiting the biofilm formation. Recently this functionality was confirmed by observation of GQDs acting as inhibitors of fibrillation of the protein characteristic for Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease. [28] [29] [30] [31] Counteracting known problems of other anti-biofilm agents mentioned above, GQDs have high molecular weight (10 3 to 10 5 g/mol) that slows diffusion and are resistant to proteolytic degradation.",

PSM\u03b11 peptide contains 21 amino acids and consist of a single amphipathic helix with a slight bend near the N-and C-terminal (Figure 5a) . 47 (Figure 5c) , which is consistent with the enhanced CD signal of \u03b2-turns at \u2248208 nm. At the same time, the number of peptide configurations containing both helix and coils decreases by 3.0 %, but the distributions are affected differently: the residues involved in helix secondary structure decrease in both number and frequency, while the variance of the number of residues in a coil configuration increase (Figure 5d, e) . In other words, the peptide losses \u03b1-helix structure in favor of the formation of \u03b2-turns or coils. Overall, the formation of stable PSM\u03b11/GQD complexes by electrostatic interactions leads to relevant changes in the secondary structure and peptide motifs, and therefore we expect the presence of GQDs to affect unfavorably the organization of PSM\u03b11 All rights reserved.

Specifically, the statistics of the inter-peptide distance (center of mass) were collected and analyzed (Figure 5f) . The results show that the average distance increased from 0.76 \u00b1 0.062 nm to 1.03 \u00b1 0.055 nm when a GQD is in close proximity. Moreover, the distribution changes from a relatively symmetric monomodal bell-shaped curve centered at 0.9 nm to a distribution with three peaks (at 0.57, 0.97 and 1.2 nm) with a wide shoulder at 0.8 nm. While each peak is composed by a variety of configurations (representative complexes are shown in correspondence of each peak in Figure 5f ), the analysis of the trajectories suggests that the inter-peptide Nterminal/C-terminal interaction, responsible for the dimer stability is disrupted by the presence of the GQD. Additionally, as the GQD interacts with N-terminal of a peptide, it alters the contact angle of the peptide backbones and causes the groups close to the N-terminal to stretch. Overall, the interaction between GQD and PSM peptides strongly suggests a frustration of the amyloid fibrillation, as observed experimentally (Figure 6a) , caused by the GQDs docking near the Nterminus of the peptides and by changes in the secondary structure (Figure 6b, c) .",

Here we identify GQDs as a potential therapeutic for this purpose. The specificity for amyloid-rich biofilms and lack of direct bacterial toxicity implicate amyloidforming PSM peptides in the ECM as the molecular target for GQDs. This mechanism was confirmed through experiments with isolated biofilm ECM and synthetic PSM\u03b11 as well as MD simulations. We conclude that GQDs disperse S. aureus biofilms by competitive assembly with amyloid peptides. The targeted disruption of functional amyloid formation likely results in increased free or oligomeric PSM peptides. 32 The combination of reduced amyloid mediated biofilm stabilization and increased monomeric surfactant PSMswhich have been implicated in bacterial/ECM detachment 35drives biofilm dispersion. In addition, such supramolecular complexes may also interfere with QS due to increased concentration of PSM monomers/oligomers that are tightly regulated by the Agr QS system. 48, 49 Considering the broader implications of this work, additional studies on the interaction between GQDs and amyloidforming peptides in other species (e.g., Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas spp) will provide new approaches and insights into the potential manipulation of microbial communities. Further engineering of GQDs for enhanced association with amyloid peptides may lead to diverse effects on a wide range of biological processes, biomolecular functions, and signaling pathways.",

Only low concentrations of GQDs were evaluated in this test due to the low concentration of ECM obtained from the isolation procedure compared to that from intact biofilms.The main content of the isolated amyloid fibers from PNG biofilm consists of small \u03b1-helical amphipathic peptides, PSMs. 32 PSM\u03b11 is one of these PSM peptides with capacity to form amyloid-like fibrils. We used commercially available, synthetic PSM\u03b11 to further investigate the effects of GQDs. Their fibrillation was monitored for 9 days with and without the addition of GQDs. The longer time of the fibrillation is caused by the different aggregation feature of PSM\u03b11 in vitro from PSMs in ECM of biofilm.37 Control peptides start forming short fibers in diameter of 11.4 \u00b1 1.79 nm and in length of 134.4 \u00b1 59.5 nm on Day 4, and the fibers were continuously elongated till Day 9 with similar diameter of 12.4 \u00b1 0.82 nm(Figure 3a, e). The length of the elongated fibers on Day 9 was not measured as the fiber length exceed the field of view and was confounded by nonlinear geometry. Meanwhile, PSM\u03b11 peptides were also incubated with GQDs at the concentrations of 50, 200 and 800 \u00b5g/mL. After incubation with GQDs for four days, small were found respectively in the peptide solution incubated with GQDs at the concentrations of 50, 200 and 800 \u00b5g/mL(Figure 3b-d). While incubated with 50 \u00b5g/mL GQDs after nine days, a few fibers in diameter of 10.39 \u00b1 2.06 nm were formed as well(Figure 3f), including short fibers with length of 201.59 \u00b1 64.4 nm and elongated fibers coiled together. At the same time, there are few short fibers and limited elongated fibers formed in diameter of 12.02 \u00b1 2.79 nm in the sample of 200 \u00b5g/mL GQDs (",

            "text": "Eight different simulations, with the GQD initially placed at the vertices of a cuboid encasing a single PSM\u03b11, were tested to study the interactions between the two molecules. The results indicate that electrostatic interactions between the positive charged residues near the PSM\u03b11 N-terminal, methionine (MET) and lysine (LYS), and -COOgroups present on the edges of GQD lead to the formation of stable conformational complexes (Figure 5b). The simulations show a large pool of such complexes, where the position and the distance of the carboxylic groups affect the structure of the aggregate. Therefore, due to the relative high number of stable configurations and the slow transition among them, we cannot make conclusive remarks about the details of the most stable complexes. However, the analysis of the PSM\u03b11 secondary structure changes due to the GQD-peptide interactions is revealing. The PSM\u03b11-GQD complex, shows an increase of 311.0 % in the number of turn motifs compared to the isolated peptide",
