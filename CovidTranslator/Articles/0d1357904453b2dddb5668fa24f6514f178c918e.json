The mutant constructs of S205A-N, 3D-N, and K52A-DDX1, were 82 constructed by introducing the specific mutations at S205\uf0e0A, S197/201/205\uf0e0D, and 83 K52\uf0e0A by site-directed mutagenesis following the manufacturer's instruction 84 (Stratagene). The full-length JHMV nsp14 was constructed by PCR amplification of 85 cDNA template reverse-transcribed from the RNA extracted from the JHMV cloned into pCMV-Tag2B (Stratagene, CA, USA) at the BamHI and 90 XhoI sites. Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen)-mediated transfections were performed 91 as described previously (Wu et al., 2009). 92 93 Cell culture and establishment of stable cell lines 94To establish the stable cell lines, the murine delayed brain tumor (DBT) cells were 95 transfected with either the JHMV N expression plasmids as described above or the 96 control pEGFP-N1 vector using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). Since the 97 pEGFP-N1 vector contains a neomycin-resistance gene (driven by CMV promoter) in 98 the backbone, which can help select the cells containing N expression cassette by glutamine, 1% penicillin / streptomycin, and 10% tryptose phosphate broth solutionextraction and northern blot analysis 109Total RNA from cells was extracted using REzol reagent (PROtech Technologies) 110 according to the manufacturer's instructions and re-suspended in DEPC-treated water. 111For the detection of JHMV RNAs by northern blot analysis, 1 \u03bcg RNA was denatured 112 and processed for electrophoresis with 0.8% agarose/formaldehyde gel running at 70 113 voltage 6 h. The agarose gel was soaked in 50 mM NaOH for 40 min, 100 mM 114Tris-HCl / pH 7.5 for 30 min before capillary-transferred to positively charged 115Hybond-N nylon membranes (Amersham Biosciences). The NAOH treatment will 116 break all RNAs into smaller fragments and thus minimize the transfer efficiency 117 differences between the longer and shorter RNAs. After UV crosslinking, the 118 membrane-bound RNAs were hybridized with the DIG-labeled probes generated by 119 PCR DIG probe synthesis kit (Roche Diagnostics, Basel, Switzerland) at 50\u2103 120 overnight. The primers used for synthesis of the DIG-labeled JHMV N cDNA probe 121 were 5'-ACACAACCGACGTTCC-3' and 5'-GCAATACCGTACCGGG-3'. The 122 primers used for amplification of the DIG-labeled GAPDH cDNA probe, -AGTGAGCTTCCCGTTCAGC-3'. DIG-labeled negative strand specific RNA 125 probe was synthesized by in vitro transcription by T3 RNA polymerase with the DNA 126 template prepared from pCMV-Tag2-JHMV N plasmid linearized by XhoI digestion.Viral titer quantification 129Confluent DBT cells seeded in 6-well plates were infected with 100 \u03bcl of 10 fold 130 serially diluted culture supernatants. After adsorption for 1 h, the cells were washed 131 with PBS to remove the inoculum, and then overlaid with 2 ml of solid medium 132 containing 1 \u00d7 MEM, 1% fetal bovine serum, and 1 % agarose. After 3 days of 133 incubation, the cell monolayers were stained with 0.1% crystal violet to visualize the 134 cytopathic plaques. The viral titers were calculated by counting the were first washed with PBS and then resuspended with 1 mL PBS 139 containing 1% Triton X-100. The suspended cells were layered on a 9 mL sucrose 140 gradient (10-50% sucrose in 50 mM Tris-HCl / pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl, 2 mM EDTA, 141 0.5% Triton X-100, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) in the 13.2 mL Ultra-Clear 142 centrifuge tubes. The 10-50% gradient was centrifuged at 230,000 \u00d7 g in a swinging 143 bucket rotor SW41 (Beckman) for 22 h at 16 \u00b0C. The gradients were fractionated into 144 12 fractions from top to bottom and subjected to immunoblotting. 30 \u03bcl of fractions 145 were collected and run on 12% SDS-PAGE for western blot analysis. 146 147Immunofluorescence microscopy 148The DBT cells fixed in precooled acetone/methanol for 10 min at 4 \u00b0C were reacted 149 with primary antibodies in 3% BSA overnight at 4 \u00b0C . Alexa-488/645 Fluor IgG, 150 (Invitrogen), and 4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) nuclear counterstaining were 151 applied for 30 min at room temperature. Images were visualized using a Zeiss AXIO 12 Imager A1 microscope. The primary antibodies used in the current of cell lysates, nuclear/cytosol extraction, and immunoblotting 157For total cellular protein preparation, the whole cells were lysed in buffer containing 158 150 mM NaCl, 0.25% Triton X-100, and 25 mM Tris-HCl / pH 7.4 with protease 159 inhibitor (Roche Diagnostics, Basel, Switzerland) and phosphatase inhibitor 160 (Calbiochem). After centrifugation at 12,000 r.p.m. for 15 min at 4\u00b0C, the protein 161 concentrations of the cell lysates were estimated by BCA Protein Assay Kit (Pierce). 162The Nuclear Extraction Kit (Panomics) was used to separate the lysates from 163 cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions. The protein samples were resolved by SDS-PAGE, 164 followed by electro-transferred to Hybon-C extra nitrocellulose membrane 165 (Amersham Biosciences). Membranes were first blocked with 5% skimmed milk in 166 TBST buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl / pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 0.25% Tween 20), then 167 incubated with primary antibodies and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary 168 antibodies, and then detected by enhanced chemiluminescence (-MS/MS using a linear ion trap Orbitrap instrument (LTQ-Orbitrap, Thermo 181",
