Regular testing of seemingly healthy individuals was not common until the introduction of the FeLV vaccine. FeLV prevalence in the preselected sick cat population in the 1980s was extremely high (33. 3-56.3% in 1985-1986 13 ) , and the introduction of the FeLV vaccination onto the Austrian market in 1988 was expected to have a substantial impact on reports of disease prevalence. It is, however, important to bear in mind that the 1985-1995 study did not necessarily represent the general domestic cat population and, in this respect, the current study provides a more realistic picture of FeLV antigenaemia in the region of eastern Austria.",

This distribution was expected, as it was assumed that the vast majority of the samples sent to the university were part of routine prevaccination screening. However, in 1996, and 2008-2010, cats <1 year of age also made up the largest proportion of FeLV antigenaemic individuals. It could be hypothesised that this is due to the fact that younger cats at an early stage in the disease process may be more likely to be antigen-positive than older cats. Hofmann-Lehmann et al determined that 10% of the cats tested in their Swiss population (n = 597) were FeLV provirus positive, in spite of a negative ELISA result. 21 The proportion of FeLV-antigenaemic animals older than 5 years of age remained below 10% for all periods in the current study.",

This corresponds with the results of studies in Switzerland, in Italy and in Germany, 9, 16, 18, 22 but contrasts with the study of Gleich et al in Germany where male cats were found to be significantly more likely to be infected with FeLV. 5 A number of factors influenced the results of this analysis. Most important of all was the fact that the tested population was preselected by external veterinary surgeons and that the health status of the cats tested was not routinely provided. While the majority of these samples may have been sent for prevaccination screening, some may have been from clinically symptomatic animals, which could account for the relatively high prevalence determined here.",

However, it was not feasible to assign follow-up and confirmatory tests to individual cats in this retrospective analysis, so that the percentage of false-positive test results and transiently antigenaemic cats cannot be estimated here. Additionally, such tests may have been performed in other external diagnostic laboratories. For this reason, it was impossible to tell whether cats testing negative were regressively infected, as such animals do not have free antigen circulating in their blood stream but retain provirus in their bone marrow. 16 In order to estimate accurately the true prevalence of FeLV infection, random samples from the entire Austrian cat population and additional virus isolation or PCR would have been required, which were not available for this retrospective analysis of existing data. A Swiss study has reported that up to 10% of cats tested and found to be negative for FeLV antigen are provirus positive when analysed by PCR. 21 Similarly, the assessment of antigenaemic animals did not include the possibility of abortive infections, where the FeLV is eliminated by the cat's immune system prior to antigenaemia occurring. Demographic data sent with the sample were highly variable, with the year 2008 being particularly poor with respect to data quality of this kind. For this reason, analyses of the effect of age or sex on FeLV-positive results were less statistically powerful than the analysis of overall prevalence. It would also have been relevant to have analysed factors relating to the cats' household situations, such as whether the animal was clinically symptomatic, indoor dwelling, free roaming, vaccinated, and so on, as well as whether the animals were undergoing an initial FeLV test or were being retested. Unfortunately, given the retrospective nature of this study, such data were not available.",
