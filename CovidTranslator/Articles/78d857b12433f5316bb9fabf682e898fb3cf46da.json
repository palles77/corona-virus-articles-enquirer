Breeding farms were stratified according to size and type of production (intensive or extensive). The number of farms to be sampled in each stratum was calculated from the latest census data available and the prevalence of seropositive farms obtained in other countries. Within each herd, the number of sows needed to detect the presence of the disease were sampled, according to within-herd seroprevalence data obtained by us in previous studies. A total of 5098 sow serum samples from 794 different farms were collected during 1992-1993 and tested for the presence of PEDV-specific antibodies, using a blocking ELISA with monoclonal antibodies; 55.9% of herds had at least one positive animal; 29.6% of sera were positive. Seropositive farms were detected throughout the sampled region, indicating that the infection was widespread. Higher farm-level prevalence rates were found in farms with more than 20 sows compared with small ones ( 120 sows) and in intensive than in extensive herds. On the other hand, within-farm seroprevalence and mean blocking percentage of positive sera decreased with increasing size of the farm.",

Two clinical forms of the disease have been described; PED Type I affects only pigs up to 4-5 weeks, while Type II outbreaks affect swine of all ages. Clinically, the disease is characterized by profuse watery diarrhea, high morbidity (close to 100%) and relatively low mortality, but still causing important economic losses to the pig producer (Pensaert, 1989) . Hofmann and Wyler ( 1988) described PEDV isolation for the first time in cell culture using Vero cells and trypsin-supplemented medium. Since then, several diagnostic methods have been described for the detection of both PEDV antigen and its antibodies (Hofmann and Wyler, 1990; Van Nieuwstadt and Zetstra, 1991; Knuchel et al., 1992) .",

There are no previous data about the prevalence in breeding farms in other countries, only from fattening or breeding and fattening farms from Belgium and Switzerland, with 33% and 28% of seropositive herds, respectively. The reasons why PEDV infection is so widespread among swine breeding farms in Spain remain unclear, but two facts could explain it. On the one hand, much of the replacement breeding stock is imported from other EC countries and also, Spain is a net piglet importer. All this traffic of animals would help in the dissemination of PEDV infection to other farms. On the other hand, the improvement of the screening methods, as compared with the ones used by other authors for epidemiological purposes, previous to the isolation of PEDV in cell culture, may explain a higher sensitivity and thus a higher number of positive animals detected.",

The higher within-herd seroprevalence in small farms could be due to the easier spread of the infection among all the sows, since this type of farm normally houses the animals in only one barn throughout all the reproductive cycle and they do not use an all-in-all-out system. Also, in small herds, sows are usually not restrained, and this freedom of movement in the barn increases the probability of contact with fecal material from another sows. On the other hand, in large farms an average of 35% of the breeding sows are replaced annually and also this could explain the lower within-farm seroprevalence rates found.",

The lower antibody titer detected in large farms, as measured by the blocking percentage, together with the high prevalence of seropositive large farms could be a sign of the presence of endemic infections in this type of farm. Also, the lower replacement rate in small farms could increase the possibility for a sow to suffer a reinfection and develop a stronger antibody response.",
