[4] [5] [6] Molecular diagnostic methods have enhanced our ability to detect established and emerging pathogens (e.g. human metapneumovirus) responsible for respiratory tract infections and have further established the importance of respiratory viruses in pediatric respiratory infections and AOM. 7, 8 Understanding the role of respiratory viruses and the development of AOM is challenging, as individual viruses may differ in middle ear tropism and in their ability to cause viral or bacterial middle ear infections. 9 However, improved understanding of which respiratory viruses are most closely associated with the development of AOM may be useful in the clinical evaluation of children with upper respiratory tract infections and in the development of viral vaccines for AOM prevention. Our objective was to examine the strength of the association between new and established respiratory viruses and AOM using data from a large healthcare system.",

This method is powerful as it does not disregard the stochastic dependence of consecutive measurements. For example, a high burden of respiratory viral activity today tends to predict high activity the next day (positive auto-correlation). ARIMA models are useful for discriminating between natural seasonal patterns and true associations. 22 However, the transformation of data to a stationary series through differencing has the potential to underestimate a true association with viruses which display milder seasonal fluctuations, such as rhinovirus. 23 Although temporal association does not prove a causal relationship, many lines of evidence suggest a direct role for respiratory viruses in the pathogenesis of AOM. Animal studies have demonstrated synergism between respiratory viral infections and AOM in chinchillas following intranasal inoculation with influenza A virus, S. pneumoniae, or both pathogens. 24 In humans, many studies have demonstrated the presence of respiratory viruses in the MEF of children with AOM by antigen detection, culture, or nucleic acid detection. Furthermore the testing of MEF and nasopharyngeal specimens by PCR has detected viruses that were infrequently detected by other methods. 25 As a result, rhinovirus, other picornaviruses, human metapneumovirus, and coronavirus have increasingly been detected from MEF and nasopharyngeal specimens of children with AOM. 3, 21 However, prolonged nasopharyngeal shedding of rhinovirus, enterovirus, bocavirus, and adenovirus [26] [27] [28] in both symptomatic 29 and asymptomatic 30 children limits the ability to determine the significance of the detection of these viruses in AOM. This may explain, in part, the absence of an epidemiologic correlation between rhinovirus, adenovirus and parainfluenza and AOM in this study.",

            "text": "Several studies have shown clear benefits of influenza vaccines in preventing AOM, with reductions of AOM of 30% to 83% among vaccine recipients. [31] [32] [33] Utah influenza immunization coverage was 49.2% (\u00b17.3%) in 2010-2011 among children 6 months to 17 years of age, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC) National Immunization Survey. 34 These data suggest that more effective immunization strategies have the potential to decrease the burden of influenza-associated AOM. In a study on the prevention of RSV infection by passive immune prophylaxis, intravenous RSV-immune globulin administered to premature infants decreased the incidence of AOM by 80%. 35 Passive antibody therapy is too expensive to have a major impact on the burden of AOM, but vaccines for RSV are under development. 36 Moreover, preliminary studies of the antigenic epitopes of human metapneumovirus may lead to the development of human metapneumovirus vaccines. 37 This study is subject to several limitations. First, this study was not designed to demonstrate a causal relationship between individual respiratory viruses and the development of AOM. Therefore, the temporal associations we observed must be further investigated by clinical studies at the patient level. It is unclear why the lag time between respiratory viral activity and AOM diagnoses differed by age group. Second, it is possible that viral testing may have been more likely to be ordered for subjects who complained of earaches, as opposed to those who reported generalized viral symptoms. Third, because respiratory viral testing was primarily performed among inpatients and those presenting to emergency departments our findings may not reflect the association between respiratory viruses, including rhinoviruses, and AOM in the outpatient setting. Fourth, we could not assess the immunization status of the children included in this study. Vaccine coverage for influenza and pneumococcal conjugate vaccines rose throughout the study period and were comparable to national rates. The rates measured by the CDC's 2011 National Immunization (influenza 49.2% and pneumococcal conjugate vaccine 80.1%) were comparable to national rates. 34,38 Fifth, we could not account for environmental factors such as pollution, humidity, temperature, and rainfall, which may represent potential confounding factors. 39 Sixth, newly described respiratory viruses including non-SARS coronaviruses and bocavirus were not evaluated. Seventh, our study was based in a single geographic region and thus our findings may not be generalizable. Lastly, the use of ICD-9 discharge codes may lead to misclassification, potentially incorrectly ascribing cases of AOM. We were unable to independently assess the presence of the AAP's diagnostic criteria among our cohort of patients; 10 however, ICD-9 coded AOM has been reported to be in 94% agreement with manual review of the medical record. 40 AOM is the most common bacterial infection and the most frequent indication for antibiotic therapy in young children, with substantial clinical and economic impact. Therefore, efforts to prevent AOM are desperately needed. Our study provides evidence of strong temporal relationships between AOM visits among children and RSV, human metapneumovirus, and influenza activity. We speculate that a meaningful reduction in the overall incidence of AOM could be accomplished by the effective control of RSV, human metapneumovirus, and influenza.",
