However, the mechanism through which SSc acts against HBV remains unknown. In this study, we investigated the mechanism of SSc mediated anti-HBV activity. Methods HepG2.2.15 cells were cultured at 37 \u2103 in the presence of 1-40 \u03bcg/mL of SSc or DMSO as a control. The expression profile of HBV markers, cytokines, HNF1\u03b1 and HNF4\u03b1 were investigated by real-time quantitative PCR, Elisa, Western blot and Dot blotting. Knockdown of HNF1\u03b1 or HNF4\u03b1 in HepG2.2.15 cells was mediated by two small siRNAs specifically targeting HNF1\u03b1 or HNF4\u03b1. Results We found that SSc stimulates IL-6 expression, leading to attenuated HNF1\u03b1 and HNF4\u03b1 expression, which further mediates suppression of HBV pgRNA synthesis. Knockdown of HNF1\u03b1 or HNF4\u03b1 in HepG2.2.15 cells by RNA interference abrogates SSc's anti-HBV role. Moreover, SSc is effective to both wild-type and drug-resistant HBV mutants. Conclusion SSc inhibits pgRNA synthesis by targeting HNF1\u03b1 and HNF4\u03b1. These results indicate that SSc acts as a promising compound for modulating pgRNA transcription in the therapeutic strategies against HBV infection.",

NAs target viral polymerase, which can suppress HBV viral replication, but long term treatment may result in development of drug-resistant mutants. Therapy with IFN-\u03b1 or PEG-IFN-\u03b1 has the advantages of finite treatment duration, absence of drug resistance, and higher rates of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) and hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg) seroconversion, but the disadvantage of great side effects is also obvious [1] . Therefore, screening or development of new drugs with potent anti-HBV activity, low toxicity and novel modes of actions is undoubtedly essential to combat the chronic HBV infection.",

It has been widely used to treat fever, malaria, influenza and hepatitis diseases in Eurasia, North Africa and many Asian countries [13] . In recent decades, many valuable biological activities of Radix Bupleuri have been identified, such as anti-tumor, anti-inflammatory, anti-depressant, immunomodulatory, hepatoprotective and antiviral [14, 15] . With the development of modern pharmacology, over 100 compounds have been isolated from Radix Bupleuri, among them saikosaponin a (SSa), saikosaponin b2 (SSb2), saikosaponin c (SSc) and saikosaponin d (SSd) are considered to be the major bioactive constituents [16] . Although the three sakosaponins of SSa, SSc and SSd share the same basal structure, their biological activities are not always the same. For example, both SSa and SSd have been well documented for their anti-inflammatory activities [17] , whereas little has been reported about SSc's inflammation regulatory role. In addition, among the four major bioactive components of Radix Bupleuri, SSc is the only saikosaponin that has been identified exhibiting anti-HBV replication activity [18, 19] . Interestingly, unlike SSd who stimulates mitochondrial apoptosis in hepatocytes to exhibit hepatotoxicity [20] , SSc exerts anti-apoptotic effects on both primary human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) and HepG2 cells [18, 21] . Therefore, SSc appears to be a promising therapeutic candidate for chronic HBV infection. Despite great progress, the mechanism through which SSc acts to inhibit HBV replication remains unknown.",

To confirm our results, HBsAg and HBeAg were examined by a commercially available Elisa kit. As Fig. 2b showed, in response to SSc treatment, HBeAg expression decreased by about 40%, while no HBsAg decrease was observed. Interestingly, we found that SSc treatment suppresses HBV 3.5-kb pgRNA synthesis in a dose dependent manner (Fig. 2c) , which was not mentioned in any previous works before. In addition to 3.5-kb pgRNA, HBV cccDNA was also examined to investigate which step in the HBV life cycle was affected by SSc. As showed in Fig. 2d , although the intracellular pgRNA decreased with SSc treatment, the HBV cccDNA remained stable. It seems that the transcription from cccDNA to mRNA is interrupted by SSc. To further determine the function of SSc, we quantified HBV total mRNA and HBcAg expression in HepG2.2.15 cells. As showed in Fig. 2e and f, the addition of SSc resulted in decrease of both HBV total RNA and HBcAg. ",

To evaluate whether HNF1\u03b1 or HNF4\u03b1 plays a role in SSc mediated pgRNA suppression, we compared expression of HNF1\u03b1 and HNF4\u03b1 in HepG2 and HepG2.2.15 cells. As Fig. 3a showed, HNF1\u03b1 and HNF4\u03b1 expression increased tremendously in HBV producing HepG2.2.15 cells. To confirm our results, expression of HNF1\u03b1 and HNF4\u03b1 in HepG2 cells transfected with either pEGFP or pHBV plasmid was analyzed by western blot. Compared with the control, HNF1\u03b1 and HNF4\u03b1 expression increased significantly in pHBV transfected HepG2 cells, testifying the strong link between these two molecules and HBV infection (Fig. 3b) . We then examined HNF1\u03b1 and HNF4\u03b1 expression in HepG2.2.15 cells in the presence of 0-40 \u03bcg/mL of SSc. Compared with the control, SSc treatment significantly inhibited HNF1\u03b1 and HNF4\u03b1 expression (Fig. 3c and d) . As previous work suggested, HNF4\u03b1 can bind to enhancer regions of HBV and play a critical role in regulating HBV transcription [12, 25] . We knocked down HNF1\u03b1 or HNF4\u03b1 with respective small siRNAs and compared pgRNA expression in the presence or absence of SSc. As presented, anti-HBV activity of SSc was greatly attenuated when either HNF1\u03b1 or HNF4\u03b1 was knocked down (Fig. 3e-g) , demonstrating that both HNF1\u03b1 and HNF4\u03b1 play important roles in SSc mediated pgRNA transcription.

Natural products, especially Chinese herbal medicines (CHM) are important sources of new drugs. Over the last 20 years, CHM were widely used in the treatment of HBV carriers and some of the herbs including Radix Astragali, Radix Salviae miltiorrhizae and Radix Bupleuri, have been proved to be effective in terms of seroreversion of HBsAg, HBeAg and HBV DNA [28] . Recently, a number of natural compounds from CHM that block HBV replication have been identified, including epigallocatechin-3-gallate [29] , curcumin [30] , wogonin [31] , ellagic acid [32] , artemisinin and artesunate [33] , chrysophanol 8-O-\u03b2-d-glucoside [34] , SSc [18] , asiaticoside [35] , helioxanthin [36] , and oxymatrine [37] . In this study we investigated the anti-HBV activity of SSc, one of the saikosaponins extracted from the medicinal plant Radix Bupleuri. As presented, SSc significantly suppressed pgRNA synthesis and showed little signs of toxicity in HepG2.2.15 cells, consistent with a previous study, which found that SSc inhibit apoptosis [21] . This has promoted us to search for potential intracellular targets of SSc.",

As demonstrated in our study, SSc significantly suppressed HNF4\u03b1 expression but has no effect on PPAR\u03b1, FXR\u03b1, RXR\u03b1, C/ EBP or cccDNA (Supplementary Fig. 1 and Fig. 2d) , suggesting that SSc regulates pgRNA transcription through HNF4\u03b1. As a global regulator of gene expression, HNF4\u03b1 has been generally involved in inflammation processes occurring in liver. Extracellular pro-inflammatory cytokines including IL-6 and TNF-\u03b1 have been proved inhibiting pgRNA transcription by dysregulating HNF1\u03b1 and HNF4\u03b1 expression. We questioned whether SSc could regulate extracellular cytokines expression in HBV replicating cells. Our data showed that IL-6 expression was upregulated in SSc incubated HepG2.2.15 cells. However, no signs of IL-6 promotion was observed in HepG2 cells without HBV infection (supplementary Fig. 2 ). It seems that SSc stimulated IL-6 expression in liver cells is specifically related to HBV infection. Consistent with our findings that SSc act as a pro-inflammatory molecular, Kou-Gi Shyu et al. found that SSc bore the properties to induce endothelial cells migration and the activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and extracellular matrix-regulated kinase (ERK) [38] . In contrast, other saikosaponins such as SSa and SSd have been proved possess anti-inflammatory activities [17] . For example, SSa exerts anti-inflammatory activities by inhibiting the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines and regulating inflammation-associated signal pathways, such as MAPK pathway and nuclear factor-\u03baB (NF-\u03baB) pathway [39] . In addition to inflammation, the contrary role of different saikosaponins in other signaling pathway was also be frequently observed. Kyo et al. found that while SSb2 and SSd stimulated prostaglandin E2 release from peritoneal macrophages and C6 rat glioma cells, SSa and SSc were inhibitory [40, 41] . As observed, saikosaponins of SSa, SSc and SSd share the same basal structure, but their side chain groups are different. The structure of SSa and SSd contains the same di-saccharide of glucose-fucose. However, SSc contains a tri-saccharide of glucose-glucose-rhamnose [17] . We speculate that the differentially presented functions of saikosapoins may be attributed to their different side chains, which specifically determines target binding, protein interaction or metabolism.",

            "text": "In addition to our findings, there are still a lot interesting points worth further study. Previous studies in cancer treatment suggested that saikosaponins (SSa, SSb, SSc, SSd) be potent adjuvant that are able to override primary drug resistance [42] [43] [44] , improve sensitivity to chemotherapy and radiotherapy [45] [46] [47] , and enhance liver-targeting effects of anticancer drugs [48] . For chronic HBV therapy, various drug combination therapies have been tried. Combination therapy offers several advantages over single drug therapy and has been found to be necessary in chronic HBV infection. For example, more rapid achievement of an undetectable HBV DNA level or increase the rates of seroconversion of hepatitis B e antigen [49] . It is seems that the selection of adjuvant is very important for chronic HBV combination therapy [50] . As we observed, SSc showed no cytotoxicity and was effective to both wild-type and drug-resistant HBV strain. These features make it a potent choice for combination with drugs currently used in clinical therapy. SSc was effective against drug-resistant HBV. HepG2 cells were transfected with wild-type HBV or HBV mutants resistant to lamivudine (LAM), telbivudine (TbL), or entecavir (ETV). The cells were then treated with 1% DMSO or SSc (10-20 \u03bcg/mL) followed by measurement of the cellular HBV DNA by real-time PCR Despite many advantages of SSc have been found, some issues about SSc's anti-HBV activity are still unsolved. For example, while studies from Tajiri H et al. showed that the prescription of 'Xiao-Chai-Hu-Tang' promoted clearance of HBeAg in children with chronic HBV infection, the toxicity of Radix Bupleuri were also be observed [51, 52] . Although SSc has been proved with effective anti-HBV activity and little toxicity, the conclusion summarized here was based on in vitro experiments. To investigate the effects and mechanisms of SSc's activity against HBV, related studies in vivo or in animals will be carried out in the near future.",
