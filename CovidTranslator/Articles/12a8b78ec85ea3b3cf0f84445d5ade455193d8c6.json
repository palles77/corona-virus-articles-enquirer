After the second world war, all 8 the involved countries had to face and to resolve several critical issues regarding the food productions: first, 9 the food security; secondly, the food safety of products; finally, nowadays, the improvement of foods from a 10 nutritional, technological, and sensorial point of view. Nowadays, in industrialized countries, the trade and 11 logistics management of food products have planetary character. In the European Union, the food trade is 12 simplified by the articles 34, 35, 36, and 37 of the TFUE (European Union, 2012) , which allow the free 13 movement of goods. It is superfluous to highlight the enormous steps forward made worldwide for the 14 production and distribution of food products. They are so huge that the critical issues of food security and 15 food safety seem to have become faraway memories. This food policy changed the eating habits of 16 consumers which move from local and retail markets to supermarkets and discount stores were they can, 17 with a single stop, purchase all the foods they needed. Moreover, the significant change in lifestyle, the 18 increase in working hours, and the ever-decreasing availability of time to cook, led to the inevitable triumph 19 of supermarkets and discount store.",
