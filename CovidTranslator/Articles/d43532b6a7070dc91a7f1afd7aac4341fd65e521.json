We measure risk perception, fear and trust against actual reduction in consumption and stated change in WTP for safe chicken between 2012 and 2013. Through a survey conducted in each year on the same Chinese urban consumers, we found that the consumption of chicken never increased after the emergence of H7N9 in 2013, and WTP for safe chicken did not necessarily increase relative to generic risks associated with consuming chicken in 2012. Factors such as the fear of H7N9's spreading, the impact of distrust (especially the distrust in government) enhanced the deviation of consumption and WTP; and the sheer mentioning of H7N9 is more important and negative than whether it was associated with a risk-perception reducing or risk-perception elevating message given to consumers.",

Unlike the SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) epidemic a decade ago, H7N9 virus showed no signs of human-to-human transmission, and the source of human infections was unclear with a lot of the patients having no obvious contact with poultry. To date no vaccine has been launched, and many Chinese consumers are fearful of this unknown risk. It is difficult to assess the potential economic impact of AI because the H7N9 virus itself is not sufficiently understood and people's response to an outbreak is uncertain.",

We developed questions related to the consumption of chicken before and during the H7N9 epidemic in 2013. In 2012 we surveyed 860 consumers in seven Chinese cities to gain a general understanding of safe chicken consumption by the revealed preference method, and determined their WTP for safe chicken in a generic sense. With the onset of the epidemic in 2013 we contacted the same consumers, recording again their chicken consumption, but queried their WTP with specific wording related to H7N9. Through this two-round survey of Chinese consumers, we are able to measure with specificity the incremental impact of H7N9 on actual quantities of chicken consumed, and changes to their WTP for safe chicken.",

The main objective of this article is to explore the impact of risk perceptions such as fear and trust on food consumption. This has been a topic of considerable interest to economists (e.g. Hayes, Shogren, Shin, & Kliebenstein, 1995; Brown, Longworth, & Waldron, 2002; Wang, Mao, & Gale, 2008; Turvey, Onyango, Cuite, & Hallman, 2010; Ortega, Wang, Olynk, Wu, & Bai, 2012; Lim, Hu, Maynard, & Goddard, 2014) . In many cases, how consumers respond to a food risk is a matter of judgment and affect with an effective response determined by how one perceives the goodness or badness about an event or stimulus (Finucane, Alhakami, Slovic, & Johnson, 2000; Slovic, Finucane, Peters, & MacGregor, 2004) , the images that they form of the disease (Jackson, 2006) or the availability of risk (Tversky & Kahneman, 1973) . With a credence component, individuals need more than personal experience to judge the safety of a food item, and often rely on third-party information (e.g. the supplier or government) to regain trust and reduce uncertainty (Bocker & Hanf, 2000; Lang & Hallman, 2005) . With the 2013 survey we included a number of questions to measure risk perceptions (affect) along the lines of Kraus and Slovic (1988) .",

            "text": "The objective of this paper is to quantify the effect of consumer risk perceptions induced by H7N9 on their demand. It sheds light on these issues with several important contributions. First, we measure the actual reduction in consumption and stated change in WTP due to an observed contemporaneous AI shock. By exploiting the 2013 outbreak of H7N9 and replicating the 2012 survey with the same respondents, we provide a rare glimpse into consumer behavior that can't easily be replicated in a laboratory setting. Second, we take advantage of the change in measured WTP between 2012 and 2013 to identify relative welfare shifts amongst consumers. In our context WTP represents the amount of income that the consumer is willing to give up to consume a given quantity of safe chicken equivalent to what is normally purchased or consumed under normal conditions. Because the WTP captures the compensating variation required to return the consumer to a steady-state chicken consumption level, the WTP measure reflects the relative change in utility between the 2012 and 2013 states of nature. It therefore captures an indirect and relative measure of welfare loss. The third contribution, and perhaps most important, is the econometric investigation of the effects of risk perceptions and trust on changes in chicken consumption and changes in WTP. We find that with the introduction of H7N9, the correspondence between chicken demands (actual consumption) and safe chicken demands (WTP) is not conforming for some individuals, and that changes in consumption and changes in WTP can be linked directly to perceptions of risk. These results suggest that food safety cannot be remedied by market forces alone, and to consider problems of food safety in the absence of psychological considerations may prove fruitless. The fourth contribution is a finding that consumers' heterogeneous responses to food safety risks in different cities appear to support psychological models of risk attenuation and amplification.",

Feeling good or bad about a particular risk is referred to by Slovic et al. (2004) as \"affect\". If fear is defined at the level of cognition, then affect represents an impact that can exacerbate or countenance the more logical reasoning of cognition. The effect is measured by its degree of amplification which may or may not be attenuated or rational (Pidgeon, Kasperson, & Slovic, 2003) and may linger far longer than the life of the stimuli. In other words, the economic implication of a food safety incident is dynamic (Liu, Huang, & Brown, 1998; Caswell & Mojduszka, 1996) and may display properties of hysteresis (Turvey et al., 2010) . While not often used to investigate risk perceptions related to food quality or food scares, Hallman, Hebden, Aquino, Cuite, and Lang (2003) have used similar queries to understand consumer attitudes towards genetically modified food, Turvey, Onyango, Schilling, and Hallman (2009) to investigate consumer response to Mad Cow disease, Lim et al. (2014) to examine the interaction between consumer risk perceptions and their preference for beef from different countries, and Turvey et al.

(2009) . Some studies showed that the marginal impact of risk on meat demand was small, with short-lived lagged effects on demand (Smith, van Ravenswaay, & Thompson, 1988; Dahlgran & Fairchild, 1987; Robenstein & Thurman, 1996; Lusk & Schroeder, 2004; Piggott & Marsh, 2004) . Dahlgran and Fairchild (1987) tested the marginal effect of negative information about salmonella contamination on chicken demand, and found the effects were b 1%, with rapid recovery of consumer's demands. In the United States, the recent cases of mad cow revealed lower fear or higher trust amongst consumers and very little affect as markets rapidly returned to the initial equilibrium states (Turvey et al., 2010) . However, the limited effect may have been due to the low risk level. For example, Setbon, Raude, Fischler, and Flahault (2005) found a strong correlation between the perceived risk associated with consuming beef during the BSE crisis in France and the perceived risk reduced beef consumption.",

The change in consumption when due to price effects, holding quality constant, captures movements along a single demand curve. But if prices are relatively constant, and the change is in quality, then demand will shift from one demand curve to another in price-quantity space. The second measure is the change in WTP between 2012 and 2013 which captures changes in expenditure holding utility constant.

However, the WTP is actually comprised of an additional demand component, health. Thus the expenditures do not only represent a demand for a return to consumption of chicken, but also include, endogenously, a demand for safe chicken and healthy food.

Thus the elasticity measure captures the relative change in observed Marshallian demand to WTP. If \u03b7 = 0, demand response to the new H7N9 information is Marshallian neutral, and if \u0394WTP= 0, the elasticity is undefined. We do find amongst our respondents situations in which \u0394WTP \u22640 is a curious outcome, especially since we find no consumer willing to increase consumption in the presence of H7N9. If this holds with a strict equality, then consumers are not differentiating the risk from H7N9 from other generic food safety risks, and the elasticity measure is undefined because of WTP indifference. But if WTP decreases, this could signify that consumers do not perceive H7N9 as being more risky than generic food safety risks. This would be indicated by a non-negative elasticity measure for \u0394Cons\u22640. If \u03b7 =0 then \u0394Cons= 0, which indicates that consumers have not reduced consumption or changed Marshallian demand, even though there is a change in WTP. When \u03b7 = \u2212 1 the percentage change in WTP exactly offsets the change in Marshallian demand. However, because of the integrability condition, this should not be interpreted as 1:1 tradeoff between WTP and Marshallian demand, but rather as demand falls consumers would be willing to pay an equivalent amount to restore consumption to initial levels. For \u22121 b \u03b7 b 0 the change in Marshallian demand is less than the change in WTP, indicating that for consumers in this situation the utility loss from quality exceeds the utility loss from consumption. They are less likely to consume chicken. In contrast if \u03b7 b \u22121, the change in consumption exceeds the change in WTP for safety. To varying degrees these consumers will have a guttural response to food safety and their own personal health well in excess of their WTP for reduced risk. ",

Our approach was to take advantage of the emergence of the H7N9 in 2013 and compare consumers' behavior \"without AI\" in 2012 to \"with AI\" in 2013. The survey was fielded in seven Chinese cities including: Nanjing, Changzhou, Zhenjiang, Lianyungang, Linyi, Zaozhuang, and Chengdu. According to outbreaks of H7N9 in 2013, we divided the seven cities (which were surveyed in both years) into three types: cities in the \"high incidence\" province (Nanjing, Changzhou, Zhenjiang, and Lianyungang in Jiangsu province), cities in the \"low incidence\" province (Linyi and Zaozhuang in Shandong province) and cities in the \"zero incidence\" province (Chengdu in Sichuan province). Nanjing, Chengdu and Linyi were selected to represent larger cities, Changzhou and Lianyungang represented medium-sized cities, and Zhenjiang and Zaozhuang for smaller cities. 2 The surveys were administered to the same group of respondents in April 2012 and 2013. In 2012 we asked generic questions regarding food safety in chilled chicken without any mentioning of H7N9 and in 2013 in the midst of the outbreak we resurveyed the group again. Since these respondents were surveyed both times (before and after the H7N9 outbreak), the data formed a \"natural experiment\". The survey in 2012 was a food safety survey which contained questions regarding the WTP for a safe chicken, actual consumption of chicken per week, 3 education, income and other demographic information (e.g. gender, age). The survey in 2013 was in April which was within 60 days of the 2013 bird flu outbreak. In addition to the WTP for a safe chicken and actual consumption of chilled chicken per week, the questionnaire in 2013 also contained the question about the information, knowledge, fear and trust regarding H7N9.",

            "text": "In order to calculate the WTP, we assumed that there were two types of chilled chicken on the market. One was ordinary chicken, which had an average chance of being contaminated. The other was safe chicken which was treated by ozone disinfectant, a substance mainly used to control bird flu. Both surveys began with moderators providing each subject with a neutral description of the food irradiation process. We labeled the ordinary chilled chicken at 30 RMB per chicken (1.5 kg). This represented the average chilled chicken price in the supermarkets of the seven cities. Then we asked the WTP for safe chicken. Respondents were asked to choose a premium payment card with values of 0, 10, 20, and 30. If the respondent selected a premium higher than 30 RMB, then he/she was asked to write down the specific amount (e.g. 35 RMB) above the ordinary chilled chicken price. 4 In the WTP card question, if the individual chose a card value C i as the highest acceptable price, the true WTP would lie somewhere between card value C i and the next card value C i + 1 (C i + 1 N C i ). Thus the chosen WTP card reflects the lower bound of WTP (Cameron, 1987) . For example, if a respondent indicated that he/she is willing to pay 30 RMB for a safe chicken, then the true WTP must be between 30 and 40 RMB, with 30 RMB being the lower bound. An alternative approach is to model WTP through a random utility framework (see example of Hu, Woods, Bastin, Cox, & You, 2011) . In this paper, we do not apply the method Hu et al. (2011) approach so our measure of WTP will understate (by an amount b10 RMB) the true WTP. Thus our estimate is conservative. The study was conducted during the very first large scale outbreaks of bird flu in recent years in China. Most consumers did not have a good knowledge about bird flu and how to protect themselves from it. As a result, consumers' perceptions on the issue and actions to avoid bird flu can be expectedly overheated during this period. To generate results that are more in line with what the market may be during a less intensified time, we would like to be conservative in both WTP estimates and factors affecting WTP. Econometrically, Cameron (1987) showed that the OLS/GLS type of regression generates less efficient parameter estimates. Nevertheless, the less efficient OLS/GLS approach is consistent with our goal of offering a more conservative measure since it will make it less likely to reject the null hypothesis that a coefficient is zero. This enables us not to exaggerate factors that may have an impact on WTP.",

This treatment effect is later modified in the econometric analyses to capture local effects at cities in which AI was endemic and those where no bird flu was recorded. Table 2 crosstabulates the actual change in chilled chicken consumption per week (one chicken is 1.5 KG). The first observation is that no individual surveyed increased chicken consumption over the period. Only 18.2% (N = 146) remained at the same consumption level. Overall, the effects of H7N9 caused approximately 82% of the consumers decreasing chicken consumption, with 56% (N = 449) halting consumption entirely. 6 Table 3 compares WTP for the two years.

It may reflect that the respondents were not so worried about the food safety of chicken in 2012; but their food safety concerns were raised significantly with H7N9 in 2013. 5 Up to May 1st, a total of 128 cases of H7N9 human infection had been confirmed in mainland China. To be specific, there are 46 cases in Zhejiang, 33 cases in Shanghai, 27 cases in Jiangsu, 5 cases in Jiangxi, 4 cases in Fujian, 4 cases in Henan, 4 cases in Anhui, 2 cases in Shandong, 2 cases in Hunan, and 1 case in Beijing. Shanghai, Nanjing, and some other cities suspended live poultry transactions and prohibited the entry of exotic live poultry. So sampling in Jiangsu, Shandong and Sichuan province could be appropriate to represent the \"high incidence\" province, \"low incidence\" province and \"zero incidence\" province separately. 6 The reduced consumption is unlikely to be a result of increasing price because the market price of chilled chicken has actually decreased from 16. Table 4 combines the relationships in Tables 2 and 3 by matching chicken consumption in 2012 with WTP in 2013. Virtually all categories indicated decreased consumption between 2012 and 2013 with the only exception of the 30 RMB (zero premium) for the 0.25 chicken category. This is because of a reduction in other categories, e.g. from 1 chicken to 0.25 chicken.

The more consumers believed in this statement, the lower consumption (\u03b2 = \u22120.045) and the higher WTP (\u03b2 = 2.718) was. Respondents who perceived the incident to be on the rise would decrease consumption and increase WTP (\u03b2 = \u22120.018, \u03b2 = 3.913). A rising incidence of AI might signify loss of control by the government. Duration and intensity might also be captured by \"AI is contagious among humans\" which led to a decrease in consumption, but had no effect on WTP. Variables \"AI can kill many people\" and \"I am personally at risk for AI\" were not significant in either equation, suggesting that consumers might find it difficult to internalize risk, or even death, from AI. This is quite different from the significant variable \"Eating AI infected chicken will immediately kill me\" which was conditioned on actually eating infected chicken. In other words, while consumers might believe that eating an infected chicken would lead to death, this might not be the same perception as the more ubiquitous risk of harm without the knowledge of consumption.",

The impact on WTP was not significant for Nanjing and Changzhou, but negative for Lianyungang (\u03b2 = \u221211.300). For low incidence cities Linyi, there was no significant impact on consumption compared to Chengdu, but there was significant reductions in WTP (\u03b2 = \u221230.220). Although somewhat mixed, relative to expectations, the results are generally supportive of an amplification response to consumption and WTP due to the different levels of exposure to AI in the cities studied.",

Collectively restricting the city dummy variables to zero affects the explanatory power of the base regression (Wald statistics are significant).

The higher the WTP observed for safe food in 2012 the less likely that membership would belong to \u0394WTP N 0, and would be more likely to be in the \u0394WTP b 0 group. This suggested that with the revelation of H7N9, consumers actually would reassess their WTP. In other words, if WTP in 2012 was high, the change in WTP would be smaller, probably because \"food safety\" in 2012 already took AI into overall considerations of food-related risks. Similarly, the more chicken consumed in 2012 the more likely the consumers would be in the \u0394Cons b 0 groups. Finally, we calculated the relative (shock) elasticity and provide results in Table 7 . The purpose of doing this is to measure differences in actual chicken consumption against the desire for safe chicken to the risk perception (and others factors). Here we take the absolute value of the elasticity so that an increase in the regression coefficient would indicate increases in elasticity. An expected elasticity is one in which an increase in WTP for safe chicken coincided with a decrease in chicken consumption.

For the last case, the possible reason is that somebody may treat the so called safe chicken as a \"Giffen good\" or inferior good because they did not believe it could be as safe as it was claimed.

We found from these natural conditions that the WTP for safe chicken did not necessarily increase with reductions in chicken consumption. Chicken, has many close meat substitutes including beef and lamb (Wong, Selvanathan, & Selvanathan, 2015; S\u00e4ll & Gren, 2015) , 9 suggesting that the iso-utility indifference curve would be linear and that \u0394Cons \u0394WTP b0. But this is not found generally, suggesting that WTP does not always follow the Marshallian demand when it comes to food quality and safety. Instead, we show that psychological factors related to risk perception can affect the relationship between \u0394Cons and \u0394WTP in many different ways, positive or negative, shifting demand up or down. On this point our analysis is in agreement with Hanemann (1991) and Shogren, Shin, Hayes, and Kliebenstein (1994) that when health is considered as a credence attribute of food, the non-substitutability of health in private or public markets adds varying degrees of curvature to the indifference curves leading to \u0394Cons \u0394WTP relationships that are not linear in scale.

The perception of risk generally led to decrease in demand and increased WTP, but the risks perceived were not necessarily the same for either. Trust in different institutions and information sources did not appear to be a strong determinant of consumer response in consumption or WTP, perhaps because the information provided by those sources are mixed and at times ambiguous; but risk amplification did. Consumers in cities in which H7N9 was endemic were far more responsive than those in cities that had low or no incidence.",

Perhaps this is because our survey timeframe was within 60 days of the start of the H7N9 epidemic which was the peak period of this round, and so consumer ambiguity and uncertainty may dominate any messages from trusted sources (e.g. the Ministry of Agriculture). This has also important policy implications for information from private sources but more specifically public sources such as the government and scholars. The findings from Ortega, Wang, Wu, and Olynk (2011) indicates that while the trust in the government may seem to be eroding in the face of recent food safety scandals in China, consumers were less confident on non-government food safety controls than government-led control measures, and this seems to be consistent with our findings. It may take a long time to regain consumers' confidence and demand when consumers are already confused and oversaturated by the media (Hassouneh et al., 2012) .",

For example, Wessells, Kline, and Anderson (1996) and Parsons, Morgan, Whitehead, and Haab (2006) found that seafood consumption decreased with negative information and increased with some types of positive information. Smith et al. (1988) ; Hu, Adamowicz, and Veeman (2009); Haab et al. (2010) found that negative food safety information tends to decrease consumption, while positive information does not necessarily have the opposite effect. We find that reinforcing any information about H7N9, positive or negative, reinforced negative consumption and perceptions. Perhaps this is because trust in positive information is still not high in China (Sirieix, Kledal, & Sulitang, 2011; Chen, 2013) . For example, Wu, Wang, Zhu, Hu, and Wang (2015) found that the WTP for certified traceable food in China was very \"limited\". This therefore suggests that government and private entities involved in food safety labeling, information and consumer education have a substantial amount of work to do to gain the trust of the Chinese consumers.",

It seems on the surface that the change in consumption might well be an emotional response to risk, while the changes to WTP a rational response to risk. Recent models in psychology based on this dual process in a utility framework (Kahneman, 2011; Schulze & Wansink, 2012; Loewenstein & O'Donoghue, 2004; Mukherjee, 2010) could possibly add clarity to the complex interactions of food safety, and risk perceptions. Schulze and Wansink (2012) , for example, show consumers' responses to perceived risk as a mix of proportional and dichotomous (safe/unsafe, good/bad) responses that are relatively more continuous in situations where deliberation is possible, and more dichotomous in emotional or stressful circumstances. Their dualprocess model seems to reconcile what is observed in our data. For example our findings that different aspects of risk perceptions affect consumption, while other affect WTP suggest that a more complex model may be at play.",
