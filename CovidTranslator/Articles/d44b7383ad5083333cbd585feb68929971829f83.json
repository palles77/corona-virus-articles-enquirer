Infants \u226412 months old were enrolled at the time of a clinical visit (hospitalization, emergency department (ED) visit or outpatient visit) with a diagnosis of bronchiolitis or URI from September through May 2004-2008. Inclusion criteria included: gestational age >37 weeks, birth weight >2275 grams, previously healthy infant, birth through 12 months of age during acute respiratory illness enrollment visit, biological mother available to complete skin testing and questionnaire, presumed viral bronchiolitis, lower respiratory tract illness (LRTI), or URI (as outlined below). Exclusion criteria included: adopted or foster child, unable to obtain maternal history, significant comorbidities or cardiopulmonary disease, ever received one or more doses of palivizumab, prior study inclusion, fever and neutropenia, children whose parents or guardians were not able to understand consent process, or language barrier. 12 Demographic and clinical data were collected using standardized forms, and nasal/throat swabs were obtained for viral testing. The Vanderbilt Institutional Review Board approved the study and parents provided written informed consent for study participation.",

The discharge diagnosis and supporting clinical parameters of the infant acute respiratory illness visit were reviewed to confirm whether each child had bronchiolitis, URI, or another diagnosis. Bronchiolitis was defined as lower respiratory infection in infants presenting with wheezing, rales, and respiratory distress. URI was defined as nasal congestion, rhinorrhea, cough, and/or fever without associated wheezing or dyspnea. Bronchiolitis and URI were defined using both the physician discharge diagnosis, as well as post-discharge chart review. Those cases that were not clearly identified as either bronchiolitis or URI were reviewed by a panel of pediatricians who determined whether the illness represented bronchiolitis, URI, croup or other (which included those that could not be categorized with the available clinical information).",

Among infants hospitalized with bronchiolitis, a higher proportion was RSV-associated bronchiolitis than among infants with bronchiolitis seen as outpatients, similar to other studies. The proportion of non-RSV viruses detected in bronchiolitis was similar between this and other studies, though one study 23 of outpatient infants with wheezing detected higher rates of HRV.",

The reason for higher HRV detection in their cohort could be related to enrolling infants at high risk for atopy, which is also consistent with other data from our group. 2 Thus, while URI is less serious, these data show that HRV is associated with a substantial burden of acute illness in infants.",

Interestingly, all of the PIV-positive specimens were seen in a single year, 2005-2006. In one prospective population-based US study 24 , PIV-1 circulated in alternate odd years in the fall. Thus, studies of PIV epidemiology should include multiple seasons to avoid underestimating the burden of disease, and ideally year-round surveillance, which our study did not include. In our study, the peak of HMPV detection was in February and March, slightly earlier than a population-based study 25 over 2 years in multiple US cities that found a peak of HMPV-associated hospitalizations between March and May.",

Our findings are consistent with prior studies 19, 20 suggesting that RSV is likely to be associated with more severe disease in younger infants even if otherwise healthy, and that HRV causes more significant clinical illness in older infants at high risk for atopy with a history of prior wheezing. Korppi et al. 26 compared infants < 24 months of age with HRV vs. RSV-associated wheezing and reported that infants with HRV were older and more often had atopic dermatitis and eosinophilia. These data are consistent with our finding 2 that infants with HRV-associated respiratory illness are older and that an atopic profile in the mother may be an important risk factor for more severe HRV-associated infant disease.",

Further, we evaluated only one geographic site. The percentage of children enrolled in Medicaid was higher than that of the general US population and higher than the proportion in Tennessee. This may affect demographic representativeness of our results. The population studied was similar to the US population in many aspects and the study center captures over 90% of Davidson County, TN infant hospitalizations. Infection rates in infants who did not present for treatment are unknown. A portion of infants presenting with illness did not have a study virus detected. It is possible that these were false-negative specimens, though our assays are sensitive and specific. These infants may have had low levels of virus shedding, had a non-viral illness or been infected with a virus not tested. Any additional evaluation performed on a study virus-negative patient was at the discretion of the clinical physician providing care.",
