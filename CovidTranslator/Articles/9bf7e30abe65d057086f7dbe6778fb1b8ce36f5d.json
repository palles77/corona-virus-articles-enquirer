However, further investigation is needed to determine whether phosphorylation of the N protein could affect PRRSV virulence in piglets. In this study, we confirmed that the mutations could impair PRRSV replication ability in porcine primary macrophages (PAMs) as they did in Marc-145 cells. The animal experiments suggested that the pathogenicity of the mutated virus (A105-120) was significantly reduced compared with parent strain (XH-GD). Our results suggested that the phosphorylation of the N protein contributes to virus replication and virulence. This study is the first to identify a specific modification involved in PRRSV pathogenicity. Mutation of PTMs sites is also a novel way to attenuate PRRSV virulence. The mutations could be a marker in a vaccine. In conclusion, our study will improve our understanding of the molecular mechanisms of PRRSV pathogenicity.",

It contains at least two phosphorylation modification sites. Marc-145 cells (Chen et al., 2018a; . However, whether the mutation could impair PRRSV virulence to piglets requires further investigation.In this study, we found that the mutations could impair PRRSV replication ability in porcine primary macrophages (PAMs). The animal experiments indicated that the pathogenicity of the mutated virus (A105-120) was significantly lower than parent strain (XH-GD). Our results suggested that the phosphorylation of the N protein contributes to virus replication and virulence.The results are also beneficial to find a novel way to attenuate the virus.",

In this study, viruses were incubated with the PAMs at an MOI of 0.1. Viral titres were calculated by the Reed-Muench method. As shown in Fig. 1 , the titre of XH-GD was always higher than that of the other mutated viruses at 12-36 hpi. XH-GD reached the maximum titre at 36 hpi, which is faster than the other viruses. Compared with XH-GD, A105 and A120, A105-120 showed lower viral growth at 24-36 hpi. There were significant differences between XH-GD and A105-120 at 24 hpi and 36 hpi (P < 0.01) (Fig. 1A) .

The N proteins of those viruses have a common origin (Yu et al., 2006) . Therefore, investigating the function of the N protein of PRRSV will help to understand the role of the N protein in the Nidovirales life cycle. The N protein of PRRSV, a phosphorylated protein, is important for the viral life cycle. A previous study showed that mutated phosphorylation modification sites could impair growth in vitro (Chen et al., 2018a; . Since PAMs cells were the target cell of PRRSV in the lung (Burkard et al., 2017; Shabir et al., 2018) , they were used to confirm the effect of the mutations. The growth curve results showed that the mutations could also regulate the replication ability in PAMs. We confirmed once again that phosphorylation modification of the N protein could regulate PRRSV replication.",
