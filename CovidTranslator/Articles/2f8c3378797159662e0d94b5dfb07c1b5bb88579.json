A univariate analysis was performed with the Pearson correlation and a multivariate analysis with multiple linear regression analysis. Results: A total of 505 224 patient visits were included in this study. On univariate analysis, there was no significant correlation between T and the ED volume (r = 0.012, p = 0.608), but there was a significant correlation between DT and ED volume (r = 0.109, p,0.001). On multivariate analysis, DT and holidays were identified as independent predictors of ED volume. We established the following formula in predicting the ED patient number: y = 265.42+(0.066T)+(2.576DT)+(59.776holiday). There was a positive association between T and the trauma patient number, while there was a negative association between T and medical and paediatric patient numbers. On the triage level, a low T was associated with increased patient triage level, while no significant association was noted between DT and the proportion in any triage level. Conclusions: Our study demonstrated that ambient temperature had differential effects on ED patient visits of different specialties and severities.",

ED overcrowding has been shown to compromise patient safety by increasing the risk of intrahospital infection and the rate of medical errors, even if there is no mass casualty incident. 1 High numbers of patient visits is a major cause of ED overcrowding, which means more critical patient and admission requirements than anticipated at the inpatient units. 2 3 In addition to the sudden increase in ED patient visits, an unusual patient profile (for example, triage level and specialty) may result in insufficient ED personnel to provide adequate care. When such staffing inadequacies occur, the ED director must respond with additional personnel. Matching staffing level to the various critical conditions of patients should not only conform to cost-efficient operation and patients' satisfaction, but also reduce the risk of medical errors. It is therefore important to recognise the factors influencing the ED patient severity and profiles in order to better tailor staffing and resource allocations.",

We also established a linear regression prediction model for ED patient volume by T, DT and holiday or weekday status. Specifically, we found that T had a significant impact on the composition of ED patients, characterised as more trauma patients, and less medical and paediatric patients, when the temperature is high. We also found that it was T rather than DT that determined the ED patient severity profile, with a higher proportion of patients triaged as level I and II on cold days. The effect of DT was mainly on the patient number rather than the patient severity profile or specialty composition. Our study confirmed the association between ambient temperature and the volume, specialty composition, and severity profile of ED patients. It is commonly believed that ED use is influenced by the weather. However, previous studies draw inconsistent conclusions. Noble et al reported a tendency to have an increase in non-ambulance patient traffic during more favourable weather. 8 Diehl et al found fewer walk-in visits during autumn and winter than during summer months. Higher temperatures were associated with more walk-in visits. 6 But a retrospective study showed that unfavourable weather (for example, low temperature, precipitation, etc) did not affect the number, the nature, or the case severity of visits to a paediatric ED. 4 In our study, ambient temperature itself had no statistical correlation with the total ED visits, but the daily change of temperature had a positive association with the total ED patient visits. This validated the fact that when the weather gets warmer, there are more ED visits, and vice versa. The effect of DT is more prominent in cold temperatures probably because the greatly suppressed ED utilisation in cold days was liberated when the weather gets warmer.",

            "text": "Our study demonstrated that the total patient volume was not affected by T, but the numbers of patients in different specialties were affected by T. This was because of the opposing effect of T on traumatic and medical or paediatric patient volume. On the one hand, when the weather becomes colder, the ED volume in the traumatic service decreases probably because of reduced outdoor activities. On the other hand, cold weather was associated with a multitude of serious medical and paediatric diseases that require ED utilisation, such as coronary events, cerebrovascular events, influenza, and exacerbations of asthma or chronic obstructive lung disease. This disease pattern may also explain the higher ED patient severity profile during cold days. When the temperature rises, patients with less severe medical problems go to the ED, as seen in the increased percentage of triage level III in this study, and this is usually associated with a larger increase in the ED volume. It is commonly thought that certain weather patterns, such as rainy days, are associated with a greater number of trauma patients. Bhattacharyya et al found a significant relationship between temperature and trauma centre admission volume. 10 Paediatric trauma admissions are likewise related to weather, as well as to maximum and minimum temperatures and hours of sunshine. 11 Our findings are consistent with previous studies that a significant positive correlation is found between ambient temperature and the proportion of trauma patients. This may be explained by the restricted outdoor activity when the temperature is below a certain point. [12] [13] [14] [15] Previous studies showed a weak correlation between paediatric ED visits and weather. Attia et al found no significant differences in paediatric ED visits and admissions during favourable and unfavourable weather. 4 Zibners et al confirmed the weak association between the weather and paediatric ED use, but offers little insight into predicting paediatric ED utilisation. 16 Our data revealed that the amount of non-trauma paediatric ED visits was related to the ambient temperature and the change of temperature at the same time. When the ambient temperature was low, the paediatric ED admission was high. But when the temperature rose, there was also a significant positive correlation between DT and the amount of paediatric patients, as with other specialties. This phenomenon might be explained by the fact that infectious diseases are known to be the major category of non-trauma paediatric ED utilisation, and common paediatric infectious diseases like influenza, parainfluenza and rotavirus infections are associated with cold weather. Therefore, we observed that the paediatric ED volume correlated with the cold temperatures. When the weather gets warm, family caregivers increased their demands for medical care of less severe diseases. This is why temperature change is related to paediatric ED volume.",

First, it was based on a primary and tertiary care medical centre located in a subtropical climate and where almost every citizen is covered by a uniform national health insurance with unrestricted access to ED utilisation. The generalisation of our results regarding other medical centres should take this background information into account. Second, we chose daily average temperature as the tested weather variable, and the effect of daily changes of minimal to maximal temperature were glossed over. Third, although other weather variables exerted little or negligible effects on the ED volume in previous studies, 4 5 11 some other weather variables not included in this study, such as thundershowers or typhoons, were associated with summer and might have confounded our results.",

The effects of the absolute value of temperature, however, were mainly on the case mix and triage severity. On cold days, paediatric and medical patients increase, and patients with higher severity also tend to increase. On warm days, trauma patients increase, while paediatric and medical patients decrease, and there were more patients with low severity. This linear relationship can be used to optimise staffing patterns. For example, more personnel is needed in sudden re-warming after an episode of cold weather, while more monitoring and critical care facilities are necessary when there is a cold wave. Accurate anticipation of these needs will tailor better staffing and resource allocations.",
