Based on this finding, a sensitive, practical assay method for the virus was developed. When DEAE-dextran was incorporated in the agar overlay medium, 67N virus formed plaques in ESK cell monolayers. The cytopathic effect as well as the plaque formation were specifically inhibited by antisera against the virus. Neutralization tests were developed on the basis of these findings.

The cytopathic effect began to appear 3 days after infection and consisted of cell rounding, fusion and eventual disintegration of the cell sheets (Fig. 1  a,b) . Thus, the infectivity of the virus could readily be assayed by using the cytopathic effect as the criterion for virus infection. Table I shows the results of such infectivity assays in the presence of various concentrations of DEAE-dextran. In these experiments serial decimal dilutions of a virus suspension were made in maintenance medium containing 10--50 pg m1-1 of DEAE-dextran and each dilution was inoculated in 0.1ml volumes into 3 tube cultures of ESK cells.

The maintenance medium contained 50 pg m1-1 of DEAE-dextran in one set of cultures, but no DEAE-dextran in the other set. At intervals, the culture fluid was harvested from 2 cultures of each group, pooled and assayed for infectivity after centrifugation at 1500 g for 10 min.

No cytopathic effect was observed. In the presence of DEAE-dextran, however, cytopathic effect began to appear 3 days post-infection and the cell sheet was completely destroyed after 7 days of incubation. The virus titre rose about one logunit higher and began to decline earlier than in the cultures with no DEAEdextran. In the cultures infected with the small virus dose, the virus titre began to rise later, and rose more slowly than in the cultures with the heavy inoculum, although there was little difference in the level of plateau between these culture groups. In the cultures infected with the small inoculum and incubated with DEAE<lextran, cytopathic effect began to appear 5 days post-infection and the cell sheet was completely destroyed within 9 days.

Based on this finding, a sensitive, practical assay method for the virus was developed. This is particularly important since the virus has been assayed in tissue cultures by rather cumbersome methods(Mengeling et al., 1972).The infectivity of polio(Pagano and Vaheri, 1965), rubella(Vaheri et al., 1967), rabies(Kaplan et al., 1967) and varicella--zoster viruses(Sasaki et al., 1981) has been reported to be enhanced by DEAE-dextran. The enhancing effect of DEAE-dextran has also been reported with human coronavirus(Bradburne and TyrreU, 1969) and mouse hepatitis virus (Takayama and Kirn, 1976;Hirano et al., 1978).",
