A serious public health emergency, it is infections in general, particularly when the cardiorespiratory system is affected, and 83 encourage rapid progression to respiratory failure in the gravida. Furthermore, the pregnancy 84 bias towards T-helper 2 (Th2) system dominance which protects the fetus, leaves the mother 85 vulnerable to viral infections, which are more effectively contained by the Th1 system. These 86 unique challenges mandate an integrated approach to pregnancies affected by SARS-CoV-2. 87 Here we present a review of COVID-19 in pregnancy, bringing together the various 88 factors integral to the understanding of pathophysiology and susceptibility, diagnostic as COVID-19 pneumonia rapidly progresses from focal to diffuse bilateral consolidation of 230 lung parenchyma, 11 which in the context of the pulmonary changes described above, would 231 more readily predispose to hypoxemic respiratory failure in pregnancy.",

The substantial morbidity 76 and socioeconomic impact have necessitated drastic measures across all continents, including 77 nationwide lockdowns and border closures. 78 Pregnant women and their fetuses represent a high-risk population during infectious 79 disease outbreaks. To date, the outcomes of 55 pregnant women infected with COVID-19 and 80 46 neonates have been reported in the literature, with no definite evidence of vertical 81 transmission.

In contrast, Th2-type 236 cytokines 12 are anti-inflammatory and comprise IL-4, IL-10, IL-13 and transforming growth 237 factor beta (TGF-\u00df). In pregnancy, the attenuation in cell-mediated immunity by Th1 cells 238 due to the physiological shift to a Th2 dominant environment 9 contributes to overall 239 infectious morbidity by increasing maternal susceptibility to intracellular pathogens like240 viruses. 241 Interestingly, the cytokine profiles in SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 infections in non-242 pregnant patients may be extrapolated to account for the differences in disease severity in 243 affected pregnancies. Patients with SARS showed preferential activation of Th1 immunity 244 resulting in the marked elevation of proinflammatory cytokines (IFN\u03b3, IL-1\u03b2, IL-6 and IL-245 12) for at least two weeks after disease onset, leading to extensive lung damage. 13 In contrast, 246 patients with COVID-19 demonstrated activation of both Th1 and Th2 immunity over similar 247 periods in the disease course, culminating in the presence of IFN\u03b3 and IL-1\u03b2 in addition to 248 IL-4 and IL-10. 14 Additionally, elevated levels of IL-6 (which is a predominantly Th1 249 response), is associated with a significantly increased risk of mortality in COVID-19 250 patients. 15 251 Murine studies of influenza have demonstrated that pregnancy increases influenza-252 related pathology via disrupted viral clearance, increased pulmonary IL-6, IL-1\u03b1, and G-CSF 253 expression and enhanced physiological stress in the lungs, influenced by changes in prostaglandin and progesterone levels. 16 However in COVID-19, a range of immune 255 responses has been described, and early adaptive immune responses may be predictive of 256 milder disease severity. 17 We postulate that changes in the hormonal milieu in pregnancy 257 which influence immunological responses to viral pathogens 16 together with the 258 physiological transition to a Th2 environment favoring the expression of anti-inflammatory 259 cytokines (IL-4 and IL-10) and other unidentified immune adaptations may serve as the 260 predominant immune response to SARS-CoV-2, resulting in the lesser severity of COVID-261 19 18 compared to non-pregnant individuals.

At present, it is available in 84 public health laboratories in the U.S -270 these provide in-state testing capacity in all 50 states and the District of Columbia. The test 271 utilizes specific primers and probes that target the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), 272 envelope and nucleocapsid genes of SARS-CoV-2, among which the RdRp assay has the 273 highest analytical sensitivity (3.8 RNA copies/reaction at 95% detection probability). 19 As 274 RT-PCR is a quantitative method where the amplification of DNA is detected in real-time, 275 the determination of viral load in COVID-19 is theoretically possible. However, this usually 276 requires laboratories to develop in-house test kits and validate them with internal controls. 20 277 In contrast, most commercially available assays for COVID-19 provide qualitative 278 results and false-negatives may be due to a low viral load. The practical limitations of RT-279 PCR testing include the need for a biosafety level-2 (BSL-2) facility, a requirement for kits 280 with specific reagents and primers, the need to maintain a cold chain (as the specimens 281 require storage at 2 -8 o C) and the use of strict, validated protocols for testing -282 consequently, countries with resource limitations or acute spikes in the numbers of suspected 283 cases may not be able to meet these demands. However, there are no good alternatives: 284 antigen-antibody detection tests are not validated, and viral culture is impractical, as it takes 285 at least three days for SARS-CoV-2 to cause cytopathic effects in selected cell lines (VeroE6 286 and Huh7 cells). 21 In addition, viral culture will require a BSL-3 facility, which are usually 287 only found in tertiary medical or university research centers. 288 Chest imaging may aid but not replace molecular confirmation of COVID-19. The 289 predominant findings are peripheral airspace shadowing on a plain chest radiograph (Figure 290 1) and bilateral, multi-lobar ground-glass opacities or consolidation on computed tomography 291 (CT) scan of the chest; 22,23 these features are non-specific and appear to be similar in 292 pregnancy. 18 Using RT-PCR as a reference, the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive 293 value (PPV) and negative predictive (NPV) value of a CT chest in diagnosing COVID-19 in 294China are 97%, 25%, 65% and 83% respectively. 24 However, when CT scans are performed 295 in pregnancy, concerns regarding the teratogenic effects of ionizing radiation on the fetus are 296 inevitable. Reassuringly, the fetal radiation dose for a routine CT chest is 0.03 mGy -297 exposure to radiation doses < 50 mGy is not associated with an increased risk of fetal 298 anomalies or pregnancy loss. 25 Although intravenous iodinated contrast media crosses the 299 placenta, studies have not demonstrated teratogenicity or thyroid dysfunction in the 300 newborn.26",

It has been shown to block coronavirus 366 infection by increasing the endosomal pH required for cell fusion and by interrupting the 367 glycosylation of cellular receptors of SARS-CoV in cell culture. 50 Unpublished data from 368 multicenter clinical trials across China 53 have demonstrated that the drug appears effective in 369 accelerating the clinical, radiological and serological resolution of COVID-19. Although 370 chloroquine and its metabolites cross the placenta, it may be safely used in all trimesters of 371 pregnancy with no increased risk of adverse perinatal outcomes. However, it is worthwhile 372 noting that chloroquine is a drug with a large volume of distribution and pharmacokinetic 373 studies 54 have shown significantly lower plasma drug concentrations in pregnancy, which 374suggests the need for a higher dose in COVID-19 (at least 500 mg twice daily). 53 A relevant side effect of high dose chloroquine however, is systolic hypotension which may exacerbate 376 the hemodynamic changes from supine aortocaval compression by a gravid uterus.377Additionally, as all betacoronaviruses including MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV and SARS-378 CoV-2 contain two cysteine proteases that process the viral polypeptides necessary for their 379 replication, 55,56 viral protease inhibitors such as lopinavir-ritonavir (LPV/r) have shown some 380 benefit in the adjunct management of COVID-19.57  Although not studied specifically in 381 pregnant women with respiratory infections, LPV/r is known to be safe -an analysis of382 population-based surveillance data of LPV/r exposure in HIV-positive pregnancies found no 383 increase in the risk of fetal anomalies, preterm birth or low birth weight infants. 58 384 Conversely, ribavirin, an antiviral guanosine analogue commonly used in coronavirus 385 treatment cocktails, 1,30 is teratogenic: it induces miscarriage, craniofacial and limb defects in 386 the embryos of pregnant mice exposed to doses exceeding 25 mg/kg, 59 and should be 387 avoided, especially in early pregnancy. Similarly, baricitinib -a Janus kinase inhibitor -has 388 been identified through machine learning 60 as a potential drug for the treatment of COVID-19 389 by inhibiting the endocytosis of SARS-CoV-2 into pulmonary cells. However, we opine that 390 baricitinib is contraindicated in pregnancy as animal studies have demonstrated 391 embryotoxicity. 61 392 Currently, there no approved vaccines for the prevention of COVID-19, although 393 several are under development but will not be available for some time. An open-label, phase 394 1 clinical trial in non-pregnant women and men evaluating a candidate vaccine, mRNA-1273, 395 led by the U.S. National Institutes of Health (NIH) has commenced recruitment on March 16, 396 2020 (ClinicalTrials.gov number NCT 04283461). The safety and immunogenicity of this 397 lipid nanoparticle (LNP)-encapsulated mRNA-based vaccine in pregnancy is, at present, pandemic, social distancing measures have proven to be effective in reducing disease 405 transmission. 62 Obstetric care can be served by this model, as our own experience attests to, 406 by streamlining medical care providers into self-sufficient groups, each minimally 407 comprising the attending, resident, intern and nursing or midwifery staff (Figure 2). The 408 individual teams function independently and provide inpatient labour and delivery services, 409 outpatient antenatal care, or surgical services, including treating women with suspected or 410 confirmed COVID-19 infection with full personal protective equipment (PPE) compliance. If 411 a team member is exposed to or infected with COVID-19, their team will be quarantined for 412 at least 2 weeks; workforce segregation thus ensures adequate clinical coverage by non-413 affected teams in this event. While inter-hospital movement of doctors and patients is 414 restricted, approved urgent inter-hospital transfer of prenatal patients to tertiary maternity 415 units takes place with full adherence to infection control measures, including isolation when 416 necessary. Ambulatory clinical care is increasingly conducted on Health Insurance Portability 417 and Accountability Act (HIPAA)-compliant telemedicine video conferencing platforms 418 (Zoom Video Communications Inc, San Jose, CA) which allows joint management decisions 419 to be made with primary care providers in real time.420 Fetal surveillance 421 Protracted respiratory compromise increases the risk of fetal growth restriction due to 422 maternal hypoxia which drives the release of potent vasoconstrictors such as endothelin-1 423 and hypoxia-inducible factor, resulting in placental hypoperfusion and reduced oxygen delivery to the fetus. 63 Given that IUGR complicates approximately 10% of pregnancies with 425 COVID-19, we would monitor the fetus with at least one ultrasound assessment of growth 426 following maternal recovery. Following sonographic evaluation in high-risk patients, the 427 ultrasound transducers should be disinfected according to the manufacturer'arrive at the labor ward must be stratified, based on local case definitions, into 431 low, moderate or high risk of COVID-19 infection to determine the disposition of the patient 432 and type of infection control precautions required of the healthcare staff (Figure 3). 433 The mode of delivery is directed by obstetric factors and clinical urgency. As there is 434 no convincing evidence of vertical transmission, 18 vaginal delivery is not contraindicated in 435 patients with COVID-19. When emergent delivery is required in a critically ill parturient, a 436 cesarean section is most appropriate -these indications include rapid maternal deterioration, 437 difficulty with mechanical ventilation due to the gravid uterus, and fetal compromise.438 Delivery, including cesarean sections, should be carried out with respiratory precautions 439 using full personal protective equipment (PPE) and in rooms with negative pressure 440 ventilation. 65 441 Patient self-administered inhalation of nitrous oxide and oxygen (Entonox) is a widely 442 used labor analgesic. However, respiratory viruses contaminating the gas delivery apparatus 443 may be a neglected source of cross-infection and birth attendants should be aware of 444 decontamination guidelines, which include the cleaning of the expiratory valve between 445 patients, and the use of a microbiological filter (pore size < 0.05\u03bcm) between the mouthpiece 446 or facemask. 66 Similarly, in a woman with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 requiring 447 supplemental oxygen in labor, a surgical mask should worn over the nasal cannula, as humidifying oxygen results in the aerosolization (or spray) of infectious particles to a radius 449 of about 0.4 meters, with a resultant risk of nosocomial droplet infection. 67,68 450 Although the data do not suggest a risk of vertical transmission, delayed clamping of 451 the umbilical cord and skin-to-skin contact should be avoided following delivery, 452 extrapolating from recommendations by the Canadian Society of Obstetricians and 453 Gynecologists guidelines for SARS in pregnancy. 65 454 Breastfeeding is not contraindicated, based on current published guidelines 69,70 -a 455 retrospective analysis of COVID-19 in pregnancy showed that none of the women had 456 detectable viral loads of SARS-CoV-2 in breastmilk. 18 Regardless, if the patient chooses to 457 breastfeed, a face mask should be worn due to the close proximity between mother and child 458 to reduce the risk of droplet transmission. The presence of coronavirus antibodies in 459 breastmilk depends on the gestation at which maternal infection occurred and if there was 460 any preceding use of high-dose corticosteroids which could suppress maternal antibody",

Most recently, two neonates from COVID-19 infected mothers are said to have tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 shortly following delivery, casting concerns about the possibility of vertical transmission.34,35    However, there have been no confirmed instances of vertical transmission among the 46 other neonates 18, 36-41 born to COVID-19 infected mothers reported thus far, supported in turn by evidence demonstrating an absence of viral isolates in the amniotic fluid, cord blood, breast milk and neonatal throat swabs in a subset of these patients.18  It is notable, however, that the overwhelming majority of these women acquired COVID-19 in the third trimesterthere is currently no data on perinatal outcome when the infection is acquired in early pregnancy. Regardless of the risk, it is reassuring that COVID-19 appears to manifest as a Symptomatic treatment and pregnancy-specific management of complications such as sepsis and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) comprise the current standards of care. A high Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score and D-dimer levels > 1 \u03bcg/mL on admission predict increased mortality in non-pregnant patients with COVID-19. 44 However, 336 D-dimer levels are difficult to interpret as the values are usually raised in pregnancy, such that only 84%, 33% and 1% of women in the first, second and third trimesters respectively would have normal results based on conventional thresholds.45  The SOFA score should also be adjusted to reflect the influence of pregnancy on hemodynamics and renal blood flow, such as utilizing a creatinine level > 1.02 mg/dL (instead of > 1.20 mg/dL) to signify renal dysfunction. 46 Additionally, mechanical ventilation requires achieving higher maternal oxygen (target PaO 2 > 70 mmHg instead of 55 -80 mmHg) and lower carbon dioxide levelsWe concur with the WHO recommendation against the routine use of systemic corticosteroids, as it appears to delay viral clearance with no survival benefit. 48 Although neither hydrocortisone nor methylprednisolone readily crosses the placenta, prolonged exposure predisposes to maternal hyperglycemia -this is immunosuppressive and sustains the replication of respiratory viruses within pulmonary epithelial cells.49  However, in cases of expedited preterm delivery for obstetric or medical indications, the decision to use corticosteroids to accelerate fetal maturity and minimise peripartum complications should be individualised. Good obstetric practice should prevail and urgent delivery should not be The Monitored Emergency Use of Unregistered Interventions (MEURI) framework from the WHO should guide the ethical use of non-licensed drugs in pregnancy during pandemics.Recent studies have identified remdesivir and chloroquine 50 as strong candidate drugs for the treatment of COVID-19.
