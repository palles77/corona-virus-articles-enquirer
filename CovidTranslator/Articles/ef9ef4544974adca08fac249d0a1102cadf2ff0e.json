The crystal structure of Nsp9 of human coronavirus (HCoV) 229E reveals a novel disulfide-linked homodimer, which is very different from the previously reported Nsp9 dimer of SARS coronavirus. In contrast, the structure of the Cys69Ala mutant of HCoV-229E Nsp9 shows the same dimer organization as the SARS-CoV protein. In the crystal, the wild-type HCoV-229E protein forms a trimer of dimers, whereas the mutant and SARS-CoV Nsp9 are organized in rod-like polymers. Chemical cross-linking suggests similar modes of aggregation in solution. In zone-interference gel electrophoresis assays and surface plasmon resonance experiments, the HCoV-229E wild-type protein is found to bind oligonucleotides with relatively high affinity, whereas binding by the Cys69Ala and Cys69Ser mutants is observed only for the longest oligonucleotides. The corresponding mutations in SARS-CoV Nsp9 do not hamper nucleic acid binding. From the crystal structures, a model for single-stranded RNA binding by Nsp9 is deduced. We propose that both forms of the Nsp9 dimer are biologically relevant; the occurrence of the disulfide-bonded form may be correlated with oxidative stress induced in the host cell by the viral infection.",

            "text": "Since a coronavirus was identified as the causative agent of the 2003 outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), [1] [2] [3] [4] scientific interest in this family of viruses has increased dramatically. 5 Coronaviruses are enveloped, positive-strand RNA viruses that cause a wide spectrum of disease in humans and animals. These viruses are divided into three distinct groups on the basis of genome organization and phylogenetic analysis. Human coronavirus 229E (HCoV 229E) causes a mild form of the common cold and belongs to group 1, which includes the recently discovered human coronavirus NL63 6 and the porcine coronavirus, transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV). Human coronaviruses belonging to group 2 are OC43 and HKU1, the latter also having been discovered very recently. 7 The SARS coronavirus has been classified as an outlier of group 2. 8 Coronaviruses infecting birds have been identified as a separate group (group 3). 9 The genome of HCoV 229E consists of 27,277 nucleotides, comprising a total of eight open reading frames. The entire replicase complex of the virus is encoded within two large overlapping open reading frames, ORF 1a and ORF 1b. ORF 1a codes for polyprotein 1a (pp1a) with a calculated molecular mass of 454 kDa. Involving a (\u22121) ribosomal frameshift, translation of ORF 1a and ORF 1b together yields the giant polypeptide 1ab (pp1ab) with a calculated molecular mass of 754 kDa. 10, 11 These polyproteins are processed by two virus-encoded papain-like proteases (PL1 pro and PL2 pro ) 12 and the main proteinase (M pro , also called 3C-like protease, 3CL pro ), 13 resulting in 16 non-structural proteins (Nsps). The crystal structure of HCoV-229E M pro has been determined by our group 14 and shown to be similar to that of the homologous enzyme from TGEV. 15 The structure of the SARS-CoV M pro16, 17 is also very similar.",

Nsp8 of SARS-CoV has the function of an RNA primase; 21 its 8:8 complex with Nsp7 has a three-dimensional structure reminiscent of the \u03b2 2 \"sliding clamp\" of bacterial DNA polymerase, with a central channel suitable for double-stranded RNA binding. 22 It has been shown by analytical ultracentrifugation that Nsp8 also interacts with Nsp9, 23 although according to our own measurements using surface plasmon resonance, this interaction is either absent or very weak (R.P., unpublished results). Colocalization of Nsp7, Nsp8, Nsp9, and Nsp10 was observed in MHV. 24 Very likely, these non-structural proteins are involved directly in the replication complex built around the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (Nsp12).",

In spite of 45% sequence identity between SARS-CoV and HCoV-229E Nsp9, the wild-type structure of the latter exhibits a mode of homodimerization that is entirely different from what has been observed in the crystal structure of the former. 23, 25 To probe the effect of the observed intermolecular disulfide bridge on the formation of the HCoV-229E Nsp9 dimer, Cys69 was mutated to alanine. The crystal structure of this Nsp9 mutant shows a dimerization mode similar to that observed in SARS-CoV Nsp9. 23, 25 However, gel mobility-shift assays and surface plasmon resonance (SPR) measurements indicate that only the wild-type HCoV-229E Nsp9, not the Cys69Ala mutant, binds strongly to single-stranded RNA and singlestranded DNA. In order to assess a possible direct role of Cys69 in nucleic acid binding, this residue was also replaced by serine. Again, the mutant showed little or no affinity to single-stranded DNA (ssDNA). Finally, the corresponding residue (Cys73) of SARS-CoV Nsp9, which did not form a disulfide bond, was replaced by alanine and serine. Both mutants showed wild-type affinity to singlestranded oligonucleotides. It is therefore concluded that Nsp9 of HCoV 229E is substantially different from its orthologue in SARS-CoV.",

            "text": "Wild-type HCoV-229E Nsp9 and its Cys69Ala and Cys69Ser mutants were cloned with a His 6 tag connected to the N terminus of the protein via the linker sequence VKLQ. The latter tetrapeptide corresponds to the C terminus of SARS-coronavirus Nsp8 (as well as HCoV-229E Nsp8) and therefore introduces a cleavage site for the main proteinase (M pro ) of SARS-CoV. After purification of the His 6tagged protein using Ni-NTA chromatography, cleavage with the M pro yielded Nsp9 with an authentic N terminus. The wild-type Nsp9 was crystallized using a reservoir containing 1.8-2.1 M ammonium sulfate, 0.1 M sodium acetate pH 4.0-4.5, and 5% (v/v) 2-methyl-2,4-pentanediol (MPD). Crystals were of space group P622, with a monomer in the asymmetric unit ( Table 1 ). The structure was determined by molecular replacement, using a monomer of the SARS-CoV Nsp9 25 as the search model, and refined to 1.75 \u00c5 resolution. Residues 1-7 and 33-36 could not be modeled due to lack of electron density. Alternate conformations were detected in the electron density for the side-chains of Met9 and Lys82. The final R-factor for the structural model is 19.0% and the R free is 22.4%; 97.2% of the amino acid residues are in the most-favored regions of the Ramachandran plot and the remainder in the additionally allowed regions. 26 The Cys69Ala mutant of HCoV-229E Nsp9 was prepared by single-site PCR mutagenesis from the wild-type plasmid. Preparation of the protein was identical with wild-type Nsp9. The conditions identified for crystallization of the wild-type Nsp9 failed to yield crystals of the mutant. Instead, the following crystallization conditions were established: 0.2 M ammonium sulfate, 0.2 M sodium acetate (pH 4.6), 30% (w/v) polyethylene glycol monomethyl ether (PEG-MME) 2000. The crystals displayed space group P2 1 2 1 2 1 , with a dimer of the Nsp9 mutant per asymmetric unit (Table 1) . Residues 1, 2 and 109 of monomer A have not been modeled due to lack of electron density; the same is true for residues 1-4 and 107-109 of monomer B. The segment comprising residues 53-56 could be built into electron density but proved to be very flexible. The structure was refined to a resolution of 1.80 \u00c5, with R = 22.1% and R free = 28.1% (see Supplementary Data Fig. S1 ). Of the amino acid residues in the structural model, 92.5% are in the most favored regions of the Ramachandran plot and the remainder are in the additionally allowed regions. 26 Overall structure of the Nsp9 monomer Crystals of wild-type HCoV-229E Nsp9 contain one monomer per asymmetric unit, which forms a homodimer due to the crystallographic twofold axis (see below). The fold of the monomer is related to the oligonucleotide/oligosaccharide-binding modules (OB fold). This fold is characteristic of proteins binding to single-stranded nucleic acids 27 and occurs, for example, in ssDNA-binding proteins from bacteria 28 to man 29 as well as in viruses. 30 The canonical OB fold comprises five antiparallel \u03b2strands that form a partial barrel, and an \u03b1-helix that packs against the bottom of the barrel, usually in an orientation along the long axis of the \u03b2-barrel crosssection. 27 In the classical OB fold, the \u03b1-helix is interspersed between \u03b2-strands 3 and 4, but in Nsp9 the helix is appended at the C terminus of the polypeptide chain (residues 92-108). Also, Nsp9 has two extra \u03b2-strands (strands 6 and 7) forming a long hairpin (L67). Some of the loops connecting the \u03b2strands, e.g. L12, L23, L45, and L67 (see Fig. 1 ), are very flexible.",

The hydrophobic side of the MPD interacts with Leu29 and packs against the helix near Val106 (Supplementary Data Fig. S2 ).

A disulfide bond is not formed, and the dimerization interface involves mainly the \u03b1helix of each subunit, but in a parallel rather than anti-parallel orientation. 23, 25 In contrast to HCoV-229E Nsp9, which we had prepared with authentic N and C termini, the SARS-CoV protein used by Sutton et al. 23 for crystallization carried 30 additional amino acid residues at the N terminus, due to the cloning procedure. From the structure, 23 it is evident that the additional N-terminal segment leads to formation of a \u03b2-hairpin involving residues \u22127 to 8, as well as an intermolecular salt bridge between GluA(\u22127) and ArgB111. This additional interaction might favor the dimerization mode seen in the Sutton et al. structure. However, the structure published by Egloff et al. 25 for SARS-CoV Nsp9 was derived from a protein that carried only six additional histidine residues at its N terminus (B. Canard, personal communication). These residues were not seen in the electron density maps, presumably due to disorder, and certainly are not involved in intersubunit interactions. Yet, this structure still features a mode of dimerization that is highly similar to that described by Sutton et al. 23 and completely different from that observed by us for HCoV-229E Nsp9.",

            "text": "Disulfide bonds are rare in proteins in the cytosol, where the environment is of reducing character, and we therefore have to discuss the possibility that the dimerization mode seen in our structure of HCoV-229E Nsp9 is an artifact of disulfide bond formation, in spite of the presence of 5 mM DTT throughout protein preparation and crystallization (higher concentrations of DTT prevented crystallization of the protein). In order to assess the role of the disulfide bond in dimer formation, we replaced Cys69 in HCoV-229E Nsp9 by alanine. The structure of the mutated protein (Fig. 2c ) revealed a dimer that is grossly different from that of wild-type HCoV-229E Nsp9: When superimposing monomer A of the mutant structure onto the same monomer of the wildtype protein, the centroid of monomer B deviates from its position in the wild-type protein by 23.5 \u00c5, and the angle of rotation between the two positions of monomer B is 72\u00b0. However, this dimerization mode is identical with that of SARS-CoV Nsp9 (cf. Fig. 2c and Supplementary Data Fig. S5 ). The dimer of the HCoV-229E Cys69Ala mutant can be superimposed onto the dimer of the SARS-CoV Nsp9 protein (1QZ8 25 ) with an r.m.s. deviation of 0.99 \u00c5 for 175 C \u03b1 atom pairs (see Supplementary Data Fig. S5 ). The r.m.s. deviation is much higher (2.7 \u00c5 for 191 C \u03b1 atom pairs) for the SARS-CoV Nsp9 structure described by Sutton et al. 23 (1UW7); this is very likely due to the disturbances of the latter structure by the N-terminal tag residues. In the HCoV-229E Nsp9 mutant, dimerization appears to rely on a few interactions only. There is no single proper hydrogen bond between the two monomers, and only a few hydrophobic contacts mediate the interaction (Fig. 2d) . The immediate N terminus is disordered, but residues 3-6 and 5-7 of the A and B chain, respectively, lie over the other monomer and interact weakly with conserved Phe71 (strand \u03b26) and with the C-terminal \u03b1-helix near residues Leu99 and Gly103. The majority of the interactions between the two monomers is made by the two helices, one from each monomer, that run largely in parallel in this dimer, crossing at an angle of 48\u00b0and a closest approach of 3.96 \u00c5 (C \u03b1 -C \u03b1 ) between Ala97 and Gly100 (Fig. 2d ). But again, the hydrophobic contacts between the helices are only weak. Importantly, neither of the two helices deviates from its ideal geometry, including the intrahelical hydrogen bonds, for the benefit of the intermolecular contacts. The surface area buried upon dimer formation 32 is 687 \u00c5 2 for the mutant protein. This value is significantly lower than that observed for the dimerization mode seen for the wild-type HCoV-229E Nsp9 (see above). Even if a few more intermolecular interactions were made by the disordered N-terminal residues not seen in the electron density map (residues 1 and 2 of chain A and 1-4 of chain B), this value would not increase dramatically, and such interactions would very likely not be strong (otherwise these residues would not be disordered). In summary, the monomer-monomer interface of the Cys69Ala mutant of HCoV-229E Nsp9 is far from ideal and appears to be much weaker than the interface seen in the wild-type protein.",

There are multiple interactions between monomers across the hexamer, which we discuss briefly here, according to the color scheme used in the figure. At the center of the hexamer, there are two disordered sulfate ions sitting on the crystallographic threefold axis, 19.0 \u00c5 apart. They make ionic interactions (2.58 \u00c5 from the closest sulfate oxygen) with the Lys50 sidechains (N \u03b6 atom) of the red, green and blue monomers (upper layer of the hexamer) and the yellow, cyan, and magenta monomers (lower layer), respectively. Also, Asp19 of each monomer forms a 2.90 \u00c5 intermolecular hydrogen bond with the Lys50 residue (e.g., red-green), as well as a 4.76 \u00c5 intramolecular salt bridge with Lys50 of the same monomer (e.g., red-red). As a result, we find a ring of ionic interactions formed by Asp19 (loop L12) and Lys50 (L34) residues along both the upper and the lower rim of the central cylinder inside the trimer of dimers (Fig. 3 ). Asp19 is present in most coronavirus Nsp9 sequences (not in SARS-CoV and IBV), whereas Lys50 is highly conserved across the family (see Supplementary Data Fig. 3 ). The cylindrical hole running along the threefold axis is only about 4.4 \u00c5 wide, i.e. large enough for sulfate ions, but too small to accommodate singlestranded nucleic acid at the center of the hexamer (Fig. 3) .",

However, in a more recent preparation of the wild-type protein, reaction with Ellman's reagent immediately after purification of wild-type Nsp9 did indicate the presence of one free cysteine per mole of protein. Crystallization of this sample yielded crystals overnight that were of the same habit as the original crystals obtained for the wild-type protein, with unit cell parameters a = b = 85.4 \u00c5 and c = 48.8 \u00c5 in space group P622. When we investigated this phenomenon further, we observed that the formation of the disulfide bond seemed to depend on the age of the protein preparation. It is possible that in the presence of oxygen, gradual oxidation of the protein (probably correlated with the oxidation of DTT) may lead to formation of the disulfide bond, resulting in the dimerization mode visualized by X-ray crystallography. The concentration of DTT required to reduce the disulfide bond completely was determined as 10 mM by SDS gel electrophoresis (see Materials and Methods). With concentrations of DTT up to 4 mM, the dimer was the dominant species visible on the gel, whereas above, the monomer was more pronounced. The dimer band vanished completely at 10 mM DTT.

As the apparent inability of the Cys69Ala mutant to bind nucleic acids could depend on the lack of a direct (hydrogen bonding) interaction between the cysteine and the oligonucleotides, we also replaced the cysteine by serine. The Cys69Ser mutant did not bind short oligonucleotides either, but did show some gel shift with the 55-mer (Fig. 5c, lane HSM 3 ). Next, we replaced the corresponding cysteine in SARS-CoV Nsp9 by alanine and serine.

In HCoV-229E Nsp9, dimerization is mediated by a disulfide bridge, a few hydrogen bonds, and by hydrophobic interactions between the C-terminal helix of each monomer. One major difference between our preparation of HCoV-229E Nsp9 and that of SARS-CoV Nsp9 by both Egloff et al. 25 and Sutton et al. 23 is that we have worked with a protein with authentic chain termini, whereas the SARS-CoV protein used by those authors has N-terminal extensions from the cloning procedure (a His 6 The occurrence of a disulfide bond in a viral protein located in the cytoplasm of the infected cell is unexpected, because here the overall milieu is reductive and disulfide bonds are rare, although a few cytosolic proteins containing them have been described. 35, 36 Therefore, we have to take into account the possibility that formation of the disulfide is an artifact of the conditions of protein preparation. In order to probe the effect of the disulfide bridge, Cys69 of HCoV-229E Nsp9 was mutated to alanine.

M3 is formed by the \u03b26-\u03b27 hairpin and involves mainly hydrophobic interactions between side-chains that are not conserved (Supplementary Data Table S1 ), although we note that a similar interface exists in the Egloff et al. 25 structure of SARS-CoV Nsp9. The other interface, M2, arises through some limited interaction between strands \u03b25 of neighboring molecules in the crystal. M2 has four hydrogen bonds between main-chain atoms and is reminiscent of intersubunit interactions involving \u03b2-strands in the ssDNAbinding protein (SSB) from Escherichia coli, a prototype OB-fold protein. 28 This same alternative dimerization mode was discussed by Sutton et al. 23 for their structure of the SARS-CoV Nsp9, but was considered irrelevant. However, this interface is found also in the SARS-CoV Nsp9 structure described by Egloff et al. 25 even though the space group of these crystals is different. In summary, both dimerization modes M1 and M2 occur in all crystal structures of Nsp9 described so far (except that of the HCoV-229E wild-type protein), even in a second crystal form mentioned briefly by Sutton et al. 23 (for which no data have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank), i.e. in a total of four different crystalline environments. We therefore propose that Nsp9 oligomerization, in particular in the presence of ssRNA, is mediated through these two proteinprotein interaction surfaces. The existence of such oligomers in solution is supported by our glutaraldehyde crosslinking experiments, which revealed the presence of monomers, dimers, trimers, and higher oligomers for wild-type SARS-CoV Nsp9 and HCoV-229E Cys69Ala Nsp9 in SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions (Fig. 4) . Interestingly, for the wild-type 229E protein, only monomers, dimers, and, to a limited extent, trimers were seen by this method. This is consistent with the observed crystal structures: when in the disulfide-linked state, wildtype 229E Nsp9 cannot normally form oligomers larger than hexamers (Fig. 3) , whereas the Cys69Ala mutant as well as SARS-CoV Nsp9 can form polymers (Fig. 7) .",

In this crystal structure, three sulfate ions are located near one of the two monomers, two of them in the vicinity of the completely conserved lysine residues 50 (52; we use the HCoV-229E numbering scheme here, with numbers for SARS-CoV in parentheses) and 88(92), and one interacting with residue 46(48; Lys46 in 229E, His48 in SARS-CoV). By superimposition with the structure of the wild-type HCoV-229E Nsp9, which was crystallized from sulfate, two further sulfate-binding sites are revealed. One is also near Lys50(52), but in a different position, and the other interacts with Lys82(86). The resulting five independent sulfate positions were used to define a path for ssRNA on the surface of the monomer and, subsequently, the polymer. We also note that the residues that we propose to interact with the ssRNA on the basis of this model (Lys10, Lys50, Tyr51, Arg70, Tyr83, Lys88, and Arg107) are better conserved, on average, than the polypeptide sequence. In our crude model, the ssRNA forms a left-handed helix wrapping around the Nsp9 polymer, similar to the model proposed recently for the nucleocapsid protein of SARS-CoV interacting with ssRNA. 41 In Fig. 7 . Oligomers of SARS-CoV Nsp9 (PDB codes 1QZ8 (a) and 1UW7 (b)) and the HCoV-229E Nsp9 Cys69Ala mutant (c). Independent of space group symmetry (1QZ8, P6 1 22; 1UW7, P4 3 22; and HCoV-229E Nsp9 Cys69Ala mutant, P2 1 2 1 2 1 ), two common dimer interfaces are present in these crystal structures of Nsp9. One interface is formed mainly by the Cterminal \u03b1-helix (red), and the other by strand \u03b25 (blue). We propose that the ssRNA (black) could wrap around the Nsp9 polymer by forming a left-handed helix (a), with approximately 40 nucleotides bound per Nsp9 dimer. our model, approximately 40 nucleotides can be bound per Nsp9 dimer within the extended polymer that we propose for SARS-CoV Nsp9 (Fig. 7a) .",

In agreement with the structural data discussed above, surface-exposed positively charged residues could interact with the sugar-phosphate backbone of the nucleic acid. However, there is a strong correlation between the length of the oligonucleotide and the gel mobility-shift observed ( Fig. 5a and b) . Although the dimerization modes of HCoV-229E and SARS-CoV Nsp9 wild-type proteins are very different, their binding profile to nucleic acid in the gel mobility-shift experiment is similar (neglecting the stepwise rather than linear increase of the gel shift with oligonucleotide lengths in case of the SARS-CoV protein). On the other hand, the HCoV-229E Cys69Ala mutant has a dimerization mode similar to that of the wild-type SARS-CoV Nsp9 but it does not show binding with the nucleic acid in the gel mobility-shift experiment (except for the small shift seen for the 55-mer, the longest oligonucleotide tested). This inability to bind oligonucleotides could, in principle, be due to a direct interaction of the Cys69 with the nucleic acid. Therefore, we prepared an additional three mutants; namely, HCoV-229E Cys69Ser and the corresponding mutants of SARS-CoV Nsp9, Cys73Ala and Cys73Ser. Similar to HCoV-229E Cys69Ala, the Cys69Ser mutant did not exhibit a significant shift in the ZIGE experiment. However, the homologous SARS-CoV Cys73Ala and Cys73Ser mutants did show a shift of the same magnitude as the SARS-CoV Nsp9 wild-type (Fig. 5c) . It remains to be understood why the HCoV-229E Cys69Ala and Cys69Ser mutants apparently do not bind nucleic acids, whereas the corresponding SARS-CoV mutants do.",

An \"aged\" preparation (two weeks old) of wild-type HCoV-229E Nsp9 showed a strong signal for the binding with a 50mer oligonucleotide under non-reducing conditions. Freshly prepared wild-type HCoV-229E Nsp9 gave a much weaker binding signal under reducing conditions. In the case of the HCoV-229E Nsp9 Cys69Ala mutant, the signal was equally small, irrespective of whether DTT was present. These relatively weak signals still indicate significant binding to the 50-mer, albeit much weaker than that found for the wild-type HCoV-229E protein in its oxidized state. This is in agreement with the gel mobility-shifts, where we had observed a weak shift for the HCoV-229E mutants in the case of the longest oligonucleotide examined (the 55-mer), but not with shorter oligonucleotides.",

The chemical environment of the cysteine residues are the same in the two structures, i.e. there is no special structural feature in HCoV-229E Nsp9 that would cause a particular reactivity of Cys69. However, in contrast to HCoV-229E, the SARS-CoV protein has two additional cysteine residues at positions 14 and 23. All three cysteines are in the free form, as we could determine using Ellman's reagent (data not shown). If one of these cysteines was involved in an intermolecular disulfide bond, the latter would probably be reduced by the remaining ones, so that a disulfide-bonded dimer would be unlikely to be the dominant species. In agreement with this argument, there are few proteins that contain a disulfide bond in addition to a free cysteine. 42 (An exception is the cysteine proteases of the papain family, where the active-site cysteine has special properties, such as an unusual pK a value).",

Apparently, there is a correlation between the age of the sample and disulfide formation, even though the reducing agent (5 mM DTT) was added at regular intervals. It is known that DTT is subject to oxidation itself; its half-life at 20\u00b0C is 10 h and 40 h at pH 7.5 and 6.5, respectively. 43 We determined the concentration of DTT required to fully reduce the Nsp9 disulfide as 10 mM; however, the protein would not crystallize at this concentration.",

            "text": "As the disulfide-bonded form of HCoV-229E Nsp9 binds oligonucleotides with much higher affinity than the reduced form, we believe that it may indeed have a biological role, possibly in response to the oxidative stress induced by the viral infection of the host cell. There are several earlier reports suggesting the regulation of DNA/RNA-binding proteins by redox processes. Thus, the redox state has been shown to determine the interaction with DNA of the multifunctional eukaryotic SSB protein, RPA. 44 Also, many transcription factors including Fos, Jun, NF-\u03baB, PaX, FNR, OxyR are regulated by the redox state of the environment. 45 Another example is the p53 tumor suppressor protein, which binds to DNA with sequence specificity only in the reduced state. Disulfide formation in the oxidized state alters the conformation and the protein binds DNA without any sequence specificity. 36 Several viruses have been reported to induce oxidative stress in the infected cell. Among the coronavirus family, TGEV was shown to induce apoptosis in the infected cell via oxidative stress. 46 Similarly, rhinovirus 47 and baculovirus 48 induce oxidative stress in the infected cell. More specifically, LEF3 (the SSB of baculovirus) shows a DNAannealing effect in its oxidized state, whereas in the reduced state, its DNA-unwinding activity is favored. Cys214 is apparently involved in DNA binding; when mutated to serine, both DNA-binding and unwinding activities are reduced. 49 It has been hypothesized that this cysteine could form an intermolecular disulfide bridge and thus results in LEF3 oligomers in solution. This could allow more DNA to bind in closer proximity, thus favoring the annealing effect. 49 The E2 protein of bovine papilloma virus type 1 and ICP8 of herpes simplex virus type 1 also show DNA-binding activity depending on the redox state of the environment. [50] [51] [52] [53] What is the relevance of these in vitro studies to the situation in the infected host cell? For several RNA viruses, including mouse hepatitis (corona)virus (MHV) and SARS-CoV, it has been shown that viral replication is localized to double-membrane vesicles that have been hijacked from the endoplasmic reticulum or late endosomes. [54] [55] [56] [57] These doublemembrane vesicles are 200-350 nm in diameter and present in the cytosol alone or as clusters. 55 The milieu inside these vesicles or at their surface is unknown, but it is quite possible that it is partially oxidative. Since it is here that replicase proteins are produced at high levels, it is conceivable that the oxidized form of HCoV-229E Nsp9 is the dominant species. According to our findings, this form binds to ssRNA more tightly than does the reduced form, and could therefore promote replication of the viral genome. This speculation is supported by the recent report by Wu et al. 58 who have shown that oxidative stress in the host cell promotes HCoV-229E infectivity. Very likely, SARS-CoV will also induce oxidative stress in the infected host cell, 59 even though its Nsp9 does not seem to form disulfide-linked dimers, at least not in vitro. The replicase of this virus may have other mechanisms to deal with an oxidative environment. We note that the number of cysteine residues is above average in coronavirus replicase proteins; in SARS-CoV, their share is 3.9% (HCoV 229E, 3.3%), whereas only 1.25% of residues in human cytosolic proteins are cysteine. 60 In the SARS-CoV main proteinase (M pro ) alone, there are 12 cysteine residues (3.9% of all residues), whereas this number is 8 (2.6%) in HCoV-229E M pro . Some of these could perhaps scavenge oxygen radicals, thereby undergoing oxidation to sulfenic, sulfinic, or even sulfonic acid.",

The HCoV-229E nsp9 PCR product was cloned into the pET15b vector, resulting in pETHCoV-229E/nsp9, which contained the full-length gene (coding for pp1a residues 3825-3933) with an N-terminal extension (MHHHHHHVKLQ), including a His 6 tag for protein purification and a SARS-CoV main proteinase (M pro ) cleavage site (VKLQ \u2193 NNE\u2026) for tag removal. The same approach was chosen for SARS-CoV Nsp9, pp1a residues 4118-4230, resulting in construct pETSARS-CoV/nsp9. Four mutants were prepared using single-site mutagenesis. The corresponding codon of the amino acid to be mutated was encoded in the primer. The pETHCoV-229E/ nsp9 or pETSARS-CoV/nsp9 plasmids were used as template in the PCR reaction. The PCR product corresponding to a size of \u223c6.05 kb was purified and the template was removed using the restriction enzyme DpnI. The restricted product was transformed into E. coli XL1blue supercompetent cells. The correctness of the mutations (Cys69\u2192Ala and Cys69\u2192Ser for HCoV 229E, and Cys73\u2192Ala, Cys73\u2192Ser for SARS-CoV) was confirmed by DNA sequencing.",

Cultures were grown in TY medium at 37\u00b0C until cells reached an absorbance of 0.4 at 660 nm. Cells were then induced with 1 mM IPTG and grown for a further 4 h at 37\u00b0C. The cells were then harvested by centrifugation at 7200g for 30 min at 4\u00b0C. The resulting pellets were frozen at \u221220\u00b0C.

Cells were broken by French press after adding glycerol to 10% (v/v) and one Complete EDTA-free protease inhibitor cocktail tablet (Roche Diagnostics, Mannheim, Germany). To optimize the solubility of overproduced Nsp9, a sparse-matrix screen of buffer composition was applied. 61 The sample was centrifuged at 150,000g for 1 h at 4\u00b0C.

Initial hits were optimized by manually setting up 2 \u03bcl hanging drops consisting of 1 \u03bcl of protein solution and 1 \u03bcl of reservoir solution. Both wild-type and mutant protein crystals appeared within two days at 10\u00b0C and a protein concentration of 6-8 mg/ml, in 20 mM Tris, 200 mM NaCl, 1 mM DTT, pH 7.5. The most useful precipitants were ammonium sulfate at pH 4.0-4.5 for wild-type Nsp9, and polyethylene glycol monomethyl ether 2000 (pH 4.6) for the mutant (see Results for optimized conditions). X-ray diffraction data were collected at 100 K using synchrotron radiation of wavelength 0.8075 \u00c5, provided by the University of Hamburg-University of L\u00fcbeck -EMBL beamline X13 at Deutsches Elektronen-Synchrotron (DESY), Hamburg. The cryoprotectant was 25% glycerol for the wild-type protein and 25% polyethylene glycol 400 for the mutant. Data were processed with DENZO 62 and scaled using SCALA. 63 The structures were solved by using the molecular replacement program Phaser, 64 with a monomer of SARS coronavirus Nsp9 (1QZ8) as the search model. The initial solutions had R-factors of 51.0% (wild-type) and 50.8% (mutant). Models were built into electron density using COOT, 65 and refined by REFMAC5. 66 The final model for wild-type HCoV-229E Nsp9 includes 70 water molecules, two sulfate ion sites, and one MPD molecule. The structural model for the mutant contains 90 water molecules and one DTT molecule. The final steps of refinement of the mutant structure incorporated TLS refinement with residues 4 -109 of monomer A as one group and residues 6 -106 of monomer B as the second group. The overall geometric quality of the models was checked using PROCHECK. 26 The surface area buried upon dimerization was calculated using AREAIMOL. 32 Structure superimposition and calculation of r.m.s. deviations were carried out using ALIGN. 67 The figures were created using PyMOL. 68",

HCoV-229E Nsp9 and SARS-CoV Nsp9 have a theoretical pI of 9.3 and 9.1, respectively; thus, the protein is positively charged at the pH of the running buffer (8.3), whereas the nucleic acids are negatively charged and will move towards the opposite pole during electrophoresis. Therefore, only the oligonucleotides (100 \u03bcM) were loaded into the sample slots and run for 40 min at 100 mA and 4\u00b0C. Subsequently, 50 \u03bcM protein was loaded into the respective lanes and the run was continued for another 40 min, with the poles of the electrodes interchanged. With this design of the experiment, the protein and the nucleic acid run in opposite directions and meet in the middle of the agarose gel. If there is interaction between the two, the protein will move in the same direction as the nucleic acid, whereas if there is no interaction, the protein will simply pass the nucleic acid. Gel mobility-shift assays were performed using a horizontal 1% agarose gel system at pH 8.3 in TBE buffer (20 mM Tris, 50 mM boric acid, 0.1 mM NaEDTA, pH 8.3 (25\u00b0C) adjusted by the addition of acetic acid).

After electrophoresis, the gel was fixed in 3.5% (w/v) \u03b1sulfosalicilic acid, 10% (w/v) trichloroacetic acid, until the dye turned yellow. At this stage, zones with higher concentrations of ligands such as oligonucleotide can be seen as a whitish area. For the detection of protein bands, the gel was washed for 15 min in 15% (v/v) ethanol, 8% (v/v) acetic acid, and stained for 30 min with 0.25% (w/v) Coomassie brilliant blue in the same solution with additional 10% (v/v) methanol.

Wild-type HCoV-229E Nsp9 displays a linear increase of the shift with increasing length of ssDNA, whereas the increase is step-wise for SARS-CoV Nsp9.

The HCoV-229E Nsp9 Cys69Ala mutant (HAM) and the Cys69Ser mutant (HSM) do not show any shift with the 24-mer (lane 2) and only a small shift with the 55-mer (lane 3), whereas the SARS-CoV Nsp9 Cys73Ala mutant (SAM) and the Cys73Ser mutant (SSM) exhibit shifts with the 55-mer oligonucleotide that are similar to wild-type SARS-CoV Nsp9.

Interestingly, the differences of the N-terminal extensions between the two reported structures of SARS-CoV Nsp9 led to deviations in the dimer in detail, resulting in a rather high r.m.s. deviation of 2.07 \u00c5 (for C \u03b1 atoms) between the two models. Residues \u22127 to \u22122 of the N-terminal tag present in the Sutton et al. structure form an extra antiparallel \u03b2-sheet with residues 3-8 of the protein, thereby pushing away the \u03b26-\u03b27 hairpin (L67; Supplementary Data Fig. S5) and causing the Cterminal part of the \u03b1-helix to kink. Regardless of whether the presence of the extra residues at the N terminus of the SARS-CoV Nsp9 preparations used for structure determination results in artifacts, the observation of a completely different, disulfidelinked dimer in HCoV-229E Nsp9 is remarkable.",
