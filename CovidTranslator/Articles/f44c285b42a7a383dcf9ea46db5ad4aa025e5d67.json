The overall objectives of the project are to incorporate the concept of overall-process management in life cycle of medical waste into medical waste management and disposal of China, facilitate BAT/BEP application and promotion, improve China's abilities of medical waste management and disposal, promote reduction of medical waste and realize the target of harmlessness, by introducing the advanced experiences in medical waste management and disposal from foreign countries. Currently, most of the activities in demonstration stage have already been completed, and it is expected to reach the dioxin concentration of 0.1 ngTEQ/m 3 in flue gas of 15 incineration (including pyrolysis) facilities. Hence, the project decides to implement the incentive plan among eligible medical waste incineration facilities in China. In this plan, a process with steps as application, review, examination, technical transformation, verification and award was designed. To standardize and externalize the process, an entire package of files including principles, guidelines, quota and criteria, table and checklist templates were developed, considering all the involved stakeholders. As a result, with active involvements and contribution of the MEP, local governments, enterprises, experts and monitoring instructions, the incentive plan vigorously guided and promoted BAT/BEP replication and application for medical waste disposal, avoided and reduced the generation and emission of dioxin POPs and other toxic substances. Currently, there are 8 incinerators which realized the aim of controlling their dioxins emission under limited concentration of 0.1ng TEQ/m 3 in the flue gas.",

Similar with the practice in many other developing countries, the NPHMW envisaged adopting incineration as the technology of choice for most of these facilities at first. Under the influence of BAT/BEP concept, nearly half of the facilities which are almost minor ones turned to choose the non-incinerations technologies, such as autoclave, microwave and chemical disinfections, which are alternative and supplementary to incinerations and could avoid emissions of PCDD/Fs and other UP-POPs. However, there are still about half facilities using incineration like rotary kiln and pyrolysis (continuous or by-batch feeding).",

Integrating with the implementation of NPHMW, this project was to promote the adoption of BAT/BEP in MW disposal and treatment sector, ultimately reducing environment pollution and protecting human health. There have been three incineration facilities (each stands for a representative incineration type) selected for BAT/BEP demonstration, aiming to reduce PCDD/Fs release (in flue gas) down to 0.1ngTEQ/m 3 , by means of engineered and managing methods. To further promote BAT/BEP for MW incineration in China, the project designed and kicked off an incentive plan 3 for centralized incinerators to compensate for up to 15 facilities to decrease their PCDD/Fs release limitation in the flue gas from 0.5ngTEQ/m 3 to 0.1ngTEQ/m 3 . The successful implementation of the incentive plan will substantially promote the revision of Pollution Control Standard 4 for Hazardous Wastes Incineration (GB18484-2001) in which the PCDD/Fs release limitation in the flue gas will be decreased from 0.5ngTEQ/m 3 to 0.1ngTEQ/m 3 , and furthermore promote the replication of BAT/BEP nationwide. In this abstract, the mechanism and framework of the incentive plan will be laid out and discussed.",

By the end of 2014, there were 15 incinerators of 13 enterprises passed the examinations and won the qualification to pursue for the incentive fund (see Fig. 2 ). Until the end of May 2015, there are 8 incinerators passed the verification of the incentive plan. In consideration of possible failure and quit of some incinerators, it is necessary to prepare for the successive activities. The following plans are suggested: 1. Make a complementary recruit. If the qualified incinerators exceed the gap, the incentive fund will be awarded with the method of first come first served. 2. Encourage replacement of incinerators with non-incineration technologies.",
