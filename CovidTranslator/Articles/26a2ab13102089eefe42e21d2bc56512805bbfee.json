The selected acute phase proteins were fibrinogen, haptoglobin, serum amyloid-A, lipopolysaccharide binding protein and a1-acid glycoprotein. From each calf, a paired blood sample was obtained for serological studies of bovine parainfluenza virus-3, bovine respiratory syncytial virus, bovine coronavirus, bovine adenovirus-3 and bovine adenovirus-7. Tracheobronchial lavage was performed to detect bacteria and mycoplasma. Isolation of Pasteurella multocida was associated with increased concentrations of all tested acute phase proteins.

One of its main features is hepatic production of acute phase proteins (APPs) [1] . APPs are a large, heterogeneous group of proteins with a wide range of biological activities. Many of their functions in host defence during inflammation are not fully understood. Measuring concentrations of different APPs in plasma can give us valuable information on the APR and the course of disease. The roles and profiles of different APPs differ from each other, and thus, measuring several APPs can provide a more comprehensive picture of APR in individual animals. Many experimental studies of APPs in cattle have been carried out in recent years (e.g. [2] [3] [4] ). Some of these describe changes in the concentrations of APPs as disease markers in bovine clinical respiratory diseases of feedlot calves [5] [6] [7] [8] , or in experimental respiratory infection models [9] [10] [11] . Bovine respiratory disease (BRD) is a multifactorial disease of cattle that involve many pathogens and APPs may be used to explore impact of different etiological or other factors to this disease complex. To our knowledge, no studies on relationships of different APPs to naturally occurring respiratory pathogens in calves have been conducted.",

Any coughing was noted during the clinical examination, and calves were examined for diarrhoea. According to pre-set criteria, abnormal sounds on auscultation of the respiratory tract, 5 calves/herd, for a total of 90 calves, were chosen for tracheobronchial lavage. In addition all the chosen calves had at least one of the following symptoms: increased respiratory rate (440/min), rectal temperature 439.5 1C, cough or nasal discharge. For several reasons 6 of the calves had to be left out from the survey, so 84 calves were taken into the research.",

Our most significant result was the relationship between presence of P. multocida and both clinical signs and increased concentrations of APPs. This indicates a strong pathogenic role for P. multocida in respiratory disease of calves in Finland, at least in situations where other known pathogens, e.g. M. haemolytica, M. bovis and BRSV, are absent. Our results agree with experimental studies on calves in which P. multocida has been reported to cause general symptoms, as well as increased concentrations of the APPs Hp, SAA and AGP [10] . Increases in the concentrations of AGP have been reported to be more gradual and to remain elevated for longer than those observed for SAA or Hp.

Although these viruses seemed not to cause APR directly or clear clinical signs, they may still have some role as predisposing factors for bacterial invasion. The negative association between seroconversion to BAV-7 and crackling respiratory sounds is difficult to explain and may be coincidental. All calves participating in this study were approximately 3 months old. The reliability of antibody determinations based Table 1 Serum or blood concentrations, mean (7SE; P-value), of fibrinogen (FIB; g/l), haptoglobin (Hp; g/l), serum amyloid A (SAA; mg/l), a1-acid glycoprotein (AGP; mg/l), lipopolysaccharide binding protein (LBP; mg/l) and white blood cells (WBC; \u00c2 10 9 /l) in calves with respiratory disease, with and without Pasteurella multocida in tracheobronchial lavage fluid on IgG from serum of calves less than 3 months of age is questionable because of maternal antibodies, which might interfere with seroconversion [24, 25] . The results concerning viral seroconversions should thus be interpreted with caution. Despite Mycoplasma sp. and M. dispar being isolated in all herds and in over 90% of calves, no association between these mycoplasmas and clinical signs was observed, in agreement with earlier findings [26, 27] .

            "text": "Studies on use of different APPs as markers of naturally occurring respiratory disease are somewhat controversial. Hp has been reported to be useful in detecting calves with respiratory disease requiring treatment and in monitoring the efficacy of treatment [5, 29, 30] . Other researchers have found Hp to have only limited capacity as a clinical tool in the diagnostics of respiratory disease in feedlot cattle [7, 8] . Although SAA [14] and LBP [15] have been shown to be more sensitive APPs than Hp, some studies have concluded that SAA is not useful marker of respiratory disease in field conditions [5, 29] . Serum SAA concentrations have been reported to be influenced by physical stress [2] , which may partially explain its variable behaviour. In our study, establishing the ranking of different APPs as markers of respiratory disease in calves was difficult because associations existed between all APPs and P. multocida (Table 1) . Nevertheless, the associations between P. multocida and LBP and fibrinogen seemed to be slightly stronger than between the other APPs measured. However, this may be due to several confusing reasons such as peak concentrations of different APPs occurring at different stages of the infection and/or other pathogens or inductors causing variable responses of different APPs. Fibrinogen has long been in routine use, and proved to be a useful, easy and inexpensive test for confirming the presence of an infection. WBC count, by contrast, did not correlate well with the type of BRD, and thus, was not useful for clinical purposes in this situation.",
