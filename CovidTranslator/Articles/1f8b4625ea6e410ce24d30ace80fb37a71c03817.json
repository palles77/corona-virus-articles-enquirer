One hundred sixty-two isolates were collected from different countries, including Canada, the Czech Republic, Finland, Italy, Montenegro, Serbia, Spain, Switzerland, Turkey and the United States. A unique species of G. abietina RNA viruseMS1 (GaRV-MS1) appears to occur indistinctly in G. abietina biotypes A and B, without a particular geographical distribution pattern. Forty-six isolates were shown to host GaRV-MS1 according to direct specific RT-PCR screening, and the virus was more common in biotype A than B. Phylogenetic analysis based on 46 partial coat protein (CP) cDNA sequences divided the GaRV-MS1 population into two closely related clades, while RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) sequences revealed only one clade. The evolution of the virus appears to mainly occur through purifying selection but also through recombination. Recombination events were detected within alignments of the three complete CP and RdRp sequences of GaRV-MS1. This is the first time that recombination events have been directly identified in fungal partitiviruses and in G. abietina in particular. The results suggest that the population dynamics of GaRV-MS1 do not have a direct impact on the genetic structure of its host, G. abietina, though they might have had an innocuous ancestral relationship.",

            "text": "The European race of Gremmeniella abietina (Lagerberg) Morelet (anamorph Brunchorstia pinea) is the causal agent of stem canker and shoot blight in many conifer species in Europe and North America (Donaubauer 1972) . It leads to epidemics depending on annual weather conditions (Uotila 1988) . The most recent serious outbreak of G. abietina took place in Sweden in 2001 (Wulff & Walheim 2003) , when more than 50 000 ha of pine forest were severely affected. The up-todate taxonomy of this species comprises three biotypes. Biotype B, or the Small Tree type (STT), is primarily found in northern European countries, but it appears to also be present in high mountainous areas of the Lake District of Turkey (Botella et al. 2012a,b; Dogmus-Lehtijarvi et al. 2012) . The Alpine biotype has been described in the Alpine region. These biotypes both grow in harsh conditions of snow and extreme temperatures and produce abundant pycnidia (4e8 celled) and apothecia in the field (Hellgren & H\u20ac ogberg 1995) . The third currently known biotype is the biotype A, or the Large Tree Type (LTT). It is the most pathogenic biotype and shows the widest distribution, ranging from the Italian Apennines to northern Sweden and North America, where it was introduced in the 1970s and designated the European race (EU) (Skilling et al. 1977) . Conversely, it produces apothecia only rarely in forests (Uotila 1992; Kaitera & Jalkanen 1996) , and its conidia are 4 celled. Population genetic studies performed through analyses of SCAR markers have consistently found highly similar alleles in the B and Alpine biotypes (Botella et al. 2010) , while Biotype A displays fixed nucleotide differences from the other two (Botella et al. 2010) . Biotype A exhibits low overall genetic variability (Hamelin et al. 1996) , with the exception of the Spanish population, which is a clonal population in a warmer location, likely as a consequence of a founder effect (Santamaria et al. 2005; Botella et al. 2010) . Artificial pairings between the A and B biotypes revealed low rates of successful germination and growth, and accordingly, no viable hybrids have been found in nature (Uotila et al. 2000) , indicating that these biotypes should be separated into two different species (Uotila et al. 2000 , Uotila & Hantula 2012 . Tuomivirta et al. 2002 described the occurrence of two independent double-stranded (ds) RNA banding patterns in a single G. abietina biotype A isolate, which were later shown to represent putative members of the families Totiviriridae and Partitiviridae (Tuomivirta & Hantula 2003a; Tuomivirta & Hantula 2005) . Only biotype B appears to harbour a taxonomically unassigned species with certain endornavirus-like characteristics , and both biotypes A and B host mitoviruses (Tuomivirta & Hantula 2003b; Botella et al. 2012b) . Mitovirus-infected isolates appear to present greater mycelial growth than mitovirus-free isolates at the optimal growing temperature for G. abietina of 15 C (Romeralo et al. 2012) . The viral communities appear to be separated into biotypes A and B (Hantula & Tuomivirta 2003) , except in Spain, where two species of mitoviruses occur in the genetically unique population, which was most likely derived from biotype A.",

The family Partitiviridae includes dsRNA viruses with bisegmented genomes, which encode separately encapsidated RdRP and CP segments as well as satellite RNA molecules. Partitiviruses infect fungal, plant, and protozoan hosts. The classification of partitiviruses has been recently revised, and they now comprise five families: Alphapartitivirus, Betapartitivirus, Cryspoviruses, Deltapartitivirus, and Gammapartitivirus. The genera Alphapartitivirus and Betapartitivirus include viruses hosted by fungi or plants, while the genera Gammapartitivirus and Cryspovirus comprise only mycoviruses (Nibert et al. 2014) .",

However, a number of studies have demonstrated the capacity of partitiviruses to be transferred through somatically incompatible fungi under laboratory conditions (Ihrmark et al. 2002; Vainio et al. 2010 Vainio et al. , 2011 Vainio et al. , 2012a and in nature (Vainio et al. 2012b) . Fungal and plant partitiviruses appear to show many similarities in their virion structure and close evolutionary relationships. Despite the lack of information about plant partitiviruses, a recent study based on RdRp amino acid sequences suggested that horizontal transfer of partitiviruses has occurred during the evolutionary history of fungi and plants (Gabrial et al. 2008) .",

The largest segment showed a length of 1781 bp and a relatively high GC content (49.7 %). It exhibited a unique open reading frame (ORF) of 1620 bp, from position 63 to 1682.

The second longest segment presented a length of 1586 bp and a moderately higher GC content (50.9 %). There was only one ORF of 1332 bp identified, from position 100 to 1431 (Fig 1) , which encodes the coat protein (CP). The length of the 5 0 UTR was 100 bp, while that of the 3 0 UTR was 155 bp.

            "text": "Most mycoviruses are 'cryptoviruses' (Tavantzis 2010) ; that is, they do not produce phenotypic changes in their fungal hosts (Ghabrial 1998) . However, some mycoviruses, such as Cryphonectria hypovirus 1 (CHV-1), display parasite-like traits, such as hypovirulence (Milgoom & Cortesi 2004) , and have typically evolved with their hosts (Bryner et al. 2012) . Other mycoviruses, such as Ustilago maydis virus H1, are involved in symbiotic interactions, which strongly affect the evolutionary dynamics and community structure of both symbiotic partners (Voth et al. 2006) . One of the basic relevant questions in evolutionary biology is the degree to which the diversification of parasites and/or symbionts is associated with the diversification of their hosts (G\u20ac oker et al. 2011) . In this sense, the diversification of the European race of Gremmeniella abietina into different biotypes, and possible species (Uotila et al. 2000 , Uotila & Hantula 2012 , is mostly the outcome of geographical separation and ecological adaptation. However, the virus communities of these fungi could provide some insights about their history of dispersion. According to our results, only one species of Gammapartitivirus (Nibert et al. 2014) appears to occur in the European race of G. abietina (GaRV-MS1), and no host specialisation was observed. The NJ phylogenetic tree based on partial CP sequences showed two very close clades of GaRV-MS1 strains, and the nucleotide variability of the entire population was quite low (0.034). The RdRp alignment exhibited even lower variability. Highly similar strains appeared indistinctly in different countries and in both biotypes A and B (Fig 2) . The absence of codivergence between GaRV-MS1 and its host, G. abietina, might be due to an apparent lack of either negative (parasitic) or positive (symbiotic) effects. Although a possible effect cannot be totally ruled out, Tuomivirta et al. (2002) did not observe major differences between dsRNA-containing (partitivirus-like patterns) and dsRNA-free isolates. Thus, GaRV-MS1 would not be acting as an evolutionary force driving the species diversification of G. abietina. Nevertheless, combinations of events such as host switching, duplication, and parasite extinction may lead to topological incongruence and divergence (G\u20ac oker et al. 2011) . Virus transmission may have occurred from biotype A to B or vice versa, as hypothesised for Gremmeniella mitovirus 1 (GMV1) and 2 (GMV2) found in the Spanish population (specialised A population) and biotype B (Botella et al. 2012b) . Transmission of partitiviruses between somatically incompatible fungi may also occur in nature (Vainio et al. 2012b) . However, in the case of GaRV-MS1, it is difficult to assess where and when cell-to-cell contact might have taken place. The populations examined in our study are geographically separated, diminishing the possibility of recent transmission.",

            "text": "Because the donor sequences precisely substituted a homologous region of the receptor sequence without altering in its structure (Nuss 2005) , we propose that homologous recombination occurred. RNA recombination events are common among plant ssRNA viruses (Chare 2003; Alabi et al. 2010; Sztuba-Solinska et al. 2011 ) and human and animal dsRNA viruses such as rotaviruses (Suzuki et al. 1998; Phan et al. 2007 ), but there is less evidence of recombination in the dsRNAs of plant (Liu et al. 2012) or fungal viruses (Carbone et al. 2004; Feau et al. 2014; Linder-Basso et al. 2005; Voth et al. 2006) , and this phenomenon is particularly scarce in fungal partitiviruses. Nevertheless, some studies carried out on coronavirus have indicated that recombination might be more common than is often assumed but may go undetected because of the action of strong purifying selection, which will remove new, deleterious combinations of mutations (Banner & Lai 1991) . Hence, in the case of GaRV-MS1, we note that recombination could have taken place under specific conditions, permitting the virus to cross the species border. However, it is not possible to determine when this event occurred. Limited information is available about possible factors enhancing viral recombination in fungi. Nevertheless, the RNA-silencing antiviral defence response has been shown to contribute to hypoviral RNA recombination in Cryphonectria parasitica (Sun et al. 2009 ). The RNA silencing pathway contributes to viral RNA recombination by providing 5 0 and 3 0 fragments of viral RNA (Zhang & Nuss 2008) .",

However, it was relatively high in comparison with other pathogens such as Heterobasidion, where the frequency of partitivirus-infected isolates was shown to be ca. 5 % (Vainio et al. 2011) . The occurrence of GaRV-MS1 varied among the tested populations. Biotype A and the Spanish population in particular presented the highest rates, while biotype B and the Alpine type displayed a lower occurrence of partitiviruses. The same phenomenon was observed in GMV1 and GMV2 (Botella et al. 2012b) , though these findings were most likely enhanced by the lower number of analysed isolates, especially from the Alpine region; nevertheless, a further explanation may be based on their mode of reproduction. Biotype A mainly reproduces via conidiospores, which is a known means of efficient transfer of mycoviruses (Polashock et al. 1997; Buck 1998; Pearson et al. 2009 ), while biotype B and the Alpine type show sexual reproduction more frequently. The percentage of partitivirus-infected sexual and asexual spores can fluctuate greatly within the same species, and it is apparently determined by the combination of fungal host and virus genotypes (Tavantzis 2010) . Furthermore, mycoviruses that flow through septal pores may also be constrained by fungal defence mechanisms (Leslie & Zeller 1996; Cortesi & Milgroom 1998; Nuss 2011 ), such as the genetic self/nonself recognition system or RNA silencing (Nuss 2005) . Evidence of such constraint was recently described after infection by Rosellinia necatrix partitivirus 2 (RnPV2) (Chiba et al. 2013) , although no phenotypic alterations were observed.",
