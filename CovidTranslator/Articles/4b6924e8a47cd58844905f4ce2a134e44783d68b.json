Method: An anonymous computer-assisted telephone interview survey was conducted in Spain in December 2009 and February 2010. Respondents were asked about their perceptions of influenza A (H1N1) virus and the preventive measures adopted. Factors associated with the adoption of preventive measures were assessed by logistic regression analyses. Results: Out of 4892 households approached, 1627 valid responses were obtained (response rate of 33.3%). The most commonly adopted preventive measures were respiratory hygiene and hand washing. Factors independently associated with the adoption of the preventive measures recommended by the Spanish Ministry of Health were female gender, higher educational level, size of municipality of residence N 50,000 inhabitants, high perceived susceptibility to infection, high perceived effectiveness of the measures and high perceived usefulness of the information provided by the government. The presence of school-aged children in household was associated with purchasing masks and hand sanitizer. Conclusion: In addition to demographic factors, modifiable factors such as personal beliefs and expectations play a role in the adoption of preventive measures.",

As expected, there was a decrease of the adoption of preventive measures. In addition, we have found that respiratory hygiene and hand washing were the most frequently preventive measures adopted. These two measures are considered as effective non-pharmaceutical public health interventions against influenza (Aledort et al., 2007) . The high prevalence of both measures is consistent with the government campaign (Spanish Ministry of Health, 2009b). Clearly, 2009 influenza A (H1N1) impacted on healthrelated perceptions and behaviors in terms of self-protection, as approximately 80% of respondents adopted at least one preventive measure. Some of these behaviors persisted among a large proportion of the population after the pandemic peak, although a significant decrease was observed during the declining phase.",

There were also wide regional differences in the prevalence of wearing a face mask, ranking between 22% and 89% in previous Asian studies (Lau et al., 2010a) , again much higher than the proportion we found in Spain (7%). The same pattern was observed for avoidance measures. The proportion of Spanish general population reporting keeping away from crowded places was 4% while in Asian countries it was around 55% (Lau et al., 2010b) . This might be explained by a higher public concern in those countries regarding the threat of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) or the human avian H5N1 virus a few years ago (Tang and Wong, 2003) .",

A recent review (Bish and Michie, 2010) reported similar findings (Cava et al., 2005) . On the other hand, some associated factors observed in the present study (i.e., female sex, higher educational level) are consistent with previous reports (Lau et al., 2010a; Tang and Wong, 2003) . One of the limitations of this study was the use of telephone surveys, which excluded those households without telephone line. While this is a potential selection bias that cannot be ruled out completely, the magnitude is limited since more than 80% of households have a landline in Spain (Spanish National Institute of Statistics, 2010). More important is that we obtained a response rate of 33% which is nevertheless in the range of other published studies (Lau et al., 2010a; Rubin et al., 2009 ). Finally, since cultural factors could result in differences in behavioral responses, caution should be exercised when generalizing our results to other contexts.",
