Replication interference between these two viruses was described using cell cultures (CC) and embryonated chicken eggs (ECE). Chicken embryo lung (CEL) and ECE were simultaneously or sequentially infected with IBV vaccine strain (H120) and LPAIV-H9N2 (A/Ck/TUN/145/2012) to evaluate viral interactionsin vitro and in ovo, respectively. Real-time RT-PCR was developed to specifically quantify both AIV and IBV genomes as well as viral gene copy numbers during mixed infections. The amount of IL-1 beta, in supernatants of co-infected cell cultures, was determined using an ELISA assay. Results: Quantitative results of AIV and IBV co-infection showed that interferences between the two viruses yielded decreased viral growth. However, in the case of super-infection, the second virus, either AIV or IBV, induced a decrease in the growth of the first inoculated virus.",

They affect the respiratory and the reproductive tracts as well as the renal system of chickens, causing respiratory signs, reduction in weight-gain and usually life-long decrease of egg laying performances (Cavanagh, 2003; Liu and Kong, 2004) . Farmers are always facing major problems related to co-infections with major respiratory pathogens, mainly avian influenza H9N2 and avian infectious bronchitis or Newcastle disease viruses (Wafa et al., 2011; Hager et al., 2012; Shengqiang et al., 2012; Fernandez et al., 2014) . Studying the influence of infection by one virus on another virus is important to understand the interactions between respiratory viruses and the impact of the control measures applied such as vaccination. Multiple infections with AIV and IBV were rarely studied. However, none of these studies have quantitatively evaluated the degree of in vitro and in ovo interferences between these two viruses (Seifi et al., 2012) . Owing to the important position of both viruses, it is of theoretical and practical importance to continue discussions about viral interferences by evaluating AIV and IBV replication, using the newly developed multiplex real-time RT-PCR (rRT-PCR) (Nacira and Rim, 2018) .",

The AIV genome has eight linear segments of negative-sense ssRNA. The IBV genome has a non-segmented positive-sense ssRNA. The AIV type A viruses are classified as low pathogenic (LP) and high pathogenic (HP) viruses, based on their virulence for chickens and the presence of multiple basic amino acids at the cleavage site of the hemagglutinin (HA), the precursor protein (Capua and Alexander, 2009; Boursnell et al., 1987) . The receptor of AIV on the cell surface is the N-acetyl neuraminic acid (\u03b12, 3-sialic acid-galactose) (Fernandez et al., 2014) . On the other hand, the Coronaviruses have evolved with various initiation of infection strategies for both the attachment stage and the subsequent membrane fusion. They have even required the presence of defined cell surface proteins for infection; the N-acetyl neuraminic acid (\u03b12,3-sialic acid) being the receptor protein determinant for primary attachment for group 3 Coronavirus to which belongs the IBV (Delmas et al., 1992; Wickramasinghe et al., 2011; Winter et al., 2006) . Alternatively, IBV may bind to only very specific subset of \u03b12,3-sialylated glycans, present only on chicken cell surfaces (Wickramasinghe et al., 2011) .",

Actually, several countries are reporting important losses in poultry farms related to natural viral co-infection, essentially with AIV and IBV (Nacira et al., 2016) . In Tunisia, farmers are continually facing difficulties with effective control of these infections even in presence of recommended vaccination program. In fact, routinely vaccinated animals against IBV could be naturally infected with AIV; similarly, animals vaccinated against AIV could also be naturally infected with IBV. Understanding viral interaction between two viruses is needed to improve vaccination program and control multiple viral infection.",

Thus, it was shown that AIV growth was hindered when IBV was added 4 h and 8 h later. Similar results were also obtained when IBV infection was followed by AIV super infection after 4 h or 8 h later. It is worth noting that higher growth inhibition of either AIV or IBV was observed when the second virus was added 8 h later. Statistical significance of the results between the groups (Indicated on figure) was determined using one way ANOVA test, as follows: **: p < 0.01 (significant increase). Bars represent the standard deviations for Log 10 Gene copy numbers/100 \u03bcl for 7 cases of infection, co infection and super infection experiments (Fig. 8) .",

This result is quite different from other studies, in which they found a reduction in the replication of only one virus in case of simultaneous infection (Shengqiang et al., 2012) . In fact, they have shown a slightly higher rate of replication for one virus and a relatively lower rate for the second virus (Shengqiang et al., 2012) . Theoretically, when AIV and IBV are simultaneously added to cell cultures, it may be expected that interference would happen, probably in relation to direct competition for the same viral receptors on the cell surface (Ge and Wang, 2011) . It has been clearly established that the cell surface receptors for AIV are sialic acid containing glycoconjugates (Ge and Wang, 2011) , whereas the cellular receptors for IBV have been proposed as \u03b12,3-sialylated glycans (Wickramasinghe et al., 2011) , both of which contain sialic acid (Ge and Wang, 2011) . These findings imply the existence of common receptor sites on the permissive host cells that are shared by AIV and IBV (Murphy et al., 1999) . This would raise the possibility that when both viruses are simultaneously inoculated into cultured cells, they can compete for shared virus sialic acid receptors, essential for virus attachment, and viral interference could happen, as it was clearly shown in our study (Fig. 4) .",

Nil and colleagues reported that expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1 beta and IL-6) was higher in IBV infected group than in control group, suggesting that these are involved in IBV progression as they are expressed in response to viral infection, and constituting another mode of resistance of the organism (Nil et al., 2014) . IL-1\u03b2 was reported to be the central cytokine that accompanies inflammation, as it is implicated in promoting pulmonary tissue pathology (Kim et al., 2015) . The ELISA results showed important secretion of IL-1\u03b2 in CEL cells following dual infection, which could explain the interference between AIV and IBV. Results from our experiments showed that infection with one virus induced the secretion of IL-1\u03b2 that reduces the first virus growth, facilitating the infection and the dominance of the second virus during the 24 h p.i. of the mixed infections. This phenomenon associated with the changes in IL-1\u03b2 expression suggested that expression of pro-inflammatory cytokine is related to viral replication as recently reported by Jianlin and colleagues (Jianlin et al., 2016) .
