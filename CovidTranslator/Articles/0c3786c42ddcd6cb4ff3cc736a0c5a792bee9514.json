Their administration has been proposed to treat several viral and immunomediated diseases as an immunomodulatory therapy. Due to its availability, recombinant human interferon-alpha (rHuIFN-\u2423) has been studied in relation to feline retrovirosis, both in vitro and in vivo. However, IFNs are species-specific and antibodies have been shown to develop in response to the high rHuIFN-\u2423 doses necessary for an effective therapy. A recombinant feline IFN has been developed, which has been characterized as interferon-omega (rFeIFN-), designed to overcome these problems. Nonetheless, very few studies have been undertaken to evaluate its efficacy in cats naturally infected with FIV or FeLV. In an initial study, we here demonstrated that rFeIFN-can dramatically improve the clinical condition of infected cats, and induce improvement of hematologic parameters. Minor changes or no change was observed for hypergammaglobulinemia, CD4/CD8 ratio, proviral load, viremia and RT activity, suggesting that the overall effect of IFN was on innate immunity. More studies are needed in order to better understand its in vivo mechanisms.",

In advanced stages of the disease, the immune suppression established may contribute to the death of the animal (review in Hartmann, 2006; Sellon and Hartmann, 2006) . Treatment of animal retroviral diseases is usually based on supportive and symptomatic therapy, such as rehydration when needed, control of secondary infections with antibiotics, antiparasitic and antifungal drugs, among others, while the administration of antiviral drugs is uncommon (Hartmann, 2006; Sellon and Hartmann, 2006; Dunham and Graham, 2008) . Most of the antivirals used for feline retrovirosis are the same as used in human medicine, including AZT (zidovudine), ribavirin, zalcitabine and foscarnet, singularly or in combination. The use of these drugs in cats has several disadvantages: doses and protocols are not well established, and they can be toxic for animals as well as producing secondary effects (Caney, 2005; Hartmann, 2006; Sellon and Hartmann, 2006; Dunham and Graham, 2008) . As these infections are accompanied by a wide array of clinical signs (anemia, gingivitis, anorexia, secondary respiratory infections, tumors, etc.), there is no preferred curative treatment. Thus, a reasonable 0165-2427/$ -see front matter \u00a9 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved. doi:10.1016/j.vetimm.2011.06.008 alternative for treatment is the use of immunomodulators, particularly type-I interferons that have an additional antiviral effect. The aim of the present work was both to review the literature on the possibility of using interferonomega (IFN-) for treating feline retrovirosis, and to describe the results of a preliminary study conducted on 11 cats infected either by FeLV or FIV, observing clinical, biopathological and virological effects.",

Interferons (IFNs) are cytokines with important multiple biological functions. Interferons are classified into type-I and type-II IFNs (Pestka et al., 2004) . Type-I IFNs are produced by virusinfected cells and have non-specific antiviral activity on adjacent non-infected cells. Thus, they are known as \"viral IFNs\" and are associated with innate immunity. These interferons include IFN-\u2423, IFN-\u2424, and IFN-, among others. Each them has a general mechanism of action based on interaction with specific cell surface receptors and the subsequent induction of expression of interferon-stimulated genes (Sen, 2001; Pestka et al., 2004) . These cytokines also induce anti-proliferative and anti-inflammatory responses, and therefore, can also participate in adaptive immune responses (Gerlach et al., 2006 (Gerlach et al., , 2009 . Thus the administration of type-I IFN has been proposed as a treatment for several viral diseases as immunomodulatory therapy (Truyen et al., 2002; Collado et al., 2006) . These products have been used empirically and quite successfully in feline medicine, without a profound knowledge of their molecular mechanisms.",

Even though clinical improvement and lengthening of the life expectancy of infected cats was observed, several disadvantages soon became apparent, such as: its activity in vivo may be lower than expected as cytokine activity is often species-restricted (it would have less effect on feline cells than on human cells); when injected, the higher doses (100,000 U/kg/day) that are able to induce adequate serum levels may lead to the development of specific neutralizing antibodies that block the active ingredient M\u00fcller, 2002) and may have adverse effects (Caney, 2005) .",

Like other type-I IFNs, IFN-has speciesrestricted biological activity in vitro. It is able to bind to the same type-I IFN receptor complex as other type-I IFNs and therefore exerts similar antiviral, antiproliferative and immunomodulatory effects (Adolf, 1995) . However, its antigenic structure is distantly related to IFN-\u2423, -\u2424 and -\u2425, as it does not cross-react with antibodies against them (Adolf, 1995) .",

It has a proven antiviral effect, both in vitro (Mochizuki et al., 1994; Truyen et al., 2002; Ohe et al., 2008) and in vivo against canine and feline parvovirus, herpesvirus, calicivirus, coronavirus and rotavirus (Truyen et al., 2002; De Mari et al., 2004; Ishida et al., 2004; Paltrinieri et al., 2007) . In addition, the pharmacokinetic properties of rFeIFN-are comparable to those of human interferons in that it does not have a residual accumulation in the body (Ueda et al., 1993b) . It has been licensed for use in veterinary medicine (Virbagen \u00ae , Virbac) in Europe, Japan, Australia, New Zealand and Mexico, although there are few clinical studies that support its use, and its in vivo molecular mechanisms are not well understood. In general, an improvement in clinical signs has been described, justifying its use in infections in which other treatments are not fully effective, such as retroviral diseases.",

However, this beneficial response had a limited duration as cats developed antibodies against human IFN . To reduce the development of antibodies, lower doses of IFN were administered orally (1-10 IU/kg body weight), resulting in longer survival rates during some studies, with clinical and analytical improvement noted (Steed, 1987; Cummins et al., 1988; Weiss et al., 1991) ; in others although there was no improvement (McCaw et al., 2001) . Similarly, oral treatment of clinically sick FIV-infected cats with low doses of natural HuIFN-\u2423 resulted in an extended survival period and improved clinical signs (Pedretti et al., 2006) . In spite of the clinical benefits of HuIFN-\u2423 treatment, FeLV-and FIV-infected cats became persistently viremic or had a reduced viral replication only during the treatment period (McCaw et al., 2001; Pedretti et al., 2006) .",

            "text": "After the synthesis and commercialization of the recombinant feline IFN-molecule, most studies in feline medicine have focused on its application. Presently, it is the only interferon that the European Medicine Agency (http://emea.europa.eu) has registered in Europe for feline medicine. It has been approved for the treatment of parvovirosis in dogs from one month of age, and FeLV and/or FIV infections in non-terminal cats from the age of 9 weeks (http://emea.europa.eu). Yet very few studies have analyzed the effect of rFeIFN-in naturally-infected cats with FeLV and/or FIV. One of the most extensive studies undertaken evaluated this interferon in a multicentric, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in FeLV-infected or FeLV/FIV co-infected cats with associated clinical signs (De Mari et al., 2004) . Cats were treated subcutaneously with rFeIFN-(10 6 U/kg/day) daily for five consecutive days in three series (day 0, 14, 60). An improvement in clinical signs and decrease in the mortality rate was observed after treatment as compared to control animals. There was also an increase in the leukogram and in the RBC count in anemic cats (De Mari et al., 2004) . However, as no virological (viremia or proviral loads) or immunological (such as CD4/CD8 ratio) parameters were measured throughout the study, it is difficult to conclude whether or not these effects were due to its immunomodulatory or antiviral activities. Since IFN-has biological properties similar to IFN-\u2423, it is possible that the clinical benefits observed in treated cats corresponded to the activation of their innate immune system for an improved control of environmental pathogens, as compared with an improvement in their viremic state. Further studies are necessary in order to discover answers to these questions.",

Cats may have one or more clinical signs, or may be totally asymptomatic. Practitioners may not know the immune status of the animal, its CD4/CD8 ratio or the proviral load. Thus, treatment with rFeIFN-may produce different results than expected, ranging from no visible effects to an apparent clinical improvement. A big concern for the clinical veterinarian is whether this improvement correlates with a true improvement of the infection, i.e., a decrease in viremia or the proviral load of the cat, or whether the infection may revert when treatment of rFeIFN-is suspended. Treatment is also hampered by the cost of the product. The company recommends three cycles of treatment for five consecutive days, on days 0, 14 and 60. As there is usually clinical improvement, oftentimes, owners consider that the cat has been cured, and suspend treatment before its completion. Another issue for practitioners is deciding when treatment should be repeated, when no analytical values are available. For these reasons, we undertook a preliminary study on the use of rFeIFN-in randomly selected household cats that were brought to the Complutense University Veterinary Clinic Hospital of Madrid, Spain.",

They were treated for eight weeks with commercial rFeIFN-(Virbagen \u00ae , Virbac, France) following the protocol suggested by De Mari et al. (2004) . Ten other cats (five FeLV + and five FIV + ), eight of them female, and housed in a cattery, were left untreated and used as controls. The date of infection was unknown in all cases; presumably, the cats were in different stages of the disease, since they included three asymptomatic FIV + cats, and ten cats (4 FeLV + and 6 FIV + ) with six or more different retrovirus-associated clinical signs (RACS) of various degrees of severity (clinical score \u22656, severe disease). The most frequent disorders were anorexia, apathy, pallor and oral lesions. Blood samples were taken before the beginning of treatment (V1), and two weeks after completion (V2), with equivalent sampling dates in untreated cats. Three treated cats were brought for follow-up examination until month 12 (V3). Blood sampling, hemogram, leukogram, biochemical profile, electrophoretogram, and CD4/CD8 determination were conducted as described previously (Miro et al., 2007) . FeLV p27 and FIV p24 proteins were evaluated using commercial Petchek kits developed by Idexx (Westbrook, ME, USA), and RT activity was measured with kits provided by Cavidi Tech (Uppsala, Sweden). Quantitative PCR (qPCR) was conducted using the procedures described by Pinches et al. (2007) and Leutenegger et al. (1999) . Results were statistically analyzed using Statgraphics.

No treated or untreated cat became negative. In one treated-FeLV + and one treated-FIV + cat the proviral load increased, though they did not display worsened clinical condition. As regards to viremia, only FeLV + cats were positive for RT and capsid protein. In these cats, the response to interferon was variable (Table 1) . One of the treated FeLV + cats worsened in all the viral parameters, but its CS decreased. Caney et al. (2003) did not observe an effect of rFeIFN-on the proviral load.",

            "text": "To date, the in vivo mechanism of type-I IFNs on retroviral infections is unknown. In a murine model with the Friend murine leukemia retrovirus, the immunomodulatory effect of IFN-\u2423 seemed to be more important than the antiviral effect through the induction of antiviral enzymes (Gerlach et al., 2009 ). In our preliminary study, rFeIFNinduced an evident improvement of the clinical condition of treated cats, as well as of the hemogram parameters. The CD4/CD8 ratio improvement was inconsistent, and the virological parameters, such as proviral load and viremia were not seen to be affected by treatment. This suggests that rFeIFN-possibly lacks antiviral effects in vivo, but rather may have an immunomodulatory effect. Taking these results into consideration, it would seem advisable to treat retrovirus-infected cats with interferon when they have clinical signs, as they would benefit from its effects in improving their clinical condition.",
