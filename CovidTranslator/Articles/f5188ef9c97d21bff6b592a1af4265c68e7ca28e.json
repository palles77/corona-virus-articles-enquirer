Comparative homology modelling may have the potential to close this gap by predicting protein structure in target sequences using existing experimentally solved structures as templates. This paper presents the first use of force-directed graphs for the visualization of sequence space in two dimensions, and applies them to the choice of suitable RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP) target-template pairs within human-infective RNA virus genera. Measures of centrality in protein sequence space for each genus were also derived and used to identify centroid nearest-neighbour sequences (CNNs) potentially useful for production of homology models most representative of their genera. Homology modelling was then carried out for targettemplate pairs in different species, different genera and different families, and model quality assessed using several metrics. Reconstructed ancestral RdRP sequences for individual genera were also used as templates for the production of ancestral RdRP homology models. High quality ancestral RdRP models were consistently produced, as were good quality models for target-template pairs in the same genus. Homology modelling between genera in the same family produced mixed results and inter-family modelling was unreliable. We present a protocol for the production of optimal RdRP homology models for use in further experiments, e.g. docking to discover novel anti-viral compounds. (219 words)",

RdRPs are also of immense medical importance as the principal targets for antiviral drugs. Evolution of resistance against anti-viral drugs is a major concern for the future, and the design of novel anti-viral compounds is a highly active research area. Solved structures of RdRPs are of great assistance to these efforts, as they enable the use of docking protocols against large libraries of pharmaceutical candidate compounds [e.g. Refs. [6, 7] ].",

This paper will first identify where the protein sequencestructure gap is at its widest in RdRPs. Because of the sequencestructure gap, it is therefore impossible in many genera to perform docking protocols against solved structures of RdRP for discovery of novel anti-viral compounds. Under these circumstances, replacement of real solved structures with homology models for docking experiments requires that the homology models used should be both high quality and also optimally representative of their respective genera. Our second task is to present several similarity metrics in sequence space that assist in the identification of the virus species having the RdRP sequence that is most representative of its genus as a whole. We then present the first use of force-directed graphs to produce an intuitive visualization of sequence space, and select target RdRPs without solved structures for homology modelling. These are then used to perform homology modelling using template-target pairs within the same genus, between sister genera and between sister families, monitoring the quality of the models produced as the template becomes progressively more genetically distant to the target sequence being modelled. Finally, we produce homology models for reconstructed common ancestral RdRP sequences. In the light of our results, we comment on the strengths and weakness of homology modelling to reduce the size of the protein sequence-structure gap for RdRPs, and produce a flowchart of recommendations for docking experiments on RdRP proteins lacking a solved structure.",

In the order Mononegavirales, Vesiculovirus was the only genus with a solved RdRP structure suitable for homology modelling. However, this order contains many medically important viruses such as Zaire ebolavirus, Hendra henipavirus, Measles morbillivirus, and Mumps rubulavirus [26] . In the order Bunyavirales, Phenuiviridae stands out as an important family lacking a solved RdRP, despite it containing various human-infective arboviruses such as Rift Valley fever phlebovirus and Sandfly fever Naples phlebovirus [27] . (Table 1) . Fig. 1 shows two-dimensional force-directed graphs of similarity for each genus with more than four RdRP reference sequences (or RT sequences in the case of Lentivirus). In principle, it would be possible to draw force-directed graphs for entire families and even orders. However, the input to qgraph is the similarity matrix calculated from the distance matrix, and the distance matrix is calculated in MEGA from an alignment. Once taxonomic distance begin to extend beyond genera, alignment becomes progressively less reliable, with all the downstream statistics tending to degrade as a consequence. We therefore confine our construction of forcedirected graphs to intra-genus comparisons.",

Only the models for American bat vesiculovirus and Tamana bat virus have percentages of F-J outliers outside of the high quality range. QMEAN, however, is rather more critical of the output with only the model for Porcine picobirnavirus falling within the high quality range. The model for Imjin thottimvirus scores eighth best on percentage of F-J outliers and second best on RMSD, despite the re-classification (occurring after the completion of our experimental work) by the ICTV of this virus, originally in genus Orthohantavirus into a new Thottimvirus genus [28] . It should be noted that the models for Imjin thottimvirus, Burana orthonairovirus and Brazilian mammarenavirus were based on very short template structures (see Table 2 ). Table 4 shows that homology modelling with template and target within the same family but different genera, still produced good quality models in most cases, as judged by percentage of F-J outliers and RMSD within the high quality range. Only the models for Lleida bat lyssavirus and Macaque simian foamy virus have percentages of F-J outliers outside of the high quality range. However, once again, QMEAN assesses all models as outside the high quality range. Table 5 shows that homology modelling with template and target within the same order but in different families, is a far more difficult proposition than at the lower taxonomic levels. The model for Mammalian orthobornavirus 1 fails all three quality tests and only the model for Rift Valley fever phlebovirus manages to pass two out of three. Table 6 shows that modelling the structure of the reconstructed sequence of the common ancestor of each genus, produces models of the same standard as intra-genus modelling (compare Tables 3  and 6 ). By contrast with almost all the other models, the QMEAN scores are within the high quality range, with only two exceptions, Table. the common ancestors of genera Rotavirus and Vesiculovirus. Fig. 1C shows the force-directed graphs with the locations of the ancestral sequences added. Table 7 summarises the results of Tables 3e6 inclusive. As the taxonomical distance increases, production of high quality homology models becomes more difficult. However, modelling the reconstructed ancestral sequence of each genus is typically productive of a better scoring model even than the real sequence targets chosen for intra-genus modelling. Fig. 4 shows representative examples of homology models of high and low quality superimposed with their template solved structure along with their corresponding Ramachandran plots and QMEAN quality scores.",

Additionally, within the genera Orthohantavirus, Orthonairovirus and Mammarenavirus, all within the order Bunyavirales, the solved structure available for RdRP covers less than 10% of the protein sequence.

For instance, starting from a distance matrix, agglomerative hierarchical clustering, such as the UPGMA method [29] , can be performed to generate a tree. Slightly more sophisticated methods, such as neighbour-joining [30] can generate trees where the branch lengths are proportional to genetic distance. Force-directed graphs do not represent genetic distance as accurately as phylogenetic trees, since the distances between nodes, Table. although optimized to reflect relatedness, are constrained by the Fruchterman-Reingold algorithm to the best representation in two dimensions. However, force-directed graphs again allow easier simultaneous comparison of several data sets than phylogenetic trees. Fig. 1 would be impossible to create on a single page if trees were used instead of force-directed graphs. Trees represent ancestral sequences as nodes on the tree, with only existing taxa as leaves. Force-directed graphs, by contrast, allow ancestral sequences to be represented in the same way as existing ones. Fig. 1C shows that ancestral sequences do not necessarily appear as outliers in force-directed graphs. Indeed, for genera Flavivirus, Hepacivirus, Orthobunyavirus and Orthohantavirus in particular, the insertion of the reconstructed ancestral sequence into the forcedirected graph in Fig. 1C does not overly distort its original shape in Fig. 1AeB . The reason for this becomes apparent when one considers a phylogenetic tree represented in unrooted \"star\" format. The ancestral sequence is then at the centre of the star topology and it can be seen that the genetic distance from the root to any particular leaf sequence may often be less than for many pairwise leaf sequence combinations. We did not perform calculation of centroid nearest neighbours (CNNs) for alignments incorporating reconstructed ancestral sequences, but we are tempted to speculate that many of the ancestral sequences would have been CNNs, had they been included.

Among the various statistics for assessment of model quality, F-J outlier percentage is a measure of the proportion of implausible dihedral angles in the model, and indicate where parts of the model backbone are likely to be incorrectly predicted. Nevertheless, it is also important not to become too dependent on statistics such as F-J outlier percentage, as \"bad\" angles do occasionally occur in solved structures. For instance in the present study, the thresholds of <0.05% for a very high quality model, and <2% for a good quality model given by Lovell et al. [19] would suggest that six of the twelve template solved structures used here ( Table 2) would not have been assessed as \"very high quality\" had they been models rather than solved structures. Indeed the templates from Indiana Vesiculovirus and Rotavirus A have more than 0.5% F-J outliers, and also have the poor quality scores for QMEAN. These two structures also have the poorest resolution of any of our templates, at > 3 \u00c5. The poor quality scoring may therefore simply be a consequence of uncertainties in positioning of atoms in these structures. One might reasonably posit that the use of template solved structures having such issues might influence the resulting models to contain the same outliers. However, the model for Rotavirus I has a lower level of F-J outliers than its Rotavirus A template ( Table 3) .",

We therefore suggest that homology modelling may be used to produce RdRP models for research use even for genera where no solved structure exists, provided a template structure exists within the same family. Here, we provide examples (Table 4 ) of such successful inter-genus, intra-family, models for genera Coltivirus and Parechovirus. Our inter-genus models for Lyssavirus and Spumavirus are slightly less successful. Moving to the next taxonomic level, models with template-target pairs in separate families (Table 5) are generally less successful. One exception is our model for family Phenuiviridae, which is better than some of the intra-family models. This is encouraging, since Phenuiviridae is a family without any solved RdRP structure. Homology models have been produced at much larger taxonomic distances than those dealt with here, for instance from bacteria to eukaryotes [31] , so it should be stressed that we make no claim for the generality of our findings outside of the viral orders under consideration, or for proteins other than RdRP. Multi-domain proteins in particular, may produce higher quality models for some domains than others.",

            "text": "One surprising result was the high quality of the models of reconstructed ancestral sequences (Table 6 , summarized in Table 7 ). As previously discussed, this may be due to the fact that the ancestral sequence is, assuming a regular molecular clock, potentially equally related to all descendent members of its genus. In this paper, we calculated centroid nearest neighbours (CNNs) as the central points in sequence space for each genus (Fig. 1) . A reconstructed ancestral sequence may also be considered as a candidate central point. The value of central points is that they may serve as targets that could be used to make models representative of their genus as a whole. For instance, the shortest-path, mean and median CNNs of genus Orthohantavirus are sequences 16, 22 and 7 (see Supplementary Table for a list of sequences for each genus) , representing Sin Nombre orthohantavirus, Rockport orthohantavirus and Cao Bang orthohantavirus respectively. The partial solved structure used as the template for modelling in the genus Orthohantavirus in the present paper is from Hantaan orthohantavirus (5IZE, see Table 2 ) and the target used, Imjin thottimvirus (sequence 27 in Orthohantavirus panel of Fig. 1) , is now classified as belonging to a new genus Thottimvirus (Table 3) . The three CNNs, Sin Nombre orthohantavirus, Rockport orthohantavirus and Cao Bang orthohantavirus are 71%, 64% and 75% identical to 5IZE respectively, whereas Imjin thottimvirus is only 58% identical. The latter was of course chosen to test the effectiveness of intra-genus homology modelling over as wide a genetic distance as possible (see Section 2.5). For the performance of subsequent experimental procedures on Orthohantavirus RdRPs, for instance docking to discover novel anti-viral compounds, a homology model corresponding to one of the three CNNs mentioned above or to the reconstructed ancestor (Table 6 ) would be the preferred target, along with the existing solved structure. Where a solved RdRP structure exists in a genus, it should be used. However, if that solved structure is not a CNN, a homology model of a CNN or ancestral sequence should be produced for comparative purposes. Where no solved RdRP structure exists in a genus, a structure from another genus in the same family may be used.",

Where a solved structure exists within a genus, it is the obvious choice for further experiments. However, where that solved structure is far from any of the CNN sequences of the genus, as judged by the force-directed graph, a CNN may also be homology modelled for comparative purposes, using the existing solved structure as a template. Any differential performance of the solved structure and the homology model in, for instance, a docking experiment, may give clues as to the generality of conclusions derived from the solved structure alone. A reconstructed ancestral RdRP may also be used as an alternative to, or in addition to, a CNN. The limits of homology modelling would appear, on the basis of the results presented here, to be at the intrafamily, inter-genus level. Template-target pairs in different viral families are unlikely to be of practical use, as the predicted quality of the resulting models is low. Our models were produced using MOE, and we have not performed comparisons using other modelling tools, such as SWISS-MODEL [31] or Modeller [32] . We feel that it is unlikely that significant differences in output would be produced, but when the object of the exercise is drug-discovery, we recommend that the protocol in Fig. 5 be implemented using several alternative modelling softwares.",
