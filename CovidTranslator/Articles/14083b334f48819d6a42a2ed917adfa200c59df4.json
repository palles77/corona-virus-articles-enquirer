In the current study, prediction is made for highly infected countries by a simple and novel method using only cumulative positive cases reported. The rate of infection per week ( ) coefficient delineated three phases for the current COVID-19 pandemic. All the countries under study have passed Phase 1 and are currently in Phase 2 except for South Korea which is in Phase 3. Early detection with rapid and large-scale testing helps in controlling the COVID-19 pandemic.",

Asymptotic spread has made detection of virus very difficult. Reverse transcription PCR is widely used for detecting COVID-19 virus which may take few hours and days to obtain results. Observing threat to public health, World Health Organization (WHO) has declared novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) outbreak to be \"public health emergency of international concern\" on Jan. 30, 2020 [3] and on the 11th of March the disease was declared a global pandemic [4] .",

Similarly, [16][17] suggested the importance of screening, surveillance and control efforts, particularly at airports and other travel hubs, in order to prevent further international spread of 2019-nCoV. South Korea is a best example where for Phase 1 was highest 7617.86 among the countries under study, which was due to large scale testing and identification of positive cases (7,290 person per million population as of Mar 27) [20], thus leading to quick transition from",
