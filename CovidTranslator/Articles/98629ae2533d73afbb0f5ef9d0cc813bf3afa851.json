A total of 80,956 cases have been confirmed in China, of which 67,73 cases have been diagnosed in Hubei Province. The origin of the new coronavirus has not yet been determined, and various evidences suggest that its source of infection comes from wild animals. The medical field mainly focuses on three aspects: etiological characteristics, clinical diagnosis, and epidemiology, Several studies have shown that SARS-CoV-2 is most similar to bat SARS-like coronaviruses (SARS-like CoVs) and is more infectious than SARS viruses during the incubation period. [1] Since the outbreak of the new crown virus infection in Wuhan in 2019, many scholars have performed simulation analysis on the spread and prevention of the epidemic, and reached different conclusions. Ziff (2020) believes that using the basic infection number R0 to measure the possibility of large-scale transmission of the virus without prevention and control is not realistic. [2] The main drawback is that it is necessary to assume that the virus's propagation path is exponential, and it can be corrected using the SEIR logarithmic model. [3] Li et al. (2020) used Log-normal, Weibull, and Gamma distributions to estimate the basic regeneration number R0 as 2.2 (95% CI, 1.4 to 3.9) and the latency period to be 5.2 days (95% CI, 4.1-7). The number of confirmed cases doubles every 7.4 days, and the interval from onset to inpatient treatment and cure was 9.1 days (95% CI, 8.6-9.7). [4] Wu et al. (2020) analyzed and predicted by SEIR model and estimated the basic regeneration number R0 to be 2.6 (95% CI, 2.47-2.86), the estimated cumulative total confirmed cases was 75,815 (95% CI, 37304 to 130330) and the number of confirmed casesDoubled at 6.4 days (95% CI, 5.8-7.1). [5] The calculation shows that the transmission path of New Coronavirus has certain fractal process characteristics. By comparing the difference between the actual confirmed case and the theoretical value, you can determine which period the epidemic is in:rising or falling. Vazquez (2006) uses the branching process of fractal theory to describe the spread of variables, to establish mathematical models for different situations such as population or virus transmission in reality, to determine the corresponding power index and to calculate the potential development path of historical data. [6] Throughout the severe situation of the global economy, the spread of the new crown virus infection epidemic has led to a sudden drop in demand and production, which has affected the global supply chain economy. In the external environment of economic downturn, how to maintain macroeconomic stability and find opportunities among risks has become the focus of attention. [7] 3 Rescaled Range (R / S) Analysis .

[8] It is a widely used robust non-parametric statistical m ethod. The biggest advantage is that the measured time series does not need to assume its specific distrib-ution characteristics whether the sequence is smooth. The robustness of the R/S analysis res -ults is not affected by the distribution characteristics. [9] H value is also called Hurst index. Hurst believes that the following relationship exists betwe en R / S and H: (R / S) t = (t / 2) H, which can be obtained by log (R / S) and log (n) regression fitt ing for judgment Trend and randomness of time series Whether the time series is a fractal B-rowni an motion is determined according to whether the H value is equal to 0.5. The H index has a wide r ange of applications. Cajueiro (2004) believes that the H index can be used to determine the effecti veness of the securities market. This method can be extended to other fields that study the d-ynami c characteristics of time series. [10] When predicting a set of memorable data, it can refer to its histo rical development path. Improper selection of the length of the time series will affect the bias of th e estimation of the H index and reduce the accuracy of the prediction. To correct this error, Baruni k (2010) uses a rolling time window to deter-mine the form of the H index over time, and uses the AR (1) -GARCH (1,1) process to filter the s-equence. Multifractal detrending analysis (MF-DFA) uses different polynomials to fit different ord-er moments of variables. It is a generalization of the DFA method and can improve the accuracy o-f processing thick-tailed data. [11] ",

Since February, the number of new cases has increased sharply again, probably because the virus carriers in the population flowing out of Hubei Province from mid-January to January have passed the incubation period and their symptoms have begun to appear. A first-level response to major public health emergencies was initiated.

Therefore, the Italian government should focus on controlling the infection in terms of source, cutting off the transmission route, following the principle of early detection, early isolation, and early treatment to reduce the gathering of large people, in the meantime regularly cleaning of public spaces is necessary. The number of newly diagnosed patients in Italy is highly similar to that in Hubei. It can learned from the strict measures adopted by Hubei in isolation and treatment, community prevention and other measures. Also, they can adopt effective protection measures based on the actual situation of the epidemic in the country to significantly reduce the population contact rate. Blocking the route of transmission, and thoroughly controlling the spread of the epidemic can also help. The H indexes of all provinces in China except Hubei are in the range of (0,0.5), indicating that the virus transmission has fractal Brownian motion characteristics. There may be a correlation between the future path and historical data, and the number of newly diagnosed patients will be increased in the short term. We can see the risk of returning to the historical path. Therefore, the masses and medical staff need to take corresponding preventive and controlling measures. Yet it is not time to relax our vigilance, we should continue to strengthen our protection and observe the changes in data, as well as pay particular attention to the cyclical fluctuations that rise after the number of confirmed diagnoses declines.",

In this article, the reasons for the selection and stage division of the number of newly confirmed cases in other provinces in China except Hubei are the same as above. The daily number of newly confirmed cases from January 23 to February 11 is used as the first stage data. We take the period between February 13 to March 3 as the second stage. Figures 10-15 can be obtained through Matlab data analysis. The results are as follows: 2.1 Time series characteristics From the change in the number of the newly confirmed cases in the first stage over time, the curve generally showed a trend of rising before decreasing. Before t = 10, the diagnosis and treatment of COVID-19 infection cases are still in the initial stage.
