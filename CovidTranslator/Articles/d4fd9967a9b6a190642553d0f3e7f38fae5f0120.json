We aimed to examine whether serum YKL-40 and growth factors could be markers for PIBO exacerbation. Thirtyseven children admitted with acute exacerbation of PIBO were enrolled and studied retrospectively. Diagnosis of PIBO was based on clinical history of acute respiratory infection followed by persistent airway obstruction and characteristic findings in high-resolution computed tomography. Serum levels of YKL-40, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), transforming growth factor (TGF)-\u03b21, and platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF)-BB were measured on admission. The biomarkers were also examined in children admitted with acute bronchiolitis serving as positive controls (N = 30) and in age-matched controls (N = 20). Only YKL-40 levels were found to be significantly higher in PIBO patients with exacerbation compared with that in bronchiolitis patients and showed a positive correlation with the severity of disease before diagnosis of PIBO.",

Various kinds of lung injuries due to infection, allogeneic transplantation, and exposure to toxic fumes have been reported to cause BO [1, 2] . It is known that these diverse medical conditions share some common pathways that result in a characteristic histopathology of BO, subepithelial inflammation, and fibrotic narrowing of bronchioles [2] . In young children, BO occurs most often after respiratory infection and common pathogens including adenovirus, influenza virus, and Mycoplasma pneumoniae have been associated with the development of post-infectious BO (PIBO) [3] . Many children diagnosed with PIBO, in contrast to those with post-transplant BO, show clinical improvement during lung development. However, radiological findings and impaired lung function are persistent or sometimes progressive [4] [5] [6] .",

YKL-40 and growth factor levels were not measured repeatedly over time and were not studied in the patients without exacerbation, which would be necessary to demonstrate their prolonged effects in the airways of young children and development of PIBO. Although our results showed some relationship between YKL-40 levels and clinical severity of disease, histopathological findings will be needed to clarify the role of YKL-40 in the pathogenesis of PIBO. However, to our knowledge, our study showed for the first time that YKL-40, known to play a role in the development of BO after lung transplantation or other lung injuries, is also increased in the serum of the children who developed BO after respiratory infection.",
