            "text": "Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is a respiratory disease caused by a newly found virus, called SARS coronavirus. In this study, the cleavage mechanism of the SARS coronavirus main proteinase (M pro or 3CL pro ) on the octapeptide NH 2 -AVLQ fl SGFR-COOH was investigated using molecular mechanics and quantum mechanics simulations based on the experimental structure of the proteinase. It has been observed that the catalytic dyad (His-41/Cys-145) site between domains I and II attracts the p electron density from the peptide bond Gln-Ser, increasing the positive charge on C(CO) of Gln and the negative charge on N(NH) of Ser, so as to weaken the Gln-Ser peptide bond. The catalytic functional group is the imidazole group of His-41 and the S in Cys-145. N d1 on the imidazole ring plays the acid-base catalytic role. Based on the ''distorted key theory' ' [K.C. Chou, Anal. Biochem. 233 (1996) 1-14], the possibility to convert the octapeptide to a competent inhibitor has been studied. It has been found that the chemical bond between Gln and Ser will become much stronger and no longer cleavable by the SARS enzyme after either changing the carbonyl group CO of Gln to CH 2 or CF 2 or changing the NH of Ser to CH 2 or CF 2 . The octapeptide thus modified might become an effective inhibitor or a potential drug candidate against SARS.",

This octapeptide was synthesized, proved to be a cleavable peptide, and showed strong inhibiting activity in a tube test [12] . Du et al. [13] analyzed the cleavage mechanism of the octapeptide by SARS CoV M pro and discussed the possible chemical modification of the octapeptide using molecular dynamical and quantum mechanical simulations based on the homology structure of SARS CoV M pro , to convert it into a stable and effective drug.

They provided several crystal structures of SARS CoV M pro at different pH conditions and the complex structure of SARS CoV M pro with ligand hexapeptidyl CMK [7, 8] . The experimental structure and the theoretical homology structure of SARS CoV M pro share many structural similarities, such as the catalytic active region and the Cys-His cleavage dyad [7, 8] . However, there are several differences between the theoretical and the experimental structures. For examples, the experimental structure of SARS CoV M pro is a dimer, the protomer A has catalytic activity, and the protomer B has no activity. However, the N finger of protomer B, which plugs in the active cleft of protomer A, plays an important role in both dimerization and maintenance of the active form of the enzyme [8] . These new findings from the experimental structure of SARS CoV M pro provide a reliable basis for inhibitor design.",

To convert a cleavable peptide into a stable and effective inhibitor, the peptide has to be modified according to the ''distorted key'' theory [14, 15] .

The atomic charges from semiempirical method AM1 are quite different from the results by ab initio HF/6-31G* [23] ; in particular; the q ESP charges of AM1 do not appear reasonable. Because the HF/6-31G* q ESP charges reproduce the quantum mechanical electrostatic potential on the molecular surface, in this research we use q ESP from the HF/6-31G* calculations to illustrate our points. The imidazole group of His-41 is a nucleophilic agent and its pK = 6.0, near the concentration of proton [H + ] in pure water. The imidazole ring is both a proton donor and a receptor. It has good catalytic activity in the physiological condition [27] . It can be seen from Table 2 that the negative charge of N d1 (\u00c00.4094) and the positive charge of H \u00fe d1 (0.4318) are large in magnitude and are close to the peptide bond Gln-Ser. Therefore, the proton H \u00fe d1 attracts the p electron density from the peptide bond Gln-Ser so as to weaken this chemical bond. The polar nitrogen N d1 attracts one hydrogen H 1 of bridge water and makes the water molecule dissociated, causing the nucleophilic attack of hydroxyl group OH \u00c0 to the C(CO) and the electrophilic attack of H + to N(NH) on the two sides of peptide bond Gln-Ser. The sulfur atom S in Cys-145 forms a hydrogen bond with H(NH) and helps the proteolytic reaction (Fig. 3B) .",

Fig. 5A shows the electron density contour map of the peptide bond Gln-Ser in the gaseous phase on the p plane containing the carbonyl group CO of Gln and the NH group of Ser. The electron density contours surrounding atoms N(NH) and C(CO) form two triangles reminiscent of the hybrid orbits of the sp 2 type, and the 2p z orbits, which are perpendicular to the plane and form a p 4 3 bond system. In Table 3 , we list the calculated atomic charges of the six atoms on both sides of the peptide bond Gln-Ser obtained from the ab initio HF/6-31G* calculations in the gaseous phase with the background charges of SARS-CoV M pro . The negative charge of N(NH) of serine in the octapeptide increases to \u00c00.8612 in the background of proteinase charges from the original value of \u00c00.8534 in the gaseous phase. Similarly, the corresponding positive charge of the carbonyl carbon C(CO) in glutamine of the octapeptide increases to 0.8190 from the original 0.8050. This is favorable to the electrophilic attack of OH \u00c0 to C(CO) and the nucleophilic attack of H + to N(NH) in the proteolytic reaction. Fig. 5B is the contour map of differential electronic density of the peptide bond Gln-Ser in the octapeptide AVLQSGFR, obtained by subtracting the electron density in the gaseous phase from the electron density in the background [23] of SARS CoV M pro and solvent water molecules. In Fig. 5B the bold gray line is the 0 value line where the electron densities in the gaseous phase and in the protease background are equal. The solid thin lines show the regions where the computed electron densities are greater in the SARS CoV M pro background than in the gaseous phase, and the dashed thin lines show the areas where computed electron densities are smaller in the proteinase background than in the gaseous phase. We find that along the peptide bond between (Gln)C-N(Ser) the electron densities increase on the N(Ser) side and decrease on the C(Gln) side. This change is favorable for a nucleophilic attack of anion OH \u00c0 to (Gln)C and for an electrophilic attack of cation H + to N(Ser).",

The cleavage specificity of SARS CoV M pro concentrates on the sites R2, R1, and R1 0 . The development of peptides as clinically useful drugs is limited by their poor stability and bioavailability, which is due in part to their inability to readily cross membrane barriers such as the intestinal and blood-brain barriers. Systematic chemical modification strategies that convert peptides into drugs are an attractive research topic in current medicinal chemistry [28] . For the peptide inhibitor of proteinase, the chemical modification to cleavable octapeptide should focus on the scissile peptide bond between R 1 and R 1 0 to be cleaved by SARS CoV M pro . A successful example shows that after the peptide bond CO@NH is replaced by reduced single bond CH 2 ANH, the modified octapeptide rennin inhibitors have shown greatly increased affinity for rennin and strong resistance to enzyme hydrolysis [29] .",

In the peptide bond (Gln) CO@NH(Ser) the carboxyl group CO of glutamine on subsite R 1 is replaced by CH 2 or CF 2 or the NH of serine on subsite R 1 0 is replaced by CH 2 ; then the p bond system is broken and the modified octapeptide AVLQ SGFR may become a stable inhibitor for SARS-CoV M pro and an effective drug candidate against SARS. Here we show the possibility of the chemical modification through computational modeling. Table 4 lists the atomic charges of the six atoms on both sides of the hybrid peptide bond Gln-Ser after the chemical modification. Comparing with Table 3 , we find that after CO is replaced by CH 2 , the charge of the carbon atom in CH 2 turns negative (\u00c00.6572) from originally a positive value (0.8612) in the CO group; hence the nucleophilic attack by OH \u00c0 becomes impossible. Furthermore, the negative charge of N(NH) on the Ser side decreases to \u00c00.2892 from \u00c00.8190 in Table 3 , and hence the electrophilic attack by H + also becomes more difficult. Likewise, the modifications CO fi CF 2 and NH fi CH 2 will make the proteolytic reaction more difficult also. ",

A detailed study of the cleavage mechanism needs a great deal of experimental work. However, computational simulation may provide useful insights for an in-depth understanding of the mechanism. The cleavable octapeptide could be changed into an effective inhibitor of SARS-CoV M pro or a drug candidate against SARS after a proper chemical modification to replace the cleavable peptide bond with a noncleavable bond. The octapeptide thus modified will lose its susceptibility although it can still tightly bind to the active site and become a competent inhibitor, just like the role of a distorted key in blocking the access of other keys to a lock, as elucidated by Chou [15] in a review paper.",
