            "text": "Airborne pathogens are associated with the spread of infectious diseases and increased morbidity and mortality. Herein we present an emerging chemical free, nanotechnology-based method for airborne pathogen inactivation. This technique is based on transforming atmospheric water vapor into Engineered Water Nano-Structures (EWNS) via electrospray. The generated EWNS possess a unique set of physical, chemical, morphological and biological properties. Their average size is 25 nm and they contain reactive oxygen species (ROS) such as hydroxyl and superoxide radicals. In addition, EWNS are highly electrically charged (10 electrons per particle on average). A link between their electric charge and the reduction of their evaporation rate was illustrated resulting in an extended lifetime (over an hour) at room conditions. Furthermore, it was clearly demonstrated that the EWNS have the ability to interact with and inactivate airborne bacteria. Finally, inhaled EWNS were found to have minimal toxicological effects, as illustrated in an acute in-vivo inhalation study using a mouse model. In conclusion, this novel, chemical free, nanotechnologybased method has the potential to be used in the battle against airborne infectious diseases. \u2020 The manuscript was written through contributions of all authors.

            "text": "Airborne pathogens are associated with the spread of numerous infectious diseases 1,2 and significant mortality and morbidity. 3 Typical examples of airborne infectious diseases include tuberculosis (Mycobacterium tuberculosis), and viral diseases such as avian influenza AI/H5N1 4-6 and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). 7 Concerns about the evolution and spread of antibiotic resistant bacteria, such as multidrug resistant tuberculosis, 8, 9 reveal the limitations of antibiotics, while the SARS outbreak and the AI/ H5N1 pandemic influenza exemplify the difficulties associated with vaccine development. 10 The need to disinfect ambient air was recognized as early as the 1930s 11 and remains one of the main strategies used in controlling the transmission of airborne diseases. 12 The use of air disinfection as a disease control strategy is regaining considerable interest lately, particularly in high-risk microenvironments with a high density of people, such as hospitals, classrooms and mass transportation vehicles (e.g., buses, aircraft cabin, trains). 13, 14 Current air disinfection technologies, such as the use of upper-room UV-C irradiation (Ultraviolet 254 nm), 15, 16 high efficiency particulate (HEPA) air filtration 17 and photocatalysis, 18 have shortcomings. UV is associated with health risks, 19, 20 requires the upper room installation of UV fixtures, and relies on a well-mixed air concept. HEPA filters remove bacteria and viruses from the air effectively, but there are excessive costs associated with the energy needed to circulate air through the filter, and for filter replacement. 21 Recently, nanoparticle photocatalysis 22 using UV-A has been used to disinfect surfaces. 23 However, nanoparticle photocatalysis is limited to surfaces and the commonly used nanomaterials, such as Ag or TiO 2 , cannot be used for airborne pathogen inactivation due to their possible toxicological effects when inhaled. [24] [25] [26] Furthermore, the use of other disinfection methods which are based on the use of biocidal gases such ethylene oxide, 27 hydrogen peroxide, 28 ozone 29 and chlorine dioxide 30 also have limitations associated with toxicity, 31 potential material damage, and in some instances downtime of the space or equipment being treated. Personal protective equipment (e.g., surgical masks and N-95 type respirators), although commonly used to prevent infectious disease transmission, are not always effective or practical in the battle against airborne infectious diseases. 32 Herein, we describe a novel, nanotechnology-based, air disinfection technique using Engineered Water Nano-Structures (EWNS) generated via electrospray. These nanoscale particles possess unique physicochemical and biological properties. They are highly mobile due to their nanoscale size, remain suspended in the air for hours, contain reactive oxygen species, and interact with and inactivate airborne bacteria. More importantly, this is a chemical-free and toxicologically benign method, which can be used to decrease the risk of airborne infectious diseases in a wide variety of environmental settings.",

            "text": "EWNS were synthesized by electrospraying condensed atmospheric water vapor recovered from room air. Electrospraying is used widely to aerosolize liquids and to synthesize polymeric and ceramic particles, 33 as well as fibers 34 of controlled size. It is based on applying a strong electric field to a fine capillary containing a liquid. 35 The accumulated charges at the liquid-air interface, in combination with a high electric field, result in a strong electric force that creates a streaming jet (Taylor cone) 36 that eventually breaks into droplets. The droplet size depends on the initial electrospray parameters (liquid conductivity, liquid flow rate and electric field). 37 The fine droplets are highly unstable due to their high electric surface charge, 38 and continue to break into smaller droplets described by the Rayleigh theory: 39 (1) where q [C] is the total charge of the droplet, \u03b5 0 [F m \u22121 ] the permittivity of the vacuum and \u03b3 [N m \u22121 ] the surface tension of water. Fig. 1a illustrates the electrospray module used for the synthesis of EWNS described by Seto et al. 40 The source of the liquid is water vapor from the surrounding air, condensed on a Peltier-cooled electrode, maintained at 6 \u00b0C. This eliminates the need for a continuous supply of water and minimizes the presence of organic contaminants. A high voltage (5 kV) is then applied between the electrode and a grounded counter electrode placed 5 mm from the electrode. The strong electric field (10 7 V m \u22121 ) between the two electrodes causes negative charges to accumulate on the surface of the condensed water, leading to the formation of the Taylor cone. 41 It is worth mentioning that the module consumes approximately 6 W of power and operates at 12 V. As a result, highly charged water droplets form and continue to break into smaller particles as described by Rayleigh theory (Fig. 1b) . During the formation of the water droplets the high electric field causes some water molecules to split and can strip off electrons, resulting in a high number of reactive oxygen species (ROS). 42 The concurrently generated, short lived ROS (with a lifespan in the order of nanoseconds) 43 are encapsulated in the EWNS (Fig. 1c) . As demonstrated below due to their size and high electric charge the EWNS are highly mobile and remain airborne for a long time, potentially colliding with pathogens suspended in air, and resulting in microbial inactivation (Fig. 1d) .",

The diameter and the height of the spread droplet were measured directly from the AFM topography and used to calculate the volume of the dome-like spread EWNS. Assuming that airborne EWNS have the same volume, an equivalent diameter can be calculated as follows: (2) where h is the measured height and a is the measured radius of the spread droplet ( Fig. S2  \u2021 ) .

As expected the population is decreased over time as a result of the inevitable particle losses due to collisions with the walls, potential coagulation, etc. It is obvious from these data that the EWNS remain airborne for hours, as indicated in the previously discussed AFM experiments. Fig. 5a and b show the estimated EWNS aerosol size distribution and the culturable bacteria size distribution (measured by the N6 6-stage viable impactor), in the environmental chamber at steady state conditions for the 2.9 and 1.7 ACH scenarios, respectively. It should be mentioned here that since size is not an accurate method of measuring the EWNS distribution, it was estimated based on AFM results and the total number that was measured with a CPC. The airborne bacteria aerodynamic diameter in both ACH scenarios was found to be 2.05 \u00b5m which is in agreement with the literature. 16 Furthermore, the average concentration of S. marcescens was found to be 5 and 7 cfu L \u22121 for the 2.9 ACH and 1.7 ACH, respectively, reflecting airborne concentration numbers commonly found in indoor micro-environments. 16 It is worth noting here, that the results indicate that S. marcescens in its airborne state was stable enough for the purpose of this study. This is attributed to the optimized chamber design that facilitates good mixing, has ideal volume, precisely controlled input and output flows and controlled RH. This is in agreement with other studies performed by the authors using this particular test bioaerosol. 16, [47] [48] [49] Fig. 5c presents the inactivation results for the case of the 2.9 ACH scenario. The EWNS reduced the culturable airborne bacteria concentration, at steady state conditions, by 50% in comparison with the control experiments (without EWNS). Furthermore, the EWNS completely eradicated (below the limit of detection) the culturable airborne bacteria during the decay portion of the experiment, in approximately 30 minutes, which is 50% less time compared to the control. Similar results were observed in the 1.7 ACH scenario (Fig. 5d) , where at steady state the reduction of culturable airborne bacteria was 40%, compared to control experiments. In addition, the time for complete removal of culturable bacteria during the decay was approximately 30 minutes, and significantly faster compared to the control (without EWNS).",

Hence, although the EWNS contain ROS, they cannot cause any lung injury or inflammation. It is worth mentioning that while the acute inhalation study illustrated their biological inert nature, a chronic inhalation study is needed in order to address potential toxicological outcomes from chronic exposures.

New, innovative, effective, low cost and most importantly chemical-free, 'green' technologies, possessing fewer drawbacks than the existing ones, are urgently needed in the battle against infections. In this work we present a new sustainable, chemical free, nanotechnology-based method to inactivate airborne bacteria. This technology relies on transforming atmospheric water vapor via electrospray into engineered water nano-structures (EWNS). These nano-structures possess unique physicochemical and biological properties and have been found to interact and inactivate airborne pathogens through destruction of their cell membrane. More importantly, they were found to be biologically inert in an acute in vivo inhalation study, a clear indication of their potential to be used in the battle against infectious diseases. EWNS number concentration as a function of the time in a closed chamber after the generation has stopped. After one hour 50% of the particles remain while they are still present after 4 hours. The normalized tidal volume and (F) normalized breathing frequency showed during and after the exposure no difference between exposed and controls. The standard deviation was used as error.",
