By the end of 2005, there were 149 low-standard HCW disposal facilities in operation in China, distributed throughout different areas. According to the National Hazardous Waste and Healthcare Waste Disposal Facility Construction Plan, 331 modern, high-standard, centralized facilities will be built up in China in municipal level cities. Although incineration is still the main technical option for HCW disposal in China, it is expected that, especially for medium and small size facilities, non-incineration technologies will develop quickly and will soon become the main technical option. The basic management needs -both from the point of view of pollution control and final disposal -have been defined, and a system of technical and environmental standards has been formulated and implemented; however, there are still some shortages. This is particularly true when considering the best available techniques and best environmental practices developed under the Stockholm Convention, with which the present technological and managing situations are not completely compliant. In this framework, the lifecycle (from generation to final disposal of wastes) of HCW and holistic approaches (technology verification, facilities operation, environmental supervision, environmental monitoring, training system, financial mechanism, etc.) towards HCW management are the most important criteria for the sustainable and reliable management of HCW in China.",

In the last 10 years, the enforcement of stricter PCDD/PCDFs emission standards by many countries significantly reduced the release of these substances into the environment (WHO, 2005) . HCW incineration is recognized as a key PCDD/PCDFs release source by the Stockholm Convention. This fact is also confirmed by the China PCDD/PCDFs inventory reported in the NIP, where in 2004 PCDD/PCDFs emission from HCW incineration is reported to have contributed 1.18 kg/a for a total figure of over 10.24 kg (PR China, 2007) .",

Concerning the reduction of PCDD/PCDFs release, although the BAT/BEP guideline does not establish a compulsory limit, it classifies different combinations of primary and secondary measures as BAT/BEP, which allow reaching an emission value of PCDD/PCDFs falling within a range of 0.01-0.1 ng I-TEQ/ Nm 3 (at 11% O2) (UNEP Chemicals).

In China, especially for small size HCW incinerators, application of BAT is often difficult, given the high costs associated with building, operating, maintaining, and monitoring such facilities. When considering proposals to construct new HCW disposal facilities, consideration should be given to alternatives such as activities that minimize the generation of medical waste, including resource recovery, reuse, recycling, waste separation, and to promoting products that generate less waste (UNEP Chemicals).",

However, due to increasing environmental awareness and recent technology developments, the use of non-incineration technologies like high temperature steam-based autoclave, microwave, and chemical treatment have progressively increased. There are several drivers for the increasing use of non-incineration technologies, which may be of utmost importance to China. First, many incineration facilities, built decades ago, have to be renewed or dismantled in order to meet stricter standard limits and pollution control requirements. In the course of their replacement, the construction and operation cost of non-incineration technologies may represent a significant advantage compared to the incineration option. Second, the need to fulfill the Stockholm Convention requirements for the new plants will represent an incremental investment and operational cost due to the need to adopt up-to-date air pollution control systems, the burden of this incremental cost will prove uneconomic for small facilities. In these cases, centralization or adoption of non-incineration technologies will be the only viable options. Third, the public acceptance of incineration is quite low, making it much easier to get non-incineration technologies approved, although non-incineration technologies may also have environmental problems. Fourth, due to the extremely strict requirements for selecting sites for the construction of incineration facilities, there may be insurmountable social and economic constraints. The adoption, in western countries, of non-incineration technologies, characterized by low investment and operational costs, production of non-dangerous residue, and zero PCDD/PCDFs emissions, has often allowed the above mentioned problems to be avoided. For the same reasons, these technologies may prove very successful in China, especially in regions where the centralization of disposal plants may present logistical complexities (Health Care without Harm, 2001; Malkan, 2005) .",

Therefore, incineration is presently the mainstream technology employed in China. The application of non-incineration technologies in China is less widespread than in developed countries. SEPA issued technical and environmental standards in the field of non-incineration technologies only in 2005, including three engineering and technical specifications for the construction and operation of chemical disinfection, microwave, and high temperature steam-based technology. Notwithstanding the existence of these standards, knowledge in this field, both on the administrative and technical Table 2 Main advantages and shortcomings of the different technologies for HCW in China (Akter, 2000) . sides, is still scarce in China, and the non-incineration technologies, policies, regulation, and standards are still at an early stage. Despite an increasing application of non-incineration technologies in some cities in China, incineration is still the most widely used HCW disposal technology in the country. Concerning environmental standards for incineration, while most western countries adopted a PCDD/PCDFs emission standard below 0.1TEQng/Nm 3 years ago, China still follows the 0.5TEQng/Nm 3 limit value established by the Standard for Pollution Control on Hazardous Waste Incineration, including for newly-built HCW disposal projects.

Monitoring aims at appraising whether a specific parameter, which may be an indicator of technological performance and management effectiveness, meets the requirement of standards and specifications. However, presently, among domestic disposal facilities in operation, there is a general lack of monitoring methods or monitoring capability (in terms of institution and management) for several parameters such as PCDD/ PCDFs from incineration disposal, efficiency of disinfection, and the concentration of VOCs from non-incineration treatment.

The substitution of hazardous solutions and materials with non-hazardous solutions and materials whenever possible -for instance, the purchasing of medical tools that are PVC-free, or a prohibition on the use of plastic films containing PVC for HCW packaging -must also be implemented. These countermeasures are all capable of reducing the emission of toxic pollutants like PCDD/PCDFs and heavy metals during the disposal processes.

The training system should include training methods, content, and teaching material of management and technology related to the collection, storage, transportation, and disposal of HCW. In order to enhance the level and effectiveness of HCW management, China should change and improve the training methods and content of HCW management within medical institutions, as well as compile teaching material on management and training suitable for China's medical institutions and different HCW disposal plants. In addition, the country should increase the availabil-ity of funds for training institutions and teachers in order to provide the foundation and conditions for the establishment of regular management and technology training.
