It is currently marketed under the trade name Tamiflu \u00ae (Roche), with approval for treatment of influenza in 1999, and for the prophylaxis of influenza in 2000 by U.S. FDA. In 2009, the outbreak of Influenza A virus subtype H1N1, commonly referred to as \"swine flu\", which caused fatal infection and over 17,700 deaths in over 213 countries. The World Health Organization (WHO) recommended Tamiflu for early treatment of swine flu. OS is orally well absorbed and metabolism to OSA by carboxylesterase 1 (hCE1) in-vivo (He et al., 1999; Shi et al., 2006) without interaction with human cytochrome P450 or glucuronosyltransferase (He et al., 1999) . OSA is an anion and has been proved to be the substrate of organic anion tublar secretion transporter (OAT) during its renal secretion (Deguchi et al., 2004) . OS, not OSA, is a substrate of P glycoprotein (P-gp). Accordingly, low levels of P-gp activity or drugdrug interactions at P-gp may lead to enhanced brain accumulation of oseltamivir, and this may in turn account for the central nervous system effects of oseltamivir observed in some patients (Morimoto et al., 2008) . A recent study suggested that oseltamivir is also a substrate of Peptide transporter 1 (PEPT1) during its intestinal absorption (Ogihara et al., 2009) .",

Comparing with drug-drug interactions of OS, reports on its herb-drug interactions are even fewer. Effects of herbal supplement and traditional medicines (including extracts from six traditional Cree botanicals, a commercially available Echinacea product, Goldenseal and a traditional Chinese medicine) on the in-vitro activity of human hepatic microsomal-mediated metabolism of OS have been evaluated by Liu et al. (2010) . The findings suggested that there is a potential for health/ herbal supplement used by patients in response to pandemic A/H1N1 to reduce efficacy of OS, however the potential clinical significance of such interaction was not studied. In addition to limited reports on the herb-drug interactions of OS at pharmacokinetics levels, it was found that the potential interaction could also be at the pharmacodynamics level. Pomegranate polyphenol extract has not only demonstrated its invitro inhibition on the replication of human influenza A/Hong Kong (H3N2), but has also shown a synergistic effect with OS (Haidari et al., 2009) .",

Although the absorption and disposition of OS are well identified, the potential effects of herbs/herbal components on these characteristics remain to be investigated. Therefore, we propose to establish an in-vitro screening platform for investigation of the potential herbs/ herbal components that may have pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic interactions with OS. Such screening platform will be based on available knowledge of absorption, disposition and antiviral activities of OS, and built with our existing models of in-vitro enzymatic reactions of liver microsomes, in-vitro transport using cell lines that over-expressed with P-gp, PEPT1 or OAT, and in-vitro plaque-reduction assay.",

The mixtures of viruses and test compounds were incubated at 37\u00b0C under 5% CO 2 for 1 h with gentle shaking several times to allow even mixing. Cells were washed with DMEM containing 0.75 \u03bcg/mL TPCK-treated trypsin and then incubated with 1 mL medium-agar overlay for 48 h. The agar overlay, containing an equal volume of 0.8% melted agarose and 2X MDCK maintenance medium, was kept at 42\u00b0C until adding to wells. After 48 h of incubation at 37\u00b0C, the cell monolayers were fixed with 1% formaldehyde overnight at room temperature, and stained with 0.4% crystal violet for 30 min at room temperature. The number of plaques formed were examined with naked eyes with assistant of a magnifying glass when necessary.",

Since transfected PEPT1 cells are not available, we used a PEPT1inhibitor, Gly-Sar, to inhibit PEPT1 and to check if co-incubation with herbs/herbal components could decrease the uptake of OS. The inhibition results are shown in Fig. S5 . When adding the inhibitor, the uptake amount of OS was significantly lowered.

As shown in Fig. S6 , no difference was observed between HEK293-Mock and HEK293-OAT3 cells for the update of OS, suggesting that OS is not a substrate of OAT3 transporter.

These data were analyzed using non-compartmental analysis ( Table S3 ).

As shown in Fig. 2 (left) , the final model was a four compartmental PK model (two compartments for OS and OSA distribution, and another two to represent the reservoirs of OS and OSA in urine) with two absorption compartments (one for directly absorbed amount of OS and one for first-pass eliminated amount of OS). OS was absorbed from deposit compartment into the central compartment via a first-order process (k a ) and the disposition of OS and OSA could be described by a one-compartment model. The reported volume of distribution for OS and OSA in rats were 3.1 and 1.3 L/kg, respectively, with a ratio of 2.42 (equal to 3.1 divided by 1.3). Thus, in the final model the distribution volume of OS is V d and that of OSA is assumed to be V d /2.42. The formation of OSA from OS was either from first-pass metabolism or from the OS in the central compartment via CL m . To determine if co-administration with RS could lead to different structural parameters (k a , CL m , V d , FP, Fig. 1 . Heat map of z-transformed fold-change results (z-scores) for (1) in-vitro inhibition of OS hydrolysis in rat plasma (RP), rat liver microsomes (RLM) and human recombinant carboxylesterase 1 (hCE1); (2) modification on P-gp, PEPT1, OAT3 mediated transport by herbs (H1 to H8) and herbal components (C01 to C10). Y. Zhang, et al. Journal of Ethnopharmacology 243 (2019) 112097 BIO, k e,OS , k e,OSA ), in the modeling development process, models with identical or different structural parameters among the three groups were tried and compared. Only when the dropped OFV is bigger than 3.84 (p < 0.05), these structural parameters were thought to be significantly different after co-administration with RS (Table 1 ). It was found that co-administration with RS had no effect on the absorption rate constant (k a ) and metabolic clearance (CL m ) of OS, but would decrease V d and increase the remaining structural parameters (FP, BIO, k e,OS , k e,OSA ). Inter-individual variability (IIV) were successfully estimated for parameters CL m , V d and k a. However, for other structural parameters, IIV tend to be zero with a shrinkage close to 100%. In the error model, both additive and proportional errors were added to the observed values from plasma and urine, respectively. Due to the RSE of additive errors were high than 50%, the additive errors were fixed to be zero and only proportional errors were included in the final model. We also tried to use only one proportional error parameter for both plasma and urine data, but this led to an increased OFV of 8.2. Goodness-of-fit plots showed good agreement between predicted and observed concentrations/amounts with no apparent bias in residual (Figs. S9 and S10). The VPC result for the final model is presented in Fig. 3 . Overall, the 2.5th, 50th and 97.5th percentiles of observed concentrations were within the predicted 95% confidence interval (CI) of these percentiles, suggesting accurate model fitting across different interference groups. Bootstrapping resulted in median parameter estimates and 95% CIs like the estimates from the original dataset, indicating that the final model provided good precision for parameter estimation (Table 1) .",

Plentiful and meaningful information was obtained in different levels and varied degrees. The metabolic inhibition studies performed in rat plasma suggested that all the herbal extracts (500 \u03bcg/mL) and all the herbal components (100 \u03bcg/ mL) could inhibit the hydrolysis of OS in rat plasma, but the % inhibition rate varied between herbs/herbal components. Unexpectedly, we noticed different inhibition trends for C4 and C1 in microsomes and purified enzymes (hCE1) incubation studies. C4 showed the strongest Fig. 2 .

            "text": "Estimation ( inhibition of OS hydrolysis in rat plasma, but no inhibition in microsomes and hCE1 systems. Among the herbal components, herbal component C1 was the strongest inhibitor for OS hydrolysis in microsomes and hCE1 while in rat plasma it ranked behind C4, C6 and C10. The composition and enzymes in rat plasma are much more complex than those in microsomes and hCE1. Major esterases in plasma are butyrylcholinesterase (BChE), paraoxonase (PON), and carboxylesterase (CES) (Bahar et al., 2012) . The most abundant plasma protein is albumin, which occasionally shows hydrolyzing activity. Esterified compounds are hydrolyzed by these major plasma proteins via different catalytic mechanisms. The hydrolase activities in rat plasma may be originated from more than one kind of enzymes (not only hCE1) and the inhibition activities of these herbal components to each kind of hydrolysis enzymes are different. More work will be performed to clarify the inhibition mechanism of each herbal component. Since the data from the six in-vitro experiments have different units and intensity ranges, they cannot be compared directly. Our current proposed method is to first convert the raw values of each experiment to fold change (FC) of their control groups and then normalize the FC values of each experiment with z-transformation to make the results with different nature comparable between experiments. Fold change is a measure describing how much a quantity changes going from an initial (control) to a final value and is often used in analysis of gene expression data in microarray and RNA-Seq experiments, for measuring change in the expression level of a gene (Tusher et al., 2001) . In our experiments, FC could be considered as the contribution of herbs/ herbal components in each experiment. The more FC is far from one (bigger or less than 1), the more likely the studied herbs/herbal components have an HDI with OS. However, FC still could not be compared between experiments due to varied FC ranges in each experiment. Inspired by multivariate statistical methods (Varmuza and Filzmoser, 2009 ), we chose z-transformation, a common normalization method, to normalize the FC values in each experiment to make them having the same distribution of N(0,1). After such a normalization, the absolute zscore of an herb/herbal component effect on OS would be proportional to its level of HDI relevancy with OS. Thus, the sum of all the absolute zscores for each herb/herbal component in the six in-vitro experiments would be an indicator for their HDI potential.",

It indicated that co-administration of RS extract with OS could significantly increase the systemic exposure of OS and decrease the systemic exposure of OSA, which is consisted with those observed when co-administration of CMF1 (herbal formula containing RS) with OS (Zuo et al., 2009 ). The plasma samples from G1 to G6 were further evaluated on influenza virus H1N1 and H3N2. The herb-only groups (G4 and G5) showed no virus plaque reduction effect. All oseltamivir groups (G1, G2 and G3) could significantly reduce the number of plaques for virus H1N1 and H3N2, but no addition effects were observed when co-administration of OS with RS extracts. The reason that interactions between OS and RS were only observed in pharmacokinetics not pharmacodynamics could be due to different time-points in our current PK and PD evaluations. For PK studies, plasma concentration data from 10 time-points were used, while only one time-point at 2.5 h after oseltamivir administration were used for the PD study. According to the PK profiles for G1, G2 and G3, the concentration of OSA around 2.5 h were approximately calculated using the mean values of those at 2 h and 3 h. The calculated OSA concentrations at 2.5 h for G1, G2 and G3 are 719.4 \u00b1 416.8, 502.8 \u00b1 83.7 and 460.4 \u00b1 143.5 ng/mL, respectively.

            "text": "1) PK of OS exhibited a flip-flop kinetics after oral administration as evidenced by a much slower k a (absorption rate constant) than its k e,o (elimination rate constant) shown in Table 1 . Thus, the slow terminal phase of OS in Fig. 2 (right) would represent the absorption rather than elimination of OS. Therefore, the observed elimination phase of OS in G1 but not in G2 and G3 suggested that the elimination rate of OS is too fast to be captured after co-administration with RS. 2) BIO (absorbed fraction) and FP (fraction that escaped first-pass metabolism) were successfully estimated with the urine PK data when the intravenous PK of OS for OS only (G1) and co-administration groups (G2 and G3) are not available. The assumption to use urine PK to estimate BIO is that all (or majority) of the absorbed OS would be collected in urine in the form of OS or its metabolite (OSA), which has already been verified in rats and human studies (He et al., 1999) . The estimated BIO of OS after 5-days administration of OS in G1 is 23.6%, slightly lower than its reported oral bioavailability (35%) in rats after single dose of 10 mg/kg of OS (Li et al., 1998) . Moreover, our current modeling method of integrating plasma and urine PK has an advantage of using less rats (no IV groups needed). As shown in Table 1 , after co-administration with RS, BIO of OS increased by 62% without change in its absorption rate (k a ), which suggested that RS would increase the absorbed fraction of OS through inhibiting P-gp efflux as evidenced in section 3.2 rather than changing its permeability. Although RS could also increase FP by inhibiting hydrolysis of OS during its absorption process, its inhibition on systemic hydrolysis of OS is not significant (unchanged CL m ) due to the relative small amount of absorbed RS components and the ubiquitous distribution of CES1 in rat plasma (Furihata et al., 2005) .",

This is mainly caused by the decreased volume of distribution (V d ) of OS. Such changed V d may need further verification by collecting intravenous data for rats in G2 and G3. 4) The pop-PK model could separately estimate the metabolic clearance (CL m ) and renal clearance (k e,os* V d ) of OS. The total body clearance of OS (CL m /0.25+ k e,os* V d /0.25) estimated by our model is 1.015 L/h/kg, which is comparable with the reported clearance of 1.8 L/h/kg after intravenous injection of 10 mg/kg OS in rats (Li et al., 1998) . After co-administration with RS, renal clearance rather than metabolic clearance of OS increased by 48.5% (from 0.62 to 0.92 L/h/kg), suggesting that RS could accelerate the elimination of OS from body, which warrants further in-vivo verification by intravenous pharmacokinetics of OS after five days oral co-administrations of OS with RS.",
