Empirical evidence demonstrates that once the regime intercept is included, the asymmetric effects of global sentiment on oil & gas, financials, and health care industry returns become less under optimism, as compared with under pessimism. More critically, the positive (negative) impact of global sentiment above (under) the threshold turns significant, indicating that global optimism leads industry returns to be overvalued, while pessimism leads them to be undervalued. For local market sentiment, our results support that higher local sentiment enhances the returns of basic materials, telecommunications, and utilities industries. The empirical results confirm that the nexus of industry returns and investor sentiments is subject to change between different sentimental intervals.",

Few studies investigated how the firm valuation is affected by investor sentiments in both global and local markets perspectives. Assuming that investors buy more stocks when they are optimistic than when pessimistic, we propose that different degrees of investor sentiment affect the valuation of specific industries. Additionally, investors may fully account for the relevant conditions within local and global equity markets when implementing industry-based investment strategies. Existing research studies are scant in the area of a nonlinear/asymmetric relationship between investor sentiment and expected industry returns for Asian economies with industry-level analysis, and this study looks to fill this gap.",

In a panel framework, the number of available observations greatly increases when examining the relationship of return-sentiments, and as a result, more informative data can be obtained. Therefore, panel-based investigations can help benefit statistical power and overcome the low power problem. Our quantitative local sentiment indices follow 11 Asian stock markets' degree of liquidity. We employ a global sentiment index through the liquidity of the world equity index. Based on the predictive regression model, we estimate panel fixed-effect regressions, in which the sentiment effect relies on industry-based data across 11 markets. 1 For individual investors, knowledge of the relative sensitivities of industry stock returns to global and local sentiments would be of great benefit for risk management purposes.",

Consequently, it is restricted to implement arbitrage trading strategies. Therefore, the returns for Asian markets are subject to investor sentiment more than developed markets. Previous studies related to stock returns and investor sentiment have focused on single country, such as Simpson and Ramchander (Australia, 2002) ; Chelley-Steeley and Siganos (UK, 2004) ; Tsuji (Japan, 2006) , and Arquette et al. (China, 2008) . To the authors' best knowledge, this is the first research to address countries within the relationship between regional and global sentiment and stock returns using the panel data framework. Baker et al. (2012) apply a linear regression model to construct investor sentiment indices for six major stock markets as a global index. They find that investor sentiment plays a significant role in international market volatility. Using a panel fixed-effect model, Bathia and Bredin (in press) examine the relationship between investor sentiment and G7 stock market returns. Easaw and Ghoshray (2008) employ threshold models and find asymmetric behavior and a cyclical nature of consumer sentiment in the U.S. and UK. Marcucci and Quaglianriello (2009) point out that panel threshold regression models allow different regime effects which are identified by the endogenous threshold value. Based on the above-mentioned literature, our paper applies the nonlinear panel threshold models with and without regime intercept in order to analyze the asymmetric relationship between industry returns and investor sentiment. Assuming that linear relationships may hinder some critical features of stock market riskiness, we seek empirical evidence for the asymmetric behavior of various industry returns across different sentiment regimes. This paper presents some new features that are not necessarily shared by existing studies. First, we offer a first attempt to examine how industry returns are affected by both global and local market sentiments. Baker et al. (2012) find that both global and local sentiments contain distinctly and statistically significant predictive power, and global sentiment is marginally more important than local sentiment. Chang et al. (2011) confirm that global sentiment explains future returns of global portfolios via a proxy global sentiment through a U.S. investor sentiment index. Baker et al. (2012) decompose the six total sentiment indices into a single global index and six local indices. Unlike prior sentiment studies which applied indices composed by regional single economy, the present article uses the world indices.",

            "text": "Second, mounting evidence suggests that the relationship between sentiment and stock returns is more complex. In particular, the marginal impact of sentiment on returns may differ for high-and low-sentiment regimes (optimism and pessimism). McMillan (2003) and Lee and Chiu (2012) show that financial markets may be characterized by nonlinear behavior resulting from the presence of market frictions, transaction costs, and the interaction between informed and \"noise\" traders. The prospect theory can account for the asymmetric behavior in which individuals derive values from gains and losses with respect to a reference point, and individuals' value functions are asymmetric in gains and in losses (Kahneman and Tversky, 1979; Lee and Zeng, 2011) . Empirically, Ding et al. (2004) and Zhang and Semmler (2009) apply the prospect theory on asset pricing. Their study finds that stock returns react much stronger to optimism, but less to pessimism, implying the presence of investor loss aversion whereby they are reluctant to realize their losses. Some studies also find the importance of threshold effects in the financial field, e.g., Ivanov et al. (2011), Chang and Su (2010) , Lee and Chiu (2012) , and Chang and Lee (2012) . We employ Hansen's (1999) panel threshold model without a regime intercept and a modified version of this with a regime intercept introduced by Bick (2010) to explore the sentiment-industry returns' linkage. This allows us to estimate the threshold levels and the nonlinear impact of sentiment on industry returns in the various regimes.",

Hence, if the nonlinear relationships between investor sentiment and industry returns can gain powerful support, then these outcomes will be beneficial for financial analysis. We find notable differences between the results obtained from global and local market sentiments. Regarding global sentiment for oil & gas (OIL), financials (FIN), and health care (HEA) returns, once the regime intercept is included and when global sentiments are optimistic, the positive impact of sentiment on industry returns becomes significant. For the local sentiment-returns nexus, some of the younger, speculative industries, such as HEA, FIN, and Technology (TECH), fit a linear model better, compared with a nonlinear model. By focusing on nonlinear model, the results herein support that optimistic local sentiment enhances the returns of basic materials (MATS), telecommunications (TELE), and utilities (UTIL) industries.",

One exception is Kaplanski and Levy (2010) who find that during aviation disasters, market sentiment has a larger effect on less stable industries, such as the Hi-TEC industry, while utilities is the least affected one. 2 Most papers have attempted to answer why some specific stocks or countries are impacted differently by sentiment. For instance, Wurgler (2006, 2007) declare that speculative stocks are more sensitive to investor sentiment. Schmeling (2009) reveals that the impact of sentiment on stock returns is higher for countries which have less market integrity and which are culturally more prone to herd-like behavior and overreaction. In contrast, our study focuses on how industries are affected by the local market and global sentiments for 11 Asian markets. Fig. 1 portrays our research concept. Wurgler (2006, 2007) determine that when investor sentiment is low, subsequent returns are much higher for low capitalized, smaller, young, highly volatile, unprofitable, non-dividend-paying, speculative companies with extreme growth potential or distressed stocks. When sentiment is high, such categories of stock earn relatively low subsequent returns. By contrast, \"bond-like\" and safer stocks are less driven by sentiment. The value of a firm with a long earnings history, tangible assets, and stable dividends is much less subjective, and thus its stock is likely to be less affected by fluctuations in the propensity to speculate (Baker and Wurgler, 2006) . 3 Fink et al. (2010) affirm that young firms explain most of the spike 3 Baker and Wurgler (2006) state that sentiment is defined by a higher demand for more speculative securities.

Our main motivation for this research angle is to see whether young, unprofitable, or experiencing extreme growth industries (such as TECH, TELE, and HEA) 4 are more affected by investor sentiment, since such industries are difficult to value, making biases more insidious and misestimated. Likewise, are conventional industries, e.g. UTIL and OIL, 5 which possess bond-like and safer features, less affected by sentiment? If yes, then we can deduce that more speculative industry returns should co-move more with sentiment changes. Baker et al. (2012) find that during the global financial crash of 2007-2008, the MSCI World Index of developed markets fell about 50%, emerging markets fell 66%, while the Chinese local market index dropped 71%. Such large crashes may be explained by less catastrophic (and perhaps greater) declines in global returns where capital flows and market contagion represent the mechanism by which global sentiment develops and propagates. In other words, a crash sways differently between countries and areas. Baker et al.'s (2012) findings validate that both global and local sentiments play a role in crosssectional returns, yet they contain distinct and statistically solid predictive power. Brown et al. (2002) explore that there are both foreign and domestic sentiment factors in Japan, suggesting that it is important to account for the significance of investor sentiment outside the domestic country. Chang et al. (2011) demonstrate that the global sentiment impact tends to be further strengthened when local sentiment is high. Hence, our paper considers both global and local sentiments and is able to gather comprehensive sentiment evidence that spans diverse industries in Asian countries. Baker and Wurgler (2006) investigate which stocks are most affected by sentiment using panel regressions. Kaplanski and Levy (2010) utilize regression to study which industries are most affected by aviation disasters. Utilizing panel regressions, Schmeling (2009) demonstrates what type of country is most influenced by sentiment. While the vast majority of existing works examine stock returns' predictability in a linear model, there is increasing evidence that stock returns may be better characterized by a model that allows for nonlinearity (Abhyankar et al., 1997; McMillan, 2003) . Chung et al. (2011) challenge the common assumption made that investors consistently deal with uncertainty. McMillan (2003) validates that, due to the interaction of noise and arbitrage traders, stock returns are inherently nonlinear, whereby market reactions differ between small and large returns. Yet, most related studies do not take asymmetric effects of investor sentiment into account.",

Please refer to Section 3 for data description. analysis with a linear panel regression of sentiment on industry returns with country-specific fixed effects. Second, we employ the heteroskedasticity-consistent Lagrange multiplier (LM) of Hansen (1999) to test the null hypothesis of the linear assumption. Third and finally, examining the relevance of sentiment thresholds for industry returns by applying a modified Hansen's version of the panel threshold model introduced by Bick (2010) enables us to estimate the threshold levels and the marginal impact of sentiments on returns in the regime. Hansen (1999) implements the panel threshold regression model to investigate for threshold effects and to search for two or more regimes endogenously. Based on the prospect theory, our paper assumes that there is a reference point of sentiment and uses the panel threshold model to estimate the impact of sentiment on industry returns. We take up the panel threshold model to examine whether there exists a threshold effect between sentiment and industry returns, to search for regimes endogenously, and then to estimate the effects of different sentiment regimes on industry returns.",

Due to the requirement of panel monthly data and availability limitations, we use employment volume for China, HK, Japan, South Korea, Malaysia, Taiwan, and Thailand; unemployment volume for India and Singapore; and exports in US dollars for Indonesia and the Philippines. Table 3 reports the descriptive statistics and correlations of industry returns (RN), local market sentiment (SE), global sentiment (MS), and a proxy for business cycle (BC). Panel A presents the time-series averages of the cross-sectional means and standard deviations for 10 industries among 11 Asian countries over 180 months from January 1996 to December 2010. Panel B shows the correlations between variables related to sentiments and fundamentals. Table 3 shows that nine of the 10 RNs are significantly positively correlated with SE and significantly negatively correlated with BC, 10 while all of the ten RNs are negatively correlated with MS. Asian SE is negatively related with MS, while considerably positively correlated with BC. The high positive correlations, which are approximately 0.5, between BC and SE indicate a possible feedback effect between the two. The low correlation between SE and MS suggests that two sentimental variables represent the unique feature that is independent from each other.",

The parameter c i allows for the possibility of country-specific fixed effects. Wurgler (2006, 2007) pinpoint that when sentiment is low, the subsequent returns are considerably higher for speculative stocks. Under optimism, the speculative stocks earn relatively low subsequent returns. In other words, periods of higher investor optimism tend to be followed by lower future returns, which are more pronounced for stocks that are hard to price and thus difficult to arbitrage. Dridi and Germain (2004) state that the impact on prices is nonlinear with a bullish/bearish information structure, which is broadly consistent with empirical evidence. Frey (2009) notes that under noisy asset information, the pricing of securities leads to a nonlinear problem. Empirically, there is overwhelming evidence of nonlinearity in asset pricing across international stock markets. For example, Scheinkman and LeBaron (1989) and Hsieh (1991) provide early evidence of the existence of nonlinear phenomena in financial markets. Gallant et al. (1993) argue that there is no reason to believe that the relationship between asset prices is only linear, or that the absence or presence of a linear relationship precludes the existence of a nonlinear one. Furthermore, they pinpoint that more can be learned about asset pricing by focusing on both linear and nonlinear relationships. Obstfeld and Taylor (1997) , and Lee and Chang (2012) explain the nonlinear adjustment process of asset prices using threshold models. Hansen (1999) argues that the threshold model specifies that individual observations can be divided into classes based on the value of an observed variable. Chen et al. (2003) construct a threshold model to highlight the asymmetric impact of news to an equity market. Thus, we turn to discuss the nonlinear link between stock returns and sentiment in the following subsections.",

Coefficients \u03b2 1 (\u03b2 2 ) and \u03b2 0 1 (\u03b2 0 2 ) denote the respective marginal effect of sentiment on industry returns in the low (high) sentiment regime, i.e., when sentiment is below (above) the estimated threshold value. For instance, parameter \u03b2 1 ( \u03b2 0 1 ) is the change in returns related to sentiment levels below the threshold. As such, a positive value indicates that as sentiment moves towards the threshold value, the returns tend to increase. More specifically, a positive \u03b2 2 (\u03b2 0 2 ) means that periods of higher investor optimism tend to be followed by higher returns for the industry. The dependent variable RN it+1 is future industry returns for country i at time t+1. The threshold parameter \u03b3 (\u03b3 '), which is the threshold value of sentiment level at time t and for industry i, needs to be estimated as well. The individual specific effects are eliminated using the standard fixed-effects transformation, implying for the identification of \u03b2 1 (\u03b2 0 1 ) and \u03b2 2 (\u03b2 0 2 ) that the elements of SE it (MS t ) are neither time-invariant nor add up to a vector of one.

According to Bick (2010) , ignoring intercepts can lead to biased estimates of both the thresholds and the corresponding marginal impacts. The latter case applies to regime intercepts, which are usually included in each regime in threshold models for pure cross-sectional or time-series contexts.

Interestingly, only TECH returns present an insignificant negative relationship with local sentiment, which is consistent with Baker and Wurgler's (2006) finding that sentiment is negatively related with subsequent returns for stocks that are considered highly speculative. We notice that the TECH-and-sentiment negative relationship occurs also for our global sentiment and business cycle analyses.

After controlling for economic fundamentals, the residual from Eq. (1) is expected to be a purely irrational element in sentiment, uncorrelated with shocks to industry returns. However, the limitations of Eq. (1) are that heterogeneous effects in different sentiment regimes cannot be analyzed. The plausible nonlinearity in investor sentiment impact on expected industry returns and the asymmetry between high-and low-sentiments also cannot be taken into account and may generate bias. Hence, the next two subsections discuss the results of asymmetric sentiment-return nexuses.",

Hence, markets tend to behave similarly during times of high volatility (Sandoval and Franca, 2012) . To sum up Table 5 through Table 8 , we examine the impact or the degree of local market sentiment on industry returns for a wide range of Asian countries at different levels of sentiment. The magnitudes of the impact of SE and MS on industry returns in those two regimes are not the same. Investors act differently during high and low SE and MS. Tables 5 and 6 show that sentiment SE has a significant impact on industry returns in the under and above sentiment thresholds. Note that expected returns react much stronger to optimism, compared with pessimism, indicating the presence of investor loss aversion when they are reluctant to realize their losses. We further observe asymmetry in the impact of sentiment on industry returns, whereby investors are reluctant to realize their losses. Although we do not claim that the prospect theory leads to investors' reaction on returns, the asymmetry within the impacts of optimism and pessimism on industry returns bears similarity to the reference point and value function of the prospect theory, where gains and losses have an asymmetric impact on the value of a prospect. The results reveal that higher local sentiment enhances the returns of MATS, TELE, and UTIL industries, while higher local sentiment decreases returns for GDS and SVS.",

Generally speaking, our findings are similar to Brown and Cliff (2005) , Kumar and Lee (2006) , and Wurgler (2006, 2007) in which when investors are optimistic about the prospects for stocks, the stocks will sell at a premium, and vice versa. Specifically, when sentiment is estimated to be high, industries are attractive to optimists and speculators. Compared with global sentiment, the linkages between local sentiment and future industry returns are mixed. We deem that there are diverse features of firms in an industry; the features of firms may trade off each other, thus obscuring possibly negative connections. The asymmetry in the impact of pessimistic and optimistic sentiments on stock returns bears similarity to the value function of the prospect theory, where gains and losses have an asymmetric impact on stock returns. This study has several implications. First, the diverse impacts of local and global sentiments on expected industry returns need to be carefully analyzed for international analysts and investors. Second, both investor and entrepreneurial firms could consider the certain threshold value of sentiment as being interdependent with industry returns when evaluating the timing of sector rotation and investment in order to avoid problems associated with either underinvestment or overinvestment. Therefore, keeping investor sentiment above the threshold has a strong beneficial effect. Third, we provide empirical evidence of the prospect theory from the asymmetric stock return effects of sentiment from the industry perspective. Fourth, the empirical findings confirm the importance of including a regime intercept from a statistical and economical perspective on the relations between sentiment and industry returns. Finally, policy makers or regulatory agents, who want to stabilize equity markets and reduce volatility, should be aware of the certain threshold value of sentiment for a specific industry followed by the potential for irrational exuberance.",

First, it would be worthwhile to consider more classifications for the investor sentiment variable so that the findings might be more parsimonious. Second, the empirical set-up of the current study controls for the effect of further variables on industry returns, but does not account for the interrelationships between industries. One example is basic materials in China, which is quite a strong industry that may affect the other related industries in adjacent countries due to supply chain effects. The identification of industries that are interrelated with specific sentiment thresholds in the sentiment-return nexus might provide useful information about the appropriate location and width of a sentiment arbitrage band. Third, there are certainly other factors that influence sector returns, such as institutions (Billmeier and Massa, 2009) , currency markets (Fedorova and Saleem, 2010) , and market liberalization (Chen and Lu, 2007) , and thus future research may include more variables for a better understanding of such important issues. Finally, whether the dynamic panel model explains the industry returns-sentiment nexus better seems worthy of further research. We leave those extensions for the future.",
