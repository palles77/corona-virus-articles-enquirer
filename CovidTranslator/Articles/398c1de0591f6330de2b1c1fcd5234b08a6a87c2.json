In this study, we investigated molecular epidemiology, showed genetic diversity, and analyzed phylogenetic relationships of Korean PEDV field isolates with other PEDV reference strains. Genetic analysis of the complete M and ORF3 genes showed that each PEDV group had several unique characteristics, and this indicated that specific groups of PEDVs may be differentiated from the other PEDVs by specific nucleotide differences. Especially, ORF3 gene analysis can be used for discrimination between vaccine and wild-type PEDVs. Sequence and phylogenetic analysis showed that recent, prevalent Korean PEDV field isolates have close relationships to Chinese field strains and differ genetically from European strains and vaccine strains used in Korea. These results raise questions as to whether a new type of PEDV vaccine may be necessary for preventing PEDV infection more effectively in Korea.",

The M protein has also been proposed to play a role in a-interferon (a-IFN) induction [14] .

Quite the opposite, their expression might lead to a decrease in viral fitness in vitro, and mutants with inactivated accessory genes are easily selected during serial passage in cell cultures [11, 15, 26, 30] . In field strains, however, accessory genes are generally maintained [8, 11] , and their loss mainly results in attenuation in the natural host [6, 10, 18] . Especially, in the case of PEDV, the ORF3 gene is the only accessory gene, and it has been suggested to be an important determinant for virulence of this virus. Virulence of PEDV can be reduced by altering the ORF3 gene through cell culture adaptation [26] in a manner similar to TGEV [30] , and differentiation of ORF3 genes between the highly cell-adapted viruses and field viruses could be a marker of adaptation to cell culture and attenuation of virus [19, 26] . In addition, differentiation of the ORF3 gene could be a valuable tool for molecular epidemiology studies of PEDV [2, 19, 26] .",

Of these two possibilities, the latter is more likely because the partial S and ORF3 genes of the DBI865 isolate are closely related to those of G1-1 (which is genetically different from the vaccine strains) [20] and group 2 (which are genetically similar to the vaccine strains). This is similar to what was shown for other Korean field isolates used in this study. In the case of the e1642 and M2366 isolates, partial S [20] and ORF3 genes were different from those of the vaccine strains, and the M genes were similar to those of the vaccine strains. The partial S gene of the e1697 isolate differs from that of the vaccine strains [20] , and the M gene is closely related to those of the vaccine strains. However, despite trying several times to amplify the complete M gene of the DBI865 isolate, we did not obtain any amplicons from this isolate, and for that reason, further studies, such as full-length sequencing as well as complete M gene sequencing of the DBI865 isolate, are needed to determine how the DBI865 isolate originated.",

The Korean PEDV field isolates (except DBI865) are also genetically different from the vaccine strains (attenuated DR13, KPED-9 and P-5V), which have been used for prevention of PEDV infection in Korea.
