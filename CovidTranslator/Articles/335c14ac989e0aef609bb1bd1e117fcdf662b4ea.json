Samplings were performed between classroom sessions or on weekends, when students were not present in the classroom, typically between 6-7 PM. The classroom's hightouch surfaces were cleaned Monday through Friday between 6-7 AM with a commercial cleaning solution consisting of nonionic surfactant (alcohol ethoxylates) mixed with an anionic surfactant (sodium xylene sulfonate) by janitorial staff.

Nucleic acids extracted from the spent cell growth media were subsequently analyzed using a GenMark multiplex PCR eSensor XT-8 Respiratory Viral Panel (GenMark Diagnostics, Carlsbad, CA) for virus identification. One human coronavirus 229E (CoV-229E) isolate was thereafter completely sequenced essentially as described by Farsani et al. 5 Separately, the stability of a well-studied CoV-229E strain (VR-740; ATCC) was assessed on 3 different hard surfaces held at 24\u00b0C and 50% relative humidity with fluorescent lights on for 14 h/d (simulating the university classroom ambient light, temperature, and humidity conditions). Briefly, 20 \u03bcL aliquots (3 replicates per day, over a 7-day testing period) containing 2 \u00d7 10 4 plaque forming units of virus were spotted and spread over the surface of sterile 1 cm 2 hard plastic, glass, and stainless steel coupons.

            "text": "We isolated CoV-229E from high-touch surfaces in a university classroom. Others have reported detection of coronavirus genomic RNA on various surfaces in hospitals and dwellings. 6, 7 Taken together, these findings seem counterintuitive because enveloped viruses are more susceptible to environmental stresses, such as radiation, temperature, and relative humidity, than nonenveloped viruses, mostly because of the lipidic nature of their envelopes. 8 Our study of CoV-229E VR-740 survival indicates that the virus is not fully inactivated for at least 7 days after deposition on different environmental surfaces at ambient temperature (24\u00b0C) and relative humidity conditions (approximately 50%) typical of our university's classrooms. This is significant given that the minimum infective dose of respiratory viruses can be very low. 9 Given that the frequently touched surfaces in the classroom were cleaned every morning, isolation of CoV-229E on several days during the sampling period suggests frequent redeposition of the virus on those surfaces or an ineffective daily cleaning regimen. Of all the surfaces tested in the classroom, isolation of infectious CoV-229E from the doorknob is probably of greatest significance because it is always used, and the knob was thoroughly swabbed at each sampling. From a public health perspective, a better choice might be brass instead of stainless steel doorknobs because brass has been reported to be deleterious for CoV-229E; however, quick inactivation on brass may not occur for other viruses. 10 Alcohol ethoxylates, the principal component of the cleaning solution used on the surfaces of the classroom of this study, reduced genomic loads of common respiratory viruses on toys in day care nurseries. Although the effect on virus viability was not investigated in the later study, a decrease in genomic loads of adeno-, rhino-, and respiratory syncytial viruses was reported, but the load of coronavirus, the most prevalent virus group detected on toys, remained unchanged before and after the alcohol ethoxylate intervention. 11 Although a new COV 229E strain was confirmed by sequencing of 1 isolate, and it is tempting to infer 1 person was the source, it is possible that the same virus strain was circulating among the students and that the viruses we detected over many days emanated from various persons. A broader study might include linking the virus to the person(s) shedding the virus. Also, further study on the effects of commonly used cleaning and disinfecting solutions on CoV-229E viability are warranted. Finally, air sampling studies would be an important adjunct; in our study, an inhalation risk was also likely caused by aerosols containing CoV 229E.",
