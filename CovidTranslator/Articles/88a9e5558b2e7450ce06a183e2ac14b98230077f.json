            "text": "Extracellular proteases are crucial regulators of cell function. The family of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) has classically been described in the context of extracellular matrix (ECM) remodelling, which occurs throughout life in diverse processes that range from tissue morphogenesis to wound healing. Recent evidence has implicated MMPs in the regulation of other functions, including survival, angiogenesis, inflammation and signalling. There are at least 25 members of the MMP family and, collectively, these proteases can degrade all constituents of the ECM. As a result of their potent proteolytic activity, abnormal MMP function can also lead to pathological conditions. The most widely studied disease that involves MMPs is cancer metastasis. In this case, the tumour cell is thought to use MMPs to overcome multiple structural barriers and establish a new focus of growth at a distant site from the primary tumour mass. In the nervous system, MMPs have also been associated with pathogenesis, particularly in multiple sclerosis (MS) and malignant gliomas 1 . A growing literature has linked MMPs to stroke, to Alzheimer's disease and to viral infections of the central nervous system (CNS). The goal of this review is to acquaint the reader with the biology of MMPs, particularly the functions of MMPs that are not associated with matrix turnover. We will highlight the roles of MMPs in pathology of the nervous system, and emphasize the fact that MMPs can also have physiological functions during CNS repair and ontogeny. Last, we will discuss the function of another group of metalloproteinases -ADAMs (a DISINTEGRIN and metalloproteinase) -in CNS pathophysiology, as these proteins might be responsible for many of the activities previously ascribed to MMPs.",

Most ADAMs have a prodomain, a metalloprotease region, a disintegrin domain for adhesion, a cysteine-rich region, epidermal-growth-factor (EGF) repeats, a transmembrane module and a cytoplasmic tail (FIG. 1) . So, ADAMs are unique among cell-surface proteins in having both adhesive and proteolytic activities. The cysteine-rich region and EGF repeats are thought to mediate cell fusion or the interaction of ADAMs with other molecules such as chaperone proteins. The cytoplasmic tails of ADAM9 and -12 interact with protein kinase C and with src, respectively, implicating some ADAM family members as signalling molecules 5,6 . Although most ADAMs are transmembrane proteins, some members (for example, ADAM11, -12, -17 and -28) also have alternatively spliced forms that diverge before the transmembrane module to generate a soluble, secreted protein. It is important to note that only about half of the ADAM family members have a metalloproteinase domain that contains the catalyticsite consensus sequence, indicating that, in ADAMs domains (FIG. 1) : an amino-terminal propeptide region, an amino-terminal catalytic domain (which contains the zinc-binding motif) and a carboxy-terminal domain, which has a high level of similarity to members of the HEMOPEXIN family and is involved in ECM substrate binding for many MMPs. The carboxy-terminal hemopexinlike domain is a four-bladed \u03b2-propeller structure that is present in all MMPs except MMP7 and MMP26 (matrilysin and matrilysin-2). A hinge region, which is short in collagenases and long in other MMPs, connects the carboxy-and amino-terminal domains. A short signal sequence ('pre-domain') lies at the amino-terminal end of the protein, before the propeptide region, and is clipped off as newly synthesized MMPs travel to the cell surface. Last, unlike other MMP groups, the six MT-MMPs are membrane proteins. MT4-MMP (MMP17) and MT6-MMP (MMP25) are glycosyl-phosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored MMPs (REF. 3), whereas the other MT-MMPs are transmembrane proteins.",

Four TIMPs are now known and they cause inactivation by binding to the catalytic site of MMPs. Interestingly, TIMPs are also required for the activation of some MMPs. In this regard, a complex formed by TIMP2 and the carboxyl terminus of pro-MMP2 has been found to bind MT1-MMP (MMP14) on the cell surface. An adjacent MT1-MMP molecule then removes the propeptide region of MMP2 (REF. 16 ). The pro-MMP-TIMP-MT-MMP trimolecular complex highlights another feature of MMP regulation: the active proteinase is found focally in the pericellular region, rather than being diffusely distributed. In addition, other means also exist to localize MMP activity to the pericellular region. For example, activated MMP2 can bind the \u03b1v\u03b23 integrin, whereas active MMP9 can interact with the HYALURONAN receptor CD44 on the cell membrane 17 .",

So, as with MMPs, these ADAMs might be activated by the cysteine switch mechanism that disrupts the cysteine-zinc interaction to expose the catalytic site. ADAMs might also be regulated at the transcriptional level. For example, interleukin-1 (IL-1) can induce transcription of some ADAM members. Little is known of the physiological that lack metalloproteinase activity, this domain might fill another purpose, such as allowing protein-protein interactions. The expression of six ADAMs (ADAM9, -10, -12, -15, 17 and -19) is widespread.

But despite the limited evidence, ADAMs might be important proteins in the nervous system. At least 17 ADAMs are found in the CNS (REF. 9) and, in fact, some of these are expressed predominantly in the brain (for example, ADAM22 and -23). Furthermore, many pharmacological studies on the role of MMPs have failed to discriminate between MMP or ADAM functions. In particular, many of the inhibitors based on the functional group hydroxamate, which chelate the zinc ion from the active site of MMPs, also have activity against ADAMs (REFS 10, 11) . Last, the thrombospondin motif of ADAMTSs confers degradative activity on several proteoglycans that are enriched in the CNS. Here, we will centre our discussion on two ADAMs, as several lines of evidence indicate their 504 | JULY 2001 | VOLUME 2 www.nature.com/reviews/neuro R E V I E W S inhibitors of ADAMs. The crystal structure of the protease domain of human ADAM17 (TACE) shows that, although the active-site cleft is similar to what is found in MMPs, its secondary structure differs. These features might account for the finding that, whereas TIMP3 inhibits TACE, TIMP1 does not. Also, ADAM10 is inhibited by TIMP1 and -3, and by hydroxamates, but not by TIMP2 and -4 (REF. 18 ). So, TIMP3 might be a more general inhibitor of several ADAM family members, including the ADAMTSs. It is not known if more specific, endogenous non-TIMP ADAM inhibitors exist.",

Similarly, the more sensitive polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technique has revealed the expression of MMP2, -3, -7, -9 and -13 in the normal rat spinal cord 20 . But, overall, MMPs are largely absent from the normal CNS and their upregulation has been reported in several neurological disorders and after injury. By contrast, in the case of ADAMs, over 17 family members are normally expressed in the adult CNS (REF. 9 ). For example, ADAM17 has been localized by immunohistochemistry to astrocytes and endothelial cells in adult human brain 21 , whereas ADAM8 has been detected in neurons and oligodendrocytes in the uninjured adult rat CNS (REF. 22 ). However, the literature on the expression of ADAMs in CNS pathology is limited. We will divide our discussion of the role of MMPs and ADAMs in pathology into three parts: their role in neuroinflammation and MS, their involvement in malignant gliomas, and their participation in other neurological conditions such as stroke, viral infections and Alzheimer's disease.",

MMP profiles in serum and in leukocytes are also altered in MS. So, when compared to healthy controls, MS patients show increased MMP9 messenger RNA in leukocytes and elevated MMP9 levels in serum.

Furthermore, some of the fragments of the MMPmediated digestion of myelin basic protein (MBP) can induce EAE when injected into rodents 31, 40 . Also, human MMP9 cleaves human MBP into peptide fragments, one of which is the immunodominant epitope in humans 40 . Another mechanism by which MMPs might promote an inflammatory response is by the conversion of precursor, inactive molecules into their activated forms. Tumour-necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1 -a proinflammatory cytokine with several actions that include oligodendrocyte toxicity -is first made as a 26-kDa membrane-associated protein that requires proteolytic conversion to the fully active 17-kDa protein. Although TACE is known to be the protease that mediates the physiological maturation of TNF-\u03b1 (REF. 41 ), it is clear that MMP7 and MT4-MMP can also efficiently mediate this conversion 42 . Other molecules, such as transforming growth factor (TGF)-\u03b1, IL-6, TNF receptors, L-selectins and FAS LIGAND (FasL), are also synthesized as precursors that require processing by MMPs or ADAMs for maturation. So, in pathological conditions in which local levels of MMPs are high, these molecules might significantly modulate inflammation in the CNS.",

Vos et al. 43 reported that MMP1 is toxic to spinal cord neurons in vitro, and we found a similar neurotoxic effect of MMP2 (REF. 44 ). An alternative mechanism for MMP-mediated death might involve the phenomenon known as 'anoikis' (Greek for homelessness); cells that are attached to an ECM substrate survive through integrin signalling and death ensues when the cell is detached 45 . In principle, MMPs can indirectly cause cell death by degrading ECM and therefore interfering with cell attachment and integrin signalling. Indeed, neuronal death in the hippocampus after kainate-induced seizures in animals has been attributed to proteases that degrade laminin 46 . Finally, it has been noted that MMP7, but not MMP2, -3 or -9, acts on cell-associated FasL to convert it into soluble FasL, which induces apoptosis of epithelial cells 47 .

Three proteases -\u03b1-, \u03b2and \u03b3-secretase -are involved in APP cleavage at different sites to generate A\u03b2 peptides of various lengths 67 . The predominant cleavage is mediated by \u03b1-secretase, and this mode of cleavage is thought to be non-amyloidogenic.

Moreover, it was also suggested that MMP2 had \u03b2-secretase-like activity 70 . Furthermore, the presence of immunoreactive TIMP in plaques of Alzheimer's disease led to the speculation that an MMP was excessively produced or activated in the plaques, as TIMPs have high affinity for MMPs and would therefore localize to sites of protease activity 71 . It was subsequently suggested that the \u03b1-secretase activity was mediated by a non-MMP metalloproteinase, largely on the basis of studies using pharmacological inhibitors 72 . Indeed, there is now good evidence for ADAM10 (REF. 73) and ADAM17 (REF. 74) as \u03b1-secretases. If this proves to be the case, these ADAMs could have a protective action against Alzheimer's disease, as they would funnel APP towards the non-amyloidogenic pathway. It is worthwhile investigating whether the function of ADAMs is deficient or altered in Alzheimer's disease. Recently, hippocampal neurons that are immunoreactive for ADAM1 and -2 were detected in Alzheimer's disease patients but not in age-matched controls 75 .

In humans, elevation of brain MMP9 is detected post mortem within days of infarction and, interestingly, this protein remained elevated in patients that died months after the event 62 . In another report, MMP9 was strongly expressed by neutrophils in tissues from patients up to one week after an infarct, whereas the expression of MMP2 and -7 was less marked. From one week to five years, neutrophils were absent in the lesions and the large number of macrophages present were immunoreactive for MMP2 and -7 (REF. 28 ). The elevated MMP expression might contribute to the tissue destruction in stroke. As noted earlier, MMPs have the capacity to kill neurons (FIG. 2) . Indeed, the intravenous treatment of rats with a neutralizing MMP9 antibody one hour before vessel occlusion reduced infarct size by 28% (REF. 61 ). In addition, the size of infarcts after ischaemia in MMP9-null mice was less than that observed in wild-type controls 63 .",

            "text": "In parallel with myelinogenesis, metalloproteinases also participate in axon elongation (FIG. 3) . Early studies noted the presence of proteolytic activity at neuronal growth cones during attachment and reattachment events 86 . Some of the activity is probably contributed by metalloproteinases, as interference with MMP activity inhibited growth-cone motility 87 . Inducers of neuronal differentiation and axonal outgrowth, such as nerve growth factor, laminin or retinoic acid, enhanced the expression of MMP2, -3 and -9 by dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons, PC12 and neuroblastoma cells 88, 89 . Furthermore, growth cones of PC12 cells that stably expressed MMP3 had a reduced capacity to penetrate a reconstituted basement membrane. In vivo, Drosophila melanogaster flies that carry mutations in the protein Kuzbanian (the mammalian homologue is ADAM10) show axon stalling during development 90 . In a study in which neuritic outgrowth of DRG neurons that grow on top of normal adult nerves was evaluated, the slow neurite elongation was further reduced by treatment with metalloproteinase inhibitors 91 . By contrast, pretreating the nerves with recombinant MMP2 accelerated neurite growth 91 . Further studies led to the conclusion that DRG neurons expressed MMP2 that degraded and inactivated the neurite-inhibiting activity of CHON-DROITIN SULPHATE PROTEOGLYCANS present on nerves, leading to the exposure of permissive laminin for neurite outgrowth 91 . Indeed, cleavage of a specific peptide bond in an ECM molecule leads to profound functional changes in other systems. For example, the cleavage of the Ala586-Leu587 bond in the \u03b12 chain of laminin-5 by MMP2 induced migration of breast epithelial cells by exposing a cryptic pro-migratory site on laminin-5 (REF. 92 ). The biologically active sites in matrix molecules that become exposed after structural or conformational alterations have been called 'matricryptic sites' , and the name matricryptins has been used to describe the resulting ECM fragments that have biological activity. Last, in concordance with the activity of MMP2 on proteoglycans described above, metalloproteinases might be used in the CNS to destroy other inhibitory proteins. C6 glioma cells and fibroblasts transfected with MT1-MMP could digest NI250 (REF. 55 ), a Nogo protein identified as one of the most potent inhibitors of axonal elongation. In this way, some MMPs might act by neutralizing inhibitory proteins for axonal outgrowth.",

The protein NOTCH affects cell-fate decisions in neurogenesis, and both ADAM10 (REF. 81, 82) and ADAM17 (REF. 83) have been shown to activate the notch signalling cascade. Another role for MMPs in CNS development might lie in myelinogenesis, the process whereby oligodendrocytes extend several processes from their soma that reach and enwrap axons to form myelin. The initial expansion of oligodendroglial processes is immense and could require remodelling of the brain matrix by MMPs. This hypothesis has been tested and oligodendrocytes were found to express MMP9 during the period of myelinogenesis. Furthermore, the inhibition of MMP activity in vitro prevented the extension of oligo-508 | JULY 2001 | VOLUME 2 www.nature.com/reviews/neuro R E V I E W S of MMPs in the adult CNS might involve their potential to affect signal transduction by, for example, linking G-protein-coupled-receptor signalling with the EGF pathway.

Regulation of synaptic plasticity could also be another function of metalloproteinases in CNS injury 77 .

            "text": "The challenges associated with defining the roles of MMPs in the CNS are several-fold. First, it is obvious that metalloproteinases can be both friends and foes in the CNS. We will therefore have to understand the balance between these states and the context that swings the pendulum between beneficial and detrimental roles. Second, a given metalloproteinase might have different properties at a given condition, dependent on factors such as spatial localization and cellular source. For example, MMP9 expressed by a macrophage in the vicinity of myelin might produce demyelination, whereas the same MMP elaborated by oligodendrocytes at the tip of their processes might promote remyelination. In this context, an inhibitor of MMP9 would simultaneously curb both detrimental and reparative processes. So, the challenge is to identify all the functions of a given metalloproteinase in a particular situation and to evaluate if the net result of its inhibition is worthwhile. A third challenge is related to establishing the identity of the metalloproteinase involved in a given function. Many of the pharmacological inhibitors that are available at present lack specificity towards members of a subfamily and will often antagonize the activity of members of different metalloproteinase families 10, 11 . So, when functions are ascribed to particular metalloproteinases, growth cone then overcomes these adhesive forces and breaks away from the ephrin surface. Hattori et al. 93 showed that the adhesive ephrin-Eph interaction is broken in vitro by ADAM10, which becomes activated after engagement of the Eph receptor. Another guidance molecule is netrin 1, which binds a receptor known as DCC (deleted in colorectal carcinoma). When axon outgrowth from embryonic dorsal spinal explants was evaluated in vitro, the facilitatory activity of netrin 1 was potentiated by IC3 and GM6001, hydroxamate metalloproteinase inhibitors 94 . It was found that DCC was shed from the cell surface by the activity of an unidentified MMP; preventing the ectodomain shedding of DCC with a metalloproteinase inhibitor resulted in responsiveness to netrin 1 (REF. 94 ). The recent report of a phenotype-based GENE-TRAP screen to identify genes that control wiring patterns in the mouse CNS further implicates metalloproteinases in axonal guidance. ADAM23 was one of the genes identified in this screening; its inactivation in vivo led to neurological defects, tremor and ataxia 95 .",

By contrast, the favourable functions (if any) of the MMPs that are upregulated in CNS disorders in adulthood are less clear. We have highlighted the detrimental effects of metalloproteinases in the injured adult CNS (FIG. 2) but some beneficial functions are also possible after injury, although they remain speculative at this point. What could they be? First, it is possible that metalloproteinases enable the migration of precursor cells to injured sites to replenish lost cells. A role in facilitating axonal regrowth, remyelination and angiogenesis is also possible on the basis of the functions of these proteases in development, as described earlier. Another possible role NATURE REVIEWS | NEUROSCIENCE VOLUME 2 | JULY 2001 | 5 0 9 bition to treat specific CNS diseases? Given the data that aberrant expression of MMPs is correlated with conditions such as MS, we suggest that the use of metalloproteinase inhibitors is warranted. If factors such as inflammation, which cause the disease to worsen, can be curbed, then the side effects of impairing reparative activities might be a reasonable trade-off. However, much more specific inhibitors and a clearer view of which metalloproteinase member to antagonize would help towards rational therapeutics. In summary, much remains to be learned about the biology and pathology of metalloproteinases in the CNS. We welcome the explosion of this field, as the rewards of an increased understanding would seem to be immense. it has to be clear, not only which metalloproteinase is involved, but also whether one is dealing with the right subfamily of metzincin metalloproteinases. Clearly, the next generation of pharmacological inhibitors must be able to discriminate between subfamilies and between members of each subfamily. Mice with null mutations for specific MMPs and ADAMs are already available and can help to discriminate functions of specific metalloproteinases. However, these valuable resources often show compensatory upregulation of activity of other MMPs as a result of the gene deletion and the analysis of these animals must therefore be interpreted with caution.",

MPs, in turn, regulate neurotrophic factor activity. One mechanism involves the release of growth factors that are anchored to the extracellular matrix (ECM). MPs that are located in the vicinity of growth cones can promote the elongation of axons owing to their ability to remodel the ECM and degrade inhibitory molecules such as the Nogo proteins. By interacting with molecules implicated in axonal guidance, for example, by shedding DCC (deleted in colorectal carcinoma) receptors or by breaking Eph receptor-ephrin bonds, MPs can affect the directional growth of axons.CHONDROITIN SULPHATE PROTEOGLYCANS Important components of the extracellular matrix and connective tissue.

Wee Yong is a central nervous system (CNS) glial biologist and neuroimmunologist whose research has been influenced by two diseases of the CNS: multiple sclerosis and malignant gliomas. Several lines of his investigations have converged on metalloproteinases as mediators of tissue injury or as facilitators of repair. Yong favours the concept that the precise spatial and temporal expression of specific metalloproteinase members in particular cell types determines whether these proteases serve as friends or foes in the CNS.Christopher Power is a clinical scientist, neurologist and neurovirologist, who has been investigating the consequences of viral infections of the central nervous system (CNS). His work has implicated matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) as the mediators of toxicity in the CNS after infections by several viruses, including HIV. The focus of his laboratory is directed towards understanding the mechanisms by which lentiviruses (HIV and FIV) cause neuronal death through the actions of MMPs.Peter Forsyth is a clinical scientist and neuro-oncologist, who has investigated the aberrant expression of matrix metalloproteinases and tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMPs) in facilitating the growth and invasiveness of malignant glioma cells. He has used TIMPs and other metalloproteinase inhibitors in pre-clinical testing in animal models of gliomas. Forsyth has also participated in clinical trials of metalloproteinase inhibitors in gliomas.Dylan Edwards is interested in the roles of matrix metalloproteinases and ADAMs (a disintegrin and metalloproteinase) in normal and pathological tissue remodelling. He focuses on metalloproteinases in angiogenesis and cancer biology, as well as the gene regulation of metalloproteinases and tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases.",

            "text": "\u2022 Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and ADAMs (a disintegrin and metalloproteinase) are part of a larger family of structurally related zinc-dependent metalloproteinases called metzincins. Structurally, MMPs are divided in three domains: an amino-terminal propeptide region, an amino-terminal catalytic domain, and a carboxy-terminal domain that is involved in substrate binding. ADAMs have a prodomain, a metalloprotease region, a disintegrin domain for adhesion, a cysteine-rich region, epidermal-growth-factor repeats, a transmembrane module and a cytoplasmic tail. \u2022 The activity of MMPs is tightly regulated in several ways: at the level of transcription, by post-translational modifications such as proteolysis, and through the action of endogenous tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases. The regulation of ADAMs is less well understood, although there is some evidence that the same three levels of regulation might control ADAM activity. \u2022 MMPs and ADAMs have been implicated in neuroinflammation and multiple sclerosis (MS), in the pathogenesis of malignant gliomas, and in other neurological conditions such as stroke, viral infections and Alzheimer's disease. In the case of ADAMs, their role in these pathological states has begun to be explored, but the available literature is still in its infancy. \u2022 Although the detrimental roles of metalloproteinases are well documented, some of their functions in the central nervous system (CNS) might be beneficial. For example, some metalloproteinases are expressed in the CNS during development, pointing to a possible role in brain maturation. Similarly, metalloproteinases have been implicated in myelinogenesis and axon growth. Furthermore, metalloproteinases are upregulated after injury to the CNS, indicating a possible relevance to tissue repair. \u2022 Several challenges remain in the study of metalloproteinases and their role in brain function. It will be necessary to understand the balance between the beneficial and detrimental roles of MMPs to determine whether they can be used as targets for therapeutic intervention. It will also be important to identify the physiological substrates of the different metalloproteinases, and to develop selective antagonists against the various members of the metalloproteinase families; the lack of such tools constitutes one of the main limitations to the growth of the field at present.",
