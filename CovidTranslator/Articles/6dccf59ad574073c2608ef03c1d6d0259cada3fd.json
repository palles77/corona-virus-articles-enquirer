The main clinical signs are a sudden outbreak of profuse diarrhoea or the occurrence of dark green to black soft faeces with the presence of blood in 5 to 10% of the animals. According to Van Kruiningen et al. (1985) , the diarrhoea is watery or porridge-like with a characteristic smell. Affected animals show respiratory signs such as nasolacrimal discharges or coughing and hyperthermia often precedes the onset of diarrhoea by 24-48 hours.",

It was initially thought that winter dysentery was caused by Kbrio jejuni, now termed Campylobacter jejuni. However, more recent studies ruled out the role of this micro-organism in the aetiology of the disease (Charton et al., 1963; Ale&s et rrl, 1988) . The causative agent was suspected to be a virus by MacPherson (1957) , who reproduced the disease experimentally by inoculating faeces passed through a Seitz filter, although the virus concerned was not isolated. Various viruses have been incriminated, including those responsible for infectious bovine rhinotracheitis or mucosal disease, parainlluenza 3 virus or rotavirus, but these are now all discounted. A coronavirus similar to that responsible for calf diarrhoea was suggested as the causative agent in studies performed in France (Espinasse et al, 1981; 1982) , Sweden (Alenius et al., 1988) , the United States (Van Kruiningen et al., 1985; 1987; Saif et al., 1988) and Japan (Akashi ef al., 1980; Takahashi et al., 1980) .",

Three of the four herds which were affected by a mild form of winter dysentery during the survey belonged to this group.

All three herds in which a severe outbreak was reported during the survey belonged to this group. A characteristic example of the herds regularly affected by winter dysentery (Fwe 2) was that of a small farm with two workers from the farmer's family and less than 20 dairy cows, which specialized in non-intensive milk production, the mean annual production per cow being ~4000 kg. On these farms, milk quality (fat content >3g.6% and protein content >30%) is emphasii more than milk quantity.

Seven additional variables were used to characterize differences between visit Vl and later visits. Visits 1,2 and 16 were not taken into account because very little information was available. The temperature of the stable was much lower than usual on visits 3 and 4 and on visits 11, 12 and 13 ( Figure 3) . The air and water temperatures usually diiered significantly between two visits (Table I) . A strong positive correlation was observed between the temperature of the stable and that of drmking water: the correlation was less marked with the temperature of the diet (Table II) . The air velocity and moisture content variables were not significant. Moreover, the mean level of environmental temperature had little effect since some affected herds exhibited higher mean temperatures in the stable than healthy herds. The reciprocal was also checked.

In mild outbreaks, the maximum decrease in milk production compared to a theoretical lactation curve (Wood, 1%7) ranged between 6 and 11%. The overall production drop persisted for 8 to 15 days, after which former milk production levels were regained. It is noteworthy that when milk production returned to preclinical levels ( Figure 4 ) the observed lactation curve exhibited a rapid rise compared to the theoretical curve. In severe outbreaks the maximum decrease in milk production was 30% and lasted for an average of 2g days. The later return to initial level followed the same pattern as for the mild outbreaks. In late lactation, winter dysentery could lead to premature drying-off. In both cases, the mean fat and protein content of bulk milk declined by 1.5 g/l in the assay performed immediately after the period of diarrhoea. In this evahtation of the economic consequences, the cost of treatment and the indirect effects of weight loss on reproduction performance were not taken into account (Table III) . ",

A recent study by Van Kruiigen et ~2. (1987) , which seemed to demonstrate a marked antigenic relationship between the coronavirus isolated from winter dysentery outbreaks and calf diarrhoea coronavirus, was confirmed by Saif et uZ. (1988) . Nasal discharge is always observed in affected animals. Some other coronaviruses are known to bc involved in respiratory disorders (Thomas et d., 198Z Saif et uZ., 1986) . However, our survey indicates that faccal excretion of viral particles is very rapid and transient. It may even start during the period of hyperthermia prior to any sign of diarrhoea, which could explain the difficulty in detecting a coronavirus in affected cattle (Van Kruiningen et uL, 1985) . It would be advisable to examine the faeces for the presence of virus as soon as the rectal temperature exceeds 3YC. 3n The frequency of outbreaks of the disease in a herd may vary from a few months to 10 years and our observations suggest that immunity may last for two years. In herds reguhuly exposed to the disease the outbreaks wouid be rather miid, whereas when the inter& between recurrences are large (> 3 years) the outbreaks wouId be more severe on an economic basis.",

The epidemiology of winter dysentery in France was associated with the winter months and early lactation in housed cattIe. In contrast with previous studies (Scott et aZ., 1973) , the age of the animaIs was not a determining factor in our study. The sudden drop in body temperature, due for example to drinking water, which precedes the onset of the disease, is in agreement with previous observations made by BuII (1957) , MacPherson (1957) and Johnston (1959) . More recentIy, Stermer et ~2. (1986) demonstrated that the ingestion of 3.9 kg of water at 1\u00b0C by a dairy cow led to a significant decrease in rectaI temperature of 0.3\"C within 20 mm, and it is supposed that the intake of very cold feed or water induces a thermai stress which facihtates the onset of diarrhoea. Moreover, as suggested by CoiIins et aZ. (1987) and by Bugiin et aZ. (1989) , dairy cows may be heahhy carriers of coronavirus, so that a sudden change in the environmentaI conditions may provoke the development of cIiicaI features. These remarks confirm the concept that there is a relationship between the disease and the environment (Dennis, 1986) . The latter may, in some cases, contribute to the transmission of aetiologicaI agents and to reducing the host immune resistance (Dennis, 1986) .",
