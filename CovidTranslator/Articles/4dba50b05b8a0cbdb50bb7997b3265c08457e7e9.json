Through case studies and questionnaire surveys, the characteristics of Japanese travel multinationals are compared to those of manufacturing companies. An ''Ethnic Model'' is developed which explains the unique behavior of these companies. It concludes that they are ethnically characterized in target markets, management styles in foreign subsidiaries, emphases on service, and competitors. Though this study focuses on the Japanese tourism industry, the result is potentially generalizable and applicable to other countries and other non-manufacturing industries.

In 1964, when overseas tourism became liberalized, 127,749 went abroad, and in 2000, the annual number had reached 17.8 million. While ups and downs followed due to wars, terrorism, and epidemics such as SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome), according to the latest statistics available, the number of overseas tourists was 17.4 million in 2005 (Japan National Tourist Organization 2006:493) . Surprisingly, the outbound market grew approximately 140 times in 40 years from its beginnings.

As a result, many multinational companies today seek opportunities to advance into new fields in their overseas strategy. For the maintenance of strategic control and influence on subsidiaries, headquarters build close relationships with foreign subsidiaries (Doz and Prahalad 1981, 1984) .

            "text": "Even in overseas business, Japanese tourism companies take it for granted that Japanese people, people of their own descent, and Japanese companies compose one unit. This situation puts emphasis on shared traditional culture such as language, customs, habits, and fundamental ways of thinking. People who have this historical and cultural similarity are considered as a unified whole. The range of this unit, however, is not exactly in agreement with race or nationality. Since tourism has a close relation to one's lifestyle, companies consider this framework in order to provide a sort of service which tourists can feel comfortable with even if they are traveling abroad and are in a different cultural space. What kind of influence will such customer correspondence have on the international management of the tourism industry? Different from existing multinational theories basically developed through research on manufacturing industries, another type of international administrative behavior emphasizes company-customer relationships in the multinationalization of tourism operations. However, the administrative behavior of multinational enterprises has been analyzed mainly from the viewpoint of headquarter-foreign subsidiary relations. In the supply of services there is a need for customer participation and this is achieved through interaction with tourists as consumers of actual services. Therefore, one should not disregard the company-customer relationship. This paper will analyze tourism companies' international administrative behavior, bearing the existence of the customers in mind. As Japanese firms place emphasis on the company-customer relationships of their own nation-Japanese nationals, people, descendants, and companies-their administrative behavior can be analyzed as-''ethnic'' or ''ethnocentric''-the central issue of this paper.",

First, through case studies and questionnaires their characteristics overseas are compared to those of manufacturing companies. Second, an ''ethnic model'' which shows the unique type of international business behavior that has developed with Japanese multinationals will be constructed. There is a strong incentive for the local suppliers and the destination countries to know about the administrative behavior of the companies which handle their important overseas source markets, and to build continuous business relationships. The conclusion will be helpful for the suppliers to understand and to get on well with the tourism multinationals. Though focusing on the Japanese industry, the results are considered to have generality and will be applicable to other non-manufacturing industries which have a strong connection between headquarters and foreign subsidiaries like banking and trading; or to other countries where people have difficulty in learning foreign languages and the tourism industry is highly structured and generally dominated by large companies (for example, in Korea and Taiwan).",

Interview scripts were prepared for headquarter members, expatriates, and general and branch managers. The average length of each interview was two hours and a half for the manager level employees and half an hour for the others.

So far as Japanese tourism is concerned, five major companies take more than half of the market share and this tendency to concentration is getting stronger. Most of those leading the industry are general companies. They deal with both domestic and overseas tourism, and function as both retailer and wholesaler. The three companies studied here have these characteristics. Major companies also deal with other businesses such as finance, goods sales, publications, tour conductors' employment agency, and so on. Their business range is much broader than that of mere travel agencies and they would be better called ''tourism companies.'' Moreover, these three companies are multinationals. By setting up local subsidiaries, foreign branches, and liaison offices, they have built worldwide networks. In this research, four local subsidiaries will be considered. They are located in the United States (one of the subsidiaries of JTB), Australia (of KNT), Canada (of TTC), and the Netherlands (of KNT). Field surveys were carried out in the United States in December 2004 and in Australia in November 2003 . Observations and interviews were made in the field surveys. Corporate culture, atmosphere of the office, and employees' commitment to work were observed. Each section's job functions were explained by the section managers. Since Japanese multinationals consider the bases in Europe, North America, and Oceania to be the three important supports of their overseas business strategy, it is appropriate to study these local subsidiaries as well.",

Answer forms included multiple choice questions (single or multiple answers possible) and item ranking.

The objective was to provide services for general tourists such as holidaymakers. Local arrangements and operations were entrusted to local tour operators. From doing business in this way, serious problems arose. Complaints and grumbles from the customers increased. The tourists were dissatisfied with the service offered by the local operators and wished to maintain their habits and customs during their trips. Usually sleeping in their own style bedding called futon, and even when traveling foreign countries with wife or husband, they had a strong preference for twin rooms with bathtubs. They preferred the plain taste and sometimes required chopsticks when eating. They asked for the same service as supplied in their home country. But it was hard for the local tour operators to understand Japanese tourists' behavior and ways of thinking. Local operators could not explain and manage affairs well. So the headquarters had to manage and administer the local tour operator from the home country. However, reflecting the means of communication in those days, they could not but depend on telephone, letter, and telex, so real time interchange was difficult. From this experience, KNT decided to set up local offices of their own and station expatriates to take care of their customers directly.",

Collection and accumulation of information and experience on overseas business allowed them to do ''own operation.'' There are three main reasons for tourism companies to start own operation. The first is for customer management. In such firms, a salesperson would use door-to-door approaches to sell and get orders. When a contract was written, the customer became his client and the salesperson was involved in the whole trip, from making the itinerary to conducting the tour. It was natural for them to take care of their customers by themselves. This traditional role and way of thinking has deeply penetrated the business and made it easy for them to perform own operation. The second reason is the prevention of information leakage. By accumulating and analyzing the customer information, KNT is able to create original plans and services which will be the company's competitive advantage in the near future. The third reason is cost reduction. By excluding local operators from the distribution system, they no longer have to pay commission.",

Gaining this status, credit, and bargaining power, KNT tried to run their business as a local company in the host society, with equal relationships with area enterprises and suppliers. As a result, in Kintetsu International Express (Europe), Besloten Vennootschap for example, the major business is inbound tourism dealing with Japanese tourists. The principle of management is a mixture of the Japanese system and the local style. The latter is used in business practices such as wage scale and documentation. Homeland methods are practiced in creating the organizational climate or corporate culture such as time strictness. In Amsterdam, 20% of the employees used to be Japanese and 80% not. However, because of the large volume of Japanese tourists, homeland employees are considered to be more appropriate and their proportion is increasing. Owing to the small scale of the Japanese labor market in Europe, it is hard to employ workers from there, so the assignment of human resources is determined by their talent and positioning. For example, for frontline staff-those who meet the customers, such as guides, conductors, and counter staff-Japanese and Japanese-ancestry staff or at least those who can speak the language are used. For top management who shoulder the decisionmaking, expatriates are used. For back-office staff-those who do not meet the customers but support the service delivery system to make it efficient and effective, such as in accounting and administration-locals are employed (interview with the general manager of international affairs in 1997 and the director in 2003). In the case of Kintetsu International Express (Oceania) Proprietary Limited that supervises both offices in Australia and New Zealand, due to a large Japanese labor market in the area, 79.7% of the employees are Japanese, of which 3.9% are expatriates (field research in 2003).",

            "text": "TTC's advancement to Canada started in 1986 with a liaison office in Vancouver. There were two reasons for this. The major one was the influence of the Tokyu Group: their development plan (The Pacific Rim Plan) was urged by the whole group, and all its companies had to join it. When Pan Pacific Hotel Vancouver, owned by the group's hotel company, was established, TTC also opened its office in the same location. Being one of the five investment companies, it tried to support the hotel by sending tourists to it. Equally, TTC was supported by the hotel. Usually a liaison office is managed by at least two employees, one expatriate and one secretary, but the Vancouver Office could be run by only one expatriate. The hotel secretary held the additional post of secretary of TTC. In light of the overseas advancement in the Tokyu Group, there obviously existed a strong expectation of synergy. The second reason was the increase in the number of tourists. Due to the strength of the yen after the Plaza Accord-an agreement signed in 1985 at the Plaza Hotel in New York by the then G5 nations (France, West Germany, Japan, the United States, and the United Kingdom) to devalue the US dollar by intervening in currency markets-many Japanese manufacturing companies changed their international strategies from exportation to local production, and set up foreign subsidiaries (Yoshihara 2001) . Not only international business trips but also international corporate incentive tours increased in headquarters and their foreign subsidiaries. Further, sightseeing tourists increased. The strong yen made Japanese overseas tourism more affordable than ever before. It was expected that Canada as a country with magnificent natural attractions would become one of the major destinations and that the market would increase continuously. Hoping to succeed in capturing a larger number of tourists and serving them, TTC determined to start their business in Vancouver.",

It was necessary for TTC to make sure that they were providing services as instructed. However, as with KNT, to expand their business and deal with overseas tourism and start wholesale business, after running for seven years as a liaison office, it changed its form to a local corporation in 1993. Two expatriates were sent from Japan and two local staff were employed. One of these was of Japanese descent, proficient in the language, and was assigned to be the operations manager. The other, a non-Japanese with legal expertise, took charge of administration. Though having obtained a business license and permission to deal in outbound tourism, the local subsidiary's major affairs still remained in the area of inbound tourism. It was responsible for reservation of hotels and buses, but control of guides was assigned to local operators. Despite getting the right to initiate outbound business, this subsidiary was too busy with inbound business to tap the local market. Though it was at the frontier of a new growth area, it could not bring the opportunity into play. In 1995, TTC closed its subsidiary and withdrew from Canada. The major reason was the inefficiency of the operation. The actual number of tourists was less than expected. At present, having no offices in Canada, TTC is sending tourists through local operators with an office in Japan.",

The local tax authorities did not accept the overseas business of JTB as non-profit. Since most of the Japanese tourism companies in the United States had incorporated locally, JTB followed. In 1964, all its US offices were reorganized as Japan Travel Bureau International Incorporate (JTBI) so that it could expand its branches and its business field. Adapting to the tourism expansion in its homeland, JTBI began actively to welcome tourists and started its own operation. Nowadays JTBI is divided into three organizations: JTBI, JTB USA, and JTB Travel Network. Each is individually incorporated with a different business orientation. JTBI handles tourists from the home country, JTB USA treats tourism from the United States, and JTB Travel Network designs tours which depart from US cities.

This was mainly adopted by automobile companies and electrical machinery companies. However, the importing countries began to put Japanese companies under pressure. Customs duties and quantity limits were applied to exports, for example. For fear of losing their existing markets, manufacturing companies had to change their overseas strategies from exportation to local production in order to defend and maintain them (Yoshino 1976) . In local production, multinational companies manufactured products for the local markets, and nowadays they are also producing for their homeland and for the worldwide markets (Yoshihara 2001) . The products are adapted and developed to meet demand in the international markets. They are sometimes oriented locally and sometimes standardized worldwide. Though it is not enough, localization of managerial resources in foreign subsidiaries is proceeding; for example, many natives are employed in them (Yoshihara 2001) . The competitors for the manufacturing multinationals are the companies who target the same markets they do.

In terms of the employment in foreign offices, the percentage of Japanese and ancestry employees is relatively high. According to the quantitative data, expatriates count for 13.3%, Japanese and ancestry local staff for 42.1%, and local staff for 44.4% of total employment (Table 1) . Japanese and ancestry people represent more than half of the employees. Looking into employment further, the characteristics of each region, based on the classification defined by the World Tourism Organization, are as follows. In the Americas Region 66.8% of the employees are Japanese or of their ancestry, locally employed. This ratio is relatively higher than in other areas, because Hawaii is included in these totals, an area where many Japanese and people of their ancestry reside. Since the labor market is abundant there, Japanese and people of that descent are available for employment by companies in this area. In the East Asia and Pacific Region, however, 60.3% of the employees are non-Japanese local staff, except in Australasia which is also included in this region, where 61.9% of the employees are composed of Japanese and their ancestry local staff and only 5.7% of the employees are expatriates. On the other hand, in Southeast Asia which is also included in this Region, the employment of non-Japanese local staff is as high as 84.5% and there are as few as 5.1% Japanese and their ancestry local staff. In Europe, although 48.9% of the employees are non-Japanese, 40.3% are Japanese and of their ancestry locally employed. As a result, it can be said that companies tend to employ people of their own nation in any area where they can utilize their people and their ancestry as their laborforce. On the other hand, even with a resident population of Japanese/ancestry, non-Japanese employment tends to increase where firms are unable to utilize ethnic employees as the laborforce, such as where the Japanese residents abroad are expatriates, students, and the like.",

Some 64.6% of the offices appointed expatriates for top management (executives) to communicate and build strong ties with their headquarters, 21.3% assigned local Japanese and their ancestry staff, and only 13.2% adopted local non-Japanese for executives. Progress in localization of top management could not be observed. For frontline staff, 75.7% of the offices employed local Japanese and people of their ancestry, 22.5% placed local non-Japanese, and 2.8% assigned expatriates. As to back-office staff, 50.5% of the offices assigned local non-Japanese because of the need for local knowledge. Of the others, 27.0% employed Japanese and their ancestry staff, and 17.1% employed expatriates. Although there is regional variation reflecting the condition of the local labor market, Japanese tourism companies tend to adopt local Japanese/ancestry for frontline staff. Ability in the use of their mother tongue has become one of the important criteria for establishment of the service. In contrast, within manufacturing companies there is little demand for Japanese workers and hence localization is more important in order to reduce costs and to ease local nationalism. Third, even in foreign countries, the offering of service is considered significant. ''Japanese service'' is of a kind to help homeland tourists keep their habitual ways even when overseas. They make a point of reserving hotel rooms with bathtubs and Japanese-speaking guides. When overseas, they usually feel homesick for their own food and begin to feel distaste for local dishes. So in package tours, a Japanese meal is often built into the last half of the journey. This device is to reflect their clients' demands. Of course, local services which tourists may find exotic are offered, but the companies have a strong focus on a Japanese standard of service and they concentrate on supplying it. This is the opposite of manufacturing multinationals which attempt to standardize their goods globally.",

In this situation Japanese companies will generally not try to enter and compete in the international market, so they may be said to be acting in niche segmentation. In brief, Japanese tourism multinationals operate with a focus on their own nationals who share language, traditions, cultures, and ways of thinking. It is true that whether they belong to manufacturing or non-manufacturing industry, multinational companies operate with the management style of their home country.

            "text": "As a result, the international business behavior of Japanese tourism companies can be expressed with two dimensions: ''Attitudes as Fundamental'' and ''Markets.'' The first dimension, the Attitudes as Fundamental, represents the firm's view on global management. This means how executives think about doing business around the world. This concept was first pointed out in the EPG profile (Perlmutter 1969) and was revised to the EPRG profile (Heenan and Perlmutter 1979) . The model indicates the directions of multinationalism by defining four types of headquarters orientation toward subsidiaries in a multinational enterprise. These types are ethnocentric (E), polycentric (P), regiocentric (R), and geocentric (G). While there are several routes to multinationalism (for example, companies highly motivated to multinationalize may proceed directly from ethnocentric to geocentric), most multinational corporations are considered to evolve from ethnocentrism to polycentrism, (and later, in some geographical areas, to regiocentrism) and finally to geocentrism (Heenan and Perlmutter 1979:21-22) . Ethnocentric is a preference for putting home country people in key positions everywhere in the world and rewarding them more handsomely for work, along with a tendency to feel that this group is more intelligent, more capable, or more reliable. On the other hand, geocentric is an attitude of attempting to integrate diverse regions through a global systems approach to decisionmaking, and considering headquarters and foreign subsidiaries as parts of an organic worldwide entity (Heenan and Perlmutter 1979:17-20) . Ethnocentric and geocentric, the extremes of the attitudes as fundamental, are positioned in the first dimension.",

Thus, this ethnic model is defined as the international business behavior of a firm whose fundamental attitude is ethnocentric and whose target market is a particular ethnic group. This model explains that by focusing on the firm's own ethnic market, its organization, service, and so on would become ethnocentric. In the case of a Japanese enterprise, by bringing its ethnic characteristics into play, its international business behavior will be focused on the Japanese and their ancestry markets.",

Although it narrows the main target to its own ethnic market like the case in cell one, it differs on the point that it is managed not only by its own nation but also by others. Relationships of geocentric-ethnic will be formed. A corporate organization composed of many nations will take all ethnic characteristics and needs into consideration for its one market, but will be able to reduce cost by exploiting local managerial resources, and will transfer and supply superior managerial resources from overseas to cover the resources which do not appear to exist in the local market. Since the service will involve deep consideration of the characteristics of that market, personnel education to improve understanding of the ethnic characteristic of that target market would be important to the company operating in this way. Though the target market is limited in cell two, the managerial attitude takes other nations into account, so it is separated from cell one and labeled ''semi-ethnic.'' Insofar as its operation in Japan is concerned, this cell may be applicable to the Travel Division of American Express, because it employs many local people but it mainly deals with non-Japanese companies.",

            "text": "Cell three is the case of a company with an ethnic attitude in management but which does not focus on a single ethnic market. Although it performs business activities using its own people, this situation differs from that in cell one in that the company broadens the main target to other people and tries to develop new markets. Between these two dimensions, an ethnocentric-non-ethnic relation materializes. Since the market is unlimited, a company belonging to cell three is willing to provide services oriented to each ethnic trait of its customers. However, in reality it is not easy for a company with a single nationality to provide multi-ethnic services. In order to provide such service, it is necessary both to master the language and customs of each market and to understand historically formed backgrounds and biases. Therefore, when it comes to dealing with multi-ethnic markets, rather than considering the characteristic of each nation, greater weight is placed on the universal or standardized services that make all the people satisfied. That is, although the company of this type tries to deal with global market for the purpose of handling various ethnic ones, still some ethnic elements remain because of its ethnically based management. It has not yet arrived at the point at which it can completely be called a global company. Hence, cell three can be named ''semi-global.'' The leisure company Club Med seems to be of this form. They offer their unique vacation packages worldwide by adapting marketing methods to local practices and utilizing multinational staff at their vacation villages, but usually assign European people to the top management level (Hart, Arczynski and Maher 1986; Imanishi 2004) . Finally, in cell four is the case of the geocentric-multi-ethnic approach in which a company shows a geocentric attitude and does not adhere to a specific ethnic market. In contrast to cell one, a company belonging to the fourth does not stick to its ethnicity on either dimension. Further, unlike those in cell two, it functions globally, where there are various ethnic markets. Moreover, it differs from cell three and is not ethnic in its administrative behavior. Therefore, cell four may be described as ''global.'' In this area, while the company is able to deal with more customers through targeting a wider range of markets, the tourist also has a wide choice over companies and can enjoy the best service he or she can find. To get to this situation a company may incur immense expense. Therefore, in a company belonging to this cell, cost reduction will be practiced by setting a wide-ranged market approach and at the same time attaining standardization of service. In this case, the service levels pursued will be irrespective of the ethnic dimension and standardized service takes the lead.",

Since they require to be served as they are in their home country even when overseas, dealing with them requires companies to put special emphasis on Japanese service and operate by making the most of the noted laborforce. One of the reasons for such operations is that in the background there lurks an ethnocentrism which considers identity of ethnicity of agent and client to result in the best understanding and fulfilling of people's needs.

Therefore, the ethnic model can be defined as a model of an international administrative behavior within which a company adopts an ethnocentric attitude and puts the main target on its own people. Since it focuses on the market of its own ethnicity, this model explains the situation of Japanese tourism multinationals' business organization, service, and so forth, becoming circumscribed by national origin.

            "text": "The international administrative behavior of such tourism multinationals demonstrates some particular side effects. For example, it strengthens relationships between headquarters and foreign subsidiaries and improves service and efficiency in managerial resources. Furthermore, by doing business in this form of niche segmentation, the order of their business will be maintained and international competition will be inhibited. The corporation can reduce uncertainty and reassure its customers. The rapid expansion of the overseas tourism market let companies remain in specified markets. It cannot be denied that these companies were able to get enough profit from their single market, and thus did not try to enter into the international market, which would have introduced cutthroat global competition. However, any tourism service is deeply involved with its own culture and mind. It becomes necessary for the company to satisfy its customers with a little something such as consideration or kindness toward them. While overseas tourists require some exposure to the exotic, they also ask for daily service appropriate to their needs and experience. Especially in physiological terms, they demand ethnocentric service. It is natural for a person to decide on the basis of his self-reference criterion, the unconscious reference to one's own cultural values (Lee 1966:106) , and people habitually define, select, value, and make references based on their own culture unconsciously. In this context, Japanese companies built a system which enabled them to supply their own service worldwide to their customers. At least frontline service had to be similar to the home country. In this sense, ethnic administrative behavior can be said to be suitable for coping with their tourists. However while the model discussed in this paper shows why ethnicbased behavior worked effectively in the developing stage, the overseas tourism market is changing into the next stage of maturity, where the situation for companies may well be different. Three important issues can be pointed out. First, the ethnic model does not allow making use of their advantage as a multinational corporation. Essentially multinational corporations can think globally, can utilize various resources in other countries (Vernon 1971:265) , and are blessed with the opportunity to be exposed to the environmental stimulation of several countries (Bartlett and Goshal 1986:94) . Ethnically-based administrative behavior will not let the company enjoy these advantages. Assigning expatriates to top management all over the world would lead to high-cost management and would reduce the motivation of local staff to make real efforts. Limiting both management and target market to Japanese and those of Japanese ancestry will make a company lose the opportunity to be stimulated by other people. Further, they are wasting the chance to capture share in the local market.",

The growth of the internet makes the transnational approach of companies and customers easy. As overseas tourism experiences increase, people are getting used to foreign service and are not sticking to the companies of their own country anymore.
