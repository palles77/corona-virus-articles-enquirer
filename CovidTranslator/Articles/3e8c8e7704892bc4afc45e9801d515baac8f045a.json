            "text": "Prevention of renal failure: The Malaysian experience. Renal replacement therapy in Malaysia has shown exponential growth since 1990. The dialysis acceptance rate for 2003 was 80 per million population, prevalence 391 per million population. There are now more than 10,000 patients on dialysis. This growth is proportional to the growth in gross domestic product (GDP). Improvement in nephrology and urology services with widespread availability of ultrasonography and renal pathology has improved care of renal patients. Proper management of renal stone disease, lupus nephritis, and acute renal failure has decreased these as causes of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) in younger age groups. Older patients are being accepted for dialysis, and 51% of new patients on dialysis were diabetic in 2003. The prevalence of diabetes is rising in the country (presently 7%); glycemic control of such patients is suboptimal. Thirtythree percent of adult Malaysians are hypertensive and blood pressure control is poor (6%). There is a national coordinating committee to oversee the control of diabetes and hypertension in the country. Primary care clinics have been provided with kits to detect microalbuminuria, and ACE inhibitors for the treatment of hypertension and diabetic nephropathy. Prevention of renal failure workshops targeted at primary care doctors have been launched, opportunistic screening at health clinics is being carried out, and public education targeting high-risk groups is ongoing. The challenge in Malaysia is to stem the rising tide of diabetic ESRD.",

In developed economies, the rising incidence of ESRD among the elderly and diabetics is a major concern because it increases the cost of care in a treatment modality that already consumes a disproportionate share of the health care budget [3] [4] [5] . Renal replacement therapy (RRT) uses 1% of the total health care budget in the United States, 2% of the health budget in the UK for treating 0.075% of the population, and 1.5% of the health care expenditure in France [accounting for 9.8% of the gross domestic product (GDP)], treating 0.034% of the population. In the developing world, the challenge facing health care providers is prioritizing finite health care resources in Key words: end-stage renal disease, diabetic nephropathy, hypertension. C 2005 by the International Society of Nephrology the face of many competing demands. Costly technologydependent treatment programs such as RRT may not have the same priority as broad-based community health initiatives such as eradication of HIV/AIDS, malaria, and water-borne infectious diseases [6] . Recently, outbreaks of communicable diseases such as Severe Acute Respiratory syndrome [7] , which have a major impact on the economy, further strained health care resources and underlines the importance of good public health measures. This will be at the expense of tertiary care services.",

Although the exact diagnosis was not known, many in this group were suspected to have glomerulonephritis based on the clinical history and other findings. Despite these achievements, there are still many patients with renal failure in the country who are not treated. The incidence of ESRD was estimated to be 86 per million population in 1991 [11] . It may be higher because there are no community-based studies on incidence of ESRD. The incidence in Singapore, an immediate neighbor, was higher, and was estimated to be 158 in 1997 [12] .",

This was reflected in recent registry reports where the number of patients with renal failure in the age group of 25 to 44 years has declined over the years [10] . The management of lupus nephritis with the judicious use of steroids and cytotoxics has led to better remission rates [14] [15] [16] . One hundred and two systemic lupus erythmatosus (SLE) patients in Kuala Lumpur were studied in 1996; 5-year and 10-year patient survival was 86% and 70%, respectively. In 1984, Wang reported on 31 patients with membranous lupus nephropathy with a 6-year survival of 50% to 62%, depending on whether there was proliferation in the glomeruli or not. In a group of 85 patients with severe lupus nephritis (90% WHO class IV) reported in 2000 treated with intravenous cyclophosphamide, patient survival was 75% at 5 years, and 64% at 10 years.

It endorses and disseminates clinical practice guidelines developed by professional groups. It monitors the general trend in diabetic care through a common data set developed for the public sector. The primary care physician, both in public and private sectors, has been identified as the key personnel for this program, and all efforts are channeled through the primary care clinics.",

All government primary care clinics are provided with kits to detect microalbuminuria. The guidelines call for this test to be done yearly in diabetic patients who are negative for overt albuminuria [25, 26] . Diabetic patients have their renal function tested and blood pressure taken at regular intervals. Angiotensinconverting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) are made available in the most rural clinic, and patients that are ACEI intolerant are prescribed angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) after a review by the internal medicine specialist. HbA1c test is now available in the smaller rural clinics. Most classes of antihypertensives are available in these clinics, as are the commonly used sulfonylureas, metformin, and insulin.",

Screening and detection of diabetic nephropathy is being done in primary care settings. Raising awareness of doctors and patients about the threat of renal failure is ongoing. Population-based screening has not been done on a coordinated scale. The prevalence of chronic kidney disease in the community is unknown. This may be incorporated as an objective of the third National Health and Morbidity survey that is due in 2006. The ultimate aim is to prevent illness, or else to prevent the complications of illness. When will society reap the benefits of prevention strategies and how it will be measured is still unknown. There are few data on the value of screening for early renal disease and how to focus this in order to ensure an optimum cost-benefit ratio.",
