            "text": "One of the key characteristics of the transmission dynamics of infectious diseases is the generation time which refers to the time interval between the infection of a secondary case and the infection of its infector. The generation time distribution together with the reproduction number determines the rate at which an infection spreads in a population. When defining the generation time distribution at a calendar time t two definitions are plausible according whether we regard t as the infection time of the infector or the infection time of the infectee. The resulting measurements are respectively called forward generation time and backward generation time. It has been observed that the mean forward generation time contracts around the peak of an epidemic. This contraction effect has previously been attributed to either competition among potential infectors or depletion of susceptibles in the population. The first explanation requires many infectives for contraction to occur whereas the latter explanation suggests that contraction occurs even when there are few infectives. With a simulation study we show that both competition and depletion cause the mean forward generation time to contract. Our results also reveal that the distribution of the infectious period and the reproduction number have a strong effect on the size and timing of the contraction, as well as on the mean value of the generation time in both forward and backward scheme. These observations relate to the 'serial interval', the time interval between symptom 26 onset of a secondary case and symptom onset of its infector [10]. Many authors have 27 used the serial interval as a synonym for the generation time. However, unlike the 28 generation time, the serial interval can have a negative duration when the clinical 29 March 5, 2019 2/23 .

A key example is given by the prediction models of the reproduction numbers: these rely on the generation time distribution that is usually estimated from contact tracing data collected at a precise calendar time. The forward scheme is used in such a prediction model and the knowledge of its evolution over time is crucial to correctly estimate the parameters of interest. It is therefore important to characterize the causes that lead to the contraction of the mean forward generation time during the course of an outbreak.",

Moreover, we analyze the phenomena of competition among infectives and depletion of susceptible individuals highlighting their effects on the contraction of the mean forward generation time. The upshot of this investigation is that the variance of the infectious period distribution and the reproduction number have a strong impact on the generation times affecting both the mean value and the evolution over time. Furthermore, competition and depletion can both cause contraction even for small values of the reproduction number suggesting that, in epidemic models where the generation time is considered time-inhomogeneous, estimators accounting for both depletion and competing risks are to be preferred in the inference of the generation interval distributions.",

            "text": "In infectious disease epidemiology, mathematical models are increasingly being used to 2 study the transmission dynamics of infectious agents in a population and thereby 3 providing fundamental tools for developing control policies. An optimal control strategy 4 is based on an appropriate prediction model that in turn requires reliable estimates of 5 the key epidemic parameters. 6 Most research has focused on the 'basic reproduction number', R 0 , which is defined 7 as the expected number of secondary cases resulting from introducing a typical infected 8 person into an entirely susceptible population [2] . The inference of its value in the 9 ascending phase of an epidemic is based either explicitly or implicitly on assumptions 10 about the generation interval distribution [3] . 11 The generation interval, or generation time, is defined to be the time interval 12 between the infection time of an infectee and the infection time of its infector [4] . 13 Generation times are lengths of time intervals and thus there is not a unequivocal 14 procedure to define their dependence on a precise calendar time t. To account for the 15 evolution over time a choice has to be made weather considering generations from the 16 infectee or infector point of view. In the former case the time coordinate refers to the 17 time that has evolved since the infector of an infected person was infected. This is 18 called 'backward', or 'period', generation interval. In the latter case, known as 'forward', 19 or 'cohort', generation interval the average time required to infect another individual is 20 recorded [5, 6] . Considered in the forward scheme, the generation interval distributions 21 is commonly used to estimate infectious disease parameters such as the basic 22 reproduction number [6] [7] [8] [9] . 23 More ambiguity arises in the estimation of the mean generation time because actual 24 data often concern the onset of clinical symptoms rather than the time of infection. symptoms for an infectee appear prior to that of its infector [11] . Note that the serial 30 interval is only defined for symptomatic individuals; an issue that we will not discuss 31 here. 32 Statistical development led to approaches for the estimation of the generation time 33 distribution [7, 12, 13] or jointly of the basic reproduction number and the generation 34 time distribution [14] [15] [16] . The usefulness of the aforementioned approaches has been 35 demonstrated in the analysis of epidemic data during e.g. SARS outbreaks and the 36 pandemic influenza A(H1N1)V2009 outbreak [17] [18] [19] . Most of these estimation methods 37 assume the generation or serial time distribution to remain constant during the 38 epidemic. However, several authors described a non-constant evolution over time for 39 both backward and forward generation interval [5, 6, 8, 20] . In the former case as the 40 epidemic evolves the generation time increases while in the latter case the generation 41 time contracts reaching a minimum approximately at the peak of the outbreak [6, 8] . 42 We will refer to this phenomenon in the forward scheme as 'contraction' to stress the 43 particular shape that the mean generation time assumes over time. The non-constant 44 evolution of the generation interval has stimulated a search for different approaches to 45 estimate the reproduction number that avoid assuming a constant generation intervals 46 distribution through time [8, 9, 13] . Kenah et al. (2008) proposed an hazard-based 47 estimator and the so-called contact interval, the time from onset of infectiousness to an 48 infectious contact, accounting not only for depletion but also for competing risks.",

The evolution over time for both the 214 forward and the backward generation intervals show a similar pattern for the different 215 infectious period distributions though we notice that a higher variability is observed for 216 scenarios in which the infectious period distribution has larger variance.

Competition also affects the generation time distribution but its effect is directed to 295 a single generation. To have a similar impact on the mean forward generation time as 296 caused by depletion, competition should affect most of all the generations that an 297 individual makes. This is simulated in the scenario where competition is increased and 298 results show a potentially large impact of competition on the forward generation time. 299 However, in a baseline scenario where competition is not increased rarely more than one 300 generation per single individual is affected by competition and the mean number of 301 competitors is not particularly high to be able to explain a decreasing mean forward 302 generation time (Fig 3) . Furthermore, the effect of competition is strongly dependent on 303 March 5, 2019 12/23 the competitor's infection time and does not not always affect the considered generation. 304 The contact interval that leads to the generation time can be the longest one among the 305 contact intervals proposed by the infectors since the next generation is the minimum of 306 the set given by the infection times plus the proposed contact times. Competition is 307 slightly affecting the forward and backward generation time: Table 6 shows a small 308 decrease probably due to the competition effect.",

The mean backward generation 311 time is known to be increasing [6, 20] and differently from the forward scheme a single 312 generation is considered for every time point. The increasing trend is due to the fact 313 that the probability of encountering a susceptible decreases over time, but a more 314 intense competition can, also in this case, modify the evolution of the mean value over 315 time. This is shown in Fig S6, where in a preliminary investigation the baseline, Although we have looked at compartmental SIR models, we expect our conclusion to 331 hold for more complicated compartmental models, and even for epidemics models on 332 structured contact networks. A limitation of our investigation is the assumption made 333 for the infectious contact process to be described by a Poisson process and to be 334 homogeneous in the population: in a structured population the infectious contact 335 process depends on the location where the contacts take place because of different 336 behaviour of individuals yielding different contact processes [21] .",

            "text": "The simulated data are analyzed in R; generations resulting from the first n non-extinct simulations are merge together in a unique data file and we predict the value of a loess regression to express the evolution over time of mean forward or backward generation time. This analysis required a huge computational memory, limiting the number of simulations that can be considered. However, this R function allows us to construct a confidence interval to quantify the variability of the loess regression used. In Another important aspect in the loess regression is the considered span. The fitting is done locally and the considered neighbourhood of a point x is based on the value of the span, parameter that has to be given as input in the loess function. In S4 Fig we report the evolution over time of the mean forward generation time for R = 1.5 in the vaccination scenario for three different values of the span parameter: 0.5, 0.75(default value) and 1.5 in the case of exponential infectious period. The plot shows differences between the curves in the last part of the outbreak after the vaccination time where few generations are registered. This is probably due to the little number of generations that happen after the vaccination time. We want to remark that the result of contraction holds independently on the type of span considered. Lastly, we want to show the evolution over time of the mean forward generation time for different population sizes. In S5 Fig we report this quantity for population of size N = 100, 500 and 1000 in the case of exponential infectious period. We notice that one plot is the re-scaling of the others; the general evolution of the forward generation intervals is not affect by the population size. The same results apply for the backward generation interval. ",

In S6 Fig we report the evolution over time of the mean backward generation interval R 0 = 1.5, 3, 5 comparing the baseline, the vaccination, the competition and the pure depletion scenario. We note an overall relevant impact of competition when its effect is incremented (competition scenario), registering a smoothed increase. Furthermore, for R 0 = 3, 5 we observe that the pure depletion and the baseline scenario have different evolution indicating an impact of competition.

More recently, Liu et al. (2018) 62 reported the evolution over time of the mean forward generation interval in a structured 63 population. More precisely, different infectious contact processes have been defined in 64 different locations showing that levels of contraction strongly depend on the underlying 65 contact process. Therefore, in addition to investigate the competition and depletion 66 hypotheses, we address the impact on the mean backward and forward generation 67 intervals over time of settings with different reproduction numbers, population sizes and 68 infectious period distributions. 69 The present investigation is a simulation study where the simulations are based on 70 two different algorithmic implementations of a stochastic SIR compartmental model as 71 introduced by Kenah et al. (2008) and Scalia Tomba et al. (2009) which will be referred 72 to as the stepwise and the parallel algorithm respectively. In what follows, we revisit the 73 taxonomy of various time intervals used in epidemic modeling, we simulate the impact 74 of the considered epidemic quantities on the mean generation times and we show the an infectious contact, person i acquires infection at time t i . 85 2. during the infectious period of length r i , person i is capable of infecting other 86 individuals 87 3. at time t i + r i , person i is immune and cannot be longer infected by other person. 88",

Lastly, we plot the evolution over time of the forward 173 generation time for comparing this depletion scenario with the baseline scenario. 174 Pure depletion scenario 175 In this scenario infectives propose infectious contacts only to individuals who no other 176 infectors proposed an infectious contact to. In this way, there is no competition and 177 only depletion would be responsible for contraction. We consider populations of size 178 N = 100, 500 and 1000 and reproduction numbers R 0 = 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 5 and we compare 179 this scenario with the baseline scenario in which competition is present. For every 180 non-extinct simulation we compute the loess regression and we keep track of the 181 maximum value, the minimum value and the range defined as the difference between 182 maximum and minimum. We do not report here the relative number of generations 183 affected by competition because of requiring huge computational memory to monitor all 184 these generations. However, for a small sample size, values are in line with the 185 simulations for N = 100, 200. 186 Competition among infectious persons 187 In the competition scenario, we force individuals to compete for the same susceptible 188 persons in a fixed time frame. To do that, every time an individual proposes an 189 infectious contact we force that individual to propose it to a susceptible person who 190 already someone else proposed an infectious contact to. We consider a scenario with 191 population size N = 1000 and R 0 = 1.5 and, without loss of generality, we modify the 192 code increasing competition when the outbreak time is in the interval (3, 7). We select 193 this time interval to allow for starting from a reasonably sized infectious population. 194 Results 195 Impact of infectious period, reproduction number and 196 population size on the realized generation intervals. 197 Table 1 summarizes the results of the baseline scenario showing remarkable differences 198 when different infectious period distributions are considered: an higher variance of the 199 infectious period distribution enlarges the disparity between the value of the mean 200 forward and backward generation times, specially in the case of low value of the 201 reproduction number. Moreover, the outbreaks last longer and the backward and 202 forward generation times are registered to be larger. This discrepancy between mean 203 backward and forward generation time decreases for scenarios with lower variance 204 resulting almost the same when a constant infectious period is considered. The average 205 mean generation time decreases as the basic reproduction number increases, in line with 206 previous studies[5,6,8].",

Comparison of the evolution of the mean forward generation time between the baseline scenario (blue line) and the competition scenario (purple line).

Discussion 276 The present study was designed with the aim of characterizing the main cause of 277 contraction in the evolution over time of the mean forward generation interval. The 278 results of this investigation address both depletion of susceptible individuals and 279 competition among infectors as causes of contraction. Scenarios where the depletion or 280 the competition effects are increased show that the mean forward generation interval 281 contracts with a peak close to the time point of maximum depletion or maximum 282 competition, even for a small value of the reproduction number. In the pure depletion 283 scenario, depletion clearly causes the phenomenon of contraction. Given that results are 284 similar to the baseline scenario where depletion and competition are both present, we 285 can conclude that depletion is predominant in shaping the evolution over time of the 286 mean forward generation time. 287 A rapid depletion forces the infectious person to make more shorter infectious 288 contacts because the probability of encountering a susceptible individual drastically 289 decreases over time. This phenomenon is highlighted for high values of the reproduction 290 number: the rate of the contact process is higher implying that infectious individuals 291 propose on average more infectious contacts during their infectious period. The higher 292 depletion effect increases the proportion of short contact intervals resulting in a faster 293 and larger contraction of the mean forward generation time.",

Results show that their mean values over time decrease 323 faster and more with increasing reproduction number. Furthermore, the infectious 324 period distribution affects remarkably these mean values with a higher impact when the 325 variance of the selected infectious period distribution is higher.

The epidemic begins with an imported infection from outside the population at time t (1) = 0. The introductory case has an infectious period of length r (1) , according to a desirable statistical distribution F . We assume that the total number of contacts for a fixed length of the infectious period r, follows a homogeneous Poisson process with constant intensity \u03b2r, where \u03b2 is a known constant. Consequently, the inter-arrival contact times for an infected case i, denoted by {\u03b4 i1 , \u03b4 i2 , \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 } are independent and follow an exponential distribution of parameter \u03b2r. The introductory case will randomly meet the first individual at time t * (1)1 = t (1) + \u03b4 (1)1 . If this contact happens within the infectious period r (1) , i.e. t * (1)1 \u2264 t (1) + r (1) , it is an infectious",
