However, the differential roles of the three HRV species HRV-A, HRV-B, and HRV-C in pediatric CAP are not fully understood. Objective: To determine the distribution of HRV species and their roles in children hospitalized with CAP in Beijing, China. Study design: Nasopharyngeal aspirates were collected between April 2007 and March 2008 from 554 children with a primary diagnosis of CAP. HRVs in the clinical samples were detected by RT-PCR and by sequencing. Infections with other respiratory viruses were identified by PCR. Results: HRVs were detected in 99 patients (17.87%). Among these patients, 51.52% tested positive for HRV-A, 38.38% for HRV-C, and 10.10% for HRV-B. HRVs were detected throughout the study period. The monthly distribution of HRV infections varied with HRV species. Median age, gender, symptoms, severity, and duration of hospitalization for single HRV-C infections were similar to those observed for single HRV-A infections. Co-infections with other respiratory viruses were detected in 57.58% of the HRV-positive children. HRV/RSV dual infections were correlated with a higher frequency of shortness of breath (HRV-A group, P 2tail = 0.01; HRV-C group, P 2tail = 0.015) and lower median ages (HRV-A group, P 2tail = 0.049; HRV-C group, P 2tail = 0.009). Conclusion: Our study shows that HRV-C strains circulate at a prevalence intermediate between HRV-A and HRV-B. The severity of clinical manifestations for HRV-C is comparable to that for HRV-A in children with CAP. These findings point to an important role of both HRV-A and HRV-C in pediatric CAP.",

Based on nucleotide sequence homologies, HRVs can be divided into three genetic species, HRV-A, HRV-B, 7 and the recently identified HRV-C. [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] Studies of HRV-C in pediatric RTIs have focused on the molecular identification of HRV-C from clinical samples. Few studies have evaluated the clinical significance of HRV-C infections in association with those of HRV-A and HRV-B within the same cohort. We previously reported the presence of HRV-C in hospitalized children with lower RTIs in Beijing, China. 21 However, to determine the differential roles of these HRV species in pediatric CAP, all HRV species need to be analyzed.",

Our findings are similar to results found in pediatric asthma cases. 19, 20 Although HRV infections occurred throughout the study period, HRV species showed different monthly distributions. Other studies in Asia also documented fluctuations in HRV infections over time. 25, 26 Linsuwanon et al. identified different temporal distributions of HRV species in children suffering from lower respiratory diseases in Thailand. 26 Furthermore, HRV-A was detected in hospitalized adults and children in Hong Kong throughout the study period, while HRV-B infections appeared limited during that same period. 25 In our study, the clinical manifestations for single infections of HRV-A and HRV-C were very similar. A study performed in Thailand also found that patients infected with different HRV species exhibited comparable initial body temperature and median length of hospitalization. 26 We did not observe statistical significance in the median age of patients with HRV-A or HRV-C single infections, as reported elsewhere. 20 The disparity between this latter study and ours could be attributed to different patient selection criteria.",

            "text": "Consistent with previous reports, 4, 27 we found that more than half of HRV infections were associated with other respiratory viral infections. Because we detected a high percentage (39.39%) of HRV/RSV co-infections, we compared the clinical symptoms and severity between patients with HRV-A or HRV-C single infections to those of patients with HRV/RSV co-infections. The median age of patients co-infected with HRV/RSV was significantly lower than that of patients with single HRV-A or HRV-C infection. Furthermore, more children with dual infections had shortness of breath than those with single infections. Common causes of shortness of breath are asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, pulmonary edema, and pneumonia. 28 Because the prevalence of asthma is low in Chinese children, 29 shortness of breath can be assumed to be an indication of CAP severity. In addition, in the HRV-A positive group, more children with co-infections had three severe indices and respiratory failure than those with single HRV infection (5:1 and 9:4, respectively). These differences between HRV single infection and HRV/RSV co-infections may be attributed to the RSV infection. RSV seems to be a more virulent virus, infecting younger age groups, causing shortness of breath and other symptoms. For instance, Midulla et al. reported that infants with RSV bronchiolitis were younger and had a significantly higher clinical severity score upon hospital admission than infants with HRV bronchiolitis. 30 Further investigations of such co-infections are necessary to evaluate their specific role in disease severity.",
