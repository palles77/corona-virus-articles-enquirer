Majors outbreaks continue to occur in areas with poor sanitation conditions as evidenced by an outbreak of hepatitis E in over 5,000 refugees in South Sudan in 2013 3 . In industrialized countries, HEV cases tend to be sporadic either imported from travelers who have visited endemic countries or as a zoonosis 4 . Zoonotic transmission of HEV typically occurs from ingesting undercooked animal meat from species such as swine and deer which harbor zoonotic strains of HEV 5 .",

There are more than 20 second generation direct-acting antiviral agents (DAAs) in phase II/III clinical trials, although their efficacy against HEV is doubtful as most were specifically designed against hepatitis C viral proteins and their interaction with the host and HEV does not share sequence homology with hepatitis C virus 11 .

            "text": "HEV was first identified from an electron microscopy study of the stool samples of an infected volunteer in 1983 12 , although its sequence was not determined until 1990 13 . The virus was originally classified as a member of the family Caliciviridae based on its superficial similarity in virion morphology and genome organization. HEV has since been reclassified into a new family Hepeviridae, in which its members continue to grow as novel strains of HEV are frequently discovered in various animal species. Recently a new taxonomic scheme has been proposed in which the Hepeviridae family is divided into the genera Orthohepevirus (mammalian and avian strains) and Piscihepevirus (cutthroat trout virus). Orthohepevirus is further subdivided into species Orthohepevirus A-D (A including human, pig, wild boar, deer, mongoose, rabbit, and camel isolates, B including avian isolates, C including rat, bandicoot, shrew, ferret, and mink isolates, and D including bat isolates) 14 . Mammalian HEV that is known to infect humans is further subdivided into four recognized distinct genotypes. Genotype 1 is found in developing countries in Asia and Africa, whereas genotype 2 was identified from Mexico and Africa. Genotypes 1 and 2 HEV infect only humans and are associated with major epidemics in areas with poor sanitation. Genotype 3 HEV is distributed worldwide including both developing and industrialized countries, and genotype 4 HEV is more prevalent in Asia although it has also been identified from some countries in Europe. Both genotypes 3 and 4 HEV infect humans as well as a number of other animal species including pigs, and are considered as zoonotic viruses 15 .",

Acute liver failure is more commonly seen in pregnant women (>30%) 18 , in both men and women with preexisting liver diseases, and is often fatal if onset is within the first 8 weeks of symptoms 19 . In some rare occurrences, neurological symptoms such as Guillain Barr\u00e9 syndrome 20 , neuralgic amyotrophy 21 , and myelitis 22 have also been reported.

For example, in a cohort of 854 French solid organ transplant patients there was an HEV incidence rate of ~4% or 33 patients. Each of these infections was determined to be autochthonous and of genotype 3 origins as are the vast majority of reported chronic HEV cases, thus suggesting a potential zoonotic source. Of the 33 HEV-infected patients, 59% progressed to chronic HEV infection as measured by persistent viremia and elevated transaminase levels for >6 months, and 75% of those patients continued to be HEV RNA positive for more than 22 months 24 . A separate study by this same group followed 85 HEVinfected transplant patients, and 66% of them progressed to chronicity and only 32% were capable of clearing the virus when their immunosuppressant dose was reduced, leaving the majority of the patients still in need of therapeutic treatment to control the virus infection 29 . Similarly, within HIV-infected population, the reported seroprevalence of HEV infection ranges from 2.5-16% 26, 30, 31 , which is within the expected range for the normal populace. Despite the incidence of chronic HEV infection in the HIV-infected population appearing to be less than the solid organ transplant population, this reduced incidence is attributed to most HIV patients responding to antiretroviral therapy with a restored immune function or the mild HEV symptoms being overlooked as drug-induced liver injury 32 . Despite this lower reported incidence, HIV patients who have reduced immune function are at risk for developing chronic HEV infection 26, 32 . Ribavirin therapy at 8.1 mg/Kg body weight per day for 3 months appears to efficiently treat chronic HEV infection with 85% of patients being cured although the relapse rate remains at 15-18% even after 3 months of ribavirin treatment 10, 33 .",

ORF1 has been expressed as a full-length 185 kDa polyprotein in mammalian, bacterial, and insect cells [47] [48] [49] [50] . Expressing ORF1 in mammalian cells using a vaccinia virus expression system led to two potential processing products of 107 and 78 kDa after extended incubation times 48 , however mutation of the predicted protease catalytic site failed to affect the observed processing, suggesting that the processing may have been an artifact of the vaccinia virus expression system. Expression of HEV ORF1 in a baculovirus system also led to multiple smaller NSP proteins in a process that was sensitive to a cell-permeable cysteine protease inhibitor E-64d 51 . However, thus far, the bulk of the published literature seems to favor an unprocessed NSP or at minimum a very inefficient or tightly regulated processing event. In addition to its putative role in processing the NSP, a Met-PCP recombinant protein was shown to deconjugate interferon-stimulated gene 15 (ISG15), neural precursor cells expressed developmentally down-regulated 8 (Nedd8), and small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO) from a fluorogenic substrate, suggesting that Met-PCP has deubiquitinating activity 40 .",

ORF3 protein can be phosphorylated on serine 71, and this phosphorylated form interacts with non-glycosylated capsid protein potentially playing a role in virion assembly 69 . ORF3 protein is found throughout the host cell but accumulates in filamentous patterns corresponding to its interaction with microtubules 70 and in punctate arrangements corresponding to early and recycling endosomes 71, 72 . Monoclonal antibodies against ORF3 protein can recognize HEV particles from cell culture supernatants and serum of infected patients but not virus from the feces, suggesting that ORF3 is only present on the surface of nascent HEV virions 73 . This is congruent with findings reporting that ORF3 plays a role in release of HEV through a PSAP \"late domain\" amino acid motif within ORF3 which interacts with the host cell sorting endosomal sorting complexes required for transport (ESCRT) pathways through the host cellular protein tumor suppressor gene 101 (TSG101) 74 . Although this pathway has yet to be fully understood within HEV, it has been well studied with regards to other enveloped RNA viruses 75 . Therefore, it is likely that HEV is initially released from the cell as an enveloped virus and then loses its envelope while being secreted in the feces similar to hepatitis A virus 76 .",

ORF3 interacts with the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) phosphatase pathway activating extracellular signal-regulated kinases (Erks) via the binding and inactivation of an Erk specific MAPK phosphatase, Pyst1 77, 78 . Besides the role of the PxxP motif in virus release, the same region has also been reported to bind to sarcoma (src)homology 3 (SH3) domain-containing proteins 78 that play many different signaling roles within host cells including cell survival, and immunomodulatory functions 79 . ORF3 protein interacts with hemopexin altering cellular iron homeostasis 80 , stabilizes hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1) upregulating proteins within the glycolytic pathway 81 , and interacting with the fibrinogen B\u03b2 chain and decreasing fibrinogen secretion 82 . The ORF3 protein inhibits the mitochondrial apoptosis pathway 83 , delays phosphorylated signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (pSTAT3) transport into the nucleus 71 , and delays degradation of the activated hepatocyte growth factor receptor (c-Met) 84 all leading to the belief that ORF3 is promoting the survival of infected cells. In addition to those host factors, ORF3 protein interacts with \u03b11-microglobulin and bikunin 85, 86 leading to an increase in \u03b11-microglobulin through TSG101 interaction possibly as a consequence of using this pathway for particle release. ORF3 proteins also promote phosphorylation of hepatocyte nuclear factor 4 (HNF4) impairing its nuclear translocation. More recently, ORF3 protein has been shown to interact with hepsin and a linkage the host blood coagulation system may contribute to pathogenesis 87, 88 .",

Although the clinical symptoms within the infected pig are absent, the infected swine develop characteristic microscopic lesions within the liver and associated lymph nodes including mild to moderate multifocal and periportal lymphoplasmacytic hepatitis 92 . The pig model has been invaluable for studying HEV replication, pathogenesis, and cross-species infections despite not being able to reproduce hepatic disease with overt clinical signs 93 . Avian HEV, first identified from chickens in 2001 94 , shares approximately 60% nucleotide sequence identity with human HEV 95 . Despite its sequence divergence and inability to infect mammals 96 , it can be successfully utilized to assess certain aspects of HEV lifecycle and pathogenesis as hepatitis-splenomegaly syndrome such as enlarged, hemorrhagic, and necrotic livers and spleens can be reproduced in avian HEV experimentally-infected chickens 97 . Recently several other novel strains of HEV have been discovered in small animal species. Rat HEV was identified in 2009 98 which shared 59.9% nucleotide sequence identity with human HEV suggesting a putative new mammalian genotype. The rat model may have limitations as a model for human HEV infection, since genotype 1, 2, and 4, avian, and swine strains of HEV failed to infect Wistar rats and the rat strain failed to infect rhesus monkey 99 . A ferret strain was identified in 2010 in the Netherlands with 72.3% nucleotide sequence identity to rat HEV and ~60% to human HEV strains 100 . However, little else has been explored with this potential model system, although its close sequence similarity to the rat strain would suggest that it has many of the same drawbacks of the rat strain. The most intriguing animal strain of HEV is a genotype 3 strain identified from rabbits. This strain was first isolated in Chinese rabbits 101 and subsequently from rabbits in the U.S. 102 with up to 23% of commercially-farmed rabbits being positive for HEV RNA. Importantly, rabbit HEV can infect pigs and cynomolgous macaques, and rabbits can be infected with genotype 4 human HEV 103, 104 . Although experimental infection of rabbits leads to a subclinical infection with localized hepatocellular necrosis only visible via microscopic examination, this model system appears to be able to recapitulate the high mortality rates associated with pregnancy in humans 105 . The availability of these small animal model systems for HEV will permit antiviral testing in the future.",

The Emerson group successfully derived a passage 6 virus of the genotype 3 Kernow-C1 strain that replicates in both Huh7 and HepG2/C3A liver cells 108 . The Kernow-C1 P6 virus was derived from a chronically infected patient and contains a ribosomal protein S17 sequence naturally inserted into the ORF1 HVR along with several point mutations throughout the genome that result in enhanced virus replication. Although these in vitro cell culture systems display slow growth kinetics and no cytopathic effects, these virus strains and culture systems produce enough virus for virus yield assays and can be monitored via immunofluorescent assays to determine whether the virus is capable of initiating replication and how efficiently new infectious particles are produced 109, 110 . There is still a great need for a genotype 1 strain of HEV which can replicate in cell culture as genotype 1 HEV accounts for a large proportion of infections worldwide 111 . Additionally, identification of HEV strains with improved replication kinetics and better reporter systems to monitor virus replication would continue to enhance our abilities to screen and test potential antiviral therapeutic compounds.",

As more efficient in vitro virus propagation systems have evolved, so has our understanding of the biology of the virus and of the potential therapeutic targets. Beginning with virus binding to the host cellular receptor, we have incomplete knowledge of the HEV entry receptor on host cells. Current knowledge suggests that viral capsid binds with heat shock cognate receptor 70 (HSC70) 112 and heparin sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs) 61 . These receptors could theoretically be blocked to prevent virus uptake but research in this area is in its infancy and whether blocking one receptor or multiple receptors is necessary remains to be seen. Receptor-dependent clathrin-mediated endocytosis has been shown to be involved in HEV particle entry 113 (Fig. 2) . Drugs such as chlorpromazine 114 or derivatives could be studied as potential inhibitors of HEV entry if clathrin-mediated endocytosis is the sole pathway utilized by HEV for entry. Once inside the cell, the viral capsid is thought to interact with heat shock protein 90 (HSP90) 59 and glucose regulated protein 78 (Grp78) 60 to potentially facilitate intracellular movement and potentially viral uncoating. Therefore, chemicals that block these interactions may be assessed for their effects on viral uncoating, trafficking, and ultimately infectivity.",

One of the largest caches of potential antiviral inhibitors occurs with the many functional domains within the RdRp as discussed in Section 2.4. It is at this step in the viral lifecycle where ribavirin likely elicits its anti-HEV effects inducing mutations when it is inserted into the RNA by the RdRp or by depleting the cellular GTP pool 109 . In general, each of the enzymatic functions of the NSP can be targeted and tested using the HEV replication assays currently available. Methyltransferase, helicase, cysteine protease, and the RdRp functions can all be potentially blocked by small molecule inhibitors. One of the biggest unknowns in HEV replication is what occurs during the early stages of particle assembly. As described in sections 2.5 and 2.6, the viral capsid and the ORF3 phosphoprotein all have had many interactions attributed to each but how they contribute to assembly and hence how they can be targeted and blocked remain unclear. Currently, we are really just beginning to understand the late stages of viral release and how the ORF3 proteins interact with the host ESCRT machinery as discussed in Section 4.4.",

Infecting pigs that had been injected with plasmid containing the siRNA 24 hours prior to challenge reduced clinical symptoms of pigs receiving the siRNA compared to control pigs, although for the purposes of treating chronically-infected patients, it would have been better to introduce the siRNA to pigs with established HEV infection rather than as a prophylaxis. This was likely not feasible, due to the transient nature and mild symptoms observed in the swine model of HEV infection. Kumar et al utilized siRNA against the helicase, replicase, 5' UTR, and 3' cis-acting element (CAE) of a genotype 1 HEV strain 119 . These siRNAs reduced virus replication between 60% and 90% in the luciferase replicon system with similar results using full-length virus in HepG2 liver cells. One major drawback to both of these studies is the narrow window of virus replication observed. Increasing the duration of these experiments to determine how long the inhibitory effects siRNAs last is essential as persistent and chronic HEV infections will be the main population for antiviral therapy.",

Disrupting complex formation subsequently prevents ubiquitination and degradation of I\u03baB\u03b1, halting I\u03baB\u03b1's dissociation from NF-\u03baB.

Therefore, identification of the regions within ORF2 responsible for binding \u03b2TRCP and development of antiviral inhibitors for this interaction may enhance recognition and clearance of virus-infected cells (Fig 4B) . Another factor that must be overcome when using proteasome inhibitors for therapeutic purposes is their tendency to be broken down by liver microsomes. MG132 and epoxomicin are rapidly broken down by CYP3A whereas bortezomib and lactacystin are relatively stable 126 .

Recently, there has been significant research done in preventing release of enveloped particles through disruption of TSG101/late domain interactions. One drug candidate is a small molecule inhibitor derived from a library of cyclic inhibitors of protein-protein interactions. This drug inhibits the HIV-TSG101 interaction reducing viral budding by 67% 129 . As this inhibitor was generated against the HIV PSAP motif, which is the same motif found in the ORF3 of HEV, it seems probable that a similar effect would translate to HEV release. At the very least, HEV ORF3 could be subjected to a similar antiviral inhibition screen to identify potential inhibitors of ORF3-TSG101 that could disrupt HEV release.",

Enveloped HAV is cloaked from neutralizing antibodies within the serum of infected patients, allowing for viral spread in the presence of an active immune response. It will be interesting to determine whether HEV is similarly protected against a neutralizing antibody immune response and whether blocking the ORF3-TSG101 or even the ORF3-ORF2 interactions within the cell (Fig. 5 ) could bolster the immune response to unenveloped virus. One also has to consider whether enhancing the immune response to HEV could also increase immune-mediated damage to the liver leading to an increase in acute liver failure cases during treatment.

However, many of these findings require validation in the context of the entire infectious virus and within the host.

The recent discovery of the rabbit strains of genotype 3 HEV provide hope that a true small animal HEV model that can recapitulate the mortality seen in pregnancy is a promising development. Understanding the nuances of the rabbit HEV infection compared to human HEV infection will lead to a better understanding of how to utilize this model effectively to understand HEV pathogenesis. The rabbit model possesses many benefits including rabbits in which aspects of the immune system have been knocked. These gene knockout rabbits may even serve as a potential model to chronic HEV infection if we can get the virus to progress to chronicity in the absence of an immune response.

Ideally, these cell culture-adapted strains will be altered to allow for the generation of a DNA-launched infectious clone for HEV infection rather than relying on generation of capped RNA transcripts. As our knowledge of the viral genome increases, we may be able to insert reporters such as GFP or luciferase into the viral genome to allow for easier monitoring of virus infection, and thus developing better antiviral screening assays.

The effects of this deubiquitinating ability have not been fully understood but likely play a role in altering cellular signaling and potentially within the virus lifecycle. The importance of ubiquitin in the HEV lifecycle has also been shown through the use of proteasome inhibitors such as MG-132, which drastically reduced virus translation.
