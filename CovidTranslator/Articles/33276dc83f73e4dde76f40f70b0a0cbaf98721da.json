In the past two decades, there has been significant progress in viral detection methods for clinical diagnosis and environmental monitoring. The earliest advances were in molecular biology and imaging techniques. Advances in microfabrication and nanotechnology have now begun to play an important role in viral detection, and improving the detection limit, operational simplicity, and cost-effectiveness of viral diagnostics. Here we provide an overview of recent advances, focusing especially on advances in simple, device-based approaches for viral detection.",

In 1876, Alfred Mayer, a German agronomist, transmitted tobacco mosaic virus from one plant to another, fulfilling the Henle-Koch postulates for infectious agents [9] . In the 1880s, Louis Pasteur extracted rabies virus from the spinal cords of rabid dogs, and developed the rabies vaccine. The first detection of viruses may have been by the Scot John Buist in 1886, who stained scrapings of smallpox lesions and saw \"elementary bodies\" under the light microscope, which he mistook for bacteria; at a diameter of \u223c200 nanometers (nm), the largest smallpox viruses are at the limits of detection of light microscopy. Over the next 40 years, studies of the passage of \"filterable agents\"-small enough to squeeze through sub-micron porous filtersconfirmed the infectious nature of these so-called \"viruses\" and established their role in diseases ranging from polio and yellow fever in humans to foot-and-mouth disease in cattle to tobacco mosaic disease in plants.",

Most viruses trigger mammalian immune systems to produce virus-specific antibodies, and antibody serology has become a straightforward and mature technology used primarily for diagnosing retrospective bacterial or viral infection. Because of a \"window period\" that encompasses the first few weeks after exposure (before the host immune response has generated virus-specific antibodies to viral antigens), serology is inaccurate for acute viral infections. Serology is also challenged to distinguish recent from remote infection, as, once generated, IgG antibodies, which are the easiest to detect, persist for life. This can be overcome to some extent by looking for the IgM subclass of antibodies, which appear early after a viral infection, and disappear over time.",

Solid-phase IFA and EIA are currently the most popular anti-viral antibody detection platforms. Both types of assay rely on creating a sandwich structure around the target antibody, bound specifically between a surface-immobilized capture antigen and a detection molecule (e.g., a secondary anti-Ig antibody, or protein A). In IFAs, the detection tag is a fluorescent dye, the surface accumulation of which is indicative of the target antibody presence and is observed under a fluorescence microscope, fluorimeter, or fluorescence scanner. IFAs involve two binding steps, are relatively simple to operate, but usually necessitate skilled laboratory workers and the availability of a fluorescence detector.",

            "text": "In the last few decades, rapid lateral diffusion immunochromatographic assay platforms requiring only a single handling step have become popular for point-of-care uses, and have made disease diagnosis possible in remote settings. In these assays (Fig. 1) , a membrane strip serves as the solid support that carries a surface-immobilized antigen line or spot for target capture. The strip is also impregnated on one end with a loosely bound detection molecule conjugated with dyes or nanoparticles (such as colloidal gold). As a fluid sample is placed on the sample pad, the detection molecule binds to the target antibody in the sample, and the complex is carried forward to the antigen line/spot by capillary force. Binding of the target antibody to the antigen on the capture line then leads to a visible color change. These assays are rapid (\u223c15 min) and easy to operate (single-step), require small amounts of blood or other biological samples (ca a few hundred microliters) and can be deployed in low-resource, field settings. As a result, commercial rapid-assay kits are available for detecting numerous viruses. For HIV diagnosis alone, there are at least six FDA-approved rapid antibody tests [18, 19] using whole blood, serum, plasma and/or oral fluid as the target sample, and more than 20 rapid HIV tests have been evaluated by the World Health Organization's pre-qualification program [20] . On the down side, lateral flow immunoassays are slightly less sensitive [14] and are only semi-quantitative. For example, a few lateral flow strip kits for acute dengue infection have been found to have sensitivity lower than 25% [21] .",

The sensor requires multiple rinsing and incubation steps to form a sandwich structure and to accomplish the electrochemical reaction. In contrast, piezoelectric sensors detect the surface formation of antibody-antigen complexes directly, without the need for a detection molecule, thus requiring only a single sample-introduction step, followed by washing. Binding of the target antibody to the piezo material changes its intrinsic vibration frequency, which is measurable in real time. In one attempt to improve the detection limit of a piezoelectric sensor, Yang et al. [24] immobilized multilayers of viral particles on a quartz-crystal microbalance substrate.

For protein antigens, an additional step is generally required to extract the target protein from inside intact virions or host cells. If the host has developed an antibody response against the viral antigen, a treatment to disrupt the in vivo antigen-antibody complexes may also be necessary to release the viral antigen [25] . Similar to the serological tests, viral antigen detection on a solid support often suffers from unsatisfactory detection limits and low diagnostic sensitivity. For example, Weinberg et al. reported sensitivities between 40 and 80% for three commercially available influenza immunoassay kits based on EIA or rapid immunochromatographic lateral diffusion [26, 27] .",

These beads promote antibodyantigen interaction in a solution phase, reducing the diffusion limitation often observed at a low analyte concentration. An example is illustrated by a magnetic microparticle-based sandwich assay for detection of HCV core protein antigen in blood [25] . In this fully automated platform reported by Leary et al., the target antigen is sandwiched between a capture antibody immobilized on magnetic beads and a detection antibody labeled chemiluminescently. The sandwich structure is purified and enriched by rinsing under a magnetic field. Diagnostic sensitivity and specificity are both >95%. The method also enables quantitation of the HCV core protein, which may indicate disease progression. Although the detection limit does not reach that of nucleic acid amplification, the simple, automated operation process may be an important advantage in some settings.",

Nucleic acid amplification has been considered the gold standard for diagnosis of many viral infections, and has been the subject of several recent reviews [29, 30] . Evolution of PCR and related nucleic acid amplification technologies has seen the widespread use of real-time, quantitative tests, which link amplification with detection, and enable quantification of the target sequence copy number [31] [32] [33] . Conventional nucleic acid amplification generally requires experienced personnel and well-equipped laboratory facilities, and the operating costs are high compared with serology and simpler methods. This is reflected in the price at US clinical laboratories: lateral flow immunoassays can often be done for $10 whereas PCR-based nucleic acid detection methods typically cost $100 for clinical assays.

The first component is a shear-type filter for viral separation (Fig. 2 ) fabricated by deep reactive-ion etching and SiO 2 deposition. In this filter chip, microposts with submicron spacing line a microfluidic channel that dynamically separates virus-rich plasma from blood cells. The second component of the device lyses virions and extracts and captures RNA on a silica surface for downstream PCR. RNA from \u223c2500 viral particles in each milliliter of blood can be reliably retrieved for a positive PCR result in this device. In a separate study, Cho et al. engineered a platform for preparation of HBV RNA from blood samples using affinity magnetic beads. Virions captured on the beads are separated from blood cells and plasma proteins, and then lysed by laser irradiation to release viral nucleic acids [35] . This CD device prepares a viral genome in 12 min with a single handling step, significantly reducing the sample-preparation time and handling process for PCR. In addition to immunoaffinity separation, anionic magnetic beads have also been constructed to enrich viruses based on nonspecific interactions between virions and anionic polymers [36] . To reduce device fabrication cost, Bhattacharyya et al. recently developed thermal plastic chips impregnated with silica particles for solid-phase viral RNA extraction. This effort holds promise towards mass-produced disposable molecular diagnostic systems for infectious diseases. [37] Magnetic beads are also widely used to enrich viral nucleic acid sequences. The magnetic beads are conjugated with a DNA strand to hybridize with a target sequence, and plasma components detrimental to the PCR reaction are efficiently separated from the beads by flushing the beads under a magnetic field. A few studies have demonstrated that magnetic particles can isolate down to tens of copies of target sequences from one milliliter of serum [38] , which could then be amplified and detected by conventional means.",

Ang developed a microfluidic ELISA device that first trapped viralrecognizing microbeads in a filter structure, then captured virions on the beads, and, finally, detected the virions using fluorescent QDs conjugated with anti-viral antibodies. This device approach is faster, more sensitive, and better automated than the standard ELISA assay, but device fabrication requires high-resolution MEMS facilities.",

The technique makes use of the principle that biological particles are non-conducting at low frequencies, because of their membrane capacitance. When non-conducting particles displace a volume of conducting electrolyte (usually a salt buffer) inside the orifice, they momentarily increase the resistance measured across the orifice. The size of the resistance change is directly related to the volume of the particle. Coulter first described this method in the 1950s and commercially available instruments are widely used for enumeration and sizing of cells and other micrometer-sized particles. In the 1970s, Deblois and Wesley [93] described the use of a 400 nm diameter pore to accurately size a number of different viruses. The accuracy of the count and the sensitivity of detection was compromised by particle contaminants in the sample, and their lowest reliable sensitivity was 10 7 mL \u22121 . Their instrument, the \"Nanopar\", was capable of counting 10 9 -10 11 particles mL \u22121 in several minutes. More recently, Uram et al. was able to use a similar technique to detect the subtle size difference between plain and antibody-bound viruses [94] .

Perez et al. took advantage of this phenomenon for highly sensitive detection of viral particles by employing individual viruses as nucleation points for the assembly of iron oxide nanoparticles [3] (Fig. 7) . The particles were functionalized against the virus of interest, and simple mixing with the target virions would lead to formation of magnetic aggregates. A tabletop relaxometer was then used to take T2 measurements, and it was found that the relaxation time increased with the viral concentration, making viral quantitation possible. The detection limit of this method is around 10 3 particles mL \u22121 and it can be further improved by increasing the magnetic field.
