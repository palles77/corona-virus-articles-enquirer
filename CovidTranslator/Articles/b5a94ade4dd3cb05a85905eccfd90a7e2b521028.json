The case fatality ratio (CFR) is the fraction of cases that die after contracting a disease. The relative CFR is the factor by which the case fatality in one group is greater or less than that in a second group. Incomplete reporting of the number of infected individuals, both recovered and dead, can lead to biased estimates of the CFR. We define conditions under which the CFR and the relative CFR are identifiable. Furthermore, we propose an estimator for the relative CFR that controls for time-varying reporting rates. We generalize our methods to account for elapsed time between infection and death. To demonstrate the new methodology, we use data from the 1918 influenza pandemic to estimate relative CFRs between counties in Maryland. A simulation study evaluates the performance of the methods in outbreak scenarios. An R software package makes the methods and data presented here freely available. Our work highlights the limitations and challenges associated with estimating absolute and relative CFRs in practice. However, in certain situations, the methods presented here can help identify vulnerable subpopulations early in an outbreak of an emerging pathogen such as pandemic influenza.",

The absolute CFR has an obvious role-it provides a measure of the severity of the disease. For setting public health priorities, an order-of-magnitude estimate of the absolute CFR may be adequate, and sophisticated methods may not be needed. Once the severity of the disease has been established, the relative CFR takes on primary importance as it becomes the guiding principle for targeting interventions to those populations that are most at risk of severe outcomes. In the 2009 pandemic of influenza A (H1N1) we have a prime example. Early on, limited supplies of antivirals were the only option for prophylaxis and treatment of the disease, and public health agencies needed to decide how these should best be deployed. Later, as limited vaccine became available, officials had to prioritize subpopulations for vaccination. In many cases, targeting decisions came down to the relative severity of disease in different populations, i.e., the relative CFR. Hence, accurately estimating this quantity early in an epidemic in a changing surveil-lance environment is of great importance.",

(2005) developed methods to address the challenge of estimating the CFR in real time when the survival distribution of the disease is not known and when not all infected cases have died. Also motivated by the SARS epidemic, Jewell et al. (2007) developed nonparametric methods to estimate the CFR using a competing-risks framework from survival analysis. However, because the SARS outbreak was assumed to be fully observed-an assumption verified by subsequent serological analysis (Leung et al., 2004 )neither of these papers addresses issues of incomplete case ascertainment or changes in case reporting rates.",

They proposed an estimator that adjusts for the survival distribution of influenza but not for changes in reporting. Nishiura et al. (2009) developed methods to estimate the CFR in the middle of an epidemic. This method adjusts a na\u00efve estimator (which divides the total number of observed deaths by the number of observed cases) based on information about the (assumed known) survival distribution of the particular disease. These two papers proposed analogous estimators, similar to what we propose as the E-step of the expectation maximization (EM) algorithm for the lag-adjusted estimator (see Section 3.3 below). However, neither of these recent works investigated the effects of changes in reporting rates on their estimate of the CFR. Other papers have taken more direct approaches to estimate the CFR, using surrogate measures for the number of individuals who become infected and who die (Presanis et al., 2009) or simply by making ad hoc adjustments to the observed case counts to account for underreporting (de Silva et al., 2009; Donaldson et al., 2009; Wilson and Baker, 2009 ).",

When it is, we utilize loglinear regression to estimate the relative CFR-a method analogous to standard relative risk estimation (Frome and Checkoway, 1985) . Section 2 presents the notation and surveillance system typology. Section 3 introduces methods to estimate the relative CFR that can control for time-varying reporting and disease-delayed mortality.

In a covariateindependent model, the reporting rates do vary across time but, at a given t, are constant across covariate j. For example, reporting rates may improve over time as an outbreak develops and public health surveillance teams are mobilized. However, at any given time, the detection rates may be identical for, say, men and women. In a constant proportion model there is a constant factor which relates the reporting rates of cases to that of deaths. This type of model might be appropriate in nonoutbreak or endemic disease contexts. Finally, in a complete fatality reporting model, we assume that the reporting rate for recovered cases does not vary by covariate group and that the reporting rate for fatal cases is nearly 100%. This may be a feasible model to assume in an enclosed population or when there is good reason to believe that a surveillance system is identifying all deaths. Table 2 displays this classification that can be applied to disease surveillance systems and Figure 1 depicts the relationships between the different models.

A discretized version of a Weibull distribution (shape = 1.5, scale = 8) was truncated at 15 units and used for scenarios H and I. The survival probabilities for the 15 units are (0.05, 0.08, 0.09, 0.1, 0.1, 0.1, 0.09, 0.08, 0.07, 0.06, 0.05, 0.04, 0.04, 0.03, 0.02). This distribution has a mean of 6.75. Scenario H used these probabilities as the probabilities of death at time 1 through 15. Scenario I used the reversed vector of probabilities. Other distributions are described in Table 4 . Table 4 shows the simulation results and compares the estimators' MSE and bias. Comparing MSEs of the five estimators across the different scenarios, we see that the adjustment for survival time provides a large gain in efficiency when the assumed survival distribution has roughly the same mean as the truth. This holds for distributions with short survival times (scenarios A-E) as well as those with long possible survival times (scenarios F-J). In the 10 scenarios we studied, the MSEs for the lag-adjusted estimates that assumed a known survival distribution with the same mean as the truth were an order of magnitude smaller than those for the reporting-rate-adjusted estimator and two orders of magnitude smaller than the na\u00efve method. When the incorrect survival distribution was assumed, the lag-adjusted estimator's performance varied. When the true survival distribution was short but we assumed a long distribution, we overestimated the relative CFR. When the true survival distribution was long but we assumed a short distribution, we underestimated the true relative CFR. However, in these cases the lag-adjusted estimator was less biased on average and had a lower MSE than the reporting-rate-adjusted estimator. These results suggest that the central tendency of the survival distribution is more important to specify correctly than the spread. A more detailed analysis of these patterns could provide additional insight.",

Covariate independence implies that at every month t, the rates of case reporting are the same across all counties and the rates of reporting of deaths are the same across all the counties. The following inclusion criteria were chosen to control for county-level factors that we believed could impact reporting rates. The county must (1) have a hospital, (2) have population density less than 100 individuals per square mile, and (3) not contain military bases or installations. Eight counties met these criteria: Carroll, Cecil, Dorchester, Frederick, Somerset, Talbot, Washington, and Wicomico counties. Data on these county-level characteristics were obtained from the state Board of Health annual report, U.S. Census data, and an article on hospitals in the United States (Anonymous., 1921; Maryland State Board of Health, 1922; Department of Commerce, USA, 1924) . Because the time period of reporting (1 month) is generally thought to be greater than most survival times for influenza, we did not additionally adjust for prolonged survival after symptom onset.

For example, if the case reporting rate was higher in counties with higher white population, this may increase the denominator for estimating the CFR when compared with the other counties, leading to a reduction in the estimate of the relative CFR. Third, the variation in the estimated relative CFR appears to depend on geographical location as well. Carroll, Frederick, and Washington counties are all counties in central Maryland, near to Baltimore County and Baltimore City.

Accurate estimates of the relative CFR can help determine the optimal allocation of resources for surveillance, prevention, and treatment of disease. However, outbreak settings often generate data that are incomplete, where both recovered and fatal cases go unreported. In these situations, it is important to understand the assumptions necessary to identify an absolute or relative CFR, and to what extent those assumptions are realistic. We have shown that the absolute CFR is only identifiable when reporting rates for cases and deaths are equal to each other at every observation timepoint-a very unlikely scenario in practice. Furthermore, we have shown that only with fairly stringent assumptions about the way that reporting varies over time can a relative CFR be identified. However, when it is identifiable, our reporting-rate-adjusted and lag-adjusted estimators can provide unbiased or nearly unbiased estimates of the relative CFR while the na\u00efve estimator is virtually always biased, often severely so.",

If these delays are uniform across all cases, then this may not introduce bias. However if the delays are different for different subgroups, this may impact the performance of the proposed estimators. Also, when using the lag-adjusted estimator, we assume a survival distribution for the disease in question. Our simulation results (see Section 4.2 and Web Appendix D) suggest that knowing the exact distribution is not vital as long as it the center of mass is roughly centered on the truth (Table 4) , although it may increase the estimated variance of the estimates (Web Table 4 ). However, knowing the center of mass of a survival distribution may be difficult with an emerging pathogen.
