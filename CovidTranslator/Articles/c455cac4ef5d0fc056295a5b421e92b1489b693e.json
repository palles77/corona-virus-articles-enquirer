During the next months, the virus spread rapidly through the major pig producing areas of Western Europe. The virus has become enzootic in Germany, The Netherlands, Belgium, Spain, United Kingdom, France and Denmark since 1992 (Ohlinger et al., 1991; Wensvoort et al., 1991; Vynckier and Pensaert, 1993; Plana Duran et al., 1992a; Edwards et al., 1992; Albina et al., 1992; and Boetner et al., 1993) . Since that time, an increase in respiratory disease in weaners, growing and fattening pigs has been widely reported. The clinical picture is characterized by respiratory disorders, increased mortality and suboptimal performance. The PRRSV is often incriminated as the causative agent, but the signs observed in the field have never been reproduced experimentally.",

Most pigs are born from immune sows and thus have maternal antibodies during their first weeks of life. On breeding farms where the virus persists, pigs may or may not become infected with PRRSV before the age of 10 weeks. When infection occurs, maternal immunity is replaced by active immunity. In the absence of infection, maternal PRRSV antibodies do not persist beyond 10-l 1 weeks of age. Thus, pigs which are to be transported to industrial fattening farms and which have not previously been infected with PRRSV on the breeding farm are fully susceptible and have a high risk to contract the infection shortly after they are grouped together. In the study mentioned, it was shown that on the average 50% of the pigs entering intensive fattening units were devoid of PRRSV antibodies and that all these pigs had seroconverted to PRRSV 1 month later (Houben et al., 1995) . Around that age, the pigs are confronted with several respiratory infectious agents. Indeed, earlier studies have shown that infections with porcine respiratory coronavirus (PRCV) and swine influenza viruses (SIV) are extremely common shortly after grouping together of pigs in intensive fattening units (Van Reeth and Pensaert, 1994b) . Combined infections with the latter viruses and with PRRSV are, therefore, likely.",

At the time of the first inoculation, nasal swabs were virus-negative and sera were free of antibodies against the respective viruses. Three DPI with PRRSV, virus excretion was detected in every group inoculated. These results indicate that PRRSV was replicating in the respiratory tract of pigs at the time of inoculation with the second virus. At the end of the experiments, all pigs had seroconverted against the viruses with which they had been inoculated. ",

A short transient fever and inappetence were the only clinical signs observed in the present and other studies. Combined PRRSV-PRCV and PRRSV-SIV infections, on the other hand, consistently resulted in fever, respiratory illness and growth retardation. Growth retardation over a 14 day period was 2.7,4.6,1.8 and 1.9 kg in PRRSV-PRCV and PRRSV-SIV groups 1,2 and 3 respectively. We cannot explain why growth retardation also occurred following inoculation with PRCV-only, because pigs of this group were clinically normal and even lively throughout the observation period. Also, experimental PRCV infections have been performed frequently by the authors (Van Reeth and Pensaert, 1992) and generally had a mild or subclinical course.",

There is no doubt that other factors will also play a role. The variable clinical outcome in the pigs inoculated with PRRSV-SIV in the present experiment shows that the effect of the dual infections is not reproducible to the same level in every group. Three separate groups of pigs were inoculated with PRRSV-SIV. Respiratory disease, fever and growth retardation were much more severe in PRRSV-SIV group 1 than in groups 2 and 3. Still, there were no indications of concurrent infections with mycoplasma or other respiratory viruses in any of the groups. All the sera collected 1 month after the virus inoculations scored negative in a blocking ELISA test (Dako Mycoplusma hyopneumoniue ELISA; Feld et al., 1992) for detection of Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae antibodies. There was no serological evidence of an accidental infection with other viruses such as PRCV, Aujeszky's disease virus or H3N2influenza virus. Certainly, the variation in disease observed between experimentally inoculated pigs in the present study must also occur under field conditions and may be a reflection of hitherto undefined physiological parameters.",

            "text": "The viruses used for the experimental dual infections were purposely selected on the basis of a serologic study earlier performed in intensive fattening units in Belgium (Van Reeth and Pensaert, 1994b) . This study showed that infections with PRCV and HlNlinfluenzavirus are very common when 10 week old feeder pigs, derived from several breeding farms, are grouped together in intensive fattening units. Also, it was shown that infections with PRRSV systematically occur in such pigs (Houben et al., 1995) . Thus, combined infections with PRRSV and/or PRCV and/or HlNl-influenzavirus are likely to occur within a short time interval. Experiments in the authors' laboratory have shown that PRRSV can be isolated from the lungs of experimentally infected pigs until at least 1 month PI. Consequently, a primary infection with PRRSV can be easily followed by infection with other respiratory viruses, even when they occur with several weeks intervals. Definite proof is, however, still lacking to show that combined PRRSV-PRSV or PRRSV-SIV infections are the cause of increased respiratory problems in the field. There is an urgent need to study the true economical significance of dual virus infections under field circumstances. To obtain more clarity on this point, we intend to study the prevalence as well as the chronology of respiratory virus infections in young pigs and fatteners and the relationship between the infection patterns obtained and the disease observed. At this time, the exact mechanism of disease development in dual virus infections is not known. It is believed that direct structural damage following replication of 2 viruses in the lungs is at least partly responsible for respiratory disease. Mild to moderate degeneration and necrosis of the airway epithelia have been reported in experimental infections with PRRSV (Pol et al., 1991) , as well as with PRCV (Cox et al., 1990) and HlNl-influenzavirus (Haesebrouck and Pensaert, 1986) . Because of the apparent difference in lung cell tropism between PRRSV on the one side and PRCV and SIV on the other side, it seems only logical that a greater amount of lung tissue is damaged in dual virus infections than in single infections. Certainly, pathological changes will also occur indirectly as a result of the host's inflammatory response. Interstitial pneumonia with cellular infiltration in bronchial lumina and alveolar spaces, in alveolar septae and in blood vessels occurs with all 3 virus infections (Pol et al., 1991; Cox et al., 1990; Haesebrouck and Pensaert, 1986) . In the experimental PRRSV-PRCV and PRRSV-SIV infections, the peak of disease occurs later than the peak of replication of the second virus. This observation strongly supports that inflammation can play an important role in the development of clinical disease. In recent years, the importance of cytokines as mediators of virus-induced inflammatory responses has been recognized. Zhou et al. ( 1992) reported that high levels of interleukin-1 (IL-1) , one of the most potent inflammatory cytokines, are expressed in alveolar macrophages of PRRSV-infected pigs. IL-1 is also produced in the lungs of PRCV-infected pigs (Van Reeth and Pensaert, 1994~) . Possibly, unregulated large amounts of IL-1 and/ or other inflammatory cytokines and their complex interactions contribute to the development of pathology in dual infections in which PRRSV is involved.",

Interferon-a and tumour necrosis factor were shown to be released into the lungs of pigs following a PRCV infection (Van Reeth and Pensaert, 1994c) and these cytokines may mediate the PRCV-induced antiviral activity.
