We previously identified a novel C-type lectin-LSECtin predominantly expressed on liver sinusoidal endothelial cells. Here we demonstrate that LSECtin can interact with two HCV receptors, DC-SIGNR and CD81, through its central ectodomain. Furthermore, cells expressing LSECtin specifically can be attached by the naturally occurring HCV in the sera of infected individuals. This binding was found to be mediated by the HCV E2 glycoprotein and could be efficiently inhibited by EGTA but not by mannan treatment. The present study suggests that LSECtin interaction with DC-SIGNR might contribute to HCV binding to liver sinusoidal endothelial cells.",

Since liver is the major target organ of HCV infection, the expression pattern of HCV receptors has been suggested to be liver specific or dominant within the liver. In addition to cause an infection, HCV can use multiple attachment factors and receptors in parallel or in succession [4] . Dendritic cell-specific intercellular adhesion molecule-3-grabbing nonintegrin (DC-SIGN; also termed CD209) and DC-SIGN related (DC-SIGNR; also known as L-SIGN and CD209L) are two members of the C-type lectin family; these bind to viral glycoproteins such as E2 in HCV [9] [10] [11] [12] .",

LSECtin shares 32% and 31% amino acid sequence identities with DC-SIGNR and DC-SIGN, respectively, and has been shown to bind in vitro with mannose, GlcNAc, and fucose. Interestingly, LSECtin can be colocalized with DC-SIGNR on the LSECs [13] . Recent studies showed that LSECtin could bind to Ebola virus surface glycoprotein, filovirus glycoproteins, and the spike protein of SARS coronavirus [14] [15] [16] . In addition, LSECtin was also demonstrated to be expressed in human peripheral blood and thymic dendritic cells isolated ex vivo. LSECtin expression confers Ebola virus-binding capacity to leukemic cells, participates in antigen uptake and internalization, and therefore it functions as a pathogen receptor [17] . However, the potential role of LSECtin in HCV binding to LSECs was not fully understood.",

DC-SIGNR and CD81 are known HCV receptors expressed on LSECs. This knowledge prompted us to investigate whether LSECtin could interact with DC-SIGNR or CD81. First we detected the physical interactions of LSECtin with DC-SIGNR using co-immunoprecipitation assay (Co-IP) in the HEK293T cells co-transfected with LSECtin and DC-SIGNR expressing plasmids. As shown in Fig. 1a , ectopic expressed LSECtin could be coimmunoprecipitated with Myc-tagged DC-SIGNR in HEK293T cells. The reciprocal Co-IP assays also indicated that DC-SIGNR could be coimmunoprecipitated with LSECtin (Fig. 1b) . Then the soluble LSECtin adhesion assay was performed to confirm the interaction. The soluble LSECtin protein consisting of only the central ectodomain (aa 55-162) was incubated with the HEK293T cells transfected with DC-SIGNR or with vector-mock cells. Their associations were assessed by FACS assays with anti-LSECtin antibody. About a half of the DC-SIGNR-HEK293T cells were bound to the soluble Fc-LSECtin but not control-Fc protein, whereas only 6% of the mock cells were adhered to LSECtin (Fig. 1c) . Since soluble LSECtin contains only the ectodomain, this result implicated that the ectodomain of LSECtin was sufficient for its interaction with DC-SIGNR.",

The expressions of these mutants in cells were adjusted to a comparable level and the lysates in same amount were used as input for immunoprecipitation. The 5% inputs and IP products were run on SDS-PAGE gel and detected by western blotting. As shown in Fig. 1d To extend our conclusion, we further tested the interaction of LSECtin with another HCV receptor CD81. Co-IP assays and FACS analysis both showed that LSECtin could also interact with CD81 (Fig. 2a-c) . Due to the fact that HEK293T expresses high level of endogenous CD81, we also detected the interaction between Flag-LSECtin with endogenous CD81 (Fig. 2b) .

LSECtin can bind to carbohydrates such as mannose, GlcNAc, and fucose [13] ; this prompted us to investigate whether the interaction between the E2 glycoprotein and LSECtin was influenced by these agents. The binding of E2 with NIH3T3-LSECtin stable transfectants was efficiently inhibited by EGTA and less (Fig. 3e) ; the latter was a little different from that in the case of DC-SIGNR.

Similar to DC-SIGNR, LSECtin is expressed on liver sinusoidal endothelial cells, which are not the host cells in HCV infection. So we speculated whether LSECtin could capture viruses and had any effects on HCV infection in a manner similar to that of DC-SIGN and DC-SIGNR. NIH3T3 transfectants and Hep3B hepatocellular carcinoma cells (positive control) were infected with the HCV pseudotype particles and the luciferase activities were measured 48 h post-infection. Hep3B cells are highly permissive to HCV pseudovirus entry. By contrast, the infection of the NIH3T3-mock, NIH3T3-DC-SIGNR, and NIH3T3-LSECtin cells resulted in only low levels of luciferase activities, indicating that neither DC-SIGNR nor LSECtin facilitated HCV infection of NIH3T3 cells (Fig. 4b) . To detect and confirm the binding of the HCV virions present in the HCV-positive sera to LSECtin, we performed the virus-binding assay with patient serum. NIH3T3-LSECtin cells were bound to the HCV virions in all the three high-titer HCV-positive sera (above 10 5 copies), and the binding levels of LSECtin ranged from 10 to 30-folds that of the control cells (Fig. 4c) . The results suggested that LSECtin could interact with HCV virions in the HCV-positive sera. To investigate the binding specificity, we performed the inhibition experiments. The binding effects of NIH3T3-LSECtin cells to HCV virions could be blocked by either soluble LSECtin or EGTA, indicating the binding specificity and the Ca 2? -dependence (Fig. 4c) . Consistently with the conclusion of the soluble HCV-E2 binding assay (Fig. 3) , LSECtin binding to HCV virions could not be inhibited by mannan (Fig. 4c) , suggesting the similarity but not identity of LSECtin with DC-SIGNR in the HCV adhesion.",

            "text": "Our present study suggests that LSECtin, a recently identified C-type lectin, could interact with DC-SIGNR and CD81 and was involved in HCV binding. The coimmunoprecipitation assays and the soluble LSECtin adherence assays showed the interaction of LSECtin with DC-SIGNR and CD81. Moreover, liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs) serve as an active barrier between circulating blood and hepatocytes. During HCV infection in the liver, LSECs capture the circulating HCV particles, transmit the captured particles to the endothelial cells, and present them to the entry-permissive hepatocytes. The adherence of CD81-expressing cells to soluble LSECtin also implicated a potential interaction between CD81 on hepatocytes and LSECtin on LSECs, which may be involved in the transmission of the HCV virions to hepatocytes. This possibility should be further investigated in the future. Mapping analysis showed that the central ectodomain of LSECtin was both sufficient and necessary for interaction with DC-SIGNR and CD81. Deletion of the coiled-coil NIH3T3 cells were incubated with the sera from 3 HCV-infected patients for 2 h, washed three times, and then lysed. The HCV RNA was extracted and measured using real-time qPCR assay. The y-axis represents the log-fold increases above NIH3T3 cell binding in the graph region which might mediate the homo-tetramerization or hetero-oligomerization completely abolished the binding of LSECtin to DC-SIGNR (Fig. 1d) [15] . L-SIGN showed high affinity to high mannose oligosaccharides, but LSECtin bound with high selectivity to glycoproteins terminating in GlcNAcb1-2Man. We noted that mannan, a mannose polymer obtained from yeast cell wall, could not significantly block the binding of the E2 glycoprotein and HCV pseudotype particles with LSECtin (Fig. 3e, 4a and c) , while mannan could compete for binding to L-SIGN. These results suggested that the presence of various types of incompletely matured glycans may facilitate the interaction of enveloped viruses with multiple cell surface receptors. In addition, we observed similar affinities of LSECtin and DC-SIGNR to HCV-E2 in binding assays with soluble E2 proteins (Fig. 3e ) but different affinities in the assays with pseudotype particles (Fig. 4a) . This might be caused by different conformations of E2 proteins in different contexts or different length of ectodomains of LSECtin and DC-SIGNR. In this aspect, ectodomain length of type 2 C-lectins has been demonstrated critical for pathogen recognition [10, 11, 17] , and LSECtin ectodomain is shorter than DC-SIGNR ectodomain [13, 16] . Gramberg et al. previously reported that they could not detect the binding of HCV pseudotype particles to LSECtin expressed cells [14] , which is inconsistent with our results. This inconsistency may be from the different affinity of LSECtin to the variants of E2 protein from different HCV isolates. HCV can be classified into six major genotypes and further subdivided into at least 70 subtypes, which exhibit different phenotypic properties. It was reported that a soluble form of E2 protein had a significant genotypespecific difference in CD81 binding assay. In our present study, HCV E1E2 glycoprotein constructs were amplified using the infectious molecular clone H77 as the template. Another possibility is the different sensitivity in detecting the p24 antigen recovery with the different titer of HCV pseudotype particles because the affinity of LSECtin with HCV pseudotype particles was only half of DC-SIGNR.",

After washing times, the cells with adhered LSECtin were detected by FACS using an anti-Fc monoclonal antibody. Asterisk indicates that the difference is significant. d Co-IP assays for Myc-DC-SIGNR and Flag-tagged LSECtin wild-type and the indicated mutants.

Compared with the binding affinity of wild-type LSECtin to DC-SIGNR (indicated as onefold), the affinities of various LSECtin mutants to DC-SIGNR were D1, 1.2; D2, 0; M1, 0.8; M2, 1.5; D3, 0.8, respectively.

Our further investigations of LSECtin binding to HCV E2 glycoprotein suggested that both the ectodomain and the CRD domain are important for HCV binding, due to the fact that preincubation with the soluble ectodomain of LSECtin protein or EGTA, the Ca 2? binding chelator, could significantly blocked the LSECtin-HCV binding(Figs. 3c, d, e, and 4a, c). These results also implicated that the binding of DC-SIGNR with the ectodomain of LSECtin might contribute to the capacity of LSECtin for HCV adherence.Powlesland et al. demonstrated that LSECtin bind very distinct sets of glycan ligands compared with L-SIGN",
