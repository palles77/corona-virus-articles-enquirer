            "text": "All biological membranes exhibit some water permeability as a result of diffusion across the lipid bilayer; however, the degree of water permeability differs considerably between tissues and cell types. Mammalian red blood cells and renal proximal tubules are extremely permeable to water molecules. This remarkable feature led biophysicists to propose the hypothesis that water-selective channels must exist. The physiological importance of red cell water channels is still unclear; however, the kidney has a major role in body water balance, and permits survival despite severe water deprivation. The plasma membranes of certain other tissues are also highly permeable to water molecules, and transmembrane water movements are involved in diverse physiological processes including the secretion of cerebrospinal fluid, aqueous humor, sweat, tears, saliva, bile and amniotic fluid. Several observations have provided clues about how water channels function (reviewed in [1]). For example, it is thought that water traverses water channels as a singlefile column of molecules, because the ratio of osmoticdriven water permeability (Pf) to diffusional water permeability (Pd) is much greater than one. The selectivity for water is apparently explained by a narrow aqueous pore since such a channel would be permeable to water but not to protons, other ions, or small molecules. The Arrhenius activation energy measured for red cell Pf is similar to the diffusion of water in bulk solution (<5 kcalmol-1), which is considerably below the activation energy of the diffusional water permeability of simple phospholipid bilayers. Red cell and renal tubule water channels are selectively inhibited by HgC12 and certain organomercurials, indicating the presence of a critical sulflaydryl group in the pore [2] . Also, the wa-Biology 1994, 4:545-553 ter channels of red cells and renal proximal tubules seem to be constitutively activated, whereas the renal collecting duct is only permeable to water in the presence of vasopressin, which leads to the redistribution of collecting duct water channels from intracellular vesicles to the apical surface (reviewed in [3] ). Radiation target analysis initially showed that the size of the molecular water channel is 30kDa [4] , but attempts to determine its structure by biochemical approaches [5] and expression cloning [6] were unsuccessful. This was in part due to the inability to label the water channel with its substrate (as water is ubiquitous), the lack of a highly specific inhibitor (HgC12 labels all free sulfllydryls), and the diffusional permeability of cell membranes. Recently, however, significant progress has been made in identifying and characterizing the proteins responsible for water permeability, and the first steps towards a determination of their structure have been made.",

This 28 kDa channelforming integral protein (CHIP) has not been noticed by traditional SDS-PAGE as it fails to bind Coomassie stain [7] . CHIP resides within the lipid bilayer, as it is quantitatively included in the membrane vesicle fraction even after extraction with 1 M KI. CHIP is very abundant in red blood cells, -200 000 copies per cell [8] , and in apical brush border cells of renal tubules where it constitutes 4 % of the total protein [9] . ence of Mg 2+ ions. STEM mass measurements (Fig. 3b ) yielded a mass-per-area of single-layered CHIP square arrays of 4.1+0.27kDanm-2 (n=2160). The mass of one unit cell is therefore 378 kDa, accommodating two CHIP tetramers of 268kDa and phospholipids. Correlation averages calculated from electron micrographs of negatively stained CHIP lattices exhibited a prominent four-fold rotational symmetry [34\"'] . As shown in Fig. 3d each CHIP tetramer has four stain-excluding elongated domains of approximately 2.7 nm length and 1.6 nm width (bright shades) surrounding a central stain filled depression (dark shades). The tetramers are separated by rhomboid stained areas of approximately 7.3 nm length and 4.7 nm width that represent the liPid bilayer.",

There are consensus glycosylation sites containing asparagine in both loop A and loop E; however, only the loop A site is occupied by glycan, and therefore only this site is known to be extracellular. Additional analyses of different multiple site-directed CHIP mutants suggest that the glycosylation is kinetically controlled, since mutants that were retained in the endoplasmic reticulum had much higher proportions ofglycosylated subunits than the normal 1:3. The 20-amino acid E1 viral epitope was introduced into the amino and carboxyl termini and into the connecting loops B, C, D, and E. The water permeabilites ofoocytes expressing each of the recombinant proteins were determined; only recombinants with inserts in loops B and E were not active, indicating that these loops are important for function. Use of antiserum specific for the E1 and epitope selective proteolytic degradation of intact oocytes expressing recombinants established that loop C is extracellular. Similar analyses of microsomes isolated from oocytes established that the amino-and carboxyl-termini and loops B and D are cytoplasmic. These findings provide experimental evidence that the tandem repeats span the bilayer in opposite orientation.",

The double mutant Ala73--~Cys/Cys189--)Ser was constructed, and the Pf indicated full biological activity. When treated with HgC12, this double mutant was reversibly inhibited, although the sensitivity to the reagent was approximately one-third that of the wild-type CHIP [41\u00b0']. Although located in opposite halves of the molecule, both residues 73 and 189 appear to reside near critical narrowings of the water channel through CHIE Other studies in which similar conservative mutations were introduced at corresponding sites in loop B or loop E confirmed that these locations were structurally similar. A possible explanation of this behavior is that loop 13 may fold into and out of the cytoplasmic leaflet of the bilayer, and loop E may do the same at the extracellular side (similar to the H5 loop of potassium channels). If the two halves of the molecule are juxtaposed, loops B and E could form a single central sleeve surrounded by the six bilayer spanning domains (Fig. 5b) .

When four CHIP subunits oligomerize, the shelves formed by loops B and E assemble into a thin barrier which separates the deep central cavity at the outer surface from the narrower cavity at the inner surface of the tetramer.
