            "text": "Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) is an important emerging pathogen that was first described in 2012. While the cell surface receptor for MERS-CoV has been identified as dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4), the mouse DPP4 homologue does not allow virus entry into cells. Therefore, development of mouse models of MERS-CoV has been hampered by the fact that MERS-CoV does not replicate in commonly available mouse strains. We have previously described a mouse model in which mDPP4 was replaced with hDPP4 such that hDPP4 is expressed under the endogenous mDPP4 promoter. In this study, we used this mouse model to analyze the host response to MERS-CoV infection using immunological assays and transcriptome analysis. Depletion of CD4 \u03e9 T cells, CD8 \u03e9 T cells, or macrophages has no effect on MERS-CoV replication in the lungs of infected mice. However, we found that depletion of CD8 \u03e9 T cells protects and depletion of macrophages exacerbates MERS-CoV-induced pathology and clinical symptoms of disease. Overall, we demonstrate an important role for the inflammatory response in regulating MERS-CoV pathogenesis in vivo. IMPORTANCE The Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) is a highly pathogenic respiratory virus that emerged from zoonotic sources in 2012. Human infections are still occurring throughout Saudi Arabia at a 38% case fatality rate, with the potential for worldwide spread via air travel. In this work, we identify the host response to the virus and identify inflammatory pathways and cell populations that are critical for protection from severe lung disease. By understanding the immune response to MERS-CoV we can develop targeted therapies to inhibit pathogenesis in the future.",

This limited-duration study, up to 4 days postinfection, did not demonstrate significant clinical signs of MERS-CoV infection, e.g., weight loss (27) . In this study, we describe and characterize this novel mouse model for MERS-CoV infection in more detail. We find that from 5 to 7 days postinfection, MERS-CoV-infected mice display significant signs of clinical disease, including weight loss, ruffled fur, and labored breathing as well as significantly increased lung damage and inflammation. Analysis of lung inflammation in MERS-CoV-infected mice revealed alterations in the chemokine and cytokine response and leukocyte infiltration consistent with T cell-and macrophage-mediated responses. Transcriptome profiling corroborates these observations and suggests that there is also fibrotic gene upregulation, damage to the lung endothelium, and depletion of B cells in MERS-CoV-infected lungs. Using inflammatory cell depletion experiments, we further conclude that CD8 \u03e9 T cells exacerbate severe MERS-CoV lung disease while macrophages play a role in suppressing MERS-CoVinduced lung disease.",

When developing a mouse model expressing the human virus receptor, a major concern is ensuring correct tissue distribution of the protein. Endogenous DPP4 expression is not restricted to the lungs and also has a distinct tissue distribution, with some organs expressing higher levels than others (reviewed in reference 24). By maintaining the mDPP4 gene promoter and the 3= untranslated region (UTR) to control hDPP4 (27) , we aimed to achieve a model in which hDPP4 matched the tissue distribution and expression levels observed for endogenous mDPP4. To test this, we compared hDPP4 mRNA expression to mDPP4 mRNA expression in a range of organs and in blood.",

The one significant discrepancy was in the kidney, where hDPP4 expression in hDPP4 \u03e9/\u03ea and hDPP4 \u03e9/\u03e9 mice was significantly higher than mDPP4 expression in hDPP4 \u03ea/\u03ea or hDPP4 \u03e9/\u03ea mice; for example, hDPP4 in hDPP4 \u03e9/\u03ea compared to mDPP4 in hDPP4 \u03ea/\u03ea ; P \u03fd 0.001) (Fig. 1A) .

We have previously shown that MERS-CoV titers and RNA were detectable in the lungs of MERS-CoV-infected mice up to 4 days postinfection (27) . To extend these data and to confirm that mice infected with 2.5 \u03eb 10 2 , 2.5 \u03eb 10 3 , or 2.5 \u03eb 10 4 PFU were productively infected with MERS-CoV, we assessed MERS-CoV titers and RNA levels over a longer time course. As the mice infected with 2.5 \u03eb 10 4 PFU had all dropped below 80% of their starting body weight at 7 days postinfection and had to be sacrificed per IACUC regulations, there were no mice in this group for analysis at days 14 and 21 postinfection (Fig. 2B , C, and D, marked N/A). MERS-CoV titer was assayed by plaque assay on Vero cells, and MERS-CoV genomic RNA and mRNA levels were assayed by a TaqMan quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) assay. Genomic RNA levels report on the amount of viral genome detected in the lungs, while the mRNA TaqMan primers detect only replicating virus by using a MERS-CoV Leader-specific primer as the 5= primer. The mRNA primers report the presence of mRNAs that are found only when MERS-CoV is replicating in cells. (Fig. 2D) were detected in all infected groups, though we did observe a dose-dependent decrease in MERS-CoV RNA levels at day 7 postinfection compared to day 4 postinfection for all doses ( Fig. 2C and D) . We suspect both that the TaqMan assay to detect RNA is more sensitive than plaque assay and that the viral RNA may be stable longer in the lungs than live virus. Using these assays, neither MERS-CoV (Fig. 2B ) nor MERS-CoV genomic RNA (Fig. 2C ) was detected at days 14 or 21 postinfection in mice infected with 2.5 \u03eb 10 2 or 2.5 \u03eb 10 3 PFU MERS-CoV except for the 2.5 \u03eb 10 2 group at day 14, in which we observe genomic RNA just above background levels. Low levels of MERS-CoV M mRNA, 3 log lower than the day 7 time point, were detectable at days 14 and 21 postinfection in mice infected with either 2.5 \u03eb 10 2 or 2.5 \u03eb 10 3 MERS-CoV (Fig. 2D) .",

The second cluster (Fig. 4A , orange) shows a more gradual pattern, with expression increasing over the time course of infection or only at day 7. Many genes in this category were associated with cell adhesion and wound-healing functions. Thus, while genes in the red group signify the acute phase of fibrosis, those in this orange group (e.g., Col3a1 and other collagens, Tgfb1) were associated with more-established disease. Proteasome components are also highly enriched in this group, with expression peaking at day 7 postinfection (Fig. 4B , brown lines). The largest category derived from unsupervised clustering (Fig. 4A, cyan) showed the inverse pattern, with expression diminishing toward the later time points of infection. Functional groups enriched for genes within this category included angiogenesis (Vegfa, Dll4), the Notch pathway (Hey1, Hes1, and Nrarp), and endothelial markers (Robo4, Pecam1) (cyan, aqua, and light blue lines in Fig. 4B) .",

We observed a sudden increase in T cell markers such as Cd3e and Themis by day 7, though not before (Fig. 4B, magenta lines) . Thus, there is a pronounced delay between elevated cytokine expression and recruitment of T cells. Genes associated with macrophage proliferation were significantly upregulated upon MERS-CoV infection, with C1qc and C1qa levels increasing 2-fold by day 2 compared to mock-infected controls and reaching over 6-fold by day 7 (Fig. 4B, pale red lines) .

Previously described mouse models for MERS-CoV infection do not exhibit these traits and thus do not accurately reflect human disease. Here we showed that in humanized mice, hDPP4 expression by organ and immune cell type was equivalent to endogenous mDPP4 expression. Further, we show that infection of hDPP4-expressing mice with different doses of MERS-CoV yields three different disease phenotypes: 2.5 \u03eb 10 4 PFU MERS-CoV causes a 20% weight loss from day 5 to day 7 postinfection; 2.5 \u03eb 10 3 PFU MERS-CoV causes a 10% weight loss by day 7 postinfection, from which the mice recover; and 2.5 \u03eb 10 2 PFU MERS-CoV has no effect on the weight of mice. This is despite the finding that infectious MERS-CoV and MERS-CoV RNA can be recovered from the lungs of mice infected with all three doses, though levels depend on the inoculated dose. All infected mice were clear, or almost clear, of infectious MERS-CoV in the lungs by day 7 postinfection. Interestingly, in mice that survived past 7 days postinfection, MERS-CoV mRNA was still detectable at 21 days postinfection, albeit at much lower levels than at the peak of infection, and there was no evidence of MERS-CoV genomic RNA in the lungs of infected mice at this time point. We hypothesize that the detection of MERS-CoV mRNA at this late time point is due to either inherent differences in levels of detection by plaque assays and by qPCR or to the fact that there is a substantial presence of viral RNA that is maintained in a cell population in the lungs after the virus is cleared. Whether this RNA is able to produce live virus at extended time points or potentially under immune cell depletion conditions is unknown. Experiments comparing viral RNA levels and depletion experiments during longer infection times will be analyzed in the future. Studies have shown that MERS-CoV is capable of spreading to other organs in infected mice when DPP4 is expressed under a strong ubiquitous promoter (23, 25) . The recent human case report suggests that MERS-CoV does not spread to any other organ during human infection (10) , and we could find no evidence of MERS-CoV spread to the brain, kidney, or liver in C57B6/hDPP4 mice that were exposed to our highest dose of MERS-CoV and succumbed to fatal infection. We detected small amounts of MERS-CoV RNA in the blood and spleen of infected mice, suggesting that MERS-CoV is present in the blood or a circulating cell, such as T cells (6), but the clinical significance of this is unclear. There are only minimal data for the blood titer or immune cell infections in vivo in human infections. We hypothesize that the immune cell component of MERS-CoV pathogenesis may provide legitimate models of infection in vivo, for example, in circulating T cells. Without additional human MERS-CoV data, it is difficult to know for certain; however, the role of the immune cell component in MERS-CoV pathogenesis and replication is an active area of research in the B6/hDPP4 mouse model.",

The cellular sources of these cytokine and chemokine transcripts are under investigation, but in light of previous studies (7, 8) , macrophages may be a significant source of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines during MERS-CoV infection, regardless of whether they do (8) or do not (7) facilitate productive MERS-CoV replication. The role of macrophages and monocytes in human disease is unknown due to the minimal clinical data from MERS patients. The analysis of MERS-CoV replication or the role of murine macrophages compared to that of human macrophages in pathogenesis in vivo is difficult due to the lack of human samples. However, the B6/hDPP4 mouse model can be used to answer the question of how murine monocytes and macrophages respond to MERS-CoV infection and affect disease.

Our data suggest that this is not due to the physical presence of large numbers of CD8 \u03e9 T cells blocking gas exchange, as pathology scores reveal, if anything, more lymphocytes in the lungs of CD8 \u03e9 T cell-depleted mice. Previous studies have shown that there is no difference between CD4 \u03e9 and CD8 \u03e9 T cells in terms of permissiveness to MERS-CoV infection and that MERS-CoV causes T cell apoptosis in mixed T cell cultures (6) . Therefore, we hypothesize that there is a unique response of CD8 \u03e9 T cells to MERS-CoV infection that is responsible for the physical symptoms of disease.

The mechanism of action is under investigation, but one possibility is that macrophages produce a cytokine/chemokine that protects the lung from excessive inflammation. This is intriguing because previous work on the SARS-CoV demonstrated that macrophages in the lungs of mice were detrimental to lung pathology and clearance of SARS-CoV by inhibiting efficient T cell responses (30) . Investigation of the differences between SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV in this context may reveal crucial host responses that determine how macrophages respond differently to these highly pathogenic coronaviruses.",

In that study, MERS-CoV was not cleared from mice that genetically lack all T cells (TCRa \u03ea/\u03ea ) but was cleared at levels similar to those of wild-type mice in mice lacking B cells (uMT \u03ea/\u03ea ). We found that antibody-based depletion of CD4 \u03e9 or CD8 \u03e9 T cells in adult mice had no significant effect on MERS-CoV titers in the lungs of infected mice, suggesting that in our mouse model with depletion, neither subtype alone plays a significant role in the clearance of MERS-CoV. There are marked differences between these two mouse models that could be responsible for the differences in results. First, the Ad/hDPP4 model transduces hDPP4 into any cells that the adenovirus can infect in the lungs, not necessarily the cells that natively express hDPP4. In addition, the expression levels of hDPP4 in the Ad/hDPP4 model vary from the endogenous hDPP4 levels seen in the B6/hDPP4 mice in this study. The MERS-CoV inoculum may also be responsible for the differences, since the inoculum used in this study was one that caused high levels of infection, lung pathology, and clinical disease, which could be overwhelming to the immune response and mask small differences in MERS-CoV replication that may have a much more significant effect on MERS-CoV when the initial inoculum is lower. Finally, the depletion experiments do not result in a total lack of either T cell-type in the lungs, in contrast to the complete knockout mouse experiments in the study by Zhao et al. (22) . Therefore, we cannot rule out that there may be a role for T and B cells in the control of viral load for MERS-CoV that was not observed using our current experimental approaches. Comparisons of viral dose, cell depletions, and background differences between the two models would be informative in the future.",
