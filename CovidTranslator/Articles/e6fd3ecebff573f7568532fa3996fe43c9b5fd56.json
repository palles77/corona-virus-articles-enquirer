Since then the study of cytotoxic lymphocytes has been extended to various cellular reactions of adaptive immunity, directed against transplantation antigens on allogeneic cells, viral antigens, tumorassociated antigens, and self-antigens in autoimmune pathology (2, 3) . The specific adaptive cytotoxic response against transplantation alloantigens is mediated by thymus-dependent effector T lymphocytes. The alloantigens recognized by the cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) were shown to be encoded by genes of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) (4) and were later identified as the products of MHC class I and class I1 genes (5-7).",

Lymphocytes from any healthy donor, as well as peripheral blood and spleen lymphocytes from several experimental animals, in the absence of known or deliberate sensitization, were found to be spontaneously cytotoxic in vitro for some normal fresh cells, most cultured cell lines, immature hematopoietic cells, and tumor cells (11) (12) (13) (14) (15) (16) . This type of nonadaptive, non-MHC-restricted cellmediated cytotoxicity was defined as \"natural\" cytotoxicity, and the effector cells mediating natural cytotoxicity were functionally defined as natural killer (NK) cells. The existence of NK cells has prompted a reinterpretation of both the studies of specific cytotoxicity against spontaneous human tumors (17) and the theory of immune surveillance, at least in its most restrictive interpretation, based on a predominant role of adaptive immunity and tumor antigen-specific CTLs (18, 19) .",

It is now known that different types of lymphocytes and other leukocytes can mediate non-MHCrestricted cytotoxicity either spontaneously or upon activation. However, most cells mediating natural cytotoxicity in humans and many other species share similar functional characteristics, and the cells appear to constitute a discrete cell subset. Unlike cytotoxic T cells, NK cells cannot be demonstrated to have clonally distributed specificity, restriction for MHC products at the target cell surface, or immunological memory. NK cells cannot as yet be formally assigned to a single lineage based on the definitive identification of a stem cell, a distinct anatomical location of maturation, or unique genotypic rearrangements. Thus, some investigators have suggested that NK cells be defined operationally, referring to any lymphoid cell from an unimmunized host mediating MHCunrestricted cytotoxicity (20, 21) .",

NK cells, therefore, represent a discrete leukocyte subset, possibly constituting a third lineage of lymphoid cells (22) (23) (24) (25) . Although the exact characterization of the NK cell subset and its possible heterogeneity still requires detailed analysis, a consensus on an operational definition of NK cells was reached at the Fifth International Workshop on Natural Killer Cells in 1988 (26) . NK cells have been defined as large granular lymphocytes (LGLs) that do not express on their surface the CD3 antigen or any of the known T cell receptor chains (i.e., a, 6, 7 , or 6) but do express CD16 and NKH-1 (Leu-19) cell surface markers in humans and NK-l.l/NK-2.1 in mice and mediate cytolytic reactions even in the absence of MHC class I or class I1 expression on the target cells (26).",

The cytotoxic ability of NK cells may or may not represent the most physiologically significant function of these cells in vivo. NK cells, together with monocyte/macrophages, PMNs, platelets, etc., are an important effector cell type of nonadaptive immunity. In mediating these functions, the activity of NK cells is regulated by a complex network of cellular and humoral interactions with cell types of the adaptive and nonadaptive immune systems, nervous system, and others. Although many tesserae of this mosaic are still incomplete or missing, this review attempts to summarize the experimental evidence pointing to NK cells as a discrete cell subset that is highly regulated in its interaction with other systems of the organism.",

The most sensitive and widely used target cell for human NK cells is K562 (ll), a cell line derived from a patient with chronic myeloid leukemia in blastic crisis (37). These cells lack MHC class I and class I1 antigens and can be induced to differentiate in vitro to cells with myeloid, erythroid, or megakaryocytic characteristics (38, 39).

Antibody-sensitized nonnucleated erythrocytes are efficient target cells for ADCC mediated by monocytes and PMNs, but not by human NK/K cells (44). However, the use in ADCC of target cells that are sensitive to NK cell lysis in the absence of antibodies has complicated the interpretation of many studies.

In many studies NK cytotoxicity is expressed as the percentage of 51Cr release at an arbitrarily chosen E : T ratio. However, the use of a single E : T ratio precludes a quantitative comparison of the relative cytotoxicity mediated by different donors or by the same lymphocyte preparations after different treatments. Figure 1 illustrates the great difference in relative NK activity of two donors, A and B, measured by using the percentages of 51Cr release at different E : T ratios. Comparing the percentages of 51Cr release at a given E : T ratio can yield the rank order of the cytotoxicity mediated by the cells of the two donors, but not a quantitative evaluation of the relative cytotoxicity. The use of several E : T ratios yields a quantitative evaluation of cytotoxicity by measuring lytic units (LU), defined as the number of effector cells required to lyse a given proportion (optimally SO%, but often 20 or 30% was used) of target cells in the assay period (3). This number can be extrapolated graphically or computed based on equations (43, 46, 47) that describe the relationship between effector cell concentration and percentage of 51Cr release ( Figs. 1 and 2) . The use of LUs transforms a series of dose-response data to a single number (with standard errors, etc.) which is based on all of the data and which is directly proportional to NK cell lytic activity. 10 and 50 is indicated on the figure. Sigmoidal curves for the two donors were plotted using the modified von Kroghs equation (see text). When y is equal to A / 2 , K is equal to x, i.e., K X lo4 is equal to the number of effector cells required to lyse half of the target cells (5 X lo3) and is defined as 1 LU. LUs calculated in this way can be used to quantitate the cytotoxicity of different effector cell preparations when the slopes (n) of the different sigmoidal curves are similar. The ratio K B / K A represents the relative cytotoxic efficiency of the two cell preparations calculated based on all of the experimental points.",

The exponential fit equation defines a sigmoidal curve on a semilog plot (e.g., Fig. 2, top) . The von Krogh equation (49, 50) was originally described as an application of the Hill transformation (51) to the analysis of complement lysis and was modified for use in the analysis of 51Cr-release data. Unlike complement lysis, where 100% hemolysis is obtainable, it is difficult to evaluate the maximum release of the isotope in the 51Cr-release method. Complete release of incorporated 51Cr is never observed, and most investigators use detergent lysis (usually 80-90% of incorporated isotope) as a measure of maximum release. However, the values observed for the maximum release upon cell-mediated cytotoxicity are usually lower than those obtained with detergent lysis and are variable among different target cells and experiments. Thus, the von Krogh equation had to be modified for analysis of 51Cr-release data by the introduction of the constant A equal to the asymptote of the 51Cr-release doseresponse curve (43). The asymptote A has been estimated either by computer iteration (43) or experimentally (46). Like the exponential fit equation, the von Krogh equation also defines a sigmoid curve (Figs. l and 2, top panel), but contains a third variable which makes it possible to fit data in which there is a longer lag phase and a more abrupt rise in cytotoxicity in the exponential part of the curve. The modified von Krogh equation (43, 47) can be written as (3) and a family of curves with the same n and A will therefore yield a series of parallel and straight lines when plotted log[y/(Ay)] versus log x (Fig. 2, bottom left) .",

In sequential studies normalization of the assay is necessary in order to compare the results obtained in different experiments. The work of Pross and collaborators (48, 52-55), who studied this problem in detail, has generated several suggestions for the normalization of the NK cell assay. The rank of cytotoxic activity mediated by lymphocytes from normal donors remains relatively constant over an extended period, in the absence of situations such as infection or drug treatment that alter NK cell activity (52, 56). It is therefore possible to normalize the cytotoxic assay by using in each experiment a group of control donors with similar average activity, but not necessarily the same control donors in each experiment. However, because the repeated use of fresh normal controls is frequently impractical, cryopreserved lymphocytes are often used. NK cell functions are usually markedly reduced after cryopreservation (57), but are almost completely recovered if the lymphocytes are incubated for a few hours at 37OC after thawing (53). Although cryopreservation may reduce the absolute cytotoxic activity, the relative cytotoxicity of lymphocytes obtained from different donors is maintained, making the use of cryopreserved lymphocytes for normalization of the cytotoxic assay possible (53). Normalization in the cytotoxic assay is absolutely necessary in order to compare results within experiments or among different laboratories. Unfortunately, many of the published analyses of NK cell activity in patients completely lack any normalization.",

Alcohol, smoking, various common drugs (such as salicylates), stress, and concurrent diseases (such as infections) may also alter NK cell activity in vivo.

In the single-cell cytotoxic assay in agarose, effector and target cells are allowed to form conjugates in a pellet for a few minutes, and the conjugates are then immobilized in smears of semisolid medium (agarose) (59, 60). The NK cells are prevented from recycling by the agarose. The smears, on petri dishes or on microscope slides, are incubated at 37OC for various periods, and the dead cells are evaluated by dye exclusion, using trypan blue. The slides can then be fixed and the conjugates and lytic conjugates can be counted. Different investigators have reported 15-40 % human peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBLs) forming conjugates with K562 cells (48, 61-63). Although a large proportion of NK cells [up to 100% after interferon (IFN) stimulation] bind to target cells, not all conjugateforming cells in human peripheral blood are NK cells. This has been clearly shown in several studies in which the phenotype of binding cells has been analyzed (63-66). As evaluated in the single-cell assay, the frequency of lytic NK cells in human peripheral blood has been reported to be 1-5% (61, 63). Combined use of the single-cell cytotoxic assay in agarose and estimation of the maximum NK cell cytotoxic potential by 51Cr release to study recycling of effector cells indicated that, on average, an NK cell can lyse 2.3 target cells (62, 67) .",

Initial studies of the kinetics of cellular cytotoxicity reactions generally applied the equation for simple enzyme kinetics originally developed by Michaelis and Menten (68-70). However, cellular cytotoxicity reactions do not follow simple Michaelian kinetics. The experimentally determined apparent Michaelis constant (KagP) varies in proportion to the number of lymphocytes present in the assay system (71). Because of the differences between enzyme-catalyzed reactions and cellular cytotoxicity reactions, more complex models were developed. Merrill(72) developed more general equations that took into account the possibility of noncytotoxic lymphocytes binding to target cells and inhibiting cytotoxicity. In this model Vmax, the maximum velocity for a natural cytotoxicity reaction, is expressed as where [L] is the lymphocyte concentration, f is the fraction of targetbinding lymphocytes, a is the fraction of cytolytically active target-binding lymphocytes, and Ftz is the rate constant for target cell lysis. The expression of KagP that results from this model is very complex and takes into consideration the rate constants for programming for lysis (see Section V) and for target cell disintegration, the dissociation constant for target conjugates of nonlytic lymphocytes, and the fractions of lymphocytes that bind target cells and lyse target cells (72). However, for cytotoxicity mediated by human NK cells, Callewaert et al. (73, 74) determined that programming for lysis is the rate-limiting step and the value of KagP is directly related to the frequency of target-binding cells within the lymphocyte population. Ka$P can be approximated by the expression where K , is the standard Michaelis-Menten constant and KI is the dissociation constant for target-binding nonlytic lymphocytes.",

These results suggest that, although NK cells are able to lyse more than one target cell, their recycling ability, unlike that of CTLs, is extremely modest (76). The kinetics analysis of NK cell cytotoxicity is further complicated when target cell preparations are used that stimulate production of lymphokines, affecting NK cell cytotoxicity during the assay. For example, production of IFN-CY or -7, by NK cells or other cell types present in the lymphocyte preparation, is observed when target cells are sensitized with IgG antibodies (78) or infected with viruses (79, 80) or mycoplasmas (81, 82).

IDENTIFICATION OF NK CELLS Identification of NK cells based solely on their ability to mediate spontaneous and antibody-dependent cytotoxicity, a function shared with other cell types, such as monocyte/macrophages and activated T cells, has represented a major limitation in the analysis of N K cells. One of the most significant contributions to the study of N K cells has been their identification as a relatively homogeneous cell type on the basis of physical and phenotypic characteristics and their LGL morphology (35). Human N K / K cells were originally described as nonadherent , nonphagocytic, FcyR-positive cells with lymphoid morphology. Although velocity sedimentation experiments demonstrated that human K cells were larger than the bulk of T lymphocytes (44), it was not until Saksela, Timonen, and collaborators (35, 83, 84) analyzed cytotoxic effector cells adsorbedeluted from both fibroblast and cell line target cells that N K cells were identified as LGLs, i.e., large lymphocytes with a high cytoplasm-nuclear ratio and few discrete azurophilic granules. A separation technique involving a discontinuous Percoll gradient has been widely used for the enrichment of LGLs based on their light buoyant density (85). This technique has contributed much to the progress of studies of N K cells, allowing investigations utilizing semipurified preparations of N K cells. Such preparations have been used for the analysis of surface phenotype and morphology as well as functional characteristics of NK cells (86-90). However, the use of these semipurified preparations has also generated considerable artifact and confusion, due mostly to disregard of the following facts: (1) LGL morphology is not unique to NK cells, and not all NK cells may have typical LGL morphology at all times during differentiation and functional activation (91); (2) light-density Percoll fractions, although enriched for NK cells/LGLs, also contain monocytes, dendritic accessory cells, human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-DR+ IFN-a-producing cells, T cell blasts, and memory T cells (92, 93), and even some of the most careful purification procedures could not completely eliminate all of these contaminant cell types; (3) whereas light-density Percoll fractions are enriched for accessory cells, enriched T cell preparations from high-density fractions are completely devoid of accessory cells; thus, some of the reported differential activity of NK and T cells might rest in the presence or absence of accessory cells in the cell preparations used.",

The presence of complement receptors (CRs) on NK cells has been a controversial issue (11, (105) (106) (107) . Most NK cells are now known to express the receptor for C3bi (CR3 or CDllb) but not those for either C3b (CR1 or CD35) or C3d (CR2 or CD21) (108-111). The use of monoclonal antibodies has revealed no surface antigen unique to NK cells, but rather a unique combination of antigens, each shared with other cell types, mainly T cells and myelomonocytic cells. Figure 4 summarizes the antigenic phenotype of NK cells in comparison to other leukocyte populations. Often, these cell surface markers are not present on all NK cells, suggesting some heterogeneity within the NK cell population. In general, human NK cells lack cell surface marker characterisrics of B cells, with the exception of the recently described CB02 antigen, present on B cells and a subset of NK cells (112). Most investigators agree that resting human NK cells do not significantly express class I1 MHC antigens (95, 113, 114), although Brooks and Moore (115) have reported the expression of HLA-DR, -DP, and -DQ antigens on a subset of NK cells.",

In the peripheral blood, CD16 is expressed on virtually all neutrophils, but only on eosinophils with a more mature morphology. Basophils do not express CD16 FcR.

Another anti-CD16 monoclonal antibody, B73.1 (95), reacts with the large majority of human NK cells. CD16+ lymphocytes contain virtually all of the lymphocytes able to mediate spontaneous cytotoxicity. Although not present exclusively on NK cells, the CD16 antigen still represents the best marker to identify and purify NK cells among peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Unlike 3G8, antibody B73.1 reacts with PMNs of only 50% of donors; both antibodies react with NK cells from all donors. Other antibodies that cross-compete with B73.1 but not with 3G8 for binding to NK cells also react with PMNs from only a proportion of donors. 3G8 and B73.1 (and other antibodies, such as anti-leu-lla/b, CLB FcR-gran 1, and VEP-13) react with at least two different determinants on the CD16 molecule (28). Although the significance of this differential cellular reactivity of anti-CD16 antibodies to different determinants of the molecule is unknown, this observation points to a possible heterogeneity of the CD16 molecule on different cell types. The anti-CD16 antibody, CLB-gran 11, never reacts with NK cells and detects only PMNs of donors carrying the allele NA1 (phenotypic frequency, 46 %) of the neutrophil-specific NA antigen biallelic system (119).

The first 18 residues have the typical feature of a secretory signal sequence. The signal peptide is followed by two Ig-related segments with two intrachain disulfide bonds and significant homology to members of the constant-region C-2 set of the Ig superfamily. The predicted molecular mass of the expected polypeptide ( -25 kDa) is consistent with that observed for CD16 molecules precipitated from PMNs and treated with N-glycanase. The polypeptide sequence ends with a short hydrophobic domain (residues 200-220), followed by four hydrophilic residues. A similar structure and hydropathicity profile is shared by membrane proteins bearing glycosyl phosphatidylinositol phospholipid (GPI-PL)-linked carboxy termini. Various groups (124, 127, 128) have provided evidence that the CD16 molecules are linked to the cell membrane through GPI-PL: (1) CD16 molecules are removed from the cell membrane and released into the supernatant when PMNs or CD16-transfected COS cells are treated with GPI-specific phospholipase C (GPI-PLC), and (2) PMNs from patients with paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH), an acquired abnormality affecting GPI tail biosynthesis or attachment, lack expression of CD16 FcR. However, the possibility remains that CD16 FcR in cell types other than PMNs (such as NK cells and macrophages) is at least in part a transmembrane molecule, as suggested by (1) heterogeneity in CD16 polypeptide molecular mass in different cell types, (2) normal expression of CD16 FcR on NK cells and cultured monocytes from PNH patients (127-129), and (3) an inability of GPI-PLC to remove CD16 FcR from human NK cells (124, 126). Both PMNs and NK cells spontaneously shed CD16 antigen in the absence of GPI-PLC treatment. After digestion with N-glycanase, the CD16 antigen shed from NK cells resolves in SDS gels in 23-28 kDa smaller fragments identical to those precipitated from both PMN supernatant and cells (126). Thus, the CD16 antigen on NK cells and PMNs might undergo spontaneous proteolytic cleavage at the same position, but, unlike in PMNs, the cleaved antigen from NK cells fails to remain on the membrane as a GPI-linked molecule and is released into the supernatant.",

Recently, two nearly identical, linked genes have been cloned for Fcy RIII (CD16). These genes are transcribed in a cell-type specific fashion to generate the alternatively anchored forms of this receptor (126) . The close analogy between CD16 FcR and the murine FcRIIa indicates that CD16 is expressed on a molecule that represents the human equivalent of murine FcRIIa. The functional relevance of the structural differences between CD16 FcR on NK cells and PMNs is indicated by the fact that NK cells, but not PMNs, are able to lyse anti-CD16 antibody-producing hybrid cells, indicating that CD16 antigen on NK cells functions as a signal-transducing structure in ADCC (125, 131) .

Incubation of NK cells with anti-CD16 antibodies or immune complexes determines a rapid disappearance of the CD16 antigen from the cell surface (132) . Treatment of N K cells with phorbol diesters also induces complete down-modulation of CD16 antigen expression in a few minutes (133) . When antLCD16 antibodies are cross-linked by a second anti-mouse Ig antibody on the NK cell surface, the CD16-antibody complex is internalized, as demonstrated by the disappearance of the antibody from the surface and by its release into the supernatant in the form of small proteolytic fragments (132, 134) . However, CD16 antigen is spontaneously released from NK cells and PMNs, and release of CD16 from PMNs is increased by activation with chemotactic peptides (127) . It is therefore possible that shedding of CD16 antigen plays some role in the downmodulation observed with antibodies and with phorbol diesters. In most healthy donors the CD16 antigen is expressed on an insignificant proportion of CD3+ T cells. However, the presence of approximately 5-10% CD3+, CD16+ T cells has been described in two of 50 donors tested (135) . These T cells express CD16 antigen at a much lower density than do CD3-, CD16+ NK cells.

The first antibody described, N901, was derived from mice immunized with cells from a chronic myeloid leukemia patient in blastic crisis (138). In addition to reacting with NK cells, antibody N901 recognizes an antigen expressed at high density on the immature myeloid cell line KGla and on the majority of cells from some patients with acute myeloid leukemia (138). N901 also reacts with neurons, neuroblastoma cell lines, and human teratocarcinoma cells, especially after induced differentiation to neural cells (139; P. Andrews, personal communication). The NKH-l/Leu-19 antigen has been shown recently to be expressing the neural adhesion protein N-CAM (L. Lanier, personal communication). Two other antibodies, NKH-1A (140) and anti-Leu-19 (141), were shown to react with NK cells with the same specificity as N901 and to precipitate a protein of 200 kDa. Binding competition among different antibodies with this specificity is not usually observed, suggesting the existence of several antigenic sites on the molecule. The NKH-l/Leu-19 antigen is expressed at very low density on peripheral blood NK cells, but its density increases significantly following in vitro stimulation and growth of NK cells (100). The subset of PBLs expressing the NKH-1/Leu-19 antigen (on average, 15% of lymphocytes and 90% of IGLs) almost completely overlaps with that expressing the CD16 antigen (141). The CD16-, NKH-l+ cells, representing 2-3% of PBLs, can be subdivided into two subsets based on expression of the CD3 antigens (141). CD3-, NKH-l+, CD16-cells are probably NK cells that do not express the CD16 antigens because of differentiation or activation state. CD3+, NKH-l+, mostly CD16-, cells represent a minor subset of T cells with low but significant non-MHC-restricted ability (141). Expansion in vitro of CD3+, NKH-l+ lymphocytes generates a high proportion of clones expressing the T cell receptor for antigen (TCR)-associated clonotype NKTa, which mediate non-MHCrestricted cytotoxicity by recognizing, via the TCR, the antigen TNK TAR detected by antibody 4F2 on proliferating target cells (142-144). NKH-lLeu-19 antigen is almost invariably expressed on clones with non-MHC-restricted specificity, both CD3-and CD3+ (20) . However, the presence of NKH-l/Leu-l9 antigen on some clones without cytotoxic activity excludes an association between the antigen and cytotoxicity (145).",

This IgM antibody precipitates a IlO-kDa antigen from PBLs and reacts with 30-70oJo of peripheral blood NK cells, with variability among donors (95, 96). Unlike the observation for CD16 and NKH-l/Leu-19 antigens, there is no correlation between the percentage of PBLs positive for HNK-I/Leu-7 antigen and NK cell cytotoxicity (95). The expression of HNK-l/Leu-7 is rapidly lost in vitro, and neither bulk cultures nor clones of NK cells express it (20, 100, 147) . Cord blood NK cells, which normally express CD16 antigen and have reduced but significant NK cell activity, do not express HNK-lL.eu-7 antigen (95, 148). In addition to its reactivity with some NK cells, HNK-1 reacts with a variable proportion of CD3+, CD8+ and sometimes HLA-DR+ T cells (149) and also with a rare population of CD4+ T cells that is expanded in various pathological conditions (150-152). These CD4+, HNK-I/Leu-7+ cells are present in physiological conditions in germinal centers of lymphoid tissue and are granular lymphocytes with a lower ability to produce IL-2 and B cell-stimulating factor than HNK-l/Leu-7-, CD4+ helper T cells (153, 154). A morphology of K L s or at least the presence of granules seems to characterize most HNK-l/Leu-7+ lymphocytes with both T and NK cell markers (149).",

However, transformation or maturation from one cell type to the other has never been demonstrated, and the presence of TCR gene rearrangement in CD3+, HNK-I+ but not in CD3-, HNK-l+ has definitively negated this hypothesis.

HNK-1 also reacts with neural cell adhesion molecules (169). However, the possibility that antibody HNK-1 recognizes on NK cells an adhesion molecule involved in target cell recognition seems quite unlikely, since HNK-1-NK cells are more cytotoxic than are HNK-l+ NK cells and expression of the antigen is rapidly lost on highly cytotoxic NK cell cultures and clones (20, 100 ). The reactivity of many different glycoproteins and cell types with HNK-1 antibody is explained by shared carbohydrate moieties (170, 171). The carbohydrate recognized by HNK-1 is present on both glycoproteins and glycolipids (170). The glycolipid recognized is an unusual glucuronic acid-containing sulfated glycosphingolipid with five sugars but without sialic acid (171).",

Interestingly, the TCRP gene in NK cells is more methylated than in T cells, but less methylated than in B cells and monocytes, suggesting at least a partial activation of the gene (206) . NK cells also express large amounts of truncated TCRG transcripts of different sizes, containing J and C regions, but no V region (194, 201) .

Alloantibodies different from anti-Lyt-2 and reacting specifically with NK cells were first described in anti-Ly-2 antisera generated by immunizing C3H mice with cells from the CE strain (207) . A more specific antiserum (C3H X BALB/c) F1 anti-CE, which lacks Ly-2 specificity, was prepared and used for the designation of a specific NK cell alloantigenic system, NK-1 (208) . A monoclonal anti-NK-1 antibody, clone PK136, was also obtained (209) . Sorting of spleen cells reactive or nonreactive with anti-NK-1 antibody from mouse strains expressing the NK-1.1 allele demonstrated that all the NK cytotoxic activity was present in the NK-1.1+ subset (210) . Anti-NK-1.1 antibody is specific for murine NK cells and reacts with a small population of spleen cells with granular lymphocyte morphology (210) . Repeated weekly treatment in Vivo of mice with anti-NK-1.1 antibody induces disappearance of mature NK cells, but not of NK cell precursors (211) . NK cell-specific antibodies detected in CE anti-CBA alloantisera have been originally designated anti-NK-1.2 and considered to be specific for an allele of NK-1.1 (212) . However, the existence of strains such as C57BL that react with both antibodies excluded the possibility that the two antigens were alleles (213) . The strain specificity of the CE anti-CBA alloantiserum is similar, but not identical, to that of the NZB anti-BALB/c (anti-NK-2.1) sera (214) . The two alloantisera are now considered to be directed against the same alloantigen, NK-2.1 (213) . A third antigen, NK-3.1, which segregates independently of NK-1.1 and NK-2.1, was detected in several strains by a C3H anti-ST alloantiserum (215). When tested in the presence of complement against the appropriate strains of mice, these three antisera completely abolish the NK cell activity against YAC-1 and some other target cells. However, when other target cells, such as K562, were tested, the cytotoxic activity in C57BL spleens was eliminated by anti-NK-2.1 but not by anti-NK-1.1. Further, when RBL-5 and other target cells were used, neither antiserum affected NK cell activity. These results suggest a heterogeneity in the expression of the NK-1 and NK-2 antigens in murine NK cells (216).",

Flow-cytometric studies have shown that asialo-GM1 is expressed on both NK cells and CTLs, but that NK cells are more sensitive than CTLs to treatment with anti-asialo-GM1 and complement (220). Asialo-GM1 is also present on activated and tumoricidal macrophages (221). However, even with these limitations of specificity, the anti-asialo-GMl reagents were an extremely useful tool for dissecting the role of NK cells in Vivo and in vitro before monoclonal antibodies to more specific antigens became available (219, 220, 222). Also, on the basis of asialo-GM1 expression, a possible heterogeneity of murine NK cells was detected, i.e., whereas all NK cells cytotoxic for YAC-1 cells are asialo-GM1 positive, those lysing herpes simplex virus (HSV)-1infected fibroblasts include both asialo-GM1 -positive and -negative subsets (223). The reduced specificity of the anti-asialo-GM1 antisera might rest in their reactivity with other gangliosides, such as asialo-GMz and asialo-GMS (224). Monoclonal antibodies have been produced that are more specific for asialo-GM1 than the antisera and can completely deplete NK cell activity: These monoclonal antibodies have a lower reactivity to T cells than the polyclonal antisera and could be more specific reagents for murine and rat NK cells (224, 225).",

Analysis of the rearrangement of X R genes in these clones has definitively confirmed that most or all of these cell lines present functional rearrangements in the TCR genes, demonstrating that they are T cell clones with non-MHC-restricted cytotoxic ability (242, 243). The isolation of these T cell clones expressing NK cell markers may be due to the selective growth of the small subset of T cells expressing NK-1 and NK-2 antigens. The expression of these antigens is similar to that of the human NKH-l/Leu-19 antigen, which is usually found to be associated with T cell clones with non-MHC-restricted cytotoxicity. All studies performed on freshly isolated murine NK cells or on their shortterm bulk cultures have confirmed that in mice, as in humans, NK cells neither functionally express nor rearrange any of the four TCR genes (234, 244, 245).

Thus, murine NK cells, like human NK cells, express only one type of FcyR. FcyRII-a is highly homologous to the CD16 FcR expressed on human NK cells (124) .

NC cells are not active against NK-sensitive target cells such as YAC-1, but preferentially lyse another set of target cells, of which WEHI-164 is the prototype (251, 252) . NC cells are present in animals lacking NK cells, such as neonatal or beige mice, and were reported originally not to express markers typically expressed on NK cells, such as NK-1, NK-2, Qa-5, or Thy-1 (252) (253) (254) (255) . However, these early studies were performed using negative selection with complement and were therefore unable to distinguish the contribution of distinct subsets of NC cells. Positive and negative selection experiments by fluorescence-activated cell sorter have shown that NC activity can be mediated by a variety of phenotypically distinct NC cell subsets, including Thy-l+ and Qa-5+ cells (256) . WEHI-164 is a very sensitive target for tumor necrosis factor (TNF), and the cytotoxic activity of NC cells has been shown to be mediated by TNF (257, 258) . Thus, NC cells are a heterogenous group of cells able to produce TNF and therefore may include macrophages; T, B, and NK lymphocytes; and basophils (78, [258] [259] [260] .",

In transmission electron microscopy human LGLs appear as medium-sized lymphocytes with round or indented nuclei, condensed chromatin, and unusually prominent nucleoli (275-278) (Fig. 5) . The cytoplasm is abundant and contains a variety of organelles. A well-developed Golgi apparatus with many smooth and coated vesicles is usually found in the nuclear notch. Prominent centrioles and associated microtubules are also detected in this area. The cytoplasm contains abundant mitochondria and a number of lysosomal organelles. Common among these are membrane-bound granules containing a homogeneous electron-dense matrix, but other structures, such as smooth vesicles, coated vesicles, and multivesicular bodies, are also normally present (275-278). The granules present typical internum and externum. In resting mature NK cells granules range in size from 50 to 800 nm in diameter, display a circular to elongated profile, and contain an electron-dense core (internum) surrounded by a layer of less opacity (extemum) (275, 276, 279, 280). The matrix of the granules is usually separated from the limiting trilaminar membrane by an electron-lucent space, within which electron-dense spikes can sometimes be seen radiating from the matrix to the membrane. The electron-dense core matrix is usually amorphous, except in cases in which a paracrystalline structure can be identified (279, 280). Various organelles which are probably a modification of the same granules are, however, observed in NK cells and have been attributed either to differentiation stages of the granules, similar to observations in granules of basophils, or to activation of the NK cells during lymphokine treatment or cytotoxic activity (275, 279, 281). Vesicles are observed, usually still containing a residual electron-dense matrix surrounded by small vesicles, to form multivesicular bodies, membrane myelin figures, and tubular structures. NK cells also contain numerous electron-lucent pinocytic vesicles and large vacuoles. The contents of the vacuoles are very heterogeneous, containing electron-dense particulate material and cellular debris. The endocytic nature of these structures was confirmed by the demonstration of Percoll beads in the vacuoles of LGLs incubated for 1-2 hours at 37OC in the presence of high concentrations of Percoll(276). Although NK cells and LGLs were originally described as nonphagocytic, being unable to phagocytize latex beads, opsonized RBCs, or immune complexes (275, 278, 282) , several studies have demonstrated at least a limited ability of these cells to phagocytize 2-aminoethylisothiouronium bromide hydrobromide (AET)-treated SRBCs, opsonized Staphylococcus aureus, and complement-coated bacteria (277, 280, 283, 284).",

The FTAs are quite variable in overall size, with some as large as 1.3 pm in diameter or 1.7 p in length. Lymphocytes contain large PTAs, small PTAs, or both. All of the PTAs contain a tubular substructure formed by tubules packed in wall-to-wall contact and usually located in the notch region of the nucleus in close association with the centriole and the Golgi apparatus (276-278, 280, 287-290). Some of the FTAs are surrounded by a membrane, but, most often, distinct membranes are difficult to identify. Inclusions containing only tubules were termed type A PTAs, whereas other inclusions containing tubules and homogeneous electrondense material were termed type B FTAs (287). Comparison of the diameters of the tubules in different reports reveals extreme heterogeneity, with measurements ranging from 13 to 44 nm. However, most papers report a diameter of either -16 nm (276, 277, 287, 289) or -40 nm reported the presence of crystalline lattice or gratings in a proportion of granules from NK clones and peripheral blood LGLs, respectively. In stained sections crystalline structures were seen in about 10% of the densest granules, but in unstained sections all of the densest granules contained these structures (279). The lattices were composed of hexagonally packed points, each point equidistant from six other points. The gratings consisted of a set of parallel lines, usually straight, but occasionally in a whorled fingerprint pattern. The grating pattern also appeared to be superimposed on the lattice pattern, with the sets of parallel lines running in three directions that were at 120\u00b0 with respect to one another. Lattice and gratings have been demonstrated to be simply different views of the same structures (279). The lattice spacings average 6.9 f 0.3 nm, with a thickness of the electron-dense lines or points ranging from 2.5 to 3.6 nm. In addition to hexagonally packed lattices, cubic lattices were seen occasionally (279). In some granules the lattice appears smaller, with a looser packing, a microtubular appearance, and a diameter of 17 nm, similar to the PTA microtubules described by other authors. Frequently, the gratings or lattice unraveled and formed tubules and trilaminar strands of unit membrane that extended from the core of the granules (279). These laminar membranes, myelin figures, vesicles, and multivesicular bodies, in the presence or absence of residual crystalline dense material, are more frequently seen in activated NK cells (281) or in discharged granules during cytotoxic activity (279). These results strongly suggest that granules with PTAs, membranes, or lattices in NK cells may be in fact structural variants of a single granule type (279). The crystalline lattices most probably are formed by the phospholipids that give rise to the membranes and vesicles. Phospholipids in model lipid-water systems form either lamellar or nonbilayer arrangements (292). The phospholipids in nonbilayer arrangements form long rods, with the head groups and water in the center and acyl chains radiating outward, and the rods are then ordered in hexagonal or cubic arrays (Hex I1 phases), with center-to-center spacing of 4.5-7.0 nm (292). Alternatively, the rods may have the head groups on the outside (Hex I phase): In thin sections, this phase appears as an electron-dense honeycomb (279, 292), with a center-to-center distance of 16-17 nm, similar to the structure observed in some cases of PTA.",

However, the use of monoclonal antibodies, such as anti-CD16 and NKH-1, has shown that these cells represent a much larger proportion of total PBLs. CD16+ lymphocytes represent, on average, 15% of PBLs, with large variability among donors (ranging from 2 to 50%) (95, 114, 117, 118). The large majority of CD16+ PBLs have LGL morphology and lack B or T cell markers (95, 114). More than 60% of CD16+ PBLs freshly separated and more than 80% of IFN-treated CD16+ PBLs bind to K562 cells (95) and the majority of these cells are cytotoxic in a singlecell assay in agarose (305).

NK cells are not present in recirculating thoracic duct lymphocytes, but treatment with IFN in wivo may induce the appearance of a small number of NK cells in the thoracic duct (309). In bone marrow, the number of CD16+ lymphoid cells is very low, -1% of the mononuclear cells, and the cytotoxic activity is also very low (95, 308, 310). CD2+ lymphocytes sorted from bone marrow have an enriched NK activity, whereas FcyR+ cells are inactive, perhaps suggesting the presence of immature CD16+ NK cells in the bone marrow (310). The low activity of NK cells in the bone marrow might also rest in the presence of NK cell-sensitive target cells in the bone marrow that determine a functional inactivation of the NK cells (76).

The contribution of Leu-7+ LGLs to cytotoxicity from tonsil cells is, however, not clear, and macrophages might account for some of the observed cytotoxicity (312).

The adoptively transferred LGLs did not appear in the thoracic lymph. While NK cells do not appear to recirculate, levels of NK cell activity can be dramatically altered in various organ sites following administration of immunostimulants (327, 336). The mechanisms responsible for these alterations could be increased activity or proliferation of preexisting NK cells, localization of blood-borne NK cells or NK cell precursors, or redistribution of mature NK cells from one site to another. In the case of increased NK cell activity and numbers in the liver following MVE-2 or C . parvum treatment, it was shown that the accumulation of LGLs in the liver is not affected by splenectomy, but is prevented by 89Sr-induced destruction of the bone marrow environment, suggesting that the accumulation is due to migration in the liver of NK cells recently derived from bone marrow progenitors (336).",

At no time was cytotoxic activity mediated by fetal thymus cells (337). In peripheral blood, no activity was observed in 20-week fetuses, even after boosting with IFN-7 (338). However, induction of cytotoxic cells was observed with IL-2 treatment (338). In premature infants at 27 weeks of gestation, NK cell activity was constitutive in peripheral blood and was augmented by IFN-7 or IL-2 treatment (338). At birth, cord blood lymphocytes usually have normal ADCC activity, but NK cell activity against K562 target cells ranges from severely depressed to normal (95, 339-341). However, cytotoxic activity mediated by cord blood lymphocytes against another NK cell-sensitive target cell line, MOLT-4, was found to be comparable to that of adult PBLs (340). In cord blood, about 19% of the lymphocytes are CD16+, similar to the proportion observed in adult PBLs (95). However, the HNK-l/Leu-7 antigen was not expressed on CD16+ cord blood lymphocytes (95, 342). The number of LGLs in cord blood is also comparable to that of adult peripheral blood (341); therefore, NK cells are present in normal number in cord blood and their low cytotoxic efficiency may depend on immaturity (339) or the presence of suppressor cells (341). In the miniature swine, as in humans, at birth lymphocytes mediate ADCC but not NK cell cytotoxicity (267). If the piglets are hysterectomy derived and maintained germ free, NK cell activity appears only after 4 weeks of age, whereas piglets maintained in the standard specific pathogen-free animal colony develop NK cell activity at 2-3 weeks, suggesting that stimulation by the microbial flora and environment plays some role in the maturation of NK cells (343). In humans the proportion of CD16+ cells in PBLs remains relatively constant after birth, whereas the number of Leu-7+ cells increases almost linearly with age (148). A modest increase in NK cell cytotoxicity was observed in individuals more than 80 years old (344-349). The Leu-7-CD16+ subset, with the highest cytotoxic activity was not increased in these subjects, whereas a significant increase was observed in the Leu-7 + CD16 + NK cell and Leu-7+ CD16-T cell subsets (345-347, 349, 350). This increase in NK cell activity in older individuals may reflect a normal maturation of the NK cell system, or a preferential survival of subjects with elevated NK cell activity. In the age group between 20 and 60 years, male donors have a higher proportion of both CD16+ lymphocytes and NK cell activity than do female donors (56, 95, 344, 345, 351).",

Such genetic complementation between the low-activity NK cell pairs indicates that the low-activity NK cell phenotype in the various strains have different genetic bases. In the SJL strain, three different non-MHC-linked genes were found to account for the poor responsiveness of NK cells to IFN (376).",

Two of these patients, one male and one female, belong to a group of four siblings with recurrent viral infections (375). All four siblings developed infectious mononucleosis (IM) as young adults. A boy who had respiratory infections and progressive bronchiectasis since the age of 7 died at the age of 16 of complications of IM. All immunological parameters tested were normal, but NK cell activity was not tested. A sister and a brother also had recurrent viral infections and pneumonia and the sister had progressive bronchiectasis starting at age 7-10, before any evidence of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection, as shown by the absence of anti-EBV antibody before developing IM. Both patients lacked NK cell activity against both K562 cells and HSV-1-infected target cells (375). No NK cells could be detected in peripheral blood of the sister 4 and 9 years after IM, using various monoclonal antibodies, including anti-NKH 1/Leu-19 and anti-CD16. All other immunological parameters tested were normal. A fourth brother developed IM at 21 years of age, but he was otherwise healthy. He had a somewhat reduced level of NK cell activity, which was augmented by in Vitro treatment with IFN (375). Both parents were healthy and had normal NK cell activity (375). Biron et al. (377) have described another young female with severe viral infections, including varicella and cytomegalovirus, and complete absence of both NK cell activity and NKH-l/Leu-19+ and CD16+ lymphocytes. In all of these patients CD16 and CDllb antigens were normally expressed on neutrophils and on monocyte/macrophages. NK cell activity is also deficient in patients with defective expression of the CD11/CD18 group of surface receptors (378); however, in these patients the clinical pathology is dominated by the defect in phagocytic cells and severe bacterial infections, and it is difficult to evaluate the role of the NK cell defect in the pathogenesis of the disease.",

Granules of the neutrophils are abnormally large, and clinical manifestations of the disease include defective pigmentation and increased susceptibility to infection (381). Humoral immunity and delayed-type hypersensitivity are normal, but children usually die of pyogenic infection, presumably resulting from their neutrophil abnormality. Survivors generally succumb to an LPD that may be malignant (382). NK cell activity in CHS patients is ten to 100 times lower than in normal controls (383-386): The number of NK cells is normal, as judged by the number of target binding cells and of cells positive with anti-NK monoclonal antibodies, but the number of cytotoxic cells is decreased, and the kinetics of lysis is slower than in normal NK cells (387-389). IFN increases the activity of CHS patients' NK cells (383, 387, 388). The NK cells in CHS patients characteristically contain a single, large granule in the cytoplasm (390): The decreased cytotoxic activity of these cells is probably due to a defect of the ability to secrete factors involved in cytotoxicity. Other lymphocyte-mediated functions in CHS patients appear to be normal, but the lysosomal defects can also be observed in granular Leu-7+ T ",

The most commonly studied gene is Bg, which determines beige coat color (392). Mice carrying the Bg gene have been regarded as animal models for CHS. Homozygosity at the B g gene determines defects in lysosomal membrane functions, resulting in granulocytes with giant lysosomes and abnormal functions and in altered melanosomal functions, leading to beige coat color (392). Beige mice have strongly depressed NK cell activity; the NK cell defect is post-target cell recognition and is only partially reversed by IFN (393, 394). Other B and T lymphocyte functions are almost normal. Beige mice have also been widely used as experimental models to analyze the role of NK cells in Vivo. Of other color mutations in the mouse, leaden, fuzzy, and pale ears have no effect on NK cell activity, whereas satin (Sa) is also suppressive (395). When Sa and Bg are present in the same animal, their suppressive effect on NK cells is synergistic, but allospecific CTLs are also affected (395).",

Normal NK cell activity is also observed in patients with DiGeorge's syndrome, showing that functional thymus is not required for NK cell differentiation (398,401,406). The thymic independence of NK cells is also supported by the fact that athymic nude mice and rats have stronger NK cell activity than do their euthymic littermates (360, 407). About half of the patients with Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome have normal NK cell activity against K562 target cells, but all of these patients have severely depressed NK cell activity against virus-infected target cells, despite normal IFN-a titers (405) . Some patients with SCID show a depressed NK cell activity and some display normal or augmented activity (95, 399, 404, 405, [408] [409] [410] [411] . In SCID patients with elevated NK cell activity, most circulating lymphocytes have the characteristics of Cllb+ LGLs (409-411). These LGLs are probably in an activated state, as suggested by the presence of activation antigens and the resistance of their cytotoxic ability to functional inactivation by in vivo irradiation (409-411). Some of the interesting findings in SCID patients are the dissociation among NK cell activity against K562 cells, cytotoxicity against virus-infected cells, and ability to produce IFN (405) .",

Since the first description of LGL lymphocytosis 10 years ago (419, 420) , the number of reported cases of this disease, initially considered very rare, has increased and a large number of patients have now been described. In most cases of LGL lymphocytosis the phenotype of LGLs is rather homogeneous and these cells express CD3 and CD8 antigens. CD2 is expressed in cells from most patients, but the CD5 antigen present on all normal T cells and some B cells is usually absent or expressed at very low density on the LGLs. All cases of LGL lymphocytosis that express the CD3 antigen have rearranged TCR genes and express either TCRaP or TCRy6, indicating the T cell origin of these cells (421) (422) (423) (424) (425) (426) (427) (428) . The heterogeneity of the LGLs in the patients, the frequent spontaneous remission observed, as well as the chronic and relatively benign course of the disease have led to the hypothesis that LGL lymphocytosis is not a malignancy, but a reactive process (429, 430) . Although reactive LGL lymphocytosis can probably occur, for example, in B cell chronic lymphatic leukemia or EBV infections, cells in all tested patients with CD3+, CD8+ LGL lymphocytosis have unique rearrangements of the TCR genes, demonstrating the monoclonality of the disease (421) (422) (423) (424) (425) (426) (427) (428) (429) .",

            "text": "LGLs usually mediate efficient ADCC but low spontaneous cytotoxicity, if any (103). Surface antigens preferentially expressed on NK cells, such as CDllb, HNK-l/Leu-7, and NKH-l/Leu-19, are expressed on the cells from some patients. Cells from almost all patients express FcyR, as shown by rosette formation with IgG-sensitized RBCs or binding of immune complexes, and the FcyR is usually functionally active in mediating ADCC. Relatively few studies have tested anti-CD16 FcR antibodies, but among these, some (431, 432) reported reactivity of cells from most patients with anti-CD16 antibodies such as B73.1 or Leu-11, whereas in another study (433) cells from only a few patients reacted with antibody B73.1; instead, a more consistent reactivity was observed with AB8.28, an antibody reacting with a surface molecule different from CD16 antigen, but perhaps functionally related to the FcyR on NK cells and neutrophils (120). In another study, anti-Leu-11 antibodies were negative, but consistent reactivity was observed with the anti-CD16 CLB FcR-gran 1 antibody (434) . The same phenotype (CLB FcR-gran 1+, Leu-11-) was previously reported for CD3+ clones with ADCC activity derived from healthy individuals (136) . Unlike other anti-CD16 antibodies, the CLB FcR-gran 1 antibody reacts at low intensity with a proportion of T cells in peripheral blood, in addition to NK cells (G. Trinchieri, unpublished observations). Different types of FcyR (e.g., CD16 and CDw32) are highly homologous in their extracellular portions (124) . In the mouse, antibody 2.4G2 reacts with both the product of FcRII-a, expressed on NK cells and macrophages, and the product of FcRII-0, expressed on B and T cells and macrophages (130, 250) . It is possible that some of the anti-CD16 antibodies have similar specificity in humans. Thus, although CD3+ cells from some patients probably express CD16 FcyR, in other patients a different type of FcyR might be used in mediating ADCC. The CD3+ CD16+ phenotype expressed by some patients might be an aberrant antigenic expression (lineage infidelity) by the malignant cells, as observed in many cases of leukemias from various cell lineages. Alternatively, monoclonal LGLs could originate from the T cell subset characterized by high CD3 and low CD16 antigen expression, and constituting a measurable subset in about 4% of healthy donors (135) . The spontaneous cytotoxicity of CD3+ LGLs is usually low and can be augmented by treatment with IL-2 or anti-CD3 antibodies (432, 434) . The rare cases of LGL lymphocytosis with TCRy6 have spontaneous cytotoxic activity that is blocked by anti-CD3 antibodies, analogous to observations of T C R y P clones with non-MHC-restricted cytotoxic activity (203, 205) . Thus the T C R y P cells, unlike TCRaP+ cells, might use their TCR for non-MHC-restricted cytotoxicity in this form of LGL lymphocytosis (434) .",

Moreover, bone marrow reconstitution of radiation chimeras produced between pairs of histocompatible high and low NK cell-reactive mouse strains resulted in restoration of NK cell activity in the spleen. The chimeras were high or low NK cell reactive, depending on the bone marrow donor strain, and were independent of host environment (445). Similar experiments have been performed using the beige mouse strain presenting defective NK cell activity (446, 447). Radiation chimeras were used to demonstrate that NK cell activity was determined by the phenotype of the marrow donor and not by the genotype of the irradiated recipient (448), confirming that the generation of NK cells is an inborn and autonomous function of the bone marrow.",

These data suggest that murine mature NK cells are relatively radioresistant, renewable cells with a life span of up to 2 weeks and that their direct progenitors are radiosensitive. Leukemogenic split-dose irradiation determines a more persistent depression of NK cell activity (453, 457). Similarly, in most irradiated patients depression of NK cell activity is observed, with subsequent recovery after 3-4 months (450).

Total NK cell activity of murine femoral marrow was unchanged for 10.5 hours after the first HU injection, indicative of the transition time for the DNA-synthesizing NK cell precursor to become an active NK cell. This was followed by an exponential decline with a half-time of 7.9 hours, reflecting the rapid exponential renewal of NK cells in the marrow. In the spleen total NK cell activity was unchanged for 20.5 hours, indicating the transit time from the last DNA synthesis of the precursor cells in the bone marrow to the appearance of the functional NK cells in the spleen, and then declined exponentially, with a half-time of 24.15 hours, suggesting a half-life of NK cells in the spleen of, on average, 1 day (455). These results have been extended by Pollack and Rosse (458), using [SH]thymidine pulsechase techniques in vivo. In these experiments, NK cells were identified by their ability to bind YAC-1 cells, after elimination of B cells. Two NK cell populations could be distinguished in the bone marrow: large proliferating target-binding cells (TBCs) (25% in S phase) and small postmitotic TBCs, probably derived from the large TBCs which, in turn, were derived from a more rapidly proliferating precursor population. Migration of labeled NK cells from the bone marrow to the spleen required at least 2 days: some of these cells in the spleen survived 2 months or longer, and little or no proliferation of NK cells occurred in the periphery of unstimulated mice (458).",

The pretransplant irradiation therapy does not immediately abrogate NK cell activity in the patients, but the ability of their cells to maintain cytotoxic activity against K562 cells or to generate activity against tumor cells during culture in the presence of IL-2 is completely suppressed, suggesting a complete block in the proliferative ability of both NK cells and their precursors (462). After transplantation NK cells and LGLs appear, in both humans (463) and experimental animals (464), already at 1 week, and their number and activity increase to a peak at 30-50 days, slightly declining thereafter to normal or slightly subnormal levels (461,463). The appearance of NK cells precedes that of any other lymphocyte type, and at 20-30 days NK cells may represent 50-90% of all peripheral lymphocytes (465). The appearance of cytotoxic NK cells parallels that of IL-2-inducible cytotoxic cells: Both precursor and effector LAK cells in the patients are CD3-cells with an NK phenotype (462). The spontaneously cytotoxic NK cells in the recipient are activated, as suggested by their lymphoblastic appearance and by their ability to lyse efficiently not only K562 cells but also Daudi cells, tumor cells, and fresh leukemia cells (462, 464, 466). The CD3-NK cells obtained from transplanted leukemia patients and able to lyse leukemia cells have been cloned and shown by chromosomal analysis to derive from the donor bone marrow (466). Graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) in some cases has been associated with an accelerated appearance of cytotoxic NK cells following transplantation (467). The level of NK cell activity posttransplantion correlates inversely with the probability of CMV active infection (468). The establishment of active CMV infection has been shown to be followed by either a decrease (467) or an increase (463) in NK cell activity. These data confirm that NK cell precursors are contained in bone marrow and can rapidly proliferate and reconstitute the organisms.",

The bone marrow precursor cells were found to be NK-2.1-, asialo-GM,-, Thy-1.2-, Qa-5-, Qa-2+, and H-2+ (473). Differentiation of the NK precursor cells in mvo requires an intact marrow microenvironment, because 170-estradiol-treated mice fail to sustain NK cell differentiation (473). Bone marrow cells from W/Wv anemic mice and marrow from scid mice contain a normal frequency of NK cell precursors, indicating that the NK precursor cells are distinct from those of myeloid cells and of T and B lymphocytes, respectively (412, 473) . In a similar system, i.e., transplantation of NK precursor cells in aged syngeneic mice with low splenic NK cell activity, if any, Miller (474) demonstrated that spleen cells but not fetal thymocytes, rich in prethymocytes, contain NK precursor cells. Thus, fetal thymic pre-T cells neither demonstrate nor develop NK cell activity. IL-1, IL-2, and IFNa / p accelerate the reconstitution of irradiated mice by NK precursor cells (475) (476) (477) . However, IFN at 14 days after transplantation induces a significant suppression of NK cell activity due to the induction of suppressor cells (476) . Treatment of recipient animals with IL-3 determined a reduced appearance of NK cell activity and cells with NK cell phenotypic markers (477) .",

Any system that analyzes in vitro differentiation of NK cells should clearly distinguish between the differentiation of NK cell precursors and the induced proliferation of mature resting NK cells.

Using alloantisera against NK-1.1 antigen, Koo et al. (478, 479) identified NK-l.1-and NK-1.1+ NK cell precursors devoid of cytotoxic activity, but their observation was weakened by the reactivity of the alloantisera with a large proportion of immature hematopoietic cells. The availability of better reagents, including monoclonal antibodies against NK-1.1 (209) , and of purified or recombinant lymphokines now allows a more detailed analysis of NK cell differentiation in uilro. IL-2 or IL-2-containing conditioned medium allows the generation of cytotoxic NK cells from murine bone marrow cultures depleted of mature NK cells by treatment with antibodies or with 5-fluorouracil, which is selectively toxic for differentiated cells (480) (481) (482) (483) . The cytotoxic cells generated in these culture systems have, at least in part, the phenotype of mature NK cells, including expression of asialo-GM1 and, often, Thy-1 and NK-1.1 (481) (482) (483) . The precursor cells are asialo-GM1-but usually Thy-l+ (482, 483) . The NK precursor cells detected in these in uilro systems might therefore be more mature than the NK progenitor cells detected by adoptive transfer in uivo, which are asialo-GMl-, Thy-1-. In the absence of IL-2, differentiation of NK cells from bone marrow cells was not induced by IL-1, IL-3, or IFN-a/P (481). However, IFN and IL-1 (or hemopoietin 1) are able to synergize with IL-2 in inducing differentiation (483) (484) (485) (486) . A similar effect was observed with TNF and lymphotoxin (486) . On the contrary, IL-3 (487), transforming growth factor-P (TGF-P), IL-4 and granulocytemacrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) (486) significantly inhibit NK cell differentiation.

All of the cytotoxic cells are NKH-l/Leu-19+ (496-498) and granular, as shown by staining with the lysosomotropic vital dye quinacrine (498). Although one of the original studies reported the presence of FcyR on the effector cells (494), the presence of CD16 antigens has never been detected in the thymocyte cultures (498). The majority of NKH-l/Leu-19+ cells in cultured thymocytes are also CD3+, but a significant proportion of NKH-l/Leu-19+, CD3-cytotoxic cells is always present (496, 498). Because both CD3+ and CD3-thymus-derived, non-MHC-restricted cytotoxic cells do not express CD16, and because NKH-1 and CD3 are often coexpressed in non-MHC-restricted T cell clones, it is difficult to identify whether the CD3-cells are T or NK cells. Because the thymus has been shown not to contain NK cell progenitors in adoptive transfer experiments, the possibility should be considered that the CD3-cells represent expansion/activation of T cells at an immature stage of development, before functional expression of the TCR on these cells.",

NK cells are short-lived in the peripheral blood and in spleen, but it is as yet unknown how long tissue-associated NK cells persist. The most striking characteristic of NK cells is that resting circulating NK cells, present at all times in all healthy individuals, are \"natural\" functionally active cells, i.e., they can be triggered to lyse a target cell within minutes when confronted with the appropriate target structure or with an antibodycoated target cell. Other NK cell functions, such as lymphokine production and the regulation of hematopoietic and adaptive immune cells, are also mediated by resting NK cells. This ability of NK cells to respond to a triggering stimulus without the need for preactivation enables them to participate in the first line of defense against various pathogens. In this respect NK cells resemble other effector cell types of nonadaptive immunity such as granulocytes and monocyte/macrophages. Moreover, the functional activity of NK cells, like that of other nonadaptive effector cells, is rapidly enhanced by cytokines such as IFN and IL-2. This modulation of NK cell functional activity does not require cell division. In mvo, however, conditions such as virus infection or a strong antigenic stimulus induce both the activation of NK cells and an increase in NK cell number, due to increased proliferation, probably mostly at the bone marrow level. This in mvo response is maximal at 3-4 days, before adaptive immune responses become effective, and is reminiscent of the myelopoietic reaction to bacterial infection. Unlike myelomonocytic cells, differentiated resting NK cells and also resting T and B lymphocytes can be rapidly induced into the cell cycle and maintained in mlro in a proliferative state, for 30 or more cell divisions in a 2-to 3-month period. The in mvo proliferative response of NK cells is likely to be contributed by both the centralized proliferation of NK progenitor cells in the bone marrow and the induction of circulating NK cells into the cell cycle.",

Signal transduction involves enhanced phosphoinositide turnover and increase of [CaZ+]i, due to release of Ca2+ from intracellular stores and influx of extracellular Ca2+, observed upon interaction of NK cells with NK cell-sensitive target cells. Similar signal transduction mechanisms are activated during interaction of CD16 FcR with ligands, i.e., with anti-CD16 antibodies, immune complexes, or IgG-coated target cells. Three types of response are observed: (A) activation of the cytotoxic mechanism, with morphological alteration and secretion of the content of granules, including cytotoxic molecules such as poreforming proteins, NKCF, and others; (B) transcription of lymphokine and cell surface receptor genes and expression of their products, with a synergistic induction mediated by IL-2; (C) proliferation of NK cells, mostly induced by IL-2 interaction with the highaffinity IL-2 receptor (IL-2R) [p75 (@) and p55 (a) chain dimer] or with the p75 chain (@) of the IL-2 receptor, but modulated by the regulatory effect of NK-target cell or FcR (CD16)-ligand interactions on the expression of the IL-2 receptor [p55 chain (a) or CD25 antigen] gene.

            "text": "The prototype target cell lines used in each species, the K562 cell line for human NK cells and the YAC-1 cell line for mouse and rat NK cells, are among the most sensitive cell lines in each system. However, almost any cell is sensitive to a certain extent to NK cells, if the concentration of effector cells is sufficiently high or if the NK cells are activated by IFN or IL-2. When evaluating the sensitivity of target cells to lysis, it should be considered that several different factors play a role in determining cell lysis. The ability of a cell line to bind to NK cells is necessary but not sufficient to render it sensitive to lysis (502). In order to activate the cytotoxic mechanism in the NK cells, a structure on the target cells, possibly distinct from the one responsible for cell binding, must trigger the effector cells (503, 504). This second requirement can be circumvented if the target cells present molecules that can interact directly with functional receptors on the NK cell surface, such as: (1) IgG antibodies, binding to CD16 (ADCC); (2) C3, presumably binding to CDllb (C3bi receptor) (505, 506); (3) antibodies to CD16 or CD2 antigens on NK cells and binding with the Fc fragment to the FcR on target cells (reverse ADCC) (507); and (4) heterocross-linked antibodies that recognize an NK cell receptor (e.g., CD16) and an antigen on the target cells (508, 509). When target cells are bound to NK cells and the lytic mechanism is activated, lysis of the target cells still depends on the intrinsic sensitivity of the target cells to the lytic mechanism. Certain types of target cells may activate the cytotoxic ability of NK cells and therefore might appear to be very sensitive to NK cells. For example, NK cell activation is observed with target cells infected with viruses or mycoplasmas (79-82), but may require the participation of accessory cells and IFN (510), and is characterized by an increase of the rate of lysis during the cytotoxic assay (see Fig. 3 ).",

Glycoproteins isolated from the target cell membrane and inserted into artificial membranes were able to inhibit conjugate formation between human or rat NK cells with their target cells in a species-specific manner (500). However, cytotoxicity was not inhibited in these experiments (500), raising the possibility that lytic factors acting at short range but not requiring cell contact might play a role in NK cell-mediated cytotoxicity. The species specificity of the inhibition suggests that the species specificity of the NK cell cytotoxicity is at the level of NK-target cell conjugate formation. If liposomes containing membrane components from sensitive target cells are fused with resistant target cells, the resistant target cells become sensitive to NK cell-mediated lysis (501). In this experimental system (501) NK cells did not bind to or lyse heterologous target cells even when fused with liposomes containing membrane components from homologous, sensitive target cells. Moreover, liposomes containing membrane components from heterologous NK cell-sensitive target cells could not confer NK cell sensitivity to homologous NK cell-resistant target cells. These results suggest that species restriction might be at both the recognition (binding) and triggering levels.",

            "text": "Although NK cell lysis is often defined as specific for tumor and virusinfected targets, these cytotoxic cells can also lyse normal cells, and often it is difficult to demonstrate lysis of malignant cells. In most cases, virusinfected cells are no more sensitive than uninfected cells but are lysed through mechanisms that involve activation of NK cells (79, 511-513). Lysis of freshly obtained tumor target cells can be demonstrated using both autologous and allogeneic NK cells, but often procedures such as enrichment or stimulation with IFN or IL-2 must be used before significant killing is observed (514-517). In some cases tumor cells freshly obtained from the patients are insensitive to NK cell-mediated lysis; however, brief (24-hour) incubation in vitro in the case of acute myeloid leukemia blasts (518) or treatment with anti-Ig antibodies in the case of B cell chronic leukemia cells (519) render these cells sensitive to NK cell lysis. YAC-1 cells, when grown in vivo and directly obtained from the animals, are also resistant to lysis unless cultured for a few days (520). In this case the NK cell sensitivity increases during in vitro culture concomitant with a decrease of H-2 antigen expression, suggesting that an effect of IFN in vivo, as discussed below, might be responsible for NK cell resistance (521) . Experiments using IL-2-activated NK cells against autologous endometrial carcinoma cells and normal endometrial epithelium cells have shown that the carcinoma cells were lysed more efficiently than were the normal cells, suggesting that activated NK cells might, at least for this type of tumor, selectively lyse the malignant cells (522) . In several studies, transfection with the rus oncogenes has been shown to render cells sensitive to NK cell lysis (523) (524) (525) , although the lack of correlation of sensitivity to lysis with transformation (525) makes it difficult to conclude from these observations that NK cell sensitivity arises during the early stages of cellular transformation. However, Nabi et ul. (526) showed that suppression of some characteristics of transformed cells, such as lack of contact inhibition, renders human malignant target cells resistant to NK cell lysis.",

Kiessling and Wigzell (529) proposed that the function of NK cells was the surveillance of primitive cells, since embryonic thymus and bone marrow contain NK-sensitive cells (36), NK cells lyse undifferentiated but not differentiated embryonic carcinoma cells (530), and induction of differentiation of the K562 (531, 532) and U937 (529) cell lines reduces their sensitivity to NK cells. Evidence against this theory comes from the observation that NK-deficient beige mice are no more susceptible than are normal mice to the growth of experimental embryo-induced teratoma and teratocarcinoma (533). Also, phorbol diester treatment of K562 cells, which was originally shown to induce differentiation and decrease sensitivity to NK cell lysis (531, 532), was subsequently reported to increase sensitivity (534) or to have opposite effects on different subclones of K562 (535). Phorbol diesters induce NK cell sensitivity in many cell lines (534, 536), possibly by inducing a decrease in cell surface sialic acid content (534, 537). That autologous or allogeneic NK cells or activated NK cells can lyse normal differentiated cells is supported by the relative sensitivity of normal fibroblast strains (34, 35) and normal fresh monocytes to NK cell lysis (538, 539).",

IFN treatment of target cells determines both resistance to NK cell lysis and increased expression of class I MHC antigens (543, 544, 546) .

Overall studies suggest that in some cases class I MHC antigen expression prevents the triggering of NK cells and, as suggested in one study (545), the formation of NK-target cell conjugates; however, in other cases this negative control is ineffective, possibly because other structures are present on the target cell membrane and are recognized by NK cells.",

            "text": "Several antigens present on target cell membranes have been proposed as possible NK cell target structures. The data are largely contrasting, and evidence in favor of the role of a single molecule has not been confirmed in other systems. It is possible that NK cells recognize different molecules that either play a primary role as target molecules responsible for conjugate formation and/or triggering or exert an accessory but not essential role in increasing the binding affinity between NK and target cells. The transferrin receptor (TfR) has received much attention as a possible target antigen on the basis of inhibition by anti-TfR antibodies and correlation between TfR expression on target cells and sensitivity to NK cells or ability of the cells to compete (552) (553) (554) . However, in several other studies (533, 555, 556) these results could not be reproduced, indicating that the role, if any, of the TfR as a target cell antigen is not unique. One study (557) suggested that the presence of either TfR or CDw32 FcyRII on cell lines could be sufficient for NK cell recognition, on the basis of antibody inhibition analysis. Expression of the CD15 antigen (3-fucosyl-N-acetyl-lactosamine hapten or X-hapten) on cell lines has been correlated with binding to and lysis by NK cells (558) . Those findings, together with the ability of anti-CD15 antibody to inhibit NK cell-mediated lysis (559) , suggested a role for the CD15 hapten in NK cell killing. Other investigators (143) identified the 140-kDa heterodimer detected by antibody 4F2 as the target cell structure recognized by several non-MHC-restricted cytotoxic T cell clones that express an identical TCR idiotype and recognize target cells through the TCR in an antigen-specific fashion; however, no role for 4F2 antigen was found in the killing mediated by human peripheral blood CD3-, TCR-NK cells (554, 560) . Recently, it was found that monoclonal antibodies directed against a 42-kDa molecule, possibly existing as a homodimer on target cells, efficiently inhibit NK cell binding to and lysis of all human and mouse target cell lines tested and of the fish parasite Tetruhymenu p y n~o~m i s , suggesting that the antigen is a primitive recognition structure present on the target cells (561) .",

Although it is known that sugars act at a postbinding stage (after the Ca2+ -requiring step) to inhibit lysis, the mechanism of this inhibition remains unclear (563, 564) .

These antagonistic effects of IFN may play a major regulatory role in in mvo NK cell activity, as discussed further in Section IX. Treatment of several cell lines for a few hours with IFN-a, -p, or -y induces a dose-dependent inhibition of target cell sensitivity to NK cell lysis (34, 503, 569, 571). Lysis by complement, ADCC, or CTLs is not affected (503, 569, 570, 572) . The induction of resistance requires active RNA and protein synthesis in the target cells (34). After 24-48 hours' incubation in the absence of IFN, target cells regain their sensitivity to NK cell lysis (503). The inhibition of NK cell lysis by IFN treatment of target cells is at a postbinding stage, as indicated by the observations that IFN-treated target cells are able to form conjugates with NK cells (503, 570) but not to induce NK cell cytotoxic factor (NKCF) release (573, 574) or Ca2+ influx in the effector cells (575) . However, IFN-treated cold target cells fail to compete for the lysis of untreated 51Cr-labeled target cells (503, 570) , showing that competition experiments measure the functional interaction of NK cells with target cells and not only target cell recognition (76). IFN-treated target cells are still sensitive to NK cell lysis triggered by IgG antibodies in ADCC (503, 569), and to the lysis mediated by NKCF (573, 574) . Surprisingly, however, sensitivity of IFN-treated K562 cells to the lysis mediated by purified granule material was reduced (575) . These contrasting results might reflect the use of different target cell types, i.e., normal fibroblast strains or K562 cells, in the various studies.",

            "text": "Different cell lines differ greatly in their sensitivity to the NK cellprotecting effect of IFN, and a correlation has been found between the abilities of IFN to induce antiviral activity and to protect the target cells from NK cell lysis (34, 569). A few units of IFN-a completely protected fibroblasts from lysis, whereas even very high concentrations of IFN-a or -y induced only partial protection of K562 cells (34, 576). Transformed or tumor-derived cell lines, on average, are more sensitive than are normal fibroblasts to IFN, although individual tumor-derived cell lines display high or intermediate sensitivity to the protective effect of IFN (569) . Infection of target cells with most viruses completely prevents the ability of IFN to protect target cells, probably because lytic infection by these viruses suppresses host cell RNA and protein synthesis (34). However, viruses such as lymphocyte choriomeningitis virus that do not suppress RNA and protein synthesis do not prevent the protective effect of IFN on target cells (511). In addition to fibroblasts, other normal cells are protected by IFN against NK cells, including normal thymocytes (521) and monocytes (577) . The IFN-induced increase in sialic acid expression on target cells has been inversely correlated with sensitivity to NK cell lysis (578) . The abilities of IFN to increase class I MHC expression and to decrease sensitivity to NK cells have been considered as evidence for the preferential NK cell lysis of target cells with low class I MHC expression (543, 544, 546) ; however, the demonstration that IFN can protect target cells without inducing class I expression (579) has shown that this is not the major mechanism by which IFN protects target cells. Normal and tumor target cells are rendered resistant to NK cell lysis by in vivo exposure to IFN (521, 570) , and IFN-treated B16 melanoma cells become NK cell resistant in vitro, with increased metastatic potential in Vivo (580) . The antagonistic effects of IFN on NK cells and their target cells in vivo may render NK cells selective against virus-infected target cells or IFN-resistant malignant cells by protecting normal cells from NK cell lysis and from competition with sensitive target cells. However, malignant cells that maintain IFN sensitivity or viruses that do not induce IFN resistance in the host cells might be able to escape the surveillance mechanism of NK cells.",

Although this mechanism may play a role in some systems, it is clearly not a general mechanism for NK cell-mediated cytotoxicity, as shown by several lines of evidence: (1) anti-IgG or anti-CD16 FcyR antibodies inhibit ADCC but not NK cell killing (79, 114, 132, 589-591), (2) phorbol diesters induce down-modulation of CD16 FcyR and inhibition of ADCC but not of NK cell killing (133) , and (3) NK cells from scid mice and from several SCID patients are cytotoxic both in vilro and in vivo even if the animals and the patients do not produce IgG (400, 401, 410, 412, 413) . However, interaction of CD16 FcyR with aggregated IgG, immune complexes, or cross-linked monoclonal anti-CD16 antibodies at 37OC induces inhibition of both ADCC and spontaneous cytotoxic activity (32, 132, 592-594). These data suggest that CD16 FcyR are not directly involved in the mechanism of NK cell-mediated spontaneous cytotoxicity, but that aggregation of the FcyR, e.g., by interaction with IgG-sensitized target cells or with immune complexes, may trigger and eventually exhaust the same cytotoxic mechanism involved in spontaneous cytotoxicity.",

When PBLs containing NK cells were incubated at 37OC, but not at 4OC, with K562 target cells, NK cells were completely unable to lyse freshly added target cells after 4 hours of incubation (76). This inactivation was not seen with target cells, such as mycoplasma-or virus-infected cells, that were able to induce IFN production (76, 595), and IFN (76) and IL-2 (596) restored cytotoxic ability in NK cells that were separated from the target cells. The inactivation of NK cells was not target cell specific, and NK cells also showed abrogated or reduced cytotoxicity against target cells unrelated to those used for inactivation or against IgG-coated target cells (76, 597). IFN-treated target cells, which were resistant to NK cell lysis, were unable to induce NK cell inactivation (503, 595). These data were originally interpreted by assuming that after one or a few lytic interactions with the target cells, NK cells exhausted preformed lytic mediators required for both ADCC and spontaneous cytotoxicity and therefore became unable to mediate additional cytotoxicity unless stimulated by IFN or IL-2 (76). However, Brahmi et al. (598) demonstrated that the target cell-induced NK cell inactivation also occurs in the absence of Ca2+, suggesting that it affects an early calcium-independent event in the activation of the human NK cell cytolytic mechanism.",

Following this activation, again by analogy with T cells (605, 606) , the G protein may remain in a refractory state, thereby preventing activation of NK cells by either IgG-coated or sensitive target cells. The independence from extracellular Ca2+ of the stimulation of phosphoinositide metabolism in NK cells suggests that inactivation of the G protein, like the inactivation of the cytotoxic mechanism by target cells (598), should also not require extracellular Ca2+.",

Patients with severe deficiency of the common CD18 chain and therefore lacking all three molecules are deficient in NK cell activity (378, 607) . Antibodies to the CD18 chain efficiently block NK cell-mediated cytotoxicity by preventing binding of NK cells to target cells (179, 608, 609) . Patients with selective deficiency in CDlla (LFA-1) expression are also deficient in NK cell-mediated cytotoxicity (608) . A series of antibodies directed against various epitopes of the CDlla molecule inhibited both NK cell-mediated and CTLmediated cytotoxicity; these antibodies had different efficiency in inhibiting cytotoxicity, but the same hierarchy of functionally relevant CDlla epitopes was shown for NK cells and CTLs (608) . The antibodies inhibited lysis at the effector cell level by preventing NK-target cell conjugate formation (608) . When peripheral blood NK cells were tested, inhibition by anti-CDlla antibodies was observed with several different target cell lines (610) ; with one NK cell clone used as effector cells, lysis of K562 cells but not that of other target cells was inhibited (610), whereas with other clones, the opposite result was observed (611) . CDlla (LFA-1) is therefore an important adhesion molecule in the interaction of cytotoxic cells, both NK cells and CTLs, with target cells; the variable requirements for the CDlla molecules in binding of different target cells from different clones suggest that that either CDlla is one of several receptors that NK cells can use for binding or it has only an accessory function, essential only when other receptors responsible for the specificity of the binding do not ensure a binding of sufficient affinity. No evidence has been provided that CDlla is a functional receptor capable of signal transduction and triggering of NK cells.",

Expression of CDllb on the NK cells is required for the enhancing effect (612); however, it is possible that this phenomenon reflects only a bridging effect that enhances NKtarget cell contact, without triggering of the NK cells through the CDllb molecule. Antibodies to CDllb or CDllc did not directly affect NK cell-mediated cytotoxicity against a variety of target cells, including the Raji cell line, in the absence of complement (179), although the lysis of Raji cells with bound C3 was inhibited by anti-CDllb antibodies (612) .",

CD2 is an antigen-independent pathway of T cell activation, and treatment of T cells with anti-Tll2 plus anti-T113 antibodies induces expression of IL-2 receptor, secretion of IL-2, and proliferation of T cells (624) . Treatment of peripheral blood NK cells with anti-Tll2 and anti-Tl13 does not induce cell proliferation (625) . This lack of a proliferative effect of anti-CD2 antibodies is probably due to a lack of IL-2 production (626), because anti-CD2 antibodies stimulated expression of the IL-2 receptor in NK cell clones (627) and increased the cytotoxic activity of both fresh NK cells (628) and NK cell clones (629, 630) . Anti-CD2-treated NK cells showed increased adhesion to the target cells and oriented discharge of granules on the area of contact with the target cells (630); simultaneous treatment with anti-CDlla antibodies blocked NK-target cell adhesion and induced NK cells to secrete their intracellular granules, as measured by release of proteoglycans, without reorientation of the granules (630) . This activation by anti-CD2 antibodies was induced when F(ab ')2 fragments were used, excluding the involvement of FcyR (630) . However, when a single anti-CD2 antibody was used, signal transduction, as shown by increased [Ca2+]i and cytotoxicity, was induced by interaction of the Fc portion of the anti-CD2 antibody with the CD16 FcR, since the F(ab')2 fragment of the anti-CD2 antibody did not induce signal transduction and anti-CD16 antibodies partially blocked signal transduction induced by the intact anti-CD2 IgG antibody (631) .",

These antibodies also react with human NK cells and inhibit the cytotoxicity of human NK cells and non-MHC-restricted CTLs against a variety of target cells (632, 633) . The antibodies precipitate a heterodimer of 41 and 38 kDa from fish cells and of 43 and 38 kDa from human cells (271, 632, 633). These results, together with the studies (561) suggesting common target molecules on the fish parasite Tetrahymena pyrfoormis and NK cellsensitive target cells, suggest that NK cells recognize target cells as using a receptor-ligand system that is highly conserved during evolution. Preliminary reports have described other possible NK cell receptors. Ortaldo et al. (634) showed that antiidiotypic antibodies directed against an antibody specific for a glycoprotein of K562 cells react with an 80-kDa molecule on NK cells, block target binding and lysis by NK cells, and, when used to pretreat NK cells, enhance cytotoxicity and induce IFN production. Timonen et al. (635) have shown that certain antibodies to the F(ab')z of IgG specifically stain LGLs, precipitate predominantly a 60-kDa molecule from them, and block lysis by preventing postbinding reorientation of the effector cells. Interestingly, an antibody that reacts with the p48 lamininlike molecules on LGLs cross-reacts with the Ig light chain (636) .",

However, unlike CTLs, NK cells do not appear to have antigenic specificity or clonally distributed receptors. Yet heterogeneity of NK cell and selectivity for target cells have been shown by competition experiments and by analysis of the selectivity of NK cell clones. Thus, the selectivity of NK cells might be determined by the relative expression of several cell surface molecules and receptors, and all of the molecules discussed above might play some role in either the recognition or the postbinding phases, with no single molecule playing a unique and essential role. Different sets of molecules might be involved in each combination of NK-target cells and a heterogeneity in the functional role of the various molecules might exist at both the NK and target cell levels.",

After binding to the target cells, the NK cell undergoes a series of events known as activation and programming of the target cell to lysis. These events are temperature dependent (optimal temperature, 37OC), Ca2 + dependent, and sensitive to Ca2+ channel blockers and calmodulin inhibitors (406, (643) (644) (645) (646) (647) (648) . As previously discussed, initiation of NK cell activation might depend on an enhancement of phosphoinositide metabolism that is independent of extracellular Ca2+, and it is triggered by interaction of CD16 FcyR with antibody-coated target cells or of other unknown NK cell membrane structures with NK cell-sensitive target cells. The formation of 1P3 and IP4 induces an increase in [Ca2+]i, first by release of Ca2+ from intracellular stores and then by the influx of extracellular Ca2 +, which is required for maintenance of increased levels. Chelation of extracellular Ca2+ probably prevents continuation of the lytic mechanism at this stage. An increase in CAMP has been shown to inhibit NK cell-mediated cytotoxicity; although inhibition of NKtarget cell conjugates has been observed when cAMP levels in NK cells are increased (649), the major effect of increased cAMP is probably inhibition of the increased phosphoinositide metabolism (601, 604) . Inhibition of NK cell activity by interaction with monomeric IgG is also primarily mediated by elevation of cAMP (650) . Following the enhancement of phosphoinositide metabolism, activation of protein kinase C is probably involved in the cytotoxic mechanism, as indicated by inhibition of cytotoxicity by specific inhibitors (602) .",

Exposure of PBLs to NK cell-sensitive target cells increases phospholipid methylation, and natural killing is reduced by the inhibition of methyltransferases as well as by inhibitors of phospholipase A2 (576, 653) , although some caution should be exerted in interpreting the specificity of phospholipase A2 inhibitors (654). These findings suggest that metabolism of arachidonic acid is required for NK cell activity. However, inhibition of cyclooxygenase and prostaglandin synthesis does not affect NK cell activity, and various prostaglandins inhibit NK cell activity at binding and postbinding stages by increasing CAMP levels in the NK cells (655, 656) . IFN and IL-2 activation of NK cells reduces the sensitivity to inhibition by prostaglandin and CAMP-elevating agents (655, 657) . Inhibition of lipooxygenase decreases NK cell cytotoxicity, suggesting a role for endogenous lipooxygenase metabolites (leukotrienes) in NK cell activity (654, 658, 659) . Recently, it has been shown that specific inhibitors of leukotriene C4 (LTc4) synthesis inhibit NK cell cytotoxicity and that addition of LTC4 prevents the inhibition, suggesting an essential although unknown role of this arachidonic acid metabolite in cytotoxicity (659).",

This rapid phase, which is independent of temperature over the range 10-37OC, is followed by a very slow, Ca2+ -independent disintegration of additional target cells (660).

This NK cell cytotoxic factor (NKCF) is lytic for NK cell-sensitive target cells, but not for most NK cell-resistant target cells (664, 665, 667) . Detailed studies have shown that successful NK cellmediated lysis requires that the target cells: (1) be recognized by NK cells, allowing conjugate formation, (2) be able to induce release of NKCF (or other lytic mediators) from NK cells, and (3) be sensitive to the effect of the lytic mediators (573, 667) . IFN-treated cells form conjugates with NK cells and are sensitive to NKCF but fail to induce release of the factor (573) . These findings might explain the failure of IFN to protect target cells from ADCC mediated by NK cells (503): The interaction of the antibodies with FcyR on NK cells may induce release of lytic mediators, circumventing the step blocked by IFN treatment of the target cells.",

When the U937 cell line is used as a target for measuring NKCF activity, most of the activity is mediated by TNF, indicating that TNF is one component of NKCF and is produced by NK cells upon interaction with target cells (668, 669). When TNF-resistant cell lines such as K562 are used, the presence in NKCF of lytic factors different from TNF can be clearly demonstrated (669-672). However, these lytic molecules have not yet been purified, and molecular weights between 5,000 and 50,000 have been reported (668, 671, 672) . A 50-kDa lytic molecule that cross-reacts with both TNF and lymphotoxin has been demonstrated in the granules and the cytoplasm of CTLs (673). Whether this lytic molecule is also present in NK cells and is related to NKCF remains to be determined. The characteristics of the lysis mediated by NKCF, especially the slow kinetics of lysis, make it unlikely that NKCF is the only mediator of lysis and participates in the rapid phase of disintegration of the target cells (660), although it is possible that faster kinetics of lysis is induced when high local concentrations of NKCF are reached in the contact area between effector and target cells. However, the slow second phase of target cell disintegration has been shown to be mediated by soluble factors produced by NK cells in the supernatant fluid and probably is induced by the lytic effect of NKCF (660).",

The granule molecule able to form the pores is a 70-kDa protein called pore-forming protein (PFP), or perforin (638) . PFP requires Ca2+ for pore formation in membranes and it is rapidly aggregated and inactivated by the presence of Ca2+ in the medium; thus, PFP cannot represent a lytic factor present in the supernatant fluid, such as NKCF. Both human and murine perforins cross-react with antibodies to the C9 component of complement, another molecule able to polymerize to form pore structures in membranes in the presence of Zn2+ (638) . Human PFP was cloned and the high homology with C9 was confirmed by the nucleotide sequence (674). Whereas resting CTL precursor cells do not contain PFP and accumulate it only after stimulation, a low level of PFP can be isolated from the granules of human resting NK cells (675). NK cells are the only resting lymphocytes expressing detectable amounts of PFP constitutively (675).",

            "text": "It was initially reported that PFP isolated from freshly obtained human NK cells was able to form functional pores in liposome membranes but that it lacked efficient hemolytic activity, as measured on SRBCs (675, 676). It was also observed that NK cells are resistant to the lysis mediated by PFP, suggesting that they are protected from autolysis during cell-mediated cytotoxicity (677, 678). C9-mediated lysis is inefficient on homologous RBCs and nucleated target cells; therefore, lysis of autologous cells is probably prevented when complement is activated in vivo (678, 679) . This homologous restriction is mediated by a 65-kDa protein called homologous restriction factor (HRF), related to C8 and C9 and present on RBCs (679) and nucleated cells (678, 679). By complexing rapidly with attacking C8 and C9 molecules, HRF is thought to interrupt the C polymerization process that leads to channel formation, and it has also been shown, in high concentrations, to prevent lysis of RBCs by the C9-related PFP and by NK cells in ADCC (679). It was postulated that the resistance of NK cells and CTLs to PFP was mediated by membrane and granule-associated soluble HRF (679, 680). However, human PFP from NK cells shows a species preference (i.e., it is unable to lyse RBCs from sheep and other species) but not an homologous restriction (i,e,, it lyses human and mouse RBCs) (674, 678). These data explain the previously described lack of hemolytic activity of human PFP when tested on SRBCs, and exclude that the resistance of NK cells to PFP is mediated by HRF (674, 678) . NK cells and CTLs, like other nucleated targets, are resistant to lysis by homologous but not heterologous complement; however, these cell types are resistant to both homologous and heterologous PFP (678). The resistance of NK cells to PFP is a property of resting NK cells and it is increased by stimulation with IL-2 (678). The mechanism of protection of cytotoxic cells against PFP is unknown and could be mediated by a protein with similar functional characteristics but distinct from HRF.",

However, PFP-mediated lysis is not a universal mechanism of cell-mediated lysis, and much controversy exists about whether it is the major mechanism of lysis, mediated by CTLs (681). In vitro grown, IL-%-dependent CTLs have LGL morphology and contain PFP in their granules. However, highly efficient CTLs freshly obtained from alloimmunized animals do not have LGL morphology, do not contain detectable PFP, and no channels are demonstrable on the lysed target cells (681). Also, CTLs can kill certain target cells in the absence of Ca2+ in the medium, contradicting the granule exocytosis model (682). Thus, these CTLs probably use a different mechanism of lysis, and it has been proposed that direct interaction between CTL receptors and target cell antigens may irreversibly damage target cell membranes, activating an endogenous mechanism of cell lysis (681). There is indeed a major difference in the KCIL following NK cell or CTL interaction which has received little attention but may reflect fundamentally different mechanisms of lysis: If Ca2+ is chelated during lysis mediated by noncultured CTLs, the release of 51Cr continues for 1-2 hours, showing a slow lysis of the programmed target cells (683), whereas in the case of ADCC (684) or spontaneous lysis mediated by NK cells (73) an almost immediate arrest of 51Cr release is observed upon chelation of Ca2+.",

Human target cells present little or no DNA degradation when lysed by either human or murine cytotoxic cells (688, 689) ; because the difference in DNA degradation depends on the species of the target cells, not the effector cells, the degradation is probably due to activation of target cell endogenous endonucleases.",

In many of the reports that claim enhanced NK cell ADCC activity, the researchers have disregarded the confounding effect of (1) increased spontaneous (antibody-independent) background killing of the target cells mediated by NK cells and (2) the possibility that the high concentrations of antibodies used to sensitize the target cells trigger both monocyte and NK cell cytotoxicity. However, experimental conditions have been reported that rigorously demonstrated an enhancing effect, although modest, of IFN on NK cell ADCC activity (724). Spontaneous cytotoxicity and ADCC are two functions mediated by the same NK cell type. These functions may depend on discrete mechanisms of target cell recognition that activate the same or two different lytic processes. Although the differential effect of IFN on spontaneous cytotoxicity and ADCC might be considered evidence for separate mechanisms, it is more likely that the enhancing effect of IFN on ADCC activity of NK cells is difficult to demonstrate because the interaction of IgG on target cells with CD16 FcR on NK cells determines optimal stimulation of NK cells and maximal killing that cannot be further increased by IFN. The inefficiency of IFN in enhancing ADCC activity is therefore analogous to its inefficiency in enhancing the lysis of target cells very sensitive to NK cell-mediated lysis, as discussed above. In support of this interpretation, it was reported that the enhancing effect of IFN on ADCC activity of NK cells is observed only when suboptimal concentrations of antibodies are used (726, 727).",

Murine suppressor cells for NK cell activity have been shown to be both macrophages (735) (736) (737) (738) (739) (740) and T cells (741, 742) . Prostaglandins (PGs), which inhibit spontaneous cytotoxicity in vitro, are probably the soluble mediators of the suppression mediated by macrophages (743) . In humans normal granulocytes (104) and, to a lesser extent, peripheral blood monocytes (104, 744, 745) have suppressor activity on NK cells. Tumor-associated lymphocytes and macrophages from patients with different types of malignancies have been found to inhibit NK cell cytotoxicity (746) (747) (748) (749) (750) . Indomethacin, in some cases, reverses the inhibition, suggesting that PGs are also involved in the suppressive effect mediated by human macrophages (748, 751) . PGs of the E series suppress human NK cell activity (751) (752) (753) (754) ; however, IFN treatment of NK cells decreases their sensitivity to this suppressive effect (755) . Activation of human lymphocytes in culture induces the generation of suppressor cells for NK cell activity (756, 757) . In one study these suppressor cells were identified as HNK-I+, FcpR+ but FcyR-, CD16-non-T cells (756) . On the basis of this phenotype, it was suggested that NK cells themselves can function as immunoregulators, controlling their own cytotoxic activity. Suppressor cells for NK cell activity have also been found in normal human cord blood (341); these suppressor cells are probably in part responsible for the reduced NK cell activity mediated by human cord blood lymphocytes, notwithstanding a normal proportion of both LGLs (341) and CD16+ cells (95). The cord blood suppressor cells have been identified as medium-sized CD3+, FcyR+ T cells. IFN treatment of these cells abolishes their suppressive activity (341).",

            "text": "TGF-0 and platelet-derived growth factor have inhibitory effects on NK cell-mediated cytotoxicity (758, 759) . TGF-0 prevents the enhancement of NK cell cytotoxicity induced by IFN, but not that induced by T cell growth factor or IL-2 is a potent enhancer of NK cell activity in Vitro and in vivo (708, (760) (761) (762) (763) (764) . The optimal doses of IL-2 able to enhance NK cell-mediated cytotoxicity are 100-to 1000-fold higher than those required for maintaining proliferation of activated T lymphocytes, and antibodies against the p55 chain (TAC or CD25 antigen) of the IL-2 receptor are unable to prevent NK cell enhancement of cell cytotoxicity (708, 763) . These data suggested the existence on NK cells of an IL-2 receptor different from the high-affinity IL-2 receptor associated with the TAC antigen and became interpretable when it was discovered that IL-2 (758). the high-affinity IL-2 receptor is composed of the p55 chain (TAC antigen) and a second p70 chain (765) . Resting NK cells express higher levels of the p70 chain than do other lymphocytes (766) . The p70 chain, when not associated with the p55 chain, binds IL-2 with an affinity approximately one hundredth that of the complete receptor and is responsible for the response of resting NK cells to IL-2 (766, 767) . The same high concentrations of IL-2 induce a modest production of IFN-y from resting NK cells (708) . It was originally reported that the enhancement of NK cell cytotoxicity by IL-2 was mediated by endogenously produced IFN-y (761, 763) . However, the use of impure anti-IFN-y antibody preparations was shown to be responsible for some of the results originally reported (768) , and there is now general agreement that the effect of IL-2 is direct and not mediated by IFN-y, because (1) The enhancement of cytotoxic activity of NK cells is demonstrable after 3-6 hours of incubation and does not require proliferation (708) . Incubation of PBLs with IL-2 in the absence of other stimuli, however, induces moderate cellular proliferation after 3-4 days of incubation (708) . Analysis of the proliferating cells by autoradiography after treatment of PBLs with IL-2 has shown that a proportion of both NK and T cells is induced into the cell cycle (708) . However, limiting dilution experiments (93, 772) and colchicine blockage experiments (93) showed that the majority of mature peripheral blood NK cells can be induced into the cell cycle by IL-2 alone, whereas only a minor proportion of low-density T cells is induced to proliferate. The effect of endogenously produced IFN-y on the IL-2-induced proliferation of NK cells is controversial, but inhibition of proliferation by anti-IFN-y antibodies was shown in cultures of both human (773) and murine (774) NK cells. Induction of proliferation of N K cells requires the same high concentrations of IL-2 as the enhancement of cytotoxic activity or production of IFN-7 and does not depend on expression of the TAC antigen on NK cells (93). It is therefore likely that induction of proliferation is also mediated through the p70 chain of IL-2 receptor, with intermediate affinity for IL-2. However, IL-2 induces expression of TAC (CD25) antigen on purified NK cells after 2-4 days of culture (191) and anti-TAC antibodies suppress proliferation (93), suggesting that expression of the high-affinity IL-2 receptor is required for maintenance of proliferation. In addition to TAC (CD25) antigen, other activation antigens such as TfR, CD38, and class I1 MHC antigens become strongly expressed on proliferating NK cells (191) . When NK cells revert to a resting state, cell surface expression of CD25, CD38, and TfR decreases or ceases, whereas NK cells remain class I1 MHC positive (100). Recently, cell surface expression Leu-23, an antigen present as a 60-kDa heterodimer composed of two chains of 32 and 28 kDa, has been shown to be induced and phosphorylated on the large majority of NK cells after a few hours of stimulation with IL-2 (775), confirming that the majority of resting NK cells respond to I L-2.",

Infusion of autologous in vilro generated LAK cells in patients, together with recombinant IL-2, has resulted in at least partial regression of solid tumors in a low but significant proportion of patients (27). Although LAK cells have been originally described as CD3+ cytotoxic cells originated from CD3-precursors (777), studies from many groups have clearly shown that most of the cytotoxicity mediated by LAK cells is due to IL-2-activated CD3-NK cells, although a minor component could be due to non-MHC-restricted cytotoxic CD3+ T cells (156, 708, 764, 779-781). The cytotoxic cells present in the peripheral blood of patients receiving IL-2 have also been shown to be mostly or exclusively CD3-NK cells (764) . The identification of NK cells as the major mediators of LAK cell cytotoxic activity, as measured by in uitro assays, does not, however, provide information on the cell type responsible for tumor regression in vivo in patients treated with unfractionated, IL-2-treated PBLs, composed, in large proportion, of T cells. The definition of LAK cells does not identify a single or novel cell type, but rather identifies a phenomenon, i.e., the ability of IL-2 to enhance the cytotoxicity of NK cells and to endow certain T cells with non-MHC-restricted cytotoxic ability. The analysis of the LAK cell phenomenon has generated little original information on the biology of NK cells, and its description is beyond the scope of the present review.",

IFN and IL-2 increase the locomotor ability of NK cells, without increasing their ability to respond to chemoattractants (789) . The migration of NK cells can be demonstrated by using nitrocellulose filters, but not polycarbonate filters, which require the migrating cells to behave as adherent cells (790) . Treatment of NK cells with phorbol diesten, however, activates NK cells, enhancing their cytotoxic ability (133, 791) and making them able to adhere to various substrates (792) . Phorbol diester-activated NK cells migrate through polycarbonate filters as adherent cells (791) . These data, together with the ability of IL-2 to induce adherence of NK cells, but not T cells, to endothelial cells (793, 794) , suggest that the change of adherence capability and migratory behavior of NK cells following activation may be determinant to induce activated NK cells to adhere to vascular lining and localize in tissues.",

Although the exact mechanism of action of the cell line is unknown, it has been shown that they do not increase the frequency of NK cells entering the cell cycle in response to IL-2, but rather facilitate the continuous proliferation of the NK cells (93). During culture of total PBLs with irradiated B lymphoblastoid cell lines, cell surface activation antigens are rapidly induced (100, 192). NK target cell structures present on the cell lines used as a stimulator may play a direct role in inducing NK cell activation because the MHC-negative, NK-sensitive K562 cell line has been reported to induce proliferation of NK cells but not T cells (798) .",

After 10 days of cultures, an average fourfold increase in total cell number is observed, with NK cells representing between 50 and 90% of the total cells recovered (100). NK cells can be easily purified from these cultures. This represents a technically simple method for obtaining large quantities of pure NK cells without the need of adding IL-2 to the culture and has been instrumental in obtaining large numbers of human NK cells for molecular and biochemical studies (78, 637, 675, 799). The preferential NK cell proliferation is not observed when PBLs are stimulated by irradiated allogeneic PBLs in a classical mixed-lymphocyte culture or when PBLs are cultured in the pressnce of IL-2 alone (100). NK cell proliferation occurs in the absence of exogenously added IL-2, but is blocked by anti-IL-2 antibodies and requires the presence of CD4+ T cells in the starting PBL preparation, suggesting that the CD4+ T cells stimulated by the allogeneic lymphoblastoid cell lines produce IL-2 that, together with irradiated cell line, induce the preferential proliferation of NK cells (100). An alternative, or additional, interpretation may be suggested by the observation (492, 493 ) that mitomycin C-treated autologous T cell blasts are able to induce generation of NK-like cells from CD3-small-lymphocyte precursors. It is possible that CD4+ blasts, generated by allogeneic stimulation with the irradiated B cell lines, similarly induce proliferatioddifferentiation of NK cells and/or NK precursor cells.",

Cassatella, personal communication). The inefficiency of NK cells to produce growth factor such as IL-2 might be responsible for the failure of lectins to induce NK cell proliferation. Phorbol diesters and calcium ionophores together have been shown to induce proliferation of Percoll-enriched preparations of NK cells (800); however, using the same stimuli, we (L. London and G. Trinchieri, unpublished observations) have been unable to obtain proliferation of NK cells purified by positive selection of CD16+ cells, raising the possibility that contaminant accessory or suppressor cells may regulate NK cell proliferation in these experimental conditions. The effect of IL-4 on NK cell cytotoxicity and proliferation is controversial, with opposite results reported with human and murine NK cells. IL-4 has no effect on the cytotoxic ability of human resting NK cells, but it inhibits in a dose-dependent manner the IL-2-induced cytolytic activation of NK cells, but not the IFN-induced activation (801, 802) . IL-4 acts directly on purified NK cells and does not require accessory cells (802) . In the murine system, however, IL-4 alone was shown to induce non-MHC-restricted cytotoxic cells against fresh tumor cells and to augment the effect of IL-2 on the generation of cytotoxic cells (803, 804) , although, unlike IL-2-induced cytotoxic cells, T cells, not NK cells, represent the major component of the IL-4-induced cytotoxic cells (804) . Indeed, IL-4 was shown to have a modest effect, if any, on the cytotoxicity and proliferation of purified murine NK cells or on spleen cells from scid mice, lacking T cells (229).",

A third factor, NK cell granule-macrophage activating factor, is a small protein (less than 10 kDa), heat stable and able to activate the tumoridical activity of bone marrow-derived macrophages in the presence of lipopolysaccharide (811). The optimal release of these factors from the granules requires ionic solubilization in 2 M NaCl, suggesting that they are tightly bound to an internal granule matrix. Because these factors are released in active form during degranulation, physiological mechanisms equivalent to this ionic solubilization should take place, and granule proteases may act to digest an internal matrix to liberate some molecules stored in an inactive form (810, 811). The granule-associated factors with activity on phagocytic cells might play role in the effect of NK cells in Vivo against bacterial infections, as discussed in Section IX.",

This activation of CL in monocytes mediated by NK cells was found to be responsible for the CL response attributed directly to NK cells in previous studies (813, 814). The CL response described in NK cells after interaction with target cells was shown to be due to the presence of few contaminant monocytes stimulated by NK cells or NK products (812). NK cells are incapable of oxidative burst and do not produce superoxide anion during interaction with target cells (812, 815-817). NK cell cytotoxic activity does not require oxygen-dependent mechanisms, as shown by intact NK cell cytotoxic activity in chronic granulomatous disease patients (818). Because several hydroxyl radical (OH) scavengers inhibit cytotoxicity, it was proposed that OH is critical for NK cell cytotoxicity (815, 819, 2186). Because NK cells do not have NADPH oxidase acrivity, as was also confirmed by the impossibility to demonstrate in purified NK cells mRNA for the heavy chain of cytochrome b245, an integral part of the NADPH oxidase system (M. Cassatella and G. Trinchieri, unpublished observations), it was hypothesized that OH scavengers are formed by the lipooxygenase pathway of arachidonic acid metabolism (819). However, the observations that OH scavengers inhibit NK cell cytotoxicity only when used at concentrations higher than those required to inhibit CL in monocytes (816) and that electron spin resonance spectroscopy does not reveal OH radical production in activated NK cells (820) strongly argue against the hypothesis that OH radical production plays a role in the early event of NK cell activation.",

            "text": "The possibility that NK cells might be able to secrete factors with NKenhancing activity, such as IFN and IL-2, and thus be capable of selfregulation has generated much interest (34, 79, 821). In the early studies of NK cell cytotoxicity against cell lines able to induce IFN-a production, e.g., virus-infected target cells, it was not possible with the reagents available to unambiguously distinguish between NK cells and IFN-aproducing cells, although the fact that IFN-a-producing cells were all E-rosette negative-whereas about 50% of NK cell cytotoxic activity was recovered in the E-rosette-positive cell fractionexcluded a complete identity between the two cell types (34, 569, 706, 822) . Several reports have, however, subsequently appeared, suggesting that the major IFN-a producer cells in peripheral blood were NK cells, based on results showing that the cells were found in the light-density fractions of a Percoll gradient and that they adhered to NK target cells (821, (823) (824) (825) (826) . Recently, however, several groups have shown that the IFN-a-producing cells in response to viruses, virus-infected cells, and other stimuli are HLA-DR+ nonadherent cells, distinct from monocytes, dendritic cells, or T, B, or NK cells (92, 510, 827-829). Resting NK cells have null or very low ability to produce IFN-a (92, 510). The role of this IFN-a-producing cell type in the cytotoxicity of NK cells against virus-infected target cells will be discussed in Section IX.",

IL-2 production has never been conclusively demonstrated using highly purified preparations of NK cells and the bulk of evidence, showing that NK cells cannot be induced to proliferate by a variety of mitogenic stimuli in the absence of IL-2-producing cells or an exogenous source of IL-2, suggests that NK cells are unable to produce IL-2 or are very poor producers.

Cross-linking of CD16 FcR or IL-2 treatment of highly purified NK cells induces low levels of IFN-y and TNF production; the two stimuli, however, strongly synergize and high levels of both cytokines are released when NK cells are stimulated by the two stimuli together (78). Both stimuli induce transcription of the lymphokine genes and accumulation of mRNA transcripts in the cytoplasm; however, the synergistic effect of the two stimuli is observed at the mRNA accumulation level but not at the transcription level, suggesting that both stimuli induce lymphokine expression by acting at the transcriptional level, but that the synergistic effect is mostly posttranscriptional (78). The induction of transcription of lymphokine genes by CD16 ligands or IL-2 takes place in less than 20 minutes and mRNA accumulation does not require protein synthesis, suggesting a direct effect without other de novo produced proteins acting as intermediate messengers (78). CD16 ligands but not IL-2 induce phosphoinositide turnover and an increase of [Ca2+]i, originated from intracellular stores and from extracellular Ca2+ (637) . The accumulation of mRNA and the induction of transcription by CD16 ligands but not by IL-2 require extracellular Ca2: indicating the importance of the increased [Ca2+]i in the induction of transcription by CD16 ligands and the different signal transduction mechanisms used by the two stimuli (637) .",

In many patients the CD16+, CD3-, NKH-l/Leu-19+ NK cell subset is significantly reduced, whereas the CD3+, NKH-l/Leu-l9+ one is present in normal proportions ( -3 %) and is responsible for most of the low NK cell cytotoxic activity mediated by the PBLs of these patients (844).",

In patients with breast cancer, the level of NK cell activity was associated with various pathological parameters, such as nodal status; however, more than half of the baseline NK cell activity variance could be accounted for by factors such as patient adjustment, lack of social support, and fatigue/depression symptoms (846). NK cell activity is reduced in women undergoing conjugal bereavement (847, 848). Bereaved women showed reduced NK cell activity and increased plasma cortisol levels as compared to controls; however, anticipatory bereaved women also showed significantly reduced NK cell activity, although levels of plasma cortisol were comparable to those of controls; thus, the reduction of NK cell activity could not be explained on the basis of increased cortisol secretion (848). The importance of depression associated with commonplace stressful events was shown by a study of medical students during academic examinations: PBLs from blood samples collected at the time of the examination produced significantly less IFN and mediated significantly lower NK cell cytotoxicity than did PBLs from samples taken 6 weeks earlier (849). That the depression symptoms are more important than the stressful event per se in determining NK cell activity was shown in a study of 114 healthy undergraduate volunteers undergoing life change stress (850). The group of students reacting to the stress with psychiatric symptoms of depression (poor copers) had significantly lower NK cell activity than the group without symptoms (good copers) (850).",

(858) (859) (860) investigated the effect on NK cells of two types of inescapable foot-shock stress: (1) applied intermittently, causing analgesia that appears to be mediated by opioid peptides and learned helplessness, considered to be a model for human psychological depression and (2) applied continuously, inducing equally potent analgesia not involving opioids. The opioid but not the nonopioid form of stress suppresses the cytotoxic activity of NK cells in rats. The decrease in NK cell cytotoxicity by opioid stress is blocked by the opioid receptor antagonist naltrexone and is mimicked by systemic administration of morphine (858, 860). Morphine injected into the lateral ventricle of the brain suppresses NK cell activity to the same degree as a systemic dose three orders of magnitude higher, and this effect is also blocked by naltrexone (861). NK cell activity was unaffected by a morphine analog that does not cross the blood-brain barrier (861). These data implicate brain opiate receptors in the morphine-induced suppression of NK cell cytotoxicity. Morphine induces tolerance, i.e., repeated injections of morphine no longer result in suppression of NK cell activity, whereas foot-shock stress does not induce tolerance and is not prevented by the morphine-induced tolerance (859). The lack of tolerance and cross-tolerance with morphine might mean that the two effects on NK cells are mediated by different mechanisms or use different opiate receptors (859).",

The NK cell-suppressive effect of CRF was antagonized by intraventricular, but not systemic, preadministration of a CRF antagonist (862). These data suggest that CRF released in the brain following stressful stimuli may have a role in controlling the modulation of NK cell cytotoxicity. The observed effect of CRF might be mediated by increased sympathoadrenal activity and/or activation of the pituitary-adrenal axis. Intraventricular administration of CRF produces an activation of sympathetic outflow and an acute increase in plasma concentrations of norepinephrine and epinephrine. Release of norepinephrine from sympathetic nerve endings innervating the spleen might then inhibit NK cell cytotoxicity (863). CRF might also act in part by stimulating the release of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) and P-endorphin from the anterior pituitary. However, the systemic administration of CRF, which does not affect NK cell cytotoxicity, is able to induce ACTH and @endorphin release from the pituitary gland. Furthermore, the suppression of NK cells is not blocked by the peripheral administration of CRF analogs, which prevent the effect on the pituitary mediated by the centrally administered CRE ACI'H and 0-endorphin therefore do not appear to play a major role in the effect of CRF on NK cells in mvo (862) .",

However, @-endorphin injected in mvo increased NK cell activity, raising some doubt about the role of endogenous opioids in the suppression of NK cell activity in this system and about the specificity of naloxone and naltrexone as opioid antagonists (864). Indeed, in several in m'tro studies, @endorphin, Leu-enkephalin, and Metenkephalin actually enhanced NK cell cytotoxicity and production of IFN-7 (865 -869). However, Williamson et al. (870) have demonstrated activation of NK cells by 0-endorphin in the range 10-ll-lO-sM, but inhibition of NK cell activity by this opioid in the range 10-17-10-13M. Thus, it is possible that 0-endorphin is present in mvo after stress at the low concentration that induces suppression of NK cell cytotoxicity and is responsible for the inhibition. N-acetyl-0-endorphin, which has no opioid activity, does not affect NK cell activity (870). However, nonopioid fragments of 0-endorphin enhance NK cell cytotoxicity, and the effect is blocked by naloxone (871). These data raise the possibility that the enhancement of NK cell cytotoxicity by endorphin fragments is not mediated through opioid receptors. The increase in cytotoxic activity of NK cells treated with 0-endorphin is due to the increased number of target-binding cells and of cytotoxic cells among binders and to increased recycling capacity (872).",

One study (873) reported a significant fall in human NK cell activity during the periovulatory period, although another study (217) found no significant difference. In the mouse highest NK cell activity, corresponding to the time of the lowest metastatic potential of surgically removed mammary adenocarcinoma, occurs during the proestrus and estrus stages (874) . During pregnancy, an NK cell depression is present from the first trimester to the postpartum period (875, 876) . The mechanism of this depression is not clear, and both normal and decreased levels in the numbers of NK cells, in the NK cell cytotoxic potential, and in the recycling ability have been reported (877) (878) (879) (880) . The depression of NK cell cytotoxic activity in pregnancy correlates inversely with the level of 170-estradiol in the sera of pregnant women. Treatment of mice with 170-estradiol or diethylstilbestrol decreases NK cell cytotoxicity by decreasing the number of NK cells at the bone marrow level (881) (882) (883) . Eventually, these hormones induce a condition of osteopetrosis, with destruction of the bone marrow environment and complete suppression of NK cell maturation (415) . In some experimental conditions, however, 170-estradiol treatment induced an activation of NK cells for the first 30 days, followed by NK cell depression (884) . This early NK cellstimulating effect of 170-estradiol correlates with an estrogen-induced resistance to metastasis formation by B16 melanoma, an effect thought to be mediated by NK cells (884) . In vitro, 170-estradiol and diethylstilbestrol treatment of PBLs has been reported by some authors (885) (886) (887) to inhibit NK cell-mediated cytotoxicity, but not by others (888, 889) .",

A modest increase of NK cell activity in the uterus was also observed in 170-estradiol-induced pseudopregnancy, showing that hormonal regulation may play a role but not completely account for the sustained increase of NK cell activity in the decidua, which requires the presence of an embryo (891) . In the human early pregnancy decidua 75% of the cells obtained by enzymatic digestion are of bone marrow origin (893) . Immunohistological analysis showed that macrophages and CD3+, HLA-DR+ activated T cells predominate in the region, with prominent infiltration of the decidua by the trophoblast (894) . In the area of the endometrium in which trophoblast invasion is not prominent or where it is still associated with endometrial glands or spiral arteries, the predominant cell type is that previously defined as endometrial granulocytes (895) and consisting of CD2+, CD3-, CD5-, CD38+, NKH-l/Leu-19+, partly HLA-DR+ cells (890, 894) . These leukocytes tend to aggregate adjacent to degenerated endometrial glands or to spiral arteries (894) . These granular lymphocytes are absent from term decidua. Flow-cytometric analysis of enzymatically dissociated decidua cells showed that less than 10% of the cells were CD3+, on average 40% were NKH-l/Leu-19+, 30% were CD2+, 10% were CD16+, and over 50% were CD38+ (893) . Two-color analysis showed that the two major cell populations were NKH-1+, CD2+ and NKH-I+, CD2-, followed by CDl6+ cells (mostly expressing NKH-1/ Leu-19 antigen at low density) and CD3+ T cells (893) . Most of these cells have an LGL morphology. Thus, it appears that more than 50% of the decidua cells in the first trimester of pregnancy have a phenotype compatible with that of NK cells. Similar results have been reported in the mouse system, although the phenotype of the cell was not extensively characterized (892, 896) .",

Human placental trophoblast cells are almost completely resistant to NK cell-mediated cytotoxicity, but are sensitive to ADCC (873) . Lytic NK cells are absent from the decidua of beige mice and are reduced in the decidua of mice treated with anti-asialo-GM1 serum (892), although pregnancy progresses normally in these animals, suggesting that NK cells do not play an essential role for a successful pregnancy. However, those data do not exclude the presence of NK cells defective in cytotoxic potential in the decidua which could mediate noncytotoxic functions of NK cells. It is possible that NK cells affect placentation by modulating the maternal immune response in the decidua or by producing lymphokines, such as IFN-y, which have been shown to stimulate placental growth (898) . Alternatively, decidual NK cells, through cytotoxic effects or by releasing cytolytic factors such as TNF, could participate in the necrosis of endometrial tissue, facilitating the trophoblast invasion. The striking predominance of NK cells in the decidual cellular infiltrate and the activated characteristics of these cells suggested by the expression of HLA-DR and CD38 antigens cannot be easily discounted as findings with little relevance for successful implantation. The absence of CD16 antigen from most of the cells with NK cell phenotype in the decidua might also mean that these NK cells are highly activated. CD16 antigen is known to be down-modulated following interaction of NK cells with immune complexes (132) or under conditions in which protein kinase C is activated (133) . The high level expression of NKH-1/Leu-19 antigen on these cells is also an indicator of activation (100). Alternatively, the NKH-l/Leu-19+, CD16-NK cells may represent relatively immature NK cells that are generated by rapid proliferation of NK progenitor cells in the decidua or that have recently migrated from the bone marrow. Although there is no information on whether the NK cells in the decidua are cycling, the data suggest that the presence of an embryo induces an activation and localization of NK cells analogous to the localization observed at the site of virus infection (899). However, unlike during virus infection, systemic NK cell cytotoxic activity in early pregnancy is depressed and not stimulated.",

An alternative possible role of NK cells in the decidua is to suppress the immune response of the mother against the embryo. Decidua cells, especially at times of gestation later than those corresponding to the peak of NK cell activity, strongly suppress NK cell cytotoxic activity, as well as that of CTLs and ADCC effector cells (900, 901). Suppressor cells in the decidua also inhibit CTL generation. The suppressor cells have been identified as FcyR+ non-T cell type, that can, however, be distinguished from classical NK cells because of lack of reactivity with anti-asialo-GMl serum, slower sedimentation rate, and presence in the decidua of beige mice (902).",

Although the studies described above have suggested a relative resistance of trophoblastic cells to the lytic effect of NK cells, other studies have shown that embryonal carcinoma cells are sensitive to NK cellmediated cytotoxicity in vitro (530). It is therefore conceivable that if NK cell cytotoxic activity in the decidua is abnormally high, the trophoblast could be damaged. Indeed, some studies have suggested a direct correlation between NK cell activity and abortion rate. The NK cell activity of 50 women with threatened preterm delivery was found to be significantly higher than in 50 healthy pregnant women (903). In a murine model (CBA females X DBA/2J males) with a high spontaneous abortion rate, a significant correlation was found between NK cell infiltrates at 6-9 days and embryo abortion (904). In the same mouse model, poly I:C treatment was found to increase and anti-asialo-GMI serum treatment to decrease, the abortion rate in parallel with NK cell activity (905).",

Alterations of T and NK cells in the bone marrow can be quantitative (increased number or change in the proportion of different subsets) or qualitative (activation of the cells). Although T and NK cells can produce both stimulating and inhibiting factors, bone marrow failure in one or more lineages is the hematopoietic condition most often associated with lymphocyte activation (906). The presence of inhibitory lymphocytes may represent a primary autoimmune mechanism, or they may be generated as a reaction to a pathogenic stimulus, e.g., infection or malignancy, with a secondary effect on hematopoietic cells. In some patients, the clonal or malignant expansion of a lymphocyte population with inhibitory activity is responsible for the failure of other hematopoietic cells. Lymphocytes may act directly on progenitor or stem cells or affect other accessory cell types required for growth factor production. Inhibition by lymphocytes may require direct cellular contact or be mediated via soluble factors.",

            "text": "OF NK CELLS IN REGULATION OF HEMATOPOIESIS A role for NK cells in hematopoietic homeostasis was originally suggested by the pioneering studies by Cudkowicz and collaborators (361, 907, 908) on hybrid resistance to parental bone marrow transplantation in irradiated mice. Parental hematopoietic or lymphoid grafts do not survive in lethally irradiated F1 hybrids, even though these animals are universal recipients of grafts of other types of parental tissue (907) . The genetic control of hybrid resistance contrasts with the classical transplantation studies which show that graft compatibility rests predominantly on multiple genetic determinants of cellular antigens inherited codominantly: the histocompatibility (H) antigens. The F1 hybrid anti-parent reaction has been explained by assuming the existence of a class of noncodominant genes, designated Hh for hematopoietic (or hybrid) histocompatibility, with tissue distribution restricted to hematopoietic cells (907). By transplanting across allogeneic and xenogeneic barriers, using recipients in which the T cell response has been abrogated by irradiation, it was possible to demonstrate an Hhcontrolled allogeneic and xenogeneic resistance to hematopoietic cells that shares most of the properties of hybrid resistance (909). The characteristics of the effector cells mediating hybrid resistance (e.g., radioresistance, age of maturation, bone marrow dependence, thymus independence, sensitivity to split-dose irradiation, and lack of immunological memory) suggested their identity with NK cells (361, 908) . In the mouse both hybrid resistance and NK cell activity are under similar genetic control (374) and are abrogated in vzvo by treatment with antisera recognizing NK cells (910, 911); hybrid resistance is reduced in NKdeficient beige mice (912), and the ability to reject bone marrow in a genetically restricted way is adoptively transferred by clones with NK cell activity (913). However, the list of properties shared between the cells responsible for hybrid resistance and NK cells does not include the single most pertinent property of hematopoietic resistance, i.e., its immunogenetic specificity. The genetic restriction of natural hybrid resistance has been reproduced in an in vitro system in which purified murine F1 NK cells inhibit parental granulocyte-macrophage colony-forming units (CFU-GMs) (914), although a lower but significant suppression was also observed against syngeneic progenitor cells (914, 915) . The genetic specificity has been shown by in uivo experiments of competitive inhibition to reside at the effector cell level (916). A possible role of regulatory radioresistant T cells or of natural antibodies in determining genetic specificity of hybrid resistance has been proposed, but these models do not account for all properties of hybrid resistance (917).",

During the first week of infection, there is a profound suppression of spleen CFUs (CFU-Ss) and CFU -GMs (919, 920) . Erythropoiesis, as measured by 59Fe uptake into hematopoietic tissue, is also markedly suppressed. After day 10 of infection, CFU-S and erythropoiesis return to levels higher than normal in spleen, whereas hematopoiesis remains depressed for over 3 weeks in bone marrow. The in uiuo infection of mice with LCMV results in IFN production and increased NK cell activity in spleen and bone marrow (921), accompanied by the appearance of NK blasts and proliferation of NK cells (922). In the infected mice, NK cell activity and tissue distribution in the animals correlate with hematopoietic dysfunction (918) although the longlasting bone marrow defect cannot be completely explained by the effect of NK cells. NK cell activity is detected in the bone marrow during LCMV infection, suggesting that the depression of hematopoiesis at early times during infection might be attributed to NK cells (918). The NK cells in bone marrow have the antigenic phenotype of immature NK cells, suggesting that either increased local production or delayed migration of NK cells from bone marrow accounts for the increased cytotoxic activity (918). An adoptive transfer system was used to show that irradiated LCMVinfected mice reject syngeneic bone marrow and that this resistance is almost completely abolished by treatment with anti-asialo-GM1 antiserum, which abolishes NK cell activity (918) . These experimental observations in LCMV-infected mice demonstrated that in mu0 activated NK cells can suppress growth and proliferation of syngeneic hematopoietic progenitor cells and that this suppression can occur in organs, such as the bone marrow, in which NK cell-mediated cytotoxicity is normally low.",

In many cases the activated lymphocytes capable of hematopoietic suppression are T cells, mostly of the suppressor/cytotoxic CD8+ subset (924) , that express HLA-DR and CD25 activation antigens (925) . The identification of NK cells as responsible for bone marrow suppression in human pathology has been difficult because of the ambiguity of distinctive characteristics between NK cells and activated T cells. The LGL morphology, typical of resting NK cells, is often presented by activated T cells, especially CD8+ T cells. In several early studies antibody HNK-l/Leu-7 was used as a reagent for NK cells (146). The Leu-7 antigen is present in normal PBLs on a proportion of NK cells and in a small subset of T cells (95), and in patients with activated T cells a large proportion of Leu-7+ T cells is often observed. The low-affinity FcyR recognized by anti-CD16 antibodies (95) is also expressed on T cells from some patients. Cells bearing the receptor for SRBCs (CD2 antigen) and FcyR, often referred to as T y cells, in normal peripheral blood correspond to the NK cell subset (95). However, in several patients with bone marrow failure (e.g., EBV infection, pure RBC aplasia during chronic lymphocytic leukemia, and LGL lymphocytosis), CD2+ cells expressing FcyR and/or CD16 antigens have characteristics of T cells, i.e., they express the TCR and the TCR-associated CD3 antigen. Approximately 10% of the patients with LGL lymphocytosis present cells with CD3-, CD16+, CD2+, CD8+ or CD8-, high spontaneous cytotoxic activity, and no rearrangements in the X R genes (423, (430) (431) (432) .

Most of the in m'tro evidence for a role of NK cells in inhibiting hematopoiesis comes from experiments testing the ability of purified NK cell preparations to suppress proliferation and differentiation of CFUs. Several early studies suggested that human lymphocytes with some characteristics of NK cells (e.g., light density and expression of FcyR and E receptor) inhibit both autologous and allogeneic bone marrow CFUs, that the inhibition was enhanced by pretreatment of NK cells with IFN, and that NK cell-sensitive target cells competed for the inhibition (934) (935) (936) (937) . The inhibitor cells were resistant to 10 Gy irradiation but required several hours of contact with the bone marrow cells before plating in semisolid medium, in order to mediate maximum inhibition (936) . Bone marrow-derived CFU-GMs and erythrocyte CFUs (CFU-Es) are maximally inhibited by NK cells (668, [934] [935] [936] [937] [938] [939] , whereas inhibition of erythrocyte burst-forming units (BFU-Es) was observed in only one study (939) using HNK-l/Leu-7+ cells. Two studies have shown that peripheral blood-derived CFU-GMs are not inhibited, but rather are stimulated by NK cells (122, 940) .",

The suppressive effect of these cells was increased by pretreatment with IFN-a. Herrmann et al. (942) have recently analyzed the ability of human NK cell clones and CD3+ T cell clones with NK cell-like cytotoxic activity to suppress in mlro hematopoiesis. The NK cell clones did not promote hematopoietic colony growth, and individual NK cell clones suppressed subpopulations of progenitor cells in a heterogeneous but clonally stable manner. The generation of the inhibitory effect required cell-to-cell contact, and maximum inhibition was observed after 8-18 hours of preincubation.",

(668, 938) showed that purified NK cells produce colony-inhibiting activity (NK-CIA) when cocultured for several hours with NK-sensitive cells (such as K562 cells) or with allogeneic or autologous bone marrow cells, but not with NK-insensitive cells (such as Raji cells). HLA-DR+ bone marrow cells, highly enriched for hematopoietic progenitor cells, induce NK-CIA production, whereas HLA-DR-cells, depleted of precursor cells, fail to do so, suggesting that NK cells produce NK-CIA following direct interaction with the progenitor cells. The specificity of inhibition of hematopoietic colonies by NK-CIA and by NK cells was almost identical: Both inhibited CFU-GEMMs, CFU-Es, and CFU-GMs on day 14, but not BFU-Es or CFU-GMs day 7 (938) . NK-CIA was synergistic with IFN-y in inhibiting CFU-GMs on day 14; NK-CIA and IFN-y together but not separately, also inhibited CFU-GMs on day 7 (668). The NK-CIA concentration in the supernatant fluid was sufficient to account for the inhibition of colony formation observed when NK cells were added directly to the bone marrow cells used for colony formation, although the contribution of a direct cytotoxic effect of NK cells on progenitor cells to the observed inhibitory effect cannot be ruled out. NK-CIA-containing supernatants did not contain significant amounts of IFN-(x or -y, and the NK-CIA activity was not inhibited by antibodies to IFN (668). NK-CIA inhibition of colony formation was efficiently abolished by monoclonal antibodies to TNF but not lymphotoxin (LT) (668). The NK-CIA-containing supernatants have low (0.1-10 U/ml) TNF activity, as evaluated by biological assay (cytotoxicity on actinomycin D-treated mouse L cells) or by radioimmunoassay (260) . Such levels of TNF were sufficient to account for the observed inhibition of colony formation, as determined by using recombinant TNF (668, 950, 951) .",

The fact that homogeneous TNF but not supernatants from NK cells containing TNF inhibited BFU-E colonies is probably due to the fact that NK cells produce burst-promoting activity, masking the inhibition by TNF (945) . Both TNF and LT poorly inhibit CFU-GMs but strongly synergize with IFN-y in inhibiting this colony type (951) . When NK and T cells simultaneously produce IFN-y and TNF or LT, the ability of the supernatants to inhibit CFUs, because of this synergistic effect, might be almost completely abolished by anti-IFN-y, leading to the mistaken conclusion that IFN-y alone is responsible for the inhibition. In the study by Herrmann et al. (942) NK cell clones that produced both IFN-y and NK-CIA activity inhibited erythroid and myeloid colonies, including CFU-GMs on day 7. Anti-IFN-y monoclonal antibodies prevented the inhibition of CFU-GMs on day 7, but not of other colony types, suggesting that the inhibition was mediated by a factor (possibly TNF) acting synergistically with IFN-y.

Because progenitor cells in peripheral blood and in bone marrow are not qualitatively different, it is difficult to interpret the data showing that bone marrow CFUs but not peripheral blood CFUs are inhibited (122, 940) . However, it was recently shown that removal of NK cells from the peripheral blood of patients with P-thalassemia results in increased CFUs but that the effect of NK cell removal is abolished if adherent cells are removed (952) . These data suggest that the inhibition of CFUs mediated by NK cells in the peripheral blood of the patients requires interaction with adherent cells. It is possible that the HLA-DR+ cell population in bone marrow shown to induce NK-CIA/TNF formation by NK cells (938) contains a stromal or hematopoietic cell population in addition to precursor cells. This stromal/hematopoietic cell type, but not the precursor cells, could interact with NK cells and induce NK-CIA/TNF production. The absence of this accessory cell type from nonadherent preparations of peripheral blood mononuclear cells might explain the inability of NK cells to suppress CFUs from peripheral blood.",

(953) (954) (955) found an association between high pretransplantation NK cell activity in the recipient against HSV-1-infected target cells and incidence of GVHD after bone marrow transplantation. However, in other studies, no correlation was found with NK cell cytotoxic activity against K562 target cells (953, 956, 957) or, in one study (957) , against HSV-1-infected target cells. The failure to reproduce the original finding of an association between NK cell activity in the recipient and GVHD is probably due to the number of different factors that affect measurement of NK cell activity in mlro, making it impossible to use this activity as a clinical prognostic indicator of GVHD. However, the data of Lopez et al. (953) (954) (955) are in agreement with observations in experimental animals, as detailed below, and represent suggestive important evidence of a role for NK cells in both the inductive and effector phases of GVHD. Dokhelar et al. (467) reported further evidence supporting a role for NK cells in human GVHD by showing that the occurrence of acute GVHD was associated with an early appearance of maximal NK cell activity within 2-4 weeks of transplantation, whereas in patients without acute GVHD NK cell activity was restored later. More direct evidence of NK cell participation is represented by in situ analysis during GVHD of human rectal mucosa (958) and skin (959) , in which cells with immunohistochemical features of NK cells were detected. In the murine model of GVHD induced by bone marrow transplantation between strains differing only in the minor histocompatibility antigens, Guillen et al. (960) demonstrated that the preponderant mononuclear cells in GVHD lesional skin have phenotypic characteristics of NK cells. These cells have the morphology and ultrastructure of LGLs with typical vesicles and PTAs, express asialo-GM1, Thy-1, and CDllb (MAC-1) antigens, but are mostly Ly-1 and Ly-2 negative. Membrane association was observed between LGLs and degenerating keratinocytes, including apposition of cell membranes and invagination of elongated microvilli of mononuclear cells into adjacent degenerating keratinocytes (960) . On the basis of this association and a granule morphology suggesting discharge or dissolution of the granule contents, it has been postulated that the NK cells are directly cytotoxic for the keratinocytes (960) . However, it has recently been reported in a similar mouse model that anti-TNF antibodies in vivo completely prevent acute GVHD (961) . Because activated NK cells are powerful producers of TNF (78), it is possible that the tissue necrosis observed is mediated by TNF and not by NK cell-mediated cytotoxicity. Alternatively, TNF may act as an immune potentiating cytokine that enhances the cytotoxic/necrotic effect of NK cells and, possibly, of macrophages and neutrophils.",

In experimental animals (962) and possibly in humans (963) elimination of mature T cells from the bone marrow graft prevents GVHD. A role for transplantation antigen-specific T cells in the initiation of most cases of GVHD is certain. NK cells might be recruited by the products of T cells as effector cells, but they might also participate in the induction phase, providing necessary help for the T cell response (see Section X). Various experimental systems have been utilized to demonstrate the requirement of host or donor NK cells in GVHD. When + / b g (normal NK cell activity) or bg/bg (deficient NK cell activity) mice were used as the host or donor of bone marrow cells, early splenomegaly and moderate B cell suppression were observed in all of the combinations. However, + / b g but not bg/bg bone marrow cells were able to induce severe GVHD with histopathological lesions and profound B and T cell suppression in either bg/bg or + / b g recipients (964) . These results suggest that donor NK cells rather than host NK cells play an active role in GVHD-associated tissue damage and long-term immune suppression. Elimination of either asialo-GMl+ (965) or NK-1.1+ (966) cells from transplanted bone marrow did not prevent GVHD, indicating that mature donor NK cells were not required. However, when donor mice were stimulated with in vivo allogeneic immunization, maturation of a proportion of lymphocytes, possibly NK progenitors, from asialo-GM1-to asialo-GM1+ was observed (965) . When bone marrow from these immunized animals was used for transplantation, treatment of the animals with anti-asialo-GM1 serum before marrow harvest prevented GVHD in the recipients (965) . Thus, both mature and precursor NK cells in the bone marrow graft might generate GVHD.",

This helper function of NK cells might be present in the noncytotoxic NK cells from beige mice, as suggested by the development of GVHD in bg/bg mice transplanted with + / b g bone marrow (964) . Probably secondary to CTL activation, donor NK cells or NK progenitor cells are activated and induced to proliferate, generating the early and elevated reconstitution of NK cell activity after transplantation. These activated NK cells probably represent the effector cells of GVHD without antigenic specificity. The lack of antigenic specificity of this phase of the GVHD is elegantly demonstrated by experiments in which a graft of fetal intestine syngeneic with the bone marrow donor was implantad under the kidney capsule of mice undergoing GVHD (969). Although the intestine should not have been recognized by the anti-host CTLs, it was nonetheless rapidly infiltrated by lymphocytes and presented the same pathological aspects (e.g., villus atrophy and crypt hyperplasia) observed in the recipient intestine.",

During virus infection, an NK cell response, which usually peaks at 3 days postinfection, is followed by a CTL response, which peaks at 7-9 days postinfection (921). Mice acutely infected with LCMV are characterized by high levels of virus-induced IFN and NK cell activity in spleen, peritoneum, liver, lung, bone marrow, and peripheral blood (17, 899, 918, 921, 970, 971) . The increase in NK cell activity is due to an absolute increase in the number of NK cells, originating de novo from the bone marrow, as indicated by the prevention of activation of NK cells by HU treatment (922, 972) . NK cells in the infected mice have blast morphology, are of lighter density than are those in control mice, and are replicating, as shown by experiments combining single-cell cytotoxic assay and autoradiography using NK cells pulsed ~ith[~H]thymidine (972). Similar in vivo activation and proliferation of NK cells are observed when mice are treated with IFN or with IFNinducers such as poly I:C (734), suggesting that the effect of virus infection on NK cell blastogenesis in vivo is mediated through IFN induction.",

Production of chemotactic factors at sites of virus replication is at least partially responsible for NK cell or LGL accumulation at these sites, as suggested by the presence of in vitro chemotactic activity for NK cells and other cell types in the washout fluid from the peritoneal cavity of virus-infected animals (922).",

On the other hand, the severity of the encephalopathy induced in mice by intracerebral injection of influenza virus is significantly reduced by elimination of NK cells in vivo using anti-asialo-GM1 serum (978).

IFN production is a constant feature of virus infection and IFN renders tissue cells resistant to the lysis mediated by both resting and activated NK cells (34, 503, 570) . Because cells infected by most viruses are not protected against NK cells by IFN, due to the inhibition of host RNA and protein synthesis, IFN protection of normal but not infected target cells was proposed as a major mechanism by which NK cell cytotoxicity is directed toward virus-infected cells and spare uninfected cells (34, 569) . This theory predicted that NK cells would not be effective in mvo against viruses that do not shut off host RNA and protein synthesis during cell infection. Cells infected by such viruses would be protected by IFN and therefore not lysed by NK cells. The work of Welsh and collaborators (511, 570, 976, 982) has provided supportive evidence for this hypothesis by showing that (1) normal cells such as thymocytes are protected in vivo by IFN against NK cell cytotoxicity during LCMV infection and (2) infection of target cells with viruses sensitive to NK cells in vim, such as mouse CMV, prevents the protective effect of IFN, whereas LCMV does not.",

Original data that anti-asialo-GM1 serum suppresses resistance to HSV-1 infection (983) were challenged by the observation that the antiserum suppresses both NK cell activity and IFN production (984). The use of lower concentrations of anti-asialo-GM1 serum that were able to block NK cell activity but not IFN production failed to confirm a role of NK cells against HSV-1, and adoptive transfer experiments were also inconclusive in supporting a role for NK cells (984). More recently, however, adoptive transfer of purified NK-l.l+, asialo-GM1+ NK cells in cyclophosphamide-treated mice has been shown to induce protection against HSV-1 infection, providing direct evidence for a role of NK cells in protection against development of fatal infection in mice (985). These data also point to the need for caution in interpreting studies that fail to demonstrate a role for NK cells against other viruses. Several adaptive and nonadaptive mechanisms of resistance to virus infection are simultaneously active in the organism. When one mechanism fails or is suppressed, it seems reasonable to expect that other mechanisms might compensate, making it difficult to dissect the role of a particular mechanism. In this respect, it is interesting that the IFN titer in vivo in mouse CMV-infected mice is higher when NK cells are ablated by anti-asialo-GM1 serum treatment (976). Experimental evidence, even if not always conclusive, suggests a role for NK cells in the defense against infection by mouse hepatitis virus, vesicular stomatitis virus, influenza virus, togaviruses, retroviruses, poxviruses, and also nonenveloped viruses such as coxsackie B and encephalomyocarditis viruses (982).",

However, antibody-independent natural cytotoxicity was demonstrated on mumpsinfected target cells (997), an observation subsequently extended to target cells infected by a variety of viruses (34, 998, 999) , demonstrating that (1) sensitivity of virus-infected target cells to NK cell cytotoxicity was not significantly different from that of noninfected target cells, but infected cells induced activation of NK cells, resulting in increased killing of the infected (and uninfected bystander) target cells starting after 3-4 hours of culture, (2) activation of NK cell cytotoxicity was concomitant with the production of IFN-(r by the PBL preparations used as a source of NK cells, and (3) the IFN-(r released into the supernatant was able to stimulate the cytotoxic activity of fresh PBLs. These data served to identify IFN-(r as the major factor responsible for the enhanced NK cell cytotoxicity against virus-infected target cells.",

            "text": "An IFN-independent cytotoxic mechanism was described particularly for target cells infected with paramyxovirus and myxoviruses. Lysis against these target cells can be blocked by antibodies to viral glycoproteins, specifically hemagglutinin, and purified glycoproteins can activate the effector cells (999-1002). Antibodies to the glycoproteins do not block the cytotoxicity if added after the glycoproteins have activated the effector cells. This type of cytotoxicity has been defined as virus-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (VDCC) (1003) and has characteristics quite different from those of the NK cell-mediated lysis of virus-infected target cells. The increase in cytotoxicity is observed within 3-4 hours after the treatment of PBLs with glycoproteins, at a time in which NK cell-mediated killing of virus-infected target cells is usually not observed (1001). This type of killing is reminiscent of lectin-dependent cytotoxicity and both NK cells and CD3+ T cells are able to mediate VDCC and lectindependent killing (1004-1008). In other experimental models target cells infected by herpesviruses have been shown to be lysed mostly or exclusively by NK cells (510, 1009, 1010) . Interestingly, the nature of the infected target cells seems to indicate which type of effector cells is involved: mumps virus-infected Chang target cells were lysed only by CD3-effector cells, whereas mumps virus-infected T24 cells were lysed by both CD3-and CD3+ effector cells (1007). This observation may indicate different mechanisms of lysis that may or may not involve IFN. In the murine system HSV-l-infected YAC-1 cells are lysed by NK cells activated by a mechanism involving exclusively IFN activation, whereas HSV-l-infected WEHI-164 cells are lysed by NC cells that are not stimulated by IFN (1011). The possible involvement of NC cells is interesting because the cytotoxicity of NC cells is mostly mediated by TNF, and it was recently shown that NK cell clones can also lyse vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV)-infected target cells through the release of TNF It is difficult to evaluate the relative participation of VDCC and IFNmediated activation of NK cells in the cytotoxicity of PBLs against virus-(1012).",

Although the third observation can be easily explained by factors such as the variable response of PBLs of different donors to IFN stimulation, the characteristics of the dose-response curve for IFN-mediated NK cell activation, and the possibility of other mechanisms operating together with IFN, the underpinnings of the first two points are less obvious. The inability of anti-IFN antibodies to inhibit cytotoxicity might rest in the use of the antibodies at concentrations too low to efficiently inhibit, before NK cell activation, the high concentrations of IFN expected to be present in the intercellular space in the cell pellet. Also, both the antiviral and the NK cell-activating activities of IFN can be transferred directly from cell to cell, without secretion of IFN into medium containing anti -IFN antibodies (1020, 1021) . The ability of IFNstimulated NK cells to lyse virus-infected cells more efficiently than uninfected cells suggests that virus-infected target cells are intrinsically more sensitive to NK cells. These results have been reported by some laboratories (1016, 1018) , whereas others found a similar or lower lysis of infected versus uninfected target cells when optimally stimulated NK cells were used (79, 511-513) . The interpretation of these results is complicated by the facts that maximal activation of NK cells may not always be obtained, that IFN produced during an 18-hour cytotoxic assay further increases or at least maintains the cytotoxic activity of the IFN-treated PBLs, and that IFN, when added to the assay, protects the uninfected but not the infected target cells from lysis, mimicking the higher sensitivity of the virus-infected target cells.",

            "text": "Because the cells that produce IFN-a in cultures of PBLs and virusinfected target cells share some characteristics with NK cells, e.g., similar density on a Percoll gradient, it was proposed that NK cells produce IFN-a and therefore stimulate themselves with an autocrine mechanism (821). However, it was found that the major type of IFN-a-producing cells in response to CMV, HSV-1, and influenza virus infection is a lightdensity, nonadherent, HLA-DR+, non-NK, non-B, non-T cell type that represents no more than 1-2% of PBLs (92, 510, 827, 828). The lineage of this cell type is not known, but it can be clearly distinguished from monocyte/macrophages and from dendritic cells on the basis of antigenic and adherence characteristics (92; S. Bandyopadhyay, personal communication). The killing of virus-infected target cells, but not of K562 target cells, by CD16+, HLA-DR-NK cells has an absolute requirement for the IFN-a-producing HLA-DR+ cells (510, 1022, 1023). The HLA-DR+ cells in contact with virus-infected target cells produce a factor that activates NK cells, as shown by supernatant fluid transfer or by separating the HLA-DR+ cells and CD16+ NK cells by filters (510). In both cases the NK cell-activating activity is completely blocked by anti-IFN-a antibodies (510). The same antibodies do not prevent lysis of virus-infected cells by total PBLs (510), as was also described in other studies (1016, 1018) . However, anti-IFN-a antibodies efficiently inhibit cytotoxicity on virus-infected target cells when the cultures are rocked to reduce cellular interactions or when the number of HLA-DR+ cells in the culture, normally in large excess, is reduced to the minimal concentration required for efficient cytotoxicity (S. Bandyopadhyay, personal communication). These results strongly support the original hypothesis that activation of NK cells by IFN-a is the major and most efficient mechanism responsible for the enhanced lysis of virus-infected target cells by PBLs in vitro. However, other mechanisms, such as the direct interaction of NK cells with IFN-a-producing cells or with viral glycoproteins on the target cell surface are likely to play a role in the activation of NK cells.",

This bactericidal activity is mediated at least in part by an extracellular mechanism involving soluble factors (1034). Treatment of human lymphocytes in vitro with fixed Shigella or Salmonella bacteria induces activation of NK cells and production of both IFN-a and -y (1035-1037) . The cytotoxic NK cells generated have been shown to be Leu-19+ cells, most of which bear the CD16 antigen but not T cell antigens (1036, 1037) . The activation of NK cells is also observed using bacteria concentrations too low to induce IFN production, suggesting the possibility that the enhancement of cytotoxicity is due to a direct effect of the bacteria on NK cells and that it is not mediated by IFN (1036) . Elimination of CD16+ NK cells from the lymphocyte preparation almost completely eliminates the production of IFN (1037), suggesting that at least the IFN-y induced in PBL preparations by bacteria is produced by NK cells. Similar results indicating the production of IFN-y by NK cells have been obtained with murine NK cells induced by L. pneumophila (1038) . Bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) from Salmonella fails to induce IFN production or NK cell activation and inhibits NK cell stimulation by the fixed bacteria (1035, 1037) . However, LPS from Eschen'chia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, or human periodontal pathogens plays a central role in the activation of NK cells by these bacteria (1039, 1040) . LPS is internalized in NK cells and induces an increase in cytotoxic as well as phagocytic activities for opsonized bacteria. This functional effect is accompanied by morphological changes (e.g., dilatation of the intracellular membrane compartment, formation of tubuloreticular inclusions, and increase in acid phosphatase activity) that are reminiscent of those induced by IFN (1040) .",

Beige mice are less resistant to C. neoformans infection than are their normal heterozygous littermates (1047), and the ability of cyclophosphamide-treated mice to clear the fungus is restored by adoptive transfer of normal spleen cells but not by that of spleen cells treated with anti-asialo-GM1 serum (1048).

E-rosetting FcyR+ cells are now known to be almost exclusively CD2+, CD16+ NK cells. Lobo (1062) showed that non-E-rosetting FcyR+ cells, probably corresponding to the CD2-subset of NK cells, spontaneously enhanced PWM-induced B cell differentiation but suppressed it after interaction with immune complexes, providing the first experimental evidence that NK cells might have both enhancing and suppressive effects on B cell response. The effect of NK cells on PWM-induced B cell differentiation was attributed to an indirect effect of NK cells on helper T cells rather than to a direct effect on B cells (1061, 1063) . A murine NK cell clone was shown to inhibit B cell response both in Vivo and in Vitro (1064) . Although some studies have shown that B cells at different stages of activation are sensitive to the lytic effect of NK cells (1064) (1065) (1066) , this sensitivity has not always been confirmed (1067) and most evidence from different experimental systems suggests that B cell lysis by NK cells during an immune response is not a major mechanism by which NK cells modulate B cell response.",

Suppressor ability of NK cells [identified by HNK-VLeu-7 (1069) or CD16 (1070) expression] was shown to be activated by IFN-a, whereas a subset of suppressor T cells was activated by PWM (1069) . Within the CD8+ cells, CD8+, CDllb-T cells required the presence of CD4+, 2H4+ suppressor/inducer cells to suppress PWM-induced B cell differentiation, whereas CD8+, CDllb+ cells (mostly NK cells) did not require the inducer cell population and, unlike suppressor T cells, were enhanced in their suppressor effect by IL-2 (1071) . In addition to their suppressive action on PWM-induced B cell differentiation, human NK cells suppress ongoing Ig synthesis by in vivo activated B lymphoblasts secreting anti-tetanus toxoid antibodies (1069), by EBVinduced B cells (1070) , and by certain lymphoblastoid cell lines (1072), although they enhance Ig synthesis by other cell lines (1072) . These results suggest that NK cells can interact directly with B cells and modulate their activity. The possible involvement of at least some of the mechanisms of the lytic process in suppression of the B cell response by NK cells is suggested by the competitive effect of a low number of K562 target cells (1069) , by the ability of antibody 13.1 (anti-gp200) to inhibit both NK cell-mediated cytotoxicity and Ig synthesis suppression (1073) , and by the possible involvement in both mechanisms of the B cell TfR, as indicated by the reversal of the inhibitory effect in the presence of iron ions (1074) .",

Poly I:C or IFN treatments resulted in inhibition or termination of the IgM response (1081) and in activation of NK cells able to suppress B cell responses in vitro. The involvement of NK cells in the normal homeostasis of immunity was suggested by the fact that immunization itself induced NK cell activation with a peak at 2-3 days using T cell-independent antigens and at 4-5 days using T cell-dependent antigens (1081) . The suppressive effect of NK cells is not antigen specific and the immunized mice showed a generalized IgM hyporesponsiveness to unrelated antigens, corresponding to the peaks of NK cell activation induced by the primary immunization (1081). This hyporesponsiveness was abolished in mice in which NK cell activity was depressed by treatment with pristane, by growth of a transplantable fibrosarcoma, or by repeated injection of poly I:C (1081). The NK cells in this experimental model have been shown to act by suppressing the accessory capacity of dendritic cells exposed to antigens (1080) . This effect on dendritic cells and the suppressive effect of NK cells on the B cell response was shown to be mediated by Thy-1-NK cells but not by Thy-l+ NK cells (1082) .",

STUDIES OF EXPERIMENTAL ANIMALS In order for NK cells to play a role in the control of tumor growth, they require the ability to interact with and destroy syngeneic tumor cells or to indirectly activate other adaptive and nonadaptive mechanisms of antitumor resistance. The ability of NK cells to lyse syngeneic cells was proven using transformed cell lines as the target (56), but fresh tumor cells are almost insensitive to NK cell lysis. Studies in which NK cells were enriched and/or activated with IFN or IL-2 showed that allogeneic and autologous fresh tumor cells are sensitive to NK cell-mediated cytotoxicity (37, 79, 776). However, NK cells are not specifically cytotoxic for tumor or transformed cells, and normal cells, e.g., fibroblasts, may be as sensitive or more sensitive to NK cell lysis than are tumor cells (34, 56) . The in vivu existence of NK cytotoxic cells with a possible function in the surveillance against tumors suggests the importance of in mvu regulatory mechanisms to recruit and activate NK cells locally, in analogy with other nonadaptive mechanisms of defense of the organism (34).",

The experimental protocols used involved analysis of the correlation of NK cell activity and tumor resistance (373, 1106), the use of NK cell-deficient mice (e.g., beige mice) (1107, 1108) , or the use of experimental procedures able to enhance (e.g., treatment with IFN or IFN-inducing substances) (1109) (1110) (1111) or depress NK cell activity. The latter was achieved by the use of 89Sr (442), split-dose irradiation (453), anti-asialo-GM1 antiserum (222, 1112), anti-NK cell alloantisera (1113, 1114) , anti-NK-1.1 monoclonal antibodies (ills), and anti-IFN antisera (1116) . Altogether, these experiments have clearly shown that NK cells are effective in viko and can destroy tumor cells. Transplanted NK cellsensitive tumors and experimental tumor metastasis can be inhibited by NK cells. The direct role of NK cells in the prevention of metastasis formation was confirmed by reconstitution experiments in which formation of metastasis in NK cell-depleted animals was prevented by adoptive transfer of purified NK cells (1103, 1117) or cloned cell lines with NK activity (1118) . However, the evidence for an effective role of NK cells in resistance to spontaneously arising neoplastic cells is much less compelling (1119) .",

The experiments of in vivo clearance of intravenously injected tumor cells, especially when clearance from the lung is measured, mostly measure intravasal destruction of tumor cells, because NK cell-mediated effects are observed before appreciable extravasation of the tumor cells occurs starting at 4 hours (1120) . The demonstration that NK cells can eliminate tumor cells in the circulation does not exclude, however, the possibility that prevention of metastasis takes place also at the tissue level. An extravasal antimetastatic effect of NK cells in the lung and the liver was demonstrated using mice treated sequentially with MVE-2 and anti-asialo-GMl antiserum, which have increased NK cell activity in both the lung and the liver but depressed circulating NK cells. In these mice metastasis formation was suppressed, suggesting that organ-associated extravasal NK cell activity is a possible mechanism for the antimetastatic therapeutic effects of in vivo treatment with NK cell-activating substances (1121) .",

The major obstacle to these studies has been the high variability of NK cell number and activity among control healthy donors and the difficulty of a careful quantitation of the results. The difficulties in the quantitative evaluation of NK cell activity and the criteria to be used in order to obtain statistically interpretable data have been reviewed in Section 11. The data presented in most studies are the result of experiments that have been performed in a limited number of patients, lack appropriate healthy controls, and do not apply acceptable criteria of quantitation and standardization. The studies in which the phenotype of NK cells has been analyzed often failed to use appropriate reagents and, in most cases, the number of NK cells was expressed only as a proportion of total lymphocytes and not as an absolute concentration of cells. Many reports should therefore be considered anecdotal and do not add much to our knowledge of NK cell functions in Vivo. In patients with advanced cancer NK cell cytotoxic activity is usually depressed (1124-1128) ; this depression appears to be secondary to tumor invasion and due either to interaction of NK cells with tumor cells or to the presence of suppressor cells (746-749). Pross and Baines (1123) reported the analysis of data from the first 307 patients in a study of a total of 1600 randomly chosen cancer patients. The study was performed using monocyte-depleted PBLs in an overnight assay using K562 target cells and applying careful criteria of quantitation and standardization of the assay (53). Each donor was tested in repeated assays (median, 3). Randomly chosen control healthy donors, patients with no evidence of disease, and patients with local disease had comparable cytotoxic activity; patients with metastatic disease and, more so, patients with advanced metastases, displayed significantly lowered NK cell cytotoxic activity (1123). However, the actual differences (0.82 f 0.09 for advanced metastases versus 1.05 f 0.07 for patients with no evidence of disease) were not marked, and certainly were not as high as those reported by the same authors (1127) for patients with liver metastases or by others using, in most cases, unfractionated mononuclear cells (1124,  1125, 1128) .",

However, virtually no NK cell activity is found in malignant effusions or among tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (747, (1129) (1130) (1131) . The lack of NK cell activity at tumor sites could be due in part to an in situ inhibition of NK cell activity, because in some studies (1132) (1133) (1134) (1135) functional cytotoxic NK cells have been enriched from ascites fluid and tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes using Percoll gradient fractionation. Highly cytotoxic CD2+, CD3-, CD16+ cells have been grown in IL-2-containing medium from the ascitic fluid or pleural effusions of patients with advanced ovarian or metastatic breast cancer (11.36) . NK cell activity was demonstrated in breast tumor draining lymph nodes, whereas it was almost absent in normal lymph nodes (572) ; however, NK cell activity was suppressed in the lymph nodes more proximal to the tumor and/or with tumor infiltration (572) , indicating that both alteration of NK cell localization and in situ suppression takes place in cancer patients.",

The number of phenotypically identifiable NK cells is, however, normal in most patients and defects in the ability of patients' cells to produce IFN-a or to respond to IFN-a have been reported (1138, 1140) . The alteration in the bone marrow environment in these patients is probably responsible for deficient production/differentiation of NK cells, analogously to the situation in 176-estradiol-treated mice in which noncytotoxic NK-1.1 + NK precursor cells are found (210) . A depression of NK cell activity is also observed in patients with acute or chronic leukemia; B cell and myeloid chronic leukemia patients often present a significant proportion of cells with the CD3+, CD16+ phenotype and non-MHC-restricted cytotoxicity (1142, 1143) . Cells with this phenotype are rare or absent in healthy donors (135) . In patients with pure RBC aplasia associated with B cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia, CD3+, CD16+ cells have been shown to suppress RBC colony formation in metro and have been proposed to be responsible for the in mvo erythropoietic defect (1142, 1144; reviewed in Ref. 1145 ).",

Patients with genetic diseases such as CHS or X-LPD, with a primary and secondary depression of NK cell activity, respectively, have a high probability of developing an LPD. In these cases, the etiology of the disorder is probably viral and the role of NK cells may reflect their antiviral, rather than their antitumor, activity (C. Lopez, as quoted in Ref. 1146) . In familial melanoma, relatives of the patients, who have an increased risk of developing the tumors, also showed a depressed NK cell cytotoxic activity, suggesting a possible role of NK cells resistance to tumor growth (1147) . Unlike patients with other solid tumors, those with primary noninvasive melanoma have low NK cell activity (1147, 1148) . Strayer et al. (1149) reported NK cell cytotoxicity lower than controls in family members of patients with a higher incidence of tumors and observed that NK cell activity varied inversely with the number of family members with cancer. However, in another study of 155 women at high relative risk for breast cancer (1150) , no difference in NK cell activity was found compared to normal controls, with the exception of women with benign breast syndrome, who had slightly elevated NK cell cytotoxicity, possibly because of systemic hormonal changes. Because NK cell activity in healthy donors is variable and the disease itself affects NK cell activity, it is still unknown whether NK cells really have any role in tumor surveillance despite many years of investigation for a possible relationship between low versus high NK cell activity and the probability of developing primary tumors (1151) . Only when studies of an extremely large number of patients have been performed, using quantitative and standardized methods, will a possible significant correlation (or lack of correlation) between NK cell cytotoxic activity and tumor development be obtained.",

The recurrence of distant melanoma metastases has been found to be significantly lower in patients with high NK cell cytotoxicity than in those with low activity (1148) . Schantz et al. (1152) indicated a strong inverse correlation between high NK cell activity and formation of metastasis in patients with head and neck cancer. Pross (1146, 1153) , in a 14-year ongoing comparative study of NK cell activity and clinical course in patients with solid tumors, reported a definitive trend correlating high NK cell activity with increased survival time, but this did not quite reach significance (p < 0.06; n = 430). In those patients who have been tested multiple times while metastasis free and who subsequently develop metastasis, the correlation between average NK cell activity and time from diagnosis to metastasis was significant (p < 0.029; n = 91). By contrast, in patients who were disease free (as opposed to metastasis free) at the time of NK cell testing, NK cell activity had no prognostic significance (1147) .",

In this section, other pathological conditions in which NK cells might play a role or in which NK cells are functionally altered will be briefly reviewed.

Peripheral blood mononuclear cells from a high percentage of SLE patients have a reduced ability to produce IFN-a in vitro, but most patients have measurable circulating IFN-a, suggesting that the defect of NK cell activity might be secondary to continuous exposure to IFN-a in mvo (1155) . Because of the predominantly suppressive effect of NK cells on B cell activation, the defect in NK cell activity in these patients could favor the activation of B cells producing autoreactive antibodies. This possibility is supported by the observations in mice carrying the autosomal recessive lpr gene. These mice spontaneously develop an SLE-like syndrome, accompanied by profoundly decreased NK cell activity in spleen and peripheral blood (1156) but by elevated hepatic NK cell activity (1157) . The spontaneous decrease in NK cell activity in lpr mice was observed to be associated with an increased autologous plaque-forming B cell (APFC) response (1156) . The APFC response was diminished when NK cell activity was increased with poly I:C treatment, whereas ablation of NK cells with anti-asialo-GMl antisera before poly I:C treatment increased the APFC response (1156) . The massive T cell proliferation associated with autoimmune disease in Zpr mice was shown to be similarly regulated by NK cell activity. Neonatal thymectomy increased NK cell activity and retarded the development of lymphoproliferation and autoantibody formation, whereas thymectomized mice treated with antiasialo-GM1 antisera developed LPD and splenomegaly (1158) .",

In general, a depression of circulating NK cell activity was observed for up to 2 years following transplantation, but an increase in NK cell cytotoxicity was reported during rejection episodes (1168, 1169) . These alterations of NK cell cytotoxicity are probably secondary to the immunosuppressive therapy and to the response of the host adaptive immune system against the graft. In experimental animals cytotoxic NK cells have been shown to infiltrate sponge matrix grafts or kidney graft at an early time of rejection (peak at day 4) and to disappear at a later time, when CTLs appear (1170, 1171) . In Vivo treatment with anti-asialo-GM, antisera abrogated NK cell activity and delayed appearance of CTLs (1170): these results suggest that NK cells might directly participate in graft rejection and may act as accessory cells for CTL generation. There is, however, no evidence that NK cells are involved as effector cells in organ rejection following clinical transplantation (1172) .",

After binding to target cells, they fail to polarize tubulin (1176) and to release NKCF (1174) . In addition to the defect in the lytic mechanism, a selective depletion of lymphocytes with the phenotype of NK cells was observed among human immunodeficiency virus (H1V)-positive infected patients (1177) . The decrease in NK cells was both relative and absolute: the CD8+, CD16+, NKH-l/Leu-19+ subset of NK cells was much more decreased than was the CD8-, CD16+, NKH-l+ subset (1177) . Because no functional differences between the CD8+ and CD8-subsets of NK cells have been described, the significance of the selective depletion of one subset only is difficult to interpret.",

HIV antigens were expressed on infected cells after only 14 days of culture. At this time all CD4+ cells and most CD16+ cells expressed HIV antigens, suggesting that HIV might also have a tropism for NK cells (1178) . The possibility that HIV might infect NK cells directly is an interesting finding that deserves further investigation. PBLs from AIDS patients have a reduced expression of IFN-a, but not IFN-7, receptors (1179) . The down-modulation of the IFN-a receptor may be due to the continuous exposure to the circulating serum acidlabile IFN-a observed in the patients; continuous exposure to IFN-a might also be responsible for the inactivation of NK cell cytotoxicity. The peripheral blood mononuclear cells from AIDS patients are severely deficient, compared to cells from healthy individuals, in their ability to produce IFN-a in response to HSV-1-infected fibroblasts (1180) . The defect in IFN-a production has been reported to correlate with susceptibility to opportunistic infection better than the decrease in NK cell cytotoxicity (1180) . Thesa data suggest absence or a functional deficiency of the IFN-a-producing HLA-DRf cells, which are necessary accessory cells for NK cell cytotoxicity against virus-infected cells.",

These peptides inhibit lysis by interfering with postbinding lytic mechanisms (1181, 1182) .

However, the heterogeneity of the PTAs and the different proportions of LGLs containing PTAs reported by various authors may suggest that the PTA structure is unstable and may be affected by many different factors involved in the preparation of cells.

Ca2+ influx in the effector cells has been suggested on the basis of 45Ca uptake data (575, 603), although uptake by effector and target cells could not be distinguished by those experimental procedures. Recently, Windebank et al. (604), using liquorin-loaded NK cells, and we (M. Cassatella and G. Trinchieri, unpublished observations), using Fura-2-loaded NK cells, have shown that interaction of NK cells with target cells induces an increase in intracellular Ca2 + concentration ( [Ca2+]i) that is approximately proportional to the sensitivity of the target cell to lysis. The increase in [Ca2+]i upon interaction with the target cell depends on both the release of Ca2+ from intracellular stores and the uptake of extracellular Ca2+ (M. Cassatella and G. Trinchieri, unpublished observations). The stimulation of NK cell phosphoinositide metabolism by target cells has been shown to require extracellular Ca2+ in one study (602) but not in others (601; M. Cassatella and G. Trinchieri, unpublished observations). These contrasting results are not surprising because chelation of extracellular Ca2+, depending on the experimental conditions, may result in a slower depletion of [Ca2+]i, which eventually blocks phosphoinositide metabolism by preventing activation of the Ca2+-dependent phospholipase C. Cross-linking of the CD16 FcyR by antibodies, immune complexes, or IgG-coated target cells also induces formation of IP3 and IP4 that does not depend on the presence of extracellular Ca2+ (601; M. Cassatella and G. Trinchieri, unpublished observations) and an increase in [Ca2+]i (601).",

IFN treatment of NK cells induces 2 ',5 '-oligoadenylate (2 ',5 'A) synthetase and, under appropriate experimental conditions, 2 ',5 ' A augments NK cell cytotoxicity, suggesting that, as in the case of IFN antiviral activity, the pathway of IFN-mediated augmentation of NK cell cytotoxicity may involve 2',5'A (713, 714). However, although most species of recombinant IFN-a enhance NK cell cytotoxicity, recombinant IFN-a J, with potent antiviral and antiproliferative activity, fails to do so (715). IFN-a J binds to the same receptors as the other IFN-a and blocks the NK cell-activating effect of the other species of IFN-a (716). These results indicate possible differences in the mechanisms of action of IFN in inducing antiviral activity or augmenting NK cell cytotoxicity.In addition to IFN and IFN-inducing cells (such as virus-or mycoplasma-infected cells), other IFN inducers, such as viruses and polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid (poly I:C), also enhance NK cell activity by inducing IFN production by cells present in the cell preparations used as a source of NK cells (34, 591). The IFN-dependent enhancement of the cytotoxic activity of NK cells is very rapid and requires de novo protein synthesis but not cell proliferation (34). Although NK cells show increased cytotoxic activity after IFN treatment, they do not show a pattern of target cell specificity different from that of untreated ones. However, they can very efficiently kill target cells that are not very sensitive to the killing by untreated NK cells (34). The increase in killing ability as a result of IFN stimulation is proportionally greater against these less susceptible target cells than against very susceptible target cells: the number of cells lysed increases up to 20-fold in the former situation, whereas that of cells lysed when the NK-susceptible cell line K562 is used, for example, increases only 1.5-to twofold (591). IFN-treated NK cells are also able to lyse fresh tumor target cells, which are relatively resistant to lysis by nonstimulated NK cells (717). IFNs stimulate the cytotoxic activity of NK cells only and do not endow T or B cells with non-MHC-restricted cytotoxic activity (95, 272).IFNs have been shown to affect NK cell cytotoxicity through at least three different mechanisms: (1) by increasing both the number of NK cells able to bind to their targets and the proportion of cytotoxic cells within the NK cell population (59, 95, 502, 718-721), (2) by accelerating the kinetics of lysis (720, 721), and (3) by increasing the recycling ability of active NK",

The morphological aspect of IL-2activated NK cells is different from that of IFN-activated NK cells: The morphology of the IL-2-activated cells is altered, with expansion of the Golgi apparatus and increase in the number of electron-dense granules and vesicles; the granules, however, do not show the deaggregation of the electron-dense matrix observed in IFN-treated NK cells (281). IFN and IL-2 synergize in their enhancing effect on NK cell cytotoxicity (770, 771). Short-term treatment with IL-2 (up to 24 hours) enhances the cytotoxicity of purified CD3-, CD16+ NK cells and does not endow freshly obtained CD3+ cells with non-MHC-restricted cytotoxicity when tested against NK cell-sensitive or -resistant target cells (156, 708).",

Thus, NK cells have activity against C. neoformans but do not appear to play an essential role in the defense against infection in the normal host, although their activity might be required in the immune-compromised host, Candida albicans enhances NK cell activity (1050) and induces production of TNF from NK cells and monocytes (1051). However, NK cells do not kill C. albicans, although an excess of C. albicans blocks NK cell lysis of K562 cells (1052). NK cells may participate in the defense against C. albicans infection by secreting TNF, IFN-y, or other lymphokines that activate the fungicidal activity of neutrophils and macrophages (1053). Few studies have been published on the possible role of NK cells in the defense against protozoa. In mvo infection with Toxoplasma or Plasmodium is associated with increased NK cell activity (1054, 1055). A role for NK cells in the defense against these pathogens is suggested by the shorter survival time of Plasmodium berghei-infected beige mice than normal mice (1056), and by the ability of murine NK cells to lyse Toxophma gondii in Vitro (1057). NK cell activation in acute infection and depression in chronic infection has been demonstrated in mice infected with Leishmania (1058). Studies employing beige mice, split-dose irradiation, and adoptive transfer of an NK cell clone have suggested a possible role for NK cells in the clearance of Leishmania from spleen and liver (1059).",
