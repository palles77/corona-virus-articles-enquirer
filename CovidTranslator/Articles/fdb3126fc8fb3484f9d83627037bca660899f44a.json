            "text": "Viral infections are sensed by the host innate immune system through Toll-like receptors and retinoic acid-inducible gene-I-like receptors, which trigger innate immune signal transduction, leading to production of type I interferons (IFNs), and hundreds of proinflammatory cytokines that suppress viral spread (Kawai and Akira, 2008) . In return, viruses have evolved at least three mechanisms to evade or antagonize host innate immunity. One is blocking IFN induction. Host innate immunity is initiated by recognition of cellular RNA sensors and viral RNA, which in turn interacts with the adaptor IPS-1 to activate the IFN transcription factor IRF-3 and NF-kB through kinases TBK-1/IKKi and IKKa/b (Kawai and Akira, 2008) . Many viruses encode proteins to block the IFN induction pathway. Examples include the influenza A virus NS1 protein (Lu et al., 1995; Garcia-Sastre, 2001) , the reovirus sigma3 protein (Jacobs and Langland, 1998) , the Ebola virus VP35 protein (Cardenas et al., 2006) , the poxvirus E3L protein (Xiang et al., 2002) , the herpes simplex virus US11 protein (Poppers et al., 2000) and the murine cytomegalovirus m142 and m143 proteins (Valchanova et al., 2006) . The second mechanism is interfering with IFN-activated signaling, mainly through interacting with the Janus kinases JAK-1, TYK-2, STAT-1 and STAT-2 to block the JAK-STAT signaling pathway. Examples include the Ebola virus VP24 protein (Reid et al., 2006) , the paramyxovirus C and V proteins (Didcock et al., 1999; Gotoh et al., 2003) , and the rabies virus P protein (Brzozka et al., 2006) . The third method is inhibiting the specific antiviral proteins that mediate the antiviral state. Viral dsRNA-binding proteins are mostly studied for their capability of preventing activation of PKR or the 2-5 OAS/RNaseL system, as demonstrated by the reovirus sigma3 (Imani and Jacobs, 1988) , the herpesvirus US11 protein (Poppers et al., 2000) , the poxvirus E3L (Langland and Jacobs, 2004) , the cytomegaloviruses dsRNAbinding proteins (Hakki and Geballe, 2005) , and the influenza virus NS1 protein (Min and Krug, 2006) .",

The group II coronaviruses severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and mouse hepatitis coronavirus (MHV) encode a number of proteins that antagonize host innate immunity. The ORF 3b and ORF 6 proteins inhibit both IFN synthesis and signaling (Kopecky-Bromberg et al., 2007) . The nucleocapsid protein inhibits NFkB promoter and IFN synthesis (Kopecky-Bromberg et al., 2007; Ye et al., 2007) . The papain-like protease interacts with IRF-3 and inhibits its phosphorylation and nuclear translocation (Devaraj et al., 2007) . The 3a protein causes endoplasmic reticulum stress, and antagonizes IFN responses and innate immunity (Minakshi et al., 2009) . Finally, the M protein associates with RIG-I, TBK1, IKKepsilon, and TRAF3 to inhibit the activation of IRF-3/IRF-7",

A bioinformatic analysis revealed that the nsp1 proteins of group I and SARS coronaviruses have similar structures. Nsp1 proteins of group I coronaviruses interacted with host ribosomal 40S subunit and did not inhibit IRF-3 activation. However, synthesis of host immune and non-immune proteins was inhibited by nsp1 proteins at both transcriptional and translational levels, similar to SARS coronavirus nsp1. These results indicate that different coronaviruses might employ the same nsp1 mechanism to antagonize host innate immunity and cell proliferation. However, nsp1 may not be the key determinant of viral pathogenicity, or the factor used by the SARS coronavirus to evade host innate immunity.",

In contrast, SARS-CoV nsp1 suppressed promoter activity by only 3-5-folds by all assays (Fig. 4) . Titration of the released IFNb proteins in cell supernatant by ELISA revealed similar results.

Group I coronaviruses also encode nsp1 proteins of only about 110 amino acids, with relatively high conservation within the group, but with a high degree of polymorphism with SARS-CoV nsp1, which has 179 amino acids. However, the NMR analysis revealed that the segment from residue 13 to 128 of SARS-CoV nsp1 determined its core structure (Almeida et al., 2007) , and this corresponded to the overall length of the group I coronavirus nsp1 proteins. Therefore, we built models for the nsp1 proteins of HCoV-229E and HCoV-NL63, two low-pathogenic group I human coronaviruses, for comparison with nsp1 from the highly pathogenic SARS-CoV. Careful inspection of the sequence alignment showed that most of the structurally important hydrophobic residues are conserved or similar for nsp1 proteins from HCoV-229E, HCoV-NL63 and SARS-CoV. Computational modeling demonstrated overall similarity in the three-dimensional nsp1 structures from the two group I coronavirus and SARS-CoV.",

Recent studies revealed that SARS-CoV nsp1 suppresses host protein synthesis by interacting with the ribosomal 40S subunit (Kamitani et al., 2009) . In this study, we demonstrated that the group I coronavirus nsp1 proteins also bound to the ribosomal 40S subunit, as shown by co-IP. Further analysis showed that activation of IRF-3 was not affected, but synthesis of host immune and nonimmune proteins was potently suppressed by group I coronavirus nsp1 proteins. It seemed that synthesis of these proteins was more strongly inhibited at translational level than transcriptional level. These results indicate that group I coronaviruses have evolved a mechanism strikingly similar to SARS-CoV for antagonizing host cell proliferation and innate immunity using nsp1. Our results are in general consistent to that of Kamitani et al. (2006) , who firstly reported that SARS-CoV nsp1 inhibited IFN-b mRNA transcription and IFN-b promoter-driven luciferase protein synthesis. However, in our study, the inhibition of IFN-b mRNA transcription and luciferase protein synthesis was less strong than that reported by Kamitani et al. (2006) , most probably due to different expression levels of nsp1. In their study, the SARS-CoV nsp1 was driven by a chicken b-actin/rabbit b-globin hybrid promoter (AG promoter) in PCAGGS vector, which is known for its robust expression in eukaryote cells. In this study, nsp1 was driven by a CMV promoter, which was probably less efficient than the hybrid AG promoter.",

However, SARS-CoV infection appears highly pathogenic and causes severe pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome, characterized by the presence of diffuse alveolar damage (Weiss and Navas-Martin, 2005) . Surprisingly, few viral particles are isolated from lung tissues of SARS-CoV infected patients, but levels of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines are greatly elevated in the lung. A hyperinflammatory response is presumed to be the key determinant of the high pathogenicity of SARS-CoV, rather than rapid viral spread (De Lang et al., 2009) . The specific mechanism for SARS-CoV pathogenicity is not known, but a number of viral coding proteins may be involved (Weiss and Navas-Martin, 2005) . The nsp1 protein of SARS-CoV is defined as a major pathogenicity factor (Kamitani et al., 2006; Wathelet et al., 2007) . However, our results showed that the nsp1 proteins from low-pathogenic coronaviruses suppressed host protein synthesis more strongly than nsp1 from SARS-CoV, indicating that the nsp1 protein is actually a virulence factor for facilitating viral spread, but is not a major determinant in coronavirus pathogenicity. Although an engineered SARS-CoV with a mutated nsp1 was greatly attenuated in an animal model (Wathelet et al., 2007) , caution should be taken in developing this mutant virus as human vaccine because of the pathogenicity factors still present in the virion.",

This study clearly showed that the HCoV-229E and HCoV-NL63 nsp1 proteins also potently suppressed host innate immune protein synthesis like nsp1 from SARS-CoV, implying that group II coronaviruses do not employ nsp1 to evade host innate immunity.
