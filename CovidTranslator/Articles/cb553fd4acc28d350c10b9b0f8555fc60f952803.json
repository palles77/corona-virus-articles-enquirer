Few data have been published on unselected populations. The main aim of this study was to analyse symptomatic and asymptomatic respiratory viral infections during the first year of life in a cohort of infants, recruited at birth, and the development of recurrent wheezing. Patients and methods: A total of 302 newborns were recruited. A nasopharyngeal aspirate was taken when the patients had a respiratory infection, as well as in the visits for vaccination at 2, 4, 6, and 12 months. RT-nested PCR assays were performed to detect 16 viruses.",

Samples taken during routine check-ups were positive in 30.8% of cases, while those with respiratory infection were positive in 77.8%, P < .001 (OR: 3, 95% CI: 2.4---3.8). A total of 239 (79%) infants had at least 1 positive respiratory viral infection detected. The most frequent virus (71%) was rhinovirus (RV). Recurrent wheezing was found in 27 (11%) children during their first year of life (1.2 episodes, SD 2.9). Recurrent wheezing was present in 58.3% of patients admitted to hospital during their first viral infection, vs. 8.6% of infants when the first infection was mild or who had asymptomatic viral detection, P < .001 (OR: 2.18; 95% CI: 1.05---4.5).

            "text": "Acute respiratory infections (ARIs) are a major reason for health care use in infants and constitute a substantial economic burden. 1,2 Although infections in this age group are most frequently of a viral aetiology, 3,4 inappropriate antibiotic use continues to be widespread. Techniques based on the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) have made the aetiological diagnosis of ARIs possible in children, and made us aware of the high prevalence of asymptomatic viral infections. 5, 6 Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), human metapneumovirus (hMPV) and influenza virus (FLU) have been clearly identified as respiratory pathogens, and more recent studies have been analysing the role of other viruses such rhinovirus (RV) and human bocavirus (hBoV), although the high prevalence of coinfection with other respiratory viruses or their detection in asymptomatic patients pose challenges to the interpretation of these positive results. 7, 8 It is known that children with severe RSV infection that require hospitalisation are at high risk of developing asthma in the long term, even as late as age 18 years, as Sigurs et al. demonstrated. 9 There is also evidence of an increased risk of recurrent wheezing up to age 5 years in infants hospitalised due to bronchiolitis associated to hMPV. 10 There are fewer studies in children that have not been admitted to hospital, among which we would like to mention the classic studies by Stein et al., who analysed an unselected cohort and found that milder infections by RSV also increased the risk of developing wheezing. 11 In recent years, the role of RV as a long-term predictor of future asthma has also been investigated. A study of particular interest on the subject is that of Lemanske et al., 12 whose cohort of infants that had a RV infection with wheezing in the first year of life were at increased risk of having developed wheezing by age 3 years, with an odds ratio of 10. Most of the studies that assess the risk of developing asthma or wheezing have been conducted in selected high-risk populations. 13, 14 Furthermore, little is known about mild viral respiratory infections managed in outpatient settings in relation to the future development of wheezing, not to mention asymptomatic viral infections, although it is generally assumed that risk increases with increasing severity. The objective of our prospective study was to analyse asymptomatic and symptomatic infections of varying severity in a cohort of newborns during the first year of life and assess their role in the development of recurrent wheezing. Our secondary objective was to analyse the aetiology and clinical characteristics of these infections.",

Rhedin et al. detected respiratory viruses in 72.3% of cases (n = 151) and 35.4% of controls (n = 74) (P = .001). Rhinovirus was the virus identified most frequently in both cases and controls (47.9 and 21.5%, respectively). 6 Although infections by RV are common, a recent study that used nucleotide sequencing demonstrated that the prolonged presence of rhinovirus RNA in the respiratory tract following an upper respiratory tract infection is rare in healthy infants (<5%). In these infants, the detection of RV RNA in repeat samples at least 30 days apart most likely corresponded to new infections. 17 Another study found that the detection of the same virus strain more than 2 weeks apart was unusual. 18 In our study, we found that RV was detected in a significant proportion of infants that were classified as healthy (routine vaccination visit), probably because we did not take isolated rhinorrhoea into account, and this is a frequent symptom in children that does not contraindicate vaccination. However, it is possible that rhinorrhoea is actually a presenting symptom in mild RV infections. Unfortunately, we have no data on the percentage of infants considered healthy controls that had rhinorrhoea as the sole symptom. This is consistent with the hypothesis of Jartti et al. according to which RV always causes an actual infection, which may or may not be clinically relevant. 5 Although there are authors like Jansen et al., 19 who found a higher RV load in children with acute symptomatic infections compared to asymptomatic children, or Utokaparch et al., 20 who detected significantly higher RV loads in infections of the lower respiratory tract, there are others, like Takeyama et al., 21 who have not found a correlation between viral load and disease severity in RV infections. At any rate, the clinical significance of viral loads in respiratory samples is not well established, and we did not measure viral loads in our patients.",

Although they did not assess the severity of acute episodes, mild infections without wheezing were not associated with an increased risk of recurrent wheezing. These authors reached the conclusions we have reached based on our cohort, in which infections by RV or RSV that were sufficiently severe to cause bronchiolitis requiring hospital admission were a risk factor for developing wheezing as early as the first year of life. The followup of our cohort in the immediate future will allow us to learn whether the risk of wheezing continues to be higher in early childhood. As Lemanske et al. suggested, 12 the severity of infection is a risk factor for the development of asthma and recurrent wheezing. Various studies have demonstrated that severe bronchiolitis associated to RV infection increase the risk of asthma, but as we commented above, these studies were conducted in selected populations. 24---26 Our case series, which analysed symptomatic and asymptomatic infections and severity at an early age (less than 3 months in most first episodes) in an unselected population contributes a broader picture on the subject.",

We did not collect weekly samples to study viral shedding and its duration, and we also did not perform genotyping of RV. The duration of followup was short, and the number of patients with recurrent wheezing small. Nevertheless, we believe that the association found in the study is worth considering, and that we will be able to reach broader conclusions in upcoming years. Until then, we can state that respiratory infections in the first months of life that are severe enough to require hospitalisation are a risk factor for the development of recurrent wheezing.",
