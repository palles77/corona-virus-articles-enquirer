If the source of infection can be effectively controlled in the early stages of an outbreak, the spread of infectious diseases can be prevented. In view of this situation, this study developed for infectious or suspected infectious patients a negative pressure isolation hood which effectively achieves direct individual isolation during the early stages of disease outbreak, and facilitates long-distance transport. The hood body is made of flexible transparent polyvinyl chloride (PVC) material, and the combination of the hood material is airtight. The unique inflatable column support structure and the design of the inflatable neck sleeve effectively ensure both stiffness and air tightness of the hood body. The electrical exhaust system maintains a stable negative pressure environment inside the hood, and polluted air inside the hood can be purified by a high efficiency filter. Test results showed that the internal noise of the hood was 68 \u00b1 1 dB (A), the air exhaust volume of the electric exhaust system was not <200 L/min, and the filtration efficiency of the filter to 0.3 \u03bcm particles was >99.99%, indicating that the hood achieved effective isolation protection for patients with respiration infectious diseases.",

            "text": "In recent years, the outbreaks of respiratory infectious diseases caused by influenza A virus, Ebola virus and MERS-CoV Virus have caused widespread concern in the international community. Those infected with respiratory infectious diseases carry a large number of highly pathogenic respiratory microorganisms, and are moving sources of infection. Generally, pathogenic microorganisms are transmitted to the environment or individuals by means of respiration, speech, and contact, which can easily lead to concentrated infection in large-scale populations. The physical isolation of those infected with respiratory infectious disease is a simple and effective measure to control the source of infection and cut off the route of transmission [1] . The technical form of isolation is negative pressure isolation. The basic principle is to isolate infectious patients from the outside world through specialized ventilation and isolation devices though an artificial pressure barrier between the internal and external environment. The air discharged from ventilation must be purified to ensure no environmental harm [2] . According to the characteristics of the isolation equipment, they can be divided into fixed negative pressure isolation treatments and mobile negative pressure isolation transport. The negative pressure isolation ward [3, 4] can realize negative pressure isolation treatment of many respiratory infectious patients. The US Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) published the Technical Manual for the Prevention and isolation of Infectious Diseases in General Hospitals that provides a blueprint for the design of a negative pressure isolation ward [5] . Negative pressure ambulances [6] , and transfer cabins [7, 8] are classified as mobile negative pressure isolation transfer equipment that can safely transfer infected individuals to a hospital center or city hospital. After the outbreak of SARS in China in 2003, negative pressure isolation chambers and negative pressure ambulances were used to isolate and transport those infected, which effectively reduced the spread of the virus during transportation [9] . In 2014, the United States, Spain and France used negative pressure isolation cabins when transporting individuals infected with Ebola virus [8] . Negative pressure isolation transfer technology and equipment has thus emerged as an important means to control epidemic respiratory infectious diseases globally. The currently existing negative pressure isolation transfer cabin can carry one patient over a short distance using a stretcher and an associated vehicle, and is suitable for seriously infected patients who are unable to walk or sit. There are drawbacks to this type of isolation. Firstly, it is impossible to isolate patients for an extended time period and the psychophysiological burden and harm to a patient lying in the isolation transfer cabin can be serious. Secondly, for patients with mild symptoms who can walk freely, it is not necessary to maintain a consistent lying position. In addition, microorganisms are typically spread to the environment through respiration, coughing, speaking, and vomiting, which are concentrated above the chest. While whole body isolation provides increased safety, this significantly increases the burden of patients and causes difficulties during diagnosis and treatment.",

When testing the static pressure difference, the isolation hood was placed on a simulated individual and the inflatable sealing ring at the neck was filled.

The simulated respiration device was used to test the dynamic pressure differences with different tidal volumes and respiration times.

The electric exhaust system was placed in a sealing box with an opening at one end, so that the exhaust duct could be connected to the negative pressure isolation hood and ensure the seal where the exhaust duct was connected to the box. This ensured that the seal and exhaust duct were connected to the box. A round mouth was opened at the other end of the box to allow the test tube (diameter: 50 mm) to be inserted. The connector was sealed and the wind speed was assessed at the opening of the test tube. Five points at the cross-sectional area were measured on each occasion. Since the electric exhaust system was electric, it was assayed every 20 min until it automatically shut down. The low power alarm at the upper limit of the continuous working time was recorded. Loading and non-loading conditions were assessed. The respiration tube that was connected to the hood was removed, and the wind speed was measured at the mouth of the respiration tube. The air exhaust volume of the electrical exhaust system was calculated according to formulas (2) and (3). The specific method was to use an air multi-parameter tester to measure the wind speed at five points of the cross-sectional area of the respiratory tube.

The continuous and stable existence of pressure differences can form a stable air flow from the high pressure to the low pressure area, preventing the diffusion of harmful substances. During respiration, as long as the negative pressure is maintained, effective isolation and protection persist. In this study, a simulated respiration device was used to test the effects of different tidal volumes and respiratory frequencies on the internal pressure differences of the isolation hood. The fluctuation of pressure differences was assessed when the number of breaths per minute increased from 20 to 50 at a tidal volume of 1 and 1.5 L, and 2 and 2.5 L when the number of breaths increased from 20 to 30 (Figure 6 A-D) . Measurements of the pressure differences were performed for 10 min under each working condition, and the maximum/minimum and average values were calculated. As shown in Figure 6 , with increasing tidal volume, the fluctuation of pressure differences increased at the same number of breaths. When the tidal volume was lower than 2 L/min, the pressure inside the hood was negative. When the tidal volume exceeded 2 L/min, positive pressure was observed. When the tidal volume was constant, the fluctuation of pressure difference increased with accelerated respiratory frequency. We selected six workers to wear the headgear whilst completing four working conditions, including standing still and uniform respiration for 2 min, standing still and deep respiration for 2 min, walking and uniform respiration for 2 min, and walking and deep respiration for 2 min. As shown in Figure 7 and Table 2 , the pressure differences in the male hood were significantly larger under uniform respiration, and the fluctuation of pressure was significantly greater under deep respiration. Negative pressure in the hood was maintained at tidal volumes \u22641.5 L. The tidal volume of normal adults is~600-700 mL [13] . The hood therefore ensures the effective control of the outward diffusion of biological aerosols during use.",

The efficiency of individual masks is low, and provides limited protection. Negative pressure ambulances fail to overcome the issues of pathogenic microorganism diffusion in the process of patients moving from family, epidemic focus and complex environment to ambulance. Negative pressure isolation transfer capsules are effective in preventing the spread of pathogenic microorganisms during transport processes. However, the patients must lie flat and require specialized personnel and manpower to carry the infected individual. In addition, the patients bear a greater physical and psychological burden, leading to difficulties during treatment. In patients who can walk independently, local negative pressure isolation not only prevents the spread of pathogenic microorganisms, but enables those infected with a greater freedom of movement, permitting rapid and flexible isolation transport. In this study, we designed a local negative pressure isolation hood for patients with respiratory infectious disease, which provided a respiratory and craniofacial locally isolation environment for patients with mild symptoms or suspected infections. The system ensured that the pathogenic microorganisms exhaled by personnel were effectively intercepted, protecting the safety of health care personnel. The hood did not affect the movement of the user who required no additional assistance, thus reducing manpower.",
