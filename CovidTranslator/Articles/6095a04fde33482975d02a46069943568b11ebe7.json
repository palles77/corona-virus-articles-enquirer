            "text": "a b s t r a c t Viral infections activate many host signaling pathways, including the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt pathway, which has recently attracted considerable interest due to its central role in modulating virus replication. This study demonstrated that the sero-type 3 reovirus strain Masked Palm Civet/China/2004 (MPC/04) could transiently activate the PI3K/Akt pathway in A549 cells at earlier time points of infection. The blockage of PI3K/Akt activation increased viral RNA synthesis and yield. The role of the downstream effectors MDM2/p53 of PI3K/Akt in regulating reovirus replication was further analyzed. We found that during reovirus infection, the level of phosphorylated MDM2 (p-MDM2) was increased and the expression of p53 was reduced. In addition, the blockage of PI3K/Akt by Ly294002 or knockdown of Akt by siRNA reduced the level of p-MDM2 and increased the level of p53. Both indicated that the downstream effectors MDM2/p53 of PI3K/Akt were activated. Pre-treatment with Nutlin, which can destroy MDM2 and p53 cross-talk and increase the expression of p53 RNA and protein, dose-dependently enhanced reovirus replication. Additionally, the overexpression of p53 alone also supported reovirus replication, and knockdown of p53 significantly inhibited viral replication. This study demonstrates that PI3K/Akt/p53 activated by mammalian reovirus can serve as a pathway for inhibiting virus replication/infection, yet the precise mechanism of this process remains under further investigation.",

The mammalian orthoreoviruses (MRV) were first isolated from humans in 1951. These viruses commonly infected humans but are rarely pathogenic in adults (Tyler et al., 2004) . However, recent studies have demonstrated that reoviruses that spilled over from wild animals can cause acute and severe clinical disease in humans (Cheng et al., 2009; Chua et al., 2007 Chua et al., , 2008 Chua et al., , 2011 .

After infection, the level of phosphorylated MDM2 significantly increased from 6 to 24 h p.i. (Fig. 3A ) and recovered to the normal level at 32 p.i. Under non-stressed conditions, the MDM2 protein tightly regulates p53 via an autoregulatory feedback loop (Vassilev et al., 2004) . Phosphorylated MDM2 serves as an ubiquitin ligase that promotes p53 degradation (Vassilev et al., 2004) . Because reovirus infection increased the level of phosphorylated MDM2, the expression of p53 was inhibited from 6 h to 28 h p.i. (Fig. 3B) . To examine whether both p-MDM2 and p53 were regulated in a PI3K/Akt-dependent manner, cells pre-treated with the inhibitor LY or transfected with siRNA targeting Akt were infected with MPC/04, and the levels of both genes were analyzed at 12 h p.i. As expected, LY treatment (Fig. 3C ) or the knockdown of Akt (Fig. 3D ) decreased p-MDM2 expression and increased p53 expression compared with mock treatment. These results indicated that reovirus infection activated the PI3K/Akt/MDM2/p53 pathway.",

Since then, other viruses have also been detected or isolated from these two animal groups, including reoviruses (Du et al., 2010; Lelli et al., 2013) .

            "text": "The PI3K/Akt signaling pathway plays an important role in cell growth and survival. The PI3K/Akt pathway has been demonstrated to be involved in the replication of many viruses. The blockage of PI3K/Akt during infection with the ALV, vaccinia virus, and other viruses inhibits viral replication, but we observed that PI3K/Akt pathway activation antagonized rather than supported the virus. While the PI3K/Akt pathway is involved in the replication of many viruses, the precise molecular mechanism(s) by which PI3K/Akt regulates viral replication are not yet fully understood. In this study, we found that the downstream effector MDM2/p53 of PI3K/Akt was activated during reovirus infection, which inhibited p53 expression in cells. The up-regulation of p53 The relative expression of the viral S4 gene was analyzed by real-time PCR, (E) and the cell supernatants were harvested for an analysis of the virus titer (F). The data represent the results of three independent experiments. * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.001. Error bars indicate SD. using inhibitors or the overexpression of p53 in cells promoted reovirus replication, and the knockdown of p53 by siRNA inhibited reovirus replication. Studies demonstrated that type I interferons (IFN-a/b) regulate p53 transcription, and p53 also promotes the immune responses that lead to the inhibition of viral replication. However, the replication of both EMCV and HPIV3 was inhibited after the down-regulation of p53 (Marques et al., 2005) , which is consistent with our results. In our study, Nutlin treatment did not affect IFN-a/b expression (data not shown) suggesting that type I interferons did not play a role in regulating reovirus replication. The activation of PI3K, a heterodimer composed of a catalytic subunit p110 and an adaptor/regulatory subunit p85 (Ram and Ethier, 1996) , leads to Akt activation. Phosphorylated Akt inactivates several pro-apoptotic proteins, including GSK-3b, to promote cell survival (Cross et al., 1995) . Akt activation leads to MDM2 phosphorylation and then inhibits p53 transcription (Pan et al., 2011) , which results in cell survival. p53 accumulation significantly enhanced reovirus-induced apoptosis, virus release and dissemination (Pan et al., 2011) , which may be a key factor for increasing reovirus production. Another study from Zhe Liu's research group showed that the PI3K-Akt pathway facilitates hepatitis C virus entry (Liu et al., 2012) . A significant increase in p53 was observed 6 h p.i., indicating that p53 may play a role during viral replication. However, this does not necessarily rule out the possible role of the PI3K/Akt pathway and p53 in reovirus entry. Because the virus attachment and adsorption may be inhibited during the second wave of virus infection by activating the PI3K/Akt pathway and then reducing the p53 level. This could be a potential mechanism for p53 regulating reovirus infection.",
