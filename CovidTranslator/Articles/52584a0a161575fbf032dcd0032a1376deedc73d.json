            "text": "Broad-spectrum antiviral drugs are urgently needed to treat individuals infected with new and reemerging viruses, or with viruses that have developed resistance to antiviral therapies. Mammalian natural host defense peptides (mNHP) are short, usually cationic, peptides that have direct antimicrobial activity, and which in some instances activate cell-mediated antiviral immune responses. Although mNHP have potent activity in vitro, efficacy trials in vivo of exogenously provided mNHP have been largely disappointing, and no mNHP are currently licensed for human use. Mastoparan is an invertebrate host defense peptide that penetrates lipid bilayers, and we reasoned that a mastoparan analog might interact with the lipid component of virus membranes and thereby reduce infectivity of enveloped viruses. Our objective was to determine whether mastoparan-derived peptide MP7-NH 2 could inactivate viruses of multiple types, and whether it could stimulate cell-mediated antiviral activity. We found that MP7-NH 2 potently inactivated a range of enveloped viruses. Consistent with our proposed mechanism of action, MP7-NH 2 was not efficacious against a non-enveloped virus. Pre-treatment of cells with MP7-NH 2 did not reduce the amount of virus recovered after infection, which suggested that the primary mechanism of action in vitro was direct inactivation of virus by MP7-NH 2 . These results demonstrate for the first time that a mastoparan derivative has broad-spectrum antiviral activity in vitro and suggest that further investigation of the antiviral properties of mastoparan peptides in vivo is warranted.",

In the past decade, natural host defense peptides (NHP), which are produced by plants, invertebrates, and vertebrate animals, have emerged as a promising class of antimicrobials [45, 56] . Host defense peptides comprise a broad array of endogenous peptide antibiotics that are produced either constitutively [29] , or in response to wounding and mechanical stress [30] , inflammation [37] , or microbial infection [2, 20] . A significant advantage of NHP over other types of antimicrobials is that although resistance to NHP can be induced in vitro [39] and exists naturally in rare instances [50] , it occurs at rates that are orders of magnitude lower than that for conventional antimicrobials [58] .",

            "text": "We undertook the present study to determine whether a putative host defense peptide derived from the wasp peptide mastoparan had antiviral properties. Although the antibacterial and antifungal properties of invertebrate NHP have been well studied, only a small number of reports have ascribed antiviral activity to an invertebrate peptide [1, 31, 33, 52] . Mastoparan is a venom component, and may also contribute to acellular immune defense against pathogens in the same manner as the better characterized cecropins and attacins of other insects (reviewed in [9] ). Consistent with that idea, mastoparan induces exocytosis in hemocytes [5] which are the primary mediators of immune defense in invertebrates. In addition, a mastoparan-B isolated from hornet Vespa basalis restricted growth of various Gram positive and negative bacteria in vitro [57] . Finally, several molecular features of mastoparan peptides suggest that they might be effective antimicrobial agents. Mastoparan is unstructured in aqueous medium, but forms an amphipathic \u03b1-helix when in contact with lipids [23] . Perpendicular insertion of the mastoparan \u03b1-helix into the lipid membrane of synthetic vesicles loaded with dye transiently opens \"pores\", through which dye is released intermittently [4, 55] . Mastoparan also triggers mast cell degranulation in vitro [34] , and activates G-proteins [22] . Receptors for histamines, chemokines, and prostaglandins signal through heterotrimeric G proteins (reviewed in [12] ) and mastoparans would therefore be expected to have diverse effects on immune responses in vivo.",

To determine whether VSV that had been inactivated by MP7-NH 2 was pathogenic in vivo, we challenged groups of mice (n = 4-5 per group) intranasally with 10 6 PFU of a recombinant VSV expressing a model vaccine antigen (cowpox protein B5, CPXV B5) which either had or had not been pre-incubated for 30 min with MP7-NH 2 . Mice infected intranasally with live VSV display clinical signs of acute illness and can lose up to 20% of their pre-infection body weight in the first four days after challenge [40, 41] . As shown in Fig. 2A , mice infected with untreated VSV lost approximately 10% of their pre-infection body weight by the second day after challenge (open circles, Fig. 2A ) and did not fully regain their pre-infection weight until five days after challenge. In contrast, mice infected with VSV that had been pre-incubated with MP7-NH 2 (filled circles, Fig. 2A ), did not lose significantly more weight than mock-challenged control mice (P > 0.05, two-tailed Student T test) at any time during the study, and did not exhibit other clinical signs of illness. The difference in weight loss between the two VSV infected groups was significant on days 1-3 after infection (P < 0.05, two-tailed Student T test), with mice inoculated with MP7-NH 2 treated VSV losing significantly less weight than those inoculated with untreated virus. Those results supported the idea that VSV pre-incubated with MP7-NH 2 was non-infectious and could not replicate in vivo. As a second measure to detect residual infectivity in vivo, we used a binding ELISA to detect serum antibody reactive against the vaccine antigen (CPXV-B5) encoded by the VSV. CPXV-B5 was encoded in the viral RNA and is only produced as a result of virus replication; it was not present on the outer envelope of the VSV particles in the inoculum. Thus, if mice developed detectable immune responses to CPXV-B5, it could be inferred that some amount of infectious virus was present in the inoculum. As shown in Fig. 2B , mice infected with the MP7-NH 2 treated virus had significantly reduced antibody responses relative those receiving the untreated virus (P < 0.05 via unpaired T test Fig. 2B ) at all timepoints at which responses were measured. Two out of four of the mice infected with MP7-NH 2 treated VSV did not develop detectable antibodies at any of the time-points tested (Supplemental Fig. 1) . The other two mice in the MP7-NH 2 treated VSV group developed low titer anti-B5 Ab, which suggested that most but not all of the virions in the inoculum were inactivated by peptide pretreatment and were not capable of replication in an animal host. To test the idea that the inoculum likely had residual infectious virions we incubated the same number of VSV particles (10 6 ) as were used to infect the mice with 50 \u03bcM MP7-NH 2 in 500 \u03bcl total volume. After 30 min, we transferred the entire inoculum to a 10 cm plate of BHK cells and allowed the inoculum to adsorb for 30 min in 5 ml serum free media. We then added 5 ml complete media and allowed the infection to proceed overnight (total of 16 h). As shown in Fig. 2C , when we titered the supernatant collected from the cells we did detect infectious virus, albeit in significantly reduced amount vs. that produced when cells were infected with non-treated virus. This supported the idea that there was a small amount of infectious virus remaining in the inoculum used to infect the mice ( Fig. 2A and B) , and that that infectious virus gave rise to the immune responses observed.",

In these studies the peptide concentration was kept constant at 50 \u03bcM, the reaction volume was 500 \u03bcl, and peptide and virus were incubated at room temperature for 30 min. After the 30 min incubation residual infectivity was assayed via plaque assay (all viruses except for influenza, for which residual infectivity was determined by TCID 50 ) on an appropriate mammalian cell line as specified in the Methods. The limit of detection for infectious virus in all plaque assays was 50 PFU/ml and each experiment was conducted at least three times to confirm results. As shown in Table 1 , MP7-NH 2 was able to reduce or eliminate infectivity of eight out of ten enveloped viruses tested, but did not reduce infectivity of the non-enveloped aden-ovirus.",

We therefore hypothesized that MP7-NH 2 might be inactivating enveloped viruses by inserting into the virus envelope, thereby disrupting envelope structure and interfering with virus binding and/or fusion processes. To begin to test this idea, we used transmission electron microscopy (TEM) to examine the morphology of VSV virions after incubation with MP7-NH 2 . As shown in Fig. 3 , MP7-NH 2 treatment caused a significant disruption of virion structure. At low concentrations of peptide (10 \u03bcM), the envelope appeared to separate from the capsid but remain attached at either end of the virion (Fig. 3B and C) . At higher peptide concentrations (50 \u03bcM, Fig. 3D and E), peptide treatment caused complete dissociation of the envelope, leaving the naked capsid intact. In some cases, the viral particle was completely broken apart, and the viral RNA extended from the end of the disrupted virion. Although virus used for TEM analysis could not be directly assayed for infectivity, the morphological changes observed would be expected to render the virus non-infectious. These data supported our model, and confirmed that MP7-NH 2 could affect virion integrity in a cell-independent manner.",

One barrier to addressing this question directly was that mastoparan and mastoparan-derived peptides are cytotoxic at high concentrations [26] , in part because mastoparan triggers the release of pro-apoptotic mediators from mitochondria [18, 43, 54] . Because of this, we began by determining the maximum concentration of MP7-NH 2 that did not cause morphological changes or loss of viability in our cell line of interest (BHK-21 cells). As shown in Fig. 4A , incubation of BHK-21 cells with relatively high concentrations of MP7-NH 2 (\u226510 \u03bcM) caused rapid morphological changes such as blebbing of the plasma membrane and cell rounding in BHK cells that could be readily visualized by light microscopy. Incubation of cells with concentrations of MP7-NH 2 at or below 10 \u03bcM did not cause visible morphological changes even after 24 h of culture (data not shown). To confirm that lower concentrations of MP7-NH 2 were not causing toxicity not evident by visual inspection we performed an assay to measure mitochondrial activity. As shown in Fig. 4B , incubation of cells with MP7-NH 2 concentrations at or below 10 \u03bcM resulted in no significant difference in cell viability between treated and untreated samples, even when the cells were incubated with MP7-NH 2 for 24 h. This meant that we could pre-treat cells with concentrations of MP7-NH 2 \u2264 10 \u03bcM without compromising cell viability in our assays.",

Because the viruses inactivated by MP7-NH 2 do not share a common cellular receptor, do not enter the host cell by the same mechanism, and do not utilize the same type of nucleic acid as their genome (RNA vs. DNA), we reasoned that physical disruption of the envelope itself might be contributing to direct virus inactivation by MP7-NH 2 . Indeed, when we subjected MP-7 NH 2 treated VSV virions to electron microscopy, we found that the envelope had separated from the core of the virion, and in some cases had completely detached from the nucleocapsid. That result agreed with those of Howell et al., who reported that vaccinia virus treated with mammalian host defense peptide LL-37 had a perturbed envelope structure [25] .",

Our influenza virus stocks were grown in eggs, and one possibility was that trace amounts of allantoic fluid in the virus preparations could have inhibited the activity of MP7-NH 2 . However, when we added allantoic fluid to a direct-inactivation reaction with VSV and MP7-NH 2 , we did not observe any reduction in efficacy of MP7-NH 2 , which suggested that presence of allantoic fluid proteins was not a factor in the resistance of influenza to MP7-NH 2 mediated inactivation.",

For example, VSV and the flaviviruses have highly ordered envelope structures, in which the virus attachment and/or fusion proteins are anchored in regular patterns among the lipids of the virus envelope [15, 35] . By contrast, influenza and RSV virions are relatively more pleomorphic [6, 21] , with the attachment and fusion proteins assuming a less ordered array within the lipid bilayer. This plasticity might render flu and RSV more resistant to perturbations of the envelope structure; i.e. if insertion of the peptide altered the shape or curvature of the virion, attachment and fusion might still be possible.",

Unlike the other enveloped viruses tested, which have a single type of infectious particle surrounded by a single bilaminar envelope, poxviruses exist in four different infectious forms. Intracellular mature virions (IMV) account for the majority of infectious particles and have a single lipid envelope [24] . However intracellular enveloped virions (IEV) which are usually the second most numerous particle in laboratory preparations of virus, acquire additional envelope layers as they migrate toward the plasma membrane via the Golgi and/or endosome [38, 48] . Presumably the envelopes of IEV would be more difficult for MP7-NH 2 to penetrate and disrupt. Indeed, in the work of Howell et al. [25] , the disruption of the vaccinia virus envelope appears to be much less extensive than that observed here with MP7-NH 2 and VSV. Although those differences could be due to other factors, they are consistent with the idea that a more substantial envelope structure might render viruses more resistant to inactivation by peptides with this shared mode of action.",

Many other NHP have been shown to induce and/or enhance innate immune responses in the host. For example, pretreatment of cells with human defensin HNP-1 renders cells less permissive for viral replication by inducing expression of IFNresponsive gene Mx3, [19] , and by suppressing upregulation of cellular PKC [44] , which is required for influenza virus replication and nuclear trafficking [46] . In our hands, pretreatment of cells of three different lineages with MP7-NH 2 did not prevent infection of those cells with VSV, nor did it reduce the amount of virus produced by infected cells. One consideration in interpreting those results however is that our system in vitro used a single cell type in each culture. In the whole animal, where a range of cell types would be expected to respond to peptide treatment, indirect cell-mediated anti-viral activity might be induced by MP7-NH 2 . That prediction is supported by the results of King et al. who examined the immunological response to wasp venom and found that mice which were immunized with mastoparan and another venom protein had enhanced anti-venom IgE responses vs. those receiving venom protein alone [27] .",

Graph (Panel A) represents average percent initial weight \u00b1SEM for each group. Stars indicate timepoints at which the average weight for mice receiving untreated VSV was significantly lower (P \u2264 0.05, two-tailed T test) than the average weight of mice receiving MP7-NH 2 treated VSV. Panel B shows serum antibody titers by group at 7, 14, and 28 days after infection as measured by ELISA with recombinant CPXV-B5 protein as the coating antigen. Bars on graph represent the geometric mean titer for each immunization group, with error bars denoting the upper and lower limit of the 95% confidence interval. Titers were significantly lower in mice immunized with peptide treated vs. untreated virus at all three timepoints (P = 0.005 at day 7, P = 0.0143 at day 14, and P = 0.045 at day 28, via unpaired T test). This study was performed twice with consistent results. (Panel C) 10 6 PFU of VSV was incubated with 50 \u03bcM MP7-NH 2 at room temperature for 30 min. After 30 min the whole inoculum was plated on BHK cells and allowed to grow overnight (in a total volume of 10 ml). The amount of virus in the cell culture supernatants after 16 hrs was determined by plaque assay. Graph shows the total number of infectious virions detected in the supernatants and represents the average \u00b1SEM of three experiments performed independently. MP7-NH 2 treatment disrupts envelope structure of VSV. Virions were treated with MP7-NH 2 at the indicated concentrations for 30\u2032 before negative staining and TEM. Untreated VSV virions had a typical \"bullet\" morphology in which the virus core was surrounded by an intact envelope (panel A, filled arrowhead). The envelope of virions treated with 10 \u03bcM MP7-NH 2 was disrupted and separated from the virus core (Panels B and C, filled arrows). The envelope of virions treated with 50 \u03bcM MP7-NH 2 was completely dissociated from the core and in many cases the envelope aggregated at one end of the core (Panels D and E, empty arrows). Images shown are from two independent experiments. Pretreatment of cells with MP7-NH 2 does not significantly reduce the amount of viral progeny released by infected cells. 1 \u00d7 10 5 of the indicated cell type were either pretreated with 5 \u03bcM MP7-NH 2 for 1 h (filled circles) or incubated in serum-free medium without peptide (open circles) in a total volume of 1 ml. After the 1 h incubation the media was removed, cells were washed 3\u00d7, and infected with 10 5 PFU VSV (MOI 1) in SF-DMEM. After 1 h the inoculum was removed and replaced with DMEM-5%FBS. Supernatants were collected after 6 h and titered via plaque assay on BHK-21 cells to measure the amount of virus released. Graphs show the results of three independent studies for each cell line. The difference in the amount of virus released by the treated vs. untreated cells was not significantly different for any of the three cell types tested.",
