To evaluate the frequency of RV, nasal washes were collected year-round from BMT recipients with symptoms of upper respiratory tract infection (URI). Direct immunofluorescence assay was performed for respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), influenza (Flu) A and B, adenovirus and parainfluenza (Paraflu) virus. Patients with RSV pneumonia or with upper RSV infection, but considered at high risk for developing RSV pneumonia received aerosolized ribavirin. Oseltamivir was given to patients with influenza. A total of 179 patients had 392 episodes of URI. In all, 68 (38%) tested positive: RSV was detected in 18 patients (26.4%), Flu B in 17 (25%), Flu A in 11 (16.2%) and Paraflu in 7 (10.3%). A total of 14 patients (20.6%) had multiple RV infections or coinfection. RSV pneumonia developed in 55.5% of the patients with RSV-URI. One of the 15 patients (6.6%) with RSV pneumonia died. Influenza pneumonia was diagnosed in three patients (7.3%). RSV and influenza infections peaked in fall-winter and winter-spring months, respectively. We observed decreased rates of influenza and parainfluenza pneumonia and low mortality because of RSV pneumonia. The role of antiviral interventions such as aerosolized ribavirin and new neuraminidase inhibitors remains to be defined in randomized trials.",

The incidence of influenza A and B, parainfluenza 1, 2 and 3, and rhinovirus varies among different BMT centers and also between seasons, oscillating from 10 to 20%. Adenovirus and coronavirus infections occur less frequently, the former without the sharp seasonality observed for other respiratory viruses. [1] [2] [3] Bone marrow transplant (BMT) recipients with upper respiratory RSV infection have an estimated 50% risk of developing RSV pneumonia, and mortality rates ranging from 50 to 80% have been described. 1, 3, 4 Patients who acquire RSV infection before engraftment are at higher risk of pneumonia. 3, 5 Influenza and parainfluenza upper respiratory infections also have a great risk of progression to pneumonia, but data varies greatly among centers and authors. 1, 6, 7 Thus, incidences as high as 70% or as low as 17% of influenza and parainfluenza pneumonias have been described. 1, 6 The seasonality of RVI in the southern hemisphere countries has been shown to present a different pattern as compared to the northern hemisphere regions. Thus, in some subtropical areas of Brazil, influenza viruses can cause outbreaks throughout the year. 8 This information is relevant to establish the policies of influenza control in the southern hemisphere countries, such as the definition of the best time to start annual influenza vaccination.",

This seasonal distribution is similar to what is observed in the US 1,3,16 and somewhat different from Europe, where RSV has its peak during winter-spring months. An interesting observation concerns a few cases of influenza A and B seen in summer months, as previously observed by other authors in healthy children of Rio de Janeiro. 8 This finding raises a question about 'seasonal' influenza vaccination restricted to the autumn. BMT recipients not eligible to receive flu vaccine (those within the first 6 months after BMT) during seasonal vaccination will continue 'at risk' of acquiring influenza until the next season according to the current recommendations. These patients would probably benefit of influenza vaccination at any period of the year.",

No patient with parainfluenza upper respiratory infection and only three of the 41 patients (7.3%) with influenza A or B infection developed pneumonia. Previous studies have reported parainfluenza pneumonia rates ranging from 17 to 41.2% 1,3,7,15 and influenza pneumonia rates ranging from 9.5 to 75%. 3, 6, 7, 23 Two interventions could be responsible for the low rates of influenza complications observed in the present study. First, influenza vaccination and second, antiviral therapy. Influenza vaccine is poorly immunogenic within the first 6 months of transplantation and is therefore not considered to be recommended during this period. The patients' influenza vaccination data were not evaluated in the present study, but only 12 of the 41 patients (29.3%) acquired the infection after the 6 month of BMT and could have received influenza vaccine. Therefore, we could argue that oseltamivir, introduced early in the course of the infection (up to 48 h from initial symptoms), may have played a role in preventing influenza complications in the remaining 70% of the patients who certainly did not receive influenza vaccine.",

In all, 21 of them (77.7%) were allogeneic BMT recipients. The median time for the occurrence of upper RSV infection was 25 days (day \u00c05 to day +1947) after transplantation and the mean duration of virus excretion was 6 days (ranging from 4 to 30 days). Two patients had recurrent RSV infection within a 4-and 8-month interval between episodes, respectively. A total of 12 patients (44.4%) had only upper RSV infection and 15 patients (55.5%) developed RSV pneumonia(Table 3). All patients with RSV pneumonia were allogeneic BMT recipients and five of them (33.3%) acquired RSV pneumonia during the preengraftment period. The median time for the development of pneumonia was 20 days (days -5 to + 150) after BMT. Aerosolized ribavirin was administered to 16 of the 27 patients with RSV infection. According to the protocol, five patients with upper RSV infection considered at risk for developing pneumonia and 11 of the 15 patients with established RSV pneumonia were treated. Three of the remaining four patients with pneumonia improved before ribavirin administration and were not treated.",
