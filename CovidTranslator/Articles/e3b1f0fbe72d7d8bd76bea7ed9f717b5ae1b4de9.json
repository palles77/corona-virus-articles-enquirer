She reviewed the returned comments and modified the items when necessary. Direct discussions with experts were used when clarification of returned information was needed. A few rounds were held until the consensus was achieved. Next, the investigator drafted the competency items from the literature based on the agreed competency categories. The drafted competency items were transformed into a questionnaire. The experts were then asked whether they agreed or disagreed with the listed items.

The functional rating scale of the questionnaire ensured the quality of data collected. 16 To promote the quality of infection control service, it is important to equip ICNs in Hong Kong with reliable and valid training and assessment. Core competency is the major component for the development. The result of this study builds the foundation on this future direction.",
