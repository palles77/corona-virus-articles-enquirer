            "text": "Gastroenteritis of viral origin has emerged as a major cause of morbidity and mortality in dogs during the last two decades. Amongst the viral etiologies responsible for gastroenteritis in dogs, canine parvovirus (CPV) is considered as the most pathogenic. The disease is characterized by hemorrhagic enteritis, bloody diarrhoea and myocarditis in young pups. The present study was carried out to examine alterations in oxidative stress indices in the erythrocytes from dogs suffering from gastroenteritis with or without canine parvoviral infection as confirmed by CPV-DNA amplification from faeces using specific primers for CPV-2 as well as CPV-2a and CPV-2b variants by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The present investigation utilized clinical cases of dogs with signs of acute diarrhea (n = 56), and 14 more apparently healthy dogs of similar age group. Erythrocytic oxidative stress indices such as lipid peroxides level and antioxidant enzymes like superoxide dismutase and catalase activity, and blood micro-mineral (iron, copper, cobalt and zinc) status were analyzed in each dog (n = 70). The acute cases of gastroenteritis in dogs were associated with altered erythrocytic lipid peroxidation as evident by estimation of malonaldehyde (MDA) concentration. The activities of antioxidant enzymes catalase and superoxide dismutase, the first line of antioxidant defense against damaging effects of free radicals, were also altered. The alterations in oxidative stress indices were more pronounced in cases with involvement of canine parvovirus as compared to parvo-negative cases. Our results also revealed decreased blood zinc level in diarrhoea in dogs irrespective of involvement of canine parvovirus.",

Symptomatic treatment is resorted to in case of parvoviral disease in dogs to reduce mortality in the absence of efficacious antiviral therapies for very specific treatment. Therapeutic efficacy of a recombinant feline interferon (type omega) preparation has also been evaluated, and such treatment provided better therapeutic results (Martin et al., 2002; de Mari et al., 2003) .",

Oxidative stress was also reported to be involved in pathogenesis of several infections in dogs such as Babesia gibsoni, (Murase et al., 1996) , Leishmaniasis (Bildik et al., 2004) , and in concomitant infection with Babesis and Ehrlichia (Kumar et al., 2006) .

Zinc and copper are the co-factors of many antioxidant enzymes, and are utilized for synthesis of antioxidant enzyme Cu-Zn Superoxide dismutase which catalyses conversion of superoxide radicals to less oxidizing H 2 O 2 (Halliwell, 1994) . Previous studies have shown that humans infected with HIV have deficiencies of trace minerals like selenium, and vitamin D (Cirelli et al., 1991; Simba et al., 1993) and inclusion of antioxidant with antiviral agent have been reported to have beneficial effects (Palamara et al, 1996) .

Catalase activity was estimated in RBC hemolysate as per the method of Cohen et al. (1970) . The haemoglobin in the RBC haemolysate was estimated spectro-photometrically by the cyanomethaemoglobin method (Vankampen and Ziglstra, 1961) and the MDA level and activity of antioxidant enzymes were expressed as mg \u00c01 of haemoglobin.",

In the present study, the majority of the dogs (52 out of 56) were unvaccinated and such vaccination trends are not uncommon (Houston et al., 1996) . The parvoviral involvement was recorded in 59% of cases with the signs of diarrhoea/ vomition and such cases had a higher clinical score as compared to diarrhoea without parvovirus being diagnosed in faecal samples. In the present investigation, dogs aged between one and 12 months were recruited for the study as the incidence of parvoviral gastroenteritis has been reported to be the highest in puppies between weaning and 6 month of age (Houston et al., 1996) .",

Participation of iron in Fenton reaction in vivo leads to production of more reactive hydroxyl radicals from superoxide radicals and H 2 O 2 (Halliwell, 1994) and results in increased lipid peroxidation.

Both increased and decreased levels have been reported in different diseases as a consequence of enhanced ROS production either by up-regulation of enzyme activity or utilization of the antioxidant enzymes to counter the ROS. In the present investigation, a state of up-regulation of synthesis and activity of antioxidant enzymes in moderately affected dogs and a state of un-compensatory oxidative damage in severely affected dogs was observed. Altered status of antioxidant enzymes was documented in viral diseases like dengue haemorrhagic fever (Gil et al., 2004) and viral influenza (Oda et al., 1989) . Increased SOD and catalase activity in the present investigation might be due to enhanced synthesis of antioxidant enzymes in moderately severe cases of gastroenteritis as in-built compensatory mechanism. Increased oxidative stress indices in dogs have been reported in other infections such as Hepatozoon canis (Kiral et al., 2005) , Lieshmania (Bildik et al., 2004) and in undifferentiated diarrhea in other Table 4 Clinical score, plasma electrolytes profile and blood micro-minerals in different groups of dogs grouped based on parvoviral involvement in gastroenteritis animal species (Ranjan et al., 2006 ). There appears to have no report on oxidative stress indices in dogs due to viral infections to compare with the present findings. Oxidative stress indices did not show statistical (P > 0.05) variation when the dogs are grouped as male or female, irrespective of etiology, breed, age, or clinical score of gastroenteritis. However, Ide et al. (2002) reported that oxidative stress is greater in males than in females due to greater generation of ROS and reduced antioxidant activity. Houston et al. (1996) reported that male dogs >6 month of age are at higher risk of developing parvoviral enteritis but both male and female young dogs <6 month of are equally susceptible and this might be the reason that there was no difference in oxidative stress indices in male and female pups.",

Cells of the immune system require an adequate supply of trace elements for the structure and function of metalloproteins that participate in normal maintenance processes like protection of the cells against highly toxic reactive oxygen species (e.g. copper for superoxide dismutase and iron for catalase) (Munoz et al., 2007) . Significantly increased level of blood copper was observed in dogs suffering from gastroenteritis irrespective of presence of canine parvovirus. Increased level of copper in the blood of affected animals might be due to increased inflammatory response as copper is an integral part of protein ceruloplasmin and its level rises in acute phase response. A decreased level of blood iron and copper in the severely affected group might be due to loss of blood as many dogs in the severely affected group had blood in their stool.",

Significantly low level of blood zinc and increase in blood copper level were observed in dog suffering from diarrhea irrespective of presence of canine parvovirus. There are reports indicating significant effect of oral zinc supplementation on morbidity in acute diarrhea in children (Sazawal et al., 1997; Wingertzahn et al., 2003) . In past few years there are several reports supporting the hypothesis that host micronutrient status may contribute towards disease pathogenesis and emergence of new virulent strains of viruses (Beck et al., 2004) and nutritionally compromised hosts are more susceptible to viral infection (Beck and Levander, 1998) . Khoo et al, (2005) showed that animals on high antioxidant foods had significantly increased titers and memory cells during canine parvovirus and canine distemper virus vaccination.",
