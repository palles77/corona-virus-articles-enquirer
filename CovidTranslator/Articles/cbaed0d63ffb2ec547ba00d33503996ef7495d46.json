The objective of the study was to define the causative agents among children hospitalized for CAP defined by WHO guidelines and to correlate etiology with clinical severity and surrogate markers. Investigations included an extensive etiological workup. A potential causative agent was detected in 86% of the 99 enrolled patients, with evidence of bacterial (53%), viral (67%), and mixed (33%) infections. Streptococcus pneumoniae was accounted for in 46% of CAP. Dehydration was the only clinical sign associated with bacterial pneumonia. CRP and PCT were significantly higher in bacterial infections. Increasing the number of diagnostic tests identifies potential causes of CAP in up to 86% of children, indicating a high prevalence of viruses and frequent co-infections. The high proportion of pneumococcal infections re-emphasizes the importance of pneumococcal immunization.",

The World Health Organization (WHO) has defined pneumonia and subsequent treatment on strict clinical signs (Table 1) [1, 7, 17] . A prospective study showed that the WHO guidelines can also be applied in developed countries, as recommended by the guidelines of the British Thoracic Society (BTS) [2, 11] . The second difficulty is to identify the causative agent of pneumonia in children. This remains challenging for a number of reasons: endo-tracheal aspirates cannot be obtained routinely, nasopharyngeal swabs (NS) only show colonization by normal flora including the bacteria most commonly causing pneumonia, and bacteremia is demonstrated in less than 10% of bacterial CAP. Therefore, the etiology of CAP remains often unknown, with the consequence that many children get an antibiotic treatment for non-bacterial infections, contributing to the increase of bacterial resistance to antibiotics [9, 41] . The aims of this study, performed before the routine implementation of the heptavalent pneumococcal vaccine in Switzerland, were to define, as strictly as possible, the causative agents of pneumonia among children aged from 2 months to 5 years hospitalized for CAP on the basis of WHO clinical criteria, and to determine which factors could help clinicians to discriminate bacterial from viral pneumonia.",

They were classified according to initial severity. Children with actively treated asthma, an underlying chronic disease, immunosuppression, or wheezing were excluded. Children with wheezing were specifically excluded because wheezing is considered to be a symptom of asthma and/or viral bronchiolitis and not of pneumonia, and therefore these children are not treated with antibiotics. Cough and fever, associated signs and symptoms, the use of antibiotics in the month before admission, and the main features of the clinical course were recorded.

Paired samples were tested in the same run. Acute infection was defined by a fourfold rise or a titer higher than 1/80. Serologic tests for C. pneumoniae were done by using a micro-immunofluorescence test (MRL Diagnostics). A fourfold rise between the acute and convalescent sera or an initial titer higher than fourfold the positive cut off value (1:16) were considered as indicative of a recent infection, as previously described [26] . Serum IgG antibodies to pneumolysin were measured by indirect ELISA on antigen-coated Immulon plates (Thermo Labsystem), following 60 min incubation at 37\u00b0C. Results were compared to a pool of purified human immunoglobulins (Endobulin, Baxter) used as standard and expressed in ELISA Units/ml. Samples with a rise greater than twofold between acute or convalescent sera and/or acute serum antibody titers greater than 300 EU/ml were scored positive. These limits have been previously demonstrated to be a reliable method for the serological diagnosis of pneumococcal exposure [22, 35] .",

Evidence of bacterial infection was demonstrated in 53% of patients. S. pneumoniae was documented in 45% of the cases, corroborating previous reports such as the one by Michelow et al. [32] . A virus was found in 67% of the children. In 33% of the cases, a concurrent bacterial and viral infection was found. Antibiotic treatment before hospitalization doesn't seem to be a factor of misdiagnosis. Our study showed that in children fulfilling the WHO clinical definition of pneumonia and severity criteria, diagnosis was confirmed by radiological consolidation in 78% of cases. The poor agreement between auscultation and radiological consolidation confirms the poor sensitivity and specificity of auscultation to diagnose pneumonia in young children [11] . As previously described [14, 28] chest X-ray and blood cultures were not helpful in discriminating etiological categories of pneumonia. Duration of hospitalization was correlated with clinical severity essentially because WHO criteria define children with stage III pneumonia as requiring oxygen supplementation. Pain was the only clinical sign significantly associated with bacterial pneumonia. Acute-phase surrogate markers such as CRP and PCT, were significantly higher in bacterial infection regardless of the presence or absence of co-infecting viruses, corroborating several previous analyses [20, 33, 37] even if these findings are controversial in recent literature [13] . Further analysis is needed to determine the exact utility of these tests, as the sensibility and specificity with a bacterial cut off level were quite low. Finally, our data could not show a significant correlation between clinical severity and etiology of pneumonia [24] .",

The viruses most commonly found were rhinovirus (30%) and hMPV (20%), confirming the recent findings that these viruses frequently involved in pediatric CAP [3, 11, 36, 38] . RSV was less represented than in other reports [6] , probably because all patients with typical bronchiolitis were strictly excluded. Several points still have to be elucidated: whether viruses are the direct cause of pneumonia, whether they The main limitation to our study is the lack of validation and standardization of all microbiological cut off values, especially those concerning S. pneumoniae [4] . One of the major obstacles to improve the understanding of CAP is probably that we are still underdiagnosing pneumococcal and possibly other bacterial pneumonia. The use of a single antigen (pneumolysin) for the serological diagnosis of pneumococcal pneumonia may be a limitation, as well as the difficulty, in our study, to obtain convalescent serum samples (available for only 73% of the children). Therefore, it remains difficult to distinguish a real acquired infection from a recent colonization. As recently described by Nakayama et al. [34] , the use of PCR to detect bacterial pneumonia could be a useful additional diagnostic method. However, the fact that 46% of young children with CAP requiring hospitalization demonstrated evidence of an acute pneumococcal infection, is in accordance with the demonstrated impact of pneumococcal immunization [10, 18, 29, 30] . Finally, our results do not support the hypothesis that clinical severity depends on the causal agent. However, for ethical and practical reasons we chose to study only hospitalized children. Therefore, we have a limited number of patients with stage I pneumonia whom we usually treat in the ambulatory setting. A further study should include this group in order to confirm, with a greater number of patients, the non-association between clinical severity at admission and etiology.",

            "text": "In conclusion, this study used strict WHO clinical criteria to select suitable subjects to undergo an extensive microbiological etiological workup using a complete set of modern diagnostic tools. Our data confirm a high prevalence of viruses and the frequent occurrence of co-infection in childhood CAP. Dehydration and surrogate markers of inflammation such as CRP and PCT were significantly higher in children with bacterial pneumonia. Therefore, further analyses should be performed in order to find out which children should be treated with antibiotics and in which children antibiotics could be withheld safely. The high proportion of S. pneumoniae in severe CAP reemphasized the importance of pneumococcal immunization and antibiotics for treatment of CAP in young children. Other studies should also be performed to evaluate the epidemiology of moderate to severe bacterial pneumonia after introduction of pneumococcal immunization.",
