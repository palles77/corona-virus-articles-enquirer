Tr1 cells can be differentiated from na\u00efve CD4 + T cells upon TCR engagement in the 69 presence of IL-27 in vitro [28] , and in order to identify and obtain viable Tr1 cells for clinical 70 application, co-expression of LAG3 and CD49b has been recently proposed to be cell surface 71 signature of the Foxp3 -IL-10 high Tr1 cells [15] .

LAG3 is highly expressed by IL-10 + CD4 + T 73 cells [31] , as well as by activated effector T cells [32] and Foxp3 + Treg cells [33] . CD49b is the \uf0612 74 integrin subunit, highly expressed by NK cells [34] . CD49b is up-regulated in T cells that may 75 produce IL-10 and/or pro-inflammatory cytokines [35; 36; 37] . In addition to Foxp3 -Tr1 cells, IL-76 10 can be highly up-regulated in activated Foxp3 + Treg and CD8 + T cells under inflammatory 77 conditions and/or upon TCR activation. Given the importance of being able to identify Foxp3 -Tr1 78 cells, including under clinical conditions, and to gain a better understanding of the specificity of 79 co-expression of LAG3 and CD49b as a cell surface signature for IL-10-producing cells, we 80 sought to determine whether co-expression of LAG3 and CD49b can mark broader range of T 81 cell subsets that are actively producing high levels of IL-10. 82 Using a murine model carrying an IL-10 GFP /Foxp3 RFP dual reporter system, we find that 83 co-expression of LAG3 and CD49b is a generic feature of the IL-10-producing Foxp3 -CD4 + , 84",

Indeed, co-expression of LAG3 and CD49b may not be able to mark all IL-10-306 producing Tr1-like cells, but may serve to help eliminate those T cells lineages that are not 307 capable of producing IL-10 for potential clinical interest.

IL-10 has been reported as a product of activation of multiple immune cell lineages. 54 Innate immune cells including dendritic cells (DCs) [7], macrophages [8], neutrophils [9] and 55 innate lymphoid cells (ILCs) [10] have been reported to express IL-10 in vivo and in vitro. IL-10 is 56 also expressed by many subsets of the adaptive immune cells, including B cells [11] and T cells 57 including the Foxp3 -CD4 + [12], Foxp3 + Treg [13] and CD8 + T cell subsets [14]. Regulatory T cells 58 are defined by their immunosuppressive function, and the three aforementioned subsets of IL-10-59 producing T cells have been reported as phenotypically distinct regulatory T cell subsets, playing 60 important roles in promoting immune tolerance and/or suppressing inflammation in both mouse 61 and human [15; 16; 17; 18; 19; 20]. 62 Among the IL-10-producing T cells, the Foxp3 -CD4 + T cell subset, also known as type 1 63 regulatory T cells (Tr1 cells), are inducible in the periphery and have a pivotal role in limiting 64 inflammation [15; 21; 22; 23]. Tr1 cells have been shown to prevent allergic asthma [24] and 65 atopic dermatitis [25] in murine models. In both mouse models and humans, induction of tolerance 66 via specific antigen immunotherapy (SIT) is accompanied by induction of Tr1 cells [26; 27]. 67",

Therefore, it is more likely that LAG3 and CD49b signaling 326 pathways function cooperatively to activate the expression of IL-10. This hypothesis is more 327 reasonable, given our data that LAG3 and CD49b co-expression is a generic feature of IL-10 328 producing cells in multiple subsets. LAG3 is a structural homology of CD4 molecule, and can bind 329 to MHC class II in higher affinity than CD4 [29; 30]. In unstimulated T cells, LAG3 is retained in 330 the intracellular compartment and degraded in the lysosome; upon T cell activation, LAG3 traffics 331 from the lysosomal compartment to the cell surface through a protein kinase C (PKC) dependent 332 pathway [50]. CD49b is the integrin \uf0612 subunit and plays a critical role in cell-cell interaction and 333 cell-surface adhesion [51]. The CD49b pathway activates multiple downstream effector signaling 334 pathways, among which there is the RAS/MAPK signaling cascade [52; 53]. We recently reported 335 that the RAS/MAPK signaling pathway functioning downstream of the TCR is indispensable for 336 IL-10 production by Foxp3 -CD4 + cells, through activation of the expression of the transcription 337 factor interferon regulatory factor 4 (IRF4) [40]. PKC can regulate RAS signaling to downstream 338",

Factors that may affect the different composition of 358 the IL-10 high LAG3 + CD49b + T cells may include the type of immune response, abundance and 359 affinity of the TCR ligands, the cytokines induced and orchestrated by the stimuli, and the 360 nutritional microenvironments that favor different subsets of the T cells. For example, type I IFN 361 can facilitate the preferential induction of IL-10-producing effector CD8 + T cells thorough inducing 362 and sustaining expression of the IRF4 and Blimp1 transcription factors [56]. Type I interferon is 363 significantly elevated during influenza infection [57] but much less so by HDM exposure [58]. factors and their interacting molecular networks that exhibit differential 367 functions for IL-10 induction in different T cell lineages might provide an answer as well. For 368 example, Blimp-1 is indispensable for IL-10 induction in Foxp3 + and Foxp3 -CD4 + T cells [62; 63], 369 as well as in CD8 + T cells [64]. AhR interaction with cMAF is critical in IL-10 induction in Foxp3 -370 Tr1 cells in response to IL-27-supplemented environment, but is insufficient in inducing IL-10 371 production in Foxp3 + Treg cells under the same conditions [43]; AhR expression was not critical 372",
