Interestingly, the addition of DOPS scores to small-scale OSCE scores [small-scale OSCE+DOPS-composited scores] increased it's correlation with 360-degree evaluation scores of PGY 1 residents (r \u00bc 0.72, p < 0.036). Further, combination of IM-ITE \u00d2 score with small-scale OSCE\u00feDOPS scores [small-scale OSCE\u00feDOPS\u00feIM-ITE \u00d2 -composited scores] markedly enhanced their correlation with 360-degree evaluation scores (r \u00bc 0.85, p < 0.016). Conclusion: The strong correlations between 360-degree evaluation and small-scale OSCE\u00feDOPS\u00feIM-ITE \u00d2 -composited scores suggested that both methods were measuring the same quality. Our results showed that the small-scale OSCE, when associated with both the DOPS and IM-ITE \u00d2 , could be an important assessment method for PGY 1 residents.",

            "text": "The outbreak of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) epidemic that occurred during 2003 exposed serious deficiencies in Taiwan , s medical care and public healthcare systems, as well as its medical education system. The Department of Health, Executive Yuan of Taiwan, R.O.C., has had no efforts in promoting its \"Project of Reforming Taiwan , s Medical Care and Public Healthcare System\" since the spread of SARS was controlled. The reform of the medical care system aims to provide holistic medical treatment to people. Its strategies and methods include strengthening the improvement of resident education and quality of medical care. A project titled \"Post-graduate General Medical Training Program\" was announced by the Department of Health in August 2003. The evaluation of internal medicine first-year post-graduate (PGY 1 ) residents usually consists of the Objective Structured Clinical Examination (OSCE) because it combines reliability with validity by using multiple testing in a standardized set of appropriate clinical scenarios in a practical and efficient format. 1 The multiple-choice Internal Medicine in Training Examination (IM-ITE \u00d2 ) is a written test that is believed to be an alternative to performance testing such as the test by OSCE. 2, 3 The reliability of the IM-ITE \u00d2 is known to be good, with less testing time required. 2 The IM-ITE \u00d2 , covering knowledge in physical examination, laboratory, technical, and communication skills, is relatively cheap and easier to administer compared with an OSCE. 4, 5 However, a paper-andpencil knowledge test will overemphasize the cognitive aspects of clinical skills if the test does not require a resident to actually demonstrate these skills. Direct observation of procedural skills (DOPS) involves direct observation of a resident performing a variety of technical skills. 6 A combination of the OSCE with the IM-ITE \u00d2 and DOPS could bypass individual undesirable effects of each method and increase the completeness of assessment. 5, 7, 8 High-stakes, large scale-OSCEs are used to assess clinical competence at the performance level of a \"show how\" method based on Miller , s competency pyramid. 9 The format of the OSCE is designed with a circuit of multiple stations in which the candidates accomplish specific tasks within a required time period. 9e11 Replacing some OSCE stations with a written test might save resources and increase overall test reliability. 4 It could offer an adequate compromise between the demands of reliability and feasibility. In post-graduate curriculum, designing a mixed-method assessment is often advised. 12 Additionally, different content, multiple assessors, and a sufficient assessment time seem to be the fundamentals of a reliable assessment in clinical rotations. The 360-degree evaluation (multisource feedback) assesses general aspects of competence, including communication skills, clinical abilities, medical knowledge, technical skills, and teaching abilities of PGY 1 residents. 13 In general, different evaluation tools, including high-stakes, large-scale OSCE, DOPS, IM-ITE \u00d2 , and 360degree evaluations have their own particular roles in the assessment of learning outcomes. Thus, the purpose of our study was to determine the reliability of using a small-scale OSCE combined with other tools (DOPS and IM-ITE \u00d2 ) or a 360-degree evaluation to thoroughly evaluate PGY 1 residents.",

The OSCE consisted of six clinical problems that were made up of six core competencies defined by the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education [ACGME (Appendices 1 and 2)]. The content of each clinical problem consisted of physical examination skills, interpersonal skills, technical skills, problem-solving abilities, decision-making abilities, and patient treatment skills. 14 The examination took place simultaneously at two different sites. At each site, there were two sessions, and the raters at each station changed between the two sessions. Thus, for each station, there were a total of four different raters during the test day. The smallscale OSCE had neither written a component nor a technical skills station, but it was entirely performance-based. At some stations, standardized patients were used to mimic the clinical problems of actual patients. A faculty rater graded each PGY 1 resident according to a given set of 10e12 predetermined items presented in the form of a checklist. The score of checklists included items with a dichotomous scoring, yes/no, and an overall trichotomous scoring of pass/borderline/fail. All faculty raters attended serial training sessions that included extensive instruction on how to use the checklist in practice rating sessions. At each OSCE station, the raters acted as passive evaluators and were instructed not to guide or prompt the PGY 1 residents. The summary score of each station was the sum of all the checklist items. The residents' performance score for each OSCE station was obtained by calculating the percentage of checklist items he or she obtained. The OSCE was performed before the training (OSCE before ) and at the end of 3 months of training program (OSCE 3rd month ). Finally, average OSCE scores were calculated by averaging the three monthly scores for further analysis.",

Experts and senior physicians were provided with an identical checklist for the four technical skills before the test day and were asked to familiarize themselves with the checklist. In addition, they received a 30-minute orientation session just before examination. The DOPS checklist included items on communication skills, technical performance, and some theoretical questions, including knowledge of the indications, contraindications, potential complications, and different routes for the procedure that related to the task. 16 All of these items were developed from the 11 domains of the DOPS in presented Appendix 3.

Thus, the 360-degree evaluation scores also help residents develop an action plan and improve their behavior as part of their training. In our study, we used 360-degree evaluation scores as a standard to assess the efficiency of different methods, or a combination of them in evaluating the performance of all PGY 1 residents. Nevertheless, the reliability of 360-degree evaluation in our study was different between the 3 months of the training program. This finding can be explained by the fact that the residents are not working in a stable environment. They change rotation frequently, and there are new raters at the new sites. It is also possible that PGY 1 residents became less homogenous in their abilities during the 3 months of the training program. In fact, the 360-degree evaluation is a method that only provides global rating regarding of the PGY 1 residents , performance; it will not demonstrate the details. In other words, the 360-degree evaluation is a tool for assessing the change of knowledge, skills, and attitude rather than physical examination skills. Actually, a complete evaluation of the PGY 1 performance should include a 360-degree evaluation and an OSCE focusing on physical examination skills.",

The pass rates of all methods were between 61% and 81% (Fig. 2 ). In comparison with other tools, the reliability of the small-scale OSCE was not acceptable. Meanwhile, the pass rate was not very high for the OSCE of our study. These results indicate that the structure of the small-scale OSCE used in our study should modify to improve the pass rate in the future. Nevertheless, average small scale-OSCE and 360-degree evaluation scores were still significantly well correlated (r \u00bc 0.37, p < 0.05), suggesting a high reliability of the overall program. 1 Further, we combined the small-scale OSCE with other tools to improve its reliability and reflect the real performance of PGY 1 residents as seen in Table 2 . Notably, the correlation between small-scale OSCE \u00fe DOPS-composited scores and 360degree evaluation scores was increased (r \u00bc 0.72, p < 0.01). Finally, a further markedly increase in the correlation between OSCE \u00fe DOPS \u00fe IM-ITE \u00d2 and 360-degree evaluation scores was observed (r \u00bc 0.85, p < 0.01). These results can also be explained by the fact that small scale-OSCE, DOPS, and IM-ITE \u00d2 assess different areas of knowledge and skills. Accordingly, adding all of the three scores showed a high correlation with the 360-degree evaluation because more items were being sampled.",

However, our results are strengthened by the completeness of our data over a 3-year period. The series, small-scale OSCE, DOPS, IM-ITE \u00d2 , and 360-degree evaluations were 3 years apart in time. This is a long period in a learning environment, and many confounding variables can have an impact on the learning of PGY 1 residents. However, there is always \"noise\" in educational measurement, and we can postulate that the impact of these confounding variables may be found to be equally distributed among the observed scores of the four evaluations and could explain the results. Despite the noise and 3-year time interval, we still observed a relatively strong correlation among the variables under study.",

Nevertheless, our study showed a strong correlation between the 360-degree evaluation and small-scale OSCE \u00fe DOPS \u00fe IM-ITE \u00d2 scores. Accordingly, the following of the core competencies of trainees regularly by IM-ITE \u00d2 and 360-degree evaluation in our system may be valid on the program level. In OSCE, it was not possible to blind faculty raters to the PGY 1 resident's identity. Our study was included OSCE before and after 3 months of internal medicine training course. In order to avoid the bias coming from the fact that PGY 1 residents with a weaker OSCE performance might have tended to prepare more diligently for their next post-course OSCE, the raters of small-scale OSCE in our study did not give any feedback to PGY 1 residents before they completed the post-course OSCE. Meanwhile, the trainees knew their OSCE before and OSCE 3month scores only after finishing the entire testing sequence.",

Notably, the inter-rater agreements were quite good for the four technical skills of DOPS in our study.
