According to the literature, exposure to live poultry could be an important risk factor for human infection with H7N9.

Severe illness was divided into 'severe without death' and 'severe with death'. The 11 H7N9 cases of unknown status were classified as 'unknown without death'. 12 whereas the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) published the GBD 2010, including the GBD 2010 Disability weights. 13 Disability weights of general infectious disease (acute episode for mild, moderate and severe) were adopted from IHME based on clinician's suggestions of symptoms from H7N9 cases that were more severe than the general infectious disease cases. The 2012 per capita gross domestic product (GDP), which was used to calculate the cost of lost lives and the cost of disability, was obtained from the National Bureau of Statistics of China. Poultry production and trade data from 27 prefectures with confirmed H7N9 cases, including live poultry sales, dates of live-market closings and market-stall volumes were collected from field surveys, local livestock-breeding year book 14 and the Chinese Commodities Trading-Market Statistics Yearbook 2012. 15 Data were gathered from the 10 affected provinces and 8 unaffected adjacent provinces.

Based on the case category and characteristics of case spatiotemporal distribution, costs were broken down into direct medical costs (outpatient and inpatient examination and treatment) and indirect costs (death, disability and PIL). To calculate the DALYs attributable to H7N9, the H7N9-specific years of life loss due to premature mortality (YLLs) and years lived with disability (YLDs) were computed and summed. An intensive analysis of PIL would be complex and would require timeconsuming field surveys. Indirect effects may lag behind.

Four cost drivers were extracted: cost of outpatient and inpatient examinations in the ward, cost of examinations in intensive care units (ICUs), cost of treatment and other costs (including medical consumables, charge for sickbed, general care services, check-up fee, etc). A cost formula was constructed for each driver, as depicted in table 1. The cost per patient was estimated by experienced hospital financial officers and hospital doctors. The mean number of days (ICU stay, hospital stay and days of treatment) was estimated from the epidemiological data. The number of patients for each driver was derived from a previous publication. 6 The professional's experience was also considered for some items that were not included in our surveillance system. Costs for the category 'unknown without death' were assumed to be moderate and were set as the average of the costs of mild cases and severe cases without death.",

The cost estimate for these unknown patients was replaced by the average cost of mild and severe cases without death. Second, in the cost model, some of the data (eg, the mean number of days of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation for severe without death cases) were obtained from a small proportion of investigated cases, which could result in an estimation bias. Third, the direct medical cost did not include opportunity cost, 24 the cost that is incurred because a limited resource is used to treat a preventable disease and cannot therefore be used to treat another disease. 25 The medical practitioner's salary, research funding and loss of working time for family numbers of patients with H7N9 were excluded from our study. Fourth, estimates of direct medical costs per day might show large differences for specific cases because the drug cost could grow considerably if imported and nutritional drugs were used. We considered only the average severity for patients in the ward and ICU. Fifth, 17 patients were still in the hospital on 28 May 2013 according to the literature. 26 The mean numbers of days in the ward and ICU for severe cases and their death rate were thus underestimated. Some of the mild cases may not have been reported, which also resulted in underestimating the cost. Sixth, we considered only direct losses from closing down live poultry markets and large-scale poultry slaughter, which could be estimated accurately and quickly. This estimate was useful for early control and decision-making; however, other losses involved in the livestock-production chain, such as increased breeding costs, poultry seeding, the prices of poultry meat and eggs and the decreased production of poultry-feather industries should be considered in further studies. 27 In conclusion, we present a rapid, operable and accurate framework for estimating the burden of human infections from H7N9. This framework could be used in a BOD analysis of future H7N9 or similar outbreaks. The results including direct and indirect costs provide fundamental information for researchers and public and policymakers to support timely and effective interventions. Future study may focus on the costeffectiveness analysis of poultry industry shut down, earlier diagnosis and effective treatments of patients based on more detailed investigation information. ",

The mean cost per patient was \u00a510 117 (US$1619) for mild patients, \u00a5139 323 (US$22 292) for severe cases without death and \u00a5205 976 (US$32 956) for severe cases with death. The mean cost per day was \u00a51124 (US$180) for a mild case, \u00a58293 (US$1327) for a severe case without death and \u00a58978 (US$1437) for a severe case with death. As the severity of the illness increased, the costs increased correspondingly. Cost of DALYs for H7N9 A total of 39 deaths from confirmed H7N9, including 30 men and 9 women, were reported from the National Health and Family Planning Commission of China by 31 May 2013. See online supplementary table S3 for more details on the number of cases in each age group. The total YLLs were 676.89. There were 131 H7N9 cases, including 25 mild cases, 95 severe cases and 11 of unknown category (assumed to be moderate). The YLD calculations were based on the case category. Total YLDs were 1.064 (see online supplementary table S4). DALYs combined the time lived with disability and the time lost due to premature mortality; thus, DALYs were 677.848for all confirmed patients with H7N9. We adopted 2012 per capita GDP for the 10 provinces and estimated the cases adjusted per capita GDP (\u00a565 655 or US$10 505). By calculating the weight of production capability for each age group, we obtained the average weight of production capability to be 0.39 for all confirmed H7N9 cases. The total cost of DALYs was \u00a517 356 561 (US$2 777 050) according to formula 4.",
