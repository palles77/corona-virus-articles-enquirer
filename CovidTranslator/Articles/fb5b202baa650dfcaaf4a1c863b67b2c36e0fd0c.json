Based on current genome sequence analyses, we found that synonymous codon usage variations in the protein-coding genes of begomoviruses are mainly influenced by mutation bias. Base composition analysis suggested that the codon usage bias of AV1 and BV1 genes is significant and their expressions are high. Fourteen codons were determined as translational optimal ones according to the comparison of codon usage patterns between highly and lowly expressed genes. Interestingly the codon usages between begomoviruses from the Old and the New Worlds are apparently different, which supports the idea that the bipartite begomoviruses of the New World might originate from bipartite ones of the Old World, whereas the latter evolve from the Old World monopartite begomoviruses.",

Most geminiviruses belong to the genus Begomovirus, which are transmitted exclusively by the whitefly Bemisia tabaci (Harrison and Robinson, 1999) . Many begomoviruses have bipartite genomes known as DNA A and DNA B. DNA A contains the AV1 (coat protein) and AV2 ORFs (open reading frames) in the virus strand and, on the complementary strand, four ORFs: AC1 (replication initiation protein), AC2 (transcriptional activator protein), AC3 (replication enhancer protein) and AC4. The virus and complementary strands of DNA B contain two ORFs: BV1 (nuclear shuttle protein) and BC1 (movement protein). Some begomoviruses have a monopartite genome and lack DNA B. Phylogenetic analysis shows that begomoviruses can be generally divided into two groups, the Old World begomoviruses (eastern hemisphere, Asia, Africa, Europe, the Mediterranean areas) and the New World begomoviruses (western hemisphere, the Americas). All the New World begomoviruses are evolved to bipartite with lack of AV2 ORF in DNA A, whereas both bipartite and monopartite begomoviruses in the Old World encode AV2 ORF (Harrison and Robinson, 1999) .",

RSCU values have no relation to the amino acids usage and the abundance ratio of synonymous codons, which can directly reflect the bias of synonymous codon usage (Sharp and Li, 1986) . The codon adaptation index (CAI) was used to estimate the extent of bias towards codons that were known to be preferred in highly expressed genes (Sharp and Li, 1987) . It is now proved that CAI values mostly approach the theoretical values to reflect the expression level of a gene. Thus it has been widely utilized to measure the gene expression level (Naya et al., 2001; Gupta et al., 2004) . A CAI value ranges from 0 to 1.0, and a higher value indicates a stronger codon usage bias and a higher expression level.",

In general, if genes are distributed in N c plots approaching the expected continuous curve with no selection, then codon usage bias of genes is mainly influenced by compositional constraints. Otherwise the codon usage bias of genes is more affected by other factors such as translational selection, etc. The N c plot for genes of the 147 begomoviruses showed that although a small number of genes were located on the expected curve, most points lay far below the expected curve ( Fig.1) , suggesting that apart from mutation bias, other factors might also play a role in shaping the codon usage bias of begomoviruses (Guo et al., 2007) . Table 1 The GC content at the different codon positions and the A, T, G and C contents at the third position of begomovirus genes Base composition analysis suggested that the codon usage of the AC4 gene, which is always embedded in the AC1 gene, might differentiate from other genes. In addition, strong codon bias was observed in AV1 gene. Because of the special characteristics of the abovementioned genes, we selected them for examining the influence factors in shaping the codon usage (Fig.2a) . The N c plots of AV1, AC1 and AC4 genes suggested that apart from compositional constraints, other factors might play important roles in shaping their codon usage, although high translational selection seems to lay stress on the AC4 gene because of the wide range of N c values for the same GC3 content.",

The distribution of the three groups along the first two major axes showed that the Old World monopartite begomoviruses and the New World bipartite ones were located in two independent fields, indicating that the two groups of begomoviruses exhibit a different codon usage pattern. Because the species with a close genetic relationship always present a similar codon usage pattern (Sharp et al., 1988) , the genetic relationship of the two groups of begomoviruses should be far removed from each other.

Therefore, the base mutation at the synonymous third codon position may not affect the protein expression for AC1 gene because of the degeneration of genetic codons. But for the embedded AC4 gene, the corresponding base mutation occurs at the second codon position, which probably results in the loss of function of the translated protein.

Based on codon usage pattern analysis, it could be inferred that there was no direct relationship between the Old World monopartite begomoviruses and the New World bipartite ones. Interestingly, a small number of the Old World bipartite begomoviruses exhibited a similar codon usage pattern to the New World bipartite ones, which suggested that the ancestor of begomoviruses could have evolved from monopartite to bipartite ones before they were transferred to the New World areas. Subsequently it was not the Old World monopartite begomoviruses but the Old World bipartite ones that transmitted to the New World in a certain way and finally evolved into the New World bipartite begomoviruses.

Rybicki (1994) suggested that the absence of the AV2 gene in all the New World begomoviruses could be attributed to its earlier loss after the New World begomoviruses arriving in the New World. These results suggest that the current New World begomoviruses evolved from ancient viruses after transferring to the New World. Ha et al.(2006) speculated that the new identified begomovirus termed Corchorus yellow vein virus (CoYVV) might belong to a New World begomovirus group that previously existed in the Old World, which suggested that the common ancestor of the New World begomovirus might originate from the Old World begomovirus. However, both the New World and Old World begomoviruses had began to evolve and coexisted in this area for a long time before the separation of the continents.
