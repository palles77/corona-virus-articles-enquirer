However, as shown 181 in our study (Fig 1), viral RNAs could not be detected in the upper respiratory 182 samples from some severe cases (cases 02, 06 and 07), while positive in the BALF. 183 Moreover, in some patients like cases 04 and 13, the viruses were not detected in the 184 first three samples, mostly in the 0~7 d.a.o. The results suggest that the suspected 185 patients especially those with exposure history and clinical symptoms might not be 186 excluded from NCP despite that viral RNA was not detected in the upper respiratory 187 samples. Since human to human transmission of 2019-nCoV have been proved in 188 recent studies 2,3,6,8 ,we must pay more attention to these people, in case of further 189 spread of the virus. Under such circumstances, CT scan might provide important 190 make up for the diagnosis of NCP patients. For example, although no viral RNAs 191 were detected in the first three or all the upper respiratory samples from cases 02, 07 192 and 13, the CT scans showed typical viral pneumonia linked to NCP 7,11,12 , and finally 193 2019-nCoV were identified. Another notification is that, during the antiviral treatment, 194 even though we did not detect the viral RNA in the upper respiratory tract, while it 195 was still positive in the BALF samples of some patients (cases 01, 06 and 07). 196 Therefore, detection of the viral RNA in the BALF might be necessary for the 197 monitoring of viral shedding, especially the patients in severe conditions. 198 Studies have shown that 2019-nCoV could utilize Angiotensin-converting 199 enzyme 2 (ACE2) as the receptor to infect the host as SARS-CoV did 11,13 . 200 All rights reserved.
