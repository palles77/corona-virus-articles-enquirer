Therefore, the development of a rapid and simple method for on-site detection of SARS-CoV is crucial for the identification and prevention of future SARS outbreaks. In this study, a simple colorimetric and multiplex loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) assay was developed to rapid screening of severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV). It can be visually detected based on color change and monitored in real-time with fluorescent signals. The performance of this assay, based on six primers targeting open reading frame (ORF1b) and nucleocapsid (N) genes located in different regions of the SARS-CoV, was compared with real-time RT-PCR assay using various concentrations of target genes. The detection limit of the LAMP assay was comparable to that of real-time RT-PCR assay and therefore a few target RNA to 10 4 -10 5 copies could be detected within a short period of time (20-25 min). In addition, we established a multiplex real-time LAMP assay to simultaneously detect two target regions within the SARS-CoV genome. Two target sequences were amplified by specific primers in the same reaction tube and revealed that it was able to detect down to 10 5 copies. The standard curve had a linear relationship with similar amplification efficiencies. The LAMP assay results in shorter \"sample-to-answer\" time than conventional PCR method. Therefore, it is suitable not only for diagnosis of clinical test, but also for surveillance of SARS virus in developing countries.",

            "text": "Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) caused by a novel coronavirus (CoV) is a highly contagious respiratory illness 1 . Its initial systemic symptoms include muscle pain, headache, and fever. Onset of respiratory symptoms such as cough, dyspnea, and pneumonia is then followed in 2~14 days 1, 2 . The SARS epidemic in July 2003 was one of the worst global epidemics. It affected 30 countries with 8,096 cases and 774 deaths [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] . Since the end of its global epidemic, SARS has reemerged four times according to statistics of the World Health Organization (WHO): three times from laboratory accidents (Singapore and Taipei) and once in southern China where the source of infection remains undetermined although there is circumstantial evidence of animal-to-human transmission 8 . Nevertheless, considering the recent outbreaks of SARS-like disease caused by the newly emerged Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS-CoV) that is highly related to SARS-CoV 9 , the possibility of re-emergence of SARS may still remains 10, 11 . Hence, the development of a rapid and simple method for on-site screening of SARS-CoV is important for the determination and prevention of future outbreaks. SARS-CoV could be detected at sera, throat washes and stool after the onset of illness with viral load ranging from 10 4 to 10 9 copies/ml 12 and the presence viral RNA differ from different anatomical site 13 . Current diagnosis of SARS-CoV infection depends on laboratory-based tests (i.e., virus isolation in cell culture, serological, and molecular tests) because its clinical features are nonspecific particularly at the early stage of disease, unlike other respiratory illnesses. Virus isolation by inoculating cell cultures has long served as the gold standard to identify the presence of infection. However, this method needs considerable expertise and it is usually time consuming. Serological detection of viral antibodies (IgG, IgM) by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and immunofluorescence (IFA) have been found to be sensitive (98.2% for ELISA and 99.1% for the IFA; 33.6%, respectively) 14 . However, antibodies are often undetectable in the first few days after the onset of infection, making early diagnosis difficult. On the other hand, conventional reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reactions (RT-PCR) and their quantitative approaches can allow direct detection of viral RNA. However, they require complex analytical instruments, expensive reagents, and considerable expertise 15 . In addition, these techniques have limitations in developing countries and field situations because of poor resources and the lack of specialized personnel.",

            "text": "Loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) is a nucleotide acid amplification method that features high sensitivity, specificity, and rapidity under isothermal conditions 16 . LAMP requires a set of four specific primers that recognize six distinct sequences on the target. Primers used for LAMP assays contain a forward outer primer (F3), a backward outer primer (B3), a forward inner primer (FIP, comprised of two binding domains, F1c and F2), and a backward inner primer (BIP, comprised of two binding domains, B1 and B2c). FIP and BIP, of which both the 3\u2032 region and 5\u2032 region match the target, can interact with upstream external primers, resulting in the displacement of strands containing self-complementary regions that form stem-loop structures 17 . The reaction can be conspicuously accelerated by adding two loop primers (LF and LB), thus reducing the total reaction time 18 . Amplification products can be detected at the endpoint by using several methods, including gel electrophoresis, measuring turbidity derived from magnesium pyrophosphate precipitation 19 , and fluorescent signal generated by DNA intercalators such as calcein and SYBR green I 20 . LAMP does not need any special devices for processing. Thus, it is widely used for the detection of a wide range of pathogens such as bacteria 21, 22 , parasites 23 , and viruses 24, 25 including SARS-CoV 26, 27 . For instance, H. Thai et al. 26 . had been validated reverse transcription (RT) LAMP assay using SARS-positive clinical specimens with high sensitivity. By the way, in the detection method based on turbidity monitoring and DNA intercalators, the detection of unexpected signals derived from primer dimer and/or non-primer reactions can lead to false-positive results 28 . Apart from that, colorimetric detection methods using pH indicator dyes that monitor a significant pH change during LAMP amplification have been recently developed 29 . Its results can be simply and readily visualized with naked eyes based on color change. Recently, fluorescent RT-LAMP assays using quenching probes have also been developed to specifically monitor only primer-derived signals 30, 31 . However, most reported detection methods for LAMP are end-point techniques that can only detect a gene in a single reaction 32, 33 . Multiplex LAMP assays that can detect and discriminate two or more target genes in a single reaction are limited.",

When the tube was examined before gel electrophoresis, a positive LAMP reaction was indicated by an orange color while negative reactions remained a color of pink (see Supplementary information S1 Figure) . After tubes were visually assessed for color change, samples were subjected to agarose gel electrophoresis. Characteristic bands were evident in the gel if the product was present. Based on agarose gel electrophoresis, the reaction with four primers produced a detectable LAMP product at 62 \u00b0C (see Supplementary information 2S Figure) . However, nonspecific amplification occurred. For the reaction with six primers, amplifications occurred anywhere between 57 \u00b0C and 68 \u00b0C for N gene and between 52 \u00b0C and 65 \u00b0C for ORF1b gene.

            "text": "To confirm that our primer sets were suitable for LAMP analysis, gradient assay was performed using temperature from 50 \u00b0C to 72 \u00b0C with both cDNAs as templates. After reaction for 30 minutes, 20 \u00b5l reaction containing cDNA showed color change from pink to yellow whereas the reaction containing distilled water as a negative sample did not show such color change. As a result of electrophoresis, smear band appeared at 62\u00b0C in a control containing only sterile water without a template. This non-specific amplification was attributed to sets of primers under certain assay conditions because LAMP relies on six different primers independently recognizing eight regions on the target sequences 34 . It is important therefore to determine optimal assay condition without nonspecific amplification associated with primers. In Figure 2 , the reaction at 65\u00b0C of a control sample did not show a smear band. Therefore, the detection of ORF1b and N genes could be performed at this temperature. Sensitivities of LAMP and conventional PCR were then assessed by using 10-fold serial dilution of target (10 10~1 0 1 copies per reactions). The limit-ofdetection under optimal conditions (using six primers at 65 \u00b0C for 30 min) are shown in Figure 3 . Results of 1.5 % agarose gel electrophoresis for ORF1b gene and N gene are shown in Figures 3A and 3B . The detection limit of LAMP assay was estimated to be 10 5 copies per reaction for ORF1b gene and 10 4 copies per reaction for N gene. This indicates that visual detection results are correlated with results from agarose gel electrophoresis. When the same amount of RNA was used in conventional RT-PCR, a similar level of amplification was observed. The detection limit of conventional RT-PCR was estimated to be about 10 5 copies for ORF1b gene and 10 4 copies for N gene. The performance of real-time LAMP assay was also compared with that of real-time PCR assay (Figure 4 ). Real-time LAMP reaction was carried out at 65 \u00b0C for 30 min and fluorescence signals were collected at 30 sec intervals. During real-time LAMP reaction, fluorescence data were obtained from HEX channel for ORF1b gene and FAM channel for N gene. Threshold time (Tt*) was calculated as the time at which the fluorescence signal was equal to the threshold value. In the plot, the Y-axis denotes fluorescence and the X-axis shows time in minutes. Standard curves of LAMP assays were established. They were linear over at least five orders of magnitude (R 2 > 0.98 for ORF1b gene and R 2 > 0.99 for N gene). Meanwhile, standard curves produced by real-time PCR revealed a good linearity within the detection limit, showing high correlations between Ct and DNA quantities (R 2 > 0.99 for both genes). The detection limit of the LAMP assay was slightly lower than or comparable to that of real-time PCR assay. However, target DNA with 10 5 -10 6 copies can be detected within a short period of time (20-25 min) .",

In multiplex assay, two or more target sequences are simultaneously amplified in the same assay 35 . Complicating matters is that multiplex requires two or more sets of primers that do not interfere with each other in a single reaction. Since four or six primers are contained in a single LAMP reaction, optimization and validation of multiplex PCR need considerable time and effort. In this work, multiplex real-time LAMP assays have been validated as shown in Figure 5 . Our multiplex LAMP assay with adjustment of primer concentration could detect down to 10 5 copies based on RNA standards. The standard curve had a linear relationship (R 2 > 0.99) with similar amplification efficiencies. These results indicate that there is no preferential amplification of one target sequence over another (i.e., amplification bias) when equal primer concentrations were used.",

RT-PCR assays using ORF1b and N genes were also performed for detection using a RT-PCR kit (AccuPower\u00ae HotStart PCR PreMix) and a thermal cycler (Applied Biosystems) following manufacturers' protocols. Reactions were carried out in a total volume of 25 \u03bcL containing PCR premix, 20 pmol of each primer, 1 \u03bcL of template cDNA, and distilled water. Thermal cycling conditions consisted of an initial denaturation at 94 \u00b0C for 5 min, followed by 40 cycles at 94 \u00b0C for 30 s, annealing at 55 \u00b0C for 30 s, and extension at 72 \u00b0C for 30 s.
