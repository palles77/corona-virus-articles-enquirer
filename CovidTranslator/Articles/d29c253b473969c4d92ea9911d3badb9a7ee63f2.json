            "text": "individual patients vary in their responses to bleomycin. The identification of genetic differences 48 that underlie this response variation could improve treatment outcomes by tailoring bleomycin 49 dosages to each patient. We used the model organism Caenorhabditis elegans to identify genetic 50 determinants of bleomycin-response differences by performing linkage mapping on 51 recombinants derived from a cross between the laboratory strain (N2) and a wild strain 52 (CB4856). This approach identified a small genomic region on chromosome V that underlies 53 bleomycin-response variation. Using near-isogenic lines and strains with CRISPR-Cas9 54 mediated deletions and allele replacements, we discovered that a novel nematode-specific gene 55 (scb-1) is required for bleomycin resistance. Although the mechanism by which this gene causes 56 variation in bleomycin responses is unknown, we suggest that a rare variant present in the 57 CB4856 strain might cause differences in the potential stress-response function of scb-1 between 58 the N2 and CB4856 strains, thereby leading to differences in bleomycin resistance. 59 .

            "text": "Here, we used a high-throughput fitness assay to measure bleomycin responses across a panel of 104 249 RIAILs (Andersen et al. 2015) and then performed linkage mapping to identify quantitative 105 trait loci (QTL) that underlie bleomycin-response variation. We used near-isogenic lines (NILs) 106 to validate the largest effect QTL on chromosome V. Our results from the NIL assays suggested 107 that epistatic loci underlie bleomycin responses, but a two-factor genome scan was unable to 108 detect significant genetic interactions. Next, we created and tested CRISPR-Cas9 mediated 109 deletion alleles to investigate all six candidate genes in the QTL region. We identified a 110 nematode-specific gene, H19N07.3, that underlies this QTL. Although this gene does not contain 111 a protein-coding variant between the N2 and CB4856 strains, its gene expression varies across 112 the RIAIL panel. Interestingly, a genome-wide association (GWA) approach identifies different 113 QTL than the linkage mapping approach, suggesting that both common and rare variants underlie 114 bleomycin response variation. Given the genetic complexity underlying the bleomycin response 115 phenotype, this study highlights the power of the C. elegans model system to identify elusive 116 causal genes. 117 118 MATERIALS AND METHODS 119 120 Strains: Animals were grown at 20\u00ba on 6 cm plates of modified nematode growth medium 121 (NGMA), which contained 1% agar and 0.7% agarose, spotted with OP50 bacteria (Ghosh et al. 122 2012). The two parental strains used in this study were N2 and CB4856. N2 is the canonical 123 laboratory strain of C. elegans that has been extensively studied (Brenner 1974) . CB4856 is a 124 well studied Hawaiian wild isolate that is genetically divergent from N2 and has a characterized 125 genome (Wicks et al. 2001; Swan et al. 2002 ; Thompson et al. 2015) .

Because bleomycin exposure can affect animal 150 proliferation (brood size), animal growth (length), and animal development (optical density), the 151 fitness parameters we measured with the BIOSORT included brood size (n), animal length (time 152 of flight, TOF), and optical density (extinction time, EXT). 153 154 Bleomycin-response trait measurements and processing: Phenotypic measurements collected 155 by the BIOSORT were processed using the R package easysorter (Shimko and Andersen 2014) . 156",

Our initial linkage mappings used the 1,454 marker set (Rockman 255 and Kruglyak 2009) and had a QTL confidence interval larger than the interval found using the 256 whole-genome marker set (described above). Because this confidence interval was larger and 257 more conservative, we kept it for subsequent testing of candidate genes. This expanded interval 258 contained an additional 20 kb on either side of the whole-genome marker set confidence interval 259 (File S9). The snpeff function within the cegwas R package was used to identify variants within 260 the region of interest (File S11 . We performed linkage mapping as described above on these expression data and 315 identified significant peaks for 3,298 probes (File S13).

For each heterozygous/hemizygous 323 genotype, 30 hermaphrodites and 60 males were placed onto each of four 6 cm plates and 324 allowed to mate for 48 hours. The same process was completed for homozygous strains to 325 remove biases introduced by the presence of male progeny in the assay. Mated hermaphrodites 326 were transferred to a clean 6 cm plate and allowed to lay embryos for eight hours. After the egg 327 lay period, adults were manually removed from egg lay plates, and embryos were washed into 15 328 mL conicals using M9 and a combination of pasteur pipette rinsing and scraping with plastic 329 inoculation loops. Embryos were rinsed and centrifuged four times with M9 before being 330 resuspended in K medium and 50 \u00b5M kanamycin. Embryos hatched and arrested in the L1 larval 331 stage in conicals overnight at 20\u00ba with shaking. The next morning, 50 L1 larvae were sorted into 332 .

Therefore, exposure to bleomycin can affect the development of C. 429 elegans larvae as well as germ-cell production of adult animals. We used a high-throughput 430 assay (HTA) to measure the effects of bleomycin on development and brood size (Figure S1 , 431 Materials and Methods). To determine the concentration of bleomycin that would maximize 432 among-strain while minimizing within-strain phenotypic variation, we used the HTA to perform 433 a dose-response assay. We assessed bleomycin responses for four divergent strains (N2, 434 CB4856, JU258, and DL238) across each of 26 HTA traits (File S1, Figure S2 ). Lee et al. 2017). We used these RIAILs to identify genetic variants that contribute to differential 449 bleomycin responses between the N2 and CB4856 strains. Using our HTA, we measured each of 450 the 26 fitness parameters for 249 RIAILs (Materials and Methods, File S3). Correlations 451 between each pairwise combination of the 26 HTA measurements revealed several clusters of 452 highly correlated traits ( Figure S3) . Therefore, the summary statistics measured by the 453 BIOSORT should not be considered independent traits for linkage mapping. We selected median 454 optical density (median.EXT) for future analyses, which is related to both animal length and 455 optical extinction, because this trait was highly correlated with many of the 26 HTA traits and 456 was highly heritable (H 2 = 0.73, File S2). 457 458",

We performed a two-factor genome scan to map potential 480 epistatic loci but did not identify a significant interaction between the QTL on chromosome V 481 and other loci (Figure S7, File S8) . However, the failure to detect significant interacting QTL 482 could be because we have too few recombinant strains or because too few replicates of each 483 RIAIL were phenotyped. Alternatively, more than two loci might underlie the transgressive 484 phenotype of ECA230 and a two-factor genome scan might not be able to capture this 485 complexity. 486 487 Nonetheless, because ECA230 recapitulated the expected QTL phenotype, we generated two 488 NILs (ECA411 and ECA528) that narrowed this introgressed region to more precisely locate the 489 causal variant (File S5, File S6 ). In addition, the N2 region on the left of chromosome V was 490 removed from both NIL strains to ensure that this region of introgression did not underlie the 491 phenotypic difference between ECA230 and CB4856. The genotypes of ECA411 and ECA528 492 differ in a small region of chromosome V that includes the QTL confidence interval (Figure 2 , 493 .

This result could suggest that the introgressed region shared between 495 these strains, which does not include the QTL, conferred some bleomycin-response variation 496 between the N2 and CB4856 strains (Figure 2) . Alternatively, the hypersensitivity of these NILs 497 could suggest the presence of Dobzhansky-Muller incompatibilities between the N2 and CB4856 498 genotypes (Snoek et al. 2014 ) that might affect stress responses of the NILs. However, ECA528 499 was much more sensitive to bleomycin than ECA411 (Figure 2, File S7) . Because ECA528 has 500 the N2 genotype across the QTL region and ECA411 has the CB4856 genotype, these results 501 suggest that the QTL genotype strongly affects bleomycin sensitivity (Figure 2 The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the author/funder.

These variants could cause differential bleomycin sensitivity between 518 the N2 and CB4856 strains. 519 520 To test these genes in bleomycin-response variation, we systematically deleted each of the 521 candidate genes in both the N2 and CB4856 backgrounds. We used CRISPR-Cas9 mediated 522 genome editing to generate two independent deletion alleles of each gene in each genetic 523 background to reduce the possibility that off-target mutations could cause phenotypic differences 524 (Materials and Methods, Supplemental Information). We tested the bleomycin response of each 525 deletion allele in comparison to the N2 and CB4856 parental strains ( Figure 3B, File S3) . The 526 deletion alleles of C45B11.8, C45B11.6, srg-42, and cnc-10 each had a bleomycin response 527 similar to the respective parent genetic background, which suggested that the functions of each 528 of these genes did not affect bleomycin responses ( Figure 3B, File S7 , p > 0.05, Tukey HSD). 529",

We used the 13,001 SNPs to perform linkage mapping on the gene expression data of 577 the RIAILs and identified 4,326 expression QTL (eQTL) across the genome (Rockman et al. 578 2010, File S12, File S13, Materials and Methods). Of the 118 genes in the 187 kb surrounding 579 the bleomycin-response QTL, expression for 50 genes were measured in the previous microarray 580 study. We identified a significant eQTL for eight of these 50 genes, four of which mapped to 581 chromosome V (File S13). eQTL for two of those four genes, H19N07.3 and cnc-10, mapped to 582 the center of chromosome V and overlapped with the bleomycin-response QTL. Because cnc-10 583 did not underlie bleomycin response variation (Figure 3B) (Figure 4A and B, File S14) . The length 586 of animals and expression of scb-1 was correlated in the RIAIL strains ( Figure 4C , File S15, 587 r 2 = 0.61, p < 9.5e-13 Spearman's correlation). Although this gene does not have a non-588 synonymous variant between the N2 and CB4856 strains, natural variation in gene expression 589 could impact bleomycin responses. 1.4e-14, ECA1132 vs. N2, p = 6.9e-5, ECA1135 vs. N2, p = 0.006, Tukey HSD). These results 597 suggest that H19N07.3 function is required for resistance to bleomycin. Therefore, we renamed 598 this gene scb-1 for sensitivity to the chemotherapeutic bleomycin. Unlike with the jmjd-5 599 deletion strains, the scb-1 deletion strains had no significant differences in the control condition 600 (File S7). Therefore, the bleomycin sensitivity of the scb-1 deletion strains were not caused by 601 control-condition phenotypes. 602 603 Because an scb-1 non-synonymous variant has not been identified between the N2 and CB4856 604 strains, changes to protein function likely do not cause bleomycin response differences. RIAILs 605 with the CB4856 allele at the QTL peak marker have increased expression of scb-1 and 606 increased bleomycin resistance compared to RIAILs with the N2 allele (Figure 1, Figure 4) . 607",

This result could be caused by the low sample size (n = 3) in the RNA-seq 612 experiment, or the RIAIL strains could have a novel variant that arose during strain construction 613 that causes scb-1 expression variation. Alternatively, the expression difference observed in the 614 RIAIL strains could be attributed to epistatic loci. We performed a two-factor genome scan to 615 identify epistatic loci that underlie scb-1 expression variation in the RIAILs and identified two 616 significant interactions: one between loci on chromosomes IV and X and another between loci on 617 chromosomes II and V ( Figure S14 , File S17).

However, gene expression can 636 be regulated by distant loci, so the identification of the specific variant is difficult. To understand 637 whether natural variation of scb-1 underlies bleomycin-response differences in other strains, we 638 compared the bleomycin-response linkage mapping to a genome-wide association mapping 639 (GWA). We used the HTA to measure median optical density in bleomycin for 83 divergent wild 640 isolates and performed GWA mapping (Figure 7 , File S18, File S19). Six QTL were identified 641 from the GWA, but none of these QTL regions overlapped the QTL from linkage mapping 642 (Figure 7, File S19) .

For each desired deletion, we 271 designed a 5' and a 3' guide RNA with the highest possible on-target and off-target scores, 272 calculated using the Doench algorithm (Doench et al. 2016). The N2 and CB4856 L4 273 hermaphrodite larvae were picked to 6 cm agar plates seeded with OP50 E. coli 24 hours before 274 injection. The CRISPR injection mix was assembled by first incubating 0.88 \u00b5L of 200 \u00b5M 275 AltR\u00ae CRISPR-Cas9 tracrRNA (IDT, catalog no. 1072532), 0.82 \u00b5L of each of the 5' and 3' 276 AltR\u00ae CRISPR-Cas9 crRNAs at a stock concentration of 100 \u00b5M in Duplex Buffer (IDT), and 277 0.12 \u00b5L of 100 \u00b5M dpy-10 co-injection crRNA at 95\u00ba for five minutes. 2.52 \u00b5L of 69 \u00b5M AltR\u00ae 278 S. pyogenes Cas9 Nuclease (IDT, catalog no. 1081058) was added to the tracrRNA/crRNA 279 complex mixture and incubated at room temperature for five minutes. Finally, 0.5 \u00b5L of 10 \u00b5M 280 dpy-10 repair construct and distilled water were added to a final volume of 10 \u00b5L. The injection 281 mixture was loaded into the injection capillary using a mouth pipet to avoid bubbles in the 282 injection solution. Young adult animals were mounted onto agar injection pads, injected in either 283 the anterior or posterior arm of the gonad, and allowed to recover on 6 cm plates in bulk. Twelve 284 hours after injection, survivors were transferred to individual 6 cm plates. Broods with successful 285 edits were easily observed because of the dpy-10 co-injection marker, which created animals 286 four days after injections, plates were checked for the presence of Rol or Dpy F1 288 progeny. These Rol F1 progeny were transferred to individual 6 cm plates, allowed to lay 289 offspring, and genotyped for the desired edit 24 hours later. Genotyping was performed with 290 PCR amplicons designed around the desired site of the deletion. Plates with heterozygous or 291 homozygous deletions were propagated and genotyped for at least two more generations to 292 ensure homozygosity and to cross out the Rol mutation. Deletion amplicons were Sanger 293 sequenced to identify the exact location of the deletion. Reagents used to generate deletion 294 alleles are detailed in Supplemental Information. 295 296 Generation of CRISPR-mediated jmjd-5 allele replacements: Allele replacement strains were 297 created to test the effect of a particular amino acid substitution on bleomycin responses. A guide 298 RNA was designed to cut two bp downstream of the natural variant, with an on-target score of 31 299 and off-target score of 47 (Doench et al. 2016). Two repair constructs were designed, one for the 300 N2 to CB4856 replacement and vice versa. Repair oligonucleotides were homologous to the 301 background strain except for the nucleotide variant, a silent mutation in the PAM site (A339A) to 302 eliminate repair construct cleavage, and a silent mutation that introduces a BsaAI restriction 303 enzyme cut site (T336T). Repair constructs contained a 35-bp homology arm on the PAM-304 proximal side of the edit and a 91-bp homology arm on the PAM-distal side of the edit. Injection 305 mixes were made as above, with 0.6 \u00b5L of 100 \u00b5M jmjd-5 repair construct added with the dpy-306 10 repair construct in the last step of the protocol. Animals were injected as above and Rol F1 307 progeny were genotyped using PCR and restriction enzyme digestion. As with the deletion 308 alleles, edited strains were homozygosed and their genotypes were confirmed with Sanger 309 mapping of expression QTL: Microarray data for 13,107 probes were collected for 313 synchronized young adult populations of 209 recombinant lines previously (Rockman et al. 314 2010)",

Animals were incubated in these plates for 48 hours 336 at 20\u00ba with shaking and were paralyzed with 50 \u00b5M sodium azide in M9 before being scored for 337 phenotypic parameters using the BIOSORT.338 339 Statistical analysis: All statistical tests of phenotypic differences in the NIL, deletion strain, and 340 allele-replacement strain assays were performed in R (version 3.3.1) using the TukeyHSD 341 function (R Core Team) and an ANOVA model with phenotype as the dependent variable and 342 strain as the independent variable (phenotype ~ strain). The p-values of individual pairwise strain 343 comparisons were reported, and p-values less than 0.05 were deemed significant. For each figure 344 (with the exception of hemizygosity tests), phenotypes of NILs, deletion strains, and allele-345 replacement strains were compared to phenotypes of their respective background strains (either 346 N2 or CB4856), and statistical significance is denoted by an asterisk above the boxplot for each 347 strain. P-values of all pairwise comparisons are reported in File S7. Correlation between RIAIL 348 H19N07.3 expression and median optical density in bleomycin was tested using a Spearman's 349 correlation test. Statistical difference between N2 and CB4856 expression of H19N07.3 350 measured by RNA-seq was tested using a likelihood-ratio and a Wald test with a threshold of p -seq: Three independent replicates of RNA were sampled as follows. Bleach-synchronized 354 embryos (~2,000) of the N2 and CB4856 strains were grown on 10 cm plates of NGMA for 66. When F1 embryos appeared on the plate, synchronized young adults were collected by 356 washing each plate twice with M9 buffer and incubating for 30 minutes in M9 to remove 357 remaining bacteria. Then, samples were washed twice again with M9 buffer, and then washed 358 with sterile water. Animals were pelleted and homogenized in Trizol (Ambion) by repeating 359 freezing-thawing with liquid nitrogen five times. To extract RNA from each sample, chloroform, 360 isopropanol, and ethanol were used for phase separation, precipitation and washing steps, 361 respectively. RNA pellets were resuspended in TE buffer, and RNA quality was measured with a 362 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent). Library preparation and RNA sequencing (HiSeq4000, Illumina) 363 were performed by the Genomics Facility at the University of Chicago. RNA-seq data were 364 quantified with kallisto and then within-sample and between-sample normalization was 365 performed using sleuth, which is based on DESeq (Anders and Huber 2010; Bray et al. 2016; 366 Pimentel et al. 2017). Significant differences between samples were determined by likelihood-367 ratio and Wald tests. RNA-seq data are reported in File S16. 368 369 Genome-wide association mapping: Bleomycin responses were measured for 83 C. elegans 370 isotypes using the high-throughput fitness assay (File S18). Genome-wide association mapping 371 was performed as described previously (Zdraljevic et al. 2019) using genotype data from 372 CeNDR Release 20180527 (Cook et al. 2017). In short, BCFtools was used to remove variants 373 with missing genotype calls and variants with a minor allele frequency below 5% (Li 2011), and 374 PLINK v1.9 was used to prune the genotypes at a linkage disequilibrium threshold of r 2 < 0.8 375 (Purcell et al. 2007; Chang et al. 2015), for a total of 59,241 pruned markers.

DNA was isolated from 100-300 \u00b5L of packed worms using 184 Omega BioTek's EZ 96 Tissue DNA Kit (catalog no. D1196-01). All samples were diluted to 0.2 185 ng/\u00b5L and incubated with diluted Illumina transposome (catalog no. FC-121-1031). Tagmented 186 samples were amplified with barcoded primers. Unique libraries (192) were pooled by adding 8 187 \u00b5L of each library. The pooled material was size-selected by separating the material on a 2% 188 agarose gel and excising the fragments ranging from 400-600 bp. The sample was purified using 189 Qiagen's Gel Extraction Kit (catalog no. 28706) and eluted in 30 \u00b5L of buffer EB.

Because bleomycin causes double-stranded DNA breaks and 693 introduces oxidative stress to cells (Stubbe and Kozarich 1987) , reduction of scb-1 function 694 might inhibit the ability of an animal to respond to bleomycin. This model is in agreement with 695 our observation that scb-1 deletions and RIAILs with lower scb-1 expression are sensitive to 696 bleomycin (Figure 4, Figure 5 ). We used the amino acid sequence of SCB-1 to query the Phyre2 697 database and found weak homology to a viral hydrolase (Kelley et al. 2015; Zhang et al. 2018) . 698This result could suggest that SCB-1 might function as a hydrolase, which could be the 699 mechanism by which scb-1 regulates cellular stress. This finding would be similar to clinical 700 impact the ability of bleomycin to cause DNA damage within the cell nucleus (Turek et al. 704 2016) . Alternatively, scb-1 could impact bleomycin import, export, or another mechanism. If the 705 mechanism of scb-1 is conserved in humans, this discovery could offer insights into the clinical 706 applications of bleomycin. Our results also suggested the presence of genes that interact with 707 scb-1 to cause bleomycin-response differences. These interacting genes could be conserved in 708 humans and therefore inform the use of bleomycin in the clinic. 709 710 Despite its lack of conservation in humans, the SCB-1 protein is homologous to other proteins in 711 other nematode species. Bleomycin is produced by the soil bacterium, Streptomyces verticillus 712 (Calcutt and Schmidt 1994; Du et al. 2000; Shen et al. 2002) , which might be found in 713 association with nematodes such as C. elegans in the wild (Samuel et al. 2016) . A shared niche 714 between C. elegans and S. verticillus could cause bleomycin resistance to be selected. 715Additionally, the CB4856 wild isolate is more resistant to bleomycin than the laboratory-adapted 716 strain, N2. In fact, the N2 strain is the most sensitive to bleomycin across all strains tested in our 717 HTA ( Figure S16) , which could indicate that bleomycin resistance is beneficial for wild isolates. 718Given its potential role in the highly conserved insulin-like pathway, scb-1 could be beneficial in 719 responses to multiple toxins. Interestingly, the scb-1 gene lies within a toxin-response QTL 720 The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the author/funder. ",
