Membrane-associated proteins have fewer constraints on the type of structures they can adopt, and include proteins that are unstructured in their native state. The determination of the structures of simple transmembrane helix dimers by solid-state NMR [2] [3] [4] over the past few years has provided insights into how hydrophobic helices can specifically associate in membrane environments. The striking observation is that small and weakly polar amino acids (Gly, Ala, Ser and Thr) have high propensities for mediating helix-helix contacts [5] .

These clusters are enormously varied, ranging from highly basic sequences (as in the effector domain of the MARCKS protein) to highly aromatic sequences (as in the scaffolding domain of caveolin).

The positively charged amino acids (Arg, Lys, His) bind to membrane surfaces through non-specific electrostatic interactions. Aromatic amino acids (Trp, Tyr, Phe) allow the membrane-associated peptides to penetrate the membrane surface. A closer look into how basic-aromatic membrane peptide sequences influence membrane structure suggests that peptide-lipid interactions can be both varied and complex. Besides simply binding to membrane surfaces, membraneassociated peptides can mediate membrane fusion, induce curvature, form transient pores and stable channels, cross membranes in a receptor-independent manner, or completely disrupt the bilayer structure.",

NMR spectroscopy is one of the best approaches to study these sequences in their native membrane environment. We discuss the NMR methods that have been used to investigate the structures of membrane-associated proteins and the structure and dynamics of the membrane bilayers that these peptides interact with which they interact. An excellent review of NMR structural methods using magic angle spinning and specific applications to membrane-associated peptides has recently appeared in this series by Huster [6] . Fig. 1 presents in a cartoon form some of the diverse ways peptides with basic-aromatic clusters are thought to interact with membrane bilayers. These clusters can be contained within integral membrane proteins, membrane-associated proteins or short anti-microbial peptides. The aromatic amino acids in basic-aromatic clusters may (i) contribute hydrophobic energy to the binding of the cluster with membranes (ii) enhance the electrostatic potential of the basic amino acids, (iii) influence membrane curvature, and (iv) locally disrupt membrane bilayer structure. In this section, we present an overview of the major ways that basic-aromatic sequences have been found to interact with membranes. There are common themes that run throughout the examples presented (e.g. membrane penetration, non-specific electrostatic interactions), and often the challenge is to discern how subtle differences in protein structure may lead to very different membrane interactions.",

A general model for protein-lipid interactions in these systems is one where non-specific electrostatic interactions mediate the initial contact with the membrane, and hydrophobic and aromatic amino acids penetrate into the membrane interface.

There are also many peripheral membrane proteins whose unstructured sequences bind to cell membranes through non-specific electrostatic interactions [21] . One representative example is the myristoylated alanine-rich C kinase substrate (MARCKS) effector domain. McLaughlin and co-workers [22, 23] have shown that the MARCKS effector domain (residues 151-175) binds strongly to negatively charged membranes and sequesters PI(4,5)P 2 . Phosphorylation of the MARCKS effector domain releases it from the membrane as part of a mechanism for regulating free PI(4,5)P 2 levels in the plasma membrane.",

For example, McLaughlin and Murray [24] have postulated that unstructured regions of the NMDA receptor bind to membranes and laterally sequester PI(4,5)P 2 by the same non-specific electrostatic mechanism as found for the MARCKS effector domain. They propose that the basic-aromatic cluster may participate in closing the NMDA channel via a mechanism involving the binding of Ca 2C -calmodulin. As a result, it appears that many of the same functional roles that basic-aromatic clusters have in peripheral membrane proteins may exist in integral membrane proteins.",

These peptides have gained considerable attention for their potential in drug delivery.

However, McLaughlin and co-workers found that labeling MARCKS(151-175) with Texas-Red, a large hydrophobic fluorescent label, allows the peptide to rapidly penetrate the outer membranes of giant vesicles [36] . As with the other cell permeant peptides, the detailed mechanism is not known [28, 37] . However, Cunningham et al. [38] observed that attaching a hydrophobic fluorescent probe, rhodamine B, to a basic peptide corresponding to a region of gelsolin allows the peptide to cross the cell membrane as well. In contrast, attaching a hydrophilic fluorescent label (Alexa-488) to the MARCKS(151-175) peptide does not confer cell permeation. It is important to note that many of the studies described in this review make use of large hydrophobic fluorescent labels to track the location of peptides with basic-aromatic clusters. These labels are generally aromatic systems, much like tryptophan, and the observations on their ability to facilitate membrane permeation emphasizes the importance of aromatic residues in basic-aromatic clusters, as well as raising a concern about how these fluorescent tags influence the behavior of the labeled peptide.",

The transmembrane segment anchors the envelope protein to the viral membrane, while a fusion-induced conformational change allows the fusion peptide to insert into the host cell membrane [65] . Crystal structures of the soluble ectodomains of several fusion proteins [66] suggest that the long hydrophilic sequence intervening between these hydrophobic segments serves to bring the host and viral membranes into close proximity. In both the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) type I [67] and the coronavirus [68] , the aromatic-rich juxtamembrane region has been implicated in the fusion of viral and host cell membranes.

There is a similar requirement for curvature in the formation of membrane vesicles. For example, endocytic clathrin-coated vesicles are one of the best characterized systems that have highly curved membranes [71] . There are several clathrin binding proteins (epsin, amphiphysin, and endophilin) that have the ability to induce curvature in membrane vesicles without clathrin [72] . Epsin induces curvature via an amphipathic a-helix that inserts into the cytosolic leaflet of the lipid bilayer via a PI(4,5)P 2 -dependent mechanism [73] . Amphiphysin and endophilin induce curvature primarily through electrostatic interactions between the positively charged concave surface of a Bin/amphiphysin/Rvs (BAR) domain and the negatively charged membrane. BAR domains form 'banana-shaped' dimers with clusters of basic residues on the concave surface [74, 75] . Interestingly, several BAR domains have an amphipathic helix at their N-terminus, which increases their ability to induce membrane curvature [76] . Lee et al. [77] have recently shown that the N-terminal amphipathic a-helix (MAGWDIFGWFRDVL) of Sar1p inserts into membranes and induces synthetic vesicles to form narrow tubules. Sar1p is a small GTPase and one of five core COPII proteins in COPII-coated transport vesicles. Substitution of the Trp or Phe residues with alanine within the amphipathic a-helix of Sar1p blocks its ability to generate highly curved membranes.",

These cholesterol-rich lipid rafts appear to segregate and concentrate membrane proteins [83] [84] [85] . Proteins with basic-aromatic clusters have been found to bind strongly to cholesterolcontaining rafts raising the question of whether these proteins serve to nucleate microdomain formation in cells or whether existing lipid rafts tend to recruit proteins with basic-aromatic clusters [86] . Anderson has suggested that cholesterol-rich domains can form in membranes as a consequence of preferential sequestration of particular lipids as a shell surrounding membrane bound proteins [87] .

Oldfield and co-workers were the first to fully recognize that high resolution 1 H spectra of lipid membranes could be obtained using MAS [99] , while Cafiso and co-workers pioneered the use of NOESY methods combined with MAS to investigate the structure of lipid membranes [100, 101] .

Based on equilibrium dialysis of model tripeptides with a charged N-terminus and protected C-terminus, White and Wimley [110] estimated that the free energy for partitioning of the aromatic side chain of phenylalanine into the head group region of 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-snglycero-3-phosphocholine (POPC) is K4.73 kJ/mol. In these model tripeptides, positively charged amino acids, e.g. lysine and arginine, have free energies of w4.19 kJ/mol for partitioning into the head group region of POPC.

The resonance at 3.4 ppm marked with an asterisk results from the b-CH 2 group of the phenylalanine side chain. The short (50 ms) mixing time limits spin diffusion and the spectrum indicates that the aromatic side chain is located in the region of the choline head group, as expected. When the mixing time is increased to 300 ms (Fig. 3b) , additional intense resonances occur at 4.7 and 1.3 ppm, which are assigned to water and the lipid acyl chain CH 2 resonances, respectively. The observation of cross peaks between the aromatic protons of the phenylalanine methyl ester and protons on the lipid acyl chains suggests that spin diffusion occurs at longer mixing times. In order to illustrate how aromatic amino acids partition into membrane interfaces in the context of a peptide sequence, Fig. 4 shows rows taken from the 2D MAS-1 H NOESY spectra of a model basic-aromatic peptide, Ac-KKFSFKK-NH 2 , containing two phenylalanines and four lysines. As in Fig. 3 , the rows correspond to the position of the aromatic proton resonances of the phenylalanines and were obtained with mixing times of 50 ms (a) and 300 ms (b). The N-and C-termini are protected in order to address how the peptide sequence might behave in the context of a membrane protein domain, and the spectra were obtained of the peptide bound to DMPC:DMPG model membranes. With a mixing time of 50 ms, cross peaks are observed between the aromatic protons of the peptide and the lipid acyl chain protons. These data indicate that the aromatic rings of phenylalanine in the seven-residue peptide are more deeply inserted into the membrane bilayer than those of the phenylalanine methyl ester model compound.",

Fig. 5 presents rows at the position of the aromatic proton resonances from 2D MAS-1 H NOESY spectra of MARCKS(151-175) bound to DMPC:DMPG model membranes. As above, the NOESY spectra were obtained with mixing times of 50 ms (a) and 300 ms (b). Remarkably, the 50 ms spectrum exhibits an intense cross peak between the aromatic protons and the lipid acyl chain protons. These data indicate that the aromatic rings of the phenylalanines penetrate the model membrane to below the level of the acyl chain carbonyls. The location of the MARCKS effector domain deep in the membrane is supported by EPR measurements of Cafiso and co-workers [111] . Importantly, replacing the five phenylalanine residues in the MARCKS(151-175) peptide with alanines shifts the equilibrium binding position of the peptide more than 10 \u00c5 so that it resides in the aqueous phase [112] . It is estimated that the deep penetration of the aromatic rings of the five phenylalanines increases the affinity of MARCKS(151-175) with bilayer membranes by a factor of 10-100 [23, 111, 113] .",

            "text": "The differences in the NOESY spectra between these three different basic-aromatic model systems demonstrate the ability of this approach to establish the depth of the peptides in membrane bilayers. The differences are most dramatic when comparing the spectra obtained with a 50 ms mixing time; the 50 ms spectrum of phenylalanine methyl ester exhibits no intensity in the cross peak region corresponding to the lipid acyl chain protons, whereas the 50 ms spectrum of the MARCKS(151-175) peptide exhibits almost no intensity in the cross peak region corresponding to the protons of the phospholipids head group. The influence of spin diffusion can be quantified by measuring the buildup of cross peak intensity as a function of the mixing time [107] . Fig. 6 presents a plot of the intensities of the acyl chain CH 2 resonance at 1.3 ppm as a function of the NOESY mixing time for phenylalanine methyl ester and MARCKS(151-175). The slight negative curvature for the buildup curve of the phenylalanine methyl ester suggests that magnetization transfer between the aromatic protons and the lipid acyl chains results from spin diffusion [107] . In contrast, the rapid rise of the NOE buildup curve for MARCKS indicates the Phe rings are in direct contact with the lipid acyl chains [107] . One of the striking observations that emerges from the NMR studies on the MARCKS peptide is that the aromatic rings of the phenylalanine side chains are located within the hydrophobic core of the bilayer. This contrasts with both the small molecule studies of White and Gawrisch related to Trp and the preference for Trp and Tyr at the ends of transmembrane helical segments in membrane proteins of known structure [103] . Phenylalanine has a much higher occurrence in the transmembrane segments of membrane proteins than either tyrosine or tryptophan [5] . In an elegant study on the preferred position of Trp and Phe in membrane bilayers, Braun and von Heijne [114] found that Phe, but not Trp, is accommodated in the hydrophobic core of the bilayer when inserted into a poly-Leu transmembrane helix. Moreover, measurements on the partitioning of benzene into bilayers shows that there is no preference for benzene partitioning into either the interfacial or hydrophobic core regions of the bilayer [115, 116] .",

            "text": "The position of the charged residues relative to the low dielectric interior of the bilayer raises an important issue concerning electrostatics. The aromatic amino acids in basicaromatic clusters may influence the electrostatic interactions with the membrane surface [110] by dragging the positive charge on the flanking lysine and arginine side chains deeper into the polar head group so they can interact more effectively with the negative lipid charges (e.g. on the PI(4,5)P 2 or phosphotidylglycerol (PG) head groups). The electrostatic potential extending from the positively charged residues would be expected to increase substantially as the charge approaches the low dielectric membrane surface. Electrostatic calculations on a simple ion of charge q at an idealized membrane-water interface show that if ions are excluded from the membrane phase, then the potential at the membrane interface extends much further than it would for the same charge in bulk water [119] . In fact, the electrostatic potential at a distance r from an ion at a low dielectric interface is twice that predicted by Debye-H\u00fcckel theory for an identical ion in the bulk aqueous phase. This increase in electrostatic potential enhances the ability of the basic-aromatic peptides to sequester PI(4,5)P 2 . For example, MARCKS(151-175) is able to electrostatically sequester PI(4,5)P 2 with high selectivity (w1000 fold) over monovalent acidic lipids, such as phosphatidylserine [120] . The high selectivity is predicted from the high valence (K4) of PI(4,5)P 2 and the Boltzmann factor associated with the MARCKS(151-175)-PI(4,5)P 2 interaction [80] .",

Several reviews are available on these methods [41, 121] . The structure determination of gramicidin A in membrane bilayers was a tour de force of solid-state NMR spectroscopy using this approach [44] . This approach has also been applied to the M2 peptide studies by Cross and co-workers [122] . M2 has a hydrophobic transmembrane helix and N-terminal amphipathic helix containing a basic-aromatic cluster. The amphipathic helix lies approximately parallel to the surface of the membrane with several phenylalanines penetrating into the hydrophobic core of the membrane. Hong and co-workers have used 13 C and 15 N chemical shifts to determine the orientation of protegrin 1 in lipid bilayers [123] . The orientation favors interaction of the hydrophobic backbone of the peptide with the hydrophobic core of the bilayer and positions the cationic arginine side chains to interact with the anionic phosphate groups.",

In the next two sections, we discuss solid-state 31 P and 2 H NMR studies used to determine how these clusters influence the bilayer structure. Both 31 P and 2 H NMR have been standard approaches for characterizing membrane structure and dynamics for over 30 years. Reviews have focused on both lipid systems (e.g. [130] ) and lipid-protein interactions [131] [132] [133] [134] As a simple introduction to 31 P NMR, Fig. 7 shows static and MAS 31 P spectra of DMPC:DMPG bilayers containing the bound basic-aromatic model peptide, Ac-KKFSFKK-NH 2 , described above. The static 31 P spectrum exhibits an axially symmetric lineshape resulting from axial diffusion of the lipids (Fig. 7a) . The DMPC and DMPG lipids have slightly different lineshapes giving rise to the observed splitting in the static spectrum. In the 31 P spectrum obtained with MAS, the anisotropic chemical shift interactions are averaged resulting in sharp features at the isotropic chemical shifts for DMPC and DMPG (the dashed line in Fig. 7b shows the spectra of DMPC:DMPG bilayers without bound peptide). Binding of the Ac-KKFSFKK-NH 2 peptide produces a distribution of chemical shifts for both DMPC and DMPG (solid line, Fig. 7b ). 31 P measurements can also be made on oriented bicelles. These spectra provide information on both the orientation and the environment of the lipid head groups. Bicelles are typically composed of a mixture of long chain (DMPC and DMPG) and short chain (DHPC) lipids. The molar ratio (or q-value) of the long to short chain lipids determines the morphology of the bicelle [135] . Isotropic bicelles are formed with a ratio of 1:1 (or lower), while oriented bicelles are formed with a molar ratio of w3:1 (or higher). 31 P spectra of oriented membrane bicelles titrated with the MARCKS effector domain peptide are shown in Fig. 8 . The bicelles have a q value of 4. The ratio of DMPC and DMPG to DHPC is 4:1, while the ratio of neutral DMPC to DMPG is 3:1. The 31 P spectrum is sensitive to the orientation of the phosphate head group of the three phospholipids; three distinct resonances are observed corresponding to the 31 P group of DMPC (K5 ppm), DMPG (K2 ppm) and DHPC (2-3 ppm).",

Fig. 9 presents 31 P spectra of the Antp(43-58) peptide bound to model membrane bicelles having the same composition as in Fig. 8 [136] . As Antp (43) (44) (45) (46) (47) (48) (49) (50) (51) (52) (53) (54) (55) (56) (57) (58) is titrated into this system, the chemical shift of the DMPC resonance does not change. In contrast, the DMPG resonance changes from K1.74 to K0.27 ppm, moving closer to the resonance from DHPC. The dramatic shift of the 31 P resonance of DMPG can be caused by a change in the orientation of the DMPG head group or by a change in the local electrostatic environment. The 31 P MAS spectrum of unoriented membrane bicelles is very similar to that shown for DMPC:DMPG (dashed line) in Fig. 7 , which means that the 31 P chemical shift is not due to local electrostatic interactions. Instead, this argues that the observed DMPG shifts are due to a change in the headgroup orientation.",

            "text": "The Ab42 peptide associated with Alzheimer's disease is yet another example of how peptides with basic and aromatic amino acids can interact with biological membranes. Ab42 is derived from amino acids 672 to 713 of the amyloid precursor protein (APP). Most gene mutations that are associated with the inherited forms of Alzheimer's disease cause an increase in the ratio of Ab42 over shorter Ab peptides. APP is cleaved at Asp672 in the extracellular domain by b-secretase and at Ala713 within the transmembrane domain by g-secretase [137, 138] . The mechanism of toxicity has been variously attributed to the formation of ion pores [139] [140] [141] [142] , direct destabilization of membranes [143] [144] [145] [146] or to permeation through neuronal cells and inhibition of cellular enzymes such as alcohol dehydrogenase [147] . There have consequently been several studies using solid-state NMR to establish how this peptide interacts with membranes [148] [149] [150] [151] . 31 P spectra of the Ab42 peptide bound to membrane bicelles having the same composition as in Figs. 8 and 9 are shown in Fig. 10 . Remarkably, the influence of Ab42 binding on the 31 P spectrum is different than for both the MARCKS and Antp (43) (44) (45) (46) (47) (48) (49) (50) (51) (52) (53) (54) (55) (56) (57) (58) peptides. Binding of Ab42 results in a broadening of the 31 P linewidths with the most dramatic change occurring for DMPG. However, the chemical shifts of the 31 P resonances do not change dramatically indicating that the bilayer structure of the bicelles remains intact. Consistent with these results, Seelig and co-workers [148] used 31 P NMR of membrane vesicles to show that the bilayer structure is not disrupted by the Ab40 peptide. Moreover, using 2 H NMR they found no change in the conformation of the choline headgroup or in the ordering of the hydrocarbon chains. As a result, they concluded that Ab40 binds electrostatically to the outer envelope of the polar headgroup region without penetrating the membrane interface.",

In 2D 31 P-EXSY solid-state NMR spectra, cross-peak intensity appears when there is a change of orientation during the mixing time. The b-purothionin protein is found to decrease the lateral diffusion of the DMPG and may act as an obstacle to the lipid diffusion. Auger and co-workers also suggest that the presence of b-purothionin significantly modifies the lipid packing at the surface of the bilayer, which in turn increases the accessibility of water molecules in the interfacial region.",

The peptide strongly perturbs the polar head group region in order to penetrate into the acyl chain region of the membrane. As the aromatic rings become buried in the hydrophobic core of the membrane, the lipid head groups are pushed aside by the backbone and the side chains of the peptide. Monolayer studies demonstrate that the increase in the surface pressure is small (0.3 mN/m) for w1 MARCKS(151-175) peptide bound per 100 lipids, but increases markedly as the number of peptides bound per unit area increases. Hence binding would be expected to result in significant membrane curvature in regions of the cell membrane where MARCKS is concentrated. Membrane curvature is critical for endocytotic vesicle formation, a process that is often mediated by proteins that specifically interact with PI(4,5)P 2 [155] . MARCKS is concentrated in regions of cells associated with inward curvature, such as the nascent phagosomes of macrophages Fig. 10 . 31 P spectra of membrane bicelles containing the Ab42 peptide associated with Alzheimer's disease. The molar ratio of DMPC to DMPG to DHPC is 10:3:3.25, and the bicelles were titrated with Ab42 peptide in molar ratios of peptide to lipid from 0:400 to 4:400. The temperature was maintained at 27 8C. 31 P chemical shifts are referenced to external 85% H 3 PO 4 . Spectra were obtained at a 31 P frequency of 283.4 MHz. [156, 157] . The combination of 31 P with 1 H and 2 H NMR (below) may be sufficient to distinguish between membrane curvature and local membrane disruption.",

The deep penetration of the MARCKS peptide due to the aromatic groups may be responsible for cholesterol sequestration since parallel experiments with pentalysine show no change in the deuterium quadrupolar splittings (unpublished results). The sequestration may be a response to the local disruption of the bilayer (where the cholesterol is somehow filling in the gaps in the membrane created by peptide binding) or may be due to an interaction with the negatively charged PG lipids that are attracted to the positively charged MARCKS (as suggested by Anderson [87] in his lipid-shell mechanism for membrane domain formation).",

            "text": "The diversity of ways that basic-aromatic clusters can interact with membranes is remarkable. This review only scratches the surface of what may be one of the least understood areas of cell biology. Besides simply binding to membranes and inducing a change in structure, the interactions of basic-aromatic clusters with membranes are often regulated. For instance, membrane interactions of many proteins, including MARCKS, are regulated by phosphorylation. In MARCKS, phosphorylation of serine residues within its basic-aromatic cluster introduces a negatively charged phosphate that lowers the binding affinity of the cluster for negatively charged membranes. The binding of other basicaromatic clusters is regulated by protein-protein interactions, such as interaction with Ca 2C -calmodulin [24] . As a result, the cell biology that relies on the specific ways that proteins influence membrane structure is both complex and dynamic. NMR methods that provide high-resolution information on both structure and dynamics are well suited for these types of systems. The membrane environment is an integral part of the system and consequently these problems are not amenable to protein crystallography.",

            "text": "(i) Membrane protein structure. One of the themes that emerges from this review is that the structure of the basic-aromatic cluster often determines the mechanism of membrane binding and interaction. Basic-aromatic clusters can be contained in amphipathic helices, b-sheets, and structure loops, as well as being part of natively unstructured proteins. Moreover, the secondary structure of the cluster can be induced upon membrane binding. It is important to note that besides secondary structure, the function of basicaromatic clusters often depends on the tertiary and quaternary structure (or oligomeric state) of the peptides or proteins involved. In addition, local cation-p interactions between the positively charged side chains of basic amino acids and the aromatic rings of Trp, Phe and Tyr may play a role in the ability of basic residues to partition into the membrane interface. NMR has a tremendous advantage over CD and IR spectroscopy in terms of establishing to high resolution the local structure and the interactions of basicaromatic clusters in lipid bilayers. (ii) Membrane structure. There is a vast body of literature on using 31 P and 2 H NMR to characterize the structure and dynamics of lipid membranes. The challenges posed by the complex and dynamic nature of membranes and how they respond to membrane-associated proteins is illustrated in the three examples presented in the 31 P section: MARCKS, AntP, and Ab42. These proteins all contain basic and aromatic residues, yet binding to membrane bilayers results in each case in unique changes in the 31 P spectrum. These changes likely originate from electrostatic interactions between the basic amino acids and the negatively charged DMPG lipids. However, the nature of the interactions must be different for the different basicaromatic clusters. (iii) Lipid-protein interactions. There is also a substantial literature on using NMR to characterize lipid-protein interactions. Over the past few years there has been a resurgence of interest in how membrane proteins influence membrane structure, and a recognition that the interactions can be subtle and specific. Biophysics has much to offer in way of understanding the cell biology that relies on these interactions. Moreover, cell membranes are increasingly being viewed as proteinrich environments able to form distinct microdomains that direct cellular processes. The recent proposal by Anderson [87] that lipid shells are involved in the formation of microdomains in membranes is an excellent example. The challenge for the future is to develop NMR approaches that move beyond model systems and capture the complexity and dynamics of cellular membranes.",

This observation is consistent with the sequestration of cholesterol by the MARCKS(151-175) peptide since binding of MARCKS(151-175) to DMPC:DMPG:cholesterol membranes should actually increase the observed quadrupolar splittings if cholesterol were not sequestered. This conclusion is supported by 1 H NOESY-MAS measurements that show the MARCKS(151-175) peptide inserts as deeply into",
