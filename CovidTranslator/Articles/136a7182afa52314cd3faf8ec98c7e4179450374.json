            "text": "Severe and fatal viral infections remain common after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Adoptive transfer of cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) specific for Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), cytomegalovirus (CMV), and adenoviral antigens can treat infections that are impervious to conventional therapies, but broader implementation and extension to additional viruses is limited by competition between virus-derived antigens and time-consuming and laborious manufacturing procedures. We now describe a system that rapidly generates a single preparation of polyclonal (CD4 + and CD8 + ) CTLs that is consistently specific for 15 immunodominant and subdominant antigens derived from 7 viruses (EBV, CMV, Adenovirus (Adv), BK, human herpes virus (HHV)-6, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), and Influenza) that commonly cause post-transplant morbidity and mortality. CTLs can be rapidly produced (10 days) by a single stimulation of donor peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) with a peptide mixture spanning the target antigens in the presence of the potent prosurvival cytokines interleukin-4 (IL4) and IL7. This approach reduces the impact of antigenic competition with a consequent increase in the antigenic repertoire and frequency of virusspecific T cells. Our approach can be readily introduced into clinical practice and should be a cost-effective alternative to common antiviral prophylactic agents for allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) recipients.",

            "text": "Although hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) may cure hematological malignancies and genetic disorders, extension to donors other than HLA-matched siblings has resulted in the emergence of viral infections as major contributors to post-transplant morbidity and mortality. [1] [2] [3] [4] With the advent of more intensive viral screening and improved detection, increasing numbers of viral pathogens have been implicated in these complications, expanding from cytomegalovirus (CMV), Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), herpes-simplex virus, Adenovirus (Adv), and BK to include human herpes virus (HHV)-6, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), parainfluenza, and influenza. 2 While pharmacological agents are standard therapy for some, they have substantial toxicities, generate resistant variants, are frequently ineffective and do not provide long-term protection. 5, 6 Restoration of virus-specific immunity offers an attractive alternative to conventional drugs. We have shown that in vitro expanded virus-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) generated from stem cell donors with specificity for one (EBV), two (EBV and Adv), or three (EBV, CMV, and Adv) viruses are safe and effectively prevent and treat viral infection or disease in the HSCT setting. [7] [8] [9] More recently, banked, partially HLA-matched virus-specific CTL (3rd party CTLs) are showing promise in allograft recipients with advanced viral disease. 10 Despite these encouraging clinical results broader implementation of T cell therapy is restricted by (i) the limited spectrum of viruses that can be effectively targeted in a single T cell line and (ii) the logistics of manufacture. Antigenic competition between high and low frequency T cells as well as between multiple antigens expressed at different levels and competing for presentation on shared antigen-presenting cells (APCs) may favor generation of lines dominated by responses to a single virus or to a restricted spectrum of viral antigens, 11, 12 thus limiting the antiviral coverage provided by a single T cell product. In addition, our current manufacturing process is complex, requiring infectious virus material (EBV/Adv), production of a clinical grade vector, and prolonged (10-12 weeks) in vitro culture. 8, 9 To address this latter problem some groups have evaluated more rapid approaches for producing T cell products for adoptive transfer. These include multimer selection to directly isolate virus-specific CD8 + T cells from peripheral blood, 13 as well as the selection of cells based on cytokine production [interferon (IFN )] or expression of activation markers (e.g., CD154) following antigen exposure. [14] [15] [16] However, these approaches are expensive, require a large starting blood volume, which is not always available, particularly in the matched unrelated donor setting, and cannot be applied to viruses with low circulating T cell precursor frequencies.",

In exploratory experiments PBMCs were simulated with a pepmix (peptide library of overlapping 15mers) spanning the immunodominant CMV-pp65 antigen, then expanded without cytokines, or with media supplemented with (i) interleukin-15 (IL15) (5 ng/ml), (ii) IL2 (20 U/ml), or (iii) IL4 (1,666 U/ml) + IL7 (10 ng/ml).

Cultures supplemented with IL15 or IL4+7 showed the greatest overall expansion (5 0.6 and 3.7 0.5-fold increase, respectively) over 9 days (n = 5). Cultures that were stimulated in the absence of cytokines did not expand (0.6 0.04), while the IL2 condition was intermediate (2.7 0.1) (Figure 1a) . To determine whether the superior cell numbers were a consequence of improved T cell proliferation, enhanced survival, or the combination, cells were labeled with CFSE on day 0 and then analyzed every 2-3 days to measure cell doubling, while live and apoptotic/necrotic cells were distinguished by Annexin-PI staining (data not shown). Flow cytometric analysis demonstrated no difference in the number of cell divisions from day 0-5. However, from day 5 onward cells cultured in cytokines continued to divide, whereas in their absence, cell division was reduced and viability was consistently lower (Figure 1b) . These data suggest that the improved survival of proliferating cells made the primary contribution to the observed increase in cell numbers in cytokine-supplemented cultures.",

To determine whether antigenic competition would preclude pooling we segregated the pepmixes and stimulated PBMCs with minipools-containing pepmixes from (i) each virus; (ii) immunodominant (CMV, RSV, Flu, HHV6) and (Figure 5a) . There was no difference in either the rate of expansion (Supplementary Figure S4) , the overall specificity or magnitude of the response directed against each antigen, irrespective of the composition of the stimulating pepmix pool (Figure 5b) . Thus, all further studies used the mastermix (condition D). Figure 5c shows eight additional CTL lines with consistent multivirus specificity. The highest responses were seen against CMV-pp65 and Adv-Hexon (951. (Figure 5c) . The lines were polyclonal and polyfunctional with activity against the stimulating viruses detectable in both CD4 + and CD8 + fractions (Figure 5d) , and reactive cells produced both IFN and TNF after stimulation, a profile associated with superior in vivo activity. 20, 21 Figure 5e shows the results for one representative donor in whom 63% of all Adv, 55% of CMV, 40% of EBV, 46% of RSV, 36% of Influenza, and 28% of HHV6-specific CTLs produced both IFN and TNF after antigenic stimulation. Intracellular cytokine staining for IFN and/or TNF in a total of six CTL lines generated and screened showed that 67.7 13.3% of all T cells in multivirus cultures were antigen-specific (data not shown). This percentage is likely an underestimate since some virus-specific CTLs do not produce cytokines or produce effector cytokines other than IFN and TNF . Finally, even though these CTLs had received only a single stimulation there was no evidence of alloreactivity, assessed by Cr 51 release assay using HLA-mismatched PHA blasts as targets (Supplementary Figure S5) , an important consideration if these cells are to be used for the treatment of allogeneic HSCT recipients.

            "text": "We have shown that we can rapidly generate polyclonal, CD4 + and CD8 + T cells with specificities directed to a wide range of lytic and latent viruses responsible for infection in the immunocompromised host and after HSCT. These cells were Th1-polarized, had high avidity for a multiplicity of individual viral antigens, produced multiple effector cytokines upon stimulation, and killed virus-infected targets without alloreactivity. Because we generated these T cells using combinations of clinically available peptide libraries and prosurvival cytokines, our approach should be well suited to clinical application. While CMV, EBV, and Adv are the most frequently detected viral infections following allogeneic HSCT, recipients are also susceptible to numerous other viruses, including BK, JC, HHV6, HHV7, influenza, parainfluenza, coronavirus, and RSV, all of which may cause severe morbidity and mortality. 1,2 Several of these viruses are usually seasonally detected (e.g., influenza, RSV) while others, such as HHV7, JC, and coronavirus, are infrequent, so that it is impracticable to cover all these pathogens post-transplant by generating individualized patient and single virus-specific T cell products. Hence, we sought to develop a strategy that would enable the production of a single CTL line with simultaneous specificity for a multiplicity of antigens, which were chosen based on their T cell stimulatory capacity and protective nature in our own studies (refs. 8,9,18,22,23 and U. Gerdemann, L. Keukens, J.H. Keirnan, U.L. Katari, C.T.Q. Ngugen, A.P. de Pagtee et al., manuscript submitted) and in those from other groups. 13, 15, 19, [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] [31] [32] In our present clinical trials of virus-specific T cells, we have used EBV-LCL, adenovectors and/or viral antigen-encoding DNA plasmids to generate virus-directed T cells. [8] [9] 33 The use of fulllength antigen ensures that CTL can be generated from all donors, irrespective of HLA, and that the antigen is physiologically processed by APCs and produces CTLs that recognize multiple CD4 + and CD8 + T cell epitopes and have sufficient avidity to kill virusinfected targets. The induction of lines that recognize multiple epitopes also minimizes virus escape due to epitope loss and produces potent and sustained antiviral activity in vivo. 34 However, the requirements for live virus/vectors are barriers to broader and late phase clinical studies, and also limit the number of pathogens to which a single T cell line can be directed. 8, 9 We therefore evaluated whether clinically applicable pepmixes could be used as an alternative. Though clinical studies using minimal epitope peptides as vaccines have resulted in immune tolerance or the activation of low avidity T cells, Melief and colleagues recently demonstrated improved results with long (22-45aa) peptides containing both CD4 + and CD8 + epitope sequences. 35 They observed that these long peptides were processed endogenously, presented to T cells by APCs, and induced both helper and cytotoxic T cells, resulting in robust and effective CTL responses. 35 Based on these data, we chose to use a whole antigen source in the form of overlapping peptide libraries, but for optimal induction of polyclonal CTL we compared peptides of different lengths (15mers, 20mers, and 30mers) for stimulation. When using Hexon, which is predominantly recognized by CD4 + T cells, as a model antigen we saw no difference in the phenotype, specificity or epitope breadth of our lines. However, Maecker and colleagues found that 20mers were suboptimal for activating pp65-directed CD8 + T cells. 36 Thus, though still rather controversial, the optimal length of peptide for the activation of T cell lines containing both CD4 + and CD8 + cells appears to be 15aa. This analysis also highlights the differences between delivering peptides as a vaccine, where one relies on endogenous APCs to take up and process antigen versus in vitro T cell activation using professional APCs within PBMCs at optimal effector:target ratios, where peptides are either endogenously processed or edited by exoproteases following binding to cell surface HLA molecules. [37] [38] [39] [40] Given the ready clinical availability of pepmixes containing 15mer peptides that cover all possible CD8 + and the majority of CD4 + epitopes, we substituted this antigen source and were able to demonstrate equivalency to \"conventionally generated\" CTLs with respect to both epitope specificity and avidity.",

            "text": "We next addressed how best to extend the breadth of antigen/ epitope specificities that could be accommodated within a single CTL line. Physiologically, T cells are activated when they receive signals from T-cell receptor stimulation (signal 1), costimulation (signal 2), and cytokines (signal 3). Our \"conventional CTLs\" are activated in the absence of exogenous cytokines, a deficit that appears to adversely affect their proliferative capacity in vitro and also increases their susceptibility to activation-induced cell death, likely resulting in a more restricted repertoire of epitope recognition. Consistent with this possibility, we found that both the frequency and breadth of cells with viral specificity could be increased by supplementing cultures with inflammatory and prosurvival cytokines at initiation. We chose to test cytokines that support cell proliferation in vitro and in vivo (IL2, IL15), 41, 42 as well as combinations (IL4+7) that also support the retention of a central memory phenotype, and promote the survival of activated T cells by upregulation of anti-apoptotic molecules e.g., Bcl-2. [43] [44] [45] [46] Only lines supplemented with IL4+7 selectively promoted the expansion and survival of both CD4 + and CD8 + virus-specific T cells recognizing multiple epitopes, a combination that should favor the subsequent sustained expansion of transferred cells in vivo. 34 Of note, the induced cells were Th1polarized despite exposure to IL4, a prototypic Th2 cytokine. Given the clinical availability of both cytokines and their safety in human clinical trials, 47,48 IL4+7 fulfilled the requirements of the current study, however, other proinflammatory cytokines capable of mimicking the milieu present during viral infection may produce similar benefits. For example, von Rossum and colleagues recently reported that CD3/28-activated CD8 + T cells cultured in an inflammatory cocktail consisting of IL1+IL6+IL23 underwent significantly less cell death after activation as compared with cells activated in any of the cytokines alone or activated in the presence of IL12. 49 The direct stimulation of PBMCs with pepmixes and culture in cytokine-supplemented conditions also allowed us to overcome a second major barrier to increasing the spectrum of viruses targeted in a single CTL line, namely antigenic competition resulting from the use of a common APC to simultaneously present multiple antigenic components from different viruses. 8, 9 Antigenic competition results both from limited access of peptides to HLA molecules and physical constraints on the simultaneous stimulation of both high and low frequency T cells. 11, 12 To overcome these issues, investigators have used artificial APCs that are engineered with molecules to provide the necessary T-cell receptor and co-stimulatory events required for immune synapse formation. 50 However, to avoid the inevitable complexities and costs of introducing a gene-modified cellular product into the manufacturing process, we evaluated whether patient PBMCs themselves could act as both a source of antigenpresenting and responding cells. B cells, monocytes and macrophages may all have the capacity to present antigen to T cells and these APCs can utilize endo-and exopeptidases to liberate class I or class II epitopes from 15mer peptides. By taking advantage of these properties, we can avoid reliance on a single APC endogenously expressing multiple antigens at different levels as a shared T cell stimulator, and instead have a diverse group of APCs in which each cell has the potential to display a diverse repertoire of peptides, allowing sufficient access for both high and low frequency T cells. Thus, antigenic competition both within the APC and between T cells could be alleviated. As proof of principal we generated a single culture of T cells with reactivity for 15 antigens derived from 7 latent and lytic viruses (EBV, CMV, BK, HHV6, Adv, Flu, and RSV) using pooled pepmixes as a stimulus and saw no evidence of competition. Additional pathogens may be included in this platform, although ultimately APC numbers will likely eventually become limiting, thus additions must be performed in a stepwise manner and one must evaluate changes in the frequency and breadth of T cell recognition of all peptides in the mix.",

Finally Streptavidin-Phycoerythrin was added for 30 minutes at room temperature, then samples were washed and analyzed using the Luminex 200 instrument. Samples were run in duplicate.",

After activation PBMCs were pooled and transferred to the G-Rex10 (15 \u00d7 10 6 /G-Rex). After 10 days the specificity of the CTL lines generated using these 4 pooling strategies were analyzed using interferon (IFN ) ELISpot assay as readout and individual pepmixes as a stimulus.
