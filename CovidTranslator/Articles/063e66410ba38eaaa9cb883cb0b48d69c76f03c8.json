We used total RNA sequencing (\"meta-transcriptomics\") to reveal the full spectrum of microbes associated with paediatric ARI. Throat swabs were collected from 48 paediatric ARI patients and 7 healthy controls. Samples were subjected to meta-transcriptomics to determine the presence and abundance of viral, bacterial, and eukaryotic pathogens, and to reveal mixed infections, pathogen genotypes/subtypes, evolutionary origins, epidemiological history, and antimicrobial resistance. We identified 11 RNA viruses, 4 DNA viruses, 4 species of bacteria, and 1 fungus. While most are known to cause ARIs, others, such as echovirus 6, are rarely associated with respiratory disease. Co-infection of viruses and bacteria and of multiple viruses were commonplace (9/48), with one patient harboring 5 different pathogens, and genome sequence data revealed large intra-species diversity. Expressed resistance against eight classes of antibiotic was detected, with those for MLS, Bla, Tet, Phe at relatively high abundance. In summary, we used a simple total RNA sequencing approach to reveal the complex polymicrobial infectome in ARi. this provided comprehensive and clinically informative information relevant to understanding respiratory disease.",

These patients all had final diagnoses of bronchopneumonia (37/48), pneumonia (3/48), acute upper respiratory tract infection (4/48), acute bronchitis (3/48), acute tonsillitis (2/48), or influenza (4/48) (Fig. 1) . The corresponding symptoms included fever, cough, phlegm, snivel, wheeze, and nasal obstruction. Rash, oral herpes, pharynx hyperemia, and diarrhea were observed in some cases (Fig. 1 ). characterizing total infectomes. All 55 samples (48 patients, seven controls) were examined individually using total RNA sequencing, which generated between 13.7-98.1 million reads per sample (Table S1 ).

Blastx comparisons against the nr database identified at least 15 virus species associated with human infection: 11 RNA viruses and four DNA viruses (Fig. 2 ).

Viruses with greater than 10,000 RPM (>1% of total reads) included echovirus E6 (Case 22), HRSV (Case 4), and HPIV-3 (Case 8). Such high levels of abundance suggest active replication. In comparison, picobirnaviruses, herpes simplex virus 1, and papillomaviruses were all at very low abundance (Fig. 2) . Importantly, although RNA sequencing was performed, the abundance of DNA viruses can also be quantified by estimating the abundance of the RNA transcripts they produce.

Conversely, phylogenetic analysis revealed distinct sequence clusters containing several very closely related genomes, indicating that these viruses might originate from the same outbreak in the Chinese population (Fig. 3A,D) . To exclude contamination, all metagenomic hits to influenza B viruses and HMPV were confirmed by PCR. Interestingly, the MeV sequence in patient 8 exhibited a very close phylogenetic relationship to a Chinese vaccine strain (Shanghai-191, 99.97% nucleotide identity) (Fig. 3F ): this suggests a vaccine origin, although one that has clearly replicated to high levels in this patient (702 RPM) (Fig. 2) .

In addition to those pathogens routinely screened, we were able to identify a novel fungal pathogen, a divergent variant of an atypical respiratory virus (echovirus 6), a replicating vaccine strain of measles virus, and an array of pathogens not commonly included in the PCR panels routinely used for respiratory pathogens, such as coronaviruses, rhinoviruses, and herpesviruses. Meta-transcriptomics also provided substantial additional biological information, including pathogen abundance (a marker of replication activity and infectivity), genome sequence data that informs on epidemiological and evolutionary origins, and information on antimicrobial resistance genes that will assist treatment plans.",

As might be expected given the focus on RNA 26 , meta-transcriptomics generated a much larger diversity of viruses, especially those with RNA genomes. In addition, the assays for RNA viruses are costly and time-consuming for most hospital laboratories, and there are insufficient diagnostical tests to cover the entire diversity of respiratory viruses. Conversely, more bacteria were discovered using traditional culture methods, which is also likely true of shotgun DNA sequencing-based metagenomics 32 . This suggests that RNA-based meta-transcriptomics can be subject to false-negative results in some instances. This likely occurs because metagenomic bacterial identification was based on non-rRNA genes whose RNA expression level is often relatively low 25 . However, because they may be indicative of more elevated replication, those bacteria identified by meta-transcriptomics are perhaps more likely relevant to disease manifestation.",
