            "text": "A small proportion of air travelers make disproportionately more journeys than the rest of travelers. They also tend to interact predominantly with other frequent travelers in hotels and airport lounges. This group has the potential to accelerate global spread of infectious respiratory diseases. Using an epidemiologic model, we simulated exportation of cases from severe acute respiratory syndrome-like and infl uenza-like epidemics in a population for which a small proportion travel more frequently than the rest. Our simulations show that frequent travelers accelerate international spread of epidemics only if they are infected early in an outbreak and the outbreak does not expand rapidly. If the epidemic growth rate is high, as is likely for pandemic infl uenza, heterogeneities in travel are frequently overwhelmed by the large number of infected persons in the majority population and the resulting high probability that some of these persons will take an international fl ight. I n today's world of increasing air travel for both business and pleasure, a small proportion of persons make disproportionately more journeys than the rest of the population (1, 2) . These frequent fl iers tend to travel for business purposes and mix predominantly with other business travelers, stay in particular hotels, and use specifi c airport lounges. This form of assortative (like with like) mixing means a respiratory infection could potentially spread quickly within this group and thus be disseminated rapidly between countries. This rapid spread was illustrated early in the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak of 2003. The index SARS case in Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, People's Republic of China, stayed in a hotel and infected 16 persons there. Of these patients with secondary cases, 6 took international fl ights to Australia, Canada, Singapore, the Philippines, and Vietnam (3) . The arrival of these infected persons subsequently led to SARS outbreaks in Hanoi, Singapore, and Toronto within a few days of the fi rst case in Hong Kong.",

In the early stages of an epidemic, chance events are important because the number of infected persons is small. We simulated these early stages by using a stochastic model for which every simulation is different. We present both the mean behavior of the simulations and the range of possible outcomes across a large number of simulations. In a stochastic model, introduction of 1 infected person has a fi nite probability of resulting in the rapid extinction of an infectious disease. To increase the probability of initiating an outbreak, we introduced 3 asymptomatic persons into the population. We simulated the outbreak in a large extended metropolitan area with a population of 10 7 persons.",

Similarly, the general population has contact with persons in the general population and with frequent fl iers. Contacts are more likely to be between persons within each group (frequent fl iers or general population), but the level of this assortativeness may vary (parameterized by \u03c6). Contacts may be made completely randomly, with the likelihood of meeting a person from the frequent-fl ying group or the general population being proportional to the number of persons in each population (\u03c6 = 1). At the other extreme, persons may only have contact with other persons in the same group (\u03c6 = 0). The true mixing pattern is likely to lie between these 2 extremes.",

This division is similar to the basic structure used in several recent papers on the role of international travel in the spread of infectious diseases (8, 9, 12) . This model structure can be adapted to many airborne infections because it allows for an asymptomatic period, which may or may not be infectious, followed by a potentially symptomatic period during which transmission can also occur. In our stochastic model, events (such as infection or a person leaving the source area) occur by chance. For example, the time after symptom onset at which a person recovers from infection with SARS is not a fi xed quantity; rather, it is a randomly chosen time from an exponential probability distribution with a mean of 10 days. Table 1 shows the average latent and infectious periods used. The probability of leaving the country is constant for all persons ( Table 1) . The probability of a susceptible person becoming infected increases as a larger proportion of the population becomes infected and is chosen so that the average number of new infections caused by each infected person in the early stages of the epidemic is equal to the basic reproductive number R 0 (2.5 for SARS, 1.8 for infl uenza; Table 1 ). The epidemic is simulated by evaluating the probability that any person is infected, becomes symptomatic, or recovers in any short time interval (we divide time into sequential short intervals of one fi ftieth of a day), and then testing whether that event occurs. The simulation can be thought of as generating a random number between 0 and 1 for each person in each time step. If this random number is less than the probability of a particular event occurring to that person, then the event occurs. Otherwise, the person is left in his or her current state. The model does not store the details of every person separately but keeps track of the number of persons who are susceptible (S), latently infected (E), infectious (I), and recovered (R) at any point in time. As events occur, these variables change. For example, when a person becomes infected, S decreases by 1 and E increases by 1. Because the events occur by chance, the total number of persons who are in each state, including the number of infected persons taking fl ights, varies stochastically.",

We have modeled a conservative scenario, in which infl uenza has a disease life history similar to that of SARS, but with shorter latent and infectious periods ( Table 1 ).

Once the epidemic takes hold in the general population, the number of cases being exported from the majority low-frequency fl ier population exceeds those being exported from the much smaller group of high-frequency fl iers. Regardless of where most initial cases occur, the contribution of high-frequency fl iers to international spread is eventually overwhelmed by the large epidemic in the general population, despite their lower probability of fl ying per day. Thus, the average behavior of epidemics is eventually similar, whether they start in highfrequency fl iers, or in groups with no heterogeneities in travel ( Figure 2, panel B, inset) , but the variability between simulations is large ( Table 2 ; online Appendix Figure 1 ).",

The fi rst case-patient with SARS in Hong Kong had contact with other frequent travelers in a hotel and seeded the epidemic in highfrequency travelers. However, SARS has long incubation and infectious periods and only moderate transmissibility. For infl uenza A, which has much shorter incubation and infectious periods, such heterogeneities have a limited effect on the rate of exportation of cases. Because frequent travelers play a role mainly in the early stages of an epidemic, targeting interventions to these persons is unlikely to be an effective control strategy because such a plan would have to be in place almost immediately.",

When combined with the vagaries of chance early in the evolution of a new epidemic and the complexities of the international airline network, this variability makes early prediction of the pattern and speed of global spread diffi cult. This diffi culty in predicting whether a particular country is likely to import cases from a currently unknown source area highlights the need for developing a strategy for controlling an outbreak caused by imported cases.",
