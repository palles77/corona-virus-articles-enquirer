            "text": "To initiate a productive infection, all viruses must translocate their genome across the cell membrane (Reviewed by Smith and Helenius, 2004) . Enveloped viruses achieve this step by membrane fusion, a process mediated by specialized envelope proteins present at the virus surface. For coronaviruses such as the recently emerged SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV), the spike (S) glycoprotein is responsible for both cell attachment and entry by triggering fusion of the viral and cellular membrane. This type I membrane protein can be divided into two domains of similar size, S1 and S2 (Fig. 1A) . S1 forms the bulbous globular head and is responsible for cell attachment; its amino acid sequence is less conserved than S2, which forms the membrane-anchored stalk region and is responsible for membrane fusion. The coronavirus spike protein has all the essential features of a bona fide class I viral fusion protein (Smith and Helenius, 2004) , including the occurrence of two heptad repeat regions in its S2 domain (de Groot et al., 1987) . Most class I viral fusion proteins, with influenza virus hemagglutinin (HA) as a prototype (Skehel and Wiley, 2000) , are expressed as precursor proteins, which are endoproteolytically cleaved by cellular proteases, giving rise to a metastable complex of a receptor-binding subunit and a membrane fusion subunit. Upon receptor binding at the cell membrane or as a result of protonation after endocytosis, the fusion proteins undergo a dramatic conformational transition that leads to the exposure of a hydrophobic fusion peptide and insertion into the target membrane. The free energy released upon subsequent refolding of the fusion protein to its most stable conformation 0042-6822/$ -see front matter D 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved. doi:10.1016/j.virol.2005.02.022 through association of the two HR regions is believed to facilitate the close apposition of viral and cellular membranes and the subsequent lipid merger. The coronavirus spike protein has, however, some characteristics that set it apart from class I fusion proteins, such as the lack of a cleavage requirement and the presence of an internal fusion peptide. We and others have previously shown that, analogous to other class I fusion proteins, peptides corresponding to the HR regions of the mouse hepatitis coronavirus (MHV, Bosch et al., 2003) and SARS-CoV (Bosch et al., 2004; Ingallinella et al., 2004; Xu et al., 2004a; Tripet et al., 2004) can fold into a stable rod-like structure, consisting of three HR1 helices in association with three HR2 peptides in antiparallel orientation. This complex, supposedly representing the post-fusion conformation with the predicted fusion peptide upstream of HR1 and the transmembrane segment downstream of HR2 positioned at the same end, juxtaposes the cellular and viral membrane thereby facilitating membrane fusion and consequently virus entry. Here, we report our analysis of the structure of this HR1/HR2 complex of the SARS-CoV as determined by X-ray crystallography to 2.2 2 resolution. This analysis complements two recent reports (Supekar et al., The S1 and S2 regions are labeled. FP: putative fusion peptide region. TM: transmembrane region. SP: signal peptide. (B) Sequence alignments of the HR1 and HR2 regions of coronavirus spike proteins of the three different groups (G1 to G3) and the unclassified SARS coronavirus (blue arrow) using ClustalW (Thompson et al., 1994) . See the Supplementary material for the complete names of the viruses used. The numbers at the top line correspond to the SARS amino acid sequence, the structure of which is described in the text. The alignment is color-coded according to sequence conservation: red, strictly conserved; green, highly conserved; blue, conserved; black, variable. The alignment in the HR2N region was manually modified to match the structural superposition with the corresponding region of the MHV protein (PDB accession numbers 1WDF and 1WDG, Xu et al., 2004c) . Residues with ordered electron density have a grey background in the SARS line. The cloned fragment contained all residues between the boxed columns (further highlighted with a vertical empty arrow below the sequence). Two additional lines at the bottom summarize the following: the bRegisterQ line provides the abcdefg heptad repeat assignment with letters in black for the residues actually observed in a helical conformation in the structure, with the two HR1 stutters in grey background. Note the insertion of exactly two heptad repeats, both in HR1 and HR2, in the S protein of group 1 coronaviruses. The bInteractionQ line shows the two salt bridges (1 and 2, see Fig.  2B ) in a yellow background. In the case of HR1, this line provides also the residues participating in the asparagine/glutamine zipper shown in Fig. 3 (labeled bNQ), the knob-into-hole interactions with either partner within the trimer (labeled B or C), and the residues lining the central cavity shown in Fig. 2B (labeled with a star). Residues forming salt bridges 1 and 2 connecting HR1 with HR2 have a yellow background, with a number below to indicate the partner in each chain. Note that salt bridge 1 is conserved, but is sometimes made with HR1 residue 900 (from the previous helical turn) instead of 903. The structure shows that the side chain of residue 900 can contact the HR2 1188 side chain equally well. Blue background columns indicate HR1 residues interacting with the two central chloride ions. Vertical grey background columns identify HR2 residues in the extended segments (HR2N and HR2C) that pack their side chains into hydrophobic pockets in the HR1 interhelical grooves.",

Positions baQ and bdQ alternate every other turn according to the helical wheel diagram of Fig. 2D . The long HR1 a-helix does not display the typical bheptad repeatQ parameters, in which the average periodicity is 3.5 residues per turn -that is, 7 residues every two turns (Crick, 1953) -but rather displays a mean periodicity of 3.64 residues per turn, which is very close to the canonical a-helix periodicity (Pauling et al., 1951) . The baQ and bdQ positions therefore drift away from the hydrophobic core (Fig. S1 , Supplementary materials) and become out of register after several turns, effectively shifting the face of the helix that faces the hydrophobic core at the 3-fold axis. This results in the presence of bstuttersQ in which the 3-4-3-4 periodicity of the heptad repeat becomes 3-4-4-3-4 at two positions (indicated in Fig. 2A ). The helical wheel of Fig. 2D has the residues labeled along their helical positions for the 22 turns, after correction for the stutters.

Both of the independent molecules in the crystal display this feature. The oxygen atom of a water molecule does not have enough electrons to account for this extra density, and we have interpreted each of the peaks as corresponding to a bound chloride ion, which is the most common ion in all the buffers used to produce and purify the protein. Indeed, introducing a chloride ion in the model at these sites leads to refined thermal parameters (bB factorsQ) for the ion that are roughly the same as those of the surrounding amino acid side chains (about 20 2 2 ), whereas introducing a water molecule leads to abnormally low B factors.",

The sequence alignment (Fig. 1B) shows that position 923 is semi-conserved: it is threonine in about half of the sequences examined and valine in the others. Valine has a non-polar side chain of about the same volume as threonine and so is also unable to fill the cavity. Furthermore, the other residue lining the cavity, Ser 919, is often glycine or alanine in most coronaviruses, which have smaller side chains and so the corresponding proteins will have an even bigger cavity. In several group I coronaviruses, both valine and alanine are present at positions 923 and 919, in which case, the cavity will have only hydrophobic boundaries. The presence of this cavity will undoubtedly have a negative impact on the stability of the molecule, suggesting that the helical portion of HR2, which packs against the HR1 helix precisely in this region, strengthens the molecule by providing more rigidity in this weak point.",

These waters are also stabilized by lateral hydrogen bonding to the salt bridge Glu-1163 to Lys-929 (from HR2, 10th turn- Fig. 2B ). Thus, all three residues (1159, 1163 and 929-two from HR2 and one from HR1, and which are all nearly strictly conserved, see Fig. 1 ) participate indirectly in the capping of this amide group. Finally, the amide 1163 donates a hydrogen bond to the main chain carbonyl of residue 1160, in a 3/10 helix interaction.

The exposed carbonyls of the 4th turn belong to residues 1171 to 1173. The first two carbonyls are capped by Asn 1175 (strictly conserved) and Gln 917, respectively, the side chains of which also hydrogen bond to each other. The Asn 1175 side chain, a residue within the HR2 helix, thus perturbs the geometry of the helix by introducing a side chain to main chain hydrogen bond. However, Asn 1175 is part of a strictly conserved N-glycosylation site, and it is very likely that, once glycosylated, its Ny atom would not be available for hydrogen bonding to the main chain. Thus, the observed perturbation of the HR2 helix, in which the chain switches from an a to a 3/10 helix at the 4th turn, may simply be an artifact resulting from producing the protein in Escherichia coli. The third carbonyl, 1173, makes a 3/10 interaction with the amide group of residue 1176. The 3/10 5th helical turn of HR2 also exposes its carbonyl groups (1175 and 1176), the second one being capped by Gln 908 and Lys 911. Therefore, the HR2 C-cap is set in place, to an important extent, by interactions with HR1.",

The striking arrangement of conserved Asn and Gln residues, which provides a hydrogen bonding network propagating from two central ions at the 3-fold axis of the coiled coil, stretches the main chain of HR2 and results in confinement of its helical portion to only 5 turns in total at the center, capped at either side. From the amino acid sequences of many coronaviruses S proteins, it had been predicted that HR2 by itself would display at least four to five heptad repeats, which would lead to a helical region of at least 8 turns (see Fig. S2 in the Supplementary material). This prediction has been further substantiated experimentally by the high degree of a-helicity (81% for SARS-CoV and 89% for MHV) observed by circular dichroism with the HR2 peptide in the absence of HR1 (Bosch et al., 2003 (Bosch et al., , 2004 .",

Fig. 4 (compare the 1st and the 3rd panels) shows that this is not the case, as the internal HR1 coiled coil actually maintains this HR2 segment in an extended conformation all the way up to the HR1 first helical turn. The structure drawn in the second panel (1BEZ) lacked the first turns of HR1 and the C-terminal end of HR2 to provide this information, while the resolution -and thus the quality of the resulting atomic model -of the 1WNC structure (Xu et al., 2004b) was not enough for a detailed analysis of the hydrogen-bonding interactions.",

            "text": "Given the different lengths of the structures reported (Fig.  4) , a question arises concerning the actual N-terminus of the HR1 coiled-coil in the post-fusion conformation of the intact S protein. The hydrophobic cluster analysis (HCA) provided in Fig. S2 (Supplementary material) suggests that the two glycines at positions 890 and 892 are indeed likely to break the helix also in the intact molecule, as they do in the structure of the fragment reported here. Accordingly, the ahelical HCA pattern switches at this position to one of alternating polar/non-polar side-chains along the sequence, which is more typical of h-strands or extended conformations. This extended segment of the HR1 chain, of about 10 amino acids, would connect to a glycine/alanine-rich region (residues 855 to 880) that has all the characteristics of typical viral fusion peptides. This is reminiscent of the influenza virus HA2 protein in its post-fusion conformation, in which the fusion peptide -which is comprised between HA2 residues 1 to 22 -is connected to the N-terminus of the central coiled coil (at residue 38) by a segment of polypeptide for which there is visible electron density in the crystals between amino acids 33 and 38. The visible portion of the connector is in an extended conformation and provides an N-cap to the neighboring a-helix in the trimer (Chen et al., 1999) . In the present case, we see ordered electron density for residues 890 to 892 in an extended conformation (although in this case, they do not provide an N-cap to the HR1 helix). The 5 N-terminal amino acids of the construct (885 to 889) are disordered. In contrast, at the C-terminus of HR2, there is clear density in the crystals all the way to the last amino acid of the construct, Tyr 1188, with the chain ending with a single turn of a-helix between residues 1184 and 1188. Interestingly, the structure 1BEQ shows that these residues are indeed part of a longer helix (these amino acids are actually in turn 7 of the 1BEQ-HR2 helix, labeled in Fig. 4 , third panel, top) ending after turn 8 at residue 1193. It is clear from Fig. S2 that the TM region begins around amino acid 1194. The presence of one ahelical turn in our structure suggests that the HR2 chain may connect in a-helical conformation to the lipid bilayer, bringing the fused membrane to about the location drawn in Fig. 4 . It is likely that in the 1BEQ structure, the presence of the shorter HR1 segment causes the observed disruption of the HR2 helix at turns 4 and 5 (see Fig. 4 , 3rd panel, bottom) because all the elements for capping the helix at that position are present, but the downstream zipper is missing. Indeed, the residues corresponding to turn 6 in 1BEQ are seen in extended conformation in our structure, owing to the strong constrains imposed to the HR2 main chain by the central coiled coil. In the absence of HR1, HR2 could well adopt a straight a-helical conformation since there are no glycine nor proline residues in this region, which are known to be a-helix breakers. Our separate observations that in the absence of HR1, the HR2 peptide has a very high a-helical content as observed by EM and circular dichroism (Bosch et al., 2003 (Bosch et al., , 2004 argue in favor of this interpretation. Fig. 4 . Recapitulation of the current structural data on the fusion core of the SARS CoV glycoprotein S. The left panel (framed in red) displays the structure described in this report in a ribbons representation in which the three HR1 segments are in primary colors and HR2 in grey. The other three panels are labeled with the corresponding PDB accession code of the structure depicted (pdb codes 1BEQ and 1BEZ from Supekar et al., 2004, and 1WNC from Xu et al., 2004b) . In all panels, both the trimeric molecule (top) and one subunit (bottom) are displayed. All panels are colored identically, with segments containing amino acids that are not present in our current model (in the left panel) colored white. The images are all at the same scale, with the horizontal bars providing a means to align them so that the N-terminus of the HR2 helix is at the same height in each panel. The bottom panel indicates the number of the N-and Cterminal ends of the constructs represented. At the top, a roughly-to-scale diagram of a putative bfused membraneQ, with its aliphatic portion in blue and the hydrophilic lipid heads in orange, is drawn at about the expected distance from the structures, as deduced from the amino acids that are missing between the Nand C-termini and the membrane interacting segments of the protein, the N-terminal fusion peptide and the C-terminal trans-membrane region.",

            "text": "The HR1 coiled coil -or at least its N-terminal portion -is believed to form only when the fusogenic conformational change of the S protein takes place, triggered by receptor binding at the target cell surface, so that it is not present in the fusion-active conformation of the molecule at the surface of infectious virions. In the absence of the N-terminal portion of the HR1 coiled coil, the HR2 regions are likely to be part of the stalk of the S protein pre-fusion conformation, since they are connecting to the TM regions and have a strong propensity to adopt an a-helical conformation as discussed above. The pre-fusion conformation of S is trimeric (Delmas and Laude, 1990) , and it is thus likely that the a-helical HR2 segments are also part of its trimerization interface, stabilized by additional segments of this very large glycoprotein. Indeed, several (iso)leucine to alanine mutations in HR2 were shown to strongly impair oligomerization of the MHV S protein (Luo et al., 1999) . The results from the structural studies on the fusion core would therefore suggest that the prefusion arrangement of this region of the S protein is strongly disturbed and refolds after formation of the HR1 coiled coil. The rearrangement is such that presumably the pre-fusion trimer has to dissociate and then reassociate around the HR1 coiled coil. A putative transient dissociation of the pre-fusion trimer may help explain the topological problems encountered when all three subunits of a trimer are simultaneously connected to two separate membranes to then fuse them into a single lipid bilayer. It is, therefore, possible that trimer dissociation and re-association during the fusogenic conformational transition is indeed part of a more general membrane fusion mechanism, which would be valid for all class I fusion proteins.",

The presence of these polar residues within the hydrophobic cores has been proposed to provide a register to the interactions (Akey et al., 2001) , resulting in a single pattern of hydrophobic contacts, and so avoid possible miss-folding by packing of helices shifted by one or two turns along the axis of interaction.

This suggests that the residues lining the cavity in the postfusion form are important for an alternative conformation of the protein, before the fusogenic conformational change. It thus appears from the structure that the protein has been forced to evolve alternative ways to compensate for the destabilizing effect of the cavity, strengthening the molecule from the outside with the presence of the HR2 helical segment and further stabilizing the arrangement by the salt bridges and the zipping of the asparagines at either end.",

            "text": "Taken together, all of these features of the structure account for the observed relatively high stability of the (HR1/HR2) 3 complex, as indicated by its resistance to proteolytic degradation and the fact that the thermal dissociation in SDS gels is 60 8C and 80 8C for SARS-CoV and MHV, respectively (Bosch et al., 2004) . These values suggest that the melting point in the absence of SDS would be much higher, although calorimetry measurements with the proteins resulting from these constructs have not been made. In contrast to most of the class I fusion proteins that have been studied structurally until now, the coronavirus S protein is special because is does not undergo an activating cleavage near the N terminus of the fusion peptide. In influenza virus, the structural studies have shown that the conformational transition of the hemagglutinin projects the fusion peptide by a distance of 100 2 away from its original location in the metastable form of the protein. This is possible because this peptide is located at the very N-terminus of HA2, and therefore it does not carry along any upstream polypeptide segment. The situation is completely different in the case of the coronaviruses, and it is likely that the polypeptide segment preceding the fusion peptide will have to act like a rope that can follow the projection of the fusion peptide. This would imply that the segment preceding the fusion peptide does not have a very rigid and stable structure in the pre-fusion form so that it can be unwound during the conformational change. However, such flexibility is not obvious from the amino acid sequence (see the HCA pattern in Fig. S2 ), and only a structure of the pre-fusion form of the S-protein can clarify this issue. These features of the S protein suggest, however, that in order for the fusogenic conformational transition to take place, a relatively high energy barrier has to be overcome, and this process could be facilitated also by having a very low energy minimum for the final stable conformation. Finally, the structure described in this manuscript can provide a rational basis for developing potent inhibitors of entry of the SARS-CoV, by blocking the formation of the membrane-fusion core of the molecule. As shown in Fig. 3 , there are indeed a number of pockets identified along the interhelical grooves of HR1 into which putative inhibitors can be designed to bind and disturb the correct association of HR2.",
