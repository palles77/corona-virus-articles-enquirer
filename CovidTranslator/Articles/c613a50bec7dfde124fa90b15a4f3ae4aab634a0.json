The mechanisms of how viral agents affect the pathogenesis and prognosis of COPD are numerous.

Prodromal, clinical, and outcome parameters fail to distinguish virally from non-virally induced illnesses in cases of exacerbations. The importance of infections with respiratory and non-respiratory viral agents for pathogenesis and course of COPD is detailed.

These factors increase the inflammatory burden in the lower airways, overwhelming the protective anti-inflammatory defense mechanisms and thus leading to tissue damage.

These changes predispose the lower airways to bacterial infections, because they interfere with mucociliary clearance and reduce the bacterial clearance due to macrophages [3, 4] (Table 1 ). Predominance of viral or bacterial infections is neither associated with the severity of exacerbation nor with the stage of COPD. Nevertheless, viral exacerbations are associated with a higher duration of hospital stay (average 9 days) than bacterial exacerbations (average 7 days) [5] .",

In half [13, 14] to two-thirds of exacerbations, viruses are the causative pathogens. Combined bacterial and viral infection can be identified in 25% of exacerbations, and these dual infections are often more severe [1] , although this increased severity is not confirmed by all studies [4] . Neither clinical nor biological markers, e.g. procalcitonin and C-reactive protein (CRP), can reliably distinguish between virus induced exacerbation and exacerbation due to other causes [13] [14] [15] , though interleukin-6 (IL-6) is significantly increased and negatively correlated to FEV-1 (forced expiratory volume within 1 s) in virus-induced exacerbations, indicating a relation between virus-induced inflammation and airway obstruction [16] . While single virus species are frequently detectable in stable COPD patients, detection of more than one virus species is usually associated with exacerbations. In general, viruses are more commonly detectable in patients with more severe airways disease [17] . Further optimization of vaccination and antiviral treatment might increase the prognosis of individuals with chronic respiratory disease [18] .",

            "text": "Latent HAdV infections play an important role in the pathogenesis of COPD [23] . Double-stranded DNA viruses like HAdV are able to persist in epithelial airway cells long after the acute infection has been cleared. The E1A region of the adenoviral genome and the adenoviral E1A protein remain stable in these cells. During such latent infections, viral genes are expressed at the protein level without replication of complete virions [3] . E1A protein can be detected more often in patients with COPD than in healthy subjects [23] . The E1A region of adenoviruses was found in epithelial cells of 27% of COPD and chronic bronchitis patients, but not in patients with asthma and normal volunteers in China. Furthermore, E1A DNA was detected in 50% of COPD patients but only in 8% of patients with chronic bronchitis [24] . Newer data suggest that adenovirus E1A DNA is merely infrequently detectable in respiratory secretions from patients with COPD. Adenovirus can be detected with similar frequencies in exacerbated and clinically stable COPD patients [25] .",

The infection leads to independent increases in the number of CD8 cells, whereas cigarette smoke leads to higher numbers of CD4 cells in the inflammatory infiltrate. A latent infection with adenoviral agents also causes steroid resistance of the eosinophilic component of an allergic inflammatory response [3] . Adenoviral E1A transfection transforms primary human bronchial epithelial (HBE) cells and up-regulates their production of mediators that are clinically relevant to the pathogenesis of COPD. The E1A protein alters the expression of growth factors. Connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) as well as transforming growth factor \u03b21 (TGF-\u03b21)-mRNA and protein expression are up-regulated in E1A-positive HBE cells. In vitro experiments demonstrated that up-regulation of CTGF is independent of TGF-\u03b2 secretion into the growth medium. Both, E1A-positive and E1A-negative HBE cells contain cytokeratin, but only E1A-positive cells express the mesenchymal markers vimentin and \u03b1-smooth muscle actin. Latent infection of epithelial cells by adenovirus E1A contributes to airway remodelling in COPD. The viral E1A protein induces TGF-\u03b21 and CTGF expression, and shifts cells to a more mesenchymal phenotype [27, 28] .",

The replication increases the expression of Tolllike receptor 3 (TLR3) mRNA and TLR3 protein on the cell surface of human bronchial epithelial cells. TLR3 is important for the mediation of the antiviral response [66] . CXCL10, also known as IFN-\u03b3-inducible protein 10 (IP-10), plays a role in the pathogenesis of HRV-induced colds and in HRV-induced exacerbations of COPD [77, 78] . It can be induced by the infection of primary cultures of human airway epithelial cells or of human bronchial epithelial cells with rhinoviruses. IP-10 is a ligand for the CXCR3 receptor that can be found on activated type 1 Tlymphocytes and natural killer cells. Generation of IP-10 requires an intracellular virus capable of replication but is dependent on prior induction of type 1 interferons [77, 78] . Transfection of synthetic double-stranded RNA into epithelial cells induces robust production of IP-10, whereas transfection of single-stranded RNA has no effect. Induction of IP-10 gene expression by HRV-16 depends upon activation of NF\u03baB, as well as other transcription factor recognition sequences further upstream in the IP-10 promoter. In vivo infection of human volunteers with HRV-16 strikingly increases IP-10 protein in nasal lavages during symptomatic colds. Levels of IP-10 correlate with symptom severity, viral titer, and numbers of lymphocytes in airway secretions [77, 78] . IP-10 is thus suited as a potential biomarker for rhinovirus-induced exacerbations of COPD [78, 79] (Table 5) .",

More than 40% of the patients with COPD exacerbation requiring mechanical ventilation are infected with a viral pathogen. There is no statistically significant difference in prodromal, clinical characteristics or outcomes between the groups with and without viral infections [6] . However, patients with infectious exacerbations suffer from prolonged hospitalizations and greater impairment of several lung function parameters than those with noninfectious exacerbations. Airway neutrophilia is related to exacerbation severity regardless of viral and/or bacterial infections, while eosinophilia is a good predictor of viral exacerbations [98] . The values of sputum inflammatory markers are increased in COPD patients with symptoms of a common cold or detected HRV at exacerbation, thus suggesting that viral infections lead to greater airway inflammation and thus more severe exacerbations [99] . The expression of airway neutrophilic inflammation markers increases at the time of acute COPD exacerbation and then declines 1 month later. This acute inflammatory response appears to occur independently of a demonstrable viral or bacterial airway infection. Patients with documented infection do not demonstrate greater increases in sputum levels of inflammatory cytokines during exacerbations compared with patients without demonstrable infection.

Some evidence supports a role of the epithelial cell in specific immunity, although the response of more conventional cells of the immune system to viral infections is the dominant factor in this regard [106] . Antiviral defense depends at least in part on a network of mucosal epithelial cells and macrophages. When this network is compromised, the host is highly susceptible to infection, but network components can be engineered to provide increased resistance. Attempts to improve antiviral defense may also lead to permanent inflammatory airway disease long after the infection has been cleared [107] ( Table 1) . Development of in vitro experimental models of virus infection has identified IFN-\u03b2 and nitric oxide (NO) as possible therapeutic targets to augment antiviral immunity, and NF\u03baB as a target for development of anti-inflammatory therapies [108] .",

Many of the cellular and molecular mechanisms by which viruses cause exacerbations are still undetermined. The use of biomarkers represents a potential diagnostic tool that could provide new insights into the pathogenesis of viral infections in COPD patients [68] . Current therapies are not very effective in the prevention or treatment of virus-induced exacerbations of COPD. Exacerbations are therefore a major unmet medical need [109] . A better understanding how viral infections support the progress of COPD could lead to new therapeutic approaches improving the outcome of exacerbations and the prognosis of COPD. ",
