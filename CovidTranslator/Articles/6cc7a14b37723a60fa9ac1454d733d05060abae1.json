Here we show that secondary damage after acute cryoinjury is significantly reduced in C3 \u2212/\u2212 or C5 \u2212/\u2212 mice or in mice treated with C5a receptor antagonist peptides. Injury sizes and neutrophil extravasation were compared. While neutrophil density increased following traumatic brain injury in wild type (C57BL/6) mice, C3-deficient mice demonstrated lower neutrophil extravasation and injury sizes in the brain. RNase protection assay indicated that C3 contributes to the induction of brain inflammatory mediators, MIF, RANTES (CCL5) and MCP-1 (CCL2). Intracranial C3 injection induced neutrophil extravasation in injured brains of C3 \u2212/\u2212 mice suggesting locally produced C3 is important in brain inflammation. We show that neutrophil extravasation is significantly reduced in both C5 \u2212/\u2212 mice and C5a receptor antagonist treated cryoinjured mice suggesting that one of the possible mechanisms of C3 effect on neutrophil extravasation is mediated via downstream complement activation products such as C5a. Our data indicates that complement inhibitors may ameliorate traumatic brain injury.",

Complement components have been implicated in exacerbation of inflammatory injury in several different tissues, including the central nervous system (CNS) . Within the CNS, We demonstrate that neutrophil extravasation is significantly reduced in complement deficient animals. In parallel, the size of traumatic injury and the level of tissue trauma in the injury sites are also reduced as analyzed by immunohistochemistry and RNase protection assays (RPA). RPA showed significant induction of IL-12p35, IL-6 and eotaxin in C57BL/6-C3 \u2212/\u2212 mice with lower increase of RANTES (CCL5) and MCP-1 chemokines. There was no detectable increase in MIF mRNA expression in C3-deficient animals. When wild type animals were analyzed, we found significantly increased levels of IL-12 p35, IL6, MIF, RANTES, eotaxin and MCP-1 mediators demonstrating inflammation in the injured brains. MIF and MCP-1 were more highly expressed in the C57BL/6 controls throughout the 7-day timecourse. These results suggest that C3 contributes to the inflammatory damage of traumatic brain injury.",

Mice were anesthetized by intra-peritoneal injection of ketamine/xylazine and placed in a Stoelting (Wood Dale, IL) stereotactic apparatus with a mouse and neonatal rat adaptor, to ensure consistent injury size and placement. A sagittal incision was made in the scalp and a 3 mm diameter steel probe cooled in liquid nitrogen was applied to the skull for 6 s. Incisions were sutured and mice recovered from anesthesia.

Control mice received equal volume of sterile PBS with or without cryoinjury. Mice were euthanized at 24 h post injury and brains were harvested for evaluation of injury sites. Maximal injury cross-sectional areas were determined for each mouse and density of infiltrating neutrophils was determined as described above. We have chosen this concentration to study the effect of C5aR blocking in the extravasation of neutrophils in the acute phase of traumatic injury in the brain based on previous reports indicating that the half life of the C5aRa peptide in serum is about 6 h and sufficient amount of this blocker can be detected in the acute phase of injuries (Walport, 2001) .",

The possible contamination of the C3-preparation by anaphylatoxic peptides was tested by mast cell degranulation assay, using mouse bonemarrow derived and peritoneal mast cells, the rat RBL-2H3 and the human HMC-1 cell lines. No activation of any of these cells was observed, even when the C3-preparation was used at a concentration of 1 mg/ml.

We analyzed the gene expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines that influence tissue inflammation and leukocyte invasion by virtue of their ability to selectively attract and activate subsets of leukocytes. As expected, a very low level of chemokine mRNA was observed in the perfused CNS of naive mice, while multiple chemokine mRNA transcripts were upregulated following traumatic injury in all mice (Fig. 2) . In injured tissue of C57BL/6 wild type mice, four-to eight-fold induction of RANTES (CCL5), eotaxin (CCL11) and MCP-1 (CCL2) transcripts predominate over other chemokines (Fig. 2B) , including lymphotactin, MIP-2, and TCA-3 (not shown). Mice with deficiency in C3, however, display a chemokine gene expression profile distinct from that of wild type mice. In general, the RANTES (CCL5), eotaxin (CCL11) and MCP-1 (CCL2) chemokines demonstrated lower fold induction (two-to four-fold), earlier peak levels and earlier return to baseline levels (Fig.  2B) . Similarly, insignificant amounts of MIP-1\u03b1 (CCL3), MIP1-\u03b2 (CCL4), and MIP-2 mRNA were detected in C3 \u2212/\u2212 mice (not shown). When inflammatory cytokines were analyzed, prominent expression of MIF was seen in the injured brain of wild type mice ( Fig.  2A) , however, nearly undetectable expression of MIF was demonstrated both pre and posttraumatic injury in C3 deficient mice. Overall, expression of IL12-p35 and IL6 was not significantly different between the two groups.",

Upon extravasation into injured tissues in response to chemotactic signals, neutrophils become capable of an oxidative burst, which can destroy microorganisms and healthy cells alike. The typical pattern of neutrophil recruitment and accumulation over time begins just a few hours after injury and peaks at 1 day post injury. This is followed by a rapid decline, such that few remaining neutrophils are detectable 4 days after injury. Because of the similarity of this timing to the altered events visible in Fig. 1 we hypothesized that neutrophils contribute to the differences in acute damage from traumatic brain injury of C3 deficient mice.

Lower fold induction of several inflammatory molecules, such as MIF, Rantes (CCL5) and MCP-1 (CCL2), in C3-deficient mice compared to wild type animals following traumatic brain cryoinjury correlates with our morphologic findings indicating a lower level of inflammation in the absence of complement C3. At this time, the exact mechanism by which complement components C3 and C5 contribute to chemokine and cytokine mediator upregulation at traumatic injury sites in the brain is not known. Several of these chemokines such as RANTES (CCL5) and its receptor, CCR5 have been implicated as critical contributing factors in the trafficking of leukocytes into CNS of mice with EAE and MHV infections (Glass et al., 2004 (Glass et al., , 2001 Lane et al., 2000) . In our studies we have demonstrated the upregulation of these chemokines following traumatic injury in brain. The underlying mechanism linking regulation of chemokine and cytokine expression with C3 or C5 expression following traumatic injury in the brain is a focus of ongoing study in our laboratory. Although this is not a major focus of this paper, these differences can offer an approach to the study of how complement interferes with the local inflammatory processes in CNS.",

            "text": "Some studies of complement depletion and complement inhibition have been carried out in animal models of brain injury. A model of thromboembolic stroke in rabbits showed no significant effect of complement depletion on the outcome of stroke induced injury (Lew et al., 1999; Rancan et al., 2003) . In contrast, a rat model of traumatic brain injury showed a 41% decrease in neutrophil myeloperoxidase activity after systemic C3 inhibition by soluble complement receptor 1 (sCR1) (Kaczorowski et al., 1995) . These differing results of complement modification could be due to the different injurious processes or to the different animals used in these models. Our data is most similar to the rat model. We demonstrate that in mouse, complement deficiency inhibits neutrophil extravasation and ameliorates acute inflammatory damage due to traumatic injury. The results of our reconstitution experiments support the possibility of complement activation in situ following traumatic injury. C3 administered locally is able to restore some neutrophil extravasation in the genetically deficient mice (Fig. 3) . The level of neutrophil extravasation/mm 2 in the brain of C3 i.c. reconstituted C3-deficient animals does not reach the level of extravasation in wild type mice. This data indicates that either the local concentration of C3 in the brain is not sufficiently high or that a systemic C3 source is also needed to induce optimal neutrophil extravasation. The fact that control mice receiving C3 intracranially without cryoinjury, or PBS with cryoinjury did not develop a detectable lesion or neutrophil infiltration demonstrates that the needle induced trauma alone is not sufficient to induce neutrophil extravasation (data not shown). This model would imply that a good therapeutic C3 inhibitor should readily cross an intact blood-brain barrier or be administered directly into the cerebrospinal fluid of victims of traumatic brain injury.",

            "text": "We also demonstrated that complement component C5 deficiency alone could decrease neutrophil infiltration to approximately 35% of wild type. This indicates that most but not all of the complement dependent neutrophil extravastion is induced by C5. C3a might also contribute to this process based on the fact that recent studies have demonstrated increased C3aR mRNA and protein during acute inflammatory processes of endotoxemia, focal ischemia, multiple sclerosis, and bacterial meningitis (Gasque et al., 1998; Nadeau and Rivest, 2001; Van Beek et al., 2000) . Furthermore, we also characterized the specific contribution of activated C5 using a cyclic hexapeptide with C5a receptor (C5aR) antagonist activity. Our data showed that C5a receptor antagonist activity was sufficient to obtain the same decrease in neutrophil extravasation as genetic deficiency of C5. This is the first use of a C5aR antagonist in a brain injury model. Previously, it was demonstrated that C5aR expression is increased on cortical endothelia in response to ischemic damage in the mouse (Van Beek et al., 2000) . Expression of this receptor has also been reported on neurons and astrocytes (Gasque et al., 1995; Van Beek et al., 2000) . The dual role of C5 in enhancement of inflammatory demyelination in acute EAE and promoting remyelination in recovery in the CNS has been recently proposed (Weerth et al., 2003) . Furthermore, it was shown that the C5 complement component can protect oligodendrocytes from apoptosis in the recovery phase of EAE (Niculescu et al., 2004) . These data altogether indicate that C5 can be therapeutically used either through blocking its activity in the acute phase of traumatic brain injury, or by inducing its activity in chronic CNS inflammations. The importance of component C5 and its activation products is further emphasized by the observation that C5 mRNA is constitutively expressed in the mouse brain by both neuronal and non-neuronal cells and to a much higher degree than C3 mRNA (Nadeau and Rivest, 2001) . In conclusion, these data indicate that a C5aR antagonist might be an effective therapeutic tool for decreasing the acute inflammation of traumatic brain injury without compromising systemic complement activities. Tissue morphology and injury size in the brain of C3 deficient mice are less severe following traumatic brain injury. (A) H&E stained sections of C57BL/6 and (B) C57BL/6/C3 \u2212/\u2212 mouse brains at 7 days after traumatic injury. At day 7, C3 \u2212/\u2212 injury sites present a significantly smaller area of leukocyte extravasation with total resolution of the central area of acelluar necrosis, compared to the C57BL/6 brain tissues. (*) represents the edge of the injury site. Images were taken at 100 \u00d7 magnification. (C) Quantitation of injury areas at 1, 4 and 7 days post injury. Ten H&E stained, coronal sections from the center of injuries of each mouse were photographed, and injury area on each slide was quantified using Scion Image as described in Materials and methods. The three largest areas from each injury site were averaged as maximal cross sectional area. Error bars represent standard error from four mice per group. Sewell et al. Page 14",

These images are representative of three experiments. Expression of IL-12p35, IL-6, MIF, Rantes, Eotaxin and MCP-1 were normalized to L32 expression and compared between C57BL/6 wild type mouse brains (black bars) and C3 \u2212/\u2212 mouse brains (white bars) at 5 time points, uninjured, and 1 h, 1 day, 4 days and 7 days post traumatic brain cryoinjury. Expression level of cytokines and chemokines in uninjured C57BL/6 was arbitrarily set to one with fold change from this level displayed throughout the time course. Neutrophil infiltration in the brain of mice following traumatic cryoinjury. (A) Injury sites 1 day post injury from wild type C57BL/6 and C3 \u2212/\u2212 brains were stained with H&E, upper panels, and an anti-neutrophil antibody, lower panels. Neutrophils, identified by characteristic segmented nuclei on H&E sections and red staining with anti-neutrophil antibody, are distributed throughout the parenchyma of the injury site in wild type mice and are not contained within vessel lumina (left panels). In complement deficient mouse brain injury sites, the parenchyma contain many fewer neutrophils (right panels). Many neutrophils remain in the luminae of large vessels and fail to extravasate into the parenchyma (right panels). (B) Extravascular neutrophil density per square millimeter of injured tissue was calculated and found to be reduced by ~90% in the absence of complement C3 ( p < 0.005 by Student's t-test). C3 was administered by intra-cerebral injection of purified mouse C3 (20 \u03bcg/injection in 20 \u03bcl) into the injury site of C3 \u2212/\u2212 mice at the time of injury and again 2 h before harvest of 1 day post injury tissue punctuation. Intracerebral administration of C3 partially restored neutrophil extravastion into the injury (n = 4 mice/group, error bars indicate S.D.). C5 deficiency and C5aR antagonists protect mice from acute brain injury. Quantification of extravascular neutrophil density within the injury site as an indicator of severity of inflammation was performed using C5 deficient mice and wild type mice treated with C5aR antagonist. The neutrophil density resulting from the administration of C5aR antagonist prior to cryoinjury of wild type mice (right) was not significantly different from the C5 \u2212/\u2212 (*p>0.8). In both C5 \u2212/\u2212 and C5aR antagonist peptide injected wild type mice, extravascular neutrophil density was higher than in C3 \u2212/\u2212 animals ( p < 0.03, n = 9, mean \u00b1 S.D.).
