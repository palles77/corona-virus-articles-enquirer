To understanding the epidemiological role of camels in the transmission of MERS-CoV, we utilized an iterative empirical process in Geographic Information System (GIS) to identify and qualify potential hotspots for maintenance and circulation of MERS-CoV, and produced risk-based surveillance sites in Kenya. Data on camel population and distribution were used to develop camel density map, while camel farming system was defined using multi-factorial criteria including the agro-ecological zones (AEZs), production and marketing practices. Primary and secondary MERS-CoV seroprevalence data from specific sites were analyzed, and location-based prevalence matching with camel densities was conducted. High-risk convergence points (migration zones, trade routes, camel markets, slaughter slabs) were profiled and frequent cross-border camel movement mapped. Results showed that high cameldense areas and interaction (markets and migration zones) were potential hotspot for transmission and spread.",

These potential hotspots, determined using anthropogenic, system and trade characterizations should guide selection of sampling/surveillance sites, high-risk locations, critical areas for interventions and policy development in Kenya, as well as instigate further virological examination of camels.",

Travel-related MERS-CoV links have also been established, and these remain a threat to other regions in view of rapidity and intensity of travels (Fanoy et al. 2014) . Since the discovery of MERS-CoV in 2012 (Zaki et al. 2012) , serologic and molecular evidences have demonstrated that the virus in dromedary camels is genetically very similar to MERS-CoV in humans; hence, the conclusion that dromedary camels may serve as reservoirs for human infections (Nowotny and Kolodziejek 2014; Dudas and Rambaut 2016) .

Community base maps were provided with key topographic features in mini-workshops, and missing features were compiled based on visual routes used for trade and within-country migration.

The in and out-flows of people and livestock to the markets, and the volumes vary significantly across the different categories of markets and also the months of the year (Tables 3, 4, 5). The closer a market is to a terminal (final destination of the camel), the higher the level and volumes of traders, diversity of actors and animal numbers (Tables 3, 4, 5). Additionally, livestock from secondary markets are transported to many destinations and have linkages with long-distant markets. Using the MPT, it was inferred that the risk of intra-and interspecies transmission of disease is considered higher in secondary (terminal) markets compared with the primary (bush) markets (Table 3) . More cattle, sheep and goats were traded through the markets compared with camels. Sale of donkeys was sparingly done and was reported only in Isiolo livestock auction yard. Seasonal variations in sales were influenced by annual migration of livestock to locations away from the markets in search of forage and water (Fig. 2a, b) ; during such movements, there fewer livestock are available for sale in the markets. Similarly, fewer animals were presented to the markets during the wet months of late March up until early June, and in the months of October to December. During these months, camels and cows are at their peaks in terms of production and productivity, and lush pastures are abundant, with resultant increase volume of milk for the pastoral household and the need to sell off animals to purchase food stuff is not warranted. Interviews with the traders suggested that the price of livestock skyrocketed during the low offtake period, but this increased prices of livestock do not seem to trigger increased supply of animals by the pastoralists.",

National camel identification project that may assist with animal traceability (in-migration, out-migration and within-country movement) is necessary. Because there have been direct correlation between animal population densities and animal disease (Olive et al. 2016; Corman et al. 2014) , targeted surveillance should be prioritized in these camel-dense counties. In this work, counties with high seroprevalence (Marsabit, Wajir and Mandera) were primary high transit areas for camel movements and were positively correlated with camel densities, frequent animal and herd contacts. Jores (2015) argued that antibody levels of nomadic camels are significantly higher than those from ranches and that herds in northeastern parts showed increased seropositivity than camels in the north western and our finding is in agreement with this assertion. M\u00fcller et al. (2014) have earlier reported that Kenya receives many camels from Somalia and Sudan where seroprevalence values were as high as over 90%.

Such intense interaction may introduce and amplify disease pathogens and increase the likelihood of disease outbreaks. Such outbreaks are recorded periodically in Kinna, Cherab and Garbatulla areas of Isiolo, a dry season grazing area for cattle, sheep and goats (Wasonga et al. 2016) . Furthermore, in the situation of acute food shortage for camels during drier periods, and as part of trade practices, some of the stock routes do trade by barter, e.g., (1) Moyale to Marsabit barters mature bull destined for the Djibouti and ultimately the Middle East markets for female calves to be sold in the Marsabit region; (2) Wajir-North Horr barters female calves from Wajir for mature bulls in North Horr which are then trekked to Wajir County and sold to neighboring Somalia (Fig. 3) .

Previous serological works have suggested that Kenya may have had the MERS-Co virus in circulation (Jores 2015; Deem et al. 2015; M\u00fcller et al. 2014 ). Our conclusion is in agreement with these assertions, and we confirmed that camel population density per county, volume of camel movement through counties and intense animal-animal contacts are associated with high seropositivity. Jores (2015) had earlier argued that herds in northeastern parts showed increased seropositivity than camels in the north western parts of Kenya. East-African sub-regional herds enter Kenya through Mandera, Wajir and Garissa counties thereby increasing animal-to-animal contacts, and this may be responsible for the high level of seropositivity in camels from this axis.",

It is hoped that virological examination of Kenya's camel will be conducted in due course to add to the understanding of epidemiology of MERS-CoV globally.",
