The ovarian tumor (OTU) domain represents a superfamily of predicted proteases found in eukaryotic, bacterial and viral proteins, some of which have Ub-deconjugating activity. We show that the OTU domain-containing proteases of nairoviruses and arteriviruses hydrolyze Ub and ISG15 from cellular target proteins. This broad activity contrasts with the target specificity of known mammalian OTU domain-containing proteins. The biological significance of this activity of viral OTU domaincontaining proteases was evidenced by their capacity to inhibit NF-\u03baB dependent signaling and to antagonize the antiviral effects of ISG15 during Sindbis virus infection in vivo. The deconjugating activity of viral OTU proteases represents a novel viral immune evasion mechanism that inhibits Uband ISG15-dependent antiviral pathways.",

In particular, viruses must overcome the potent antiviral and inflammatory effects of innate immune cytokines such as type I interferon (IFN\u03b1\u03b2) and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF\u03b1). As IFN\u03b1\u03b2 and TNF\u03b1 are fundamentally important in the early response to infection, a particularly effective viral immune evasion strategy would be one that antagonizes the effects of both cytokines. Interestingly, both TNF\u03b1-regulated gene expression and part of the IFN\u03b1\u03b2 antiviral state depend on the host proteins Ub and ISG15 which conjugate to their cellular targets via a conserved LRLRGG sequence. This presents a common chemical structure that could be targeted by viruses to simultaneously evade both TNF\u03b1 and IFN\u03b1\u03b2 effects.",

The activation of the transcriptional regulator nuclear factor-\u03baB (NF-\u03baB) by TNF\u03b1 was one of the first immune regulatory pathways found to be dependent on protein ubiquitination (Karin and Ben-Neriah, 2000) . NF-\u03baB is sequestered in the cytoplasm of unstimulated cells through binding to I\u03baB. TNF\u03b1 binding to its receptor induces I\u03baB phosphorylation followed by K 48 -linked poly-ubiquitination targeting I\u03baB for proteasomal degradation. This releases NF-\u03baB dimers for translocation to the nucleus where they regulate transcription. NF-\u03baB-induced genes include type I IFN and other cytokines, hence this Ubcontrolled pathway plays a vital role in innate and adaptive immunity, as well as in inflammation (Tergaonkar, 2006) . In addition to ubiquitination of I\u03baB, K 63 -and K 48 -linked ubiquitination regulates other molecules involved in this signaling pathway (Chen, 2005) .",

Heterologous expression of ISG15 by a chimeric recombinant Sindbis virus protects IFN\u03b1\u03b2R -/mice against Sindbis virus-induced lethality . ISG15 -/mice display increased susceptibility to infection with Sindbis, herpes simplex, influenza A and influenza B viruses (Lenschow et al., 2007) . The mechanism by which ISG15 mediates its antiviral function is not completely understood. ISG15, like Ub, is covalently conjugated to target proteins via a Cterminal LRLRGG sequence (Haas et al., 1987; Loeb and Haas, 1992; Narasimhan et al., 1996) . Importantly, the antiviral effects of ISG15 require the terminal GG of this motif, consistent with conjugation being important for the antiviral activity of ISG15 Lenschow et al., 2007) . Of interest, the NS1 protein of influenza B virus specifically binds ISG15 and blocks conjugation of ISG15 to cellular targets, suggesting that ISGylation may be a target of immune evasion strategies (Yuan et al., 2002; Yuan and Krug, 2001) .",

            "text": "Ub and ISG15 are synthesized as inactive precursors with C-terminal extensions that undergo cleavage to reveal the LRLRGG sequence required for conjugation. Coordinated activities of an ATP-dependent enzymatic cascade comprising an activating enzyme (E1), a conjugating enzyme (E2) and a ligase (E3) result in the conjugation of Ub or ISG15 to the \u03b5-amino group of a lysine residue present in the target protein. Both Ub and ISG15 conjugation can be reversed by the activity of deconjugation enzymes. De-ubiquitinating (DUB) proteolytic enzymes are also involved in processing of Ub precursors. Five classes of DUBs have been described (Nijman et al., 2005) ; one of the most recently identified is the ovarian tumor (OTU) domain family. This comprises a group of putative cysteine proteases, homologous to the OTU protein in Drosophila. The family includes more than a hundred proteins found in eukaryotes, bacteria and viruses (Makarova et al., 2000) . Several OTU-domain containing mammalian proteins, such as Cezanne (Evans et al., 2003) , Otubain 1 and 2 (Balakirev et al., 2003) , and A20 (Evans et al., 2004) have been identified as proteases that participate in substrate-specific deubiquitinating processes. For example, A20 is an important down-regulator of TNF\u03b1 signaling via its deubiquitination of TRAF6 and its dual function of poly-Ub 63 deconjugation followed by poly-Ub 48 modification of RIP (Wertz et al., 2004) . These activities are mediated by its N-terminal OTU domain and its C-terminal zinc finger domain, respectively. However, the substrate specificity and physiologic role of most OTU domaincontaining proteins remains unknown.",

We found that two unrelated families of RNA viruses express OTU-domain containing proteases with the capacity to decrease Ub and ISG15 conjugation to cellular proteins. Nairoviruses are negative-sense, segmented, RNA viruses of the Bunyaviridae family. Their large (L) protein contains an OTU domain and an RNA polymerase domain, placing this protein in the growing category of multifunctional viral proteins. Crimean Congo hemorrhagic fever virus (CCHFV) is a human nairovirus that causes hemorrhagic fever with up to 30% mortality (Whitehouse, 2004) . Arteriviruses, including equine arteritis virus (EAV) and porcine respiratory and reproductive syndrome virus (PRRSV), are the causative agents of important diseases in horses and pigs. They are positive sense, non-segmented RNA viruses that contain an OTU domain within their non-structural protein 2 (nsp2), which is also involved in viral replicase polyprotein processing (Snijder et al., 1995) . We found that these viral OTU domains, in contrast to known mammalian OTU proteases, display a broad deconjugating activity towards ubiquitinated and ISGylated products and consequently inhibit innate immunity pathways that are dependent on Ub and ISG15. Thus, the deconjugating activity of viral OTU domains represents a novel strategy used by nairoviruses and arteriviruses to evade the host antiviral response probably by targeting a common biochemical structure in Ub and the UBL protein ISG15.",

This domain was also present in the L proteins of the nairoviruses Dugbe virus (DUGV) and Nairobi sheep disease (NSD) virus (Honig et al., 2004 ), but has not been found in the L proteins of any other genus in the Bunyaviridae family. An alignment of the OTU domains present in nairoviruses and mammalian proteins A20, Cezanne, VCIP135, Otubain 1 and Otubain 2 revealed limited identity; however a strong conservation of D 37 , G 38 , N 39 , C 40 , W 71 , H 151 and an aromatic amino acid at position 152 (numbering based on the CCHFV-L sequence) was observed ( Figure  1 , black boxes). Among these amino acids, C 40 and H 151 (Figure 1 , black arrows) were predicted to be the catalytic residues present in the putative protease active site (Balakirev et al., 2003; Makarova et al., 2000; Nanao et al., 2004) . Despite the overall poor identity between the OTU domains of nairoviruses, mammalian and the arteriviruses nsp2 proteases, a pattern of conserved residues around the predicted catalytic C and H residues (Snijder et al., 1995) has been described previously, prompting the inclusion of these viral proteases in the OTU domain family of proteins (Makarova et al., 2000) . These alignments suggested that there may be functional relationships between viral and host OTU-domain containing proteins.",

Transfection of cells with plasmids expressing CCHFV-L slightly decreased the overall expression of Ub-conjugated proteins ( Figure 2B , lanes 1 and 2, panel A; Figure 2C , lanes 1, 4 and 5, panel A). To test the effect of CCHFV-L expression on protein ISGylation, ISG15 conjugates were generated by transfecting plasmids expressing ISG15 and its specific E1 (UBE1L) (Yuan and Krug, 2001) and E2 (UbcM8) (Kim et al., 2004; Zhao et al., 2004) enzymes since endogenous levels of ISGylated proteins are low in the absence of IFN stimulation. Co-transfection of CCHFV-L resulted in a clear decrease in the level of ISGylated proteins ( Figure 2B , lanes 1 and 2, panel B; Figure 2C , lanes 1, 4 and 5, panel B). This decrease was also observed when CCHFV-L was untagged (data not shown). The decrease in total ISGylation was comparable to the effect of UBP43, a known ISG15 deconjugating enzyme ( Figure 2B , lane 9, panel B). Expression of CCHFV-L did not affect levels of expression of UBE1L or UbcM8 ( Figure 2B , lane 2, panels C and D; Figure 2C , lanes 4 and 5, panel C), consistent with CCHFV-L acting via inhibition of ubiquitination and ISGylation reactions or by directly de-ubiquitinating or de-ISGylating proteins.",

To further map the region responsible for decreasing Ub and ISG15 conjugates, truncation mutants of the L protein expressing only the first 354, L(1-354), or 169 amino acids, L(1-169), were tested. Both constructs drastically decreased expression of Ub and ISG15-conjugated proteins ( Figure  2B , lanes 6 and 7, panels A and B; Figure 2C , lane 2, panels A and B) . Thus, expression of the CCHFV-L protein decreases levels of Ub and ISG15 conjugates, and this activity was mapped to the OTU domain.",

Recombinant L(1-169) cleaved both K 48and K 63 -linked poly-Ub chains into monomers ( Figure 3B , lanes 2 to 5), similarly to isopeptidase T, a known deubiquitinating enzyme ( Figure 3B , lane 10). This activity was markedly decreased by mutating the amino acid C 40 ( Figure 3B , lanes 6 to 9), indicating that this OTU catalytic residue is required for optimal protease activity. The small amount of deconjugation observed with L(1-169)1A is not unexpected, as mutation of Cezanne's catalytic cysteine yielded similar data where most, but not all, catalytic activity was impaired (Evans et al., 2003) . This result shows that the OTU domain of CCHFV-L has bona fide DUB activity in the absence of other cellular proteins. We next determined whether L(1-169) can deconjugate ISGylated proteins. As ISGylated proteins are not commercially available, we generated cell lysates from IFN\u03b2-treated UBP43 -/murine embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) (Malakhov et al., 2003) . Incubation of lysates containing ISG15 conjugates with recombinant L(1-169) protein, but not L(1-169)1A, appreciably decreased ISGylated proteins ( Figure 3C , top panel) in a L(1-169) concentrationdependent manner. This result suggests that the CCHFV OTU domain has C 40 -dependent ISG15 deconjugating activity but does not exclude the possibility that the protease activity of the viral OTU domain was activating another deISGylating enzyme present in cell lysates. To address this possibility, we enriched 6xHisISG15 conjugates using Ni-NTA affinity chromatography. Incubation of 6xHisISG15 conjugates with increasing amounts of L(1-169) resulted in ISG15 deconjugation ( Figure 3C , lanes 2 to 5, bottom panel). No deconjugation was detected with the mutant L(1-169)1A protein ( Figure 3C , lanes 6 to 9, bottom panel). In addition, L(1-169) processed a pro-ISG15 protein into its mature form ( Figure 3E , lane 2, panel A). These data suggest that the CCHFV-L OTU domain directly deconjugates ISGylated proteins through its predicted cysteine protease activity.",

Site-directed mutagenesis identified active site C and H residues in EAV-nsp22. Furthermore, using a bicistronic expression construct, the 166 N-terminal residues of EAV-nsp2 were found to cleave in trans the cognate nsp2/nsp3 site, which was estimated to be at or close to the sequence FRLIGG (Snijder et al., 1995) . In our study, a slightly larger N-terminal EAV-nsp2 domain (175 amino acids; nsp2N) was used in addition to the full-length protein.

In contrast, only overexpression of mammalian Otubain 1 and Cezanne moderately decreased cellular global Ub conjugate levels, while expression of A20 or Otubain 2 had no effect on total levels of ubiquitinated proteins (Balakirev et al., 2003; Evans et al., 2004; Evans et al., 2003) . To date, there have been no published studies investigating the effects of mammalian OTU-domain containing proteins on ISG15 conjugates. We therefore tested the mammalian proteins Otubain 1, Otubain2, Cezanne, VCIP135 and A20 for their ability to decrease overall protein ubiquitination and ISGylation in transfected cells ( Figure 4B ). Expression of Otubain 1 resulted in a significant decrease in Ub conjugate levels, while Otubain 2 and Cezanne had a lesser effect ( Figure 4B , lanes 2-4, panel A). Consistent with their specificity for particular ubiquitinated substrates, expression of VCIP135 and A20 did not result in a decrease in overall ubiquitination. None of the OTU-containing mammalian proteins tested decreased global levels of ISG15 conjugates ( Figure 4B , lanes 2-6, panel B). Similar results were obtained when truncation mutants expressing the OTU domains of Otubain 1, Otubain 2, Cezanne and A20 were tested (data not shown). In addition, the OTU-containing catalytic domain of A20 (A20 CD ) was unable to process either ISG15 or Nedd8 ( Figure 3E , lane 4, panels A and B) even though it could cleave K 48 -linked Ub chains ( Figure 3F , lane 4). By contrast, overexpression of the mammalian deISGylating enzyme UBP43 decreased overall levels of ISG15 conjugates but not Ub-conjugates ( Figure 4B, lane 7) . Thus, viral OTU proteases appear to be unique in their ability to target both ISG15 and Ub conjugates.",

We evaluated L(1-1325) expression in both MEFs and brain lysates from 1836, 1854 and 2929 transgenic lines. MEF cells and brain tissue from 1836 transgenic mice contained detectable OTU domain-containing protein while protein expression from the 1854 and 2929 lines was either undetectable or very low ( Figure 5A and 5B). We next evaluated the sensitivity of L(1-1325) transgenic mice to infection with the virulent Sindbis virus strain AR86, an alphavirus that causes lethal encephalitis in young mice and is sensitive to ISG15-mediated antiviral effects . Susceptibility to Sindbis virus infection tracked with expression of the L(1-1325) protein (Fig. 5C ). Thirty five percent of mice from the 1836 transgenic line survived infection compared to \u226580% survival in C57/BL6 littermate controls or transgenic mice expressing low or undetectable levels of transgene-encoded protein. The decreased survival of 1836 transgenic mice following AR86 infection suggests that CCHFV-L OTU enhances susceptibility to viral disease in vivo.",

We took this approach because CCHFV is a biosafety containment level 4 pathogen lacking a robust animal model and reverse genetics techniques. It was previously shown that expression of ISG15 from the chimeric Sindbis virus dsTE12Q protects adult IFN\u03b1\u03b2R -/mice from Sindbis virus-induced lethality . To determine whether expression of L(1-169) would antagonize this protective effect of ISG15, we engineered four recombinant chimeric Sindbis viruses ( Figure 6A ).

Following transfection with ISG15 and its E1, E2 and E3 enzymes, ISGylated proteins can be detected in BHK-21 cells ( Figure 6B , lane 1, middle panel,). Infection with 169GG or 169 greatly reduced ISG15 conjugates, confirming that OTU expression from dsTE12Q results in deconjugation of ISGylated proteins. When cells were transfected with the E1, E2, and E3 enzymes but not ISG15, ISG15 conjugates were observed only following MTGG infection ( Figure 6B , left panel). This shows that ISG15 expressed from dsTE12Q is capable of ISGylating proteins in the presence of the relevant conjugating enzymes but that this is only seen in the presence of a catalytically inactive form of the co-expressed L(1-169) protein ( Figure 6B , lane 3, left panel).",

In order to exclude effects due to IFN\u03b1\u03b2 stimulated genes other than ISG15, we infected IFN\u03b1\u03b2R -/mice ( Figure 6C ). Seventy percent of mice infected with a virus expressing ISG15 and the mutant OTU domain (MTGG) survived, consistent with previous observations that expression of ISG15 protects mice from lethality following Sindbis virus infection . In contrast, only 20% of mice infected with a virus expressing ISG15 and a functional OTU domain (169GG) survived infection (P=0.0015). These data also correlate with our in vitro data demonstrating that L(1-169), but not L(1-169)2A, can deISGylate proteins following infection ( Figure 6B ). IFN\u03b1\u03b2R -/mice infected with 169 or MT died with similar kinetics, demonstrating that the expression of L(1-169) did not increase the virulence of dsTE12Q in the absence of the IFN-mediated antiviral response. The slight increase in survival between 169GG and 169 (P<0.0001) or MT (P=0.0032) suggest that expression of the CCHFV OTU domain cannot completely antagonize the effects of ISG15 in this system.

To address this hypothesis, we evaluated the effects of the CCHFV-L and EAV-nsp2 OTU domains on the NF-\u03baB signaling pathway which plays an essential role in the innate and adaptive immune responses against pathogens and is regulated by protein ubiquitination at several steps (Hayden et al., 2006) . Reporter gene assays were performed by TNF\u03b1 treating cells transfected with a plasmid encoding a luciferase reporter gene under the control of an NF-\u03baB-responsive promoter (Fujita et al., 1992) . Expression of the OTU domains of CCHFV-L and of EAV-nsp2 decreased TNF\u03b1-induced luciferase expression in a dose-dependent manner, similar to the inhibition mediated by A20, an OTUdomain containing inhibitor of NF-\u03baB activation ( Figure 7A) . Inhibition was about 10-fold greater in the presence of the L(1-169) domain than the L(1-169)2A mutant, indicating a role for the OTU domain protease activity. These results were further confirmed by the ability of CCHFV-L(1-169) to inhibit NF-\u03baB activation as measured by the inhibition of endogenous p65 nuclear translocation upon TNF\u03b1 treatment ( Figure 7B and 7C) . The slight inhibition of NF-\u03baB activation by the L(1-169)2A protein could be caused by some residual binding of this mutant to ubiquitinated substrates or by the presence of some other regulatory motifs within this protein. Nevertheless, the p65 nuclear translocation inhibition by the L(1-169) protein was significantly higher when compared to its mutant counterpart (P=0.0044). Overall, these results demonstrate the ability of viral OTU domains to affect immune pathways that are regulated by ubiquitination.",

This protease activity has the physiologic capacity to evade two different cytokine pathways, IFN\u03b1\u03b2 and TNF\u03b1, that are fundamentally important for innate immunity. Viral OTU domain proteases inhibit protein ISGylation in order to counter some of IFN\u03b1\u03b2's antiviral effects, while viral DUB activity prevents TNF\u03b1 transcriptional effects. This dual deconjugating activity provide an elegant example of the economy of viral evolution since both Ub and ISG15 rely on a conserved LRLRGG motif that is essential for conjugation. By targeting this conjugation process, viruses can evade or subvert many different cellular processes.",

By contrast, the OTU domain-containing cellular proteins A20, Cezanne, Otubain 1, Otubain 2 and VCIP135 did not exhibit the unique capacity of the viral OTU domain proteases to target both Ub and ISG15 conjugates. Although it is possible that viral OTU domains will still have enhanced specificity for particular conjugated proteins, their broad substrate specificity distinguish them from their host counterparts. Therefore, viral OTU domains may represent a unique class of deconjugating enzymes. We speculate that other viral proteases, perhaps including some that do not have OTU domains, will be found to target both Ub and ISG15 dependent processes. For example, viral DUB activities have been demonstrated for the adenoviral protease adenain (Balakirev et al., 2002) , the N-terminal fragment of the UL36 protein of herpesviruses Schlieker et al., 2005) , and the papain-like proteases from the coronaviruses severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) (Barretto et al., 2005; Lindner et al., 2005; Ratia et al., 2006) and human coronavirus NL63 (HCoV-NL63) .

For example, in addition to NF-\u03baB signaling, Ub regulates several aspects of antiviral immunity such as MHC class I and II antigen presentation (Loureiro and Ploegh, 2006; Shin et al., 2006) , TLR/IL1 signaling (Chen, 2005) and induction of type I IFN by the cellular viral sensor RIGI (Gack et al., 2007) . In addition, inhibition of protein ubiquitination might also affect other cellular processes that can be subverted by viruses for their own advantage, such as the proteasome-mediated protein degradation system, multiple signal transduction events or cell cycle progress. Given the effects that we observed on NF-\u03baB signaling, it seems likely that viral OTU domain containing proteases may be able to target these and other Ub-dependent pathways.",

Thus, it is not surprising that viruses may use multiple strategies to counter the antiviral effects of ISG15. The work presented here provides the second reported viral strategy for decreasing expression of bona fide ISG15 conjugates in cells. The first such strategy reported is the direct association of the NS1 protein of influenza B virus with ISG15. This association inhibits protein ISGylation by blocking the ISG15-UBE1L interaction (Yuan and Krug, 2001) , while the viral OTU domain proteases analyzed here accomplish a similar effect via deconjugation. Interestingly, the DUB proteases PLpro (SARS-CoV) and adenain (adenovirus), cleave ISG15 fusion proteins (Balakirev et al., 2002; Barretto et al., 2005; Lindner et al., 2005) . These proteins might share with the viral OTU domain-containing proteases the capacity to decrease ISG15 in cells by cleaving an isopeptidic bond between ISG15 and cellular proteins, thereby antagonizing ISG15 antiviral activity.",

Ub, ISG15 and Nedd8 differ from SUMO in their exposed C-terminal motifs: LRLRGG for Ub and ISG15 and LALRGG for Nedd8 versus QQQTGG for SUMO2 and SUMO3. This raises the interesting possibility that sequences similar to the LRLRGG motif may play an important role in substrate recognition and specific cleavage by CCHFV-L OTU and perhaps other viral proteases. Interestingly, the nsp2 of arteriviruses cleaves the nsp2/3 junction at FRLIGG (EAV) or GRLLGG (PRSSV) (Allende et al., 1999; Snijder et al., 1996; Ziebuhr et al., 2000) , sequences similar to the LRLRGG sequence found at the C-terminal of Ub and ISG15. Thus, arterivirus OTU proteases have dual functions: performing essential viral polyprotein processing and targeting host substrates to modulate the anti-viral response. This is analogous to the hepatitis C virus NS3-4A protease, which is involved both in viral polyprotein processing and in cleaving cellular antiviral proteins TRIF and IPS-1 Lin et al., 2006) .",

Difficulties may arise in trying to develop OTU inhibitors that are specific for the viral proteases and do not affect cellular DUBs. However, since the viral enzymes have a unique capacity to target both Ub and ISG15 conjugates, the design of specific inhibitors might be possible. For this reason, structural studies will be of great value to understand both the molecular basis of the unique biochemical activities of these viral proteins and the potential for development of antiviral compounds.",

We were limited in performing the obvious experiment of assessing the role of viral OTU domain protease activity during infection by two things. First, CCHFV is a biosafety level 4 pathogen lacking a good animal model and whose molecular biology is not well enough developed to allow generation of mutant viruses. Second, the viral OTU domain proteases evaluated here either have, or are likely to have, important effects on processing of viral polyproteins (see above). Given this, we felt that it would be difficult to prove that these proteases have effects during infection that are solely attributable to their DUB and deISGylating activities. However, in transgenic mice, recombinant chimeric Sindbis viruses and transfected cells, we found that viral OTU domain-containing proteases have significant effects on Ub-and ISG15-dependent host processes of known importance for innate immunity. We therefore conclude that these proteins have bona fide immune evasion properties. It will be interesting to further investigate the activities of these and other viral proteases that target Ub-and ISG15-dependent processes during viral infection.",

CCHFV-L(1-1325) transgenic mice were generated at the WUSM Pathology Microinjection Core by microinjecting a linearized construct derived from pCAGGS-HA-L (1-1325) into B6 oocytes. Oocytes were implanted into pseudo-pregnant mice and resulting litters were genotyped using PCR (primer sequences available upon request). Individual embryo MEFs from transgenic lines 1836, 1854, and 2929 were generated as described previously (Weck et al., 1999) . Uninfected transgenic brain was homogenized in 1 ml of DMEM with protease inhibitors using 100 \u03bcl 1.0-mm-diameter zirconia-silica beads in a MagNa Lyser (Roche, Indianapolis, IN). To assess transgene expression, 4\u00d710 5 MEFs or 12 \u03bcl of brain homogenate were immnublotted with HA.11 and anti-actin antibodies. Eight to 10week-old male IFN\u03b1\u03b2R -/mice were infected subcutaneously (s.c.) in the left hind footpad with 5 \u00d7 10 6 PFU of virus diluted in 50 \u03bcl of Hank's balanced salt solution (HBSS). Four to 5-week old L(1-1325) transgenic mice were infected s.c. in the left hind footpad with 5000 PFU of Sindbis virus AR86 diluted in 50 \u03bcl of HBSS.
