            "text": "Kobuvirus is a relatively recently described genus of the Picornaviridae family. Human Aichi virus (AiV), its first member, was isolated from faecal samples of human patients with oyster-associated nonbacterial gastroenteritis in Japan in 1989 (Yamashita et al., 1991) . Since then, AiV has been detected in many countries around the world, especially in outbreaks associated with consumption of oysters and other shell-fish, and in sporadic disease in children Kaikkonen et al., 2010; Oh et al., 2006; Pham et al., 2007; Reuter et al., 2009; Sdiri-Loulizi et al., 2008; Yang et al., 2009) . Other members of the Kobuvirus genus have now been described causing enteric infections in cattle (Barry et al., 2011; Khamrin et al., 2008; Park et al., 2011) , pigs (Barry et al., 2011; Khamrin et al., 2009; Reuter et al., 2008) , wild boar (Reuter et al., 2012) , bats (Li et al., 2010) , sheep (Reuter et al., 2010) and rodents (Phan et al., 2011) . Their role as a primary pathogen remains uncertain (Kaikkonen et al., 2010; Lorrot et al., 2011) , and mixed infections are common . Although detection of AiV itself is rare, seroprevalence of antibody to AiV is high in humans, approaching 100% in adults, suggesting infection is common (Ribes et al., 2010; Yamashita et al., 1993) .",

The RNA molecule contains one large open reading frame encoding a single polyprotein which like other members of the Picornaviridae family is cleaved into structural and non-structural proteins. Initially two genotypes of AiV Veterinary Microbiology 164 (2013) [246] [247] [248] [249] [250] [251] [252] The kobuviruses represent an emerging genus in the Picornaviridae. Here we have used next generation sequencing and conventional approaches to identify the first canine kobuvirus (CaKoV) from outside the USA. Phylogenetic analysis suggests that a single lineage genotype of CaKoV now exists in Europe and the USA with 94% nucleotide similarity in the coding region. CaKoV was only identified in a single case from a casecontrol study of canine diarrhoea, suggesting this virus was not a frequent cause of disease in this population. Attempts to grow CaKoV in cell culture failed. Sequence analysis suggested CaKoV was distinct from human Aichi virus (AiV), and unlikely to pose a significant zoonotic risk. Serosurveys by ELISA, immunofluorescence and neutralisation tests, using AiV as antigen, suggested kobuvirus infection is prevalent in dogs. In addition, IgG antibody to AiV was also detected in cat sera, indicating for the first time that cats may also be susceptible to kobuvirus infection.",

Some unique molecular features have been described compared to other picornaviruses. Yamashita et al. (1998) showed that the VP0 capsid protein is expressed in the mature particle in Aichi virus and does not undergo cleavage (Yamashita et al., 1998) in contrast to other picornaviruses (Hellen and Wimmer, 1992) . Also the 2A and L protein of Aichi virus have no protease or autocatalytic motifs as documented for other picornaviruses and their function remains unknown (Yamashita et al., 1998) . In dogs, the first kobuviruses were described in 2011. In a study of acute gastroenteritis in canine shelters in the United States, 5 of 18 dogs from two of three outbreaks tested positive for kobuviruses. Sequence analysis and distances from AiV genotypes A and B led the authors to propose these viruses be called canine kobuvirus (CaKoV) (Kapoor et al., 2011) . In a separate study published around the same time, a similar virus was detected in the stools of three dogs with diarrhoea (Li et al., 2011) . Based on sequence analysis, the canine virus was independently named CaKoV and tentatively classified as a novel species, closely related to AiV, in the genus Kobuvirus. Follow up PCRs of 200 sick and healthy dogs found CaKoV in 14 healthy and six diarrhoeic dogs. Both of these studies failed to identify a clear role for CaKoV in disease, suggesting that any pathogenicity was likely to be low, at least in the mostly adult canine population they tested.",

These viruses have been implicated in diarrhoeal disease but the evidence for a primary pathogenic role remains controversial. We report here the first observation of kobuvirus in the UK. The virus was discovered by next generation sequencing, a powerful tool for the detection of novel viruses . Although actual infection was rare in dogs with diarrhoea, the seroprevalence study for AiV cross-reactive antibodies in dogs and cats showed infection with kobuviruses to be common in both these species. Our analysis is the first to compare sequences of CaKoV obtained in more than one country. The phylogenetic analysis reported here suggests one clade of canine kobuvirus is now present both in the USA (Kapoor et al., 2011; Li et al., 2011) and Europe. The CaKoV lineage is phylogenetically distinct from the three known AiV genotypes, and also other published kobuviruses, probably representing a single recent transfer into this species. Our failure to grow the CaKoV in various cell culture systems, is in contrast to AiV (Yamashita et al., 1991) , and suggests these two viruses are currently adapted to independent niches, although clearly we cannot rule out the virus being inactivated during storage. These results suggest CaKoV is unlikely to pose a significant zoonotic risk. That said, it is clear that geography also plays a strong part in the human kobuvirus phylogeny, and it will therefore be important to sequence AiV strains from the UK, and/or canine strains from other countries.",

Future serological assays could be based on cloned capsid antigens, but were beyond the scope of this project. We therefore chose to screen canine (and feline samples) for the prevalence of antibodies cross-reacting with human AiV genotype A. To our knowledge, there is no published data on the serological cross-reactivity between different members of the kobuvirus genus, nor between members of distinct AiV genotypes. Therefore the virological origin of the high seroprevalence detected in this study cannot be clear. For example, it is not known whether these seropositive animals represent kobuvirus infections that serologically cross-react with genotype A AiV, or whether they indeed represent previous AiV infections. Although published data generally suggests kobuviruses are host specific, some cross-species infections have been detected among farm animals (Khamrin et al., 2010; Park et al., 2011; Reuter et al., 2011) , and clearly the lifestyle of some pet dogs and cats would provide opportunity for viral transmission between species (Chomel and Sun, 2011) . This is the first paper to report possible kobuvirus infections in cats, although clearly we cannot definitely say our assay is not cross-reacting with other feline picornaviruses (Lau et al., 2012) . Clearly the identity of the virus or viruses responsible needs to be determined, along with their relationship to AiV and CaKoV. There are now many examples of possible transmission of various microbiological agents between these species (Clegg et al., 2012; Dawson et al., 2000; Radford et al., 2007) , perhaps suggesting CaKoV might also be common to both the cat and the dog. It will clearly be important to assess the role of kobuviruses in feline disease, and also as a source of infection to dogs.",
