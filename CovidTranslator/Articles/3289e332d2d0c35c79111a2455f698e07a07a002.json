Promoter singlenucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of MxA near the IFNstimulated response element (ISRE) have been frequently associated with various viral diseases, including emerging respiratory infections. We investigated the expression profile of MxA transcripts with distinct first exons in human bronchial epithelial cells. For primary culture, the bronchial epithelium was isolated from lung tissues with different genotypes, and total RNA was subjected to real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. The previously reported MxA transcript (T1) and a recently registered transcript with a distinct 5\u2032 first exon (T0) were identified. IFN-\u03b2 and polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid induced approximately 100-fold higher expression of the T1 transcript than that of the T0 transcript, which also had a potential ISRE motif near its transcription start site. Even without inducers, the T1 transcript accounted for approximately two thirds of the total expression of MxA, levels of which were significantly associated with its promoter and exon 1 SNPs (rs17000900, rs2071430, and rs464138). Our results suggest that MxA observed in respiratory viral infections is possibly dominated by the T1 transcript and partly influenced by relevant 5\u2032 SNPs.",

Binding of IFNs to their specific receptors leads to the induction of more than 300 IFN-stimulated genes, including myxovirus resistance A (MxA), also known as the myxovirus (influenza virus) resistance 1, IFN-inducible protein p78 (mouse) (MX1) gene.

            "text": "The promoter of the human MxA transcript in the original report contains two IFN-stimulated response elements (ISRE), ISRE1 and ISRE2, near the transcription start site, and both are involved in IFN responsiveness (Ronni et al. 1998 ). The IFN-stimulated gene factor 3 complex binds to the most proximal ISRE1 and the second ISRE2. ISRE1 is essential for MxA promoter activation, whereas ISRE2 has an enhancing effect in the presence of activated ISRE1 (Ronni et al. 1998) . IFN regulatory factor 3 can only bind to ISRE2 for enhancing promoter activation (Holzinger et al. 2007 ). Around ISRE2, there are two single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) at nucleotide positions \u221288 and \u2212123, which confer differences in the promoter activity and binding affinity to nuclear proteins (Hijikata et al. 2001; Ching et al. 2010) . Promoter SNPs of MxA are reportedly associated with diseases, including hepatitis C (Hijikata et al. 2000; Hijikata et al. 2001) , hepatitis B (Peng et al. 2007) , multiple sclerosis (Furuyama et al. 2006) , and subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (Torisu et al. 2004) . We previously reported the association of MxA promoter SNP with the severity of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS; Hamano et al. 2005) , and Ching et al. (2010) reported its association with susceptibility to SARS in a larger case-control study. However, the expression levels of MxA have been analyzed only in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) or liver cells (Fernandez-Arcas et al. 2004; Kong et al. 2007; Abe et al. 2011; McGilvray et al. 2012) .",

Human Total RNA Master panel II (Clontech, Mountain View, CA, USA) was used to investigate gene expression in various tissue types. Most of the tissue RNA in this panel consisted of pooled RNA from two or more donors, and their genotypes were not available. One microgram of total RNA was subjected to RT with random nonamers using SuperScript III Reverse Transcriptase (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA). MxA mRNA expression was analyzed by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) using SYBR Premix Ex Taq (Takara Bio, Shiga, Japan) and CFX96 (BioRad, Hercules, CA, USA).

PCR conditions consisted of 40 cycles of denaturation for 15 s at 95\u00b0C and annealing and extension for 1 min at 60\u00b0C. Specific target amplification was confirmed by a single peak in the dissociation curve. The mRNA copy numbers between different transcripts were compared using the absolute quantification method (Leong et al. 2007 ). RT-PCR products were purified using the Wizard PCR Preps DNA Purification System (Promega, Fitchburg, WI, USA), and their copy numbers were calculated from the DNA concentration determined by measuring the absorbance at 260 nm. The standard curve was generated with a serial fivefold dilution of each RT-PCR product, and the linear dependence of the threshold cycles was confirmed from the template concentrations. We used the \u03b2-actin gene (primers listed in Online Resource 1) to normalize the expression of MxA for calculating the relative amounts of mRNA of each transcript. The TaqMan Gene Expression Assay (Hs00182073_m1) (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA) that amplifies exons 16-17 of MxA was used with TaqMan Universal Master Mix II (Applied Biosystems) in the StepOne Plus Real-Time PCR System (Applied Biosystems), and the relative amount of total transcripts, indicating the overall expression of MxA, was calculated using the standard curve method with glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase as an internal control.",

It is thus conceivable that the T0 transcript plays a minor but independent role in the human airway. Furthermore, considering the difference between the time course of mRNA expression of the T0 and T1 transcripts after poly(I:C) stimulation, it is likely that other factors further modulate their induction levels. Because some reports (Aebi et al. 1989; Goetschy et al. 1989; Prescott et al. 2005) indicate the presence of IFN-independent induction of MxA in contrast to the results of Holzinger et al. (2007) , it would be worth investigating whether the T0 transcript can be induced through an IFN-independent signaling system in viral infection.",

The relative amounts of mRNA of each transcript compared with that of the T0 transcript in GG cells without poly(I:C) stimulation are shown as mean\u00b1SEM. Possible associations were assessed by a simple regression model (p00.647 for the number of \u221277 C alleles, p00.662 for \u2212123 A alleles, p00.539 for \u221288 T alleles, and p00.331 for +20 A alleles) under the unstimulated condition. When we evaluated the overall expression of the MxA transcripts by real-time RT-PCR, it was found to be closely correlated with levels of the T1 transcript, suggesting that individual variation of the total expression of MxA is mainly explained by the T1 transcript. Indeed overall levels of MxA as well as expression of the T1 transcript were strongly associated with these three SNPs at baseline levels. It has been repeatedly reported that the minor A allele of \u2212123 SNP and the minor T allele of \u221288 SNP, which are in strong LD, were associated with the overall transcriptional activity of the gene (Hijikata et al. 2001; Torisu et al. 2004 ). Expression of MxA was associated with \u221288 G/T SNP when PBMC cells were stimulated with IFN-\u03b12 for 12 h (Fernandez-Arcas et al. 2004 ). In one study (Furuyama et al. 2006) , the results of a luciferase reporter assay suggested that \u2212123 SNP contributed to basal expression levels of MxA, whereas \u221288 SNP contributed to the induction of expression by IFNs. Ching et al. (2010) further showed that the \u2212123A allele had a stronger binding affinity to nuclear proteins from unstimulated cells and that the \u221288 T allele preferentially bound to the protein after IFN-\u03b2 stimulation. In our study using HBE cells, \u2212123, \u221288, and +20 SNPs were all associated with baseline expression of the T1 transcript, and according to a multiple regression analysis, among the three SNPs, +20 C/A SNP was still associated with baseline expression of the T1 transcript. This finding may be attributed to the difference in cell type; however, extensive investigation is required to determine the possible effect of +20 SNP or other unknown functional polymorphisms in strong LD. Recently, Tran Thi Duc et al. (2012) reported that three SNPs (\u2212309 C/G, \u2212101 G/A, and +20 C/A) also contributed to the promoter activity in combination with well-known effects of \u2212123 and \u221288 SNPs. We could not examine \u2212309 and \u2212101 SNPs in our samples because \u2212309 C/G and \u2212101 G/A SNPs were detected only in the African population and their minor allele frequencies were relatively low .",

When HBE cells were stimulated with IFN-\u03b2 for 12 h, the same three SNPs were not associated with the expression level. These findings may conflict with the in vitro effects of these 5\u2032 SNPs on the IFN-inducible promoter activity previously assessed by a luciferase reporter system (Hijikata et al. 2001; Torisu et al. 2004; Tran Thi Duc et al. 2012) . In our study, however, the mRNA induced by poly (I:C), the dsRNA analog to mimic viral infection, was directly assessed in primary cultured HBE cells, which implies that individual variance of relevant factors such as toll-like receptor 3 and subsequent IFN signaling pathways might have affected the mRNA levels in the IFN-stimulated condition and have masked the independent effects of these promoter SNPs of the MxA gene.",
