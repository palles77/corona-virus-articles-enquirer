            "text": "An elastic network model (ENM), usually Ca coarse-grained one, has been widely used to study protein dynamics as an alternative to classical molecular dynamics simulation. This simple approach dramatically saves the computational cost, but sometimes fails to describe a feasible conformational change due to unrealistically excessive spring connections. To overcome this limitation, we propose a mass-weighted chemical elastic network model (MWCENM) in which the total mass of each residue is assumed to be concentrated on the representative alpha carbon atom and various stiffness values are precisely assigned according to the types of chemical interactions. We test MWCENM on several well-known proteins of which both closed and open conformations are available as well as three a-helix rich proteins. Their normal mode analysis reveals that MWCENM not only generates more plausible conformational changes, especially for closed forms of proteins, but also preserves protein secondary structures thus distinguishing MWCENM from traditional ENMs. In addition, MWCENM also reduces computational burden by using a more sparse stiffness matrix.",

Var-ious experimental techniques including Cryo-EM, Xray crystallography, and NMR have succeeded in determining protein structures at the atomic level. Although these structures provide good starting points for molecular dynamics simulations and the elucidation of protein dynamics, [3] [4] [5] [6] limitations regarding the simulation time scale, data size, and computational cost still exist. 7, 8 Elastic network model (ENM) based normal mode analysis (NMA) was proposed as an alternative method that is better suited for the study of the collective motions in macromolecules. [9] [10] [11] [12] In ENM, the system is constructed using a virtual spring network among point masses, which represent the protein residues and their interactions. [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] To reduce computational cost, this coarse-grained protein model adopts a simplified Hookean potential instead of using an all-atom empirical potential function. 18, 19 Moreover, various types of connection rules have been proposed to capture biologically relevant collective modes.",

            "text": "The most common and simplest method is the distance-cutoff rule. Both empirical and theoretical studies have suggested that the minimum cutoff value should be at least 11 \u00c5 to guarantee system stability. [19] [20] [21] However, this traditional method sometimes fails to capture biologically important functional modes on the low-frequency normal modes, especially for closed forms in proteins. This failure results from the discrepancy between the virtual spring connections in ENM and the actual chemical interactions of native protein structures. For example, in the case of the closed form of lactoferrin, the distance-cutoff method does not show the expected ''tweezers'' movement, because of the unrealistic constraints between the two closed lobes. 22 Moreover, the rigidity of protein structures is not given careful consideration because the traditional connection rule for ENM uses a uniform spring constant for all types of interactions. However, protein secondary structures are thought to behave as rigid bodies under thermal fluctuation because of their relatively strong covalent and hydrogen bond connections. [23] [24] [25] To improve the accuracy of stiffness and connectivity, the chemical-bond based connection rule was proposed, in which the various stiffness values are assigned according to the type of chemical bond, including disulfide bonds, covalent bonds, hydrogen bonds, salt-bridges, and Van der Waals interactions. 20 In this model, one can reduce the computation time by using smaller and more realistic distance-cutoff values of less than 8 \u00c5 without a loss of generality. Figure 1 compares traditional dis-tance-cutoff based ENM with chemical bond based ENM. In both cases, the orange spheres and lines represent the alpha carbons and their interactions, respectively.",

This mass-weighted chemical ENM, called MWCENM, maintains a sparse stiffness (Hessian) matrix and enables us to analyze protein dynamics more precisely. To verify the proposed methodology, we compute overlap values between normal modes and conformational changes of several proteins for which both open and closed conformations are available. Moreover, three alpha helix rich proteins are also tested in order to compare the torsion angle distortion between the traditional distance-cutoff method and the proposed MWCENM.

In the case of SARS protease, the CSO value from MWCENM is more than 0.66, whereas the value from traditional ENM is only 0.53. Both methods have the largest increase in the CSO value at the 8th mode. Additionally, two other increases in the CSO value occur at the 10th and the 18th modes of MWCENM. Figure 2 (B) shows a more impressive result for threonyl-tRNA synthetase. Both methods show the similar CSO profiles until MWCENM has the largest increase in the CSO value at the 16th mode. MWCENM ultimately achieves the CSO value to 0.85, as compared with 0.63 from traditional ENM, when the first 20 lowest modes are accumulated. As lower frequency modes are closely correlated with more significant functional motions, these high overlap values strongly demonstrate the better simulation accuracy of the proposed MWCENM. 36, 40 We also test the closed-form of lactoferrin [ Fig.  2 (C)]. Unlike the results for SARS protease and threonyl-tRNA synthetase, both traditional ENM and MWCENM achieved nearly the same CSO distribution. Although one can observe the same bending motion at the 7th mode, which represents one of the most significant functional motions of lactoferrin, another peak at the 12th mode involves remarkably different vibration behaviors, depending on the types of ENM. Figure 3 illustrates the 10th and the 12th mode shapes from traditional ENM and MWCENM, respectively. For comparison, we illustrate the conformational change from the closed form to the open form that is represented by a combination of two large collective motions: the bending motion between the head and the two lobes, and the relative scissoring motion between the two lobes. Figure 3 (B) shows an additional bending motion generated by the 10th mode of the traditional ENM. If we approximate the first bending motion, which occurs at the 7th mode, to a half sine wave with a hinge point in the middle, this second bending motion approximates a full sine wave where the upper head and the lower lobes bend in opposite direction to one another. In particular, MWCENM captures the scissoring motion between the two lobes at the 12th mode [ Fig. 3 (C), Supporting Information]. This result not only correlates well with the significant conformational change in lactoferrin observed in Figure 3 (A), but also agrees with previous studies. 17, 22, 29 From these results, we are convinced that the proposed MWCENM is able to better capture the intrinsic dynamics of proteins in closed form because it contains enough detailed information about mass weights and chemical interactions, and properly modulates the number of spring connections. An excess of spring connections has often appeared to be the limitation of traditional ENM. Additionally, we tested seven other proteins, which also have both open and closed conformations. The CSO results from all 10 exampled proteins are listed in Table I . In the case of closed forms, MWCENM method clearly shows higher CSO values than traditional ENM. Moreover, most of closed form proteins get the higher overlap values at lower modes when the MWCENM method is applied. In contrast, the CSO results for the open forms by MWCENM method are not that much higher but still similar those of the traditional ENM. This quantitative study strongly suggests that MWCENM be one of the best choices for protein modeling, regardless of the type of protein conformation.",

Each torsion angle change for each mode is represented by a different color line, and alpha helical regions are marked with gold lines in the middle. Figure 4(A) shows the case of myoglobin. The fluctuation of torsion angle by MWCENM clearly distinguished alpha helical regions from others. Most high peaks are placed out of alpha helical regions. In contrast, alpha helical regions are not easily identifiable from traditional ENM, because of the large and disordered torsion angle variation. The mode shape comparison between MWCENM and tradition ENM also supports these results (Supporting Information). At the 7th mode shape from traditional ENM, each alpha helix comprising Calmodulin provides a more vivid comparison traditional ENM and the proposed MWCENM [ Fig.  4(B) ]. Among many alpha helixes within calmodulin, we focus on the longest one comprising residues 65-92. Every mode from MWCENM achieves torsion angle changes close to zero, whereas the corresponding modes in traditional ENM show higher values by comparison.

In Figure 5 , the results of a computational cost analysis of both traditional ENM and MWCENM are shown. The density of the elastic network is indicated by the number of connections in the linking matrix, and the required computation time to perform NMA on each protein structure is located on top of the bar graph (unit: second). As predicted, MWCENM creates a much sparser elastic network and thus requires less computation time as compared to the traditional ENM. Additionally, the sparseness of the network created increases as the protein size increases. For calculation, we use a PC with a 2.33 GHz Intel Core2 Quad CPU and 4.00 GB of RAM.",

Therefore, NMA based on traditional ENM has some limitations in describing realistic conformational changes of proteins. For example, NMA of closed-form proteins often fails to capture their intrinsic functional motions, such as opening mode, because of unrealistic excessive spring connections among proximal regions. In addition, traditional ENM is also inadequate for representing the rigidity of secondary structural elements, such as alpha helices, when NMA is executed. To overcome these problems, MWCENM is proposed in this article. This method achieves both simulation accuracy and computational efficiency by not only optimizing the elastic network with various stiffness values according to the types of chemical interactions, but also considering the inertial effect of each amino acid as a lumped sum mass at the representative alpha carbon atom.",

MWCENM mostly shows higher CSO values than traditional ENM, and captures functionally important opening modes that are rarely observed in traditional ENM. Second, the torsion angle fluctuation, which is highly correlated with the rigidity of a protein struc-ture, is observed in alpha helix rich proteins. MWCENM preserves alpha helical structures better than traditional ENM. We also compared the computational complexity in terms of computation time and elastic network density. The optimal connectivity in MWCENM dramatically reduces the computation time as the size of protein increases. Consequently, the proposed MWCENM enables us to understand protein dynamics more rapidly and more precisely by adopting more precise spring connection rules.",

In backbone modeling, four consecutive atoms along the backbone (i.e., from the ith to the i \u00fe 3th alpha carbon in proteins) are connected using virtual springs. Because these constraints in Cartesian space are equivalent to the 3N-6 internal coordinate representations, including N-1 bond lengths, N-2 bond angles, and N-3 torsion angles, they can stabilize the stiffness matrix by generating only six zero eigenvalues corresponding to rigid-body motions. Then, other spring connections that represent the nonsequential but spatially close interactions, such as disulfide bonds, hydrogen bonds, salt bridges, and van del Waals interaction, are added to the network model. Although the backbone modeling is required to ensure system stability in MWCENM, the spatial interaction modeling is the required to improve the accuracy of the simulation model.",

Second, hydrogen bonds are modeled using the HBPLUS program, which automatically generates hydrogen bond information from the topology of the given protein structure. 43 Third, salt bridges are created between every pair of charged amino acids (i.e., interaction between cation and anion within 4 \u00c5 ). 44 Finally, van der Walls interactions are added to MWCENM depending on the distance between all pair of representative atoms within the 8 \u00c5 , because these nonbonded interactions are relatively weak and follow a Lennard-Jones potential profile, where the reliable energy state ranges up to 8 \u00c5 . 45 Table II summarizes the various stiffness values applied to MWCENM.",
