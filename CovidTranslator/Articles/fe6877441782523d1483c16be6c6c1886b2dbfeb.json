To maintain a low risk of insertional mutagenesis-mediated gene activation, expression-augmenting sequences would ideally function to improve transgene expression from transiently transfected intact plasmid, but not from spurious genomically integrated vectors. We report herein the development of potent minimal, antibiotic-free, high-manufacturing-yield mammalian expression vectors incorporating rationally designed additive combinations of expression enhancers. The SV40 72 bp enhancer incorporated upstream of the cytomegalovirus (CMV) enhancer selectively improved extrachromosomal transgene expression. The human T-lymphotropic virus type I (HTLV-I) R region, incorporated downstream of the CMV promoter, dramatically increased mRNA translation efficiency, but not overall mRNA levels, after transient transfection. A similar mRNA translation efficiency increase was observed with plasmid vectors incorporating and expressing the protein kinase R-inhibiting adenoviral viral associated (VA)1 RNA. Strikingly, HTLV-I R and VA1 did not increase transgene expression or mRNA translation efficiency from plasmid DNA after genomic integration. The vector platform, when combined with electroporation delivery, further increased transgene expression and improved HIV-1 gp120 DNA vaccine-induced neutralizing antibody titers in rabbits. These antibioticfree vectors incorporating transient expression enhancers are safer, more potent alternatives to improve transgene expression for DNA therapy or vaccination.",

            "text": "Extensive research to improve plasmid delivery has resulted in advanced methods such as electroporation (EP)-facilitated uptake, which dramatically improves gene transfer compared with passive DNA uptake. Plasmid-directed gene expression is now reaching the efficacy barrier that, to date, has prevented commercialization of gene-based plasmids for human application. 2 Although plasmid delivery has been the focus of gene transfer research, complementary vector design innovations may also be applied to improve transgene expression. We previously reported the development of potent minimalized antibiotic-free (AF) mammalian expression vectors. 3 AF vectors are derivatives of the pDNAVAC-CUltra expression vectors, 4 which incorporate and express a 150 bp RNA-OUT antisense RNA that represses expression of a host strain chromosome-encoded counter-selectable marker (SacB-encoded levansucrase) that is toxic in the presence of sucrose (Figure 1a ). These sucrose selectable vectors combine AF selection with highly productive fermentation manufacturing (41 g l \u00c01 plasmid DNA yields) and improved transgene expression levels compared with existing vectors. 3, [5] [6] [7] [8] These plasmids were designed to remove non-essential extraneous sequences ( Figure 1 ) and are minimalized FDA (Food and Drug Administration)-compliant 9 vectors for gene therapy or genetic immunization applications. These AF vectors are also compliant with European regulatory agency recommendations to eliminate antibiotic resistance markers from plasmid therapy vectors. 10 Although individual expression-augmenting sequences have been identified, they have not been used combinatorially to improve vector performance. We report herein the incorporation of rationally designed additive combinations of expression enhancers into optimized minimalistic AF vectors to effect improved transgene expression. The resultant high-production-yield, minimal, AF mammalian expression vectors incorporate novel vector backbone functionalities that further improve plasmid-directed transgene expression after transient transfection (transient expression enhancers; TEE platform: Figures 1b and c) . The viral human T-lymphotropic virus type I (HTLV-I) R, adenoviral viral associated (VA) RNAI (VA1) and SV40 enhancers used in this study were derived from non-coding regions of the respective viruses and did not have significant sequence homology to the human genome. These studies demonstrate that dramatic increases in vector-directed transgene expression can be obtained through innovations in vector design.",

This was due to increased mRNA translation efficiency (that is, HTLV-I R increased the amount of EGFP transgene produced per pg cytoplasmic EGFP mRNA; Figure 2c ), but not due to increased overall cytoplasmic mRNA levels. By contrast, no effect on integrated expression (either total mean fluorescence or fluorescence per integrated transgene copy) was observed in HEK293 ( Figure 2d ) or CHO-K1 (Supplementary Figure S1 ) cells. Consistent with this, the cytoplasmic mRNA translational efficiency improvement observed with HTLV-I R from transiently transfected plasmid did not occur with cytoplasmic RNA produced from genomically integrated plasmid ( Figure 2c) . Interestingly, the overall amount of EGFP transgene produced per pg of cytoplasmic EGFP mRNA was dramatically higher than that from genomically integrated plasmid compared with transiently transfected plasmid for both CMV and CMV-HTLV-I R promoter plasmids ( Figure 2c ).",

Treatment with tumor necrosis factor-a, which induces nuclear localization of nuclear factor-kB (NF-kB), thereby increasing transgene expression by activation of multiple NF-kB sites in the CMV promoter, resulted in a higher expression than NTC8385 (Figure 5b) , perhaps through activation of the two NF-kB sites in the SV40 enhancer (Figure 5a ). Addition of three NF-kB binding sites to NTC8485 (NTC8485-kB) further improved expression after tumor necrosis factor-a activation (Figure 5b) .",

NF-kB and NM23-H2 nuclear shuttle protein binding sites increase plasmid nuclear localization when added to base vectors. 37, 38 The SP1 protein is speculated to be a chromatin modulator that functions to maintain expressioncompetent euchromatin through association with histone acetyl transferases. 39 The SP1 and NM23-H2 sites also form a G-quadruplex (G4) structure. This is a local single-stranded DNA region, with a single-stranded three-loop structure formed by interactions with four 3-guanine motifs and three linking loops. G4 structures exclude nucleosomes and are recognized by a variety of DNA binding enzymes 40 that may function as nuclear shuttle proteins. Binding sites for these proteins were integrated into the NTC8685 backbone. NTC8685 expression in dividing or non-dividing (aphidicolin treated) A549 was not improved by inclusion of DNA binding sequences for nuclear localizing proteins NF-kB (kb), NM23-H2 (G4) or SP1 (Figures 5e and f) . A549 is known to express NM23-H2. 40 However, expression of NTC8385, NTC8485 and NTC8685 base vectors in aphidicolin-treated non-dividing A549 (Figure 5f ) and non-dividing HEK293 (Figure 5d ) cells was much higher than that of the gWIZ comparator. All these vectors were produced in dcm\u00c0 hosts; hence, differences in expression levels could not be attributed to effects of plasmid dcm methylation. This implies that nuclear localization was optimal in these NTC backbones, and that inclusion of additional shuttle protein binding sites was redundant to existing nuclear localization signals present in these vectors. Cell growth was inhibited with 20 mM of Pol III inhibitor, which accounts for the observed reduced FU at this concentration; (b) Pol III transcription was required for VA1 expression enhancement effect. The assay was in the same format as in (a), except for the fact that Pol III inhibitor-treated cells were transfected with EGFP plasmids containing the CMV-HTLV-I R promoter with or without VA1; (c) Inhibition of PKR, not of adenosine deaminase acting on RNA (ADAR) or RNA interference (RNAI), was required for VA1 expression enhancement effect. HEK293 cells were transfected with NTC7485-EGFP (same backbone as NTC8485, except for kanR instead of RNA-OUT) and NTC7485-EGFP-modified to contain: VA1 (PKR+RNAI+ADAR+inhibitor); VA1-PKR3 (PKR\u00c0RNAI+ADAR?inhibitor), in which VA1 incorporated the L3 point mutation, 26 (the designation 'ADAR?' was used, as the effect of L3 on ADAR inhibition has not been established); or VA1-PKR5 (PKR\u00c0RNAI+ADAR+inhibitor) in which VA1 incorporated a 1 bp change (pm91) in the central domain. 27 (d) VA1 did not increase transgene expression after genomic integration. Postintegration expression of (1) kanR gWIZ (CMV) compared with (2) AF gWIZ derivative containing the CMV-HTLV-I R promoter (instead of CMV) and the VA1 gene (CMV/AF-HTLV-I-VA1). CHO cells were transfected with EGFP-IRES-neo transgene versions of both plasmids using lipofectamine LTX in quadruplicate (using four different ratios of plasmid to LTX). Integrants were selected with Geneticin for 10 days. Results presented are after nine generations post selection (G9). Total mean \u00b1 s.d. fluorescence of EGFP extracts from four G9 integrated cell lines per vector (FU) and FU per integrated transgene copy number per genome (FU/copy) are shown.

HEK293 cells were transfected in triplicate with CMV or CMV-HTLV-I R NTC8385 backbone vectors (supercoiled or linearized with DraIII; see Figure 1b) expressing an EGFP-IRES-neo transgene (SupplementaryTable S1). At T\u00bc48 h post transfection, cells for FACS, cytoplasmic RNA for RT-PCR and extracts for EGFP fluorescence were prepared. Transfected cells were replated and stable integrants were selected by 10-day treatment with Geneticin. Samples for EGFP fluorescence were taken after 4, 12 and 24 generations propagation post selection (G4, G12, G24). Samples for (1) FACS; (2) genomic DNA isolation for RT-PCR-integrated plasmid copy number determination; and(3)cytoplasmic RNA for RT-PCR were taken at G4: (a) HTLV-I R increased transgene expression in transient transfection, but did not increase integrated gene expression. Total mean\u00b1s.d. fluorescence (FU) of EGFP extracts from the three transfections at the indicated time points is shown; (b) HTLV-I R affected transgene expression in individual cells rather than transfection efficiency. Total mean\u00b1s.d. fluorescence (FU) of transient and G4 cells after FACS is shown. The percentage of total cells gated (percentage of expressing cells) was equivalent between the CMV and CMV-HTLV-I R groups (transient: supercoiled 75-79%, linear 61-65%; G4: supercoiled 79-86%, linear 84-87%); (c) HTLV-I R increased mRNA translation after transient transfection. The amount of EGFP protein produced per unit EGFP cytoplasmic mRNA (EGFP FU/ (pg EGFP RNA/ng cytoplasmic mRNA)) pre-(T) and post integration (G4) is shown. (d) HTLV-I R did not increase transgene expression after genomic integration. Total mean\u00b1s.d. fluorescence of EGFP extracts from G4 integrated cell lines (FU) and FU per integrated transgene copy number per genome (FU/copy) are shown.
