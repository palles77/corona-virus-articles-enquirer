The cellular enzymes that remove PAR from proteins are PAR glycohydrolase (PARG), and to a lesser extent ADP-ribosyl hydrolase [12, 13] . The importance of removing PAR is demonstrated by the embryonic lethality of mice with genetic deletion of PARG [14] . However, PARG only cleaves between the unique glycosidic bonds of PAR [15] , and thus it was unclear how the terminal ADP-ribose moiety was removed from the modified protein. This conundrum was resolved by the discovery that cellular macrodomain-containing proteins, including terminal ADP-ribose glycohydrolase 1 (TARG1), MacroD1, and MacroD2 removed this terminal ADP-ribose [16] [17] [18] . The human genome contains at least 11 macrodomain-containing genes, but the substrate specificity and physiological roles of these proteins are largely unknown.",

The discovery that macrodomains de-ADP-ribosylate proteins strongly suggested that their major role was in reversing antiviral ADP-ribosylation. However, this hypothesis has yet to be proven. As all three viral families that contain macrodomains include established human pathogens, understanding how Box 1. The Interplay between PARPs and Virus Infections Several studies have found PARPs to have both proviral and antiviral activities. Using PARP inhibitors, several DNA viruses, such as herpesviruses, poxviruses, and adenoviruses, have been found to require ADP-ribosylation for optimal replication [56] [57] [58] . This is not surprising given the importance of PARPs in cellular DNA replication and repair. The HSV-1 ICP0 protein enhances PARylation by degrading PAR-glycohydrolase, which removes PAR from proteins [56] . Furthermore, TiPARP was shown to ADP-ribosylate TBK-1 and decrease IFN-b production, leading to enhanced replication of several RNA and DNA viruses [59] . The best known antiviral PARP, PARP13, also known as ZAP (zincantiviral protein) restricts the replication of several RNA viruses by targeting viral or host RNA for degradation [60] . PARP13 contains mutations in its PARP domain, making it enzymatically inactive, indicating that its antiviral activity does not require ADP-ribosylation [61] . However, PARP13 is known to be important for stress granule ADP-ribosylation, and it also contributes to the ADP-ribosylation of the overexpressed PA and PB2 proteins of Influenza A virus which leads to their ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation [10, 11, 62] . Thus, while it does not directly ADP-ribosylate proteins, it appears that PARP13 participates in this process, possibly by binding to active PARPs and recruiting them to target proteins. Similarly, PARPs 7, 10, and 12 directly inhibit alphavirus replication, but in a PARP-independent manner, as catalytically inactive mutants still blocked replication [63] . Overexpression of PARP12 has also been shown to inhibit the replication of several negative-strand RNA viruses, including vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) [64] . PARP1 represses the transcription of integrated retroviruses in a chicken lymphoblastoid cell line, again in a PARP-independent manner [65] . In addition, multiple PARPs are interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs), and in silico analyses indicate that PARPs 4, 9, 14, and 15 are rapidly evolving, a hallmark of antiviral defense proteins [66] . However, despite these data, antiviral ADPribosylation of cellular or viral targets have yet to be identified. macrodomains contribute to replication and pathogenesis is important. Here we comprehensively review the structures and enzymatic activities of these viral macrodomains, describe their potential functions, and discuss future challenges in understanding how macrodomains impact virus biology.",

Severe acute respiratory syndrome CoV (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome CoV (MERS-CoV) have emerged in the last 15 years, causing serious respiratory disease in humans with high mortality rates (10-40%).

Loop 1 contributes backbone contacts to the ADP-ribose a-phosphate and 1 00 and 2 00 OH groups of the distal ribose. In addition, the conserved asparagine residue (N41 in SARS-CoV) makes a hydrogen bond to the 2 00 OH group. In CoV macrodomains, the conserved histidine residue (H46) contributes to ADP-ribose binding through a coordinated water. Alphavirus macrodomains have a conserved cysteine (C34) that could fulfil a similar role, whereas human MacroD2 contains an aspartic acid (D102) that makes a hydrogen bond with the 2 00 OH group. Loop 2 contributes backbone contacts primarily to the b-phosphate of ADP-ribose. In addition, isoleucine (I132) and phenylalanine (F133) residues provide van der Waals contacts and are thought to direct orientation of the distal ribose [16, 24, 27, 34] .",

The first enzymatic activity ascribed to macro-D macrodomains was the dephosphorylation of ADP-ribose-1 00 -phosphate (a by-product of tRNA splicing reactions) identified through a biochemical-genomic screen in yeast [25] . This phosphatase activity was also detected for viral macrodomains [24, 27, 28, 31, 32] . However, the enzymatic activity of macrodomains is low, the activities vary across different virus species, and no easy explanation exists as to why ADP-ribose-1 00phosphate hydrolysis would benefit these viruses. Therefore, other functions of viral macrodomains were considered. They include but are not limited to: binding ADP-ribosylated proteins, poly-ADP-ribose, RNA or other nucleic acids [31] .",

This asparagine coordinates the 2 00 OH of distal ribose and was proposed to be essential for catalysis. While the N41A mutation abolishes the catalytic activity of SARS-CoV macrodomain [27, 28, 36] , it reduces but does not abolish the catalytic activity of other cellular and viral macrodomains [16, 37, 38] . Such apparent discrepancy could be explained by reduced ADP-ribose binding by the asparagine-to-alanine mutant since viral macrodomains, especially the CoVs, have a lower affinity for ADP-ribose (20 mM in SARS-CoV compared to 0.15 mM in human MacroD2). The loss of a single hydrogen bond between the CoV macrodomain and ADP-ribose could reduce its affinity to a point where the macrodomain enzymatic activity is nondetectable. An alternative explanation is that different catalytic mechanisms exist among macro-D type macrodomains. Despite these uncertainties, the strict conservation of this asparagine and the effects of its mutation on in vitro activity and virus fitness make it a valuable tool for studying viral macrodomains.",

While such concern is warranted, there is potential for exploiting differences between human and viral macrodomains. Residues contributing to distal ribose 2 00 OH coordination differ between human and viral macrodomains. In addition, the space around the proximal ribose and the surface residues contacting the adenine-ring might be additional areas of interest for specific small-molecule design. The potential for virus escape by mutating at these differing structural information is available, UniProt retrieved sequences of the macrodomains were used and are indicated as (Seq.).

The HEV macrodomain is a part of the multidomain ORF1 gene product of HEV (Figure 3 ) [39] . In a study on the ORF1 gene products of HEV, Nan et al. found that ORF1 inhibited poly I:C-dependent induction of interferon-b (IFNb) [39] . Using overexpressed proteins, only the papain-like cysteine protease and the macrodomain could block IFN-b expression. Importantly, the HEV macrodomain inhibited both IKKe overexpression-induced IFN-b expression and interferon regulatory factor-3 (IRF-3) phosphorylation. Since the protein kinase IKKe phosphorylates IRF-3, these data suggest that the macrodomain targets IRF-3. However, macrodomain inhibition of IKKe-induced IFN-b expression was significantly less than its inhibition of poly I:C-induced IFN-b expression, suggesting that other mechanisms are involved. In a study by Ojha and Lole, the HEV macrodomain was found to interact with the light-chain subunit of human ferritin (FTL), which led to a reduction of secreted ferritin [40] . Ferritin is an iron-binding protein that helps the cell store free iron. Ferritin complexed with iron can activate NF-kB-dependent IFN production, suggesting that this interaction could be a mechanism of innate immune suppression [41] . Neither of these studies addressed whether the ability of the HEV macrodomain to bind or hydrolyze ADP-ribose was important for these observations.",

Li et al. found that replication strongly correlated with the enzymatic activity of each mutation they created. These results demonstrate that the HEV macrodomain is important for replication and acts after RNA replication, likely prior to translation of viral proteins. Another study found that the HEV macrodomain interacted with the viral methyltransferase and ORF3 using yeast-2-hybrid and coimmunoprecipitation methods [43] .

In 2009, Park and Griffin published a study focusing on two asparagine mutants (N10A and N24A) in the ADP-ribose binding pocket of the SINV macrodomain [44] . These mutant viruses replicated normally in BHK-21 cells but were modestly attenuated in neuronal cells and significantly attenuated in 2-week-old mice. Upon replication in neurons, the N10A mutation changed to threonine or aspartic acid, and a second site mutation of a glutamic acid at position 31 to a glycine appeared. Most macrodomains have a glycine at this position, suggesting that this mutation may enhance macrodomain activity. It was unclear how these mutations affected this protein, as neither mutant affected PAR binding and it was unknown whether alphaviruses' macrodomains had de-ADP-ribosylating activity. However, recently it was demonstrated that CHIKV contains these activities [37, 38] , making it likely that these mutations within the ADP-ribose-binding pocket of the SINV macrodomain attenuated its enzymatic activity.",

Three recombinant viruses with mutations that severely affected both ADP-ribose binding and hydrolase activity were unrecoverable as they quickly reverted to wild type (D10A, G32E, G112E). The G32E mutation even reverted when transfected into an Aedes albopictus cell line, suggesting that antiviral ADP-ribosylation also occurred in mosquito cells. Other mutations that partially ablated hydrolase activity and ADP-ribose binding (T111A, G32S, G32A) replicated at 1 to 2 logs lower efficiency than wild-type virus in a neuronal cell line . Finally, one mutation, Y114A, was identified that had enhanced ADP-ribose binding but decreased hydrolase activity. This mutation was also significantly attenuated in NSC-34 cells, demonstrating that ADP-ribosyl hydrolase activity alone is important for replication. In this study, de-ADP-ribosylating activity, replication, and virulence did not perfectly correlate, suggesting a role for ADP-ribose binding in virulence. Of note, an additional mutant, R144A, which had normal levels of ADP-ribose binding and hydrolase activity in vitro, quickly reverted in tissue culture cells. This mutation could affect alternative functions of the macrodomain. For example, studies have found that mutations in the ADP-ribose binding domain of the VEEV macrodomain could compensate for mutations in other regions of the genome; however, it is unclear whether these activities were related to de-ADP-ribosylating activity or other functions [45] [46] [47] . Additionally, Lulla et al. found that C-terminal amino acids of the Semliki Forest Virus (SFV) macrodomain are required in the processing of the nsP2/3 cleavage site, which could explain the defect of the R144A mutation [48] .",

In all cases, the mutation was associated with reductions in viral load. It was also shown by both Eriksson et al. and Kuri et al. that the macrodomain could repress IFN production; however, it was unclear if this occurred in vivo and whether it was important for pathogenesis [53, 54] . Fehr et al. found that the SARS-CoV macrodomain repressed IFN and cytokine production both in mice and in a bronchial epithelial cell line [36] . A coinfection with wild type and the macrodomain mutant SARS-CoV demonstrated that the enhanced interferon response was partially protective in mice. Also, the reduced viral load observed in SARS-CoV-infected mice was independent of the IFN response, as viral loads were not increased in IFNAR \u00c0/\u00c0 mice infected with macrodomain mutant virus. In combination, these studies led to the conclusion that the SARS-CoV macrodomain promotes replication in vivo and independently suppresses the IFN response, with both functions playing a role in pathogenesis.",

As such, the primary focus of macrodomain research will likely shift from basic functional and biochemical studies to identifying antiviral PARPs and the protein targets of viral macrodomains (see Outstanding Questions).
