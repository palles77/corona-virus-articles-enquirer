            "text": "The existence of ''tipping points'' in human-environmental systems at multiple scales-such as abrupt negative changes in coral reef ecosystems, ''runaway'' climate change, and interacting nonlinear ''planetary boundaries''-is often viewed as a substantial challenge for governance due to their inherent uncertainty, potential for rapid and large system change, and possible cascading effects on human well-being. Despite an increased scholarly and policy interest in the dynamics of these perceived ''tipping points,'' institutional and governance scholars have yet to make progress on how to analyze in which ways state and non-state actors attempt to anticipate, respond, and prevent the transgression of ''tipping points'' at large scales. In this article, we use three cases of global network responses to what we denote as global change-induced ''tipping points''-ocean acidification, fisheries collapse, and infectious disease outbreaks. Based on the commonalities in several research streams, we develop four working propositions: information processing and early warning, multilevel and multinetwork responses, diversity in response capacity, and the balance between efficiency and legitimacy. We conclude by proposing a simple framework for the analysis of the interplay between perceived global change-induced ''tipping points,'' global networks, and international institutions.",

Such nonlinear change dynamics have been referred to as ''tipping points''. 1 Evidence indicates that many global environmental challenges such as coral reef degradation, ocean acidification, the productivity of agroecosystems, and critical Earth system functions such as global climate regulation display nonlinear properties that could imply rapid and practically irreversible shifts in bio-geophysical and social-ecological systems critical for human well-being (Steffen et al. 2011; Rockstr\u00f6m et al. 2009; Lenton et al. 2008) .",

            "text": "The potential existence of ''tipping points'' represents a substantial multilevel governance challenge for several reasons. First, it is difficult to a priori predict how much disturbances and change a system can absorb before reaching such a perceived ''tipping points'' (Scheffer et al. 2009; Scheffer and Carpenter 2003) , a fact that seriously hampers, and even undermines preventive decision making (Galaz et al. 2010a ; Barrett and Dannenberg 2012) . It has also been argued that even with certainty about the location of a catastrophic ''tipping point,'' present generations still have an incentive to avoid costly preventive measures, and instead are likely to pass on the costs to future generations (Gardiner 2009 , see also Brook et al. 2013; Schlesinger 2009 ). Second, the transgression of ''tipping points''-such as those proposed for coral reef ecosystems due to ocean acidification-can have social-ecological effects that occur over large geographical scales, creating difficult ''institutional mismatches'' as policy makers respond too late or at the wrong organizational level (Walker et al. 2009 ). Third, institutional fragmentation has been argued to seriously limit the ability of actors to effectively address perceived ''tipping point'' characteristics due to inherent system uncertainties, information integration difficulties, and poor incentives for collective action across different sectors and segments of society (Biermann 2012; Galaz et al. 2012) .",

This is troublesome considering that the human enterprise now affects systems with proposed nonlinear properties at the global scale (Steffen et al. 2011; Rockstr\u00f6m et al. 2009 ) and that the features of global environmental governance-i.e., institutions and patterns of collaboration-required to address ''tipping point'' changes are likely to be very different from those needed to harness incremental (linear) environmental stresses (Folke et al. 2005; Duit and Galaz 2008) . While some of the challenges explored here have parallels to attempts to understand the features of international responses to international social nonlinear ''surprise'' phenomena such as financial shocks and other global risks (e.g., Claessens et al. 2010; OECD 2011) , we are particularly interested in the ''tipping point'' dynamics created by coupled human-environmental change.",

This is a challenging empirical task for several reasons. First, because the definitions of ''thresholds,'' their reversibility, and their scale remain contested issues. There is currently an intense scientific debate on the most appropriate way to define and delineate the correct spatial (local-regional-global) and temporal (slow-fast) progression of thresholds (for example, see Brook et al. 2013 , as well as debates about the ''2-degree'' climate target, Hulme 2012 in Knopf et al. 2012) . Second, because the number and types of potential ''tipping points'' relevant for the study of biophysical systems at global scales are too large to be quantifiable, this makes it difficult to draw general conclusions from a limited set of cases studies. Third, while the governance challenges associated with ''tipping points'' have been studied extensively for local-and regional-scale human-environmental systems such as forest ecosystems, freshwater lakes, wetlands, and marine systems (see Plummer et al. 2012 for a synthesis), governance challenges associated with global scale or global change-induced tipping point dynamics are seldom explored despite their identified urgency (Young 2011: 6) .",

This is what we here denote as ''global change-induced tipping points.'' It should be noted that the precise dynamics of the ''tipping points'' in each of the three cases differ and unfold at multiple scales ranging from local to regional and global (see Table 1 for details). Despite this diversity, the phenomena studied here all pose similar detection, prevention, and coordination challenges for social actors at multiple scales of social organization (as elaborated by, e.g., Adger et al. 2009; Pahl-Wostl 2009; Galaz et al. 2010a; Young 2011) .

We do this by identifying and empirically illustrating four working propositions that theoretically seem to be essential for understanding adaptiveness in global networks in the face of ''tipping point'' changes. Secondly, we explore the interplay between perceptions of human-environmental ''tipping points,'' international institutions, and collaboration patterns here operationalized as global networks. This perspective allows for a more cohesive view that combines both exogenous (i.e., perceived ''tipping point'' dynamics) and endogenous (i.e., information sharing mechanisms) factors (sensu Young 2010). We will return to this point in the end of the article. Note that, our ambition is not to ''test'' the proposed features in a statistical sense, but rather to combine in-depth analysis of the case studies, with tentative suggestions that bring to light a number of intriguing and poorly explored issues. While the selection of cases does not provide the generalizability of larger-N studies, it does allow us to examine how the theoretically derived propositions play out in the three different cases, and also provides an opportunity to explore around the potential interplay between variables and causal mechanisms. Our ambition in the longer term is that the analysis presented here can underpin more systematic cross-case comparisons (cf. Gerring 2004) . In some cases, this comparison could be done with ''tipping points'' which play out only in the social domain such as financial crises or responses to transnational security threats (e.g., World Economic Forum 2013).",

The analysis here also has some similarities to the studies of ''regime complexes'' (Orsini et al. 2013) ; however, our emphasis is not on the interplay between regimes or institutions (principles, norms, rules, decision-making procedures), but rather on the constellation, interplay, and functions that emerge between actors from a network perspective.",

While ''tipping points'' thus refer to a variety of complex nonlinear phenomena (including the existence of positive feedbacks, bifurcations, and phase transitions with or without hysteresis effect), they also play out at different scales (from local to global) in very complex, poorly understood , and contested ways (Brook et al. 2013) . Lastly, we believe there is an irreducible social component in identifying, elaborating, and organizing around the existence of ''tipping points.'' The role of mental models, cognitive maps, belief systems, and collective meaning making in decision making has a long history in the study of agency in politics (Benford and Snow 2000; Campbell 2002) and natural resource management (Lynam and Brown 2011) . These aspects related to perceptions clearly also play a role as scientists, governments, and other actors discuss and sometime disagree on their possible existence and appropriate responses (Galaz 2014:16ff) . The important connection between mental models and goal-oriented action are causal beliefs-perceptions of the causes of change-and about the actions that can lead to a desired outcome (Milkoreit 2013:34f) . It should be noted, however, that this study explores the processes of collaboration that occur after social actors implicitly have agreed upon causal beliefs associated with perceived ''tipping points.' ' We thus recognize the multifaceted and complex nature of the term. However, as our goal is to understand how global networks address a diversity of ''tipping points'' induced by global change, we opt for a definition that relates to phenomena exhibiting nonlinear and potentially irreversible change processes in human-environmental systems, which require global responses (see Table 1 ). This definition is intended to capture global changeinduced phenomena, which due to nonlinear properties such as synergistic feedbacks (c.f. Brook et al. 2013:2) have the potential to affect large parts of the world population (c.f. Lenton et al. 2008 ).",

To operationalize the analysis, we thus focus on the outputs and outcomes produced by the actors as they attempt to (a) anticipate, (b) prevent, and (c) respond to perceived ''tipping points.'' Again, our ambition is not to ''test'' the propositions, but rather to use the case studies to empirically explore how global networks attempt to respond to ''tipping point'' challenges, pose novel important questions, and explore how to potentially pursue these questions systematically. Ocean acidification is likely to exhibit critical tipping points associated with rapid loss of coral reefs, as well as complex ocean-climate interactions affecting the oceans' capacities to capture carbon dioxide. The global arena for addressing these interrelated aspects of marine governance is characterized by a lack of effective coordination among the policy areas of marine biodiversity, fisheries, climate change, and ocean acidification. This has triggered collaboration between a number of international organizations within the Global Partnership for Climate, Fisheries and Aquaculture (henceforth Pacfa). Currently, this initiative includes representatives from the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), WorldFish, The World Bank, and 13 additional international organizations , see also Fig. 1 ).",

These networks (henceforth global epidemic networks) also span across organizational levels and include among other the World Health Organization (WHO), the World Organization for Animal Health (OIE), the Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO), the Red Cross, Doctors without Borders. These networks facilitate responses to epidemic emergencies of international concern by providing early warning signals, rapid laboratory analysis, information dissemination, and coordination of epidemic emergency response activities on the ground (Galaz 2011 ",

Based on these streams of literature, we extract four working propositions to guide the analysis of the empirical material. These propositions should not be viewed as allembracing principles for ''success,'' but rather as suggested and empirically assessable governance functions at play as international actors aim to detect, respond, and prevent the implications of ''tipping point'' environmental change. The propositions also allow a concluding reflection of the interplay between international institutions, global changeinduced ''tipping points,'' and global networks.",

These information processing capacities are for example identified as critical by, e.g., Dietz et al. (2003 Dietz et al. ( :1908 in their elaboration of the features of governance, which support adaptiveness to environmental change; Van Baalen's and van Fenema's (2009) analysis of global network responses to epidemic surprise; and by Boin et al. (2005:140ff) and their synthesis of information processing capacities, which allow state and non-state actors to respond to crises (see also Comfort 1988; Dodds et al. 2003) .

For example, Folke et al. (2005) explore the need to build linkages between a diversity of actors at multiple levels to be able to successfully deal with nonlinear social-ecological change (see also Pahl-Wostl 2009); Pearson and Clair's (1998:13) synthesis of organizational crises identify resource availability through external stakeholders as key for successful responses (see also Boin et al. 2005 ; Van Baalen and van Fenema 2009); Galaz et al. (2010a:12) synthesis also indicate that cross-level and multiactor responses are key for overcoming institutional fragmentation in responses to abrupt human-environmental change; and Edelenbos et al. (2013) explore the features of ''connective capacities,'' which allow coordinating actors to constructively connect to actors from different layers, domains, and sectors. Therefore, we propose that global networks need to build a capacity to coordinate actors at multiple levels and from different networks as they attempt to respond to potential ''tipping points'' of concern. It also seems reasonable that responses could focus on producing either a set of outcomes (regulation, polices, or supporting infrastructure) or outputs (behavioral changes with direct impacts on the system of interest, including coordinated action) (Young 2011).",

Hence, it is difficult to know beforehand exactly where and what kind of resources may be needed. As several scholars across disciplines have noted, developing and maintaining a diversity of resources is one way to help prepare for the unexpected. For example, Moynihan's (2008:361) analysis of learning in organizational networks indicates that the maintenance of actor and resource diversity in networks is fundamental for reducing strategic and institutional uncertainty (see also Koppenjan and Klijn 2004) . Bodin and Crona (2009) explore the role of social networks in natural resource management and note that actor diversity is key for not only effective learning, but also provides a fertile ground for innovation. Social-ecological scholars such as Folke et al. (2005:449) , Low et al. (2003) , and Dietz et al. (2003) also make a strong case for institutional and actor diversity as a prerequisite for coping with environmental change and as a factor that allows actors to quickly ''bounce back'' after shocks. These proposals bear resemblances with ideas inspired by cybernetic principles about the need to understand the impacts of ''requisite variety'' in governance, that is, the informational, structural, and functional redundancies that emerge as the result of inter-organizational collaboration in governance networks (Jessop 1998) . It also has parallels existing studies about complexity leadership in network settings (Balkundi and Kilduff 2006; Hoppe and Reinelt 2010) . To simplify the analysis, however, we focus less on the role of individual leaders, their cognition, and strategies, but rather on common structural properties and aggregated behavior across the cases.",

As Young (2011) summarizes it, the ''[m]aintenance of feelings of fairness and legitimacy is important to effectiveness, especially in cases where success requires active participation on the part of the members of the group over time.'' Legitimacy relates not only to the ability of actors to follow appropriate rules or procedures (input legitimacy) but also to deliver expected results in the face of perceived urgent issues of common interest (output legitimacy) (van Kersbergen and van Waarden 2004) . Moynihan (2008) also notes that trust based on perceived legitimacy plays a key role in the coordination of multiple networks by reducing strategic uncertainty (pp. 357).

This network benefits from several well-established compliance mechanisms developed over time, including an electronic catch documentation scheme and information collected from satellite monitoring of vessel activities . Non-state actors also contribute to monitoring by reporting suspected vessel sightings or trade flows (\u00d6 sterblom and Bodin 2012). All information collected is reviewed annually by CCAMLR, where consensus decisions are taken to blacklist suspected vessels or impose other sanctions. Similar features can be identified for information processing in global epidemic networks. Severe problems with national reporting of disease outbreaks spurred a new generation of Internet-based monitoring systems in the mid-1990s, including the Global Public Health Intelligence Network (GPHIN) hosted by Health Canada, combining Internet datamining technologies and expert analysis, as well as global and moderated epidemic alert e-mail lists and platforms such as ProMED and HealthMap.org (Galaz 2011) . These systems have vastly increased the amount of epidemic early warnings processed by key international organizations such as the WHO and the Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO).

For example, while a overall network aim was initially to influence international climate negotiations in Copenhagen 2009 to integrate marine issues, the path toward this goal consisted of multiple coordinated actions at multiple levels (from assessing potential adaptation needs locally, communicating these, and influencing national delegations at side events to COP15). This required a capacity among a core group of actors (FAO) to tap into resources and knowledge across levels and networks, including international scientific institutions (such as ICES), international organizations (World Bank), and place-based research NGOs (WorldFish) ).",

This has led to repeated calls for governance reforms aiming to increase transparency, effectiveness, and benefit sharing. It should be noted that border protection issues, primarily associated with the fear of new terror attacks after September 11 2001 in the form of intentional releases of novel diseases, have triggered substantial investments in global epidemic monitoring and response networks for disease outbreaks. Analogous national security concerns in Australia after the national elections in the year of 2001, and the Bali bombings in 2002, likely contributed to an increased political opportunity to invest substantially in monitoring technologies for the Southern Ocean, as border protection became ''securitized'' (\u00d6 sterblom et al. 2011 ). In addition, international cooperation and exchange of information between compliance officers has increased substantially after the terrorist attacks in New York City in 2001. The expansion of the studied two networks described here thus appears to be linked to the securitization of the issue areas, which may have important implications for their perceived legitimacy in the future (c.f.

All cases used the same methodology, combining document studies, simple network analysis, and semi-structured interviews with key international actors (a total of about 65 interviews for all cases). Interviewees have been selected strategically to reflect an expected diversity of interests, resources, and role in the network collaboration of interest. The material has been structured and complemented with additional published and ''gray'' literature to elaborate the five overarching subjects below. These five subjects were identified during a series of author workshops and aimed to provide a structured overview of the perception of the problem to be addressed, the emergence of the network studied, as well as its function, effectiveness, and perceived legitimacy.

This process is changing ocean chemistry, making oceans more acidic, with potentially enormous negative consequences for a wide range of marine species and societies as a result of losses of ecosystem services. Recent research suggests that ocean acidification is likely to exhibit critical ''tipping points'' associated with rapid loss of coral reefs, as well as complex ocean-climate interactions affecting the oceans' capacities to capture carbon dioxide. The global arena for addressing these interrelated aspects of marine governance is characterized by a lack of effective coordination among the policy areas of marine biodiversity, fisheries, climate change, and ocean acidification. This has stimulated an attempt to better bridge these policy domains to increase coordination aimed at addressing potential critical tipping points. A number of international organizations primarily involved in fisheries initiated the Global Partnership on Climate, Fisheries, and Aquaculture (from hereon Pacfa) in 2008. Currently, this initiative includes representatives from FAO, UNEP, WorldFish, The World Bank, and 13 additional international organizations (Fig. 1) .

Tipping points related to these variables are possible within decades, but there is currently limited institutional capacity or development to address these integrated challenges Galaz et al.

The network emerged after repeated discussions between individuals centrally placed at international organizations. There was a perceived need to coordinate marine activities and connect them to the global climate agenda Galaz et al. (2011) . 3d. The network started with a few individuals and their respective organizations, and has grown over time. PaCFA has evolved from a loose communication network, to a formal partnership and recently (2010) became a UN Oceans-Taskforce. 3 It is currently unclear how it will develop over time, but it will likely remain (as a minimum) a communication-based learning and coordinating network. Evolution toward tangible joint field projects depends heavily on funding, see Galaz et al. (2011) . 3e. In a context where climate change is high on the political agenda, but where there is a limited understanding of the associated challenges and limited political connection between those challenges. 3f. The evolution of the network has gained modest support from governments through the FAO and its member states. The network successfully coordinated their activities with the Indonesian government during the climate negotiations leading up to the meeting in Copenhagen 2010 (COP 15). We have not identified any explicit opposition to the network. 3g. Coordination is assumed by a small number of key organizations, centered around the FAO. This institutional affiliation provides the network with legitimacy, connections, and necessary competence. However, it is also vulnerable as much of the coordination is centered around a small number of individuals, see Galaz et al. (2011) . 3h. Key coordinator of network has clear mandate by the FAO, and its work is embedded in UN Law of the Seas, and the Convention on Biological Diversity Galaz et al. (2011) . It should be noted however that ocean acidification and protection of marine ecosystems such as coral reef ecosystems have been denoted as ''non-regimes' ' Dimitrov et al. (2007) . The lack of formal regimes or institutions devoted to ocean acidification has however not been identified as a problem by key actors in network. Key barriers perceived by the network to further develop their work is rather a lack of funding and political support for the implementation of ecosystem-based approaches in marine systems, see Galaz et al. (2011) . 3i. Transparency is limited due to the informal structure of this network, see Galaz et al. (2011) . 3j. A number of issues related to internal legitimacy have been raised by network members especially related to the use of scientific organizations as leverage to influence international policy processes . Coordinating actors try to resolve external legitimacy challenges through actively recruiting members that secure a representation of diverse interests in the network, e.g., ranging from international organizations, to scientific organizations and NGO's in the global south. 3k. Political lobbying aimed at influencing policy makers and policy processes through providing science-based synthesis describing the risk of transgressing possible future ''tipping points'' ). 4a. Network members monitor different aspects of problems associated with climate changeocean acidification-marine biodiversity, however, only in a fragmented way. Marine ecological parameters are the main focus of monitoring activities ). 4b. There is an explicit focus on the need for action before critical ''tipping points'' have been transgressed. The network describes this situation as ''self-regulating and buffering processes [could] break down, leading to irreversible consequences.'' 4 This message is part of the information material and technical reports produced by the network. 4c. The network primarily coordinates its activities around political opportunities. The network deals primarily with knowledge diffusion among its members, attempts to coordinate local coastal marine management or climate adaptation projects, and highlevel lobbying. Scientific syntheses coordinated by the network play a key role for this last activity. For example, actors in the network were trying to gain international momentum for their cause and focused all their activities on trying to influence the international climate negotiations in Copenhagen 2009, with an ambition to integrate marine issues in those discussions. This required the capacity of all core actors in the network to tap into resources and knowledge, including international scientific institutions (e.g., ICES), international organizations (FAO, World Bank), and placebased research NGOs (WorldFish, with over a hundred partners, including universities and non-government organizations in the South). These syntheses not only provide an opportunity to bring together insights, but also feed into lobbying at high-level policy arenas ). 4d. E-mail and Web pages are the primary tools for information dissemination and communication in the network 4e. Funding over the long term and a lack of political support for implementing ecosystem-based management 5a. Scientific reports and workshops where members are updated about scientific advances related to marine systems, and climate change and ocean acidification are the major outputs of the network. Members also engage in continuous information sharing about relevant meetings. 5b. The outcomes have hitherto bee limited. The network does currently not have the necessary infrastructure or economic and human resources to engage in large-scale projects related to marine climate adaptation.",

This is particularly critical, as coordinated responses are needed in order to avoid transgressing critical epidemic thresholds. A range of networks, from surveillance, laboratory, and expert networks, have emerged to secure information on early warning signals, mechanisms for rapid dissemination of information and coordinating responses. These networks are both global and regional, and include the WHO, the World Organization for Animal Health (OIE), the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), the Red Cross, Doctors without Borders, and additional international and national organization. The networks facilitate responses to epidemic emergencies of international concern by providing early warning signals, rapid laboratory analysis, information dissemination, and coordination of activities in the field.",

Tipping points where disease becomes a matter of international concern can develop within the time frame of weeks. A global response capacity may be required within days or weeks, depending on disease characteristics (Wallinga and Teunis 2004) . 1c.

The spread of disease will be increasingly difficult to control if the spread of the disease exceed the basic reproduction number R 0 [ 1. The basis reproduction number is defined by virulence, transmissibility, and severity (Wallinga and Teunis 2004) . 2.

There has been a rapid evolution of health-related networks (regional and/or disease specific), especially since the 1990s and 2000s. A coordination mechanism at the WHO specifically designed for rapid response to infectious disease emerged around 2000 and became formalized in 2005 (Fidler 2004; Galaz 2009 ). 3b.

A number of serious disease outbreaks of international concern in the early 2000s (Rift Valley fever, Ebola, Anthrax, avian influenza, SARS) led to a change in cooperation and the development of a new international legal framework (The IHRs) in 2005. An increased awareness of the potential global nature of pandemics thus enabled better coordination of networks that had developed from the 1990s (Fidler 2004; Galaz 2009 ). 3d. The networks have evolved incrementally over several decades, but with a rapid increase from 2003 and onwards. This development was stimulated by an increasing international concern and improved funding opportunities from international organizations and the USA (Fidler 2004; Galaz 2009 ). 3e. Increasing international concerns of emerging infectious diseases from the 1990s and onward, such as outbreaks of avian influenza (years 1997, 2003-2004,) and US border protection security concerns related to terrorist attacks (deliberate introduction of lethal infectious disease) after the September 11 attacks in 2001, triggered rapid investments in global monitoring and response networks. These events also contributed to changes in the IHR in 2005 (Fidler 2004 ). 3f. There is strong international support. However, some countries have also raised concerns. Indonesia, for example, supplied H5N1 virus to the WHO Global Influenza Surveillance Network for analysis and preparation of vaccines for the world. The model where commercial companies produce the resulting vaccines was questioned by Indonesia arguing that the produced vaccines would be unavailable to the country. In 2007, Indonesia decided to suspend its sharing of viruses with the WHO, a decision that created serious tensions with the international community (Fidler 2008) . More recently, there has also been concerns voiced by a wide set of groups about the connection between the WHO and pharmaceutical companies as the result of the last pandemic outbreak (''swineflu'' A/H1N1) (Zarocostas 2011) . 3g. Coordination is facilitated by international organizations such as the WHO, FAO, and OIE. The ability to rapidly receive, analyze, and disseminate alerts and responses is substantially facilitated by this coordination. Rapid evaluation is key and is supported by crisis management structures such as early warning and confirmation mechanisms (Galaz 2011 ). 3h. The activities are regulated by the IHRs and related technical plans [e.g., WHO's pandemic response plans (WHO 2005) ] provide formal guidance for coordination and action. However, these formal mechanisms are complemented with informal response procedures to maximize flexibility. The informal procedures create flexibility to emerging surprise events, but within a legal framework (WHO 2005) . However, responses to emerging infectious diseases such as avian influenza tend to be contested and may be conceptualized differently by different actors depending on national political agendas and cultural contexts (Dry and Leach 2010). 3i. WHO and associated partners redefine key policies based on criticism and changing circumstances. The importance of such activities has become apparent after controversial events, such as recent discussions about the role of WHO in issuing a pandemic alert for the 2009 outbreak of A/H1N1 (''swineflu''). 3j. The coordinating actors in the network (mainly WHO, FAO) are generally viewed as legitimate, but concerns have also arisen. Events that generated criticism include the association between the network and corporate interests (Zarocostas 2011 ) and controversy about the best effective means to respond to outbreaks, and the distribution of costs related to these responses (Dry and Leach 2010). 3k. The networks take action through the coordination of information (laboratory analysis, early warning, confirmation) and collaboration around response options on the ground. 4a. A wide variety of sophisticated monitoring systems are in place and are enabled depending on the disease. The WHO is collaborating extensively with the Canadian GPHIN, which has created an effective system for early detection of the spread of epidemic disease through Web-monitoring. The use of satellite technology is important in some cases and is complemented with information platforms such as HealthMap and the moderated e-mail list ProMED (Galaz 2011) . Monitoring centers on reports on disease outbreaks, but underlying drivers (e.g., land-use change and urbanization trends) are not included in such monitoring (Galaz 2009 ). 4b. Actions and investments are coordinated around pandemic phases, where action at the national and international level is dependent on the current assessment of the current status and spread of the disease (the pandemic phase), but also on the need for actions that maintain spread within certain levels (WHO 2005). 4c. Through well-developed formal and informal mechanisms for cooperation, elaborate monitoring systems and large geographical spread and capacity (Galaz 2011 ). 4d. Information and communication technologies are crucial in all aspects of coordinated network responses, ranging from early warnings to on-the-ground responses. WHO regularly sets up videoconferences and secure Web pages to facilitate rapid scientific collaboration on urgent epidemic issues (Galaz 2011) . 4e. There are concerns that reduced future funding will hamper current monitoring and response infrastructure. There are also concerns that additional funding and political interest for investigating in general (preventive) health infrastructure is lacking in many developing countries (IOM and NRC 2008) . Critics have raised the issue that the focus is perhaps too much on disease of international concern, thereby obscuring other and more urgent national epidemic needs (Dry and Leach 2010) . 5a. The network has generated a large number of reports and technical documents (e.g., 12 and the WHO Weekly Epidemiological Record available online: http://www.who. int/wer/en/). Continuous national, regional, and national meetings are being conducted for information sharing and capacity building (both disease specific and with regional focus). 5b. Outcomes are difficult to measure as evaluation criteria are contested. There are several successful case studies where unprecedented rapid international responses have been reported, especially for severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2002.",

The toothfish market is essentially global, where products are caught around the Antarctic, landed in the Southern hemisphere, and primarily consumed in the USA, Japan, and Europe. The fact that actors involved in IUU fishing are also dispersed globally necessitates coordination between states on all continents. The regional mandate of the existing international governance institution, CCAMLR (Commission for the CCAMLR), initially proved insufficient to address this global challenge. As a response, state and non-state actors increasingly developed their networks and are currently operating at the global level (Fig. 1, SI) . Continuous coordinated international responses around adjacent islands have resulted in a dramatic reduction in IUU fishing. States now have a well-developed mechanism for coordinated monitoring and response when new actors, markets, or IUU fishing are emerging in the Southern Ocean.",

            "text": "1a. The scientific committee of the Commission for the CCAMLR has repeatedly warned for the imminent risk if collapsing valuable fish stocks and the extinction of globally threatened seabirds throughout the Southern Ocean (SC-CAMLR 1997 , SC-CAMLR 2002 . This has caused serious concern in the Commission and threatened perceived critical commercial and environmental interest. Passing regional tipping points for these resources would represent a failure of CCAMLR to live up to the Convention on the CAMLR, which explicitly state that these resources should be protected for the benefit of mankind. 1b. Tipping points related to fish stocks and seabirds was expected within years, and a coordinated response was required before such tipping points were passed (\u00d6 sterblom and Sumaila 2011). 1c. Key uncertainties include where IUU fishing (in the Southern Ocean) emerge next, where the products are landed and which actors and states would be involved in such activities (\u00d6 sterblom et al. 2010 )? 1d. A failure to regulate coastal fisheries and fishing capacity has resulted in collapsing fish stocks combined with an overcapacity of existing fishing fleets. Such fleets will move elsewhere (further South, further offshore, and fishing at larger depths (Pauly et al. 2003; Swartz et al. 2010) , which may result in IUU fishing (Agnew et al. 2009 ). Such IUU fishing dramatically reduced naturally long-lived and late maturing fish and seabird populations to low levels in the Southern Ocean (SC-CAMLR 1997; \u00d6 sterblom et al. 2010; Miller et al. 2010 ). 2. The problem is global as IUU vessels are highly mobile across large geographical areas. These vessels may change their flag state, call sign and other identifying markers to avoid detection and apprehension (\u00d6 sterblom et al. 2010) . IUU actors use loopholes in international legal frameworks to their advantage and adapt faster than formal institutions develop (\u00d6 sterblom and Sumaila 2011; \u00d6 sterblom et al. 2010). 3a. The network started to emerge from 1997 as a result of the scientific information provided to the meeting of CCAMLR that year (SC-CAMLR 1997). 3b. The Australian government, together with NGOs from Australia and Norway, collaborated with licensed fishing industries to collect initial information (Fallon and Kriwoken 2004 ). 3c. The global network evolved from CCAMLR, an organization with a regional mandate. The rationale for the network to start cooperating informally was a perceived inability of governments to take actions before tipping points would be passed (\u00d6 sterblom and Bodin 2012). 3d. The network used CCAMLR as a basis for action and developed starting with a small number of countries, which invested substantially in monitoring and enforcement, policy making and diplomatic demarches (\u00d6 sterblom and Sumaila 2011; \u00d6 sterblom and Bodin 2012). A small number of NGOs also cooperated to collect and spread information, in collaboration with licensed fishing companies (Fallon and Kriwoken 2004) . Over time, an increasing number of states and non-state actors became involved in collecting and sharing information and formalizing cooperation (\u00d6 sterblom and Sumaila 2011). Members of the network have carried out training workshops in strategic locations. Strategic capacity building has been directed toward regions with limited capacity but where ports have been used for offloading IUU catches. 3e. Depletion of coastal fish resources shifted commercial fishing enterprises, but also political interests, toward the high seas (beyond the 200 nautical mile zone). This led to increasing global policy concern about IUU fishing and could also be politically connected to border protection security. This was evident in Australia and the USA, particularly after the September 11 attacks in New York City in 2001, the Tampa affair and the Bali bombings in 2002 (\u00d6 sterblom and Sumaila 2011; Constable et al. 2010 ). 3f. Addressing IUU fishing has been a key challenge for CCAMLR as some member states have been associated with IUU fishing, e.g., as flag, or port states or with their nationals working on board IUU vessels or as owners of IUU companies. This has at times resulted in substantial controversy and heated debate (\u00d6 sterblom and Sumaila 2011). 3g. CCAMLR has a well-developed mechanism for obtaining, processing, and sharing of information (from state and non-state actors) through its secretariat. Non-state actors are improving the effectiveness of monitoring and enforcement, by for example reporting on suspected vessel sightings, and by creating peer-pressure directed at states and corporations associated with IUU fishing (\u00d6 sterblom and Bodin 2012). 3h. An international convention (CAMLR) is regulating the activities within CCAMLR, and governments are also bound by global legal agreements (UN-FSA 1995) and codes of conducts (FAO 2005) . Information sharing has been facilitated by CCAMLR protocols specifically designed to address IUU fishing. CCAMLR provides an operational and transparent platform for cooperation but new measures can be hampered by the need to arrive at consensus. 3i. All Commission reports are published online but background reports, including reports on diplomatically sensitive issues, are only published at a password protected Web site for delegates 3j. Disputes about some sub-Antarctic islands (notably between Argentina and the UK) represent a long-standing conflict. Arrested IUU operators have expressed the opinion that exclusive economic zones in the Southern Ocean are illegitimate. Several nations have clear benefits from fishing and also conduct expensive monitoring and enforcement. There are no benefit or burden sharing mechanisms in place (\u00d6 sterblom and Sumaila 2011). 3k. Operational management, coordinated response, and policy making are the primary tools for action. Countries collaborate to monitor and enforce compliance and form alliances to develop new policies (\u00d6 sterblom and Bodin 2012). 4a. Cooperative international scientific surveys document the dynamics of fish stocks (Constable et al. 2010 ). This network around CCAMLR to address IUU fishing monitor fishing vessel activities and trade flows (\u00d6 sterblom and Bodin 2012). 4b. The scientific committee reports annually on the estimated levels of IUU catches and estimate the risk of tipping points, both in relation to fish stocks and seabird populations. A corresponding committee for evaluating compliance-related information review, at an annual basis, related social information (trade flows, vessel activities, etc.) (\u00d6 sterblom and Bodin 2012). 4c. The secretariat serves as an important hub in the network by coordinating information flows. Responses are coordinated through either rapid engagement of partners to secure the seizure of a catch or vessel (between states), cooperation to perform alternative investigations (the fishing industry) or information campaigns (NGO community), or political lobbying for new policy tools (\u00d6 sterblom and Bodin 2012). 4d. Satellite technology monitor vessel activities and an electronic catch documentation schemes provide information on trade flows (\u00d6 sterblom and Bodin 2012). Forensic accounting is an important tool for criminal investigations, which has been pioneered by US agencies and applied in convicting cases associated with IUU operations in the CCAMLR area. 4e. Financial costs (monitoring is very expensive) depends on a small number of actors, governance capacity is limited in several countries used as port or flag states, and political will may influence the capacity of CCAMLR to adapt to new challenges. 5a. CCAMLR have developed a number of compliance mechanisms over time and is increasingly developing formal and informal governance mechanisms in order to effectively respond to IUU fishing in the Southern Ocean (\u00d6 sterblom and Sumaila 2011). 5b. Continuous coordinated international responses around sub-Antarctic islands and beyond have resulted in a dramatic reduction in IUU fishing (\u00d6 sterblom and Bodin 2012).",
