            "text": "In chickens, the infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) often causes respiratory distress, a decrease in egg production, poor egg quality, and occasional nephritis. However, ZZ2004, a Chinese isolate of IBV, was obtained from ducks with clinical growth suppression and mild respiratory symptoms that had been reared with chickens in the central region of China. Virus isolation, virus neutralization testing, and RT-PCR were employed to identify the causative pathogen, while sequence alignment was used to analyze gene variations of the S1 subunit and M genes. The results showed that the ducks were infected with IBV due to the emergence of a dwarfing phenotype and the death of embryos between 48 and 144 h post-inoculation. RT-PCR also confirmed the presence of the expected fragment sizes of the S1 subunit and M genes by RT-PCR. Meanwhile, the results of the virus neutralization test indicated that the strains of JX/99/01, GD, SAIBK, LDT3 showed cross-reactivity with the ZZ2004 isolate, and hardly any crossneutralization of IBV ZZ2004 was observed with the strains of M41, H120, Gray, Holte, or Aust-T. Phylogenetic analysis suggested that there were large differences between ZZ2004 and other IBV reference strains on the S1 subunit. Meanwhile, homologies in the nucleotide and amino acid sequences of the M gene of IBV ZZ2004 were 86.9-92.0 % and 91.1-93.9 %, respectively, compared with 35 other IBV reference strains derived from different regions. This result revealed that there were conspicuous variations among the selected strains. Furthermore, the results showed that the prevalent strains of IBV in ducks had no antigen homology with the vaccine strains widely used in China except the LDT3-strain, making it urgent to explore and develop new IBV vaccines.",

More than 20 IBV serotypes have been identified worldwide, which might emerge due to gene deletion, gene substitution, gene insertion, and/or RNA recombination of the S1 subunit [ 10] . The emergence of many IBV serotypes is a major problem in the poultry industry, which causes high disease incidence and production losses due to infections with strains serologically different from the vaccine strains [11, 12] . In recent years, it is believing that avian coronavirus has a wider host range than it was previously thought, not only in galliform (chicken-like) birds (peafowl), but also in non-galliform birds (teal or duck species) [13] . Moreover, novel data [13] have been reported to support the notion that some host-specific CoVs other than IBVs are circulating in ducks, pigeons, and geese, and the novel duck-specific CoV is genetically closer to some CoVs circulating in wild water fowls. Newer surveillance also demonstrated that duck-specific CoV was the same with IBV prevalent in live poultry markets in some regions of China [14] . Indeed, some of the long-known mammalian coronaviruses have a wider host range than their names would suggest, such as SARS virus.",

            "text": "IBV is a member of the family Coronaviridae [15] , which consists of several enveloped viruses. It replicates in the cell cytoplasm and contains an unsegmented, singlestranded, and positive-sense RNA of approximately 27-32 kb. IBV has four structural proteins (S, E, M, and N): the spike (S) glycoprotein, the small envelope (E) protein, the membrane (M) glycoprotein, and the nucleocapsid (N) protein [16, 17] , which are encoded by subgenomic mRNAs (sgRNAs) 2, 3,4, and 6, respectively [18, 19] . The structural genes, together with other open reading frames (ORFs), organize the typical avian coronavirus genome characterized by the order 5 0 -ORF1a-ORF1b-S-3a-3b-E-M-5a-5b-N-UTR-3 0 [18, 20] . It is commonly accepted that the IBV serotype is determined by the S gene, particularly the hypervariable S1 subunit. Moreover, previous reports have shown that the host range can be determined by the surface spike glycoprotein (S). For example, a genetically manipulated murine coronavirus with the S protein of feline coronavirus replicates in feline cells [21] . Though the M protein, a polytopic membrane protein, is the most abundant component of coronavirions, it is required in virus assembly and budding, and involved in virion morphogenesis. For the identification and clinical signs of pathogenic viruses, proper protein genes in the viral genome are needed to be selected for phylogenetic analysis, due to the presence of large mutations in the highly variable regions.",

Currently, the serotypes, including Mass, T, Holte, and Gray, were prevalent in China and there were also other variants. However, IBV outbreak remains common and continues to cause large economic losses in the poultry industry, despite intensive vaccination policies, due to gene mutations and gene re-combinations. Since the first IBV isolate was found in China, the inactivated oil emulsion and live attenuated vaccines used with different strains (such as H120, H52, Ma5, W93, and M41) have been used to prevent and control the disease. Moreover, most of the currently used commercial vaccines, such as H120, H52, and M41, belonged to the Mass type. In 2004, a virulent IBV strain was isolated in 30-day-old ducks reared with broilers vaccinated with H120 and M41 in the Henan Province of central China. A novel coronavirus, ZZ2004 virus, fulfilling all of Koch's postulates, was announced to be the primary etiological agent of ducks on September 22, 2012 by Xingyou Liu (patent in Chinese NO. ZL201010225577.4). To further reveal the nature of the virus, it was identified by virus isolation, virus neutralization test, RT-PCR, sequence alignment, and phylogenetic analysis.

It is challenging to eradicate by routine vaccination due to the emergence of viral variants. In this study, 15 specimens were taken from a duck flock reared together with chickens that had been subjected to a full vaccination program of both live and inactivated IB vaccines in Henan province, China, in 2004, as part of a wider animal surveillance program for identifying potential reservoirs of animal coronaviruses.

The vaccine strains widely used in China, such as Ma5, H52, H120, and W93, belong to groups 1 and 3. That might explain the reason for IBV infection in chickens and ducks vaccinated with at least two types of vaccines in China.",
