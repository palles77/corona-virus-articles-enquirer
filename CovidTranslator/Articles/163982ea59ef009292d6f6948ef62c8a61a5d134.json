This dataset has a 30 arc second resolution, equating to approximately <1km for US and GB latitudes. The dataset is a model of population density which is constructed from census, remote sensing, land use and transport network data. It is a model of instantaneous population density (i.e. where people are at an instant of time) rather than residential population density, but is very comparable to high resolution census data for GB and US, and has the advantage of being rasterized -while census datasets are defined for populations within with irregularly shaped and variable size administrative units (e.g. census tracts). For the USA, we modelled transmission the continental US (excl. Hawaii and Alaska), and (allowing for the 3 million per year growth rate) assumed a total population size of 300 million 2 . For the UK, we modelled Great Britain alone, and assumed a population size of 58.1 million 3 .",

These methods allocate children to schools using a free selection algorithm; each child 'picks' a school at random from the nearest 3 (for primary) or 6 (for secondary) schools of the appropriate type, with a probability weighted by the distance kernel derived from UK census data on commuting behaviour (see below). Restricting school choice to the nearest 3 or 6 schools avoids unrealistic long tails to the distribution of distances travelled to school, albeit at the cost of slightly underestimating mean distances travelled to school by approximately 30% 8 . Staff student ratios were used to determine the proportion of adults to schools rather than other workplaces.",

In this case, a free-selection algorithm could not be used to assign pupils to schools, as schools had predetermined numbers of pupils of different ages. Instead, we used the worker to workplace algorithm 6 , but with a very local selection kernel of form f(d)~1/[1+d/a] b , where a=14 km and b=11. This gave an average distance from household to school of 7.7km (4.8 miles), in agreement with detailed survey data 10 and broadly in line with other less specific data on average trip distance travelled from home to school or church 11 .",

However, short distance estimates shown in Figure SI4 are still likely to be subject to some biases/error -for instance, due to the fact that only distances between tract/ward centroids are known, not precise journey distances.",

Air traffic on these carriers account for 90% of domestic air-travel. These data include the origin and destination of each leg or flight included in an itinerary. Itineraries consist of at least one leg, but vary in the number of legs included. These data are aggregated by quarter of travel. A major deficiency of this dataset is that no temporal data is included in the itineraries. This makes it impossible to identify the true destination of each itinerary (i.e. the location people intended to reach, not flight connection locations) or how much time passengers spend at each destination in their journey.

Destination airport was chosen at random to match the observed origin-destination flows for the origin airport. Destination hotel was picked at random using a kernel depending on distance between destination airport and hotel as f(d)~1/[1+d/a] b , where a=70 km and b=5. No data were found to justify this arbitrary parameter choice, however the resulting kernel is relatively flat out to 50km, and is intended to reflect the relatively long distances many people travel from their destination airport and final destination.

Peak daily attack rates and the timing of the first case in a country (and to a lesser extent the timing of the peak of a national epidemic) were more variable (see Figure 1d of main text), but averages could be reasonably well determined with between 5 and 20 realisations (though it should be noted that the standard deviations plotted in the error bars of Figures 2-4 in the main text are less precisely determined) .

In addition, the availability of such vaccine stockpiles reduces the size of antiviral stockpile needed for either household or school/workplace prophylaxis policies. Second, household quarantine is potentially a highly effective social distance measure, but only if compliance with the policy is good. Reactive school closure (Tables SI1 and 2 ) has a limited impact in reducing peak attack rates (but not cumulative attack rates) and enhancing other policies. For the high transmissibility scenario ( 0 R =2.0) only policies relying only on 99% border controls can delay spread by enough to enable pandemic vaccine to substantially reduce attack rates (vaccine is assumed to be produced from month 4 of the global epidemic) -and then only if coupled with large-scale social and household prophylaxis.",

Even if R 0 were as high as 2.8, the global rate of spread would still be some 40% slower than for a 'human-like' virus (T g =2.6 days) with R 0 =1.8. There is a caveat to this discussion: spread is only slower if T g increases so long as 0 R does not also increase. The worst-case scenario would be that a 'H5N1-like' pandemic would have daily infectiousness comparable with peak infectiousness in a 'normal' human influenza infection, but that instead of this level of infectiousness only lasting 1-2 days, it might continue for 7+ days. Such a scenario would result in 0 R values of 6-10, with little hope for any of the controls considered in this paper having a significant impact -outside the direct clinical impact of antiviral treatment. Arguably, however, if influenza had the potential to have such a high 0 R value, mutation would have already generated such a variant -given the huge epidemiological fitness advantage to be gained from having a 3-5-fold higher total infectiousness.",

In this policy, a school is closed for a fixed period following the first case in the school. The school then reopens, but can close again if more cases are diagnosed. In addition, 10% of workplaces are assumed to close in a similar manner (this is intended to crudely represent the impact of absenteeism of carers and spontaneous closure of a minority of non-essential workplaces). Figure SI12 shows how the impact of a reactive school closure policy depends on the duration of closure following diagnosis of cases in the school population. The best impact is of course achieved by 12 or more weeks of continuous closure, but the dependence is weak, as shorter periods of closure are partly compensated for by schools closing repeatedly (as new cases arise after each school reopens). For the high-transmissibility scenario, all closure periods of 3 weeks or more give cumulative attack rates between 28% and 29%. School closure has a much larger impact on peak attack rates, and paradoxically, 3 weeks of closure at a time minimises peak attack rates for the high-transmissibility scenario. We think this is because this choice of closure period maximises the desynchrony of timing of closure between schools, while still having sufficient overall impact to substantially reduce transmission rates in schools. Figure SI12 : Dependence of the effect of school closure on the number of weeks each school is closed Results assume a school is closed the day after the first case is detected in the staff of pupils of the school. 10% of workplaces are also assumed to close for the same period.

Figure SI13 shows how the impact of reactive school closure depends on the threshold number of cases which need to accumulate in the staff and pupils of a school before closure is triggered. As expected, the impact of closure is highest for closure after the first case, but impact does not diminish significantly so long as closure occurs before 5 cases have accumulated. This is encouraging for the robustness of the reactive school closure policy to poor case reporting rates. This is not the only model of school closure of course. As an alternative we also examined area closure, in which when a case arises in an area, all schools within 10km of that case are closed for a fixed period. For 0 R =2.0, cumulative and peak daily attack rates in the UK were reduced from 34% and 2.1% respectively to 31.5% and 1.6% respectively by the reactive policy of 3 weeks of closure, while the area policy reduced them to 31.2% and 1.6% respectively for the same duration of closure. For 0 R =1.7, cumulative and peak daily attack rates were reduced from 28% and 1.2% respectively to 23.7% and 0.93% respectively by the 3 week reactive policy, while the area policy reduced them to 23.3% and 0.90% respectively. These results are for a policy of school closure alone (i.e. no associated treatment). The marginal difference between the policies reflects the fact that both result in nearly all schools being shut for 95% of the time during the peak 12-14 weeks of the pandemic.

The split of the increases between household and community is intended to represent the fact that even if children are advised to stay at home during a school closure period (so that inter-child mixing is limited), childcare maybe performed by people other than members of a child's household (e.g. carers, extended family members etc).

Transmission coefficients in the household, school/workplace and community were adjusted to give the same overall proportion of transmission in these settings, and reduces the size of antiviral stockpile needed to implement prophylaxis polices ( Figure SI15 ). As expected, this change increases the effectiveness of policies based on case identification (e.g. treatment, targeted prophylaxis), though the effect is only marked for the most intensive policy (socially targeted prophylaxis). We also examined the impact of additionally varying the proportion of infections which become clinical cases to 67% -which further increased policy effectiveness ( Figure SI15 ). Figure SI15 : Effect of varying assumptions about the infectiousness of cases versus non-cases. Results for an epidemic in the absence of interventions and for 4 intervention policies are shown. Same day treatment is assumed to be provided to 90% of cases on the same day symptoms start, while treatment coupled with prophylaxis is assumed to be given the day after symptoms start in the index case. Where applicable household prophylaxis is provided for all members of 90% of households of diagnosed cases the day after symptom onset in the case. School closure is assumed to be reactive, and to result in a school closing for 3 weeks after the first case is reported. Social prophylaxis is the prophylaxis of 90% of the school class mates or close work colleagues of 90% of cases, occurring the day after symptom onset in the case. Results are shown for three parameter sets: (i) the default of 50% of infections becoming cases, and non-cases being half as infectious as cases; (ii) 50% of infections becoming cases, and noncases being 25% as infectious as cases; (iii) 67% of infections becoming cases, and non-cases being 25% as infectious as cases.

This apparently paradoxical results arises because if one assumes symptomatic individuals reduce their contact rates more, then transmission from asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic individuals (who are assumed not to be detected) must increase to keep 0 R constant. Figure SI16 shows the effect of varying the number of cases that have to occur in the country before mitigation policies are started, excluding policies involving border controls or movement restrictions. Virtually no difference is seen between starting after 10 cases or 10,000 for either GB or the US (results are shown for the GB model).",

This was true for 90%, 99% and 99.9% reductions in importations of infections and for both the moderate and high transmissibility scenarios examined.

Within the range of kernel shapes shown in Figure SI4 , almost no difference could be observed ( Figure SI17 ). There were marginal differences in peak daily case incidence, which while not statistically significant appeared to suggest that the marginally fatter long-distance tail of the default US kernel favours slightly greater epidemic synchrony between different locations and therefore a slightly greater peak daily incidence. Control policies are equally largely unaffected by kernel choice in the range detailed by Figure SI4 : the largest effect is on internal movement restrictions, but even here kernel choice affects timing of the peak of a pandemic by more than a week or so. Figure SI17 : Effect of kernel shape on baseline US pandemic dynamics. Three kernels are compared: the default US kernel derived from STP64 census data (see Figure SI4b ), the default GB kernel (see Figure SI4a ), and a 'localised' version of the US kernel (see Figure SI4c ) (a) Epidemic curve for R 0 =2.0 for US when the epidemic. Averages of 10 realizations are shown. The vertical thickness of the curve represents twice the standard deviation seen between runs in the incidence at that time point. (b) As (a) but with showing average incidence only (for clarity without error bars or an envelope) on a log scale. Real time growth rate of the epidemics is seen to be independent of kernel choice. Figure SI18 shows the potential impact of applying the type of intensive transmission reduction policy proposed in previous work to contain a pandemic at source to limit spread in the UK. In principle such a policy is very effective: however, unlike containment at source, infection is constantly being reseeded in the country, resulting in very large stockpile requirements for the policy and immense logistical requirements in delivering the policy (for the high transmissibility scenario, over a 6 month period, every individual in the country would have been prophylaxed 5 times. Also, virus is never truly eliminated from the population -a national incidence of around 200 cases per day is maintained, even in the absence of reseeding. Figure SI18 : Application in GB of a 'containment at source' strategy of case treatment, household prophylaxis, school closure, prophylaxis of school classes and close work colleagues, blanket population prophylaxis of the nearest 20,000 people to each case, and a 75% reduction in travel in and out of affected zones of 5km around each case 6 . (a) Effectiveness of policy (as quantified by the cumulative clinical attack rates and antiviral stockpile required) assuming 1 infected individual enters the country per day. Results for R 0 =2.0 and R 0 =1.7 are shown. (b) as (a), but for realistic seeding (see Figure SI7 for profile of infections per day entering GB). Figure SI19 shows the potential impact of blanket reductions on travel over 50km (for the duration of a pandemic) on pandemic spread in the US, as a function of the extent of reduction achieved. All policies include 99.9% effective border controls, since within country reductions on travel have very limited impact in the absence of border restrictions, due to infection being widely seeded solely from external imports. The effect of internal restrictions is largely to spread the epidemic over a much longer time period. The peak of the epidemic is delayed little, but the magnitude of the peak is substantially reduced for reductions in travel over 50km of at least 90%. Internal travel restrictions have a very limited impact on overall attack rates (no more than a 2% reduction). The effectiveness of internal travel restrictions drops dramatically for less than 90% reductions -a 75% reduction gives results very similar to having no travel reductions at all (not shown). ",
