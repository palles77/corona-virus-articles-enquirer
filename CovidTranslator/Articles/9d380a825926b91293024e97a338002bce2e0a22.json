The TaqMan \u00ae Array Card (TAC, Life Technologies TM ), can simultaneously test 7 clinical specimens for up to 21 individual pathogens (depending on arrangement of controls and use of duplicate wells) by arrayed singleplex RT-qPCR on a single assay card, using minimal amounts of clinical specimens. A previous study described the development of TAC for the detection of respiratory viral and bacterial pathogens; the assay was evaluated against well-characterized analytical materials and a limited collection of human clinical specimens. Objectives: We wished to compare TAC assay performance against standard individual RT-qPCR assays for respiratory viral detection, focusing on 10 viruses (adenovirus, human metapneumovirus, human parainfluenza viruses 1-4, influenza viruses A and B, respiratory syncytial virus, and rhinovirus) from a larger collection of human specimens. Study design: We used specimens from 942 children with ARI enrolled systematically in a populationbased, ARI surveillance study (New Vaccine Surveillance Network, NVSN). Results: Compared with standard individual RT-qPCR assays, the sensitivity of TAC for the targeted viruses ranged from 54% to 95% (54%, 56%, and 75% for adenovirus, human parainfluenza viruses-1 and -2, respectively, and 82%-95% for the other viruses). Assay specificity was 99%, and coefficients of variation for virus controls ranged from 1.5% to 4.5%.",

Advantages of the TAC system included simple and easy operation; reproducible and simultaneous analyses of multiple pathogens using small sample volumes; a level of detection generally within one ten-fold dilution of individual RT-qPCR assays; a lower risk of amplicon contamination as the system is entirely closed; and unlike other multiplex platforms, the ability to modify or replace individual pathogen assay primer/probes without requiring the re-optimization and validation of the entire panel. 2 However, several gaps in knowledge remained after completion of that study. 2 First, the frozen, archived clinical specimens utilized were collected from various studies and locations over a 10 year period, preventing evaluation of standardized methods or establishing epidemiologic associations. Second, the total nucleic acid (TNA) extracts were diluted in order to provide sufficient volume to perform comparisons of TAC with individual RT-qPCR assays; this factor, along with the frozen storage, may have contributed to the decreased sensitivity of the TAC assay relative to the individual RT-qPCR assays. Third, in order to achieve a consensus in the amplification conditions for all deployed individual RT-qPCR and TAC assays, a higher probe-annealing temperature of 60 \u2022 C was chosen as required for optimal bacterial assay specificity, but with the potential loss in sensitivity of some viral assays designed to run at 55 \u2022 C. Loss of viral sensitivity might have biased the results toward increased concordance among falsely negative individual RT-qPCR assays and TAC assays, resulting in an overestimate of TAC sensitivity for viruses.",

Thirteen samples positive for HPIV-1 by individual RT-qPCR were available for further testing, and retested by TAC with annealing temperatures of 55 \u2022 C. An improvement in TAC assay HPIV-1 performance was obtained at the lower annealing temperature, with assay sensitivity increasing from 69% (9/13) to 100% (13/13). A comparison of the point estimates of sensitivity, as well as the number of true positive viruses tested (as defined by positive individual RT-qPCR results), from both the work of Kodani et al. 2 and the present work is presented in Table 3 (95% CI shown in Table 3 for the results of Kodani et al. 2 were recalculated by the same methods as those for the present results).",

TAC assays for all pathogens were accomplished with only 20 L of nucleic acid extract and 80 L of reaction mix per patient sample, with card setup and run times of \u223c3 h, excluding sample extraction; 3 cards (up to 21 samples) could be feasibly run on a single machine in a normal workday. In contrast, completing up to 21 individual RT-qPCR reactions for each clinical sample would require 125 L of nucleic acid extract and 420 L of reaction mix, as well as a much greater amount of technician time, precluding throughput of even 1 clinical specimen tested for all pathogens per day. Additional advantages of the TAC assay were a combined datafile output of all pathogens tested per specimen, such that merging of results of separate RT-qPCR assays was not required; and the avoidance of pipetting errors in the multi-well plate RT-qPCR assays by the automated setup of the TAC array assay. Indeed, excellent reproducibility of all controls was maintained throughout the duration of the study.",

Kodani et al., 2 found TAC sensitivity and specificity to be 95% and 98% in a smaller test set of 192 virus-positive specimens for 9 of the same target viruses (HPIV-4 not included). Our analysis yielded similar estimates of sensitivity and specificity for each virus assay, except for lower sensitivity for adenovirus, rhinovirus, and HPIV-1 ( Table 3) . Part of this discrepancy might be explained by the fact that Kodani et al., 2 used an annealing temperature of 60 \u2022 C for their individual RT-qPCR assays, which may have decreased the RT-qPCR sensitivity, thus making it more concordant with any negative TAC assay results (i.e., more false negative RT-qPCR results would have increased the concordance with false negative TAC results, raising the estimates of TAC sensitivity for adenoviruses and rhinoviruses). An additional factor may be greater strain variation in adenoviruses and rhinoviruses, reducing the performance of the TAC primers/probes for those viruses when analyzed at 60 \u2022 C rather than at 55 \u2022 C. We were not able to pursue studies of the effects of adenovirus and rhinovirus strain variation and annealing temperature on the TAC assay due to limited resources. We also noted decreased TAC assay sensitivity for HPIV-1. Since one of the advantages of the closed TAC system is the ability to modify or replace primer/probes for individual pathogens without requiring the re-optimization and validation of the entire panel, 2 we have updated the HPIV-1 primers for future TAC cards to improve assay sensitivity at 60 \u2022 C (Table 1) .",
