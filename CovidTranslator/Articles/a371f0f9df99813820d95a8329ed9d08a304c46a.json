Detection of AOM pathogens generally relies on bacterial culture of middle ear fluid. When viral culture is used and live viruses are detected in the middle ear fluid of children with AOM, the viruses are generally accepted as AOM pathogens. Because viral culture is not sensitive and does not detect the comprehensive spectrum of respiratory viruses, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays are commonly used to detect viral nucleic acids in the middle ear fluid. While PCR assays have greatly increased the viral detection rate, new questions arise on the significance of viral nucleic acids detected in the middle ear because nucleic acids of multiple viruses are detected simultaneously, and nucleic acids of specific viruses are detected repeatedly and in a high proportion of asymptomatic children. This article first reviews the role of live viruses in AOM and presents the point-counter point arguments on whether viral nucleic acids in the middle ear represent an AOM pathogen or a bystander status. While there is evidence to support both directions, helpful information for interpretation of the data and future research direction are outlined.",

In chinchillas, the incidence of experimental OM was higher in animals with combined bacterial and viral infection than those with either bacterial or viral infection alone (4) . Severity of OM was also greater in animals with combined infection than in those with bacterial or viral infection alone (5) . In children with AOM, bacteriologic failure 2-4 days into antibiotic therapy occurred in a significantly higher proportion of patients whose MEF contained both bacteria and virus, than in the group with bacteria alone (6) ; concurrent viral infection of the respiratory tract or the middle ear is associated with poor treatment outcomes (7) . These data were derived from studies using conventional viral diagnostics (culture and antigen detection). One explanation for poor AOM outcome associated with viral infection of the middle ear is virus-induced inflammation. In MEF from children with AOM, concentrations of interleukin-8, histamine and leukotriene B4, have been found to be higher in MEF containing both bacteria and virus, than in MEF containing bacteria or virus alone (8, 9) . Another explanation related to the ability of the viruses to induce local inflammation and immunologic reactions that interfere with penetration of antibiotic or dilute antibiotic concentration in the MEF; evidence to support these observations come from both data obtained in chinchilla experiments and in children with AOM (10, 11) .",

Importantly, viruses alone, without presence of bacteria can cause AOM, both in experimental animals and in infants and children. In a study in chinchillas (4), S. pneumoniae and/ or influenza A virus were inoculated into the animals intranasally. Bacteria alone induced AOM in 21% of animals, while both bacteria and virus induced AOM in 31%. Influenza A virus alone induced AOM in 4% of animals; the MEF was culture positive for influenza A. In another study involving chinchillas (2), intranasal inoculation of adenovirus type 1, in the absence of bacteria, caused mild to moderate tympanic membrane inflammation. Studies of infants and children with AOM for bacterial and viral etiology using conventional viral diagnostic methods have shown viruses in the MEF of 11-25% of cases. In 5-15% of these cases, only viruses (without bacteria) were detected in the MEF (12) . Detection of viruses in the MEF has not been performed routinely in AOM studies, mainly because of technical difficulties, costs, and unavailability of treatment for broad spectrum of respiratory viruses.",

When both conventional bacterial and viral diagnostics were used (e.g. bacterial and viral cultures, with or without viral antigen detection), bacteria alone were detected in the MEF of 55% of AOM cases; viruses and bacteria together in 15%; viruses alone in 5%; no pathogen was detected in 25% of cases (12) ( Figure 1A ). It is clear that conventional assays under-detect viruses and may also under-detect bacteria. Furthermore, conventional viral diagnostics can't detect specific respiratory viruses that commonly cause URI such as coronavirus, human metapneumovirus and bocavirus. Because respiratory viruses have been shown to play an important role in AOM pathogenesis and viruses alone can cause AOM, researchers have used more sensitive assays to detect viruses. Molecular diagnostics such as polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays have been used to detect viral nucleic acids in the MEF of children with AOM (14) (15) (16) (17) . In a study using comprehensive diagnostic methods including conventional and molecular testing for bacteria and broad spectrum of respiratory viruses, bacteria alone was detected in the MEF in 27% of cases, bacteria and viruses together in 66%, viruses alone in 4% (18) . The proportion of cases with no pathogen in the MEF was only 4%, a substantial difference from 25% reported previously ( Figure 1B ).",

The picornavirus infections in these girls were marked by PCR positivity for 1 to 3 weeks followed by PCR negative samples in subsequent weeks. In view of the fact that an episode of picornavirus infection occurred in healthy children in this study (33) once every two months, picornavirus RNA would be present in nasopharyngeal secretions for one to three weeks out of every eight to reach the middle ear during swallowing and yawning (see below).",

Air reaches the middle ear via the Eustachian tube which originates at an opening on the lateral wall of the nasopharynx at the level of the hard palate. In children the tube is shorter and more horizontal than in adults, and the pharyngeal orifice is slit-like. About one-third of the middle ear cavity and the entire Eustachian tube are lined with mucociliary epithelium so that particulate matter including bacteria can be transported back to the nasopharynx. The nasopharyngeal orifice of the Eustachian tube is normally closed. For equilibration of the air pressure in the middle ear with ambient pressure the Eustachian tube orifice is opened passively by action of the levator and tensor veli palatini muscles during swallowing and yawning. This allows air from the nasopharynx to pass through the tube to the middle ear. It has been thought that secretion from the nasopharynx does not reach the middle ear by passage through the tube when the tympanic membrane is intact due to the narrowness of the mid portion of the tube and the cushion of air in the middle ear.",

The type of virus nucleic acids detected is important; adenovirus, rhinovirus, enterovirus, and bocavirus nucleic acids are found repeatedly in respiratory secretions collected frequently from children while respiratory syncytial virus, influenza, and coronavirus are not (20) (21) (22) 33) . These data suggest either repeated infections or tendency for prolonged presence / persistence for some respiratory viruses but not all. Therefore, PCR data from previous and recent samples, when available, can be helpful. Detection of single virus as opposed to multiple in symptomatic children also suggests the importance of the finding. Quantitative PCR (viral load) has been use as a way to help indicate the significance of the detected viruses and there have been suggestions to use viral load cut off values to separate virus cause from persistence (27, 41) , but the issue is still controversial. While many studies reported overall positive correlation between viral load and symptom severity (21, (42) (43) (44) , others did not find significant relationship between the quantity of specific viruses and selected clinical outcomes (45) . Viral load and symptom correlation may depend on specific viral types or clinical diagnoses and there is still a need to determine the significance of viral load in URI and the risk for AOM development.",
