However, its epidemic patterns and co-infection characteristics are not fully understood. Objectives: We attempted to determine the level of genetic variation of RSV, and describe the prevalence and co-infection characteristics of RSV in Hangzhou during two epidemic seasons. Study design: Single respiratory samples from 1820 pediatric patients were screened for RSV and genotyped by RT-PCR and sequencing. In all RSV positive specimens, we screened for viruses and atypical bacteria. Demographic and clinical information was recorded and analyzed. Results: A total of 34.5% and 3.8% of samples from acute lower respiratory tract infections (ALRI) and influenza-like illness (ILI) were positive for RSV, respectively. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that 61.1% of the selected 167 RSV strains were NA1, 31.1% were BA, 3.6% were ON1, 2.4% were CB1, and 1.8% were NA3. A new genotype, BA11 was identified, which comprised 98.1% of BA strains in this study, while the rest were BA10. A total of 36.4% and 9.1% of RSV-positive children with ALRI and ILI respectively were found to be co-infected. Rhinovirus was the most common additional respiratory virus, followed by human metapneumovirus. Except for fever, no significant differences in other clinical presentation between the RSV mono-infection and co-infection groups were observed. Conclusions: The circulating RSV strains had high genetic variability with RSV-B showing a more local pattern. In ALRI cases, co-infection of RSV with other viruses or atypical bacteria has no significant effect on the clinical presentation except fever.",

            "text": "Human respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the most important viral agent of acute respiratory infections in infants, young children and immunocompromised and elderly individuals [1, 2] . RSV can be rapidly transmitted within childcare institutions [3] . Infection with RSV can result in mild to severe illness, including lower respiratory syndromes such as bronchiolitis and pneumonia. It has been estimated that nearly all two-year-old children have been infected [4] . The attachment G glycoprotein (G protein), a type II glycoprotein, is the most variable region both within and between the major RSV genotypes [5] . The G protein contains 2 hypervariable regions (HVR), with the second HVR (HVR2), located at the C-terminal end, which is widely used to study the genetic diversity of RSV [6, 7] . To date, 13 RSV-A genotypes, GA1-GA7 [8, 9] , SAA1 [10] , NA1-NA4 [11, 12] , and ON1 [13] , and 22 RSV-B genotypes, GB1-GB4 [8] , BA1-BA6 [14] , BA7-BA10 [15] , SAB1-SAB3 [10] , SAB4 [16] , URU1-URU2 [17] , CB1, and BA-C [12] have been identified based on sequence analyses of HVR2. The frequent appearance of new genotypes may facilitate RSV evasion of existing herd immunity, further influencing disease severity, causing repeated infections and even larger outbreaks [11, 18] .",

It is interesting to point out that ON1 genotype strains appear to have emerged during the same period. The precise geographic distribution of ON1 genotype still awaits further elucidation. By early 2013, ON1 strains had spread so efficiently that they had nearly replaced other RSV-A strains in Italy [35] . In Hangzhou, we have only collected the samples from January to March in 2013.

Similar patterns were observed in Kilifi, Kenya [39] , the 27 novel Kilifi RSV genomes (11 RSVA and 16 RSVB) were used to assess local versus global RSV variety. Kilifi RSV strains are similar to strains that circulate in other regions of the world and reveal only limited local evolution. Phylogenetic clustering appeared to be more influenced by time of virus sample collection than by geographical location. Also, Agoti CN et al. [39] indicated that RSVB variants may spread less efficiently, with a higher variation, which is specific for local. Our study clarified this phenomenon, it may have strong consequences on the efficacy of any RSV vaccine used locally.",

These results demonstrate that subgroup B viruses display more mechanisms of variation in the G gene than subgroup A viruses. Similar amino acid homologies were also observed by Zhang and colleagues [31] . The variation was greatest among the four CB1 strains where three different lengths of the protein G were found (80aa, 83aa and 86aa). This prompts further RSV monitoring, particularly of CB1 genotype.",
