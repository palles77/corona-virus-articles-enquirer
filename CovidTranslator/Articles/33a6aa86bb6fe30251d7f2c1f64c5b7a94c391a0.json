It is important to gain a clear picture of risk factors associated with this new viral respiratory infection in order to allocate appropriate medical resources to prevent the development of severe or critical forms of COVID-19 in those considered to be at higher risk. Here, we consider the possibility that infection with Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the pathogen that causes tuberculosis (TB), the top cause of death due to an infectious disease, may predispose to SARS-CoV infection and the more rapid development of symptoms and severe COVID-19 pneumonia.

We first assigned cases into two groups based on the severity of their COVID-19 pneumonia according to the Diagnostic and Treatment Guidelines of the National Health Commission of China (v6) 9 . Twenty-seven cases were mild/moderate (75%, Group 1) and nine cases were severe/critical (25%, Group 2) ( Table 2) . We then determined the MTB infection status of each patient by examining their clinical history and by performing X.DOT-TB IGRA assays (Table 1) To determine if MTB infection is a risk factor specific for COVID-19 pneumonia, or for pneumonia in general, we compared the MTB infection rate within these COVID-19 cases with data from a case-series comprised of 115 bacterial pneumonia and 62 viral pneumonia patients obtained from another study conducted in Shenyang (unpublished) ( Figure 1A ); MTB infection rates were considerably higher among COVID-19 patients than among bacterial pneumonia patients (36.11% vs 20%; p = 0.047 Figure 1A ) and viral pneumonia patients (36.11% vs 16.13%; p = 0.024),",

Seven of the 9 severe/critical cases were IGRA+ve indicating MTB co-infection, and of these, 4 of the 5 cases that developed ARDS were IGRA+ve. By comparison, 21 of 27 cases (78%) in Group 1 (mild/moderate cases) were IGRA-ve and had no history of TB disease. This data infers that coinfection of SARS-CoV-2 with MTB tends to lead to the development of more severe or critical COVID-19 symptoms.",

First, the medical and wider community should be informed that latent/active TB is a risk factor for SARS-CoV-2 infection, and those at risk should be encouraged to pay special attention to preventive measures. Ideally, this vulnerable group should be monitored regularly at community-based medical centers in situations when resources are available. Second, the MTB infection status (history and IGRA response) of suspected/confirmed COVID-19 cases should be checked routinely on admission to ensure coinfected cases are placed in appropriate isolation wards if active TB is detected. Third, special medical resources (such as ECMO therapy) should be arranged in advance for coinfected patients in view of the increased likelihood of rapid development of severe or critical symptoms. Fourth, therapeutic approaches for cases known to be coinfected both SARS-CoV-2 and MTB should bear their MTB infection history in mind; for example, treatments involving immunosuppressive agents should be reconsidered, as they hold the potential to reactivate latent TB infections. .
