            "text": "Several mouse models of multiple sclerosis (MS) are now available. We have established a mouse model, in which ocular infection with a recombinant HSV-1 that expresses murine IL-2 constitutively (HSV-IL-2) causes CNS demyelination in different strains of mice. This model differs from most other models in that it represents a mixture of viral and immune triggers. In the present study, we directly compared MOG 35-55 , MBP [35] [36] [37] [38] [39] [40] [41] [42] [43] [44] [45] [46] [47] models of EAE with our HSV-IL-2-induced MS model. Mice with HSV-IL-2-induced and MOG-induced demyelinating diseases demonstrated a similar pattern and distribution of demyelination in their brain, spinal cord, and optic nerves. In contrast, no demyelination was detected in the optic nerves of MBP-and PLP-injected mice. IFN-\u03b2 injections significantly reduced demyelination in brains of all groups, in the spinal cords of the MOG and MBP groups, and completely blocked it in the spinal cords of the PLP and HSV-IL-2 groups as well as in optic nerves of MOG and HSV-IL-2 groups. In contrast to IFN-\u03b2 treatment, IL-12p70 protected the HSV-IL-2 group from demyelination, while IL-4 was not effective at all in preventing demyelination. MOG-injected mice showed clinical signs of paralysis and disease-related mortality whereas mice in the other treatment groups did not. Collectively, the results indicate that the HSV-IL-2 model and the MOG model complement each other and, together, provide unique insights into the heterogeneity of human MS.",

In severe cases, MS can render a person unable to write, speak, or walk with most MS patients experiencing muscle weakness in their extremities and difficulty with coordination and balance 1 . The course of the disease differs among affected individuals with some exhibiting relapsing-remitting disease and some progressive disease. Like other presumed autoimmune diseases, MS is more common in females and clinical symptoms are often first manifested during young adulthood 1, 2 . The disease is characterized by the development of lesions in the central nervous system (CNS) that have an inflammatory component and frequently, but not always, by demyelination. The location of the lesions within the CNS differs amongst affected individuals and can occur in several different locations in any one individual. Epidemiologic studies of MS have implicated environmental as well as genetic factors in the disease process. Evidence has accumulated that infectious agents, particularly viral, may be involved 3, 4 ; however, this remains controversial [5] [6] [7] . If an infectious agent is involved, it alone may not be sufficient to initiate the observed pathology.",

We found that infection with HSV-1 did not cause demyelination in mice; however when we combined HSV-1 infection with administration of IL-2, an MS-like pathology (CNS inflammatory demyelination) was observed in the infected mice. This inflammatory demyelination occurred when IL-2 was delivered using a viral vector (HSV-IL-2) [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] or when mice were injected with IL-2 and then infected with wild-type (WT) HSV-1 26 . Ocular infection of different strains of mice with HSV-IL-2 induces CNS demyelination in the periventricular white matter, brain stem, stem cell (SC) white matter and optic nerves (ON) of infected mice, whereas WT HSV-1 or recombinant viruses expressing IL-4, IFN-\u03b3, IL-12p35, IL-12p40, or IL-12p70 do not induce this demyelinating neuropathy 21, [23] [24] [25] . Similar results are obtained upon delivery of IL-2 into the mouse brain using osmotic mini-pumps or injection of mice with rIL-2 protein, IL-2 DNA, or IL-2 synthetic peptides prior to infection with WT HSV-1 strains McKrae and KOS 26 . Notably, a single mutation at position T27A in the IL-2 open-reading frame completely blocked CNS demyelination in this model 26 . Thus, the HSV-IL-2 model of CNS demyelination offers a novel alternative experimental animal model for MS that incorporates both a viral and an immune component [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] .",

Effective use of the model depends, however, on a thorough understanding of the similarities and differences among the models, especially in terms of the parameters that are most likely to relate to the human disease. Therefore, in this study we compared the HSV-IL-2 model of CNS demyelination with the MOG , MBP [35] [36] [37] [38] [39] [40] [41] [42] [43] [44] [45] [46] [47] models of EAE using standardized protocols and female C57BL/6 mice of the same age. We also compared the effects of controlling CNS demyelination by delivery of interferon-\u03b2 (IFN-\u03b2), IL-4 and IL-12p70 in the different models. The results of this simultaneous comparison of different models of CNS demyelination provides insight into their possible relevance to each other and, ultimately, to MS.",

Our results (Figures 1 and 2) suggested that there is greater demyelination in the brains and ONs of the mice in the MOG and HSV-IL-2 treatment groups than those in the PLP and MBP groups. To determine if the extent of demyelination correlated with the level of inflammation, we stained sections from the brains, SCs and ONs with H&E ( Figure  S1 ) and estimated the severity of inflammation as described in Materials and Methods. The data are shown as the inflammatory score per total stained sections in Figure 3 . The inflammatory scores for the sections of brain and SC from mice in the MOG and HSV-IL-2 treatment groups were similar to those of mice in the PLP and MBP groups (Fig. 3) . In contrast, the inflammatory score for ONs of the mice in the MOG treatment group was significantly higher than the scores for mice in the PLP, MBP or HSV-IL-2 groups (Fig. 3) . The inflammatory responses in the ONs of the MOG treatment group correlated with the severity of demyelination (Fig. 2, ON) . This was an exception, however, and overall, the inflammatory responses did not correlate with the severity of demyelination. (Fig. 4A ). The number of CD11b + cells was high in brains of all all treatment groups, including the mock-treated control group (Fig. 4B, p>0 .05). A higher number of CD11b + cells was also found in the SCs of the mock-treated control group as compared to all the other groups, while the number of CD11b + cells was lower in the HSV-IL-2 treatment group than in any of the other treatment groups (Fig. 4B, p=0 .05). The lower amounts of CD11b + cells in SC of HSV-IL-2 infected mice suggest that HSV-IL-2 infection suppresses CD11b + cells in this tissue. There were no significant differences in the number of CD11c + cells among the groups except that the number of CD11c + cells were significantly higher in the SCs of the mice in the MOG group (Fig. 4C) . Overall, the number of CD11b + cells was higher (Fig. 4B ) as compared to CD3 (Fig. 4A ) or CD11c + (Fig. 4C ) in the brains of all treatment groups, including the mock-treated control group. B cell infiltrates were not detected in the brains or SCs of mice in any of the treatment groups (not shown).",

Early pathological changes in the lumbar spinal cord tissue have been described in a mouse MS model and occurred in the presence or absence of overt clinical symptoms 34 . The mice were monitored and scored daily for signs of paralysis for 29 days or until death (if earlier than day 29), using the scoring system described in Material and Methods. The mean day of onset, mean and maximum clinical score, incidence of symptoms and mortality were calculated. Greater than 60% of mice in the MOG treatment group showed signs of muscular weakness (Table  1 ). Among the mice in the MOG group, the first sign of paralysis (usually tail hypotonia or atonia) appeared on day 11 post-MOG injection and different degrees of hind limb paralysis were observed among these mice until day 29-post injection (the final experimental time point). In contrast, no signs of paralysis were observed in the mice in the MBP (Table 2) , PLP (Table 3) or HSV-IL-2 (Table 4 ) treatment groups within the time-frame of this experiment.",

We therefore explored the ability of IFN-\u03b2 to block or reduce CNS demyelination in the different mouse models. The mice were injected 3X with IFN-\u03b2 DNA or vector DNA as described in Materials and Methods and demyelination in the brains, SCs and ONs was measured on day 29 post-treatment. Representative photomicrographs of the LFB-stained sections are shown in Figure 5A and the data are summarized in Tables 1-4 . Injection with IFN-\u03b2 DNA reduced demyelination in both the brains and SCs of mice in the MOG group by 50% and completely blocked the demyelination in the ONs ( Figure 5A , Table 1 ). Moreover, the intramuscular injections of IFN-\u03b2 DNA delayed the onset of clinical disease, reduced the severity of clinical symptoms and eliminated mortality in this group of mice ( Table 1 ). The injection of IFN-\u03b2 DNA also reduced the levels of demyelination in both the brains and SCs of mice in the MBP group (Fig. 5A , Table 2 ). The injection with IFN-\u03b2 DNA resulted in a reduction in demyelination in the brains of mice in the PLP group and demyelination of the SCs was significantly lower than in the vector-treated controls (Fig. 5A , Table 3 ). Finally, in the HSV-IL-2 group injected with IFN-\u03b2, brain demyelination was reduced by more than 90% and SCs and ONs demyelination was blocked completely as compared with the group injected with vector DNA alone (Fig. 5A , Table 4 ). Overall, IFN-\u03b2 was effective in reducing or blocking CNS demyelination in all groups but it was most effective in the HSV-IL-2 group followed by the PLP, MBP, and MOG groups. In addition, IFN-\u03b2 injection of all groups was less efficacious in reducing demyelination in brains of treated mice than in their SCs or ONs. This reduced efficacy is possibly associated with the brain being an immunological privileged site, while SC and ON are not. Thus, the blood-brain barrier may reduce the entrance of IFN-\u03b2 antigen into the brain but not SC and ON and this may contribute to lower protection from demyelination in all groups.",

            "text": "Previously, we reported that ocular infection of mice with a recombinant HSV-1 expressing IL-12p70 (HSV-IL-12p70) or injection of mice with IL-12p70 DNA completely blocks CNS demyelination in HSV-IL-2-infected mice 25 . It has been reported that IL-12p70 is a critical cytokine in the pathogenesis of EAE 35 and subsequently it was shown that the IL-12p40 component of IL-12p70 is involved in EAE-induced CNS pathology 36, 37 . Agents that block the common IL-12p70 and IL-23 p40 chain have now been entered into clinical trials 38 . Therefore, we evaluated the effects of HSV-IL-12p70 on CNS demyelination in the various models. Mice were injected with MOG, MBP, or PLP as described in figure 1 above. Injected mice were infected ocularly with 2X10 7 PFU/eye of HSV-IL12p70 and control mice were co-infected with HSV-IL-2 plus HSV-IL12p70 viruses. The clinical signs of disease were monitored from day 1 to day 29 post treatment. At day 29 post ocular infection, the mice were sacrificed and the brains, SCs and ONs were stained with LFB. The results are summarized in Tables 1 to 4 and representative photomicrographs of the LFB-stained sections are shown in Figure 5B . As expected, infection with HSV-IL-12p70 resulted in the inhibition of CNS demyelination in the HSV-IL-2 model (Fig. 5B , Table 4 ). Infection with HSV-IL-12p70 did not result in inhibition of CNS demyelination in the MOG (Fig. 5B , Table 1 ), MBP (Fig. 5B, Table 2 ), or PLP (Fig. 5B , Table 3 ) models. Indeed, in marked contrast to the protective effect of HSV-IL-12p70 in blocking CNS demyelination in the HSV-IL-2 model, infection with the HSV-IL-12p70 virus exacerbated the level of demyelination and the severity of paralysis and increased mortality in the MOG model (Table 1) . However, infection with HSV-IL-12p70 virus did not increase severity of demyelination in the MBP ( Table 2 ) and PLP (Table 3 ) models. Thus, our results suggest that while IL-12p70 is protective in the HSV-IL-2 model, it promotes demyelination and exacerbates the clinical symptoms in the MOG model.",

            "text": "The availability of animal models is very helpful, if not critical, for understanding the pathogenesis of MS and ultimately developing methods to control the disease. We recently have described a mixed model of MS that uses both a viral and an immune component to induce CNS demyelination [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] . In this model, constitutive expression of murine IL-2 by a recombinant HSV-1 (HSV-IL-2) causes CNS demyelination in different strains of mice. EAE is the primary experimental animal model for the study of MS with significant variation on the type of disease models 8, 42 . Thus, we initiated this study to answer the following questions: (1) what are the similarities/differences between HSV-IL-2 model and the EAE models? (2) What are the similarities/differences among the entire group of models? And (3) do these models represent different types of MS? The results obtained through this comprehensive, comparative study revealed differences in clinically relevant parameters between the models. Demyelination was observed in the brains and SCs of all four models. Demyelination of the ON in the HSV-IL-2 model, as reported previously [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] was also detected in the MOG model. In contrast to the HSV-IL-2 and MOG models, demyelination was not observed in the ON of MBP or PLP models. Inflammatory demyelination of ON, also called optic neuritis, is a common cause of visual and neurologic dysfunction in young adults diagnosed with MS [43] [44] [45] [46] [47] . Early manifestations of MS often involve degradation of visual acuity and color vision or visual field deficits that result in impaired vision or even blindness [43] [44] [45] [46] [47] . The results of the Optic Neuritis Treatment Trial, a critical longitudinal prospective cohort study, established a close relationship between optic neuritis and MS 48 . About 50-70% of patients with monosymptomatic optic neuritis have clinically silent MS-like lesions on MRI of the brain 43 . On longer follow-up, at least 50% of the monosymptomatic optic neuritis patients will be diagnosed as having MS [43] [44] [45] [46] [47] , and the 15-year risk of developing MS after one episode of optic neuritis is 50% based on clinical criteria alone 48 . Measurement of visual-evoked cortical potentials (VECPs) is widely used to assess patients suspected of having MS because of the high sensitivity of this technique and its ability to detect even clinically silent lesions of the visual pathway 49 . We have reported previously that mice ocularly infected with HSV-IL-2 showed a significant delay in terms of VECP responses as compared with mice infected with control viruses 23 . The results of this comparative study suggest that the HSV-IL-2 model and MOG model of CNS demyelination may be better models of this aspect of MS than the MBP or PLP model. Using knockout mice, depletion studies and transfer studies, we have established that both CD4 + and CD8 + T cells are involved in the HSV-IL-2-induced demyelination 24 . B cells, DCs, and NK cells do not play a role in the HSV-IL-2-induced demyelination 24 . Similarly, in the present study, we found elevation in the number of T cells but not B-cells in the brain and SC of HSV-IL-2 infected mice. These findings are consistent with the published data concerning histologic analyses of specimens obtained from patients with MS at autopsy, which have shown a possible correlation between the presence of T cells and the development of demyelinating lesions [50] [51] [52] . The results are also consistent with the reports that demyelination induced by mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) is associated with T cells 53 . In the EAE model of MS, T cells have been associated with CNS demyelination 50, 54 but macrophages also have been implicated in CNS pathology and MS 55, 56 although they may play only an indirect role. In the current study, we observed a suppression of CD11b + cells in the SC of the HSV-IL-2 group. Previously, we have shown that HSV-IL-2 infection of macrophages alters the balance of IL-12p35 and IL12p40 transcripts 24 and we also have reported that depletion of macrophages induces CNS demyelination following ocular infection of depleted mice with WT HSV-1 22 . The suppressive effect of HSV-IL-2 on the balance of IL-12p35 and IL12p40 transcripts were reversed by IL-12p70 22, 24, 25 . Similarly, in this study we showed that co-infection of mice with HSV-IL-2 and HSV-IL12p70 completely blocked CNS demyelination in infected mice. In contrast to the results obtained using the HSV-IL-2 model, infection of mice in the MOG treatment group with HSV-IL-12p70 exacerbated the disease outcome. Macrophages are the main source of IL-12 production 57, 58 and blocking the CNS demyelination in HSV-IL-2 infected mice by IL-12p70 is probably due to compensation for the suppressive effect of IL-2 on IL-12p70 formation. IL-12p70 was considered to be a critical cytokine in the pathogenesis of EAE 35 . However, later studies showed that although the IL-12p40 component of IL-12p70 is involved in EAE-induced CNS pathology, this effect is mediated by the binding of the IL-12p40 to IL-23p19 rather than its binding to IL-12p35 36, 37 . In the current study, in contrast to the suppression of macrophages observed in the HSV-IL-2-treated mice, we did not find an alteration in the number of macrophages in the MOG model. Thus, the exacerbation of disease in the MOG model following infection with HSV-IL-12p70 may be due to the imbalance of IL-12p40 and IL-12p35 and this could contribute to the development of the autoreactive T cells. Previously, we found that the CNS demyelination observed in HSV-IL-2-infected mice was exacerbated on co-infection with HSV-IFN-\u03b3 recombinant virus even though mice infected with HSV-IFN-\u03b3 recombinant virus alone do not develop CNS demyelination 25 .",

Recombinant IL-4 (rIL-4) has been shown to diminish demyelination and improve the clinical course of mice with EAE, apparently by influencing developing T cells to assume a protective role 40 . When fed to mice, retinoids, a group of chemicals that increase IL-4 and TGF-\u03b1, also improve the course of EAE 63 . In addition, it has been shown that CNS gene therapy with HSV-1 vectors expressing IL-4 protected rhesus monkeys 39 and mice 40, 41 from autoimmune encephalomyelitis. However, in this study a recombinant HSV-1 expressing murine IL-4 (HSV-IL-4) did not block CNS demyelination in the MOG model. Similarly, we reported previously that CNS demyelination was not blocked in mice co-infected with HSV-IL-2 and HSV-IL-4 25 . The discrepancy between the results of this study and previous studies could be due to the type of antigen, strain of mice, and dose of infection.",

In addition, it delayed the clinical sign of paralysis and the severity of paralysis in the MOG mice. In this study, we only detected paralysis in the MOG mice. We were not able to induce paralysis in the MBP or PLP mice even when a higher dose of peptides was used in the protocol. Similarly, the HSV-IL-2-treated mice showed no signs of paralysis as late as 29 days of follow-up even though they exhibited extensive CNS demyelination and inflammation. However, occasionally we have detected some paralysis in female BALB/c mice infected ocularly with HSV-IL-2 virus.",

Plaque-purified HSV-IL-2, HSV-IL-4, and HSV-IL-12p70 were grown in rabbit skin (RS) cell monolayers in minimal essential medium (MEM) containing 5% fetal calf serum (FCS) as we described previously [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] 65 . We have previously described the construction and characterization of HSV-IL-2 and HSV-IL-4 65, 66 . Briefly, the complete IL-2 or IL-4 gene, including its polyA site, was inserted into pLAT1.6 just downstream of the LAT promoter. pLAT-IL-2 or pLAT-IL-4 was co-transfected with infectious dLAT2903 DNA by the calcium phosphate method, and a single plaque containing the IL-2 or gene was plaque-purified as described 65, 66 . HSV-IL-2 or HSV-IL-4 therefore transcribes mouse IL-2 or IL-4 driven by the LAT promoter, respectively. We chose the LAT promoter since it is the only HSV-1 promoter that expresses high levels of transcripts both in response to primary infection and during periods of latency 67, 68 . Construction and characterization of HSV-IL-12p70 (also call M002), a \u03b3 1 34.5-deleted HSV that expresses both murine IL-12p35 and IL-12p40 in-frame as a heterodimer under the transcriptional control of the murine early-growth response-1 promoter (Egr-1), has been described previously 69 . In contrast to HSV-IL-2, ocular infection of mice with HSV-IL-4 or HSV-IL-12p70 does not cause CNS demyelination 24, 25 .",

Three main populations of common leukocyte antigen CD45-positive cells were identified in the brains and SCs based on expression of CD3(Fig. 4A), CD11b(Fig. 4B)and CD11c(Fig. 4C). Mice in the HSV-IL-2 treatment group had the highest number of T cells in the brain and SC as compared to mice in the other groups(Fig. 4A, p<0.05).
