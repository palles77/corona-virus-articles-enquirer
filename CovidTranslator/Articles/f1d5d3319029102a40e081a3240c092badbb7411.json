We found that the supernatants of human PBMCs stimulated by BW001 significantly protected Vero cells from SARS-CoV infection. BW001 could stimulate human PBMCs and pDCs to secrete high level of IFN-a and promote human PBMCs and B cells to proliferate. Furthermore, we demonstrated that BW001 could activate CD19 + B cells and CD56 + NK cells in human PBMCs. In addition, BW001 could enhance NK cytotoxicity and IFN-g secretion in human PBMCs. Together, BW001 represents a novel type of CpG ODN and may have potential for the development of treatment and prevention for SARS as well as other viral associated diseases. D",

Based on the functional characteristics, CpG ODNs are divided into three types: A-type CpG ODN is capable of activating human plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) to produce large amount of type I interferons (IFN-a/ h) and strongly activating natural killer cells (NK cells). B-type CpG ODN primarily activates B cells, resulting in their proliferation and antibody secretion. C-type CpG ODN shares the activities of both A-and B-type CpG ODN [3,8 -11] .",

Subcutaneous injection of CpG ODN in sheep induced a dosedependent increase in 2V5V-A synthetase, an anti-viral effector molecule, in serum of sheep [15] . Administration of CpG ODN through genital tract enhanced innate immunity and protected mice from herpes virus infection [16 -18] . Mice pretreated with CpG ODN before respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection produced a large amount of IFN-g in the lung that was associated with significantly reduced mucus secretion of the virus [19] . Treatment of Friend virus-infected mice with CpG ODN significantly reduced the virus burden in blood and enhanced virus-specific cellular immune responses [20] . Administration of CpG ODN to SAM-P1 mice (senescenceaccelerated model mice) induced a quick clearance of influenza virus and considerably improved the survival of the mice challenged with lethal dose of influenza virus [21] . Recently, treatment of hepatitis C patients with CpG ODN was reported to reduce hepatitis C virus (HCV) RNA in a phase I study, and the reduction was consistent with the elevation of IFN-a and other markers associated with an anti-viral immune response.",

We have selected a novel type of CpG ODN (BW001), which shows the most potent ability in anti-VSV activity in a bioassay. BW001 displays B-type CpG ODN structure feature at the 5V and A-type CpG ODN structure feature at the 3V. BW001 showed a potent activity in inhibiting the cytolytic effect of SARS-CoV to Vero E6 cells. We found that BW001 displays the functional activity of C-type CpG ODN because it induces human PBMCs and plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) to produce high level of IFN-a, stimulates human PBMCs and B cells to proliferate and activates CD19 + B cells and CD56 + NK cells.

In VSV protection assays, human PBMCs were stimulated with BW001 or control CpG ODNs, and the culture supernatants were tested for the ability to protect Vero E6 cells from VSV infection. As shown in Fig. 1A , BW001-stimulated supernatants protected Vero E6 cells from challenge by 10\u00c2 TCID50 of VSV. This level of protection was similar to that induced by 2216 ( P > 0.05) and significantly higher than that induced by 2006 ( P < 0.05). The anti-viral activity was due to the presence of the CG dinucleotide in the BW001 because BW002, which shared the same sequence as the BW001 except the order of the CG was reversed, did not induce the anti-VSV activity in the supernatant of cultured human PBMCs.",

Our results demonstrate that IFN-a in the supernatant of human PBMCs stimulated by BW001 is a major anti-SARS-CoV factor. BW001 displays the functional feature of C-type CpG ODN Because CpG ODN has been shown to induce human pDCs to produce type I interferons, including IFN-a/h, important anti-viral factors, we measured IFN-a secretion by human PBMCs and purified pDCs following BW001 stimulation. The result showed that BW001 could stimulate human PBMCs to secrete IFN-a. On average, the IFN-a level in BW001stimulated supernatants was about 200 pg/ml which was about 30% lower than that induced by 2216 (Fig. 3A, left) . Since pDCs are major cells for IFN-a production, we purified pDCs from human PBMCs and stimulated them with different CpG ODN (6 Ag/ml) for 36 h. The supernatants were detected for IFN-a production. The result showed that BW001 could stimulate human pDCs to produce high level of IFN-a (3280 pg/ml) that was approximately half of that (7726 pg/ml) induced by 2216 (Fig. 3A, right) .

Recombinant IFN-h was shown to exhibit the highest antiviral activity against SARS-CoV in vitro [27] . Pegylated IFN-a was shown to reduce viral replication and excretion in SARS-CoV infected macaques [28] . These findings suggest the possible applications of type I IFN to treat SARS patients. However, direct application of type I IFN has severe drawbacks. First, repeated application of recombinant IFN-a in humans induces antibody responses and results in loss of therapeutic efficacy. Second, there are at least 13 subtypes of IFN-a in humans. It is difficult to produce all of them for human use. In fact, natural IFN-a was found to have higher anti-viral activity against SARS-CoV in vitro than recombinant IFN-a [27] , probably due to the presence of multiple subtypes of IFN-a following natural induction. To overcome this difficult, one possibility is to use CpG ODNs to induce the production of IFN by endogenous cells. We show that BW001 induces human PBMCs and pDCs to secrete large amount of IFN-a. Indeed, at least eight subtypes of IFN-a are produced following BW001 stimulation of human PBMCs (data not shown). Consistently, BW001-stimulated PBMCs supernatants exhibit potent anti-SARS-CoV activity.",

Activation of these cells is probably indirect because studies have shown that CpG ODN-induced type I IFN, cytokines and chemokines trigger a wide range of secondary effects, including NK cell activation [29] .

The data suggest that 2216 is also an optimal CpG ODN for inducing anti-SARS-CoV immunity. Comparatively, in light of application, BW001 with full phosphorothioated backbone may be more resistant to the nuclease digestion than 2216 whose backbone is partial phosphorothioated.
