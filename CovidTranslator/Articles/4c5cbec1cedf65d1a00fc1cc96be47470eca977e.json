Here, we describe structure\u2212activity relationship (SAR) efforts that resulted in the optimization of novel chlorcyclizine derivatives as anti-HCV agents. Several compounds exhibited EC 50 values below 10 nM against HCV infection, cytotoxicity selectivity indices above 2000, and showed improved in vivo pharmacokinetic properties. The optimized molecules can serve as lead preclinical candidates for the treatment of hepatitis C virus infection and as probes to study hepatitis C virus pathogenesis and host\u2212virus interaction.",

            "text": "Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is an enveloped positive-stranded RNA virus of the Flaviviridae family. The HCV replication cycle is initiated by virions entering the host cell via interaction with cell surface receptors. Following pH-dependent fusion and uncoating, the HCV RNA genome is translated. The resulting polyprotein undergoes proteolytic cleavage into structural (core, E1, and E2) and nonstructural (p7, NS2, NS3, NS4A, NS4B, NS5A, and NS5B) proteins. After RNA replication, HCV undergoes assembly, maturation, and secretion processes. 1, 2 HCV leads to acute and chronic inflammatory hepatic infections that often progress toward chronic liver diseases, including cirrhosis, with an elevated risk of developing hepatocellular carcinoma. There is no vaccine for HCV to date. 3 Besides there being around 180 million people chronically infected worldwide with HCV, the standard of care for many years has been limited to interferon \u03b1 (IFN-\u03b1) in combination with ribavirin (RBV). 4, 5 This combination therapy is partially effective with serious adverse effects. Drug discovery efforts during the past 20 years led to a new paradigm for HCV treatment, which is marked by the recent approval of multiple direct-acting antivirals (DAAs) for interferon-free regimens. 2, 6, 7 The DAAs inhibit certain replication steps in the HCV replication cycle by directly targeting viral proteins, such as NS3/4A proteases, NS5A or NS5B polymerase. 8 Viral rebounds were often observed during monotherapy of these DAAs due to the selection of drug-resistant viral mutants. Thus, the clinical application of DAAs is mostly limited to combination regimens, which face challenges including additional side effects, complex administration, and drug\u2212drug interactions. 2 Sofosbuvir, 9 a DAA that has been approved for interferon-free regimen, costs more than $80,000 during a typical 12-week course of treatment alone, raising concerns about the affordability of DAAs in order to globally impact the burden of HCV disease. 10, 11 Host-targeting agents (HTAs), however, inhibit host factors that are essential in the viral replication cycle. Promising host-factor targets of HTAs include entry factors, components of viral replication complex cyclophilin A, and miR122 that bind to viral RNA to facilitate replication. 1 There is a higher genetic barrier to develop resistance to HTAs. 12 Moreover, HTAs can also be used as chemical probes to elucidate anti-HCV mechanisms and host\u2212 virus interactions. However, few HTA candidates are in the anti-HCV drug discovery pipeline, possibly due to the nature of primary drug screen assays that were mostly based on certain viral proteins or HCV replicons. Overall, there is still need to improve the current therapeutic regimens by exploring novel anti-HCV targets and small molecules.",

Here, we present a SAR study aiming to optimize CCZ (Rac-2) for an anti-HCV application focusing on the following features: generation of a nonchiral lead, improvement of its anti-HCV potency, modulation of its physicochemical properties to potentially reduce CNS exposure, reduction or elimination of its antihistamine activity, and improvement of pharmacokinetic properties. The resulting lead compounds in this series, represented by nonchiral compound 30, exhibited increased anti-HCV activity and selectivity (up to 19-fold and 8-fold, respectively) and improved in vivo pharmacokinetics properties. The optimized lead compounds merit further preclinical development for the treatment of hepatitis C.",

When the number of carbons was less than 4, analogues showed comparable activity in the range of low double-digit nanomolar and comparable selectivity to CCZ (Rac-2), regardless of whether the chain was linear or branched. Chains with a carbon number of 4 led to decreased activity as shown for compounds 12 and 13. Surprisingly, compound 16, having a cyclopentyl ring exhibited improved activity (EC 50 = 19 nM), while compound 17, having a cyclohexyl ring, showed an activity in the expected range (EC 50 = 177 nM), comparable to that of compounds 12 and 13. Additionally, acetylation of the piperazine ring dramatically reduced the potency of analogue 19 to a double-digit micromolar value. Introduction of a bulky substituted benzyl group also reduced the anti-HCV activity (compound 14, EC 50 = 456 nM). Deuterium, introduced in the side chain of compounds 20 and 15 with the aim of increasing their metabolic t 1/2 , did not impact their anti-HCV activity and indeed led to a slightly improved t 1/2 value (2.9 h for (R)-15 in comparison with 2.2 h for (R)-10 in the rat microsomal stability assay).

The lead compounds exhibited potent inhibition in the HCV single-cycle assay, in which singleround infectious HCV (HCVsc) can infect hepatocytes but does not assemble into new virions (Table 4 ). 13, 14 The activity suggested that the CCZ analogues inhibited early steps of the HCV replication cycle prior to assembly. The analogues were tested in the HCV pseudoparticle (HCVpp) assay and the HCV subgenomic replicon assay, 13 which detect whether the compounds target HCVpp entry and HCV replication, respectively. The HCVpp assay applies defective retroviral particles that harbor the HCV envelope glycoproteins to assess viral entry inhibition. 13,22\u221224 No significant inhibitory effect was observed in the HCVpp (genotype 1a and 1b) assay with the lead compounds, except for Rac-23 possibly due to cytotoxicity (Table 4) . To address viral specificity in the entry process, a vesicular stomatitis virus G pseudoparticle (VSV-Gpp) and a murine leukemia virus pseudoparticle (MLVpp) were tested as the control, in which no inhibitory effect was detected (Table  4 ). It is worth noting that the lack of HCVpp inhibition of a compound does not necessarily exclude virus entry as a mode of action. A compound could be targeting an entry step that is not otherwise captured by the HCVpp system. Multiple HCV entry inhibitors were reported without HCVpp inhibitory effect, including NPC1L1 antagonist ezetimibe and human apolipoprotein E peptides. 25, 26 In the genotype 2a HCV replicon cell line, all the lead compounds failed to reduce below 60% the replicon activity, as compared to the DMSO control, Table 3 .

In this sense, in our previous study, we disclosed the in vitro and in vivo anti-HCV properties of chlorcyclizine (CCZ, Rac-2), a first generation antihistamine compound approved for over-the-counter use. 14 Its affordability and established clinical safety profile make CCZ (Rac-2) an attractive candidate for repurposing toward chronic HCV infection (https:// clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02118012). Additionally, we decided to carry out structural modifications, in vitro and in vivo studies to further optimize this series with the aim of improving their anti-HCV profile. We focused the chemical modifications on four major structural motifs: chirality, side chains off the piperazine ring, substituents on the phenyl rings, and modifications on the piperazine core. As summarized in Figure 3 , chirality had little effect on the antiviral activity and selectivity. Dual para-chloro substitution on the aromatic rings led to more potent nonchiral analogues. Furthermore, the introduction of an oligoethylene glycol off the piperazine ring nitrogen improved the activity without compromising the selectivity. Most of the structure modifications in the piperazine core were not tolerated, suggesting that its geometry and its pK a value were important for the anti-HCV activity of the series. Selected lead compounds were also analyzed for additional assessment of cytotoxicity in HepG2 hepatocytes and primary human hepatocytes. They showed profiles similar to those observed in Huh7.5.1 cells, suggesting that the cytotoxicity evaluation in Huh7.5.1 cells in parallel with the HCV infection assay provides a good estimation of the cytotoxicity in human hepatocytes. Overall, the lead compounds in Table 4 exhibited excellent antiviral activity and selectivity in host cells (SI = 8608\u2212201). One of the goals of this medicinal chemistry study was to eliminate the antihistamine side effect of CCZ (Rac-2), which was achieved with lead compounds having R 3 = H or long ethylene glycol chains (compounds 29 and Rac-25).",

All air or moisture sensitive reactions were performed under positive pressure of nitrogen with oven-dried glassware. Anhydrous solvents such as dichloromethane, N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF), acetonitrile, methanol, and triethylamine were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO). Preparative purification was performed on a Waters semipreparative HPLC system (Waters Corp., Milford, MA). The column used was a Phenomenex Luna C 18 (5 \u03bcm, 30 \u00d7 75 mm; Phenomenex, Inc., Torrance, CA) at a flow rate of 45.0 mL/min. The mobile phase consisted of acetonitrile and water (each containing 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid). A gradient of 10% to 50% acetonitrile over 8 min was used during the purification. Fraction collection was triggered by UV detection at 220 nM. Analytical analysis was performed on an Agilent LC/MS (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA). Method 1: A 7 min gradient of 4% to 100% acetonitrile (containing 0.025% trifluoroacetic acid) in water (containing 0.05% trifluoroacetic acid) was used with an 8 min run time at a flow rate of 1.0 mL/min. Method 2: A 3 min gradient of 4% to 100% acetonitrile (containing 0.025% trifluoroacetic acid) in water (containing 0.05% trifluoroacetic acid) was used with a 4.5 min run time at a flow rate of 1.0 mL/min. A Phenomenex Luna C 18 column (3 \u03bcm, 3 \u00d7 75 mm) was used at a temperature of 50\u00b0C. Purity determination was performed using an Agilent diode array detector for both Method 1 and Method 2. Mass determination was performed using an Agilent 6130 mass spectrometer with electrospray ionization in the positive mode. 1 H NMR spectra were recorded on Varian 400 MHz spectrometers (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA). Chemical shifts are reported in ppm with undeuterated solvent (DMSO at 2.49 ppm) as internal standard for DMSO-d 6 solutions. All of the analogues tested in the biological assays have a purity of greater than 95% based on both analytical methods. Bis(4-chlorophenyl)methanol. A solution of 27 (3.00 g, 11.9 mmol) in MeOH (15.0 mL) was treated at 0\u00b0C in portions with NaBH 4 (0.678 g, 17.9 mmol). The reaction mixture was stirred at 0\u00b0C for 15 min, allowed to warm to room temperature, and stirred for 2 h. The reaction was quenched with ice, diluted with H 2 O, and extracted with EtOAc. The organic layer was separated, dried over MgSO 4 , and concentrated to give the title compound as a white solid (3.00 g, 99%), which was used without further purification. 1 4,4\u2032-(Chloromethylene)bis(chlorobenzene) (28) .
