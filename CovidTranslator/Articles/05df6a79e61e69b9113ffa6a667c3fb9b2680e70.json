            "text": "Toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9) triggering is a promising novel strategy to combat cancer as it induces innate and adaptive immunity responses. B-cell lymphoma is unique in this context as tumor cells express TLR9 and may harbor latent Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), a gamma-herpesvirus with remarkable oncogenic potential when latent. Latent EBV may be promoted by TLR9 triggering via suppression of lytic EBV. Here, we elaborated an initial assessment of the impact of TLR9 triggering on EBV-positive and EBV-negative B-cell lymphoma using Burkitt's lymphoma (BL) cell lines as an in vitro model. We show that, independent of the presence of EBV, the TLR9 ligand oligodeoxynucleotide (ODN) CpG-2006 may or may not induce caspase-dependent cell death in BL cells. Moreover, ODN CpG-2006-induced cell death responses of BL cells were associated with TLR9 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) rs5743836 or rs352140, which we detected in primary BL tumors and in peripheral blood from healthy individuals at similar frequencies. Thus, our findings suggest that the effect of TLR9 agonists on BL cells should be tested in vitro before installment of therapy and TLR9 SNPs in BL patients should be determined as potential biological markers for the therapeutic response to treatment targeting innate immunity.",

            "text": "Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are important players of the innate immune system, 1 and expression of the 10 TLRs known in humans 2,3 depends on the cell subset and differentiation status. [4] [5] [6] TLR9 is preferentially expressed by B cells and plasmacytoid dendritic cells (reviewed in reference Iwasaki and Medzhitov 1 ). Synthetic TLR9 ligands, short oligodeoxynucleotides (ODN) with unmethylated CpG motifs, 7 activate TLR9 that recruits the adapter protein myeloid differentiation factor 88 (MyD88) and induces a cascade leading to the nuclear translocation of the transcription factor nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-kB). 2 The immune response following TLR9 engagement is highly desirable for cancer treatment. 8 Synthetic TLR9 agonists are regarded as potential anti-cancer agents. Clinical trials have shown promising results for the treatment of various cancer types with CpG ODNs. 9 Their effects can be indirect by enhancing the anti-tumor immune response or direct by inducing apoptosis in the malignant cells. Direct effects would be expected for B-cell malignancies as they express TLR9. B-cell activation can eventually lead to activation-induced cell death of cancer cells and therefore support anti-cancer treatment. 10 Nevertheless, the TLR9 agonist effects vary strongly between B-cell cancer types, and the responses of B-cell lymphomas to ODN CpG-2006 show high variability. 11 Thus, the effects of CpG ODNs on B-cell malignancies are not predictable. Moreover, CpG ODN treatment has tumor-promoting effects on benign B cells and strongly enhances their proliferation and differentiation. [12] [13] [14] Stimulation of TLR9 with ODN CpG-2006 suppresses lytic reactivation of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), a B-cell tropic gamma-herpesvirus, and can thereby promote latent EBV. 15, 16 The latter is associated with several types of B-cell lymphomas including Burkitt's lymphoma (BL). 17 EBV is present in nearly all cases of the high-incidence form of BL ('endemic BL'), in up to 85% of the intermediate-incidence cases, and in 15% of the low-incidence cases ('sporadic' BL). Up to 40% of BL in human immunodeficiency virus carriers harbor EBV. 17 As latent EBV exhibits unique growth transformation potential on B cells in vitro 18 and TLR9 triggering enhances EBV-induced B-cell transformation 19 and promotes latent EBV in vitro, 15, 16 TLR9 stimulation in the treatment of EBV-positive BL could provoke detrimental rather than beneficial outcomes.",

Among upregulated genes, we were mainly interested in those involved in cytokine (human interleukin 10; hIL-10) and chemokine expression (CXCL10), B-cell activation (CD40), transcription (NF-kB) and apoptosis (FAS) as these genes are those that preferentially determine cell proliferation and survival (Supplementary Table 1) .

This increase was abolished by treatment with the caspase inhibitor z-VAD-FMK (Figure 3a ), indicating that TLR9 triggering resulted in increased caspase activity in Akata cells and that this activity was not increased if cells were concomitantly treated with a caspase inhibitor. These findings were corroborated using PI staining, which indicate that Akata cell death induced by treatment with ODNs can be abrogated by the caspase inhibitor z-VAD-FMK ( Figure 3b ); and by western blotting showing that PARP cleavage is increased by ODN treatment and can be reduced by the inhibitor (Figure 3c ).

ODN GpC-2006 binds to TLR9, but in contrast to CpG-2006 it does not lead to TLR9 signaling in HEK293 cells or to changes in the secondary structure of the ectodomain. 32 Therefore, we examined whether downstream signaling of TLR9 via MyD88 is involved in the induction of cell death. Indeed, experiments using Akata cells overexpressing a MyD88 dominant-negative mutant indicated that both ODNs induce cell death of BL cells in a MyD88-dependent manner. Others demonstrated that ODNs induce cell death independently of the CpG motif, of TLR9 33 or even of the whole-ODN sequence. 34 Another pathway that is triggered by CpG ODNs, but is TLR9-independent, was described in monocytes and involves the activation of the Src family kinases Lyn and Hck. 35 In our experiments, BL cell death induced by TLR9 triggering correlated with increased caspase activity and was caspase-dependent, thus most likely due to apoptosis.",

The role of TLR9 SNPs in BL is unknown. To start to investigate this we analyzed the frequencies of given SNPs in BL patients and healthy individuals and found them to be similar. A recent report suggests that the rs5743836 polymorphism, which was also detected here, confers an increased risk for non-Hodgkin lymphoma in people from Portugal and Italy but not from the United States. 20 The association of the C allele rs5743836 with lack of cell death upon TLR9 triggering observed here in the Mutu-I and BJAB BL cell lines is striking. It does not allow establishing a causal link, but justifies the hypothesis that the distinct cell death responses upon CpG ODN treatment in BL cells may be linked to TLR9 SNPs. Notably, the C allele of rs5743836 exhibits greater NF-kB-binding affinity because of an additional NF-kB transcriptional binding site that may lead to increased production of proinflammatory cytokines. 36 Hence, the presence of the C allele seems to result in enhanced NF-kB activation following TLR9 triggering. This may lead to protection of ODN CpG treatmentinduced apoptosis that can be observed in BL cells without the C allele.",

Akata cells or DN-MyD88 Akata cells were left untreated or treated with 0.5 mM ODN CpG-2006 or ODN GpC-2006 for 48 h. After 6, 24 and 48 h, 10 5 cells were harvested, washed with PBS and stained with PE-Cy5-conjugated mouse anti-human CD40 antibody or a PE-Cy5 mouse IgG1k isotype control and analyzed with a flow cytometer.

TLR9 triggering leads to cell cycle entry and proliferation of B chronic lymphatic leukemia cells.11,12,22 We analyzed the cell cycle of mock-treated or ODN CpG-2006-treated Akata cells after initiation of treatment by propidium iodide staining and flow cytometry. Most cells were in the S phase during the time frame of 48 h (SupplementaryFigure 1). Treatment with ODN CpG-2006 did not alter the cell cycle compared with mock treatment. Similar results were obtained with Akata31 cells (data not shown), an EBV-negative subclone of Akata cells.23 Thus, although TLR9 triggering by ODN CpG-2006 resulted in BLcell activation based on increased expression of certain genes, it did not seem to influence the cell cycle.ODN-induced cell death of BL Akata cells isMyD88dependent. Treatment with ODN GpC-2006 unexpectedly induced CD40 upregulation in Akata cells in a MyD88dependent manner similar to treatment with ODN CpG-2006. We determined whether treatment with distinct TLR9 ligands would similarly result in a MyD88-dependent effect on cell survival. Also, we explored whether a class A ODN, that displays low specificity for B cells, exerts similar effects on BL cells as class B ODNs that possess a high specificity for B cells. Therefore, we treated Akata cells or DN-MyD88 Akata cells with ODN CpG-2216 (type A), ODN CpG-2006 (type B) and ODN GpC-2006 (type B control), respectively, and analyzed the viability of the cells by Trypan Blue exclusion assay and PE-Annexin V/7-amino-actinomycin (7-AAD) staining. The Trypan Blue exclusion assay showed that treatment of Akata cells with ODN CpG-2006 or ODN GpC-2006 reduced the survival of cells within 48 h to below 50% of not treated cells and treatment with ODN CpG-2216 to almost 50% of not treated cells after 72 h (Figure 2a). By contrast, the survival of DN-MyD88 Akata cells was not, if at all, reduced by treatment with any of the three ODNs for 72 h (Figure 2a). These findings were corroborated by the Annexin V/7-AAD assay revealing that the viability of Akata cells was drastically affected by treatment with class B ODNs and to a lesser extent with class A ODN, contrasting DN-MyD88 Akata cells that were not affected by treatment with ODNs for 72 h (Figure 2b and quantification in Figure 2c). Thus, treatment of Akata cells with ODNs CpG-2006 and GpC-2006 triggers TLR9 signaling via MyD88 and results in cell death.",

Treatment with ODN CpG-2006 or ODN GpC-2006 strongly decreased the percentages of surviving Akata cells or Akata 31 cells between 24 and 72 h compared with untreated cells. Nevertheless, the effect on Akata 31 cells was less marked (Figure 4a). The percentages of apoptotic Akata 31 cells assessed by Annexin V/7-AAD staining after 72 h of treatment, however, were comparable to those of Akata cells (Figure 4b). Treatment with ODN CpG-2216, ODN CpG-2006 or ODN GpC-2006 resulted in similar respective decreases in viability of Akata cells versus Akata31 cells due to apoptosis. Treatment with class A ODN CpG-2216 exhibited almost no negative impact on cell survival compared with treatment with the class B ODNs CpG-2006 and GpC-2006 (Figure 4b). These results showed that EBV-negative Akata31 cells exhibited a higher level of spontaneous cell death by apoptosis compared with EBV-positive Akata cells and corroborated the lower effect of TLR9 triggering by class A ODN compared with triggering by class B ODNs. Moreover, the results suggested that the presence of EBV does not prevent EBV-positive Akata cells from TLR9 triggering-induced cell death compared with EBV-negative Akata31 cells. Next, we investigated whether our observations in EBV-positive versus EBV-negative BL cells hold true in BL cells other than Akata. To this end, we used EBV-positive BL cells Mutu-I and EBV-negative BL cells BJAB and Ramos. Treatment with ODN CpG-2006 or with ODN GpC-2006 did not affect Mutu-I cell or BJAB cell survival (Figure 4c) but it decreased Ramos cell survival between 48 and 72 h(Figure 4c). Thus, the survival of BL cells following TLR9 triggering considerably differs between distinct BL cells and does not seem to depend on the presence or absence of EBV.",

The concentration of rhIL-10 was based on the peak hIL-10 protein concentration induced by ODN CpG-2006 treatment in Akata cells.16 Additionally, ODN CpG-2006 treatment was reiterated at 48 h in a fraction of BL cells.As expected, treatment with ODN CpG-2006 for 72 h reduced the viability of Akata cells to o20% but did not reduce viability of DN-MyD88 Akata cells compared with no treatment(Figures 5a-c). Reiterated treatment with ODN CpG-2006 after 48 h did not further reduce viability of Akata cells compared with one-time treatment and did not reduce viability of DN-MyD88 Akata cells (Figure 5a-c). Treatment with rhIL-10 for 72 h also did not reduce viability of Akata cells or DN-MyD88 Akata cells compared with no treatment. Treatment with rhIL-10 did not counteract ODN CpG-2006 treatment-induced reduction of BL cell viability or further decreased their viability. DN-MyD88 Akata cells were not affected by any of the treatments (Figures 5a-c). Thus, maximal negative impact of ODN CpG-2006 on cell survival in Akata cells occurred after one treatment. Moreover, rhIL-10 did not change the number of viable Akata cells, or rescue Akata cells from ODN CpG-2006 treatment-induced cell death. This suggested that hIL-10 cannot counteract TLR9 triggering-induced cell activation resulting in death of Akata cells and is not responsible for their cell death. BL cells express distinct hIL-10 mRNA and hIL-10 levels following TLR9 triggering. The distinct survival of BL cells following TLR9 triggering with ODN CpG could be because of distinct magnitudes of ensuing cellular responses. The induction of hIL-10 following ODN CpG treatment can be regarded as a surrogate marker for the magnitude of cell activation mediated by TLR9 triggering. Thus, we assessed hIL-10 mRNA expression in BL cells treated with ODN CpG-2006 or ODN GpC-2006. All five BL cell lines tested expressed hIL-10 mRNA following treatment with ODN CpG-2006, the values peaking preferentially at 6 h post treatment (Figure 6a). Peak hIL-10 mRNA expression levels varied from 1.3 transcripts over HMBS in Ramos BL cells to 48 transcripts in Mutu-I BL cells. Treatment with ODN GpC-2006 also resulted in induction of hIL-10 mRNA expression but in lower levels, except in Akata cells. Similar variation of results was observed when analyzing hIL-10 protein levels",
