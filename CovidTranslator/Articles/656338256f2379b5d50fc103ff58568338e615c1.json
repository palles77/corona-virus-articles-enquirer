Here, the first geometry model of the conducting airways for rhesus monkeys is developed based upon CT images of the conducting airways of a 6-month-old male, rhesus monkey. An algorithm was developed for adding the alveolar region airways using published rhesus morphometric data. The resultant lung geometry model can be used in mechanistic particle or gaseous dosimetry models. Such dosimetry models require estimates of the upper respiratory tract volume of the animal and the functional residual capacity, as well as of the tidal volume and breathing frequency of the animal. The relationship of these variables to rhesus monkeys of differing body weights was established by synthesizing and modeling published data as well as modeling pulmonary function measurements on 121 rhesus control animals. Deposition patterns of particles up to 10 \u03bcm in size were examined for endotracheal and and up to 5 \u03bcm for spontaneous breathing in infant and young adult monkeys and compared to those for humans. Deposition fraction of respirable size particles was found to be higher in the conducting airways of infant and young adult rhesus monkeys compared to humans. Due to the filtering effect of the conducting airways, pulmonary deposition in rhesus monkeys was lower than that in humans. Future research areas are identified that would either allow replacing assumptions or improving the newly developed lung model.",

Exposure characteristics and ensuing biological endpoints can be characterized and used in the development of a risk assessment model to estimate dose-response functions and exposure levels that are unlikely to result in adverse effects in humans. The nature and severity of most biological end points are a function of the retained dose in the lung, which is often difficult to determine experimentally. Hence, to study the potential for human health effects, the exposure-dose-response characterization of inhaled gases, vapors, and aerosols established in nonhuman primates needs to be translated to predict biologically equivalent doses in humans. This translation involves the use of mathematical dosimetry models that allow the calculated doses in nonhuman primates to be extrapolated to estimate human lung doses and, thus, equivalent human exposure scenarios.",

Cynomolgus and rhesus macaques have been used in the study of severe acute respiratory syndrome (Haagmans & Osterhaus, 2006) . Indeed, macaques are the major nonhuman primate used in biomedical research and serve as models for more than 70 human infectious agents of diverse etiologies, including bacteria, viruses, fungi, parasites, and prions (Gardner & Luciw, 2008) . Nonhuman primate studies involving therapeutic drug research targeting subregions of the intrathoracic airways benefit from knowledge of particle deposition patterns in the lower respiratory tract (LRT) as a function of aerodynamic size.",

However, only a limited number of such studies can be conducted due to the high costs of developing inhalation exposure systems, monitoring and maintaining a stable aerosol over the duration of the exposure period, and evaluating all of the biological endpoints that may be involved in the mode of action of the compound. Even then, measurements will not encompass all desirable exposure scenarios and deposition/absorption ranges. Hence, available deposition measurement information is used in the construction of a dosimetry model in conjunction with mathematical expressions and differential equations that allow one to examine the deposition/absorption and removal of the material in the respiratory tract in a costand timeeffective manner.",

However, anatomically correct models of the respiratory system are currently limited to either discrete regions of the respiratory system or, if they include conducting airways of both the upper and lower respiratory tract, do not extend into the alveolar spaces that are important for many inhaled materials. To achieve the needed calculations, the process can be broken down into four independent steps. First, semi-empirical predictive models for the inhalability of airborne materials into and deposition/absorption in the upper respiratory tract (URT) are developed based on either laboratory measurements or computational fluid dynamics studies. Second, the LRT geometry is constructed from available, selected measurements of conducting and alveolated airways of the lung by assuming that each airway is shaped as a cylindrical tube. Third, a model for lung ventilation is developed based on airway resistance and lung compliance to allow distribution of inhaled materials throughout the LRT. Finally, an account of the fate of inhaled materials is accomplished by performing a mass balance on the inhaled materials in each airway of the LRT. Calculated airway losses are combined to obtain local and regional deposition fractions and deposited masses.",

The first was to develop a LRT geometry model for the lungs of rhesus monkeys using computed tomography (CT) images of the tracheobronchial (TB) airways to construct a conducting airway tree and synthesizing morphometric data from the literature to construct the alveolar region geometry. The second objective was to develop relationships between various physiologic variables and the body weight/age of rhesus monkeys to be able to specify values of input variables needed in deposition model calculations of inhaled particles and to scale the LRT geometry model to monkeys of different sizes. The final objective was to examine the deposition of particles in the lungs of rhesus monkeys and make comparisons to deposition patterns and values in humans. To accomplish these objectives, various tasks were undertaken, as described in the following sections. buffer (330 mosm, pH 7.4) at 25 cm H 2 O pressure overnight and then stored in fixative. Fixed lungs were placed in buffered saline prior to casting. Silicone RTV mixed with silicone oil was introduced to the lung through the trachea under a slight negative pressure (\u221280 mm Hg) until it reached the distal airways. The silicone RTV was allowed to cure for 48 h, after which the airway tissue was removed with bleach. Silicone RTV diluted with low viscosity silicone oil penetrates well to the level of the terminal bronchioles and alveolar ducts without causing overdistention. The shrinkage rate for the casting material was negligible at 0.32% after 7 days (Perry et al., 2000) .",

Each removed pathway, consisting of a detached (root) airway and its subsequent bifurcations, was reattached to a nearby bifurcation.

The diameter of the root airway was compared with the airway diameters of the intact conducting airway tree. The removed pathway could belong to a bifurcation if its root airway diameter was closest to but smaller than the parent airway diameter. The maximum number of daughter pathways was kept to 3 at each bifurcation. Third, the comparison of the root airway diameter of a removed pathway with the conducting tree airway diameters was repeated for all removed pathways until all were reassigned to different bifurcations and a new conducting tree emerged.

As noted above, data on V L are critical for assessing the reasonableness of the generations of respiratory bronchioles and alveolar ducts and partitioning the total volume among the TB airways, respiratory bronchioles, and alveolar ducts and sacs. In pulmonary physiology studies, a good estimate of V L is provided by the measurement of TLC. In lung morphometry studies, lung volume is typically estimated from the buoyancy of the lungs (minus the trachea and extrapulmonary bronchi) after they are placed in a physiologically-buffered saline solution. In lung morphometry studies, the pressure used for fixation, the materials present in the fixative solution, and the length of time allowed for fixation all influence the volume at which the lungs become fixed. If the fixation procedure results in lungs fixed at a volume near TLC, the estimates of V L from lung morphometry and pulmonary function studies will be close to each other. Hyde et al. (2007) examined a number of alveolar variables in the lungs of male and female rhesus monkeys ranging in age from a few days to more than 7 years, with body weights ranging from 0.41 to 12.66 kg. They determined the number of alveoli, the volume of the airway portion of the alveolar ducts, the volume occupied by the alveoli, and a number of other parameters reflective of lung structure. Their measurements of V L as a function of body weight for their male rhesus monkeys are shown in Figure 1 together with the TLC values for male animals that served as controls in various studies at the California National Primate Research Center. Most of the morphometric study animals had body weights less than 4 kg, and their values for V L agree quite well with the estimates of V L obtained in pulmonary function animals. The variability around the fitted curve increases as body weight increases.",

Subsequenly, 10% buffered formol saline was injected at a pressure of 30 cm of H 2 0 and the trachea clamped. The lungs were then immersed in formol saline for at least 1 week. As the data in Table 3 clearly show, the values for V L are consistently about 30% greater for rhesus monkeys compared to cynomolgus monkeys, with the difference being about 50% for the largest monkey (i.e., body weight of 6.7 kg). Injecting hot gelatin into the pulmonary arteries at 70 mmHg likely deformed the airways, thereby creating considerable artifacts and errors in intrapulmonary airway dimensions. In addition, Hislop et al. (1984) do not make it clear whether the perfusion pressure was maintained at 30 cm H 2 0, which would have further confounded any artifacts or errors. Thus, we would not recommend substituting this cynomolgus lung volume data for rhesus data.",

Thus, the entire lung geometry consisted of 23 airway generations: 15 generations of the conducting airways and eight generations of the alveolar airways.

Thus, airway length to diameter ratio was the same in humans and rhesus monkeys for corresponding airway generation numbers. Airway dimensions of rhesus monkeys were determined in several steps. First, volume fraction of human pulmonary airways (excluding the volume of alveoli) was calculated per airway generation and used to find the cumulative airway volume fraction in the human pulmonary region. The cumulative volume fraction was assumed to be the same for humans and rhesus monkeys. Thus, the volume fraction and cumulative volume fraction in each generation of the rhesus monkey lung was obtained by linear interpolation (Figure 3 ). Next, accumulative and airway volumes in each generation of the rhesus monkey pulmonary tree were found by multiplying volume fractions by an arbitrary volume scale. The volume scale was selected such that the duct volumes (i.e. volume of the last 4 generations of the pulmonary tree) added to 35.69 mL.

Given that the structure and distribution of airway parameters are similar between humans and monkeys (Mercer et al., 1994) , we used the relationship in humans for the number of alveoli per duct to construct the pulmonary acinus structure in the rhesus monkey. The alveoli number distribution versus generation number in humans was used to distribute 70.38 mL (Table 2 ) of alveolar volume among respiratory bronchioles and alveolar ducts of the rhesus monkey airway generations. The fraction and accumulative fraction of the alveoli volume of the human respiratory tree was calculated per airway generation number in the pulmonary region. The alveoli volume fraction and cumulative volume fraction were assumed to be the same for humans and rhesus monkeys ( Figure 4 ).

Thus, we used data from other ages and body weights for these regions and then applied a scaling relationship to obtain estimates of volumes for these regions for infant rhesus monkeys. Schreider and Raabe (1981) made serial step sections through a silicone rubber cast of the URT of a male rhesus monkey weighing 7 kg. From these detailed sections, they determined the perimeter and area of each section. By linking the sections together and taking into account the distance between sequential step sections, one can calculate the surface area and volume between any two sections via a forward or a backward process. The resulting data for surface area and volume were averaged for the forward and backward calculation process and are given in Table 8 , providing another source of data for obtaining URT volume estimates for rhesus monkeys of different sizes.",

These molds had been used in airflow and particle deposition studies conducted at CIIT (Morgan et al., 1991) . The nostrils of the molds were plugged with silly putty prior to filling the molds with ethanol and then weighing the molds. Ethanol was used to more easily eliminate air bubbles compared to using water. The filling and weighing process was repeated three times for each URT mold. The average weight of the ethanol was 6.36 g (0.11 std. dev.) and 13.39 g (0.09 std. dev.), respectively, for the mold from the animal weighing 4.74 kg and the one weighing 10 kg. Taking into account the density of pure ethanol, which is 0.789 g/cm 3 , the URT volume estimates for the 4.74 and 10 kg monkeys were 8.06 and 16.97 mL, respectively. Since the molds of these animals contained a portion of the trachea, the URT volume after adjusting for the tracheal volume of the mold was 7.61 and 15.32 mL for the animals weighing 4.74 and 10 kg, respectively.",

Laboratory measurements of ventilation rates include the tidal volume (V T ) and frequency of breathing (f), which together determine the respiratory minute volume (V\u0307E). The subdivision of V\u0307E into its two components is necessary for accurate deposition modeling because the inhaled particles have varying patterns of deposition depending upon the combination of V T and f. Thus, values of V T and f are needed to calculate material loss in the respiratory tract of rhesus monkeys. While a number of studies have reported group means for V T , f, and V\u0307E, only 3 studies have reported values of these variables on individual rhesus monkeys where the sex was specified (Karel & Weston, 1946; Brooks et al., 1957; Binns et al., 1972) .

Thus, overall, the quadratic model was judged to be the most useful for estimating the value of FRC over a range of body weights from 0.76 to 16 kg. Equation (5) gives the quadratic regression for FRC as a function of body weight and explains 91.4% of the variability in the data.",

The oronasal switching point in adult humans occurs when minute ventilation is at about 35 L/min (Niinimaa et al., 1981) . Currently, data on the oronasal switching point in rhesus monkeys is not known. Thus, here we will examine deposition in rhesus monkeys breathing spontaneously through the nose.

To extend the results to different ages, we take notice of the fact that except for the first 3 months after birth, nasal passages of rhesus monkeys grow in size while the structure and shape remain intact.

When 2 standard deviations above and below the mean body weight are used, this results in a new computation of the values for TLC, FRC, FRC/TLC, minute volume, and V T using Eqs. (3-6) and the average breathing frequency of 39 breaths per minute. In addition, this results in the need to isotropically scale the lung geometry airway dimensions to the size appropriate for the newly specified body weight. The mean values plotted in Figure 12 can be considered as population means with the lines above and below the means reflecting the impact of the variability of different physiologic variable values on the deposition fraction since animals of the same body weight can vary in the values of their physiologic variables. The uncertainty about the URT deposition fractions is much less than it is for the pulmonary region deposition fractions. Based on the limited experimental deposition data available for rhesus monkeys, one standard deviation around the mean deposition fraction can give predicted deposition fractions that are larger or smaller than the mean value by about 0.1-0.15 (Figure 12 ).",

In addition, since monkey and human lung deposition predictions have often been used interchangeably due to the resemblance of lung geometries between these species, MPPD model predictions for humans (Asgharian et al., 2001) with endotracheal breathing are also provided for comparison. Next, deposition fractions and patterns with spontaneous nasal breathing were examined as spontaneous breathing is the most common route of breathing, and this route incorporates the filtration efficiency of the URT in lessening the insult of inhaled material to the sensitive tissues of the LRT. For all deposition calculations we assumed the particles were spherical with a density of 1 g/cm 3 . Hence, all particle diameters are aerodynamic particle diameters. Figure 13 gives predicted deposition fractions of 1 \u03bcm particles in different regions of the lungs of a 6-month-old rhesus monkey with an FRC of 63 mL, tidal volume of 13.6 mL, and breathing frequency of 39 breaths per minute. For humans, a 21-month old child having an FRC of 38.4 mL, tidal volume of 81.2 mL, and breathing frequency of 28 breaths per minute was used. Losses of 1 \u03bcm particles are predominantly by gravitational settling in the pulmonary (PUL) region (i.e., alveolar region). The pulmonary deposition fraction is about the same as the TB region deposition fraction for infant monkeys compared to about a 5-fold increase for human infants. Figure 13 shows that there is a lower overall particle deposition fraction in the lungs of an infant rhesus monkey compared to that of an infant human, which is primarily due to the pulmonary deposition fraction being about 2.5 times larger in human infants than in rhesus infants.",

A comparison of generation-by-generation predicted deposition fraction betweens monkeys and humans reveals information regarding interspecies similarities and differences. Hence, deposition fractions for 0.1 \u03bcm and 1 \u03bcm particles were calculated for different generations of the infant human and rhesus monkey lungs using the values for lung and breathing parameters stated above. While Figure 14 shows that the general trend of particle deposition versus generation number is similar overall for the two geometries for both 0.1 \u03bcm and 1 \u03bcm particles, there are differences that can be attributed to species differences in airway dimensions. The predicted deposition fraction in the infant human lung for both particle sizes shows a steady enhanced deposition in the TB region, reaching a peak deposition fraction in about the 21st or 22nd generation in the alveolar region and then rapidly declining in value. The maximum deposition fraction is much larger for the ultrafine particle (i.e. 0.1 \u03bcm) compared to the 1 \u03bcm particle (0.1 vs. 0.06).",

In the infant monkey, the particle deposition fractions increase steadily in the TB region and reach a peak in the pulmonary region in about the 18th or 19th generation before plummeting to zero. These particle deposition results show that the smaller size of the monkey lung directly influences the mechanisms and distribution of particle losses. Hence, the differences between infant humans and monkeys in lung geometry warrant separate predictive deposition models for these species. The monkey lung cannot be treated by simply scaling down the geometry of a human lung, as was done by Martonen et al. (2001) . Figure 14 were made for only a couple of particle sizes. To generalize, deposition fractions of particles between 0.01 \u03bcm and 10 \u03bcm were calculated in the lungs of infant humans and monkeys at the same breathing and lung conditions noted above. Figure 15 presents predicted deposition fractions in the TB and PUL regions, as well as for the LRT with endotracheal breathing. Particle deposition fractions in the infant monkey TB region are higher than those in infant humans ( Figure 15A ) and are substantially lower than infant humans in the PUL region for particles <3 \u03bcm in diameter ( Figure 15B ). For both species, the peaks for PUL deposition occur at about the same particle sizes (i.e., about 0.04-0.05 \u03bcm and at about 2.7 \u03bcm). The similarity in deposition fraction trends for the LRT region ( Figure 15C ) demonstrates that the deposition model findings seen in Figure 14 can be extended to a wide range of particle sizes, but with the deposition fractions having region specific differences in value.",

After the 10th generation, the TB deposition fraction rises more rapidly in monkeys compared to humans. For more distal generations, the pattern of the deposition fractions is quite similar for the two species for 1 \u03bcm particles, but the value of the peak pulmonary deposition fraction in humans is more than twice that of monkeys and the peak occurs in generation 20 compared to generation 17 ( Figure 20 ). Figure 21 for particles between 0.01 and 5 \u03bcm. Deposition fractions for particles >5 \u03bcm are not depicted because inhalability may well be an issue in monkeys for these larger particles. The impact of the filtration efficiency of the nose is clearly seen in the TB region for both species ( Figure  21A ). There is a substantial decrease in the deposition fraction for ultrafine particles (i.e., 0.01 to 0.1 \u03bcm) for spontaneous nasal breathing compared to endotracheal breathing, most likely due to the high diffusivity of these particles in combination with the complex geometry of the nasal passages ( Figure 21A vs. Figure 18A ). For particles above 1 \u03bcm in diameter, the deposition fraction in the TB region in adult rhesus monkeys rapidly increases to 0.165 for 2.9 \u03bcm particles before rapidly declining; in adult humans, the deposition fraction for particles >1 \u03bcm increases gradually from about 0.05 to 0.09 ( Figure 21A ).",

With new imaging techniques and enhanced computation speeds, more airway geometry models need to be developed for both rhesus monkeys and humans so that the uncertainty in estimated deposition values can be characterized via sensitivity analyses. Given that the range of deposition fractions among individuals most likely overlaps between rhesus monkeys and humans, the uncertainty around the mean values in the population can be quantified with various sensitivity analyses. For example, Figure 22 provides the results for infant and young adult monkeys for endotracheal breathing at a frequency that is \u00b12 standard deviations from the mean of 39 breaths per minute. One sees that there is little impact on TB deposition fraction from variation in breathing frequency for any particle diameter ( Figure 22A and 22C) .

The resultant lung geometry model can be used as the lung morphometry model in mechanistic dosimetry models to predict the deposition of inhaled particles or the absorption of inhaled gases Implementing these dosimetry models for a given monkey of a specific body weight requires estimating the URT volume, FRC, tidal volume, and breathing frequency of the animal.

If an animal was agitated or deeply anesthetized, the resulting alteration in breathing pattern would result in V T values not reflective of normal respiration. One male animal from each study was deleted from the V T data set: (1) an animal in the Karen and Weston (1946) study whose body weight was 53% greater than that of another animal, but still had about the same V T value, (2) an animal in the Binns et al. (1972) study that had a body weight of 3.45 kg had a V T only about 50% of that of another animal of similar size, while the other animal's value was in line with trend line for animals of this and higher body weights, and (3) an animal in the Brooks et al. (1946) study had a V T value more than 50% greater than the V T value of other animals of similar body weight. The scatter plots for female rhesus monkeys did not reveal any animals whose tidal volume values should be considered as outliers. A number of mathematical models were fit to the tidal volume data for each sex. Part A of Table B -1 provides the model coefficients and R 2 values for the models fit to the male V T data, while Part B provides the results for the female monkeys. As can be seen from the table, a quadratic polynomial and an exponential rising model provided almost the same percentage of explanation of the variability in the data for both sexes as reflected by the R 2 values. Given that the models are not to be used to predict V T values above the upper range of the data (i.e., about 5.35 kg), the simpler to evaluate quadratic model is recommended.",

The relationship between tidal volume and body weight for male and female rhesus monkeys over a body weight range of about 2 to 5 kg from analyses of studies reporting measurements on individual monkeys. Relative to extrapolating beyond the range of the experimental data to lower body weights, the data contained in Crosfill and Widdicombe (1961) provided support that going as low as 1.4 kg in body weight is probably okay for male monkeys. These investigators examined tidal volume in rhesus monkeys weighing as little as 1.8 kg, but they did not state which sex was used or if animals of both sexes were used. They reported a V T value of 9 mL as the lowest measurement, which likely was at this body weight; Eq. (B-1) gives a value of 8.4 mL for a body weight of 1.4 kg. If one has used females, extrapolation below 2 kg using Eq. (B-2) is not advised as this quadratic equation begins to provide V T estimates that rapidly decline and become negative. Thus, for female monkeys between 1.4 and 2 kg, use of the linear equation given in Part B of Table B -1 is recommended.",
