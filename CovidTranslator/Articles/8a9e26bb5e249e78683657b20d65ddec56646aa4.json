To address the problem, RNA interference (RNAi) has recently been widely used as a potential antiviral approach. Transgenesis, in combination with RNAi to spe cifically inhibit AIV gene expression, has been proposed to make chickens resistant to avian influenza. For the transgenic breeding, screening the efficient siRNAs in vitro as the candidate genes is one of the most important tasks. Here, we combined an online search tool and a series of bioinformatics programs with a set of rules for designing the siRNAs targeting different mRNA regions of AIV H5N1 subtype. By this method we chose five rational siRNAs, constructed five U6 promoter driven shRNA expression plasmids contained the siRNA genes, and used these to produce stably transfected Madin Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells. Data from virus titration, IFA, PUI stained flow cytometry, real time quantitative RT PCR and DAS ELISA analyses showed that all five stably transfected cell lines were effectively resistant to viral replication when exposed to 100 CCID 50 of AIV, and we finally chose the most effective plasmids (pSi 604i and pSi 1597i) as the candidates for making the transgenic chickens. These findings provide baseline information for breeding transgenic chickens resistant to AIV in combination with RNAi.",

Its genome consists of single stranded, negative sense RNA composed of eight seg ments that encode 10 or 11 proteins [1] . The virulence of AIV results in part from its ability to escape from protective immunity by antigenic drifts [2] and shifts [3] ; consequently, existing vaccines have only a limited value. And although many antiviral drugs have been approved for treatment and or prophylaxis of influ enza, their use is limited because of potentially severe side effects and the possible emergence of resistant viruses [4] . Development of a new rapid acting and effective antiviral strategy against AIV infection is therefore warranted.",

DISCUSSION Although a set of guidelines for the selection of potential siRNA duplexes has been proposed [16] [17] [18] , there are no reliable methods for selecting the effective target regions without practical test. It is well known that different siRNA duplexes induce different levels of RNAi activity [5, 12] . Thus, it is important to screen appropriate target regions conferring a strong RNAi activity within the AIV genome. Among avian influ enza viruses, extensive differences in nucleotide sequences are present in different subtypes. To design shRNAs that remain effective despite antigenic drifts and antigenic shifts, therefore, we focused on regions of the viral genome that are conserved among different H5N1 subtypes. Influenza NP, PA and PB1 are essen tial early proteins during viral replication, providing ideal targets for RNAi [4] . NS1 protein has been reported to have anti RNAi activity [19] , and there fore inhibition of NS1 protein may suppress this acti vity. Consequently, we chose NP, PA, PB1 and NS1 as our target proteins. No siRNAs for HA and NA were designed due to the extensive variations in these genes among different virus strains.",
