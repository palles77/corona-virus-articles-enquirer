            "text": "We provide experimental evidence of a replication enhancer element (REE) within the capsid gene of tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV, genus Flavivirus). Thermodynamic and phylogenetic analyses predicted that the REE folds as a long stable stem-loop (designated SL6), conserved among all tick-borne flaviviruses (TBFV). Homologous sequences and potential base pairing were found in the corresponding regions of mosquito-borne flaviviruses, but not in more genetically distant flaviviruses. To investigate the role of SL6, nucleotide substitutions were introduced which changed a conserved hexanucleotide motif, the conformation of the terminal loop and the base-paired dsRNA stacking. Substitutions were made within a TBEV reverse genetic system and recovered mutants were compared for plaque morphology, single-step replication kinetics and cytopathic effect. The greatest phenotypic changes were observed in mutants with a destabilized stem. Point mutations in the conserved hexanucleotide motif of the terminal loop caused moderate virus attenuation. However, all mutants eventually reached the titre of wild-type virus late post-infection. Thus, although not essential for growth in tissue culture, the SL6 REE acts to up-regulate virus replication. We hypothesize that this modulatory role may be important for TBEV survival in nature, where the virus circulates by non-viraemic transmission between infected and non-infected ticks, during co-feeding on local rodents.",

Together with the seabird tick-borne flavivirus group (sTBFV), they comprise one ecological group of tick-borne flaviviruses (TBFV) within the genus Flavivirus, family Flaviviridae. Two other ecological groups within the genus Flavivirus are the mosquito-borne flaviviruses (MBFV) and flaviviruses with no-known vector (NKV) (4) . A fourth group including Kamiti River virus (KRV) (5) , cell fusion agent virus (CFAV) (6) and Culex flavivirus (CuFV) (7) have been isolated only from mosquitoes with no demonstrated capacity to replicate in mammals and are under consideration by the ICTV Committee for classification as 'probably arthropod-borne viruses' (PABV).",

Indeed, RNA secondary structures have been predicted within the coding region of several flaviviruses (26) (27) (28) . Here, using bioinformatic and reverse genetic analysis we demonstrate that the capsid-encoding region of TBEV contains an REE which we designate SL6 (26, 27) . Phylogenetic evidence suggests that the MBFV group also contains at least a partial SL6-like structure, though it is absent in the NKV or PABV groups. The significance of these findings in the context of flavivirus evolution and adaptation to transmission is discussed.",

This analysis was extended to investigate the conservation of SL6 in the larger group of distantly related mTBFV, sTBFV and KADV (37) . A nucleotide alignment of the C region was generated and optimized by the introduction of numerous gaps (Supplementary Figure S1A) ; it shows that divergent RFV, GGYV and KSIV (distant virus species of the mTBFV) maintained homology in the SL6 region. However, some nucleotide perturbations in the SL6 region were observed between mTBFV, sTBFV (MEAV, TYUV and SREV) and KADV proving that the region between the initiation codon and SL6 had evolved with frame shifts as we previously demonstrated (16) .

Analysis of the entire ORF showed the most striking evidence for conserved base-pairing between the initiation codon at position 133 and position 318, after which a large drop in the frequency of base-paired nucleotides was observed. Within this region SL6 was predicted to be the most significant structure, with conserved pairing between 209 and 254 centred on a region with a conserved lack of base pairing between positions 228 to 236, representing the unpaired apical loop of SL6. The base-paired stem of SL6 contained conserved short single-stranded regions between positions 218-220 and nucleotides 244 and 245 consistent with the unpaired bulge, either side of the paired stem.

Both ALIDOT-predicted DV2 and DV4 (28) fall immediately either side of the region of maximum SSSV suggesting that they are less conserved than DV3 (Supplementary Figure S1A) . STRUCTURE_DIST also predicts the formation of the DV2 and DV3 but not the SL6-like structure (Supplementary Figure S1A and Figure 2 ). However, a truncated SL6-like structure was predicted to form in all DENV serotypes, albeit at a suboptimal energy level, when the SL6-like region was folded independently from neighboring regions that form more stable overlapping structures (Supplementary Figure  S1A) . Taken together, these data indicate that the DENV SL6-like structure was the least stable conformation among the MBFVs, potentially preventing its prediction by statistical approaches used here and elsewhere (28) . Despite this, the short-stem region of putative DENV SL6-like structures is highly conserved within the DENV group (DENV serotypes [1] [2] [3] [4] and also between DENV and JEV (Supplementary Figure S1A) suggesting that a linear or conformational signal at this location might have some functionality.",

Consequently, when mutating the terminal loop sequence UGCCAAAU, silent substitutions could only be introduced into the P codon. Similar difficulties were encountered with mutagenesis of the stem, in which the vast majority of possible synonymous and non-synonymous mutations resulted in no significant conformational changes.

Two purines were changed for two pyrimidines in mutant C19, one in the conserved hexanucleotide. This mutant was highly attenuated in cell culture producing no cpe and a small turbid plaque phenotype (Figures 3-5 and Table 1 ).

Replication of mutant C10 (with an enlarged loop and shortened stem) and C17 (restored wild type conformation due to the second compensatory mutation) was delayed in the early stage of the infection cycle; C17 caused slightly reduced cpe but the plaque morphology of both was equivalent to that of the parental pGGVs virus ( Figure 5 and Table 1 ). The minor phenotypic changes resulting from these mutations could be explained by the accompanying amino acid substitutions N 35 !K and Q 32 !P imitating POWV ( Figure 3 ). However, a silent substitution A 234 !G that also enlarged the apical loop of mutant C11 (Figure 4 ) Table 1 . Affect of mutations within the SL6 on TBEV phenotype Plaque size for each mutant was defined as large (5-6 mm), medium (3-4 mm), small (1-2 mm) or pinpointed (>1 mm). Some plaques, in comparison with parent Vs virus, were described as turbid. The cpe produced by each mutant in comparison to the wild-type virus was evaluated on a scale of 0-4 where 0 indicates no cpe and 4 is maximum cpe (i.e. 80% cell lysis as observed for the control pGGVs virus) in five repeated experiments, each in quadruplicates. Nt/AA* -Nucleotide/amino acid substitutions. caused similar biological effects; it did not affect virus plaque size or level of cpe, but reduced virus replication rate early after infection ( Figure 5 and Table 1 ).",

However, contradicting these findings a deletion within the C-coding region, which included SL6, did not prevent recovery of viable, albeit attenuated, TBEV (42) . In this study, we employed a variety of complementary phylogenetic and thermodynamic methods to examine the evolutionary conservation of SL6 using a much larger sample of significantly divergent TBFVs, including new members of the mTBFV, sTBFV and Kadam subgroups (37) . The viruses in the other ecological groups, namely MBFV, NKV and PABV were also included in this analysis to trace the evolution of SL6 throughout the entire genus Flavivirus. In addition, we used a reverse genetic system (34, 36) to engineer TBEV strains with mutated SL6 to reveal the biological significance of this structure.",

Substitutions within the conserved hexanucleotide loop down-regulated virus growth kinetics whereas changes in the terminal loop outside the hexanucleotide sequence did not alter the observed phenotype. The most significant changes of virus phenotype resulted from substitutions that distorted the stem of SL6; mutations that influenced the length or stability of the stem resulted in the recovery of viruses that formed small and/or turbid plaques. Increasing or decreasing the size of the apical loop had a minor biological effect on virus replication although this could also be interpreted as an effect of the altered stem length. However, the changes in replication kinetics from all modifications of SL6 were moderate and manifested themselves predominantly during the early stage of the virus replication cycle (Table 1) .",

Enhancers were identified as RNA structures that individually produce only small biological effects on virus replication. However, the significance of enhancers as targets for the attenuation of flaviviruses to engineer live vaccines is evident from the example of dengue virus (24, 25) . Moreover, sequence and structural conservation of flavivirus enhancers is consistent with a role as key players in virus survival in the natural environment. We previously proposed that the cumulative action of several enhancer elements could contribute significantly to the overall rate of assembly of polymerase complexes, thereby enhancing virus survival across a range of natural hosts (17, 18, 23, 27, 43, 44) . In this respect, the presented experimental data indicate that SL6 belongs to the category of REEs, i.e. RNA structures that accelerate the replication of viruses (45) (46) (47) (48) (49) (50) (51) (52) (53) (54) (55) (56) . This eliminates the apparent contradictions between extremely high levels of SL6 conservation across divergent TBFV virus species and the redundancy of this element for the replication of laboratory-maintained TBEV strains (45) (46) (47) (48) (49) (50) (51) (52) (53) (54) (55) (56) . However, the specific mechanism by which SL6 functions to enhance virus replication remains to be elucidated.",

The SL6-like structure of MBFV is localized immediately downstream of the 5 0 -CYCL (i.e. within the capsid gene, Supplementary Figure S1A ) suggesting it could also contribute to genome circularization. It is possible that in accord with the 3 0 sHP (highly conserved throughout the genus Flavivirus), it contributes to the unpairing of the 5 0 -3 0 -CYCL panhandle, to promote RNA elongation on the linear template. In contrast, the 5 0 -CYCL of TBFV is mapped to the 5 0 -UTR (i.e. upstream of the capsid gene, Figure 1A ) and therefore other tentative functions of the TBFV SL6 are not excluded, such as enhancing virus translation, RNA replication or playing a role in regulation between these processes; the possibility of a kissing-loop enhancer of genome circularization was previously discussed (17, 18, 23, 27, 43, 44) .",

The requirement to adapt to different molecular environments might result in the evolution of enhancer elements essential for virus replication in one host while being redundant in another. This could explain the contradiction between strict conservation of the different flavivirus enhancers and their apparent redundancy in laboratory systems, which are largely based on mammalian cells (17, 18, 23, 27, 43, 44) . Mutations in SL6 described here have demonstrated its enhancer properties in mammalian cells and it will be interesting to evaluate SL6 enhancer activity in ticks, the major host for maintenance of the TBFV group in the environment (59) (60) (61) .",

Future studies using sub-genomic replicons will allow direct measurement of the influence of these sequences on RNA replication and on interaction with viral and host proteins.",
