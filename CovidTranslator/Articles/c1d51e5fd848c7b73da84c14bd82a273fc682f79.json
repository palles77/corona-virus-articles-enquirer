SARS-CoV-infected macaques developed a disease comparable to SARS in humans; the virus was re-isolated from these animals and they developed SARS-CoV-specific antibodies. This completed the fulfilment of Koch's postulates, as modified by Rivers for viral diseases, for SARS-CoV as the aetiological agent of SARS. Besides the macaque model, a ferret and a cat model for SARS-CoV were also developed. These animal models allow comparative pathogenesis studies for SARS-CoV infections and testing of different intervention strategies. The first of these studies has shown that pegylated interferon-\u2423, a drug approved for human use, limits SARS-CoV replication and lung damage in experimentally infected macaques.",

            "text": "SARS emerged more than a year ago as a new human disease entity (Lee et al. 2003; WHO 2003) , resulting in more than 800 deaths from more than 8000 documented probable cases of the disease. About six months after the disease was first recognized, the WHO declared this global outbreak to be under control, with only few sporadic cases having been diagnosed since. In response to the start of the outbreak, the WHO coordinated an international collaboration that included clinical, epidemiological and laboratory investigations to control the expanding epidemic. Identification of the causative agents was one of the first research priorities. Several viruses and bacteria were initially identified in SARS patients. The recently identified hMPV (van den Hoogen et al. 2001 ) and a newly discovered human coronavirus, SARS-CoV (Drosten et al. 2003) proved to be the most likely candidates on epidemiological grounds in a comparative study involving more than 300 patients fitting the WHO SARS case definition in 12 cohorts in Asia and Europe. hMPV infection was diagnosed in 12% and SARS-CoV infection in 75% of the patients. Other respiratory pathogens were identified only sporadically. SARS-CoV was therefore the most likely causal agent of SARS (Kuiken et al. 2003a) . According to Koch's postulates, as modified by Rivers (1937) for virus diseases, six criteria should be met to establish a virus as the cause of a disease. The first three of these, namely isolation of the virus from diseased hosts, cultivation in host cells and proof of filterability, were met for both hMPV and SARS-CoV. The remaining three criteria were tested for in a series of experiments that we conducted in * Author for correspondence (a.osterhaus@erasmusmc.nl). cynomolgus macaques (Macaca fascicularis): production of a comparable disease in the original host species or a related one, re-isolation of the virus and detection of a specific immunoresponse to the virus (Kuiken et al. 2003a) . Four monkeys were infected with a SARS-CoV isolated in Vero cells from a patient who had died of SARS in Hong Kong. Three of these became lethargic from days 2-3 after infection onwards and two of them developed a temporary skin rash at day 4 after infection. Upon necropsy, carried out on day 6 after infection, three of the animals had multiple foci of pulmonary consolidation in both lungs.",

            "text": "Histologically, the main lesions in the consolidated lung tissue involved the alveoli and bronchioles, and consisted of areas with acute or more advanced phases of diffuse alveolar damage. Occasional multinucleated giant cells were found. In the macaque without clear macroscopic pulmonary lesions, minimum multifocal inflammatory lesions were observed histologically in the pulmonary tissue. By immunohistochemistry, the presence of SARS-CoV could be demonstrated in inflamed lung tissue of the three macaques showing pulmonary consolidation. The presence of SARS-CoV in the lungs was also confirmed by showing typical coronavirus-like particles in pneumocytes in affected pulmonary areas. From day 2 after infection onwards, SARS-CoV could be isolated or demonstrated by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction in sputum, nasal swabs and pharyngeal swabs of one or more animals. In a separate macaque infection experiment, it was shown that SARS-CoV-neutralizing antibodies were present from day 12 after infection onwards . The virus was also isolated from the faeces of one of the two monkeys involved in this experiment. No other relevant respiratory pathogens were identified in any of the macaques experimentally infected with SARS-CoV. Collectively, these data completed the six criteria that needed to be fulfilled to identify SARS-CoV as the aetiological agent of SARS, which probably spilled over recently from an animal reservoir. Moreover, lesions in macaques infected experimentally with hMPV, isolated from a non-SARS individual, were limited to mild suppurative rhinitis and minimal erosions in conducting airways (Kuiken et al. 2003a (Kuiken et al. , 2004 . The disease was not exacerbated in two SARS-CoV-infected macaques that were subsequently inoculated with hMPV Kuiken et al. 2003a) . Besides cynomolgus macaques, we also succeeded in infecting ferrets and domestic cats experimentally with SARS-CoV (Martina et al. 2003) . The virus was efficiently transmitted to noninfected cage mates. The cats did not develop clinical signs, whereas some of the ferrets became lethargic and one died. Infection of the respiratory tract was evident in all the infected animals and, histologically, SARS-CoV infection was associated with pulmonary lesions similar to those observed in the SARS-CoV infected macaques, except that they were milder, particularly in the cats. The availability of three animal models for SARS-CoV infection now allows us to carry out comparative pathogenesis studies as well as the testing of different intervention strategies like the use of antivirals, SARS-CoV-specific antibodies and candidate vaccines. Currently, we are using the ferret and the macaque models for such studies. Recently, we showed in the macaque model that prophylactic treatment of SARS-CoV-infected macaques with the antiviral agent pegylated interferon-\u2423-a drug approved for human use-significantly reduces viral replication and excretion as well as pulmonary damage, compared with untreated macaques (Haagmans et al. 2004) . Post-exposure treatment with this drug yielded intermediate results. These data warrant clinical studies with this drug, if and when SARS re-emerges. Prophylactic or early post-exposure treatment with pegylated interferon-\u2423 may help reduce the impact of SARS-CoV infections on healthcare workers and others possibly exposed to SARS-CoV, and may limit the spread of the virus in the human population.",
