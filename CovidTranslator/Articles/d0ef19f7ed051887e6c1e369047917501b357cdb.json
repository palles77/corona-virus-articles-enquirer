MV is a neurotropic virus and although self-limiting, infection of the CNS could lead to MV persistence in the form of subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE) (McFarland and Dhib-Jalbut 1988) , and subacute measles encephalitis (SME) in immunocompromised patients (Dhib-Jalbut and Johnson, 1994) . Studies in SSPE and the animal model SME demonstrated that the expression of MHC class I molecules is low on infected neurons (Gogate e t a l, 1996) . This is supported by Ward and Massa (1995) , who showed that neither virus nor dsRNA was able to induce MHC class I in neonatal mouse neurons. This is in contrast to the situation in glial cells, in which a number of viruses, including murine coronavirus (Suzumura e t al, 1986) , mouse hepatitis virus (MHV-59) (Lavi e t al, 1989) , avivirus (Liu e t a l, 1989) , sindbis virus (Grif\u00aen et a l, 1992) , and MV (Kraus e t a l, 1992) , are able to induce high expression of MHC class I molecules.",

As a member of the regulators of complement activation (RCA) protein family (Liszewski and Atkinson, 1992) , CD46 is ubiquitously present on primate cells and inhibits lysis of host cells by binding the complement cascade components C3b and C4b, and by acting as a cofactor for their proteolytic inactivation by serine protease complement factor I (Liszewski e t a l, 1991) . Following infec tion with MV, CD46 is rapidly down-regulated from the surface of the host cell (Naniche e t a l, 1993b). S tudies in \u00aeve SS PE cases (Ogata e t a l, 1997) showed that CD46 was not detected or was expressed at very low levels in neural cells at the lesion site, whereas normal levels of CD46 were found in SS PE brain tissue distant from the lesion. Furthermore, CD46 was expressed at relatively low levels by neurons and astrocytes in normal brains in comparison to neuroblastoma cell lines (Ogata e t a l, 1997) . Little is known about the correlation between CD46 levels and IjBa activation in neuronal cells. Therefore, the possibility that MV failure to trigger IjBa activation in the neuronal cells is due to a CD46 malfunction needed to be addressed.",

The average results from three experiments are shown in Figure 4 . The results indicate that MV is capable of stimulating the CMV promoter after 30 min of stimulation.

Cells were pretreated with cyclohexamide (S igma, MO, US A) (100 lg/ml) for 1 h prior to MV or TNFa stimulation. Cyclohexamide-untreated neuronal cultures served as controls. TNFa stimulation was used as a control since it induc es IjBa degradation in neuronal cells. The results are shown in Figure 5 . As expec ted, in cyclohexamide-untreated cells, IjBa degradation was observed in response to TNFa but not MV stimulation at time periods ranging from 5 to 60 min ( Figure 5A ). In cyclohexamide treated cells ( Figure 5B ), IjBa degradation was observed in response to TNFa within 5 \u00b1 10 min post stimulation. In contrast to the cyclohexamide-untreated cells, there was no regeneration of the IjBa band after 60 min of TNFa stimulation, indicating that cyclohexamide effectively blocked d e no vo IjBa synthesis. Importantly, no change in the density of the IjBa band was observed up to 30 min post MV stimulation in cyclohexamide pre-treated cells. This indicates that the unchanged IjBa band density is due to lack of degradation rather than increased synthesis and accumulation of IjBa in response to MV. At 60 min post MV stimulation, the density of the IjBa band was reduced by approximately 50% , possibly re\u00afecting autolysis rather than signal induc ed degradation. The intensity of this IjBa band at 60 min time point was 40% less in the presence of cyclohexamide, compared to the same time point in the absence of cyclohexamide, again re\u00afecting the fact that cyclohexamide was effective in blocking d e no vo IjBa synthesis. Collectively, these results support the notion that there is lack of degradation of neuronal IjBa in response to MV stimulation.",

Both live and UV-inactivated virus resulted in IjBa degradation and NF-jB activation, suggesting that binding of the virus to its receptor is suf\u00aecient for signaling the IjBa/NF-jB system. Therefore, we next examined the possibility that lack of IjBa degradation in neuronal cells may involve a MV receptor defec t. To determine if lack of IjBa phosphorylation and degradation in neuronal cells is due to a MV receptor (CD46) defec t, IMR-32 cells were transfected with a CD46 expression vector. Both transfected and untransfected IMR-32 cells were stained with FITC-conjugated mouse anti-CD46 or FITC-conjugated mouse control IgG isotype and examined by\u00afow cytometry ( Figure 6 ). Compared with untransfected cells, CD46 was expressed at higher levels in transfected cells (D mean\u00afuorescence density of 40 for transfected cells compared to 26 for untransfected cells). IMR-32 cells transfected with CD46-WT were stimulated with TNFa or MV and analyzed by Western blot to identify whether failure of IjBa degradation was due to a CD46 malfunction. IjBa phosphorylation and degradation were examined at 10, 30, and 60 min post MV stimulation which represent focal time points for IjBa phosphorylation, degradation, and regeneration respectively. A representative of two experiments is shown in Figure 7 . Phosphorylation and degradation of IjBa in transfected neuronal cells was not observed after MV stimulation although IjBa was phosphorylated and degraded in response to TNFa stimulation. Therefore, the failure of phosphorylation and degradation of IjBa following MV stimulation is not due to an abnormality involving the MV receptor on neuronal cells. ",

Lately it was identi\u00aeed as MV receptor by binding MV hemagglutinin (HA) protein at two distinct regions of the CD46 complement control protein domains (CCP domain 1 and CCP domain 2) (Do \u00c8 rig e t a l, 1993; Naniche e t a l, 1993a; Buchholz e t a l, 1997). Our study indicates that UV-inactivated MV is capable of inducing IjBa degradation and NF-jB activation. This suggests that ligation of the MV receptor is suf\u00aecient to signal the IjBa/NF-jB system, without the need for infec tious virus. Although little is known about the pathway from CD46 stimulation to IjBa phosphorylation, a mutation in CD46 on neuronal cells may contribute to failure of IjBa activation. To address this hypothesis, we transfected CD46-WT into neuronal cells and stimulated those cells with MV. IjBa phosphorylation and degradation did not occur in those cells despite enhanced CD46 expression. These results suggest that a defec t in the signaling cascade distal to the MV receptor complex, may contribute to the failure of IjBa phosphorylation in neuronal cells in response to MV. However, we cannot exclude the possibility that MV signaling is occurring via another receptor. Using commercially available antibodies to CD46, we have not been able to block MV infec tion of neuronal cells as determined by cell surface MV protein expression (data not shown).",

It is still unclear whether different stimuli utilize independent signaling pathways, or share a common pathway that leads to IjBa phosphorylation. S everal kinases have been shown to be involved in IjB phosphorylation, including the double-stranded RNA-dependent protein kinase (PKR) (Maniatis e t a l, 1992) , PKC and PKA (Shirakawa and Mizel, 1989) , Raf-1 (Li and Sedivy, 1993) , casein kinase II (CKII) (B arroga e t a l, 1995), and IKK (Malinin e t a l, 1997; Maniatis, 1997) . PKR is a serine-threonine kinase involved in growth inhibition and NF-jB activation through phosphorylation of eIF2a and IjBa respectively (Clemens and Elia, 1997) . PKR activation requires dsRNA binding to the domain at its N-terminal, auto-phosphorylation and dimerization. S tudies in PKR knockout mice demonstrated a lack of NF-jB activation by poly (I)\u00d7poly (C), but this activation remained intact in response to TNFa (Yang e t a l, 1995) . To exclude the possibility of a PKR defect in the inability of MV to induce IjBa degradation in neuronal cells, we have previously performed PKR auto-phosphorylation assays in MV stimulated neuronal and glial cells. The results showed that MV was unable to phosphorylate IjBa in neuronal cells despite PKR activation (Dhib-Jalbut e t a l, 1999), suggesting either a failure to activate a signal distal to PKR in the signaling cascade that leads to IjBa phosphorylation or the existence of a PKR-independent pathway used by virus to phosphorylate IjBa (Dhib-Jalbut e t a l, 1999).",

A pathway of TNFa induc ed IjBa phosphorylation by an IjBa kinase complex (IKK) has been described (Malinin e t a l, 1997; Maniatis, 1997) . This kinase complex consists of two catalytic subunits: IKKa and IKKb (DiDonato e t a l, 1997; Mercurio e t a l, 1997) and a regulatory subunit IKKc (Rothwarf e t a l, 1998) . IKKb is phosphorylated by mitogen-activated protein kinase/ERK kinase kinase-1 (MEKK1) (Nakano e t a l, 1998), whereas IKKa is phosphorylated by NF-jB-induc ing kinase (NIK) (Malinin e t a l, 1997) . In addition to the NIK-IKK pathway, a recent study demonstrated the involvement of PI(3)K-Akt pathwayin IjBa phosphorylationin response toTNFa stimulation (Ozes e t a l, 1999). We are currently investigating whether the NIK-IKK and PI(3 )K-Akt pathways are involved in MV-induc ed IjBa phosphorylation in glial cells. If so, a defec t in one of these pathways could be responsible for lack of IjBa phosphorylation in response to MV in neuronal cells.",
