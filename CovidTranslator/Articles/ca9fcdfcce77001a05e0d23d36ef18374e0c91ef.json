Since September 5, 2014, three patients infected with Ebola virus were medically evacuated from Africa to receive medical care in the NBU. The successful operation of the NBU can be attributed to a myriad of factors, but the impact of concerted, interprofessional teamwork and excellent communication between the diverse staffing personnel cannot be understated.",

Approximately half of the nursing staff are trained and experienced in critical care, while the remaining regularly work in other areas including the operating room, medical-surgical floors, emergency services, or pediatrics. Respiratory therapists are integral to managing the airways of critically ill patients with EVD as well as serving as a second caregiver in the room if needed. Patient care technicians support care activities and assist with waste management via operation of the in-unit autoclave in the NBU. All NBU staff members are cross trained to serve in various roles within the unit. Operational EVD care has necessitated a multidisciplinary physician team, with emphasis on expertise in infectious diseases and critical care medicine. NBU relationships with other physician specialties such as pediatrics, obstetrics, and surgery have also been established for care consultation as needed and suggested by consensus from the European Network of Infectious Diseases (EUNID). 2 Infectious disease physicians monitor and manage infection progression and oversee administration of experimental drugs. 3 An expert in clinical research coordinates regulatory aspects related to the Food and Drug Administration's approval of Emergency Investigational New Drug use, obtaining the new drugs through pharmaceutical companies, transfusion specialists for convalescent plasma, the Pharmacy & Therapeutics committee, an Institutional Review Board, and the Clinical Research Center team. Additionally, laboratory and pathology staff support clinical care with point-of-care testing instruments through the in-unit BSL-3 laboratory, the Nebraska Public Health BSL-3 laboratory, and the core laboratory. 4 The core functionality of the NBU centers around the multidisciplinary leadership team comprised of the unit medical director and associate medical director, nursing director, lead clinical nurse, research director and environmental specialist, associate research director and transportation specialist, education director, and clinical research specialist. 3 In leadership team formation and performance, unique professional skills from critical areas in health care were specifically drawn upon to oversee the operation of the NBU, incorporating medical and nursing care and treatment, unit administration, environmental infection control, emergency planning, and training/continuing education. Each NBU competency represented is crucial for safe, comprehensive unit functionality.",

Medical facilities without an autoclave would be required to obtain a Department of Transportation (DOT) Category A infectious substance special permit in conjunction with their designated medical waste vendor to transport and remove Ebola waste. 5 The NBU liquid waste disposal process involving exposure to hospital grade disinfectant before toilet flushing was discussed with local public works and plumbing organizations to alleviate concern for Ebola contamination via hospital plumbing. 5 Multiple supporting departments within Nebraska Medicine and UNMC as well as external partners were necessary to maintain functionality of the NBU before, during and after activation ( Table 1) .",

            "text": "The NBU utilizes a collaborative model with a minimized hierarchical structure. 7 Every individual involved in the NBU team, regardless of profession, is responsible for the health and safety of his or her co-workers, particularly during procedures such as donning and doffing (i.e., putting on and removing) personal protective equipment (PPE). Thus, all staff are encouraged and expected to immediately notify their coworkers if they notice any potential breach in protocol or PPE during patient care. Bringing attention to an error in the NBU is viewed as lifesaving, rather than a criticism of the staff member. Additionally, given the risks of working in the biocontainment setting and importance of following rigorous environmental infection control, the NBU staff members are responsible for all environmental services tasks within the NBU such as waste management and routine room cleaning during the stay of a patient with EVD. Many of the clinical care providers spend a portion of each shift in the NBU performing tasks that are not in their usual job description, including bleach wiping surfaces in the patient room and patient bathroom, mopping the patient room and hallway floors, removing solid waste by autoclave, etc. A similar model of shared maintenance duties between the care team was recommended by EUNID, in which biocontainment unit staff are cross-trained in areas such as phlebotomy, food service, and housekeeping to minimize the number of personnel in contact with the patient and put at risk of disease transmission. 2 NBU health professionals are educated in fundamental infection control practices and use their knowledge of biocontainment unit execution to adjust procedures as necessary to maintain maximum safety. For instance, health providers regularly using PPE may recognize a problem associated with prolonged or repeated wearing and suggest modifications to enhance safety. Most importantly, the NBU leadership team recognizes the importance of the voice of the direct care providers and values their input in creating and modifying protocols.",
