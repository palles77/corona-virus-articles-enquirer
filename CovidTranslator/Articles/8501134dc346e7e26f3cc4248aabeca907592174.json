However, problems with the supply and cost of MK cells and the presence of endogenous viruses, including herpes B virus and SV-5, necessitated a search for an alternative cell line. Continuous cell cultures of human origin (L132, A-549, HUT-292, HEK, G-293, G-401, A-498, A-704, CAKI-1, RD) and simian origin (LLC-MK2, BSC-1, MA-104, Vero) were evaluated for their capacity to support the growth of the human paramyxoviruses, as followed by cytopathic effect, hemadsorption, hemagglutination, and EIA. NCI-H292 (HUT-292) human lung mucoepidermoid carcinoma cells (ATCC # CRL-1848) proved to be the most sensitive line for cultivating all serotypes and strains of the paramyxoviruses. These cells were also shown to be a suitable substitute for MK in primary isolation of paramyxoviruses from clinical specimens. RPMI-1640 with 1.5gg/ml trypsin was the preferred maintenance medium; alternatively, Eagle's MEM supplemented with 1.5 gg/ml trypsin and 0.1% ITS was satisfactory. NCI-H292 cells are a continuous line with excellent growth characteristics, although the genetic polyploidy of the cells may limit the number of passages of usable cells.",

In fact, all 5 human parainfluenzaviruses were first isolated in vervet or rhesus MK cells and mumpsvirus was initially recovered in rhesus monkeys [5, 8, 10, 11, 18] .

(a) The trapping of rhesus monkeys in India is discouraged to preserve the species in its native habitat. (b) Primates carry many endogenous viruses (adventitious agents), e.g., adenoviruses, herpesviruses (including CMV), papovaviruses, myxoviruses, and enteroviruses, which carry the risk of infecting laboratory workers handling the animals or their tissues. For example, the problem of workers contracting monkey B virus (Herpesvirus simiae), which is harmless to monkeys but usually fatal in man, is well known [7, 19] . (c) The kidneys of rhesus monkeys are sometimes latently infected with adenoviruses, enteroviruses, and herpesviruses, and almost always are infected with SV-5 (a myxovirus) and SV-40 (a papovavirus). Although these two agents are not known to infect man, they often compromise virus isolation and identification work, reagent production, and vaccine testing, and thus constitute a major built-in viral contamination problem for the laboratory. (d) Despite the establishment of breeding colonies in the U.S., the use of monkeys solely for their kidneys is now generally regarded as wasteful and cruel. (e) Monkeys are expensive to feed and house, and the preparation of primary cell cultures from them is a labor-intensive and costly endeavor.",

The results are indicated as the number of isolates recoverable in each cell type at the end of 6 passages ( Table 4 ). The strains of parainfluenza 1, 2, and 3 were recovered in the first or second passage in both celt systems, while the strains of parainfluenza 4 and mumps required 3 to 4 passages, as expected from the general lability of these viruses. All viruses were recovered except for 1 strain of mumps in MK cells and 2 in H292 cells. Thus, the H292 cells are clearly susceptible to a broad range of strains.",

The cultures are then followed for CPE at 2, 4, and 7 days, subpassaged to provide for maximum virus recovery (we prefer 3 subpasses at weekly intervals), and hemadsorbed with guinea pig erythrocytes as usual.",

Detailed studies of the virus spectrum of H292 cells are in progress and will be reported separately.",
