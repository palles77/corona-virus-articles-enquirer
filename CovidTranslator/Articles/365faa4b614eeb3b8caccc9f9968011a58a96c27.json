A possible correlation was found between subjective nasal patency scores and nasal mucosal temperature, but our results were inconsistent. The higher temperature in the left cavity suggests that the sensor irritated the nasal mucosa, affecting the correlation between patency scores and mucosal temperature.

During this time, informed consent was completed, medical history was reviewed to assess for exclusion criteria, and subjects were administered the Nasal Obstruction Symptom Evaluation (NOSE) and unilateral Visual Analog Scale (VAS) questionnaire to assess subjective perception of nasal patency. Next, the subject was seated in a chair for measurement and a baseline oral temperature was recorded. The miniaturized thermocouple was inserted into the nasal cavity under direct visualization by means of a nasal speculum and a headlight. No decongestants or local anesthetic were applied. The probe was lightly positioned against the septal mucosa and held in place by a trained otolaryngologist to ensure anatomical site and technique consistency between subjects. Mucosal temperature was recorded during quiet breathing for 60 seconds at two sites on the nasal septum, namely at the nasal vestibule (Site 1) and across from the head of the inferior turbinate (Site 2) ( Figure 1 ). For Site 2, patients were asked to complete 3 deep breathing cycles (inhalation and exhalation) following the initial 60 seconds of quiet breathing. Inhalation rate was not recorded, but greater respiratory effort during deep breathing was verified by audible respiratory sounds. Both nasal cavities were measured, with the right cavity always measured first. Each subject completed measurement in approximately 6 minutes to avoid changes in nasal airflow related to the nasal cycle. Measurements were performed on four different days (each subject was measured only once). While room air temperature was consistent on different days (average 23.6 \u00b1 0.3\u00b0C), room air humidity varied slightly among different sessions (average 35 \u00b1 15\u00b0%).",

The last 3 breathing cycles of each 60second recording were selected for analysis (except when comparing the first 3 breathing cycles vs. the last 3 breathing cycles). It was reasoned that analyzing the last 3 breaths during a 60-second recording would help mitigate the effect of awareness of breathing, which has been shown to alter the spontaneous breathing pattern, particularly via prolongation of inspiratory and expiratory times. 21",

A statistically significant correlation was found between both NOSE and VAS with \u0394T exp-insp measured on the right vestibule, but this correlation was not found in any other site ( Figure 5 ). There are several possible explanations for these inconsistent results. One possibility is that the miniaturized thermocouple irritated the nasal mucosa eliciting a thermal response (Figure 4) , thus confounding the correlation between mucosal temperature and subjective scores. The fact that the right vestibule was the first site to be measured in all patients is consistent with this hypothesis, since measurements at this site would be the least affected by the consequences of mucosal irritation.

In our study, more than half of subjects (12 out of 22) had a NOSE score of 0, while 6 out 22 subjects reported a VAS score of 0 for both cavities. This cluster of zero-valued scores would reduce the correlation with any objective measure of nasal patency. In addition, the lack of correlation between NOSE scores and left-side VAS scores in our study suggests that these questionnaire-based scores are very noisy, particularly at the low obstruction levels seen in healthy subjects. 7 For future studies, a better strategy would be to quantify nasal mucosal temperature before and after an intervention, such as nasal surgery or exposure to cold air. An intervention provides an anchor for the subjective sensation of nasal patency, 26 which may improve the correlation between subjective patency scores and objective measures of nasal airflow.",

Measurements were always carried out first on the right cavity, followed by the left cavity, and mucosal temperatures were significantly higher on the left cavity. In some cases, a gradual rise in the average temperature was clearly observed over the course of measurement (Figure 4 ). Operator discomfort in holding the temperature sensor at a fixed point over an extended period of measurement sometimes led to variations in the pressure imposed on the sensor, thus contributing to mucosal irritation. It is possible that some participants suppressed their breathing as they tried to ignore the irritating stimulus. Although Lindemann and coauthors stated that mucosal irritation was not observed in their study, 20 mucosal irritation with concomitant increase in nasal mucosal temperature was observed in other studies using contact temperature sensors. 30, 31 Thus, we suggest that future studies should consider non-contact sensors for recording nasal mucosal temperature. 30, 37 Another limitation of our study is that mucosal swelling was not tracked. It is possible that, by irritating the nasal mucosa, the temperature sensor caused mucosal swelling, affecting the airflow rate. Future studies should consider investigating changes in nasal mucosal temperature during the nasal cycle. In theory, nasal mucosal temperature is lower in the decongested side, where airflow is higher. Thus, one should expect oscillations in nasal mucosal temperature in synchrony with the nasal cycle.",

            "text": "In summary, more investigation is needed into the temperature dynamics of the nasal mucosa and its role in nasal airflow sensation. This study confirms that a higher inhalation rate during deep breathing is associated with lower end-inspiratory nasal mucosal temperature. This quantitative observation is consistent with the common experience that airflow sensation is enhanced during deep breaths, thus supporting the hypothesis that mucosal cooling plays a central role in nasal airflow sensation. However, the correlation between nasal patency scores and mucosal temperature was inconsistent and likely confounded by the miniaturized thermocouple irritating the mucosa. Our observations suggest that two strategies could be used in future studies to clarify the role of nasal mucosal temperature in subjective nasal patency, namely (1) non-contact temperature sensors can be used to prevent mucosa irritation and (2) nasal mucosal temperature can be measured before and after an intervention, such as nasal surgery or exposure to cold air. A better understanding of the physiologic mechanism of nasal airflow sensation could lead to more accurate objective methods to assess nasal patency and eventually to better outcomes for NAO surgery.
