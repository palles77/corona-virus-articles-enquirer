Methods: Using a cross-sectional, telephone survey, 805 Chinese adults in Hong Kong were interviewed anonymously in November, 2005 to examine beliefs related to H5N1 avian influenza and anticipated responses. Results: Of respondents, 71.4% and 52.4%, respectively, believed that bird-to-human or human-to-human H5N1 transmission would occur in the next year. In the event of a bird-to-human or human-to-human outbreak in Hong Kong, many anticipated high fatality rates (70.5% and 74.4%, respectively), permanent physical damage (52.0% and 54.9%, respectively), inadequate vaccines (50.0% and 64.4%, respectively), insufficient medicine supplies (43.7% and 54.5%, respectively), inadequate hospital infection control (35.1% and 43.3%, respectively), high susceptibility of family members contracting H5N1 (13.9% and 24.3%, respectively), and impact on oneself/family worse than those of severe acute respiratory syndrome (21.2 and 25.0%, respectively). Most anticipated at least 1 of the 7 studied stress-related responses (e.g., panic) or the adoption of at least 1 of the 5 studied preventive behavioral measures (e.g., avoiding going out). Conclusion: Panic and interruption of daily routines may occur in the event of a human avian influenza outbreak. Dissemination of accurate, timely information would reduce unnecessary distress and unwanted behaviors. (Am J Infect Control",

Telephone calls were made by trained interviewers in the evening (from 6:30 PM to 10:00 PM) to avoid overrepresentation of unemployed persons. For unanswered calls, at least 3 other independent calls were made before considering the number to be invalid. Similar methods have been used in several studies on SARS 3 as well as a study on avian influenza. 6, 7 The household member whose birthday was closest to the date of the interview was invited to join the study. Verbal informed consent was obtained from the respondents and ethics approval was obtained from the Ethics Committee of the Chinese University of Hong Kong. The response rate, defined as the number of completed interviews divided by the number of eligible households, was approximately 57%.

Avoidance behaviors that were examined included avoidance of hospitals, crowded places, going out, and going abroad, and the likelihood of not sending their children to school.",

Anxiety is expected to be greater if 2 to 3 new cases of human-to-human transmission are reported, as compared with the reporting of 2 to 3 new bird-to-human transmission cases in Hong Kong. During a local full-blown human avian flu outbreak, the level of psychological distress would be much higher than those just described. Fear of the unknown may be a common feature of newly emerging infectious diseases. Therefore, the government should take steps to prevent general panic in the public from occurring. Similar results to those reported in studies of stress and quality of life during the SARS epidemic were found, 4 and the perceived chance of one's family members contracting avian influenza also was associated with anticipated distress. Therefore, family counseling and psychological support would be an essential part of the response to an epidemic. Implicit comparisons between human avian influenza and SARS may have been made by many respondents, because more than 40% of the respondents believed that SARS and human avian influenza have similar symptoms. The level of distress experienced during the SARS epidemic was associated significantly with anticipated distress and avoidance behaviors. The SARS epidemic caused tremendous damage to Hong Kong's population and many individuals exhibited posttraumatic stress symptoms. 3, 7 Hence, human avian influenza may elicit recollections of the respondent's painful SARS-related experience, which may elevate the perceived level of distress that is due to human avian influenza. Therefore, particular attention must be given to those who were affected greatly by the SARS epidemics (e.g., patients, health care workers).",

In 1997, humans who were affected by H5N1 had been reported in Hong Kong, but not in other countries. According to our observations, not much distress seemed to exist in the public in Hong Kong, although this was not documented. Therefore, it is argued that whether a newly emerging infectious disease results in distress in the public depends on external factors (e.g., whether other countries are being affected) and local factors, such as experience with other diseases (e.g., SARS). Human avian influenza was seen by many respondents to result in serious medical consequences that are in line with its high reported fatality. 8 It is interesting to see that even before the onset of a newly emerging infectious disease (in our case, human avian influenza), people may be changing their behaviors (e.g., avoiding visiting hospitals because of fear of contracting avian influenza infection and eating less poultry meat). This study showed that such behavioral changes were associated significantly with anticipated distress and anticipated avoidance behaviors. With the onset of a human avian influenza outbreak in Hong Kong, more than 50% would adopt at least 4 out of the 5 avoidance behaviors studied. There is little doubt that the local economy would be affected, even at the onset stage of a local human influenza epidemic. It is likely that the level of distress would be enhanced in a vicious cycle, as seen in the SARS epidemic. 3, 9 Respondents were asked to rate their level of emotional distress during the SARS epidemic on a 1-10 point scale.

In Hong Kong, however, almost all households have telephones 11 and a large number of local published studies on SARS 3-5 or avian influenza 6, 12 have used this method. Because the attitudes and perceptions measured may change over time, especially when circumstances changes (e.g., reporting of new infection), telephone surveys have the advantage-over household surveys-of collecting data within a short period of time. The response rates of both types of surveys are comparable in the local setting. Second, the response rate of the study was not high. Again, the response rate was similar to many of the other local studies that have been published, 11, 13 with the distributions of 18-to 39-year-old and 40-to 60-year-old age groups being comparable to those obtained from the Census data (49.6% and 50.4%, respectively). When we asked about the perceived adequacy of vaccine, we used the term ''vaccine'' and did not specify what type of vaccine, because an H5N1 vaccine is not available. This is assessing the subjective perception of a hypothetical situation in the future, and the way of asking should be acceptable. The gender distributions (46.6% male and 53.4% female) also were comparable to the Census distributions (47.8% male and 52.0% female). 14 Adoption of behavioral responses was self-reported and had not been validated. Test-retest reliability was not established; however, during this preoutbreak stage, it is unlikely that social desirability strongly biased the reporting of these behaviors. Recall bias also is unlikely to be significant because of the short recall period of 1 to 3 months.",

It is very likely that even at the onset of a human avian influenza epidemicregardless of whether it is a bird-to-human or humanto-human transmission-widespread distress, panic, and avoidance behaviors would occur in Hong Kong as well as in the other affected countries. It is very likely that the economy and daily life in the affected societies will be affected severely. Because a pandemic may occur, the level of distress may be worse than that during the SARS epidemic. Therefore, psychological preparedness in the community is essential; however, caution should be exercised in extrapolating the observed results to other countries because Hong Kong has its own unique SARS experience. Other countries that are concerned about avian influenza should carry out their own assessment and surveillance on the potential impact of avian influenza. The government should proactively reassure the public about its preparedness and include provision of family psychological counseling services and emergency plans to deal with any crisis situation. Surveillance of perceptions and responses of the general public also should become a regular part of the preparatory plans.",
