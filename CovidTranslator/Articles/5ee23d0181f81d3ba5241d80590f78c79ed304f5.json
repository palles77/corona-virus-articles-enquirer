Interactions between N proteins and RNA are thus crucial for the assembly of infectious virus particles. The 45 kDa recombinant nucleocapsid N protein of coronavirus infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) is highly sensitive to proteolysis. We obtained a stable fragment of 14.7 kDa spanning its N-terminal residues 29-160 (IBV-N29-160). Like the N-terminal RNA binding domain (SARS-N45-181) of the severe acute respiratory syndrome virus (SARS-CoV) N protein, the crystal structure of the IBV-N29-160 fragment at 1.85 \u00c5 resolution reveals a protein core composed of a five-stranded antiparallel b sheet with a positively charged b hairpin extension and a hydrophobic platform that are probably involved in RNA binding. Crosslinking studies demonstrate the formation of dimers, tetramers, and higher multimers of IBV-N. A model for coronavirus shell formation is proposed in which dimerization of the C-terminal domain of IBV-N leads to oligomerization of the IBV-nucleocapsid protein and viral RNA condensation.",

            "text": "In structural terms, coronavirus virions are roughly spherical, with an approximate diameter of 120 nm. Their detailed in vivo morphology is still a matter of debate but might be composed of three structural layers: a lipid envelope with three or four glycoproteins, a protein core, and a tubular or helicoidal nucleocapsid, as shown for the porcine transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) (Escors et al., 2001) . Low-resolution electron micrographs have highlighted the crown-like structure that surrounds the coronavirus envelope (Sturman et al., 1980) . These spikes contain the S protein, a class I fusion glycoprotein (Bosch et al., 2004; Lescar et al., 2001) which is also responsible for binding to the receptor (Lai and Holmes, 2001) . Two integral membrane proteins, M (about 230 amino acids) and E (about 100 amino acids), are essential for the maturation of newly formed virions, and are sufficient for the formation of a closed viral particle (Vennema et al., 1996) . The M protein is thought to possess three transmembrane segments and a large C-terminal endodomain that interacts with the nucleocapsid and possibly also with the RNA genome (Sturman et al., 1980; Kou and Masters, 2002; Narayanan et al., 2003) . The nucleocapsid protein of IBV (IBV-N) is a phosphoprotein of 409 amino acids that is well-conserved across various IBV strains (Williams et al., 1992) and is also important for cell-mediated immunity. It forms a protective shell that packages the viral genomic RNA of 27.6 kb and is also thought to participate in viral RNA replication and transcription. Specific packaging of viral genetic material is usually performed via the recognition of a particular nucleotide sequence by a nucleocapsid protein. Such ''packaging signals'' have been identified at the 3 0 end of the viral genomes of mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) (Fosmire et al., 1992) and bovine coronavirus (BCV) (Cologna and Hogue, 2000) and at the 5 0 end of the TGEV genome (Escors et al., 2003) , but not unambiguously for the IBV genome. In elegant structural studies performed in other viral families with RNA genomes, such as HIV (De Guzman et al., 1998) and the MS2 bacteriophage (Valegard et al., 1997) , the packaging signals were seen to form a stem-loop structure that is recognized by the nucleocapsid protein. In the case of the IBV genome, this special RNA structure has not been determined with certainty, although previous studies demonstrated that the IBV-N protein interacts specifically with RNA sequences located at the 3 0 noncoding region of the viral genome (Zhou et al., 1996) . Both the N-and C-terminal domains of IBV-N, but not its middle region, bind to an oligoribonucleotide of 155 nucleotides, located at the 3 0 end of the viral genome nontranslated region, but little is known about the details of this interaction and how it relates to virus assembly (Zhou and Collisson, 2000) .",

The full-length recombinant IBV-N protein expressed in Escherichia coli is unstable. Through cleavage by E. coli proteases, a stable fragment of 14.7 kDa comprising its N-terminal residues 29-160 can be obtained. We report here the crystal structure of this N-terminal fragment refined at 1.85 \u00c5 resolution and compare it to the N-terminal RNA binding domain of the SARS-CoV N protein (SARS-N45-181), which was solved recently using NMR (Huang et al., 2004) .

Crystallization trials with the full-length protein produced crystals that grew from a precipitate after about 3 months. Analysis of dissolved crystals using SDS-PAGE reveals that they contain a fragment of the full-length protein of about 14.7 kDa (Figure 1) . A domain of similar size could be obtained by incubating the IBV-N protein at room temperature for the same period ( Figure 1 ). Thus, this polypeptide fragment presumably derives from slow proteolysis of IBV-N by traces of E. coli proteases present in the crystallization solution. In order to identify its nature, this proteolytically stable fragment was subjected to mass spectrometry, which revealed a mass of 14,692 Da. N-terminal amino acid sequencing identified residues Ser-Ser-Gly-Asn-Ala-Ser-Trp, which are located at positions 29-35 of the IBV-N amino acid sequence. Given that Ser-29 is the first amino acid of the fragment, the closest mapping onto the sequence gives Leu-160 as the C-terminal residue (calculated mass 14,691 Da). The IBV-N29-160 protein shares 37% amino acid sequence identity with the N-terminal RNA binding domain of a comparable domain from the SARS-CoV N protein (SARS-N45-181), whose structure was reported recently (Figure 2 ).",

            "text": "Overexpression of the recombinant N-terminal IBV-N29-160 fragment readily gave crystals diffracting beyond 2.0 \u00c5 (Figure 1 ). Attempts to solve the structure by molecular replacement using the averaged NMR structure of a SARS-CoV nucleocapsid N-terminal domain deposited in the Protein Data Bank (PDB) (Huang et al., 2004) were unsuccessful, even though the two structures turned out to adopt a related fold ( Figure 2 ). The IBV-N29-160 protein is devoid of methionine and cysteine residues. Thus, in order to assist structure determination using the multiwavelength anomalous dispersion (MAD) method, Ile-62, Leu-104, and Val-116 were mutated to methionine. These hydrophobic amino acid residues have been shown to introduce little perturbation in the native protein structure when substituted by methionine residues (Gassner and Matthews, 1999) . In addition, the presumably exposed residue Lys-85 (as suggested by an amino acid sequence alignment with the SARS-CoV N protein) was mutated to Cys in order to introduce a potential binding site for mercury compounds. This mutated fragment of IBV-N29-160 was used for structure determination using the MAD method with crystals containing the selenomethionyl protein. Data collection, phasing, and refinement statistics are summarized in Tables 1 and 2 for the selenomethionine-derivatized crystal (SeMet) and for the native protein crystal. Overall, the path of the main chain is unambiguously defined in clear electron density for the two IBV-N29-160 molecules present in the asymmetric unit in each crystal form. A total of 134 protein residues per molecule (two extra residues at the N terminus derive from the cloning procedure) were included in the final models, which have excellent stereochemical parameters as well as 182 and 188 welldefined water molecules, respectively (Table 2) . Electron density is absent for the Lys-81 side chain which is exposed to the solvent.",

The IBV-N29-160 monomer has approximate overall dimensions of 35 \u00c5 3 35 \u00c5 3 30 \u00c5 and consists of a core formed by a five-stranded antiparallel b sheet with the topology b 4 -b 2 -b 3 -b 1 -b 5 , which faces a smaller antiparallel sheet composed of only two strands, b 1 0 -b 4 0 , which are absent in the SARS-N protein (Figure 2) . A long flexible hairpin loop b 2 0 -b 3 0 , which is inserted between the b 2 and b 3 strands, protrudes largely from the protein core. This extension is mobile, as shown by higher than average temperature factors, and contains several basic residues which are conserved across various coronavirus N protein sequences ( Figure 3 ). Extended loops spanning up to 30 residues connect the various secondary structure elements, presumably introducing flexibility to the overall architecture. This potential adaptability to various structural contexts might be important for assembly and disassembly of the nucleocapsid during the virus life cycle. The overall fold is similar to the SARS-N45-181 protein ( Figure 2 ) with a few structural differences, such as the presence of a short 3 10 helix connecting strands b 1 0 and b 2 . Overall, a three-dimensional structural alignment between the SARS-CoV and IBV nucleocapsid N-terminal domains using the program DALI (Holm and Sander, 1993) shows that a total of 124 equivalent Ca atoms can be superimposed, with an rms deviation of 3.0 \u00c5 . The Z score is 10.4, confirming the global similarity of the two folds. The rather large difference between the SARS-CoV and IBV nucleocapsid N-terminal domain structures accounts for the failure of molecular replacement procedures to solve the latter structure using the former as a model. The important structural differences we observe between the SARS-CoV and IBV nucleocapsid N-terminal domain structures may stem from an inherent mobility of the coronavirus nucleocapsid structure or from a large uncertainty of the atomic positions determined by NMR, or both. A search through the PDB did not return any other protein with a statistically significant Z score, emphasizing the uniqueness of this fold as noted by Huang et al. (2004) .",

The transformation is not a pure rotation, as a residual translation is needed to bring the two monomers into coincidence. The relatively small surface area suggests a rather weak binding affinity, an observation in agreement with the fact that, using size exclusion chromatography, the recombinant IBV-N29-160 protein predominantly elutes as a monomer (see below). This is also consistent with our findings of a different dimeric interface adopted by the same recombinant IBV-N29-160 protein in a nonrelated crystal form (with space group C2) that diffracts only to medium resolution.",

Because the segment 92-95 includes strictly conserved hydrophobic residues which are buried in the protein core in our structure, we propose that the fragment 1-91 studied by Zhou and Collisson (2000) was probably poorly folded and thus nonactive. We tested nucleic acid binding by IBV-N29-160 and found that the recombinant fragment was able to bind an oligoribonucleotide from the 3 0 end of the viral genome ( Figure 4 ). This result is in agreement with studies by Huang et al. (2004) , who used NMR to demonstrate that SARS-CoV N45-181 could bind a 32-mer oligoribonucleotide located at the 3 0 end of the SARS-CoV genome. Interestingly, this oligoribonucleotide has a highly conserved sequence across various coronaviruses including IBV, and adopts a unique tertiary structure (Robertson et al., 2005) . A surface representation of electrostatic charges of the IBV-N29-160 protein shown in Figure 5 reveals a striking segregation in the charge distribution on the protein surface. The b 2 0 -b 3 0 hairpin forms a basic patch at the thumb, whereas the base is acidic ( Figure 5 ). These two charged patches are separated by a neutral and rather hydrophobic platform contributed by residues projecting from strands b 4 -b 2 -b 3 that form a palmlike structure. An alignment of nucleocapsid protein amino acid sequences from various coronaviruses highlights the conservation of several residues exposed at the protein surface, suggesting that some might play a role in nucleic acid recognition (Figures 3 and 5) .

Secondary structure predictions and limited proteolysis studies of the IBV-N protein suggest the presence of a structured-possibly a-helical-C-terminal domain of about 12 kDa, which is connected to IBV-N29-160 by a Ser/Arg/Ala/Gly-rich loop of approximately 50 amino acid residues (Figure 1) . We expressed such a stable recombinant C-terminal domain encompassing residues 218-329 of the N protein in a soluble form. This C-terminal domain can bind RNA (Figure 4 ), fold independently, and was recently crystallized (H.F., D.X.L., and J.L., unpublished data). Crosslinking experiments show that IBV-N218-329 forms dimers, trimers, tetramers, and higher oligomers for concentrations of crosslinking agent higher than 1 mM with a concomitant decrease in monomer species, thus confirming the important contribution of the C-terminal domain of IBV to the formation of IBV-N multimers ( Figure 6 ). As an independent confirmation, we subjected the IBV-N29-160 and IBV-N218-329 domains to size exclusion chromatography (Figure 7) . Under these conditions, the C-terminal domain IBV-N218-329 elutes faster than the N-terminal domain as a sharp symmetric peak corresponding to a dimer. The N-terminal domain elutes at a position intermediate between a monomer and a dimer (with an estimated size corresponding to a protein of molecular weight 18.1 kDa). This pattern of migration could be due to the asymmetric shape of the IBV N-terminal domain or could be indicative of the presence of a mixture of monomer and dimer of the N-terminal domain in solution.",

            "text": "Our data suggest that residues 218-329 at the C-terminal end of the IBV-N protein play a major role for its multimerization. This is consistent with results reported by Surjit et al. (2004) , who studied SARS-CoV nucleocapsid dimerization using the yeast two-hybrid system, and points to conserved assembly properties between the SARS-CoV and IBV in spite of significant amino acid differences between their two nucleocapsid proteins. Can we ascribe a function to multimer formation by the N protein? One obvious explanation is that multimerization increases the protein surface area accessible for binding the viral genomic RNA, thus provid-ing the elementary building block for nucleocapsid assembly. Indeed, several crystal structures of capsid proteins have revealed the presence of multimers that present continuous patches of basic residues at their surface: the capsid proteins of West Nile virus and Borna disease virus form tetrameric assemblies (Dokland et al., 2004; Rudolph et al., 2003) and the nucleocapsid protein of porcine respiratory syndrome virus, an arterivirus, forms dimers (Doan and Dokland, 2003) . Unfortunately, because these structures were determined in the absence of an RNA ligand, it is difficult to evaluate to what extent multimer formation is coupled with nucleic acid recognition. In the Arteviridae, a viral family genomically related to the coronaviruses, the basic N-terminal half of the nucleocapsid protein is involved in RNA binding while its C-terminal domain forms a tight dimer (Doan and Dokland, 2003) . Further complexity for the study of coronavirus nucleocapsid assembly stems from its interaction with the M protein endodomain (Kou and Masters, 2002; Narayanan et al., 2000 Narayanan et al., , 2003 and from the fact that several coronavirus proteins can interact with single-stranded RNA, including the nsp9 replicase protein from SARS-CoV (Egloff et al., 2004; Sutton et al., 2004) . In the absence of a nucleic acid ligand, the N protein appears to be composed of two main globular domains loosely connected by Arg/Ser/Ala/Gly-rich loops that are highly sensitive to proteolysis. These connecting regions may undergo modifications (e.g., phosphorylation) that could influence the multimerization state of the protein and control its interaction with RNA. In a recent report, sumoylation of Lys-62 of SARS-CoV N protein expressed in mammalian cells was proposed to promote dimerization of the protein (Li et al., 2005) . It is not known whether similar modifications of the IBV-N occur in virus-infected cells. Nevertheless, a working hypothesis for coronavirus nucleocapsid formation can be proposed (Figure 8 ). In this model, viral genomic RNA binding by both the N-and C-terminal domains would lead to a clustering of N proteins. Dimerization of the C-terminal domains would trigger oligomerization of the N-terminal domains by increasing their local concentration above a certain threshold. In turn, this would trigger condensation of viral RNA. Interdomain flexibility we have defined in the linker regions could facilitate the necessary conformational changes during the transition to a more compact form of the ribonucleocapsid (Figure 8) .",
