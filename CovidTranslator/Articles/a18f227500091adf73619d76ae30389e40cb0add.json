Previous studies have identified Ser190, Ser192, Thr378 and Ser379 as the phosphorylation sites for coronavirus infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) N protein. In this study, we show that phosphorylation at Thr378 and Ser379 sites is dependent on the ataxia-telangiectasia mutated (ATM) and Rad3-related (ATR), a kinase activated during IBV replication. Introduction of Ala substitutions at these two sites individually, in combination of the two and together with other two sites (Ser190 and Ser192) into an infectious IBV clone did not affect recovery of the recombinant viruses containing the mutations. A mutant virus (rIBV-Nm4) carrying the four Ala substitutions grew at a similar, if not better, growth rate as wild type virus. This study reveals a cellular kinase responsible for phosphorylation of a coronavirus N protein at two positions and the functional consequence of this modification on coronavirus replication.",

Sequence comparisons and structural studies have identified three main structural domains, although their primary sequence conservation is low (Lai and Cavanagh, 1997; Li et al., 2005) . Of this the middle domain is an RNA-binding domain, capable of binding both coronavirus-and non-coronavirus-derived RNA sequences in vitro Tan et al., 2012; Zhou et al., 1996) . The motifs for ribosome binding and nucleolar localization signals have been assigned to domain III . More recently, Chang et al. (2009) proposed that all coronavirus N proteins may share a similar modular organization. In cells expressing the N protein, it localizes either to the cytoplasm alone or to the cytoplasm and nucleolus . This nucleolar localization has been shown to be a common feature of the coronavirus family . The prime function of the protein is to associate with the genomic RNA to form a ribonucleoprotein complex (RNP) and viral core (Davies et al., 1981; Escors et al., 2001; Narayana et al., 2000; Riso et al., 1996) . The protein may also play an important role in the replication of the genomic RNA (Chang and Brian, 1996) , and in the transcription and translation of subgenomic RNAs (sgRNA) (Almaz\u00e1n et al., 2004; Baric et al., 1988; Stohlman et al., 1988; Tahara et al., 1994; Z\u00fa\u00f1iga et al., 2010) . In addition, N protein might inhibit host cell proliferation or delay cell growth, possibly by disrupting cytokinesis (Chen et al., 2002; Wurm et al., 2001) . It can also stimulate strong humoral and cellular immune response, making it a potential vaccine candidate (Kim et al., 2004) .",

Similar to other coronaviruses, IBV N protein is heavily phosphorylated. By using mass spectroscopic analysis, two conserved amino acid clusters, Ser190Ser192 and Thr378Ser379, in IBV N protein were identified as the two regions for phosphorylation (Chen et al., 2005) . Subsequently, a total of six residues (Ser162, Ser170, Thr177, Ser389, Ser424 and Thr428) were identified as phosphorylation sites for mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) A59 N protein (White et al., 2007) , and four phosphoserines at positions 9, 156, 254 and 256 were identified in transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) N protein (Calvo et al., 2005) . In addition, the host cell kinase (s) responsible for phosphorylation of coronavirus N protein is beginning to emerge. One example is glycogen synthase kinase-3, which was shown to be involved in regulation of the phosphorylation of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) N protein . Current evidence suggests that phosphorylation may play important roles in regulation of the functions of coronavirus N protein. These included regulation of its subcellular location, viral RNA transcription, particle assembly, immunoreactivity and specificity (Calvo et al., 2005; Jayaram et al., 2005; Shin et al., 2007; Surjit et al., 2005; Spencer et al., 2008) . However, the functional relevance of N protein phosphorylation has not been rigorously tested in the context of virusinfected cells using an infectious clone system, and host cell kinases responsible for phosphorylation of other coronavirus N proteins are not reported.",

More recently, IBV infection was shown to induce DNA damage response and activation of the ataxiatelangiectasia mutated (ATM) and Rad3-related (ATR) kinase/ checkpoint kinase-1 (Chk1) pathway partly through interaction between coronavirus nsp13 and DNA polymerase delta (Pol \u03b4) (Xu et al., 2011) . In this study, we show that phosphorylation at the Thr378 and Ser379 sites is dependent on ATR, a kinase activated during IBV replication. Introduction of Ala substitutions at these two sites individually, in combination of the two, and together with the other two sites (Ser190 and Ser192), into an infectious IBV clone did not affect the recovery of recombinant viruses containing the mutations. A mutant virus (rIBV-Nm4) carrying Ala substitutions at all the four previously identified sites grew at a similar, if not better, growth rate as wild type virus. This study reveals a cellular kinase responsible for phosphorylation of a coronavirus N protein at two sites and the functional consequence of this modification on coronavirus replication in virusinfected cells.",

The specific residues for the ATM kinase activity including Chk2 on Thr68 and ATM on Ser1981, however, were not detected in the same infected cells, demonstrating the activation of the ATR-Chk1 pathway during IBV infection (Xu et al., 2011) . During this study, we noted that, when cells were infected with IBV at high multiplicity of infection and an excess amount of samples was loaded, a batch of pChk1-specific antibodies was also able to detect clearly a band migrating slightly more rapidly than pChk1 in IBV-infected cells, but not in cells infected with the ultraviolet (UV)-inactivated IBV at 8 and 12 h post-infection (Fig. 1) . It should be pointed out that this observation was not consistently made when pChk1-specific antibodies from different sources were used. It was also noted that apparently more pChk1 was detected in cells treated with UV-inactivated IBV (Fig. 1) . This increased detection of pChk1 may represent cellular contamination from the inoculums, as the virus stocks used for UV irradiation were prepared by freezing/thawing the infected cells and were not purified.",

Probing of the same membrane with antibodies against ATM/ATR substrates detected much less phosphorylated N protein in the presence of SchB (Fig. 2c) . Quantification of the band intensities by densitometry after normalizing to the total N protein showed that the ATR-dependent phosphorylation of N protein was reduced to 47% and 2% after addition of 10 and 15 \u03bcM of SchB, respectively (Fig. 2c ). The phosphorylation of IBV N protein by ATR was then analyzed in cells overexpressing the N protein. Cells transfected with IBV N construct were subjected to UV irradiation at 22 h posttransfection in the presence or absence of 10 \u03bcM of SchB. Western blot analysis with antibodies against IBN N and ATM/ATR substrates showed that significantly less phosphorylated IBV N protein was detected in the UV-irradiated, transfected cells in the presence of 10 \u03bcM of SchB (Fig. 2d ). In the absence of 10 \u03bcM of SchB, a 2.8-fold increase of the ATR-dependent phosphorylation of N protein was detected in the transfected cells after UV-irradiation, compared to that in the cells without UV-irradiation ( Fig. 2d ). In the presence of 10 \u03bcM of SchB, a 1.5-fold increase of the ATR-dependent phosphorylation of N protein was detected by the same comparison (Fig. 2d ). These results would lend more support to the conclusion that ATR is one of the kinases responsible for phosphorylation of IBV N protein.",

The Ala substitutions were then introduced into an IBV infectious clone either individually, or in combination of two, four, five or six, and nine recombinant IBVs were recovered from these constructs (Fig. 3a) . All the nine mutant viruses were passaged in cells up to eight passages and their genetic stability was determined by nucleotide sequencing of the entire N protein-coding region. The sequencing results confirmed that the Ala substitutions were stably maintained in all the mutant viruses, and no additional mutations were introduced into the N protein during passaging. The growth properties of the recombinant viruses (passage 8) were then determined. As shown in Fig. 3b , very similar growth kinetics was found between wild type IBV and the mutant viruses. One notable difference was that all mutant viruses reached their peak titers at 32 h post-infection, while wild type virus reached the peak titer at 24 h post-infection (Fig. 3b) .",

            "text": "In this study, we provided evidence suggesting that phosphorylation of IBV N protein at Thr378 and Ser379 by ATR appears to play a limited, if any, regulatory function in IBV replication and infectivity in cultured cells. As IBVNm4 also covers Ala substitutions at other two previously identified phosphorylation sites (Ser190Ser192), it would point to the possibility that phosphorylation of coronavirus N protein at these four sites may represent a by-effect of host response to virus infection. Coronavirus infection may activate a diversity of host cell signal transduction pathways as well as kinases, which would in turn lead to the phosphorylation of viral N protein. This may explain why more phosphorylated N protein is incorporated into IBV virions (Jayaram et al., 2005) , as extensive phosphorylation of N protein would occur at a relatively late stage of the viral infection cycle. It is currently unclear if this is specific to IBV, as some other coronaviruses, such as MHV, tend to incorporate hypophosphorylated N protein into virions (White et al., 2007) On the other hand, we cannot rule out the possibility that phosphorylation of IBV N protein may occur at other positions in cells infected with Nm4 and other related mutant viruses, and phosphorylation at these alternate sites would functionally compensate for the loss of phosphorylation at these four positions. This possibility would be supported by the observation that significantly more phosphorylated N protein was detected in cells infected with Nm5, Nm6 and Nm7 mutant viruses, than in cells infected with Nm4. It appears that additional Ala substitutions at Ser65 and Thr109 in these three mutant viruses might induce more phosphorylation of IBV N protein at a site(s) recognized by the pChk1-specific antibodies used. In this context, it would be interesting to determine which phosphorylation site(s) of IBV N protein may be recognized by this pChk1-speific antiserum. Data present in this study are inconclusive, but appear to indicate that both Thr378 and Ser379 may be recognized specifically or nonspecifically by the pChk1 antibodies used, as significantly reduced amounts of the phosphorylated N protein were detected in cells infected with mutant viruses containing mutations at these two positions, compared to that in cells infected with wild type and other mutants. However, as certain amounts of the phosphorylated N protein were still detected by this antiserum in cells infected with these mutant viruses, other phosphorylation site (s) must exist.",

            "text": "Multiple cellular kinases are involved in phosphorylation of coronavirus N protein. This may constitute another layer of regulatory mechanisms controlling the phosphorylation status of coronavirus N protein in virus-infected cells. For example, both Thr378 and Ser379 residues could be phosphorylated by casein kinase II (CKII), as predicted by computer-aided programs. It was reported that CKII can be stabilized by ATR-dependent phosphorylation of Chk1 at Ser317 in response to stalled DNA replication (Martin and Ouchi, 2008) . This in turn would lead to phosphorylation of phosphatase and tensin homolog protein (PTEN) at Thr383. As IBV infection activates the ATR/Chk1 pathway, phosphorylation of IBV N protein at multiple sites may be also regulated by a similar mechanism. In addition, phosphorylation of N protein is most likely a dynamic process, timely regulated during the infection cycle. In this study, we showed that the phosphorylated N protein was detected by a pChk1-specific antibody at as early as 8 h postinfection, as well as at 24 h post-infection. Analysis of the effects of Ala substitutions on the phosphorylation status of IBV N protein in virus-infected cells was carried out at 24 h post-infection in most of the studies shown here. This time point was chosen based on the consideration that slightly delayed growth kinetics was observed in most of the mutant viruses. It was noted that more phosphorylated N protein was detected in cells infected with some mutant viruses (mainly Nm1 and Nm2 mutant viruses) than that in cells infected with wild type virus. This may reflect this dynamic regulatory process at this time point.",

In fact, Western blot analysis of viral protein expression and viral growth kinetics analysis showed that most of the mutant viruses grew similarly well as wild type virus. This is confirmed by detailed analysis of the growth properties and kinetics of IBVNm4, showing that the mutant virus grew equally well, if not better, as wild type virus, although a slightly delayed growth kinetics was observed. Interestingly, after reaching peak titer at 24 h post-infection, the mutant virus remains at its peak titer until the end of the time course at 32 h post-infection. This is in contrast to wild type virus, which reached the peak titer at 16-24 h post-infection. The titers were gradually declined afterward. The underlying mechanisms for this difference are currently unknown, but it may reflect the difference in virus-host interactions between wild type and the mutant virus. One possibility is that the mutant virus may have an altered ability to induce cell death or cell cycle arrest. A more thorough study would be required to understand this issue more.",

Both Vero and H1299 cells were routinely used to culture Vero-adapted IBV (Liu et al., 1995 (Liu et al., , 1998 Tay et al., 2012) The passage 65 (p65, designated wild type virus (wtIBV) of Vero-adapted IBV Beaudette was described before (Fang et al., , 2007 . The IBV strains were propagated in Vero cells and the tissue culture infective dose (TCID 50 ) of viral stocks was calculated by the Reed-Muench method (Yamada and Liu, 2009 ).

Full-length transcripts were generated in vitro using the mMessage mMachine T7 kit (Ambion, Austin, Tex). Wild type IBV N gene transcripts were also generated to enhance the recovery of virus. Vero cells at about 90% confluency were trypsinized, washed twice with ice-cold PBS, and resuspended in PBS. RNA transcripts were introduced into Vero cell by using the Bio-Rad Gene Pulser II electroporator. Cells were cultured overnight in 1% FBS-containing DMEM in a 6-well plate and further incubated in DMEM without FBS. At 48 h post-electroporation, viral RNA replication was investigated by RT-PCR of the negative strand gRNA. Transcription of subgenomic mRNAs was investigated by RT-PCR as described before (Tan et al., 2006; Fang et al., 2007) . The N gene of recovered rIBV clones (at the 3rd passage in Vero cells) was amplified by RT-PCR and subsequently confirmed by the DNA sequencing analysis.
