Half-daily intraperitoneal (i.p.) doses of each substance administered 24 and 18 h prior to i.p. virus challenge protected the majority of mice infected with banzi, encephalomyocarditis, San Angelo, and Semliki Forest viruses at doses of 25, 50 and 100 mg/kg/day. These compounds at 100 mg/kg/day also protected most suckling rats infected intranasally with rat coronavirus. However, no survival benefit was afforded to treated mice infected intranasally with vesicular stomatitis virus. 8-C1-7-dzguo was orally active against Semliki Forest virus in mice at 200 and 400 mg/kg/day, whereas 7-dzTOGuo is reported to not be effective orally. In uninfected mice, the two compounds induced similar amounts of interferon following i.p. injections. Interferon was induced by oral treatments with 8-C1-7-dzGuo but not with 7-dzTOGuo. Fifty percent acute lethal doses to uninfected mice treated i.p. in half-daily doses for one day with 7-deazaguanosine (7-dzGuo), 7-dzTOGuo, and 8-C1-7-dzGuo were 400, 600 and > 1600 (no mortality at this dose) mg/kg/day, respectively. Daily, i.p. treatments for 14 days with these substances (100 mg/kg/day) showed 7-dzGuo as 100% lethal and the other two substances as not toxic. By virtue of reduced toxicity and oral bioavailability, 8-C1-7-dzGuo appears to have the greatest clinical potential as an interferon-inducing antiviral agent.",

            "text": "Nucleoside biological response modifiers have been synthesized which inhibit many RNA and some DNA viruses in mice and rats (Smee et al., 1992) . These compounds, 7and/or 8-substituted guanosine analogues, are active by virtue of interferon induction, although other immune components such as B-cells, natural killer cells, and macrophages are also stimulated (Smee et al., 1992) . Recently, we showed that the ribosyl moiety can be replaced with various alkyl side chains; many of the resulting compounds exhibited antiviral activity in mice (Michael et al., 1993) . 7-deaza-7-thia-8-oxoguanosine (7-dzTOGuo) (Fig. 1) was one of the first of the interferon-inducing nucleosides to be investigated for antiviral activity (Nagahara et al., 1990; Smee et al., 1989 Smee et al., , 1990a . It was shown to be active by intraperitoneal (i.p.) but not by oral administration. Subsequently, 7-deazaguanosine (7-dzGuo) was found to be active by both i.p. and oral routes (Smee et al., 1991a) when given for a short (one to two days) duration. However, daily dosing with 7-dzGuo for a week was fatal to mice. In a continuing search for orally active compounds with minimal toxicity, 8-chloro-7-deazaguanosine (8-C1-7-dzGuo) (Fig. 1 ) was synthesized. This report describes the antiviral activity of 8-C1-7-dzGuo compared to 7-dzTOGuo against several virus infections in vivo, and includes data of its oral activity in Semliki Forest virus-infected mice. The abilities of 8-C1-7-dzGuo and 7-dzTOGuo to induce interferon are presented, and the toxicities of 8-CI-7-dzGuo, 7-dzTOGuo, and 7-dzGuo are compared.",

            "text": "8-C1-7-dzGuo was synthesized from 7-dzGuo (Ramasamy et al., 1988) by the following procedure. To a stirred solution of the 2',3',5'-tri-O-acetyl derivative of 7-dzGuo (11.8 g, 30 mmol) in dry dimethylformamide (DMF) (200 ml) was added N-chlorosuccinimide (4.02 g, 30 mmol) in DMF (50 ml) during a 0.5-h period. The mixture was stirred at room temperature for 15 h and evaporated to dryness. The residue was purified on a silica gel column (3 \u00d7 40 cm) using a CH2C12 to acetone gradient. The fractions containing 2',3',5'-tri-O-acetyl-8-chloro-7-dzGuo eluted first and were pooled, evaporated to dryness, and the residue crystallized from a mixture of CH2C12/ hexane to yield 10.0 g (78.5%) of the product. A product isolated from subsequent fractions as foam was identified as 2 ', 3', D.F. Smee et al. /Antiviral Research 26 (1995) 203-209 205 of 0.50 g (4%). To prepare 8-C1-7-dzGuo, a solution of 2',3',5'-tri-O-acetyl-8-chloro-7-dzGuo (0.88 g, 2 mmol) in methanol/ammonia (100 ml, saturated at 0\u00b0C) was stirred at room temperature for 15 h in a pressure bottle. The reaction mixture was cooled to 0\u00b0C, the bottle was opened and the solvent evaporated to dryness. The residue was purified on a silica gel column (3 X 15 cm) using a CH2C12 to methanol gradient. The homogeneous fractions were pooled and evaporated to dryness. The residue was crystallized from a mixture of acetone/methanol to yield 0.60 g (95% yield). The overall yield for the entire reaction scheme was 80.5%. The purity of 8-C1-7-dzGuo was > 99%. Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy was used to identify and characterize each of the products above. 7-dzGuo and 7-dzTOGuo were synthesized using the published methods (Ramasamy et al., 1988; Nagahara et al., 1990) and were > 99% pure. The compounds were dissolved in 2% sodium bicarbonate (pH 8.6-8.9) to achieve aqueous solubility. Bicarbonate served as the placebo control for all animal experiments. Banzi virus (H336 strain) (a flavivirus), encephalomyocarditis virus (EMC strain) (a picornavirus), San Angelo virus (a bunyavirus), Semliki Forest virus (original strain) (a togavirus), rat coronavirus (8190 strain), and vesicular stomatitis virus (Indiana strain) (a rhabdovirus) were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection, Rockville, MD. Swiss Webster female mice (18-20 g) and pregnant Lewis rats were from Charles River Labs, Wilmington, MA. These RNA viruses were chosen because 7-dzTOGuo and 7-dzGuo are active against most of these viruses (Smee et al., 1989 (Smee et al., , 1990a (Smee et al., , 1991a . The methods for infecting the mice or suckling rats with these viruses was reported previously (Smee et al., 1989 (Smee et al., , 1990a . Briefly, intraperitoneal infections with banzi, encephalomyocarditis, San Angelo, and Semliki Forest viruses were made. Infections with rat coronavirus and vesicular stomatitis virus were done by intranasal route. Approximately ten 50% lethal doses (10 LD50) were given to the animals. The pre-treatment regimen employed was that found to be most effective for 7-dzTOGuo and related compounds (Smee et al., 1992) . Increases in survivor numbers were evaluated by the two-tailed Fisher exact test. Mean survival time increases were statistically analyzed by the two-tailed Mann-Whitney U test. This test is not able to evaluate results when group sizes (animal that died) are fewer than three.",

Significant protection was achieved with 8-C1-7-dzGuo doses of 25, 50 and 100 mg/kg/day by i.p. route, and to a lesser extent at 200 and 400 mg/kg/day by oral administration. The degree of oral antiviral potency of 8-C1-7-dzGuo is similar to that reported for 7-dzGuo (Smee et al., 1991a) . Only certain kinds of viruses are susceptible to treatment with interferon-inducing agents in these rodent models (Smee et al., 1992) . The profile of inhibition of the RNA viruses reported here is in agreement with the former studies. 8-C1-7-dzGuo is as active as 7-dzGuo against banzi, San Angelo, Semliki Forest, and rat coronaviruses, but was more effective than 7-dzGuo against encephalomyocarditis virus (comparing the present results with those of Smee et al., 1991a) . 8-CI-7-dzGuo and 7-dzTOGuo appeared to be very similar in terms of potency and efficacy against the RNA viruses tested when given by i.p. route.",

Based upon the biological variation, there was no significant difference between the amounts of interferon induced by the two nucleosides. After oral treatments with 8-C1-7-dzGuo, (200 mg/kg) interferon at < 101\"0, 10 2\"\u00b0, and 10 2.3 units/ml was detected in serum at 1, 3, and 5 h, respectively.

An exception to this is Punta Toro virus infection, which could be treated as late as 36 h after virus challenge and still be curable (Smee et al., 1991b) . Stringfellow et al. (1977) determined that many virus infections suppress the ability of mice to produce interferon in response to chemical inducers when the inducers are administered several hours after virus inoculation. For this reason, pre-treatments given before or very soon after infection are almost always warranted, as was done in the present studies.",

The toxic effects of 7-dzGuo after repeated dosing proved to be an undesirable characteristic, however. By the substitution of the chlorine atom at the 8-position of the molecule, 8-C1-7-dzGuo was found to be much less toxic yet equally or more active against virus infections in vivo. Recently we showed the substitution of the ribosyl portion of these molecules for alkyl groups could be made without subsequent loss of i.p. antiviral activity (Michael et al., 1993) . However, these alkylated 7-deaza compounds were not orally active. In fact, out of all these related compounds synthesized and evaluated to date, only 7-dzGuo and 8-CI-7-dzGuo are orally bioactive. 8-C1-7-dzGuo is the more promising of the two orally-active interferon-inducing antivirals due to its decreased toxicity.",
