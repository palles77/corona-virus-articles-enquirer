For this purpose, a total of 30 calves were infected experimentally with E. zuernii oocysts and faecal samples taken regularly from the rectum and examined for faecal consistency and oocyst excretion. Six of the calves underwent pathological examination at various points in time after infection. Significant macroscopic and microscopic changes were demonstrated and parasitic stages were identified in the intestinal mucosa of infected calves during the late prepatent and patent period. Inflammatory reactions revealed by light microscopy were confirmed by electron microscopical investigations. Treatment of calves with toltrazuril during the late prepatent period resulted in significantly lower frequencies of diarrhoea and levels of oocyst excretion, and weight gain was significantly higher than in shamtreated animals.

Data on the duration of the prepatent period in E. zuernii infection in the literature are only sparse because most studies relate to natural infections. In the present studies, a prepatent period of between 15 and 24 days was observed in the infection model. All of the infected, untreated calves from both studies which were not sacrificed before the end of the prepatent period excreted E. zuernii oocysts during the patent period with a maximum output of 123,100 opg in one calf (27 dpi) and showed diarrhoea, partly haemorrhagic and with tissue. Differential diagnosis did not reveal any other pathogenic agents besides E. zuernii, so it is concluded that the clinical signs observed validate the presence of coccidiosis in the untreated calves. Contrary to the experiences described previously [3] , it was possible to provoke clinically relevant coccidiosis regularly in healthy calves with the selected dose of 150,000 E. zuernii-oocysts per calf. This proved the validity of the infection model used and the selected infective dose. Because the study conditions were identical for all calves (housing, feed), the variability shown in the prepatent period was probably attributable to the nature of the pathogen, i.e. it is broader than previously [4] assumed. At the same time, a relatively high variability in the duration of the prepatent period of 15-24 days and in the duration and severity of the clinical symptoms was seen in both studies: diarrhoea varied from liquid to haemorrhagic diarrhoea with tissue, and calves showed normal to depressed animal behaviour. Maximum oocyst excretion differed from 350 opg (one animal of Study II) to 123,100 opg (one animal of Study II). Though all calves showed diarrhoea due to coccidial infection and clearly associated with oocyst excretion, a defined temporal correlation between the beginning of diarrhoea and oocyst excretion could not be observed for all calves, in group E of Study II the beginning of diarrhoea was between up to 4 days before and 1 day after the first oocyst excretion day. The correlation of the last day of diarrhoea and the last day of oocyst excretion was comparably broad: the diarrhoea ended up to 5 days before until up to 2 days after the end of oocyst excretion. In all calves diarrhoea was observed during the patent period, the mean number of days with concurrent oocyst excretion and occurrence of diarrhoea was 4.5 days over all calves of group E.",

            "text": "Toltrazuril has been applied successfully to treat coccidiosis after natural Eimeria infections [2,10 -12] of calves. In the present study (Study II) these field experiences were validated under defined conditions in an experimental infection model. There are basically two options for the treatment of E. zuernii coccidiosis: either after the onset of clinical disease/oocyst excretion (therapeutic approach) or during the prepatent period, i.e. before in vivo diagnosis of infection is possible (metaphylactic approach). Both approaches have been studied comparatively in field studies [2] and caused a reduction in oocyst excretion and clinical symptoms, with metaphylaxis proving considerably more effective. In the present studies (Study II), metaphylactic treatment with toltrazuril was found to be very effective against massive E. zuernii infection. Significantly less diarrhoea in regard of duration and severeness, lower oocyst excretion and higher weight gain were found in the group treated with 15 mg toltrazuril/kg live weight compared to the shamtreated control group. While all shamtreated calves shed considerable numbers of oocysts and developed diarrhoea, mostly up to haemorrhagic quality, only four of the treated animals developed diarrhoea of liquid quality and only one of these calves shed a low amount of oocysts on 26 dpi. The diarrhoea observed in four of the toltrazuril treated calves was obviously not correlated with the coccidial infection, for no oocyst shedding was detected apart from one calf which shed such a low amount of oocysts (50 opg) that is not to be associated with clinical signs. The high effectiveness of treatment with toltrazuril during the prepatent period of coccidial infection is also consistent with experiences in calves [13] and other mammals [14, 15] already described.",
