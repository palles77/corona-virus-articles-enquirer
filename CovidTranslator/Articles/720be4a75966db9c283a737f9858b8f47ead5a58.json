With this in mind, the authors in [23, 24] recently investigated the well-known epidemic final size equation of Kermack and McKendrick [17] , with a view to understanding the extent to which the original equation remains valid under a range of modelling assumptions. In fact, the original derivation of [17] is already rather general, in that the expected infectivity of an individual is allowed to be an arbitrary function of time since infection, and in particular an individual's infectious period may be drawn from a general distribution. An illuminating discussion of the work of [17] appears in [5] . Sections 9 and 10 of [23] extend the model to allow for population heterogeneity; the final size equation obtained is a special case of Eq. (7) of [27] . Ma and Earn [23] discuss conditions under which the form of the original Kermack-McKendrick [17] equation is retained, and note that in the presence of heterogeneities, appropriate modification of the equation is generally required. Further recent discussion of the form of the final size equation, with particular reference to network models, appears in [24] .",

Our aim is to investigate the extent to which observations such as these remain valid for more sophisticated and realistic models. It is worth noting that we shall not be concerned with the dynamics of the infection process, but only with the existence, uniqueness, and form of the endemic equilibrium point. In particular we do not consider stability of equilibria, nor whether the infection process displays oscillatory behaviour. These are of course crucial properties, but the objective here is to study the simplest aspects in quite a general context. We discuss issues of stability briefly in Section 4.",

            "text": "There are many aspects of the two models presented thus far that are clearly gross simplifications of biological reality. Firstly, the ordinary differential equation formulations imply that individuals' lifetimes and infectious periods are exponentially distributed. These are in general not biologically plausible assumptions. In fact, the early work of Kermack and McKendrick on endemicity [18, 19] already allowed an individual's expected infectivity to be a general function of time since infection, so that in particular, infectious periods need not be exponentially distributed. In terms of individuals' lifetimes, the treatment in [18, 19] is somewhat less satisfactory. In [18] there is no death except due to infection, whereas in [19] natural deaths occur at constant per-capita rates, so that an individual who never becomes infected will live for an exponentially distributed time. More recent work that does not assume exponentially distributed lifetimes and infectious periods has generally fallen into two categories. Firstly, some authors follow the lead of [19] in allowing for a realistic infectious period distribution while assuming that lifetimes are exponentially distributed, for instance [10, 12, 16] . This assumption is clearly unrealistic, but can greatly simplify the analysis. Alternatively, so-called 'age-structured' models ( [9, 14, 31] and Chapter 22 of [30] ) allow for a realistic lifetime distribution, but often not a realistic infectious period distribution. In such models the rate at which individuals recover from infection is typically allowed to depend upon the individual's age, but not upon the time since infection. This makes the model somewhat difficult to interpret, since the distribution of an individual's infectious period is not straightforward to extract from this framework. For instance, for many infections a reasonable simplifying assumption is that the infectious period is a constant. This means that the rate of recovery depends in the most extreme way upon time since infection, and there is no way to even approximate this within such an age-structured model. Age-structured models in which the recovery rate is allowed to depend upon both age and time since infection are described and studied in [8, 13, 15, 16] . Closer to the spirit of the current work is the recent paper [1] , in which the authors study a model based upon that of [18, 19] , in that an individual's expected infectivity is allowed to be a general function of time since infection, but allowing a general lifetime distribution.",

This formulation in terms of multiple stages may be regarded as a special form of time-varying infectivity function; however, we prefer the formulation of stages, which has become standard in modern infection modelling, for the following reasons. Many infections exhibit clinically meaningful stages, such as a latent period or post-infectious period of temporary immunity; and some infections (e.g. HIV) are commonly modelled as comprising multiple stages of infection. Further, in fitting to data it seems reasonable to estimate a small number of infectivity parameters, whereas to estimate an continuously varying infectivity function would present a much greater challenge.",

We will allow for heterogeneity by stratifying the population into a finite number of groups.

Further suppose that the lifetime L is constant and the infection is of SI type, so T 1 = \u221e. We then find that R 0 = 1.59. With these assumptions there is thus a substantial discrepancy between R 0 and R e 0 . For an unmanaged population, a constant lifetime does not seem so plausible. Consider the UK life tables for 2011 -13 [34] . Since the data are presented separately for males and females, for simple illustrative purposes we consider only the data for males. With this distribution for L, again for an SI infection with R e 0 = 2, we find R 0 = 1.61, so again we see a substantial difference between R 0 and R e 0 . On the other hand, for an SIR infection with non-random (for simplicity) infectious period T I = 1 year we find R 0 = 1.99. That is, the difference between the values of R 0 and R e 0 is now essentially negligible. The above numerical examples illustrate the point that if the value of s * is observed (or estimated from data), then whereas R e 0 = 1/s * may be immediately estimated, to estimate R 0 requires further knowledge (or modelling assumptions) regarding the lifetime distribution L and the infectivity function A(\u00b7). Secure vaccination coverage requires that a proportion \u03c0 = 1 \u2212 (1/R 0 ) of the susceptible population be vaccinated, since this has the effect of reducing the basic reproduction number toR 0 = \u03c0 R 0 = 1. The relationship betwee\u00f1 R e 0 for the vaccinated population and the original R e 0 is considerably more complicated, since vaccination reduces the value of the infectious pressure \u03b8 , which affects the value of R e 0 , given by (12) , in a non-linear manner.",

The existence of super-spreaders has been proposed for a variety of infections, e.g. severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). Result (ii) shows that, under the assumption of exponentially distributed lifetimes, such heterogeneity in infectivity does not affect the endemic prevalence level. Intuitively, if all uninfected individuals have equal susceptibility, then whenever an infectious contact occurs it is equally likely to be directed towards any individual in the population, so that in equilibrium the infected proportion will be the same in every group (and consequently equal to the homogeneous population value). For more general heterogeneous structures, however, numerical examples such as those in Fig. 3 of [4] show that the endemic prevalence level can be very different from that of a homogeneous population. This is in line with the well-known observation (e.g. Section 10 of [23] ) that such social heterogeneities can greatly affect epidemic final size, for a given value of R 0 . For the separable case (iii), we have exhibited conditions under which the endemic level may be bounded (either above or below) by the homogeneous population value; case (iii) combines Theorems 8 and 9 of [4] , where full details of the proof may be found.",

            "text": "For homogeneous populations (Section 2), we have demonstrated two simple general principles. First of all, a balance condition: in order to maintain endemic equilibrium, the effective reproduction number R(t) (expected number of secondary cases caused by a typical primary case at time t) must remain constant at R(t) = 1. If individuals' lifetimes are exponentially distributed, then R(t) = R 0 s(t), giving the well-known endemic level formula s * = 1/R 0 . When lifetimes are not exponentially distributed, this formula must be modified to s * = 1/R e 0 , with R e 0 defined to allow for the difference between the remaining lifespan of a typical newly-infected individual in endemic equilibrium, and that of a typical newly-infected individual in a wholly susceptible population. This contradicts the conclusion of [12] that ''the asymptotic behaviour of the models with distributed delays is the same as ... the ordinary differential equation models'', because their analysis was based throughout upon the assumption that individuals' lifetimes are exponentially distributed. In practice, the difference between R e 0 and R 0 may not be great, in particular if the infection is endemic at a low level, and so has little effect upon the age-distribution of the susceptible part of the population, or if the infectious period is sufficiently short that the chance of natural death during the infectious period may be neglected (note that it has been previously remarked, in Proposition 5.2 of [16] , that R 0 \u2248 1/s * provided E[L] is short enough). Consequently, for many infectious diseases of humans, our result may be interpreted as demonstrating the robustness of the formula s * = 1/R 0 , which would be expected to provide a very good approximation. This is confirmed by a numerical example in Section 2 above, in which we deliberately took a high proportion (50%) of the population to be infected, and a long infectious period (1 year), and even under these circumstances found a negligible difference between R 0 and R e 0 . On the other hand, for livestock infections which do not necessarily cause serious symptoms in the livestock but do carry a risk of food poisoning to humans (e.g. Campylobacter in poultry, and Salmonella in pigs), the infectious period may be a substantial fraction of the individual's lifetime, and the difference between R 0 and R e 0 may be significant. Similarly, for some infections of humans the duration of infection can be of the same order as the human lifespan, as for instance in the case of Tuberculosis. The impact of a realistic lifetime distribution upon the behaviour of a Tuberculosis model has recently been studied in [2] .",

            "text": "We have not considered dynamical behaviour of the process, and in particular stability of the endemic equilibrium point. The usual situation to be expected is that for R 0 \u2264 1, the only feasible equilibrium point is the disease-free equilibrium, and this point is globally asymptotically stable; for R 0 > 1, there also exists a unique feasible non-zero equilibrium point, the endemic equilibrium, and this point is globally asymptotically stable. However, there are infection models for which the situation is more complicated, see for instance [6] . It is important to note here that for biologically plausible population sizes, any deterministic model should be regarded as a crude first approximation to a more realistic stochastic formulation, and in stochastic formulations eventual disease extinction typically occurs with probability 1, whatever the value of R 0 . Nevertheless, deterministic stability analysis provides valuable information. If the endemic equilib-rium point is globally asymptotically stable, this can be interpreted as meaning that provided the infection succeeds in infecting a significant proportion of the population, then it is likely to persist in a state close to the deterministic endemic equilibrium for a long time before stochastic fluctuations lead to eventual extinction. A full stability analysis of our most general model seems challenging. Key existing results include those of [1, 15] for a homogeneous population, and of [21, 22] for heterogeneous populations. The models of [1, 15] differ from our model of Section 2 in that recruitment into the population occurs at constant rate, and no distinction is made between stages of infection but rather a general infectivity function A(u) is used. Proposition 6.3 of [15] gives sufficient conditions for local asymptotic stability of the endemic equilibrium point. For the case of exponentially distributed lifetimes L, it is shown in [1] that the endemic equilibrium point is locally asymptotically stable for R 0 > 1. Whether this is the case for more general lifetime distributions is left as an open problem. Similarly, [21] provides a full global stability analysis for a multigroup SIS model with exponentially distributed lifetimes and exponentially distributed infectious periods, while [22] gives corresponding results for a multigroup SEIR model with exponentially distributed lifetimes and general latent and infectious period distributions.",

            "text": "There are a number of obvious extensions of our model that could be considered. First of all, consider the infection process. For a population containing S susceptible and I infective individuals, we have assumed that new infections arise at average rate \u03b2SI. A variety of alternative infection rate functions \u03b2(S, I) have been proposed in the literature ( [3] and references therein). In particular, a popular formulation is that new infections arise at rate \u03b2SI/P, where P(t) is the current population size. Our results remain valid for any infection rate function of the form \u03b2(P)SI where \u03b2(\u00b7) is a positive function of population size, since we have looked only at populations in demographic equilibrium, i.e. with P(t) remaining constant. Secondly, we have assumed no disease-induced mortality. Denoting by P * 0 the population level in demographic equilibrium in the absence of infection, and by P * the population level in endemic equilibrium, then one would expect disease-induced mortality to imply that P * < P * 0 . One would anticipate that Eq. (13) will remain valid, except that now s * , i * 1 , . . . , i * n represent proportions of a population of size P * , rather than P * 0 . Finding the level P * in terms of basic parameters of the model seems likely to be challenging, since the level depends upon the interaction between demographic and infection processes. A third possible extension would be to allow an individual's susceptibility to depend upon their age, or for infected life histories T and infectivity parameters \u03b2 (j) to depend upon the age at which the individual became infected. In particular, so-called 'childhood infections' such as measles, mumps, chicken pox, etc. can display rather different symptoms in adults than in children. If susceptibility and the progression of infection are allowed to depend upon the age at infection, these factors will contribute to the distinction between R 0 and R e 0 . In heterogeneous populations, it becomes more difficult to apply our general balance condition, because precisely what is meant by a 'typical' primary case becomes more complicated. Our ergodictype result for the proportions in various infected stages remains valid (Eq. (18)), but evaluating the susceptible proportions s * g is not straightforward, and we were obliged to restrict to exponentially distributed lifetimes. In this case, we see that if heterogeneity is only in infectiousness, or under a more general symmetry condition (that the columns of FM (0) F \u22121 all sum to the same value), then the formula s * = 1/R 0 remains valid. In general, however, this is not the case, and instead we have exhibited conditions under which the susceptible proportion may be bounded (either above or below) by 1/R 0 . Establishing existence and uniqueness of a non-zero solution to Eq. (19) for non-exponentially distributed lifetimes L remains an important open problem. Finally, in dealing with heterogeneous populations we assumed that lifetimes L and infectious life histories T are identically distributed across all groups. This assumption was made to avoid overly cumbersome notation, and is not unreasonable if the groups represent spatially distinct groupings of an otherwise homogeneous population. If groups represent categories such as male and female, or different species (e.g. humans and mosquitoes), then this assumption would need to be relaxed.",

Since we have assumed the matrix M (0) is irreducible, it follows that the matrix C(\u03be) with entries c gh (\u03be g ) is irreducible for any \u03be = (\u03be 1 , \u03be 2 , . . . , \u03be k ) \u2265 0 (the inequality to be interpreted elementwise). For \u03be \u2265 0, denote by \u03c1(\u03be) the dominant eigenvalue of the matrix with elements f g c gh (\u03be g )/E[L]. It follows from the Perron-Frobenius theorem for irreducible matrices (Theorem 1.5 of [29] ) that if 0 \u2264 \u03be 1 \u2264 \u03be 2 with \u03be 1 = \u03be 2 then \u03c1(\u03be 2 ) < \u03c1(\u03be 1 ). Now \u03c1(0) = R 0 , and so if R 0 \u2264 1 then \u03c1(\u03be) < 1 for every non-zero \u03be \u2265 0. Consequently for R 0 \u2264 1 the disease-free equilibrium provides the only solution of Eq. (19) .",
