We compared burden and severity of seasonal and pandemic strains. We weighted analyses to the age and regional structure of England to give nationally representative estimates. We compared symptom profi les over the fi rst week of illness for diff erent strains of PCR-confi rmed infl uenza and non-infl uenza viruses using ordinal logistic regression with symptom severity grade as the outcome variable.

These fi gures did not diff er signifi cantly when comparing pandemic with seasonal infl uenza. Of PCR-confi rmed cases, people infected with the 2009 pandemic strain had markedly less severe symptoms than those infected with seasonal H3N2.",

            "text": "Infl uenza causes roughly 250 000-500 000 deaths worldwide each year. 1 In the 20th century there were three infl uenza pandemics for which there are varying mortality estimates: 1918 A/H1N1 at least 20-40 million excess deaths, 1957 A/H2N2 about 4 million excess deaths, and 1968 A/H3N2 about 2 million excess deaths. [2] [3] [4] In 2009 a new pandemic virus, 5 infl uenza A(H1N1)pdm09, emerged in Mexico 6 and spread globally over 2009-10, causing an estimated 200 000 respiratory deaths and 83 000 cardiovascular deaths during the fi rst 12 months of circulation. 7 WHO declared an end to the pandemic on Aug 10, 2010. 8 However, a further pandemic wave occurred in some European and other countries outside North America 9 in 2010-11 with reports of excess deaths in, for example, England. 10 Internationally, infl uenza activity surveillance provides real-time information to inform prevention and control policy. 11 Surveillance focuses on cases seeking medical attention: the so-called tip of the iceberg of infection. Underestimation of the number of community cases leads to overestimates of severity. 12, 13 Heightened concern during a pandemic can change patient consultation thresholds and clinician recording and investigation behaviour, thus distorting surveillance information. 14 Information on the community burden of infl uenza is key to informing control, 15 but is not routinely collected. For example, infl uenza transmission models, which are widely used to consider the effi cacy and cost-eff ectiveness of vaccines, antivirals, and non-pharmaceutical counter measures, depend on valid epidemiological estimates of the community occurrence of disease. The available data for periods of seasonal infl uenza are largely derived historically from household cohort studies of families with children in communities in the USA between 1948 and 1981, [16] [17] [18] [19] and a more recent study from rural Vietnam. 20 There have also been some cohort studies reporting on the 2009 pandemic from Hong Kong, southeast Asia, and Mali 21-25 as well as several cross-sectional serosurveys from this period. 26 Case-ascertained household transmission studies can estimate the secondary attack proportion and eff ects of interventions within households; however, they are not designed to estimate community burden of infl uenza infection and disease. 27, 28 The Flu Watch study is the fi rst national community cohort study of infl uenza occurrence enrolling households with and without children, with the additional benefi t of modern molecular diagnostic techniques.",

Admissions to hospital and deaths during follow-up were recorded with the end of season follow-up questionnaire completed by the lead householder, with deaths among participants also being reported to the study by participating practices and directly by families. We minimised recall bias of illness through weekly telephone or online surveys to record any \"cough, cold, sore throat, or fl u-like illness\" among household members. In addition to weekly surveys, participants were asked to complete detailed daily symptom diaries for the duration of any acute respiratory illness, including daily temperature measurement and reporting of several symptoms: feeling feverish, headache, having muscle aches, cough, sore throat, runny nose, blocked nose, and sneezing. Symptoms were allocated a numerical score on the basis of severity (0=absent, 1=mild, 2=moderate, 3=severe or for fever <37\u00b78\u00b0C=0, 37\u00b78-38\u00b79\u00b0C=1, 39\u00b70-39\u00b79\u00b0C=2, \u226540\u00b0C=3). Review of participants' primary-care records was used to measure consultation behaviour in practices where a research nurse was available to extract the data. We asked participants to submit, by mail, nasal swabs on day 2 of any illness. These swabs were transported in viral transport medium and screened by RT-PCR for infl uenza A (subtypes H1, H3), infl uenza B, infl uenza A(H1N1)pdm09 (from 2009 onwards), and a panel of other respiratory viruses including respiratory syncytial virus, rhinovirus, coronavirus, adenovirus, human metapneumovirus, and parainfl uenza virus with methods described elsewhere. 30, 31 We measured serum antibody titres against circulating infl uenza strains (appendix) in baseline and follow-up samples with haemagglutination inhibition assay using standard methods. 32, 33 Outcomes Key outcomes of interest were infection with infl uenza, defi ned as a four-fold titre rise in serum samples of unvaccinated individuals (but not in vaccinated individuals since both vaccination and natural infection lead to titre rises); occurrence of any acute respiratory illness (selfreported \"cough, cold, sore throat, or fl u-like illness\"); occurrence of infl uenza-like illness, defi ned according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) defi nition of fever (temperature \u226537\u00b78\u00b0C) and a cough or a sore throat in the absence of a known cause other than infl uenza; 34 occurrence of PCR-confi rmed infl uenza; symptom severity over the fi rst week of illness in PCRconfi rmed cases; and consultation with primary care. During the pandemic additional outcomes included monitoring the development of immunity (defi ned as antibody titre to infl uenza A H1N1 pdm2009 of \u226532). In this analysis key predictors of interest are age, study year, and circulating strain of infl uenza. The study size was chosen to give accurate annual estimates of infection and disease rates such that a sample size of 800 per year would allow a 25% risk of infection to be estimated within 95% CIs of 22-25 and a 10% risk of infl uenza-like illness within 95% CIs of 8-12. The study was expanded in the pandemic to provide accurate real-time measures of infl uenza-like illness rates recruiting as many participants as was practically possible.",

Nasal swabs have similar sensitivity to the gold-standard nasopharyngeal aspirates. 37,38 Self-taken swabs have similar sensitivity to those taken by health-care workers. 39 The extent of postal delay is not associated with likelihood of PCR positivity for infl uenza. 40 After adjusting for time from symptom onset to swab date, a recent comparison showed similar levels of viral detection and viral load in primary-care samples from patients with infl uenza-like illness to those in postally submitted samples from patients consulting the National Pandemic Flu Service. 41 Because of the high level of completion of weekly illness status reports, adjusting our attributable rates for the recorded level of under-reporting made minimal diff erence to our conclusions on the proportion of infections leading to illness. The attributable-rate method might underestimate the proportion of infections leading to illness if having infl uenza reduces the risk of other respiratory infections through viral interference, 42 but we did not identify any evidence of this in our data.",

            "text": "After the high attack rates during the 2009-10 pandemic, WHO advised that the virus had largely run its course. 8 Despite this, a further wave of A(H1N1)pdm09 infection was noted across Europe in 2010-11. 9 In England this wave was associated with an upwards age shift in infected people admitted to hospital (median age 35 years during the 2010-11 winter compared with 20 years over the 2009-10 pandemic period) and pressure on intensive care. 43 We did not identify any evidence of increased symptom severity in the third wave, but there was a marked increase in the number of cases in young adults. This upwards age shift is probably explained by the fact that before this third wave, protective antibody titres were present in about threequarters of children, but only about a third of working-age adults. However, it remains unclear why young adults were not more aff ected during earlier waves. The higher numbers of deaths and admissions noted nationally during the pandemic third wave were therefore probably due to increased numbers of cases in young adults rather than, as reported by others, increased severity. 44 The occurrence of a third wave in the pandemic reinforces the value of investing in vaccine development even if vaccines are unlikely to be available suffi ciently early to alter the course of early waves. The proportion of serologically confi rmed infections that are asymptomatic is an often neglected variable, which is an important component of severity. Our fi nding that only 23% (95% CI 13-34) of infections are symptomatic is lower than is sometimes assumed, but is consistent with fi ndings from other studies of seasonal infl uenza 35 and human challenge studies. 45 Measurement of the proportion of serologically confi rmed infections that are asymptomatic should be an early priority for any emerging infection of pandemic potential. This provides an additional index of severity complementing population level data on admission to hospital and deaths. Our study was limited by our inability to identify virus shedding during asymptomatic infection because this would have needed frequent regular nasal swabbing throughout follow-up. Comparison of symptom profi les in community cases of an emerging infection with those noted with other viruses can also provide important information on severity, complementing population level data on numbers of admissions to hospital and deaths.",

Although A(H1N1) pdm09 infected most children and a high proportion of unvaccinated adults of all ages over three pandemic waves, infection and disease rates were similar to or lower than prepandemic periods. Symptoms due to infection with the 2009 pandemic strain were milder than those with seasonal infl uenza strains. Our fi ndings are consistent with the very low case-fatality rates recorded during the pandemic. Whereas overall, pandemic illnesses were mild there was a shift in the age distribution of deaths leading to an increase in years of life lost during the 2009 pandemic compared with some seasonal periods. 7 Despite its mild nature, the 2009 pandemic caused enormous international concern, expense, and disruption. We need to prepare for how to respond to both mild and severe pandemics. To do this we need more refi ned assessments of severity, including community studies to guide control measures early in the course of a pandemic and inform a proportionate response.",
