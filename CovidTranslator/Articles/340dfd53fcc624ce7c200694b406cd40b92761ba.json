On the other hand, this research offers managerial insight into how governments can be more accountable and better help citizens fulfill their responsibility using ICT-based health risk communication. Taken together, these efforts facilitate sustainable public health practices in the social media-based public governance era. Given the rapid proliferation and widespread use of social media by government agencies, this study illustrates which policy instruments and transformation strategies should be implemented both by the governed and those governing to enhance public accountability and the effective governance of health risk communication in this new ICT-driven governance ecosystem.",

Moreover, most of the Korean public health agencies and government healthcare organizations already heavily use social media platforms, apps, and networks as cost-effective and convenient means toward spreading information, practices, and solutions concerning personal and community health initiatives since the 2015 Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) outbreak in South Korea. Therefore, this locale and its government serve as the foundation for the present investigation into the design and implementation of effective, sustainable ICT practices using social media in the public health sector.",

As long as a service is called \"public\" and is provided by the government, like social media-based health information provision, it is accompanied by the concept of accountability, which assumes a \"principal-agent\" relationship. Although there are numerous definitions of accountability, we can generally agree, \"Accountability is about explanation and justification to a forum with the possibility of sanctions as a result\" (Hughes, 2012, p.187) . Accountability is the \"relationship between an actor and a forum, in which the actor has an obligation to explain and to justify his or her conduct, the forum can pose questions and pass judgment, and the actor may face consequences\" (Bovens, 2007) . Following this definition, the actor is an individual or organization, and the forum is individual or institution; the obligation is formal or informal, and the questions and judgment lead to either a negative or a positive consequence.",

It is closely akin to accountability or answerability,\" (p.7) and subjective responsibility as feeling responsible and behaving responsibly in a cultural and social context. Hughes (2012) differentiated between accountability and responsibility using organizational hierarchy. He argued that a staff member is accountable to a superior, whereas every superior is responsible for the actions of his or her subordinates. In sum, despite the various attempts to distinguish between accountability and responsibility, their differences are not always clear, and the two terms are often interchangeable. Still, the common argument on accountability prescribes the existence of at least two parties, in which one party expects the other to act beneficially and to not do something harmful (Hughes, 2012; Mulgan, 2000; O'Loughlin, 1990; Romzek & Dubnick, 1994; Saltzstein, 1992) .",

Among the four, public sector reform has placed great emphasis on professional and political accountability (Romzek, 2000) .

Specifically, \"collaborative governance\" is often referred to as a special form of the principal-agent relationship in which the government acts as the principal and private players (e.g., contractors or volunteers) act as the agent (Donahue & Zeckhauser, 2011) .

            "text": "In combining the discussion above of accountability and risk management, one can identify several challenges regarding citizen accountability in public health. The first challenge is the citizens' selfprotection. Every citizen is expected to have a sense of responsibility toward him-or herself, as well as toward the community; this responsibility should lead to health risk information-seeking behavior (Lee, Hoti, Hughes, & Emmerton, 2015; Medlock et al., 2015) . The second challenge is about the citizens' voice. Because of the externality of health problems, citizens usually shift the accountability of protecting themselves from health risks to their government. Furthermore, they want to (or should) keep interacting with their government to put their voices into policy (Barg et al., 2017; Li, Abelson, Giacomini, & Contandriopoulos, 2015) . The third challenge involves co-production between citizens and government. Citizens are increasingly becoming co-producers with their governments for public values (Alford, 2009) . When it comes to health risk communication using ICT, the citizens who use ICT media are expected to act (or be well prepared to act) as not only information recipients but also information producers or disseminators (Moorhead et al., 2013; Park, Reber, & Chon, 2016) . The fourth challenge concerns citizens' utilization of health-related services. No matter how good an ICT-based public service is, if citizens choose not to use it due to any number of reasons (e.g., ignorance, digital literacy, accessibility, service quality, trust, security concerns) the implementation of policy through this form of civic engagement would be far from successful.",

In other words, these variables allowed us to explore the answer to the question: How can government better facilitate citizen accountability for public health?

            "text": "A tendency to seek risk information may lower barriers to adopting innovation for risk management purposes, as information seeking serves as a coping strategy for risk reduction (Golant, 2017; ter Huurne, Griffin, & Gutteling, 2009 ). Previous scholars have found that more exposure to medical information and health-related training leads to information seeking using various sources (Hall, Bernhardt, & Dodd, 2015; Kelly, Sturm, Kemp, Holland, & Ferketich, 2009; Kim & Kwon, 2010) . Furthermore, those with more sources of information reported higher levels of self-reliance when making health-related decisions (Hall et al., 2015) . Information-seeking behavior is part of the effort to cope with information insufficiency, which positively influences the adoption of new communication technology (Golant, 2017) . In other words, individuals with a higher tendency to seek information are inclined to seek more sources of information and try a communication tool that best fits their need for efficient information acquisition. Thus, we posit the following hypothesis: H1. Individuals with higher tendencies to seek risk information will be more likely to use the government's social media sites for (a) obtaining risk information and (b) engaging in interactions with the government for risk preparation. Shareef et al. (2011) proposed the GAM theoretical approach to explain and predict the adoption behavior of e-government services. Based on GAM, the present study considers the perceived ease of use as a perceptual determinant of adoption. Perceived ease of use was originally referred to as the perceived ability to use by Shareef et al. (2011) , but its conceptualization and operationalization when focused on perceptions of e-government websites is best described in terms of T.D. Lee et al. Government Information Quarterly 36 (2019) 226-236 ease of use. Thus, this study uses the modified concept of perceived ease of use instead of Shareef et al.'s (2011) original description. The easier and more effortless people perceive the use of a new technology to be, the more likely they are to use it (Davis, 1989) . A positive relationship between perceived ease of use and adoption behavior is well documented in the literature (Hung, Tang, Chang, & Ke, 2009; Ozkan & Kanat, 2011; Wirtz, Piehler, & Daiser, 2015) . Perceived information quality and perceived functional benefit are key factors that lead users to adopt ICT-based government services. These two concepts imply that people who believe new technology will provide useful information and help them complete tasks efficiently tend to accept the technology and make use of it (Shareef et al., 2011) . Perceptions of usefulness, regarding information quality and task completion, have been reported to play a considerable role in the adoption of information technologies (Oliveira, Faria, Thomas, & Popovi\u010d, 2014; Ozkan & Kanat, 2011; Wirtz et al., 2015) . Another important aspect of ICT-based services that encourages adoption behavior is the security of a system. Perceived security refers to the degree to which users perceive that a technology ensures the security of personal information and uses their information appropriately (Shareef et al., 2011) . Problems related to user privacy are considerable barriers that hinder the success of new information technology (Gilbert, Balestrini, & Littleboy, 2004) . Thus, security provisions should be ensured for citizens considering the use of ICT-based government services (Bertot, Jaeger, & Hansen, 2012) . The perception that a technology is secure and safe to use relates positively to the usage of that technology (Shareef et al., 2011; Venkatesh, Chan, & Thong, 2012) . Based on the theoretical background and empirical evidence discussed above, we hypothesize:",

By adopting the conceptualization of the internet's self-efficacy established by Eastin and LaRose (2000) , this study defines social media competency as the degree to which a person is confident in his or her ability to perform tasks on social media required to meet given communication goals. Previous research suggests that higher levels of social media competency lead to increased perceptions of usefulness and ease of use with a new application (Cheng & Mitomo, 2017; Slade, Dwivedi, Piercy, & Williams, 2015) .

Therefore, a variety of digital government services and smart technologies on public safety and healthcare promotion are fully generalized in Korean society (Korea Institute for Health and Social Affairs, 2012; Rana et al., 2017) .

Obtaining information pertains more to one-way communication in which the government provides constant updates and relevant risk information using social media (e.g., progress on outbreak containment, availability of vaccines, and possible preventive measures) without receiving any feedback or inquiries from citizens. Interactions with the government describe the two-way communication that occurs through reciprocal dialogues such as commenting on social media posts, having live Twitter chats, and sending direct messages to ask and answer specific questions. Intentions to adopt information services were measured using three items, including \"To obtain information about health-related risks, I would use the government's social media sites\" (M = 3.19, SD = 0.72, \u03b1 = 0.93).

While government accountability involves legal, bureaucratic, political, and professional characteristics, citizen accountability centers on deliberative and participative features in the policy process and governance. In other words, fulfilling accountabilities of both parties are complementary to each other. Citizens' active engagement enables citizens not only to acquire information regarding health, wealth, and well-being that is necessary for situational awareness and informed decision-making, but also enables these citizens to provide the government with ample means for better policy design and a provision of appropriate public services (Donahue & Zeckhauser, 2011) . Civic accountability for engagement with the government represents one of the best ways to create a networked community in which citizens feel supported, included, and confident to work toward sustainable development (Orr, Prugh, Renner, Seyle, & King, 2014) . In this respect, this study has identified guiding principles and determining factors behind both government' and citizens' involvement in sustainable public health governance using ICT systems, specifically government social media sites used for health risk communication services.",

These findings indicate that understanding the user-oriented variables (e.g. social media competency and trust) and the system-oriented variables (e.g. perceptions of ICTbased government infrastructure and services) is important to facilitae the adoption of a government's digital services for health communication (Liu et al., 2014) . To this end, the primary role of public managers and policymakers is to keep pace with changes that are associated with sociological, psychological, and behavioral features of their end-users, and take these features into account in their ICT policies and e-government services.",

            "text": "Regarding public health risk communication, the government is required to incorporate these user characteristics, such as their technological competence, into the e-government platform. In a time of public health crisis, user-oriented functions may facilitate warning diffusion, situational awareness, informed dialogue, feedback loops, and remedial actions (Mergel, 2016; Zuiderwijk, Janssen, & Dwivedi, 2015) . This study also suggests that e-government practitioners can benefit from their digital communication platform by ensuring its timeliness, usefulness, easy-to-access features, and trustworthiness (Lin, Spence, Sellnow, & Lachlan, 2016; Savoldelli, Codagnone, & Misuraca, 2014) . Regarding the content, governments can identify the most suitable approaches to increase the usefulness of the messages and thereby mitigate public health risk by analyzing the types of information that citizens want or/and need, the preferred format, and the appropriate level of detail. Furthermore, it is important that such e-government services can prevent inaccurate, incomprehensible information, by monitoring the system and adopting filtering tools. As for social media channels, the public health risk communicators should engage in clear, balanced and beneficial approaches to deal with potential emotional responses of the public because social media is a personalized network with subjective norm-based communication infrastructures (Graham et al., 2015; Mergel, 2016) . Furthermore, our study highlights that the ICT competence level of target citizens is a crucial condition for the use of government social media services, which reveals the need to enhance the citizen's media literacy (Lallmahomed et al., 2017; Lin et al., 2011) . To this end, the government can develop various tools for public deliberation and participation, such as media literacy campaigns and project-based learning programs. Such policy measures and educational interventions can improve the overall level of informed preparedness and agile responsiveness of the citizens in case of health risk Ems, 2016) . In this regard, the government can fulfill sustainable health risk communication and management that is not only low-cost but also effective.",

South Korea is also known for its hierarchical government communication structure, as well as its previous experiences regarding the health risks and the influence an outbreak can have on citizens' perceptions and actions toward government information and services during public health emergencies. Moreover, with their relatively high level of social media competency, the citizens of South Korea are cultivated to be the major users of government social media channels, (Kim, Yoon, & Jung, 2017) .

The results indicate that individuals with higher social media competency are more likely to seek risk information through social media and are more likely to perceive the government's social media sites as easy to use. Our findings confirm that, with regards to the GAM, citizens' intentions to use these services increases if the services are perceived as more valuable.
