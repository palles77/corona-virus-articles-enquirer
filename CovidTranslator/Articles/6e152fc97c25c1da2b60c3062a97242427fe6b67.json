Remarkably, the CJ 24 inoculated-macaques developed mild interstitial pneumonia and viral load was 25 detectable in the conjunctival swabs at 1 days post-inoculation (dpi). Only via IT 26 inoculation, viral load was detected in the anal swab at 1-7 dpi and macaque showed 27 weight loss. However, viral load was undetectable after IG inoculation. Comparatively, 28 viral load was higher in the nasolacrimal system but lesions of lung were relatively 29 mild and local via CJ inoculation compared with that via IT inoculation, 30 demonstrating distinct characteristics of virus dispersion.

A previous study reported the case of a 41 clinician who was infected with SARS-CoV-2 while working with patients under all 42 safeguards except eye protection 3 . By contrast, no SARS-CoV-2 could be detected by 43 RT-PCR in 114 conjunctival swabs samples from patients with COVID-19 pneumonia . The potential extra-respiratory portals that SARS-CoV-2 enter the host need to be 45 further research by laboratory-confirmation for providing significant data to oversight 46 and prevention for healthcare workers. We daily observed the macaques for clinical signs. There was no significant change in 56 the body weight ( Figure 2A ) in the CJ and IG inoculated macaques and the 57 temperature ( Figure 2B ) in all the inoculated macaques, while the weight loss was 58 obvious in the IT inoculated macaques and dropped about 125 g at 5 dpi. Routine 59 specimens, including nasal and throat swabs, were collected on 0, 1, 3, 5, and 7-day 60 post-inoculation (dpi). Additionally, to explore the potentially excretory routes of 61 SARS-CoV-2 in the host, the conjunctival and anal swabs were also gathered. 62 author/funder. All rights reserved.

The distinct distributions of viruses by different95    inoculation routes were consistent with the anatomical structure, suggesting that the 96 dispersion of SARS-CoV-2 into the host associated with the infection route.97    Furthermore, viruses were detectable in different segments of the alimentary canal98    and some lymphatic tissues via both inoculation routes revealing that they may play 99 important roles in the spread of the virus within the host 5 . There were no significant 100 histopathological changes in IG-1. Furthermore, the specific IgG antibody against 101 SARS-CoV-2 was detectable in the CJ-2 at 14 and 21 dpi compared to before 102 infection proofing that the animal was infected with SARS-CoV-2 (Figure 2E).103 104 Meanwhile, comparison with prior to infection (day 0), the chest radiographs from 105 CJ-1 revealed obscure lung markings and opaque glass sign in the bilateral obscure lung markings, marked ground-glass opacities, obscures costophrenic 109 angle in the bilateral lobes of the lung, and patchy lesions in the right lower lobe of 110 the lung (Figure 3A). Consistent with the radiographic alteration, microscopically, 111 local lesions in the lungs from the CJ-1 displayed mild interstitial pneumonia 112 characterized by widened alveolar interstitium, infiltration of inflammatory cells 113 primarily including lymphocytes and monocytes, a small amount of exudation in the 114 alveolar cavities (Figure 3B). Virus antigen was further confirmed by the 115 SARS-CoV-2-specific antibody via immunohistochemistry (IHC) stain. In the 116 damaged lobe of lungs, SARS-CoV-2 was predominantly observed in the alveolar 117 epithelium and exfoliated-degenerative cellular debris in the alveolar cavities (Figure 118 3B) both in CJ-1 and IT-1. Notably, the results of IHC were highly in accordance with 119 the data of viral load detection on 7 dpi both in the CJ-1 and IT-1. Specifically, viral 120 antigens were scattered in several cells in the nasolacrimal system via conjunctival 121 inoculation, while they were more prominent in the trachea via intratracheal 122 inoculation (Figure 4). Moreover, viral antigen was obviously observed in the lamina 123 propria of alimentary tract suggesting that the virus may spread from the initial entry 124 to gut-associated lymphoid tissue (Supplementary Figure 1), and they were relatively 125 slight detected in the kidney, myocardium, and liver in IT-1 but undetectable in CJ-1. 126 (Supplementary Figure 2). Briefly, animal inoculated via conjunctival route gave 127 evidence of relatively mild and local interstitial pneumonia compared to demonstrated that macaques can be infected with SARS-CoV-2 via the 133 conjunctival route rather than the intragastric route. Compared to the intratracheal 134 route, viral load was comparatively high in the nasolacrimal system and lesions in the 135 lung were relatively mild and local via the conjunctival route. Similarly, rhesus monkeys via a single route via conjunctiva, intra-stomach, or 140 intra-trachea, to avoid multiple routes of co-inoculation for confirming the exact 141 pathway of inoculation. These results suggest that conjunctiva is a potential portal for 142 viral transmission. In our results, viral load was detectable in several nasolacrimal 143 system associated-tissues, especially in the conjunctiva, lacrimal gland, nasal cavity 144 and throat, which drew the outline of the anatomical bridge between ocular and 145 respiratory tissues. Particularly, the lacrimal duct functions as a conduit to collect and 146 transport tear fluid from the ocular surface to the nasal-inferior meatus, being 147 convenient for the drainage of virus from ocular to respiratory tract tissues. Actually, 148 the previous report had demonstrated that although virus-containing fluid can be taken 149 up through the conjunctiva, sclera, or cornea, the majority of liquid including tear also possible to contribute to the absorption of tear fluid. Our results 152 were highly consistent with the anatomical features that viruses enter the host via the 153 conjunctival route. On the other hand, previous research demonstrated that 154 SARS-CoV was undetectable in cynomolgus monkeys after intragastric inoculation 155 which consistent with our result. At present, still, no evidence could prove that 156 SARS-CoV-2 can transmission via fecal-oral route 5 , although viral RNA of 157 SARS-CoV-2 was prolonged detectable in fecal samples from patients 6 and in have the capability to stimulate ocular complications in infected 161 patients, which then leads to respiratory infection 7 . The fact that exposed mucous 162 membranes and unprotected eyes increased the risk of SARS-CoV 1 or SARS-CoV-2 2 163 transmission suggests that healthcare professionals need to increase the awareness of 164 eye protection in close contact with the patients or in crowded places. used to complete all the experiments with rhesus macaques.
