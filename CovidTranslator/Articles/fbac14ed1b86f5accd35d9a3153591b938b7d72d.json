In eastern and northern Asia, South Korea and Russia were also reported to be affected (2) (Figure) . The epidemic affected not only large commercial farms but also the backyard industry, which created a serious problem for the global swine industry and for food safety. In February 2011, the Veterinary and Animal Breeding Agency in Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia, confi rmed an outbreak of porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS) (3) . Nearby neighbors, such as Japan, North Korea, Indonesia, and other Asia-Pacifi c countries, are also at risk.",

In 2006, a new, highly pathogenic PRRS emerged, characterized by high fever (41\u00b0C-42\u00b0C), skin discoloration/ reddening, high incidence of illness (50%-100%), and high proportion of deaths (20%-100%) in pigs of all ages. This new PRRS has spread throughout the swine industry in China, resulting in the culling of an estimated 20 million pigs annually in 2006-2007 in China (4). PRRSV is a member of the family Arteriviridae in the order Nidovirales, which also includes severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus.",
