However, the primary location of donor specific alloantibody (DSA) producing cells after transplantation have not been identified. The purpose of this study was to test the contribution of allospecific antibody secreting cells (ASCs) from different anatomical compartments in a mouse transplantation model. Fully MHC-mismatched heart allografts were transplanted into three groups of recipients: non-sensitized wild type, alloantigen-sensitized wild type and CCR5 \u2212/\u2212 mice that have exaggerated alloantibody responses. We found that previous sensitization to donor alloantigens resulted in the development of anti-donor alloantibody (alloAb) with accelerated kinetics. Nevertheless, the numbers of alloantibody secreting cells and the serum titers of anti-donor IgG alloantibody were equivalent in sensitized and non-sensitized recipients six weeks after transplantation. Regardless of recipient sensitization status, the spleen contained higher numbers of donor-reactive ASCs than bone marrow at days 7-21 after transplantation. Furthermore, individual spleen ASCs produced more anti-donor IgG alloantibody than bone marrow ASCs. Taken together, our results indicate that the spleen rather than bone marrow is the major source of donor-reactive alloAb early after transplantation in both sensitized and nonsensitized recipients.",

Activated B cells then can either develop into short-lived plasma cells (PCs) that secrete low affinity antibodies, or enter into the germinal center reaction driven by a specialized subset of follicular helper T cells (7) . After proliferation, somatic hypermutation, affinity maturation and isotype switching, germinal center B cells can differentiate into long-lived PCs or memory B cells (8, 9) . Long-lived PCs either migrate back to the BM or remain in the spleen or lymph nodes. These non-dividing cells continually secrete antibodies in the absence of antigen and increase antibody production in response to specific cytokines (10, 11) .",

Current information on the role of ASCs from various anatomical compartments is predominantly derived from various models of infection and immunization (11) . Isotype-switched ASCs can be detected in lymphoid organs draining infection sites as early as several days after infection. The early peak in spleen and lymph node ASCs is followed by a gradual decline, while antigen-specific ASCs in the BM increase during this time and typically reach a plateau 3-4 weeks after infection coinciding with the presence of high serum antibody titers (14) (15) (16) (17) . Therefore, it is generally believed that BM ASCs are responsible for maintaining anti-viral serum antibody levels and protection following reinfection. In addition, antigen-specific ASCs have been detected in non-lymphoid tissues following inflammation. Thus, during infections of the central nervous system (CNS), virusspecific ASCs accumulate within the CNS where they play a local protective role (18) (19) (20) (21) . In a murine model of influenza, viral antigen-specific ACSs within the lung have been observed to persist longer compared to those in the spleen (22) . Chronic inflammation can also lead to the formation of ectopic lymphoid follicles containing long-lived ASCs such as those detected in the meninges of multiple sclerosis patients (23) .",

The current concept of alloantibody production after transplantation has been recently summarized by Stegall et al (24) . In particular, due to the low frequencies of alloreactive ASCs and a paucity of assays to identify these cells, considerable gaps remain in identifying the locations of alloantibody producing cells and their relative importance. It has been recently demonstrated that a PCenriched population of cells isolated from the BM of sensitized renal allograft candidates was able to produce alloantibodies in vitro with specificities identical to the alloantibodies found in serum (25) . However, it remains difficult to evaluate the relative importance of the BM alloantibody production as spleen and lymph node samples are generally not available from human subjects. Furthermore, the main source of alloreactive antibodies prior to versus following transplantation could be different in sensitized recipients.",

We show that regardless of sensitization status, ASCs from the spleen and graft-draining lymph nodes, rather than from the BM, are the main sources of donor-specific alloantibodies at early stages after transplantation. By 6 weeks after transplantation, the difference in allospecific antibody production between these anatomical compartments becomes less significant, and the magnitude of the anti-donor humoral response is not affected by the initial sensitization status of the recipient. We also investigated the mechanisms of the previously reported exaggerated DSA production in CCR5\u2212/\u2212 heart allografts recipients (26) (27) (28) . We demonstrate that while CCR5\u2212/\u2212 mice do not possess anti-donor T cell or humoral reactivity prior to transplantation, their response to allografts are similar to those in sensitized wild type (WT) recipients.",

The presence of donor-specific antibodies was evaluated by testing the ability of the culture supernatants to bind donor thymocytes. The binding MFI levels for spleen cell supernatants were higher in the sensitized than in non-sensitized group at days 7, 14 and 21 after transplantation. However, the binding of spleen cell supernatants from sensitized and non-sensitized recipients was comparable at 6 weeks post transplant ( Figure 3 ). The binding MFIs were significantly higher for the spleen compared to the BM supernatants in both sensitized and non-sensitized recipients (Figure 3 ). These findings were not due to the inferior survival of BM plasma cells during in vitro culture as B220 + CD138 + cells from spleen and BM demonstrated similar viability and apoptotic rates ( Figure S1 ). The differences between spleen and BM cell supernatants became less prominent at 6 weeks after transplantation.",

Performed prior to transplantation, splenectomy may reduce T and B cell alloresponses against the graft as well as decrease the numbers of plasmablasts and mature PCs. Interestingly, two groups have recently reported the successful use of splenectomy for the treatment of refractory antibody mediated renal allograft rejection in small groups of renal transplant patients (41, 42) . In both studies, the DSA or ABO antibody titers were decreased in all splenectomized recipients and resolution of antibody mediated rejection (AMR) has been achieved. These outcomes are consistent with our findings on the role of the spleen in the maintenance of DSA serum titers. However, it is possible that in some cases lymph node and/or BM can harbor sufficient numbers of ASCs to overcome the beneficial effects of splenectomy at later time points after transplantation.",

Previous studies on heterotopic cardiac allografts have demonstrated that donor dendritic cells migrate to the mediastinal lymph nodes and PCs expand at these sites within 1 week after transplantation (43, 44) . The current data indicate that mediastinal lymph nodes are a site of rapid and prolonged production of donor specific antibodies. Nevertheless, the relative size of mediastinal lymph nodes was modest compared to the spleen (5-10 \u00d7 10 6 versus 80-100 \u00d7 10 6 cells) and the numbers of lymph node ASCs were consistently lower than those observed in the spleen (Figures 5 and 8) , suggesting the more prominent contribution of the spleen in the generation and maintenance of cells producing serum alloantibodies. While the frequencies of alloantigen-specific ASCs were below the detection level in non-draining axillary, brachial and popliteal lymph nodes (data not shown), it can't be entirely ruled out that ASCs from other locations such as GALT may also contribute to alloantibody production after transplantation.",

While BM cells did not appear to secrete donor-reactive IgG2c and IgG1 at day 7 (Figure 3 ), they contained higher frequencies of total and donor MHC-reactive IgG producing cells (Figures 4A and 5A ) and produced antidonor IgG 2b ( Figure 3 ).

Heterotopic BALB/c heart transplants were placed into non-sensitized B6 mice or into sensitized B6 recipients four weeks after immunization with BALB/c alloantigens. Serum was collected on days 7, 14 and 21 and at six weeks post transplant, and the titers of BALB/ c-and third party-reactive alloAb were determined by cell binding assay. The titers of third party-reactive alloAb in all serum samples were < 45 for IgG2c and IgG2b and < 135 for IgG1 and IgG3. The results were compared using non-parametric Mann-Whitney test.
