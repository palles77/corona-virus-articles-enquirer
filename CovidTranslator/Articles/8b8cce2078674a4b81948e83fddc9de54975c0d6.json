In many instances, mouse models have improved our understanding of the human immune response to infection; however, when dealing with emerging zoonotic diseases, they may be of limited use. This is particularly the case when the model fails to reproduce the disease status that is seen in the natural reservoir, transmission species or human host. In this Review, we discuss how researchers are placing more emphasis on the study of the immune response to zoonotic infections in the natural reservoir hosts and spillover species. Such studies will not only lead to a greater understanding of how these infections induce variable disease and immune responses in distinct species but also offer important insights into the evolution of mammalian immune systems.",

Indeed, mice have become the traditional 'workhorse' for studying immunology because of their ease of handling, fast generation time and the ready availability of mouse-specific reagents 3 . However, for a better understanding of EIDs, the laboratory mouse may not be the most appropriate model. There are often many differences in the symptoms of disease between the natural, transmission and human hosts. Zoonotic infections often appear as asymptomatic and non-lethal in the natural reservoir host, but induce severe and potentially lethal disease in humans or other spillover hosts. Nevertheless, there are numerous factors that are likely to contribute to these differences, including anatomical, physiological, metabolic and behavioural traits, as well as how the immune systems of these hosts interact with the same disease agent.",

Since then, natural selection processes have driven the evolution of immune systems that show new levels of complexity but that also have variations on a common theme. For example, unconventional T cell receptors (TCRs) have been discovered in several species, including certain marsupial species, sharks and frogs. TCR\u03bc receptors in marsupials and new antigen receptor (NAR)-TCRs in sharks are unique TCR types that contain two variable domains, one of which has an antibody-like structure. Similarly, the African clawed frog (Xenopus laevis) uses a novel TCR type that contains an antibody-like variable domain [9] [10] [11] . These TCRs seem to have evolved convergently, suggesting that they might have as yet unrecognized roles in the immune responses of each of these species and might also exist in other species.",

In many cases, zoonotic infections that are pathogenic in humans can coexist with their natural host reservoirs in the absence of disease. This demonstrates the importance of this co-evolutionary relationship. Bats are one example of a group of mammals that has a long co-evolutionary history with the viruses that they harbour. Although infection with viruses such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus, Hendra virus and Ebola virus seems to result in little pathology in bats, the infection of other species often causes severe disease and has fatal consequences. Bats might have become able to coexist with viruses through the evolution of unique immune mechanisms associated with the control of viral replication. It has also been suggested that the severe pathology and disease that often occurs as a result of the spillover of viruses into other vertebrate hosts may result from the disturbance of this finely tuned interaction of viral proteins with their targets in host cells 13 . Understanding how bats and other natural reservoirs, such as birds, coexist with human pathogens could potentially lead to the discovery of immune mechanisms that control viral replication. These mechanisms could then eventually be used to develop disease control strategies in other species.",

Immunologists have obtained a detailed knowledge of immune responses to pathogens through the use of mouse models, which have been used to evaluate new vaccines and therapeutics. Although there are many similarities between the immune systems of mice and humans, there are also some key differences. For example, recent genomic studies on several inflammatory diseases have shown a lack of correlation in responses between mice and humans 14 . Furthermore, there are many examples of successful preclinical trials of immunomodulatory drugs or vaccines in mice that have failed to translate into successful clinical trials in humans [15] [16] [17] . One issue is that some of the phenotypic markers used to discriminate immune cell populations in mice are absent in humans, and some subpopulations of immune cells differ between humans and mice (reviewed in REF. 18 ). In addition, mouse and nonhuman primate models often incompletely reproduce human disease phenotypes, and these species are often resistant to infection with human-specific pathogens 18 . Researchers have circumvented this problem by the use of genetically modified or immunocompromised mice to allow the establishment of infection. Unfortunately, the results from such complex artificial systems have been difficult to interpret and translate",

Another example is the woodchuck: these animals are a good model for studying hepatitis B virus (HBV) because they can be infected by the woodchuck hepatitis virus (WHV), which is closely related to HBV. Natural infection of woodchucks by WHV produces chronic liver disease and primary hepatocellular carcinoma, which are similar to the diseases induced by HBV in humans (reviewed in REF. 26 ).

Understanding the differences between the immune systems of domesticated and wild animal hosts and comparing their immune systems to that of humans is crucial for unravelling the complex disease mechanisms that are involved in zoonotic infections (FIG. 2) . Furthermore, by studying the pathogen in its natural host we might be able to devise efficient control measures in that host, thereby disrupting the transmission of the pathogen to humans. This has important implications for predicting, preventing and controlling spillover events and for the development of novel therapeutics and diagnostics. One example is the case of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI). Waterfowl are natural hosts for avian influenza viruses, and after infection with HPAI they develop what seems to be a limited inflammatory response of the respiratory system, usually with little or no mortality. By contrast, in chickens and in humans, infection with HPAI viruses can induce a rapid and strong inflammatory response and high levels of cytokine production, often referred to as a cytokine storm 28 , and the infection can become systemic and induce severe disease symptoms [29] [30] [31] . Chickens are acutely susceptible to infection with H5N1 strains of HPAI, which typically cause death within 18-36 hours. Studying waterfowl, such as ducks, and comparing their immune responses to influenza virus with those of chickens might provide invaluable insights into the 'aberrant' immune reactions that occur in influenza virus spillover hosts, such as chickens, pigs and humans (FIG. 3) . Moreover, understanding the mechanisms by which some recent isolates of H5N1 viruses cause systemic disease and death in ducks 32 will help to identify the elements of the immune response that are involved in disease lethality.",

Nevertheless, studying immunity to zoonotic viruses in wildlife is complex. For example, the fact that infectious agents, such as henipaviruses and lyssaviruses, which cause lethal diseases in humans, can coexist peacefully with bats raises many questions. It is still unclear what role the bat immune system has in keeping these pathogens under control and in enabling host survival while allowing enough viral replication to facilitate the transmission of the virus to spillover hosts.

Microorganisms are classified into risk categories according to the hazard they pose to individuals and to communities, including livestock and the environment, and whether effective treatment and preventive measures are available. The World Health Organization (WHO) has recommended a four-tiered agent risk group classification system for laboratory work; each tier is linked to specified infrastructure and regulatory requirements, practices and procedures with the aim of ensuring the safety of research staff working with these agents, as well as the wider community (see the WHO Laboratory Biosafety Manual, Third Edition). Risk groups 3 and 4 encompass the most serious human and animal pathogens that cause severe disease for which prophylactic or therapeutic measures may not be available. More details on biocontainment laboratories are described in BOX 3. Animals such as bats and migratory water birds that serve as reservoir hosts for zoonotic pathogens are increasingly being studied in the field. These studies provide valuable information about disease distribution and transmission, in addition to informing preparedness and surveillance strategies for future pandemics. However, when the ecological relationship between host and disease agent is one of co-speciation, experimental studies in natural hosts will also be crucial for understanding virus replication, pathogenesis, transmission and persistence in animal populations. Similarly, on the occasion of spillover events and when the origin of the host-pathogen relationship is through dispersal, controlled infection studies in the relevant target species will at some point be required for the evaluation of",

Comparative analysis of these genomes can identify gene candidates for diseasesusceptibility or disease-resistance phenotypes. There are two basic approaches for identifying these candidates, both of which start by selecting two groups of species on the basis of the segregation of a particular phenotype -in this case, disease susceptibility or resistance during infection with zoonotic viruses. The first approach is to carry out high-throughput comparison of all genes across the two groups to identify features that cluster separately between the groups. The results of this type of analysis can then be subjected to categorical enrichment analysis (for example, gene ontology or pathway analysis 34 ) to highlight gene candidates that seem to be linked to the disease phenotype that is under investigation.

Another application with strong potential in this field is genomewide screening using RNAi (reviewed in REF. 35 ).

As perhaps a counterbalance, several genes involved in pathogen recognition Infection with H5N1 influenza virus can cause very different disease outcomes in different reservoir and spillover host species. Waterfowl, such as wild ducks, are the natural host for this virus and develop a limited inflammatory response that is associated with low levels of cytokine expression. Intermediate hosts, including mice, pigs and ferrets, are often used to study this infection and display mild to severe disease symptoms (depending on the H5N1 virus strain used) that are associated with increased levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines. By contrast, spillover hosts such as chickens and humans display a rapid and strong inflammatory response, often referred to as hypercytokinaemia (or cytokine storm) and the infection becomes systemic, causing severe disease symptoms and high mortality rates. and immune responses seem to be under positive selection in bats, suggesting that these genes may increase fitness 36 . Such genes include those encoding DNA-damage sensors, such as DNA-dependent protein kinase catalytic subunit (DNA-PKcs; also known as PRKDC) and X-ray repair cross-complementing protein 5 (XRCC5), which have recently been identified as part of a cytoplasmic microbial nucleic acid-sensing complex 42 . The nuclear factor-\u03baB (NF-\u03baB) family member REL is also under positive selection in bats and has multiple roles in the immune system (including the regulation of type I and type III IFN production (FIG. 4) ). Other immune genes under positive selection in bats include the genes encoding TLR7, NOD, LRR and pyrin-domaincontaining 3 (NLRP3) and mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase 7 (MAP3K7) 36 . NLRP3 has a role in the formation of inflammasomes and the induction of inflammation in response to infection. In vitro studies have identified several other key differences in the immune system of bats, although it is not yet clear which of these are related to disease outcome (reviewed in REF. 43 ).

Infection of both chickens 30 and humans 29 with H5N1 HPAI can lead to a severe inflammatory response that is associated with high levels of cytokine production (reviewed in REF. 28 ). This observed aberrant immune response has been suggested to be associated with H5N1 mortalities. An intriguing observation is that with H5N1 HPAI infection there is an observed increase in mortality for patients in the middle-age bracket, unlike seasonal influenza deaths, which are mostly confined to infants and the elderly. It has been suggested that infection with H5N1 may result in a more severe disease if the patient's immune system is robust 29 . With this in mind, a tantalizing explanation for the differences in disease outcomes between natural hosts and spillover hosts might be that natural hosts experience less immunopathology during infection or, more specifically, that they maintain a better balance between promoting virus clearance and inducing dangerous levels of inflammation. Therefore, identifying the factors that trigger immunopathological responses, such as an overly aggressive immune response, during zoonotic infections might enable targeted therapeutic intervention and better outcomes in cases of human disease. Comparative studies between natural hosts (that are resistant to disease) and spillover hosts (that are susceptible to disease) could be very informative in uncovering such potential differences.",

Research has shown that a major factor related to disease outcome is the ability to resolve the initial inflammatory response 44 . In the non-natural host (the macaque), SIV infection leads to chronic immune activation and progressive disease. By contrast, for the natural host of SIV (the mangabey), the innate immune response resolves within 4-8 weeks despite high levels of virus replication. This example illustrates one instance whereby immunopathology might be considered a major determinant of disease outcome.

The relevance of a lack of preexisting immunity became apparent as mortality and morbidity began to rise sharply in the 20-to 40-yearold age group 49 , whereas the older age group was associated with a lower infection risk 50 that was associated with a higher prevalence of pre-existing antibodies that cross-reacted with the 2009 H1N1 virus. The impact of a novel influenza virus arising from wildlife species was felt again in February 2013, when an avian-origin influenza virus emerged in Zhejiang, China, causing more than 130 reported human infections and 36 deaths. This virus seems to have emerged from the mixing of influenza viruses from several avian sources, including ducks and wild birds 51 . It was the first report of a H7N9 influenza virus infecting humans and was met with little preexisting immunity. Furthermore, vaccines against H7N9 influenza virus are predicted to be poorly immunogenic because there are few immunogenic T cell epitopes present on the H7 molecule compared with other haemagglutinin subtypes 52 . Despite this particular virus being highly pathogenic in humans, natural infections with H7N9 viruses in chickens, ducks and other birds are asymptomatic and elicit an immune response that can be detected serologically 53 . This is in stark contrast to the H5N1 and H7N7 viruses, where disease in humans was associated with a highly pathogenic phenotype in poultry 54 . The immunological component to this disease in birds suggests that further study of these emerging viruses in poultry and other bird species is required to understand factors influencing disease susceptibility and transmission.",

            "text": "The identification of key differences in immune pathways between susceptible and non-susceptible hosts might offer clues for the development of disease intervention strategies. As mentioned above, for HPAI infection, ducks and chickens represent natural and spillover hosts, respectively. Chickens have lost expression of the innate immune sensor retinoic acid-inducible protein I (RIG-I), which may be an important clue in explaining why they suffer close to 100% mortality from HPAI. Conversely, ducks (which have intact RIG-I expression) develop only mild symptoms in response to HPAI infection and usually survive. It has been shown that the transfection of duck RIG-I into chicken cells induced IFNB promoter activity and limited the replication of low and highly pathogenic avian influenza strains, suggesting a key role of RIG-I in the ability of ducks to be resistant to influenza-mediated disease 55 . Although it is not understood how the absence of RIG-I in chickens affects their response to other viral infections, it would nevertheless be of interest to generate transgenic chickens that express duck RIG-I and investigate whether these animals are less susceptible to disease following HPAI infection or, indeed, following infection with other viruses. Many of these genes are positively selected in both species (these encode proteins that are highlighted in green), whereas others have been positively selected in only one of the species (these encode proteins that are highlighted in red). Bat-specific differences in these genes include unique changes to the nuclear localization signals in p53 and the E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase MDM2. The impact of these changes on host-pathogen interactions is currently under investigation. The transcription factor REL (which is a member of the NF-\u03baB family) regulates many effector proteins of the innate immune system, including type I interferons (IFNs), and it also participates in the DNA damage response. The gene encoding REL is under positive selection in bats and contains unique amino acid changes that might affect the interaction of REL with inhibitor of NF-\u03baB (I\u03baB). DNA-dependent protein kinase catalytic subunit (DNA-PKcs) and Ku80 are crucial to the DNA damage response but also form a microbial DNA-sensing complex connected to the type I IFN system. The relationship between innate immunity and the DNA damage response is well established, and unique changes in this pathway in bats might influence the outcomes of viral infection. It was proposed that these differences might reflect adaptations to the increased oxidative metabolism that accompanied the evolution of flight in bats.

Targeted nucleases, such as transcription activatorlike effector nucleases (TALENs) 56 and nucleases of the clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) system 57 , have increased targeted gene mutation efficiency to near 100%. This technology has been used in model organisms including zebrafish 58-60 , mice 61 , rats 62 and pigs 63 . Using these technologies in other species will allow breakthroughs in functional genomic studies in natural reservoir and spillover species, such as ducks, bats and chickens, or in other model species, such as ferrets. This will provide the opportunity to test hypotheses of immune function and regulation in these species. The development of poultry that are less susceptible to H5N1 influenza virus is likely to help to reduce the environmental load of highly pathogenic virus and act to break the chain of infection from poultry to humans. It is hoped that the findings from immunological studies in reservoir hosts will translate to the development of therapeutics for humans and other animals. This would result in a substantial human health benefit by addressing the serious issues in those countries where these diseases are endemic.",
