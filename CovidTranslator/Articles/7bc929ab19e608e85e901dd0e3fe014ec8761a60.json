            "text": "There have been an increasing number of instances where occupants of a building have complained of a general feeling of being uncomfortable (Zweers et al. 1992; Mendell 1993) . These symptoms often appear to be flu like, however the symptoms usually disappear when people are away from the building. This phenomenon is appearing in the medical literature as a concept called \"sick building syndrome\" (Mendell and Smith 1990) . Sick building syndrome (SBS) is a term used to describe a collection of symptoms that have been associated with the indoor air quality of buildings. In Taiwan, there has been growing concern in the past decade over health complaints attributed to the so-called \"sick building.\" The reasons could be related to an increase in public awareness of health implications, and people spending more time in air-conditioned environments. Indoor air quality (IAQ) has begun to surface as an important issue that affects the comfort and health of people and even the productivity of office workers (Singh 1996) . Hotels, one type commercial buildings, are designed to provide high levels of comfort for guests; however, the thermal comfort and inadequate indoor air quality are often complaints (Bohdanowicz and Martinac 2002) . In addition, the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) broke out in a four-star hotel in Hong Kong has increased the public awareness to indoor air quality of hotels (Radun et al. 2003) . IAQ may become one of the important issues for hotel management, and audit methods and technologies should be established first in order to identify the indoor air problems. Some IAQ monitoring methods have been developed in Taiwan and most of them are applied to the office buildings and the hospital buildings. However, the IAQ monitoring approach that is suitable for the hotel buildings has not been developed. Hence, the purpose of this study is to develop the IAQ audit approach with portable equipments in order to establish a comprehensive IAQ profile of the hotel buildings. The data collected from this approach can be used to assess the air quality in the hotel buildings and to identify the indoor air problems. Consequently, the IAQ audit approach proposed here may be helpful for the hotel managers to reduce the health risk from hotel buildings and increase the comfort for guests.",

In the effort to minimize heat loss and maximize the efficiency of air-conditioning, the building's interior is closed off the outside as much as possible. However, the indoor air becomes stale as a result of the accumulation of pollutants such as excess dust, bacteria, and chemicals. The poor IAQ will make occupants uncomfortable and increase the risk of health. During the past few decades, various symptoms and illnesses have increasingly been attributed to non-industrial indoor environments. In general, unlike industrial or accidental exposures (high level), such exposures are very common and usually sustained. Problems associated with the indoor environment are a common environmental health issue that is faced by doctors and health practitioners. This sick building syndrome (SBS) has received much attention over the years, and as originally defined by the World Health Organization (WHO 1983) , refers to nonspecific symptoms including eye, nose, and throat irritation, mental fatigue, headaches, nausea, dizziness and skin irritation, which seemed to be linked to the indoor climate (Bholah et al. 2000) .",

Jantunen (2000) also concluded that an average man spends up to 90% of his time indoors including time spent at workplace, leisure places, and home.

Some of the common causes of indoor air problems giving rise to poor air quality are the presence of indoor sources of pollution; poorly designed, maintained or operated air-conditioning and mechanical ventilation (ACMV) systems; and uses of the building that were unplanned for what the building was designed or renovated. A ventilation system performs a vital role in the removal of pollutants originating in the air space. In addition, the performance of the mechanical ventilation system influences thermal comfort; for example, cold draughts can produce an unpleasant environment for the guests and the staff. Some studies have shown that ventilation systems in buildings are largely responsible for SBS such as Morey and Shattuck (1989) . These ventilation systems are either designed incorrectly or they are poorly maintained.",

However, inadequate air quality as well as the lack of air circulation is another frequent complaints (Teeters et al. 1995) .

The tracer gas was allowed to mix for 15 min to establish a uniform concentration in the air space. The Bruel & Kjaer (B&K) multi-gas sampler and analyzer are used to collect and analyze the concentration of tracer gas over time. The concentration-decay of the tracer-gas profile was analyzed to determine the air-exchange rate for the guest room.

This monitoring system comprises a photo-acoustic based gas analyzer connected to a multi-point sampler and controlled via proprietary software from a laptop computer. Since two equipments (the SHIBATA IES-2000 and the B&K multipoint analyzer) used here can monitor the real-time concentrations of CO 2 and CO at the same time, the monitoring data can be compared each other.",

This high level of formaldehyde may be due to the emission from the detergents and cleaning agents because the housekeepers always use such chemicals (containing formaldehyde) during eight to eleven clock in the morning. Epidemiological and clinical studies have shown that exposure to formaldehyde could induce sensitization of skin, irritation of eye, some allergic asthmatic syndromes and a variety of low-level symptoms (Sardinas et al. 1979; Dally et al. 1981; Garrett et al. 1999) .

            "text": "However, the hotel managers are used to care about the energy consumption of air-conditioning to reduce the operation cost and always pay little attention to the indoor air problems in the past. In addition, managers do not know how to implement IAQ audit. Hence, one feasible approach to indoor air quality audit for hotel management was proposed here to identify the problems associated with the indoor environment of the hotel buildings. This approach can also help hotels managers to find the optimal operation procedures, which can improve the indoor air quality without increasing energy consumption and other related costs. For example, the air temperature measured in this case study is too cold. When this problem has identified, managers can adjust the air temperature set to make tourists feel comfortable and also reduce the energy consumption in air-conditioning.",
