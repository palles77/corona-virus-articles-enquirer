The functions 36 of these non-coding regions are mediated by a combination of linear sequence and 37 structural elements. The capped 5' untranslated region (UTR) contains promoter 38 elements, translational regulatory sequences that modulate dependence on cellular 39 translation factors, and structures that help to avoid innate immune defenses. The 40 polyadenylated 3' UTR contains highly conserved sequence elements for viral 41 replication, binding sites for cellular miRNAs that determine cell tropism, host range, and 42 pathogenesis, and conserved binding regions for a cellular protein that influences viral 43 RNA stability. Nonetheless, there are additional conserved elements in non-coding 44 regions of the virus (e.g., the repeated sequence elements in the 3' UTR) whose function 45 remains obscure. Thus, key questions remain as to the function of these short yet 46 influential untranslated segments of alphavirus RNAs.",

Despite the 124 significant variation among diverse SF complex members, as manifested by the different 125 number of RSEs, each virus maintains relatively long 3' UTRs. However, the trend 126 towards UTR variability is not consistent as some alphaviruses, such as EEEV North 6 diverged from the East/Central/South African (ECSA) enzootic lineage about 100 years 137 ago, differs from the other two major CHIKV lineages in: (1) a duplication of DR3 and (2) 138 point mutations, duplications and replacements of the DR1 and DR2 regions, namely DR 139 (1+2).

Overall, 145 the evolution of the CHIKV 3' UTR is probably shaped by the fitness trade-offs between 146 mammalian and mosquito hosts. Reciprocal exchange of the 3' UTR of ECSA and 147 Asian strain and then competing each chimera with the wild-type (wt) viruses suggested 148 that, in either genetic backbone, the fitness of the Asian lineage 3' UTR is significantly 149 lower than that of its ancestor, the ECSA lineage 3' UTR, in both mammalian and 150 mosquito hosts. As with other studies examining the Asian genotype (Tsetsarkin et al., 151 2011), these findings suggest that a population bottleneck resulted from a founder effect 152 when CHIKV was introduced into Asia by an infected traveler (as has been detected 153 thousands of times since 2005 (Lanciotti et al., 2007; Panning et al., 2008)), resulting in 154 the fixation of a lower fitness Asian lineage 3' UTR with deletion of a fragment including 155 a copy of DR1 and DR2.

The AU dinucleotide at the very terminus of the 5' UTR is required for replication, 221 independent of its ability to base pair (Kulasegaran-Shylini et al., 2009a), and may be 222 needed for binding of the viral RdRp (nsP4) to the 3' end of the negative-sense strand 223 for initiation of plus-strand synthesis (Shirako et al., 2003). Accordingly, this sequence is 224 highly conserved in alphaviruses. Both the sequence and the thermodynamic stability of 225 the 5' stem structure regulate replication, as mutations that alter the thermodynamic 226 stability of the stem or change the sequence but not the stability of the stem compromise 227 replication (Kulasegaran-Shylini et al., 2009a). This suggests that host and viral factors 228 required for replication associate with the 5' UTR in both a sequence-and structure-229 dependent manner. Disruption of the native 5' UTRs of SINV and VEEV results in 230 emergence of pseudorevertant viruses containing AU rich sequences at the 5' terminus, 231 which restore replication efficiency (Gorchakov et al., 2004b; Kulasegaran-Shylini et al., 232 2009a). The addition of AU-rich sequences to the 5' terminus is mediated by the RdRp, 233 which also possesses a template-independent 3' terminal adenylyltransferase activity 234 (Rubach et al., 2009; Tomar et al., 2006). The revertants containing AU-rich sequences 235 may arise from either the adenylyltransferase or error-prone polymerase activity of nsP4, 236 or the synergistic activity of both (Kulasegaran-Shylini et al., 2009a). Although the 237 precise role of 5' UTR sequence and structure in RNA synthesis is not fully understood, 238 its motifs are important for the coordinated recruitment of viral and host factors required 239 for replication, as mutations in the 5' UTR often give rise to compensatory mutations 240 within the viral replicase proteins (nsPs) that alter binding of host factors to the UTR 241 (Berben-Bloemheuvel et al., 1992; Castello et al., 2006; Pardigon et al., 1993; Pardigon 242 and Strauss, 1992; Shirako et al., 2003).",

Incompatibility of the SFV 5' UTR 248 with the SINV 3' UTR explains this observation, as interaction between the 5' UTR and a 249 19-nucleotide conserved sequence element in the 3' UTR is required for negative strand 250 synthesis (Frolov et al., 2001). 5' UTR and 3' UTR incompatibility among different 251 alphaviruses also is suggested by replication experiments with VEEV/SINV and 252 EEEV/SINV chimeric viruses, which encode nsPs and structural proteins of heterologous 253 alphaviruses but contain 5' UTR and 3' UTR sequences derived from the same virus 254 (Garmashova et al., 2007; Petrakova et al., 2005).

This mutation reduces infectivity of VEEV both in vitro and in vivo, but not in 266 cells or animals deficient in the receptor for type I interferon (IFN) (Spotts et al., 1998; 267 White et al., 2001). Sequence deletions and point mutations at nucleotides 5 and 8 268 within the 5' UTR of SINV, and analogous point mutations at positions 21, 35, and 42 269 within the 5' UTR of SFV also alter pathogenicity and neurovirulence in rodents (Klimstra 270 et al., 1999; Kobiler et al., 1999; Kuhn et al., 1992; Logue et al., 2008). Recently, it was 271 demonstrated that attenuating mutations in the 5' UTR of VEEV and SINV increase the 272 association of viral RNA with Ifit1, an IFN-stimulated gene that recognizes and restricts 273 translation of non-self RNA (Hyde et al., 2014). Ifit1 is up-regulated rapidly and to high 274 levels following type I IFN treatment or viral infection, and preferentially recognizes Cap 275 0 RNA transcripts which lack 2'-O-methylation of the penultimate nucleotide present in 276 Cap 1 structures. To overcome Ifit1 restriction of non-2'-O-methylated mRNA, many 277 cytoplasmic viruses generate Cap 1 structures on their mRNA by encoding their own 278 viral 2'-O-methyltransferases (e.g., Flaviviruses, Coronaviruses, Poxviruses), snatching 279 caps from host mRNA (e.g., Orthomyxoviruses and Bunyaviruses), or utilizing cap-280 independent translation (e.g. Picornaviruses, Caliciviruses, and hepatitis C virus) 281 (reviewed in Diamond, 2014). Viruses encoding a mutated non-functional 2'-O-282 methyltransferase are restricted in vitro and in vivo, but not in Ifit1 -/cells and animals 283 (Daffis et al., 2010; Kimura et al., 2013; Menachery et al., 2014; Szretter et al., 2012; 284 Zust et al., 2011). Alphaviruses are unique in that they are relatively resistant to Ifit1-285 mediated inhibition, despite possessing Cap 0 genomic and subgenomic mRNA and 286 utilizing cap-dependent translation.

Knowledge gaps and future directions in 5' UTR structure/function 295 In summary, the 5' UTRs of alphavirus RNAs have major roles in promoter 296 function, translational initiation, translational shut-off and avoidance of cellular innate 297 immune mechanisms. This is an impressive feat for a very short (85 bases or less in 298 different alphaviruses) untranslated region. Given this complexity of function, numerous 299 questions remain for future investigation. What is the full array of cellular factors that 300 interact with the alphavirus genomic and subgenomic 5' UTRs and do they change as 301 infection progresses? As it is clear that structure as well as sequence influences 5' UTR 302 function, what structure(s) are formed by the alphavirus 5' UTR in the environment of the 303 infected cell. Approaches such as dimethyl sulfate-based mapping of RNA structure in 304 living cells (Rouskin et al., 2014) may prove valuable for such studies. These structural 305 findings could then be integrated with protein-RNA interaction studies and the analysis of 306 directed mutations to provide a detailed structure-function relationship of regions of the 307 5' UTR with translational initiation factors and other cellular proteins. Whether 308 interaction with the abundant viral 5' UTR also usurps the natural function of these 309 cellular proteins, perhaps by 'sponging', as has been inferred for translation factors by 310 the 5' UTR of the subgenomic RNA (Patel et al., 2013), also should be explored. Finally, 311 these analyses could be integrated with cellular gene expression changes, viral 312 replication/translation, cytopathology, and pathogenesis studies to provide a 313 comprehensive picture of the influence of this region of viral non-Role of 3' UTR in viral replication and polyadenylation 319 For positive sense RNA viruses, synthesis of a negative-strand intermediate is a 320 required step in viral replication. A 19-nucleotide CSE at the end of the alphavirus 3' 321 UTR immediately prior to the poly (A) tail serves as the promoter for negative strand 322 synthesis (Kuhn et al., 1990; Ou et al., 1981). This CSE is highly conserved in sequence 323 and location in all alphaviruses (Pfeffer et al., 1998). Mutations in the SINV CSE reduced 324 plaque size, and reduced viral replication or induced temperature sensitive mutations 325 (George and Raju, 2000; Kuhn et al., 1990). Specifically, nucleotides -5 to -1 (with -1 326 representing the last base on the 3' end of the genomic RNA prior to the poly(A) tail) are 327 required for initiation of negative strand synthesis as mutations reduce the efficiency of 328 negative strand synthesis (Hardy and Rice, 2005). The cytosine at -1 nucleotide has 329 been identified as the site of initiation for negative strand synthesis as mutations or 330 deletions of this nucleotide prevent RNA synthesis (Hardy, 2006; Hardy and Rice, 2005).",

In mammalian cells, the PABP bound to the poly(A) tail of mRNAs interacts with 338 translation initiation factors bound to the cap structure at the 5' UTR, resulting in 339 circularization of mRNA and protein translation (Lemay et al., 2010). A similar model of 340 translation of the alphavirus viral genome has been proposed based on the length 102 nucleotides) (Ou et al., 1982; Pfeffer et al., 1998). The exact role of the 345 RSEs in viral replication has not been determined for each alphavirus but evidence 346 suggests that they contribute to virus replication in mosquito cells. Deletion of the EEEV 347 RSEs reduces replication in mosquitoes without altering infectivity in mammalian cells 348 (Trobaugh et al., 2014; Weaver et al., 1999). As mentioned above for CHIKV, 349 adaptation to replication in mosquito vectors drives the retention of the RSEs in the 3' 350 UTR, and deletions in the RSEs result in the poor replication of the Asian lineages in 351 mosquito vectors (Chen et al., 2013).

In hematopoietic/myeloid 388 cells, miR-142-3p binds to miR-142-3p binding sites in the 3' UTR of EEEV, blocking389 translation of the viral genome (Trobaugh et al., 2014). By blocking viral translation and 390 replication in myeloid cells in vivo, miR-142-3p repression minimizes induction of type I 391 IFN and other innate immune effectors and limits prodromal disease. This allows EEEV 392 to replicate essentially undetected by host defense responses, which exacerbates 393 16 disease in animal models. Limited type I IFN production and prodrome during the early 394 stages of infection is a hallmark of human EEEV disease and correlates with a poor 395 clinical outcome in children (Silverman et al., 2013). Removal of the miR-142-3p binding 396 sites rescues viral translation and replication in myeloid cells in vitro and in vivo resulting 397 in enhanced systemic type I IFN production, prodromal signs of disease, and attenuation 398 of the virus in vivo (Trobaugh et al., 2014). The interaction of miR-142-3p and EEEV 399 demonstrates how a host miRNA can influence viral replication through cellular tropism, 400 greatly affecting the pathogenesis of RNA viruses. Three of the four miR-142-3p binding 401 sites in the 3'UTR have perfect seed sequence matches to miR-142-3p, whereas the 402 fourth is considered non-canonical due to one nucleotide mismatch in the seed 403 sequence (Trobaugh et al., 2014). The number of miRNA binding sites, the location of 404 miRNA binding sites in the secondary structure, and seed sequence complementarity all 405 regulate miRNA:mRNA interactions (Peterson et al., 2014). Both canonical and non-406 canonical seed sequence miRNA binding sites have the potential to restrict translation of 407 viral RNA in a cell-specific manner (Helwak et al., 2013). Including non-canonical binding 408 sites in the prediction algorithms increases the number of potential miRNA binding sites 409 in viral 3' UTRs.

Clearly, those with longer UTRs have the potential for a greater 416 number of miRNA binding sites. Predictive algorithm analysis of the comparatively long417 3' UTRs of CHIKV or SINV, for example, yields numerous canonical and non-canonical 418 miRNA binding sites. However, the presence of highly specific sequences that result in 419 restriction of RNA viruses presents a conundrum, as viruses should readily mutate to 420 eliminate these sites and enhance replication in some cells. As was the case with 421 EEEV, identification of functional cellular miRNA:viral RNA interactions requires 422 understanding of virus and host biology in addition to identification of binding seed 423 sequences (Gardner et al., 2008; Trobaugh et al., 2014). Most likely, miRNAs, while 424 restricting virus replication in certain cells, will provide a growth advantage for the virus 425 either at the vertebrate organism level or, in the case of arboviruses, in the mosquito 426 vector or reservoir host. In addition, miRNA-virus genome interactions could promote 427 virus replication directly as seen with the hepatitis C virus 5' UTR (Jopling et al., 2005; 428 Shimakami et al., 2012). Indeed, absent knowing that the lack of a prodrome during 429 EEEV infection is due to restriction of virus genome translation in myeloid cells, the 430 interaction of miR-142-3p and EEEV 3' UTR may not have been identified (Gardner et 431 al., 2008; Trobaugh et al., 2014). Thus down-regulating the activity of the miRNA 432 systems in single cell types is unlikely to reveal the complex effects of miRNAs on virus 433 tropism and disease (Bogerd et al., 2014). 434 435 4.3. Role of 3' UTR in determining host range of alphaviruses 436 Increasing evidence suggests the alphavirus 3'UTR also has an important role in 437 viral replication and adaptation to new replication environments in mosquito and 438 mammalian cells. As discussed above, deletion of 31 to 293 nucleotides in SINV 439 reduces viral replication in mosquito cells but not in chicken cells (Kuhn et al., 1990). For 440 EEEV, deletion of the 260 nucleotides in the 3' UTR reduces replication in C6/36 441 mosquito cells (Trobaugh et al., 2014; Weaver et al., 1999). Also, this region of the 3' 442 UTR is important for vector infection as infection rates of Aedes taeniorhynchus 443 mosquitoes are lower after deletion of the 3' UTR compared to WT EEEV viruses 444 (Trobaugh et al., 2014). The requirement of the 3' UTR for efficient mosquito infection 445 18 suggests a potential mechanism for maintaining sequences in the viral 3' UTRs and, 446 possibly, specific miRNA binding sites. As yet, there is no evidence that the RNA 447 interference system of mosquitoes facilitates alphavirus replication. As discussed in 448 depth in Section 2.2 above, similar conclusions have been made by large scale 449 sequencing and mutagenesis analysis of the 3' UTRs of different CHIKV lineages 450 associated with geographical and temporal changes in virus occurrence (Chen et al., 451 2013). From these data, Weaver and coworkers have proposed that elements in the 3' 452 UTR, such as repeated sequences, can be associated with virus adaptation to new 453 reservoir hosts but are primarily dictated by constraints in replication in particular 454 mosquito vectors. Even though miR-142-3p is not expressed in mosquitoes, the fact that 455 a small number of substitution mutations in the miR-142-3p binding sites in EEEV 456 markedly affected mosquito replication competence supports the concept of the 457 importance of 3' UTR elements in viral replication in mosquitoes.",

            "text": "Functional implications of 3' UTR interactions with cellular proteins 461 As mentioned above, the 3' UTR of alphaviruses can interact with the cellular 462 HuR and La proteins (Sokoloski et al., 2010; Paragon and Strauss, 1996). Although the 463 functional implications of the interactions with the cellular La protein are unknown, 464 binding of the cellular HuR protein to high affinity sites in the alphavirus 3' UTR region 465 impacts both cellular and viral gene expression during infection. Most alphaviruses, 466 except CHIKV, o'nyong-nyong virus (ONNV), and Ross River virus (RRV), contain a U-467 rich sequence (~40 nucleotides in length) preceding the 19-nucleotide CSE that is the 468 site of interaction with the cellular protein, HuR. This interaction stabilizes the viral RNA 469 in the cytoplasm in mammalian and mosquito cells preventing deadenylation and viral 470 RNA decay (Dickson et al., 2012; Garneau et al, 2008; Sokoloski et al., 2010). In ONNV 19 and RRV that lack a U-rich sequence in their 3' UTRs, HuR protein interacts with the 472 RSEs with high affinity through alternative sequence elements (Dickson et al., 2012). In 473 addition, HuR becomes sequestered in the cytoplasm by interactions with the 3' UTRs of 474 these highly expressed viral transcripts (Dickson et al, 2012; Barnhart et al, 2013). This 475 'sponging' of cellular HuR protein impacts post-transcriptional regulation of gene 476 expression in infected cells. Cellular mRNAs that normally rely on HuR protein for 477 stability are destabilized and fail to accumulate. In addition, nuclear processes such as 478 splicing and polyadenylation that are influenced by HuR binding are dysregulated in 479 infected cells. These effects are due primarily to the viral 3' UTR and can be reproduced 480 by transfection of RNAs containing the SINV 3' UTR with no additional viral factors 481 (Barnhart et al, 2013). Thus, the presence of large amounts of an alphavirus 3' UTR in 482 infected cells can cause substantial changes in cellular gene expression that likely 483 impact cellular homeostasis.
