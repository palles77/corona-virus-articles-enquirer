By inscribing geographical stability onto infected bodies in motion through the languages of race and genetics, Chinese public health professionals sought to constrain the mobility of infection and, in doing so, to contain the symbolic and material threats to China's modernity and development that flu-like infections, and the people who carried and spread them, had come to represent. While SARS in this imaginary became a BChinese^or BCantonese^disease, H1N1 became a EuroAmerican disease that, when it reached inside China, adhered more easily to those Chinese who did not quite belong. In constructing this imaginary, public health professionals' racialization of certain groups thought to be infectious joined with the racialization of the infections themselves. H1N1 could not easily infect most Chinese because both the virus and its hosts were racially alien.",

Health education videos and posters featured cartoon pigs and birds combining viral material in North America that then skipped across the ocean to China. Several informants told me that the apparent increased virulence of the virus among those infected in Mexico, and the failure of the virus to spread quickly to China, could be directly attributed to racial-genetic differences between Chinese and Mexicans (renzhong bu yiyang), as well as to the genetic origins and characteristics of the virus itself. A microbiologist, for example, explained to me, Look at how many cases there are in the US. I think it's because the virus' genes have been found to be of Euro-American origins-so it is more virulent in people with those genes, in the US and Mexico and Europe-it passes more easily between people because they are better adapted to these genes. But in China it doesn't pass very easily-it's because our genes are different. So although it keeps spreading in the US, after a few generations here it gets weak-that's why all our cases are imported. Said a leader in Tianmai's influenza control department:",

This is one reason why early in the initial H1N1 outbreak my informants displayed great confidence that H1N1 in fact could be both kept out of China and quickly brought under control. For them, the preferential infection of bodies associated with a virus' home region assured that though a virus may leave its originating space, the harm it could inflict on foreign spaces would be limited. SARS spread around the world, and it went to Toronto, but it remained Chinese through its genetic makeup and ability to target Chinese genes.

Thus, populations labeled as Bblack^in the USA are categorized as more at risk for sickle cell anemia than Caucasian populations, due to an assumed link between blackness and genetic African ancestry (see Fullwiley 2007 Fullwiley , 2011 Wailoo 2001) .

A similar type of fluid movement between languages and interpretations was evident in my conversations with Tianmai's public health professionals. In the same conversations in which they warned me that I had to exercise more caution than they did when interacting with H1N1 contact cases (because as a White American, I was more susceptible than they were to catching the virus), they would also trot out the latest epidemiological models from WHO and CDC to show me how the disease was moving from continent to continent.",

In addition to preferentially killing off Chinese, some saw the stigma and discrimination against Chinese abroad that became associated with SARS as further evidence of a racialbiological attack with the intended consequence of holding back the success of biologically Chinese people, no matter where they lived. 6 Racially specific biological weapons in this imaginary were impressively powerful. By casting viral DNA as racially specific, my informants gave biological weapons the crucial power that has so far (at least according to mainstream theories) prevented them from being used widely: the ability to distinguish between self and enemy within the same space, to infect the bad guy and keep the attacker safe.",

They pointed to the timing of the origins of the disease in Mexico with President Obama's trip there in April 2009 as evidence that terrorists had perhaps released the virus in a failed attempt to assassinate the President. Though it was targeted at Obama's Bmixed black and white genes,^however, H1N1's Mexican origins ended up making it more deadly to Mexican natives, they told me. H1N1 was a EuroAmerican virus but also a specifically Mexican virus, due to its origins in a Mexican environment. It could have infected Obama, but it was unsurprising that it infected local Mexicans more effectively. SARS, too, had a dual genetic identity: it was a Chinese virus that those both inside and outside of the public health world widely believed was adapted to infect members of the Han Chinese race. But it was also a specifically Cantonese virus, due to its origins in Guangdong Province-home to tens of millions of Cantonese, a racialized subpopulation of the Han. A common thread that runs through both biomedical and TCM origin stories of the SARS outbreak provided a basis for the diversion of racial blame to the Cantonese. Microbiologists and epidemiologists associated the emergence and spread of the SARS virus not just with Chinese people as a general category, but more specifically with the cultural practices and urban environments associated with southern Chinese people, especially Cantonese-speaking people from Guangdong Province. Similarly, practitioners of TCM blamed the SARS outbreak on the peculiar geography, culture, and type of body that TCM teachings also associate with southern China. Both origin stories promoted the view that the region of south China in which SARS originated fostered the development and the spread of infectious diseases, and both implied that these diseases might preferentially attach to south Chinese bodies. The resonance between these two origin stories promoted a logic of like-infects-like, with the originating continental and regional environments of both virus and carrier being the critical risk factors for infection. Thus, the internal racialization of Chinese subpopulations became a key component of the racialization of both Chinese and foreign viruses.",

Instead they drew upon Stalin's model of the Bfour commonalities^: common language, territory, mode of economic production, and psychology (Mullaney 2011) . The importance of common territory formed the basis for the establishment of five autonomous regions in the Western part of China where single minority groups were concentrated in high proportions (Tibet (Tibetan or Zang), Xinjiang (Uyghur), Ningxia (Hui), Guangxi (Zhuang), and Inner Mongolia (Mongol or Meng)). The establishment of the autonomous regions helped to reinforce a spatial and geographical dichotomy of center and periphery-the center being the Han, symbolically and physically located in China's major population centers; the periphery being the other 55 nationalities, symbolically and physically located in the peripheral parts of the nation-state. At the same time, the naturalization of the 56 number became a means of permanently tying the periphery to the center: if Tibetans are one of the 56 that make up China, that made Tibet an inalienable part of a multi-ethnic whole and a greater Chinese race (Litzinger 2000; Harrell 2001; Mullaney 2011) .",

Instead, like other transplants that migrated to Tianmai from the North, she carried with her more civilized customs and more sanitary cuisine. This time, mobility protected rather than exposed.

The hukou system of household registration, established in the 1950s as a means for the Communist government to control the mobility of Chinese citizens, impeded the floating population's ability to migrate permanently, effectively creating a class of illegal internal immigrants within all of China's major cities. Violating one's hukou to move to the cities without a proper permit could, until very recently, subject a rural migrant to deportation back to the countryside. 7 In addition to the floating population, Tianmai also had a sizable population of permanent, middle-class, hukou-holding migrants, many of whom came from the same parts of China from which the floating population came, and many of whom also had 7 Since the advent of the economic reforms in China in the 1980s, hukou restrictions have been progressively relaxed and legal (non-hukou) residence cards have become more widely available. In 2014, Chinese President Xi Jinping launched a reform process specifically aimed at expanding access to hukous. And migrant workers are now rarely deported, though they are still subject to harassment and fines. Still, urban hukous remain difficult to obtain for those who are uneducated, and even just registering for legal residency can be a bureaucratically complex and undependable process with questionable benefits for many migrants (see Xu 2009 ). As a result, much of the floating population remains unregistered. rural backgrounds. It was this latter group that included most of the public health professionals I knew in Tianmai. However, as migrants themselves who had only recently escaped poverty into the middle class, many of those who worked in public health in Tianmai felt that their own identities as Bmodern^and Bdeveloped^urban citizens-statuses they had obtained through a combination of education, skills, connections, and luck-were frighteningly unstable. The large numbers of rural migrants who filled their clinics and crowded into tenement housing seemed chaotic, unruly, and backwards; they represented both that which they had fled and that which they feared they still in a sense were. Tianmai's public health professionals reactively maligned this backward threat as dirty, dangerous, and backwards (see Mason 2012) . Even as floating migrants contributed much of the labor crucial to the Chinese development project and were officially included in this project's vision (Lee 2014) , they also were cast as that project's Achilles heel, the piece capable of bringing the whole structure tumbling down. Tianmai thus became a site where boundaries between Bgood,^modern migrants like public health professionals and Bbad,^backward migrants like the floating population were widely drawn and carefully guarded (Mason 2012 ; Infectious Change: Reinventing Chinese Public Health after an Epidemic (unpublished)). One of the ways that middle class Tianmai citizens like my informants guarded these boundaries was through a process of racialization.",

A student who resided in Tianmai invited me to tour a China Folk Culture village (Zhongguo minsu wenhua cun) in her hometown. We boarded a bus mostly full of what I only several years later was able to identify as rural migrant workers bound for the city. As we approached the city limits, two police officers boarded the bus, checked my passport, and checked everyone else's identification cards. Two dark-skinned men with short stature, carrying battered plastic plaid tote bags, were quietly escorted off the bus. I was young, I was not yet an anthropologist, and I did not think about why these men were headed to Tianmai, what they might plan to do there, or why their ID cards were scrutinized so thoroughly. Dong Han argues that the racial profiling of Han migrant workers that I observed on the bus that day is common to many Chinese cities, in which poor migrants have become the most visible racial Other, a stand-in for all that is threatening to the Chinese middle class. Han writes, BBy relying on bodily features to identify subjects of hukou enforcement, policing sets up direct links between physical appearance and particular social, economic and political status^(2010, p. 603). As Brodkin has argued in the case of the USA, the construction of race among immigrant populations goes hand and hand with the construction of class, such that differentiating by color or appearance provides a means of justifying the oppression of a working underclass (1998; see also Omi and Winant 1994) . Smaller and darker on average than urban Chinese due to a history of outdoor labor and poor nutrition, and cast as dirty and Blow quality^(suzhi di), the rural Han trying to circulate into and out of Chinese cities formed a massive racial underclass that was paradoxically composed of members of the dominant Han race (see Han 2010; Solinger 1999) .",

Because they were a mix of Han from all over China, the floating population's racialization explicitly did not translate to a coherent genetic or ancestral difference. It also did not necessarily translate to a difference in geographical location: the floating population was officially rural, but it also made up a large proportion of the populations of most major urban centers in China. What's more, its members often hailed from the same areas of rural China from which my now-middleclass informants-both Cantonese and non-Cantonese-once migrated. This was especially the case for older public health professionals, almost all of whom had experienced deep rural poverty during their childhood and young adult years, and thus shared more with the migrants than they cared to admit. Thus, the racialization of the floating migrants remained incomplete. Other than the very fact of their continued mobility, it was difficult to differentiate between Us and Them, when Us and Them came from the same places and were thought to share the same genes.",

The floating population represented the backwardness within on two levels: the backwardness within a modern China, and the backwardness within my informants' own modern selves.

The shared geographical origins of virus and carrier not only provided both with racial identities but also tethered them both to a common racial home through deep biological ties that transcended physical space. Infectiousness thus became a test of racial purity, and vice versa.

Contacts of suspect cases were placed in quarantine, and workers were assigned to long shifts at these facilities as well. Even after the virus began spreading inside Tianmai, public health professionals spent long weekends calling up every person who had crossed the border from Hong Kong and listed Tianmai as their destination, just to make sure that he or she wasn't feeling sick.",

International organizations and foreign governments criticized China for quarantining people unnecessarily and subjecting travelers to unnecessary tests and harassment. And yet in the end, though H1N1 did eventually spread inside China, and though it did infect and kill people from all regions of China, it killed fewer people overall, and wrought less damage, than in many other parts of the world (Wong 2009; Lurie 2009 ). Though China's modernity was again briefly questioned under a barrage of criticism about the use of Bnineteenth century^quarantining techniques (Mason 2010) , it would seem that, perhaps thanks to the efforts of Tianmai's public health professionals, H1N1 never did become a Chinese virus.
