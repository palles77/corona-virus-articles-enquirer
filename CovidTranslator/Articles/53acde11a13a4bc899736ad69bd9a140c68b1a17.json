The employees receive little or no training, nor do they receive recognition of the skills and experience they bring to the industry. Besides this, the glamour of tourism diverts crucial workforce from other economic sectors in the region, which might result in a gloomy outlook for employment in other sectors. Furthermore, a great part of the tourist-generated income is leaked away from the destinations, due to foreign ownership of hotels, excursion organizers and transportation services, or because of imports of high quality products demanded by sophisticated tourists (e.g. Kodak film, special food, Guinness beer, etc.).

Although it creates numerous opportunities for such good outcomes, it does not necessarily mean that they are always the results obtained. When locals perceive the tourists' lifestyles as more desirable than their own, the phenomenon of 'relative depravation' can occur, with effects varying from adopting tourists' fashion, to the formation of a 'developed culture' that often includes aspects such as drug consumption and prostitution [7] . Wishing to live like tourists live often makes locals feel unhappy, frustrated or angry, thoughts stimulated at least partially by the fact that locals have to work to provide quality leisure for the tourists. These kinds of feelings sometimes lead to peculiar expressions, as reported in Cornwall where some locals put stickers on their cars saying, 'I'm not a tourist: I live here!' [8] .",

Unfortunately, this is rarely the case for tourists, although the possibility exists. Most frequently, the relationships between tourists and locals are rather superficial and unbalanced due to language barriers, financial status differences, and the short time tourists spend in destinations. Tourists are often happy, relaxed, and unwilling to break these barriers, while locals are too busy working to ensure the relaxation. Instead of exchanging cultural experiences, in many cases locals become 'attractions' for tourists, altering their own traditions and culture to exploit their commercial potential, and gradually forgetting their importance. A small but sad example is the replacement of beautiful flower leis that welcomed tourists to Hawaii, with plastic flowers, because they are cheaper and more readily available for the large numbers of tourists that currently arrive everyday.",

In many cases, the tourism industry supports environmental protection as business insurance, preserving its natural assets by financing protective establishments or activities, awareness campaigns or events, research or educational initiatives. However, as pristine landscapes and exquisite sceneries become popular, they gradually become replaced by anonymous sites made of concrete and steel, with no personality and evolve into types of facilities that are perfectly replicable anywhere in the world as nature is gradually wiped out by tourism developments. Pollution, waste generation and land degradation, all too frequently occur as a consequence of the success of overpopulated destinations, where tourists compete with locals for available resources (water, land), and with biodiversity species (for their basic needs of food, water or breeding habitat) leading to over exploitation of the natural resources. Estimations made by the World Wildlife Fund (WWF) [10] show that the environmental impacts (resource consumption and waste generation), created during a 2-week holiday, account for 20-50% of the earthshare of one person for an entire year. This number illustrates very well the intensity of tourism-related consumption and production, the severity of impacts generated and the urgency to take reductive measures before all resources are consumed.",

Ironically, once the effects become fully evident, they strike back affecting the core value of the tourism business: the environment. Probably, the most eloquent example of environmental degradation striking back on tourism is global warming that threatens coastal areas, small islands, and ski resorts. According to the World Resource Institute studies, an increase in global temperature would cause the sea levels to rise by almost one meter by the end of the XXI century, which would result in extreme coastal flooding [11] , a scenario also supported by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change [12] . The same report provides a list of ecosystems likely to be threatened by a drastic change in climate, most of them being major tourist attractions: coral reefs, tropical forests, alpine regions and wetlands. By having these ecosystems endangered, tourism would lose much of its attractiveness and business. Furthermore, according to the WWF [13] , if global warming continues at the current rate, in approximately 100 years some of the most popular tourism destinations located in the hottest regions of the globe, will become undesirable due to severe increases in temperature, which is an incentive for all tourism stakeholders to reduce or avoid activities with global warming and other environmentally damaging potentials.",

However, failing to recognize this aspect and avoiding the issue of scale, a large number of studies have concentrated on developing forms of responsible tourism for small numbers of tourists, most likely because of commonalities in principles between sustainable and alternative types of tourism [15] . Without a doubt, small-scale responsible initiatives can be successful in preventing many of tourism's negative impacts, but are incompatible and incapable of meeting the demands for mass tourism requirements. Also, they cannot prevent the problems created by mass tourism moving to new locations and creating new impacts. Therefore, a more sound approach for achieving sustainable tourism must also address the problems caused by mass tourism.",

By emphasizing the urgency of managing current and future impacts of tourism, Welford et al. [18] drew attention to the gaps in finding ways of applying the sustainability principles in practice, where industry has a crucial role to play. Analyzing the implementation of possible sustainable tourism strategies, they identified as a prerequisite, the need for both the supply and the demand sides of the tourism market to take environmental protection actions. As an intermediary between the two sides, the tour operator has been recognized as holding a great possibility and responsibility for triggering such essential changes in attitudes and actions of producers and consumers, towards more sustainable tourism practices.",

Although the functions of tour operators may appear to be replaceable since increasingly customers can contact the producers directly, via Internet booking systems, the existence of tour operators is essential for the good performance of the industry overall, as it will be discussed below. This is true because firstly, tourism services are produced in bulk (e.g. a carrier has a fixed number of seats) and producers operate at a certain capacity regardless of the level of occupancy (i.e. a scheduled flight has to take off even if only a few seats are occupied). In order to keep prices low, the carrier has to maintain a high level of occupancy, which is very difficult to ensure on their own. By buying in bulk, the operator takes the burden of selling the products and Fig. 4 . The place of the tour operator in the tourism system. Source: adapted after Holloway, 1998 [8] .",

Nevertheless, facing low requirements from customers for responsible tourism services, and having little regulatory pressure for better environmental or social performance in their operations (most of the tour package legislation is quality and safety related) tour operators have had few incentives to invest efforts in improving their perform-ance, thus leaving the largest share of practical responsibilities to local authorities in tourist destinations. As a result, concrete activities actually implemented by tour operators to reduce their impacts were, at the time of the study, found to be very infrequent and superficial compared to their true potential [2] .",

In addition, they take frequent initiatives for education, sponsorship of environmental protection activities in destinations, although these activities are considered 'soft' compared to the true potential of tour operators [28] . Some large tour operators have also started to develop environmental management systems for the hotels and airlines under their direct ownership. Although these facilities cover only 10-15% of the tourism services sold by a tour operator-the rest being secured by sub-contractors-it represents an important step forward in terms of commitment taken by operators to reduce their impacts. The next step is to undertake responsibility and to secure a good environmental performance from the suppliers of the remaining 85-90% of the services they sell [29] .",

Without denying this argument, it is more important to focus on the positive potential of tour operators to use its vast contact with the tourists-as customers-to educate and to raise the awareness of tourists upon the levels of tourist consumption, its effects (e.g. energy consumption, waste generation), and possible preventative measures to avoid the occurrence of negative impacts. With an audience of 20 million tourists every year, one single company can have a tremendous yield in terms of raising awareness and in decreasing harmful consumption levels that are leading to unsustainable societal practices.",

Considering the competitive environment of the tour operating sector, the success of this attitude and approaches requires that all tour operators share a common commitment to promote environmentally sound practices. Probably, the most important action along this line was the establishment in 2000 of the Tour Operators Initiative for Sustainable Tourism [30] . This was the first forum that brought tour operators together to discuss com-mon strategies for sustainable tourism development. It served as a starting point for enhancing the sector's awareness and for facilitating exchanges of experiences. With the largest companies on board (TUI, British Airways Holidays, TTG) the initiative demonstrates that strategic alliances are possible and necessary to move sustainable tourism practices forward [2] .",

The efforts made by the largest European tour operators in these areas are impressive and deserve a lot of credit for intent and early successes. However, this paper advances the idea that tour operators could do much more, by expanding their influence onto their suppliers and customers, steering them to adopt more responsible attitude towards nature and society when providing leisure time opportunities for large numbers of people each year. Given the lack of incentives for tour operators to undertake such actions, there are numerous questions related to the practical ways of pursuing such goals by proactive tour operators, which this paper advances as subjects of further research, encouraging a new perspective for sustainable tourism research. Fundamentally, is there a possibility for mass tourism to become sustainable? The author believes there are many opportunities for making progress in this area and also that the tour operators are uniquely positioned to play catalytic roles in making such progress.",
