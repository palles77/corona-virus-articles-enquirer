RNA interference (RNAi) pathways have emerged as important regulators of virus-host cell interactions. In this study, two siRNA expression plasmids (shN1 and shN2) were generated to target two different coding regions of the nucleocapsid protein (N) of PHEV. The shRNAs were transiently transfected into a porcine kidney cell line, PK-15, to determine whether these constructs inhibited PHEV production. Our results revealed that both shRNAs were highly capable of inhibiting viral RNA genome replication, especially shN2. Next, stable transfection of shN2 was used to produce two siRNA stably expressing PK-15 cell clones (shN2-1 and shN2-2), and these two lines were infected with PHEV. The analysis of cytopathic effects (CPE) demonstrated that shN2-1 and shN2-2 were capable of protecting cells against PHEV infection with high specificity and efficiency. Furthermore, effective inhibition of viral replication persisted for up to 120 h by a TCID 50 assay. These results indicated that RNAi targeting of the N gene could facilitate studies of the specific function of viral genes associated with PHEV replication and may have potential therapeutic applications.",

Three primers were synthesized (JiKang, Shanghai, China) for quantification of the PHEV genome by real-time PCR: 5 -AGCGATGAGGCTATTCCGACTA-3 (NFP primer), 5 -TTGCCAGAATTGGCTCTACTACG-3 (NRP primer), and 5 -FTTC-CGCCAGGCACGGTACTCCCP-3 (TaqMan probe). The target region for real time RT-PCR spanned nucleotides 7210-7348 of the N protein gene of PHEV (GenBank accession no.: AY078417). Total RNA (100 ng) was extracted and purified using the Trizol LS Reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA). PCR was used to amplify the N gene with the NFP and NRP primers under conditions of 94 \u2022 C for 3 min, followed by 40 cycles of 94 \u2022 C for 30 s, 60 \u2022 C for 30 s, and 72 \u2022 C for 60 s, with a final extension at 72 \u2022 C for 7 min. The PCR product was gel-purified using an Agarose Gel DNA Extraction Kit (Axygen, Union, CA, USA) and then cloned into the pGEM-18T vector (Promega, Madison, WI, USA). The resulting plasmid, pT-N, for which the correct sequence was confirmed by direct sequencing, was selected as a quantitative standard for the determination of the viral RNA copy number. Real-time PCR was performed with the ABI PRISM \u00ae 7000 Sequence Detection System using a QuantiTect TM Probe PCR Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) under the conditions of 95 \u2022 C for 3 min, followed by 40 cycles of denaturation at 95 \u2022 C for 30 s, annealing, and extension at 60 \u2022 C for 30 s. The quantitative standard curve for the determination of the PHEV genome copy number was created by real-time PCR of standard plasmid Table 1 List of shRNA sequences in this study.",

PHEV was first isolated in 1962 in Canada from suckling piglets with encephalomyelitis and has since been isolated from swine worldwide. It was first isolated in primary cultures of pig kidney (PK-15) cells through visible cytopathic effects (CPE) and infectivity assays (Greig et al., 1962; Mengeling et al., 1972) . When piglets younger than 3 weeks are infected with PHEV, their mortality rates range from 20 to 100% (Pensaert, 1989) .RNA interference (RNAi) is an accurate and potent gene silencing method that uses double-stranded RNA (dsRNAs) molecules",
