The prevention of such transmission is expensive, requiring N95 respirators and negative pressure isolation rooms. This lecture first discussed whether respiratory viral infections are airborne with reference to published reviews of studies before 2008, comparative trials of surgical masks and N95 respirators, and relevant new experimental studies. However, the most recent experimental study, using naturally infected influenza volunteers as the source, showed negative results from all the manikins that were exposed. Modelling studies by ventilation engineers were then summarized to explain why these results were not unexpected. Second, the systematic review commissioned by the World Health Organization on what constituted aerosol-generating procedures was summarized. From the available evidence, endotracheal intubation either by itself or combined with other procedures (e.g. cardiopulmonary resuscitation or bronchoscopy) was consistently associated with increased risk of transmission by the generation of aerosols. \u00aa",

Preferential airborne infections such as chicken pox and measles can be initiated through multiple routes, but predominately by aerosols. These three infections are the only ones classified as airborne in international guidelines including those of the US Centers for Disease Control and the World Health Organization (WHO). 2,3 Finally, opportunistic airborne infections typically transmit through other routes but under favourable conditions, especially when aerosol-generating procedures such as intubation are undertaken, transmission can occur; examples include influenza and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). This last category is generally not taken as airborne, since, in the routine care of the patients, only droplet and contact precautions are required.",

This will require isolating the patient in a negative-pressure airborne infection isolation room (AII), and to use an N95 respirator rather than a surgical mask. 2, 3 Recent research has confirmed that the N95 respirator is able to block 95% of aerosols and indeed it is the preferred form of facial protection for airborne infections. 4 It should, however, be appreciated that implementing airborne precautions is relatively expensive because the availability of AII is often limited and the use of the N95 respirator is definitely more costly than the surgical mask. Still, there is a tendency to play safe and to consider all viral chest infections as possible airborne infections, and to include a wide range of procedures as aerosol-generating procedures. It is thus important to separate the facts from the myths, and this brief presentation deals with two key issues. The first is to establish whether viral infections such as SARS and influenza are airborne, and the second is to come up with a definitive list of aerosol-generating procedures. The evidence from systematic reviews on these issues is summarized by WHO. 3 ",

MacIntyre et al. then reported another study by the same centre in China that showed a significant difference (P \u00bc 0.024). 13 However, this was for subjects presenting with clinical respiratory infections. When only those with positive viral culture results were compared, there was no significant difference (P \u00bc 0.4). On the other hand, there was a significant difference in rates of positive bacterial cultures (P \u00bc 0.02).

Eight studies were quoted in support of this in a review published by Tran et al. 22 Recently, a study on influenza further confirmed that only bronchoscopy and intubation are actually aerosol-generating procedures. 23 Studies implicating other procedures have been reported, albeit with flaws, such as one study reporting that non-invasive ventilation was significant, but also admitting that infection control practices were inadequate. 24 In fact, nearly 90% of subjects in this paper reported inappropriate hand hygiene practices. There were also studies refuting widely held erroneous concepts e for example, that nebulizers are aerosolgenerating e and one such study showed that efficient transmission of SARS had already occurred before the machine was turned on. 25 ",

The only aerosol-generating procedures for which there is clear evidence for aerosol production is endotracheal intubation. Infection control guidelines should take all this information into consideration and ensure that current practices are in line with scientific evidence rather than with unsubstantiated myth.",
