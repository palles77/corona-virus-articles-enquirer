Generating feline cells with reduced ability to respond to interferon (IFN) is an essential step facilitating isolation of new candidate vaccine strains. Here, we describe the use of Crispr/Cas technology to disrupt type I IFN signaling in two feline cell lines, AK-D and Fcwf-4 CU, and evaluate the replication kinetics of a serotype I feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV) within these cells. We report that polyclonal cell populations and a clonal isolate, termed Fcwf-4 IRN, exhibited significantly diminished IFNresponsiveness and allowed FIPV replication kinetics comparable to parental cells. Furthermore, we demonstrate that replication of FIPV is enhanced by ectopic expression of a host serine protease, TMPRSS2, in these cells. We discuss the potential of these cells for isolating new clinical strains and for propagating candidate vaccine strains of FIPV.",

            "text": "Feline coronaviruses (FCoVs) are a group of alphacoronaviruses that infect cats and can cause a highly lethal disease known as feline infectious peritonitis (FIP) (Pedersen, 2009) . FCoVs are widespread with upwards of 90% of certain domestic feline populations exhibiting seropositivity for these viruses (Addie et al., 2003; Addie and Jarrett, 1992; Hohdatsu et al., 1992; Pedersen, 2009) . Despite the severity of this disease and the endemic nature of FCoVs, treatment options are limited. There are no currently approved therapeutics to treat FIP; however, reports of direct inhibition of virus growth and reversal of disease progression in individual cats using small molecule viral inhibitors have been promising (Kim et al., 2016 (Kim et al., , 2015 2013 , 2012 Pedersen et al., 2019 Pedersen et al., , 2018 St. John et al., 2015) . Although these studies demonstrate that treatment of FIP is possible, therapeutic interventions face significant challenges in overcoming the high number of naturally occurring infections. Widespread immunization against FCoV would be the most efficient method to alleviate the burden of disease and reduce the overall density of endemic virus. To date, however, vaccination efficacy has been limited (Pedersen, 2014a) .",

Infection by the endemic biotype, FECV, is mild and leads to subclinical, persistent infection in kittens (Addie, 2011; Addie et al., 2003; Merck Veterinary Manual, 2015) . However, a subset of FECV infections (3-5%) result in lethal FIP, likely caused when a mutant, highly pathogenic biotype, termed FIPV, arises during replication (Pedersen, 2009; Vennema et al., 1998) . FCoVs are further defined by two serotypes based on antigenicity of the viral spike protein (Hohdatsu et al., 1991; Pedersen et al., 1984) , although an updated categorization model has recently been proposed . Serotype I FCoVs account for the bulk (80-90%) of naturally occurring infections in domestic cats, while serotype II viruses are responsible for 10-20% of infections in endemic regions [reviewed in (Kipar and Meli, 2014; Pedersen, 2014b) ]. Immunization against serotype I FIPV is likely the most effective vaccination strategy to protect against FIP as targeting this highly prevalent serotype would elicit broad herd immunity (Pedersen, 2009) ; however, implementing an effective serotype I FIPV vaccine has been largely unsuccessful.",

Strong innate responses, typified by high levels of type I interferon (IFN), generally https://doi.org/10. 1016/j.virol.2019.08.030 Received 24 May 2019; Received in revised form 29 August 2019; Accepted 29 August 2019 result in robust adaptive responses and development of immune memory (Hoebe et al., 2004; Siegrist, 2013) . Coronaviruses (CoVs) including FCoV, however, delay or subvert innate signaling using a number of virus-encoded type I IFN antagonists (Dedeurwaerder et al., 2014; Deng et al., 2017; Kindler et al., 2017; Rose and Weiss, 2009; Totura and Baric, 2012 ) that limit appropriate inflammatory responses (Channappanavar et al., 2016) . In the case of FIPV, infection of monocytes triggers unregulated inflammation and immune-mediated pathology. The adaptive responses, including cytotoxic T cell and humoral B cell stimulation and recruitment are generally weak and do not result in immunologic memory (Tang et al., 2011) . As a further complication, antibodies produced against the spike and envelope proteins of FIPV have been shown to mediate antibody-dependent enhancement of disease Olsen et al., 1992) , challenging the traditional approaches to surface-antigen vaccine design. Several groups have demonstrated that strong cytotoxic T cell responses during FIPV infection are associated with positive disease outcomes (de Groot-Mijnes et al., 2004; Pedersen, 2014b; Satoh et al., 2011) . Importantly, type I IFN signaling has been shown to enhance cytotoxic T cell responses [reviewed in (Meager, 2006; Tough, 2012) ] as well as promote memory T cell development [reviewed in (Huber and David Farrar, 2011) ]. Thus, a live-attenuated serotype I FIPV strain that stimulates an early type I IFN response may lead to development of long-lasting T cell memory and elicit protection.",

To this end, we employed the Crispr/Cas gene editing system to disrupt domain 2 of the type I IFN receptor (IFN\u03b1R2) in both AK-D and Fcwf-4 CU cell lines. We demonstrate the successful disruption of IFN-responsiveness in both cell populations as well as the isolation of a clonal cell line derived from the IFN\u03b1R-null Fcwf-4 CU population. The replication kinetics of serotype I FIPV Black were evaluated in each cell type and we show that the Crispr/Cas-modified cells remain permissive to virus infection. Lastly, we sought to enhance replication of serotype I FCoVs in one of these cell lines to aid in the recovery and growth of serotype I FIPV strains. To this end, we expressed a host transmembrane serine protease, TMPRSS2, and demonstrate enhanced replication of FIPV Black. Together, our data describe the successful generation and characterization of three feline cell lines deficient in IFN signaling, one of which is capable of enhanced FIPV replication through expression of a host protease. We predict that these cells will facilitate the recovery of live-attenuated serotype I FIPV strains and highlight the importance of a geneticallymalleable cell line to isolate clinical strains of serotype I FIPV from infected cats.",

We first targeted the type I interferon receptor (IFN\u03b1R) in an immortalized cell line derived from feline lung tissue (AK-D) using Crispr/Cas gene editing. AK-D cells were chosen because they are permissive to the serotype I FIPV Black strain used here and have a defined genotype. To disrupt the IFN\u03b1R2, wild-type AK-D cells were transduced with lentiviruses carrying a pLentiCRISPRv2 on which a single-guide (sg) RNA, targeting exon 2 of feline ifn\u03b1r2 (2.2), was encoded. Positive selection was performed using puromycin and surviving cells were cultivated as a polyclonal population termed AK-D 2.2. As there is no available IFN\u03b1R-specific antibody to detect the presence of feline IFN\u03b1R2 protein, we used a functional assay to evaluate the AK-D 2.2 cells for an IFN signaling-deficient phenotype. Increasing concentrations of purified feline IFN\u03b1 were exogenously applied to AK-D or AK-D 2.2 cells and levels of IFN-stimulated gene (ISG) 54 transcript were determined by quantitative PCR (qPCR). ISG54 expression is prominently upregulated following activation of the type I IFN receptor (Fensterl and Sen, 2011) and is used here to report on the functionality of the IFN\u03b1R. As expected, parental AK-D cells responded to exogenous IFN\u03b1 with a dose-dependent increase in ISG54 expression. The AK-D 2.2 cell population, however, produced significantly fewer ISG54 transcripts than the parental AK-D cells (Fig. 1A) , indicating a disruption of the type I IFN response pathway. The subtle, yet concentration-dependent ISG54 transcription observed from AK-D 2.2 cells may be attributed to the polyclonal nature of the AK-D 2.2 cell population, which were selected for positive transduction, but not necessarily loss of IFN signaling. Nonetheless, these results indicate that the AK-D 2.2 cells have a diminished total response to IFN\u03b1, likely due to disruption of the IFN\u03b1R2.",

Virus titers were determined by plaque assay of cellfree supernatants derived from cells infected with FIPV Black at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.1.

Next, we asked if AK-D 2.2 cells can be used as an indicator cell type to accurately determine FIPV Black titer by plaque assay, a point of critical importance in future studies characterizing HIS mutant FIPV strains. An ideal indicator cell type allows a virus to form well-defined and easily enumerable plaques; therefore, we sought to determine if virus-induced cytopathic effect (CPE) or plaque size are affected by the absence of IFN\u03b1R2 in AK-D 2.2 cells. To evaluate CPE progression, AK-D and AK-D 2.2 cells were infected with 0.1 MOI FIPV Black. Over 48 h, we observed increased CPE in AK-D 2.2 cells compared to parental AK-D cells (data not shown), suggesting an increase in virus spread. To evaluate plaque formation, plaque assays were performed using a known concentration of FIPV Black, which was serially diluted and applied to AK-D and AK-D 2.2 indicator cells. FIPV Black formed large and enumerable plaques in AK-D 2.2 cells, which allowed for more accurate determination of virus titer compared to the parental AK-D cells (Fig. 1C) . In AK-D 2.2 cells, plaques were more easily identified at 72 hpi, and plaque sizes were comparable to those on Fcwf-4 CU cells at 48 hpi as we recently reported (O'Brien et al., 2018) . It was difficult to accurately determine virus titer using wildtype AK-D cells, as the plaques were too small to count accurately at both time points and led to an underestimation of PFU/mL. Our results highlight the utility of the AK-D 2.2 cells in determining the titer of serotype I FIPV and indicate that this cell line will be critical in future studies investigating IFN antagonist-mutant strains of FIPV.",

These cells are a more physiologically relevant cell type in which to study FIPV and grow the Black strain to high, cell-free titers (O'Brien et al., 2018) . To knock down the IFN\u03b1R2, parental Fcwf-4 CU cells were transduced with lentiviruses carrying pLentiCRISPRv2 encoding an sgRNA targeting the second exon of the feline ifn\u03b1r2 gene (2.2), the same sequence targeted in AK-D cells. Positive transductants were selected using puromycin and cells were cultivated as a polyclonal population termed Fcwf-4 2.2 Poly. To evaluate the type I IFN-responsiveness of the Fcwf-4 2.2 Poly cells, cultures were treated with 1000 U of feline type I IFN for 6 h and evaluated for expression of ISG54. Compared to the parental Fcwf-4 CU cells, the Fcwf-4 2.2 Poly cells had reduced ISG54 transcript production suggesting positive disruption of the ifnar2 gene ( Fig. 2A) . Next, in order to obtain a single, geneticallydefined cell line, the Fcwf-4 2.2 Poly cells were sorted into a 96-well plate at one cell per well, and grown for 30 days. Three isolated clones (CL1-3) were evaluated for IFN-responsiveness by first stimulating with 1000 U of IFN then measuring levels of ISG54 transcript by qPCR ( Fig. 2A) . Fcwf-4 2.2 Poly clone 3, which exhibited the most subtle ISG54 response, were termed \"IRN\" for IFN\u03b1 Receptor Null and maintained for further analysis. FIPV Black replication kinetics were similar in the parental Fcwf-4 CU and Fcwf-4 IRN clonal cell line as determined by plaque assay measuring infectious particles (Fig. 2B ) and by qPCR measuring production of nucleocapsid (N) gene transcript (Fig. 2C ). To further evaluate IFN responsiveness, Fcwf-4 CU and IRN cells were treated with 1000 U of type I IFN for 8 h prior to infection with FIPV Black (MOI = 0.01). As expected, virus replication was significantly reduced in parental CU cells pre-treated with IFN\u03b1 (Fig. 2D ).",

Crispr/Cas gene editing targets and cleaves a specified nucleotide sequence leading to non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) DNA repair. This naturally imperfect double-strand break reconstruction process commonly introduces in/del mutations, which can disrupt gene transcription, reduce protein function or cause early termination of protein translation. We reasoned that the most direct method to determine how the IFN\u03b1R2 gene may be disrupted was to compare the ifnar2 mRNA sequences produced in Fcwf-4 CU and IRN cells. Indeed, we found that the ifnar2 mRNA obtained from Fcwf-4 IRN cells contained a 14-nucleotide deletion at the intended Cas9 cleavage site (Fig. 3A) . The frameshift arising from this deletion positioned a stop codon in-frame, resulting in early termination at residue 27 and, likely, a shortened IFN\u03b1R2 protein (Fig. 3A) . Further, we asked if ifnar2 transcription was affected by this mutation. We found that mRNA expression from ifnar2 exon 1-4, the region targeted by our sgRNA sequence, was actually higher in IRN cells compared to parental cells (Fig. 3B ) indicating that disruption did not negatively impact transcription. Finally, we determined that the melting temperatures of the parental and IRN ifnar2 exon 1-4 mRNA amplicons produced during qPCR differed, on average,",

Host-cell proteases are critical to coronavirus entry and can determine tissue tropism and replication efficiency (Millet and Whittaker, 2015) . The transmembrane serine protease 2, TMPRSS2, has been shown to mediate or enhance cell-surface entry of a number of CoVs including human coronavirus (HCoV) 229E (Bertram et al., 2013; Shirato et al., 2016) , Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS)-CoV (Park et al., 2016; Shirato et al., 2013) and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-CoV (Glowacka et al., 2011; Reinke et al., 2017) . As one of the goals of this study was to develop tools to aid in investigating feline coronavirus, we asked if expression of this protease could enhance FCoV replication. Feline TMPRSS2 protein carrying a C-terminal V5 tag was cloned into a pLVX lentivirus backbone vector and termed pLVX-fTMPRSS2(V5). To demonstrate subcellular localization and to visualize expression, HEK 293T/17 cells were transfected with the pLVX-fTMPRSS2(V5). The V5 epitope was detected by immunofluorescence within the cell cytoplasm and at the cell surface (Fig. 4A ) and both the full-length (55 kDa) and the cleavage product (> 25 kDa), indicating an active protein, were detected from these cells by Western blot (Fig. 4B,  left) . Fcwf-4 IRN cells transduced with pLVX-fTMPRSS2(V5) lentivirus also had detectable levels of the full-length and active forms of TMPRSS2 (Fig. 4B, right) demonstrating that expression of an active Plaque sizes (F) were measured using Adobe Photoshop software and mean \u00b1 SD values were analyzed using unpaired t-tests. *P < 0.05; **P < 0.01; ***P < 0.001; ****P < 0.0001. feline protease was achievable in this cell line. Therefore, we sought to determine if TMPRSS2 had an impact on the replication of FIPV. Fcwf-4 IRN cells were transduced with increasing dilutions of pLVX-fTMPRSS2(V5) lentivirus for 48 h, then infected with FIPV Black at a MOI of 0.1 for 18 h. Expression of TMPRSS2 at dilutions below 1:20 ( Fig. 4C ) resulted in significant increases in FIPV N gene transcript ( Fig. 4D ) compared to cells that did not express TMPRSS2, suggesting that addition of a feline protease can enhance virus replication. Interestingly, N gene expression was reduced at lower dilutions of TMPRSS2 (1:2.5) suggesting that expression of these proteases needs to be carefully titrated, and too much protein can result in reduced titers. Together, these data describe the successful generation of two IFN\u03b1R-null cell lines by Crispr/Cas, the isolation of an Fcwf-4 IFN\u03b1R-null clone, and demonstrate that expression of a feline protease in these cells can enhance replication of serotype I FIPV.",

Feline cell lines that lack IFN signaling are necessary for generating these potential FCoV vaccine strains in order to avoid selective pressures that would reduce or eliminate virus replication. To our knowledge, such IFN-nonresponsive feline cell lines were not available and studies using gene-modifying tools such as Crispr/Cas had not been performed in feline cells permissive to FCoVs. In a previous study, we characterized the growth kinetics of FIPV Black in AK-D and Fcwf-4 CU cells and demonstrated that rapid growth of wild-type serotype I FIPV could be achieved given the right cell type and conditions (O'Brien et al., 2018) . However, these cells still produced IFN upon stimulation suggesting that neither cell line would be appropriate for recovery of viruses attenuated by deletion on IFN antagonists. Previous studies from our lab using mouse hepatitis virus (MHV), a model murine coronavirus, strongly imply that production of IFN antagonist-deficient CoVs by reverse genetics absolutely requires the use of an IFN-nonresponsive cell type (Deng et al., 2017) . In that study, we determined by deep-sequencing that mutant MHV strains produced in IFN-responsive cells acquired additional suppressor mutations. This phenomenon likely occurred in response to selection imposed by the antiviral activity of type I IFN, which may have selected against the attenuated phenotype. Cells lacking IFN\u03b1R allowed for recovery of \"clean\" mutant viruses that contained only the desired mutation. Subsequent characterization of novel MHV IFN antagonists, as well as the relevant mechanisms underlying their activities, were undertaken using IFN\u03b1R \u2212/cells, highlighting the need of such cell lines in investigating attenuated FCoV strains. Building on this idea, the goal of this study was to genetically modify AK-D and Fcwf-4 CU cells to generate cell lines that are i) highly permissive to serotype I FCoV and ii) deficient in IFN\u03b1R signaling, two characteristics we predict will allow future investigation of not only HIS viruses, but also isolation of clinically important FIPV strains.",

Both of the newly developed cell types display the desired characteristics, exhibiting a deficiency in IFN responsiveness while remaining highly permissive to FIPV Black infection. We demonstrated that the AK-D 2.2 and Fcwf-4 IRN cells permitted virus replication to high titers similar to those obtained from infected parental cells. These results were expected as wild-type FCoVs encode IFN antagonists allowing virus replication despite the potent antiviral activities of type I IFN (Dedeurwaerder et al., 2014 (Dedeurwaerder et al., , 2013 . The Fcwf-4 IRN clonal cell line will be an important tool moving forward as these cells have low IFN-responsiveness due to a defined IFN\u03b1R2 mutation, grow high titers of FIPV Black, and can be effectively transduced to express additional host proteins. The AK-D 2.2 cells were shown to be useful in determining virus titer by plaque assay. FIPV Black induced more rapid CPE development in AK-D 2.2 compared to parental AK-D cells, resulting in larger and more easily enumerable plaques. This same trend was observed in Fcwf-4 cells, with virus forming larger plaques in IRN cells compared to CU cells. We speculate that these larger plaques may develop due to increased virus spread into adjacent uninfected cells due to lower expression of antiviral ISGs in the IFN\u03b1R-disrupted cell populations. Importantly, the ability of serotype I FIPV to form larger plaques on AK-D 2.2 and Fcwf-4 IRN cells allows more accurate titer determination and will be critical in future studies to accurately measure the titer of HIS FCoVs.",

            "text": "The final objective of this study was to determine if we could enhance the replication of serotype I FIPV in IRN cells, which may aid in the recovery of IFN sensitive strains in future studies. TMPRSS2, a transmembrane serine protease, has been shown to promote entry of many coronaviruses into host cells (Bertram et al., 2013; Glowacka et al., 2011; Park et al., 2016; Reinke et al., 2017; Shirato et al., 2016 Shirato et al., , 2013 . While tropism of FCoV has been linked to protease usage (Licitra et al., 2013) , many details remain to be determined. To demonstrate the utility of the clonal Fcwf-4 IRN cell line in investigation of type I FCoVs, we transduced these cells with feline TMPRSS2 as a surrogate protease and observed a significant, though modest, increase FIPV Black replication as detected by an increase in N gene expression. This is an important observation as it demonstrates that Fcwf-4 IRN cells can be transduced to express functional proteins, and that addition of host factors is a viable way of enhancing serotype I FIPV infection in these cells. It should be noted that both infected and uninfected Fcwf-4 IRN cells that were transduced with the 1:2.5 dilution of lentivirus had significant morphologic differences, such as increased cell rounding, clumping and detachment from the plate, compared to higher dilutions and non-transduced cells. Lower N gene expression, indicating reduced virus titer, was also observed in cells with the highest TMPRSS2 expression. This may be due to reduced accessibility of the virus to cells that were not adherent to the dish, or alternatively, the increased abundance of active TMPRSS2, which may prematurely cleave CoV spike, preventing efficient membrane fusion and cell entry.",

            "text": "An additional benefit to TMPRSS2-expressing Fcwf-4 IRN cells is their potential to recover serotype I FIPV isolates directly from clinical samples. CoV spike-mediated membrane fusion and subsequent entry into host cells has been shown to occur at both the cell surface and within endosomes depending on the availability of host proteases (Belouzard et al., 2012; Millet and Whittaker, 2015) (Fig. 5, top) . For serotype I FCoVs, the presence of a furin cleavage site at S1/S2 is linked to both clinical outcome and cell culture adaptation, while cleavage at the S2' site likely mediates entry within endosomes. For FIPV Black, we consider that the presence of a trypsin-like protease (e.g. TMPRSS2) at the cell surface can functionally replace the usual endogenous protease to promote virus replication. Importantly, entry of serotype I FCoV can be further impacted by tissue culture (TC) adaptation. de Haan and colleagues demonstrated that the spike protein encoded on a Fcwf-4 TCadapted serotype I FCoV strain, FIPV-UCD1, had reduced cleavage at the S1/S2 site, but exhibited increased binding to heparan sulfate (de Haan et al., 2008) . Interestingly, the serotype I FCoV clinical isolate, FECV-UCD, contains a full furin cleavage site at S1/S2 and did not bind heparan sulfate, and therefore did not replicate in Fcwf-4 cells. This suggests that TC-adapted strains may forfeit S1/S2 cleavage along with binding to heparan sulfate, possibly a more abundant entry receptor on Fcwf-4 cells compared to the yet unknown natural receptor for serotype I FCoV (Fig. 5, bottom left) . The concept that TC-adaptation can alter the preferred virus entry pathway may be common amongst labadapted CoV strains. A recent study by Shirato et al. showed that clinical isolates of HCoV 229E, much like serotype I FCoV clinical strains, favored TMPRSS2-mediated cell-surface entry while high passage, TC-adapted strains preferentially adopted cathepsin-mediated entry in endosomes (Shirato et al., 2016) .",

            "text": "We speculate that the cells and protease expression studies described here may provide an approach for recovery of additional pathogenic strains of serotype I FCoV from infected cats and lay the groundwork for future experiments and discussion. If serotype I FCoV growth in Fcwf-4 cells positively selects for the use of heparan sulfate as an entry receptor, and by extension the loss of the furin site, then this may explain why TC-adapted strains lose pathogenicity. Cell-surface level entry, mediated by S1/S2 cleavage by TMPRSS2, has been shown to be involved in pathogenicity and spread of CoVs in vivo (Park et al., 2016; Shirato et al., 2013) possibly by increasing the kinetics of virus entry (Earnest et al., 2017) . Therefore, the change in the S1/S2 cleavage site in TC-adapted strains may significantly contribute to both a loss of pathogenicity and an inability to cultivate true clinical isolates without several rounds of passage. Interestingly, serotype II FCoVs do not contain an S1/S2 cleavage site, do not apparently utilize heparan sulfate, and use feline aminopeptidase N (fAPN), a different entry receptor than serotype I FCoV (Hohdatsu et al., 1998) . As such, TC adaptation of serotype II FIPV strains does not typically correspond with a loss in pathogenicity (Tekes et al., 2012; Thiel et al., 2014) suggesting that maintenance of the natural receptor-entry route may allow recovery of pathogenic type I strains. Thus, increasing the expression of S1/S2targeting host enzymes such as TMPRSS2 may lead to more efficient recovery of clinical type I FIPV strains (Fig. 5, bottom right) . Together, the results presented here describe the successful disruption of the IFN\u03b1R in two feline cell lines and suggest that overexpression of feline proteases, in at least one of these cell lines, may be useful for enhancing infection of serotype I FCoVs. Importantly these data also demonstrate the genetic malleability of the Fcwf-4 CU cells and, to our knowledge, represent the first genetically-modified Fcwf-4 cell line. Thus, both the AK-D 2.2 and the Fcwf-4 IRN cells will be useful in future studies evaluating feline viruses that lack IFN antagonists and may be an important tool for isolating serotype I FCoVs from clinical samples.",

A dsDNA gBlocks\u00ae (IDT) fragment containing the coding sequence of feline TMPRSS2 variant 1 (GenBank accession # XM_023238709.1) was designed with several modifications for cloning into the pLVX-Puro vector. A Kozak consensus sequence was added to the 5\u2032 end, while the 3\u2032 end contains a 3 nt spacer sequence followed by an in-frame V5 tag coding region. The plasmid carrying this sequence was termed pLVX-fTMPRSS2(V5)-puroR + . Transducing particles (TPs) carrying the pLVX-fTMPRSS2(V5)-puroR + plasmids were generated by transfecting 3.3 \u03bcg each of pLVX-fTMPRSS2(V5)-puroR + , psPax2, and pHEF-VSV-G plasmid DNAs into 10 cm dishes containing 5.0 \u00d7 10 6 HEK-293T/ 17 cells using polyethylenimine (PEI) (5 \u03bcg PEI/1 \u03bcg DNA) in antibioticfree DMEM containing 10% FBS for 24 h followed by replacement with DMEM containing 10% FBS with antibiotics. After 48 h, supernatants containing TPs were collected and stored at 4\u00b0C and cells were replenished with 10 mL DMEM containing 5% FBS with antibiotics. After an additional 24-h incubation (72 h total) at 37\u00b0C and 5% CO 2 , supernatants were collected and combined with the previously collected lot. Total supernatants were centrifuged 1000 xg at 4\u00b0C for 10 min to remove cell debris, then centrifuged for 16 h at 5000 x g and 4\u00b0C. To concentrate, supernatants were poured off and pellets were suspended in one tenth the original volume using EMEM. For expression of feline TMPRSS2(V5), transducing particles were diluted 1:5 in serum-free EMEM and a minimal volume was incubated with Fcwf-4 IRN cells for 1 h at 37\u00b0C and 5% CO 2 followed by addition of EMEM containing 6.25% FBS.

For Western blot, lysates were sonicated, and 5.0 \u00d7 10 4 cellequivalents were separated through 7-15% acrylamide Mini-PROTEAN\u00ae TGX\u2122 precast SDS-PAGE gels (Bio-Rad) then transferred to PVDF membranes using a semi-dry Trans-Blot\u00ae Turbo\u2122 transfer system (Bio-Rad). Membranes were blocked at 4\u00b0C overnight in 5% milk in TBST followed by 90 min room temperature incubation in primary antibodies specific for TMPRSS2(V5) tag (murine anti-V5 monoclonal IgG; Fisher Scientific #R96025) or \u03b2-actin (murine anti-actin monoclonal IgG; Genscript #A00702-40) diluted 1:2500 and 1:5000, respectively, in 5% milk-TBST.

A)Fcwf-4 CU, Fcwf-4 CU 2.2 Poly, Fcwf-4 CU 2.2 clones 1, 2 and 3 (IRN cells) were treated with 0 or 1000 U feline IFN\u03b1 for 6 h and ISG54 transcripts were measured by qPCR. B) FIPV Black growth kinetics (MOI = 0.1) at indicated hours post-infection (HPI) in Fcwf-4 CU and IRN cells. C) Nucleocapsid gene transcript levels measured by qPCR during FIPV Black infection (MOI = 0.1) of Fcwf-4 CU or IRN cells. D) FIPV Black growth kinetics (MOI = 0.01) in indicated cells pre-treated with 0 or 1000 U feline IFN\u03b1 for 8 h. E) Plaque formation induced by FIPV Black in Fcwf-4 CU or IRN cells at 3-4 days post-infection (DPI). Wells display 10 \u2212 5 virus dilution. F) Plaque sizes (mm 2 ) measured from FIPV Black plaque assays (6-well plates) at 3 and 4 DPI on Fcwf-4 CU and IRN indicator cells at 10 \u2212 5 and 10 \u2212 6 virus dilutions. For mRNA expression, Ct values were normalized to \u03b2-actin using the 2 \u2212\u0394Ct method and presented as fold expression over mock (A) or relative expression (B). Data represent 3 independent experiments in triplicate. Mean \u00b1 SD analyzed by unpaired t-tests. Viral titers (B and D) were calculated from triplicate plaque assays per time point on Fcwf-4 CU indicator cells and represent 3 independent experiments.
