            "text": "considered to be either neonates of a much larger species or mammals that had lost their fur as a consequence of disease. Subsequent collections and descriptions were reported in the 1890s through 1957 and are summarized by Brett (1986) . Most of those studies focused upon the unusual anatomy of this species and morphological adaptations to life underground. Jennifer Jarvis began studying these animals in the late 1960s and was the first person to bring these hairless rodents into the laboratory. She observed that these animals were highly social and appeared to work together to excavate tunnels and find food. She also noted that she seldom found pregnant animals in the wild and even in captivity had little success with the formation and maintenance of breeding colonies. Subsequently, a group of biologists primarily working with Jarvis (Brett, Buffenstein, Clarke, Faulkes) began studying and reporting on their unique biology. In the mid 1970s, Alexander, an evolutionary biologist whose research focused on the evolution of eusociality (a colonial lifestyle with a strict division of labor culminating in the presence of a single breeding female), described the ideal hypothetical eusocial mammal. At that time no eusocial mammals had yet been identified and only the wasps, ants, and bees were known to be eusocial. He described his hypothetical eusocial mammal as strictly subterranean, living in hard soils and cooperatively foraging on large underground tubers. A colleague and friend of Jarvis, TL Vaughan, told Alexander that he had aptly described the naked mole rat, rodents that Vaughan had seen in the office of Jarvis. Alexander, his doctoral student Sherman, and Jarvis thereafter began an extensive collaborative study on eusociality and behavior in the naked mole rat.",

            "text": "Biologists Bennett, Clarke, Faulkes, O'Riain, and Sherman have contributed greatly to the understanding of naked mole rat behavior. Buffenstein studied with Jarvis and accompanied her on her trip to Kenya in 1980 to assess if naked mole rats in the wild also live in colonies with only one breeding female. Jarvis published this seminal finding in Science in 1981 (Jarvis, 1981) . Her team published extensively on ecophysiological responses which allow naked mole rats to survive and thrive in their dark, dank environment in the arid and semiarid regions of northeast Africa. These responses include mineral metabolism in the absence of sunlight , kidney function (Urison and Buffenstein, 1994) , thermoregulation Withers and Jarvis, 1980) , gastrointestinal function , microecological aspects of the naked mole rat (Bennett and Jarvis, 1995) , and finally the biological characteristics that contribute to the exceptional longevity of this, the longest-lived rodent known. Naked mole rats have been documented to live longer than 30 years in the lab . More recently, neurophysiologists (Catania, Comer, Crish, Goldman, and Park) have analyzed the nervous system of these animals and have identified many unique neurological features that allow these animals to thrive in their environment. One of the interesting aspects of the naked mole rat nervous system is their lack of ability to sense chemical pain (capsaicin and acid) and inflammatory pain (Park et al., 2008) , although they respond normally to acute pinch and heat (Kanue and Hole, 1990; Kanui et al., 1993; Park et al., 2008; Towett et al., 1993) .",

            "text": "Naked mole rats belong to the order Rodentia in that they have two incisor teeth on the upper and lower arcade that continuously grow. They are in the family Bathyergidae which includes six extant genera (Kock et al., 2006) , and includes solitary (Bathyergus; Georychus; Heliophobius), and social taxa (Cryptomys, Fukomys and Heterocephalus) . The Suborder is difficult to classify since the criteria for classification are the origination of the masseter muscle and the degree to which the muscle passes through the infraorbital foramen. The Bathyergidae have a small infraorbital foramen and the masseter muscle does not enter into it. Nonetheless, the lateral angle of the jaw relative to the plane of the incisor teeth appears more hystricomorph-like than Myomorph or Sciuromorph. In addition, the Bathyergidae share several Hystricognath features which include similar fetal membranes and sacculus rethralis, a fused malleus and incus, an anterior opening in the pterygoid foss, multiserial incisor enamel, the loss of the internal carotid artery, and albumin immunology . Taxonomists thus classify the Bathyergidae in the suborder Hystricognathi. This suborder consists of three super families (the Phiomorpha (e.g. mole rats, rock rats, and cane rats), Caviomorpha (e.g., guinea pigs), and Hystricidae (e.g. porcupines). Interestingly, most hystricognath rodents are found in the western hemisphere, and there are no close relationships between members of the Bathyergidae family and other hystricomorph families.",

Some tunnels are more permanent (highways) while others near the periphery and surface are opened and closed depending on the needs of the colony. The more superficial tunnels are used for gathering food from tuberous plants, and may be used during behavioral thermoregulaion by animals basking in warmer regions of the burrow system. These near-surface tunnels also serve as a path to eliminate soil from new burrows.

There is, however, strong evidence that there is an outbreeding dispersomorph caste with a morphologically, physiologically, and behaviorally distinct phenotype (O'Riain et al., 1996) . This disperser caste may occasionally promote outbreeding in naked mole rats, especially in those colonies that are not successfully reproducing. These dispersers are unwilling to engage in colony maintenance, are laden with fat, especially in the neck and pelvic regions, exhibit elevated levels of luteinizing hormone, and solicit mating behaviors with non-colony members and as such are readily accepted by foreign colonies. In captivity, these animals are often seen standing on their hind limbs, trying to escape from the colony and it seems that if there is a colony escapee it is usually a member of this caste.",

            "text": "Naked mole rats have low metabolic rates, approximately 70% of that of similar-sized rodents . Outside the confines of their warm, humid equatorial burrows, naked mole rats cannot regulate their body temperature over a broad range of environmental temperatures (12-37\u00b0C) and are thus considered poikilotherms (Buffenstein and Yahov, 1991; Hislop and Buffenstein, 1994) . Indeed both their metabolic and body temperature profiles at temperatures below 28\u00b0C, closely track that expected for a similarsized lizard. At temperatures above 29\u00b0C, they display a typical mammalian endothermic pattern with the highest metabolic rate at the lowest temperature and a decline in metabolic rate, with the lowest rate at temperatures between 31-34\u00b0C; temperatures considered the apparent themoneutral zone (McNab, 1966) . The relative increase in metabolic rate from 29-32\u00b0C is similar to that observed in mice housed within their thermoneutral zone and in a refrigerator at 4\u00b0C. Hence, given their lack of insulatory pelage, naked mole rats have a much narrower window in which they can thermoregulate relative to other mammals. Indeed it is only at subzero temperatures that mice show the similar hypothermic \"reptilian\" response of a decline in metabolism and body temperature as conditions become colder. At temperatures above 29\u00b0C, naked mole rats employ non-shivering thermogenesis (Hislop and Buffenstein, 1994) initiated by catecholaminergic innervation of interscapular brown fat (Daly et al., 1997) . Brown fat is also found in the neck, inguinal, axillary, and perirenal areas. This can generate heat and may maintain a constant body temperature if the animals are housed in large groups in a humid environment that prevents evaporative cooling. Naked mole rats naturally have low thyroid hormone levels, in keeping with the warm temperatures they encounter in burrows or under institutional housing conditions. However, they show increased thyroid activity if housed in the cold for prolonged periods, thus conforming to general mammalian cold acclimation trends .",

Having the teeth external enables the animals to dig without the earth coming inside the mouth. Naked mole rats have either two or three molar teeth. The mandibles connect at their anterior extent by a flexible mandibular symphysis, allowing the lower incisor teeth to move independently and provide a greater range of movements and dexterity than is typical of most mammals (Catania and Remple, 2002) . The incisor teeth appear to be greatly involved in somatosensory perception (Henry et al., 2006) . The parotid, submandibular, and sublingual salivary glands are all well developed (Hill et al., 1955) . The esophagus of the naked mole rat has keratinized stratified squamous epithelium and smooth muscle surrounding it. The stomach is monogastric. The length of the small intestine is relatively short, and leads into a very large cecum (Rechkemmer et al., 1988) . The intestinal mucosa does not have distinct subdivisions based on duodenal, jejunal, or ileal villar length. The cecum accounts for 8% of the body weight . Despite the fact that members of the Bathyergidae are strictly herbivorous and eat a diet high in fiber, they nevertheless exhibit the highest digestive efficiency of all mammals (Bennett and Jarvis, 1995) . This is primarily due to comparatively long retention times in the gut and highly efficient microbial fermentation processes in the cecum Porter, 1957) coupled with coprophagy.",

In the naked mole rat, the left precaval vein is retained and is larger than the right precaval vein (Hill et al., 1955) .

The presence of pigment-containing cells in the dermis, rather than the epidermis, which is typical of most mammals, also reflects an environment devoid of sunlight. The lack of fur is compensated by a thicker epidermal layer and a marked reduction in sweat glands. In contrast to having fur composed of numerous short hairs, the naked mole rat has an array of sparsely distributed long vibrissa-like hairs (Crish et al., 2003; Daly and Buffenstein, 1998) . The follicles of these body hairs are exceptionally large and well-innervated, similar to guard hair of furred species (Figure 45.4) .

Given the high humidity in their burrows in the wild, this may be adequate for both pulmonary and cutaneous evaporative water loss.

In contrast to rat and mouse lungs, the terminal bronchiole is ectatic; and alveolar ducts are short or non-existent, allowing alveolar sacs to branch almost directly from the terminal bronchioles. Terminal bronchioles are lined by cuboidal epithelium, the alveoli by flattened type I pneumocytes. Thus the most distal alveolar spaces abut the pleura and connect with the terminal bronchioles.

When given a physiologically determined dose of human insulin, blood glucose rapidly drops to extremely low levels (20 mg/dl) and remains there for several hours. The exquisite sensitivity to human insulin coupled with the abnormal glucose tolerance test and undetectable levels of insulin suggest that naked mole rats naturally only produce small quantities of this hormone and that this is usually sufficient for their needs, given their predominant reliance on volatile fatty acids produced during fermentation for their energy requirements. As such, they are unable to regulate blood glucose when given a supraphysiological dose of sugar.",

The eye contains 11-cis retinal, the chromophore of visual pigment. The optic nerve cross-sectional area is 10% of the gerbil and had an ERG response typical of other mammals but extremely attenuated and with much slower kinetics (Hetling et al., 2005) . They display a variable degree of retinal detachment which may be associated with the less than gelatinous nature of the vitreous humor (Hetling et al., 2005; Nikitina et al., 2004) . The superior collicullus and lateral geniculate nucleus are very small in the naked mole rat . Collectively these findings show that the retinogeniculocortical system in the naked mole rat is considerably smaller than that of rodents that rely heavily on their visual system, but is nevertheless less regressed than that of the extensively studied blind mole rat; this may facilitate limited responses to visual stimuli (Xiao et al., 2006) .

Naked mole rats are the longest-lived rodents known, living approximately 30 years in captivity; 5.3 times longer than predicted on the basis of body size and nine times longer than similar-sized laboratory mice. In captivity both breeders and non-breeders have similar maximum lifespan, whereas in the wild the more protected breeders live considerably longer (17 years; S. Braude, personal communication) than working, predationvulnerable subordinates (4 years). Not only do naked mole rats have an extraordinarily long lifespan but they show sustained good health for at least 85% of their maximum longevity and show no age-associated acceleration in mortality risk. From the age of 2 to 20 years naked mole rats maintain lean muscle mass (O'Connor et al., 2002) , bone health (Pinto et al., 2009) , mitochondrial mass, and enzyme activities (Ungvari et al., 2008) . Furthermore they sustain their metabolic rate (O'Connor et al., 2002) , level of gastrointestinal absorption (Yang and Buffenstein, 2002) , and cardiovascular youthfulness (Csiszar et al., 2007) in addition to their level of activity and reproductive potential well into their third decade (Buffenstein, 2008) .",

Naked mole rats also support the environmentally selected lifespan theory which posits that animals that live where resource availability is unpredictable will exhibit extended longevity. The life history of naked mole rats provides some support for this theory: location of food is a random, blind, and energetically costly process and food resources are patchily distributed. The low metabolic rate of NMRs may help them survive periods of limited resources. Extended longevity, like lower extrinsic mortality, is correlated with group-living, such that cave-roosting bats, social insects, and humans all have long lifespans. The cellular, molecular, and biochemical mechanisms facilitating this extended longevity, good health, and delayed aging are however poorly understood.",

Vermiculite and corn cob bedding are particularly harsh. Some types of paper bedding produce fine particles of dust that may block noses and irritate eyes of naked mole rats. A highly absorbent material should be placed in the toilet chamber and paper towel, tissues, and corn husks should be given in addition for nesting.

Enrichment for naked mole rats includes offering nesting materials for making a nest, increased cage complexity (Figure 45 .6) that would include multiple pipe connections or soils in which to burrow. One strategy is to provide un-husked corn. The animals eat the corn and make a nest out of the husk material. Naked mole rats are relentless chewers and constantly gnaw at the corners of chambers. Blocking tubes with whole corn or yams will stimulate burrowing behavior in the tubes and may possibly reduce repairs to the housing structure.

Gaseous anesthesia is preferred and dosages of analgesics are much lower than dog dosages. In addition, the greater amount of time the naked mole rat is removed from the colony, the greater the chance of queen aggression on the animal. Gloves should be cleaned before removing the animal, minimal disinfectants should be used that would impart a foreign scent, and post-procedural monitoring should be performed to be the sure the animal is not killed after reintroduction. One tactic is to roll the animal in the toilet area before placing it back in the colony. Animals that are mobbed by colony members after reintroduction should be removed again. Some shoving by the queen is acceptable and usually does not last long.",

The absence of these neuropeptides in naked mole rats may be related to the finding that naked mole rats are the only known mammalian poikilotherms, and they may not require cutaneous vasodilation to regulate body temperature. Cutaneous vasodilation in other mammals is mediated by nerve cells that release SP and CGRP onto small arteries in the skin to increase regional blood flow and heat transfer. Of interest, naked mole rats have SP/CGRP innervation to mesenteric arteries, which presumably subserves regulation of blood flow related to digestion . SP and CGRP have been implicated in a direct effector role in tissue maintenance. Absence of this peptidergic innervation raises questions about the capacity of the skin of naked mole rats to respond to insult and could explain the extreme susceptibility to herpes simplex I administered cutaneously (Artwohl et al., 2009 ).",

Suboptimal skeletal development during puberty affects long-term bone strength, leading to an increase in fracture risk later in life (Yingling et al., 2008) . Current animal models to study delayed puberty and hypogonadism have several drawbacks. Ovariectomy models often manifest with high GnRH, since it is inhibition by sex steroids and inhibition is reduced, whereas GnRH antagonists affect not only the entire hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis, but also have a tendency to increase body weight, serum IGF-1 levels, and complete suppression of the onset of puberty is dose-dependent (Roth et al., 2000; Yingling and Taylor, 2008) . While these studies have yielded considerable information in this regard, the short-term nature of these studies as well as the extended duration of bone remodeling and turnover, limits these studies in what they can tell us about \"catch-up\" growth or chronic hypogonadism and begs the question of whether or not there is a natural animal model for long-term hypogonadic effects on bone.",

This activation of gonadal activity and fertility is extremely rapid, especially when considering that non-breeders may have been reproductively suppressed for many years, and even 24-year-old females are capable of exhibiting rapid changes from reproductive suppression to ovarian cycling. Further studies in which hormone status may be experimentally manipulated in young individuals both prior to and after attainment of adult mass may shed more light as to whether or not bone morphology and mechanical properties are sustained by sex steroid hormone-independent mechanisms. Elucidating the mechanisms facilitating sustained bone structure and strength in hypogonadic subordinates may yield pivotal insights into potential mechanisms and therapies for sustaining bone in delayed puberty and exercise-induced hypogonadism.",

Use of short-lived species enables rapid evaluation of whether experimental manipulation of environmental (e.g., caloric restriction (CR)) and/or genetic factors alter lifespan (Miller and Nadon, 2000) . Although we recognize the many advances in understanding aging processes in these short-lived models, we do not know if their lifespan extension mechanisms are pertinent to long-lived mammals, such as humans, that naturally age slowly. Long-lived species may possess certain traits germane to retarding aging that enable them to attain their impressive longevity (Austad, 2009 ).
