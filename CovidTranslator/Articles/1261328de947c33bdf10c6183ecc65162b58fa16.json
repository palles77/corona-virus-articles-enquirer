Until the advent of the antibiotic era, Group A Streptococcus was a major cause of death in industrialized countries as a result of sepsis, rheumatic heart disease and fatal epidemics of scarlet fever [1, 2] . The 1980s saw an increase in rheumatic fever cases in the Rocky Mountain states of the USA, along with an apparent resurgence in severe Group A Streptococcus disease in industrialized countries. The resultant increased attention paid to Group A Streptococcus disease in recent years has also brought to focus the continuing high burden of Group A Streptococcus disease in developing countries, particularly those in tropical regions [3] .",

Surface proteins facilitate specific adhesion of Group A Streptococcus to either the mucosal epithelium of the throat or to the skin (or both). A number of additional cellular products appear to facilitate direct spread of the invading organism through tissue planes and bacteremia can result in hematogenous dissemination.

Non-suppurative complications include scarlet fever, acute rheumatic fever or acute post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis. Scarlet fever is characterized by a diffuse blanching rash that spreads from the chest to the abdomen and extremities leaving a sandpaper-like texture to the skin. Desquamation of the fingers, toes, groin and axilla occurs one or more weeks later. The tongue is frequently coated in a white film (white strawberry tongue) that eventually gives way to a beefy red appearance (red strawberry tongue).

Cellulitis involves the deeper subcutaneous tissues causing a more diffuse and less clearly demarcated area of inflammation.

Chorea and insidious carditis can occur as a manifestation of acute rheumatic fever in the absence of other features. Severe or recurrent episodes of acute rheumatic fever may result in progressive damage to the mitral valve (and sometimes the aortic valve) resulting in incompetence and progressive heart failure (rheumatic heart disease). Over several years, the valve may eventually become stenotic. Acute post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis can occur 1-2 weeks after or days of onset. Initially, the overlying skin is relatively spared and severe escalating pain may be disproportionate to clinical findings. The skin subsequently becomes violaceous and bullae may form and then slough. STSS is characteristically associated with Group A Streptococcus necrotizing fasciitis, although it may arise in the setting of other invasive Group A Streptococcus infections.

Historically, outbreaks of Group A Streptococcus pneumonia were reported among previously healthy adults, although more recent reports have described the highest risk amongst the elderly and those with underlying medical conditions; infection in these individuals is often associated with high case fatality [9] . A viral prodrome is often reported, although the onset of fever, chest pain and dyspnea is characteristically rapid. Group A Streptococcus pneumonia may be necrotizing with pleural effusions frequently present early and early complications include lung abscess formation, mediastinitis and pericarditis. Group A Streptococcus is an uncommon cause of meningitis in children and adults, with most reports arising in individuals with throat infection or a few weeks after Group A Streptococcus skin infection. The features are hematuria (microscopic or gross), edema (which may be most evident peri-orbitally) and hypertension. Severe cases can also be complicated by encephalopathy. The illness is generally benign in childhood, but there may be an appreciable mortality among adults as a result of renal and congestive cardiac failure. Pediatric autoimmune neuropsychiatric disorders associated with streptococcal infections (PANDAS) is a term used to describe some children with tic or obsessive compulsive disorders in whom symptoms appear to develop or worsen following Group A Streptococcus infection. The existence of PANDAS is controversial [14] . Post-streptococcal reactive arthritis describes a syndrome of polyarthritis that differs from acute rheumatic fever by affecting a range of smaller joints, being relatively resistant to anti-inflammatory treatment and not being associated with carditis, although cases of acute rheumatic fever have been misdiagnosed as post-streptococcal reactive arthritis [15, 16] .",

However, chorea may also be a manifestation of systemic lupus erythematosus, neurovascular disease, drugs, thyrotoxicosis, Wilson's disease and a number of genetic neurodegenerative diseases that must be considered, especially where acute rheumatic fever is uncommon. Measles is associated with prodromal conjunctivitis and coryzal symptoms and Koplik spots. Rubella is associated with post-auricular lymphadenopathy l Parvovirus \"fifth disease or erythema infectiosum\" associated with distinctive \"slapped cheek\" rash of face and reticular rash of limbs appearing after fever resolution l Roseola rash associated with defervescence and affects younger children (infants) more than scarlet fever l Kawasaki disease (KD) and Still's disease (SD; systemic-onset juvenile rheumatoid arthritis) associated with multiple symptoms and prolonged fever (>5 days). KD is also associated with conjunctivitis, edema of the hands and feet, and stomatitis. SD is associated with transient or \"evanescent\" rash, lymphadenopathy, hepatosplenomegaly, uveitis, PSRA associated with small joints and absence of other clinical features of acute rheumatic fever or a propensity to rheumatic heart disease. A diagnosis of PSRA should rarely be made in populations with a high incidence of acute rheumatic fever, and all cases should be given at least 12 months of penicillin prophylaxis before re-evaluation l Neisseria gonorrhoeae may be multifocal and migratory, and must be considered if sexually active. Also associated with cutaneous lesions in disseminated disease. Culture of joint fluid is frequently negative The diagnosis of a primary episode of acute rheumatic fever is based on the most recent version of the Jones' criteria-currently the 1992 version (Table 36-3) . These clinical and investigational criteria have been repeatedly revised since the original 1944 version to maintain their positive predictive value in settings where incidence is decreasing. As a result, some high-burden settings have chosen to modify the revised criteria to retain their sensitivity and negative predictive value [18] .",

In low-incidence settings, the numbers needed to treat to prevent complications is likely to be very large, so the main aim of antibiotic treatment, if chosen to be used, is alleviation of symptoms and shortening of the duration of illness. However, antibiotic treatment of Group A Streptococcus pharyngitis is essential in populations with a high incidence of acute rheumatic fever and, if diagnostic facilities are limited, empirical treatment of all sore throat cases may be justified. There is little evidence that antibiotics reduce the risk of subsequent acute poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis.",

For example, an anti-staphylococcal penicillin or a first-generation cephalosporin is required to cover both Group A Streptococcus and S. aureus in cellulitis (see Table 36 -4). Where methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) is prevalent, clindamycin may be an acceptable alternative if prevailing MRSA strains are susceptible.

However, some authorities have suggested that a less aggressive approach may be acceptable if antibiotics and adjunctive therapy with intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) are instituted early [22] . Clindamycin is recommended as an adjunct to penicillin for the treatment of severe invasive Group A Streptococcus disease, including necrotizing infections, during the first few days of treatment-this is supported by the superior activity of clindamycin over penicillin in animal models [19] . However, penicillin should always be given unless there is a history of hypersensitivity. Although supportive data are limited, administration of 1 or 2 doses of IVIG early in the course of STSS is widely recommended. A multicenter, randomized, controlled trial revealed a trend toward a reduction in mortality among recipients, but the study was terminated early because of slow recruitment [23] . IVIG is also recommended by some as adjunctive treatment in severe invasive Group A Streptococcus infections, even in the absence of toxic shock. Management of acute rheumatic fever is primarily symptomatic. Penicillin is generally given to eradicate colonization, although acute infection has usually passed by the time symptoms of acute rheumatic fever develop. Salicylates are used to relieve fever and the pain from arthritis that is often severe. Where necessary, cardiac failure is managed with diuretics and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors. Steroids are sometimes used in cases of severe carditis, although there is no evidence that they improve the long-term outcome in RHD. Mitral valve repair, balloon valvuloplasty, or valve replacement may be required to manage patients with severe valve disease in rheumatic heart disease.",
