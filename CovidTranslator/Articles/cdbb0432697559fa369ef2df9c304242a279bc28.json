The histologic structure varies greatly by anatomic site and among different species of animals. The haired skin is thickest over the dorsal aspect of the body and on the lateral aspect of the limbs and is thinnest on the ventral aspect of the body and the medial aspect of the thighs. Haired skin has a thinner epidermis, whereas nonhaired skin of the nose and pawpads has a thicker epidermis (see Figs. 17-1 and 17-2) . The skin of large animals is generally thicker than the skin of small animals. The subcutis, consisting of lobules of adipose tissue and fascia, connects the more superficial layers (epidermis and dermis) with the underlying fascia and musculature.",

The epidermis of haired skin consists of four basic layers: stratum corneum, stratum granulosum, stratum spinosum, and stratum basale ( Fig. 17-3) . The epidermis of hairless skin has an additional layer, the stratum lucidum, which is located between the stratum granulosum and stratum corneum (see Fig. 17 -2). Keratinocytes originate from germinal cells in the stratum basale of the epidermis, ascend through the layers of the epidermis, changing in appearance and other characteristics in each layer until they reach the stratum corneum as fully cornified, dead corneocytes. Keratinocytes are continuously shed from the stratum corneum. The transit time for a keratinocyte from the stratum basale to shed in the stratum corneum is approximately 1 month, although this time can be accelerated in some disorders such as primary seborrhea characterized clinically by scaling.",

The next layer is the stratum granulosum, which consists of cells containing basophilic keratohyalin granules. In nonhaired skin the stratum corneum and stratum granulosum are separated by an additional layer of compacted, fully cornified cells, the stratum lucidum (see Fig. 17 -2), best seen in the pawpad. This layer has a translucent appearance due to the presence of eleidin, a protein similar to keratin, but with different staining affinity. Deep to the stratum granulosum is the stratum spinosum, a layer of polyhedral-shaped cells attached to one another by desmosomes. During fixation and processing for microscopic examination, the cells of the stratum spinosum contract, except for the desmosomal attachments. These attachment sites create the appearance of \"spines\" or intercellular bridges, leading to the name of this layer. The visibility of the intercellular bridges is enhanced when there is intercellular edema of the epidermis. The stratum spinosum in haired areas is thicker in horses, cattle, and pigs and is thinner in dogs and cats. The innermost layer of the epidermis is the germinal layer, or stratum basale, which consists of a single layer of cuboidal cells resting on a basement membrane.

Langerhans cells are bone marrow-derived cells of monocyte-macrophage lineage that process and present antigen to sensitized T lymphocytes, thereby modulating immunologic responses of the skin. Langerhans cells are present in the basal, spinous, and granular layers of the epidermis but have a preference for a suprabasal position. Merkel cells are located in the basal layer, attach to keratinocytes via desmosomal junctions, and express keratin proteins 8, 18, 19, and 20. Merkel cells are located in haired and hairless skin, particularly in regions of the body with high tactile zone is composed of hemidesmosomes of basal cells (i.e., keratin intermediate filaments and attachment plaques), the lamina lucida (cell membrane, subdesmosomal dense plate, and anchoring filaments), and the lamina densa (i.e., type IV collagen), which also serve to anchor the epidermis to dermis (Fig. 17-4) . The importance of the basement membrane in anchoring function is noted in some immune-mediated diseases in which antibodies target, bind, and ultimately damage a component in the basement membrane and result in the formation of bullae (see the discussion on reactions characterized grossly by vesicles or bullae as the primary lesion and histologically by vesicles or bullae within the basement membrane [bullous dermatoses] in the section on Selected Autoimmune Reactions). The basement membrane zone also serves as a scaffold for migration of epidermal cells in wound healing and as an initial barrier to invasion of the dermis by neoplastic cells originating in the epidermis.",

By convention the dermis is generally subdivided into superficial and deep layers that blend together without a clear line of demarcation. The superficial dermis conforms to the contour of the epidermis and generally supports the upper sensitivity (digits and lips), and in the outer portion of hair follicles. When Merkel cells are associated with an axon, they form a Merkel cell-neurite complex and function as a slowly adapting mechanoreceptor. The specialized areas of the skin containing these Merkel cell-neurite complexes are known as tylotrich pads (hair disks, tactile pads). The axon associated with the Merkel cell is myelinated but near the epidermis, the myelin sheath is lost, and the nerve fibers terminate at the basal aspect of the Merkel cell. Merkel cells have granules that contain chemical mediators (metenkephalin, vasoactive intestinal peptide, chromogranin A, acetylcholine, calcitonin gene-related peptide, neuron-specific enolase, and synaptophysin). In addition to functioning as mechanoreceptors, Merkel cells may also influence keratinocyte proliferation, stimulate and maintain hair follicle stem cells, and alter blood flow and sweat production. The origin of Merkel cells is thought to be a primitive epidermal stem cell.",

            "text": "The epidermis and dermis are separated by a basement membrane. In hairless areas, such as the pawpads and nasal planum, this junction is irregular because of epidermal projections (e.g., rete pegs/also known as rete ridges or rete processes) that interdigitate with dermal papillae, thus strengthening the dermal-epidermal attachment by providing resistance to shearing. In densely haired areas the junction is smoother and has an undulating appearance because the dermalepidermal attachment is strengthened by the hair follicles. The more sparsely haired skin of pigs has more dermal-epidermal interdigitations (rete pegs) and fewer hair follicles. The basement membrane in haired skin has an undulating surface but lacks rete pegs (ridges or processes). The epidermis in haired skin has fewer nucleated cell layers than the epidermis in nonhaired (hairless) skin such as that on the nose and pawpads (see Fig. 17 -2); thus it is referred to as \"thin\" skin. Hair follicles (H), apocrine glands (A), and sebaceous glands (S) are present. Rete peg formation is not required because the hair follicles strengthen the attachment between the epidermis and dermis. The haired skin is thickest over the dorsal aspect of the body and on the lateral aspect of the limbs, and it is thinnest on the ventral aspect of the body and the medial aspect of the thighs. H&E stain. in hairless (nonhaired) skin has more nucleated cell layers, a thicker stratum corneum, and an additional layer termed the stratum lucidum (SL), than the epidermis in haired skin; thus it is referred to as \"thick\" skin. Note the dense zone of compact stratum corneum (SC) over the surface. The epidermal pegs (arrows) and dermal papillae in the superficial dermis (D) interdigitate and thus strengthen the attachment between the epidermis and dermis. Also note that in the pawpad of the dog, the contour of the cornified surface follows the epidermal contour and thus is papillated. H&E stain. (Courtesy Dr. Ann M. Hargis, DermatoDiagnostics.)

The nerve endings consist of Meissner's corpuscles, Pacini's or pacinian corpuscles, free sensory nerve endings, and mucocutaneous end organs (similar to Meissner's corpuscles but located in mucocutaneous skin). These nerve endings are minute, and the free sensory nerve endings are so delicate that they require special staining techniques, such as silver impregnation, to be visualized microscopically. The sensations of itch, pain, touch, temperature, and displacement of body hair are detected by the free sensory nerve endings. Itching, a form of mild pain that promotes the desire to scratch, is one of the most common reasons animals are presented to veterinarians. The sensations of pressure and touch are detected by Meissner's and Pacini's corpuscles. Sensations detected by free sensory nerve endings and by the corpuscles are transmitted to the spinal cord via the dorsal root ganglia. Sensory fibers to facial skin are supplied by the trigeminal nerve. Motor fibers (adrenergic and cholinergic) are supplied by the sympathetic component of the autonomic nervous system (see . Adrenergic fibers travel from the spinal cord through postganglionic fibers in peripheral nerves and arborize into plexuses that innervate blood portion of the hair follicle and sebaceous glands. It is composed of fine collagen fibers and is thicker in the skin of horses and cattle than in the skin of dogs and cats. The deep dermis supports the lower portion of the hair follicle and apocrine glands and is composed of collagen bundles larger than those in the superficial dermis. Smooth muscle fibers of the arrector pili muscle attach the connective tissue sheath of the hair follicle to the epidermis and are responsible for causing the hair to stand erect. Skeletal muscle fibers from the cutaneous muscle extend into the lower dermis and are responsible for voluntary skin movement. Mast cells, lymphocytes, plasma cells, macrophages, and rarely eosinophils and neutrophils can be found in normal dermis. These cells are bone marrow-derived cells and arrive via the blood vascular system; thus they are typically concentrated around small superficial blood vessels.",

Secondary hair follicles are generally smaller than primary follicles and produce secondary hairs (also called undercoat hairs or wool fibers). They have a hair bulb located superficially in the dermis, may have a sebaceous gland but lack an apocrine gland and arrector pili muscle. Simple hair follicles have a single hair shaft that emerges from the follicle opening through the epidermis, and may be either a primary or secondary type of follicle. In contrast, compound hair follicles have multiple hair shafts, either one primary and more numerous secondary hairs, or multiple secondary hairs only, that emerge from one follicle opening through the epidermis (see Table 17 -1). The follicles forming a compound follicle each have their own lower segment, and they are joined at the level of the sebaceous duct to form a single common opening to the skin surface.",

Sinus hairs, also termed whiskers or vibrissae, arise in simple follicles with a blood-filled sinus located between the inner and outer layers of the dermal sheath. Sinus hairs generally occur on the nose, above the eyes, on the lips and throat, and, in cats, on the palmar aspect of the carpus. Tylotrich hairs also arise in simple follicles and are scattered among the regular vessels, arrector pili muscles, and apocrine sweat glands. Stimulation by these adrenergic fibers causes vasoconstriction and piloerection (raising of the hair shafts). Cholinergic fibers travel from the spinal cord and arborize into plexuses that innervate the eccrine sweat glands. In the haired skin, equine sweat glands are considered to be the epitrichial (apocrine) type, where the duct opens into the follicular canal near the skin surface, but less commonly the duct may open in a depression near the follicle opening or directly on the skin surface. As in human beings, sweating in the horse is important in thermoregulation. However, the precise mechanisms that control sweating in the horse are unknown. The horse has a rich supply of vessels and nerves around sweat glands. It appears that equine sweat gland secretion is controlled by an interaction among neural, humoral, and paracrine factors. The only other domestic animal in which apocrine gland secretion is thought to play a thermoregulatory role is cattle, but sweating is not typically clinically visible except in horses. Dogs and cats lack eccrine glands in haired skin; however, cholinergic and to a lesser degree adrenergic fiber stimulation in dogs and cats causes sweating of the eccrine glands of pawpads at times of excitement or agitation.",

In all species the bases of telogen follicles (resting follicles) are more superficially located than the bases of anagen follicles. Development of Hair Follicles and Hair Shafts. The postnatal hair follicle and hair shaft form by proliferation and differentiation of the hair matrix cells of the hair bulb into various layers of the follicle wall, and subsequent keratinization with cornification centrally to form the hair shaft. Briefly, during the anagen stage of the hair cycle, the hair matrix cells in the hair bulb proliferate and differentiate to form multiple distinct, concentric cell layers or \"sleeves\" that eventually form the hair follicle wall (Table 17 -2). The structure of the follicle wall from the inside out includes the hair shaft, the inner root sheath (IRS), the companion layer, the outer root sheath (ORS), the basement membrane, and the connective tissue sheath (CTS). The most centrally located hair matrix cells of the hair bulb form the hair shaft. If melanocytes are present in the hair bulb, melanin is transferred to the hair matrix cells that form the cortex and medulla of the hair shaft. As the cells that form the hair cortex cornify, they harden and die and are pushed upward toward the skin surface as the hair matrix cells in the hair bulb continue to proliferate, and a hair shaft is produced. Keratin proteins constitute the majority of the hair shaft and are stabilized mostly by disulfide bonds. These strong bonds link the keratin proteins together and confer durability and strength to the hair shaft. The hair cuticle also provides durability to the hair shaft via sulfur-rich keratinocyteassociated proteins and hydrophobicity to the hair surface via longchain fatty acids. The cells of the hair cuticle flatten and resemble scales as they emerge from the hair bulb. Similar to the cells that form the hair cortex, as the cuticle cells cornify, they can no longer body hairs. Each tylotrich hair is associated with a tylotrich pad, and together they function as mechanoreceptors.",

            "text": "Structural Subdivisions within Hair Follicles. Fully developed hair follicles are traditionally subdivided into three anatomic segments: superficial, middle, and deep. The superficial segment, or infundibulum, extends from the follicular opening on the surface of the epidermis to the level where the sebaceous duct enters the follicle. The cells of the infundibulum are identical to and continuous with those of the epidermis. They keratinize slowly and form a granular cell layer before cornifying (through a process termed infundibular cornification). The middle segment, or isthmus, is quite short and extends from the level of sebaceous duct to the attachment of the arrector pili muscle. The cells of the follicular isthmus keratinize without forming a granular cell layer before cornifying (through a process termed trichilemmal cornification). The deep, or inferior, segment consists of the follicle below the attachment of the arrector pili muscle and includes the hair bulb, which consists of the hair matrix cells that partially enclose the follicular papilla, also called the dermal papilla. Two patterns of keratinization with cornification occur in the inferior portion of the follicle. One form is hair matrix (trichogenic) cornification, which occurs abruptly (does not form a granular layer), retains the nuclear outlines of keratinocytes, and produces the cortex of the hair shaft. The other form is inner root sheath cornification, which is compact and opaque and consists of Henle's and Huxley's layers, which contain red, trichohyalin granules. Cornification of viable keratinocytes is first recognized in an area termed Adamson's fringe, the upper margin of the keratogenous zone located between the mitotically active hair bulb and the hair shaft.",

The IRS extends from the hair bulb to the follicular isthmus. It differentiates into three layers and has a variety of functions (see Table 17 -2). The hair shaft and IRS are securely anchored together by the interlocking of cuticle cells, so that during growth the hair shaft and IRS move upward though the follicle concurrently. The IRS gives the hair shaft its surface shape and features and serves as a rigid protective covering around the developing hair. The keratin proteins of the IRS and of the hair cortex are of different composition. The proteins of the IRS are degraded by proteases from the sebaceous gland, but those of the hair shaft are not degraded, thus allowing the hair shaft to emerge as an independent structure from the follicular opening.",

In the anagen stage of the hair cycle, mitotic activity and growth occur. The catagen stage is an apoptosis-driven regressing stage during which cellular proliferation ceases and the hair follicle cells are lost via programmed cell death. The hair follicle then enters a resting or relatively quiescent stage, telogen, after which mitotic activity and new hair production resumes. The kenogen stage refers to follicles that have lost their hair shaft and that remain empty for an indefinite period of time before anagen is reinitiated. This stage also has been referred to as \"hairless telogen.\" In many hair loss disorders in domestic animals, increased numbers of kenogen follicles are evident histologically.

Anagen is the longest stage of the cycle, and as a result human scalp hair grows almost constantly. In contrast, hair follicle growth occurs synchronously in many other mammals, resulting in periodic loss or shedding of the hair coat. Most mammals have a telogen-based hair cycle in which the hair shafts grow to a genetically predetermined length after which the follicle enters a prolonged stage of inactivity (telogen) and the hair shaft remains firmly attached to the follicle. The telogen-based hair cycle likely has an advantage in the conservation of protein and energy required for hair synthesis. There are exceptions to this general rule because some animals have continuously growing hair similar to scalp hair in human beings of the keratogenous zone, Adamson's fringe), the ORS cells have glycogen-rich cytoplasm that probably serves as a source of energy for the proliferative activities of the hair bulb and follicular cornification.

The hoof wall comprises three structurally distinct cornified layers, which from the outside in include the stratum externum, stratum medium, and stratum internum. The stratum externum is a thin flaky cornified layer that arises from the germinal cells (basal cells) of the epidermis of the periople (an area of modified skin above the coronary band of the hoof). Toward the back of the foot the periople expands to form a broad cornified area or bulb (heel) supported by corium (dermis). The stratum medium consists of tubular and intertubular horn (the hard cornified component, stratum corneum) that arises from the basal cells of the epidermis lining the coronary band, or coronet, and is the thickest layer of the hoof wall and the main load support structure of the equine foot. The coronary epidermis is supported by the coronary dermis, which forms long papillae that extend into the epidermis and that are oriented parallel to the outer surface of the hoof wall. The coronary basal cells at the distal tip and along the sides of the dermal papillae form the tubular horn (or horn tubules), which also are parallel to the outer hoof wall. In cross section, the tubular horn may be circular, oval, or wedge shaped and consists centrally of a loosely arranged medullary area bordered by three layers of tightly or more loosely coiled cortical cells. The coiled (or springlike) pattern of tubular horn helps reduce compressive forces of the hoof. The coronary basal cells of the interpapillary dermis form the intertubular horn, which surrounds the tubular horn. The stratum internum (stratum lamellatum) of the inner hoof wall is present from the deep edge of the coronary region to the sole. It is a complex structure composed of approximately 600 parallel, The stem cells in the ORS also become activated but proliferate later and more slowly (within anagen) probably to sustain hair follicle growth throughout the anagen phase. In addition to hair follicle stem cells, melanocyte stem cells also reside in the ORS and the secondary germ. During fetal development the melanocyte stem cells migrate from the neural crest and colonize the developing follicle. The melanocyte stem cells and the hair follicle stem cells are activated concurrently during anagen. The melanocyte stem cells provide the hair bulb with mature melanocytes that produce and transfer melanin to hair matrix cells and result in the formation of a pigmented hair shaft.",

Also, in disease states, cuticle formation can be defective, resulting in a dull or dry hair coat. Hair growth responds to photoperiods and to a lesser extent to ambient temperatures. Photoperiod effects act via the hypothalamus, pituitary, and pineal gland, which secrete tropic hormones, such as melatonin, prolactin, and the gonadal, thyroid, and adrenal hormones, that influence hair growth. Some hormones, such as thyroid and growth hormone, stimulate hair growth, whereas excessive concentrations of estrogen or glucocorticoids suppress hair growth.

For convenience and to provide quick reference, these terms are listed online in E-Glossary cornified primary epidermal lamellae that extend inward (toward the distal phalanx) from the stratum medium in which they are firmly incorporated or fused. Each primary epidermal lamella has approximately 150 to 200 outwardly radiating secondary epidermal lamellae, the dermal side of which orients toward the distal phalanx. The secondary epidermal lamellae consist of a central core of partially cornified spinous layer cells that attach at their apical surface to the sides of the primary epidermal lamellae, and a single layer of basal cells that attach to the subjacent secondary dermal lamellae via hemidesmosomes in the basement membrane (see Fig. 17-4) . The primary and secondary epidermal lamellae interdigitate with the primary and secondary dermal lamellae, providing a large surface area to the inner hoof wall. The blood vessels that nourish the epidermal cells are located in the dermal lamellae. On one side of the basement membrane the epidermal cells of the epidermal lamellae are firmly attached, and on the other side of the basement membrane the collagen fibers of the lamina densa and sublamina densa are tightly interwoven with the tendon-like connective tissue that is firmly attached to the parietal surface of the distal phalanx, thereby anchoring the inner hoof wall to the dermis that covers the distal phalanx. In this way the epidermal and dermal lamellae serve as the suspensory apparatus of the distal phalanx, and if the attachment of the epidermal and dermal lamellae fails, the shearing forces of body weight and movement can result in the separation of the distal phalanx from the inner hoof wall, which can lead to the painful condition of laminitis (also called laminopathy in some instances) most often seen in horses and cattle (see section on Cutaneous Manifestations of Systemic Disorders, Laminitis). The sole consists of epidermis that interdigitates with its supportive dermis, which blends with the periosteum of the distal surface of the distal phalanx. The sole epidermis forms the tubular and intertubular horn of the sole, the surface of which is loosely attached and can be easily removed as small flakes. At the junction of the sole epidermis and stratum lamellatum, the lamellar epidermis is redirected (changes orientation) toward the distal aspect of the foot, and the horn of the stratum lamellatum joins and interconnects with the tubular and intertubular horn of the sole epidermis. The horn from the lamellar epidermis has a different degree of compactness and orientation, which provides a different shade of color, and has been termed the white line or white zone. The color difference allows the hoof wall to be visually distinguished from the sole. The frog consists of tubular and intertubular horn that is softer than the horn of the sole and wall of the hoof, and that is supported by dermis that blends with the digital cushion, a wedge-shaped mass of collagen, elastic tissue, and adipose tissue that serves to help absorb the impact of walking and running.

Instead of a frog, ruminants and pigs have a prominent bulb lined by soft, thin cornified epidermis that is continuous with the skin and forms a large part of the distal hoof surface. 17-1. Although there are many new terms to learn, it should be realized that the system used to form these terms is similar to that used for other anatomic systems. Basically, prefixes and suffixes are added to word roots to create specific terms that define the pathology of the skin. For example, the prefix \"epi\" (meaning on or above) combined with the word root \"dermat(o)\" (referring to skin) creates the word \"epidermis,\" which simply means the portion of the skin above the dermis. Likewise, the term hypodermis refers to the portion of the skin below the dermis, also called the subcutis or panniculus. Suffixes are used in the same way. For example, the suffix \"itis\" (meaning inflammation) combined with the word root \"dermat(o)\" forms the word \"dermatitis,\" which simply means inflammation of the skin. Similarly, terms referring to inflammation predominantly within the epidermis, follicles, or the panniculus are epidermitis, folliculitis, and panniculitis, respectively. The suffix \"osis\" refers to a disease process, often noninflammatory. Thus combining dermat(o) and osis forms the word \"dermatosis,\" which means any disease of the skin, especially one not characterized by inflammation. The term \"dermatoses\" is the plural of dermatosis and thus typically means noninflammatory skin diseases. However, the term \"dermatoses\" is also used less specifically to refer to a group of skin disorders of a variety of types, such as immune-mediated dermatoses.",

Determining a definitive diagnosis of a skin disorder often depends on obtaining a complete history, including age, breed, and sex of the animal; conducting a thorough physical examination, paying particular attention to the distribution of skin lesions; and performing additional diagnostic tests, such as skin scrapings, surface cytologic examination, a complete blood cell count, serum chemistry panel, fecal examination (e.g., for hookworm parasite ova), skin biopsy sampling, and microbiologic cultures. Results from cutaneous biopsy sampling are often useful and can be necessary to establish a definitive diagnosis for skin diseases. Although the skin has a limited range of responses to injury, the distribution and types of inflammatory cells in the lesion often represent a recognizable pattern that can be used to (1) formulate a list of specific etiologic agents that could cause the lesion or (2) suggest categories of disease with similar lesions and a common pathogenesis. Algorithms (i.e., a set of directions for accomplishing some task that has a recognizable end point) have been developed for the recognition of histopathologic patterns in veterinary dermatopathology (Table 17-3) . Recognition of patterns, both clinically and histologically, can facilitate differential diagnoses of skin disease . Patterns of responses to injury are illustrated by changes in the epidermis, dermis, adnexa, and panniculus and are discussed in the next sections.",

The orderly proliferation, differentiation, and cornification of epidermal cells is regulated by cytokines (e.g., epidermal growth factor, fibroblast growth factors [FGFs] , insulin-like growth factors [ILGFs] , interleukins, and TNF), hormones (e.g., cortisol and vitamin D 3 ), and nutritional factors such as protein, zinc, copper, fatty acids, vitamin A, and B vitamins. The cytokines that regulate keratinocyte growth and differentiation are produced by a variety of cell types in the skin, including endothelial cells, leukocytes, fibroblasts, and keratinocytes.

Disorders of cornification (i.e., alterations in the formation of the stratum corneum) can be primary, such as occurs in primary seborrhea, but more often are secondary to a variety of factors such as inflammation, surface trauma, environmental conditions (e.g., low humidity), or metabolic or nutritional disorders. A disorder of cornification called hyperkeratosis is characterized by an increase in the thickness of the stratum corneum. There are two forms of hyperkeratosis, orthokeratotic and parakeratotic hyperkeratosis, which are distinguished by the completeness of the cornification process and whether the keratinocytes ultimately lose or retain their nucleus. In orthokeratotic hyperkeratosis (also referred to as hyperkeratosis), the keratinocytes undergo complete cornification and thus lose their nucleus to become anuclear, whereas in parakeratotic hyperkeratosis (also referred to as parakeratosis), the keratinocytes undergo only partial or incomplete cornification and thus retain their nucleus. Subtypes of hyperkeratosis include basket weave (exaggerated undulating pattern of layers of CHAPTER 17 The Integument A pattern consists of two parts: a component of the skin (e.g., epidermis) + a histologic reaction of that component to injury (e.g., hyperkeratosis) = pattern (hyperkeratotic diseases of the epidermis). Some of these disorders could be placed in different patterns. For instance, disorders characterized by vesicles or bullae may develop into an ulcerative pattern after the vesicles or bullae rupture. *Hyperkeratotic disorders may also affect the nasal planum and pawpads; see stratum spinosum, and is also referred to as acanthosis. Hyperplasia is a response common to a variety of stimuli, often chronic, and occurs in a variety of types, including regular, irregular, papillated, and pseudocarcinomatous (pseudoepitheliomatous) (Fig. 17-11 ). Some forms of epidermal hyperplasia (regular, irregular, and pseudocarcinomatous) can develop in sequence. In early stages of epidermal hyperplasia, the dermal-epidermal interface is mildly undulating, but as the hyperplasia progresses, there often is an elongation of the rete pegs that extend into the dermis and interdigitate with dermal papillae, and that can be regular or irregular. In regular epidermal hyperplasia the rete pegs are approximately evenly sized and shaped, whereas in irregular epidermal hyperplasia the rete pegs are less uniform. Pseudocarcinomatous hyperplasia is a chronic and late stage of epidermal hyperplasia that develops after milder forms (regular or irregular). It refers to marked hyperplasia of the epidermis, resulting in many branching and anastomosing epidermal projections (rete pegs) that deeply interdigitate with dermal collagen fibers. Mitotic figures can be numerous in proliferating basal cells, but in contrast to squamous cell carcinoma, the keratinocytes the normal stratum corneum), compact (compacted layers of basket weave stratum corneum), and laminated (layers of stratum corneum that are more even and linear, and less undulating). Both parakeratosis and hyperkeratosis are common nonspecific responses to chronic stimuli (e.g., superficial trauma, inflammation, or sun exposure) and also occur as primary lesions. For example, hyperkeratosis is a feature of the cornification disorder, primary seborrhea, of the cocker spaniel ( Fig. 17-9) , ichthyosis, and vitamin A deficiency. Diffuse parakeratosis is a feature of zinc-responsive dermatosis and superficial necrolytic dermatitis (hepatocutaneous syndrome) . Hyperkeratosis and parakeratosis can be accompanied by alterations in the thickness of the granular cell layer (stratum granulosum). Generally hyperkeratosis is associated with an increased thickness of the granular cell layer (hypergranulosis), and parakeratosis is associated with a decreased thickness of the granular cell layer (hypogranulosis). Epidermal Hyperplasia. Epidermal hyperplasia is an alteration in epidermal growth or differentiation characterized by an increase in the number of cells within the epidermis, most often within the CHAPTER 17 The Integument Stratum corneum maintain normal polarity, are not atypical, and do not penetrate the basement membrane. Pseudocarcinomatous hyperplasia develops subsequent to chronic injury, as seen with chronic dermal suppurative or granulomatous dermal inflammation or at the edges of persistent, nonhealing ulcers. Psoriasiform epidermal hyperplasia is an exaggerated type of regular epidermal hyperplasia in which the epidermis forms elongated rete pegs that are of similar length and width and that interdigitate with similarly elongated dermal papillae. This type of hyperplasia has very regular or uniform histologic appearance and is a feature of certain disease syndromes, such as psoriasiform lichenoid dermatitis of the springer spaniel and porcine juvenile pustular psoriasiform dermatitis (pityriasis rosea). Papillated epidermal hyperplasia is a unique form of epidermal hyperplasia in which fingerlike (papillary) projections of epidermis develop above the skin surface; it is a feature of some papillomas, hamartomas, and calluses and occasionally develops in response to cyclosporine drug therapy in dogs.",

Apoptosis refers to programmed cell death (see Chapter 1 for mechanisms of development), an important, normal physiologic process that contributes to embryologic development, wound healing, the removal of damaged cells, and adult tissue homeostasis and remodeling and is responsible for regression of the lower segment of the hair follicle during the catagen stage of the hair cycle. Apoptosis is tightly regulated because too little or too much may lead to pathologic processes. Neoplasia may develop when there is increased proliferation and inadequate apoptosisdriven removal of DNA-damaged cells. In contrast, the presence of numerous apoptotic keratinocytes is a feature of some immunemediated diseases such as erythema multiforme (Fig. 17-12 ) and more rare conditions, including toxic epidermal necrolysis and graftversus-host disease. Apoptotic cells typically condense and fragment into small bodies that are phagocytosed by adjacent parenchymal cells or tissue macrophages. However, keratinocytes, in contrast to other cells in the body, contain tonofilaments that provide structure and some rigidity to the cell. Thus the fragmentation into small bodies is less complete in apoptotic keratinocytes than other cells in the body. This is particularly so for keratinocytes that have accumulated more filaments through the process of maturation in the epidermis. The terms dyskeratosis or filamentous degeneration have been used to describe these keratinocytes. The fragmented (apoptotic) bodies in dyskeratotic keratinocytes are usually larger than in other cells, and they tend to resist phagocytosis. Dyskeratotic keratinocytes are separated from adjacent keratinocytes and have a pyknotic nucleus and brightly eosinophilic cytoplasm. Apoptosis differs significantly from necrosis, in which cell lysis liberates cellular contents into the extracellular space and elicits an inflammatory response. The development of an acute inflammatory response is prevented in apoptosis through phagocytosis of apoptotic keratinocytes, by adjacent keratinocytes, before their cellular disintegration.",

            "text": "Inflammatory Lesions of the Epidermis. Acute inflammation of the epidermis actually begins in the dermis with active hyperemia, edema, and migration of leukocytes, often neutrophils (see Inflammatory Disorders of the Dermis). The edema fluid arises from dilated venules and can move intercellularly through the epidermis, widening the intercellular spaces and causing spongiosis (see . In thermal burns of the skin, larger quantities of fluid accumulate within or below the epidermis, forming vesicles (see ; the fluid reaching the epidermal surface dries to form a largely acellular crust. The leukocytes (often neutrophils in acute inflammation) migrate from the superficial dermal vessels, through the superficial dermis, and into the intercellular spaces of the deep and then superficial layers of the epidermis. The aggregation of migrating leukocytes in the epidermis is termed exocytosis. Exocytosis of leukocytes is common in inflammation and is usually accompanied by spongiosis. If the inflammation progresses, the migrating leukocytes form pustules within the epidermis or the stratum corneum. Pustules usually dry rapidly and become crusts ( Fig. 17-19 ). The type of leukocyte recruited into the epidermis is influenced by complex interactions of cytokines involved in the pathogenesis of the disease and can be useful in classifying and ultimately diagnosing the disease. For instance, intraepidermal eosinophils can be seen in association with ectoparasite bites. Lymphocytic infiltrates into the epidermis are often seen with immune-mediated diseases such as lupus erythematosus. Malignant lymphoma that predominantly affects the epidermis is also characterized by intraepidermal lymphocytes. Erythrocytes can also be present in the epidermis, usually degeneration. Intracellular fluid accumulation limited to the basal layer of the epidermis is termed hydropic or vacuolar degeneration and can result in the formation of intrabasilar vesicles. Hydropic degeneration is a consequence of damage to basal keratinocytes when the basal keratinocytes cannot maintain normal homeostasis, and fluid accumulates within the cells (Fig. 17-14) . Rapid cytoplasmic swelling leads to cell membrane rupture and organelle breakdown typical of cell necrosis and is referred to as oncosis. Examples of diseases commonly resulting in hydropic degeneration include lupus erythematosus, dermatomyositis, and drug eruptions. Ballooning degeneration, a form of intracellular fluid accumulation of keratinocytes in more superficial layers of the epidermis, such as the stratum spinosum, is characterized by swollen cells losing their intercellular attachments. This type of degeneration can result in the formation of a fluid-filled vesicle. Viruses that infect cells of the epidermis, such as the pox and parapox viruses, can cause lysis of cytoplasmic keratin and a buildup of excessive fluid, resulting in ballooning degeneration (see section on Pathologic Reactions of the Entire Cutaneous Unit).",

Latitude is also critically important. The incidence of sunlight-induced cancer is estimated to double for every 265 miles closer to the equator that human beings reside. At high latitudes the path of sunlight through the ozone layer is longer than at lower latitudes, so the ozone absorbs more of the harmful UV light. The path of sunlight through the ozone layer is also one of the reasons that sunlight has more damaging UV rays in summer months and at midday. Increased wind velocity has also been shown to have an enhancing influence on damaging effects of UV light on the skin. Local environmental factors can influence the quantity of UV light reaching an animal's skin. Such factors include availability of shelter from sunlight in the form of trees, shade panels, or indoor housing, and color of the ground material (lightly colored sand) that can increase exposure to UV light through reflection. Host factors include quantity of hair, degree of pigmentation, thickness of stratum corneum, and other difficult-to-define genetic factors. Therefore solar damage is more prevalent in high-altitude, low-latitude parts of the world and in animals residing outside for long periods of time. Lesions generally develop in poorly haired and lightly pigmented sites. Solar elastosis develops in the superficial dermis of chronically sun-exposed skin, and consists of increased numbers of thick, interwoven, basophilic fibers with the staining characteristics of elastin (thus the name \"solar elastosis\"). In the nonpigmented abdominal skin of dogs, solar elastosis may develop intermixed with or below a linear band of dermal scarring parallel to the epidermal surface (laminar fibrosis). The pathogenesis of the development of solar elastosis is complex and not fully understood and may vary with species. Current evidence involving studies in human beings and mouse models supports the view that a majority of the elastotic material (elastin, fibrillin, and glycosaminoglycans) is newly formed as the result of altered function of sun-damaged fibroblasts, but that degradation of preexisting dermal matrix proteins, including elastin and also most likely collagen, seems to be involved as well.

Mineralization is a general term for the deposition of insoluble, inorganic minerals in the cutaneous tissue and usually consists of calcium in combination with phosphate or carbonate.

Mineralization can occur in four basic forms: (1) dystrophic, (2) metastatic, (3) idiopathic, and (4) iatrogenic. Mineralization can also occur in tissues that have been traumatized, which may encompass more than one of these pathogenic mechanisms. Dystrophic mineralization occurs as a result of injury or degeneration of cellular and extracellular components of the skin, with normal serum calcium concentrations, and without abnormalities in calcium metabolism. Examples include deposition of mineral in granulomas and calcinosis cutis seen in some cases of hyperadrenocorticism. In metastatic mineralization the calcium deposits develop without preceding tissue injury or degeneration and in association with hypercalcemia, usually the result of abnormal metabolism of calcium, phosphorus, or vitamin D. Examples include deposition of calcium salts in soft tissues in chronic renal disease and in poisoning with cholecalciferol (vitamin D 3 ). Mitochondria have a high affinity for calcium and phosphate and participate in both dystrophic and metastatic calcification by concentrating intracellular calcium and phosphate to concentrations that allow crystallization. Mechanisms leading to calcium deposition in dystrophic mineralization involve reduced pH of injured tissue, the influx of calcium into injured cells, and then into mitochondria. Metastatic calcification may be the result of increased extracellular calcium concentrations and the failure of the cell's normal ability to strictly regulate intracellular calcium with resultant accumulation within mitochondria.",

Dermatitis is inflammation of the dermis. Acute dermatitis begins with active hyperemia (increased blood flow), edema, and migration of leukocytes and results from release of cytokines and other mediators of acute inflammation (see Chapter 3). Active hyperemia is caused by vasodilation of arterioles, which causes increased blood flow at reduced velocity to capillary beds and postcapillary venules. Edema is caused by increased vascular permeability. Fluid leaves vessels mostly through widened interendothelial cell junctions. With a mild increase in vascular permeability, the edema fluid is clear (serous) because there are very few plasma proteins in the fluid. With increasing vascular permeability or endothelial cell injury, larger protein molecules, such as fibrinogen, escape from vessels, and the edema fluid becomes more eosinophilic and amorphous to fibrillar (fibrinous). The next step in acute dermatitis is migration of leukocytes from vessels into the perivascular dermis. The slowing of the blood flow and the endothelial cell expression of adhesion molecules that bind circulating leukocytes permit the migration of leukocytes in acute inflammation. The slowing of the blood flow allows leukocytes to move from the center of the vessel, where blood flow is fastest, to the margin, where they contact and attach to the activated endothelial cells.",

In many types of acute inflammation, neutrophils are one of the first cells to arrive. Neutrophils predominate in the first 6 to 24 hours of injury and are generally replaced by macrophages in 24 to 48 hours. This sequence of cellular exudation can vary. For example, in reactions mediated by immunoglobulin E (IgE) cross-linking, such as type I hypersensitivity responses, mast cells (located in the perivascular dermis) are stimulated to release contents of granules (occurs in seconds) and synthesize and release inflammatory mediators (prostaglandins, leukotrienes, and cytokines), resulting in the influx of eosinophils, basophils, CD4 + T helper type 2 (T H 2) lymphocytes, and macrophages. Mast cell degranulation and T H 2 lymphocyte activation cause eosinophils to accumulate in large numbers.

The causes of idiopathic mineralization are not known; it occurs in the absence of tissue injury or abnormalities in calcium or phosphorus metabolism. Calcinosis circumscripta is a form of tissue mineralization in which calcium is deposited as amorphous nodular aggregates in the soft tissues of the tongue and in the subcutis of the pawpads of dogs. The pathogenesis is not defined, but some cases are considered idiopathic, whereas others may be the result of tissue trauma. Calcium deposits can elicit a granulomatous inflammatory response, a foreign-body reaction to the deposits. Iatrogenic mineralization develops via direct exposure to calcium salts such as occurs with topical exposure to calcium chloride deicing solutions. This is the least specific pattern because all inflammatory patterns are at one stage, perivascular. B, Vascular (vasculitis): Leukocytes target the vessel wall, resulting in necrosis, inflammation, leakage of fibrin and red blood cells, and if severe, thrombosis and infarction. C, Interface, cell poor: Mild, often lymphocytic, inflammation located along the dermal-epidermal interface with vacuolar or apoptotic degeneration of basal cells. D, Interface, cell rich: Dense band of inflammation along the dermal-epidermal interface, obscuring the basilar layer of the epidermis, and with vacuolar or apoptotic degeneration of basal cells. E, Nodular to diffuse with or without microorganisms. Inflammation, typically granulomatous to pyogranulomatous, which partially effaces the architecture of the dermis may be associated with infectious agents or may be sterile. ( C without infectious agents ( Fig. 17-23 ). For example, perivascular dermatitis with eosinophils is suggestive of hypersensitivity associated with parasites or other antigens; interface dermatitis with lymphocytes is suggestive of an immune response directed toward epidermal cells, such as lupus erythematosus or erythema multiforme; and nodular dermatitis with macrophages (granulomatous dermatitis) indicates a persistent stimulus, such as infection with acid-fast bacteria or fungi. Thus patterns of inflammation combined with cellular composition of infiltrates are useful in microscopic diagnosis.",

Follicular Dysplasia. Follicular dysplasia refers to incomplete or abnormal development of the structure of follicles and hair shafts that ultimately leads to alopecia. Structure refers to the permanent physical structure of the hair follicle in contrast to temporary changes that may occur cyclically. Follicular dysplasia is usually an inherited abnormality of the hair follicles in which there is production of defective hair shafts, failure to maintain hair within follicles, or failure of hair growth. Follicular dysplasia may be congenital (present at birth) or tardive (later onset in life). Different types of follicular dysplasia syndromes are described in animals, but most are poorly characterized. Clinical features include reduced, absent, or poor-quality hair coat. Microscopic features vary but include abnormal keratinocytes in the hair matrix or abnormally formed components of the follicular wall. In contrast to the follicular dysplasia syndromes that are not associated with coat color, the color-linked follicular dysplasia syndromes such as color mutant alopecia (color dilution follicular dysplasia, color dilute alopecia) and black (dark) hair follicular dysplasia ( Fig. 17-24 ) have more obvious microscopic lesions in which melanin pigment abnormalities serve as a marker for the dysplasia. These pigment abnormalities include abnormally clumped melanin pigment granules in keratinocytes and melanocytes in the epidermis and hair bulb; melanin pigment clumps that are of irregular size, shape, and distribution in hair shafts that may cause the hair to weaken and break above the epidermal surface; nutritional abnormalities, inadequacy of blood supply, inflammation, and general state of health, including stressful events or systemic illness. Some types of pathologic atrophy can be reversed when the underlying cause is corrected. Damage to germinal epithelial cells can result in destruction or total loss of the adnexa with replacement by a scar. Examples include extensive inflammation and disruption of the follicle (folliculitis and furunculosis) and bordering glands and dermis that destroys a significant portion of the adnexal germinal epithelium, thermal burns sufficiently deep to involve the adnexa and dermal vessels, thrombosis causing infarction (i.e., diamond skin disease in pigs), and severe physical trauma such as lacerations that remove components of the skin, including adnexa.",

Abnormalities of hair cycle stages occur when there is disruption in the normal progression from the anagen, catagen, telogen, exogen, and kenogen stages of the hair cycle (see Fig. 17 -7). Clinical and histopathologic lesions can vary. Telogen effluvium is associated with a sudden noticeable shedding of the hair coat (telogen hairs) that may result in a bilateral, patchy to more diffuse alopecia. In domestic animals no scientific studies regarding cause or pathogenesis have been performed. Anecdotal reports usually associate the condition with a past episode of systemic illness or severe stress such as high fever, pregnancy and lactation, or anesthesia and surgery. The illness or stressful event is thought to cause synchronization of the hair cycle leading to many of the hair follicles eventually entering anagen simultaneously with subsequent sudden loss of telogen hairs. It is unclear if there are differences in telogen effluvium between animals with an anagendominant hair cycle (as occurs in animals with continuously growing hair coats such as poodles) versus a telogen-dominant hair cycle (as occurs in most domestic animals). In most cases the hair loss typically does not develop until several weeks or months after the systemic illness or stress, and it eventually resolves as the new hair shafts emerge from the follicles and the new hair coat becomes visible. Diagnosis is usually made clinically with the history of rapid, often widespread hair loss after a systemic illness or severe stress. Examination of epilated hair shafts reveals telogen hair bulb (usually straight, rough surfaced, club or spear shaped, and without pigment). Most clinical cases have biopsy samples collected during the late stages (during the stage of excessive shedding), when the majority of follicles are in the anagen stage of the hair cycle (recovery stage).

The number of mature sebaceous gland cells may be reduced, cytoplasmic vacuolization may be irregular, and the orderly differentiation of reserve cells to mature cells is lost or absent.

The role of circulating autoantibodies that target trichohyalin, hair keratins, and other components of the hair follicle remain unresolved; however, their appearance before the onset of clinically apparent alopecia in many cases of alopecia areata suggests these autoantibodies are not simply produced as a secondary response to hair follicle damage. The inflammation associated with the anagen hair bulb is thought to disrupt the function of the follicles, which subsequently enter the catagen and then telogen stages of the hair cycle. Alopecia areata can spontaneously resolve, but the newly growing hairs can be white instead of pigmented, probably as a result of damage to melanocytes in the hair bulb.

There are other causes of furunculosis, including trauma to the surface of the skin resulting in epidermal hyperplasia at the opening of the follicle, plugging of the follicle by stratum corneum, and accumulation of follicular contents, including glandular secretions (comedo formation). The gradual accumulation of this luminal material can cause distention of the follicle and thinning of the follicular wall, leading to rupture. Regardless of the cause of furunculosis, the presence of hair fragments, keratin proteins, sebum, and possible infectious agents in the dermis leads to a suppurative inflammatory response that progresses to more long-standing chronic pyogranulomatous inflammation and scarring. Perifolliculitis, luminal folliculitis, and furunculosis often follow in sequence ( Fig. 17-29) . The inflammation can resolve with appropriate therapy, can extend into the deep dermis and panniculus, and/or can form sinuses that drain to the surface of the skin and are difficult to resolve. Severe inflammation can lead to complete destruction of adnexal units and replacement by scar tissue that diminishes the likelihood of hair regrowth and complete recovery by the skin.

Fully developed lesions consist of lymphocytes, neutrophils, and macrophages that efface sebaceous glands. Chronic lesions have total loss of sebaceous glands (atrophy), scarring, epidermal and follicular hyperkeratosis, and follicular atrophy. The inflammation of sebaceous glands is thought to be the result of a cell-mediated immune response, but the pathogenesis of alopecia and scaling is incompletely understood. Sebaceous gland inflammation also can occur secondary to folliculitis, demodicosis, uveodermatologic syndrome, or leishmaniasis, in which the inflammation primarily targets other areas of the skin (follicles, epidermal cells, or dermis) and involves the neighboring sebaceous glands because of their proximity to the inflammation.",

It develops when leukocytes migrate from the wall into the lumen because they are attracted by various intraluminal stimuli, such as a follicular infection with bacteria (staphylococci), dermatophytes (Microsporum, Trichophyton), or infestation with parasites (Demodex, Pelodera) ( Fig. 17-27) . The inflammation can weaken the follicular wall, leading to rupture, known as furunculosis (Fig. 17-28) , and A, The wall of the follicle is disrupted, resulting in the release of follicular contents (a hair shaft, stratum corneum of the follicle, and exudate) into the dermis. The follicular lumen also contains numerous coccoid bacteria (arrow). Note that the hair shaft has variably sized and shaped melanin pigment granules, indicating that this dog also has coat color dilution, which may increase susceptibility to folliculitis. H&E stain. B, A circular area of erythema, scaling, and crusting (center of image) is caused by follicular inflammation and rupture (furunculosis). The exudate in the perifollicular dermis has extended into the surrounding dermis and onto the skin surface through a draining sinus, and dried to form a crust. (Courtesy Dr. A.M. Hargis, DermatoDiagnostics.) A A B Figure 17 -29 Progression of Folliculitis. Inflammation begins with migration of leukocytes (black dots) from perifollicular dermal vessels into the perifollicular dermis (perifolliculitis). Inflammation progresses to involve the follicular wall (mural folliculitis) and then the lumen (luminal folliculitis). If the inflammation continues, the follicular wall is weakened and ruptures, and follicular contents are released into the dermis (furunculosis surrounding inflammation that is severe and those vessels that are actually the target of injury. Also, the type of inflammatory cell that participates in the vasculitis reaction can vary more with the age of the vascular lesion than with the type of disease process inciting the stimulus. Histologic lesions in vasculitis include damage to the vessel wall such as the presence of few necrotic cells or foci of fibrinoid necrosis, mural infiltrates of leukocytes, and intramural or perivascular edema, hemorrhage, or fibrin exudation. Vascular injury leads to the clinical lesions of edema and hemorrhage and, if severe, can include ischemic necrosis and cutaneous infarction. Ulceration with or without sloughing of the skin can occur. Sustained partial ischemia can lead to atrophic changes in the components of the skin. Classic examples include immune-complex deposition in vessel walls (systemic lupus erythematosus and equine purpura hemorrhagica), vasculitis and ischemic dermatopathy associated with subcutaneous rabies vaccination, infection with an endotheliotropic organism (Rickettsia rickettsii), and septicemia with bacterial embolism and infarction in pigs (Erysipelothrix rhusiopathiae).",

            "text": "The involvement of multiple components of the skin in a disease process can be illustrated by a poxvirus infection ( Fig. 17-32) . When a poxvirus invades the epidermis, the virus replicates in the cells of the stratum spinosum and causes cytoplasmic swelling (ballooning degeneration) and rupture (reticular degeneration) of some of the epidermal cells. Cytoplasmic viral inclusions form in some cells. Cellular constituents released from damaged epidermal cells act as chemical mediators of the acute inflammatory response and are chemotactic for leukocytes. These chemical mediators and chemotactic factors (1) increase blood flow to the site of viral invasion by dilation of arterioles, (2) cause margination of leukocytes in capillaries and postcapillary venules in the dermis, (3) increase vascular permeability (dermal edema), and (4) cause migration of leukocytes out of vessels into the tissue, creating the formation of macular lesions. The epidermal degeneration, dermal edema, and perivascular inflammation can progress to exudative lesions. Ballooning and reticular degeneration of keratinocytes result in the formation of intraepidermal vesicles. Leukocytes in perivascular sites under the influence of inflammatory mediators from the epidermis migrate to the epidermis and enter the vesicle to form pustules. Some poxviruses also cause epidermal hyperplasia by stimulating host cell DNA synthesis, presumably by a viral gene product similar to epidermal growth factor, resulting in pseudocarcinomatous hyperplasia. The pustule enlarges and eventually ruptures, releasing the exudates onto the skin surface. The exudates dry and form a crust (scab). The primary lesions of vesicles and pustules are fragile and often transient, lasting only hours, and so are difficult to identify and collect in biopsy samples. The secondary lesions of crusting and scarring are typical lesions at clinical presentation because they are more long-standing, but these older (late stage) lesions are less subcutaneous adipose tissue is the target of the disease process ( Fig.  17-31 ). An example of primary panniculitis is feline pansteatitis, which occurs in cats fed diets high in polyunsaturated fatty acids and low in antioxidants, such as vitamin E. Lack of vitamin E leads to oxidation of lipids (free radical-induced membrane lipid peroxidation) of the subcutaneous adipose tissue, inciting a pyogranulomatous inflammatory response. In secondary panniculitis the subcutis is affected by inflammation primarily involving the contiguous dermis; the inflammation extends down into the subcutis. For example, deep bacterial folliculitis with furunculosis can lead to a secondary panniculitis, as can a penetrating wound contaminated with microbial agents or a foreign body. Animals with panniculitis clinically have palpable nodules that can ulcerate and drain an oily or hemorrhagic material (see Fig. 17 -31). Lesions are most often on the trunk and proximal limbs and can be solitary or multifocal. Solitary lesions may be cured by excision, whereas multiple lesions may resolve with specific therapy or result in scar formation. In animals, panniculitis is subdivided based on cell type and presence or absence of microorganisms into the following basic categories: Figure 17 -30 Sebaceous Adenitis, Skin, Haired, Dog.

Preformed substances released from mast cells include histamine, factors chemotactic for eosinophils and neutrophils, prostaglandins, serine esterases, and TNF-\u03b1. Substances synthesized on mast cell stimulation include leukotrienes, cytokines, and platelet-activating factor. Type I hypersensitivity can be systemic (anaphylaxis), localized to the skin, or both. In the skin the reaction results clinically in pruritic, circumscribed wheals with raised, erythematous borders. The reaction occurs in two phases, immediate (15 to 30 minutes) and late (6 to 12 hours), and is generally referred to as an immediate hypersensitivity reaction. The eosinophil products, major basic protein and eosinophil cationic protein, are toxic to epithelial cells and contribute to tissue damage in the late phase reaction. The production of IgE is genetically controlled, and therefore inherited predispositions to type I hypersensitivity occur. Cutaneous type I hypersensitivity reactions include atopic dermatitis (most common), urticaria, angioedema, hypersensitivity resulting from bites of flies such as Culicoides sp. and mites such as Sarcoptes sp., the presence of gastrointestinal parasites, and ingested dietary components (e.g., proteins, grains, preservatives).

Hypersensitivity is a mild to severe reaction that develops in response to normally harmless foreign compounds, including antiserum, pollen, and insect venoms. In contrast, autoimmune diseases develop when antibodies or T lymphocytes react against self-antigens when mechanisms of self-tolerance fail. Typically the immune system randomly generates millions of lymphocytes that can each respond to a different foreign protein and subsequently also removes any lymphocytes that may also respond to a selfantigen. Failure to remove or cull lymphocytes that respond to self-antigens may result in autoimmune disease. Autoimmune disease in this section is a general term referring to a spectrum of diseases in which autoimmune mechanisms appear to participate in lesion production. Four basic immune reactions, types I, II, III, and IV, mediate the tissue damage in both hypersensitivity and autoimmune diseases (Table 17 -5). Most cutaneous hypersensitivity reactions are mediated by either type I or type IV reactions, or by a combination of one or more of the four reactions. In contrast, most autoimmune reactions tend to be mediated by type II or III reactions, although more than one mechanism can be involved. Hypersensitivity reactions are common in horses and dogs, less common in cats, and uncommon in food animals. Autoimmune diseases with cutaneous manifestations are uncommon in domestic animals, accounting for 1% to 2% of dermatoses in most species.

Disease outcomes of aging in domestic animals are discussed later and illustrated in Box 17-3. The more clinically obvious aging changes in the skin of domestic animals include neoplastic transformation and thinning and graying of the hair. With few exceptions, most cutaneous tumors, benign or malignant, develop in mature adult to older animals. In human beings, many age-related changes in the skin, including the development of selected neoplasms, arise via the extrinsic mechanism of chronic environmental exposure to UV light from the sun. Although the same is true for the sparsely haired and sparsely pigmented skin of domestic animals, such as the skin around the eyes, nose, lips, genitalia, or on the ventral abdomen, chronic sun exposure poses less of a problem for most domestic animals due to the usual protection of the hair coat.

Cell damage occurs by complement-mediated lysis, antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity, or antibody-directed cellular dysfunction (see Table  17 -5). The first two mechanisms are most common in type II reactions affecting the skin. Examples include deposition of autoantibody to desmoglein 1, desmocollin 1, or desmoglein 3, transmembrane proteins found in desmosomes that provide physical connections between keratinocytes and are present in pemphigus (uncommon), and autoantibody to bullous pemphigoid antigen 2 (also called collagen XVII), a 180-kD hemidesmosomal transmembrane molecule in bullous pemphigoid (rare). The lesions vary with the location of the target antigen. In pemphigus foliaceus, desmosomal damage leads to formation of superficial epidermal vesicles that rapidly become pustules and crusts, whereas in bullous pemphigoid the deeper hemidesmosomal damage leads to formation of subepidermal vesicles that rapidly become ulcers.",

The reaction mediated by sensitized CD4 + T H 1 lymphocytes develops after contact with a specific persistent or nondegradable antigen (such as tuberculin), causing the release of cytokines and recruitment of other lymphocytes and macrophages. The reaction largely depends on IFN-\u03b3 or other cytokines, including IL-2. IFN-\u03b3 activates macrophages that work to eliminate the targeted antigen. In reactions mediated by CD4 + T H 2 lymphocytes (T-helper lymphocytes), contact with soluble antigen bound to major histocompatibility complex class II (MHC II) results in inflammatory responses in which eosinophils predominate. This type of reaction is believed to participate in the pathogenesis of atopic dermatitis. In the cytotoxic reaction the CD8 + T lymphocytes kill the targeted host cell directly. This is the mechanism of damage in allergic contact dermatitis associated with antigens such as poison ivy and can also participate in graft-versus-host disease. Type IV reactions take many hours to develop and are initiated by antigens bound to host cell major histocompatibility molecules. Type IV reactions mediated by CD4 + T H 1 lymphocytes are used in the diagnosis of diseases such as tuberculosis, histoplasmosis, and coccidioidomycosis.

Two common types of cutaneous wounds are used as examples, and these include wounds with opposed edges, such as surgical incisions, and larger wounds in which the edges cannot be opposed, such as broad ulcers, necrosis associated with deep burns, or large areas of trauma in which portions of the skin have been lost. Recall that regeneration and repair are dynamic processes involving multiple and overlapping stages. These stages include (1) blood clotting and inflammation (12 to 24 hours after injury), (2) reepithelialization, fibroplasia, and angiogenesis (3 to 7 days after injury), and (3) wound contraction and collagen production (1 to 2 weeks after injury).",

In addition to mobility, within 24 to 48 hours from injury, there is mitosis of basal cells at the edges of the wound. The mitosis is induced by growth factors from epidermal cells, macrophages, and dermal parenchymal cells. Basal cells from both sides of the wound migrate along the cut edges of the dermis separating nonviable tissue from viable tissue by using the expression of various surface integrin receptors on viable cells and through the production of collagenase, which d\u00e9brides dead tissue. The basal cells join at the midline of the wound, and as reepithelialization develops, the nonviable tissue above this newly united epidermis is sloughed. Basal cells also produce extracellular matrix, such as fibronectin, to facilitate reestablishment of the basement membrane.

Many growth factors play a role in angiogenesis, but vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is considered to be the most important.

Production of collagen and proliferation of fibroblasts (directed by cytokines, such as TGF-\u03b2) progress fairly rapidly in this phase of wound repair.

The proliferation and maturation of endothelial cells, fibroblasts, and inflammatory cells that contribute to wound repair depend on complex feedback control mechanisms between cells, cytokines, enzymes, and the extracellular matrix microenvironment. This complex interaction has been called dynamic reciprocity. As the wound space is bridged by granulation tissue and fibroblasts produce collagen, the endothelial cells undergo apoptosis, thus reducing capillary numbers. Similarly, fibroblasts and macrophages also undergo apoptosis. The reduction of endothelial cells, fibroblasts, and inflammatory cells leads to formation of an acellular scar. By the third week of wound repair, the wound has approximately 20% the tensile strength of normal skin.

            "text": "The mechanisms of hair graying are incompletely understood. Perhaps the most relevant and most studied time sequence of hair graying occurs in human beings, in whom the regeneration of an intact hair follicle pigmentary unit, which is formed from the pigment-producing melanocytes anchored to the basement membrane above the dermal papilla and the hair shaft-producing keratinocytes in the hair bulb, occurs optimally only during the first 10 hair cycles, or until approximately 40 years of age. Thereafter there is gradual reduction in the melanin pigment production of each hair follicle, resulting in the growth of gray and white hair shafts, suggesting an age and genetically regulated exhaustion of the pigment production potential of each individual hair follicle. This biologic process appears to be associated with the loss of melanocytes in the hair bulb and loss of the melanocyte stem cells in the isthmus region of the ORS. The endogenous oxidative stress that develops from the hydroxylation of tyrosine and the oxidation of dihydroxyphenylalanine (DOPA) to form melanin may to contribute to the reduction of pigment by causing selective premature aging and apoptosis of melanocytes. In addition, studies using aged human hair follicles and transgenic mice have shown loss of maintenance of melanocytic stem cells, which may involve premature differentiation of stem cells or activation of a senescence program. If stem cells differentiate prematurely, they lose the ability to retain their stem cell capabilities. Other factors that may damage melanocyte stem cells include reduced or inefficient antioxidant systems and oxidative stress from exogenous sources such as inflammation, UV light, psychoemotional stress, and others. Ionizing radiation, experimentally in mice, also has been shown to cause irreparable DNA damage that eliminates renewal of melanocyte stem cells. Oxidative injury, in particular a high degree of endogenous oxidative stress from melanin pigment production, may play a more important role in human beings, who have an anagen-based hair cycle with a long growing phase resulting in production of long and often heavily pigmented hair shafts. In contrast, many domestic animals have a telogen-based hair cycle and thus shorter lengths of hair, which theoretically should result in less oxidative damage to the follicular melanin unit following melanin production and may explain why there is less extensive and less generalized graying of the hair coat of aged animals. Alternatively, animals may have more efficient or enhanced antioxidant systems or may be less susceptible to the various causes of melanocyte or melanocytic stem cell damage. For example, in horses and dogs, the two domestic species in which age-related hair coat graying are reported, the graying occurs predominantly on the face around the muzzle and eyes, although scattered gray hairs are also noted in other anatomic areas of the body. A genetic component may play a role in hair graying in dogs because certain breeds (e.g., German shepherd dogs, Irish setters, Labrador retrievers, golden retrievers) are more likely to develop gray muzzle and chin hairs at a relatively younger age.",

Age-related hair loss in human beings is thought to result from a defective hair cycle that causes a shortened anagen (or growth) stage, increased ratio of telogen to anagen follicles, and persistence of telogen follicles. Studies in mice also have shown the duration of the telogen stage increases with each hair cycle, and the entire hair cycle slows considerably with aging. Similarly, it is generally believed that the hair cycle of many animals becomes increasingly telogenic with age. Interestingly, similar changes to those described in human beings and mice have been observed in some aging dogs with human beings and mouse models. Although similar hair coat changes occur in aged domestic animals, little has been investigated or published regarding these changes, which may in part be due to the perceived irrelevance of these changes in animals compared with human beings, or that most domestic animals are unlikely to be a good model for the human condition due to the differences in the type of hair follicles (e.g., compound versus simple), the length of the hair cycle (telogen based versus anagen based), and stronger seasonal and nutritional influences on the hair cycle and the hair coat in animals.",

Host defenses against injury principally consist of three broad mechanisms: (1) physical defense, (2) immunologic defense, and (3) repair mechanisms. The most critical defense is the barrier derived from the more superficial layers of the skin, which include the stratum corneum, epidermis, basement membrane, and superficial dermis. Without these outer layers of the skin, animals cannot survive (consider, for example, the deleterious effects of extensive burns and ulcerative immune-mediated diseases such as pemphigus vulgaris). One of the most important cells in the skin is the keratinocyte that terminally differentiates to form the stratum corneum, the outermost barrier of the skin. Keratinocytes produce keratin filaments, desmosomes, and hemidesmosomes, providing structural integrity to the cytoplasm and an interconnecting network that anchors the keratinocytes to each other and the basement membrane. Keratinocytes produce cytokines (including IL-1, IL-6, IL-8, IL-3, TNF-\u03b1, colony-stimulating factors) and growth factors (including transforming growth factor-\u03b1 [TGF-\u03b1], TGF-\u03b2, platelet-derived growth factor [PDGF], FGF), thus participating in innate and adaptive immunity and in the communication between the two. Keratinocytes also dissolve desmosomes and hemidesmosomes and form actin filaments so they can migrate to cover skin wounds and then proliferate to regenerate the wounded skin. Keratinocytes thus not anagen-based hair cycles, such as poodles. These changes histologically include a gradual increase in the number of telogen stage hair follicles with age, and the hair coats of some of these aged poodles become less dense over time. However, because most dogs and other mammals have a telogen-based hair cycle and there are seasonal influences associated with the hair cycle, it is difficult to clinically or histologically assess an insidious prolongation of the telogen stage of the cycle in most domestic species. Nevertheless, prolongation of the telogen phase with aging could theoretically result in the presence of older, more worn hair shafts similar to what is observed in some hair cycle arrest disorders (such as endocrine-based alopecia). In fact, aged horses and dogs tend to have a dull, dryer hair coat, which could be associated with prolongation of telogen. Although a telogen-based hair coat may be of lesser quality, telogen stage follicles with retained hair shaft may be the most beneficial for the aging animal because it is thought to be the most energy efficient hair follicle stage (does not require protein production to form a hair shaft), and the inactive telogen bulb that lacks the mitotic activity may also reduce the risk for malignant transformation.",

The skin becomes an efficient portal of entry for microorganisms only when the barrier is first damaged by trauma; excessive moisture, heat, or cold; or disruption of the normal flora of the integument; however, a few pathogens, such as hookworm and Cuterebra larvae, are able to penetrate intact normally functioning skin. Some organisms may also use more than one portal; for example, Cuterebra larvae also gain entrance via ingestion during grooming by the host, or they can migrate over skin to natural body openings such as the nares, where they can more easily penetrate a less defensive barrier, the mucosa. Dermatophytes are able to colonize the nonviable cornified structures such as hair, claws, and the stratum corneum and cause disease without ever entering living tissue. Clinical disease, or dermatophytosis, results from the host's reaction to the organism and its by-products. A number of microorganisms (e.g., Staphylococcus pseudintermedius, Streptococcus sp., Corynebacterium pseudotuberculosis, Pasteurella sp., Proteus sp., Pseudomonas sp., and Escherichia coli) gain entrance to the body by entering through natural pores, such as hair follicles or glands with ducts that traverse the epidermis, or by the parenteral route, which includes all types of breaks in the skin, including injections, insect bites, and other types of wounds. Organisms that are able to inhabit hair follicles, such as mites or bacteria, gain entry to the body when the wall of the follicle is ruptured, leading to emptying of follicular contents into the dermis. Similarly, rupture of glands or ducts can lead to entry for some of those microorganisms. Once in the dermis, infectious agents can stimulate a robust host immune response or possibly spread to other areas of the body by gaining entry to the bloodstream or traveling to regional and distant lymph nodes via lymph flow.",

Host defense against mechanical injury is also provided by the tightly bundled keratin filaments of the corneocyte, the resilience of the cornified envelope, the adhesion of the cornified envelope and intercellular lipids, and the corneodesmosomes. In addition, the keratinocytes contain keratin filaments and form desmosomal junctions with adjacent cells (see Fig. 17 -4). The keratin filaments perform a structural role (i.e., cytoskeletal) in the cells, and the desmosomes promote adhesion of epidermal cells and resistance to mechanical stresses. The basement membrane anchors the epidermis to the dermis via hemidesmosomes, providing structural integrity against trauma. Dermal collagen and elastic tissue provide resilience and tensile strength to the skin and support for the vessels, nerves, and adnexa. The panniculus protects against surface trauma by providing some shock absorption (e.g., pawpads), by facilitating movement, and by anchoring the dermis to fascia.

It is a multifactorial, chronic and relapsing, often severely pruritic skin disease that affects human beings, horses, dogs, and cats. It can cause severe discomfort, including sleeplessness from pruritus, and is associated with secondary skin infections. Although the etiopathogenesis of atopic dermatitis has been studied most extensively in human beings, many similarities with the human disease have been identified in atopic dogs. Advances in the knowledge of canine atopic dermatitis have occurred through the recent development and validation of animal models of the disease; these models have allowed more in-depth investigative studies in dogs and more precise comparisons of the disease between human beings and dogs. Atopic dermatitis is a common problem in dogs; the prevalence varies with survey, but it is estimated to affect up to 27% of the population in the United States ( Fig. 17-34) . It is also a common human disease estimated to affect 10% to 20% of children. Similarities of the disease in human beings and dogs include young age of onset; genetic inheritance; similar clinical lesion distribution; similar histopathologic lesions, including infiltration of IgE + CD1c + dendritic cells; dry skin with increased transepidermal water loss; decreased stratum corneum ceramides (lipids); decreased epidermal filaggrin (in some subsets of dogs); increased colonization of surface staphylococci; positive atopy patch test; increased IgE-specific responses most commonly directed against environmental allergens; in acute disease T H 2-dominated immune responses; and in chronic disease a switch from T H 2 to T H 1 immune responses.

Defects in three groups of genes important in epidermal barrier function in atopic human beings have suggested that in most cases alterations in the epidermal barrier contribute to the development of atopic dermatitis and may represent the primary event. The type and degree of genetic defect plus interaction with environmental factors appear to influence the severity or probability of developing the disease. A defective epidermal barrier facilitates penetration of allergens though the skin, as well as the interaction of the allergens with the local antigen-presenting and immune effector cells (E- Fig. 17 -2). Changes in genes encoding for structural proteins (especially filaggrin), epidermal proteases, and protease inhibitors have been identified in human beings with atopic dermatitis. These defects serve to reduce stratum corneum hydration and increase transepidermal water loss, increase cleavage of corneodesmosome junctions, reduce lamellar body secretion and thus stratum corneum lipids, increase pH, and reduce antimicrobial properties of the stratum corneum. These alterations to the barrier favor population by pathogenic versus nonpathogenic bacteria and sustain allergen entrance through the barrier. The allergens are phagocytosed by dendritic cells, which present the allergen to T H lymphocytes and recruit other CD4 + T lymphocytes to the site. The activated dendritic cells and the cytokines produced by the CD4 + T lymphocyte (particularly IL-4) lead to switching from a T H 1 to T H 2 response (in early lesions) and release of proinflammatory cytokines and production of IgE, which in the presence of allergen activates mast cells. In atopic dermatitis there is a complex interaction between the immune system and the nervous system that can promote the sensation of itch. For example, at least one of the T H 2 proinflammatory cytokines, IL-31, binds to receptors on neurons to stimulate itch; thus it significantly contributes to pruritus, a hallmark of atopic",

Innate immunity protects the host during the first 7 days of exposure to a pathogen before development of an adaptive immune response and also initiates and assists the adaptive immune response (E-Table 17-1). The diversity of microorganisms requires equal diversity in host defense responses. The first phase of innate host defense consists of the barrier of the stratum corneum, which prevents pathogen adhesion and provides an antimicrobial surface consisting of antimicrobial peptides and fatty acids. The antimicrobial peptides (e.g., \u03b2-defensins and cathelicidins) are effective against many organisms, including viruses, bacteria, protozoa, and insects, and probably kill some of these pathogens by damaging their lipid membranes. The surface barrier also includes normal flora of nonpathogenic bacteria that competes with pathogenic microorganisms for nutrients and for attachment sites on cells. The normal flora also produces antimicrobial substances that prevent pathogen colonization. Because the dry cornified surface is such an effective barrier to pathogens, a wound or abrasion is usually necessary for a pathogen to gain entrance. E- Fig. 17 -1 provides an illustration of how the innate and adaptive (acquired) immune systems participate in host defense against bacterial pathogens that have gained entrance into the skin through a wound in the epidermis. When injured, keratinocytes release a variety of antimicrobial peptides, chemokines, and cytokines, which activate endothelial cells and attract macrophages, neutrophils, and lymphocytes to the site of injury. Early key cells that play a role in innate immunity are the tissue macrophages that contact, bind, phagocytose, and thereby eliminate many types of pathogens. Pathogen recognition is mediated by pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), including Toll-like receptors and others, that recognize repeating patterns of molecular structures common to broad classes of pathogens and efficiently differentiate pathogen antigens from self-antigens. The repeating patterns of molecular structures on pathogens are called pathogenassociated molecular patterns (PAMPs).",

Pathogen recognition is mediated through PAMPs as described previously. The major function of Langerhans cells and dermal dendritic cells is antigen processing and presentation; thus these cells are referred to as \"professional antigen processing and presenting cells.\" Langerhans and dermal dendritic cells reexpress the ingested and processed antigen on their cell surfaces and migrate via afferent lymphatic vessels to the paracortical areas of skin-associated lymph nodes, where they arrive as mature and powerful antigen-presenting cells. These skinderived dendritic cells then initiate a pathogen-specific protective immune response by presenting antigen to the na\u00efve T lymphocytes. Langerhans cells also produce cytokines (e.g., IL-1 and TNF-\u03b1), thus participating in upregulation of inflammatory and immune responses in the skin.",

In response to bacteria that have breached the epidermal barrier, keratinocytes synthesize antimicrobial peptides, chemokines, and cytokines. These factors lead to activation of the dermal capillary endothelium, inducing the migration of innate leukocytes and memory T lymphocytes into the skin and additionally guiding these cells via chemotactic gradients. These factors and bacterial antigens activate innate phagocytes to kill ingested organisms and activate dendritic cells to migrate to the local skin lymph nodes. In the lymph nodes, dendritic cells present bacterial antigens to na\u00efve and central memory T lymphocytes, leading to stimulation of pathogen-specific lymphocytes. Effector CD8 + T lymphocytes exit the lymph node, home to inflamed skin, and kill pathogens. Helper CD4 + T lymphocytes provide help to B lymphocytes, inducing the production of antibodies that directly neutralize pathogens and lead to additional targeting of innate responses.

The B lymphocytes have immunoglobulin molecules as the receptors for antigen, and on activation, B lymphocytes secrete immunoglobulin, which provides defense against pathogens (often bacteria) in the extracellular spaces. Antibody facilitates pathogen neutralization, complement activation, and enhanced endocytosis by phagocytes. In contrast, T lymphocytes have receptors that recognize foreign antigens expressed as peptide fragments bound to MHC proteins (see Chapter 5 for a review). One class of T lymphocytes expresses the CD8 molecule on their surface (i.e., CD8 + T lymphocytes). These CD8 + T lymphocytes recognize peptide Another class of T lymphocytes expresses the CD4 molecule on their surface. This class of T lymphocyte is divided into subclasses. One subclass, the CD4 + T lymphocyte subset (T H 1 [helper]), recognizes peptide fragments (e.g., microbial antigen) bound to MHC II and releases cytokines, including IFN-\u03b3, resulting in an inflammatory response via macrophage activation. A second subclass, CD4 + T lymphocyte subset (T H 2 [helper]), recognizes peptides (including allergens) bound to MHC II and releases cytokines, including IL-4, IL-5, and IL-13, resulting in inflammatory responses in which eosinophils predominate and stimulates B lymphocytes to secrete immunoglobulin. Another subclass, the T regulatory lymphocyte, acts to suppress responses of other T lymphocytes. Most antigens require an accompanying signal from helper T lymphocytes before they can stimulate B lymphocytes to proliferate and differentiate into antibody-secreting plasma cells. Thus T lymphocytes are crucial to adaptive immunity by destroying pathogen-infected cells, by activating macrophages, and by activating B lymphocytes.",

Impaired host defense mechanisms can lead to increased susceptibility to infection, to development of neoplasia, or to chronic inflammatory or autoreactive disorders such as atopic dermatitis, contact hypersensitivity, or lupus erythematosus. fragments bound to MHC I, then kill the cell, and thus are also called cytotoxic T lymphocytes. The epidermal barrier is formed by the lower layers of the stratum corneum and is composed of differentiated keratinocytes, termed corneocytes (beige rectangles), held together with corneodesmosomes (purple spheres). The hyperactivity of degradative proteases (light red hexagons) found within the epidermis and contributed to by exogenous proteases (red hexagons), from house dust mites and Staphylococcus spp. bacteria for example, facilitates the cleavage of the corneodesmosome junctions. This is just one event in the breakdown of the epidermal barrier that permits the penetration of allergens. Dendritic cells (green) found in the dermis take up and present these allergens (red stars) to helper T lymphocytes type 1 (T H 1) (purple) and recruit more CD4 + T lymphocytes (blue). Activated dendritic cells and interleukin dermatitis. Other itch-promoting inflammatory mediators such as neurotrophins or neuroactive peptides also contribute. Langerhans cells also contribute in early lesions because they prime na\u00efve T lymphocytes into the T H 2 type (with high IL-4 production). IL-4 may also be produced by mast cells, basophils, or eosinophils. Exogenous factors also contribute. For example, proteases from house dust mites can facilitate cleavage of corneodesmosomes and additionally contribute to epidermal barrier damage. The resulting inflammation causes pruritus, which stimulates scratching, further damaging the epidermal barrier (and keratinocytes, resulting in release of additional proinflammatory cytokines, including IL-1), and creating a vicious cycle that perpetuates the disease and that is difficult to control. Secondary infections with Staphylococci and Malassezia also contribute because proteins from these infections more readily pass through the impaired epidermal barrier and can result in development of IgE-mediated bacterial and yeast hypersensitivity. Approximately 25% of human beings with severe atopic dermatitis have IgE antibody directed toward self-proteins. These antibodies may develop after intracellular proteins from keratinocytes are released when the keratinocytes are damaged by scratching. These keratinocyte proteins may mimic microbial structure and induce IgE autoantibodies that further perpetuate the disease. In summary, atopic dermatitis is a complex, multifactorial, heterogeneous disease in which altered epidermal barrier function appears to contribute to the pathogenesis by facilitating penetration of allergens though the skin, as well as the interaction of the allergens with the local antigen-presenting and immune effector cells. It serves as an example of the importance of the epidermal barrier in protecting the host against injury from allergens, microbial infections, and autoreactive disorders.",

Knowing when biopsy is not the best course of action is equally important. Biopsy should not be viewed as a substitute, or equivalent option, for referral to a veterinary dermatology specialist. If in regional proximity, referral to a veterinary dermatology specialist may be recommended before and instead of collecting biopsy samples. Biopsy sampling is recommended when the following are present: 1. The therapy for the skin disorder is associated with significant side effects (to confirm the clinical diagnosis before starting therapy). 2. A nodular lesion, ulcer, or nonhealing wound might represent a tumor (so that surgical excision of the tumor can be performed as early as possible). 3. Lesions develop suddenly, are severe, or are unusual (to help identify a serious disease so that therapy can be instituted early). 4. Lesions develop during the course of therapy (to identify a potential adverse reaction to drug therapy). 5.

To prevent warping in the fixative, thin excisional biopsy specimens should be gently attached to a flat object, such as a piece of cardboard or tongue depressor, and permitted to dry for 20 to 30 seconds. Twenty to 30 seconds is all that is necessary for the sample to adhere to the flat object. The specimen and flat object are then immediately immersed in formalin. Care should be taken not to let the sample become dehydrated (i.e., remain unfixed for longer than 20 to 30 seconds), which could damage the morphologic features of small samples and the lesions. In cold climates during winter months, punch biopsy samples should in some cases. The formalin-fixed tissue submitted for histopathologic evaluation also can be used for most routine immunohistochemical procedures, because most use immunoperoxidase staining rather than immunofluorescence (IF). Unfortunately, immunostaining techniques for immunemediated skin diseases can give false-positive or false-negative results; thus they must be done in conjunction with standard histopathologic evaluation. For autoimmune diseases, should IF evaluation be desired, specimens can be fixed in Michel's medium, which preserves immunoglobulin and complement. If immunohistochemical (immunoperoxidase) staining is desired, formalin-fixed samples are used; however, for best results, samples should not remain in formalin longer than 48 hours. Prolonged fixation in formalin results in cross-linking of proteins and false-negative results. For autoimmune disease, newer techniques that detect more specific antigens, such as desmoglein (transmembrane glycoproteins found in desmosomes that provide physical connections between keratinocytes), use of \"salt-split\" skin sections (a technique used in immunostaining of the skin in which sodium chloride splits the epidermis from the dermis through the lamina lucida, allowing better differentiation of subepidermal bullous dermatoses), use of better substrates for indirect immunostaining, and use of immunoblotting and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) techniques may improve diagnostic accuracy of immune-mediated skin diseases in the future.",

The congenital alopecia and hypotrichosis syndromes have been considered to be forms of congenital follicular dysplasia because there is an abnormal development of the hair follicles. Animals with congenital hereditary hypotrichosis can have defects in other body systems, including brachygnathism (abnormal smallness of the mandible) and dental, thymic, and genital abnormalities. When the condition involves the hair follicles plus adnexal glands and teeth, which all arise from the ectoderm, the condition is also termed ectodermal dysplasia. In addition to health problems created by oral, dental, or thymic defects (inability to efficiently chew or graze and immune deficiency that can lead to death), animals with hypotrichosis are more susceptible to sunburn, temperature extremes, and bacterial and fungal infections. The degree, location, and age of onset of hairlessness or hypotrichosis vary. Hair that is present is usually abnormally coarse or fine and easily broken or epilated. Morphologic changes in the skin and hair follicles vary from species to species, most likely representing differences in mutations. A useful example is congenital hypotrichosis with anodontia in German Holstein calves . In this condition, hypotrichosis, lack of most teeth, and complete absence of eccrine nasolabial glands is inherited as a monogenic X-linked recessive trait. Because the condition affects the hair follicles, some adnexal glands, and teeth, it is also classified as an ectodermal dysplasia. The condition varies in severity, with some calves more affected than others. Affected calves have reduced numbers of hairs per surface area in various anatomic locations (especially head, pinnae, neck, back, and tail), and also have reduced length and numbers of eyelashes and vibrissae. The alopecia and hypotrichosis are most severe in newborn calves because the number of fine hairs increases with age. There are no defects in the horns, endocrine glands, genital organs, or other internal organs. Histologically, hair follicles and adnexal glands are absent in the skin on the back of the ears. Hair follicle density is often reduced in other areas. When present, hair bulbs are small and poorly developed. In some areas the apocrine glands are reduced in quantity, and eccrine nasolabial glands are absent.

It has been shown that affected horses have altered cyclophilin B-protein interactions, and that collagen folding is affected, presumably leading to the clinical lesions, which tend to develop in the skin of the dorsal trunk when young horses begin saddle training, initially suggesting that the collagen defect was only regionally present. However, other areas of the body can develop lesions, and additional studies have indicated that the collagen abnormality is uniformly present in skin of affected horses, but that other factors such as trauma, heat, or UV light-associated injury may influence lesion development.

Blisters develop as a result of poor cohesion of the epidermis and dermis as a result of structural defects at the basement membrane zone. The structural defects are the result of mutations in genes responsible for the synthesis of a variety of structural components of this anatomic region of the skin and include abnormalities in keratin intermediate filaments, proteins associated with hemidesmosomes, and anchoring fibrils such as type VII collagen. The diseases vary in mode of inheritance, clinical manifestations, and anatomic location of the blisters. Animals affected with the diseases usually die because of their inability to obtain nourishment, loss of fluid and protein, and secondary infection leading to bacteremia. Epidermolysis bullosa has been reported in horses, cattle, sheep, dogs, and cats. Lesions can be present at birth or develop shortly thereafter and are located where epithelial surfaces are subjected to minor mechanical trauma, such as oral mucosa, lips, and extremities, and can include sloughing of claws, hooves, or pawpads. Shearing forces that normally cause no problem are sufficient to cause injury in these animals. Microscopic lesions are those of an epidermal vesicular disease in which vesicles form in different locations (subepidermal, dermal-epidermal junction, or intraepidermal), depending on the specific disease. The vesicles progress to ulcers or if secondarily infected, become pustules. As healing occurs, the reepithelialization causes sloughing of the dried exudates over the ulcer, and the pustules dry to form crusts.",

The disease varies in severity and has been reported in most domestic species. It is the result of inherited genetic mutations in some species, but inheritance is not proved in other species. Additional information regarding the pathogenesis is not known. Without the protective covering of the stratified squamous epithelium, the underlying tissue is easily traumatized, can become infected, and bacteremia can develop. Grossly, lesions consist of sharply demarcated areas devoid of the epidermis and adnexa or mucosa, exposing the underlying red, moist dermis or submucosa. Lesions are located most often on the face, extremities, or mucous mediators, such as cytokines, from radiation-damaged keratinocytes, or from direct damage to endothelial cells of superficial dermal capillaries by UV light. Chronic sun exposure, particularly to UVB, causes damage primarily in the epidermis leading to the development of neoplasia. The damage occurs in three broad categories, as follows: 1. One of the most detrimental changes occurs when UVB radiation contacts the nucleus and causes the formation of \"photoproducts,\" which are abnormal covalent or single bonds between two adjacent pyrimidine bases in a strand of DNA. The two major UVB-induced photoproducts are pyrimidine dimers (covalent bonds between two thymine or two cytosine bases) and 6-4 photoproducts (single bond bridging carbon 4 in one cytosine and carbon 6, either in a cytosine or a thymine). These photoproducts form in keratinocyte DNA (and also in DNA of Langerhans cells and dermal dendritic cells). The damage can be easily and accurately repaired before the cell undergoes mitosis by the nucleotide excision repair enzyme system that removes the damaged area and synthesizes a new strand of DNA. However, if the cell undergoes mitosis before the damage is repaired, a gap in the DNA strand is left at the location of the photoproduct. The gap is repaired by a postreplication repair method that is thought to be error prone and may lead to mutations and the development of neoplasms. Factors that irritate the skin and increase the rate of cell division increase the number of cells repaired by the postreplication repair method and therefore can enhance development of neoplasms. 2. Chronic exposure to UVB radiation also causes damage to DNA in the form of mutations to tumor-suppressor genes, in particular to the p53 gene. Normally, UVR-induced DNA damage causes keratinocyte induction of the p53 gene, which leads to cell cycle arrest, thus allowing the UVR-caused DNA damage to be corrected by the nucleotide excision repair system before the cell undergoes mitosis, and a functional p53 gene also facilitates apoptosis (programmed cell death) of cells with excessive unrepaired damaged DNA so that those defective cells are removed. The p53 gene mutations develop when UVR-induced photoproducts are not repaired before keratinocyte mitosis. The photoproducts form small structural abnormalities in the DNA strand that can result in faulty base paring (i.e., mutations) during replication. The mutations are characterized by the replacement of a cytosine with a thymine (C to T) or double-base membranes and can be small (1 cm) or involve extensive regions such as the entire distal limb ( Fig. 17-40 ). Small lesions can heal with scarring and not interfere with life. With extensive involvement the entire skin can be affected, including hooves, ears, lips, and eyelids, and may result in abortion of the affected fetus. Animals born alive with extensive lesions usually die from infection or dehydration and electrolyte abnormalities from extensive fluid loss through nonepithelialized surfaces.",

UVA penetrates deeper into the dermis but is less efficient in causing DNA damage because it is not significantly absorbed by native DNA. However, UVA can act indirectly by causing secondary photoreactions of existing UVB-induced DNA damage or alternatively damage DNA via indirect photosensitizing reactions. For example, if photodynamic chemicals are present in the skin, they can chemically react with the longer wavelengths (UVA and sometimes visible light), thus releasing energy and leading to the formation of reactive oxygen intermediates that initiate a chain of reactions resulting in cutaneous damage (photosensitization, phototoxicity).

Some papilloma viral gene products have been shown to bind p53 tumor-suppressor gene protein products in cervical squamous cell carcinomas in women, leading to disruption of the cell cycle regulation. The lesions of sun-induced injury occur in all domestic animals. In horses, lesions occur on the eyelids and nose and around the prepuce. The eyelids of Hereford cattle are also prone to development of lesions. In lightly colored dairy goats, lesions can develop on the lateral aspects of the udder and teats. Lightly pigmented young pigs are also susceptible to more acute solar injury, and the pinnae and tip of the tail can slough if injury is severe. In dogs, lesions develop most commonly in nonpigmented, sparsely haired skin of the ventral abdominal, inguinal, and perianal areas . In cats, gross lesions occur where there is little or no hair and little pigment, particularly on external ear tips, eyelids, nose, and lips, and are most severe in white cats. Grossly, lesions begin as changes in which a cytosine dimer is replaced by two nondimerized thymine bases (CC to TT). Although p53 gene mutations occur in a variety of tumors, those mutations caused by UVR (the C to T or CC to TT mutations) are unique and do not occur with other types of DNA damage or in tumors unassociated with UVR; thus they are termed signature mutations. 3. UVB causes immunosuppression by depressing host cell-mediated immune reactions that normally serve to eliminate or destroy mutated proliferating cells. A variety of mechanisms contribute and involve UVB-damaged keratinocytes, Langerhans cells, dendritic cells, and others. Mechanisms include release of immunosuppressive cytokines such as IL-10 and IL-4, reduction in the number of Langerhans cells (antigen-presenting cells), a switch in Langerhans cell antigen presentation from T H 1 lymphocytes (involved in immune response against tumors) to T H 2 lymphocytes (which release immunosuppressive cytokines), induction of suppressor T lymphocytes, and release of cytokines and other biologic response modifiers that downregulate the immune response.",

For a chemical to cause injury via local application, it must penetrate the hair and protective epidermal layers. Penetration is enhanced by physical damage to the stratum corneum, especially that caused by excessive moisture. Chemical injuries of the skin include contact irritant dermatitis (local application), systemically distributed chemicals, such as arsenic, mercury, thallium, iodine, and organochlorines and organobromines, and poisonings by fungalcontaminated plants and plants containing selenium, mimosine, and trichothecenes. Externally applied agents that produce irritant contact dermatitis induce cutaneous damage by altering the waterholding capacity of the epidermis or by penetrating the epidermis and directly damaging cells. Systemically absorbed and distributed chemical agents cause lesions by a wide variety of mechanisms, some of which are not known. An example is toxicity caused by systemic absorption of some organochlorine and organobromine compounds, such as highly chlorinated naphthalenes, which were used as additives in lubricants for farm machinery such as feed pelleting equipment. As a result, highly chlorinated naphthalenes were frequent feed contaminants. Toxicosis occurred most commonly in cattle, the most susceptible species, and was known as X-disease or bovine hyperkeratosis. Fortunately, this toxicosis is largely historically interesting, because highly chlorinated naphthalenes have not been used in machinery lubricants since the 1950s. Lesions of chlorinated naphthalene toxicity are the result of the interference of the conversion of carotene to vitamin A and result in vitamin A deficiency. Vitamin A is necessary for normal differentiation of stratified squamous epithelium. Clinical lesions consist of alopecia and lichenified, fissured plaques of scale that spare only the legs.

One form is allergic contact dermatitis, which is immunologically mediated and requires prior exposure (sensitization) to the offending agent in a hypersensitive individual (see the discussion on allergic contact dermatitis in the section on Selected Hypersensitivity Reactions). The other form is irritant contact dermatitis, most cases of which are nonimmunologic in origin, and are instead caused by direct contact with substances such as acids, alkalis, soaps, detergents, body fluids (urine or diarrhea scald), wound secretions, some plants, and some topical medications. These substances overwhelm the protective mechanisms of the skin and directly injure cells. It is important to realize that the two types of contact dermatitis can produce very similar histologic lesions, thus differentiation between immune-mediated and irritant contact dermatitis largely depends on history, clinical signs, and anatomic distribution of the lesions. Horses develop lesions on the nose, ventrum, lower limbs, and where riding tack contacts the body, and on the perineum and caudal aspect of the rear legs. In dogs and cats, lesions of irritant contact dermatitis develop on the glabrous (sparsely haired) skin of the abdomen, axillae, flanks, interdigital spaces, perianal area, ventral tail, ventral chest, legs, eyelids, and feet. Grossly, erythematous patches, papules, and rarely, vesicles develop, but self-inflicted trauma can lead to ulcers and crusts. Microscopically, lesions consist of spongiotic dermatitis, neutrophilic vesicopustules, and superficial dermal perivascular neutrophilic inflammation. Chronic lesions consist of epidermal hyperplasia, hyperkeratosis, sometimes confluent parakeratosis, and superficial perivascular inflammation. Lesions synonyms: \"swelled head\" and \"facial eczema.\" Onset of lesions may take only hours and initially include erythema and edema, followed by blisters, exudation, necrosis, and sloughing of necrotic tissue.

Histologically, the lesions resemble a second-degree burn, with suprabasilar or subepidermal bullae formation, dermal edema with fibrin exudation, and a marked leukocytic infiltrate. Reepithelialization occurs over a period of 10 to 60 days. The damage sustained to germinal cells of hair follicles and sebaceous glands leads to alopecia within 2 to 4 weeks after exposure. Hair regrowth follows over the next several months, but damage to sebaceous glands is not reversible and leads to permanent scaling manifesting histologically as hyperkeratosis. The chronic lesions of radiation injury are evident months to years after treatment and are primarily the result of damage to the microvasculature.

Some plants selectively accumulate selenium, regardless of soil selenium content. These selective accumulators (obligate accumulators; e.g., Astragalus, Stanleya) require selenium for growth, generally are not palatable, and are eaten only when other plants are unavailable. Many other plants (facultative accumulators; e.g., Aster, Atriplex) do not require selenium for growth but will accumulate toxic concentrations of selenium if grown in soil with high selenium concentrations. These facultative accumulator plants are commonly eaten by livestock and more often are the cause of poisoning. The mechanism by which selenium is thought to exert its effects on the integument and appendages is through its competitive replacement of sulfur, which modifies the structure of keratin, a sulfurcontaining molecule. Replacement of sulfur by selenium in other molecules can also contribute to toxicity. Acute or chronic selenium poisoning has developed in most domestic animals, although susceptibility to selenium poisoning varies with species, dosage, diet, rate of consumption, chemical form, and other factors. In acute poisonings, signs relate to involvement of multiple organ systems. Chronic selenium toxicity usually develops in livestock (horses, cattle, and sheep) consuming seleniferous forages. It occurs worldwide but is more frequent in Nebraska, Wyoming, and the Dakotas in the United States and in areas of western Canada. Animals with chronic selenium intoxication are emaciated, have poor-quality hair coat, and have partial alopecia.

It occurs in cows with large pendulous udders and develops between the udder and the medial thigh (udder-thigh dermatitis). Intertrigo also occurs in dogs in the skin of the facial fold (brachycephalic breeds), lower lip fold (breeds with large lips such as the Saint Bernard), body fold (Shar-Pei breed), vulvar fold (obese female dogs with a small vulva), and tail fold (dogs with corkscrew tails such as English bulldogs) ( Fig.  17-43) . The cause and pathogenesis involve the presence of closely apposed skin surfaces, frictional trauma between the skin surfaces, accumulated moisture (from tears, saliva, cutaneous glandular secretions, urine, or water after drinking, swimming, or bathing), and bacterial infection. The moisture and frictional trauma predispose to bacterial or yeast overgrowth and subsequent infection. Early gross lesions of intertriginous dermatitis typically consist initially of erythema and edema. Later, pustules, ulcers, and crusts can develop. Late lesions in cows can be severe, with occasional sloughing of skin and subcutis. Microscopically, in early stages there is congestion and edema with early perivascular inflammation that progresses to a more diffuse band of inflammation in the superficial dermis, parallel to the epidermis, but often sparing the dermal-epidermal junction. Inflammatory cells include plasma cells, fewer lymphocytes, neutrophils, and macrophages. In more severe cases there can be exocytosis of neutrophils into the epidermis, epidermal pustules, crusts, ulcers, and in cows, necrosis that leads to sloughing of tissue. If the cause is corrected, early and mild chronic lesions heal without scarring (most cases).

Examples of heat sources include hot liquids, flames, friction, electricity, heating pads, blow dryers, drying cages, and lightning. Longer exposure to lower temperatures is more damaging than shorter exposure to higher temperatures. Dry heat causes desiccation and carbonization, whereas moist heat causes coagulation of tissue. In less severe burns, damage is caused by accelerated cellular metabolism, inactivation of enzymes, and vessel injury. Burns are categorized as partial (first-or second-degree) or full-thickness (third-degree) relative to the layers of skin that are affected. In first-degree burns, only the epidermis is affected, whereas in second-degree burns the epidermis and part of the dermis are damaged. In third-degree (full-thickness) burns, there is coagulation of the epidermis and all dermal components, including connective tissue, blood vessels, and adnexa. Fourth-degree burns are similar to third-degree burns, but damage from these burns extends into the subcutaneous fascia and underlying tissue. Gross lesions of burns vary from erythema and edema caused by capillary dilation and increased capillary permeability (first-degree burn) to vesicle formation as a result of fluid accumulation at the dermal-epidermal junction, which produces the \"burn blister\" (second-degree burn), to desiccation and charring of the epidermis, with underlying amorphous accretion of connective tissue representing the coagulated dermis and adnexa (third-and fourth-degree burn). Microscopically, partial-thickness burns consist of coagulation necrosis of the epidermis, subepidermal vesicles as a result of accumulation of fluid from superficial capillaries (see Fig.  17 -18), necrosis of superficial portions of follicles and sebaceous glands, and degeneration of the subepidermal collagen. In partialthickness burns there is preservation of part of the epidermis or dermal portions of adnexa from which epithelial regeneration develops. Full-thickness (third-and fourth-degree) burns are represented by coagulation of all components of the skin accompanied by acute inflammation. Subcutaneous vasculitis can be present. Partialthickness burns involving the epidermis (first-degree burns) heal completely, because remaining epidermis and epithelium from adnexa reepithelialize the surface, and the dermis and adnexa are intact, so there is no scarring. However, partial-thickness burns that also involve the superficial dermis and superficial adnexa (seconddegree burns) can result in superficial dermal scarring, but the adnexa are preserved. In full-thickness burns, over time, histiocytes infiltrate the tissue, the necrotic tissue sloughs, and the defect is filled in by granulation tissue. Permanent scarring with loss of adnexa results unless skin grafts are performed, and if much of the body is affected, the lesions are life threatening because of fluid loss and possible sepsis from lack of the skin's protective barrier. In human beings the prognosis in severe burn injury can be roughly calculated by adding the patient's age plus the percentage of the body with full-thickness burns (third-degree). If the total is 100, the likelihood of survival is low.",

Heat sources that have caused moderate heat dermatitis include heating pads, heated kennel mats, electric blankets, plant warmers, heat registers, and concrete driveways. When the heat source is in direct contact with the skin, conduction probably plays a role in mediating the injury, but the mechanism at the cellular level by which conductive heating causes moderate heat dermatitis has not been investigated. In dogs and cats the cutaneous lesion distribution typically reflects chronic exposure to moderate heat during lateral or sternal recumbency. Clinical lesions consist of irregular areas of erythema, alopecia, and sometimes hyperpigmentation. Histologic lesions include keratinocyte karyomegaly, atypia, and degeneration; mixed dermal mononuclear inflammation, endothelial degeneration, dermal edema, and focal hemorrhage, a variable number of dermal, wavy, strongly eosinophilic elastic fibers; and adnexal atrophy. Hyperpigmentation is caused by accumulation of melanophages and hemosiderophages in the dermis. Recall that exposure to moderate heat sources (e.g., heating pads on low temperature setting) can also cause thermal burns. Therefore lesions of thermal burns (e.g., coagulation of the epidermis) can coexist with those of moderate heat dermatitis. the skin lesions. There are major differences between different poxviruses and in the range of species they infect; some are species specific and others are zoonotic. Many poxviruses of animals, such as the contagious ecthyma parapoxvirus, can cause skin lesions in human beings. Poxviruses induce lesions by a variety of mechanisms. Lesions develop secondary to poxviral invasion of epidermis, by ischemic necrosis caused by vascular injury, and by stimulation of host cell DNA, resulting in epidermal hyperplasia (see Fig. 17 -32). Hyperplasia may be explained by a gene, present in several poxviruses, including molluscipoxvirus (the cause of molluscum contagiosum), whose product has significant homology with epidermal growth factor. Poxviruses also encode for functions that may counteract host defenses. These include genes related to those encoding the serpins (a superfamily of related proteins important in regulating serine protease enzymes that mediate kinin, complement, fibrinolytic, and coagulation pathways) and genes encoding antiinterferon activities. The severity of poxviral infection varies, depending on whether the infection is localized (cutaneous) or systemic and whether there are secondary infections.",

Other papillomas may be flat, plaquelike lesions that lack the prominent papilliferous projections. Histologically, stratified squamous epithelium is covered by thickened orthokeratotic or parakeratotic stratum corneum, is acanthotic, and in the exophytic and endophytic papillomas, has elongated dermalepidermal interdigitations that project outwardly or inwardly, depending on the type. In some papillomas, keratinocytes, especially of the upper stratum spinosum, are swollen, have clear cytoplasm or a perinuclear halo, and a pyknotic nucleus; these keratinocytes are termed koilocytes (meaning hollow or concave). Keratohyalin granules are often large and irregular. Also, pale basophilic intranuclear inclusion bodies, located in degenerating cells in the outer layers of the stratum spinosum and granulosum in which virion production is taking place, occur in some but not all papillomas. Many papillomas spontaneously regress, and in regressing stages, there is reduced epidermal hyperplasia, increased proliferation of fibroblasts, deposition of collagen, and infiltration of T lymphocytes at the dermal-epidermal interface and in the epithelium. Some papillomas, such as those on the genitalia or concave pinnae (also called ear papillomas or aural plaques) of horses and some affecting the teats of cattle, often do not regress. Viral plaques have been described in dogs and cats. Canine pigmented viral plaques are associated with papillomavirus infection infiltrate. Neutrophils migrate into the epidermis and aggregate in vesicles to form microabscesses. Large intraepidermal pustules can form and sometimes extend into the superficial dermis. There is usually marked epidermal hyperplasia and sometimes pseudocarcinomatous hyperplasia of the adjacent epidermis. This contributes to the raised border of the umbilicated pustule. Rupture or drying of the pustule produces a crust, often colonized on its surface by bacteria. Poxvirus lesions often contain characteristic intracytoplasmic eosinophilic inclusion bodies. These are single or multiple and of varying size and duration. The inclusions are primarily composed of proteins. Sheeppox and goatpox are the most pathogenic poxviruses, and infection causes significant mortality, especially in young animals as a result of systemic disease. Sheeppox and goatpox do not occur in the United States or Canada.",

Cutaneous lesions have rarely been reported in nondermatotropic herpesvirus infections, such as infectious bovine rhinotracheitis (bovine herpesvirus 1) and equine coital exanthema (equine herpesvirus 3), and in cats with FHV-1 infection. Two dermatotropic herpesvirus infections with economic importance are bovine herpesvirus 2 and bovine herpesvirus 4. Herpesviruses can be latent, with inactive virus persisting in tissue such as the trigeminal nerve ganglia. It is speculated that up to 80% of adult cats recovered from FHV-1 infection as kittens or young cats have latent FHV-1 infections. During times of stress the virus is reactivated, and lesions can recur. Herpesviruses infect epithelial cells and replicate in the nucleus, leading to lysis of nuclear contents. As immature viral particles enter the cytoplasm, there is degeneration of cytoplasmic organelles, accumulation of cytoplasmic lipid, and precipitation of protein. Death of keratinocytes leads to spread of virus to neighboring cells, leading to rapid necrosis of focally extensive areas of the epidermis. Gross lesions consist of vesicles that rupture to form ulcers that are then covered by crusts. Microscopic lesions in herpesvirus infections depend on the stage, but early degenerative changes include ballooning and reticular degeneration, the sequelae of degeneration of epidermal cells and acantholysis. Syncytial cells may be seen. Intranuclear inclusions develop, but because of rapidly developing necrosis may not be found except at the margins of ulcers. The appearance of the viral inclusions varies with the specific herpesvirus. Some herpesviruses produce large, hyaline amphophilic inclusions that fill the nucleus (FHV-1), whereas others (dermatotropic bovine herpesvirus 2) produce typical Cowdry type A inclusions, which are also intranuclear but smaller and eosinophilic.",

Fibropapillomas occur in horses, mules, donkeys, cattle, sheep, and cats. These lesions in horses are called sarcoids, which are thought to represent a nonproductive infection by bovine papillomaviruses 1 and 2. Equine sarcoids are locally aggressive, nonmetastatic fibroblastic skin tumors of horses, in certain breeds of dogs (miniature schnauzers, pugs, and Shar-Peis) or in other breeds of dogs that are immunosuppressed.

Until recently Staphylococcus intermedius had been considered the cause of most cases of pyoderma in dogs. However, recent molecular studies involving multilocus gene sequencing have revealed that bacterial isolates phenotypically consistent with S. intermedius consist of three separate species (considered to be the S. intermedius group), which include S. intermedius, S. pseudintermedius, and Staphylococcus delphini. S. pseudintermedius is now considered to be responsible for most cases of pyoderma in dogs, which presents most often as inflammation of the superficial segment of the hair follicle. Coagulase-positive staphylococci are also the most common bacteria isolated from pyoderma in horses (Staphylococcus aureus, S. intermedius), in cattle and sheep (S. aureus), and in goats (S. aureus). Molecular studies will likely be required to identify the species involved in some of these infections, particularly those of the S. intermedius group. Staphylococcus hyicus causes exudative epidermitis in piglets and has been associated with superficial pyoderma in several other species. Many other bacteria can cause skin infections.

In addition, concern is developing regarding potential transmission of antimicrobial-resistant strains of bacteria from animals to human beings and vice versa. Therefore it is important to recognize bacterial infections early and manage them appropriately to avoid increasing the prevalence of antimicrobial-resistant strains of bacteria that adversely affect animal and human health and to which treatment options are becoming limited. Superficial Bacterial Infections (Superficial Pyodermas). Superficial bacterial infections (superficial pyodermas) involve the epidermis and the upper infundibulum of hair follicles, usually heal without scarring, and usually do not involve the regional lymph nodes. Gross lesions include erythema, alopecia, papules, pustules, crusts, and peripheral expanding rings of scale also called \"epidermal collarettes\" (see Table 17 -6). The early microscopic feature of superficial bacterial infection that involves the epidermis is intraepidermal pustular dermatitis. The intraepidermal pustules are fragile and can rupture, leading to crust and superficial scale formation. The major microscopic feature of superficial bacterial infection that involves the follicles is superficial suppurative luminal folliculitis. The cellular infiltrate in and around hair follicles plus dermal congestion and edema correspond to the clinically evident papules and follicularly oriented pustules. Follicular injury leads to alopecia. Although Gram-positive cocci, such as Staphylococcus spp., are usually the cause of the superficial bacterial infections, the bacteria are not always demonstrable histologically, but their presence is often suspected when pustular or luminal exudates contain poorly preserved neutrophils.

These bacteria stimulate an acute inflammatory scalded-skin syndrome, the exfoliative toxins produced by virulent forms of S. aureus cause the loss of adhesion of keratinocytes in the superficial epidermis. These toxins are glutamate-specific serine proteases that cleave a single peptide bond in desmoglein 1, present in the extracellular protein core of the desmosome. The separation of these superficial keratinocytes results in intraepidermal splitting and initiation of lesion development in these infections. In impetigo the S. aureus that produces exfoliative toxins can be isolated from the intact pustules. In contrast, in staphylococcal scalded-skin syndrome, cultures from intact vesicles usually are negative for exotoxinproducing S. aureus, and it appears that the exfoliative toxins are produced in a distant area of infection and reach the skin via the bloodstream (a process called toxemia). Investigative studies in two domestic species (pigs and dogs) suggest that a similar pathogenic mechanism involving exfoliative toxins may play a role in development of superficial pustular dermatitis caused by staphylococci. For example, it has been shown that S. hyicus, which causes exudative epidermitis in piglets, produces an exfoliative toxin that can cleave pig desmoglein 1 and produce cutaneous exfoliation similar to that in pigs with exudative epidermitis. Similarly, an exfoliative toxin isolated from strains of S. pseudintermedius from dogs with pyoderma has caused cutaneous exfoliation when injected into the skin of dogs. In addition, the exfoliative toxin gene has been identified in S. pseudintermedius isolated from skin, wound, and ear infections in dogs, suggesting a role for the toxin in pathogenicity. Although the exfoliative toxins in canine pyoderma have not been fully characterized, these findings suggest that some strains of Staphylococcus spp. in dogs and S. hyicus in pigs may cause superficial bacterial infections via a pathologic mechanism involving exfoliative toxins. Further studies are necessary to determine if exfoliative toxins or other virulence factors contribute to the development of superficial pyoderma in other species.",

Subcutaneous abscesses are localized collections of purulent exudate located within the dermis and subcutis. Abscesses are common in cats because of the frequency of bacterial contamination of puncture wounds. Abscesses also are common in large animals. In addition to puncture wounds, other predisposing causes include foreign bodies, injections, and shearing and clipping wounds. Granulation tissue or mature fibrous connective tissue borders the exudate. Subcutaneous abscesses frequently rupture and drain spontaneously, and heal by scarring. A wide variety of bacteria can cause subcutaneous abscesses.

Other response in which neutrophils migrate from superficial vessels into the dermis and through the epidermis to form intraepidermal microabscesses. The inflammation inhibits further penetration of the bacterium into the dermis. However, residual bacterial organisms subsequently invade the newly regenerated epidermis.

In human beings, toxic shock syndrome is an acute febrile illness that results in hypotension, shock, an extensive cutaneous rash, and involvement of three or more visceral organ systems. The pathogenesis involves the release of bacterial exotoxins (e.g., toxic shock syndrome toxin 1 and enterotoxins) produced by certain strains of S. aureus that usually cause minor or occult infections. The exotoxins act as superantigens and thus do not need to be processed by antigen-presenting cells to cause T lymphocyte activation. As a result, substantial numbers of T lymphocytes are activated in a short period of time, subsequently causing release of proinflammatory cytokines, including TNF-\u03b1, IL-2, IL-1, and INF-\u03b3, which are thought to cause the tissue damage and signs of toxic shock syndrome. Less commonly, group A streptococci are the cause of toxic shock syndrome. However, in contrast to the minor or occult infections associated with S. aureus toxic shock syndrome, the streptococcal toxic shock syndrome is usually associated with bacteremia and severe necrotizing fasciitis (inflammation of the subcutaneous fat and fascial planes). The involved streptococci produce pyrogenic exotoxin A, which has similarities to toxic shock syndrome toxin 1 and is thought to contribute to the development of the syndrome.",

Clinical lesions are either firm or fluctuant nodules connected by thin cords of tissue that represent inflamed lymphatic channels (lymphangitis). The firm nodules consist of pyogranulomatous inflammation with fibrosis and sometimes mineralization. The fluctuant nodules are thickwalled abscesses that can ulcerate, rupture, and drain thick, tan exudate. Small lesions can spontaneously resolve, but larger lesions are persistent. This disease became apparent during the time of intense tuberculosis eradication efforts because infection with these opportunistic mycobacterial organisms can cause false-positive reactions to bovine tuberculin tests.

Horses appear to be particularly susceptible to anthrax infections introduced by biting flies. Cutaneous anthrax may develop in conjunction with outbreaks of gastrointestinal or respiratory anthrax because during outbreaks, vegetative bacteria from exudates or blood of sick or dead animals contaminate the environment and form spores. Spores (or the vegetative form) serve as an available source of infective material that may contact wounds or be transferred by biting flies. Damage to the skin is thought to be important in initiating cutaneous anthrax, which appears clinically in two basic patterns: (1) edematous swellings (horses, cattle, sheep) or (2) rarely as discrete, necrotic areas termed \"carbuncles\" that resemble the more typical lesions of cutaneous anthrax in human beings (cattle, rarely dogs). In domestic animals, edematous swellings in the skin may therefore develop secondary to systemic disease or from primary skin infection. Because the route of infection is not always established, the pathogenesis and significance of cutaneous lesions of anthrax in domestic animals are not always clear. However, in cattle, both edematous swellings and carbuncles of the skin have developed in immunized animals when the herd's resistance to anthrax is waning. Carbuncles also have been reported in the jowl area of dogs, a species considered to have some natural resistance to anthrax. In this example the anthrax bacillus may have been introduced into the skin during ingestion of blood containing the anthrax bacillus. Thus cutaneous carbuncles appear to develop in animals that have cutaneous contact with the anthrax spore or bacillus, and that have partial immunity to anthrax, either natural immunity or that provided via vaccination. In addition, carbuncles in cattle, when present in conjunction with edematous swellings, may help clinically to differentiate cutaneous anthrax from other diseases that cause edematous swellings in this species. Support for the hypothesis that damage to the skin facilitates cutaneous infection comes from experimental murine models of anthrax that revealed spores have limited ability to penetrate nonlesional skin, and that damage to the epidermis results in more intense infections. Damage to the epidermis appears to increase susceptibility of infection of hair follicle contents and residual epidermis, although direct dermal invasion can also occur. Subsequent invasion and proliferation of the organism in the hair follicles and epidermis is thought to facilitate the development of deeper infections.",

Edema is often extensive during early stages of the development of the lesion. The papule progresses to a hemorrhagic vesicle that ruptures and undergoes central necrosis and drying, resulting in a dark eschar (hard crust) with peripheral erythema, termed a carbuncle. The eschar dries and sloughs over a period of 1 necrotizing fasciitis, is painful, hot, and swollen, and pain is disproportionately severe relative to the size of the lesion. The subcutaneous fat, fascia, and overlying skin can become necrotic and can slough. The swelling is caused by necrosis of fat and exudate accumulating between the fascial planes (fasciitis and/or cellulitis).

The mechanism of injury is acute coagulative necrosis of cells caused by bacterial toxins. Spores germinate into vegetative bacteria that develop a capsule and produce a deadly three-part exotoxin (AB toxin) that acts on cell membranes to cause vascular injury, edema, hemorrhage, thrombosis, and infarction (see Chapter 4). The capsule is a major virulence factor, the primary role of which is to establish infection. It does this by protecting the bacterium against various host bactericidal factors and phagocytosis, or if phagocytosed, against phagocyte-mediated killing. Once infection is established, anthrax toxins are produced. Anthrax toxins have three antigenic components that individually lack significant biologic activity, but when two or three of these components are combined together, the new grouping becomes highly potent.",

Pathogenic genera include Epidermophyton, Microsporum, and Trichophyton. Dermatophytosis occurs worldwide, is the most important cutaneous (superficial) mycosis, and is common in human beings and animals, especially cats. Superficial and cutaneous mycoses (dermatophytosis) are acquired by contact with infected animals or by contact with infective material such as shed scales or hair in the environment or on fomites (e.g., combs, brushes, clippers, equine tack). Dermatophytes are able to colonize the cornified structures (hair, claws) and the stratum corneum and cause disease without ever entering living tissue. Clinical disease in a dermatophyte infection is the result of the host's reaction to the organism and its by-products. Dermatophytes are more contagious than other fungal infections, are more common in hot, humid environments, and young animals are more susceptible than adults. Animals kept in overcrowded, dirty, or damp areas and those with inadequate nutrition, or those that are immunosuppressed, are also more susceptible. It is thought that cell-mediated immune response is the principal means of resolving the infection. Fungal species that more commonly infect domestic animals are included in the genera Microsporum and Trichophyton. Epidermophyton is adapted to human beings (anthropophilic) and rarely infects animals. Zoophilic dermatophytes (e.g., Microsporum canis and Trichophyton mentagrophytes) are primary animal pathogens but can infect human beings. M. canis is so well adapted, especially in longhaired, purebred cats that inapparent infections occur. Yorkshire terriers and Persian and Himalayan cats appear to be predisposed to M. canis dermatophytosis. The source of M. canis infections is usually an infected cat. Trichophyton spp. infections are usually acquired by contact with reservoir hosts, which in the case of T. mentagrophytes are rodents or their immediate environment. Geophilic dermatophytes (e.g., Microsporum gypseum) occur in the soil as saprophytes but under favorable conditions can infect human beings and animals if the integrity of the skin is broken or the host immune system is compromised.",

Pythiosis most often affects the skin of the limbs and trunk of horses, cattle, dogs, and cats. Lagenidiosis has been reported only in dogs. Many infections develop in conjunction with exposure to free-standing water. Contamination of minor skin wounds is thought to be necessary for infection to occur. Infections are more common in tropical or subtropical climates, including the Gulf coast of the United States, and are characterized clinically by erythematous, sometimes necrotizing, nodular lesions that ulcerate and drain (Fig. 17-51 ). There can be extensive tissue destruction by inflammation and necrosis. A unique gross feature of pythiosis in the horse is the presence of yellow, friable fragments of necrotic tissue and hyphae, which can be dislodged from the lesions. Pythiosis in the dog is a rapidly progressive, debilitating, and often fatal disease seen most often in young, large-breed dogs. Although cutaneous pythiosis is most common, gastric pythiosis also occurs in dogs of this same signalment. Lagenidiosis in the dog is also a very aggressive disease, and dogs may have lesions in organs other than the skin and lymph nodes. Histologically, hyphae or hyphal-like structures are in areas of eosinophilic to pyogranulomatous dermal or subcutaneous inflammation.

Definitive diagnosis of pythiosis can be made by serologic testing (ELISA), culture, or molecular diagnosis using PCR, but for culture, specific specimen handling and culture techniques are required.

The most important species in North America is S. schenckii, a saprophytic dimorphic fungus found in moist organic debris, and entry into the body is by traumatic implantation. Ulcerated cutaneous nodules and draining sinuses develop at the site of inoculation and along lymph vessels (lymphangitis), but visceral dissemination is uncommon. Deep dermal to subcutaneous pyogranulomatous inflammation develops. Organisms are ovoid to elongate (cigar-shaped) bodies, which are often sparsely distributed and difficult to find in histologic sections but may be detected in cytologic preparations. Immunohistochemical evaluation or culture or both may be required to document infection. The exudate contain- ",

The presence of these ectoparasites is called an infestation. Endoparasites causing cutaneous lesions include nematodes, trematodes, and protozoa, and their presence is called an infection. Parasites cause a number of untoward effects, including damage to hides and predisposition to secondary infection. Arthropod parasites (jointed limbs) also serve as vectors of bacterial, spirochetal, helminthic, rickettsial, protozoal, and viral infections. The cutaneous reaction to parasites varies with parasite number, location, feeding habits, and host immune response. The cutaneous reaction is often mediated in part by immune mechanisms (hypersensitivity). Diagnosis of parasitic infestations and infections requires identification of the specific parasite involved, and this may not be possible with skin biopsy evaluation alone. The only mites that are routinely expected to appear in skin biopsy samples of domestic animals are Demodex spp.",

It is only when the normal equilibrium between the host and the parasite is changed to favor proliferation of the mite that skin lesions of demodectic mange are produced. Thus identification of large numbers of adult mites or an increased number of immature mites in skin scrapings or biopsy samples is required for diagnosis of demodicosis. Demodicosis is llamas, sheep, and dogs. Systemic dissemination of Conidiobolus sp. has developed in the sheep and dog. As in oomycosis, infections are more common in tropical or subtropical climates. Clinical and histologic features are similar to those of oomycosis. Differentiation between entomophthoromycosis and oomycosis requires culture (pythiosis, entomophthoromycosis, lagenidiosis), PCR or ELISA (pythiosis), or rRNA gene sequencing following culture (lagenidiosis) and is therapeutically important because infections with Zygomycetes (true fungi) can be responsive to antifungal treatment, whereas infections with Oomycetes are not. Systemic Mycoses. The respiratory tract, especially the lung, is almost invariably the primary portal of entry and infection in the systemic mycoses, but cutaneous and subcutaneous infections can occur as part of the disseminated disease or by direct implantation of fungi by trauma. Systemic mycoses include Blastomyces dermatitidis, Coccidioides immitis, Cryptococcus neoformans, and Histoplasma capsulatum. Infections with these fungi can occur in animals with apparently normal immune function but are more extensive in immunocompromised animals. Grossly, one or more nodular areas in the skin can ulcerate and have draining sinuses. Histopathologically, there are nodular areas of granulomatous or pyogranulomatous inflammation in the dermis and possibly subcutis. C. neoformans can cause a granulomatous response, but generally the inflammation is less severe than with the other fungi. The cryptococcal organisms have a mucinous capsule that does not stain with H&E. When inflammation is mild, the capsules of the numerous organisms in a lesion give the tissues a multicystic appearance microscopically. Cytologic or microscopic examination is required for diagnosis. The morphologic features of the organisms (including mucicarminepositive capsule of C. neoformans) are usually sufficient for diagnosis; however, culture may be needed in cases when capsule formation is minimal. There are morphologic overlaps between the systemic mycoses, and cultures may be needed to confirm any of these infections when organisms are in low number. See the section on subcutaneous mycoses regarding precautions when submitting cultures for dimorphic fungi.",

Several different demodectic mites have been identified in dogs, D. canis (most common), Demodex injai (rare), and Demodex cornei (rare), a short-bodied mite. D. canis and D. injai live in hair follicles and can be found in sebaceous glands. D. cornei is found on the skin surface. Mixed infections with D. canis and D. injai and D. canis and D. cornei have been reported. D. injai has been associated with generalized demodicosis and a clinically greasy hair coat. D. cornei has been associated with generalized and localized demodicosis. Most cases of canine demodicosis are caused by D. canis, and occur in two clinical forms, localized and generalized, both of which are more common in juvenile dogs. Transmission from mother to offspring occurs via close skin contact, as occurs during suckling. Purebred dogs of many breeds are predisposed to infestation, suggesting an inherited basis for the disease related to a primary deficit in cell-mediated immunity. Research studies suggest the defect is one of T lymphocyte helper dysfunction, resulting in damage by cytotoxic T lymphocytes. Active lesions of demodicosis result in lymphocytic mural folliculitis with lymphocyte-mediated damage to the keratinocytes of the follicular wall. It is speculated that follicular keratinocytes express altered self-antigens or Demodex antigens, which leads to immune-mediated destruction of the follicular wall. Secondary immunodeficiency, caused by T lymphocyte suppression, is also associated with demodicosis, particularly if a secondary S. pseudintermedius infection is present. The secondary immunodeficiency improves as the demodicosis resolves. Results of studies conflict as to whether the secondary immunodeficiency is caused by the accompanying bacterial infection or the mite infestation. Demodicosis occurs in adult dogs with underlying metabolic disorders (hypothyroidism, hyperadrenocorticism) or that are given drugs (glucocorticoids or cytotoxic drugs) that can compromise the immune system. Idiopathic cases also occur.",

Pediculosis occurs more commonly in winter, when temperatures are cooler, the wool or hair coat is longer, animals are congregated, and the plane of nutrition is lower. Thus heavy infestations are usually an indication of underlying problems, such as overcrowding, poor sanitation, or poor nutrition. Generally pediculosis is not a significant threat to the host, and animals with low infestations may not have clinical signs or lesions. Most problems are related to skin irritation and resultant pruritus. However, the Anoplura have piercing mouthparts and suck blood; thus heavy infestations can cause anemia. In addition, Haematopinus suis, a sucking louse that parasitizes pigs, is economically important because the lice transmit Mycoplasma (Eperythrozoon) suis and the viruses of swinepox and African swine fever. The Mallophaga cause less severe signs because they feed on epithelial cellular debris. Primary lesions caused by lice are few, and most are secondary to scratching, rubbing, or biting. The cause of the pruritus is not known but is thought to be a result of more than mechanical irritation alone. Gross lesions consist of papules, crusts, excoriations, and self-induced damage to hair and wool. Lice and eggs are visible on hair or wool. Animals infested with sucking lice can be anemic.

Ticks comprise two families, Ixodidae (hard ticks that have a scutum, a hard chitinous plate on the anterior dorsal surface) and Argasidae (soft ticks that lack the scutum). Most of the pathogenic ticks are in the family Ixodidae. An exception is Otobius megnini, the spinose ear tick, which is parasitic to all domestic animals and causes severe otitis externa. Heavy tick infestations, particularly by adult argasid ticks that engorge repeatedly, can cause anemia. As obligate blood-sucking ectoparasites, ticks also serve as vectors for many potentially severe blood-borne diseases, including, but not limited to, Rocky Mountain spotted fever, borreliosis, babesiosis, anaplasmosis, and ehrlichiosis. Tick bites also cause direct damage to the skin at the site of attachment, which predisposes to secondary bacterial infection leading to abscesses or septicemia and to myiasis. Adverse reactions to ticks depend in part on the content of salivary secretions. Tick saliva has been shown to contain factors that are antihemostatic, antiinflammatory, and immunosuppressive. These factors are thought to facilitate feeding and the transmission of tick-borne diseases. In addition, salivary secretions of several species of ixodid ticks (e.g., Dermacentor andersoni and Dermacentor variabilis in North America) contain neurotoxins that can cause an acute ascending lower motor neuron paralysis of the host. If the tick is removed, symptoms disappear rapidly.",

There are immunologic (foods, drugs, antisera, insect stings, plants such as stinging nettle, and exposure to chemicals) and nonimmunologic (pressure, sunlight, heat, cold, exercise, and stress) stimuli. Immunologic mechanisms involve type I and type III hypersensitivity reactions. Pruritus is not always present, particularly in the horse. A unique form of urticaria has been described in Jersey and Guernsey cattle because of a type I hypersensitivity reaction to casein in their milk. Urticarial lesions are wheals that typically arise suddenly and remain a few hours, although chronic urticaria (lasting weeks or longer) has been described. In sensitive animals, particularly short-haired dogs or purebred horses, pressure applied to the skin can result in linear urticarial lesions called dermographism. In some animals, serum oozes from the wheals matting the hair coat. Angioedema is a localized or generalized area of extensive deep dermal and subcutaneous edema. Histologic lesions in urticaria and angioedema are subtle and consist of vascular dilation and edema with or without perivascular eosinophilic to mixed mononuclear dermatitis and can be overlooked because the edema fluid may be removed during tissue processing.

Pruritus causes horses to bite themselves, rub against objects, stomp their feet, and switch their tails. In dogs, pruritus is often manifested as face rubbing (see Fig. 17-34) , ear scratching, and paw licking. Severely affected dogs may be restless, may not be able to sleep, and may lose weight because of frequent or persistent scratching. Pruritus may affect the face, distal extremities, ears, and ventrum or may be generalized. Pruritus of the distal extremities and otitis externa are frequent features of dogs with atopic dermatitis. Clinical signs of feline atopic dermatitis vary and include pruritus of the face, neck, or ears or generalized pruritus manifested as self-induced trauma or alopecia. In general, atopic dermatitis is considered a disorder without the presence of primary cutaneous lesions. In horses, urticaria may accompany pruritus. In some dogs, papular, macular, or plaquelike eruptions have been reported. Multifocal crusted papules termed \"miliary dermatitis,\" eosinophilic granuloma complex, and symmetric alopecia are often features of feline atopic dermatitis but are not specific to feline atopic dermatitis because they may be seen in other allergic conditions as well. Most cutaneous lesions are secondary, the result of self-inflicted trauma such as excoriations, erythema, and alopecia. More chronic lesions include lichenification and hyperpigmentation. Microscopic lesions have been studied most in affected dogs, Africa, India, and southern Asia. Screwworm flies deposit eggs in wounds or near mucocutaneous junctions of living animals. The eggs develop into first-stage larvae that burrow into tissue headdownwards in a screwlike fashion using sharp, pointed mouth hooks that tear living tissue. Larvae feed on tissues liquefied by secretions of proteolytic enzymes. Screwworm myiasis is an important disease in domestic and wild animals because the larvae develop only in living tissue and thus destroy viable tissue. Grossly, malodorous wounds contain larvae, shreds of tissue, and copious amounts of reddish-brown fluid. Once an animal is infested, death is almost inevitable unless the larvae are removed. Screwworm myiasis is a reportable disease in some countries, including the United States. When it is necessary to differentiate screwworm myiasis from cutaneous myiasis caused by other flies, larvae can be preserved in 70% alcohol and submitted for identification.",

Leishmaniasis occurs in human beings, horses, dogs, cats, and other mammals, but severe disease is usually seen in human beings and dogs. Members of the Leishmania donovani complex (Leishmania donovani and Leishmania infantum [also known as Leishmania chagasi], an intracellular parasite of the mononuclearphagocytic system, cause most infections. Sand flies serve as the vector for infection of animals. Dogs, cats, and rodents serve as reservoirs of infection for human beings. Leishmaniasis is endemic in Mediterranean countries and some parts of Africa, India, the Middle East, Asia, and Central and South America. L. infantum infection is endemic in foxhounds in many states in the eastern United States and in Canadian provinces. It is thought that importation of infected foxhounds to North America led to the breedspecific endemic status of leishmaniasis. There is likely a genetic susceptibility to infection. L infantum can be transmitted directly from dog to dog venerally, transplacentally, and directly by contamination with blood and secretions. Transmission by the sand fly might also occur. Infection and clinical disease do not always correlate. Clinical disease in the foxhound breed is often precipitated by other stressors such as pregnancy or concurrent disease.

Protective immunity is thought to be due to activated T lymphocyte release of cytokines (e.g., TNF-\u03b1, IL-2, and IFN-\u03b3) that upregulate macrophage killing of the organisms. Infected macrophages are also killed by CD8 + cytotoxic T lymphocytes. Clinically, ill dogs infected with Leishmania sp. have reduced T lymphocyte-mediated immunity and increased B lymphocyte proliferation that is thought to be detrimental and responsible for hyperglobulinemia and generation of autoantibodies that can lead to disease (e.g., thrombocytopenia) or that form immune complexes that deposit in tissue and cause disease (e.g., glomerulonephritis, arthritis, uveitis). The leading cause of death in affected dogs is immune complex deposition in glomeruli, which causes chronic protein-losing nephritis that may progress to end-stage kidney disease, nephrotic syndrome, and/or systemic hypertension. The skin is one of the main organs affected in systemic leishmaniasis in dogs. Dogs with the alopecic form of the cutaneous disease have fewer organisms and a more robust cellular immune response, including larger numbers of antigen-presenting Langerhans cells, MHC II-positive keratinocytes, and infiltrating T lymphocytes. In contrast, dogs with the nodular form of cutaneous disease have fewer antigen-presenting cells and greater numbers of macrophages and larger numbers of organisms. Therefore it has been suggested that the clinical and histologic lesions can be useful in establishing a prognosis for remission, in that the character of the lesions reflects immune competence. Cutaneous lesions in dogs consist of generalized alopecia with silvery white scales or more severe lesions of nodules and ulcers. Lesions occur chiefly in anatomic areas in which sand flies feed-around the muzzle (nose), ears, and eyes. Paronychia and deformed claws have also been reported. Microscopically, lesions include hyperkeratosis, parakeratosis, crusts, and granulomatous nodules in the dermis, including periadnexal regions. Accumulations of macrophages, lymphocytes, and plasma cells can efface sebaceous glands. Leishmania spp. are most commonly identified within macrophages; however, they can occasionally be found within other leukocytes, endothelial cells, or fibroblasts. In areas of necrosis the organisms can be free within the interstitium. Leishmania sp. can be distinguished from other protozoa via light microscopy by recognizing the kinetoplast oriented perpendicular to the nucleus. Cytologic examination, histopathologic evaluation, immunohistochemical evaluation, PCR, and serologic testing can help confirm the diagnosis.",

Microscopic lesions have different histopathologic patterns and include perivascular dermatitis, interface dermatitis, epidermal necrosis, vasculitis, vesiculopustular dermatitis, cytotoxic dermatitis, perforating folliculitis (i.e., furunculosis), or panniculitis. The presence of more than one histologic pattern may strongly suggest a hypersensitivity response to a drug.",

Pemphigus represents a complex group of diseases clinically characterized by transient vesicles or bullae and histologically by acantholysis (Table 17 -13). A variety of factors appear to predispose to development of some cases of pemphigus in human beings, including genetic influences, drug intake, viral infections, UVR, emotional stress, and others. In dogs and cats, drug administration has been shown to contribute to some cases of pemphigus, and a few breeds of dogs appear predisposed to developing pemphigus, suggesting that genetic factors may contribute in some dogs. The pemphigus group of diseases is caused by a type II response thought to involve autoantibodies produced against desmosomal proteins (e.g., desmogleins, desmocollins, and plakins), but autoantibodies to nondesmosomal and lesions collected from nontraumatized skin consist of superficial perivascular accumulations of lymphocytes, mast cells, variable numbers of eosinophils, and cells with a histiocytic morphologic appearance. Immunohistochemical evaluation of atopic dog skin has revealed that the lymphocytes are T lymphocytes and the cells with the histiocytic appearance are dendritic antigen-presenting cells. The epidermis is hyperplastic, and sometimes epidermal intercellular edema (spongiosis) progresses to small foci of parakeratosis (see Fig. 17-34, B) . Uncommonly, intraepidermal eosinophils and subcorneal eosinophil microabscesses have been observed in affected dogs. Lesions of self-trauma, such as excoriations, and secondary infections with staphylococci and Malassezia sp. with the accompanying perivascular inflammation and exocytosis of leukocytes into the epidermis, sometimes associated with epidermal or follicular pustules, can mask mild lesions of atopic dermatitis. The inflammation in horses and cats is often deeper than in dogs and consists of perivascular dermatitis with eosinophils as the predominant inflammatory cells. Horses and cats with atopic dermatitis may also develop eosinophilic folliculitis or eosinophilic granulomas. There is no definitive test for atopic dermatitis, so diagnosis is often based on history, clinical signs, physical examination, and ruling out other pruritic diseases with similar presentation (e.g., hypersensitivity to parasites or food). Histopathologic evaluation can be useful in a supportive capacity. Intradermal skin testing and serologic evaluations for elevated levels of allergen-specific IgE are not diagnostic tests but may be considered if immunotherapy is planned.",

Culicoides hypersensitivity in horses is a common worldwide pruritic dermatitis, caused principally by type I and type IV hypersensitivity reactions to salivary antigens from bites of Culicoides sp.

Signs usually develop in horses more than 2 years of age that reside in geographic areas in which Culicoides live, and signs usually worsen with age. Gross lesions depend on the stage of disease and severity of pruritus. Initial lesions are papules. Later-developing lesions are pustules and nodules. Self-trauma can cause excoriations, erosions, and sometimes ulcers, crusts, alopecia, and lichenification. Common sites are the tail base, withers, and head. Microscopic lesions include superficial and usually deep perivascular dermatitis with numerous eosinophils. Some horses also have eosinophilic folliculitis, intraepidermal pustules, crusts, erosions or ulcers, and eosinophilic granulomas.

            "text": "Flea Bite Hypersensitivity. Flea bite hypersensitivity is the most common hypersensitivity dermatitis in dogs and cats. It is mediated by type I and type IV reactions, including cutaneous basophil hypersensitivity. Flea bite hypersensitivity is pruritic. In dogs, cutaneous lesions occur principally along the dorsal lumbosacral area (see Fig.  17 -53), ventral abdomen, caudomedial aspects of the thighs, and flanks. In cats, lesions occur around the neck but can be generalized, especially in highly sensitive animals. Secondary lesions are caused by self-inflicted trauma. Grossly, there is a papular dermatitis with secondary excoriations. Chronic lesions include lichenification, which is nonspecific (see Table 17 -6), and some dogs develop multiple firm alopecic nodules (fibropruritic nodules) in the dorsal lumbosacral area. Microscopically, flea bite hypersensitivity in dogs consists of superficial perivascular dermal accumulations of mast cells, basophils, eosinophils, lymphocytes, and histiocytes. Occasionally, small foci of epidermal necrosis and eosinophils called nibbles are seen, which strongly suggest flea bite hypersensitivity. histologic disease. The pathogenesis of acantholysis is not fully understood and is an active area of investigation. However, the autoantibodies to desmogleins are considered pathogenic because they induce acantholysis when injected into neonatal mice and also cause keratinocyte disassociation in cell culture. There are multiple theories of how autoantibodies cause acantholysis, which may not be mutually exclusive. One theory suggests that the antibodies cause steric hindrance of the desmoglein adhesion site, interfering directly with adhesion. Another theory suggests that antibody binding to desmosomes triggers intracellular signaling pathways that cause disruption of desmosomes and loss of intercellular cohesion by inducing separation of the desmosomal plaque from the intermediate filament cytoskeleton and/or interfering with desmosome turnover. Another relatively recent theory, the multiple hit hypothesis, was developed in part due to discrepancies in correlation of autodesmoglein antibodies alone with type and severity of clinical disease in affected human beings, together with the discovery of other antigens that can be targeted by pemphigus autoimmunity, including not only the proteins may also play a role. Traditionally the most important protein antigens thought to contribute in various species are desmoglein 1 and desmoglein 3, and recently desmocollin 1 in dogs. Desmosomes are the sites where cells of the stratum spinosum attach to each other, and during fixation and processing for microscopic examination, the cells of the stratum spinosum contract, except for the desmosomal attachments, which provide the appearance of \"spines\" or intercellular bridges (see the discussion in the section on Structure, Epidermis). These desmosomal protein antigens are found in various stratified squamous epithelia, including skin, mucocutaneous junctions, oral mucosa, esophagus, and vagina. Damage to desmosomes is thought to result in acantholysis, leading to the formation of vesicles or bullae within varying levels of the epidermis and mucosal epithelia according to the location of the target antigen. Antibodies to more than one of the desmosomal proteins have been identified in affected human beings and dogs, and differences in the specific desmosomal protein or proteins targeted may contribute to some of the morphologic variations in clinical and distribution pattern of lesions. Antibodies targeting desmoglein 1 cause cutaneous, rather than oral, lesions, and the acantholytic process occurs at a superficial level in the epidermis, producing clinical lesions that are typically exfoliative (Fig. 17-55) . Pemphigus foliaceus in animals is thought to be similar to that in human beings. In fact, autoantibodies to desmoglein 1 have been identified in the serum of a small percentage of dogs with pemphigus foliaceus. However, autoantibodies to desmocollin 1, a desmosomal protein also located in the superficial epidermis, have been identified in the sera of a larger population of dogs with pemphigus foliaceus; thus desmocollin-1 is now thought to be a major autoantigen in canine pemphigus foliaceus. Thus it appears that pemphigus foliaceus is immunologically heterogeneous and that autoantibodies, including those directed toward desmosomal proteins, contribute to the pathogenesis of canine pemphigus foliaceus. Autoantibodies involved in the development of pemphigus foliaceus have not been studied in horses, goats, or cats. The gross lesions are similar in all species. The primary lesions consist of transient vesicles that rapidly become pustules, which can be localized to specific areas of the skin (nose, pinnae, periocular skin, pawpads, claw beds, and coronary bands) or can be more generalized and symmetric. The pustules are in the superficial epidermis, covered by only a small amount of stratum corneum or a few epidermal cells. Because the pustules are fragile, they quickly rupture from minor mechanical pressure on the surface, and this leads to secondary crusts, scales, alopecia, and superficial erosions desmosomal cadherins, but other adhesion molecules, cell membrane receptors, and mitochondrial proteins. Some of the autoantibodies to nondesmosomal antigens involved in cell adhesion (including the keratinocyte acetylcholine receptors) have induced pemphigus-like lesions when injected into neonatal mice, suggesting that these other autoantibodies contribute to acantholysis in some forms of pemphigus. The multiple hit hypothesis proposes that acantholysis in pemphigus is caused by the synergistic and cumulative effect of autoantibodies targeting keratinocyte cell membrane antigens of different kinds that include molecules that regulate cell shape and adhesion (e.g., acetylcholine receptors) and molecules that mediate cell-to-cell adhesion (e.g., desmosomal cadherins), and that the severity of disease depends on the ratio of different kinds of autoantibodies in each case. Future research may clarify the pathogenesis of acantholysis in pemphigus disorders and lead to more specific therapies.",

The disease develops spontaneously and in dogs and cats, as an adverse reaction to drug therapy. In human beings, pemphigus foliaceus autoantibodies recognize the desmosomal protein, desmoglein 1, which is expressed predominantly in the upper layers of the epidermis. This expression pattern of desmoglein 1 in conjunction with expression patterns of other intercellular adhesion molecules and signaling pathways appears to play a role in location of the vesicles and the anatomic Y -Autoantibody CHAPTER 17 The Integument vulgaris (including desmoglein 1) and were thought to contribute in one horse with pemphigus vulgaris (desmoglein 1). It is thought that the distribution patterns of desmoglein 3 in conjunction with desmoglein 1 in skin and oral mucosa in combination with antibodies to other proteins involved in intercellular adhesion result in vesicular lesions deep in the epidermis, oral mucosa, or both. Thus some forms of pemphigus vulgaris largely affect the oral mucosa (mucosal-dominant pemphigus vulgaris), whereas others affect the skin and oral mucosa (mucocutaneous pemphigus vulgaris). The deep vesicular lesions lead to formation of vesicles or secondary erosions and ulcers in the oral mucosa, at mucocutaneous junctions, and/or skin subject to mechanical stress such as in the axilla or groin. Animals can be febrile, depressed, and anorectic and have leukocytosis. Drooling is often a presenting complaint, because involvement of the oral mucosa is almost always present. Microscopic lesions consist of separation of keratinocytes of the lower epidermis owing to loss of intercellular attachments. However, basal cell keratinocytes remain attached to the basement membrane, resulting in a suprabasilar vesicle leaving a row of basal cells attached to the basement membrane (\"row of tombstones\") (see Fig. 17-16 ). There usually is accompanying superficial perivascular to interface mixed inflammation. Direct IF or IHC reveal immunoglobulin and sometimes complement in the intercellular epidermis. Indirect IF has revealed circulating antikeratinocyte antibodies, typically toward desmoglein 3. Paraneoplastic Pemphigus. Paraneoplastic pemphigus (PNP) is a rare, aggressive form of pemphigus, often but not always associated with solid or hematopoietic neoplasms (see Table 17 -13). Paraneoplastic pemphigus has been documented in human beings, dogs, and a putative case in one cat. Cutaneous lesions can precede detection of the neoplastic process and are resistant to treatment. Lesions consist of severe mucosal and mucocutaneous blisters and erosions. Histologically, lesions have a combined or blended pattern of erythema multiforme (a form of cytotoxic dermatitis) together with suprabasilar acantholysis resembling pemphigus vulgaris. Lymphohistiocytic cell-rich interface dermatitis with apoptosis of keratinocytes is present. In addition, lymphocytes border apoptotic keratinocytes (this is often called lymphocytic satellitosis). The pathomechanism for paraneoplastic pemphigus is unknown. Labeling of intercellular bridges is detected by IHC or IF. In human beings with paraneoplastic pemphigus serum autoantibodies targeting multiple cutaneous antigens, including desmoglein 3, desmoplakins, bullous pemphigoid antigens, envoplakin, periplakin, and others, have been reported. Similarly in paraneoplastic pemphigus-affected dogs, autoantibodies to envoplakin, periplakin, desmoglein 3, and desmoplakins have been reported; thus paraneoplastic pemphigus in dogs appears similar to paraneoplastic pemphigus in human beings and likely has an immunologic basis.",

Pustules contain neutrophils, less often eosinophils, and acantholytic keratinocytes. The acantholytic keratinocytes may \"cling\" to the roof of the pustules or may lift from the base of pustules, and occur in clusters. In dogs, cells resembling apoptotic keratinocytes have been noted, but their significance is unknown. Pustules are often large, broad, and extensive and bridge multiple follicles. The pustules may affect the follicular infundibulum. Pustules progress to crusts. In the horse, subcorneal or intragranular pustules are observed, but in the dog, pustules may occur in the stratum spinosum. Crusts should be included in the biopsy sample, especially if well-developed pustules are no longer present because laminated crusts with acantholytic cells can help establish the histologic diagnosis. The laminated crusts are composed of multiple layers of dried pustules, one on top of the other, which result from previous episodes of vesicle and pustule formation at the site. The dermis contains perivascular to interstitial accumulations of mixed inflammatory cells. Eosinophils are the predominant inflammatory cell in approximately one-third of the canine and equine cases.

In human beings the autoantibodies are directed toward bullous pemphigoid antigen 1e (BPAG1e), a 230-kD intercellular antigen, and type XVII collagen (also called BPAG2), a 180-kD hemidesmosomal transmembrane molecule. In animals, type XVII collagen has been identified as the major antigen. Bullous pemphigoid has been reported in the horse, Yucatan minipig, dog, and cat. The pathogenesis of vesicle formation is thought to involve a type II immunologic response in which autoantibody binds to the target antigen, and complement activation develops (see Table 17 -5). This leads to mast cell degranulation, recruitment and activation of neutrophils and eosinophils, and release of a variety of proteolytic enzymes that result in loss of cell-to-matrix adhesion and in subepidermal vesiculation. It is also possible that autoantibodies might interfere directly with target antigen function or activate cellular signaling and induction of proinflammatory cytokines. Clinical lesions are similar between species and consist of vesicles, erosions, ulcers, and crusts. The location and severity of clinical lesions vary. In horses, lesions are severe and associated with systemic signs; involve the oral mucosa, the squamous lining of the esophagus, and the stomach in some cases; and are generalized in the skin (Fig. 17-56) . In Yucatan minipigs, lesions are usually limited to the skin of the back and rump. Dogs are usually mildly affected and have cutaneous lesions in the skin of the abdomen and axillae, concave pinnae, or mucocutaneous junctions. Oral lesions occur in approximately half the dogs. Cats usually have few lesions limited to the face and oral mucosa. Separation of the hemidesmosomes of the basal layer cells from the upper lamina lucida of the basement membrane leads to the microscopic lesions of vesicles and bullae, often with eosinophils and neutrophils in the superficial dermis or within the subepidermal vesicles. Lesions in dogs and pigs have more inflammatory cells than those in horses and cats. Direct IF staining most commonly reveals IgG and in some dogs complement, linearly distributed at the dermoepidermal junction. Evaluation of salt-split epithelial substrates with indirect IF reveals staining on the epithelial side of the artificial split, helping to differentiate bullous pemphigoid from epidermolysis bullosa acquisita, in which staining is located in the sublamina densa or dermal side of the artificial split. The presence of eosinophils is considered to be suggestive of bullous pemphigoid. autoantibodies to other proteins involved in intercellular adhesion have been identified. Some of the dogs diagnosed with pemphigus vegetans have not had oral lesions. In another dog with lesions suggestive of pemphigus vegetans, antibodies to desmoglein 1 rather than desmoglein 3 were identified; thus the rare cases of pemphigus vegetans diagnosed in dogs to date are not directly comparable to those in the human.",

It appears to represent a variant of pemphigus foliaceus. The term was originally developed when a facially predominant form of pemphigus foliaceus was identified in Akitas, Chow Chows, and a few other breeds of dogs, and there appeared to be a need to reconsider the classification of pemphigus subtypes. The principal diagnostic feature used to distinguish dogs with panepidermal pustular pemphigus from those with pemphigus foliaceus is based solely on histopathologic evaluation: the presence of acantholytic cell-containing pustules that span all layers of the epidermis and the follicular infundibular ORS (e.g., pustules located in deeper epidermis than typical for pemphigus foliaceus [see Fig. 17-17, B] ). An explanation for the difference in pustule depth may simply reflect the regional variation in various antigens targeted by autoantibodies in different anatomic locations of canine skin. For example, it has been shown that desmoglein 1 can be identified on keratinocytes in all layers of the epidermis in skin from the dorsal muzzle, pinna, and pawpads, whereas desmoglein 1 is detected only in the upper layers of the epidermis in skin from the shoulder, groin, or abdomen. Thus the difference in desmoglein expression could influence pustule location. Further classification of subtypes of pemphigus requires in-depth studies, including immunopathology, as well as the results of therapeutic trials.",

The autoimmune subepidermal blistering dermatoses should be differentiated from the inherited/congenital bullous dermatoses (see section on Disorders of Domestic Animals, Congenital and Hereditary Disorders, Epidermolysis Bullosa [Red Foot Disease]), and from adverse reactions to drug therapy. Much of what is known about the autoimmune subepidermal blistering dermatoses has been borrowed from the human literature, where these diseases are classified based on clinical, histologic, and immunologic features that identify target antigens and autoantibodies. In domestic animals, due to the rarity of these diseases and difficulty and cost of producing stable recombinant antigens, in-depth immunologic classifications are typically limited to research laboratories and have been performed mostly in dogs; however, a few autoimmune subepidermal blistering dermatoses have been identified in the horse, pig, and cat. In the veterinary setting, diagnosis of these diseases is largely based on information obtained from previous research studies that have documented breed predispositions, clinical lesion distribution patterns, and histologic features that help identify lesions consistent with autoimmune subepidermal blistering dermatoses, and that rule out other diseases that can cause vesicles or bullae (e.g., vesicular cutaneous lupus erythematosus, dermatomyositis, and CHAPTER 17 The Integument superficial layers of the epidermis and/or hair follicles, hyperkeratosis and parakeratosis result in the clinical features of thick scale/crust and comedones.",

Factors involved in development include genetic predisposition, viral infections, hormones, and UV light. Systemic lupus erythematosus is a disease of immune dysregulation, with abnormalities in both cellular and humoral immunity, including defective T lymphocyte suppressor function and cytokine dysregulation. The defective T lymphocyte suppression function may be caused by anti-T lymphocyte antibodies or a primary suppressor T lymphocyte deficiency. The defective T lymphocyte suppression function results in B lymphocyte hyperactivity and in the formation of autoantibodies to a variety of membrane and soluble antigens, including nucleic acids. Antibodies are also directed to organspecific antigens, clotting factors, and cells (e.g., erythrocytes, leukocytes, and platelets). The antinuclear antibody titer should be positive. Although the autoantibodies can damage tissue, the principal mechanism of injury in systemic lupus erythematosus occurs via antigen-antibody binding (i.e., immune-complex formation), and deposition of the antigen-antibody complexes in a variety of tissues, including skin. The deposition of these immune complexes, which in the skin occurs at the basement membrane and in the walls of dermal blood vessels, results in a type III hypersensitivity response. Lesions are intensified by exposure to UV light. The enhanced damage may occur via UV-induced expression of nuclear antigens on the keratinocyte surface, autoantibody binding to the newly expressed antigens with resultant keratinocyte damage, and release of keratinocyte cytokines (e.g., IL-1, IL-6, and TNF-\u03b1). UV light may also act by inducing the expression of adhesion molecules, thus facilitating trafficking of leukocytes to the epidermis. Systemic signs are variable but can include polyarthritis, myositis, fever, anemia, proteinuria (from glomerulonephritis), and thrombocytopenia.",

Interface dermatitis, more recently referred to as cytotoxic dermatitis, is a histologic pattern of inflammation that affects the dermal-epidermal junction (interface), and that is importantly associated with damage to basal cells (see Fig. 17-14) or in some instances, more superficially located keratinocytes. Basal cells are damaged by oncosis (hydropic or vacuolar degeneration) or apoptosis (shrunken cells due to programed cell death), whereas damage to more superficial keratinocytes is typically due to apoptosis (see Fig. 17-12) . The inflammation can be sparse and referred to as cell poor, or dense and referred to as cell rich. This type of dermatitis is referred to as cytotoxic because the pathogenesis in part involves T lymphocyte-mediated cytotoxicity of epidermal basal cells or keratinocytes. The clinical features of this histologic reaction pattern are quite variable, the cause of which is not completely understood; however, the location of the apoptotic keratinocytes correlates to a degree with the clinical lesions. For example, if the apoptosis or cellular damage is more prevalent in the basal layer of the epidermis, depigmentation, erosions, and ulceration result from loss of basal layer keratinocytes and melanocytes. In contrast, if apoptosis is more prevalent in the interface lymphocytic dermatitis with hydropic degeneration of basal cells, keratinocyte apoptosis, and extensive vesicles and bullae at the dermal-epidermal junction that progress to ulcers.

            "text": "Epidermal Necrolysis. Erythema multiforme (EM), Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS), and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) are uncommon to rare conditions affecting the skin and sometimes mucous membranes. They have been reported in human beings, horses, cattle, pigs, dogs, and cats. They have been studied most extensively in the human and less so in the dog. Until recently the conditions were considered to represent different expressions or severity of the same clinical disease with erythema multiforme at the mild end and toxic epidermal necrolysis at the severe end of the spectrum. However, in-depth studies scrutinizing the character and extent of clinical and histologic lesions in correlation with the clinical history have prompted a modification. Currently erythema multiforme in human beings is considered to be a separate entity with approximately 90% of cases associated with herpesvirus infection, and now called herpes-associated erythema multiforme (HAEM), but only viral fragments, such as DNA polymerase, and not complete virions are detected in erythema multiforme lesions and thus herpes-associated erythema multiforme is not a productive or active viral infection. Less commonly erythema multiforme in human beings is associated with other infections or is drug associated. In contrast, Stevens-Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis most often represent adverse reactions to drug therapy. Classification of erythema multiforme, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, and toxic epidermal necrolysis in animals is controversial. The results of one multicenter study aimed at better defining these conditions in dogs suggested that although Stevens-Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis were likely to be associated with drug exposure, erythema multiforme was not. A variety of causes for animal erythema multiforme have been proposed, but are usually not proven. These include infections, neoplasia, and adverse responses to dietary substances, drugs, or vaccinations. Virus infections have been implicated as a possible cause of erythema multiforme in animals, including herpesviruses (horses, pigs, cats) and parvovirus (dogs), but these infections either are not proven definitively as a specific cause or they differ from herpes-associated erythema multiforme by being active or productive infections. Most cases of animal erythema multiforme remain idiopathic. Drugs (sulfonamides, cephalexin, levamisole, and others) appear to be the main cause of Stevens-Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis in animals, but drug causation is not usually proven because of the unwillingness to purposely reexpose a patient to the suspected offending drug. However, a new disease-specific algorithm, termed Assessment of Drug Causality in Epidermal Necrolysis, has been validated in human beings with Stevens-Johnson syndrome/toxic epidermal necrolysis. It has been used in a few dogs and shows promise in helping determine if a drug may have contributed to development of toxic epidermal necrolysis interface. In addition, there are apoptotic basal cells resulting in loss of epidermal pigment that is phagocytosed by dermal macrophages (pigmentary incontinence). As with systemic lupus erythematosus , the basal cell degeneration can, in more severe cases, lead to subepidermal vesicles, loss of the epidermis, and ulceration and crusting. The major differential diagnosis of DLE includes mucocutaneous pyoderma (see section on Superficial Bacterial Infections, Diseases of Dogs), which is differentiated from DLE by the succesful treatment of mucocutaneous pyoderma with antibiotic therapy.",

Discoid lupus erythematosus, which is differentiated by the usual restriction of lesions to the skin of the face in DLE. Exfoliative cutaneous lupus erythematosus was formerly known as lupoid dermatosis of the German short-haired pointer. Lesions develop in German short-haired pointers between 3 months and 3 years of age. Clinical lesions consist of scaling and crusting first seen on the face, ears, and back. Lesions then become generalized. The lesions persist but wax and wane. Fever and lymphadenopathy can be present. Rarely there is a positive antinuclear antibody titer. Histologic lesions consist of lymphocytic interface dermatitis with hydropic degeneration of basal cells and apoptosis of keratinocytes. Interface inflammation also affects the basal cells of follicles and sebaceous glands, resulting in sebaceous gland atrophy. Vesicular cutaneous lupus erythematosus is a disorder formerly known as ulcerative dermatosis of the collie and Shetland sheepdog. Lesions develop in middle-aged to older dogs. The Shetland sheepdog, rough collie, and border collie appear predisposed to lesion development. Dogs with this form of lupus have a negative antinuclear antibody titer, but some have antibodies to extractable (soluble) nuclear antigens (e.g., Ro/SSA and La/SSB). Clinical lesions develop most commonly in the groin and axillary areas but may also occur in the mucocutaneous junctions around eyes, mouth, external genitalia, and anus. Lesions consist of vesicles and bullae that progress to ulcers. Lesions can be cyclic and worsen in association with estrus. Lesions also tend to occur in spring and summer; season plus location in less-haired areas has suggested a possible role for sunlight in the pathogenesis of lesions. Histologic lesions include CHAPTER 17 The Integument purpuric (purple or red, due to hemorrhage) macules and patches that rapidly progress into painful confluent erosions. The epidermis detaches easily (necrolysis means separation of tissue due to necrosis) and forms large areas of translucent sheets that peel from the dermis. Lesions are often present on the face, medial pinnae, and mucocutaneous junctions (especially periocular and perilabial) but can be more widespread. Interdigital skin can be affected, and pawpad involvement is reported in some cases. Histologically, lesions resemble those in erythema multiforme and Stevens-Johnson syndrome with apoptotic keratinocytes in all levels of the epidermis or mucosa, usually accompanied by lymphocytes (lymphocytic satellitosis), but the number and location of apoptotic cells can vary. Full-thickness coagulative necrosis of the epidermis is also a feature. Hair follicles, particularly the follicular infundibulum, are similarly affected. Dermal inflammation in the acute lesions may be minimal and only present in small areas. When present, lymphocytes are at the dermal-epidermal interface and in the superficial perivascular dermis. The coagulative necrosis lesions in toxic epidermal necrolysis are distinguished from thermal burns by the lack of dermal necrosis in toxic epidermal necrolysis. The diagnosis of erythema multiforme, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, and toxic epidermal necrolysis requires both clinical and histologic findings because although there are some histologic differences, those differences may be subtle or evade detection in individual cases for various reasons that include low sample number or sample ulceration. Thus these conditions cannot be reliably differentiated by histopathologic evaluation alone. The presence of systemic signs and the extent of clinical involvement that includes the presence or absence of mucosal lesions are paramount. Similarly, there are other conditions in which keratinocyte apoptosis is present in multiple layers of the epidermis that may require differentiation from some cases of erythema multiforme, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, and toxic epidermal necrolysis. These include graft-versus-host disease in which bone marrow transplantation has occurred (usually experimentally), exfoliative dermatitis in cats with and without thymoma (see section on Disorders of Cats, Paraneoplastic Syndromes), and proliferative, lymphocytic, infundibular mural folliculitis and dermatitis with prominent follicular apoptosis and parakeratotic casts in dogs (see section on Disorders of Dogs).",

The histologic diagnosis of cutaneous vasculitis is challenging because it can be difficult to distinguish between inflammatory cells targeting a vessel from inflammatory cells simply migrating through a vessel en route to an area of inflammation elsewhere in the epidermis or dermis. Disproportionate numbers of inflammatory cells in the vessel wall in comparison to the surrounding dermis suggest the vessel is a target of the inflammation. Vasculitis can be primary or secondary to systemic processes such as drug ingestion (e.g., sulfonamides), connective tissue disease (e.g., systemic lupus erythematosus), infections (e.g., R. rickettsii, E. rhusiopathiae), or it may be incidental to a local process such as ulceration or a thermal burn. In many instances the cause of the vasculitis is unknown (idiopathic). Two principal mechanisms are thought to contribute to the pathogenesis of vasculitis; these are direct invasion of vessels by infectious agents (e.g., Rickettsia, herpesvirus) and immune-mediated mechanisms (e.g., lesions. The pathogenesis in erythema multiforme, as well as Stevens-Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis, is thought to involve a misdirected cell-mediated (type IV) immune response against antigens (foreign peptides that are components of infectious agents, drugs, or others) expressed on the surface of keratinocytes. The main effector cells are the cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CD8 + lymphocyte) (see Table 17 -5) and natural killer lymphocytes that recognize and bind to the foreign peptide-MHC I complex on the surface of keratinocytes, resulting in apoptosis. In erythema multiforme the apoptosis of keratinocytes is typically patchy and associated with lymphocyte-mediated direct cytotoxicity, which contrasts to Stevens-Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis, where apoptosis is usually more extensive and in some areas may be confluent. The pathogenesis for the more extensive apoptosis in Stevens-Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis is unclear, but the number of inflammatory cells in affected human beings is considered too few to cause such widespread keratinocyte apoptosis. Soluble mediators, such as granulysin released by cytotoxic T lymphocytes and natural killer lymphocytes, and perforin and Fas ligand are considered responsible for the widespread keratinocyte death. The role of soluble mediators in the pathogenesis of Stevens-Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis in animals is unknown.",

Although some early lesions of erythema multiforme may resemble urticaria, in contrast to true urticaria, erythema multiforme lesions are not transient. The erythema disappears centrally, producing target-like lesions that are most common on the trunk, axillae, and groin but may be seen on the inner pinnae, footpads, and mucocutaneous junctions. The erythematous areas may progress to vesicles, erosions, ulcers, serpiginous erythematous lesions (see Fig.  17-12) , or thick, scaly, or crusted plaques. Erythema multiforme can occur in minor or major forms, depending on the extent of clinical involvement. In erythema multiforme minor, usually either mucosal surfaces are not involved or lesions are restricted to one site. In contrast, more extensive mucous membrane and cutaneous involvement are seen in erythema multiforme major, referred to as Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) by some authors, in which clinical lesions may be more extensive, hemorrhagic, vesiculobullous, and ulcerative. Erythema multiforme may have a mild, self-limiting clinical course, and lesions may resolve, especially if the triggering factor is identified and removed. However, especially in dogs and unlike most cases of herpes-associated erythema multiforme in people, the clinical course tends to be chronic or relapsing and may last for years. Systemic signs have been described and are more likely to occur in more severe cases (e.g., erythema multiforme major or Stevens-Johnson syndrome). Histologically, individual keratinocytes in all layers of the epidermis undergo apoptosis (see Fig. 17 -12) and are surrounded by lymphocytes (lymphocytic satellitosis). Apoptotic keratinocytes can coalesce, leading to the clinically visible erosions and possibly ulcers.

Both Stevens-Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis are considered clinical emergencies with a high mortality rate in all species. Toxic epidermal necrolysis in particular is a life-threatening disorder that begins clinically as widespread, irregularly shaped, erythematous or infundibular hyperkeratosis and increased trichilemmal cornification; reduced numbers of growing (anagen) follicles; increased numbers of resting (telogen) hair follicles, which may vary with breed; and increased numbers of follicles that lack hair shafts and may also be atrophic (kenogen follicles, also called hairless telogen follicles). Although these general features, including increased numbers of kenogen follicles, support the diagnosis of an endocrinopathic dermatosis, they are not usually diagnostic for a specific endocrine disorder. Also, inflammation caused by secondary seborrhea or pyoderma or previous glucocorticoid therapy for concurrent allergic dermatitis frequently complicates the microscopic changes. Selected clinical and histologic features of individual endocrine disorders (e.g., clinical evidence of epidermal, dermal, and muscle atrophy and histologic evidence of mineral deposition in the case of hyperglucocorticoidism) in conjunction with medication history and clinical testing are used to establish a more definitive diagnosis. Cutaneous endocrine disorders are more common in dogs than in horses, ruminants, or cats.",

The type of inflammatory cell may suggest the pathogenesis. For example, eosinophils may predominate in allergic reactions (arthropod bites or collagenolytic granulomas), neutrophils may predominate in immunologic reactions associated with immune complex deposition (lupus erythematosus, some drug reactions), and lymphocytes may predominate in cell-mediated immune responses (malignant catarrhal fever). However, the cell type may simply reflect stage of disease rather than the mechanism, and in many cases the cellularity is mixed. In animals, type III hypersensitivity reactions (immune complex-mediated processes) are thought to contribute to many cases of immunologic vasculitis, but it is likely that multiple immunologic mechanisms contribute. Evidence for the role of immune complex deposition is derived from experimental studies (Arthus phenomenon and serum sickness) and from identification of immune complexes in serum and tissues in patients with vasculitis caused by infectious agents and hypersensitivity reactions to drugs. Thus infectious agents can contribute to immune complex-mediated vasculitis. The immune complexes can form in the circulation, in the vessel wall, or both.",

Many breeds are affected, but English bulldogs, boxers, and Airedale terriers are among the more commonly affected breeds. Alopecia develops fairly rapidly, seasonally or cyclically in the skin of the flank (Fig. 17-57) . Alopecia usually has a bilaterally symmetric pattern, but there may be variation in severity from one side to another, and alopecia may also involve more cranial areas of the skin such as the shoulder. There may be patches of unaffected (fully haired) skin located within alopecic areas. Hyperpigmentation usually accompanies alopecia. Histopathologic evaluation of the most alopecic areas in the relatively early stages of the disease reveals follicles in the telogen stage of the hair cycle, generally without hair shafts (hairless telogen/kenogen), and follicles markedly dilated by hyperkeratosis. The follicular hyperkeratosis also distends the openings of secondary follicles as they enter the primary follicle, giving the follicles the distorted appearance of an upsidedown \"footprint\" (see Fig. 17 -57). The portions of the primary and secondary follicles below the infundibulum may be present in irregular wavy configurations. Biopsy samples collected late in the clinical course of disease or in the stage just before hair growth resumes have numerous anagen follicles, which indicates hair regrowth should be forthcoming.

Traction alopecia in dogs and posttraumatic alopecia in cats are presumed a result of interference with the local blood supply to follicles and adjacent skin. Traction alopecia develops in long-haired breeds of dogs in which rubber bands or other devices are used repeatedly or continuously to apply tension to the hair. Lesions usually occur on the top of the head or on the ears, the location where the traction devices are usually applied. Posttraumatic alopecia has been reported in cats that have suffered traumatic pelvic fracture. Alopecic lesions develop on the lower or caudal back several weeks after the fracture. The gross lesion in both conditions is alopecia, which is long term and generally permanent. Histologically, in both traction alopecia and posttraumatic alopecia, follicles are in hairless telogen, are atrophic, and may be partially or completely lost and replaced by dermal fibrosis. Adnexal glands are also usually atrophic and may be absent. In traction alopecia some follicles may contain damaged hair shafts (malacic hairs) or melanin pigment debris, indicating previous poorly characterized disorders recognized most commonly in dogs (Box 17-11) but occasionally in horses, cattle, and cats. Structure refers to the permanent physical structure of the hair follicle in contrast to temporary changes that may occur cyclically. The conditions can be congenital (present at birth; see the section on Disorders of Domestic Animals, Congenital and Hereditary Disorders) or tardive (develop months to years after birth) (see Table 17 -9). Clinical lesions are alopecia or hypotrichosis, and consequently in animals that develop tardive structural follicular dysplasia, there may be clinical resemblance to the endocrine disorders. The microscopic features help to differentiate syndromes of follicular dysplasia from the endocrine dermatoses.

The hair loss developed in November, resolved in May or June, and recurred in November. The horses were otherwise healthy. Histopathologic evaluation of affected skin revealed the follicles were in a regressing stage of the hair cycle and dermal inflammation was minimal. Although the nutrient content of the feed (hay and silage in this case) was normal, supplements with vitamins, iodine, cobalt, and selenium prevented recurrence. In another situation, different horses developed alopecia in the spring or early summer with resolution in fall or early winter. Lesions were limited to the skin of the face. Two additional situations of excessive hair loss have been reported in association with spring shedding in horses with straight hair coats and some horses with curly hair coats. In horses with straight hair coats, lesions developed on the face, shoulder, and rump. In curly-haired horses the trunk and sometimes the mane and tail areas are affected.

It occurs most commonly in dogs and less commonly in horses and cats. Most experimental work has been performed in cocker spaniels. The pathogenesis of the disease involves hyperproliferation of the epidermis, hair follicle infundibulum, and sebaceous glands. The basal cell labeling indices are three or four times higher in cocker spaniels with seborrhea than in normal dogs. The hyperproliferation results in reduction in the epidermal turnover time to approximately one-third (e.g., from 22 days to 8 days in the cocker spaniel). In the cocker spaniel the disorder appears to be the result of a primary cellular defect in the keratinocyte, because the epidermal cells remain hyperproliferative when grown in culture and after being grafted onto the dermis of normal dogs. However, the molecular basis of the defect has not been studied. In seborrhea, quantitative studies on sebum production have not been performed, but it is known that there is a relative increase in free fatty acids and a relative decrease in diester waxes on the surface of the seborrheic skin of various breeds. In addition, there is a change from nonpathogenic resident bacteria to pathogenic, coagulase-positive staphylococci. Clinically, two forms of seborrhea have been described, a dry form (seborrhea sicca), with dry skin and white-to-gray scales that exfoliate (see Fig. 17-9) , and a greasy form (seborrhea oleosa), with scaling and excessive brown to yellow lipids that adhere to the surface of the skin and hair. An animal can have seborrhea sicca in some areas of the body and seborrhea oleosa in others. Microscopic lesions include marked hyperkeratosis of the epidermis and follicular infundibulum. The epidermis has a papillary appearance caused by widening of follicular ostia by the follicular hyperkeratosis (see Fig. 17-9) . Comedones (follicles dilated with a plug of follicular stratum corneum and sebum) are present in some animals. At the edges of follicular ostia, foci of parakeratosis form over a spongiotic epidermis containing a few scattered leukocytes. The superficial dermis is congested and edematous.",

The molecular basis of canine ichthyosis rarely has been investigated; however, recently transglutaminase 1-deficient recessive lamellar ichthyosis, an autosomal recessive inherited disorder in Jack Russell terrier dogs, has been described. The disease is nonepidermolytic and resembles lamellar ichthyosis in human beings, which is associated with defects in the cornified cell envelope and is caused by mutations in the transglutaminase 1 gene. Transglutaminases catalyze cross-linking of proteins that form the cornified envelope. Clinical lesions in Jack Russell terriers include generalized adherent and loosely attached scales, as well as large, adherent white or tan scales in sparsely haired skin (Fig. 17-58) . Pawpads are moderately hyperkeratotic, and claws are soft. Secondary infection with coccoid bacteria and yeast are common, likely the result of the epidermal barrier defect. Histologic lesions consist of laminated to compact hyperkeratosis of the epidermis and follicular infundibulum without epidermolysis. Secondary infections result in inflammation. Ultrastructurally, many layers of corneocytes are present. Corneocytes have irregular margins and linear or oval lamellar inclusions and in comparison to control animals, thin or less prominent cornified envelopes.",

            "text": "Perhaps the most common form of nonepidermolytic hyperkeratosis in dogs occurs in young, otherwise healthy golden retrievers. The mode of inheritance is autosomal recessive, and the genetic defect is due to a mutation in the PNPLA1 gene. The protein encoded by this gene belongs to the patatin-like phospholipase (PNPLA) family, and is important in lipid metabolism. A genetic test is available that can detect carriers (heterozygous for the mutation) as well as affected dogs (homozygous for the mutation). PNPLA1 is important in formation of the epidermal lipid barrier. Clinical lesions vary in severity and consist of large flat scales on the surface of the skin and within the hair coat. Pawpads and nasal planum are not affected. Histologic lesions consist of mild to Ichthyosis. The ichthyoses are a heterogeneous group of inherited skin disorders seen principally in cattle and dogs (see E-Box 17-2). In severe forms of ichthyosis the skin is thickened by marked scaling and can crack into plates resembling fish scales; thus the disease is named \"ichthys\" from the Greek word meaning fish. Recently advances in molecular diagnosis have improved the understanding of the defects in some of these disorders. In human beings, most of the ichthyoses are associated with defects in the epidermal barrier, including the intercellular lipid layers, cornified envelope, and keratin proteins. These defects result in increased production of stratum corneum (scaling) characteristic of the disease and can result in an increased prevalence of secondary infections. Recently, molecular defects similar to those in the human ichthyoses have been identified as a cause of some forms of ichthyoses in cattle and dogs.",

One (ichthyosis fetalis) is lethal, and most calves are stillborn or die within days of birth. Ichthyosis fetalis markedly resembles harlequin ichthyosis in human infants. Defects in a gene (ABCA12, a member of the adenosine triphosphate [ATP]-binding cassette family) have been identified as a cause of harlequin ichthyosis. The ABCA12 gene is involved in the production of a protein necessary for lipid transfer in lamellar granules, a process required for formation of intercellular lipid layers and epidermal barrier structure and function. Because of barrier dysfunction, infants with harlequin ichthyosis develop excessive loss of fluids (dehydration) and life-threatening infections in the first few weeks of life. A loss of functional ABCA12 protein disrupts the normal development of the epidermis, resulting in the hard, thick scales characteristic of harlequin ichthyosis. Recently a mutation in ABCA12 has been identified in Chianina cattle, one of the breeds of cattle known to develop ichthyosis fetalis, confirming the similarity of the genetic defect for the disease in cattle and human beings. Grossly, thick cornified plaques separated by fissures cover the skin in affected calves. Fissuring of the skin can lead to exudation of protein and secondary bacterial and fungal infections that often lead to death or euthanasia. The ears may be small, and there may be eversion of the eyelids, lips, and other mucocutaneous junctional areas.

            "text": "Sebaceous Adenitis. Sebaceous adenitis, inflammation of sebaceous glands, occurs most commonly in dogs, rarely is seen in cats, and has been reported in one horse. Two basic types of clinical appearances of sebaceous adenitis have been reported in the dog and include the type seen in long-coated breeds and the type seen in short-coated breeds, but due to the distinctly different clinical presentation of lesions in the short-haired breeds of dogs, it has been suggested that sebaceous adenitis in these breeds is a separate entity. More commonly affected long-haired breeds include the standard poodle, Akita, English springer spaniel, Havanese, German shepherd, and Samoyed, but many other breeds may be affected. More commonly affected short-haired breeds include the vizsla, miniature pinscher, beagle, and dachshund. The cause and pathogenesis are uncertain, but an inherited component of the disease is proposed for the standard poodle and Akita. Immunohistologic studies have shown a predominance of antigen-presenting dendritic cells and T lymphocytes in areas of sebaceous gland inflammation, suggesting a cell-mediated immunopathogenesis. Clinical lesion severity and location vary between breeds of dogs, but in long-haired breeds, scaling with formation of fronds of keratin adherent to hair shafts (follicular casts) and a progressively poor, dry, brittle hair coat are consistently present. Hair loss often begins in more cranial and dorsal regions, but the tail may be severely affected in some cases. The hair coat may become lighter or darker, and in poodles hairs that develop after disease onset are wavy or straight rather than tightly curled (see Fig. 17 -30). Secondary bacterial folliculitis and otitis externa commonly develop. In the short-haired breeds of dogs, clinical lesions develop on the trunk and occasionally face and consist of focal, firm plaques and nodules with alopecia and adherent scale that may expand and coalesce. Hair casts may be present, but secondary bacterial folliculitis is rare. In some instances edematous swellings of the face or severe pinnal ulceration may develop, which are not a feature of the disease in long-haired breeds and suggest the short-haired form of sebaceous adenitis is a different entity. Cats have multifocal, circular areas of hair loss, scaling, crusting, and follicular keratin casts that begin on the head, pinnae, and neck and spread caudally. Progressive patches of nonpruritic scaling, crusting, alopecia, and leukoderma are reported in the horse. The reason scaling and alopecia develop in association with loss of sebaceous glands is speculative. Microscopic lesions include lymphocytes, neutrophils, and macrophages that efface sebaceous glands and sometimes form microscopic granulomas (see Fig. 17-30) , and in some dogs, extensive orthokeratotic hyperkeratosis. Chronically affected dogs have no remaining sebaceous glands, but mild residual inflammation and fibrosis are present in the perifollicular dermis near the isthmus (site normally occupied by sebaceous glands). Sebaceous gland inflammation or loss can occur in other conditions such as folliculitis, demodicosis, uveodermatologic syndrome, or leishmaniasis, in which the inflammation primarily targets other areas of the moderate compact orthokeratotic hyperkeratosis without epidermal acanthosis, epidermolysis, or dermal inflammation. Ultrastructurally, affected dogs have more cohesive corneocytes and more numerous corneodesmosomes, suggesting that the disorder may be caused by delayed degradation of corneodesmosomes.",

Melanin is synthesized by melanocytes, which are dendritic cells originating as melanoblasts in the neural crest. Melanoblasts develop in the neural crest and migrate to peripheral sites, including the basal and lower spinous layers of the epidermis, hair follicles, and dermis. Melanoblasts differentiate into melanocytes and synthesize melanosomes and melanin. Tyrosinase, a coppercontaining enzyme, plays a critical role in the synthesis of melanin. Genetic mutations affecting any of the steps in the formation of melanin can lead to hereditary hypopigmentation.

They can result from a decrease in melanin (hypomelanosis), a complete absence of melanin (amelanosis), or from a loss of existing melanin (depigmentation). These events result either from an absence of the pigment-synthesizing melanocytes or from a failure of melanocytes to produce normal amounts of melanin or to transfer it to adjacent keratinocytes.

In general the severity of the injury determines whether an insult will result in hypopigmentation or hyperpigmentation. Mild injury results in pigmentary incontinence and epidermal hypopigmentation from death of melanin-containing keratinocytes. However, hyperpigmentation can occur, possibly from release of melanocytestimulating factors from surviving keratinocytes and subsequent increase in production of melanosomes. It is thought that these factors are present in normal epidermis, but their level or activity is increased in response to stimulation or keratinocyte stress. In contrast, severe injury results in the death of melanocytes, which do not regenerate, and thus there is no repigmentation.",

However, newer techniques, including PCR that detects minute amounts of DNA, suggest the potential for microbial participation in the pathogenesis of some of these seemingly sterile inflammatory disorders, especially in human beings. It is possible, for instance, for an abnormal immune response to an as yet unidentified microbial antigen to initiate a macrophage-dominated inflammatory response. Defective downregulation of the immune response to the organism could lead to a persistent granulomatous inflammatory process. Currently this issue remains unresolved, but as more of these lesions are probed for microbial agents, a better understanding of these so-called sterile inflammatory disorders will hopefully develop.

The tinctorial change can develop in any lesion with large numbers of eosinophils such as reactions to parasites, foreign bodies (including hair), or in mast cell tumors and in some cases of cutaneous lymphoma. Eosinophils congregate and degranulate near collagen bundles, causing the tinctorial change. Eosinophil degranulation results in release of a wide range of toxic granule proteins (e.g., major basic protein), enzymes (peroxidase, collagenase), cytokines (IL-3, IL-5, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor [GM-CSF]), chemokines (IL-8), and lipid mediators (leukotrienes and platelet-activating factor) augmenting an inflammatory response.

History includes pain manifested as lameness and sudden loss of one or more claws on multiple paws, eventually involving all claws on all paws.

Diagnosis can require amputation of the distal phalanx and the adjacent skin proximal to the claw fold for histopathologic evaluation.

The enzymatic theory suggests that enzymes such as matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) (especially MMP-2 and MMP-9) located in neutrophils and other tissues, including epidermis, may play a role because these enzymes have been shown to contribute to the separation of the lamellar epidermal cells from the basement membrane; however, new evidence indicates that these enzymes are either present in the inactive form or become activated hours after basement membrane degradation, so MMP-2 and MMP-9 may not be as important as originally thought. The role of other enzymes, including other MMPs and proteins, including proteoglycans, is under investigation. The inflammatory theory suggests that in the early stages of laminitis local digital cytokine (IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, and IL-8) and adhesion molecule (intercellular adhesion molecule 1 and E-selectin) gene expression is associated with infiltration of leukocytes into lamellar tissue, and the leukocytes create inflammation and tissue damage.",

This form of laminitis is often associated with a slow onset of disease, is recurrent and difficult to treat, and research suggests that it is associated with repeated episodes of subclinical laminitis that occur before onset of clinically recognizable pain. Horses and ponies with metabolic/ endocrinopathic abnormalities are at increased risk for developing laminitis, and hyperinsulinemia appears to play a key role. The reasons for this are unclear, but it has been shown that laminitis can be induced in healthy ponies by maintaining superphysiologic circulating concentrations of insulin. Thus it has been hypothesized gross lesions include circumferential hoof rings (ridges, founder rings, divergent hoof rings) that are wider at the heel (see Fig. 17-63,  A) , altered foot shape, separation of the wall from the epidermis at the coronet, depression of the coronary band, a flattened sole, and in some cases, penetration of the distal phalanx through the sole. In horses, laminitis may affect one or more feet, but the front feet are most commonly affected, presumably due to increased weight bearing (in the standing horse, the body mass is divided between fore and hind limbs in an approximate ratio of 60 : 40). Gross evaluation of the external foot in horses or ponies at risk for the development of laminitis is considered an important strategy in prevention of some cases of laminitis, particularly the endocrinopathic form. For instance, the presence of divergent hoof rings (see Fig. 17-63 , A) in a horse or pony before the onset of clinically recognizable foot pain, suggests the presence of subclinical lamellar injury, which may allow for earlier implementation of management strategies to slow or prevent further lamellar injury.",

In addition, leukocytes are present in the developmental stage of the black walnut extract model and in the acute stage of the carbohydrate models and precede significant histologic changes, which suggests that leukocyte infiltration occurs early and may be a cause of basement membrane separation and structural failure of the foot (see Fig. 17-61 , B and C for an example of histologic lesions in acute laminitis). Histologic lesions 7 days after induction of laminitis in the carbohydrate overload model include significant alterations in the lamellar architecture. Lamellar basal cells that survive acute injury reconstruct basement membrane but are enclosed by it before they are able to reattach to the primary epidermal lamellae. This results in secondary epidermal lamellae that are irregularly sized and shaped and often separated from the primary epidermal lamellae. These changes reduce the surface area of dermal-epidermal interdigitations and weaken the suspensory apparatus of the distal phalanx. In addition, the primary epidermal lamellae elongate. In some instances, columns of abnormally cornified epidermal cells may surround the primary dermal lamellae in the region closest to the hoof wall. With time these mounds of abnormal stratum corneum enlarge, which reduces the structural integrity of the foot and thus complicates recovery. Histologic lesions in chronic naturally occurring endocrinopathic laminitis with hyperinsulinemia occur predominantly in lamellar regions closest to the hoof wall and include epidermal hyperplasia and apoptosis, and fusion and partial replacement of lamellar tissue by increased quantities of abnormal stratum corneum that may contain nuclear debris and pools of proteinaceous fluid.

Histologically the lamellar wedge consists of variable quantities of proliferative epidermis, abnormal stratum corneum, and sometimes resolving fluid accumulation and hemorrhage.

Descriptions include four different stages of laminitis: acute, subacute, chronic, and subclinical. Acute laminitis is not common and is associated with diseases such as metritis, mastitis, or accidental consumption of large quantities of grain and is often an individual animal problem. Subacute laminitis occurs in beef bulls on feeding trials and feeder calves fed diets rich in carbohydrates. Thus acute and subacute laminitis are likely associated with systemic disease, including carbohydrate-induced gastrointestinal disease (ruminal acidosis), and subsequent release into the systemic circulation of inflammatory mediators that may affect the lamellae. A model of acute bovine laminitis confirms the association between dietary carbohydrate (oligofructose) overload and development of laminitis. Acute and subacute laminitis are associated with digital pain, and the claws may be warm with marked digital pulse. The histopathologic features of the more acute forms of laminitis in cattle have been studied using a carbohydrate overload model, in which it has been shown that early lesions are stretching of lamellae, dermal edema, hemorrhage, and basal cell morphologic changes, with white blood cells in the dermis and basement membrane detachment.",

For example, it has been shown in dairy cattle that diets with a large proportion of rapidly fermentable carbohydrates and insufficient quantity and quality of fiber increase the prevalence of laminitis, possibly by influencing rumen metabolism that allows toxins or inflammatory mediators to enter the systemic circulation. Dairy cows housed on hard (concrete) flooring as opposed to rubber mats and cows that are unable to lie down and rest sufficiently have a higher prevalence of laminitis, possibly due to increased hoof trauma. In addition, the suspensory apparatus of cattle is less well developed than that of the horse, so the digital cushion (a structure consisting of adipose tissue under the distal phalanx) supports a greater amount of the body weight. Dairy cattle with a thinner digital cushion have a greater prevalence of lameness and conditions traditionally associated with subclinical laminitis such as ulcers of the sole, suggesting that these lesions are related to contusions within the hoof. Thus the pathogenesis of lesions in subclinical laminitis is multifactorial and may vary in individual animals depending on the degree of or type of contribution of the various nutritional, hormonal, mechanical, and genetic factors. Clinical lesions in affected dairy cattle before the onset of lameness include hemorrhage in the sole and white line (see the section on Structure, Specialized Structures), and yellow discoloration and softening of the sole horn. These lesions in dairy cows are thought to predispose to other foot conditions such as ulceration of the sole, white line separation and fissuring, and subsolar abscesses that can be the main causes of lameness in this form of laminitis in dairy cattle. If damage in the hoof in acute, subacute, or subclinical laminitis is subtotal, partial recovery may occur, but damaged lamellae, and possibly adjacent support structures, are less able to recover during repeat episodes of laminitis, and thus chronic laminitis may ensue. Chronic laminitis is associated with deformation of the claws, which become flattened and broad, with a concave and furrowed dorsal wall due to disruption and loss of integrity of the lamellae and displacement of the distal phalanx.",

Four categories of genes encode for a large number of proteins responsible for regulation of cellular proliferation and differentiation.

Damage to these genes results in gain-or loss-offunction defects in proteins such as growth factors, growth factor receptors, signal-transducing proteins, cell cycle regulators, and nuclear transcription factors. The majority of malignant neoplasms have evidence of damage (mutation) of multiple genes within these categories. Mutations are often accumulated by cells in a stepwise manner that imparts increasing degrees of malignant potential. These molecular changes are known to correlate with morphologic changes and the clinical behavior of some neoplasms. For example, it is known that squamous cell carcinomas often develop in a stepwise manner and progress through several recognizable stages: hyperplasia (increased number of cells; no cellular atypia or tissue disorganization) \u2192 dysplasia (increased mitoses, cellular atypia, and tissue disorganization consisting of loss of polarity) \u2192 carcinoma in situ (increased tissue disorganization, mitoses, anaplastic nuclei, but no invasion of underlying basement membrane) \u2192 invasive squamous cell carcinoma (disruption of the basement membrane with dermal invasion by anaplastic carcinoma cells).",

This series of changes takes place over long periods of time, often years, before a tumor reaches full malignant potential. Many of the genetic mutations are neutral (or passenger) mutations; however, others are considered to be \"driver\" mutations because they guide and sustain the selection and propagation of a malignant clone (malignant cells that arise from an individual parent cell with the genetic mutations). Under the influence of the driver mutations, clonal populations of malignant cells gain selection advantage over other cells and also gain control of various interactions with the tumor microenvironment, an essential part of tumor physiology, structure, and function that includes many nontumor cells and components such as endothelial cells, mesenchymal cells, immune cells, inflammatory cells, and extracellular matrix. The complex interactions of tumor cells and their adjacent microenvironment contribute to tumor growth and metastasis and are currently being investigated in an attempt to identify more effective anticancer therapies.",

The cause of proliferative pododermatitis in the horse is unknown, but the disease appears to be polymicrobial in nature. The condition has been associated with the presence of a variety of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria and in some cases with tissue colonization of Treponema spp. spirochetes. Bacteroides sp. and Fusobacterium necrophorum have been isolated in some cases. Recently, bovine papillomaviruses 1 and 2 have been detected in affected tissue via PCR-based techniques, but it is not known if these viruses have a causative role. The pathogenesis of lesion formation is not yet known, but moisture and unclean environments often predispose to the condition. It most often affects the rear feet of draft horses but can affect any foot or multiple feet of any breed of horse and even those kept in dry, clean environments. Initial lesions consist of a focal raised pink lesion resembling granulation tissue that bleeds easily and is surrounded by a gray or brown zone located in the frog. This lesion will progress to excessive, soft, white filiform papillomatous-like proliferations emanating from the frog, bars, sole, and sometimes hoof wall of the affected foot. Some cases will be foul smelling and have surface collections of caseous white exudate. Microscopically, areas of marked papillary epidermal hyperplasia associated with hyperkeratosis and neutrophilic infiltrates of the epidermis are present. The outer stratum spinosum may have areas of marked ballooning degeneration. The dermis contains superficial neutrophilic to lymphoplasmacytic infiltrates. A mixed population of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria can be identified on the surface epidermis, but the organisms are not consistently associated with the areas of inflammation.

Commencing as multiple, circular, smooth-surfaced, gray-white papules 1 to 2 mm in diameter, the lesions become umbilicated and develop a central pore from which a caseous plug is extruded. The microscopic lesions of molluscum contagiosum consist of well-demarcated foci of epidermal hyperplasia and hypertrophy that form invaginated lobules of the epidermis in the superficial dermis. Keratinocytes containing inclusions exfoliate through a pore that forms in the stratum corneum and enlarges into a central crater.

The inflammatory stimulus is thought to be induced by proinflammatory and chemotactic cytokines and depends on PRRs known to contribute to innate immunity.

O. ochengi in cattle has been studied as a model of human onchocerciasis in which it has been shown that selective antibiotic therapy against Wolbachia results in reduced numbers of Wolbachia sp., reduced numbers of adult O. ochengi, and reduced numbers of microfilaria.

The clinical signs in horses with pars intermedia pituitary tumors (polyphagia, polydipsia, polyuria, increased sweating, and an excessively long and thick hair coat) are largely mediated through dysfunction of the hypothalamus or neurohypophysis caused by an underlying expanding pituitary tumor. The long hair coat, also called hypertrichosis or hirsutism, is the result of failure to seasonally shed; cyclic shedding is mediated through the hypothalamus. Some tumors of the pars intermedia are functional and result in production of pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC), which is processed into high concentrations of various pars intermedia-derived peptides, including corticotropin-like intermediate lobe peptide, melanocyte-stimulating hormone, and \u03b2-endorphin, and much smaller concentrations of adrenocorticotropin. The combination of hypothalamic dysfunction and differential expression of pars intermedia-derived peptides over that of adrenocorticotropin results in a unique syndrome of hyperpituitarism in horses that differs from functional pituitary tumors in dogs and cats, which usually are associated with high concentrations of adrenocorticotropin. Some horses with large pituitary tumors also develop insulin-resistant hyperglycemia, which may be the result of downregulation of insulin receptors secondary to chronic polyphagia and hyperinsulinemia.

It has been speculated that reduction in number of the later developing secondary fibers could be the result of impaired nutrition because of placentitis. Microscopically, primary follicles and hairs are enlarged, and the number of the secondary follicles and wool fibers is reduced (see the discussion on hair follicles in the section on Structure and also Fig. 17-6 ). Diagnosis can be confirmed in affected lambs by histopathologic evaluation of the CNS with immunohistochemical staining for the virus, by viral isolation using precolostral serum or buffy coat, by viral antigen detection ELISA using ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) or heparinized blood, and by reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR) of clinical specimens.",

There may be a genetic predisposition, which includes a long hair coat on the pastern area as often occurs in draft horses. Other predisposing factors are numerous and include excessive moisture, trauma, and contact dermatitis. Also, many other conditions affect the pastern skin in horses, including immune-mediated diseases (pemphigus foliaceus, vasculitis, or photosensitization), other infections (dermatophilosis, dermatophytosis), chronic progressive lymphedema of draft horses, and mite infestation (Chorioptes sp.). Equine pastern dermatitis occurs in male or female adult horses of a variety of breeds, is usually bilateral, and most commonly affects the caudal aspect of the hind legs, but lesions may progress to involve the cranial aspect of the legs, and front legs may also be affected. Early clinical lesions include edema, erythema, and scaling, which rapidly progress to exudation, matting of hair, and crusting. Ulcers may be present. Chronic lesions are thickened and fissured skin, are often painful, and may result in lameness. Diagnosis is facilitated by obtaining a complete history and performing thorough physical, dermatologic, microbiologic, and histopathologic evaluations early in the course of disease. Histopathologic lesions vary with stage of disease and severity, and histopathologic evaluation is most helpful in ruling out other conditions that affect pastern skin.

Sheeppox and goatpox are present in Africa, Asia, the Middle East, and most of the Indian subcontinent, where, despite attempts at vaccination, capripoxvirus is responsible for cycles of epidemic disease followed by periods of endemic maintenance with low morbidity. The disease is exotic to the Americas, Australia, and New Zealand. Although eradication measures eliminated the disease from Britain in the mid-nineteenth century, these measures have only recently been successful in eastern European countries. The diseases capripoxviruses cause lead to constraints on international trade of livestock and related products and can prevent the importation of new breeds of sheep or goats into endemic areas because fatality rates can be very high in nonindigenous breeds. Capripoxviruses are highly contagious and spread by the respiratory tract in times of close contact and mechanically by insect vectors and fomites. Virus is shed in saliva, conjunctival secretions, milk, urine, and feces, as well as in skin lesions and scabs. Vaccination of susceptible animals for sheeppox and goatpox provides lifelong immunity.

Contagious ecthyma (contagious pustular dermatitis, orf, sore mouth) is a common localized cutaneous infection of young sheep and goats caused by a parapoxvirus with worldwide distribution. Less commonly, human beings, cattle, wild ungulates, and dogs are infected. Morbidity in lambs is usually high, and although mortality is usually low, it can approach 15% in lambs. Lesions are initiated by abrasions; however, recent work has shown that active virus infection relies on proliferating keratinocytes that are in response to the cutaneous injury as opposed to the cutaneous injury itself. Cutaneous abrasions are typically acquired from pasture grasses or forage; begin at the commissures of the mouth and spread to the lips (Fig. 17-66) , oral mucosa, eyelids, and feet; and are susceptible to secondary bacterial infection. In contrast to other poxviruses, the orf virus infection is typically limited to the skin and does not have a systemic phase to the infection, which may explain why an antibody response is not particularly important or effective for immunity to infection. This contrasts to many other poxvirus infections, which also gain entrance through skin, but their spread to other organs can occur and be partly controlled by antibody response. The orf virus may persist for long periods of time in the environment from infected material such as shed scabs, which is important because past natural infection does not confer immunity to reinfection. Unlike other poxviruses for which attenuated vaccines can be used to protect against infection, protection against contagious ecthyma is best provided by use of fully virulent vaccines, which may result in outbreaks of disease caused by the vaccine. Lambs can transfer the virus to the teats of ewes, and the lesions can spread to the skin of the udder. Contagious ecthyma is economically important as the result of weight loss in lambs that are reluctant to eat because of the pain associated with oral and perioral lesions. Pathogenesis of lesion formation and gross and microscopic features are consistent with the typical cutaneous poxvirus lesions (see previous discussion and see Fig. 17-32) , except that the vesicle stage is very brief, the ulcer and crust stage persists and is clinically prominent, and the epidermis is markedly hyperplastic.

Papillomatous digital dermatitis most commonly affects the skin proximal and adjacent to the interdigital space at the caudal (plantar) aspect of the hind feet. Early gross lesions are well-circumscribed, round to oval, red plaques up to 6 cm in diameter with a moist granular surface prone to bleeding and with a very strong, pungent odor. Lesions are partially to completely alopecic and can be bordered by hypertrophied hairs two to three times longer than normal. Early microscopic lesions are largely limited to the epidermis, with minimal dermal involvement mostly consisting of minimal perivascular inflammation. Epidermal lesions consist of hyperplasia with foci of erosion, necrosis, ballooning degeneration, and microabscesses. Mixed bacteria can be present in the outer necrotic debris, but only spirochetes are present in the deeper viable epidermis.

Mature lesions are irregular wartlike growths or filamentous papillae that measure 0.5 to 1.0 mm in diameter and 1 mm to 3 cm in length and are pale yellow, gray, or brown. Histologically the older lesions are composed of frondlike projections or plaques of markedly hyperplastic epidermis with parakeratosis and hyperkeratosis. Foci of necrosis and hemorrhage, ballooning degeneration, and aggregates of neutrophils are scattered throughout the hyperplastic epidermis ( Fig. 17-67) . At this later stage, inflammation is more intense in the dermis, and plasma cells can be numerous. Lesions are painful, forcing the animal to shift its weight to the toe of the affected foot, which results in a smooth contour to the toe (clubbing) and atrophy of the bulbs of the heels.",

Predisposing factors include interdigital trauma in combination with increased moisture, heat, and poor housing conditions that allow contact with manure and urine. F. necrophorum and P. melaninogenica are rumen microbes, are passed through the gastrointestinal tract, and thus readily contaminate the environment. F. necrophorum produces an exotoxin (leukotoxin) that causes necrosis and damages leukocytes. The infection usually involves both digits of a single foot in adult cattle, but several feet may be involved in calves. The disease progresses rapidly and is associated with a malodor. Early lesions are swelling and erythema of the soft tissues of the interdigital space and coronary band. The leukotoxin causes necrosis and exudation, which can progress to cellulitis that may extend into the deeper structures of the foot such as the distal phalanx, distal sesamoid bone, distal interphalangeal joint, and tendons. Extensive Contagious ovine digital dermatitis (CODD) (see Table 17 -12) is a severe infection of the ovine hoof reported in the United Kingdom, with initial reports occurring in 1997. The disease has spread widely in the sheep population and is of major animal welfare concern. It most commonly affects one foot, but multiple digits may be affected, and 80% of affected sheep are lame. The cause of this form of digital dermatitis in sheep is not yet completely defined but thought to be polymicrobial, with spirochetes belonging to the genus Treponema, including Treponema sp. phylogenetically identical to those associated with bovine digital dermatitis, frequently isolated from affected sheep. D. nodosus and F. necrophorum have also been isolated from affected sheep, but their role in the pathogenesis of the disease is uncertain. The condition differs from typical contagious foot rot in sheep in that the lesions have an acute onset, are more severe, and are characterized by ulcerative lesions of the coronary band and hoof wall in some cases (contagious foot rot lesions affect the heel and interdigital region). Select systemic antibiotic therapy improves likelihood of recovery and reduces the rate of new infection development. The pathogenesis of lesion formation is not yet known. Early gross lesions consist of ulcers at the coronary band and progress to loosening, and possible shedding, of the hoof wall or capsule. Interdigital lesions are not reported. Microscopic lesions have not been described.",

            "text": "Contagious foot rot in sheep (see Table 17 -12) is a serious, economically important disease occurring in most sheep-producing countries. The infection is caused by the Gram-negative anaerobe D. nodosus. Depending on climatic and host factors, and the virulence of the bacterial strain, lesions vary from mild interdigital dermatitis (benign foot rot) to severe separation of the horn of the hoof (virulent foot rot). The major virulence factors of D. nodosus are type IV fimbria (short fine appendages surrounding the bacterial cell that allow colonization of epidermis) and extracellular proteases that degrade tissue. The virulent form is caused by more virulent D. nodosus that produces significantly more proteolytic enzymes (proteases including elastase), allowing more bacterial penetration of the epidermis. The proteases in the virulent form also tend to be more heat stable. Virulent foot rot is more persistent (and can last for more than 1 year if not treated), affects a high percentage of sheep, affects more than one foot, and can result in death of sheep because of emaciation as a result of severe pain and reluctance to graze. Early lesions of virulent foot rot begin in the interdigital axial (inner) region, affect both digits, and consist of red, moist, and swollen eroded skin. The infection spreads to the epidermal matrix of the hoof and results in a malodorous exudate that separates the horn from the interdigital skin. Lesions progress to the bulb (heel) and sole, and finally to the abaxial (outer) surfaces of the hoof wall. The germinal epidermis is not destroyed, and although regeneration is attempted, the new horn is destroyed. In chronic infections, hooves can become long and misshapen. Benign foot rot in sheep is mild, confined to interdigital skin, and can have slight separation of the horn of the heel. The hoof can overgrow. Diagnosis of foot rot in sheep is often made by clinical evaluation of the flock and lesion severity and examination of smears or cultures for D. nodosus. However, culture and typing, as for other fastidious anaerobes, is difficult and laborious, is not widely offered in diagnostic laboratories, and culture alone may not distinguish between virulent and nonvirulent strains. More recently PCR testing has been developed that detects and differentiates virulent and nonvirulent strains of D. nodosus.",

Lesions begin as erythematous papules on the ventral abdomen and medial aspect of the thighs and possibly the sides and back. The papules enlarge peripherally to form plaques with a depressed center filled with gray to brown-black granular brittle material. Each crusty plaque is sharply demarcated from normal skin by a hyperemic raised border. As lesions spread peripherally, they coalesce to form extensive horny, papilloma-like areas covered by black crusts. Hoof lesions, if they occur, are always present at birth. Usually all digits, including accessory digits, on more than one limb are affected. The coronary region is markedly swollen and erythematous, and a yellow-brown greasy material covers the skin.

The cause of excess hyaluronan in Shar-Pei dogs is thought to be the result of overactivation of the hyaluronan synthase 2 (HAS2) gene. Shar-Pei dogs have increased serum hyaluronic acid concentrations, which may occur as a result of drainage of hyaluronic acid into dermal lymphatic vessels, and subsequently into the blood. Histologically, dermal mucin is an amphophilic amorphous material that separates dermal collagen fibers, sometimes forming lakes of material.

It is usually caused by bilateral adrenal cortical hyperplasia secondary to a functional pituitary neoplasm, and less often by a functional adrenal cortical neoplasm or a functional nodule of cortical hyperplasia. Particularly in dogs, the administration of exogenous glucocorticoids is also a cause. Rarely, accidental topical contact with glucocorticoids used on the skin of human beings may cause lesions, particularly in small dogs. In dogs, cutaneous lesions include endocrine alopecia that generally spares the head and extremities, thinning of the skin, comedones, increased bruising, poor wound healing, and increased susceptibility to infection ( Fig. 17-75) .

In cats affected with hyperadrenocorticism, calcinosis cutis typically does not develop; however, the dermal collagen fibers can be markedly thin and atrophic, resulting in extremely fragile skin that can tear with normal handling. Microscopically, the lesions of hyperadrenocorticism include epidermal, dermal, and follicular atrophy (see Fig.  17 -75) and follicular hyperkeratosis with the formation of comedones. Hair follicles are either in the telogen stage of the hair cycle or more commonly, have lost their hair shafts (kenogen). Calcinosis cutis may develop in affected dogs (see Fig. 17-76) , and foreign body reaction (granulomatous inflammation) and draining sinuses can develop in association with the calcium deposits. In cats the atrophic hair follicles often have brightly eosinophilic trichilemmal cornification, a feature associated with prolonged telogen and in the cat, considered highly suggestive of hyperadrenocorticism.",

The condition usually occurs in long-haired or heavily coated (plush-coated) breeds of dogs such as the Chow Chow. The pathogenesis of this condition is undetermined, but because hair regrowth may take a year or more, an arrest in the hair cycle is suspected. Alternatively, it is possible that heavily coated breeds of dogs have a prolonged telogen stage of the hair cycle, possibly to conserve energy by avoiding frequent cycles of shedding. Thus clipping when the hair coat is in a prolonged inactive stage of the hair cycle would result in lack of quick regrowth of the hair coat. The hair coat may not regrow until there is another significant growth phase, which may take 6 to 12 months. Most affected dogs regrow the hair coat after they go through a cycle of heavy shedding. Histologic lesions consist of normal epidermis, dermis, and sebaceous glands, and hair follicles in the telogen stage of the hair cycle with retained hair shafts.

It is usually diagnosed clinically by examination of pulled hairs, so scalp biopsy sampling is rarely performed. It is the result of an injury that interrupts the mitotic activity of the hair matrix cells in the hair bulb that have the greatest proliferative activity compared to other hair follicle cells. The abrupt cessation of mitotic activity is thought to lead to weakening of the developing anagen hair shaft nearest the hair bulb, which subsequently breaks at its narrowest or weakest point within the hair canal. The consequence of anagen effluvium is hair shedding that usually begins within a week or two after initiation of chemotherapy and is complete by 1 to 2 months after therapy. Because approximately 90% of human scalp hair is in the anagen phase, the hair loss is usually significant and alopecia obvious. Diagnosis can be made early in the course of hair loss by gently pulling out the damaged anagen hairs, which have irregularly narrowed or pointed ends that may contain melanin pigment when examined microscopically. Diagnosis can also be made late in the course of hair loss after anagen hairs have been lost. Because telogen hair follicles are immune to this injury, they remain intact. Thus microscopic examination of hairs pulled during the late stage of hair loss reveals a vast majority of telogen hairs, essentially confirming the presence of anagen effluvium (the anagen hairs have been lost). Alopecia related to chemotherapy also occurs in dogs and cats but has not been well studied. In dogs it has been reported most commonly with doxorubicin therapy and occurs in longer-coated breeds such as poodles and old English sheepdogs and also in some terrier breeds. The prolonged anagen hair phase in some of the longerhaired breeds may explain why they are predisposed. The degree of hair loss varies substantially and depends on drug, dose, method of administration, and treatment schedule, as well as individual animal variables (dogs with long versus short anagen hair cycle phases). Hair loss may begin within 7 to 10 days and is usually apparent within 1 to 2 months. The hair loss may be complete or partial (generalized thinning of the hair coat or loss of primary versus secondary hairs) and can affect different regions of the body (head and site of intravenous injection of the drug; skin of ventral trunk and medial legs; somewhat symmetric involvement of facial skin).

The lesions develop most commonly on the palmar and lateral interdigital webs of the front paws, where most weight bearing occurs. The pathogenesis is thought to result from external surface trauma to the palmar/plantar aspect of the haired interdigital skin, which causes follicular plugging and retention of follicular contents. Because canine hair follicles are mostly compound (see Fig. 17-6) , 15 or more secondary follicles can exit one common follicular opening, so narrowing or plugging of one follicular opening can result in the formation of multiple comedones or follicular cysts. The cystically dilated follicles can rupture and cause an inflammatory response to the material released from the contribute. Lesions generally begin between 6 and 10 weeks of age. Most affected dogs are dead by 15 months of age, usually because of bronchopneumonia. The thymus is small or absent, and T lymphocytes are deficient in lymphoid tissues, likely contributing to immunodeficiency and increasing the potential of infection. Cutaneous lesions begin between the digits and on pawpads and progress to involve mucocutaneous areas, especially of the face. Severe interdigital pyoderma, paronychia (inflammation of the skin around the claws), and villous thickening and fissuring of pawpad keratin ensue. Exfoliative dermatitis can also develop on pinnae, external nose, elbows, and hocks and in some dogs, can become more generalized, with crusting, ulceration, and secondary pyoderma. Microscopically, the principal lesions are extensive diffuse parakeratotic hyperkeratosis, responsible for the exfoliative dermatitis, and accompanying acanthosis.

The cutaneous form is much more common than the systemic form, which is rare. Reactive histiocytosis is thought to be the result of immune dysregulation, and to be antigen driven, but cultures and special stains have failed to reveal etiologic agents, and no other antigen has been detected. The disorder typically has a slowly progressive, waxing and waning course but can spontaneously resolve and can respond favorably, at least for a time, to immunomodulatory therapy. The lesions require longterm management and often lead to death, particularly if there is systemic involvement. The cutaneous form consists of single or multifocal, nonpainful plaques or nodules composed predominantly of histiocytic cells that are immunophenotypically identified as activated dermal (interstitial) dendritic antigen-presenting cells that express CD1a, CD4, CD11c/CD18, CD90, MHC class II markers. Also intermixed with the histiocytic cells are T lymphocytes, mostly of the CD8 + type, and neutrophils. The role of the CD8 + lymphocytes is unknown. They may be involved in activation of the dendritic cells via release of cytokines such as GM-CSF and TNF-\u03b1 known to be involved in the proliferation and differentiation of follicles, and a secondary bacterial infection. Exudate from the ruptured follicles can coalesce and form a draining sinus that ruptures on the dorsal surface of the paw, sometimes providing an erroneous opinion that lesions originate dorsally rather than ventrally.

Less commonly, similar lesions have tumor usually within the pancreatic islets. Long-term anticonvulsant therapy and the rare ingestion of mycotoxins also have preceded the development of superficial necrolytic dermatitis. The disorder is rare in cats and has been associated in some instances with pancreatic carcinoma and/or hepatopathy, and in one cat a glucagon-producing primary hepatic neuroendocrine carcinoma. The pathogenesis of superficial necrolytic dermatitis is not completely understood and may vary with the underlying defect. When glucagon level is elevated, persistent gluconeogenesis is thought to result in a negative nitrogen balance with protein degradation, including proteins in the epidermis. However, when glucagon level is not elevated, as occurs in human beings with some types of hepatic or malabsorptive disease and in dogs with diabetes and multinodular vacuolar hepatopathy, it is thought that deficiencies of certain essential fatty acids, zinc, and amino acids play a role. Ultimately, low blood amino acid concentrations are thought to lead to the development of the cutaneous lesions. In dogs these lesions consist of scales, thick adherent crusts, erythema, alopecia, erosions, and ulcers on the mucocutaneous junctions, genitalia, pinnae, skin subjected to trauma (elbows, hocks), and ventral thorax.

Hair follicles can be destroyed, and free keratin in the dermis is associated with eosinophils and foci of eosinophil degranulation bordering collagen fibers and collagen degeneration. Large amphophilic or hyaline intranuclear inclusions are present in the surface and adnexal epithelium. Inclusion bodies are often easily overlooked, variable in number, and sometimes present in small rafts of epithelial cells surrounded by necrotic debris or in crust. The lesions are different from those previously reported in domestic cats in that they persist and many are limited to the skin of the face or oral mucosa and often have significant eosinophilic inflammation. The inflammation in feline herpesvirus dermatitis overlaps with that of the hypersensitivity reactions, including mosquito bite hypersensitivity, and also with that of eosinophilic ulcers, thus warranting close scrutiny of eosinophilic necrotizing cutaneous lesions for intranuclear inclusion bodies or using more sensitive tests such as immunohistochemical staining for feline herpesvirus.",

            "text": "Feline Leprosy. Feline leprosy is usually caused by M. lepraemurium or Mycobacterium visibile, which are considered saprophytic organisms that typically do not grow in culture. Definitive diagnosis can be made by use of PCR and DNA sequencing, but not all laboratories perform these tests. Differential diagnoses include potentially zoonotic tuberculosis infections. Feline leprosy typically develops in cats living in cold, wet areas of the world, including the northwestern United States and Canada. Mode of transmission is not known, but bites of cats or rodents, soil contamination of cutaneous wounds, or possible transmission via biting insect vectors may be involved. Lesions develop most commonly on the head, neck, and limbs but can occur anywhere (Fig. 17-81) . Histologically, two distinct morphologic patterns of inflammation are present. In one there is diffuse granulomatous inflammation without necrosis and with large numbers of intracellular acid-fast bacilli; some of these infections have been caused by M. visibile. In the other pattern there are granulomas with central necrosis surrounded by a zone of lymphocytes. Few to moderate numbers of acid-fast bacilli are generally limited to the areas of necrosis. Some of these infections have been caused by M. lepraemurium. However, it has been suggested that the number of mycobacterial organisms may have more to do with the immune competence of the host than the mycobacterial agent itself, with infections in immunocompetent hosts having fewer mycobacteria than infections in hosts with immune compromise.",

Gross lesions begin as scaling and erythema of the head, neck, and ears and progress to generalized alopecia with scales, crusts, and ulcers. Histologically, the lesions include basal cell hydropic degeneration, lymphocyte exocytosis, and lymphocyte clustering around apoptotic keratinocytes of the epidermis and outer follicular root sheath. Sebaceous glands may be absent. The histologic lesions are similar, but generally milder, than those in the spectrum of erythema multiforme or a graft-versus-host disease reaction. Pruritus is variable but may be severe in some cats. M. pachydermatis is sometimes identified.

The pathogenesis of this condition is not known. The alopecia typically affects the ventral abdomen, thorax, and legs. The ears and periocular skin are less frequently involved. Alopecic skin is smooth, soft, and often has a shiny or glistening appearance. The pawpads are dry with circular rings of scale and may be painful. Histologically, affected skin has small inactive hair follicles with a reduction or absence of the stratum corneum. Some cats groom excessively, and it has been suggested that the smooth shiny appearance of the skin is caused by the absence of the stratum corneum. In other areas of the skin, there is variable orthokeratotic and parakeratotic hyperkeratosis in which M. pachydermatis is sometimes identified. In addition to the alopecia, the cats have systemic signs of anorexia, weight loss, and lethargy. Feline Exfoliative Dermatitis with or without Thymoma. A generalized exfoliative dermatitis has been documented as a paraneoplastic syndrome of older cats with thymomas. More recently the condition has been recognized in dogs and rabbits.

Pemphigus foliaceus develops in association with antibodies to desmosomal proteins that are expressed predominantly in the upper keratinocyte layers. The major pemphigus foliaceus antigens, desmoglein 1 (in human beings) and desmocollin 1 (in dogs), are glycoproteins in the extracellular core of the desmosome. A, Desmosomes provide physical connections between keratinocytes and consist of keratin intermediate filaments, an intracytoplasmic attachment plaque region in which the intermediate filaments insert, and an extracellular core region. B, Acantholysis in pemphigus foliaceus is thought to be initiated when autoantibodies bind to antigens that are important in cell-to-cell adhesion (also called cadherins), particularly desmoglein 1 or desmocollin 1. Although autoantibodies have been demonstrated in the sera of affected individuals, the precise mechanisms that ultimately result in acantholysis are incompletely understood.

Types I, II, and III are mediated by antibodies and are distinguished by the type of antigen and class of antibody involved. Type I responses are mediated by IgE bound to the high-affinity IgE receptor on the surface of mast cells.Binding of foreign (exogenous) antigen to IgE cross-links these receptors, inducing mast-cell activation. Type II responses are mediated by IgG or IgM directed to antigens bound to the surface of the cell or part of cell membrane. The reaction can engage Fc receptor and complement-mediated effector mechanisms. Type III responses are mediated by IgG or IgM directed against soluble antigens, and the tissue damage is caused by responses triggered by immune complexes. Type IV hypersensitivity reactions are mediated by T lymphocytes and can be subdivided into three groups. In the first group, tissue damage is caused by CD4 +",

Gross lesions on the pawpads or nasal planum include a dry, thick, irregular, and rough surface in which crusts, fissures, or erosions can develop (see .

In FIP, multifocal cutaneous papules and nodules are due to granulomatous to pyogranulomatous vasculitis with leukocytoclasia.Vasculitis has also developed in cats infected with virulent systemic strains of feline calicivirus. Infection with this virus has caused facial and limb edema, oral ulceration, and variable alopecia, crusting, and ulceration of the nose, lips, pinnae, and pawpads, in addition to lesions in visceral and internal organs. Virus has been identified in keratinocytes, mucosal and follicular epithelium, and endothelium of small dermal vessels, where it causes epithelial cytolysis and endothelial injury. Virus-induced vascular injury is associated with edema and microthrombi and fibrin accumulation.",

However, some cats have tested positive for FIV. Affected cats have hypergammaglobulinemia and a response to immunomodulating therapy, leading to the hypothesis that feline plasma cell pododermatitis is an idiopathic immune-mediated disease. It is characterized clinically by soft, painless swelling of multiple pawpads that can lead to collapse of the pawpad and ulceration, hemorrhage, and lameness. Histologically, the skin of the pawpad is heavily infiltrated by plasma cells with variable quantities of intracytoplasmic immunoglobulin (Russell bodies), neutrophils, and lymphocytes. This condition is sometimes accompanied by plasmacytic stomatitis, immune-mediated glomerulonephritis, or renal amyloidosis.",

Feline progressive histiocytosis is a rare condition in middle-aged to older cats resulting in development of cutaneous histiocytic masses most often on the head, distal extremities, or trunk. Immunophenotyping of the histiocytic cells has revealed expression of CD1a, CD11/18, MHC II, and usually a lack of E-cadherin expression. These features are most consistent with interstitial dendritic cells. Also present are reactive lymphocytes that express CD3 and CD8. Feline progressive histiocytosis behaves as a low-grade histiocytic sarcoma. Gross lesions begin with the development of one or more dermal masses that may subsequently enlarge and coalesce into larger plaquelike areas that may remain limited to the skin. In some cases there may be spread to regional lymph nodes. In addition, some masses may become poorly differentiated and develop invasive features of histiocytic sarcoma with spread to one or more internal organs.Histologic lesions consist of circumscribed, but nonencapsulated masses in the dermis and panniculus that are broader at the surface than the base. The masses consist of large rounded to polyhedralshaped histiocytic cells with a large central vesicular nucleus. Less than half of the cases have epitheliotropism (extension of the histiocytic cells into the epidermis). In addition to lymphocytes, neutrophils and vacuolated macrophages may be present.",
