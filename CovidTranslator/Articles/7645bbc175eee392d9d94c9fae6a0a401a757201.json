A total of 22 cattle farms (10 beef herds and 12 dairy herds) were visited once every 21 days between January and December 2000. A faecal sample was collected directly from the rectum of each of the 844 calves born during the study period. Each sample was studied macroscopically to establish its consistency as liquid, soft or solid, and the presence of mucus or blood noted. C. parvum oocysts were identified by direct microscopic examination and the intensity of infection established semiquantitatively as slight, moderate or severe. Of the 844 calves, 404 were found to have the parasite in their faeces, i.e. the prevalence was 47.9%. Statistical analysis of the risk factors such as general characteristics of the farm and the housing conditions of the calves, revealed three variables that significantly effect the risk of cryptosporidial infection in suckling calves: the method of cleaning, the type of flooring and the frequency of cleaning.",

(1980) attributed an outbreak of neonatal diarrhoea in calves to parasitization by Cryptosporidium. Some years later, Tzipori et al. (1983) and Heine et al.

However, cryptosporidiosis should not only be considered from the perspective of animal health and production; its zoonotic character and the possibility that animals may act as a source of infection to humans, via foodstuff and water, should also be considered. Although the infection leads to few deaths, serious economic losses can occur because of problems associated with the resulting diarrhoea-dehydration, weight loss and slow growth (Sanford and Josephson, 1982) -and the costs involved in the treatment-oral administration of electrolytic solutions and drugs-and the application of suitable hygiene practices (de Graaf et al., 1999) . C. parvum is usually present without other agents, however, the costs involved increase in the case of multiple infections (Vanopdenbosch et al., 1979) .",

Furthermore, we believe that the prevalence was underestimated because the value was the result of direct (therefore limited) examination of a single sample from each calf. Other authors (Fayer et al., 1998) have reported that the prevalence of bovine cryptosporidiosis is underestimated because of the low number of samples taken during the pre-weaning period. Thus, when the faeces of 3-6-day-old calves chosen at random in a market were examined twice weekly for 1 month, the prevalence of infection was found to be 93.0% (Villacorta et al., 1991) . In contrast, when only one or two faecal samples per calf were examined during the pre-weaning period, less than 30.0% of the calves were found to have oocysts in their faeces (Garber et al., 1994; Maldonado et al., 1998) .",

These authors suggest that the delay may be due to passive immunity acquired by the calves, which remain with their mothers for longer periods than in dairy herds. However, various studies have shown that passive immunity acquired via colostrum and maternal milk does not provide protection in mice and calves experimentally infected by C. parvum (Moon et al., 1988; Harp et al., 1989) . Furthermore, Quigley et al. (1994) and Mohammed et al. (1999) observed a decrease in the risk of infection in calves which were separated from their mothers after only a few hours and fed manually. All of the calves in the present study were separated from their mothers immediately after birth, although they were fed with colostrum pooled from different cows, during the first few hours of their lives.",

However, Atwill et al. (1999) , who carried out a study over a period of 6 months, used statistical analysis to show that in California, calves are at most risk of contracting the infection in the month of May, possibly because this is when the animals have most contact with the source of infection, or their resistance to the infection is low, or environmental conditions most favour transmission of the infection. In contrast, in a year long study on the prevalence of neonatal bovine cryptosporidiosis in France, Lefay et al. (2000) found that the lowest levels of parasitization were found in July and August. Taking into account these contradictory reports, we did not find any significant association between the time of year and the prevalence of infection. The values obtained fluctuated between a minimum of 34.5% in January and a maximum of 60.0% in February. The prevalence found in May, July and August was 44.5, 45.9 and 41.4%, respectively. We assume that the absence of notable climatic changes in Galicia throughout the year as well as the lack of a particular calving season explain our results. The absence of seasonality in the presence of infection has been described by Wade et al. (2000) in a study of 109 dairy farms in five regions in the southeast of New York state.",
