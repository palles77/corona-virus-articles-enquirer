            "text": "The universe we occupy and time itself came into existence around 13 billion years ago, as proposed by the big bang theory. 18 The universe is composed of galaxies. The galaxies (eg, the Milky Way) have several solar systems. Our solar system is composed of the sun and the revolving planets, of which the earth is one. The diameter of the Milky Way is 100,000 light years (a light year is the distance [6 trillion miles] that light, speeding at 186,300 miles/s, travels in 1 year [http://www.pbs.org/wnet/ hawking/html/home.html]). The planet earth appeared approximately 4.55 billion years ago. However, only in 1543 AD did Nicolas Copernicus 1. Reduce extreme poverty and hunger by one half relative to 1990 2. Achieve universal primary education 3. Promote gender equality and empowerment of women 4. Reduce child mortality by two thirds relative to 1990 5. Improve maternal health, including reducing maternal mortality by three quarters relative to 1990 6. Prevent the spread of HIV/AIDS, malaria, and other diseases 7. Ensure environmental sustainability 8. Develop a global partnership for development fossil fuels. These GGEs are found in the earth atmosphere and allow sunlight free access to the earth's atmosphere. Some of this sunlight is reflected back to space as infrared radiation (heat). GGEs absorb and trap this sunlight. This upsets the balance of heat emitted by the sun and reflected back, thus causing a rise in global temperature. It is estimated that global temperature may rise in the range of 1.9\u00b0C to 11.5\u00b0C by the end of the 21st century. 23 Recent information from Greenland reveals that the ice sheet discharge accelerated from 90 to 220 cubic kilometers per year over the past decade. 24 Additionally, the displacement of ozone by these gases, which reflect the harmful ultraviolet sunlight, can have potential harmful effects on health, particularly with its effect on DNA.",

The accelerated increase of old diseases such as tuberculosis, and the emergence of virulent zoonotic disease such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Lyme disease, are natural consequences of environmental changes and the imbalance within ecosystems. It is estimated that indoor and urban air pollution with subsequent acute respiratory infection contributes to more than 2 million global deaths per year. Unfortunately, the Kyoto Protocol, which aims to decrease GGEs to 5% by 2008 to 2012 has not been officially initiated (the United States is still deliberating on final approval/participation). 23 Hartmann, 27 in his provocative book, The Last Hours of Ancient Sunlight, highlights the dangers of fossil fuels, and the subsequent sequelae of the exhaustion of fossil fuels, particularly the effect on global warming. He warns of the danger of a new ice age with the effects of global warming on the balance of the Coriolis effect or the spin of the earth and the Great Conveyer Belt or the flow of warm surface water from the equator to the northern regions. The warm, less salty water grows cool and more salty, sinking to form an exiting deep sea river, with the Great Conveyer Belt pushing the warmer water north again. With global warming the northern component is threatened, thereby decreasing the \"belt\" and making it colder in the northern hemispheres, particularly in North America and Europe. 27 The dire health effects now seen will be compounded by the global economic/political struggles that will emerge relating to the cost and competition for these diminishing fossil fuel resources. Even now, nuclear energy is making a comeback, especially in emerging economies such as India.",

The major climates include altitude, dry heat, cold, tropical, maritime (terrain with direct access to water), and temperate. The terrain or location is important as well. The majority of voluntary efforts are in areas hovering around the equator or in warmer climates, since these are the areas most affected by environmental fluctuations and changes. The equator is tragically the epicenter of the poverty belt. Working in a tropical climate demands attention to seasonal changes (eg, rainy seasons and hurricane seasons). Working in high altitude or cold climates must allow for acclimatization and avoidance of winter seasons. Maritime areas are of concern, especially insofar as water-borne diseases are concerned. Hot weather, dry or tropical, requires insight into the seasonal variations of native or local healthcare activity and the incidence of communicable diseases. Adjustment to terrain is extremely important, insofar as access to the site, or mobility within the site or the area served. Air, sea/river/lake, ground transportation of people, equipment, supplies are logistical considerations that must be addressed. Tragically, many injuries and deaths of volunteers occur during local travel accidents. Attention to climate, terrain, and access are, therefore, vital concerns.",

Local governments can be a help or hindrance, or both. \"All politics are local,\" as Tip O'Neil once said. 28 Visas, customs, security, accessibility to government-sponsored health systems or structure are all controlled by the local and central governments. There are many classifications of government, but a useful one is summarized in Table 3 . It is governments and politics that build the structure and system and provide order and security. Yet it is the individual people who make it inhabitable and livable. Clear examples of an imbalance of both sides are Haiti, where there is no consistent or stable government or system, and Sierra Leone, where the people or groups of people have disrupted the country because of individual greed, corruption, or tribal strife, and live in a state of continued, chronic civil war/strife.",

            "text": "Political systems parallel the evolution of human society. Some, such as Karl Marx, feel that this evolution is predetermined and does not regress to a previous stage. 29 The stages include the tribal stage, which is a collective ownership stage, and the products of labor are collected and distributed in an equal manner. Many African countries were divided along arbitrary political and geographic lines, without consideration of the various tribes involved. Nigeria is a prime example of many tribes, where the primary allegiance is to the tribe and not the country. The colonial powers took advantage of this, in favoring certain powers to their own selfish purposes and agenda. Dire consequences have arisen, as witnessed in the genocide activity in Rwanda, Burundi, and the Sudan. The next stage is the feudal society or the monarchy stage, where everything, including land and production, is owned by the monarch. Theocratic societal systems fit in here, where the dominant religious group controls the society. The Italian Papal states and the more recent Muslim regimes, such as Iran, are notable examples. The capitalist stage is marked by private ownership-individuals, government, or corporate. Socialism and communism are a blend of the stages, where both production and ownership are shared. So, in summary, the stages or systems are composed of the method of production-slave, tribal, feudal, capitalist, and the ownership-private or collective. 29 Probably the greatest challenge/problem with regard to voluntary efforts is the myriad of governmental structures including: bureaucracy; lack of strategic/organizational or tactical/managerial structure; corruption; nepotism; and fiscal mismanagement. No matter what the level of voluntary activity, governments are involved-local, central, or both. It is important to know the governmental/political structure of a given country to better understand how the healthcare component is managed. In most emerging countries, it is the Minister of Health and the associated bureaucracy that controls and dictates policies and financial expenditures. Fortunately or unfortunately, people compose governments, so the ego or human factor becomes an integral part of the process. Developing relationships with strategic and tactical partnerships becomes central and crucial to any effect-short-, mid-, or long-term in any country. Knowing who controls and manages healthcare policies and directives is an important aspect of voluntary activity. As an example, the 46th meeting of the PanAmerican Health Organization's (PAHO) Directing Council, in September 2005, brought together all of the health ministers from the Western hemisphere, including the United States, to discuss mutual health interests, particularly natural disasters, infectious diseases, and, in particular, the endemic/ epidemic effects of emerging virulent strains of avian influenza virus (http://www.paho.org/English/DD/PIN/ptoday07_nov05.htm).

The landmark work in this area was a series of 4 reports published in The Lancet by C.J.L. Murray and Alan D. Lopez. [44] [45] [46] [47] They also introduced and employed the standard unit, DALY, to help comparisons for disability and length of life (DALYs are the sum of life years lost due to premature mortality and years lived with disability adjusted for severity). 44, 46 The total deaths for 2002 were 57,029 million. 48 Of interest to cardiothoracic surgeons are those deaths related to ischemic heart disease (\u03fe6.8 million), tuberculosis (\u03fe1.6 million), road traffic accidents (\u03fe1.2 million), thoracic malignancies (\u03fe1.2 million), rheumatic heart disease (\u03fe480,000), and congenital heart anomalies (\u03fe280,000). 48 The sobering fact is that the incidence of chronic diseases is increasing, especially in emerging economies 49 (Table  5 ). The correlation of income and chronic disease has emerged as a major health hazard. Unfortunately, the millennium development goals do not focus on this growing problem/challenge of chronic diseases. 50 The global burden of cardiovascular disease is borne out by more than 11 million annual deaths from cardiovascular (CVD) and cerebrovascular diseases. An epidemiological discussion that encompasses demographics has been outlined by Gaziano. 51 The basic facts are that CVD accounted for 10% of all deaths at the dawn of the 20th century, and at the dusk of the 20th century economics accounts for 50% of deaths in developed countries and 25% of deaths in emerging economics. The pattern shows a dramatic increase in CVD in emerging countries as the 21st century progresses. Parallel economic, social, and demographic changes follow along with this transition concept. The economic changes include industrialization, globalization, and urbanization. Social changes are primarily diet and activity changes. Demographic transition, alluded to earlier, changes not only the balance of birth and death rates, but rising age rates, with subsequent emergence of more chronic diseases.",

Social aspects encompass culture, customs, lifestyle, education, and health. All 4 impact on health. Unfortunately education and healthcare issues remain low on the budgets of many countries. The reasons are vague to many and clear to others. The percentage of GDP allocated to health gives some guarantee to quantity of care, but not necessarily quality of care. The example of the United States has already been given. The UN has been the major force in addressing global health issues via the WHO. During the UN Millennium Summit in 2000 targeted goals for the year 2015 were established 7 ( Table   TABLE 5 2). The directly related health issues are maternal health and mortality, child mortality, and communicable diseases.

Movement, simply put, is shrinking the time element for the transfer of ideas, information, technology, skills, money, people, and product/goods. 30 This has been achieved primarily by the computer/ Internet and the advanced forms of physical transportation-air, sea, and land. The second process or phenomenon is the integration of the elements of transfer into a global or universal structure.

This is the perspective of the WTO, which is attempting to increase world trade by eliminating or modifying trade barriers between countries, thus increasing the free flow of produced goods and natural resources. As a negative challenge it is perceived with fear and hostility, representing a catalyst for increased inequality between countries, with benefits favoring primarily the developed, industrialized nations. Fostering this belief is a world economic outlook study that examined 42 countries representing 90% of the world population. 58 Output per capita per country rose but distribution among countries became more uneven as the 20th century progressed. Perhaps a better tool to assess this objectively is the Human Development Index (HDI). (1990 to 1991-United Nations established the Human Development Index, which includes GDP or GDP per head, adult literacy, average years of schooling, and life expectancy [scaled 0-100, with \u03fe80 as high, 50-79 as medium, and \u03fd50 as low]. 30 ) The lowest country HDI is Sierra Leone (27.3) , the highest is Norway (95.6), and the United States is eighth at 93.9. In comparing economic considerations alone the differences remain obvious. 30 In summing up the SPEED aspects in concert with globalization, it may be interesting to examine the global perspective and the priorities of approach. The Copenhagen Consensus was a meeting of international authorities in 2004 to discuss global issues and crises and develop prioritized solutions. 59 Targeted challenges with promising opportunities in health were only seen in communicable disease. As shown, all of the opportunities have clear indirect effects on overall global health care, particularly climate change, which is directly related to the overuse and depletion of fossil fuels. 27 ",

Jones 60 gives a nice historical review of the U.S. healthcare system from the 17th century on into the 21st century. The accelerated phase of American health care occurred after World War II. The federal government began increased financial support for medical research, mental health, the Veterans Administration, and community hospital construction (Hill-Burton Program). The National Institutes of Health (NIH) expanded from intramural efforts in Bethesda, Maryland, to extramural funding. Pharmaceutical funding also increased. Private insurance and managed care received another partner, the federal government, with the establishment of Medicare and Medicaid in 1965. It has been managed care and the federal/state programs that have contributed to the slower acceleration of healthcare costs. In the United States today, the major healthcare concerns remain the slower but still increasing costs of health care, access to adequate care by uninsured working patients, quality assurance/outcomes, and to a lesser degree providing access and care to the poor income bracket of American society. 30, 61 It is unreasonable to assume that the global population of 6.5 billion will eventually have the same level of care as the developed nations. Even the United States, as pointed out, with more than 40 million uninsured nonelderly Americans, does not have a balanced and equitable level of health care. 61 The challenges are sobering and real. The ongoing debate between the neo-Malthusians who believe the growing world population is unsustainable, and the Technocentrists who believe that emerging technologies can and will support a rising world population, continues to evoke a sustained emotional response. (Thomas Malthus [1766 -1834 -\"Political economist who warned of the potential of unchecked population growth to outstrip growth of the means of subsistence. The solution lay in 'moral restraint,' for instance by postponement of marriage, which would reduce the birth rate. These fears abated during the course of the19th century but arose again in the middle of the 20th century when rates of population growth in the poorer regions of the world started to accelerate. In testimony to his enduring influence the leaders of the international family planning movement that arose in response to this population growth were often characterized as neo-Malthusians.\" 62 ) The Darwinian evolution theories as advanced by Herbert Spencer (originator of phrase \"survival of the fittest\") espoused natural selection. 20 The new school of social Darwinists have advanced the competitive survival of the fittest to include collaboration or an inclusiveness of all members of society. 20 Such is the nature of most Americans (ie, the constant struggle to achieve balance between selfishness, self-reliance, rugged individualism, justice, and altruism, humanitarianism, compassion, forgiveness). All of these were outlined in profound depth by Ralph Waldo Emerson in his Essay on Self-Reliance 63 : \"Do that which is assigned you, and you cannot hope too much or dare too much.\" The roots of the Judeo-Christian ethic continue to run deep in American society. 13 Our European colleagues also share this goal or desire for inclusiveness. Yet it requires that the medical profession retain or regain its \"moral compass.\" This involves public trust. Once again, trust becomes a recurring theme. To retain or regain societal trust includes the ethic of professionalism. The British Royal College of Physicians has outlined the commitments to integrity, compassion, altruism, continuous improvement, excellence, and working within a cooperative team atmosphere. 64 These values form a moral contract between the medical profession and society.",

This imposes duties and obligations on those with the ability to grant and ensure those rights. This has become a dominant theme for most multilateral, bilateral efforts.",

            "text": "Poverty remains a central theme when discussing health care, since many of the diseases and healthcare issues are rooted in poverty. As 1 of the main goals of the MDGs, poverty remains a formidable challenge. World hunger is a direct result of poverty, whatever the root causes (eg, wars, conflicts, or natural disasters such as drought, earthquakes, and floods). More than 800 million people go to bed hungry, mostly children. The major source of donated food is the UN World Food Programme (WFP) (http://www.wfp.org/english/). From a high of 15 million tons of donated food per year in 1999, it dropped to 11 million tons in 2001. In December 2005, the WFP ended its program in China, where still 80% of the population is considered poor. Yet China has recognized this imbalance, and at the recent meeting of the Communist Party of China, the 11th new 5-year plan called for increased aid to rural farm workers and alienated portions of Chinese society, in an effort to create a more \"harmonious society.\" 9 The noted economist Jeffrey Sachs, the developing force for the MDGs, has been a strong advocate for alleviating extreme poverty. Using clinical economies, he advocates continued initiatives to address the root causes of poverty (ie, polluted water, poor soil, and lack of basic health care). 7 He maintains the key to escaping poverty is increased assistance to allow basic infrastructure and human capital to be put in place. He emphasizes the use of simple technology in many initiatives (eg, mosquito nets for malaria prevention). 66 Yet once poverty is at least controlled or alleviated, staying out of poverty becomes the major issue. This involves finding a job or source of income. Globalization has helped in this area, particularly with global corporate initiatives to outsource for cheaper labor. However, this may only aggravate the Ricardo theory of the \"iron law of wages.\" (David Ricardo (1772-1823)-Economist Iron Law of Wages, 1817 [http://cepa.newschool.edu/het/profiles/ricardo.htm] www. fordham.edu/halsall/mod/ricardo-wages.html.) This means wages can be kept at a basic minimum, since workers are infinitely available, replaceable, and interchangeable. Witness the odyssey of the tennis shoe industry from country to country as the unskilled labor force changes. Again, the theory of Malthus comes to haunt us, in that he theorizes that human misery is inescapable because populations reproduce themselves exponentially.",

Looking at prevalence, mortality, and morbidity of certain infectious or communicable diseases, a priority approach was established that was cost-effective and for which there was adequate treatment or control effects. 66, 67 Strategies for CVD are evolving as well. Yusuf and colleagues 70 offer some useful guidelines for this emerging epidemic disease. 68 Let us look at the key differences between public health or preventive medicine and curative medicine 69, 70 (Table 8 , Fig 5) . Clearly the Ghana model is not practical or cost-effective. Current thinking is evolving to a more collaborative and interactive approach. 71 The development of the horizontal approach and streaming concept is a more disease-specific approach. 72 This allows both sides of the healthcare team to prioritize their efforts and share the advantages of individualized care, triage, and population/cohort dynamics. The curative practitioner looking at the horizontal model now places his individual patient in perspective, where all aspects are considered. The public health or preventive medicine practitioner also sees how the population or cohort fits into the streaming process so all components of the healthcare system are used in a coordinated, caring, and cost-effective manner. Even in the United States, the traditional departmental systems of medical schools and medical centers are evolving into a more efficient problem-, disease-, or systemsbased education, training, clinical practice, and research/development mode 73 (Fig 6) . Working together this fluid approach engages and prioritizes the resources available to act in an efficient and cost-effective manner. Thus the pyramidal system as traditionally practiced is becoming obsolete, particularly in emerging economies. 72 Financial support for all of these ambitious and creative efforts demand financial support. As a spin-off of the MDGs, the UN in 2001 established a Global Health Fund to focus on control of AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria. 74 To date $3 billion has been committed to 128 countries to support aggressive interventions. A case is being made to increase the Global Fund to include maternal, neonatal, and child survival. 75 Bilateral spending, aside from debt relief for targeted countries, and increased spending for HIV/AIDS initiatives, will not see dramatic changes. The NGOs and other charitable sources will continue to be the major source for most targeted, local health initiatives. The largest U.S. NGO foundation is the Bill Gates Foundation. His priority is summarized in an interview in Time Magazine. 76 Question:",

The ability to adapt and improvise and function in unusual or awkward situations requires a special talent and is familiar to them. They clearly know how to think and function \"out of the box.\" This has been demonstrated in the military where surgeons not only performed the above, particularly in dangerous situations, but historically introduced avant garde therapies (eg, the approach to penetrating heart injuries in World War II, vascular surgery in Korea and Vietnam, and now the advanced capabilities for definitive care within the combat zone, as witnessed presently in Iraq with the Forward Surgical Team [FST] concept). 97 The American College of Surgeons (ACS) has been cognizant and supportive of volunteer efforts and opportunities. The Bulletin of the ACS historically has published a series of articles regarding college member activities in both domestic and foreign volunteer humanitarian efforts. 98 Recently the ACS has developed a program-Operation Giving Back. 15 Promulgated by Andrew Warshaw, MD, a survey of ACS members was conducted in 2003. Eighty-eight percent of the responders volunteered at least once in their careers. Efforts to change malpractice laws, listing volunteer opportunities, and continued reporting of volunteer experiences in the Bulletin of the ACS were recommended. Additionally, the Archives of Surgery has published a series of articles relating to surgery in several foreign countries. 99 Under the directorship of Kathleen Casey, MD, the ACS website has become a major source for information relating to both domestic and foreign surgery volunteer efforts and opportunities. 15 The recent tsunami and Hurricane Katrina relief efforts are notable examples where volunteer opportunities for surgeons were listed.",

For many years religious-and non-religious-based medical missionaries have traveled to developing countries to deliver basic medical care. Although religious or humanitarian based, the trust and allegiance they gained has become the foundation on which these current strategies are based. Additionally, the corporate world has been involved. In many countries with foreign-based operations, clinics and hospitals were established to care for native workers (eg, Firestone Tire Corporation Hospital in Liberia to care for rubber plantation workers). The military, especially in the United States, has a long tradition of providing immediate, short-term care to noncombatants in foreign countries both in times of war and in times of peace, especially natural disasters. A tremendous effort was made by the former colonial powers to institute healthcare systems. Great Britain and France, in particular, established basic infrastructure including health care in their former colonies. The legacy remains in many of the colonies, particularly the anglophone and francophone countries of Africa. It is imperative to keep the host country's clinical healthcare history and experience in perspective. At present there are 3 types of clinical activities/relationships. The first is nonpaying patients with no local access to simple or complex care coming to the United States or other developed countries for \"free care.\" Although beneficial to the selective few, it requires an intense financial/ logistical effort. Large groups such as Rotary Gift of Life, Variety International, and Heal the Children still continue this activity, but at a much reduced level. The collateral benefit has been to give increased awareness to the international need, and it also helps with marketing and fundraising. The second area is paying patients coming for care-to be discussed further. Finally, the area of concentration is to go to the host site to provide short-term care, establish continuing relationships, and buy into the \"teach to fish\" mentality.",

The upgrade program is a place that is in need of economic relief, for example, equipment and supplies, or for demonstration of new or advanced procedures and specialized care. The rejuvenate program is where surgery has ceased for political, economic, and social reasons and wants to get reestablished. The de novo program is starting or introducing a center that is new and needs a total effort. These last 3 programs are the usual areas for voluntary humanitarian activity.

Biomedical engineers are a rare commodity, and therefore there is a total reliance on lucrative foreign corporate contracts for repair and maintenance. Basic local training in low-cost, portable ultrasonic equipment would be a tremendous advance in diagnostic capability (the Acuson Cyprus ECHO machine is a prime example of diagnosing congenital heart defects at the local, ambulatory level). The etiological, anatomic/regional, pathophysiological/subsystem approach to differential diagnosis and categorization may be useful (Table 14) .

Table 14 gives a global picture, in terms of regions to consider. When to go is important; climatic changes must be considered. Winter trips to the high altitude or cold regions should be avoided, as well as tropical storm seasons. Who to go with? Figs 10 and 11 give basic types of situations and Table 13 gives the ways of getting involved. Ideally, for the first time volunteers, it may be prudent to join an established small group or NGO on a focused short-term mission (\u03fd2 weeks). Another important aspect to consider is the level of surgical skills needed and the capacity to perform those skills at the given location 111 (Table 15 ). Also, consider the level of care already in place, with some consideration of traditional, yet sometimes unproven treatment schemes 110, 112 (Table 16) . Disease-specific missions, especially for surgical specialties, is of great value (eg, plastic surgery/ears/nose/throat groups performing cleft lip surgery, ophthalmology with cataract surgery, orthopedics with basic congenital deformities and osteomyelitis, gynecology with vaginal fistulas, and urology with urethral strictures). Most of 1. Surgical care must be effective and safe. 2. Surgical care must be widely accessible, either by transport systems or by regional centers. 3. Surgical care must be affordable within the local and national capacity. 4. Surgical care must be appropriate for local situations. Infrastructure, such as supply of electricity, communications, available laboratory and pharmaceutical capacity, and so forth must be considered in planning. 5. The surgical care system must be locally sustainable. Repeated provision of services by external visiting surgical teams can be extremely helpful, but should not take the place of permanent and affordable local programs. geons' practices in rural areas include endoscopic, gynecologic, orthopedic, urologic, and otolaryngolic procedures. This parallels the needs in developing countries. At the rural or referral health facilities in developing countries, trauma from road traffic injuries and violence/war occurs in 57% of the patients seen. 111 Knowledge and experience with Advanced Trauma Life Support (ATLS) training and the tactics of essential surgical care are needed. The WHO has developed the manual Surgical Care at the District Hospital (available at http://whqlibdoc.who.int/publications/ 2003/9241545755.pdf). This, along with the essential surgical skills course developed in Canada, are practical, broad-based sources of preparation for a rural experience in developing countries. 112 At this point I will introduce a sensitive subject. The motivation and reasons for these voluntary efforts are very personal and private. However, I would caution against the voluntary aspect of \"surgical tourism.\" Most programs are looking to develop friendships and lasting relationships. That also includes continued follow-up and future collaboration. The \"circus coming to town\" can have a negative impact and create an uncomfortable and awkward situation for all concerned.",

Initially seen with cosmetic surgery, this has extended to more complex procedures, such as renal transplantation and open heart surgery. Volunteers should be aware of this activity, particularly in Central America and the Caribbean, as well as in other emerging economies such as India and China. In certain foreign centers of excellence, the quality of surgery is comparable to Western standards, albeit at a much reduced \"out of pocket\" cost. Whether third party payers will get on board this notion of outsourcing medical care for U.S. patients remains to be seen. The India example is exemplified by Dr. Pratap C.

His goal is to make India the global healthcare destination. 114 This stands in the face of India providing only 2% of its GNP for healthcare services of its own population, and with more than 16% for military spending. 115 The other side of this area is foreign patients seeking care in U.S./ Western centers. Large U.S. centers such as the Cleveland Clinic have a large experience and active programs for funded patients from abroad. There has also been, and continues to be, to a much smaller degree, nonfunded patients coming to the United States for free or markedly discounted prices. Although valuable and life-saving to the fortunate few, this has not proven to be cost-effective or contribute to long-term efforts to help a larger number of patients who are poor or have no access or availability to complex/costly procedures at home. Its primary value has been to help the fortunate few, increase marketing for funding, and to continue to offer hope for the majority in their native country. If you are involved with volunteer efforts for these foreign patients, it is important to be actively involved in the process of selection and logistics (Table 17) . The unsung heroes in this endeavor are the nonmedical volunteers who provide local logistical help for patients and families. The foster families who open their hearts and homes to these fortunate few are a joy to watch and witness.",

Paying off this debt, funding residency beyond basic salary, and looking at decreased clinical jobs/opportunities, as well as decreasing caseloads with increased comorbidity, accountability, and expectations are the great challenges/problems facing the next generation of American trained surgeons.

The International Medical Education Directory, maintained by the Foundation for Advancement of International Medical Education and Research (FAIMER), tracks those medical schools recognized by their local government. 117 At the graduate training level the differences between the United States and the world varies tremendously. The United States uses an organized, standardized education/training system for graduate medical education (GME) or postgraduate training. The Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) coordinates GME. The ACGME is the umbrella organization for the Residency Review Committees (RRC). The American Board of Medical Specialties (ABMS) is the corresponding organization for the specialty boards (www.tsda.org/progdir/abms.htm; www.acgme.org/acwebsite/home/home.asp). With well-defined standards criteria for education/training, and requirements for certification, the trained U.S. physician is well prepared and qualified. Subsequent recertification, state licensure renewal, credentialing by hospitals, and continuing medical education (CME) help maintain a quality and accountability of medical practice. The surgical training system in the United States evolved from the European pyramidal/apprenticeship model, which was inherently unstructured and not time defined for completion. Before World War II, advanced surgical training was acquired in Europe. As an example, from 1870 to 1914, more than 15,000 U.S. undergraduate and postgraduate students studied in German medical schools alone. 118 This remains the system in many countries today.",

As an example, China, the 3rd largest country in the world, with a culture dating back over 7000 years and the largest population at more than 1.3 billion, does not have a national based graduate medical education program or system. Excluding 10% to 20% of 5-year medical school graduates after high school who do not pursue a medical career, the majority of students seek employment at predominantly government hospitals, controlled and managed by local medical schools or health bureaus. Each hospital designs and runs its own residency program in a pyramidal system that harkens back to the older European system. Recently, many of the larger urban medical centers have established organized residency programs. A model standardized 6-year cardiothoracic residency program has been initiated recently at Shanghai Chest Hospital under the auspices of the World Heart Foundation. Patterned after the U.S. system, it has been modified for China. The major challenge has been restructuring the faculty to accept a horizontal, time-limited training system with graduated degrees of resident responsibility and accountability. This is a challenging area and a viable opportunity for volunteer faculty, especially semiretired and retired surgeons (www.world-heart.org).",

            "text": "Preparation for working in an international area is sometimes difficult, complex, and challenging. Most current American trained surgeons, as mentioned, are not adequately prepared for international surgery. Several initiatives have been advanced to alleviate this program. Historically, Seymour Schwartz, MD, from Rochester, New York, published a text on tropical surgery, which demonstrated operative techniques for problems in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). Recently, Kamel and Lumley 120 published a comprehensive text on tropical surgery. Several surgical training programs have developed a rural surgery curriculum that better serves the needs of the rural or somewhat isolated areas. This is good preparation for foreign activities as well. Already, more surgical training programs in the United States, Canada, United Kingdom, and New Zealand are offering rural/international surgery training, as well as sponsoring and developing collaboration with emerging countries. The 2-fold goal is to allow residents an opportunity both to learn and to serve. They learn surgical techniques that are appropriate abroad as well as provide service in needed areas. Ozgediz and colleagues 121 have beautifully described a program developed between the surgery departments of the University of California at San Francisco and Makerere University in Kampala, Uganda. A pilot, voluntary 6-week clinical rotation is in evolution there. The major hurdles or obstacles in developing such a relationship are: a clear and concise memorandum and business plan; issues relating to visa, licensure, credentialing, housing, lodging; mentoring and supervision of resident cases; use of vacation time versus allowed elective time for credit; credentialing and academic appointments of the host country; recognition of credit for resident cases performed in the host country; financial support of residents by the donor program; and loss of resident workers from the donor program. Several recent on-site experiences illustrate the benefits derived for both the donor and host. Karamichalis and Moller 98 describe an experience of donor staff and residents providing clinical care and education in Mexico. This exemplifies the concept of coordinated missions where all participants learn from the experience. The future will see more U.S.-based residents seeking experience, exposure, volunteerism, and training in foreign programs that not only have available pathology but local staff with varying degrees of experience.",

The only constraint on reproduction and distribution, and the only role for copyright in this domain, should be to give authors control over the integrity of their work and the right to be properly acknowledged and cited. It is extremely important to have an objective idea of what the host program or effort is looking for. In the operating room the volunteer surgeon either observes, 2nd assists, 1st assists, or performs the operation. That is an important area to reflect on, because it changes within a given project or varies from project to project. Also for the surgeon, education/ training is accomplished at varying levels: mentor, coach, manager, or instructor level. The instructor level is very objective, short-term, and achievable (ie, teaching a specific technique or procedure). At the manager level, a systems process is introduced where team and structure are introduced. At the coaching level the integration of team and structure is brought into a systems analysis. The mentor level is the personalized, subjective aspect of teaching/advising. It is the level where both individuals and systems are looked at from a social/philosophical perspective that gives insight/suggestions on a long-term basis, grounded in trust, respect, admiration, congeniality, and concern. It is here that the human factor plays its greatest role. Loop, 148 in a classic treatise on mentoring, exploits the notion of the surgeon's professional life as involving education, achievement, and payback. Payback is the area where mentoring has its greatest effect. Mentoring is ultimately crucial for the development of personal standards, of which competence, personality, and character are critical components.",

Certainly not the major focus, R/D is an important element as emerging countries grow and develop. From the voluntary humanitarian perspective, ethical principles become a major concern. At the onset, ethical principles regarding clinical and education/training initiatives carry over into R/D. C. Rollins Hanlon, MD, 149 has nicely summarized the 6 major principles that should govern health care (Table 23 ). The ACS has carried these major principles over to the development of a \"Code of Professional Conduct.\" 150 Both these elements also apply to global humanitarian efforts. There are 2 areas that volunteers must be aware of. The first involves dealings with corporate or business individuals, especially in foreign countries where local practice is at variance with the U.S. standards. Recent codes in this area have been developed by Adva Med for the United States and should be applied internationally. 151 The second area is in research involving clinical subjects. Suffice it to say, clinical studies involving human subjects outside the United States should abide by all the ethical standards established by the international community. 152, 153 The National Bioethics Advisory Commission has developed guidelines for developing countries. 153 Additionally, on-site training of clinical researchers is tremendously valuable and is sorely needed. As an example, although India has more than 250,000 practicing physicians for more than 1 billion people, less than 200 investigators have been trained to carry out efficient, safe, and effective clinical research. 154 Proceeding in a phased way is a common sense approach. Case reports, limited then expanded retrospective studies, technical reports, and prospective studies using accepted statistical methods, and abiding by investigational review board standards and approval is the usual approach or sequence for young academic or investigational physicians. This includes ethics review, a favorable risk-benefit ratio, and informed consent. The revised Declaration of Helsinki in 2000 has defined this on the international level. 155 This revision declares that any treatment being tested in clinical trials should be compared with the best universal standard and not a placebo.",

Many would ask why volunteer to an area where everyone else involved in health care is leaving or wants to leave. One area of concern of this brain drain is the \"poaching phenomenon.\" This is primarily seen with developed countries inducing and recruiting already well-trained and capable nurses from less developed, emerging countries to come and work and stay. Two areas must be approached and discussed. The first is to look at strategic/tactical ways to stimulate training and education of foreign students in healthcare areas needed. The second is to look at ways to keep foreign healthcare workers at home by making it more attractive to remain at home. The problem is real. 161 Almost 13,000 foreign nurses were registered to work in the United Kingdom during 2002 to 2003. 162 Nurse recruiters from the United States have ventured to Canada, Ireland, and the Philippines, recruiting nurses for needed positions in the United States.

It is accepted that knowledge, skill, experience, and judgment are key components in surgical problem solving, but without the instruments, equipment, and supplies to facilitate the task, the problem remains unsolved. Product is an important aspect. Historically, most volunteer efforts have involved donated product that is sent before the mission or carried along with the individual or team. It is generally donated or purchased at discounted prices. Several major problems may be encountered with product. First, used or rehabilitated equipment requires maintenance and biomedical preventive care. Parts and local expertise in repair are usually nonexistent or unavailable. Second, donated product must clear customs. Sometimes this is an arduous task. Paying customs fees/charges seems ludicrous, but it is a reality in most countries. Hospitals may be penalized for accepting donated goods. Their budget may be decreased since they are getting \"free product.\" Last, local distributors may complain to the hospital. There are several possible and proven solutions to these problems. First, use only practical durable equipment that is new or rehabilitated. Service manuals must be supplied. Train local biomedical personnel where possible. Second, arrange a clear system regarding customs charges exclusion criteria negotiated before entry, especially with drugs (certainly narcotics). Third, government-or state-subsidized hospitals/clinics must not penalize local budgets. Last, work out a \"deal\" with distributors.

The recent response to Hurricane Katrina is an example of less-than-ideal response at all levels, but particularly at the federal level. The role for general surgeons and surgical specialties is varied. Despite basic training and experience with trauma at the ATLS level, the needed skills and knowledge at a multitrauma level require a basic change in focus. Whereas the focus on the sickest most traumatized patient(s) is clearly logical, the triage approach of concentrated care of the least injured at the mass casualty, multitrauma level requires a reorientation and reevaluation of current training systems. Volunteering in this area requires 3 essentials: an interest and desire to get involved; a search for opportunities to gain basic knowledge and skills in this area; and volunteer with established individuals, groups, organizations, or institutions (Appendix 3).",

Volunteer efforts are usually planned (ie, designated teams with volunteers ready to be deployed). The National Disaster Medical System (NDMS) is a planned response system to provide emergency medical assistance. It has 3 primary objectives: to provide health-related care and services; to evacuate patients to locations outside the epicenter of the event; and to provide hospital care in government and nongovernment hospitals that are part of the network. The Disaster Medical Assistance Teams (DMATs) are groups of medical personnel set up to respond to disasters or unusual events. Composed of approximately 35 individuals or more, they are rapid response and provide primary care or augment local staff. 172 Carried further, a mass-casualty incident medical response includes: search and rescue, triage and initial stabilization, definitive care, and evacuation out of the region for specialized or long-term management/ rehabilitation. Natural disasters, however, must be distinguished from complex emergencies. These tend to be larger in scale and last longer. They also involve military strife, displacement, migration, and all of the sequelae of refugee living, particularly in austere climate and terrain situations (eg, the recent earthquake in Pakistan).",

The military medical mission is to preserve the fighting force by assuring and maintaining the individual soldier, seaman, or airman to be fit to fight and deployable worldwide. The military is the most suitable and qualified to handle emergency and disaster situations. In addition to its combat mission is the peacetime mission to provide care and services to active duty personnel, active duty dependents, retirees, and retired dependents. Whether in wartime, peacetime, or manmade or natural emergencies/disasters, the military health team has provided assistance when directed. The humanitarian aspect of the military healthcare mission is well recognized, but not widely known in the civilian sector. Inspired by such individuals as Dominique Jean Larrey, Napoleon's surgeon, humanity on the battlefield has been extended to treat all battlefield wounded with excellent care, regardless of their status (ie, military or civilian). There are countless examples of medical humanitarian efforts associated with both wartime and peacetime missions. 176 Recent humanitarian military operations include Operation Provide Hope to Rwanda, Operation Restore Hope to Somalia, and recent missions for Hurricane Katrina and the tsunami tragedy in Southeast Asia.",

The lethality of war wounds has decreased progressively from 42% in the Revolutionary War, 33% in the Civil War, 30% in World War II, 24% in Vietnam, and now 10% in Iraq/ Afghanistan. More than 66% of injuries in Iraq are secondary to improvised explosive devices, shrapnel, or explosions and 16% are secondary to gunshot wounds. Protective body armor, advanced care at the site of injury, rapid evacuation, and advances in multiple trauma care have contributed to the decreased lethality of injury. Lessons learned in the military have permeated civilian practice and certainly volunteer efforts. The specialized units of World War II, the aggressive approach to vascular wounds in Korea, and the understanding of adult respiratory syndrome (Da Nang Lung) in Vietnam are but a few of the military surgical contributions. The forward surgical team (FST) concept in Iraq has already shown its effectiveness. 97 The FST is composed of 10 officers and 10 enlisted personnel: 3 trauma surgeons, 1 orthopedic surgeon, 2 nurse anesthetists (certified registered nurse anesthetists), 3 clinical nurses, and 1 operations officer. The team is designed to perform 30 operations over 72 hours. This exhausts their equipment/supply capability. The design and concept has practical application in clinical scenarios.",

A basic understanding of epidemics is necessary in the wake of disasters. Primary epidemics are related to infectious diseases (eg, SARS). Secondary epidemics following natural or manmade disasters include infectious diseases (eg, cholera, diarrhea) that are due to disruption of infrastructure (sanitation, contaminated water). These are part of the newly recognized complex emergency situations. 186 These are acute situations that occur in natural or manmade events or disasters and affect large populations over large or small geographical areas. In addition to the acute event, the sequelae of communicable diseases, climatic changes, migration, refuges, and food shortages compound the situation over varying periods of time. The tsunami catastrophe in Southeast Asia and the Pakistani earthquake are present examples of complex emergencies. It should be stressed that it is the combination of communicable diseases, along with malnutrition, that account for the majority of deaths in these complex emergencies. Again the preventive measures take precedence. These include site planning, clean, potable water, sanitation, nutrition, immunization, vector control, personal protection (shelter, nets), personal hygiene, health education, and disease treatment. 187 ",
