            "text": "The viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) is essential for multiplication of all RNA viruses. The sequence diversity of an RNA virus population contributes to its ability to infect the host. This diversity emanates from errors made by the RdRp during RNA synthesis. The physical basis for RdRp fidelity is unclear but is linked to conformational changes occurring during the nucleotide-addition cycle. To understand RdRp dynamics that might influence RdRp function, we have analyzed all-atom molecular dynamics (MD) simulations on the nanosecond timescale of four RdRps from the picornavirus family that exhibit 30-74% sequence identity. Principal component analysis showed that the major motions observed during the simulations derived from conserved structural motifs and regions of known function. Dynamics of residues participating in the same biochemical property, for example RNA binding, nucleotide binding or catalysis, were correlated even when spatially distant on the RdRp structure. The conserved and correlated dynamics of functional, structural elements suggest co-evolution of dynamics with structure and function of the RdRp. Crystal structures of all picornavirus RdRps exhibit a template-nascent RNA duplex channel too small to fully accommodate duplex RNA. Simulations revealed opening and closing motions of the RNA and NTP channels, which might be relevant to NTP entry, PP i exit and translocation. A role for nanosecond timescale dynamics in RdRp fidelity is supported by altered dynamics of the high-fidelity G64S derivative of PV RdRp relative to wild-type enzyme. . Table S1 lists the amino acid sequence numbering for the different subdomains, motifs A-G, and functional regions I-III of the RdRps used in the study. Figure S1 shows the structure-based sequence alignment for the different RdRps. Figure S2 shows the time series plot of RMSD for the different simulated systems. Figure S3 shows representative structures for the clusters C1-C4 of PV RdRp in two views. Figure S4 shows snapshots corresponding to the beginning, middle, and end of the simulation trajectories of the four RdRps. Figure S5 compares analyzed B-factors for the different simulated RdRps. Figure S6 compares the per-residue RMSD analysis for the different simulated RdRps. Figure S7 compares the radius of gyration analysis for the different RdRps. Figure S8 compares the RNA channel width in the different simulated RdRps. Figure S9 compares PCA and DCCM analyses from 25 and 52 ns simulations of PV RdRp.",

In the past decade alone, the incidence of infections by hepatitis C virus, West Nile virus and Dengue virus has increased. Eradication of poliovirus (PV) has been thwarted by the reemergence of virulent strains, most often the result of recombination between a vaccine strain and a circulating enterovirus such as Coxsackievirus A. 1; 2 Previously unknown viruses such as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS Cov) have emerged and spread across the globe, causing morbidity and mortality and highlighting our lack of preparedness to deal with such outbreaks. Replication of the genomes of positive strand RNA viruses requires the virus encoded RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp). This enzyme uses the RNA genome as a template for polymerization of ribonucleotides to form a negative-strand RNA intermediate, which, in turn, is used as template for production of progeny genomes. Inhibition of RdRp activity will prevent genome replication and virus multiplication.",

Interestingly, ribavirin is the only clinically approved broad-spectrum antiviral nucleoside. 4; 6 The clinical efficacy of any inhibitor will be antagonized by the development of resistance. Mechanisms of resistance to ribavirin have been studied most extensively in PV 7; 8; 9 and the related foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV). 10; 11; 12 These studies have revealed that RdRp variants exhibiting altered fidelity of nucleotide incorporation are less sensitive to ribavirin in cell culture. 7; 8; 12 However, viruses harboring these ribavirinresistant alleles of the RdRp are attenuated in animals 13 , and these attenuated viruses elicit protective immunity against a lethal challenge with wild-type virus. 14 Together, these studies lead to the suggestion that RdRp fidelity is optimized to provide RNA viruses with population diversity that is apparently required for pathogenesis. Therefore, RdRp fidelity represents an important, untapped target for development of antiviral agents and development of attenuated virus variants that can be used as vaccine strains. Unfortunately, the physical basis for nucleic acid polymerase fidelity is not completely clear.",

The structure of the PV RdRp revealed three subdomains: fingers (including fingertips), thumb and palm ( Figure  1a ). 17 Interaction between the fingertips and thumb leads to a completely encircled active site (Figure 1a) . The fingers and thumb subdomains contribute primarily to nascent RNA (primer) and template binding ( Table 1 ). The palm subdomain is required for interacting with the primer 3\u2032 end, templating nucleotide, incoming nucleotide substrates and divalent cations, all of which contribute to the nucleotidyl transfer reaction catalyzed by the RdRp ( Table 1 ). The RNA template and nucleoside substrates access the active site through the template and NTP channels, respectively; for the egress of the newly synthesized RNA, the template-nascent RNA duplex channel is used. The recent structure of PV RdRp in complex with RNA substrate clearly showed the template and template-nascent RNA duplex occupying their corresponding channels. 18 The conserved functions of the RdRp are mediated by conserved structural motifs (A-G in Figure 1b ) that contain conserved residues (Table 1) . Structures are also available for the RdRps from Coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3), human rhinovirus type 16 (HRV16) and FMDV. 19; 20; 21 The structures of these RdRps are essentially identical to the PV RdRp in spite of substantial sequence differences ( Figure S1 ).",

We observed the largest amplitude motions for residues contributing to conserved structural motifs required for nucleic acid and nucleotide binding and catalysis. Correlated motions were also apparent for these dynamic structural motifs. In contrast, conserved structural motifs required for divalent cation binding were the least flexible. Finally, rigid-body movement of the fingers and thumb subdomains relative to the palm subdomain led to expansion and contraction of the RNA and NTP channels, revealing the conformation that likely exist in solution. Given these intriguing findings of potential mechanistic and biological importance, we extended our analysis to RdRps from related viruses, specifically CVB3, HRV16 and FMDV. Overall, there was congruence in the results obtained for the RdRps from all four viruses. Together, these studies provide compelling evidence for coevolution of dynamics and structure among the picornavirus RdRps and provides support for the hypothesis that RdRp dynamics is required for function. Finally, we used MD simulation of the high-fidelity derivative of PV RdRp (G64S) to show that this single amino acid substitution altered the dynamics of elements implicated in binding and conformational rearrangements of the NTP substrate. We conclude that dynamics is an important contributor to RdRp functions, in particular the fidelity of nucleotide selection.",

The largest structural variations between the different clusters were mainly in the region 375-391; the helices of the thumb; the regions 16-70, 103-118 and motif F of the fingers; and motif A of the palm. Cluster analysis provides additional support for movement of fingers and thumb relative to the palm described above.

To yield information on components of the PV RdRp structure that are major contributors to the motions observed during the simulation, we performed a principal component analysis (PCA) 35; 36 using the trajectory of the entire production run. This analysis considers motions as the variance of atomic fluctuations around the average structure. Here we only considered the variance (mean-square displacements) of C\u03b1 atoms. The number of principal components (PCs or modes) is equal to 3 \u00d7 C\u03b1 atoms (461 atoms in the case of PV RdRp). Every mode is associated with an eigenvalue, which corresponds to the magnitude of the fluctuation along that particular mode and contains different contributions from the analyzed atoms. The first mode represents the largest atomic fluctuation in the sampled conformations. The second mode represents the next largest atomic fluctuation orthogonal to the axis of the previous mode and so on. A majority (~70%) of the total variance sampled during the simulation could be accounted for by the top six principal components. Therefore, we restricted our focus to these principal components. We calculated the displacement of each C\u03b1 atom in each of the top six modes which was then summed to produce the total displacement for the individual residues represented by C\u03b1 atoms. In order to render the PCA in a manner that would facilitate comparisons with other simulated systems, the perresidue sum of the displacements of the top six modes was normalized to the average of the least flexible 5% of residues in the enzyme.",

An interesting dichotomy was observed again when evaluating conserved structural motifs in the palm subdomain. Motifs A, D and E were quite dynamic; motifs B and C were not. In general, all regions of PV RdRp known to interact with RNA, nucleotide or metal contained elements exhibiting both \"high\" and \"low\" flexibility. For example, residues 18-26, 96-112, 120-149 (region I in Figure 4a ) and 405-423 (region III in Figure 4a ) interact with RNA and exhibit high mobility ( Figure 4a ). However, residues 208-217 and 288-292, which also interact with RNA, exhibit low mobility (Figure 4a ). The functional significance of this observation, if any, is not clear. (32-39, 41-53, 226-227, and 426-461) with no known function in nucleotidyl transfer also contributed to the motions observed during the simulation (Table  2) . Interestingly, essentially all of these regions are important for optimal viral fitness at 39.5\u00b0C 37 and for the recruitment of the polymerase to the initiation complex. 38 We considered the direction of motion for PC1, which accounts for 42% of the total motions( Figure 4c ). This analysis revealed expansion-contraction and/or hinge-twisting motions of the three channels of the enzyme. First, the template-nascent RNA duplex channel (denoted as nascent RNA channel) opened and closed more than once during the simulation. Each cycle of opening and closing comprised residues of the fingers (1-16, 96-149 and 269-283) and the thumb moving in opposite directions that resembled a hingetwisting motion. When this channel opened, the fingers subdomain moved away from the palm subdomain, and the thumb moved towards the palm with a vectorial bias in the direction of the NTP channel. Second, the NTP channel opened and closed more than once during the simulation. As observed for the nascent RNA channel, each cycle of closing included residues lining the channel (157-176 and 353-365) moving in a correlated manner with a vectorial bias in the direction of the nascent RNA channel. Opening of this channel was driven by the movement of the fingers subdomain (157-176) relative to the palm subdomain (353-365) in opposite directions. Interestingly, when the nascent RNA channel was open, the NTP channel was closed and vice versa. These motions appeared in PC1 for all picornavirus polymerases studied here (data not shown). Finally, the template channel formed by residues (17-27 and 108-116) also expanded and contracted. The opening and closing of this channel was not synchronized with either the nascent RNA or NTP channels.",

When two residues, Ser113 from the fingers and Asp412 from the thumb, located at opposite sides of the nascent RNA channel, were chosen as probes for the size of the channel, expansion and contraction of the channel was readily apparent (Figure 6c ). The distance between these two residues fluctuated over the entire duration of the simulation. The frequency of each distance observed during the production run of the simulation was evaluated ( Figure 6d ). From this analysis, it is clear that the channel can open by as much as 10 \u00c5 from the most-closed to the most-open conformations, permitting the open conformation to accommodate duplex RNA ( Figure 6a ). On average, the channel width was 19.8 \u00b1 2.6 \u00c5, which is 4.1 \u00c5 larger than observed in the crystal structure of the apo enzyme. Note that the channel width increased from 15.7 \u00c5 in the apo structure of PV RdRp to 18.6 \u00c5 upon formation of the elongation complex, 18 consistent with what we observed in our simulation. The residues affected most by the closed-to-open transition are: 19-24, 108-113, 120-132 and 165-170 in the fingers; 359-368 in the palm; and 407-412 and 440-450 in the thumb. The dynamics of the channel is also influenced by a hinge-twist motion of the fingers and thumb using residues P393 and G425 as pivots for the thumb ( Figure 6e ).",

The backbone dihedral angles of Gly64 assume a conformation that is disallowed for sidechains of all other amino acids. The Gly64 backbone permits stabilization of the amino terminus in the fingers subdomain by mutual hydrogen bonds between backbone atoms and stabilizes motif A by formation of hydrogen bonds with the backbone atoms of Ala239 and Leu241. Thus, it was thought that by changing Gly64 to Ser, these interactions would be altered, leading to misalignment of motif A, a motif known to contribute to incorporation fidelity. 41 However, the X-ray crystal structure of G64S PV RdRp 23 superimposed with WT PV RdRp with <0.3 \u00c5 RMSD.

In order to scrutinize the trajectory, we calculated B-factors for each residue and compared these to those obtained from the X-ray crystal structure data ( Figure 2) . Overall, the calculated B-factors were in good agreement with experimental values except for residues participating in crystal contacts. Until recently, there was no empirical information available on the dynamics of PV RdRp, or any RdRp for that matter. 25; 42 So, how does one really convince the bench biologist and biochemist that these computational data are functionally relevant? In the case of the picornaviruses, X-ray crystal structures are available for many RdRps in the family including CVB3, HRV16, and FMDV. 19; 20; 21 The biochemical parameters are nearly identical for the PV and FMDV RdRps, which are at the extremes of this group (30% identity on the amino acid level ( Figure S1 )). 10 The relevance of the algorithm as applied to PV RdRp could be put to the test by applying it to the other picornaviral RdRps. We reasoned that any dynamic features of functional significance should be conserved across the family. To our delight, we observed that the overall pattern of flexibility as a function of residues was conserved for all four RdRps evaluated (Figure 7 ). The conservation in dynamics even extended to correlated motions observed between sequence/structural motifs of functional importance (Figure 7) . Together, our results engender confidence in the utility of MD simulations and suggest conservation in the dynamics of the picornaviral RdRps. As discussed in more detail below, the possibility exists that the dynamics are conserved for function, thus providing additional evidence for a role of dynamics in enzyme catalysis 26; 43 and contributing another enzyme system to use to interrogate this property of enzymes that is likely essential.",

Conformational changes of this magnitude are often observed on the \u03bcs-ms timescale in enzymes and appear as ratelimiting events in the kinetic mechanism. 29; 44 In the case of the RdRp, it is clear that the fingers and thumb subdomains undergo conformational changes of this magnitude during the catalytic cycle. Therefore, it is possible that conformational states of the RdRp required for function are sampled on the ns timescale to enable conformational changes that occur on longer timescales.",

Ile residues are present in all three subdomains of this RdRp. In the palm subdomain, Ile could be used to probe the dynamics of motifs B, C, D and E. Order (s 2 ) parameters were used to probe dynamics on the ps-ns timescale. As observed here, the \u03d56 palm subdomain exhibited the least overall flexibility of the three subdomains. In addition, \u03d56 motifs D and E were most flexible and motif C was the least mobile on this timescale in the apo enzyme. These same residues exhibiting dynamics on the ps-ns timescale also exhibited dynamics on the timescale of catalysis. Our MD data on the picornaviral RdRps when considered in the context of the NMR data for the \u03d56 RdRp suggest conservation of the ps-ns timescale dynamics of functional elements across the RdRp superfamily and a potential linkage of these fast dynamics to catalysis.",

            "text": "Assembly of picornaviral RdRps with duplex RNA is slow. 47 It is known that the ratelimiting step for assembly is a conformational change of the enzyme. 47 The simulation revealed that the interaction of the fingertips with thumb that leads to a completely encircled active site is stable throughout the entire trajectory for all enzymes. This observation is consistent with the proposal that release of the fingertips from the thumb limits association with and/or dissociation from primed templates in vitro. 48 For PV RdRp, residues of the fingertips (28-42, 162-173), palm (214-219, 376-380) and thumb subdomains move as a unit ( Figure 3 ). However, these same residues of the fingertips and palm are negatively correlated ( Figure 5) . The thumb appears to be serving as a latch to constrain the complete opening of the channel for the nascent RNA duplex. Therefore, when or if the fingertipsthumb interactions are disrupted, one might expect a concerted opening of the channels for the nascent RNA duplex to enter. This observation applies to all of the picornaviral RdRps studied here (Figures 3 and S7 ). The Kao laboratory has shown that the RdRp from hepatitis C virus, an enzyme that also contains a completely encircled active site, is capable of using circular templates. 48 This observation has been interpreted to mean that fingertips-thumb interaction is broken during the course of assembly. Figure S9 ). For every RdRp, conformations of the nascent RNA channel larger than duplex RNA (20 \u00c5) were also sampled ( Figure S9 ). Of note, differences in the extent of expansion are also observed in complexes of PV and FMDV RdRps with nucleic acid. 18; 49 This \"hyper-expansion\" suggests that translocation can proceed by using a passive mechanism without the need to actively disengage the RdRp from its interactions with the major and minor groove of the nascent RNA duplex. The \"Brownian\" nature of polymerase translocation has been suggested by others. 50 Another interesting feature of the opening and closing of the nascent RNA duplex channel was that these motions were correlated with the opening and closing of the NTP channel (Figure 4c ). When the RNA channel was open, the NTP channel was closed and vice versa. Of note, motions of residues lining the NTP channel were biased in the direction of the nascent RNA channel (Figure 4c) . Given that the solvent and solutes flow through these channels, it is possible that these motions serve to pump reactants and products in and out of the active site. Closing of the NTP channel would force its contents into the nascent RNA channel and perhaps force its opening. Closing of the nascent RNA channel may also facilitate release of unincorporated NTP or PP i out of the active site through the NTP channel. The motions for the nascent RNA channel are more complex than the NTP channel. Therefore, a directional bias is not as obvious. Such an anti-correlated relationship between the nascent RNA duplex channel and the NTP channel has never been discussed. However, examination of RdRp crystal structures supports this conclusion. The best example is provided by the rabbit hemorrhagic disease virus (RHDV) RdRp in which an open and closed state of the nascent RNA duplex channel was present in the crystal. 51 When the nascent RNA duplex channel is open, the NTP channel is closed and vice versa.",

It is well known that motifs A, D and F contribute to interactions with incoming nucleotide that dictate both ground-state binding and isomerization events that lead to a catalytically competent complex. 41; 52 In contrast, motif B plays an indirect role in selection of rNTP by forming a hydrogen bond with Asp238, motif C and the portion of motif A containing Asp233 serve as ligands for the Mg 2+ ions required for catalysis and substantial changes in the positions of these motifs have never been noted when crystal structures of different complexes have been evaluated.

The reduced flexibility of the catalytic core will limit conformational sampling of the core that may be necessary to achieve catalytic competence. Perhaps, this reduced flexibility would affect the incorrect more than the correct nucleotides, hence increasing fidelity. The observations made here suggest two interesting lines of experimental investigation. Clearly, rigidification of the catalytic core is caused by propagation of the restricted motion of the G64S backbone. Dissemination of the reduced flexibility is mediated by an interacting (allosteric) network of amino acids, including but not limited to those shown in Figure 8d . It may be possible to suppress the effects of G64S by introducing glycine residues in the vicinity of the site of interaction between Gly64 and motif A. Alternatively, it may be possible to prevent dissemination of the effects of the G64S substitution to motifs F and D by introducing \"functionally compensatory\" substitutions at various positions on the allosteric pathway. In addition, if a specific distance is required for interactions in the active site that lead to catalytic competence, this state will be sampled less often given the more expanded nature of the catalytic site. The effect of the reduced sampling could be more severe for incorrect nucleotide incorporation than for correct incorporation, leading to the higher fidelity phenotype.",

At the extremes were the RdRps from PV and FMDV whose primary structures are only 30% identical. The pattern of dynamics observed for all RdRps was conserved and was in good agreement with empirical data on the dynamics of a phage RdRp. The congruence of so much computational and empirical data lend credence to the use of MD simulation for evaluation of RdRp dynamics and lead us to conclude that RdRp dynamics co-evolve with the RdRp tertiary structure. The major contributors to the motions on the nanosecond timescale were conserved structural regions required for function. Motions involved in identical function were correlated regardless of location in the structure. Changing a single amino acid residue of PV RdRp remote from the catalytic site that increases polymerase fidelity causes a global change in the observed dynamics of this derivative that extends to the active site. We conclude that RdRp dynamics are governed by long-range networks of interacting residues that have evolved for function, including polymerase fidelity. This groundwork sets the stage for elucidation of the dynamics-function relationships of this important class of enzymes and exploration of RdRp dynamics as a tractable target for development of antivirals and attenuated viruses.",

First, the coordinates of the simulated system were relaxed to remove any steric clashes between the atoms of proteins, waters and ions. This was carried out in multiple steps using SANDER: (1) short energy minimization of waters and ions only. (2) Short constraints dynamics under conditions of constant pressure and temperature (NPT ensemble) for 100 ps. Only the atoms of waters and ions were allowed to move while constraining the protein atoms using a force constant of 500 kcal/mol \u00c5 2 . (3) Energy minimization of the protein side chains in addition to the waters and ions. (4) Short constraints dynamics run similar to step 2 but allowing the side chain atoms in addition to the waters and ions to move. (5) All atoms of the entire system were energy minimized applying convergence criteria for the energy gradient DRMS (the root-mean-square of the cartesian elements of the gradient) of 0.1 kcal/mol \u00c5. Subsequently, the system was slowly heated to 300 K over a period of 150 ps under conditions of constant volume and temperature (NVT ensemble) and applying a Berndsen thermostat 59 . This was followed by a 200 ps NVT dynamics before switching to NPT dynamics for another 150 ps applying Berndsen's method 59 with temperature and pressure coupling constants of 1 ps (weak-coupling). Finally, the NPT dynamics was continued for the remainder of the MD simulation utilizing the parallel version of PMEMD in AMBER10. Total simulation times for the different systems were: 25 (PV wild-type and G64S derivative), 20 (FMDV), and 14 ns (CVB3 and HRV16) . Snapshots of the MD trajectories were retained every 1 ps for analysis. The first 2 (PV), 3 (G64S) or 4 ns (CVB3, HRV16, FMDV) were considered as equilibration times and discarded from analysis.

Prior to calculation, the snapshots were superimposed onto the minimized starting structure using the backbone atoms of (a) the palm or (b) the thumb. High per-residue RMSD values for regions outside the subdomain employed for the superimposition indicates substantial conformational changes of the PV RdRp structure during simulation. In panel B segments of low per-residue RMSD values in regions other than the thumb subdomain are highlighted with short colored bars The low per-residue RMSD values suggests that residues of the highlighted regions move concertedly with residues of the thumb subdomain. (c) The residues highlighted in panel B are shown on the PV RdRP structure. These residues are involved in direct interactions with the thumb. (a) The relative displacements of C\u03b1 atoms observed in the sum of the first six principal components (modes) are plotted for each residue. Peaks correspond to regions contributing to the major motions observed during the MD simulations. The structure has been divided into seven segments (S1-S7). The fingers subdomain is shaded purple, the palm subdomain is shaded light grey, and the thumb subdomain is shaded orange. The conserved motifs A-G are indicated. Other regions of PV RdRp known to have functional significance have been labeled I-III. (b) PV RdRp structure rendered as a tube to indicate flexibility and shown in two views: (left) looking through the template-nascent RNA-duplex channel, and (right) looking through the NTP channel. The radius of the tube indicates the magnitude of the relative displacement shown in panel A. Each segment has a unique color. Only segments S1, S3, S4, S6 and S7 are shown. Interestingly, highly dynamic regions are located around the nascent RNA duplex and NTP channels. (c) The motion content of PC1, the largest mode of PCA, is visualized in two views that show the PV RdRp from the front (left) and the back (right). The starting structure of PV RdRp is depicted as wires with subdomains colored differently: blue (fingers), grey (palm), and red (thumb). The green \"porcupine needles\" indicate the direction of displacements of motions based on PC1; the size of the needle is proportional to the displacement. From the directions of displacement vectors represented by the needles, expansion and contraction of the RNA and NTP channels can be indicated; interestingly, when the template-nascent RNA duplex channel is open the NTP channel is closed and vice versa. (d) Structural variation among multiple crystal structures of PV RdRp is represented by RMSD for each residue in PV RdRp, calculated from superimposed crystallographic structures (PDB codes 1RA6, 1RA7, 2IM0, 2IM1, 2IM2, 2IM3, 2ILY, and 2ILZ). The structures were superimposed using C\u03b1 atoms of motifs B and C; superimposition was performed using Chimera. Residues that demonstrate large structural variations, indicated by high RMSD values, are implied to be flexible. Structural variations among different crystal structures qualitatively showed similar pattern to that displayed in (a) for residues in segments S1-S5. The smaller amount of variability of residues in segment S6 could be a result of using residues within this segment for superimposition. Differences between experimental data and simulation observed for residues in segment S7 are attributable to the crystal packing effect where mobility of these residues is masked inside crystals; such an effect is absent from simulation.",

            "text": "The dynamic cross-correlation map (DCCM), which measures the correlation between the displacements of C\u03b1 atoms, calculated from simulations of RdRps from PV (a), CVB3 (b), HRV16 (c), and FMDV (d) are shown. For each enzyme, the calculated matrix whose elements are the pairwise correlation scores between its residues is visualized as a colored map. The correlation scores are encoded with a color gradient from \u22121 (blue, completely anti-correlated) to +1 (red, completely correlated). The conserved structural motifs are marked with grey bars. Residues that appeared flexible in PCA of PV RdRp (see Fig. 4a ) are shown to be strongly correlated. Both positive and negative correlations have implications regarding polymerase functions as discussed in the text. The figure was prepared using MATLAB 7.6. (a) The relative displacements of C\u03b1 atoms observed in the sum of the first six principal components (modes) are plotted for each residue. Peaks correspond to regions contributing to the major motions observed during the MD simulations. The structure has been divided into seven segments (S1-S7). The fingers subdomain is shaded purple, the palm subdomain is shaded light grey, and the thumb subdomain is shaded orange. The conserved motifs A-G are indicated. Other regions of PV RdRp known to have functional significance have been labeled I-III. Dynamic regions under the peaks across the different polymerases show a striking similarity; the observed dynamic patterns are largely conserved. Major peaks in the different segments (S1-S7) observed in PV are also observed at equivalent positions for the other three RdRps. Nonetheless, differences in relative displacements of motifs A and E as well as of the region spanning residues 43-55 in the fingers are noted. Local sequence and structural variations might account for differences in the observed dynamics. The plot of PV RdRp, shown previously in Figure 4 , is included for comparison with the other RdRps. (b) The average relative displacement calculated for the conserved motifs A-G and functional regions I-III of each RdRp is shown. The average was calculated by using the relative displacement of all residues constituting the motif as defined in Table S1 . The differences between relative displacements of WT and G64S are shown. Positive differences (green bars) indicate regions in G64S that are more flexible than WT; as negative differences (red bars) indicate less flexible regions. (c) Mapping of the differences between G64S and WT onto the structure of the WT PV RdRp; the differences are shown as color gradients of green (positive) and red (negative); the structure is rendered as a tube whose radius indicate the magnitude of the difference (large radius corresponds to regions that are more flexible in G64S and small radius corresponds to regions that are less flexible compared to WT. (d) Structural perturbations caused by the G64S substitution. The average structures for WT (black) and G64S (grey) are shown. Panel I shows changes from position 64to the N-terminal residues (8) (9) (10) (11) (12) (13) (14) (15) and motif F (162-172). Panel II shows changes in motifs D (353-362). The hydrogen bonding network involving residues Gly1, Gly64, A239, and Leu241 remains in both enzymes. (e) The dynamic cross-correlation map (DCCM) calculated for G64SPV RdRp as done for the WT enzymes in Figure 5 . (f) Opening and closing of the template-nascent RNA duplex channel. The frequency distribution for the C\u03b1-C\u03b1 distance of Ser113 (fingers) and Asp412 (thumb) in G64S (grey curve) is shown. The black curve corresponds to the WT and is shown for comparison. A shift to the more open conformations is observed in G64S relative to the WT. The residues shown in red boldfaced type are completely conserved among RdRPs; those residues representing signatures of the conserved sequence motifs are shown in black boldfaced type and underlined. 61",
