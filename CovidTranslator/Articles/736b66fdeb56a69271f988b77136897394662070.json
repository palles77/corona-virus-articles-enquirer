            "text": "A number of studies on the genomic RNAs of coronaviruses have been reported. The genome of avian infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) is a single single-stranded molecule of high mol. wt [l-4] , which is prone to degradation into smaller molecules [ 1, 5] . There is some disagreement concerning its mol. wt with estimates varying from 9.0 X lo6 [l] to 5.6 X lo6 [4] . Similar studies on the human coronavirus (HCV) genome have also shown it to be a large molecule of mol. wt varying from 6.1 X lo6 for strain OC43 [6] to 5.8 X IO6 for strain 2298 [7] . Again, as with IBV, the HCV genome is prone to degradation [6, 7] . The genomes of two porcine coronaviruses, transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) and haemagglutinating encephalomyelitis virus (HEV), have also been shown to be large single single-stranded RNA molecules of about 60 S that dissociate into 35 S and 4 S material on heating above 60\u00b0C [8] ~ Coronavirus genomes possess certain mRNA characteristics. Polyadenylic acid [poly(A)] sequences are found in the genomes of IBV [2, 4, 9] and HCV [7,10] at or near their 3'-termini [7] . Furthermore, the genome of IBV has been shown to be infectious [4, 9] and no detectable virion transcriptase has been identified associated with IBV [4] or HCV [lo] particles.",

Substantially more of the genomic RNA may be polyadenylated, but may not be able to bind to oligo(dT)-cellulose columns. This may be because the genomic RNAs are very large and some of them take up conformations during chromatography that prevent them from binding to the oligo(dT)-cellulose, or because the poly(A) content of the molecules is very heterogeneous and many of the molecules have poly(A) tracts that are too short to readily bind to the columns.

This and previous data [3, 4, 7, 9, 10] , together with data showing that these genomes are infectious [4, 9] and that there is no virion transcriptase [4, 10] , strongly suggest that the coronavirus genome is of positive polarity. These results are important for a number of reasons. Firstly, they confirm and extend reports on the genomes of IBV and HCV concerning their structure and polarity. Secondly, they extend our knowledge to include the structure of the genome of another coronavirus, MHV. Finally, the results show a much greater similarity between coronavirus genomes than has been previously reported. Previous discrepancies may be due in part to the varying methods used for the analysis of the genomic RNAs in different laboratories.",
