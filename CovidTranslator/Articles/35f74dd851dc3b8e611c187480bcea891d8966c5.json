            "text": "Serum biomarkers associated with Fasciola hepatica infection of Corriedale sheep were analysed during the first 12 weeks of infection using surface-enhanced laser desorption ionisation time of flight mass spectrometry (SELDI-TOF MS). In the discovery phase of analysis, pooled sera collected at week 0 and at each week p.i. to week 12 were fractionated by anion-exchange chromatography and the protein mass fingerprints obtained in individual fractions were in the M/z range 1.5-150 kDa. A total of 2302 protein clusters (peaks) were identified that varied between time-points following infection with peaks increasing or decreasing in intensity, or showing transient variation in intensity, during the 12 weeks of parasite challenge. In the validation phase, candidate biomarkers in sera of individual sheep at weeks 3 and 9 p.i. were analysed, identifying 100 protein peaks, many of which are small peptides <10 kDa in size: 54% of these peaks were up-regulated in intensity at week 3 or 9 p.i. Twenty-six biomarkers were chosen for further study, ranging in size from 1832 to 89,823 Da: six biomarkers were up-regulated at weeks 3 and 9 p.i., 16 biomarkers were up-regulated only at week 9 p.i. and four biomarkers were down-regulated at week 9 p.i. Two biomarkers up-regulated at week 9 were identified as transferrin (77.2 kDa) and Apolipoprotein A-IV (44.3 kDa), respectively. The results show that the interaction between the host and F. hepatica is complex, with changes in biomarker patterns beginning within 3 weeks of infection and either persisting to weeks 9-12 or showing transient changes during infection. Identification of biomarkers expressed during ovine fasciolosis may provide insights into mechanisms of pathogenesis and immunity to Fasciola and may assist in the rational development and delivery of vaccines. \u00d3",

            "text": "Fasciolosis is a disease affecting sheep, cattle and humans caused by Fasciola hepatica in temperate climates and Fasciola gigantica in the tropics. It is estimated that 250 million sheep, 350 million cattle and 180 million humans worldwide are at risk of infection, with production losses of over USD 3 billion per year (Hillyer and Apt, 1997; Mas-Coma et al., 1999 , 2005 Spithill et al., 1999) . Fasciola spp. parasites have complex interactions with their host. The initial phase of the disease includes parasite excystment in the small intestine and migration to the liver where subsequent movement and feeding in the liver parenchyma causes extensive tissue inflammation and necrosis. This acute phase of disease occurs during the first 5 weeks of infection in sheep and, at high worm burdens, can cause death. Sexually mature parasites migrate to the bile ducts of sheep at about 8-10 weeks after infection, where they feed on the blood and duct mucosa of the host. This chronic phase is characterised by liver fibrosis, anaemia and subsequent production losses.",

User-detected peaks below threshold were deleted and all first-pass peaks were preserved. Clusters were created within 0.3% of M/z for each peak detected in the first pass. The clusters were completed by adding peaks with a S/N ratio of 2 and two times the valley depth. When no peaks were detected, the peak intensity was estimated at the centre of the cluster. In the discovery study, peaks were screened for potential biomarkers using the following criteria: difference in intensity must be observed in two or more consecutive weeks compared with the control sample and peaks must show at least a 2-fold increase in intensity (preferably a difference of presence/absence of intensity). The peaks were inspected to determine if they were multi-charged entities.

The data were clustered to assist visualisation of patterns of variation between the different time-points. Four broad patterns of variation in peak intensity are evident: peaks that are up-or down-regulated early or late p.i., with 54% of the markers being up-regulated (Supplementary Table 1 ). Relative to week 0 sera, eight peaks were significantly different only at week 3 p.i., 79 peaks different only at week 9 p.i. and 13 peaks were different at weeks 3 and 9 p.i. in the two independent analyses. Note that the actual number of unique markers may be less than 100 since a mass spectrum usually contains more peaks than the number of different molecular species in the sample, due to the fact that molecules form complexes or carry multiple charges and appear as several peaks in the spectrum (Dijkstra et al., 2007) . These statistically significant peaks are summarised in Supplementary Table 1 . Many of the 100 markers are <10 kDa in size (Supplementary Table 1) .",

ROC values represent the joint values of the true positive ratio (sensitivity) and the false positive ratio (1-specificity) for the relative intensity of the biomarker. ROC area values close to 1 or 0 indicate that the test has high sensitivity and specificity, whereas a value close to 0.5 indicates the test cannot reliably distinguish between positive and negative cases. Biomarkers with ROC area values nearing 1 are positively associated with infection (up-regulated), whereas values nearing 0 are negatively associated with infection (down-regulated).

The analysis of pooled sera provided a broad snapshot of the variation in peak intensity during infection, with peaks increasing or decreasing in intensity, or showing transient variation in intensity, during the 12 weeks of parasite challenge. It is clear that dramatic changes occur in the sheep serum proteome during fasciolosis with at least 2302 clusters shown to vary in peak intensity during infection. The two particularly informative time-points identified for further study (weeks 3 and 9 p.i.) corresponded to the migration of the parasite in the liver parenchyma and establishment in the bile ducts, respectively. From the 2302 clusters identified, 100 peaks (4.3%) in the size range 1604-145,945 Da showed significant differences in intensity in individual sera at weeks 3 and/or 9 p.i. relative to week 0 sera, with a similar number of peaks being up-regulated or down-regulated. Seventy-nine peaks showed differences in intensity only at week 9 p.i. (Fig. 2; Supplementary Table 1 ). This bias of peaks towards later time-points may reflect the impact on the serum proteome of the larger adult parasite biomass at week 9 p.i. relative to the much smaller biomass of immature parasites at week 3 p.i.",

In order to concentrate our resources on biomarkers that are most likely to be biologically significant, a two-step approach was used. This study had the benefit of having serial bleeds from eight sheep during the course of infection so that the inherent sheep-to-sheep variation in serum protein levels was theoretically minimised. The initial discovery phase of the study allowed us to target peaks that would be of biological relevance because they appeared in pooled sera over several consecutive weeks of infection. The second step was to statistically validate these differences. Using the conditions that had been determined in the discovery phase, the individual sheep sera at weeks 0, 3 and 9 p.i. were fractionated and analysed. This validated the biomarkers that differed significantly between timepoints and verified that the differences observed in the discovery phase were not attributable to large variations in sera from a few sheep in the group. A second independent fractionation and randomized binding experiment confirmed these results and also controlled for day-to-day differences in manipulations using the SELDI-TOF MS platform. The biomarkers were only considered to be validated if the cluster was calculated as statistically significant in both data sets. Fig. 9 . Western blot analysis of Apo A-IV levels in sheep. (a) Western blot using anti-human Apo A-IV of 2 ll of pooled sera from weeks 0, 2, 4, 6, 9 and 12 p.i. with 1/50,000 secondary antibody. (b) Western blot of 2 ll of individual sera from weeks 0 and 9 p.i. with 1/25,000 secondary antibody. Data is presented in rank order of increasing worm numbers. From the 26 biomarkers chosen for study, the validation results showed that 22 biomarkers increased in intensity and four biomarkers decreased in intensity over the first 9 weeks of infection. These biomarkers cover a wide size range (1832-89,741 Da) with many biomarkers being less than 10 kDa, suggesting that small peptides are a rich source of relevant biomarkers using the SELDI-TOF MS approach as noted earlier in human sera (Hortin, 2006) . These results show that the interaction between the host and F. hepatica is complex, with significant changes in biomarker patterns beginning within 3 weeks of infection, as observed with the 36.2 kDa biomarker. The analysis of pooled sera suggests that biomarker patterns can change within 2 weeks of infection (see data for the pH 9 fraction, Supplementary Fig. 1 ). This complexity reflects the nature of the migration path of the parasite from the gut, through the intestinal wall, peritoneum, liver parenchyma and bile duct wall, with final residence within the bile ducts. We would anticipate different biomarkers to be generated in different host tissues or produced by different developmental stages of the parasite.",

Given the limited sequence database information for sheep and F. hepatica, biomarker identities derived from MS/MS analysis were confirmed using antibody reagents against specific proteins. One biomarker at 77.2 kDa was identified as transferrin which increased in intensity during the biliary phase of infection at week 9 p.i. The increase in the 77.2 kDa transferrin marker at week 9 p.i. detected by SELDI-TOF MS analysis, from being almost absent at week 0 p.i., is not reflected in the Western blot results where a more modest change was observed. This weak signal at week 0 p.i. in the SELDI-TOF MS spectra appears to be an artefact attributed to peak suppression by the neighbouring 73.2 kDa peak, the doublecharge peak of IgG (146 kDa) (Fig. 7) . As observed in Supplementary Table 1, the 146 and 73.2 kDa peaks decrease at week 9 p.i. (ROC = 0.016, ROC = 0.063/ 0.016, respectively). Suppression of the 77.2 kDa signal at week 0 p.i. in the SELDI analysis may account for the less marked difference in marker intensity observed in the transferrin Western blot analysis. Peak suppression in SELDI-TOF MS analysis by blood components has been previously observed (van Breemen et al., 2006; Roche et al., 2006) and is a factor that must be carefully considered in interpretation of SELDI-TOF MS data.",

Fasciolosis, however, is characterised by both an acute (peritoneal and parenchymal phase) and a chronic (biliary) phase of disease. In a study of F. hepatica in sheep, with similar worm burdens to those present in our study (10-62 flukes/sheep), a loss of 9.3-23.6 ml of plasma per day was estimated and the onset of anaemia was associated with the entry of the flukes into the biliary system, which occurs at approxi-mately week 6-7 p.i. (Sinclair, 1972) . Accelerated erythropoiesis occurs in response to the developing anaemia during fasciolosis (Sinclair, 1972) and a significant negative correlation has previously been observed between the concentration of haemoglobin and serum transferrin in calves (Martinsson and Mollerberg, 1973) . Transferrin levels have also been shown to increase during iron deficiency in calves (Moser et al., 1994) . Thus, an increase in serum transferrin levels in response to induced anaemia in sheep during fasciolosis is consistent with these observations. The variation in relative transferrin levels between individual sheep at weeks 0 and 9 p.i. is consistent with data in cattle where transferrin concentrations have been shown to vary over a 3-to 6-fold range under different physiological conditions but the basis for this variation is not clear (Moser et al., 1994; McNair et al., 1998) .",

Apo A-IV is a 46 kDa glycoprotein and one of the minor apolipoproteins in triglyceride-rich apo B-containing lipoproteins (chylomicron, very low density proteins [VLDL] ) and in Apo A-I containing lipoproteins (HDL) in blood: it is synthesised in the small intestine in humans and the liver and small intestine in rodents (Stan et al., 2003; Takahashi et al., 2004) . In cattle, Apo A-IV levels vary during lactation and decrease during fasting (Takahashi et al., 2004) ; variations in the intralumenal availability of bile acids may affect the regulation of Apo A-IV synthesis (Stan et al., 2003) . Apo A-IV may play a role in the control of food consumption and gastric acid secretion, as well as protection against lipoprotein oxidation (Stan et al., 2003) . The regulation of Apo A-IV levels is complex and the basis for the apparent up-regulation of serum Apo A-IV during fasciolosis remains to be determined but may be related to pathological changes in the liver and bile ducts accompanying fluke infection.",

This apparent discrepancy between the serum transferrin levels observed in our study and bile transferrin levels may be related to iron homeostasis during fasciolosis. The host may alter transferrin distribution in bile to enhance iron uptake from plasma. Of the other three host bile biomarkers, we observed serum biomarkers which may correspond to chain A of the trypsin inhibitor complex (26,169 Da) and regucalcin (31, 152, 32, 091, 32, 234 Da) since their pattern of expression, apparent M r and elution profile correspond with the expression, M r and pI of the bile proteins (Supplementary Table 2 ). Work is in progress to confirm these observations. No serum biomarker corresponded to Enolase 1. We did not detect a serum biomarker corresponding to the main up-regulated parasite biomarker in bile, isotypes of F. hepatica cathepsin L (observed M r 23,588-24,497 Da, pI 4.87-6.50) (Morphew et al., 2007) .

(Sexton et al., 1990) . Sheep AST exists as two isoforms of 87.1 kDa (pI of 9.14) (Orlacchio et al., 1979) and 86-88.9 kDa (Campos-Cavieres and Munn, 1973) . The up-regulated biomarkers at 88.0 and 89.7 kDa in the pH 9 fraction observed in week 9 sera may represent AST ( Fig. 2c and Table 2 ). Bovine GLDH is 55.4 kDa (pI 6.77) (Moon and Smith, 1973 ) and a 55.0 kDa up-regulated biomarker was observed in the organic wash fraction in week 9 p.i. sera (Fig. 2c , and Table 2 ). Gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT) (EC 2.3.2.2) is a 92 kDa serum biomarker of bile duct damage in sheep (Zelazo and Orlowski, 1976; Ferre et al., 1994 ) but we did not observe a biomarker of this size in serum. Work is in progress to confirm these identities.",

            "text": "We were interested in identifying a biomarker that could be diagnostic of early infection and whether the intensity of any biomarker was correlated with worm burden, such that a biomarker may act as a marker of intensity of infection. We identified 13 biomarkers significantly up-regulated and another seven biomarkers whose intensity was significantly down-regulated, at week 3 p.i. (Supplementary Table 1) . Several markers were up-regulated in all sheep at week 3, e.g. markers at 13,775 Da, 18,113 Da (Fig. 2b , organic fraction) and 74,586 Da (Fig. 2c, organic fraction) . Down-regulated markers were observed at 32,091 Da and 32,234 Da (Fig. 2c, organic fraction) . Although the intensity of these biomarkers changes early p.i., further work is required to determine if these biomarkers are specific for fasciolosis. This will require comparative analysis of sera from other parasite infections of sheep and we are attempting such studies. Other changes were observed in all sheep at week 9 such as up-regulated markers at 63,491 Da, 102,201 Da (Fig. 2c, organic fraction) and down-regulated markers at 5022 Da (Fig. 2a , organic fraction), 31,152 Da, 32,091 Da and 97,688 Da (Fig. 2c , organic fraction). A regression analysis comparing biomarker intensity and worm burdens was performed on all 100 biomarkers but no significant correlations were observed in either data set (data not shown). This may reflect the small sample size in our study as well as the relatively low worm burden observed. Biomarkers of intensity of fluke infection may be more easily identified in sera from sheep carrying a larger worm burden since the impact of such an infection on the serum proteome would be more dramatic.",

This study described a serum biomarker pattern associated with human African trypanosome infections but none of the putative biomarkers were identified (Papadopoulos et al., 2004) . Recent work has also applied this technology to profile human sera from Chagas disease patients to identify five biomarkers that are diagnostic for this disease (Ndao et al., unpublished data) . In this case several proteolytic fragments of proteins were found to be useful in various diagnostic algorithms for Trypanosoma cruzi infection, suggesting that analysis of peptides derived from intact proteins will prove to be a rich source of diagnostic information. It is possible that some biomarkers we observed, particularly those smaller than 10 kDa, may represent fragments of larger proteins. These results demonstrate that protein profiling of parasite infection sera may reveal new insights into how parasites and hosts interact.",

            "text": "Future work will involve the further identification of the biomarkers validated herein to gain a fuller understanding of the effect of fasciolosis on the serum proteome. Identification of Fasciola and sheep biomarkers has proven to be difficult, mainly because of the low levels of many markers (which complicates purification), the sparseness of completely annotated Fasciola and sheep genome sequences and the lack of homologous antibody reagents. A sheep genome project is in progress (http://www.sheephapmap. org/) and cDNAs from F. hepatica are being generated (http://www.sanger.ac.uk/Projects/Helminths/). A focus on the less abundant proteins present in the sheep serum proteome is possible by depletion of the higher abundance proteins using the human ProteomeLab IgY-12 depletion system (Beckman Coulter; Roche et al., 2006) which is also effective at binding abundant sheep proteins (Rioux et al., unpublished data) . This may allow us to further identify proteins involved in pathology and host immune responsiveness, such as biomarkers of acquired resistance to Fasciola or biomarkers associated with immunosuppression, which is a feature of fasciolosis (reviewed in Piedrafita et al., 2004) . It is notable that certain sheep breeds can acquire resistance to F. gigantica but not F. hepatica. However, the precise nature of the responses determining acquired resistance to fluke infection is not known (Piedrafita et al., 2004) . Indonesian sheep acquire resistance to F. gigantica within 2-4 weeks of infection and recent results suggest that a superoxide-mediated IgG-dependent effector response mediated by monocytes/macrophages and eosinophils from these sheep is effective at killing juvenile F. gigantica in vitro (Piedrafita et al., 2007) . A biomarker analysis of Indonesian sheep sera within 4 weeks of infection may reveal peptides/proteins whose expression correlates with acquired resistance, such as proteins involved in macrophage/eosinophil activation. The identification of such functional biomarkers will provide insights into host resistance pathways which may assist the design of rational delivery systems to improve the efficacy of vaccines for fasciolosis (Hillyer, 2005) .",
