            "text": "RNA interference (RNAi) is a double-stranded RNA (dsRNA)-triggered mechanism for suppressing gene expression, which is conserved in evolution and has emerged as a powerful tool to study gene function. Rotaviruses, the leading cause of severe diarrhea in young children, are formed by three concentric layers of protein, and a genome composed of 11 segments of dsRNA. Here, we show that the RNAi machinery can be triggered to silence rotavirus gene expression by sequence-specific short interfering RNAs (siRNAs). RNAi is also useful for the study of the virus-cell interactions, through the silencing of cellular genes that are potentially important for the replication of the virus. Interestingly, while the translation of mRNAs is readily stopped by the RNAi machinery, the viral transcripts involved in virus genome replication do not seem to be susceptible to RNAi. Since gene silencing by RNAi is very efficient and specific, this system could become a novel therapeutic approach for rotavirus and other virus infections, once efficient methods for in vivo delivery of siRNAs are developed. Although the use of RNAi as an antiviral therapeutic tool remains to be demonstrated, there is no doubt that this technology will influence drastically the way postgenomic virus research is conducted.",

Rotaviruses are the leading etiologic agent of severe diarrheal disease in infants and young children worldwide. In developed countries, rotaviruses have been detected in 30-50% of infants hospitalized with acute diarrhea. In less developed countries, rotaviruses are also the most frequently detected pathogen in children with severe gastroenteritis. While the mortality from rotavirus disease in developed countries is very low, rotavirus causes an estimated 500,000-600,000 deaths each year (Parashar and Glass, 2003) . The frequency of rotavirus infection is remarkably similar in both settings. Since rotaviruses play such an important role in severe dehydrating gastroenteritis, and because even advanced levels of hygiene seem unable to con-trol the spread of rotavirus infections, there is an urgent need to develop effective vaccination and therapeutic strategies. Fundamental to these developments is a basic understanding of the molecular mechanisms by which rotaviruses interact with their host cell.",

The total genomic size is about 18,500 bp. The innermost layer of the virion is formed by 120 molecules of protein VP2, which surrounds the viral genome. Twelve copies each of VP1, the RNA polymerase, and VP3, a guanylyltransferase and methylase, constitute the core of the virus. The addition of 260 trimers of VP6 on top of the VP2 layer produces double-layered particles (DLPs). The outermost layer, characteristic of triple-layered particles (TLPs), is composed of two proteins, VP4 and VP7. The smooth external surface of the virus is made up of 780 copies of glycoprotein VP7, organized as trimers, while 60 spike-like structures, formed by dimers of VP4, extend about 12 nm from the VP7 surface. The mature virus particle is approximately 100 nm in diameter and contains 132 porous channels, which allow the influx of compounds in aqueous solution to the inside of the capsid and the efflux of newly formed mRNAs (Pesavento et al., 2003) .",

The role of VP7 during the initial interactions of the virus with the cell is less clear, although it has been recently shown that VP7 interacts with cell surface molecules at a step subsequent to the initial attachment of the virus through the spike protein (Graham et al., 2003; Z\u00e1rate et al., 2002) . After the virus attaches to the cell surface, it has to penetrate the plasma membrane to productively infect the cell. This penetration is increased by, and most probably dependent on, trypsin treatment of the virus that results in the specific cleavage of VP4 to polypeptides VP8 and VP5. The cleavage of VP4 does not affect cell binding and is rather associated with the entry of the virus into the cell (Arias et al., 2001; Estes, 2001) .",

Once a critical mass of viral proteins is accumulated into structures known as viroplasms, core replication intermediate (RI) particles assemble. The synthesis of RNA(\u2212) has been proposed to occur concurrently with the packaging of RNA(+) into the core RIs, and is highly coordinated in such a way that packaging and replication lead to the formation of cores containing one copy of each of the 11 genome segments of dsRNA (Patton and Spencer, 2000) . In addition to the virus RNA polymerase, the non-structural proteins NSP2 and NSP5 are thought to be essential for the early steps of morphogenesis. All these processes lead to the production of transcriptionally active, dsRNA-containing double-layered RI particles. These particles are responsible for an enhanced second round of transcription, which results in a second wave of assembly of double-layered RI particles, which then bud through the membrane of the ER. During this budding, which is mediated by the interaction of the double-layered RIs with the ER membrane-associated rotavirus protein NSP4, the particles acquire a transient membrane envelope (Estes, 2001) . The transiently enveloped particles contain, in addition to NSP4, the virus surface proteins VP4 and VP7, as well as minor amounts of other non-structural proteins (Poruchynsky and Atkinson, 1991) . The lipid envelope is then removed by a largely unknown mechanism, to yield mature TLPs (Fig. 1) .",

            "text": "RNA interference (RNAi) has become a powerful and widely used tool for the analysis of gene functions. This evolutionarily conserved mechanism, triggered by double-stranded RNA (dsRNA), specifically suppresses gene expression by selectively degrading mRNAs matching the sequence of the dsRNA that triggered the response, without affecting the expression of other genes. During RNAi, long dsRNA molecules are processed into 21-25 bp RNAs known as short-interfering RNAs (siRNAs) that serve as guides for enzymatic cleavage of complementary RNAs, thus offering an exquisite mode to specifically knockdown the expression of a particular gene.",

In mammalian cells, dsRNA fragments longer than 30 bp induce components of the interferon response, including the dsRNA-dependent protein kinase (PKR), the 2 ,5 -oligoadenylate synthetase (OAS) and the non-specific RNAse L (Katze et al., 2002) . These factors mediate a generalized inhibition of gene expression through the non-specific shutdown of protein synthesis and mRNA degradation, what eventually leads to cell apoptosis. The recent demonstration that synthetic 21-nt siRNA duplexes effectively inhibit mammalian endogenous gene expression in a sequence-specific manner without activating the nonspecific dsRNA responses (Caplen, 2002; Elbashir et al., 2001) offers great opportunities to use this pathway of gene silencing to study the function of mammalian virus genes.",

Similarly, the yield of progeny virus that resulted from an infection carried out in the presence of siRNA VP4 was reduced to 15-25% that of a control infection performed in the presence of an unrelated siRNA (homologous to the nuclear proteins laminA/C). The residual infectious virus produced in the presence of siRNA VP4 was mostly the result of virus replication in those cells that were not transfected with the siRNA, the transfection efficiency achieved being about 75%. As result of the inhibition of VP4 synthesis, non-infectious TLPs, lacking the VP4 protein (appearing as \"spike-less\" TLPs), were obtained (Dector et al., 2002) .",

            "text": "We have also addressed the question of the duration of an effective RNAi response in a rotavirus infection. For this, we transfected MA104 cells with either a siRNA to VP4 or to VP7, and then infected with rotavirus at different times post-transfection. The inhibition of the synthesis of both viral proteins could be achieved even when the cells were infected 7 days after transfection (shown up to day 5 in Fig. 2A) , with the consequence of a significant decrease on the yield of viral progeny (Fig. 2B ). The inhibitory effect could probably last even longer, however, after the fifth day cells in culture were notoriously damaged, even in the untransfected controls, so that it was difficult to have reproducible results at later times. Of interest, we consistently found that the highest inhibition was achieved when the cells were infected 72 h after transfection with the siRNA, suggesting that some of the elements of the RNAi response could be induced or activated by the presence of the siRNA, increasing their effective concentration inside the cell. Our observations are in agreement with other studies carried out with different viruses and different cell lines, where the RNAi effect was reported to last also about 5 days (Flores-Jasso et al., 2004; Ge et al., 2004; Kapadia et al., 2003) . It is not clear, however, whether this effect is due to the fact that the siRNAs are stable within the cells, or whether they are slowly released from the membrane-associated transfection mixture (Gitlin and Andino, 2003) . (7), or lamin A/C (C), and after 8 h the lipofectamine-siRNA mixture was removed and replaced by medium. At the indicated times (days post-transfection, d.p.t.), the cells were infected with rotavirus RRV at an MOI of 1 and 12 h post-infection (p.i.), the cells were harvested and processed for electrophoresis or infectivity assays. (A) Western blot stained with a rabbit polyclonal antibody to rotavirus TLPs. Arrows indicate the positions of VP4, VP6, and VP7. (B) The yield of progeny virus obtained after transfection with the siRNA to VP4 was determined by an immunoperoxidase assay, as described (Lizano et al., 1991) . Data are expressed as the percentage of the infectivity obtained when the cells were transfected with the control siRNA to lamin A/C. The results obtained in our work indicate that rotaviruses are sensitive to the RNAi response of the cell, as has been described for viruses belonging to other families, such as poliovirus, hepatitis B and C viruses, human immunodeficiency virus, respiratory syncytial virus, vesicular stomatitis virus, papillomavirus, herpes virus, influenza virus, dengue virus, and baculovirus, some of which are discussed in accompanying articles of this Issue (Adelman et al., 2002; Bitko and Barik, 2001; Capodici et al., 2002; Coburn and Cullen, 2002; Ge et al., 2003; Gitlin et al., 2002; Hall and Alexander, 2003; Hamasaki et al., 2003; Hu et al., 2002; Jacque et al., 2002; Jia and Sun, 2003; Jiang and Milner, 2002; Kapadia et al., 2003; Klein et al., 2003; Martinez et al., 2002; McCaffrey et al., 2003; Novina et al., 2002; Randall et al., 2003; Shlomai and Shaul, 2003; Valdes et al., 2003; Wilson et al., 2003) .",

            "text": "In a previous publication we described that the synthesis of a viral protein in MA104 cells lipofected with a siRNA specific for a viral protein 48-72 h prior to infection, was silenced in a sequence-specific manner (Dector et al., 2002, unpublished results) , suggesting that rotavirus infection cannot suppress the interfering process. However, since in those experiments the siRNA was added to the cells before virus infection, we reasoned that for a virus-encoded suppressor of RNAi, there might have not been enough time for its synthesis before the RNAi response (triggered by the siRNA) inhibited the virus replication. To address this issue, we evaluated the capacity of the RNAi response to silence rotavirus gene expression when the siRNAs were transfected into cells after infection with the virus. We found that the synthesis of VP4 was silenced even when the siRNA VP4 was added at 4 h post-infection (p.i.), a time point at which viral protein synthesis is already predominant in the infected cells (Fig. 3) . These results suggest that the RNAi machinery is active and effective even in the presence of previously synthesized rotaviral proteins, and thus that rotaviruses do not encode an RNAi suppressor. However, in order to formally demonstrate that rotaviruses do not code for suppressors of RNAi, further experiments need to be done. For example, it is necessary to determine if rotavirus infection could block an RNAi response triggered by short hairpin RNAs, which have been shown to specifically induce the RNAi system. These short hairpin RNAs are substrates for the cellular enzyme Dicer (Brummelkamp et al., 2002) , which is responsible for processing long dsRNA molecules into siRNAs. Also, it could be helpful to assay candidate viral proteins as RNAi suppressors in a heterologous system, like plants. With such an approach, it was recently reported that the 3 protein of reovirus, which is a dsRNA binding protein, has a supressor activity that blocks the synthesis of GFP in an assay for suppressor silencing in tobacco plants (Lichner et al., 2003; Roth et al., 2004) .",

Since the genome of these viruses functions as mRNA to direct the synthesis of precursor polyproteins which are post-translationally cleaved to yield the individual viral polypeptides, any siRNA directed against the mRNA (represented by either the genomic RNA, or the subgenomic mRNAs in some virus families) would result in a decreased synthesis of the entire polyprotein, preventing the study of the role of individual polypeptides. In this regard, it is of interest that in viruses with a non-segmented, negative strand RNA genome, like respiratory syncytial virus, vesicular stomatitis virus, and human parainfluenza virus, the genomic RNA as well as the replication intermediate RNA(+), are protected from the action of RNAi, while only the mR-NAs are degraded (Barik, 2004; Bitko and Barik, 2001) . This also seems to be the case for influenza A viruses which have a genome composed of eight single-stranded RNA segments of negative polarity (Ge et al., 2003) . The functions of proteins of DNA viruses and retroviruses, whose genome is in general transcribed into monocistronic mRNAs, is also amenable to dissection by RNAi, as has been shown for bac-ulovirus, human immunodeficiency virus, and retroviruses in this issue, and for herpes virus, papillomavirus and the hepatitis delta agent (Chang and Taylor, 2003; Hall and Alexander, 2003; Jia and Sun, 2003) .",

However, after this point the morphogenesis of the virus should be impaired. In agreement with this hypothesis, we have shown that the silencing of the VP4 gene allowed the synthesis of abundant double-layered RIs, that efficiently bud through the ER membrane, eventually loosing the transient lipid membrane and incorporating the outer protein layer formed by VP7, to form spike-less TLPs. Of interest, the VP7 outer layer assembled on the spike-less TLPs was found by cryoelectron microscopy to have an structure identical to that of the outer layer in wild-type TLPs (B.V.V. Prasad, unpublished results), clearly showing that the assembly of VP7 on DLPs is a process independent of the assembly of VP4. In addition, these findings indicated that VP4 is neither required for the budding process nor for the removal of the lipid membrane from the enveloped particles, as had been suggested (Estes, 2001) . Similarly, silencing the VP7 gene prevented the formation of TLPs, and caused DLPs to accumulate (Patton, 2003; Camacho et al., manuscript in preparation) . A priori, one would expect that inhibition of the synthesis of NSP4, the ER membrane receptor for DLPs, should also lead to an accumulation of DLPs. However, since it is known that this protein alters the calcium homeostasis of cells (Tian et al., 1994 (Tian et al., , 1995 , its absence might have additional effects on the virus replication cycle. Silencing the NSP4 and VP7 genes should allow us to establish directly the role of these proteins in the translocation of DLPs into the lumen of the ER and in the removal of the intermediary lipid envelope.",

The mRNAs are accessible in the cytoplasm to be translated (where they can be efficiently targeted by RNAi), whereas the RNA(+) molecules acting as template for dsRNA replication could be either kept within the so-called viroplasms (where the synthesis of the RNA(\u2212) is thought to take place) or could be associated in the cytoplasm with RNA binding proteins, making them inaccessible to the RNAi machinery. Even though the existence of two separated viral transcripts pools would appear to be logical, the common belief is that viral transcripts represent a single pool of RNA that could be used at any time, and stochastically, for either of the two functions. The hypothesis that a mRNA pool could be physically separated from the RNA(+) (replication) pool might explain why the attempts to develop a reverse genetic system for rotaviruses have so far failed; the introduction of exogenous transcripts that represent rotavirus mRNAs (obtained by in vitro synthesis), or the production inside the cell of these transcripts from recombinant vectors, might not reach the compartment where such molecules are used as templates for replication.",

The introduction of siRNAs preventing the replication of the virus (for instance silencing genes involved in the replication of the viral genome) could shorten the duration of the illness and possibly help to prevent dehydration, the principal cause of death of a rotavirus infection.
