            "text": "Purpose. Polyethylenimine (PEI) is among the most efficient nonviral gene delivery vectors. Its efficiency and cytotoxicity depend on molecular weight, with the 25-kDa PEI being most efficient but cytotoxic. Smaller PEIs are noncytotoxic but less efficient. Enhancement in gene delivery efficiency with minimal cytotoxicity by cross-linking of small PEIs via potentially biodegradable linkages was explored herein. The hypothesis was that cross-linking would raise the polycation's effective molecular weight and hence the transfection efficiency, while biodegradable linkages would undergo the intracellular breakdown after DNA delivery and hence not lead to cytotoxicity. Toward this goal, we carried out cross-linking of branched 2-kDa PEI and its 1:1 (w/w) mixture with a linear 423-Da PEI via ester-and/or amide-bearing linkages; the in vitro and in vivo gene delivery efficiency, as well as toxicity to mammalian cells, of the resultant cross-linked polycations were investigated. Methods. The efficiency of the cross-linked PEIs in delivering in vitro a plasmid containing \u2424-galactosidase gene and their cytotoxicity were investigated in monkey kidney cells (COS-7). Dynamic light scattering was used to compare the relative DNA condensation efficiency of the unmodified and crosslinked PEIs. In vivo gene delivery efficiency was evaluated by intratracheal delivery in mice of the complexes of a luciferase-encoding plasmid and the PEIs and estimating the luciferase expression in the lungs. Results. Cross-linking boosted the gene delivery efficiency of the small PEIs by 40-to 550-fold in vitro; the efficiency of the most potent conjugates even exceeded by an order of magnitude that of the branched 25-kDa PEI. Effective condensation of DNA was evident from the fact that the mean diameter of the complexes of the cross-linked PEIs was some 300 nm with a narrow size distribution, while the complexes of the unmodified small PEIs exhibited a mean size of >700 nm with a very broad size distribution. At concentrations where the 25-kDa PEI resulted in >95% cell death, the conjugates afforded nearly full cell viability. The cross-linked PEIs were 17 to 80 times more efficient than the unmodified ones in vivo; furthermore, their efficiencies were up to twice that of the 25-kDa PEI. Conclusions. Cross-linking of small PEIs with judiciously designed amide-and ester-bearing linkers boosts their gene delivery efficiency both in vitro and in vivo without increasing the cytotoxicity. The high efficiency is dependent on the nature of the linkages and the PEIs used.",

            "text": "Gene therapy, the treatment or prevention of inherited (1) (2) (3) or acquired (4) (5) (6) diseases by the delivery of DNA, has attracted much attention as a promising therapeutic strategy during the past two decades (7) . However, after more than a thousand clinical trials, no gene therapy protocol has yet been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The negative charge and biodegradability of nucleic acids pose a major challenge to their delivery, and the primary hurdle to the clinical success of gene therapy has been the absence of carriers (vectors) that can deliver DNA and RNA into target cells safely and efficiently (8) (9) (10) . Viral vectors, used in most clinical trials, are plagued by such problems as immunogenicity (11) , insertionals mutagenesis (12) , and even germ cell line alterations (13) . Cationic liposomes (7) and polycations (8) (9) (10) are the two major classes of nonviral vectors investigated for gene delivery. Polycations, such as polylysine, are yet to reach clinical trials due to their inferior efficiency compared to viral vectors and liposomal formulations (14, 15) . However, the discovery that polyethylenimine (PEI) is able to deliver DNA on par with the best cationic liposomes (15) has led to intense research both in terms of understanding (16) (17) (18) (19) and improving (17, (20) (21) (22) gene delivery by PEI, as well as designing its mimics (23) (24) (25) (26) .",

            "text": "The relatively high transfection efficiency of PEI was proposed to be due to its \"proton-sponge\" effect, and much evidence supports this hypothesis (17, 19) . According to the latter, the partially protonated polycation absorbs protons brought into the endocytic vesicles by the ATPase proton pump, leading to the accompanying influx of chloride ions and ultimately to osmotic swelling and rupture of the endocytic vesicles. The gene delivery efficiency and cytotoxicity of PEI vary with its molecular weight. For example, the branched 2-kDa PEI is some two orders of magnitude less efficient than the branched 25-kDa polycation at the same concentration (17) , but the former is not cytotoxic whereas the latter is. Increasing the hydrophobicity of small PEIs enhances their transfection efficiency substantially (17, (27) (28) (29) , as does increasing the effective molecular weight (30) (31) (32) (33) . Previously, we found that conjugation of the 2-kDa PEI to gold nanoparticles boosted the optimal transfection efficiency of this PEI in vitro 12 times (thus making it some 6 times higher than that of the 25-kDa PEI) (33) . However, this conjugation also raised toxicity of the 2-kDa PEI, thus limiting the applicability of the conjugates in vivo, particularly as relatively high concentrations were required for optimal efficiency.",

We hypothesized that enhancement in gene delivery efficiency with minimal cytotoxicity may be achieved by cross-linking of small PEIs with linkages that are potentially biodegradable. Such linkages comprise esters, amides, orthoesters, acetals, glycosides, and disulfides; polymers containing these bonds are increasingly common in biomedical and pharmaceutical applications (34), including gene delivery (23) (24) 31, (35) (36) (37) (38) (39) (40) . Gene delivery using soluble biodegradable polycations has had only limited success with a few exceptions (23) (24) 40) . In many instances, where low cytotoxicity was achieved, transfection efficiency was far inferior to the 25-kDa PEI (36) (37) (38) (39) ; in others, low or moderate cytotoxicity with moderate efficiency has been reported (31, 35) . Even for systems with relatively high in vitro efficiency (23) (24) 40) , their potency in the presence of serum or in vivo performance are not known.",

Briefly, the culture medium was removed, and the cells were treated with 1.0 ml of DMEM containing 0.5 mg/ml MTT [3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5diphenyltetrazolium bromide, Sigma-Aldrich]. After incubation at 37\u00b0C in a humidified air atmosphere (5% CO 2 ) for 4 h, the medium was removed and 560 l of DMSO was added to each well to dissolve the formazan crystals produced from the reduction of MTT by viable cells. After an overnight incubation, the absorbance of the DMSO solution from each well was measured at 570 nm in a 96-well format following appropriate dilutions. The results were expressed as percentages relative to control cells (mean \u00b1 SD, n \u202b\u05e1\u202c 3).",

In fact, the mechanism of unpacking of polycation-DNA complexes is obscure and may involve a polyion exchange reaction with these polyanions.

The optimal N/P ratios, defined as those exhibiting the highest transfection efficiency, were consistent with the molecular weights of the cross-linked PEIs and the nature of the linkages. For example, DSS-cross-linked 2-kDa PEI, with its amide linkage, was expected to be more stable to hydrolytic degradation under physiologic conditions than that cross-linked with EGS. Note that hydrolytic degradation of poly(amino esters) under physiologic conditions has been reported previously (36, (39) (40) . The optimal N/P ratios of the polyplexes of the 2-kDa PEI cross-linked with DSS and EGS were 10 and 30, respectively. Higher biodegradability implies that a portion of the polycation might get degraded in the extra-/intra-cellular environment, thus necessitating a higher concentration of the polycation to achieve optimal efficiency. Interestingly, the optimal efficiency of 2-kDa PEI crosslinked with DSS was some 1/30 of that cross-linked with EGS, probably because higher hydrolytic degradability of the EGSbased conjugate facilitates the release of DNA (vector un-packing) and hence enhances the transcriptional availability of DNA (43) . Similarly, in the case of the smaller, hybrid cross-linked PEIs, the polycation with a higher hydrolytic stability (DSS-based) exhibited a lower optimal N/P ratio than the more labile (EGS-based) one: 30 vs. 50. The optimal efficiency of the two cross-linked PEIs in this case differed only by 3-fold.",

Consistent with the increase in transfection efficiency, the polyplexes of all of the cross-linked PEIs were smaller than their parents at the N/P ratios of both 10 and 30 (Table I) . Also, at N/P \u202b\u05e1\u202c 10, 2-kDa PEI cross-linked with DSS and EGS exhibited lower mean diameters (527 and 495 nm, respectively) than the two cross-linked hybrid PEIs (675 and 683 nm, respectively), consistent with the former's higher molecular weight. Moreover, increasing the N/P ratio to 30 resulted in a 100-200 nm reduction in the mean diameter of all the PEIs (Table I) . The mean sizes of the parent small PEIs were still high, above 700 nm, and these complexes were also characterized by a wide distribution of particle sizes (Table I and Fig. 3 ). In contrast, DNA complexes of the DSScross-linked hybrid and EGS-cross-linked 2-kDa PEI, the two polycations that afforded the highest transfection efficiencies, had a roughly 300-nm mean particle diameter and a narrow size distribution (Table I and Fig. 3 ). All the particles were under 400 nm in diameter in both instances. The EGScross-linked hybrid had a higher mean diameter (502 nm) at N/P \u202b\u05e1\u202c 30, presumably explaining the requirement of higher N/P \u202b\u05e1(\u202c 50) for optimal efficiency in this case. The DSS-crosslinked 2-kDa PEI, whose optimal N/P ratio was 10, also exhibited much smaller mean particle diameter and narrow size distribution at N/P \u202b\u05e1\u202c 30 compared to 10. The inferior efficiency of the smaller particles in this case is likely due to the low release of DNA from the tightly compacted complexes (less facile vector unpackaging).

            "text": "It is noteworthy that the cross-linked PEIs described herein, although larger than their parents, still have relatively low molecular weights. Nevertheless, despite their relatively low molecular weight (e.g., compared to the 25-kDa), they afford high transfection efficiency. The lower limit for the latter in terms of molecular weight and the concentration required for optimal efficiency (defined by N/P) may be expected to vary for different classes of polycations. For example, dodecylated 2-kDa PEI synthesized by us previously was some 400-fold more efficient than the parent even though the average molecular weight had increased by only about 800 Da and the optimal N/P in this case was 20. For the unmodified 2-kDa PEI, the optimal N/P is around 150 (33) . These results, in combination with those of the current experiments, suggest that the efficiency and the N/P ratio required for optimal efficiency are decided by a combination of molecular weight, hydrophobicity, and degradability of the polycations. In general, lower optimal N/P ratios are indicative of the greater DNA condensation ability of the polycations and thus are suitable candidates for in vivo gene delivery. The results of the cytotoxicity experiments involving the PEIs are presented in Fig. 4 . The parents, small PEIs, were nontoxic even at the highest concentrations used. In contrast, 25-kDa PEI was highly toxic, with cell viability dropping more than half at concentrations above 20 g/ml and to under 5% above 35 g/ml PEI. By comparison, all the cross-linked PEIs were far more benign. In fact, the EGS-cross-linked PEIs were as nontoxic as the parent small PEIs. Of the two DSScross-linked PEIs, the 2-kDa one was more toxic than the hybrid. As in transfection experiments, the toxicity profiles of the cross-linked PEIs were consistent with their relative degradability and molecular weights. Importantly, the most potent cross-linked PEIs, which are an order of magnitude more efficient than the 25-kDa polycation, exhibited 100% or 95% cell viability at concentrations where 25-kDa resulted in >95% cell death. The most potent cross-linked PEIs were next tested for their efficiency in gene delivery into mouse lung through intratracheal administration. Lung is the affected organ in the case of many serious and potentially fatal diseases, such as cystic fibrosis, lung cancer, influenza, and severe acute respiratory syndrome, and therefore serves as the target for their treatment by gene delivery. The first two diseases, e.g., may be treated by delivering plasmid DNA containing the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance gene (CFTR gene) and the tumor suppressor p53 gene, respectively (1, 44, 45) . The last two diseases may be treated by the delivery of siRNA against specific genes of the viruses (6, 46) . Intratracheal administration has the advantage over the systemic one in that the delivered nucleic acid is primarily expressed in the lungs, thus avoiding unwanted expression in other organs. However, several barriers to nonviral gene delivery to the airway exist (47) . For example, mucins (high-molecular-weight glycosylated proteins) and lung sufactants impede cationic liposome-mediated transfection (47) , possibly by disrupting the DNA/lipid complex.",
