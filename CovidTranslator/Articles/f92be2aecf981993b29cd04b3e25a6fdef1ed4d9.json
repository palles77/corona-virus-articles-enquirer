Here, we measured the effectiveness of glass wool filters to simultaneously concentrate enteric viruses and bacteria of bovine origin from water. The recovery efficiencies were determined for bovine viral diarrhea virus types 1 and 2, bovine rotavirus group A, bovine coronavirus, poliovirus Sabin III, toxigenic Escherichia coli ,and Campylobacter jejuni seeded into water with three different turbidity levels (0.5, 215, and 447 NTU). Twenty liters of dechlorinated tap water (pH 7) were seeded with the test organisms, and then passed through a glass wool filter using a peristaltic pump (flow rate = 1 liter min -1 ). Retained organisms were eluted from the filters by passing beef extract-glycine buffer (pH 9.5) in the direction opposite of sample flow. Recovered organisms were enumerated by qPCR except for C. jejuni, which was quantified by culture. Mean recovery efficiencies ranged from 55 to 33 % for the bacteria and 58 to 16 % for the viruses. Using bootstrapping techniques combined with Analysis of Variance, recovery efficiencies were found to differ among the pathogen types tested at the two lowest turbidity levels; however, for a given pathogen type turbidity did not affect recovery except for C. jejuni. Glass wool filtration is a cost-effective method for concentrating several waterborne pathogens of bovine origin simultaneously, although recovery may be low for some specific taxa such as bovine viral diarrhea virus 1.",

Pathogens in the seeded negative eluate were enumerated with the same method as the water samples, and these values were used as the devisors when calculating percent recovery. Quantifying the seeded pathogens in a negative eluate takes into consideration differences in pathogen enumeration that could result from matrix differences created by the glass wool filter.

Here we report the use of these filters for concentrating both viral and bacterial pathogens associated with cattle manure from water at turbidity levels simulating agricultural runoff. The filters are advantageous in that they are inexpensive, highly portable, usable in a wide range of water matrices, and effective for simultaneous concentration of both bacterial and viral waterborne pathogens. They can be constructed to any size, depending on volumes to be sampled. After disinfection, filter housings are reusable. Glass wool filters, however, do have limitations. As with any virus concentration method that relies on electro-positively charged media for virus adsorption (e.g., 1MDS filter, CUNO Inc., Meriden, CT), filter effectiveness depends on ambient water pH. In our laboratory, we have selected pH 7.5 as the cut-off, above which the water pH is adjusted downward by continuously pumping 0.25 mol l -1 HCl into the filter input line during sampling.",

Even with C. jejuni concentrations as low as five CFU per liter in highly turbid water glass wool filtration recovered about a quarter to a third of the bacteria (Table 1) . Payment et al. (1989) examined fiberglass filters for the recovery efficiency of Clostridium perfringens and Legionella pneumophila and found efficiencies were 83 and 55 %, respectively. Hill et al. (2005) tested ultrafiltration for recoveries of E. coli, Enterococcus faecalis, S. enterica, Bacillus globigii and found mean recovery efficiencies were from 70 to 93 % for all bacterial species. Bisha et al. (2011) evaluated modified Moore swabs and continuous flow centrifugation for concentrating S. enterica and E. coli O157:H7. Liu et al. (2012) tested the recovery of C. perfringens spores, and E. coli by ultrafiltration, and the recovery efficiencies were greater than 50 %.",
