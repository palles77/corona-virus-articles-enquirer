The binding of coronaviruses to the cell surface is mediated by the viral surface protein S. Recently we demonstrated that a2,3-linked sialic acid serves as a receptor determinant for IBVon Vero cells and primary chicken embryo kidney cells. Here we analyze the importance of the sialic acid binding activity for the infection of tracheal organ cultures (TOCs) by different IBV strains. Our results show that a2,3-linked sialic acid also serves as a receptor determinant on chicken TOCs. Infection of TOCs by IBV results in ciliostasis. Desialylation induced by neuraminidase treatment of tracheal organ cultures prior to infection by IBV delayed the ciliostatic effect or resulted in partial loss of ciliary activity. This effect was observed with both respiratory and nephropathogenic strains. Inhibition of ciliostasis was also observed when TOCs were pretreated with an a2,3-specific neuraminidase. Analysis of the tracheal epithelium for reactivity with lectins revealed that the susceptible cells in the epithelium abundantly express a2,3-linked sialic acid. These results indicate that a2,3-linked sialic acid plays an important role for infection of the respiratory epithelium by IBV.",

The etiologic agent is Infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), a member of the family Coronaviridae [1] . The pathology of the disease associated with IBV infection can show different characteristics depending on the tissue where virus replication occurs. IBV enters its host via the oro/oculo-nasal route and the first site of replication is the respiratory epithelium. From there the virus infection can spread to several organs, including kidney and reproductive tract (reviewed in [2] ). Secondary pathogens can complicate the disease resulting in increased morbidity and mortality.",

For several coronaviruses specific proteins have been described that serve as cellular receptors for the initiation of infection. Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 has been identified as a receptor for SARS coronavirus [3, 4] and several group 1 coronaviruses including transmissible gastroenteritis virus require aminopeptidase N to enter their host cells [5, 6] .

            "text": "After having shown recently that sialic acid serves as a receptor determinant for IBV on cultured cells, we were interested to find out whether this type of sugar is also important for an infection in vivo. To address this question we chose TOCs as a model for the upper respiratory epithelium. The trachea of chicken embryos was cut into pieces about 1 mm thick. Tracheal rings chosen for this analysis showed ciliary activity along the whole contact area of the epithelium with the lumen of the trachea, i.e. 360 of the tracheal ring. Infection of TOCs by IBV results in ciliostasis that can easily be detected microscopically. As shown in Fig. 1 , infection by IBV-Beaudette reduced the portion of the epithelium with ciliary activity. At 2 days post infection (d.p.i.), complete ciliostasis was observed at this experimental setting. To analyze the importance of sialic acids we treated TOCs with neuraminidase from Clostridium perfringens, which releases the sialic acids from the cell surface. As a result desialylated TOCs were less sensitive to the ciliostatic effect of the IBV infection. At 5 d.p.i., about 25% of the epithelium still showed ciliary activity. This effect is accounted for by the neuraminidase itself rather than by a contaminant enzyme, because in the presence of a neuraminidase inhibitor the enzyme was unable to protect the tracheal epithelium from the ciliostatic effect of the IBV infection (Fig. 1) .",

To demonstrate that the sialic acid-dependent infection of tracheal epithelial cells is a general feature of IBV, we included two other strains. The M41 strain causes respiratory disease, whereas the B1648 strain has a nephropathogenic potential [8] . After application of an infectious dose of 10 4 pfu per tracheal ring, the IBV strains caused ciliostasis by day 3 (M41), 4 (B1648) or 5 (Beaudette) after infection (Fig. 3AeC) . Strain M41 was more pathogenic than the other two strains resulting in a loss of ciliary activity at 2 d.p.i. on 80% of the epithelium in the microscopic field (Fig. 3C) . A comparable reduction was observed with the two other strains only 3 days following infection of TOCs (Fig. 3A and B) . For all three strains, a protective effect of neuraminidase treatment was found. In the case of M41, ciliostasis was delayed for 1 day; in the case of the other two strains, the ciliary activity was retained in about 60% of the desialylated epithelium even on day 5 following infection. Ciliostasis was also found after infection by Avian metapneumovirus. However, in contrast to IBV infection, neuraminidase treatment did not prevent the ciliostatic effect of the metapneumovirus infection.

For the latter strain it has been recently reported that it also recognizes glycosaminoglycans of the heparan sulfate type [9] . The acquisition of this additional binding activity may have allowed the adaptation to new host cells as has been shown for other viruses, e.g. foot and mouth disease virus [10] and tick-borne encephalitis virus [11] . By contrast, the sialic acid binding activity has been detected on all IBV strains analyzed including respiratory and nephropathogenic variants.

            "text": "The importance of sialic acid for IBV infection was evident from the delayed appearance of ciliostasis on desialylated TOCs. For the M41 strain, the ciliostatic effect was delayed only by 1 day, whereas for the two other strains analyzed, some ciliary activity was retained even 5 days after infection. This difference in the protective effect of neuraminidase treatment is probably accounted for by the difference in the cytopathogenicity of these viruses. This may also explain the larger amount of virus that is released from TOCs infected by IBV-Beaudette compared to M41-infected tracheal rings. Despite these differences, the relative effect of desialylation was similar, i.e. the amount of released virus was reduced by about 60%. The partial protection of TOCs from IBV infection may be attributable to the difficulties in removing all sialic acid residues from the cell surface of the tracheal epithelium. Staining by MAA revealed that some sialic acids are still present on the apical membrane of the epithelial cells after neuraminidase treatment. Whether this low level of sialic acid by itself is sufficient for a low level of infection is not known. An alternative explanation is that binding to surfacebound sialic acids is only a first attachment step in the infection cycle that precedes the binding to a second receptor, though such a receptor has not been identified for IBV so far. In favor of the latter explanation is the fact that IBV recognizes sialic acid with lower affinity when compared to influenza virus and Sendai virus [7] . Because of the higher affinity for sialic acids, a second receptor may be dispensable for influenza viruses; however, it may require the presence of a neuraminidase (receptor-destroying enzyme) to allow passage through the mucus layer covering the respiratory epithelium [12] and to enable virus release from infected cells [13] . On the other hand, a receptor-destroying enzyme may be dispensable for IBV because of the lower affinity for sialic acids.",

On one hand, there is bovine coronavirus and related viruses that resemble influenza C virus, because they recognize N-acetyl-9-O-acetylneuraminic acid and contain an acetylesterase that acts as a receptor-destroying enzyme comparable to the neuraminidase of influenza A and B viruses [14, 15] . These viruses depend on sialic acid for infection of cells. On the other hand, there is transmissible gastroenteritis virus, a porcine coronavirus. This virus uses aminopeptidase N as a cellular receptor and it does not require sialic acid for successful infection of cultured cells. However, binding to sialylated surface components may increase the efficiency of infection, because mutants lacking the sialic acid binding activity have lost the enteropathogenicity [16, 17] . IBV takes an intermediate position; sialic acid is important for infection of cultured cells but it lacks a receptor-destroying enzyme. As mentioned above, IBV maydin addition to sialylated surface moleculesdbind to a specific receptor similar to the interaction of TGEV with aminopeptidase N. Though it Fig. 6 .

            "text": "Our analysis of TOC revealed that both ciliated and mucusproducing cells are susceptible to infection. From this result we conclude that in vivo both cell types can act as primary target cells for IBV. The expression of a2,3-linked sialic acids and the absence of a2,6-linked sialic acids is consistent with the preference of IBV for the former linkage type ( [7] and this report). In this respect IBV appears to have developed a similar strategy to avian influenza viruses which also use a2,3-linked sialic on the cell surface to initiate an infection. However, there are also major differences between avian influenza and avian coronaviruses. A major determinant of the pathogenicity of influenza viruses is the proteolytic cleavage of the hemagglutinin. The hemagglutinins of highly pathogenic viruses have a multibasic cleavage site that is susceptible to furin-like enzymes present in many cell types. Viruses of low pathogenicity become fusion-active by a protease that is secreted by respiratory cells. The S protein of all IBV strains has a multibasic cleavage site and is cleaved in all cell types into the subunits S1 and S2. Therefore, proteolytical activation of S is not a major determinant of the pathogenicity of IBV. Why some IBV strains are predominantly respiratory pathogens whereas others affect other organs to cause disease, e.g. the renal system or the reproductive tract, is not known. If there exists a second receptor for this virus as discussed above, such a protein may be responsible for the host specificity as well as the tissue or organ tropism of IBV. Future work should clarify whether a second receptor exists. Furthermore, the sialoglyconjugates used for primary attachment should be analyzed. The available lectins and neuraminidases only allow a differentiation between a2,3and a2,6-linked sialic acids. Different oligosaccharides exist that contain a2,3linked sialic acid, and the sialoglycoconjugates recognized by IBV may be different from those that are preferred by avian influenza viruses. Such differences may also contribute to a different course of infection. Expression of a2,3-linked sialic acid on epithelial cells in chickens has been analyzed for the trachea and the intestine [20, 21] . As far as other target organs of IBVare concerned, e.g. kidney and the reproductive system, a2,3-linked sialic acid has been shown to be present on primary kidney cells [7] . It will be interesting in the future to find out whether infection of the reproductive system is also mediated by sialic acid.",
