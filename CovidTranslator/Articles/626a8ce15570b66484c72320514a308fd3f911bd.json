We used spherical gold nanoparticles (average diameter, 15 nm) as a platform for the antigen for swine transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV). The literature data demonstrate that immunization of animals with the TGEV antigen coupled to gold nanoparticles (GNPs) not only activates antigenpresenting cells but also increases the proliferative activity of splenic lymphoid (antibody-forming) cells. The contents of \u03b3-IFN, IL-1\u03b2, and IL-6 in animals immunized with GNP-antigen conjugates were found to be higher than those in intact animals or in animals given the antigen alone. The increased concentration of IL-1\u03b2 in the immunized animals directly correlated with the activity of macrophages and stimulated B cells, which produce this cytokine when activated. The increased concentration of IL-6 indicates that the injected preparations are stimulatory to cellular immunity. Immunization with the TGEV antigen conjugated to GNPs as a carrier activates the respiratory activity of lymphoid cells and peritoneal macrophages, which is directly related to their transforming activity and to the activation of antibody generation. Furthermore, the use of this conjugate allows marked improvement of the structure of the animals' immune organs and restores the morphological-functional state of these organs. The microanatomical changes (increased number of follicles) indicate the activation of the B-dependent zone of the spleen and, consequently, the development of a humoral-type immunological reaction. The degradative processes observed in the animals immunized with TGEV antigen alone are evidence of weak resistance to pathogen attack. These results can be used to develop vaccines against this infection by employing TGEV antigen coupled to gold nanoparticles as a carrier.",

Traditional inactivated vaccines have high contents of contaminant substances (up to 99%), causing side effects, and/or may contain, as inactivating compounds, toxic agents such as phenol and formaldehyde, normally used to inactivate microbial cells. Moreover, traditional vaccines are usually low immunogenic, because killed microorganisms cannot induce fully functioning cellular immunity. Therefore, there is a need to develop new, more effective, and less costly vaccines against swine transmissible gastroenteritis (Mout et al. 2012) .",

Gold nanoparticles are stable metallic nanoparticles which have excellent surface functional chemistry, high biocompatibility, and nil toxicity. In addition, gold nanoparticles can be easily synthesized, giving them shapes such as spheres, rods, cubes, stars, and pyramids. Several reports have described the development and use of nanostructures for the delivery of biologically active agents to target cells (Mout et al. 2012; Bhattacharya and Mukherjee 2008; Staroverov et al. 2012 ).

In addition, AuNP-M2e was administered together with sCpG which is a strong immunomodulator. It was interesting for us to look at the production of these cytokines in the body as a whole and to reveal the general clinical changes that can develop on the introduction of antigen and AuNP. One can speculate that GNPs facilitate antigen expression with the major histocompability complex on the surface of antigen-presenting cells.

The spleen framework is formed by trabeculae, which consist of reticular connective tissue, smooth muscle cells, and blood vessels (at the same time, the spleen contains only efferent lymphatic vessels). The reticular connective tissue includes both red and white pulp. The white pulp is a lymphoid tissue that produces immune and blood cells. The red pulp functions to filter blood for antigens, microorganisms, and defective red blood cells; therefore, it contains various blood corpuscles, including large and small lymphocytes, immature leucocytes, leucocytes at the final stage of graininess, and disintegrating erythrocytes. The spleen is also important for the development of humoral immunity and is a B-system organ.",

Perivascular edema and sparse lymphoid tissue in the follicles can be observed Fig. 8 Concentration of IL-6 in animals immunized with GNPantigen conjugates (TGEV antigen \u0440 = 0.95; GNP-antigen conjugate \u0440 = 0.002; GNPs \u0440 = 0.08) (antibody-forming) cells. The contents of \u03b3-IFN, IL-1\u03b2, and IL-6 in animals immunized with GNP-antigen conjugates were higher than those in the intact animals or in animals given the antigen alone. The increased concentration of IL-1\u03b2 in the immunized animals directly correlated with the activity of macrophages and stimulated B cells, which produce this cytokine when activated. The increased concentration of IL-6 indicates that the injected preparations are stimulatory to cellular immunity. Several reports have described the development and use of nanostructures for stimulating cellular immunity. For example, Xu et al. (2012) showed that gold nanorods associated with the DNA vaccine may cause increased formation of \u03b3-IFN in HIV-infected mice. Assis et al. (2018) showed that gold nanorods, functionalized with cysteamine and associated with the protein rSm29, are stimulatory to IL-1. In a work, Tao et al. (2017) showed that the use of nanostructured vaccine led to an increase in the concentration of IgG2a, IgA, and IL-1a, IL-2, IL-17, TNF-\u0438 RANTES. Our research correlates with these studies but in the present work we used gold nanoparticles for the first time as a platform for antigen for TGEV. Also, we did nonspecific adsorption of the antigen and did not perform a chemical surface functionalization. This made it possible to simplify the conjugation process, as well as to remove additional procedures related to the purification of the drug from toxic components. Additionally we analyzed the morphological changes in the spleens of the animals immunized with GNP-antigen conjugates and TGEV antigen.",
