The clinical data of 34 cases with severe pneumonia were collected. According to the clinical outcome, the patients were divided into a survival group (n=26) and a fatality group (n=8). Various factors, including the blood lactic acid level, oxygenation index, CRP level and acute physiology and chronic health evaluation II (APACHE II) score, were retrospectively analyzed in order to investigate whether these values had clinical significance for the prognosis of the patients. No statistically significant differences with regard to age, gender, initial concentrations of blood lactic acid and CRP, and APACHE II scores were observed between the two groups at admission to the Intensive Care Unit. However, the blood lactic acid levels were found to decrease to a normal level within 12-24 h after treatment in the survival group, while the levels were maintained at a higher concentration in the fatality group, even at 72 h after treatment (P<0.05). Furthermore, the oxygenation index in the survival group was significantly higher when compared with that in the fatality group. The oxygenation index was maintained at a normal level in the survival group, while the oxygenation index levels were below normal and continued to decline in the fatality group. A positive correlation was observed between the blood lactic acid level and the APACHE II scores (r=0.656, P<0.05). Therefore, the present study demonstrated that dynamic monitoring of blood lactic acid, oxygenation index and CRP levels in patients with severe pneumonia can be used to evaluate the therapeutic efficiency, in addition to serving as a prognosis indicator, for patients with severe pneumonia.",

            "text": "Severe pneumonia is defined as respiratory insufficiency, which is caused by tissue hypoxia and metabolic dysfunction (12, 13) . Sequential failure, severe pneumonia in children, the elderly, the frail, immunocompromised patients, children's basic physiology and pathology of special schools, elderly patients prior to the onset of the majority of existing heart, lung disease, mainly in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, diabetes, coronary heart disease, low immunity, tumor etc. The pathological basis of severe pneumonia infection is the triggering of a series of inflammatory events, including inflammatory cytokine release, which results in hemodynamic changes. For example, elevated endotoxin levels in the blood and an uncontrolled systemic inflammatory response leads to multiple organ failure. Changes to the in vivo microenvironment ##and normal metabolic disorder caused by cells due to a lack of oxygen are the main reasons for the formation of multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (14) . CRP is a product of fibrin dissolution, and is increased in inflammatory diseases. Therefore, the protein can be used as an important index to evaluate systemic inflammation. In patients with severe pneumonia, tissue organ effective blood volume reduction, which further exacerbates tissue hypoxia and increases anaerobic metabolism. Blood lactic acid is a product of the anaerobic glycolysis of glucose, and can directly reflect the tissue hypoperfusion and hypoxia conditions. Lactic acidosis is an important index of shock, hypoxia and oxygen metabolism, and quantitative detection and monitoring of the lactic acid levels in patients undergoing recovery from severe pneumonia is an important indicator (6, 15, 16) , with significant value for assessment of the disease. The oxygenation index (PaO2/FiO2) is an indicator of the oxygen supply levels reflect the extracellular, is the average mixed venous oxygen saturation from the whole body perfusion vascular beds value. The index reflects the state of tissue oxygenation and perfusion, tissue oxygen supply and oxygen requirements (17) (18) (19) . In addition, the oxygenation index (PaO2/FiO2) is an important predictor of the prognosis of patients in a critical condition. Through dynamic monitoring of the oxygenation index (PaO2/FiO2), treatment protocols can be effectively guided, while evaluating the prognosis. Strengthen the monitoring of oxygen metabolism in patients with early, early detection and correct body anoxic condition may improve the survival rate of the patients, the Nguy -en and so on the oxygenation index (PaO2/FiO2) <300 mmHg as septic shock early goal-directed therapy can improve prognosis. The results of the present study demonstrated that the early course of oxygenation index (PaO2/FiO2) for 2 times less than 250 of patients, the prognosis is not good. Therefore, monitoring the oxygenation index (PaO2/FiO2) level, particularly continuous detection for condition assessment, has important clinical significance. In patients with persistent pneumonia, the oxygenation index (PaO2/FiO2) was shown to decrease, indicating that the body was in severe hypoxia. In ICU, positive measures can be applied to increase the oxygen intake, improve microcirculation and reduce oxygen consumption and other measures to correct the severe hypoxia. However, the oxygenation index (PaO2/FiO2) only reflects the systemic oxygen supply and consumption balance; thus, is unable to evaluate the local situation. Therefore, certain studies have attempted to assess the local oxygen saturation and oxygen load using additional methods, with the aim to further understand the tissue oxygen supply for disease detection and the guidance of treatment (20, 21) . CRP is an acute phase protein that is an important index of inflammation. Thus, the CRP concentration in patients with infectious diseases, particularly infectious shock and severe infection, increases significantly. The underlying mechanism is hypothesized to primarily involve endotoxin or antigen antibody complexes functioning as activators to directly activate the release of proinflammatory cytokines. Inflammation can be caused by the release of a variety of inflammatory factors, which subsequently leads to hypoxia, acidosis-induced pulmonary microvascular contraction and a slow blood supply. In the present study, the CRP level in the survival group was lower when compared with the fatality group, which exhibited significantly increased levels. If a decrease in the CRP concentration is not evident, or the levels continue to increase, the disease prognosis is not good. Following treatment, Lin Zhejiang (22) detected significantly increased levels of CRP in 48 elderly patients with severe pneumonia, as compared with the healthy group, indicating that body in elderly patients with severe pneumonia in inflammatory activity anomaly detection. Therefore, dynamic monitoring of the CRP level may aid the understanding of the in vivo inflammatory medium water in patients with severe pneumonia, purification for guiding clinical use of anti-inflammatory medium drugs or continuous blood (CRRT) provide the basis, thus reducing the mortality rate. A single blood lactic acid, is the reflection of the oxygen supply and the anaerobic metabolism state, the rain during the ICU treatment, doctors would like to grasp the improving hypoxia in patients after treatment. Therefore, the dynamic determination of the blood lactic acid level may be more meaningful. Nguyen et al (11) demonstrated that in patients with septic shock resuscitation, a 6-h lactic acid clearance rate of \u226510% resulted in the dosage of vocative drugs being significantly lower when compared with the patients who had a low clearance rate, and the mortality rate was also significantly reduced. Therefore, determination of the lactate clearance rate may better reflect the patient prognosis compared with the pure lactic acid concentration. Treatment to effectively reduce the blood lactic acid level is limited; thus, improving the tissue perfusion and oxygenation status is challenging. Subsequently, the progression of the disease may deteriorate and the condition may easily develop into septic shock, with an increased mortality rate. Retrospective analysis of the present study revealed that patients in the survival group had a higher lactate clearance rate when compared with the fatality group, and the decreasing speed, survival group blood lactate within 24 h were normal, while the fatality group until 72 h remained significantly higher compared with the survival group. The APACHE II score is an indicator of vital signs in the patient response, and is an important index in ICU management. In addition, the APACHE II score was shown to be closely associated with the disease state; the higher the score, the more severe the prognosis.",

Secondly, the detection methods have evidently progressed in modern ICU treatment; thus, the majority of patients had a good prognosis, subsequently resulting in the number of cases in the survival and fatality groups being unequal. Therefore, there may be bias in the data statistics. The pathological basis of severe pneumonia is known to be a series of responses to infection, and the present study observed three downstream indicators of the disease, namely a balanced supply of blood oxygen, cell anaerobic metabolism and inflammation. However, the present study only assessed the disease in terms of the developing reaction, and in order to fully understand the prognosis and outcome of severe pneumonia (25, 26) , other indicators should be considered. For example, numerous factors, including the age of the patient, the basic disease, lung inflammation and treatment measures, may affect the prognosis of patients. Therefore, further study is required in this research direction.",
