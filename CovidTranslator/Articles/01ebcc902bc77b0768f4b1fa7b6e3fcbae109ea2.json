Certain PRRs sense MAMPs that are truly (structurally) non-self, whereas others sense the non-self origin of molecules by their presence in compartments that are normally devoid of them 1 . Viral infection can be sensed by the recognition of virus-derived nucleic acids through structural features that are not found in self nucleic acids. For example, unmodified, fully base-paired 5\u0374-triphosphorylated RNAs activate the cytosolic RNA helicase retinoic acidinducible gene I (RIG-I), whereas long double-stranded RNAs (dsRNAs) are detected by melanoma differentiationassociated gene 5 (MDA5). By contrast, Toll-like receptors (TLRs) can sense RNA and DNA molecules of both exogenous and endogenous origin, although they show preferences for microbial nucleic acids. In this regard, the mislocalization of nucleic acids in the endolysosomal compartment acts as a signal of non-self origin (as reviewed in REF. 2) .",

By contrast, OAS proteins function as nucleic acid sensors in a more immediate antiviral restriction pathway by impeding translation 3 . Despite these different functionalities, a remarkable finding from recent studies is that OAS1 and cGAS share closely related structural and enzymatic features -they possess the same structural fold, they are activated by a similar double-stranded nucleic acid-induced structural switch and they form a nucleotide second messenger that contains an unusual 2\u0374-5\u0374 phosphodiester linkage (FIG. 1) .",

These include the well-known oligoadenylate synthase (OAS) family proteins and the recently identified OAS homologue cyclic GMP-AMP (cGAMP) synthase (cGAS). The OAS proteins and cGAS are templateindependent nucleotidyltransferases that, once activated by double-stranded nucleic acids in the cytosol, produce unique classes of 2\u0374-5\u0374-linked second messenger molecules, which -through distinct mechanisms -have crucial antiviral functions. 2\u0374-5\u0374-linked oligoadenylates limit viral propagation through the activation of the enzyme RNase L, which degrades host and viral RNA, and 2\u0374-5\u0374-linked cGAMP activates downstream signalling pathways to induce de novo antiviral gene expression. In this Progress article, we describe the striking functional and structural similarities between OAS proteins and cGAS, and highlight their roles in antiviral immunity.",

Similarly, several picornaviruses have mechanisms that antagonize RNase L [18] [19] [20] . Although the OAS-RNase L pathway seems to inhibit a wide variety of viruses, this inhibition is rarely complete and is often redundant with other pathways in vitro.

STINGdeficient cells or animals showed a severely impaired antiviral immune response Upon double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) binding, oligoadenylate synthase (OAS) enzymes undergo a conformational switch, which results in their catalytic activity -that is, the synthesis of 2\u0374-5\u0374-linked oligoadenylates using ATP as a substrate. 2\u0374-5\u0374-linked oligoadenylates subsequently act as second messenger molecules by activating the latent endoribonuclease RNase L in the cytoplasm. RNase L then forms a crossed dimer and degrades RNA that is of both cellular and viral origin, leading to the inhibition of viral propagation. On the other hand, cyclic GMP-AMP (cGAMP) synthase (cGAS) is activated by cytosolic B-form dsDNA to synthesize the non-canonical cyclic dinucleotide (CDN) cGAMP(2\u0374-5\u0374) as its second messenger molecule (using the substrates ATP and GTP). cGAMP(2\u0374-5\u0374) binds to and activates the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-resident receptor stimulator of interferon genes (STING), which subsequently translocates to a perinuclear Golgi compartment where it obtains its signalling-competent state. This results in the activation of transcription factors that initiate antiviral and pro-inflammatory gene expression. At the same time, cGAMP(2\u0374-5\u0374) can also diffuse through gap junctions to initiate antiviral activity in bystander cells. In addition to its role in sensing the endogenous second messenger molecule cGAMP(2\u0374-5\u0374), STING responds to exogenous CDNs that are derived from prokaryotes (not shown).

The crystal structure of cyclic di-GMP (c-di-GMP) bound to the carboxy-terminal domain of STING demonstrated that a preformed STING dimer provides a highly complementary V-shaped binding pocket for CDNs [34] [35] [36] [37] [38] . The dual role of STING as a direct receptor for CDNs and an indirect DNA sensor remained puzzling until the recent discovery of the cytoplasmic nucleotidyltransferase cGAS and its product cGAMP 39, 40 . Indeed, cGAS proved to be the elusive cytoplasmic DNA receptor that functions upstream of STING. Upon DNA binding, cGAS catalyses the synthesis of cGAMP, which, in turn, binds to and activates STING. This exciting finding identified a role for a CDN-dependent signalling process in metazoans (FIG. 1) . Surprisingly, the cGAS-derived cGAMP molecule was found to have a mixed phosphodiester linkage. Unlike known prokaryotic CDNs, cGAMP contains a 2\u0374-5\u0374 and a 3\u0374-5\u0374 phosphodiester linkage between its two ring-forming nucleotides, thus constituting >Gp(2\u0374-5\u0374)Ap(3\u0374-5\u0374)> or cGAMP(2\u0374-5\u0374) [41] [42] [43] . This finding extended the existing family of 2\u0374-5\u0374-linked antiviral biomolecules -which now encompasses both 2\u0374-5\u0374-linked CDNs, as well as 2\u0374-5\u0374-linked oligoadenylates -and supported a functional relationship between cGAS and the OAS system. Of note, human STING is more responsive to cGAMP(2\u0374-5\u0374) than to cGAMP(3\u0374-5\u0374), which also translates into greater antiviral activity of the 2\u0374-5\u0374 phosphodiester-containing CDNs 43, 44 . This might be due to a greater affinity of human STING for cGAMP(2\u0374-5\u0374) 44 , although this model has been questioned 45 .",

Studies using cGAS-deficient cells and animals have highlighted the pivotal and non-redundant role of the cGAS-STING axis in detecting cytosolic DNA. cGAS-deficient cells show a markedly compromised antiviral immune response following challenge with various synthetic DNA molecules, DNA viruses or reverse-transcribing viruses 46, 47 . Although the natural cGAS-stimulatory DNA species have not yet been studied in the context of microbial infection, dsDNA species that originate from the viral genome or from viral replication intermediates are candidates. DNA that is derived from bacteria might also be sensed by cGAS. Several bacterial species that replicate inside or outside the cytoplasm have been shown to trigger cytokine production in a STING-dependent manner 32, 48, 49 . However, given the dual role of STING as a sensor for prokaryotic CDNs and endogenous cGAMP, it remains to be determined whether these microbial pathogens are indeed sensed by cGAS. As some of these bacteria can trigger the activation of absent in melanoma 2 (AIM2) -which is a bona fide cytosolic DNA sensor -a cytosolic cGAS ligand should, in principle, be available [50] [51] [52] .",

            "text": "cGAS as a sensor for endogenous DNA. cGAS seems to function as a general dsDNA sensor without a preference for microbial DNA. This suggests that the cGAS-STING pathway might erroneously sense endogenous DNA species that have gained access to the cytosol. In this regard, it is noteworthy that several inflammatory disorders have been described in which the failure to keep the cytoplasm clear of PRR-stimulatory nucleic acids forms the mechanistic basis of disease (as reviewed in REFS 53, 54) . For example, in the context of the deficiency or decreased activity of the 3\u0374 repair exonuclease TREX1, endogenous DNA species that presumably originate from reverse-transcribed cDNA elements accumulate in the cytoplasm 55 . This, in turn, triggers a cell-autonomous antiviral immune response that is associated with the production of type I IFNs and can result in severe autoimmune disease pathology in affected patients or the respective mouse model. Knocking out the genes encoding STING or cGAS completely abrogates the spontaneous induction of antiviral gene expression in TREX1-deficient cells, and TREX1-deficient mice can be rescued from lethal auto immunity by deleting the gene that encodes STING 56, 57 . In light of these findings, it is likely that the cGAS-STING axis is also involved in other inflammatory conditions, in which endogenous DNA erroneously gains access to the cytoplasm. Somewhat unexpectedly, cGAS was also shown to contribute to the innate control of the positive-strand RNA virus West Nile virus 58 . In this case, it seems that cGAS is not directly involved in sensing the virus itself but instead contributes to a tonic type I IFN response that is required to facilitate the primary response to the virus. This low but constitutive type I IFN response could be triggered by endogenous DNA species that are sensed by cGAS under steady-state conditions, during which they are present at levels that are below the threshold required for triggering disease pathology. At the same Box 1 | Cyclic dinucleotides in prokaryotes and metazoans 3\u0374-5\u0374,3\u0374-5\u0374-linked cyclic dinucleotides (CDNs) are common second messengers in bacteria. The first described and best-studied CDN is cyclic di-GMP (c-di-GMP) 80 . C-di-GMP is produced from GTP precursors by enzymes with GGDEF domains. From its original identification as an allosteric regulator of bacterial cellulose synthase more than 25 years ago, it is now known that the intracellular and local extracellular concentration of c-di-GMPs regulates numerous processes in bacteria. It also became evident that c-di-GMP is immunostimulatory 81, 82 and can inhibit cancer cell growth 83 , which suggested that this class of molecules has therapeutic potential. More recently, synthases for c-di-AMP and cyclic GMP-AMP (cGAMP) have been reported, expanding the range of prokaryotic CDNs. Key features of the currently known CDNs are listed below. time, in the context of cell damage that is inflicted by viral propagation or cell stress, it is possible that endogenous DNA species act as ligands for cGAS. In line with this hypothesis, it is interesting to note that several reports have ascribed the adjuvanticity of cell damage to the release and sensing of endogenous DNA species 59, 60 .",

Crystal structures of porcine cGAS 61 with transferase-trapping active site mutations defined the catalytic step that leads to the formation of the linear intermediate pppGp(2\u0374-5\u0374)A. GTP and ATP bind to the acceptor and donor pockets, respectively. The ATP donor nucleotide and its triphosphate moiety are positioned in such a way that the 2\u0374-OH of GTP can attack the \u03b1-phosphate of ATP. Structural studies using wild-type cGAS protein have revealed the subsequent steps of catalysis that occur in the cyclization reaction 41 . It seems that, before the second catalytic step, the linear dinucleotide intermediate (pppG(2\u0374-5\u0374)pA) needs to rebind in the reversed order -that is, GTP now occupies the donor pocket and 2\u0374-5\u0374-linked AMP occupies the acceptor pocket. In this setting, Figure 3 | Unified mechanism of nucleotidyl transfer by cGAS and OAS1 proteins. a | The mechanism for two-step nucleotidyl transfer in the formation of cyclic GMP-AMP (cGAMP) by cGAMP synthase (cGAS). Selected catalytically important residues, as well as two magnesium ions, are indicated. In particular, Glu225 and Asp227 bind the two magnesium ions that are crucial to orient and activate the donor triphosphate moiety. Asp319 polarizes the attacking 2\u0374-OH, and Tyr436 and Glu383 bind base and ribose, respectively. After the first catalytic step, the pppGp(2\u0374-5\u0374)A intermediate needs to dissociate and rebind in reverse order (swap) for the second catalytic step. Human cGAS numbering is used for the amino acid residues shown. b | Nucleotidyl transfer 1 by oligoadenylate synthase 1 (OAS1) is similar to that of cGAS. Instead of a nucleotide swap, as observed in cGAS, the product of nucleotidyl transfer 1 rebinds to the acceptor site only. In the beginning, the acceptor is ATP (in ATP acceptor, 'R' denotes diphosphate group), whereas in subsequent steps, during chain elongation, the acceptor is pppAp(2\u0374-5\u0374)A and longer 2\u0374-5\u0374-linked oligoadenylates ('R' denotes pppAp(2\u0374-5\u0374)A and longer chains). Human OAS1 numbering is used for the amino acid residues shown. Nature Reviews | Immunology the 3\u0374-OH of AMP attacks the \u03b1-phosphate of GTP, which is in keeping with the universal nucleotidyltransferase mechanism 72, 73 . The proposed reaction mode would result in a cGAMP product with guanine in the donor site and adenine in the acceptor site, which is indeed observed in a crystal structure 71 . Although cGAS is very specific for GTP as the acceptor, biochemical experiments have shown that, to some extent, it can tolerate GTP instead of ATP as a donor 41, 43 . Similarly, OAS enzymes selectively use nucleotides with an adenine base and a free 2\u0374-OH as the acceptor substrate, whereas any triphosphate nucleotide can be used as a donor 74 . It therefore seems that the triphosphate moiety in pppGp(2\u0374-5\u0374)A overrules the donor and acceptor specificities. Further work is necessary to decipher the timescale and nucleotide specificities of the different reaction states. On the basis of the available structures, it is possible to formulate unified activation and catalytic mechanisms for both cGAS and OAS1 (FIG. 3) .",

One possibility is that OAS1 simply suppresses the swapped binding of a pppA(2\u0374-5\u0374)pA intermediate. Moreover, we need to understand why dsDNA or dsRNA needs to be \u226550 base pairs in length to trigger efficient antiviral immunity through OAS1 and cGAS in vivo 27, 75, 76 . According to the crystal structures and biochemical analyses, the binding site of DNA on cGAS or dsRNA on OAS1 is much shorter and, in vitro, cGAS is partially activated by dsDNA that is 16 base pairs long and almost fully activated by dsDNA that is 20 base pairs long 71 . This lengthdependence in vivo cannot be explained by the structure of the cGAS dimer, which binds two shorter DNA molecules side-by-side, rather than one long DNA molecule. Thus, further work is necessary to understand the precise mode by which these two related sensors operate.",

OAS enzymes and cGAS belong to a much larger family of proteins that have a common nucleotidyltransferase structure 84, 85 . The OAS proteins constitute a well-defined subfamily within this superfamily 86, 87 . Human cGAS (also known as MB21D1) has been placed into the MAB21 family of proteins, which includes MAB21 domain-containing protein 2 (MB21D2), MAB21-like protein 1 (MAB21L1), MAB21L2 and MAB21L3. However, cGAS differs from other vertebrate MAB21 proteins in two important ways. The 'zinc thumb' motif is only present in cGAS and the remaining members of the vertebrate MAB21 family members lack some of the conserved active site residues that are required for catalysis. Interestingly, both insects and chordates have a potential cGAS homologue and MAB21 family member that seems to be catalytically active but does not contain the zinc thumb. It is plausible that OAS proteins and MAB21 proteins diverged earlier in evolution, and that cGAS evolved by the insertion of a zinc thumb motif into a pre-existing catalytically active MAB21-like ancestral protein. To clarify the evolutionary relationships, it will be important to reveal the functional mechanisms of other MAB21 proteins.",

To this end, a 5\u0374 exonuclease and a 2\u0374-5\u0374-specific phosphodiesterase activity had been described, yet the exact nature of the respective enzymes remains controversial. It is possible that enzymes with similar, if not overlapping, functions are present that prevent the accumulation of cGAMP in the cytosol.
