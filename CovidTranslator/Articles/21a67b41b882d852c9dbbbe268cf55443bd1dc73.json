Their cohort seemed to be at lower risk for sudden death than the Brugada registry, perhaps because of a selection bias in the latter group. Importantly, Eckardt did not find that electrophysiology study was useful for risk stratification. Indeed, such testing was negative in four of nine Brugada syndrome patients who eventually had clinical events.

I declare that I make an income from doing systematic reviews. The current epidemic of the highly pathogenic H5N1 strain of avian influenza, with a mortality of 58%, appears relentless in Asia, particularly in Vietnam and Thailand. 1 Although inefficient, there is some evidence of human-to-human transmission for the H5N1 virus. 2 A possible catastrophic pandemic could, therefore, emerge should re-assortment of viral antigens occur resulting in a highly infectious strain of H5N1. Influenza pandemics in 1917-18, 1957-58, and 1968-69 have already caused approximately 15, 4, and 0\u00b775 million deaths worldwide, respectively. A vaccine for H5N1 will not be available in the foreseeable months. Even if pharmaceutical manufacturing begins soon after an outbreak, there would not be a sufficient supply for the countries most in need-ie, the Asian nations. Antiviral drugs are consequently the only specific treatment, pending availability of effective vaccines. These include M2 inhibitors (amantadine and rimantadine), which are ineffective against H5N1 in vitro, and the neuraminidase inhibitors (oseltamivir and zanamivir). 3 The neuraminidase inhibitors reduce the severity and duration of symptoms, and prevent clinical influenza as post-exposure and seasonal prophylaxis. 4 Influenza contingency plans by the WHO and most governments generally advocate detection, isolation, staff protection, and the start of antiviral treatment for patients, and their contacts. 5 Many governments, including those of Hong Kong, Thailand, Singapore, Malaysia, and Korea, have already stockpiled, at a very substantial expense, vast quantities of oseltamivir to prepare for an outbreak. 5 Nonetheless, the efficacy of neuraminidase inhibitors, even for non-H5N1 influenza A in healthy people and taken within 48 h of disease onset, is only slight (table). [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] The use of oseltamivir in five of the ten cases reported in Vietnam did not show any obvious clinical efficacy, and the mortality was 80% in this cohort. 12 The two neuraminidase inhibitors, oseltamivir and zanamivir, have not been directly compared in controlled trials. Their pharmacological properties are compared in the table. [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] Although both have similar efficacy, zanamivir has fewer adverse reactions, and a favourable resistance profile. The resistance factor would be an important consideration in a pandemic situation. The reasons for zanamivir not being chosen for stockpiling might include concern that young children and patients with intellectual or coordination impairments would not be able to inhale zanamivir properly, although there are novel ways of giving the drug to children. 13 The occurrence of bronchospasm and reduced lung function is very rare, and patients with asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) seem to tolerate inhalation of zanamivir as well as the placebo. 14 The inhaled flow rate needed to give the custom-designed inhaler for zanamivir (49-110 L/min)",
