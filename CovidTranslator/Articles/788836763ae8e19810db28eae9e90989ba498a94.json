Only the emergence of a novel strain from Wuhan gave the word \"Coronavirus\" a new meaning. Before disease introduction, less than a half of surveyed Poles believed that corona virus is the most important topic in the second half of February 2020 (IBRIS [1] ). The disease was not detected in Poland until 03.03.2020, but this topic was relatively important already before introduction and started to drive media and social life after the disease introduction. During opinion poll performed on 09.03.2020 and 10.03.2020, 63% of respondents reported, that this is a serious threat for Poland, 40% that this is a serious threat for their family and 73% that this is a serious threat for the Polish Economy ( [2] ). We observe several small peaks of interest on the Internet for Coronavirus in Poland, although the largest surge in interest occurs after the official confirmation of the virus introduction to Poland .",

Especially, according to the results of empirical research (Taranowicz [46] ), society expects institutional activities and in the event of an epidemic, it is the \"state (...) that is responsible for the poor health of the population\". Perhaps one of the reasons the Chinese have been so successful in controlling the spread of the infection is that social media like Wechat (Wang et al. [47] , Zhang et al. [48] ), or Internet forums (Liu and Lu [49] ) were analyzed by algorithms (Lu et al. [50] , Paul and Dredze [51] , Salathe et al. [52] ) with a goal to mitigate the spread of COVID-19. Combining the behavior changes detected via social media analysis with the detailed information on human mobility via e.g. mobile phone tracking (Schneider et al. [53] ), sophisticated computational models of infectious disease spread could be implemented (Belik et al. [54] , Vespignani [55] ) allowing to simulate various scenarios and assess possible human and economic losses. Furthermore, impact of public information campaigns could be measured by internal surveys of public opinion. In addition, Internet media analysis could fill gaps in socio-medical research on collective actions during an important public health disruption event such as infectious diseases.

For example, at present, government mitigation programs or hygiene education principles published on Twitter fall into the information bubble or echo chambers of supporters of the ruling party [Fig. 7]. We provided a list of central accounts for each social platform, which have been active already before disease introduction. Lack of interest in general public ([42]) could be associated with a low epidemiological awareness of average Poles, especially when COVID-19 is massively discussed in traditional and social media by a relatively small but loud group of people.Before official disease introduction we observed in Poland two information phases related to outbreaks in China (the end of January) and in Italy (the second half of February) and one commentary and update phase in social media in the beginning of March related to, among others, the special act on COVID-19 mitigation [Fig. 9].
