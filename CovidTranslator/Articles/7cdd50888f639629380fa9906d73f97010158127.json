Enveloped viruses mimic apoptotic bodies by exposing PS on the outer leaflet of the 57 viral membrane. While TIM-1 has been shown to serve as an adherence factor/receptor for 58 filoviruses in tissue culture, limited studies have investigated the role of TIM-1 as a receptor in 59 vivo. Here, we sought to determine if TIM-1 was critical for Ebola virus glycoprotein-mediated 60 infection using a BSL2 model virus. We demonstrate that loss of TIM-1 expression results in 61 decreased virus load late during infection and significantly reduced virus-elicited mortality. 62 These findings provide evidence that TIM-1 serves as an important receptor for Ebola virus in 63 vivo. Blocking TIM-1/EBOV interactions may be effective antiviral strategy to reduce viral load 64 and pathogenicity at late times of EBOV infection. 65 66 .

Thus, we repeated VSV infections in 293 control and TIM-1 -/mice at a challenge dose of 10 1 iu to determine if subtle changes in virus 294 pathogenesis could be discerned. Even at this low dose, there was no difference in the survival in 295 the TIM-1 -/mice versus the control mice (Fig. 1D ). These results provide evidence that the 296 difference in EBOV GP/rVSV pathogenesis in BALB/c Ifnar -/and TIM-1 -/mice was due to the 297 presence of EBOV GP expressed in the recombinant VSV rather than other VSV genes. The 298 reduced pathogenesis of EBOV GP expressing virus in TIM-1 -/mice was consistent with 299 findings described by Younan et al. using maEBOV [34] . 300 301",

In parallel, levels of 311 infectious virus in liver, kidney, and adrenal gland were also significantly reduced. Studies at day 312 5 of infection also indicated that EBOV GP\u2206O/rVSV loads were much reduced in the brain of 313 TIM-1 -/mice and trended lower in the testis (Supplement Fig. 4A at days -1 and 2.

PS receptors do not interact with the viral 78 glycoprotein (GP), but bind to PS on the surface of the virion lipid membrane, causing 79 internalization of viral particles into the endosomal compartment [9,15]. This mechanism of 80 viral entry has been termed apoptotic mimicry [16]. Following endosomal uptake of filovirions, 81 proteolytic GP processing occurs, thereby allowing GP to interact with its endosomal cognate 82 receptor, Niemann Pick C1 [17-21]. 83 84 One important family of PS receptors is the T-cell immunoglobulin mucin domain (TIM) 85 family. TIM family members, encoded by the Havcr family of genes, contribute to the uptake 86 of apoptotic bodies to clear dying cells from tissues and the circulation [22-24]. TIM proteins 87 are type 1, cell surface glycoproteins. Three family members are present in humans (hTIM-1, 88 hTIM-3 and hTIM-4) and four in mice (TIM-1, TIM-2, TIM-3 and TIM-4) [25]. hTIM-1 was 89 pathogenesis. Consistent with reduced overall virus loads, proinflammatory chemokine profiles 136 were also lower in the EBOV GP/rVSV infected TIM-1-deficient mice at late time points 137 following infection. Finally, to directly evaluate whether enhanced survival and reduced 138 inflammation in TIM-1-deficient mice was associated with T cell activation as previously 139 reported [34], we depleted T cells in EBOV GP/rVSV infected TIM-1-sufficient or -deficient 140 mice and found that T cell depletion did not alter EBOV GP/rVSV pathogenesis. In total, our 141 studies provide evidence that TIM-1 associated pathogenesis correlated with enhanced virus 142 load at late times during infection, consistent with TIM-1 having an important role as a receptor 143 for EBOV in vivo. 144 Materials and Methods 145 146 Ethics statement 147 This study was conducted in strict accordance with the Animal Welfare Act and the 148 recommendations in the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals of the National 149 Institutes of Health (University of Iowa (UI) Institutional Assurance Number: #A3021-01).

Staining was done by incubating with anti-CD90 antibody in FACS buffer and 237 Fc block (2.4G2) for 30 minutes, washing 3 times to remove excess antibody, and detecting 238 fluorescence on a BD FACSCalibur. 239 Statistics 240 Statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism software (GraphPad Software, Inc.). 241 Results are shown as means or geometric means and standard error of the means (s.e.m.) or 242 geometric s.e.m., respectively, is shown where appropriate. Log-rank (Mantel-Cox) tests were 243 used to analyze differences in survival. In vivo experiments were performed at least in duplicate 244 with at least 8 mice total per treatment group.

This 256 mouse strain was used to study the role of TIM-1 in allergic airway diseases and Th2 responses 257 [35].

Homozygous BALB/c Ifnar/TIM-1 -/and Ifnar -/mice 262 (called TIM-1 -/and control mice, respectively, throughout the remainder of this study) were used 263 for all infections. Challenge virus was administered intravenously since this route of delivery 264 mimics a primary route of EBOV transmission, blood-to-blood contact. Control and TIM-1 -/-265 mice were challenged with the lowest dose of virus that produced predictable death in control 266 mice in 5-7 days (Supplemental Fig. 1). Minor titer variations were observed between virus 267 stocks and dosages were adjusted accordingly. 268 269 We challenged the TIM-1 -/and control mice with full length EBOV GP/rVSV or EBOV 270 GP\u2206O/rVSV, which has the GP1 mucin like domain (MLD) deleted. EBOV GP\u2206O 271 pseudovirions and recombinant viruses have the same tropism as virus bearing EBOV GP [8,38-272 40]. Use of both viruses in these studies allowed us to determine if the elimination of the mucin 273domain altered the pathogenesis associated with in vivo challenge with these viruses. As 274 expected, TIM-1-sufficient control mice succumbed to EBOV GP/rVSV or EBOV GP\u2206O/rVSV 275 between days 4-7 of infection (Fig. 1A and B). By contrast, TIM-1 -/mice challenged with the 276 same dose had significantly reduced mortality following EBOV GP/rVSV or EBOV 277 GP\u2206O/rVSV infection and delayed time-to-death of those that did succumb to infection. Weight 278 loss associated with infection in the TIM-1 -/mice were also significantly reduced at some days 279 (data not shown). These findings indicate that TIM-1 -/mice had improved survival when 280 infected with EBOV GP/rVSV compared to controls and that survival was not affected by the 281 presence of the GP1 MLD.",

            "text": "and B), consistent with an 314 overall reduction in virus load in the TIM-1 -/mice at late times during infection. Thus, reduced 315 virus replication in a number of organs was associated with the survival observed in TIM-1 -/-316 mice. These findings provide evidence that TIM-1 expression is important for the generation of 317 high viral load in some organs at late times in infection. 318 319 Viral loads in the spleen and lungs were not affected by the loss of TIM-1 (Fig. 2 and 320 Supplemental Fig. 4C). The viral burden in the spleen was significantly higher at day 1 than in 321 any other organ assessed and remained high in both mouse strains throughout the course of 322 infection with a peak in titers occurring at day 3. These results are consistent with previous 323 studies that implicate spleen in early and sustained EBOV replication [42-44]. Lung titers were 324 not significantly different between the control and TIM-1 -/mice at 5 days following infection. 325 This result was somewhat unexpected as we had previously demonstrated robust hTIM-1 326 expression on the apical surface airway epithelial cells [8]. As TIM-1 was not observed to be 327 expressed on the basolateral side of lung epithelium, TIM-1 may be important for entry of 328 aerosolized EBOV entry into a host, but may not influence basolateral infection of lung via expressing mice exhibit elevated levels of specific proinflammatory chemokines 332 following EBOV GP/rVSV infection 333 Elevated proinflammatory and immunomodulatory cytokines and chemokines are evident in 334 serum and infected organs during EBOV infection of animal models and patients [45-51]. To 335 determine if reduced virus load in TIM-1-deficient mice at late time points was associated with 336 lower RNA expression profiles of selected, well-characterized cytokines, levels in the spleen, 337 liver and kidney were examined prior to and following EBOV GP\u2206O/rVSV infection. Organs 338 were harvested at day 3 and 5 following infection and total RNA was isolated and amplified for 339 the mRNA of the housekeeping gene, HPRT, and the cytokines IL-6, TNF, IL-12 and IL-10. 340 Cytokine expression levels were normalized against HPRT expression. Overall, baseline values 341 of the organ cytokine expression from uninfected control and TIM-1 -/mice were low with little 342 difference between the strains (Fig. 3). While at day 5 TNF was significantly higher in spleen of 343 control mice, in general during the infection cytokine expression was variable within groups and 344 levels were not significantly different between the two strains of mice. 345 346 Elevated levels of several chemokines and growth factors have been implicated in fatal EBOV 347 disease outcomes including MIP-1\u03b1, MIP-1\u03b2, MCP-1, M-CSF, MIF, IP-10, GRO-\u03b1 and eotaxin 348 [49]. Therefore, we analyzed control and TIM-1 -/organs following EBOV GP\u2206O/rVSV 349 infection for the chemokines, CXCL10 (IP-10) and CCL2 (MCP-1). At least one of the two 350 chemokine transcripts in all three organs was elevated in the control mice at both day 3 and/or 5 351 of infection compared to the TIM-1 -/mouse tissues (Fig. 4). In combination with our survival 352 and viral burden results, these observations suggest that the presence of TIM-1 in mice 353 depletion does not alter morbidity associated with EBOV GP/rVSV infection 358 TIM-1 is expressed by a range of hematopoietic and non-hematopoietic cells [52]. This study 359showed that virus load in spleen, an organ rich in hematopoietic cells, was not affected by the 360 loss of TIM-1 expression, suggesting that it might be TIM-1 expression on non-hematopoietic 361 cells late during infection that affects EBOV GP/rVSV load and survival. As others have 362 suggested that TIM-1 on T cell subsets may contribute to enhanced EBOV pathogenesis [34], we 363 depleted T cells in control and TIM-1 -/mice to assess outcomes during EBOV GP/rVSV 364 infection. Mice were intraperitoneally administered \u03b1-CD8 mAb, 2.43, and \u03b1-CD4 mAb, GK1.5, 365",

            "text": "). These data provide evidence that the presence of T cells does not alter the course of this 372 acute infection and suggests that TIM-1 expression on non-T cell populations contributes to 373 pathogenesis. 374Discussion 375Here, we show that loss of TIM-1 expression decreased overall mortality and delayed time-to-376 those mice that do succumb when challenged with EBOV GP/rVSV. The impact on 377 survival of TIM-1 expression was similar with rVSV bearing MLD-deleted EBOVGP,  378    indicating that the presence of the MLD did not affect the observed pathogenesis. Consistent 379 with the enhanced survival of the TIM-1-deficient mice following virus challenge, we show that 380 these mice also had reduced infectious virus in liver, kidney and adrenal gland at late times 381 during infection. EBOV replication in these organs is well established and is thought to 382 contribute to overall EBOV load [42, 53-55]. The lower virus load in these organs of the TIM-383 1 -/mice was also reflected in a ~100-fold reduction in serum viremia at day 5 of infection. The 384 reduced pathology in our TIM-1-deficient mice was EBOV GP-dependent since survival 385 associated with G/rVSV infection was unaffected by TIM-1 expression. Thus, our studies 386 indicate that the glycoprotein present on the virions was responsible for the TIM-1-dependent 387 changes in virus load and mouse survival. 388 389 Interestingly, we did not observe that all organs previously implicated as important in EBOV 390 infection had lower virus load in TIM-1 -/mice. Splenic viral loads were at high throughout 391 infection in both control and TIM-1 -/mice. These data suggested that TIM-1 expressing cells 392 do not appreciably contribute to splenic virus loads and that splenic loads can be high in mice 393 without those animals necessarily succumbing to infection. 394 395 While the TIM-1 does not interact directly with EBOV GP, the binding of TIM-1 to virion-396 associated PS has been shown to elicit viral particle entry into the endosomal compartment 397[9,15] where EBOV GP is proteolytically processed, binds to NPC1 and mediates membrane 398 fusion [17,18,20,21,56-58]. Filoviral particle entry into endosomes occurs through interactions 399 of other cell surface receptors in tissue culture. However, these studies and those 400 by Younan, et al [34] demonstrate that in vivo at least one receptor, TIM-1, is not redundant 401 with other receptors, but uniquely contributes to EBOV pathogenesis. Future studies to evaluate 402 the role of additional host receptors implicated in EBOV entry would provide valuable insights 403 to the potential receptor redundancy. These receptors include other TIM family members, TAM 404 tyrosine kinase receptors and C-type lectins. 405 406 The correlation between enhanced survival and reduced viral loads in the TIM-1 -/mice 407 suggests that TIM-1 serves as a virus receptor for EBOV in some organs late during infection. 408 Likely, late cell targets that express TIM-1 would include kidney epithelial cells [59] and 409 epithelial cells in other organs [8]. Surprisingly, decreased virus load was not observed in an 410 earlier study that challenged TIM-1 -/mice with maEBOV [34]. Instead, the authors reported 411 that the genome copy number in plasma did not significantly differ in TIM-1-sufficient and -412 deficient mice. However, in this study, virus load was shown from a single time point during 413 infection. The discrepancy between our findings and the previous study may be due to the 414 tissues examined and/or the timing of the sampling. 415 416 The physiological role of TIM-1 has been extensively studied. Agonistic monoclonal antibody 417 binding to TIM-1 on CD4 + T, iNKT and splenic B cells induces cellular activation in a wide 418 range of organisms from zebrafish to humans [24,32,33,59-61]. This observation has led to the 419 understanding that TIM-1 serves as a costimulatory molecule on these cells and leads to 420 upregulation of cytokines in T and iNKT cells [24,59], as well as antibody production by B 421 cells [61]. In contrast, transient TIM-1 expression on injured kidney epithelial cells serves an 422 chemokine dysregulation [34]. Yet proinflammatory cytokines were only 426 modestly altered in our studies even at late times during infection in TIM-1-sufficient mice. We 427 did observe elevated levels of the proinflammatory chemokines, CCL2 and CXCL10, in the 428 TIM-1-sufficient mice compared to the deficient mice and postulated that the higher levels of 429 chemokines in TIM-1 + mice may reflect the innate immune responses stimulated by the higher 430 virus load. Alternatively, as postulated by Younan, et al., the elevated chemokine profile and 431 associated mortality in the TIM-1 + mice might be due to a TIM-1-dependent cytokine storm 432 elicited by T cells [34]. We tested this latter possibility by virus challenge of T cell-depleted 433 mice. T cell depletion did not alter EBOV GP/rVSV pathology. Significantly greater mortality 434 was associated with virus infection of TIM-1-sufficient mice which were depleted for T cells 435 than T cell-depleted, TIM-1-deficient mice, suggesting that T cells are not responsible for the 436 reduced survival of TIM-1-sufficient mice. Hence, our findings do not support the conclusion 437 that TIM-1 expression on T cells plays a significant role in the pathology associated with and studies performed by Younan et al. [34] delivered EBOV GP/rVSV 441 intravenously. In studies not shown, we observed that intraperitoneal (i.p.) delivery of EBOV 442 GP/rVSV or maEBOV into WT versus TIM-1 -/mice was equally pathogenic. This finding may 443 be explained by the previous observation that another TIM family member, TIM-4, is highly 444 expressed on resident peritoneal macrophages [63] and is used as a receptor for EBOV [27]. 445 also demonstrate that TIM-1 is not important for WT VSV pathogenesis. Due to the 449 wide cellular tropism of VSV, ubiquitous cell lipid components like PS, phosphatidylinositol or 450 the ganglioside GM3 were originally proposed as the VSV cell surface receptor [64-66]. 451 However, more recent investigations have revealed that these lipids are not readily used as VSV 452 cell surface receptors [67,68]. Instead, the LDL receptor and its family members are proposed 453 to serve as VSV receptors on human and mouse cells [41]. Therefore, in vivo pathogenesis 454 induced by VSV would differ from EBOV GP/rVSV since the dependence on LDL receptors 455 for entry is conferred by the VSV G glycoprotein [41]. Presumably the VSV membrane 456 contains PS that can interact with TIM-1, but the affinity of VSV G for LDL receptors is likely 457 greater than the affinity of PS in the virion envelope towards PS receptors like TIM-1. Studies 458 from our lab have shown that only when the high affinity interactions of Lassa virus GP with its 459 receptor, \u03b1-dystroglycan, are abrogated does TIM-1 mediate Lassa virus pseudovirion entry 460 [69]. Future studies would be valuable to assess the ability of VSV to utilize TIM-1 as a cell 461 surface receptor in the absence of expression of LDL receptors. 462 463 Liver and kidney dysfunction and necrosis are integral aspects of EBOV pathology of humans, 464 NHPs [3,70] and mice [71,72].Our studies indicate that TIM-1 expression is associated with 465 elevated viral loads in the liver, kidney, adrenal gland, and brain since loss of TIM-1 466 significantly lowered viral burden in these organs. Future studies will need to explore the 467 impact that TIM-1 expression has on EBOV infection of specific cells within these organs. By 468",
