Many scientists argue that it is only a matter of time until the next influenza pandemic occurs. 1 Outbreaks may stem from variations of known diseases, such as with the influenza virus, or from newly recognized pathogens, such as Legionnaire's disease, HIV/AIDS, and Hantavirus. Because of their potentially high mortality rates, uncertain modes of transmission, and possibly ineffective protective measures and equipment, these and other infectious diseases generate immense fear among both the general population and health care workers.",

            "text": "Infectious disease risks are an unavoidable result of caring for patients in emergency medicine because many of those infected do not manifest typical signs or symptoms of their diseases. More than 15 types of airborne infections have been transmitted to health care workers, including tuberculosis, varicella, measles, influenza, and respiratory syncytial virus. These cause significant morbidity and occasional mortality. 2 The recent severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak, for example, claimed the lives of many health care workers, including that of Carlo Urbani, the World Health Organization physician who investigated the initial outbreak and raised worldwide alarm. 3 In our global society with rapid international travel, traditional public health measures such as quarantine and isolation may not contain many identified illnesses. The highprofile case of a US lawyer who flew commercially to Europe with presumed extensively-drug-resistant tuberculosis is a case in point. 4 Extensively-drug-resistant tuberculosis now has been reported in 17 countries, including 4% of all tuberculosis cases in the United States. 5 Emergency physicians, nurses, and emergency medical services (EMS) personnel have often been the first source for medical treatment not only when pandemic or unknown infectious diseases appear but also during bioterrorism threats, such as the 2001 anthrax cases. Historically, bioterrorism events have been localized, resulting in few illnesses and deaths. Yet, unlike most natural disasters, they engender widespread fear and, as with pandemics, may cause health care workers to consider their own risks. Without these first responders, social stability could deteriorate as the public learns that health care workers are abandoning their professional roles. Thus, how health care workers respond during a crisis may have broad social consequences and so must be an element of any comprehensive disaster planning strategy.",

That is unclear, at least to US bioterrorism experts, who have little confidence in health care professionals' willingness to remain at work in the face of danger. For example, military and public health strategists designed 2 pre-September 11 bioterrorism simulation exercises, \"TOPOFF\" (plague) and \"Dark Winter\" (smallpox), with the assumption that most health professionals would not report to work if faced with a high risk of infection. 6 A pre-September 11 survey of all of Hawaii's licensed physicians and nurses suggested that, although most would stay and work after a natural disaster, only about half of each group would remain during an epidemic threat. 7 In a more recent survey of 6,428 health care workers in New York City, willingness to work during a disaster varied with the type of event, ranging from a high of 84% during a mass casualty incident to a low of 48% during a SARS outbreak. 8 A review of the historical record shows that, although many physicians have fled, many others have chosen to stay at their jobs despite great personal danger.",

            "text": "When the Antonine Plague struck Rome in the second century CE, Galen, physician to Emperor Marcus Aurelius and the father of Western medicine, fled for his life. Once safely away from the city, he feared that the emperor would drag him back in chains for his cowardice. Ashamed, he later wrote elaborate excuses and apologies for his actions. 9 Other physicians acted more courageously in caring for plague victims. Thucydides wrote that when the Plague of Athens struck in the fifth century BCE during the Peloponnesian War, \"Physicians . . . died themselves the most thickly, as they visited the sick most often.\" 10 Between one third and one half of Europe's population succumbed to the Black Death (Yersinia pestis), which first struck in the 14th century and returned intermittently until the 17th century. So many physicians fled that some municipalities appointed specific \"pest-doctors,\" who were contractually obligated to remain during epidemics; other areas were forced to enact laws forbidding physicians to leave during epidemics. 11 When the Great Plague struck London from 1665 to 1666, Sydenham (of \"Chorea\" fame) and a few others fled, but many more, such as Glisson (of the \"Capsule\") and Wharton (of the \"Duct\"), stayed. A lesser-known physician, William Boghurst, stayed to treat his patients, writing: \"Every man that undertakes to bee [sic] of a profession or takes upon himself an office must take all parts of it, the good and the evil, the pleasure and the pain, the profit and the inconveniences all together and not pick and choose; for Ministers must preach, Captains must fight and Physicians attend upon the sick.\" 12 Similarly, when the dreaded yellow fever struck Philadelphia in 1773, Dr. Benjamin Rush, a prominent physician and a signer of the Declaration of Independence, wrote to his wife, \"It would be as much your duty not to desert me in that situation, as it is mine not to desert my patients.\" 13 Likewise, in 1918, physicians stayed at their jobs during the great influenza pandemic that followed World War I, and many perished. 14 During the 1980s and 1990s, some physicians refused to treat patients afflicted with HIV/AIDS because of the social stigma and the medical risks attached to this disease that, at the time, was uniformly fatal. 15 Yet, when a new illness (ultimately found to be the previously unknown Hantavirus) began killing people on New Mexico's Navaho reservation, emergency physicians, among others, continued to treat patients despite the risks. 16 And when SARS struck Asia and Canada in the early 2000s, most physicians and other health care professionals stayed to treat their patients. 17",

            "text": "Inspired by Thomas Percival, the American Medical Association's (AMA) first Code of Medical Ethics, published in 1847, was visionary in addressing issues of personal risk when rendering service during epidemics. In fact, the AMA was the first to state boldly that \". . . when pestilence prevails, it is [physicians'] duty to face the danger, and continue their labors for the alleviation of suffering, even at the jeopardy of their own lives.\" 18 This strong and largely unprecedented statement helped formalize a sense of physician duty that was sustained until the 1950s and 1960s, when, as the domestic threats of smallpox, polio, and related epidemics dissipated, such heroic statements vanished from the AMA Code. 13, 19 Decades later, the HIV threat motivated changes in the code that were less inspired. In 1986, language was added suggesting that treating HIV-positive patients was required only if the physician was \"emotionally able to do so.\" 20 This self-serving stance was ridiculed, however, and within 6 months the AMA approved a revised statement: \"A physician may not ethically refuse to treat a patient whose condition is within the physician's current realm of competence solely because the patient is seropositive.\" 13 More recently, the events of September 11, 2001 , and the subsequent anthrax scare ushered in the AMA's new \"Social Contract with Humanity,\" including a Declaration of Professional Responsibility that contains a statement on personal risk reminiscent of the AMA's 1847 Code: \"We, the members of the world community of physicians, solemnly commit ourselves to . . . apply our knowledge and skills when needed, though doing so may put us at risk.\" 21 Of course, all physicians do not subscribe to the AMA Code of Ethics, and many emergency physicians rely instead on the American College of Emergency Physicians' (ACEP) Code of Ethics. Developed in 1996, the ACEP Code of Ethics specifically addresses a commitment to open access to all who seek emergency services. The first 2, and arguably most important, of the Principles of Ethics for Emergency Physicians read, \"Emergency physicians shall . . . embrace patient welfare as their primary professional responsibility . . . [and] . . . respond promptly and expertly, without prejudice or partiality, to the need for emergency medical care.\" 22 These principles underscore an emergency physician's responsibility to put patient welfare first and to treat all, regardless of their presenting problem. Such principles from organized emergency medicine may have helped inspire more patient-centered versions of the AMA Code. The 2001 preamble to the AMA Code, for example, states that \"a physician must recognize responsibility to patients first and foremost, as well as to society, to other health professionals, and to self.\" 23, 24 Ethics codes of the Society for Academic Emergency Medicine, the Emergency Medical Residents' Association, and the Emergency Nurses' Association do not directly address this issue.",

Consider, for example, a singlemother emergency physician or emergency nurse whose 3 young children are home when schools close during a pandemic.

If, for example, an epidemic disease is easily transmissible by casual contact and the case-fatality rate is initially considered to be 50%, would health care workers be duty-bound to accept that risk? 27 Health care professionals arguably are not required to assume suicidal risks to care for patients, but there appears to be no uncontroversial way to establish a threshold at which risk acceptance becomes a duty.",

An appeal to virtue ethics typically suggests that physicians should practice self-effacement, placing their patients' interests ahead of their own. 28 By extension, this means placing their duty to patients above their duty to family members and, to some extent, above even their own safety. We recognize, however, that an appeal to moral duties may not be persuasive to many health care workers during a pandemic.

During the SARS epidemic in Toronto, most physicians stayed at their posts, but some acknowledged that their fear of personal risk made them stay away, saying \"I didn't sign up for this,\" and \"They don't pay me enough to take this kind of risk.\" 17 During the SARS epidemic in Vietnam and Hong Kong, although most physicians stayed at work, similar fears among health care workers had some hospitals working with half the usual staff. 29 In the sometimes risky chaos of 2005's Hurricane Katrina, 75% of emergency physicians in the affected areas continued to treat patients at their hospitals for more than 1 week after the hurricane hit, and another 18% stayed for 5 to 7 days. 30 Self-preservation and fear are powerful and useful human motivators.

One of the first rules of EMS providers, for example, is to establish scene safety and thus prevent the responder from becoming another patient. Many EMS personnel ignored this rule in the face of the World Trade Center bombing-8 of the initial 400 who responded died; many have subsequently had related illnesses. 31 The question, then, is what should trigger designating a perceived risk as required, permissible, or foolhardy? Moreover, how can emergency physicians hope to identify these tipping points when, for example, the number of pandemic victims in their community is increasing, and rumors and hearsay outnumber facts and evidence? A Hawaiian study lends credence to the way physicians measure personal risk. Although those with more knowledge were more likely, in general, to volunteer to help, their willingness diminished as the personal risk increased. For example, in a natural disaster, 83% said they would volunteer to help; after an explosion, 67%; after a chemical incident, 59%; after biological incident or contagious epidemic, 56%; and after a radiological event, just 52%. Responses from nurses approximated those of physicians. 7 Fear is commonly thought of as a deterrent, but it can also act as a motivator. Physicians may fear the shame or social ostracism that results from abandoning patients. Emergency physicians, in particular, may feel a greater sense of responsibility and commitment to the community because of their unique skill set. 32 Health care personnel may also fear the shame of abandoning their colleagues in a time of crisis. For many emergency medicine professionals, the ED represents a place of mutual support, and they may naturally gravitate there in times of crisis. Should they abdicate their responsibilitiesregardless of their reasons for doing so-they may not be able to return to work when the crisis passes and still command the same level of respect from their peers, their staff, their patients, and even themselves.",

This was certainly seen during the SARS epidemic, when health care professionals regarded patient care as part of their professional obligation, despite the perception of great personal risk. 17 Societies and health care institutions can strengthen the moral grounds for a duty to care (and encourage health care professionals to embrace this duty) by embracing reciprocal duties to protect and support professionals in crisis situations. Such reciprocal duties could include guaranteeing access to appropriate personal protective equipment, prophylaxis for the inciting agent, family support, mental health support, and health care, if needed.

Similarly, physicians and other health care professionals who are asked to assume new tasks during a disaster will not be required to demonstrate the same level of expertise as would be expected in normal circumstances. 27 However, some health care workers might break their contractual duties to their employers if they were to fail to report to work and, therefore, might be subject to adverse actions by their employers. They could even be fired, as were many New Orleans police officers who abandoned their posts during Hurricane Katrina. 36 Physicians who bravely cared for patients during recent risk-prone crises were called \"heroes\" not because their actions were generally expected or legally required but because they were beyond the call of duty.",

Frequent \"hype\" and incomplete or false information has led to a conclusion that, in many cases, \"epidemics rage more in the media than in reality.\" 14 Fear can also be augmented or allayed, depending on the public's perception that the government is being forthcoming and honest. 38 In China, for example, the government did not release information about the extent of the SARS outbreak until months after the initial events.",

Appropriate risk communication should provide sufficient, credible information to help the entire community accurately assess the risks in crisis situations. Effective risk communication can also enhance health care workers' participation during a pandemic or other risk-prone disaster. The audiences are the media (who can then more accurately disseminate information), health care professionals, staff, and the public. Although national health agencies have developed plans for risk communication at the national, regional, and local levels, few communities, hospitals, or local EMS agencies have such plans. [39] [40] [41] People naturally exaggerate the risk of phenomena that are unknown or \"dreaded,\" such as those with delayed, irreversible or manmade effects; that have new, unknown, or unobservable risks; or that are global. They also exaggerate the risks of phenomena \"hyped\" by the media. Conversely, people tend to play down risks with which they are familiar. In crises, risk communication helps health care workers and the public identify the actual risks to themselves and their loved ones and understand what others are doing and what they can do to avoid risk. 42 Specific risk communication methods help fearful populations to hear, understand, and remember messages better, including delivering no more than 3 brief, clear messages in their order of importance; repeating key messages; and using clear visual aids or demonstrations to help clarify the information (video is available online at http://www. annemergmed.com). 43 Senior clinicians in the ED and EMS can use risk communication strategies and also model behavior at the bedside, for example, demonstrating their belief that the protective measures in place are effective. They can also articulate the essential role that members of the health care team play in responding to a disaster. Many nonprofessionals in Toronto's SARS epidemic failed to show up to work because they believed that they were not valued or given important information (S. H. Gray, oral communication, 2005) . 44 This is paralleled by a recent study in Maryland, which found that 46% of the public health workers surveyed would be unlikely to report for work during a pandemic: one third said it was because they would not play an important role. 45 Crisis leaders should emphasize the vital role of all health care workers so that health care facilities and systems will have enough people available to function effectively.",

If a negative phrase is used, at least 3 positive statements should follow to balance it. 46, 47 Successful risk communication also requires that a consistent, trusted spokesperson deliver the message. In fear-producing crises, people will not listen to the message unless they think that the person delivering the message cares about them, so the spokesperson must be seen as caring and empathetic, which listeners determine in the first 30 seconds after they begin speaking. 48 Spokespeople also must be seen as experts who are competent, honest, and dedicated. Risk communication should be implemented with multiple communication methods, including press releases; press conferences; public meetings, if safe; newspaper interviews; live interviews on radio, television, and the Internet; telephone banks; e-mail messages; Web sites; flyers; and fact sheets. Institutions and organizations should also use their public announcement systems, closed intranet systems, in-house television systems, and employee hotlines to communicate risks. 43 Behavior modeling is a special type of risk communication. Senior emergency physicians should be the models for all emergency medicine personnel in reporting for work, doing their jobs, and not overreacting to the situation. Because emergency medicine personnel look to senior emergency physicians for their leadership and counsel, their absence says to the emergency medicine team, \"Do not go to work; it's not safe.\" The fact that emergency physicians are at their posts may give them the moral authority to control their ED and its plight during a disaster and may factor into the entire team's \"sway to stay.\"",

The lack of adequate routes into the medical care system has also resulted in an increase in ED use and an increased illness severity of the patients being treated in EDs. 49 Major disasters could quickly overwhelm the already limited excess capacity of the health care system. Emergency physicians would then confront difficult challenges in expanding capacity and in triaging patients. Recent experiences with SARS, anthrax, and Hantavirus suggest we will have enough physicians who remain to treat patients, even if they are at significant risk. Whether this occurs during the next crisis may depend, in large measure, on preparing in advance to ameliorate risks to health care workers and on using methods to reduce stress by communicating effectively during and after the crisis. Public health departments, EMS agencies, hospitals, and EDs should develop plans to address foreseeable major health care crises. As this article has suggested, how emergency physicians respond to crises will depend on several factors, including their risk perception, willingness to accept risk, and ethical imperatives grounded in professional codes, personal values, and virtue.",
