Till the current times, researchers have been able to design numerous types of nanoscale fluorescent tool kits for monitoring protein-protein interactions through real time cellular imagery in a fluorescence microscope. It is apparent that supplementing any protein of interest with a fluorescence habit traces its function and regulation within a cell. Our review therefore highlights the application of several fluorescent probes such as molecular organic dyes, quantum dots (QD) and fluorescent proteins (FPs) to determine activity state, expression and localization of proteins in live and fixed cells. The focus is on Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET) based nanosensors that have been developed by researchers to visualize and monitor protein dynamics and quantify metabolites of diverse nature. FRET based toolkits permit the resolution of ambiguities that arise due to the rotation of sensor molecules and flexibility of the probe. Achievements of live cell imaging and efficient spatiotemporal resolution however have been possible only with the advent of fluorescence microscopic technology, equipped with precisely sensitive automated softwares.",

            "text": "Fluorescence is a luminescence process in which atoms and molecules absorb a specific lower wavelength light and after a brief gap of fluorescence lifetime emit a longer wavelength light. Over the past many years in the service of biology, fluorescence microscopy has emerged as the prime pillar of microscopy due to its inherent selectivity to expose only objects of interest against black background [1] . To investigate myriad of cellular processes, fluorescence imaging has been realistic for the visualization of molecules and whole organisms. It started with the attachment of organic dyes to proteins through antibodies and later sought the genetic tagging of target proteins with fluorescent proteins. However, the linking of antibodies has to be supplemented with the fixation and permeabilization of cells [2] . With the efficacy of fluorophores as direct recognition agents for various cellular molecules like nucleic acids, ions and other cell organelles, the technique of immuno-fluorescence became less valuable. Additionally, with the development of FRET based sensors, noninvasive behavior and live cell imaging in both prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells proved to be a novelty for researchers exploring fluorescent probes for real time cellular imaging. Originally, FRET stands for Forster Resonance Energy Transfer in the honour of Theodor Forster, physical chemist, who first discovered and understood it. The term \"fluorescence resonance energy transfer\" is often used, when both the chromophores are fluorescent. The latter enjoys common usage in scientific literature and has been in practice as such commonly.",

In recent years, using newly engineered photo-controllable fluorescent proteins; numerous super-resolution microscopic techniques became ready to use in order to get better visualization of objects having dimensions smaller than 500 nm and 200 nm in axial and lateral directions, respectively. In current times, researchers are now powerfully aided with more precisely optimized FPs. There are three groups of photo-controllable FPs-photo-convertible FPs (PCFPs), photoactivatable FPs (PAFPs), and reversibly photoswitchable FPs (rsFPs). PAFPs are activated from non-fluorescent (dark) to fluorescent state, whereas, rsFPs are reversibly photoswitched between inactive and active states, and PCFPs are made to convert from original color to another. The super-resolution microscopic imaging using these FPs is always carried out by controllably turning them on and off [4] .",

By combining such peptide substrates with appropriate FPs, researchers develop a chimeric protein and then sequentially analyze many protease inhibitors through FRET disruption.

For histological studies, probes possessing long excitation and emission wavelengths are utilized to display auto-fluorescence at short excitation wavelengths.

For this purpose, addition of electrophiles or other charged substituents like sulfonates, conjugation of double bonds, extra ring rigidification by locking rotatable rings into parent ring structures, etc. are some of the most important assignments. Though the dyes made by such strategies are now available commercially (Haugland, 2005) , however, such dyes are handicapped by being non-specific to all proteins. Therefore, their use in permeabilized and fixed cells has to be supplemented with antibodies ( Fig. 2A) .

The major confrontations to overcome lies in optimized intracellular delivery of fluorophores, the perfect labeling of target biomolecule and negligible cytotoxicity. Due to smaller size of organic fluorophores there is least spatial hindrance to impede with functioning of target biomolecule. Therefore, this opportunity has been explored by attaching many fluorescent probes with a single target biomolecule in order to gather maximum fluorescence signal. Because of high label densities the strong electrostatic repulsion between neighboring molecules, the dye structural conformation and hydrophilicity altogether can cause fluorescence quenching [5] [6] [7] and may also affect functioning of the biomolecule [8] .",

In this scenario, localized deposition of proteins in proteostasis has been elaborately exploited to develop sensors for understanding the mechanism of protein deposition in neurodegenerative disease progression [10] . The process of proteostatis involves biogenesis, traffic and protein degradation within and outside a cell, involving different integrated biological pathways. The basis of such a designed fluorescent probe is that most of the ligand binding sites in proteins are hydrophobic, that constitute the prime thermodynamic driving force for the binding of small molecule ligands to their respective proteins. This approach has been exploited to develop a precious turn on folding sensor for effective live cell monitoring of proteostatis [11] . This small fluorogenic molecule became fluorescent when it binds and reacts with folded and functional retroaldolase enzyme. Recently, in a similar approach, dual signal fluorescence-enhanced sensor, based on Cu 2+ mediated fluorescence switchable strategy has been designed to detect Cysteine (Cys) in a simple and fast way. It was observed that two fluorescence emissions of ultrathin films (calcein@NFR/LDHs UTFs) are effec- tively quenched by Cu 2+ (off state), and then reversibly recovered by Cys (on state), leading to the specific coordination of Cys and Cu 2+ [12] . Similarly, a novel, simple and rapid fluorescent probe based on excited-state intramolecular proton transfer (ESIPT) was the latest addition to such Turn On sensors, allowing easy way detection and quantification of biothiols in living cells [13] .",

In real sense, it is the high affinity interaction of arsenic for thi-ols that forms the basis of biarsenical labeling technology. The fluorescent derivative FlAsH contains two arsenic atoms at a set distance from each other. Similarly, ReAsH is modified to contain resorufin. With the aid of fluorescence microscopy, FlAsH and ReAsH technology has been exploited to bind to tetracysteine (TC) sequences. The common TC sequence employed for this purpose is the six aminoacid sequence Cys-Cys-Pro-Gly-Cys-Cys. When bound to ethane dithiol (EDT), both FlAsH and ReAsH are non-fluorescent. Thus, upon binding with recombinant proteins containing such a tetracysteine motif, both these biarsenical labeling reagents-FlAsH-EDT and ReAsH-EDT turn to become highly fluorescent with green or red color respectively, with subsequent displacement of EDT.",

In a similar approach, a sensitive electrochemical lead ion sensor was developed for lead (Pb 2+ ) ion detection.

Compared to other fluorophores, QDs possess 10-100 times higher extinction coefficients and better quantum yields [18] . Here, a lone excitation wavelength readily excites the QDs of numerous emission spectra. QDs are preferably developed with coatings for biological investigations to facilitate their solubility in aqueous medium, help in conjugation with antibodies and prevents quenching by water [19, 20] . However, QD conjugated biomolecules lack efficient migration potential through intact cellular membranes due to their larger size, and thus, their expenditure for endocytosed proteins or extracellular apartments, permeabilized cells is restricted. Remarkable about QDs is their tolerance to repetitive imaging of solitary molecules, by virtue of their photo-stability [21] . The portable electron-density and size permits analogous electron microscopy to be used for visualization of different objects of interest.

Many interactions are exploited to achieve QD fluorophore labeling with target biomolecules. Some major linking methods include-covalent linkages, biotin-avidin interactions and poly-histidine tags. Compared to small organic fluorophores, many biomolecules are attached to a single QD [22] which leads to problematic orientation (Fig. 2C ). On the other hand, because of the better cell and organelle permeability of aryl fluorosulphates, they have been employed for the development of protein-selective covalent probes. In this scenario, an environment sensitive fluorogenic probe, 1,3,4-oxadiazole has been designed to bind selectively to transthyretin (TTR). Addition of this fluorogenic probe to HEK293T cells allowed efficient binding and imaging of cellular organelles like mitochondria and endoplasmic reticulum, making it a new fluorescent tool for living cells [23] . Upon application of this fluorogenic probe in Caenorhabditis elegans, it successfully detected TTR in six macrophage like cells.",

Single GFP based sensors or chimeric FRET based nanosensors generate visible fluorescence for microscopic imagery. FRET involves the transfer of non-radiative energy from donor fluorophore to acceptor fluorophore, in the presence of a ligand. Such novel approach has been utilized to develop chimeric proteins that serve as nanosensors. These FRET based nanosensors consist of cyan fluorescent protein (CFP), a ligand binding domain and a yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) (Fig. 2D) , with CFP and YFP as the two mutant forms of GFP. However, after GFP, large spectrums of FPs with varied colors were discovered from marine coelenterates. The increase in brightness and folding efficiencies, accompanied with a decrease in oligomerization is achieved by generation of affinity mutants. This leads to the diversification of spectral range of FPs, from one color to another, improving the overall protein monitoring system of the resultant biosensor. Mutagenesis increases both photo-stability and photo-switchability of FPs [24, 25] . It is exactly the reversibility and irreversibility in photo-switching that makes FRET based biosensors useful to track protein trafficking. Quenching enforced by acidic pH is the major snag in the bio-sensing mechanism of FPs. However, recent developments have now better engineered the sensitivity of biosensors vis a vis ions, pH and redox potentials [26, 27] .",

It is due to their bigger size that problems arise in their diffusion which renders them limited only for surface labeling purposes [28] . Therefore, such FPs are routinely utilized in conjugation with antibodies for enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays and flow cytometric measurements. For the FPs to offer their best character as fluorophores, some vital features include-varying spectral properties, maturation efficiency, photo stability, efficient brightness, and fidelity in fusions, monomeric character and their potential efficiency as FRET donors or acceptors. Furthermore, critical mutations have been exploited to generate different FP variants with enhanced spectral properties-mVenus [29] and mKO2 [30] are the two important examples of bright monomeric variants. To address spectral and structural snags of FPs, recently a family of GFP proteins in the cephalochordate Branchiostoma floridae, commonly known as amphioxus was discovered and named after it as bfloGFP [31] . So far, this animal is credited to be the only species representing the largest source of 16 FPs. A total of six clades of amphioxus possess these 16 GFPs, all emitting the green fluorescent light, and each clade owns discrete absorption spectra, extinction coefficients and fluorescence intensities.",

The gene of interest is first cloned and then transformed into suitable cells. Once inside the cell, the bitterness due to FPs may be amplified, since they have their own unique proteinous feature which can lead to functional disorder of the attached protein of interest. In this direction, a striking effort [33] was made to genetically engineer one least cytotoxic red FP (FusionRed) for monitoring the protein dynamics in real time. In the chromophore surrounding region K69R and R203H mutations were transferred to mKate2.5, resulting in the dramatic pH stability of the protein. Earlier, mKate2.5 variant was yielded by inserting S132A, R164A, K182E and Y200N mutations along with the substituted C-terminus. In addition to pH stability, the final variant FusionRed exhibited photostability and maturation rate at par with other red-emitting fusions.

Avidin-biotin labeling constitutes another receptor-ligand pair that works best in the secretory compartment. It is extremely useful for in vitro and histological investigations, however, for unknown reasons, this fluorophore toolbox is rarely explored in live cell imaging. pH measurements of various compartments in terms of different pK a values has been carried out through chicken avidin-biotin fluorescein conjugates, recombinantly expressed in different secretory compartments [36, 37] . This facilitates the study of mechanism of pH regulation in such secretory compartments. However, primarily the critical limitation includes the toxic nature of avidin-biotin fluorescein conjugate in cytosol and mitochondrial compartments or secondly avidin is saturated with biotin. G protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) regulate critical physiological functions through neurotransmitters, peptide hormones, etc. Therefore to visualize GPCRs in living or fixed cells, immunofluorescence is applied through two strategies. In one approach, through antibodies against the extracellular receptor regions, and in other case through an epitope tag [38] . Intracellularly sited receptors or receptor segments and epitope tags are recognized and visualized only after cell fixation and permeabilization (Fig. 3) .

However, immunofluorescent tagging is most suitable for endogenous proteins. To visualize the expression of particular proteins in situ within different cell lineages or individual cells, mutant phenotypes can be analyzed by immunofluorescence staining [49] . Although due to ample brightness of QDs, the detection limit advances much more and hence multi-label separation is achieved by varying spectral features. Though at light microscopic (LM) and electron microscopic levels (EM), QDs serve as appropriate tools for detection of proteins, however, it is only with the aid of electron microscopy that protein localization is effectively accomplished in subcellular structures. QDs are promising in electron microscopic observations, due to their size and electron dense core, and additionally, visualization is enhanced by silver staining. Recently, QDs have been utilized directly for concurrent immunolabelling of several endogenous proteins to acquire a correlated LM-EM imagery of cells [50] . Before proceeding for EM examination studies, we can swiftly get a precise analysis in LM by utilizing diverse range of QD labels. The fluorescent QDs at EM level overcome the need of antibody labeling, for example streptavidin labeled QDs detect surface proteins by using enzyme biotin ligase [51] . Correlated microscopy using tetracysteine ensures the preservation of ultrastructure against the immunolabelled microscopic imagery that needs permeabilization and makes inflexible fixation. Both FPs and immunofluorescent tags are extensively applied for subcellular allotment of proteins and there is a high correlation between live-cell and fixed localization investigations. Researchers utilize finest validated antibodies and suitable fixation procedures, critical to obtain better epitope accessibility and an accurate protein distribution in vivo. In terms of cellular and subcellular localization however, FRET based nanosensors are comparatively more efficient than all other labeling methods. Compared to adding chemical dyes exogenously, such nanosensors can be expressed within stable cell lines and transgenic animals. The strategic approach is combination of FRET with metabolite recognition capability of a bacterial periplasmic binding protein (PBP) [52] , followed by successful transfection of resultant nanosensor into any cell type. This expands the possibilities for high-throughput screening, rigorous cell, developmental and physiological studies. In case of plants, most cells contain a large vacuole in their cytosol making it difficult to quantify plant metabolite concentrations in a given compartment in the little available cytoplasmic space. The FRET based nanosensors are comfortably targeted to sub-cellular locations, facilitating the highresolution mapping of signals within plant cells. Since there is an enormous range of metabolites in plants with highly complicated transport pathways that are quite contrasting against the animal systems.",

A wide range of FRET based nanosensors have been constructed for measuring various metabolites, to monitor the activity of many proteases, check the balance between kinases and phosphatases, for sensing neurotransmitters and other metabolites [53] . FRET efficiency varies with distance and orientation between donor and acceptor FPs.

It was carried out by valuable addition of monomeric red fluorescent protein (mRFP) to the pair of CFP/YFP. Such trimeric FRET based nanosensors again endow with deeper resolutions. In such FRET experiments, CFP acts as a donor for YFP and in turn, YFP as the next donor for mRFP (Fig. 5) . On the basis of same principle, bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) is low pace chromophoric interaction between two split fragments of a FP (Fig. 6 ) fused with two interacting proteins. Fluorescence correlation spectroscopy works in a novel way-using the two different tags aided with two different colors that interact and diffuse as a pair [55] .

However, in case of living cells or tissues, in no way we can adopt the methodologies that incorporate radioactive amino acids into nascent polypeptides. To solve this problem, only genetic tagging offers a great scope. The molecular strategy for tracking down the protein synthesis and yield involves the labeling of proteins with fluorescent probe of one color at initial stage of process up to a time limit. A new fluorescent probe of different color is used for labeling after an adequate time delay. For chimeric proteins, the phenomenon of bleaching and photo activation is explored to make the synthesized proteins get visualized. Varying temperature gradients lead to irreversible misfolding of FP mutants. Some FPs mature and change color spontaneously from green FP to red FP over a period of hours. Commonly, flexible linkers without hydrophobic residues are applied for monitoring the protein yield. Though in some cases, compared to flexible linkers, helix-forming hydrophobic linkers have been found to be better [63] , GFP tags are however removed through an enzymatic cleavage site (e.g., enterokinase) already engineered into the linker. Splicing of GFP or linker to N terminus of the target protein is usually preferred if it does not impairs its function and stability. In a novel investigation [64] protein synthesis has been monitored by exploiting fluorescent labeled tRNA FRET pairs in live cells through protein monitoring system (PSM).

Chromophore activated light inactivation: As a result of intense illumination of fluorescent dye, the target protein gets oxidized and inactivated due to ROS generation. This results in the loss of its fluorescent property. Fig. 11 . Photo-oxidation is carried out for electron microscopy. The generation of ROS due to intense illumination causes the precipitation. Staining is carried out by osmium tetraoxide for imaging it on an electron microscope. the post delivery problems of dye conjugated antibodies into living cells. Mostly, the tetracycline bound biarsenical dyes ReAsH [66] and FlAsH [67] , genetic tags GFP [68] and other fluorescein conjugates are employed in molecular works to achieve the obliteration of proteins expressed ectopically. Another novel approach to minimize non-specific toxic effects involves shifting towards longer wavelengths, that are least damaging. The obligate dimer is the genetically encoded prototype for CALI known as KillerRed. Though being less efficient than ReAsH, it operates as an effective toolkit against photo-oxidation (Fig. 11) of FPs [69] . FRET process has been further exploited in tune with FlAsH and ReAsH based biarsenical dyes. In this scenario, fluorescence of a donor fluorophore attached to a protein is measured. This is followed by reaction of biarsenical acceptor dye to tetracysteine motif and the quantity of donor quenching is measured [70] , providing a direct measurement of FRET efficiency. In membrane receptors, this technique has been applied to draw structural transitions in membrane receptors.",

Usually, the FRET disruption has been done with the use of proteases like subtilisin (Hong and Maret [40] ). A comparative analysis of subtilisin treated metallothionein and those of free FPs remarkably abolished transfer of energy from donor FP to acceptor FP. In order to get a valuable understanding of proteolysis w.r.t. different inhibitors, good advances have been made to develop a range of fluorescence based assays. This facilitates us to unravel protease activities working in cells. For example, inhibitors of unrelated serine proteases influence the ruining of GFP based substrates in ubiquitin-protease system [71] . Recently, it has been seen that GFP-reporter mice allows the in vivo tracking of proteasome activities, along with the outcome of proteasome inhibitors [72] . Numerous works are also focusing to develop protease inhibiting compounds of life threatening viruses, e.g., hepatitis C virus [73] and human corona virus, responsible for acute respiratory syndrome [74] . In this direction, development of HIV-1 protease inhibitors was a major breakthrough to target viral proteases. Halotag technique has been tailored to study several disease models of bacteriology and virology. For example, Liu et al. studied the membrane topology of glycoprotein-41 of HIV in mammalian cells using two distinct Halotag ligands [75] . In another study [76] involving relative intensity of fluorescence from the Halotag and GFP system it was revealed that Halotag showed superior fluorescence intensity and also functioned better than GFP under acidic conditions.",

Point spread function (PSF) of a microscope represents the intensity outline of focused emission from a lone protein molecule producing a diffracted spot and a blurred spot. In case visible light and high numerical aperture (NA) lenses are used, this spot size is approximately 200 \u00d7 500 nm along lateral and axial dimensions. Since the individual images are merged, there is no distinction of fluorescing protein molecules in the distances smaller than the dimensions of this spot. When there is simultaneous fluorescing of FPs, PALM ensures their separation much greater than this diffraction-limited distance (Fig. 13) , thus individually localizing each FP. Applying a low intensity light, in a densely labeled structure there occurs stochastic activation of photo-controllable FPs. Therefore, an appropriate separation distance is achieved between fluorophores [83, 84] . These activated molecules are then imaged and localized before being deactivated either through perpetual photo-bleaching or by turning off the fluorescence. However in order to collect such molecular positions in millions before deactivation, this process is repeated many thousand times. This microscopic technique of super-resolution imaging based on single molecule can work with all shades of photo-controllable FPs, whether rsFPs, PAFPs or PSFPs. Practically, in single molecule super-resolution microscopy, two critical factors-the fineness of localization of individual molecules and their density of localization regulate the spatial resolution. The microscopic technique involves photo-manipulation of such protein molecules. This type of imaging technology uses both synthetic dyes [71] as well as photo-controllable FPs and has been applied in total internal reflection [83] and epifluorescence [71, 84] .",

Mutagenesis on the other hand expanded the spectral diversity of natural FPs, generating a valuable range of phenotypes, which are very much desirable as non-cytotoxic fluorescent tags. A library of reporters has been developed for different metabolites, biochemical processes and regulatory enzymes, and it marks certainly boundless achievement in systems biology. For visualizing protein of interest through live cell imaging, although genetic tags provide a remarkable advantage, attempts should be made by genetic engineers to explore other fluorescent probes that cause no irritation to the functioning of endogenous proteins. For example, in the technique of immunofluorescence the detection limit is decreased with the application of QDs that are stable and possess increased brightness and this advantage amplifies its prospects for multiprotein detection, correlated EM examinations and other ELISA and Western blot based in vitro assays. However, while designing such prized QDs efficient targeting and better penetration is very crucial to achieve flawless fluorescence visualizations.

Secondly, targeting motifs are small and, therefore, a very less opportunity remains for introduced sequences to disrupt gross folding and function of a labeled protein. However, with biarsenical dyes, there are three fundamental problems during labeling; the effect of tag causes disturbed protein localization and function. The background fluorescence level and the cellular toxicity due to ligands further deteriorate the fluorescence intensity measurements and imaging in eukaryotic living cells. The largest problem associated with quantum dots is their toxicity, since these QD nanomaterials are composed of heavy metals, which are potentially toxic during in vitro and in vivo imaging. QD toxicity depends on different parameters such as charge, size, shape, composition, redox reactivity, surface coating, solubility, photostability and exposure time. On the other hand, whether GFP or its variants are non-toxic to cells but some limitations does exist. First, it is the aggregation of FPs and secondly, exciting GFP for an extended time generates free radicals. It has been further established that GFP variants induce apoptosis, that indicates the possible reason of difficulty in establishing the stable cell lines expressing GFP [85] . Therefore, FRET based nanosensors undergo a healthy expression under in vivo environments of prokaryotic model organisms such as Escherichia coli and Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and animal cell lines. In practice, several fluorescent probe based sensors have been patented for the specific detection of target ligands, drugs or metabolites. From the time of the first report of colorimetric detection of influenza virus through a polydiacetylene (PDA) film, researchers developed a great interest in their application as efficient sensor chips [86] . PDA-based fluorescent chemo-sensor systems are compatible with microarray technologies. In response to a range of environmental perturbations such as temperature, pH and ligand-receptor interactions, these chemosensors undergo a blue to red visible color change. The important FRET based sensors for apoptosis detection [87] to detect caspase-3, and proteolytic activity of matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP-9) with high spatiotemporal resolution [88] are some of the novel sensing systems available to us.",

In medicine and clinical research, application of fluorescent probes for biopsies and biochemical tests such as assays to analyze profiles of protein activity in patient cells is emerging very fast. Furthermore, fluorescence detection will be applicable to precisely investigate in individual patients the special modulatory effects of drugs on cellular signaling. Thus, fluorescence assays ensure a high-throughput drug screening by means of both functional assays in animal models or live cells and through protein microarrays. To achieve a better spatiotemporal resolution, photo-activated localization microscopy guarantees the individual localization of each FP by means of a low intensity light in a densely labeled structure attaining a suitable separation between photo-controllable FPs, much greater than the diffraction-limited distance. Therefore, in the inquiries of metabolomics, proteomics and systems biology, the sui-generis alliance of high molecular specificity, harmonized and nondestructive compatibility with prokaryotic or eukaryotic organisms and living cells, and certain spatiotemporal resolution based microscopic technology will prevail as pivotal.",
