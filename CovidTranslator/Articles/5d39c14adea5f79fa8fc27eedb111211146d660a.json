At 8 to 10 h an accumulation of ribosomes was shown and a few aberrant strands and short bacillary or tubular branching structures appeared in the cytoplasm. The tubules increased in number thereafter, especially in the vicinity of the nucleus (Fig.  3a) . They were more than 200 nm long and on average 42 nm in width, ranging 32 to 52 rim. Aberrant strands were observed frequently in the nucleus at t2 h or later after infection (Fig. 4c) . Virus particles first appeared at 12 h after infection in the cisternae of the rough endoplasmic reticulum (RER) as well as in the perinuclear space. At 14 h virions increased in number in a larger number of cells (Fig. 3 a) . They were usually spherical or oval 79 to 122 nm, 101 nm average (n=48), in diameter, with isometrical cores 37.8 nm in diameter(n=35). The core had electron-lucent outer layer and dense center with uniformly high opacity (Fig. 3b ) or electron lucency (Figs. 3c, e). Through cross-sections of the outer layer of the virion, a grape-like structure seemed to be subunits 13 to 20 nm in diameter around the core (Fig. 3c) . Some virions had an envelope with tiny surface projections (Fig. 3b) . Budding of the virus was occasionally observed at the cytoplasmic membrane (Figs. 3d-f ). In some budding particles a structural linkage between the tubules and cores of the maturing virions was demonstrated (Fig. 3g, h) . On the other hand, other small sized particles about 40 nm in diameter, seemingly in a process maturation, were sometimes observed in the cytoplasmic vesicles (Fig. 3i ).

Maturation and budding of the virus appears to occur at RER and perinuclear membrane, but not at the cell membrane. A large number of tubules, assumed to be specific structures related with the replication of EAV in vivo [9] and in vitro [2] , were observed in BHK-21 cells infected with the mB strain of EAV. In this study, a structural linkage was detected between the tubules and the virus core. These tubules reacted with immunogoldlabeled antibody to EAV. Similar tubules have been described also in infections with lactate dehydrogenase-elevating virus [21 ] , mouse hepatitis virus [8] and bluetongue virus [4] , while larger number of tubules appeared in infection with the mB strain of EAV.",
