            "text": "Health care personnel are at risk for exposure to a variety of infections during the routine performance of their job responsibilities. Despite these risks, compliance with protective equipment has remained suboptimal. 1 The safety of emergency department (ED) personnel, often the first to encounter an ill patient, is an important area to target for improvement. The risk factors for those individuals include the emergent nature of the care provided and the unknown circumstances that initially led to the patient's utilization of health care. 2 Despite the emphasis on standard precautions training for health care workers (HCWs), the consistent use of personal protective equipment (PPE) remains poor. 3, 4 Various descriptions and analyses of the 2002-2003 severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak reported lack of basic preemptive infection prevention and control strategies. As the outbreak grew, attention was paid to use of protective equipment, including respiratory protection, as symptomatic patients were identified. The experiences of HCWs confronted with suspected or confirmed SARS cases revealed an often inadequate and incorrect use of PPE. 5, 6 A fundamental flaw in the preventive process seemed to involve failure to recognize quickly the key signs, symptoms, or risks that might have led to the early implementation of protective equipment. Although there is little research concerning changing HCW behavior when providing care for patients with respiratory illness, there was some evidence from the SARS outbreak that pointed toward the benefits of training programs and availability of adequate PPE. 7 The workplace practices identified as problematic during the SARS epidemic mirror those identified by Jagger et al at the International Healthcare Worker Safety Center of the University of Virginia. Jagger et al's work has focused on injuries and exposures involving blood and body fluid exposures among HCWs. In 2001, as part of the EPINet Surveillance Program, 8 a total of 463 blood-body-fluid exposures were reported from 49 participating health care facilities. Of these exposures, over 13% occurred in the ED. Less than 10% of the exposed HCWs reported wearing appropriate eye protection, and fewer than 20% reported wearing some sort of mask or other facial barrier. 9 Clearly, the need still exists for effective training techniques to promote the use of PPE as a way to minimize such workplace exposures. Traditional infection prevention and control training for HCWs has involved a review of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) bloodborne pathogens training, 10 as outlined in the current Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) isolation guidelines, 11 with emphasis on transmission-based precautions. When we conducted an informal telephone interview with infection control professionals (ICPs) from 10 US hospitals chosen at random, results indicated that this type of training involved a classroom setting (80%) and/or written handouts (20%). A pretest and posttest process typically assessed competency. None of the interviewed hospitals reported the consistent inclusion of an observational component in their training or subsequent assessments.",

This pilot study evaluated a novel training approach for HCWs to use PPE when encountering patients who have known or suspected respiratory illnesses. The training approach involved the use of a human patient biosimulator to visually demonstrate respiratory disease transmission. The effectiveness of the visual demonstration was assessed by comparing the PPE-specific knowledge, attitudes, and skills of ED registered nurses (RNs) who received the demonstration to those who only received the standard disease transmission training. The study hypotheses were as follows: (1) The standard disease transmission training will result in an increase in knowledge among RNs, and (2) the additional use of a visual demonstration would result in significant improvement in appropriate PPE use among HCW beyond the improvement produced by the standard training methods.",

            "text": "Upon analysis of data, the practice of nurses masking patients was an unexpected finding. It was then decided to aggregate self and patient mask use into a single dichotomous variable: PPE mask use. When use of PPE (self-use of mask and placement of mask on patient) was dichotomized into ''yes'' or ''no'' and was cross-tabulated with group assignment, analysis comparing use of PPE between control and intervention groups indicated that subjects who received the visual training demonstrated use of PPE more often (74% vs 53%, respectively). Given the exploratory nature of the study and the unidirectional hypothesis that the visual demonstration would improve PPE use, statistical significance for this hypothesis was evaluated as a 1-tailed distribution test (a = .05). A Fisher exact test was performed to determine whether the visual demonstration increased appropriate PPE use relative to the standard training alone. Results are shown in Table 3 and indicate that the standard training plus biosimulation significantly increased the use of PPE for patients with respiratory symptoms (P = .04).",

[1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] This study showed, however, that traditional education is not necessarily the sole or even key factor in improving PPE use. Two basic components were addressed in this pilot project. The first involved the increase in knowledge regarding disease transmission using a traditional didactic training process. The second component investigated whether a biosimulated, visual demonstration of particulate transmission would result in increased PPE use. Traditional classroom training did, indeed, make a significant difference in pre-and posttraining knowledge. The addition of a visual component to training emphasized the personal risk of the individual HCW. Direct observations showed that the subjects trained using this visual approach appropriately used PPE more often than those subjects whose training did not include this visual component: 74% versus 53%, respectively. Therefore, these results suggest that use of the biosimulator and visual training is an important new approach for learning in the health care setting. This type of learning allowed the HCW to see the impact of disease transmission as opposed to simply hearing about it through traditional didactic education. In addition, the components of this visual demonstration built on the principles of adult learning. Teaching occurred within the context of work experience, thereby making the learning relevant to the individual.",

Biosimulators are now used in university medical centers across the country to assist and improve the learning of residents, medical students, nursing students, and employed HCWs. The benefits of simulation technology in medical training include improvements in cardiovascular examination skills, increased precision in surgical technical skills, and acquisition and retention of knowledge compared with traditional modes of teaching (eg, lectures).
