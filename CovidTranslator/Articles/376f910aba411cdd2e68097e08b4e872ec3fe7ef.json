Several subgenomic mRNAs (sgmRNAs) encoding structural proteins are generated by template switching from the body transcription regulatory sequence (TRS) to the leader TRS. The process preferentially generates shorter sgmRNA. Appropriate readthrough of body TRSs is required to produce longer sgmRNAs and full-length gRNA. We find that phosphorylation of the viral nucleocapsid (N) by host glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK-3) is required for template switching. GSK-3 inhibition selectively reduces the generation of gRNA and longer sgmRNAs, but not shorter sgmRNAs. N phosphorylation allows recruitment of the RNA helicase DDX1 to the phosphorylated-N-containing complex, which facilitates template readthrough and enables longer sgmRNA synthesis. DDX1 knockdown or loss of helicase activity markedly reduces the levels of longer sgmRNAs. Thus, coronaviruses employ a unique strategy for the transition from discontinuous to continuous transcription to ensure balanced sgmRNAs and full-length gRNA synthesis.",

The SARS-CoV, the causative pathogen for the SARS outbreak, was the first high pathogenic human CoV to be identified, with a mortality rate of approximately 10% (Stadler et al., 2003) . More recently, the Middle East respiratory syndrome CoV emerged, also a high pathogenic human CoV, with a mortality rate of nearly 50%. CoV infection has thus become an increasing threat to human society. Increased understanding of the key viral factors critical for CoV replication, as well as the underlying mechanisms, could facilitate the identification of appropriate targets for the development of antiviral strategies.",

            "text": "CoVs are enveloped RNA viruses containing a positive-sense single-stranded genomic (g) RNA, approximately 30 kb in size (Lai et al., 2007) , which encodes nonstructural proteins involved in viral replication (Brian and Baric, 2005) . Several subgenomic (sg) mRNAs are generated during viral replication, which predominantly encode structural proteins, including spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M), and nucleocapsid (N) proteins, and some species-specific accessory proteins (Sawicki et al., 2007) . All viral RNAs, including gRNAs and sgmRNAs, are coterminal, and the sgmRNAs are generated through a unique discontinuous transcription mechanism during the synthesis of negative-strand RNA (Pasternak et al., 2006; Sawicki et al., 2007) . This discontinuous process is controlled by a conserved transcription regulating sequence (TRS), which is located after the leader sequence (leader TRS) and in front of each gene (body TRS). It has been suggested that through base pairing between the leader TRS and the complementary body TRS, a template-switching event, occurs to generate the discontinuous minus-strand RNAs that serve as the templates for the transcription of large amounts of discontinuous nested plus-strand sgmRNAs. The discontinuous transcription process encounters a decision problem when reaching the TRS: either transcription stops and switches to the leader TRS to produce shorter sgmRNAs, or transcription continues through the TRS to generate longer sgmRNAs and gRNAs. Greater abundance of shorter than longer sgmRNAs suggests that transcription might switch upon reaching the 3 0 end of the body TRS to produce shorter sgmRNAs (Pasternak et al., 2004) . However, the virus has to pass the body TRS in an appropriate proportion to produce sufficient longer sgmRNAs and gRNA essential to the life cycle. Studies have investigated several cis-regulating elements and trans-regulating factors involved in this process , but the molecular mechanisms controlling the switch from discontinuous to continuous transcription in CoV still remain unclear.",

Our previous study demonstrated that the major phosphorylation sites in both SARS-CoV and the mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) JHM strain (JHMV) are the Ser residues clustered within the central Ser-arginine (SR)-rich motif (Wu et al., 2009) . Glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK-3) is the kinase responsible for the phosphorylation of this SR-rich motif and is conserved in both JHMV and SARS-CoV. Treatment with GSK-3 inhibitor reduces the phosphorylation of N protein and reduces the viral titer and cytopathic effects, suggesting that the phosphorylation of N is relevant to viral life cycle. In this study, we discovered a role of GSK-3-mediated pN in supporting the transition from discontinuous to continuous transcription to produce a full set of viral sgmRNAs and gRNAs through interaction with the RNA helicase DDX1. This mechanism ensures appropriate balance between the synthesis of longer and shorter sgmRNAs and gRNAs during CoV infection.",

More substantial increases in longer than shorter viral RNAs were noted and verified by RT-qPCR for specific transcripts ( Figure 2D ). In addition, we observed a markedly reduced synthesis of viral RNA in the cells expressing S205A-N ( Figure 2C , lane 3). Consistently, we detected considerably higher expression of viral N protein and higher viral titers in the cells expressing WT-N and 3D-N than in the cells expressing S205A-N ( Figure 2E , western blot; Figure 2F , viral titer analysis). Therefore, our results suggested the involvement of GSK-3phosphorylated N in the synthesis of viral RNA, particularly longer viral RNAs, leading to higher viral titers. It also indicated that the exogenous overexpression of unphosphorylated N (by GSK3) could function as a dominant-negative regulator during viral RNA synthesis.",

We thus examined the levels of minusstrand sgmRNA in kenpaullone-pretreated cells by hybridization with strand specific probes.

Zonal sedimentation analysis on sucrose density gradients was used to separate protein complexes according to their molecular mass under nondenaturing conditions (evaluating at 4, 6, 8, 10, and 16 hr p.i.). We analyzed the fractions from each time point by western blotting with anti-N and anti-pS197-N Abs. The pS197-N at early time points after infection distributed into two peaks ( Figure 3A , 4 hr and 6 hr p.i.): the lighter fractions ranging from fractions 4 to 7 and the heavier fractions ranging from fractions 9 to 12. The pS197-N-containing lighter fractions decreased with time ( were derived from those in the lighter fractions. We also analyzed the RNA in each fraction from cells at 6 and 10 hr p.i. by northern blot. The results suggested that the pS197-N-containing protein complexes were in the fractions containing the viral RNA transcripts with progressively increasing length ( Figure 3C , 6 and 10 hr p.i.). The pS197-N-containing lighter fraction appeared to consist of the active nascent viral transcription complex that later transitioned to longer viral sgmRNAs. We then treated the cells with kenpaullone and harvested the lysates at 6 hr p.i. and 8 hr p.i. before conducting the same analyses. Without phosphorylation of N by GSK-3, the N-containing lighter fractions (before fraction 10) disappeared, with protein complex detectable only in the heavier fractions (fractions 11 and 12) ( Figure 3A , bottom panels with kenpaullone treatment). Although the longer sgmRNAs were almost eliminated, the shorter sgmRNA6/7 remained unaffected, appearing only in the heavier fractions 11 and 12 ( Figure 3C, bottom panel) . Therefore, the transcription of sgmRNA6/7 does not require the GSK-3-mediated phosphorylation of N protein, which, however, is essential for the transcription of longer viral RNAs by forming specific protein complexes in lighter fractions.",

Northern blot analysis revealed that DDX1 knockdown markedly reduced the synthesis of longer viral RNAs but minimally reduced the synthesis of shorter sgmRNA6/7 ( Figure 5B) , which was again verified by RT-qPCR analysis ( Figure 5C ). Meanwhile, our results indicated that shDdx1s did not affect the level of N protein encoded by sgmRNA7 ( Figure 5D , lanes 2 and 3 versus lane 1), but the reduction of viral titer ( Figure 5E , bars 2 and 3 versus bar 1) was consistent with that of viral gRNA ( Figure 5C, sgmRNA1) . We further examined the effects of shDdx1 on the RNA expression pattern in sucrose gradient fractions. The results showed that DDX1 knockdown attenuated the expression of viral RNAs, specifically in the fractions associated with longer viral RNA synthesis ( Figure 5F , right panel, fractions 9-12), but did not reduce the levels of sgmRNA6/7 in the lighter fractions (Figure 5F, right panel, fractions 4-7) . The pS197-N-containing complexes in these heavier fractions decreased, which suggested their dependence on DDX1 ( Figure 5F, bottom panel) . These re- sults supported the idea that DDX1 in the complexes in these heavier fractions might play a role in regulating the synthesis of longer viral RNAs. Subsequently, we used the gain-offunction approach to overexpress DDX1, both the wild-type and enzyme-dead constructs, and evaluated the effects on viral RNA levels. For the enzyme-dead mutant of DDX1, a conserved lysine (K) at residue 52 within the GKT motif which is necessary for ATP binding and hydrolysis (Hanson and Whiteheart, 2005; Tanner et al., 2003) was substituted by alanine (A).

The results showed a comparable binding pattern for pS197-N and DDX1 in all of the target sites, which was consistent with the hypothesis that they occur in the same complexes. We observed a relatively higher binding signal for both proteins in the 5 0 RNA genome (except TRS1) at IR1, TRS2, TRS3, and IR2, and relatively lower signal for their binding to the 3 0 RNA genome at TRS4, TRS5, TRS6, TRS7, and IR3 (with lowest binding signal for TRS7) ( Figure 7C ). Kenpaullone treatment significantly reduced the binding of DDX1 to all target sites ( Figure 7B , right panel), which supported the idea that this binding is mediated by pS197-N.

Phosphorylation is a renowned modification of CoV N; however, little is known regarding the phosphorylated N protein's function in viral replication. Extending on results from our previous work, in this study we demonstrate that GSK-3-mediated phosphorylation of the N protein is essential for viral RNA biogenesis. Evidence from loss-of-function (by treatment with the GSK-3 inhibitor kenpaullone) and gain-offunction (by establishing N-expressing cell lines) analyses support the role of GSK-3-phosphorylated N in facilitating the synthesis of gRNA and long sgmRNAs of JHMV (Figures 1 and 2) . Our study demonstrates the involvement of CoV N phosphorylation in regulation of the discontinuous transcription process. We identified an interacting partner for pS197-N, the DDX1 RNA helicase, which has the appropriate biochemical properties to mediate this unique function of GSK-3 phosphorylated N. DDX1 is a member of the DEAD-box protein family, which is the largest family of the superfamily 2 (SF2) helicases (Byrd and Raney, 2012) . We observed that knockdown of DDX1 reduced the levels of longer viral RNAs, while overexpression of the wild-type, but not the enzyme-dead, construct of DDX1 was able to rescue. We further identified that after JHMV infection, the distribution of DDX1 changed from the nucleus to the cytosol, where viral RNA synthesis occurs. Our results provide strong evidence to support that phosphorylation modification is a unique strategy for CoV N to facilitate the synthesis of longer viral RNAs and subsequent viral progeny production, through the recruitment of cellular DDX1. As noted, DDX1 has been identified as a member of the cellular interactomes for the IBV N protein (Emmott et al., 2013) , which suggests that the interaction between DDX1 and N for the regulation of viral RNA synthesis could be a general phenomenon in CoVs.",

We thus also analyzed whether nsp14 is present and function in the pS197-N/DDX1 complexes. The coIP results showed that expression of nsp14 has no effect on the interaction of pS197-N and DDX1 ( Figures S4A and S4B ). Although nsp14 could be brought down with anti-N Ab, this interaction is affected neither by S205A mutation nor by kenpaullone treatment (Figures S4A and S4B) . It suggested the binding of nsp14 with N is not influenced by the GSK-3-mediated phosphorylation. Moreover, the expression of nsp14 did not affect the synthesis of all of the viral RNA transcripts ( Figure S4C ). The results did not support an essential role of nsp14 for the function of pS197-N/DDX1 in the discontinuous transcription process, at least for JHMV. Meanwhile, we noted that knockdown of DDX1 in the IBVinfected cells also decreased the viral titer but not the expression level of N protein as shown in this report, which supported the functional role of DDX1 identified in the current study also in IBV infected cells. Therefore, we confirmed that nsp14 could interact with DDX1, but it is independent from N phosphorylation at Ser197 and does not affect the transcription process. The interaction between nsp14 and DDX1 may function in other aspects of viral life cycle.",

We identified that the complex exhibits a unique pattern when binding to different regions of viral RNA. There shows a trend with higher binding activity for the 5 0 -terminal sequence (except TRS1) than 3 0 -terminal sequences (lowest at TRS7) of viral RNA ( Figure 7C ). This trend indicates the mechanism underlying the regulation of the discontinuous transcription process by the S197-N/DDX1 complex. Experimental evidence and bioinformatics analyses have indicated that the extensive stem-loop structural elements of the CoV gRNA template naturally favor the synthesis of smaller sgmRNAs Van Den Born et al., 2004; van den Born et al., 2005) . Studies have also identified specific long-distance RNA-RNA interactions outside the TRS as critical for the template switching process (Mateos-Gomez et al., 2013; Mateos-G\u00f3 mez et al., 2011; Moreno et al., 2008) . Therefore, it has been postulated that specific viral and cellular factors that assist to unwind the stem-loop RNA structure could be required for the synthesis of longer sgmRNAs (Van Den Born et al., 2004; van den Born et al., 2005) . Considering that DDX1 binds to RNA to unwind the RNA duplex (Chen et al., 2002) , we proposed a model for the progressive recruitment of DDX1 by pS197-N from the 3 0 body TRS to the 5 0 body TRS (from TRS7 to TRS2), but not the leader TRS (TRS1), which might assist the opening of the extensive stemloop structure, increase the readthrough of the body TRSs, and induce the synthesis of long sgmRNAs (see Graphical Abstract). It is noteworthy that we observed a prominent binding signal for the viral genome at the open reading frame (ORF) 1 region (IR1 in Figure 7A ). Currently, we were unable to establish the exact functional role of this increased binding; however, this region is known to localize adjacent to the internal discontinuous replication element that forms a stem-loop structure and functions during RNA synthesis in JHMV DI RNA (Kim and Makino, 1995; Lin and Lai, 1993; Repass and Makino, 1998) . Thus, binding of the host helicase DDX1 to the region might promote virus RNA synthesis by unwinding the RNA secondary structure. Whether DDX1 participates in the generation of viral DI particles is a potential future area of investigation.",

And the decrease of viral titer caused by blocking of N phosphorylation at S197 was consistent with the reduction of sgmRNA1 level (Figures 1, 2, and 5) . In sucrose gradient experiments, we observed shorter sgmRNAs in the lighter fractions, which developed into larger complexes (the heavier fractions) in pS197-N-presenting cells. However, without pS197-N (after kenpaullone treatment), the shorter sgmRNAs were well produced in the heavier fractions, although no longer RNA species could be detected. It suggested that the transcription of JHMV shorter and longer sgmRNAs might occur in two compartments and in two stages. The CoV infection is known to induce the formation of multiple membranous structures (such as double-membrane vesicles or convoluted membranes), which vary qualitatively and quantitatively during the course of an infection (Ulasli et al., 2010) . Investigation of the relationship between such membranous structures and the phosphorylation status of the N protein is warranted in the future. At present, we have tried to detect the association of GRP78 with both light and heavy sucrose fractions. Most of the pS197-N-containing complexes codistributed with GRP78 among both light and heavy fractions from JHMV infected cell lysates, suggesting their localization at the ER-related membranous structures. However, in cells treated with kenpaullone, the N-containing complex is present in the heavy fractions without GRP78, indicating such complex not locating at the ER-related membranous structures ( Figure S2 ). The findings were consistent with the idea that light and heavy fractions might be in two different compartments. However, the ultrastructural properties of the compartments are worthy to be carefully examined by future extensive highresolution electronmicrograph analysis.",

The N protein is thus the major protein synthesized in the early replication stage, and is phosphorylated by the abundant GSK-3 after synthesis. The accumulation of sufficient pS197-N might initiate the subsequent transcription of long sgmRNAs through the extensive recruitment of DDX1 to viral RNA, as a pivotal factor in switching transcription from smaller to larger sgmRNAs in subsequent viral replication cycle.",

In this study, we have conducted coIP and cosedimentation analyses to confirm the interaction between pN and SFRS1 ( Figures S5A and S5B ).

Using a phospho-specific pS197-N Ab, we identified that the N protein is phosphorylated immediately after synthesis but is dephosphorylated in virions ( Figure 1A) . Therefore, binding with pS197-N/DDX1 might impede the packaging of gRNA into mature virions. In fact, similar dephosphorylation patterns for N proteins in assembled virions were also observed in several other viruses (Cartier et al., 1999; Ivanov et al., 2003; Law et al., 2003) . One mechanism proposed for this unique pattern is that the overexpression of S205A N in cells prior to viral infection might cause the formation of higher RNP by unphosphorylated S205A-N, which prevents viral RNA transcription, including the N transcript.",

Unlike DDX1, an SF2 type of RNA helicase, the viral RNA helicase is classified into the superfamily 1 (SF1). DDX1 exhibits bipolar unwinding activity (Chen et al., 2002; Li et al., 2008) , and the CoV helicases demonstrate 5 0 to 3 0 polarity only (Adedeji et al., 2012; Seybert et al., 2000) . Therefore, the two types of helicase unwind RNA substrates with distinct polarity selectivity, which indicates fundamental differences in the functions of DDX1 and CoV helicase in viral replication. The viral RNA helicase is crucial for viral replication and thus considered a candidate target for drug development (Keum and Jeong, 2012; Kumar et al., 2013) . Our study indicates the critical role of the interaction between pS197-N and the cellular DDX1 in the synthesis of viral gRNA, which supports the targeting of pS197-N or DDX1 for the design of anti-CoV strategies.",
