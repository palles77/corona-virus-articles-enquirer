Using an optimized process of DNA probe preparation to minimize the effect of contaminants in commercial thiolated DNA probe, the electrode surface was functionalized with the 24-nucleotide DNA probes based on the West Nile virus sequence (Kunjin strain). The biosensor has the ability to detect complementary DNA fragments with a detection limit down to 20 DNA target molecules (1.5 aM range), making it suitable for a practical point-of-care (POC) platform for low target count clinical applications without the need for amplification. The reproducibility of the biosensor detection was improved with efficient covalent immobilization of purified single-stranded DNA probe oligomers on cleaned gold microelectrodes. In addition to the low detection limit, the biosensor showed a dynamic range of detection from 1 \u00b5L -1 to 10 5 \u00b5L -1 target molecules (20 to 2 million targets), making it suitable for sample analysis in a typical clinical application environment. The binding results presented in this paper were validated using fluorescent oligomers.",

While qPCR offers high specificity with low limits of detection, it and other similar existing diagnostic methods have their drawbacks, such as the use of expensive devices for repeated thermal cycling, specialized non-reusable reagents, the need for sensitive fluorescence detection optics, and laborious assay preparation steps requiring trained personnel (Timmer et al. 1993) . For example, a typical qPCR will require highly trained technicians 4 to 8 hours from sample preparation to completion using reagents such as specific TaqMan probes and matching master mixes with reverse transcriptase enzymes and DNA polymerase, costing up to hundreds of dollars per assay depending on sample number and origin. Consequently, such analytical methods do not align with the need for a rapid, inexpensive, highly specific and sensitive point-of-care platform (Craw and Balachandran, 2012; Peeling and McNerney, 2014; Sin et al., 2014) .",

Such a sensing modality has been used successfully to detect specific DNA molecules in complex mixtures in a number of different assays, making it attractive for reliable classification of target DNA (Boyd, 2013; Ventimiglia and Petralia, 2013; Drummond et al., 2013; Byron et. al., 2016; Marzancola et al., 2016) . Electrode configuration and geometry can have a significant effect on sensor performance (Pettine et al., 2012) . One of the widely used electrode configurations, especially for sensors measuring capacitance changes due to DNA-DNA hybridization (capacitive biosensors), is the interdigitated microelectrode. Microelectrodes are often made using modern photolithographic and deposition techniques on glass, silicon, or other solid substrates (Blanda 1991 , Gawad et al. 2009 , Pettine et al. 2012 . When they are tightly integrated with the back-end measurement circuits, they have significant advantages over conventional carbon-based electrodes (Li and Miao, 2012) for analytical measurements, such as low resistance, high signal-to-noise ratio, rapid attainment of steady state, and the use of small solution volumes (Dandy et al., 2007; Yang and Bashir, 2008; Wydallis et al. 2015) .",

A number of studies (Berggren et al., 1999; Qureshi et al., 2010) reported poor sensor-to-sensor reproducibility. Non-uniformity of the selfassembled monolayer (SAM) and the covalently attached DNA probes on the sensor surface is a major contributing factor to poor sensor-to-sensor reproducibility. Sensor surface cleanliness greatly affects the uniformity of SAM layers (Love et al. 2005) . Covalently attached ssDNA probes are largely affected by the presence of common contaminants in commercial thiolated DNA probes (Lee et al., 2010) . The lack of emphasis on electrode cleaning prior to assay functionalization may have also contributed to significant variations of the reported results. Stagni et al. (2006) elucidated the importance of electrode surface cleaning in order to achieve uniform covalent binding of thiolated DNA probes. In addition, the total surface area of microelectrodes and the geometric relationship between two electrodes in a biosensor are other factors which directly affect sensor sensitivity and reproducibility, as measured capacitance output represents averaged values from all the fingers of the microelectrodes (Guiducci et al., 2004) .",

It is demonstrated here that this new biosensor produces an output of more than 70nF in capacitance change in response to as few as 20 complementary DNA targets (0.25 attogram) at a concentration of ~1.5 aM. Due to the optimized cleaning process for the capacitive biosensor, including a pre-cleaning protocol, to improve covalent immobilization of purified single-stranded DNA probe oligomers onto the microelectrodes, the biosensor's reproducibility was improved compared to the reported results. In addition to the low detection limit, the biosensor showed a good dynamic range of detection from 1 \u00b5L -1 to 10 5 \u00b5L -1 target molecules (20 to 2 million total targets), making it suitable for sample analysis in a typical clinical application environment. The capacitance results obtained in this study were verified using fluorescently labeled oligonucleotides on a fluorescence scanner. Capacitive affinity-based assays have long been considered highly sensitive (Mattiasson et al., 2016) , but low specificity and reproducibility (Berggren et al., 1999) hinder further improvement in their sensitivity.

The specificity from using the 100 \u00b5M 1\u00d7TE-MgSO 4 buffer decreased with temperature up to 23\u00b0C, but it is still better than that for all other three salt buffers up to 45\u00b0C.

At the temperature used for all subsequent hybridization studies (23\u00b0C) the 100 \u00b5M 1\u00d7TE-MgSO 4 buffer demonstrates the best hybridization specificity.

Since the double layer capacitance at the electrode-electrolyte interface is established due to the displacement of mobile ions in the fluid, it is expected that increasing the stimulus signal frequency will result in gradual disappearance of the double layer capacitance (Guiducci et al., 2004) . To gain a better understanding of the sensor's response characteristics as a function of the stimulus signal frequency, a 20 mV RMS AC voltage is applied at three separate frequencies (20 Hz, 100 Hz and 1 kHz). Capacitance values for all four stages were measured for all three frequencies. The results shown in Fig. 3A verify changes in capacitance due to probe immobilization compared to the bare clean electrodes (marked as \"control\" in Fig. 3A ). The results in Fig. 3B illustrate that changes in capacitance before and after hybridization decrease with increase in operating frequency.

In general, the cleaner the IDE surface the better thiol-modified molecules will attach to the gold surface (Xue et al., 2014) . The IDE sensor surface was cleaned with the protocol described in Section 2.5 and treated with oxygen plasma to promote ssDNA immobilization. In addition to surface cleanliness, ssDNA immobilization is also determined by time the thiol modified ssDNA is in contact with the gold surface. In general, twenty-four hour incubations are required to reach the saturation point for 1 \u00b5M ssDNA immobilization in 1M salt conditions, and further exposure results in little additional adsorption (Herne et al., 1997) . For ssDNA probe concentrations ranging from \u00b5M to mM, a surface density in the order of 10 3 cm -2 can be obtained after four hours of incubation (Guiducci et al., 2004) . In order to maximize sensor functionalization and the number of probes present on the functionalized sensor based on our previous work (Dandy et al., 2007) , overnight incubation was chosen for the 10 \u00b5M 5' thiol-modified ssDNA probe in our experiments. Probe concentration was set in the \u00b5M range based on previous work on the gold electrode DNA biosensors (Dandy et al., 2007) and was further optimized with additional chemical and plasma oxygen cleaning steps to maximize sensor coverage and target capture in 100 \u00b5M 1\u00d7TE-MgSO 4 buffer. To validate 5' thiol-modified ssDNA immobilization on the IDE sensor surface, capacitance measurements were obtained from 3 individual sensors after overnight ssDNA probe incubation, but before passivation with MCU. Fig. 4A demonstrates a statistically significant difference (p < 0.01) between the average capacitance measurements before and after probe immobilization, indicating that ssDNA probe was immobilized on the IDE surface. To further validate the capacitance results, AlexF488N labeled ssDNA probes were immobilized on IDEs as a complementary assay to monitor probe deposition. Total IDE fluorescence intensities were obtained before and after probe immobilization (Fig. 4(B) ), showing that incubation with fluorescent ssDNA probe resulted in a significant increase in fluorescence on the IDE (p < 0.01) similar to what was observed by capacitance measurements.",

            "text": "biosensor improves the state of the art on three fronts. First, the sensor was able to produce an output of more than 70nF in capacitance change in response to as few as 20 complementary DNA targets (0.25 attogram) at a concentration of ~1.5 aM. The magnitude of capacitance change increases linearly with complementary target concentration in the range between 20 and 2 million target DNA molecules. The detection limit of this biosensor is among the lowest reported to date for a non-faradaic capacitive biosensor. Second, sensor specificity is clearly demonstrated by the capacitance change differential between complementary and noncomplementary target binding. For non-complementary ssDNA target molecules, the measured change in capacitance is significantly less than that for the complementary ssDNA target and does not display an appreciable change in capacitance with non-complementary molecule concentration increases. Third, the sensor achieved a dynamic range for detection between 1 \u00b5L -1 and 10 6 \u00b5L -1 target molecules (20 to 2 million target DNA molecules) with excellent linearity in the measurement of capacitance changes. Combining its performance in sensitivity, specificity, and dynamic detection range, this capacitive biosensor demonstrates the potential to be a viable technology for low-cost, low-power, ease of use, and rapid detection technology that is a critical step toward POC pathogen detection. Areas where further investigations can provide more optimized conditions for the capacitive biosensor include optimized incubation time to decrease time for sample analysis. Furthermore, future development of this capacitive biosensor includes detection of viral nucleic acids (DNA and RNA) from complex biological samples, as well as platform multiplexing, with the ultimate goal of developing a POC device for rapid and multiplexed diagnosis of viral infections in clinical and field settings.",
