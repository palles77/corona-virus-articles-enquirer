As of March 3, 2020, only one case underwent invasive mechanic ventilation and ECMO support. Other cases all presented markedly improvement of symptoms and findings on chest CT images, due to aggressive and comprehensive medical treatment, although they also suffered from many adverse events during hospitalization, like secondary infection or acute hepatic injury. This result is consistent with the situation of infected hospital workers in a large data reported by the NCP Emergency Response Epidemiology Team of China [13]. Our data showed that, the infection of SARS-CoV-2 in hospital staff mostly had definite or suspected history of patient contact, which was consistent with most reports. The transmission of SARS-CoV-2 mainly characterized as confined space and close contact. No other countries around the world experiences a similar time in great favor of transmission of SARS-CoV-2, like the Spring Festival and the Spring Festival travel season in China. During this period of year in China, people' s lives are full of behavior styles characterized as confined space and close contact, including air or railway transportation for return home or travel, various familial or public get-togethers. Nosocomial infection is another key feature of the outbreak. At the early time of prevalence, a large number of suspected patients squeezed into fever clinics or emergency departments of hospitals in Wuhan, in which health workers had prepared in terms of both protective supplies and awareness. Meanwhile, patients in incubation period of COVID-19 underwent elective surgeries who were diagnosed after procedures made nosocomial infection quite a few on the early stage of the outbreak. As continually support of protective materials from other areas into Hubei Province, as well as improved knowledge of protection, data with decreased risk of nosocomial infection are expected. Xu et al reported the pathological findings of a 50-year-old male with COVID-19, died of ARDS and sudden cardiac arrest. They found that there were a few interstitial mononuclear inflammatory infiltrates, but no other substantial damage in the heart tissue [20]. The result implied the possibility of coexisting myocarditis, as part of systemic inflammatory response syndrome. And the persistent hypoxemia may directly cause myocardial suppression, possibly related to sudden cardiac arrest [21].In other words, the CVMs of COVID-19 maybe more associated with the systemic immune reaction, rather than direct damage of heart by virus attack. And these mechanisms maybe explain the concomitant CVMs of COVID-19 were not independently associated with adverse in-hospital outcomes to some extent.In this study, there were about 20.5% of cases with non-severe course of COVID-19 suffered from acute hepatic injury, needed liver protection treatment. And it probably should not be totally attributed to drug-induced liver injury and aroused more concern on COVID-19 itself. Xu et al reported the liver biopsy specimens of the patient with COVID-19 showed moderate microvascular steatosis and mild lobular and portal activity, indicating the injury could have been caused by either SARS-CoV-2 infection or drug-induced liver injury[20]. Pathological findings were also in favor of more attention to the hepatic injury in the pathogenesis of COVID-19.",

In a mouse model of SARS-CoV pathogenesis, prophylactic and early therapeutic administration of remdesivir significantly reduced lung viral load and improved clinical signs of disease as well as respiratory function [23]. These preclinical evidences, together with successful clinical cases treated by remdesivir in USA and France [24] made us looking forward to the final result of the randomized controlled trial unblinding before long in Wuhan. Meanwhile, chloroquine has been recently written into official recommendation for empirical therapy of COVID-19 for its adequate safety data in human [25]. It is a cheap and safe drug that has been used as an antimalarial for more than 70 years. Combination of lopinavir and ritonavir (Kaletra) among SARS-CoV patients was reported a substantial clinical benefit [26]. As it is available in the designated hospital as anti-human immunodeficiency virus drug, a randomized controlled trial has been initiated quickly to assess the efficacy and safety of it [11]. Other medication as newly recommended officially are mostly empirical. Experience came from the outbreak of SARS-CoV 17 years ago. From empirical medicine to evidence-based medicine, it is the only way which must be passed that forms comprehensive knowledge about the new virus and the new disease. And for this, the Chinese people have paid a heavy price, deserved to be remembered. Limitation Firstly, the cases enrolled in this study were only hospital staff. The conclusion cannot be extrapolated to common community patients. Secondly, as the suddenness of the outbreak, the vast patient volume in hospitals and shortage of healthcare personnel, it is hard to obtain large clinical data. The sample is not large enough for observation of mortality in severe cases of COVID-19. The multivariate model analysis had limitation due to the sample size. And we cannot figure up how the research variable effected each adverse in-hospital event. Lastly, the in-hospital outcomes were the final date of follow-up. The incomplete follow-up data will be made up constantly. Besides, we are trying to collect the data of the severe case who transferred to other hospital. Nevertheless, this is first-hand data in terms of hospital staff infection in Wuhan, and the first analysis comparing the in-hospital outcomes of COVID-19 between cases with CVMs and those without CVMs, in anticipation of finding the risk factors in favor of severe conversion of non-severe case. Conclusions Most hospital staff with COVID-19 had history of patient contact, featured a nonsevere course of disease. COVID-19 patients with CVMs suffered from more inhospital adverse events than those without CVMs. But the concomitant CVMs were not independently associated with in-hospital adverse events in patients with COVIDAlexander E.
