In these latter hosts, the ORF3 gene systematically displays one or two identical deletions leading to the synthesis of truncated proteins gp3-1 and gp3-2. As deletions in CoV accessory proteins have already been involved in tissue or host switch, studies of these different gp3 proteins were conducted in canine and feline cell. All proteins oligomerise through covalent bonds, are N-glycosylated and are maintained in the ER in non-infected but also in CCoV-II infected cells, without any specific retention signal. However, deletions influence their level of expression. In canine cells, all proteins are expressed with similar level whereas in feline cells, the expression of gp3-1 is higher than the two other forms of gp3. None of the gp3 proteins modulate the viral replication cycle of heterologous genotype II CCoV in canine cell line, leading to the conclusion that the gp3 proteins are probably advantageous only for CCoV-I and atypical FCoV strains.",

The rest of the genome comprises genes of the structural proteins S (spike), E (envelope), M (membrane), N (nucleocapsid) and eventually HE (hemagglutinin-esterase) (De Groot, 2006) . Additional genes named accessory genes are interspaced between genes encoding the structural proteins. The number and position of these genes vary from one CoV to another. With eight accessory genes, SARS-CoV possesses the highest number of them, whereas hCoV-229E contains only one (Dijkman et al., 2006) .",

CCoVs are separated into two genetic clusters, CCoV-I and CCoV-II, according to the S gene sequence. One accessory gene, named ORF3 is a singularity of the CCoV genotype I (CCoV-I). Its sequence is highly conserved among CCoV-I, suggesting its importance in some aspects of the viral infection. It is the only CCoV accessory gene which has been investigated so far. In vitro translation assays demonstrated that ORF3 encodes an N-glycosylated protein of 28 kDa, named gp3 (Lorusso et al., 2008) . Still, the function of gp3 remains unknown. Our recent phylogenetic studies conducted on the characterisation of CoV strains infecting cats lead to the discovery of atypical FCoV strains harbouring a feline S gene and downstream genes genetically related to CCoV-I. Sequences of the ORF3 gene were also present in these strains but displayed deletions never described so far. All ORF3 sequences from atypical FCoV strains shared a deletion of 29-nt, which introduced a stop codon and another frequently observed deletion of 27-nt deleted the predicted protein of nine additional a.a. (Le Poder et al., 2013) . The complete gp3 protein of CCoV-I is of 207 a.a. in length, whereas the deleted forms present in atypical FCoV strains are predicted to produce either a deleted protein, named gp3-1 of 158 a.a. or another form, named gp3-2, of 149 a.a. In comparison with gp3, gp3-1 and gp3-2 lost the C-terminus part from the cysteine residue in position 157 onward. Gp3-2 is further truncated of 9 a.a. between http Lys 88 and Phe 96 . All proteins maintain a predicted signal peptide at the N-terminus extremity and a putative glycosylation site on Asn 116 . No other particular functional domain was predicted by in silico analysis.",

Adaptation to a new host is often accompanied by modifications of some accessory proteins, among others (McBride and Fielding, 2012) . With the aim of understanding the role of the gp3 deletions in the adaptation of atypical FCoVs to the feline species, we characterised the basic properties of the different forms of gp3 in both feline and canine cells. The absence of culture-cell adapted strains of CCoV-I and of the newly discovered atypical FCoV strains impaired studies of the different gp3 proteins in cells culture infected with these specific CoVs. Through transient transfection of plasmids expressing the different proteins, we demonstrated that the gp3 deletions influence their expression. The complete gp3 protein is expressed only in canine cells, gp3-1 is expressed at a high level in both canine and feline cells and gp3-2 is faintly observed in feline cell lines. In contrast, all proteins assemble into covalent oligomers and are maintained in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) despite cleavage of their peptide signal and absence of a known specific retention signal. In canine transfected cells and infected by CCoV-II, which does not harbour the ORF3 gene, the gp3 proteins are also localised in the ER but none influence the viral production of CCoV-II strains.",

A previous study explored the biochemical properties of the complete canine anti-calnexin and an anti-CoV serum originating from an infected cat. Cell nuclei were counterstained with DAPI. All slides were observed with a 63\u00d7 oil immersion objective lens by an apotome microscope (Zeiss). At the right, a merged image of the anti-Flag, the anti-calnexin and the DAPI signal is shown.

Here, the expression of the different gp3, gp3-1 and gp3-2 proteins was analysed in cell culture. Proteins were expressed either in canine or feline cells in accordance to the host tropism from which they were derived. The level of expression is different not only between the two cell lines used, but also between the different proteins. In canine A72 cells, the three proteins are expressed at approximately the same level, but in feline cells, discrepancies between them are very marked. Expression of gp3-1 is fivefold higher than gp3 and gp3-2 (Fig. 2B ). Whether these different expressions levels are due to different degradation processes or modulations at the translation step remain to be explored. Expression levels might be influenced by cellular factors involved in regulating protein translation. Interestingly, the gp3 is expressed in canine cells but faintly detected in feline cells which may correlate with the canine virus origin of gp3.",

            "text": "Beside these discrepancies, the proteins have common biochemical properties. In in vitro translation assay, gp3 was expressed in a monomeric form (Lorusso et al., 2008) . Here, in cell culture, we demonstrated that gp3, but also gp3-1 and gp3-2 oligomerise in, at least, covalent homo-dimers and probably in higher multimeric forms, as shown for gp3-1 (Fig. 2C) . The absence of detection of higher multimeric form other than dimers for gp3 and gp3-2 could be due to their fainter expression. The oligomerisation status of CoV accessory proteins has been investigated for some of them. Multimerization has also been demonstrated for the accessory ORF3 from PEDV (Wang et al., 2012) , ORF4a from HCoV-229E (Zhang et al., 2014) or ORF8ab from SARS-CoV (Oostra et al., 2007) . Post-translational modifications are also common to the three proteins in the studied cell lines. In vitro translation indicated that gp3 contains an N-linked glycosylation site (Lorusso et al., 2008) . In cell culture and through the use of different deglycosidases, we were able to identify the glycan residue as a high polymannose (Fig. 3A) , which corroborates with their localisation in the ER (Fig. 4A and B) . Indeed, maturation into complex sugar needs processing by enzymes from the Golgi apparatus and presence of a polymannose is characteristic of proteins residing in the ER. It is still unclear how the gp3 proteins are maintained in the ER, as no peculiar signal for ER retention has been identified (Gao et al., 2014) . Retention of the gp3 proteins in the ER could have been explained by a non-cleavage of the signal peptide. This hypothesis was tested by molecular mass comparison between native gp3 proteins and proteins either deleted off the signal peptide or harbouring a noncleavable signal peptide (Fig. 3B ). The migration difference between 5L mutants and native proteins strongly suggest an efficient cleavage of the signal peptide in native gp3 proteins. Indeed, 5L-gp3-1 and 5L-gp3-2 have a molecular mass higher than the native gp3-1 and gp3-2. The 5L-gp3 mutant migrated at a lower molecular mass than the native gp3. Lorusso et al. (2008) had already observed that the presence of the signal peptide in gp3 induced an aberrant faster migration similar to our observation herein. Thus, retention in the ER of the gp3 proteins is not due to a default in the signal peptide cleavage. To investigate whether viral proteins may influence the subcellular localisation of gp3 proteins, A72 were infected with a CCoV-II strain, which does not express gp3, then transfected with plasmids encoding the different gp3. Again in this viral context, gp3 proteins are localised in the ER (Fig. 4C) . Altogether, these results strongly suggest that the gp3 proteins could be maintained in the ER through interactions with cellular factors, as proposed by studies on the ORF8ab protein of the SARS-CoV (Oostra et al., 2007) .",

            "text": "In the absence of laboratory strains harbouring ORF3 gene, i.e. CCoV-I strains or the atypical FCoV strains, the only way to study the different gp3 proteins in virus infected cells was to infect transfected cells with a CoV strain that does not encode gp3. As the gp3 proteins are better expressed in canine A72 cells than in feline CrFK cells, the impact of gp3 on viral replication efficiency was investigated in transfected A72 infected by a CCoV-II virus. In this context, the viral production is similar in cells expressing gp3 in comparison with the empty plasmid transfected cells or only infected cells (Fig. 5) . As gp3 is present only in CCoV-I strain and deleted gp3 in some atypical FCoV strains, it is plausible that the function of these proteins is crucial only for these particular CCoV and FCoV and thus could not be observed in the model developed herein. However, most accessory proteins have no effect on viral life cycle in in vitro assays (Hodgson et al., 2006; Haijema et al., 2004) , except those acting as viroporins like ORF3 of PEDV (Wang et al., 2012) , ORF3a of SARS-CoV (Chan et al., 2009 ) and ORF4a of HCOV-229E (Zhang et al., 2014) . Nevertheless, their persistence in the viral genome suggests their biological importance in vivo. Yet, recent studies proved that accessory proteins might have a wide range of functions including modulation of viral pathogenicity like ORF7 of TGEV, which absence increases cell RNA degradation and viral pathogenicity in infected piglets (Cruz et al., 2011) . Others act as counteragents of the innate immunity like ORF7a of FCoV or ORF6 of SARS-CoV to name a few (Dedeurwaerder et al., 2014; Frieman et al., 2007) . Some others are crucial in viral tropism. As an example, ORF3c of FCoV is necessary for the confinement of the feline virus in the intestinal tract, whereas FCoV without this gene disperses through viraemia in the feline host (B\u00e1lint et al., 2014) . During host change, mutations of accessory proteins have also been observed, suggesting a possible role in adaptation of CoV to their host. Thus, during the adaptation of CCoV-II to swine, leading to the emergence of TGEV, deletion of ORF7b and ORF3b occurred (Decaro et al., 2007) . In the same manner, whereas SARS-CoV strains infecting bats and civets harbour an intact ORF8ab gene, a 29-nt deletion is systematically observed in strains infecting humans, leading to the translation of two novel proteins 8a and 8b (Guan et al., 2003) . Gp3 has many common features with ORF8ab. Both accessory proteins oligomerise through disulfide bonds and are maintained in the ER without any specific retention signal. The ER is a crucial cellular compartment for folding and maturation of novel synthesised proteins. ORF8ab has been demonstrated to facilitate protein folding by up-regulating the activating transcription factor 6 (ATF6) (Sung et al., 2009) . Whether gp3 could also facilitate viral protein synthesis needs to be further investigated, by studying its impact on the ER protein translation and regulation activities. Deletions in ORF8ab lead to two new putative proteins ORF8a and ORF8b which are unstable in mammalian cells and with different subcellular localisation compared to ORF8ab. In contrast, deleted forms of gp3 conserve the same basic features and could have a similar function than intact gp3.",
