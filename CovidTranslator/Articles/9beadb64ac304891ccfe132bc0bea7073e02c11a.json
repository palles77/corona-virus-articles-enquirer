Fetal brain tissue (gestational age 16-18 weeks) was obtained from elective abortion procedures performed in full compliance with National Institutes of Health and Temple University ethical guidelines. The tissue was washed with cold Hanks balanced salt solution (HBSS) and meninges and blood vessels were removed as previously described [Huang et al, 2011; Ghorpade et al, 1998].. For microglia, brain tissue was supplemented with Ca 2+ and Mg 2+ and then digested with 0.25% trypsin (Sigma) for 30 min at 37\u00b0C. Trypsin was neutralized with fetal bovine serum (FBS), and the tissue was further dissociated to obtain single-cell suspensions. The cells were cultured in DMEM (Sigma), supplemented with a mixture containing 10% heat-inactivated FBS, 1,000 U of purified recombinant human macrophage colony stimulating factor (MCSF) per ml, penicillin and streptomycin (50 mg/ ml), and 100 mg/ml of neomycin. The mixed culture was maintained under 5% CO 2 for 7 days, and the medium was fully replaced to remove any cell debris. The microglia cells released with further incubation were collected and purified by preferential adhesion. Microglia were seeded as an adherent monolayer at a density of 3 \u00d7 10 6 cells/well in a 6well plate and floating cells were removed after 4h. For neurons, tissue in HBSS was digested with papain (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) for 30 min at 37\u00b0C. Tissue was then dissociated to obtain single-cell suspensions by repeated pipetting with small bore fire polished glass Pasteur pipettes. Cells were plated in poly-D lysine-coated dishes at a density of ~ 1.8 \u00d7 10 6 cells/60mm dish in neurobasal media with B27 supplement, horse serum, and gentamicin (Invitrogen). After 2hr of attachment, media was replaced with fresh complete neurobasal media. Twenty-four hours later, cultures were replaced with neurobasal media without horse serum. Four days later, one fourth of the media was removed and replaced with neurobasal media supplemented with fluorodeoxyuridine (FDU) and uridine. Following FDU treatment, neurons were cultured in neurobasal medium with Glutamax and B27 supplement. One half volume of media was replaced every 48h. Purity of cell type specific cultures was assessed by immunolabeling for cell-type specific markers, including Iba-1 for microglia, GFAP for astrocyte and MAP2, neurofilament, and synaptophysin for neurons. CHME-5 microglia-The microglia cell line CHME-5 was kindly provided by Dr. Randal Davis from Oklahoma State University. It was originally obtained from human fetal microglia (Peudenier et al. 1991) transfected with the T-antigen of SV-40 virus (Janabi et al. 1995). Cells were cultured to 70% confluence in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) (Sigma Chemical Company, St. Louis, MO) supplemented with 5% inactivated Zen\u00f3n et al.",

In a recent study, we used monocyte-derived macrophages (MDM) differentiated from blood monocytes from healthy donors as a model of perivascular macrophage to explore the role of cathepsin B on neuronal apoptosis in the brain during HIV infection (Rodriguez-Franco et al. 2012) . Cathepsin B is a cysteine protease of lysosomal origin involved in various cellular processes (Honey and Rudensky 2003) including; apoptosis (Kingham and Pocock 2001) , inflammation, and neurodegeneration (Nixon et al. 2000) . In the previous study, we reported that HIV-infected MDM secreted high levels of bioactive cathepsin B that were associated with increased neuronal apoptosis (Rodriguez-Franco et al. 2012) . We also demonstrated that following chronic HIV infection, cathepsin B does not interact with the lysosome membrane. Absence of interactions between cathepsin B and both of its inhibitors, cystatins B and C, were observed in HIV-1 infected MDM compared to uninfected controls (Rodriguez-Franco et al. 2012) . The increased expression of cathepsin B was also observed in peripheral blood monocytes from the Hispanic women cohort with HAND (Cantres-Rosario et al. 2013) , and from post-mortem brain tissue from a patient with HAND (Rodriguez-Franco et al. 2012) and from MDM and brain tissue of patients exposed to cocaine (Zen\u00f3n et al. 2014 ). However, the contribution of cathepsin B from HIV-infected microglia remained to be determined.",

The results revealed an induced secretion of cathepsin B in HIV-infected microglia that prompted neuronal apoptosis. The results with CHME-5 cells were comparable to primary microglia albeit at lower levels. To assess the relevance of these findings, we determined expression patterns of these enzymes in post-mortem brain tissue from HIV encephalitis (HIVE) and control cases. We found that cathepsin B expression and cystatin C were increased in HIVE cases and was associated with microglial cells and perivascular macrophages. Expression of cystatin B increased in microglial cells with HIV infection.

At approximately 75% confluence, cells were detached from the flask by repeated pipetting with fresh media or PBS against the cell monolayer. Detached cells were transferred to 5-ml polystyrene tubes (BD Falcon, Franklin Lakes, NJ) at a concentration of 5 \u00d7 10 5 cells/ml. The cell suspension was then centrifuged for 3 min at 4\u00b0C and 1200 rpm to obtain the cell pellet. Cells were washed with 1ml of wash buffer (3% FBS/PBS) and labeled with CD4-FITC (1:100; Becton Dickinson) and CCR5-FITC (1:100; R & D Systems) antibodies, or left in the wash buffer alone (unlabeled control) for 30 min at 4\u00b0C. For detection of intracellular cystatin B levels, CHME-5 were permeabilized using the BD Cytofix/Cytoperm kit (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA), incubated with anti-cystatin B (Sigma) antibody (1:1000) for 1 hour at 4\u00b0C. After incubation with antibodies, cells were washed twice with 1 ml of wash buffer and centrifuged. Finally, cells were fixed in 1 ml of 1% paraformaldehyde. Fluorescence was read within 1 hr using a FACSort (BD Immunocytometry Systems, Franklin Lakes, NJ). Flow cytometry data acquisition and multivariate analysis was performed using the Cell Quest software (BD Biosciences, CA). Cells were gated in forward/side scatter dot plots and FITC emission measured in the FL1 (band pass filter 525 nm) channel. Data on scatter parameters and histograms were acquired in log mode. Ten thousand events were evaluated for each sample and the median peak channel obtained from the histograms was used to determine levels of CD4, CCR5, or cystatin B.",

In control cases, cells labeled with IBA-1 (green) typical ramified microglia morphology were observed ( Figure 5A , B, arrowhead) with very low levels of cathepsin B detected (red). In contrast, HIVE cases showed increased cathepsin B (red) in IBA-1 (green) immunoreactive cells with morphologies characteristic of activated microglia ( Figure 5C -D, arrowheads) and macrophages ( Figure 5E , F, arrows) associated with small blood vessels ( Figure 5E , F, vessel lumen indicated by asterisks). Moreover, in HIVE, co-labeling of IBA-1 and cathepsin B in the same cell or closely adjacent cells was detected in microglia or macrophages. Some cathepsin B immunoreactive cells were also positive for caspase-3, a marker for apoptosis, indicating that these cells were undergoing programmed cell death ( Figure 5G , H, arrowheads). Of note, some cathepsin B positive cells were not co-labeled with caspase-3 and vice-versa ( Figure 5G , H arrows), indicating that some bystander cells not expressing detectable cathepsin B were undergoing apoptosis. These results suggest that in HIVE, expression of cathepsin B in IBA-1immunoreactive cells is increased, compared to uninfected control and that its expression is associated with microglia and macrophages. To assess expression of cystatin C, a cathepsin B inhibitor in IBA immunoreactive cells, 3 control and 5 HIVE cases were assessed. As expected, IBA-1 was detected in macrophages/microglia in all control and HIVE cases ( Figure 6A -F, green). Cystatin C expression was observed in IBA-1 positive cells with typical microglial morphology ( Figure 6A , D, C, arrowheads) and in IBA-1 positive cells resembling macrophages and associated with small vessels ( Figure 6E , arrow, asterisks indicate lumen). Cystatin B immunoreactivity was also analyzed in human post-mortem tissues from control or HIV-positive cases, with increased expression levels in microglia from HIVE cases (Figure 7) . Taken together, these results show that in HIVE, cathepsin B, cystatin C, and cystatin B levels are increased compared to uninfected control cases. Cathepsin B, cystatin C, and cystatin B are expressed in microglial cells and perivascular macrophages. Evidence of apoptosis is detected not only in cathepsin B expressing IBA positive cells, but in bystander cells as well.",

These alterations include not only the production of neurotoxins, but also the modulation of normal cellular processes. However, the difficulty and complexity of studying the human brain ex vivo is an obstacle to the understanding of HAND (Jayadev and Garden 2009) .

We compared the expression of cathepsin B and its inhibitors in human primary microglia obtained from our Temple University CNAC to a human microglia cell line (CHME-5), obtained through transfection with SV-40 T-antigen (Janabi et al. 1995) and explored the effect of HIV-1 infection. The initial characterization of CHME-5 by Janabi and collaborators (1995) reported a lack of expression of the monocytic marker, CD4. In our study, however, we found that CHME-5 cells expressed low levels of the CD4 receptor. It has been demonstrated that CHME-5 microglia expresses the CCR5 chemokine receptor; which is known to be one of the principal co-receptors of HIV-1 in the brain (He et al. 1997; Shieh et al. 1998) . CCR5 is also the predominant co-receptor used by several neurotropic HIV-1 isolates, such as HIV-1 DS-br , HIV-1 RC-br , and HIV-1 YU-2 (Albright et al. 1999) . We found that CHME-5 expressed both receptors and were productively infected by HIV ADA , a macrophage-tropic isolate that uses CCR5 as a co-receptor. This viral isolate was originally isolated from peripheral blood mononuclear cells of an AIDS patient with Kaposi's sarcoma (Gendelman et al. 1988 ) and is known to infect primary microglia (Ghorpade et al. 1998b ). Several groups have previously used CHME-5 microglia as a model for CNS inflammation and infectious diseases including HIV (Atanassov et al.; Lachance et al. 1998; Arbour et al. 1999; Chugh et al. 2008; Lucas et al. 2010 ). These groups have transfected CHME-5 with HIV proteins, in contrast to direct infection of CHME-5 microglia cells (Chugh et al. 2008; Lucas et al. 2010 ).",

It is known that HIV infection triggers TNF-\u03b1 and IL-1 inflammatory pathways (Albright 2002; O'Donnell et al. 2006; Ghafouri et al. 2006) , and this action is associated with increased oxidative stress (Guicciardi et al. 2000; Li and Pober 2005) and antioxidant dysfunction (Velazquez et al. 2009 ) during HAND. At low concentrations, cytoplasmic cathepsin B can be modulated by cystatins. Increased TNF and IL-1 promote the release of cathepsin B from the lysosomes (Guicciardi et al. 2000) . When cathepsin B released from lysosomes exceeds the amount of available cystatins, the protease inhibitor system is disrupted and free active cathepsin B can indiscriminately degrade essential proteins and/or be secreted from the cell (Li and Pober 2005) .",

In the present study, we found that HIV-infected primary microglia and CHME-5 expressed significantly higher levels of intracellular cathepsin B compared to their uninfected controls. Results indicated that HIV-1 ADA replicated productively in primary microglia cells. Primary microglia expressed an increased extracellular cathepsin B at 6 and 12dpi compared with uninfected controls suggesting that HIV-1 infection promotes the secretion of cathepsin B. We also showed that cystatins B and C had very different patterns of expression. Cystatin B was found in primary microglia that remained at similar levels in HIV infected and uninfected cells. In contrast, very low but also similar levels of cystatin B were found in both HIV infected and uninfected CHME-5 cells. In primary microglia, cystatin C expression is higher in than CHME-5 and increased significantly at 3dpi in HIV-1 infection compared with uninfected controls. We did not found any difference of intracellular expression of cathepsin B and its inhibitors in primary microglia. These results point out similarities in the intracellular expression of cystatin B in primary microglia and CHME-5 cells. We found that CHME-5 produce low levels of HIV p24 and undetectable cystatin B in supernatants which correlates with the low level of HIV-1 replication found in these cells as well as other tissue macrophages including placental macrophages (Luciano-Montalvo et al. 2008; Luciano-Montalvo and Melendez 2009 ). In contrast high levels of secreted cystatin B at 12 dpi correlates with HIV-1 infection in MDM as reported in previous studies (Mel\u00e9ndez et al. 2011; Rivera-Rivera et al. 2012) .",

In CHME-5 cells, cystatin B appears not to have a crucial role in inhibiting cathepsin B due to its low expression; instead, our results suggest that cystatin C is the main enzyme regulating intracellular cathepsin B. However, high levels of cystatin C prevented the secretion of cathepsin B but did not diminish its activity. These findings are confirmed by studies that reported the sequestration of cystatin C in the cytoplasm, increased levels of intracellular enzyme, and a concomitant decrease in extracellular levels during late HIV infection (Yoshii et al. 2011 ). This could be a mechanism of cellular protection against increments in cytoplasmic cathepsin B released from lysosomes after infection. Cystatin C has been associated with neuroprotection against increased oxidative stress (Pennacchio et al. 1996; Nagai et al. 2000; Wakasugi et al. 2004; Laspiur et al. 2007 ).",

This study also demonstrated that human primary cells and CHME-5 differ in basal levels of cathepsin B and its activity. The opposite occur in primary microglia compared to CHME-5 cells, increased secretion and low activity. However both CHME-5 and primary microglia mediate neuronal apoptosis in response to HIV infection (Huang et al. 2011 ). In addition, our data indicates that microglia derived cathepsin B is an important mediator of neuronal apoptosis and suggest that cystatin C limits cathepsin B activity but is not sufficient to prevent neuronal apoptosis. Our data indicate that the regulation of cathepsin B and its inhibitors is unique for each cell type but together with studies of post-mortem brain tissue supports the role of microglia and perivascular macrophages derived cathepsin B in neuronal injury, as demonstrated recently in MDM (Rodriguez-Franco et al. 2012) . The regulation of these enzymes in response drugs of abuse have recently been study and demonstrate that cocaine increases further cathepsin B secretion and activity from HIV-infected MDM increasing the levels of neuronal apoptosis (Zen\u00f3n et al. 2014 ). Since both primary microglia and CHME-5 increases cathepsin B-induced neuronal apoptosis after HIV infection, CHME-5 cells could be used for further studies of regulation by other CNS cells in response to HIV infection and drug of abuse.",

Primary neurons exposed to conditioned media from uninfected microglia (A), or from HIV infected microglia (B) HIV+ supernatant shows significantly more apoptosis+ neurons (green) compared to uninfected supernatant. Inhibition of cathepsin B with the specific inhibitor, CA-074 decreased the neuronal apoptosis (C). Little or no apoptosis was observed in neurons treated with microglia conditioned medium pretreated with cathepsin B antibody (D). Positive control shows neuronal apoptosis (E) as compared with negative control of culture media (F). Confocal images were obtained on a Zeiss confocal microscope Axiovert 200M with a LSM 510 under an excitation wavelength of 488nm, 20X magnification. Quantitative analysis of staining ratio of apoptotic (green)/non-apoptotic (blue) nuclei was performed using Image-based Tool for Counting Nuclei (ITNC) from Image J software (NIH) to determine the percentage of apoptotic neurons (G). A significant increment of apoptotic neurons is present at 12 dpi (* p < 0.05). A significant decrease of apoptosis is observed in neurons that received the microglial medium pre-treated with the specific cathepsin B inhibitor (CA-074). Specificity of cathepsin B effects to significantly decrease apoptosis was further demonstrated in neurons that received microglia HIVinfected supernatants pre-treated with cathepsin B antibody at 1:500 (* p < 0.05).
