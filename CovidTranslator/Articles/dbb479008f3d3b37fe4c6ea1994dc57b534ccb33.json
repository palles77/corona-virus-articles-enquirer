[11] [12] [13] Furthermore, the use of CAM is documented to be widespread among patients affected by communicable diseases. 14 However, extremely little is known about the CAM-practice motivations of SARS survivors in the post-SARS period and even less is known about the social and cultural meaning of CAM practice to SARS survivors.

At that time, for my doctoral research, I was investigating the cultural construction of the SARS epidemic in Hong Kong. Initially, I reminded myself not to become emotionally involved with the participants and maintaining a distance from the participants to analyse the study results critically. However, I eventually realized that it was challenging to distance myself from the study participants. I began to establish a rapport and friendship with these SARS survivors Several studies argue that becoming closely involved with participants can result in research subjectivity, which presents certain risks such as projection on behalf of the researcher. 17 Analyses might also be hampered because of researchers' 'blind spots' when they are in close contact with study participants. 18 However, subjectivity can also potentially enable researchers to understand their study participants. 19 Exploiting subjectivity and drawing on researchers' experiences can enhance our understanding of study participants. 20, 21 When researchers distance themselves from the participants in an 'objective' manner, it keeps the participants at a distance. 22 Because of the long relationship I have had with the participants of this study, we have become friends, and this friendship, combined with my research skills, has enabled me to increase my understanding of the requirements of the participants and of the challenges they face. My relationship with the SARS survivors also reduced their sensitivity and reactivity to my research procedures, which, in turn, reduced their behavioural changes. Becoming closely and continually involved with the SARS survivors allowed me to immerse myself in, and closely experience, their lives. Concurrently, this enabled me, a person never infected with SARS, to reflect on the struggles of the SARS survivors. This subjective self gives meaning and life to a research study.",

During follow-up treatments, more than half of the participants experienced situations in which their doctors were sceptical when told of the suffering; this strongly motivated the participants to practise tai chi. This participant complained about how doctors' scepticism and lack of empathy motivated her to practise tai chi: In several cases, doctors referred the participants to psychiatry clinics for treatment for their emotional suffering. Such referrals increased the unpleasantness of the participants' treatment experiences, because they suspected that their physical suffering was misunderstood and misdiagnosed as 'psychiatric' problems. Twelve participants were referred to psychiatric outpatient clinics for treatment for emotional problems, and the notion of being misunderstood and misdiagnosed strongly motivated them to practise tai chi. One participant complained: These unpleasant experiences in biomedical encounters motivated four participants to withdraw from the follow-up treatment. They relied solely on tai chi not only because they hoped that it would alleviate their chronic suffering but also because they sought to escape from the scepticism shown by healthcare providers and from the unpleasant biomedical-treatment experiences. A participant who had withdrawn from the follow-up treatment said the following: I feel very bad after each follow-up. I do not think it is a big deal that I am not getting better with regards to my pain, but the doctors' attitudes really annoy me. The doctors thought that I pretended to be sick, and I was accused by these doctors during every visit.

Doctors exercise authority in diagnosing ailments, and the patients are placed under constant medical monitoring and surveillance. 28 This difference in power and the hierarchy intensified the participants' unpleasant treatment experiences. For example, the diagnosis (or misdiagnosis) of psychiatric disorders in the participants signified how the authoritative voice of doctors, asymmetry of knowledge, and the unequal power and treatment relationship between doctors and patients resulted in the participants' unpleasant treatment experiences. Being referred to psychiatric clinics and treated as 'psychiatric' patients was a difficult experience for the participants, particularly because, in Hong Kong, stigmatization and self-stigmatization are common among psychiatric patients. [29] [30] [31] [32] Because of the social setting, being referred to psychiatric clinics increased the vulnerability of the participants to this additional stigma. However, because of the power differential, the participants must passively accept such a stigmatizing diagnosis provided by their doctors, whether or not they wish to accept it. Social stigmas were documented to cause patient distress and delay treatment-seeking behaviour. 33 To avoid playing this passive-patient role and to avoid this double burden of stigmatization, the participants proactively used tai chi practice as a counter-strategy: Their goal was not only to regain an active patient role but also to challenge the authority of doctors. The self-practice and self-directed natures of tai chi were reported to help patients regain a sense of active participation and control in managing their chronic ailments. 24 Compared with biomedicine, CAM is more psychologically accessible to patients because of commonly held cultural views. 34 Biomedicine was 'culturally unfriendly' to the participants because of its power structure, and also because the views on health and disease differ in biomedicine and tai chi. The technical and biological training obtained in biomedicine makes doctors focus on 'diseases'; by contrast, patients are more concerned about the feelings and experiences brought on by an 'illness' than they are about the disease. 35 Because of the disparities in their belief systems, biomedical doctors could not readily understand the participants' physical and social suffering, and thus the doctors appeared to lack empathy. This further motivated the participants to practise tai chi. The long-term self-practice nature of tai chi conveyed substantial symbolic meaning to the participants that they were selfdisciplined in their quest to improve their health, which enabled them to overcome the doctors' misunderstanding and accusations during follow-up treatments. Furthermore, the practice conveyed a moral imperative of doing everything possible among the participants.",

During the outbreak, the SARS patients were not the only ones stigmatised; people in contact with the patients were quarantined at home. 36 Thus, SARS infection was considered to be spread not merely by the patients but by other people who were in the patients' social network. Consequently, people wore facemasks as a preventive measure against infection and, more importantly, to avoid, by adopting this behaviour, moral condemnation. The unfavourable experiences of being stigmatized as 'virus spreaders' and of being isolated throughout the treatment process during the SARS outbreak had a long-lasting impact on the participants. Because of such experience, the participants searched for all possible means to avoid similar moral blame in future epidemics, which motivated them to practise tai chi. The participants were not working merely towards protecting their own health by practising tai chi (or by wearing facemasks during the SARS outbreak); they were also working for the sake of the people in their social network. Tai chi thus served as a moral imperative for the participants that they could demonstrate themselves as responsible citizens who cared about, and were considerate towards, others.",

The participants still remain isolated in their communities; although this isolation is not currently overt, the participants could be stigmatized again if new communicable diseases emerge. Moreover, the participants were prevented from participating in some social and civic activities (such as blood donations). Because of this continuing social seclusion, most of the participants gradually imagined that they would be the first people to be morally accused and stigmatized if another epidemic emerged. To overcome such SARS-associated stigmatization in the post-SARS period, the participants eagerly sought the reassurances of engaging in tai chi practice. Therefore, rather than merely serving as a health-related practice, tai chi became a crucial social activity for the participants. Using CAM serves to empower patients 37 and CAM practices such as tai chi are commonly adopted by chronically ill patients in an effort to overcome social setbacks such as stigmatization and discrimination. 10 Chronically ill patients commonly use CAM as a strategy for building a social network in which people turn to each other for mutual support. 10 Agreeing with this view, this study's participants used tai chi to build a new social network. In many cases, the participants' original social networks dissipated. Even for participants who were able to maintain their original social network, the network was fragile and often failed to function during outbreaks of new communicable diseases. By practising tai chi in a group, the participants sought to overcome the suffering caused by stigmatization and social seclusion: They sought to build a social network comprising people who had similar ailments and social experiences. This improves the social experiences and social functioning of chronically ill patients 38, 39 and enhances their connection and involvement within their communities.",

I knew I had to build a new social network with people who can understand my situation. Hence, I came to practise tai chi. At least these people will not be scared away from me during times of epidemics like the 'pig flu', because we all have the same history and experience of being infected, isolated, and labelled. [P13, 40-year-old female, universityeducated]Preparing for potential stigmatization and discrimination during future epidemics Because the participants often experienced SARS-associated stigmas in post-SARS Hong Kong, almost all the participants perceived tai chi practice as a preparation for overcoming possible stigmatization during future epidemics. This participant explained how she used tai chi to prepare for such potential stigmatization:My colleagues and friends avoided meeting me during the 'pig flu' [swine flu in December 2006]; therefore, I am quite sure I will be labelled again if there is any new infectious disease. It is important for me to prepare myself not only physically but also socially. Tai chi can improve my health; so, I will have a low possibility of getting infected, and thus a low possibility of being labelled. Moreover, practicing tai chi together with other members enables me to maintain another social network. Even if I am stigmatised again, I can overcome it easily.
