In the present study, GL (glycyrrhizin) is reported to lower membrane fluidity, thus suppressing infection by HIV, influenza A virus and vesicular stomatitis virus, but not by poliovirus. GL-treated HIV-1 particles showed reduced infectivity. GL also inhibited cell-to-cell fusion induced by HIV-1 and HTLV-I (human T-cell leukaemia virus type I). However, when cells treated with 1 mg/ml GL were placed in GL-free medium, they showed increased susceptibility to HIV-1 infection and HTLV-I fusion due to enhancement of membrane fluidity. The membrane dependence of GL and GL removal experiments suggest that GL does affect the cell entry of viruses. HIVs with more gp120 were less dependent on temperature and less sensitive to GL treatment than those with less gp120, indicating that the existence of more gp120 molecules resulted in a higher probability of forming a cluster of fusion-activated proteins.",

            "text": "Following attachment and adsorption of viral particles to specific receptors on host cells, enveloped viruses must enter the host cell by making a fusion pore, fusing their own lipid bilayer envelope coat with that of the plasma cell membrane. Fusion occurs via at least two classes of viral proteins in the envelope [1] . The class I model pertains to influenza haemagglutinin, HIV-1 gp120 and the F-proteins from paramyxoviridae [2] , and class II involves E proteins of the flaviviridae and the E1 protein of Semliki Forest virus [3] . An essential feature of class I proteins is the formation of a trimeric helical coiled-coil rod adjacent to the hydrophobic fusion peptide. Class II fusion proteins are predominantly nonhelical \u03b2-sheet-type structures with an internal hydrophobic fusion loop. The loop inserts into the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane enabling trimer formation. In both cases, clustering of several trimers is thought to be involved in the formation of a wide fusion pore. The formation of ring-like assemblies of fusion proteins and their co-operation in the membrane-insertion process have been observed in studies of rabies [4] , baculovirus [5] , influenza virus [6] and Semliki Forest virus [3, 7] . Cell-tocell fusion, by co-cultivation of HIV-1-or HTLV-I (human T-cell leukaemia virus type I)-infected cells with target CD4-positive cells, also requires the recruitment of viral envelope proteins and receptors to the interface as a virological synapse [8, 9] . For cellular fusion, actin-dependent energy transfer [10] [11] [12] may be associated with the assembly of the pre-fusion structures in the membrane, which probably facilitates or results in the lateral movement of molecules via fluidization of both plasma membranes.",

            "text": "The plasma membrane and the viral envelope are liquid or disordered under physiological conditions. The fluidity of the membrane results from anisotropic rotation of phopholipid acyl chains and flip-flop movement of membrane molecules [13, 14] . We quantitatively measured the fluidity of live cell plasma membranes and viral particle envelopes by ESR using 5-DSA (5-doxyl stearic acid) [15, 16] . A correlation between HIV-1 infectivity and fluidity was observed following heating and treatment with fluidity modulating detergent, xylocaine and phosphatidylcholine dipalmitoyl. A 5 % decrease in fluidity suppressed HIV-1 infectivity by 56 %, whereas a 5% increase enhanced infectivity 2.4fold [15] . Fluidities of HIV-1 envelopes were always lower than those of plasma membranes, since cholesterol/protein ratios of viral envelopes were higher than those of plasma membranes [15, 17, 18] . Sterols such as cholesterol serve essential functions in eukaryotic plasma membranes. It has been proposed that excess cholesterol leads to the liquid-ordered (rigid) phase of the plasma membrane bilayer from its liquid-disordered phase [19] . Small changes in plasma membrane cholesterol levels near the physiological set point might evoke large biological responses [20, 21] . Thus it is conceivable that cholesterol or cholesterollike substances associated with plasma membrane and/or viral envelope may play a negative role in the formation of large clusters of fusion proteins to create the fusion pore.",

Since GL (glycyrrhizin), an active component of liquorice roots, has a similar molecular structure to that of cholesterol ( Figure 1 ), its effects on the fluidity of the plasma membrane and viral envelope were investigated. Moreover, GL has been reported previously to show broad anti-viral activities against enveloped viruses such as vaccinia [22] , HSV-1 (herpes simplex virus type 1) [22] , Newcastle disease [22] , VSV (vesicular stomatitis virus) [22] , VZV (varicella-zoster virus) [23] , measles [24] , HIV-1 [25] [26] [27] and SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) [28] viruses. Here, inhibition of viral infection by GL is reported and was shown to be mostly due to suppression of the fluidity of the plasma membrane and viral envelope into which GL was incorporated. Its effects on fluidity were readily reversible when GL was withdrawn from the cultures. This study proposes a new anti-viral strategy to directly suppress the fluidity of lipid bilayer membranes, inhibiting the formation of fusion pores, as one of the host factors important for controlling enveloped viral entry. The availability of GL in clinical settings is also discussed.",

HEK 293T cells were co-transfected with an envelope-deficient NL43 construct carrying the luciferase gene (pNL43-luc) and a pCXN2 vector expressing the envelope glycoprotein from pNL43. Pseudotyped viruses with JR-FL and VSV envelope glycoproteins were produced by co-transfecting pCXN/FLenv and pHCMV-G plasmids respectively. After the cells had been cultured for 2 days, supernatants were harvested, filtered and stored at \u2212 80 \u2022 C. Influenza A viruses (Influenza A/Aichi/2/68) were kindly provided by Dr T.

Treatment of MT-4 and MT-2 cells with 1 mg/ml GL increased the order parameter by 5.1 % and 3.7 % respectively ( Figure 2E ). The fluidity of MT-4 membrane was dose dependently suppressed by GL. The order parameter (0.768) of 1 mg/ml GL-treated HIV-1 C-2 was also higher than that (0.744) of untreated HIV-1 C-2 ( Figure 2F ).

Figure 3(A) shows that the EC 50 of GL was 0.2 mg/ml when MT-4 cells were infected with plaque-cloned C-2 virus from HIV-1 LAI (X4) strain and HIV-1-positive cells were stained and counted using the indirect IF method. Similarly to HSV-1 [22] and VZV [23] , GL-treated C-2 viruses showed significantly decreased (30 %) infectivity of MT-4 cells, indicating that GL affected not only cells, but also viral particles. Similar inhibitory effects of GL (EC 50 = 0.2 mg/ml) were observed when MT-2 cells were used for C-2 virus infection instead of MT-4 cells, and an EC 50 of 0.38 mg/ml GL was obtained by infection of PM-1 CCR5 cells with R5 strain JR-FL viruses ( Figure 3B ). Thus GL had equal effects on both X4 and R5 HIV-1. MT-2 ( Figure 3C ) or GHOST/ CXCR4 ( Figure 3D ) cell infections were also investigated using replication-defective NL43-luciferase virus pseudotyped with NL43 (X4) envelope (NL43-luc virus). In this case, since the virus cannot replicate in the cell, luciferase activity correlated with the ability of the virus to penetrate target cells. Single-round infection experiments showed that the EC 50 was 0.2 mg/ml when MT-2 or GHOST/CXCR4 cells were incubated concomitantly with NL43luc virus and serially diluted GL during the adsorption period. The infectivity of GL-treated NL43-luc viruses for both MT-2 and GHOST/CXCR4 cells also decreased in a dose-dependent fashion. However, the effects seen with GHOST/CXCR4 cells were weaker than with MT-2 cells, implying that GL incorporation into pseudotyped virus particles could impede entrance into target cells. Unexpectedly, pretreating cells with GL had almost no effect on NL43-luc virus infection efficiency, but, in contrast with MT-2 cells, exhibited an enhancement of infectivity of 10 % and 40 % only in the cases of 1 mg/ml GL-pretreated MT-2 and GHOST/ CXCR4 cells respectively. GL inhibited infection by influenza A virus and pseudotyped virus with VSV-G envelope at EC 50 values of approx. 0.2 mg/ml and 0.7 mg/ml respectively ( Figures 4A and  4B) , but showed no effect on poliovirus infection ( Figure 4C) . No toxicity to MT-2 and MT-4 cells was observed up to 10 mg/ml (12 mM) GL and no changes in CD4 and CXCR4 expression on MT-2 cells was detected with 1 mg/ml GL (results not shown). Since viral production (p24 amount) by chronically infected MOLT-4/HIV-1 C-2 cells was unaffected by the treatment with 1 mg/ml GL, the effect of GL on HIV-1 infectivity was not due to the level of transcription of proviral DNA.",

Figure 5 also shows that, when HTLV-Itransformed MT-2 cells were co-cultured with MOLT-4 cells, ballooned-fused cells were also observed ( Figure 5C ) but were almost completely absent in the presence of 1 mg/ml GL ( Figure 5D ). Thus cell-to-cell fusion induced by HTLV-I was also strongly inhibited by the continuous presence of 1 mg/ml GL. However, as with the cell-free HIV-1 infection system, GL pretreatment of effector MT-2 cells, target MOLT-4 cells or both enhanced fusion ( Figure 5E ). The number of ballooned-fused cells increased 3-fold when MT-2 or MOLT-4 cells were pretreated with 1 mg/ml GL ( Figure 5F, lanes 2 and 3) , and by 4 times when both cells were pretreated ( Figure 5F , lane 4). All these enhancements of viral infectivity and cell fusion cannot be explained as being due only to the blocking of the attachment of viral ligand molecules to cell-surface receptors by covering and steric hindrance effects of GL.",

MT-2 cells resuspended in 1 mg/ml GL in PBS after GL-washing (continuously GL-treated MT-2 cells) kept high order parameters between 0.595 and 0.607. In contrast, MT-2 cells resuspended in PBS after washing GL out (GL-pretreated MT-2 cells) exhibited an order parameter of 0.609 at 10 min after washing, which then rapidly decreased to 0.581 at 16 min after washing, and thereafter gradually increased and reached a value of 0.588. It should be noted that parameters of GL-pretreated MT-2 cells after 16 min were always lower than those of untreated control MT-2 cells. The kinetics indicated that GL readily diffused into the plasma membrane to obtain an equilibrium with the outside GL concentration, but quickly diffused out from the membrane when GL was removed from the medium.",

Although GL movement may be passive as a consequence of its chemical hydrophilic and lipophilic properties, the possibility of flipping movements of P-glycoprotein or excretion of GL from the plasma membrane were examined. Verapamil, a flippase inhibitor, binds directly to P-glycoprotein and competitively inhibits drug transport [35] . Treatment of MT-2 cells with 10 \u00b5M verapamil resulted in a slight, but not significant, increase (1 %) in membrane fluidity ( Figure 2E ), and consequently HIV-1 infectivity was enhanced by 40 % (Figure 6C ). No effect on HIV-1 infectivity to GHOST/CXCR4 cells was observed with less than 10 \u00b5M verapamil. However, when GL-pretreated GHOST/CXCR4 cells were treated with verapamil and used as target cells, the infectivity was additively enhanced ( Figure 6C ). The fluidities of GL-pretreated MT-2 cells treated with 10 \u00b5M verapamil increased greatly with time, showing lower parameters than those of GL-pretreated cells at any time points measured ( Figure 6A ). At the very least, verapamil did not block the effects induced by pretreatment with GL. Alternatively, these data may indicate that minimal changes of membrane fluidity induced by GL and verapamil had an influence on HIV-1 infectivity and that the mechanisms by which GL increases fluidity may be different from those of verapamil.",

Apparently, the JR-FL-luc viral preparation was more resistant to the effects of GL than NL43-luc. Dividing the luciferase activity ( Figure 7A ) by the amount of untreated NL43-luc or JR-FL-luc viruses' p24 allowed the viral infectivity of a single viral particle (assuming equal quanities of p24 per viral particle) to be calculated. The results indicated that the JR-FL-luc virus [1241,049/1.5 ng (827 366)] had almost ten times higher infectivity per one viral particle than NL43-luc virus [295 843/3.3 ng (89 649)]. The effects of temperature, another fluidity-modifying factor, on infectivity of the JR-FL-luc and NL43-luc viruses ( Figure 7B ) was also examined. When viral adsorption was carried out at 25 \u2022 C, 37 \u2022 C or 40 \u2022 C for 1 h, viral infectivity was dependent on temperature. Infectivity of the NL43-luc virus increased by 9.5 times from 25 \u2022 C to 37 \u2022 C, and by 3.5 times from 37 \u2022 C to 40 \u2022 C. In contrast, the infectivity of JR-FL-luc was enhanced 2 times from 25 \u2022 C to 37 \u2022 C, and by 1.4 times from 37 \u2022 C to 40 \u2022 C. Thus the highly infectious JR-FL-luc viruses were more resistant to GL and less dependent on temperature than NL43-luc. Western blotting analysis showed that more gp120 per p24 was detected in JR-FL-luc viruses than in NL43-luc ( Figure 7C ). Augmentation of HIV-1 infectivity by increasing amounts of gp120 on virions has been reported [36] [37] [38] , suggesting that multiple-site binding of gp120 with receptors is required to complete the infection. Theoretically, the existence of more gp120 molecules on a viral particle could result in a higher probability of forming a cluster of activated fusion peptides, due to multiple-site binding, regardless of the level of fluidity [39] . This could explain why the JR-FL-luc virus was more resistant to the effects of GL and less dependent on temperature than the NL43-luc virus.",

            "text": "GL is a broad anti-viral agent. It blocks infection by vaccinia [22] , HSV-1 [22] , Newcastle disease [22] , VSV ( [22] and Figure 4B ), VZV [23] , measles [24] , HIV-1 ( [25] [26] [27] and Figure 3) , SARS [28] and influenza A ( Figure 4A ) viruses, but not by poliovirus ( [22] and Figure 4C ). The EC 50 values of HIV-1, SARS virus, VSV and influenza A virus were approx. 0.2-0.7 mg/ml. GL may act in the lipid bilayer membrane, since firstly, a single-round infection system with pseudovirus was used and was effective; secondly, GL acted reversibly only for 1 h during viral adsorption; and thirdly, pretreatment of HIV-1 (Figure 3 ), HSV-1 [22] and VZV [23] particles with GL reduced their infectivity. In fact, GL decreased the fluidity of both the plasma membrane and viral envelope ( Figure 2 ). Because minimal changes in membrane fluidity are logarithmically responsible for infectivity [15] , it is plausible that a reduction of fluidity by GL is the primary mechanism causing inhibition of viral infectivity. It has been proposed that membrane and envelope fluidities play a pivotal role in the formation of the wide fusion pore of enveloped viruses, by clustering a substantial number of activated viral fusion proteins derived from multiple ligand-receptor complexes [39] [40] [41] [42] [43] . In this respect, GL mainly acts against enveloped viruses. In addition, reduced fluidity by GL could easily explain how GL inhibited cell-to-cell fusion induced by HIV-1 and HTLV-I ( [26, 27] and Figure 5 ) by suppressing the formation of virological synapses [8, 9] . When GL-treated cells were washed once and the replacement medium was GL-free, the fluidity of the membrane increased with time ( Figure 6A ), and the cells showed enhanced susceptibility to infection ( Figure 3 ) and fusion ( Figure 5 ). Factors regulating the formation of a wide fusion pore are the number of receptors, number of gp120 molecules and the degree of fluidity. The cells are a mixture carrying a variety of receptor molecules in various amounts. Viral stocks also consist of a mixture of viruses bearing variable amounts of gp120. Cells with few receptors, or viruses with few gp120 molecules, could not form a cluster containing a substantial number of activated viral fusion proteins derived from multiple-site binding [39] . However, increased fluidity could promote sufficient multiple-site binding, thus enhancing the susceptibility to viral infection and fusion. Again, the degree of fluidity paralleled that of infectivity and fusion. What else could explain the observed anti-and pro-HIV-1 activities? Traditional interpretations can be ruled out: non-specific inhibition of viral adsorption such as that by other polyanionic compounds [44, 45] , reduction in cell signalling using pathways such as protein kinase C [26] , induction of interferons in vivo [46] and production of nitrous oxide in macrophages [47] failed to account for GL activities, especially pro-HIV-1 action. One mechanism was found to fully explain the anti-and pro-HIV-1 phenomena: direct modulation of lipid bilayer membrane fluidity by GL. GL could prevent or promote rapid access of fusion proteins and their receptors to modify the pore widening for full fusion during virus entry. Alternatively, GL may impair the curvature of the membrane necessary for the formation of the fusion pore. However, this latter possibility has little to do with fluidity as such.",

High concentrations of GL on the inside membrane restricted the anisotropic movement of acyl chains of 5-DSA and likewise that of phospholipids. Thus GL lowered fluidization of plasma membrane and viral envelope. In contrast, when cells were washed after GL-treatment, fluidization was increased, probably due to rapid reduction of GL content on the inside of the membrane. Rapid GL diffusion out of the membrane might induce the flexibility of acyl chains. The enhanced fluidity of GL-pretreated cells was not due to increased flip-flop movement of P-glycoproteins [13, 35] , because a flippase inhibitor, verapamil, did not block either enhanced fluidity or increased infectivity induced by GL pretreatment of cells. If anything, treatment with verapamil slightly enhanced both fluidity and infectivity and showed additive effects to those of GL pretreatment of cells, which confirmed further that fluidity may play a major role in HIV-1 infectivity.",

Although data about the safety of long-term usage and high doses of GL still need to be collected, the best example of safety is a long history of safe use in clinical settings in Japan. A disadvantage of GL is that it has to be used in high concentrations to exhibit anti-viral activity and to be virostatic. HIV infection could be inhibited at pharmacologically achievable concentrations of GL with very low toxicity in clinical trials [25] , but long-term use of the drug would be unrealistic except in cases of uncontrollable resistant viruses emerging against anti-HIV agents [48] . Rather, one would predict that topical application of high doses of GL would be invaluable for preventing sexually transmitted infections not only of HIV, but also of HSV. Based on the ability of GL to inhibit infections with influenza A (Figure 4A) , SARS [28] , vaccinia [22] viruses and VSV [22] , it is suggested that the compound might be an appropriate drug for more accessible treatment of emerging acute lethal infections such as new types of influenza A, SARS, rabies and smallpox viruses. Since GL directly affected the viral envelope and reduced viral infectivity, the rate of nosocomial infections could be also reduced.",

The discovery of new modes of action for GL offers the additional opportunity for the systematic screening of accessible chemical compounds, such as glycolipids [33, 49] , as membranefluidity modulators. This might provide common therapeutic interventions against a wide range of viruses, with potential for new and highly effective applications.",
