However, since then, the epidemic has rapidly evolved into a pandemic affecting multiple countries worlwide [2] . There have been serious debates about how to react to the spread of this disease, particularly by European countries, such as Italy, Spain, Germany, France and the UK, e.g. from closing schools and universities to locking down entire cities and countries. An alternative strategy would be to allow the causal virus (SARS-CoV-2) to spread to increase the population herd immunity, but at the same time protecting the elderly and those with multiple comorbidities, who are the most vulnerable to this virus [3] .",

Hence, R 0 will only equal R t when there are no immune individuals in the population (i.e. when all are susceptible).
