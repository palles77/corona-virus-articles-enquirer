Most patients present with relapsingremitting disease. An individual develops neurologic symptoms and signs over hours to days and typically recovers in 6-8 weeks. This is followed by various lengths of disease-free periods. Some individuals have few relapses and no residual symptoms, whereas others have frequent relapses and accumulating disability. Approximately one-half of the patients with relapsingremitting disease go on to develop secondary progressive disease. In this case, features of relapsingremitting disease are followed by a gradual decline in function with or without superimposed relapses. Primary progressive disease, which affects 10-15% of individuals with MS, is characterized by a gradual decline in neurologic condition from onset, without relapses. This form of disease progression is typically seen in older individuals, more often males, as a progressive myelopathy. A fourth type, progressive-relapsing MS, is similar to primary progressive MS but with superimposed relapses. The term benign MS is used carefully.

            "text": "There are an estimated 400,000 individuals in the United States who have MS and 1 million worldwide. The prevalence of the disease in individuals of Northern European descent is 1 in 1000, whereas in Asians the prevalance is 2 per 100,000. The highest prevalence rate is 250 cases per 100,000 individuals in the Orkney Islands, north of Scotland. Hispanic, Asian, and African Americans are less likely than Caucasians to have the disease. MS is usually sporadic, and often there is no documented family history. However, some families have shown an increased frequency of the disease and thus attention has focused on the genetic versus environmental features of the disease. The prevalence of MS varies along a north-south gradient worldwide, increasing as one moves away from the equator, even in countries with relatively homogenous racial populations. This gradient of disease prevalence suggests an environmental cause. There are exceptions to this pattern, such as Sicily and Malta, two areas in close proximity, which have a 10-fold difference in prevalence rate. Additionally, there are ethnic groups that appear resistant to the disease in high-risk areas, such as the Hutterites of western Canada and Native Americans in North America, reinforcing the genetic features of the disease. Furthermore, the north-south gradient may be explained by the migration pattern of ethnic groups, as they tended to migrate to similar climates. Studies of individuals moving from high-risk to low-risk areas after puberty show that these individuals carry the risk of the first location for developing MS, suggesting that an environmental factor may trigger the disease early in life. Clusters of cases of MS have been described, but many have not withstood further scrutiny to provide evidence that epidemics of MS occur. In summary, the data indicate that the geographical distribution of MS cannot be due to a single environmental factor, nor can genetic factors alone explain the distribution.",

            "text": "Epidemiologic studies provided early, albeit indirect, evidence of a genetic susceptibility toward developing MS. Studies of monozygotic twins illustrated a 25-30% lifetime risk of developing the disease if one sibling is effected. Dizygotic twins have a risk similar to that of their nontwin siblings (2-5%), which is higher than that for the normal population. Additional studies have shown that the risk is higher in full siblings rather than half-siblings. Siblings of individuals with MS raised in separate homes retain a higher risk of developing the disease. First-degree, adoptive, nonbiologic relatives do not have an increased risk compared to the general population; thus, genetic rather than environmental factors are more likely to explain familial clustering of disease. In the early 1970s, an association between the risk of developing MS and the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) on chromosome 6, which encodes immune response genes, was recognized. The MHC class I and class II molecules are glycoproteins located on a cell surface that present antigen to antigen-specific T cells. An individual's ability to react to an antigen is determined by the MHC region. CD8 + T cells interact with MHC class I molecules on the surface of all nucleated cells in humans; those molecules are known as human leukocyte antigens (HLA)-A, -B, or -C. Class II molecules are present on only some cells, including monocytes, macrophages, endothelial cells, and microglial cells. These antigens are described as HLA-DP, -DQ, and-DR. Although there may be a weak association with HLA-A3, multiple studies have shown an increased occurrence of HLA-DR2 haplotypes associated with MS. Most individuals with MS do not have this HLA-DR haplotype; thus, it is not essential or sufficient to cause the disease. It is also possible that an unidentified gene close to the HLA gene is the susceptibility locus. Recent genetic studies indicate that multiple unlinked genes may influence the risk for developing MS. Each gene may add to the risk. Different genes may influence susceptibility in some individuals and not others. A screen of the entire genome for regions related to risk of MS with anonymous genetic markers identified a susceptibility loci in the MHC region.",

The nonrandom North-South gradient of disease occurrence, described previously, is atypical for other autoimmune diseases and suggests the role of an environmental trigger. The low rate of concordance for monozygotic twins is evidence against MS being a purely genetic diseases. Because twins share many childhood diseases one would expect the concordance rate to be much higher if MS was a result of a nonspecific response to multiple agents. More likely, a specific, poorly transmissible agent leads to activation of the disease. Pathologic studies show that the changes seen in the central nervous system are similar in MS and viral illnesses. Both can produce inflammatory demyelinating lesions in the brain.

''Molecular mimicry'' may explain the immune system response to virus, or other infectious agents. This model suggests that a viral peptide is similar to a component of myelin. The immune system recognizes the foreign viral peptide but cross-reacts with a myelin, resulting in activation of the immune system. Further damage results with exposure of additional myelin antigens. Exposure of antigens may result in epitope shifting, in which the initial inciting antigen no longer remains the sole perpetrator in the immune process. Some viruses (e.g., Epstein-Barr virus, cytomegalovirus, and measles) are known to have peptides that are similar to antigens identified on myelin components. Furthermore, the antigen may not be a component of myelin but an enzyme or regulatory protein, which may affect the immune function in other ways (e.g., permeability of the bloodbrain barrier or myelin metabolism). Superantigens, bacterial or viral envelope components that activate large populations of T cells or multiple clones of T cells, may be another mechanism by which a clone of auto reactive T cells may be activated. Others argue that a latent viral infection results in disease. Periodic relapses would be explained by reactivation of the virus. Progression may be due to failure of the host to inactivate the viruses. Several viruses are known to exist in the human central nervous system and to reactivate. For example, herpes zoster causes chicken pox in childhood and then reactives in the adult as shingles, a disease with rash in a dermatomal pattern. In other cases, a virus remains as a persistent infection. The measles virus causes subacute sclerosing panencephalitis. HIV infections result in various neurologic complications, including dementia. HTLV1 causes a progressive myelopathy. Whether the virus causes direct injury to neural tissue or causes bystander inflammation and demyelination is unknown. Finally, it is possible that viral infection of lymphocytes or other immune cells leads to changes in function of these cells and ultimately altered immunity.",

The target of inflammation may be a component of myelin. The process most likely begins with the T cell. Antimyelin T cells are recognized in the normal adult peripheral blood, but in MS these cells migrate to the central nervous system. Humeral immune responses are also likely, based on the intrathecal presence of immunoglobulins. The antigen recognized by these antibodies has not been determined. Myelin basic protein (MBP) and proteolipid protein make up 30-50% of myelin protein. Myelin oligodendroglia protein (MOG) makes up 50% of central nervous system myelin. This protein is not present in the peripheral nervous system and may be the antigen in this exclusively central nervous system disease. MOG is located on the oligodendroglia surface of the outer lamella of the myelin sheath and is thus accessible to attack.

These T cells induce inflammation, but demyelination does not occur unless the MOG antibody is present. Although MOG may be the initial antigen and inciting factor, exposure as a result of inflammation induces new antigens and epitope shifting. The antigen for this disease is difficult to identify possibly because there are multiple antigens. Figure 1 illustrates the proposed mechanisms for the immune-mediated injury in MS. Genetic or environmental factors (viruses, bacteria, or superantigens) cause activation of circulating T cells. Adhesion molecules on the circulating T cell surface, very late antigen (VLA-4) and lymphocyte function associated antigen (LFA-1), bind complementary receptors on the endothelium, intracellular cell adhesion molecule-1, and vascular cell adhesion molecule-1. Once in the central nervous system, the activated T cell secretes cytokines, including tumor necrosis factor-b (TNF-b) and interferon-g (IFN-g), which in turn activate antigen presenting cells (APCs) including astrocytes, macrophages, and microglia. Class II MCH molecules on APCs and T cells interact in the presence of central nervous system antigen. Costimulating molecules on the APC and T lymphocytes are necessary for activation of T cells. CD4 + cells differentiate into proinflammatory cells (CD4 + Th1) or antiinflammatory (CD4 + Th2) cells. Proinflammatory cells (Th1) secrete cytokines such as TNF-a or -b or IFN-g. The result is activation of various process, that cause injury to myelin or oligodendrocytes. Antibody-mediated injury may be cell dependent or occur via complement activation. Cell-mediated injury induces damage by further release of proinflammatory cytokines. Binding between FAS-ligand and FAS or binding of ab crystallin will result in apoptosis or programmed cell death. Macrophages induce myelin injury by phagocytosis and secretion of toxic substances, such as proteases, nitric oxide, oxygen radicals, and proinflammatory cytokines. Apoptosis may occur via the FAS-ligand interaction.",

Microscopically, the lesions are characterized by inflammation, demyelination, or gliosis. Inflammatory lesions have both perivascular and leptomeningeal infiltration of lymphocytes, monocytes, and macrophages. Histopathologic studies show that macrophages and CD4 + T cells are the most prominent cell types within lesions. There are fewer B cells and plasma cells. Lesions can be further characterized as active (acute), chronic active, or chronic inactive. In the acute lesion, perivascular and parenchymal infiltration with mononuclear cells, such as T cells and macrophages, exists. Cells are mostly large, round, and lipid-laden macrophages. There are variable numbers of CD4 and CD8 cells present. MHC class II positive cells are abundant. Similar findings are seen in ADEM and animal models that have T cellmediated immune responses. In these cases, the demyelination that occurs with MS-type plaques is not present. This implies that there must be another factor present for demyelination to occur. Chronic active plaques have MHC class II cells and lipid-laden macrophages at the border of the lesion but not centrally. Chronic inactive lesions have few MHC class II-positive cells and are hypocellular. Recently evidence indicates that the pathologic process may vary between individuals. Lucchinetti and Lassmann described different types of pathological appearances based on immunohistochemical studies. The first type shows areas of demyelination with no oligodendroglia loss. There is local deposition of demyelinating antibodies and complement activation. The preserved oligodendroglia cells favor remyelination and recovery. A second type has demyelination; however, there is destruction and loss of oligodendroglia cells with the presence of T cells and macrophages in these areas. Local precipitation of antibody and complement is not evident. A third type involves primary demyelination and a gradient loss of oligodendroglia cells toward the center of an inactive plaque. In inactive plaques there is profound oligodendroglia loss. A fourth type describes primary oligodendroglia destruction in white matter near the plaque and resultant secondary demyelination. A fifth type describes demyelination with profound loss of axons, oligodendrocytes, and astrocytes. This is not likely to be due to different stages of the disease since individuals tend to have similar patterns of pathologic changes throughout the brain.

One oligodendrocyte insulates 1-100 axons. The myelin, produced in layers or lamellae, is interrupted by nodes of Ranvier. At the node of Ranvier there is a high density of sodium channels, which are responsible for sodium ion shifts for depolarization. These areas allow for production and propagation of action potentials. Conduction is a saltatory (not a continuous) process. The internodal areas (areas between the nodes of Ranvier under the myelin sheath) have a low proportion of sodium channels and a high proportion of potassium channels, especially in the perinodal region. These potassium channels oppose depolarization. Depolarization produces an electrical charge, which is conducted through the myelinated segment to the next node for depolarization. Myelin increases the speed of conduction and efficiency. With demyelination, slowing of action potentials and conduction block occur. Conduction block prevents propagation of any axon action potential. Sodium channels develop along the demyelinated internodal area as a way to allow for propagation of an action potential, although this is slower. This reorganization of the demyelinated axon results in a higher than normal density of sodium in demyelinated regions. Other factors may interfere with conduction, such as circulating immune factors or edema. In addition to reorganization of sodium channels, resolution of edema or clearance of these factors may restore conduction. Synaptic changes and conduction through normal unmyelinated axons may also restore function.",

Symptoms must be present for at least 24 hr to be considered a relapse, but generally they are present longer. Most common are sensory symptoms. They are often the earliest symptoms and occasional are peculiar in distribution. In addition, sensory symptoms may not have objective findings; thus, they are ascribed to other causes such as stress. Patients often complain of ''numbness,'' but they are often experiencing positive sensory phenomena such as tingling or dysesthesias. The ability to detect vibration in the extremities is often decreased and identified by neurologic examinations early in the disease. Often, the sensory symptoms of MS are due to lesions of the posterior columns rather than the spinothalamic tracts; however, decreased pinprick and temperature sensation can occur. Lhermitte's phenomenon is a sensory symptom in which patients experience sudden, brief electrical sensations along the spine or in the extremities. Less commonly, a radicular pattern of pain may occur and is likely due to demyelination of the sensory root entry zone. Lancinating neuralgias or dysesthesias are not uncommon. A ''useless hand'' develops when there is sensory disruption in the sensory spinal tracts that affects vibration, two-point discrimination, and proprioception. Often, this occurs as a result of a high cervical spinal cord lesion of the posterior columns or in the medial lemniscus system of the brain stem. Although strength is preserved, the hand is difficult to manipulate for tasks because of the sensory disruption. This may occur in other spinal disorders, but when it occurs in young individuals it is most likely due to MS.",

Examination often discloses decreased visual acuity and central scotoma of visual loss. The optic nerve head may appear swollen, with hemorrhages or exudate (papillitis), or may be normal appearing (retrobulbar neuritis) by funduscopic examination. Color vision is often affected and can easily be tested by asking a patient view a red object with each eye separately and compare the difference of appearance. An afferent pupillary defect, elicited by shining a bright light on each pupil, may demonstrate delay of pupillary response or dilatation when the light is brought to the affected eye. Often, visual acuity returns to normal within several weeks. Later, optic atrophy may be detected as a pale optic nerve head evident by funduscopic examination. Other types of visual field defects have been described, including bilateral homonymous hemianopia and quadrantanopias, indicative of lesions more posterior in the visual system.

            "text": "Magnetic resonance imaging was first used in 1981 to study patients with MS. The technique was rapidly accepted in the clinical realm. Images are generated as a result of energy release from protons (positively charged hydrogen nuclei) that have been aligned in the axis of a strong magnet. Water, lipids, and other molecules contain hydrogen atoms, which spin and precess around the main axis. This axis is referred to a magnetization vector. Radio frequency pulses cause the protons to rotate and spin away from the main axis. Once the radio frequency pulse is removed, a signal is induced as the protons return to their original rotation. The signal decays over time and is referred to a longitudinal decay (T1) and transverse relaxation (T2) time. T1 and T2 times are the result of the environment in which these proteins exist (e.g., CSF protons require a longer time to return to equilibrium). The radio frequency pulses can be given at different times and for different lengths of time to generate different types of images that are ''weighted'' toward T1 or T2. This weighting is based on repetition time (TR) or time between pulses and echo time (TE), the time to generate the echo. T1 images have both short TE and TR, whereas T2 images have both long TE and TR. CSF is white in T2-weighted images, as are demyelinating lesions of MS (Fig. 2) . On T1-weighted images some chronic lesions appear as dark areas or ''black holes,'' which indicate tissue destruction and probable axonal loss. Newer techniques, such as fluid-attenuated inversion recovery imaging, cancel the signal from CSF, and as a result demyelinating periventricular lesions are more easily detected (Fig. 3) . Gadolinium, a rare element with paramagnetic substance, is given intravenously to provide contrast enhancement of areas of breakdown of the blood-brain barrier. Because gadolinium shortens the T1 and T2 relaxation time, images appear bright where the blood-brain barrier is disrupted. This enhancement, which is the earliest standard MRI evidence of a newly developing MS lesion, indicates acute inflammation and often persists 2-6 weeks in areas of demyelination.",

Lesions are more destructive than those of typical MS with axonal destruction and neurosis. Age of lesions is mixed, suggesting that disease is present prior to the clinical diagnosis. Balo's concentric sclerosis is another acute illness that has bands of demyelination alternating with preserved myelin areas. The cerebellum, brain stem, optic chiasm, and spinal cord are often spared. Devic's disease or neuromyelitis optica is defined by optic neuritis and myelopathy occurring together or within a short period of time. Pathologically, necrosis has been evident in both optic nerves and spinal cord, probably as a result of ischemia from swollen tissues. ADEM is a polysymptomatic disease that occurs after upper respiratory infection or other viral infection or following immunization. The disease occurs more commonly in children than in adults and includes demyelination in multiple areas, including brain stem, spinal cord, optic nerves, cerebrum, and cerebellum. Patients may have associated febrile illness and can become comatose in rare cases.

As mentioned previously, the majority of patients present with relapsing-remitting disease. Approximately one-half of relapsing-remitting patients experience progression. Many features have been assessed as prognostic markers for future outcome, including the extent of disability at 5 years, age, sex, the extent of initial symptoms, complete or partial remission, type of symptoms at onset (e.g., optic neuritis, sensory symptoms, and cerebellar findings), and attack frequency in the first 2 and 5 years. Favorable prognostic factors are outlined in Table II . Because of the unpredictable nature of the disease, no firm predictions for an individual's course can be determined early in the disease. Of all predictors, the extent of disability at 5 years is most reliable, but patients who have a very mild early course may later develop significant disability. Death as a result of a relapse is extremely rare, although it may occur as a complication of the disease, such as pneumonia or suicide.",

            "text": "Advances in biotechnology have had a significant impact on the treatment of MS. For many years, treatment relied on the use of broad-spectrum immunosuppressive agents that had numerous toxicities. Early trials reported success with agents that did not withstand larger or more detailed investigations. Historically, the disease has been difficult to study because of the wide variability in presentation and clinical course. Large numbers of patients are necessary to show a consistent reproducible response from a drug. The gold standard for measuring disease activity has been the Kurtzke Expanded Disability Scale (EDSS). This 10-point scale, with half-step gradients, measures physical disability. Unfortunately, it is not a linear scale and is heavily weighted toward gait, especially in the middle range of the scale. Newer measures of disability include the Functional Composite, which evaluates gait (25-ft timed walk), upper extremity function (9-hole peg test), and cognitive function (Paced Auditory Serial Addition Test). MRI is used as a surrogate marker for disease activity.",

            "text": "Genetic engineering has led to the manufacture of compounds such as interferon-b (IFN-b) , which is where produced by Escherichia coli or mammalian ovarian cells after gene insertion. Copaxone (glatiramer acetate) is a synthetic compound made of four amino acids. These agents allow for selective immunomodulation and thus lower toxicity. There is conclusive evidence from large-scale trials that these agents are partially effective in the treatment of MS. IFN-b-1b (Betaseron) was the first of these agents to be assessed. The drug was shown to effectively decrease the risk of exacerbation of MS and had the effect of slowing accumulation of new lesions on MRI. Although the drug did not show an effect on slowing progression of disease, as measured by the EDSS, the effect on MRI led many to believe that the long-term outcome of a patient treated with this will be better than the expected natural history. IFN-b-1a (Avonex) was the second agent to be approved by the FDA. This drug has a similar effect on decreasing the rate of relapse. The primary end point of the clinical trial was efficacy in slowing disability as measured by the EDSS, and this drug has the unique feature of FDA approval for that indication. Copaxone was initially investigated as a potential agent to induce EAE. Conversely to what was expected in the animal model, there appeared to be a protective effect, which led to additional clinical trials. Copaxone decreases the risk of a relapse and has favorable effects on MRI. Currently, it is difficult to argue that one of these agents is superior to the others for treatment of relapsing-remitting MS. Fortunately, it allows for patients to have an option. Worldwide use and access are limited by the high cost ($12,000 per year) and administration (intramuscular or subcutaneous injections). The National Multiple Sclerosis Society has issued a recommendation advocating the use of these drugs early in the course of the disease based on increasing evidence that early treatment is likely beneficial in decreasing the inflammatory phase of the disease and preventing axonal injury. Recently, trials of secondary progressive MS have found mixed results with use of beta-interferons. Mitoxantrone (Novantrone) has received FDA approval in the United States for treatment of secondary progressive MS. This immunosuppressive agent was shown to be effective in European studies in slowing progression of individuals with secondary progressive disease or relapsing-remitting disease unresponsive to other therapies.",

            "text": "Future clinical trials will likely lack a placebo group because it is unethical to leave a patient untreated when partially effective therapies are available. As a result, larger and lengthier clinical trials will be necessary to show an effect of newer agents. Surrogate markers for disease activity, including MRI, will be used to assess the utility of drugs prior to large phase 3 trials needed to show clinical efficacy. As our understanding of the pathological processes of the disease increases, it is possible that different therapies will be indicated for different types of MS. For example, in individuals with a notable inflammatory component as determined by MRI or an other tool, use of immunomodulator therapies that have a specific effect on inflammatory aspect of the disease may be most beneficial. In other cases in which little inflammatory disease appears evident, growth factors or other means to stimulate regenesis of cell life may be more appropriate. In cases in which drugs are not shown to be efficacious for MS, the understanding of the pathophysiology of MS increases and thus the trials cannot be considered failures. Finally, until the cause of the disease is found, a cure is not likely. Fortunately, advances in understanding the disease process have been exponential in recent years, allowing hope for control, if not cure, for this disease in the near future. ",
