Infected cultures develop characteristic cytopathic changes, beginning with the appearance of refractile spindle cells, followed by the development of large multinucleated giant cells with long stellate processes, and ending in degeneration of the cell sheet. Newly formed virus is first detected after a latent period of 16-20 hours. Titers increase rapidly during the ensuing 16 hours, and virus continues to be produced until the cell sheet shows extensive degeneration 96-120 hours after infection (Thormar, 1963; Harter et al., 1968) .",

EBTr cells were purchased from the American Cell Type Culture Collection. SV40-transformed lamb choroid plexus (SCP-T) cells were obtained from Drs. 1~. Takemoto and L. Sturman of the National Institutes of Health. Cell lines were maintained in 250-ml plastic flasks in reinforced Eagle's medium (Bablanian et al., 1965) Infection of cells. Monolayers of SCP and EBTr cells grown in 60.mm plastic petri dishes were inoculated at multiplicities of 0.5-2.0 TCIDSO/cell. These low multiplicities were employed so as to prevent the rapid cell fusion and degeneration that occurs when higher virus: cell ratios are used (Harter and Choppin, 1967) . Following adsorption for 3 hours at 36\", maintenance medium containing 2 % heat-inactivated lamb serum and 2.0 pg/ml amphotericin B was added, and the cultures were incubated at 36\" in a humidified atmosphere of 5% carbon dioxide. At intervals of 48, 72, 96, 120, and 144 hours after infection the supernatant from infected cultures was removed, and 0.5% bovine plasma albumin (BSA. Fraction V, Armour Pharmaceutical Co., Kankakee, Illinois) was added. Such material was quick-frozen, stored at -70\" and later assayed for infectivity. The remaining attached cells were prepared for electron microscopy. Control monolayers were inoculated with medium containing 0.5% BSA and handled in a similar manner.",

It has been suggested that these crescent-shaped buds develop into the particles with electron-dense cores (Thormar, 1961) . The present communication does not lend support to this since extensive study failed to reveal transitional forms. It must be admitted, however, that were transition exceedingly rapid the intermediary stages could be so uncommon as to escape notice. Since the particles that lack dense cores and apparently contain cytoplasmic components were not encountered in the density gradient fractions it appears unlikely that they are infectious or represent a helper virus. Rather they may be segments of detached host cell membrane, which has become altered as a result of viral infection so as to resemble the envelope of the buds. A similar phenomenon has been described in the case of herpesvirus infected cells (see 17 , and 18 of the paper by Nii et al., 1968 ). In the latter study it was suggested that when such altered segments of the host cell come into contact with the surface membrane of uninfected cells fusion occurs in a manner similar to that associated with fusion of the viral envelope at the time of entry (Rlorgan et al., 1968) . It is of interest in this connection that visna virus also causes cell fusion (Harter and Choppin, 1967) . Possibly the mechanism of cell fusion is analogous.",
