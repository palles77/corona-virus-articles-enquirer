Design/methodology/approach -We collected survey data from 321 adults in a large western US city during November 2009 by mall and street intercepts. We analyzed their beliefs, attitudes and intentions with regard to adoption of the H1N1 (swine flu) vaccine. We developed and tested two alternative models on the role of mass media and personal information sources on the attitude towards the disease and the intention to get vaccinated. Findings -Our study finds that mass media and personal sources of information simultaneously impact perceived threat from disease (attitude) and the intention to get vaccinated during a global pandemic. Personal information sources are more effective than mass media sources in impacting both attitude and intention. While the impact of mass media weakens from the attitude stage to the intention stage, the impact of personal information sources increases from the attitude stage to the intention stage. Originality/value -The contribution of this paper to health policy makers and marketers is to draw implications on how mass media and personal information sources could be better utilized to counter future global pandemics.",

The first pandemic of the twenty-first century was caused by a new combination of bird, pig and human viruses that spread quickly from person to person. Eighty per cent of the victims were under 65 years and 30 per cent had no underlying health risk factors (Dawood et al., 2012) . This was a big difference from the regular or seasonal flu, which affects mainly the elderly and those with weak health.",

In 1918, the Spanish flu epidemic caused by an H1N1 strain resulted in 4 million deaths during a four-week period (Ahmed et al., 2007) . In 1976, following a swine flu infection in Fort Dix, New Jersey, the first mass influenza virus vaccination was developed. The mass vaccination program that followed exposed a serious side effect called Guillain-Barre syndrome, an acute disorder that can cause paralysis and death (Wang and Palese, 2009 ). All of these reports elevated public concerns about the serious threat of the 2009 H1N1 virus and the safety of the vaccine developed to prevent its spread.",

Concerns of the US public were well-documented in several published national polls. A limited amount of vaccine was available between July-October 2009, so only about half the US public said they expected to receive the vaccine, while a higher percentage said they expected to get their children vaccinated. In making their decision, some people appeared to make a trade-off between the perceived risk of the virus and the perceived risk of the vaccine (ABC News/Washington Post Poll, 2009 ). The proportion of the US public that was concerned with getting sick from the H1N1 virus dropped from about 60 per cent in October 2009 to about 40 per cent in December 2009. By December 2009 the vaccine had become more widely available, yet only 14 per cent of US adults had been vaccinated (Steelfisher et al., 2010) , a low uptake of concern to health officials.",

First, health policy-makers need to know what factors affect individuals' decisions to get a new minimally tested vaccine against a deadly contagious disease. As a follow-up, healthcare marketers can help design a communications approach to encourage adoption of the vaccine and minimize the number of deaths in future pandemics. Providing timely, accurate information about the seriousness of the threat and the availability of a safe, effective vaccine through appropriate information channels could motivate individuals to get vaccinated and stay healthy during future pandemics.",

A cross-sectional survey of 584 residents in Sydney, Australia, in May 2009 (Seale et al., 2009) showed that about 40 per cent of the respondents felt that health authorities were exaggerating the risk of the pandemic, and about 58 per cent felt the government would deal with the pandemic effectively. Another survey of 387 students at higher education institutions in Israel in December 2009 (Teitler-Regev et al., 2011) found that the factors positively affecting the intention to take the swine flu vaccine were past experience with the seasonal flu vaccine, higher levels of perceived susceptibility to the illness, perceived seriousness of illness and lower levels of barriers. However, in both these studies, there was no attempt to investigate the impact of information sources on risk perceptions or compliance. This paper is organized as follows. In the next section, we review the existing literature to develop a baseline model and an alternative model of the effect of information sources on attitude towards a new vaccine, and the intention to get vaccinated. A description of the data collected and empirical testing of both models follows, which shows that the alternative model has a better fit with the data. Then, we discuss the public policy and marketing implications of the alternative model. The paper concludes with a discussion of the study limitations and ideas for future research.",

The intention to act is, in turn, influenced by attitudes towards performing that behavior, which is, in turn, influenced by beliefs (Fishbein and Ajzen, 1975) . The health belief model (HBM), in this tradition, posits that the likelihood of an individual engaging in a preventive healthcare action, like getting vaccinated, is a function of the degree of threat from disease perceived by the person and a benefits-to-cost analysis of the preventive actions (Janz and Becker, 1984) . Risker (1996) explicitly introduced information sources into the HBM. Individual differences (e.g. demographics), cues to action (e.g. mass media and personal sources of information) and past behavior affect the perceived threat from disease (attitude), which in turn affects the intention to get vaccinated. Such HBMs have received empirical support in the literature (Jayanti and Burns, 1998) .",

A Hong Kong study of the severe acute respiratory syndrome epidemic found that people were more likely to comply with health-related recommendations if they believed the government was providing clear and sufficient information and could be trusted to control the spread of infection (Tang and Wong, 2004) .

Independent of behavioral choice theory and healthcare research, media effects research and the theory of diffusion of innovations has looked at the communication mechanisms by which information sources affect peoples' attitudes, intentions and behavior. Media effects research recognizes differences in credibility between personal and mass media information sources and their corresponding impacts on attitudes, intentions and behavior (e.g. Lee et al., 2007) . In the diffusion of innovation literature, Rogers (1962) categorized segments of a population as innovators, early adopters, early majority, late majority and laggards based on their timing of adoption of innovations. Katz and Lazarsfeld (1955) proposed a two-step flow of communication, where mass media information sources first affect the attitudes of opinion leaders, who then use personal influence (word-of-mouth) to change the beliefs, attitudes, intentions and behavior of the rest of the population. Integrating these two research streams, Robertson (1967) suggested that mass media advertising was more effective in influencing the innovators and early adopters, while personal word-of-mouth information was more effective in influencing the early majority, late majority and laggards.",

Respondents were provided a list of information sources and asked, \"What is your current source of information about the H1N1 virus and the vaccine?\" (they could select multiple sources -Appendix Q10). For any selected source, they were asked to rate the level of trust they had in that source on a five-point Likert scale (1 \u03ed low trust, 5 \u03ed high trust) (Appendix Q10). Information sources were categorized into mass media (government, news media and non-news Internet) and personal sources (doctor, school, work and friends/family).

Therefore, mass media sources (government, news media and non-news Web sites) should be used more up front in the campaign to shape attitudes towards the perceived threat of the pandemic.

This was the case during the H1N1 swine flu pandemic of Fall 2009. Our measure of cost-benefit trade-off in Figure 1 only took into account the safety of the vaccine, which is quite narrow. Cost-benefit should also include access to and availability of the vaccine and the costs or barriers in that regard. Including a broader conceptualization and operationalization of the cost-benefit trade-off in the HBM would be highly desirable in future research. Another limitation is that different segments may respond to information sources differently. For example, mass media sources may be more effective among mature consumers (Moschis and Friend, 2008) . Therefore, future research may investigate segment specific media habits.",
