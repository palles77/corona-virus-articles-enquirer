Sample procurement has previously limited gastrointestinal cytology to the evaluation of thoracic and abdominal fluid (Chapters 8 and 9), necropsy specimens, and fecal material. Endoscopy, laparoscopy, and ultrasonography have made visualization and biopsying of gastrointestinal lesions physically and economically possible.

Cytologic patterns such as hemorrhage, chronic inflammation, or necrosis, although not specific diagnoses, may provide helpful prognostic information or presumptive diagnoses. A negative cytologic examination, however, cannot rule out a neoplastic or inflammatory disease. Sample size, quality of specimen, effect of therapy on tissue reactions, representativeness of sample, propensity of biopsied cells to exfoliate, and cytologic differentiation of reactive cells versus neoplastic disorders are concerns with cytologic diagnoses.

If an abnormality such as abnormal masses, enlarged lymph nodes,thickened loops of bowel,or excessive abdominal fluid is found, ancillary diagnostic tools such as endoscopy, ultrasonography, radiography, or abdominocentesis can more specifically define the disorder.Endoscopic biopsies are usually small (1.8 to 2.3 mm) but sufficient for diagnostic purposes. Collection of excellent quality biopsies is challenging, especially with endoscopy and laparoscopy. Experience and teamwork are essential for the collection of good endoscopic or laparoscopic biopsies. Biopsy instrument slippage, incorrect angle placement, hemorrhage, risks of full-thickness biopsying, and iatrogenic perforation of the diseased gut with the endoscope are serious problems to manage.

The horse appears to be a continuous, variable gastric hydrochloric acid secretor with intermittent periods of spontaneous alkalization. 9 Duodenogastric reflux, which is common in the horse, can contribute to this alkalization. Gastric fluid pH values are typically less than 2.0 during feed deprivation but can be greater than 6.0 after free access to timothy grass hay. 9 Cytologic examination Esophagoscopy is commonly performed by nasopharyngeal placement. Advance the scope smoothly and observe the characteristic whitish esophageal mucosa of a collapsed esophagus. If esophageal placement is uncertain or tracheal rings observed, withdraw the scope and make another attempt.Never force the endoscope without knowing its course. Pharyngo-oral retroflexion is a serious risk to equipment, and esophageal perforation is a serious risk to the horse. Examine the stomach along with the esophagus because gastric lesions frequently accompany esophageal lesions. For adequate visualization of the stomach in the adult horse, withhold food for at least 12 hours and water for 6 hours if the horse can tolerate water deprivation. 6 To examine the duodenum, pass the endoscope along the greater curvature of the stomach and through the pylorus. This takes patience and experience. For colonic and rectal endoscopy, remove the feces either manually or, in small horses,using an enema.Pass a well-lubricated endoscope into the rectum.Air insufflation distends the esophagus or gastrointestinal tract for better mucosal visualization, especially for ulcers. Transrectal (5 MHz) and transabdominal (2.5 to 3.5 MHz) ultrasonography can be used to visualize and take a transcutaneous aspiration or punch biopsy of a mass. 8 Once collected,biopsy specimens can be gently rolled on glass slides or imprinted for cytology before placing in 10% buffered formalin for histopathologic examination. Additionally, firm or particulate material can be scraped or squashed and aspirated material can be smeared like a blood smear. Suspected infectious lesions should be cultured and cytology can be valuable in selecting the appropriate culture media.",

Alimentary lymphoma is associated with local to diffuse thickening of the gut wall and marked enlargement of the mesenteric lymph nodes. 14 Neoplastic infiltrates can extend from the lamina propria and submucosa to the serosal surface. The lymphocyte population can vary from sheets of lymphoblasts or granular lymphocytes to a mixed population of large and small lymphocytes (Figs. 6-12 to 6-15). 14-18 Cytoplasmic granules in granular lymphoma cells are readily seen on cytology but may be poorly visible on histopathology. 15 Plasmacytoid cells and plasma cells can be abundant, and giant cells can occasionally be seen in the gut wall and lymph node of horses with lymphoma. 13, 14 A recent study of equine malignant lymphomas found that 77% (24/31) were high-grade tumors composed of large, atypical cells of B-cell origin. 16 The only intestinal lymphoma in this study was classified as a multicentric T-cell lymphoma, and all lymphomas with thymic masses were of T-cell origin. Forty-six percent (11/24) of the B-cell lymphomas were T-cell-rich, 17 Additionally, a B-cell lymphoma was diagnosed in a horse with Sezary-like cells in the peripheral blood, cutaneous nodules, heart, abdominal cavity, and ventral colon. 18 Paraneoplastic hypereosinophilia, although uncommon, has been reported in a horse with intestinal lymphoma. 19 Squamous-cell carcinoma, which is the second most common malignant neoplasm of horses, is the most common tumor of the equine esophagus and stomach. 13, 20, 21 Cytologically, squamous-cell carcinoma has been classified into three groups 20 : 1. Well-differentiated (>50% well-differentiated squamous cells called flakes and up to 30% round or oval squamous cells) 2. Moderately differentiated (>50% round or oval squamous cells and lesser numbers of flakes) 3. Poorly differentiated (round or oval pleomorphic cells with rare flakes) Neoplastic cells frequently occur in thick cell clusters or sheets (Fig. 6-16) . Thinner areas or individualized cells must be scrutinized to evaluate cellular details (Figs. 6-17 to [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] . Marked variation in cell size, nuclear size, nucleolar size and shape, and number of perinuclear or large cytoplasmic vacuoles may be present. Cells from well-differentiated squamouscell carcinoma are large polyhedral to spindle-shaped squamous cells with low nuclear to cytoplasmic ratios and abundant pale blue cytoplasm that forms angular borders. Cells may also appear dendritic, round, elongated, or caudate and have several colorless, refractile, or minute deep pink to purple cytoplasmic granules or a diffuse pink-to reddish-tinged cytoplasm. The nucleus is small, oval to round to irregular, with coarse chromatin. Irregularly shaped chromocenters and nucleoli, presence of cytoplasmic rings (dyskeratosis), ",

Therefore, for the best cytologic interpretation,other causes for the presence of squamous cells in the sample must be ruled out. Two conditions that might be associated with squamous cells are ruptured gastric ulcers (possible dysplasia and neutrophilic inflammation) and inadvertent aspiration of amniotic fluid from a pregnant mare. Esophageal-gastric ulcers usually occur in foals or young horses whereas squamous-cell carcinomas usually occur in older horses (6 to 18 years of age). 21 Endoscopy and ultrasonography are helpful in confirming a cytologic opinion. Squamous-cell carcinomas have a propensity to seed organ surfaces and metastasize extensively throughout the pleural and peritoneal cavities, similar to mesothelioma, resulting in pleural and peritoneal fluids containing carcinoma cells. Most horses with gastric squamous-cell carcinoma have abundant peritoneal fluid that is characterized by a neutrophilic inflammation, hemosiderophages, and erythrophagia. 21 Sediment concentration and cytospin preparations increase the probability of finding squamous epithelium and evidence of neoplastic cytologic features in these samples.",

Disseminated peritoneal leiomyomatosis is a rare nonmalignant, multicentric proliferation of smooth muscle tissue that develops in the abdomen of females. 26, 27 Pedunculated lipomas associated with the intestinal mesenteric adipose tissue are well documented but infrequent causes of intestinal obstruction in aged horses. 28 Neither these tumors nor lipomatosis (uncommon benign infiltrative form of lipoma) can be definitively diagnosed by cytology. 8",

Although Campylobacter jejuni and enterotoxigenic E. coli have been isolated from foals with diarrhea, their significance is unclear. 13 Equine monocytic ehrlichiosis (E. risticii) causes Potomac horse fever, a condition characterized by diarrhea, leukopenia, fever, and depression. Lesions in the intestines include hyperemia, congestion, hemorrhage, ulcers, and superficial necrosis. Ehrlichia spp. are obligate intracellular bacterial pathogens that replicate within the phagosomes of host cells. E. risticii, unlike E. equi, has not been identified on peripheral blood smears.The organisms are also not evident in hematoxylin and eosin-stained tissue but appear as small clusters of 10 to 15 fine brown dots (less than 1 \u03bc in diameter) in epithelial cells and macrophages with modified Steiner silver stain. 13 Proliferative enteritis characterized by small intestinal thickening, crypt epithelial-cell hyperplasia, curved intracellular bacteria, and severe enteritis has been described in several foals.

Candida spp., budding yeast that are normal mucosal flora of the alimentary tract, can become opportunistic invaders with changes in the microenvironment. Branching, filamentous pseudohyphae and hyphae can replace the yeast forms. Gastroesophageal candidiasis occurs most frequently in foals and is associated with ulceration of the squamous epithelium. 13 Parasitic Agents: Equine gastrointestinal parasites are listed in Table 6 -2. 13, 38 Encysted small Strongylus larvae (cyanthostomes) have become the principal parasitic pathogen of horses. 39, 40 These encysted larvae, unlike small and large strongyles, are resistant to most modern anthelmintics. These small Strongylus larvae enter the large intestinal mucosa where they may arrest for years and accumulate to massive numbers. Clinical disease is associated with the simultaneous emergence of these encysted larvae. Risk factors for cyathostomosis are young horses, early spring, and recent anthelmintic treatment. 39 Acute-onset diarrhea and acute weight loss are the most common signs of this syndrome. Diagnosis is facilitated by finding excysted larvae on a rectal sleeve following rectal examination. Other laboratory findings may include peripheral neutrophilia and hypoalbuminemia. 39, 40 Equine cestodiasis (Anoplocephala perfoliata infections) also appear to be increasing. 39, 41 Infections have been associated with colic, intestinal perforations, and intussusceptions at the ileocecocolic junction. Development of a serologic assay for A. perfoliata has enhanced diagnosis. Difficulties with fecal flotation relate to resistance of cestode eggs to float and passage of intact tapeworm segments without the release of eggs. 39 Ciliated protozoa are abundant in the large intestine of the horse. Little is know about their function but many are bizarre nonpathogenic organisms (see Figs. 6-9 to 6-11). Chronic diarrhea has been associated with the presence of many fecal flagellates, especially Tritrichomonas; however, the pathogenicity is uncertain. 38 Ciliated protozoa can invade the intestinal tract,but they can be postmortem invaders of colonic mucosa in enteric and nonenteric disorders. 13, 42 Another protozoan, Eimeria leuckarti, may be frequently found in foal feces, but its pathogenicity is also questionable. 13, 38 The interpretation of infections with Giardia and Cryptosporidia are not straightforward, but newer more sensitive and specific tests such as immunofluorescent tests and fecal enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays are available to diagnose Cryptosporidium and Giardia. 43 In foals, infection rates with either Cryptosporidium or Giardia can be high ( about 15% to 35%), even in foals without clinical signs (Fig. 6-20) . 43 Other Causes: Amyloid-associated gastroenteropathy is rare but when present is associated with malabsorption and enteric protein loss. 44 On cytologic preparations, amyloid appears as a homogenous pink extracellular staining matrix. Cytology is of limited help in diagnosing blister beetle poisoning or uremic gastritis/gastroenteritis, which are associated with nonspecific hemorrhagic lesions. 45 ",

Normally, fecal smears contain large numbers of a mixed bacterial population, mucus, plant material, a few epithelial cells, and a lack of inflammatory cells. Feces in sick horses should be examined for occult blood, sand, clostridial organisms, Salmonella organisms, giardial cysts, cryptosporidial oocysts, ciliated protozoa, parasitic ova, parasitic larva, and WBCs. Ciliated protozoa should be present in normal fresh feces. Absence or massive numbers of ciliate protozoa indicate severe alternations of colonic flora. Fecal WBCs indicate an active inflammatory disease. If eosinophils are numerous, further investigations for eosinophilic gastroenteritis should be undertaken.Direct smears can be valuable in addition to flotation tests to detect parasites such as trophozoites or cestode eggs that are destroyed or do not levitate in flotation fluids.",
