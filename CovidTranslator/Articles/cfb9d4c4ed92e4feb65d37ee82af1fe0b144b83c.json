            "text": "The angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is an important regulator of the renin-angiotensin system and was very recently identified as a functional receptor for the SARS virus. The ACE2 sequence is similar (sequence identities 43% and 35%, and similarities 61% and 55%, respectively) to those of the testis-specific form of ACE (tACE) and the Drosophila homolog of ACE (AnCE). The high level of sequence similarity allowed us to build a robust homology model of the ACE2 structure with a rootmean-square deviation from the aligned crystal structures of tACE and AnCE less than 0.5 A. A prominent feature of the model is a deep channel on the top of the molecule that contains the catalytic site. Negatively charged ridges surrounding the channel may provide a possible binding site for the positively charged receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the S-glycoprotein, which we recently identified [Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 312 (2003) 1159. Several distinct patches of hydrophobic residues at the ACE2 surface were noted at close proximity to the charged ridges that could contribute to binding. These results suggest a possible binding region for the SARS-CoV S-glycoprotein on ACE2 and could help in the design of experiments to further elucidate the structure and function of ACE2.",

            "text": "Enveloped viruses enter cells by binding their envelope glycoproteins to cell surface receptors followed by conformational changes leading to membrane fusion and delivery of the genome in the cytoplasm [1] . Very recently, the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) was identified as a functional receptor for the SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) [2] and its binding site on the SARS-CoVS glycoprotein was localized between amino acid residues 303 and 537 [3] . ACE2 is a homolog of the metalloprotease angiotensin-converting enzyme ACE [4, 5] and was found to be an essential regulator of heart function [6] . ACE exists in two isoforms-somatic ACE, which has two homologous domains each containing an active catalytic site, and testis-specific ACE (tACE), which corresponds to the C domain of somatic ACE and has only one active site. ACE2 has a high level of similarity (sequence identities 43% and 35%, and similarities 61% and 55%, respectively) to tACE and the Drosophila homolog of ACE (AnCE). Recently, the crystal struc-tures of tACE [7] and the Drosophila ACE homolog AnCE [8] have been determined at resolutions 2.0 and 2. 4 A, respectively. These crystal structures were used as templates to build an accurate (root-mean-square deviation (rmsd) less than 0.5 A) three-dimensional (3D) model of ACE2 by comparative (homology) modeling. Based on the ACE2 model, an analysis of the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV S-glycoprotein, and similarity with other interactions of viral envelope glycoproteins (Env) with receptors [9] , we propose a possible mechanism of the ACE2 function as a receptor for the SARS virus. The analysis of the ACE2 model could also help in the design of experiments to further elucidate the structure and the dual function of ACE2.",

We used the tACE and AnCE structures to find out topologically equivalent residues based on structural alignment and the structurally conserved regions (SCRs) were modeled. The structurally variable regions (loops) were modeled by using loops either from the corresponding location of the homologous protein or from the general protein database. The 3D model of ACE2 was then subjected to energy minimization by using standard Tripos force fields and finally validated with the PROCHECK program [13] .

We found two proteins, tACE and AnCE, with available high resolution crystal structures, and ACE2 sequence identities of 43% and 35% (sequence similarities are 61% and 55%), respectively; the sequence alignment of ACE2 with tACE and AnCE2 is shown in Fig. 1 .

            "text": "Interactions of viral attachment proteins with protein receptor molecules are mostly determined by complementarity in surface charge distribution, hydrophobic interactions, and geometry; typically carbohydrates are excluded from the binding sites [9] . In an attempt to provide working hypothesis for possible regions involved in the interaction of the S-glycoprotein with its receptor we analyzed the ACE2 surface potential, solvent accessibility, hydrophobicity, and carbohydrate distribution. The surface of the deep channel at the top of ACE2 and the surrounding ridges is highly negatively charged (Fig. 3A) . These ridges contain residues D136, E150, N154, D157, D292, D295, and D299 some of which have large ASA values, e.g., D136, N154, and D157 have 109, 108, and 80 A 2 , respectively (Fig. 4) . Comparison of these residues with the corresponding residues from ACE that do not support fusion mediated by the S-glycoprotein [2] , and mouse ACE2 that binds to S but with somewhat lower affinity than human ACE2 (M. Farzan, personal communication) (Fig. 5 ) supports the possibility that some of these residues contribute to specific binding. The hydrophobicity analysis revealed distinct hydrophobic patches in close proximity to the negatively charged ridges (Fig. 3D) . There are at least three hydrophobic regions comprising different residues including Phe, Trp, and Tyr which could contribute to binding in addition to the charged binding surface. All carbohydrate sites are topologically apart from the electronegative surface at the top of the molecule (Fig. 3B) .",

The sequence similarity of the attachment glycoprotein (S1) from the SARS-CoV to other coronavirus S1 glycoproteins or other proteins with known 3D structures is even lower. Such low sequence similarity does not allow accurate homology modeling. Due to the absence of significant sequence similarity, we built a model by threading (data not shown) of a fragment (amino acid residues 300-537) containing the S RBD that we have recently identified [3] . The electrostatic analysis of the model revealed mostly positive charges on the surface and, particularly, an electronegative loop containing residues K439, R441, R444, H445, and K447. The hydrophobic analysis suggested several patches of hydrophobic residues around the positively charged loop region. One must note that although the size of the fragment is relatively small, the S RBD modeling has limitations in the absence of a template structure(s) with high sequence identity. Thus, the RBD model could significantly deviate or even be completely different from the real structure. In this aspect modeling of the much larger S1 and S2 units is even less reliable. For example, a recent model [20] of S1 and S2 proposed putative receptor (thought to be CD13) binding regions located in S2 instead of S1 where RBDs of coronaviruses should be. This is why we used our RBD model mostly as an illustration of possible complementary charged surfaces, hydrophobic patches, and b-sheets, and complemented it with an analysis of the Fig. 4 . Solvent accessible surface areas (right column, in A 2 ) for ACE2 amino acid residues that are significantly exposed to solvent at the surface of the molecule. The cut-off for significant surface exposure here is assumed to be 45% ratio value defined as the ratio of side-chain surface area to a \"random coil\" value per residue in the tripeptide Gly-X-Gly. The middle column represents the amino acid residue number. Fig. 5 .

Identities are marked by a pipe (j), highly conservative replacements by a colon (:), and replacements with lower scores by a dot (\u00c1). The numbers denote the amino acid residue positions in the sequence. Note that the similarity of these ACE2 residues with the corresponding residues of mouse ACE2 is much higher than with the respective human ACE residues. secondary structure of the RBD fragment that also revealed predominance of b-sheets (data not shown).

The model structure of ACE2 indicates that some or most of the ridges surrounding the cavity at the top of the molecule (Fig. 6 ) could serve as a likely binding region for the Sglycoprotein for the following reasons. First, the top of the molecule is far away of the membrane and is likely to be easier to reach than membrane proximal regions. Second, protruding structures are likely to be used for binding by viral proteins; it will also ensure geometric complementarity with concave surfaces as the S RBD domain could be based on our illustrative model (Fig. 6) . Third, the negative charges of the ridges complement the positive charges of the RBD. Fourth, the hydrophobic patches around the charges could contribute to binding. Finally, the lack of carbohydrates at the top of the molecule could ensure high-affinity binding. Experiments currently in progress will determine the specific amino acid residues and their relative contribution to the interaction of ACE2 with the S-glycoprotein. The ACE2 model developed here, and this proposition of binding regions could help in the design and analysis of the experimental data, and the virus binding function of ACE2.",
