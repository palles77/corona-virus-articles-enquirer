            "text": "The analysis of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) has been described as the central nervous system equivalent of the complete blood count (Jamison and Lumsden, 1988) , and the analogy is a good one. A CSF analysis provides a general index of neurologic health and often provides evidence of the presence of disease. Similar to a complete blood count, CSF analysis has reasonable sensitivity but low specificity. The possible alterations of CSF are relatively limited compared to the varieties of neurologic diseases that exist (particularly if the analysis is restricted to total cell counts and total protein determination). Additionally, the type and degree of CSF abnormality seems to be related as much to the location of disease as to the cause or the severity of the lesion; meningeal and paraventricular diseases generally produce greater abnormalities than deep parenchymal diseases. Previous therapy may affect the type, degree, and duration of CSF abnormalities as well. The CSF abnormalities identified upon analysis are also dependent on the CSF collection site with respect to lesion location (Thomson et al., 1990 (Thomson et al., , 1989 . Lastly, the CSF of animals with neurological disease is not always abnormal . Only occasionally does CSF analysis provide a specific diagnosis (Kjeldsberg and Knight, 1993) nfor example, if infectious agents (bacteria or fungi) or neoplastic cells are observed. In most situations, the chief utility of CSF analysis is to assist in the diagnostic process by excluding the likelihood of certain disease processes being present. As is the case with all tests of relatively low specificity, examination of CSF is most useful when the results are correlated with the history, clinical findings, imaging studies, and ancillary laboratory studies. As stated by Fankhauser (1962) , \"It is futile to make a diagnosis based solely on the CSF findings and particularly on single alterations of it. Only the entire picture of all findings linked with the other clinical symptoms is of value in reaching a diagnosis.\"",

Cerebrospinal fluid provides a \"water jacket\" physical support and buoyancy. When suspended in CSF, a 1500-g brain weighs only about 50 g. The CSF is also protective because its volume changes reciprocally with changes in the volume of intracranial contents, particularly blood. Thus, the CSF protects the brain from changes in arterial and central venous pressure associated with posture, respiration, and exertion. Acute or chronic pathological changes in intracranial contents can also be accommodated, to a point, by changes in the CSF volume (Fishman, 1992; Rosenberg, 1990; Milhorat, 1987) . Excretory function is provided by the direct transfer of brain metabolites into the CSF. This capacity is particularly important because the brain lacks a lymphatic system. The lymphatic function of the CSF is also manifested in the removal of large proteins, and even cells such as bacteria or blood cells, by bulk CSF absorption (see Section II.D, CSF Absorption). The \"sink\" action of the CSF arises from the restricted access of watersoluble substances to the CSF and the low concentration of these solutes in the CSF. Therefore, solutes entering the brain, as well as those synthesized by the brain, diffuse freely from the brain interstitial fluid into the CSF. Removal may then occur by bulk CSF absorption or, in some cases, by transport across the choroid plexus into the capillaries (Fishman, 1992; Rosenberg, 1990; Milhorat, 1987; Davson and Segal, 1996) Because CSF bathes and irrigates the brain, including those regions known to participate in endocrine functions, CSF may serve as a vehicle for intracerebral transport of biologically active substances. For example, hormone-releasing factors, formed in the hypo. thalamus and discharged into the CSF of the thirc ventricle, may be carried in the CSF to their effective sites in the median eminence. The CSF may also b( the vehicle for intracerebral transport of opiates anc other neuroactive substances (Fishman, 1992; Mil horat, 1987) .",

These features result in the capillary endothelium being a selective barrier--the bloodbrain barrier--that regulates the entry, and probably the exit, of biologically important substances and aids in the maintenance of a precise, stable environment for the neural tissues (Rosenberg, 1990; Milhorat, 1987; Davson and Segal, 1996) .",

The circumventricular organs, which include the four choroid plexuses, the median eminence, the neural lobe of the hypophysis, and other specialized areas, border the brain ventricles and are involved with specific secretory activities that appear to require a direct contact with plasma. The capillaries within these organs are fenestrated, similar to capillaries in other organs of the body. Overlying each of the organs are specialized epithelial cells joined by intercellular tight junctions at their apical (ventricular) borders. These epithelial cells also are characterized by an abundance of intracellular organelles and lysosomes. These organelles are probably an important aspect of the barrier and secretory functions of these cells (Rosenberg, 1990; Milhorat, 1987) . The choroid plexuses are the major source of CSF. They are formed by evaginations of the ependyma and the pial blood vessels into the ventricles, and they consist of a single row of cuboidal, specialized epithelial cells thrown into villi around a core of blood vessels and connective tissue. The apical (ventricular) surface of the epithelial cells has a brush border of microvilli with occasional cilia. The basal and lateral cell surfaces have numerous infoldings. Overall, the structure of these cells resembles that of other epithelia specialized for fluid transport, such as proximal ren tubular epithelium (Rosenberg, 1990; Milhorat, 198 Davson and Segal, 1996) . Autonomic nerve termina have also been identified in the choroid plexus, b~ their function is unclear (Fishman, 1992; Nilsson al., 1992) .",

Within the choroid plexus, hydrostatic pressur. of the choroidal capillaries initiates the transfer of wa ter and ions to the interstitial fluid and then to th~ choroidal epithelium. Water and ions are then trans ferred into the ventricles by either (1) intracellula: movement across the epithelial membranes or (2) inter cellular movement across the apical tight junction~ between epithelial cells. Both of these processes arc probably dependent upon ion pumps. Secretior of CSF results from the active transport of sodium which is dependent on the membrane-bound, sodium-potassium activated ATPase present at the apical (ventricular) surface of the choroidal epithelium (Rosenberg, 1990 ; Davson and Segal, 1996) . The presence of autonomic nerve terminals in the choroid plexus suggests a neural control of CSF secretion.

The diffusion of brain interstitial fluid across the ependyma or pia mater is the apparent source of this extrachoroidal CSF component. Formation of the interstitial fluid is thought to occur by active transport processes (secretion) at the cerebral capillaries, but an alternative theory proposes passive permeability of the capillary endothelium and active transport by the surrounding astrocytes (Rosenberg, 1990; Milhorat, 1987) . The relative contributions of choroidal and extrachoroidal sources to CSF in normal and pathologic conditions are not certain. Some investigators report the choroid plexus to be the major if not the sole source of CSF, whereas others conclude that at least one-third of newly formed CSF is extrachoroidal (Milhorat, 1987; Davson and Segal, 1996) .",

If intracranial pressure falls below a critical point, bulk absorption decreases, a homeostatic response to stabilize the intracranial pressure and the CSF volume. The primary site of bulk absorption, at least in people, is the arachnoid villi that project into the dural sinuses. Two other routes are through lymphatic channels in the dura and through the perineural sheaths of cranial nerves (particularly the olfactory nerve) and spinal nerves. Perineural absorption may be through arachnoid villi projecting into perineural veins, lymphatics, or connective tissue (Milhorat, 1987; Davson and Segal, 1996) .

The mechanisms appear to vary among species (Bell, 1995) . Absorption is unidirectional from the CSF into the venous blood m the villi act like one-way valves. The basis for the valvelike mechanism appears to be transport by the giant vesicles (see Section II.A.2). Particles ranging in size from colloidal gold (0.2/zm) to erythrocytes (7.5/zm) can be transported across the villi. In disease conditions, accumulations of larger particles (e.g., protein molecules, erythrocytes, leukocytes) within the villi may impair absorption, leading to hydrocephalu, (Fishman, 1992; Milhorat, 1987) . The choroid plexu, also has an absorptive function, acting on specific sub stances in the CSF rather than by bulk fluid absorption A variety of compounds are actively transported frorr the CSF, in a fashion reminiscent of the proximal renal tubule. Solutes may also be cleared from the CSF b) diffusion into adjacent brain cells or capillaries (Fish. man, 1992; Milhorat, 1987) .",

Mos! commonly, the presence of erythrocytes in a CSF sample is iatrogenic, due to inadvertant trauma associated with the needle placement. However, CSF erythrocytes may also originate from pathologic hemorrhage. The normal nucleated-cell counts of CSF in domestic animals are given in Table 27 .4. The most widely accepted reference ranges for the numbers of leukocytes in the CSF of dogs and cats are 0-5 cells //zl (deLahunta, 1983; Oliver and Lorenz, 1993) to 0-8 cells//zl . However, these ranges are a little too broad in our experience and the most comprehensive series in the literature confirm this. Jamison and Lumsden Bailey and Higgins (1985) examined 31 dogs that were clinically and histopathologically normal. For cerebellornedullary CSF, the mean was 1.45 cells//~1, with the 95% confidence intervals being 1.04-1.86 and the observed range being 0-4 cells//~1. Of 31 dogs, 26 had counts between 0 and 2 cells/~1. They also found that lumbar CSF had significantly lower counts with a mean of 0.55 cells //~1, a 95% confidence interval of 0.22-0.88 and an observed range of 0-4 cells//~1, although 30/31 dogs had counts of 0-2 cells//~1. We currently feel that a normal count for cerebellomedullary CSF in dogs is 0-2 cells//~1, with 3 cells//~1 being in the gray zone and 4 cells//~L being abnormal. Rand et al. (1990b) , derived reference limits for cerebellomedullary CSF from 33 cats that were clinically and histopathologically normal. The samples did not have blood contamination. The mean + 1 SD for the white blood cell count was 0.1 + 0.4 with an observed range of 0-2 cells / p~l. Of 33 cats, 30 had counts of 0 cells //~1. Three cells or more per microliter is therefore considered abnormal in cerebellomedullary fluid of cats.",

Normal CSF consists of varying proportions of small lymphocytes and monocytes. The proportions are species and age dependent (Kjeldsberg and Knight, 1993) . In dogs, monocytic type cells predominate (Jamison and Luresden, 1988) , although there is significant individual variation. In cats (Rand et al., 1990b) , monocytoid cells also predominate, with a mean of 87%, whereas small lymphocytes have a mean of 9%. This same trend is observed in horses, with 73.6% monocytes and 26.2% lymphocytes (Furr and Bender, 1994) . However, small lymphocytes predominate in cattle and llamas (Welles et al., 1994) . In the human literature prior to 1975, any neutrophils present at all in the CSF were thought to be indicative of disease (Kjeldsberg and Knight, 1993) . However, with the advent of techniques for concentrating CSF specimens, such as the cytocentrifuge, it became clear that a very small number of neutrophils may be found in normal human CSF (Fishman, 1992; Kjeldsberg and Knight, 1993) . Similar observations have been made in many veterinary spc cies, and rare neutrophils are a common and norm~ finding in the CSF of all domestic species. Eosinophil are not present in normal CSF, although a single ce is occasionally seen on cytocentrifuge slides of fluid with normal total cell counts. Large foamy activate, macrophages or phagocytes are not seen in norm~ CSF (Fishman, 1992; Christopher et al., 1988) and thei presence is nonspecific evidence of an inflammator disorder. Plasma cells are not seen in normal CSF (Fisf man, 1992; Pelc et al., 1981; Kjeldsberg and Knigh 1993) . Their presence is indicative of underlying ir flammatory disease. In people, plasma cells are see particularly in acute viral disease and various chronJ inflammatory conditions, including tuberculous mez ingitis, syphilis, multiple sclerosis, and the Guillain Barr6 syndrome (Pelc et al., 1981; Kjeldsberg an Knight, 1993) .

Cells lining the leptomeninge choroid plexus cells, and ependymal cells can be se~ as single cells, or, more often, as small papillary cluste or sheets. Cytologically, choroid plexus cells and epeJ dymal cells are indistinguishable (Cook and DeNicol 1988; Kjeldsberg and Knight, 1993) . The majority. lining cells seen in normal CSF are thought to be ch. roid plexus cells (Kjeldsberg and Knight, 1993) . Excc lent descriptions and photographs of these cell typ, can be found elsewhere (Rand et al., 1990b; Cook ar DeNicola, 1988; Kjeldsberg and Knight, 1993) . Chol drocytes are occasionally seen in CSF sampled by lur bar puncture, likely due to the spinal needle nickir the intervertebral disc (Bigner and Johnston, 198] Squamous cells can be observed in CSF and may be dl to skin contamination or an underlying pathologic process such as epidermoid cysts (Kornegay and Go gacz, 1982) or metastatic carcinomas. Bone-marro cells (immature hernatopoietic precursors) have be( described in the CSF of people (Kjeldsberg and Knight, 1993) and dogs (Christopher, 1992) . In people, bonemarrow cells in the CSF are usually associated with lumbar puncture, usually in infants or in patients with vertebral bone abnormalities that create difficulties during the sampling process. The cells are present because of sampling from the vertebral body or articular process. Christopher (1992) observed hematopoietic cells in the lumbar CSF of two dogs and speculated that it was due either to marrow penetration or to dural extramedullary hematopoiesis (Christopher, 1992) . Extramedullary hematopoiesis has been observed in the choroid plexus of five dogs that did not have underlying hematologic abnormalities or the presence of extramedullary hematopoiesis elsewhere (Bienzle et al., 1995) . Although the CSF was normal in these dogs and hematopoietic cells were not observed, this site could provide another potential source for the presence of these cells in CSF. Metastatic myeloid leukemia could conceivably produce similar findings, but peripheral blood and marrow examination would clarify the origin of the cells in question. Neurons, astrocytes, glial cells, and neutral tissue have been observed in the CSF of people (Bigner and Johnston, 1981) and also in cerebellomedullary cisternal samples associated with traumatic taps in animals (personal observation).",

Human neonatal CSF is usually xanthochromic, probably because of a greater protein and bilirubin content than adult CSF. Glucose content is also increased, more closely approximating the blood glucose level. Many of these differences, such as protein con tent, are attributed to immaturity of the blood-brair barrier. Immaturity of the blood-brain barrier may bc due to an increased number of fenestrae in the brair capillaries or inadequate closure of their endothelial tight junctions. Other factors that may contribute tc age differences in CSF composition are the integrity o~ the blood-CSF barrier, the rate of CSF secretion anc efficiency of absorption, the volume of the extracellula~ space of the brain, and the lipid solubility of the sub. stances (Fishman, 1992; Davson and Segal, 1996) .

These enzymes have three possible sources: (1) blood, (2) neural tissue or neural tumors, or (3) cells within the CSF (Fishman, 1992; Kjeldsberg and Knight, 1993) . In probably every instance, the blood enzyme levels are higher than the CSF levels. Unfortunately, many studies of CSF levels in disease fail to report the concurrent blood level and a measure of blood-brain/CSF barrier integrity. However, studies of CSF creatine kinase (CK) in dogs and horses did not find a relationship between WBC counts, serum CK, or CSF total protein and CSF CK (Furr and Tyler, 1990; Jackson et al., 1996) . Regarding correlation of CSF RBC with CSF CK, one study reported a significant correlation (Indrieri et al., 1980) , whereas another study did not find a statistical association between the two parameters (Jackson et al., 1996) . To date, none of the enzyme assays has been shown to be sufficiently sensitive or specific to warrant its routine use in clinical practice (Rand et al., 1994b; Fishman, 1992; Kjeldsberg and Knight, 1993; Jackson et al., 1996; Indrieri et al., 1980) .",

However, 4 of the 10 dogs in this study had CSF total WBC counts >3 //M, and none of the dogs were necropsied to verify their health. Therefore, some of these dogs may have had subclinical neurologic disease, disguising a small cellular gradient. The small number of WBCs in normal fluid may make a cellular gradient more of a theoretical issue than a practical issue, however. If a cellular gradient exists, it may be due to fewer cells entering the lumbar CSF than the cerebellomedullary CSF, a greater rate of cell lysis in the lumbar CSF, a greater migration rate of WBCs from lumbar CSF back into the blood, or loss of WBCs that entered the CSF rostrally and lysed as CSF circulated to the caudal subarachnoid space.",

Considerations that apply regardless of specie, are sterility, use of a spinal needle, and collection frorr animals with increased intracranial pressure. In ordeJ to prevent iatrogenic central nervous system infection sterility during the collection procedure is vital. A gen erous area around the puncture site should be clippe( and surgically prepared. Preparation of too small a1 area can lead to contamination if any difficulty in pal pating landmarks or entering the subarachnoid sit, is encountered. Additionally, the use of a fenestrate~ drape is highly recommended. Spinal puncture is con traindicated in an area of severe pyoderma/furunculc sis, cellulitis, or epidural abscess. A needle with a style (spinal needle) should be used to prevent implantatiol of a plug of epidermis in the subarachnoid spac( which not only could lead to infection but could als, seed an epidermoid tumor. Replacement of the stylc upon withdrawal is controversial, either preventing c causing entrapment and severance or dislocation c nerve root filaments (Fishman, 1992) . Aspiration c CSF from animals with increased intracranial pressur may result in brain herniation. Appropriate anestheti agents, hyperventilation, and mannitol may decreas the probability of herniation. Use of the smallest gaug needle possible may also help prevent herniation b decreasing CSF leakage through the puncture hole i the meninges. Only the minimal amount of CSF nece~ sary to perform the desired tests should be withdrawJ Brain herniation can occur following lumbar taps well as cerebellomedullary cistern taps.",

Because of diffe ences in anatomy, the type or breed influences tt exact site for lumbar puncture in the dog; L3-4 or L4is recommended for large-breed, nonchondrodystr phic dogs (e.g., German shepherd dogs), whereas L4or L5-6 is recommended for small, chondrodystropl~ dogs (e.g., dachshunds) (Morgan et al., 1987) . The pun ture site chosen should be as close to the lesion possible without penetrating the lesion, or the si should be caudal to the lesion. In animals with spin disease, cerebellomedullary fluid is abnormal more h quently with cervical disease than it is with thorac lumbar disease, but overall lumbar fluid is abnormal more often than cerebellomedullary fluid. With intracranial disease, CSF from both sites is usually abnormal, perhaps because both sites are caudal to the lesion (Thomson et al., 1990; Scott, 1992; Thomson et al., 1989) . Occasionally, CSF is collected from both sites. Although the order of collection, cerebellomedullary or lumbar CSF collected first, appears not to influence the analytical results significantly (Bailey and Higgins, 1985) , aspiration from the relatively small lumbar subarachnoid space is easier if the CSF pressure has not just been lowered by cerebellomedullary CSF collection. Cerebellomedullary puncture should be done under general anesthesia. In most instances, lumbar puncture can be done with sedation and local anesthesia. Therefore, if general anesthesia is contraindicated, a lumbar puncture should be done.",

These structures are the vertebral arch of C1 and the external occipital protuberance. After anesthetic induction and intubation, the animal is placed in lateral recumbancy and padding is placed under the neck to align the dorsal cervical and cranial midline parallel to the tabletop. The assistant is instructed to \"tuck in the animal's chin\" and push the external occipital protuberance toward the operator. This procedure flexes the atlanto-occipital joint and maximizes the space between the occipital bone and C1. Asking the assistant to simply flex the neck seems to produce flexion of the midcervical area more than the atlanto-occipital area. The external occipital protuberance, the C2 spinous process, and the C1 vertebral arch are palpated. The last structure is located by rolling a fingertip off the cranial edge of the C2 spinous process and palpating firmly, feeling for a transverse bony ridge (the C1 vertebral arch). The C1 vertebral arch can usually be palpated, and if so,. the puncture is made on the midline just in front of the fingertip palpating the vertebral arch. If C1 is not palpable, the distance between the cranial edge of the C2 spinous process and the occipital protuberance is noted, and the puncture is made on the midline about one-third of that distance cranial to the cranial edge of the C2 spinous process. In rare cases, neither C1 nor C2 can be palpated. In this situation, the lateral edge of each C1 transverse process is palpated and a triangle from each edge to the occipital protuberance is constructed visually. The puncture is made on the midline in the center of that triangle.",

In practical terms, this is of little conse quence in those specimens that are rapidly processed but becomes more significant as the delay betweer collection and processing increases. A complete cyto logic examination includes both a total cell count anc a differential, as well as thorough morphologic assess ment. A differential and thorough morphologic assess ment should be performed routinely, even on thos~ samples that have cell counts within normal limits. Ii our experience, very low cell counts alone cannot b{ used as an indicator of normality. In one study tha utilized cytocentrifugation, nearly 25% of canine CS] samples with cell counts in the normal range had ab normalities in cell type or morphology (Christophe et al., 1988) . Abnormalities included the presence o phagocytic macrophages, increased percentage of neu trophils in the differential, and the presence of reactiw lymphocytes and plasma cells. Malignant cells hav, been observed in samples with normal counts (Bichse et al., 1984b; Grevel and Machus, 1990) . This certainl~ emphasizes the importance of cytologic assessmen! especially in specimens with normal cell counts, h general terms, CSF samples should be processed a soon as possible after collection, as cells degenerat, relatively quickly in CSF (Chrisman, 1992; Fishma~ 1992; Steele et al., 1986; Kjeldsberg and Knight, 1993 ', This is because of the marginal hypotonicity of th, fluid and very low protein content (in nonpathologi specimens). Proteins and lipids tend to have . membrane-stabilizing effect (Steele et al., 1986) . A multitude of veterinary references state that processing must be performed within 30 minutes of collection (Thomson et al., 1990; Oliver and Lorenz, 1993; Cook and DeNicola, 1988; Chrisman, 1983) and this necessitates analysis in the individual veterinary hospital or practice setting. However, there is a complete lack of controlled veterinary studies to confirm this assertion, although, as stated previously, the sooner the better, in general terms. There have been several human studies performed. Steele found that there were significant differences in rates of lysis that were dependent on cell type. At room temperature, neutrophil counts decreased most rapidly and were significantly reduced at 1 hour and 2 hours, 68 + 10% (SEM) and 50 + 12% of original values, respectively. Values were not significantly reduced at half an hour. Lymphocyte and monocyte numbers were not significantly altered until 3 hours (69 + 7% and 66 + 7%, respectively ). However, refrigeration at 4~ markedly reduces the rate of lysis, with only 15% decrease in the total white blood cell numbers at 2 hours (Kjeldsberg and Knight, 1993 ). Another study (Stokes et al., 1975) reported the following rates of disappearance for white blood cells at room temperature: 4 hours--10% lysis, 18 hours--70% lysis, 36 hours--100%. Because there is differential sensitivity of cell types, both cell counts and the differential are altered with time. The authors have observed this phenomenon. When differential counts are compared between slides made immediately and those made via cytocentrifugation 3-6 hours later, there is a marked decrease in the percentage of neutrophils (personal observation). This would tend to confirm the preceding data. Therefore, the recommendation that analysis be performed within 30 minutes is reasonable, but it is predicated on the conditions that the sample is exposed to. Refrigeration obviously slows lysis, likely long enough for transport to reference laboratories in some instances. Addition of protein to the sample helps preserve cells and also expedites transport of samples to more remote facilities. There was excellent correlation between the total numbers of cells on the slides and the differential between sediment slides processed immediately and those preserved with fetal bovine serum (200 ~1 of CSF and 200/~1 of fetal bovine serum) and cytocentrifuged 2-4 hours later (Rand et al., 1990b) . We have observed excellent morphology on slides made from CSF as long as 12 hours postcollection, when the sample was immediately mixed with approximately 20% by volume of autologous, wellcentrifuged serum and transported on an ice pack. However, the effects on cell count and differential are unknown under these conditions. This is perhaps an option for practitioners in remote locations without the capability or expertise to process CSF. The duration c cell preservation under different conditions requirc further study.",

There is contrl versy as to which method is optimal, and all have the strengths and weaknesses. Methods include simp centrifugation, sedimentation and variations therec membrane filtration, and cytocentrifugation (Jamisc and Lumsden, 1988) . The reader is referred to the~ references for specific methodological details. In tf great majority of cases, simple centrifugation produces slides that are completely unsatisfactory for cytologic examination. Membrane filtration techniques have the chief advantage of excellent cellular recovery with yields approaching 90-100% ( Barrett and King, 1976) . However, the methodology is laborious and time consuming, the morphology relatively poor, many cells are partly hidden in the filter substance, which itself stains variably, and the technique requires specialized, nonroutine staining techniques that the great majority of veterinary cytologists have no experience or expertise in interpreting. For these reasons, they are not recommended. Cytocentrifugation (Hansen et al., 1974; Woodruff, 1973) has become the method of choice in both human (Fishman, 1992; Kjeldsberg and Knight, 1993) and veterinary medicine (Christopher et al., 1988; Jamison and Lumsden, 1988) . The technique is rapid and simple and provides slides with good cytologic detail. The technique is enhanced by the addition of protein to the CSF sample prior to centrifugation. This helps preserve cell morphology. Conditions of cytocentrifugation vary from laboratory to laboratory. We personally prefer the method described by Rand (Rand et al., 1990b) . The disadvantages of cytocentrifugation include the expense of the instrument and the relatively low cell yield. In one comparative study (Barrett and King, 1976) , the following cell yields were determined: Millipore filtration 81 + 3 % (SEM), Nucleopore filtration 69 + 3%, and cytocentrifugation 11 + 1%. The Sornas method of centrifugation results in a cell yield, after staining, of approximately 20% (S6rn~is, 1967) . The sedimentation technique of Sayk, modified by K61mel (Grevel, 1991; Grevel and Machus, 1990; K61mel, 1977) results in a yield of approximately 30% (KOlmel, 1977) , although this can be increased to almost 90% if a membrane filter is substituted for direct sedimentation onto a slide. We have some experience with the KOlmel apparatus and technique and have found the cell morphology to be at least as good as that in cytocentrifugation, with an apparently superior cell yield, although this would need to be confirmed with controlled comparative studies. Therefore, most studies would suggest that sedimentation techniques result in greater cell yields than cytocentrifugation, although there is a least one study that found the yield of cytocentrifugation to be marginally higher than that of sedimentation (Ducos et al., 1979) . Standard Romanowsky stains are recommended for staining of slides. They provide good cellular detail on air-dried CSF preparations and are familiar to most observers. These stains include the Wright's and Wright-Giemsa staining methods, as well as a variety of rapid staining methods including Diff-quik and Camco-quik (Jamison and Lumsden, 1988) .",

In people, the value of cytologic diagnosis of CSF can be improved if morphologic studies are appropriately supplemented by immunocytochemistry (Kjeldsberg and Knight, 1993) . Immunophenotypic studies of cytocentrifuge slides are useful in the differential diagnosis of leukemia, maligant lymphoma, primary brain tumors, and metastatic tumors (Bigner and Johnston, 1981; Bigner, 1992; Kjeldsberg and Knight, 1993) . Panels of monoclonal antibodies are often used, with the greatest limitation being the volume and the cellularity of the specimen that is available for the marker studies. Undifferentiated tumor panels frequently include leukocyte common antigen and cytokeratin antibodies. These can be very helpful in distinguishing single carcinoma cells from lymphocytes or monocytes (Bigner and Johnston, 1981; Bigner, 1992; Kjeldsberg and Knight, 1993) . Glial fibrillary acidic protein has proven to be helpful in distinguishing a glial origin, but there are currently no specific markers to distinguish primary brain tumors. Immunocytochemistry can be used also to characterize the lymphocyte subpopulations present in CSF. Of the lymphocytes found in normal human CSF, 75-95% are T cells, with a mean of approximately 85% (Kjeldsberg and Knight, 1993) . Within the population of T cells, T helper cells predominate and account for up to 88% of T cells. Alterations of these percentages have been shown to have significant associations with disease in people (Kjeldsberg and Knight, 1993) . Similar studies are lacking in domestic animals but would potentially be quite useful. In people, most cental nervous system lymphomas are B cell in origin, and immunocytochemistry can be used to document monoclonality (Bigner and Johnston, 1981; Bigner, 1992) . This is strong evidence (but not definitive proof) of malignancy. The Bcell origin can also be confirmed. For patients with Tcell lymphomas, marker studies can be more difficult to interpret as T cells predominate in normal and inflammatory CSF (Kjeldsberg and Knight, 1993) . If there is systemic involvement, then comparison with the peripheral phenotype is useful to confirm presence in the CSF. Immunocytochemistry has also been utilized to detect infectious agents such as cytomegalovirus in human patients (Kjeldsberg and Knight, 1993) .",

            "text": "Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technology represents a powerful adjunct to routine cytologic assessment and has the potential to revolutionize CSF analysis by dramatically increasing both the sensitivity and specificity of diagnosis. Because PCR exponentially increases in vitro the number of original DNA copies to a final number dependent on the number of cycles programmed, it is uniquely suited to the low volumes and small cell numbers frequently found in CSF samples. In people, one of the most powerful and useful applications of PCR methodology has been its use to confirm malignancy and detect minimal residual disease in lymphomatous meningitis (Rhodes et al., 1996) . This is accomplished via detection of clonal immunoglobulin or T-cell receptor gene rearrangements and the detection of clone-specific rearrangements, respectively. However, the exquisite sensitivity may result in false positive results due either to contamination or to very low initial numbers of cells producing an artifactual clonal band. Other applications include detection of a wide variety of infectious agents, including toxoplasma, borrelia, TB, and herpes simplex (Christen et al., 1995; Lin et al., 1995; Novati et al., 1994; Guffond et al., 1994) . In the great majority of these studies, PCR has resulted in a more rapid diagnosis with superior sensitivity and specificity when compared to those of standard culture and serologic diagnostic techniques. In veterinary medicine, PCR has been used to detect several infectious agents in CSF samples, including sarcocystis neurona, toxoplasma, and listeria (Fenger, 1994; Peters et al., 1995; Stiles et al., 1996) . The same advantages appear to apply in these instances, although some agents such as listeria may not gain access to the meningoventricular system, resulting in negative results when applied to CSF of confirmed positive cases (Peters et al., 1995) . Further developmental work in conjunction with prospective studies will be required before the true utility of PCR-based CSF diagnostics can be accurately assessed in domestic animals.",

Varied opinions exist regarding the best way to calculate the contribution of IgG from each source (Trotter and Rust, 1989; Thompson, 1988) . To determine the probable origin of CSF IgG, it can be related mathematically to a protein of purely extrathecal origin. Because albumin is synthesized entirely extrathecally, it is the preferred comparison protein and is the most widely used (Fishman, 1992) . Transferrin and alpha2 macroglobulin have also been recommended because of their extrathecal origin (Schliep and Felgenhauer, 1974) .",

Because albumin is synthesized only extrathecally, the albumin index assesses the amount of albumin crossing the bloodbrain/CSF barriers, and therefore is a measure of barrier integrity. Blood contamination of the CSF with as little as 0.2% serum (equivalent to about 5000-10000 RBC//A) by a traumatic puncture falsely elevates the IgG index in people (Peter and Tourtellotte, 1986) . Also, the IgG index loses reliability when CSF protein levels are less than 25 mg/dl or greater than 150 mg/dl (Boerman et al., 1991) . An additional problem with the IgG index is its basic premise that the selectivity of the protein transfer at the blood-CSF barrier is independent of the actual permeability condition. This concept has been shown to be incorrect, and the IgG index, as well as the IgA and IgM indices, vary in a nonlinear fashion with progressive impairment of the barrier (Reiber and Felgenhauer, 1987) .

Antibody indices have been calculated in human patients with a variety of diseases (Reiber and Lange, 1991) . The diagnostic reliability of these indices and application to clinical veterinary medicine needs further study. Antigen detection tests include immunoelectrophoretic techniques, agglutination tests, and ELISA for bacterial antigens and latex agglutination for cryptococcal antigens. The recently developed PCR procedures detect specific antigen DNA in CSF and are highly sensitive, specific, and rapid (see Section V.C.5). The ELISA and PCR procedures have much promise for the diagnosis of neural infections (Kjeldsberg and Knight, 1993) .",

Blood contamination due to traumatic puncture is a common problem during CSF collection and, depending on its degree, can interfere with cytologic interpretation. Blood contamination is more likely to occur with lumbar puncture as opposed to cerebellomedullary cisternal puncture (Thomson et al., 1990; Bailey and Higgins, 1985; Oliver and Lorenz, 1993) . Blood contamination is a source of leukocytes and hence can affect both the count and the differential. In one study of CSF in cats (Rand et al., 1990b) , the total leukocyte count, the neutrophil percentage, and the eosinophil percentage were positively correlated with the CSF erythrocyte count once this count exceeded 500 erythrocytes per microliter. However, there was no significant increase in total white blood cell count or alteration in the differential percentages with up to 500 RBC / ~l of CSF. Numerous correction factors have been used to correct leukocyte counts for the effect of blood contamination and include the following: In people, 1 white blood cell per 700 red blood cells is subtracted from the total whi! blood cell count (Fishman, 1992) ; in dogs, I white bloo cell per 500 red blood cells is subtracted from the tot~ count (Bailey and Higgins, 1985) , and in cats, a max mum of 1 white blood cell per 100 red blood cells J subtracted (Rand et al., 1990b) . A more accurate fo: mula takes into account the actual white blood ce and red blood cells counts of the patient and henc compensates for any significant alterations in the~, counts (Fishman, 1992) ,",

Despite all of these elabora corrections, our own experience is that many tho~ sands of red blood cells in contaminated samples q CSF will frequently be observed without any accomp; nying white blood cells, suggesting that these corre tion factors may not be valid. This empirical obserw tion has been made by others (deLahunta, 1983) . Th lack of validity has been proven by several studi~ (Wilson and Stevens, 1977; Novak, 1984) . Wilson ar Stevens (1977) concluded that blood contamination a 1 peared to have little effect on white blood cell numbe and that the preceding correction formula was unreli ble. They found 91 samples from both normal ar diseased animals where there were numerous rc blood cells but no white blood cells. Some of the rc blood cell counts exceeded 15,000 RBC/~1, but whi blood cells were still absent. Novak (1984) concludc that the standard computations frequently overcorre white blood cell counts in blood-contaminated CS and the magnitude of the overcorrection may obscu disease in some instances--in eight infants with si nificant blood contamination but proven bacteri meningitis, correction computations normalized . overcorrected the white blood cell counts. The mech nism of this overcorrection could not be defined, b it is clear that that the presence of low numbers neutrophils should not be immediately discountc when red cells are concurrently found (Christopher al., 1988) . A study of feline CSF (Rand et al., 1990a) also four that values for CSF total protein, lactate dehydrog nase, creatine kinase, IgG ratio, and ~,-globulin percer age were affected by blood contamination. The C~ total protein value of blood-contaminated CSF m~ be corrected using the formula for white blood cc correction given earlier but substituting the total protein levels of the bloody CSF and the serum for the corresponding white blood cell counts (Kjeldsberg and Knight, 1993) . In people, bloody contamination of CSF with as little as 0.2% serum (equivalent to about 5000-10000 RBC / ml) elevates the IgG index (Fishman, 1992) .",

These colors correspond to the major pigments derived from red cells: oxyhemoglobin, bilirubin, and methemoglobin. Oxyhemoglobin is red in color, but after dilution in the CSF it appears pink or orange. Oxyhemoglobin is released from lysed red cells and may be detected in the CSF supernatant about 2 hours after red cells enter the CSF. The level of oxyhemoglobin reaches its peak about 36 hours later and disappears over the next 4-10 days. Bilirubin is yellow in color. Bilirubin is the derivative of hemoglobin and is considered to formed by macrophages and other leptomeningeal cells that degrade the hemoglobin from lysed red cells. Bilirubin is detected about 10 hours after red cells enter the CSF, reaches a maximum at about 48 hours, and may persist for 2 to 4 weeks. Bilirubin is also the major pigment responsible for the abnormal color of CSF with a high protein content. Methemoglobin in CSF is dark yellowbrown.

In general terms, the degree of pleocytosis is dependent upon several factors, including the nature of the inciting cause and the severity and location of the lesion with respect to the subarachnoid space or ventricular system (Cook and DeNicola, 1988) . It should also be emphasized that normal CSF analysis does not exclude the presence of disease (Fishman, 1992; Kjeldsberg and Knight, 1993) . This is especially true with deep parenchymal lesions that do not communicate with the leptomeninges, and hence the subarachnoid space or the ependymal surfaces. In these cases, despite the presence of neurologic disease that is often severe, the lesion may not affect the CSF cellularity (Cook and DeNicola, 1988) . Abnormal CSF findings always indicate the presence of pathologic abnormality.",

Total leukocyte counts in excess of 2000 cells per microliter are frequently encountered in these diseases and may even exceed 10,000 cells per microliter (Meric, 1992a) . Observation of bacteria or a positive culture confirms septic meningitis. In our experience, bacteria are more commonly observed in the CSF of large animals afflicted with septic meningitis than in dogs or cats with septic meningitis. Neutrophil nuclear morphology is often used as a criterion for determining the likelihood of sepsis, with nuclear degenerative changes or karyolysis being interpreted as evidence of bacterial disease. However, the neutrophils in confirmed cases of septic meningitis in dogs and cats are frequently well preserved, especially if there has been prior therapy. Therefore, absence of bacteria or degenerative nuclear changes in neutrophils cannot be used to exclude unequivocally a diagnosis of septic meningitis, although it does make it less likely. In people, acute viral meningoencephalitis can initially produce a neutrophilic pleocytosis (Fishman, 1992; Converse et al., 1973; Kjeldsberg and Knight, 1993 ) that may persist from a few hours to several days prior to the development of the more typical mononuclear reaction. A similar phenomenon has been documented in animals . Occasionally, distemper virus infection can cause massive encephalomalacia (Vandevelde and Spano, 1977) , resulting in a neutrophilic pleocytosis in contrast to the moderate mononuclear pleocytosis that is more typical. Central nervous system neoplasia may result in a neutrophil predominance in the CSF, especially if there is significant necrosis and inflammation associated with the tumor. Moderate to marked pleocytosis with neutrophil predominance is a common finding in canine meningioma (Bailey and Higgins, 1986b) . Canine intervertebral disc disease is predominantly characterized by a mild mononuclear pleocytosis (Thomson et al., 1989) . However, acute severe disease may result in counts greater than 50 cells per microliter with more than 50% neutrophils (Thomson et al., 1989) . This finding is a reflection of acute inflammation that may be exacerbated by myelomalacia in some instances. The authors have seen a similar phenomenon associated with fibrocartilaginous thromboembolism in dogs. A neutrophilic pleocytosis of varying severity often occurs following myelography with iodinated contrast agents (Widmer et al., 1992; Johnson et al., 1985; Carakostas et al., 1983) . These changes usually peak at 24 hours post myelogram (see Section VII for further details). Similarly, a neutrophilic pleocytosis has been observed postictally in people. We have occasionally observed similar findings in dogs (see Section VII).",

Additionally, CSF eosir ophilia and peripheral blood eosinophilia do not nece~ sarily occur together, and if they do, no positive corrc lation exists between the magnitude of peripher~ blood eosinophilia and the severity of the CSF eosinc philia (Smith-Maxie et al., 1989; Bosch and OehmicheI 1978) . In one case series of eight dogs with eosinophili meningoencephalitis, five of eight had concurrent p( ripheral eosinophilia, but no correlation was preseI between the peripheral and CSF eosinophil counts. TI~ two dogs with the highest CSF eosinophil counts ha peripheral eosinophil counts within normal referen( limits. In people, central nervous system invasion b parasites, especially Angiostrongylus cantonensis, is tk most frequent cause of eosinophilic pleocytosis, an in many of these cases eosinophils predominate in tt differential cell count (Bosch and Oehmichen, 197 Kuberski, 1979) . CSF eosinophilia can also occur i association with bacterial, fungal, and viral infectiol and hence can be seen concurrently with suppurativ granulomatous, and lymphocytic inflammatory pr, cesses of the central nervous system (Smith-Maxie al., 1989; Jamison and Lumsden, 1988) . However, many of these cases, eosinophils represent less th~ 5% of the total cell count in CSF (Smith-Maxie et a 1989; Bosch and Oehmichen, 1978) . Other document( causes in people include neurosyphilis, tuberculosis, rickettsial disease, foreign-body reactions to shunt tubes, intrathecal penicillin or contrast agents, hypereosinophilic syndrome, multiple sclerosis, lymphoma, Hodgkin's disease, leukemia, melanoma, disseminated glioblastoma, idiopathic disorders, and systemic allergic reactions (Fishman, 1992; Smith-Maxie et al., 1989; Kuberski, 1979; Kjeldsberg and Knight, 1993) .

Very few veterinary studies have investigated the incidence of positive CSF cytology in confirmed cases of central nervous system neoplasia. In one study involving 77 histopathologically confirmed cases of primary central nervous system neoplasia in dogs, neoplastic cells were not observed in a single case (Bailey and Higgins, 1986b) . However, in this study, cytologic assessment was performed only on those cases with an elevated cell count and these only accounted for 41.3% of cases. As stated previously, cases have been reported in the veterinary literature in which tumor cells were observed in the CSF but the CSF cell counts were within normal limits (Grevel et at., 1992; Bichsel et al., 1984b; Grevel and Machus, 1990) . Additionally, in the study assessing primary brain tumors in 77 dogs (Bailey and Higgins, 1986b) , CSF differentials and cytology were performed on cytospin slides. The cell yield with cytospin smears is very low, approximating 10% ( Barrett and King, 1976) in some studies, and this may partly explain the failure to observe neoplastic cells in this study. Other veterinary studies utilizing different techniques report a higher incidence of neoplastic cell observation in the CSF from confirmed cases of central nervous system neoplasia In two studies utilizing a KSlmel sedimentation appa ratus, tumor cells were seen in the CSF of five of eigh cases (Grevel and Machus, 1990 ) and four of nine case (Grevel et al., 1992) . In the former study, two of th, five cytologically positive cases had normal cell counts In another study utilizing a membrane filter techniqu~ (Bichsel et al., 1984b) , three of nine cases of dogs wit] central nervous system neoplasia had CSF samples ii which neoplastic cells were observed. Both of the tech niques utilized in these studies result in a higher cel yield than cytocentrifugation, which may be partly re sponsible for the increased incidence of neoplastic cel observation in the CSF in these studies.",

Overall sensitivities that arq frequently quoted are 70% for central nervous systerI leukemia, 20-60% for metastatic meningeal carcinoma and approximately 30% for primary central nervou~ system tumors (Kjeldsberg and Knight, 1993) , regard less of the technique utilized. The detection rate o malignant cells in the CSF is significantly improvec by the collection of multiple samples These figures are supported by one study utilizin~ cytocentrifugation in 117 cases of histopathologicall 3 confirmed central nervous system neoplasia (Glass e al., 1979) . Overall, 26% (31/117) were positive. How ever, if only those cases with leptomeningeal involve ment were considered, the incidence increased to 59% Conversely, of 66 cases in which the tumor did no reach the leptomeninges, only a single case was posi tive. In another study, only 13.9% of all gliomas hac a positive CSF cytology (Balhuizen et al., 1978) . Thi~ low incidence is likely due to the fact that the grea majority of gliomas do not extend into the subarach noid space (Balhuizen et al., 1978) . As a result of these studies, the following generalizations are frequentl 3 made in human medicine: (1) A positive CSF cytolog 3 is a reliable indicator of central nervous system malig nancy and almost always reflects a leptomeningea tumor (or one involving the ventricular system), anc (2) a negative cytology does not exclude the presence of an intracerebral tumor, particularly a deep paren. chymal mass that does not breach the pia or the ventric ular system. Controlled studies are required in veteri nary medicine to determine the incidence of positive CSF cytology in confirmed cases of the different type 91 of central nervous system neoplasia and also to com pare the sensitivities of different preparative methods These studies may be hampered by the general lac~ of experience at identifying cells derived from central nervous system neoplasms. Tumor cells can be erro neously identified as normal ependymal or choroic plexus cells. Solitary tumor cells from metastatic carcinomas can be mistaken for lymphocytes or monocytes (Kjeldsberg and Knight, 1993) . The need for the preceding types of studies has been somewhat decreased by the advent of routine access to advanced imaging techniques.",

However, this alteration accompanies many diseases and is therefore nonspecific. Increased total protein may be caused by (1) increased permeability of the blood-brain/spinal cord/CSF barriers allowing passage of serum proteins into the CSF, (2) intrathecal globulin production, and (3) interruption of CSF flow and/or absorption. Particular emphasis has been put on CSF flow rate as a major factor in CSF protein content (Reiber, 1994) . In many diseases, two or all three of these mechanisms are at work. In complete spinal subarachnoid space blockage (e.g., by a compressive lesion or arachnoiditis), CSF withdrawn caudal to the block may clot when aspirated. This phenomenon is called Froin's syndrome and results from very high CSF protein levels caused by the defective flow and absorption and blood-spinal cord barrier breakdown (Fishman, 1992; Kjeldsberg and Knight, 1993) .",

No evidence exists to support the first mechanism. Increased removal can occur, however, if intracranial pressure is increased while the barriers to serum protein remain normal. In this situation, bulk flow absorption of CSF is increased, while entrance of protein into the CSF remains normal. Protein content of fluid collected from the lumbosacral site could be decreased if large volumes are removed, or if ongoing leakage of CSF from the lumbar area is occurring. In these situations, lumbosacral CSF is replaced more quickly than normal by ventricular CSF, which has a lower protein content than lumbosacral CSF (Fishman, 1992; Kjeldsberg and Knight, 1993) . Low CSF protein has also occurred in people with hyperthyroidism, leukemia, or water intoxication (Fishman, 1992; Kjeldsberg and Knight, 1993) .",

These bands, readily identifiable against the low background of normal polyclonal IgG in the CSF, are thought to represent the products of a limited number of plasma-cell clones. Oligoclonal bands unique to CSF (i.e., not present in serum) indicate intrathecal synthesis of immunoglobulin and may be more sensitive than the IgG index in detecting this synthesis. People with multiple sclerosis may have a normal IgG index yet have CSF oligoclonal banding; thus, the demonstration of these bands is considered by some to be the single most useful test in the diagnosis of multiple sclerosis (Kjeldsberg and Knight, 1993) .

Decreased CSF glucose occurs with several disorders of the nervous system, particularly acute, bacterial, fungal, amebic, or tuberculous meningitis. In people, low CSF glucose is also characteristic of diffuse carcinomatous meningitis, meningeal cysticercosis or trichinosis, and syphilitic meningitis. The major factors responsible for low CSF glucose levels are inhibition of the entry of glucose due to alteration of membrane glucose transport and increased anaerobic glycolysis by neural tissue. As noted earlier, hyperglycemia elevates the CSF glucose, which may mask a decreased CSF level. Therefore, calculation of a CSF/serum glucose ratio has been recommended to identify pathologically low CSF glucose level (Kjeldsberg and Knight, 1993) . A low CSF glucose level in the absence of hypoglycemia indicates a diffuse, meningeal disorder, rather than focal disease (Fishman, 1992) . Decreased CSF glucose classically has been associated with bacterial meningitis, but many human patients with bacterial meningitis have normal CSF glucose levels. Therefore, the recommendation has been made that CSF glucose need be measured only if the opening CSF pressure, cell count, cytospin differential, and protein are inconclusive (Hayward et al., 1987) .",

Jack son et al. (1996) also concluded that contamination o the CSF sample with epidural fat or dura mater ma 3 contribute to previously unexplained elevations in CSI creatine kinase activity.

Increased total protein is also found ir people with motor neuron disease, Parkinson's disease, and various hereditary neuropathies and myelopathies. The mechanism of the protein increase is unknown. Electrophoretic studies of CSF associated wi@ some human neurodegenerative disorders have showr a transudative pattern. Intrathecal immunoglobulir production has also been found in people with motol neuron disease (Fishman, 1992) . In storage disease~ such as globoid-cell leukodystrophy, accumulations oJ metabolic material may be seen in CSF cells (Roszel 1972 ).",

More common is a normal cell count couplec with a mild to moderate elevation of total protein (ap. proximately 40-70 mg/dl). This albuminocytologic dissociation may support the theory that this disorde~ is an immune-mediated disease (Waxman et at., 1980) However, the common existence of concurrent chronic, spinal cord compression by Type II disc pro trusion in these dogs complicates the situation, because chronic cord compression may also produce an increase in total protein. The elevated total protein in canine degenerative myelopathy is probably due to increased CSF albumin (Bichsel et al., 1984b) . The CSF IgG index is usually normal (Tipold et al., 1993b; Bichsel et al., 1984b) , indicating a lack of intrathecal IgG production.",

The total white blood cell count is moderately to markedly elevated, as is the total protein. The white blood cell differential is variable, but typically lymphocytes predominate, with monocytes / macrophages and neutrophils making up the remainder in about equal percentages (Bailey and Higgins, 1986a; Braund, 1994; Thomas and Eger, 1989; . A 15-30% neutrophilic component is suggestive of GME, but the white blood cell differential can range from 95% neutrophils (Sorjonen, 1990) to 100% mononuclear cells. Plasma cells, cells undergoing mitosis, and large, mononuclear cells with abundant foamy cytoplasm are occasionally present (Bailey and Hig-gins, 1986a; Braund, 1994) . Lumbar fluid is also abnormal, although it generally has fewer cells and less protein than cerebellomedullary fluid (Bailey and Higgins, 1986a) . Electrophoresis of CSF suggests that bloodbrain barrier dysfunction is present in the acute stage of disease; intrathecal IgG production with resolution of the barrier dysfunction occurs in chronic disease (Sorjonen, 1990) . The albumin quota is elevated (Sorjonen, 1987) , and the IgG index is usually elevated (Tipold et al., , 1993b Bichsel et al., 1984b) . If barrier dysfunction is severe, with marked transudation of protein, the IgG index may be normal because the amount of intrathecally produced IgG is small in comparison to the amount of transudated serum IgG (Fishman, 1992; Bichsel et al., 1984b) .",

These mild changes probably reflect the characteristic lesions of this disease, which are mononuclear vascular cuffing and parenchymal microabscesses. The disease in sheep may produce a CSF similar to that of infected cattle (Scarratt, 1987) . However, two studies reported ovine CSF to have moderate to marked elevations in white blood cell count and protein, with a neutrophilic pleocytosis (53 to 100% neutrophils) (Scott, 1993 (Scott, , 1992 . Perhaps the mononuclear CSF reported in cattle reflects a more chronic stage or resolution of the disease (Green and Smith, 1992; Kjeldsberg and Knight, 1993) . A study of bacterial culture and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for the detection of L. monocytogenes in the CSF of 14 infected ruminants yielded no positive cultures and only one positive PCR. The authors concluded that L. monocytogenes only occasionally gains access to the meningoventricular system in the course of the disease, and that reliable, in vivo diagnosis of listeric encephalitis generally cannot be based on the detection of the organism in the CSF (Peters et al., 1995). b. Neuroborreliosis (Lyme Disease) Although neuroborreliosis caused by the Lyme disease spirochete, Borrelia burgdorferi, has been suspected in dogs (Mandel et al., 1993; Feder et al., 1991) and horses (Hahn et al., 1996; Burgess and Mattison, 1987) , the actual incidence in animals is unknown, largely because of diagnostic difficulties. These difficulties arise from a delay or repression of seroconversion after infection; the high number of seropositive, clinically normal animals; the persistence of infection and seropositivity despite resolution of clinical disease; antibody cross reactivity; and difficulty in culturing the organism from tissue or fluid samples (Appel et al., 1993; Madigan, 1993; Parker and White, 1992; Levy et al., 1993) . The CSF associated with neuroborreliosis in animals has not been characterized. In people, CSF abnormalities are related to the stage of the disease. When present, typical abnormalities are a mononuclear pleocytosis (T lymphocytes, plasma cells, and IgMpositive B cells (Sindern and Malin, 1995) ) with a moderately elevated total protein and normal or decreased CSF glucose (Fishman, 1992) . Persistent CSF oligoclonal bands and intrathecal synthesis of IgG, IgM, and IgA occur (Henriksson et al., 1986) . Diagnosis is enhanced by the determination of intrathecal synthesis of specific B. burgdorferi antibodies (Kaiser and Lucking, 1993) , but cross reactivityis a problem (Fishman, 1992) . Borrelia burgdorferi antibodies have also been detected in the CSF of dogs (Mandel et al., 1993; Feder et al., 1991) . PCR techniques for CSF have been recently developed, but the diagnostic success rate is variable (Lebech, 1994) . The CSF of a horse was reported PCR positive for B. burgdorferi (Hahn et al., 1996) .",

In dogs with neural ehrlichiosis, the CSF resembles that of viral diseases, that is, the white blood cell count and protein may be normal or slightly to moderately elevated with a predominantly mononuclear pleocytosis (Maretzki et al.,1994; Greene et al., 1985; Buoro et al., 1990; Meinkoth et al., 1989; Firneisz et al., 1990) . The albumin quotient is reported to be elevated (Sorjonen et al., 1991) . Occasionally, Ehrlichia morulae may be observed in CSF mononuclear cells or neutrophils (Maretzki et al., 1994) . The few reports of CSF associated with Rocky Mountain spotted fever suggest a difference from ehrlichiosis in that the CSF pleocytosis of Rocky Mountair spotted fever may be predominantly neutrophilic, particularly early in the disease (Breitschwerdt, 1995 Breitschwerdt et al., 1985 Greene et al., 1985; Rutger, et al., 1985) . A predominantly neutrophilic pleocytosi, has also been reported in dogs experimentally infectec with R. rickettsii (Breitschwerdt et al., 1990) .

Th total white blood cell count and total protein are gene: ally mildly to moderately elevated. The white cell pot ulation may be mixed with a majority of mononucle~ cells or may be entirely mononuclear cells. OccasioI ally, neutrophils predominate, particularly in the earl stages of disease or in certain diseases (see later discu sion). The IgG index is commonly elevated (Tipold al., 1993b; Bichsel et al., 1984b) . The IgA and IgM leve may also be elevated. The CSF of viral infections m~ also be normal, particularly if the meninges or epel dyma are not involved (Rand et al., 1994a; Fishman, 1992; Fankhauser, 1962; Tipold, 199~ a. Canine Distemper The CSF abnormalities associated with canine di temper vary strikingly with the stage of the diseas Dogs with acute, demyelinating, noninflammatory di temper encephalitis may have normal or near-norm CSF (mild elevations of total cell count and total pr tein) Johnson et al., 1988) . Protein elev tion is most likely due to blood-brain barrier dysfun tion (Bichsel et al., 1984b) . The IgG index may also l normal or occasionally mildly elevated, which correlates with the histological findings of multifocal demyelination with very little or no infiltration of inflammatory cells (Tipold et al., , 1993b Bichsel et al., 1984b; Vandevelde et al., 1986; Johnson et al., 1988) . The acute form of nervous canine distemper is an exception to the usual association of an elevated IgG index with infectious neurologic diseases because infiltration with inflammatory cells occurs only in the chronic stage of distemper encephalitis (Vandevelde et al., 1986) . The CSF IgM and IgA content is also usually normal Johnson et al., 1988) . The CSF of subacute/chronic, inflammatory distemper usually has a moderately elevated total white blood cell count, primarily mononuclear, and moderately elevated protein (Bichsel et al., 1984b; . The IgG index is typically elevated (Bichsel et al., 1984b; Vandevelde et al., 1986) and IgA levels are commonly increased. Interestingly, IgM levels are increased more often in the chronic stage than in the dogs with acute, noninflammatory distemper (Tipold et al., , 1993b . The IgM and IgA are presumably of intrathecal origin , although blood-brain barrier dysfunction is also present in some dogs and therefore protein could be of serum origin (Sorjonen, 1987; Bichsel et al., 1984b; Sorjonen et al., 1991) . Occasionally the CSF is normal or has only mild changes in cell count or total protein content (Tipold et al., , 1993b Bichsel et al., 1984b; Sorjonen et al., 1991; Vandevelde et al.,1986) . Antimyelin antibody and antiviral antibody have also been identified in the CSF of inflammatory distemper (Vandevelde et al., 1986) . Canine distemper virus antibody is normally absent from CSF; when present it is diagnostic of infection. False-positive results can occur, however, if the CSF is contaminated by serum distemper virus antibody by either iatrogenic or pathologic blood-brain barrier disturbance. The CSF of delayed-onset canine distemper (also known as old-dog encephalitis) has an elevated protein and nonsuppurative, inflammatory cytology. The IgG index is elevated, and much of the CSF IgG is virus specific, suggesting an intrathecal anti-viral immune response. The IgM and IgA concentrations are normal (Johnson et ai.,1988) .",

            "text": "Because rabies is an overwhelmingly fatal, zoonotic disease, there is a paucity of information regarding its CSF abnormalities. In people, the total white blood cell count is normal or has a mild, lymphocytic pleocytosis, and total protein is mildly increased. Occasionally, the pleocytosis is marked (Fishman, 1992) . The CSF of animals with rabies may be normal or abnormal. Typical abnormalities include a mild to moderate mononuclear pleocytosis and mild to moderate elevations in total protein. The white cells may be predominantly lymphocytes, with macrophages, neutrophils, and occasionally plasma cells and eosinophils (Braund, 1994; Green et al., 1992; Hanlon et al., 1989; Coles, 1980; Hamir et al., 1992) . A neutrophilic pleocytosis reported for one horse was thought to reflect an early stage of the disease . Xanthochromia was detected in the CSF of 3 of 5 horses in one study (Green et al., 1992) , perhaps due to antemortem head trauma. The CSF IgM titer increases in 2-3 weeks or more after the onset of clinical rabies (Murphy et al., 1980) . Because of this delay, a negative titer result does not eliminate rabies infection as a possibility (Greene and Dreesen, 1990) . Infective virus may be isolated from the CSF before clinical signs of the disease appear, and neutralizing antibodies in the CSF may not be identified until after clinical signs develop (Fekadu and Shaddock, 1984) . Because of the human health hazard, CSF collection should be avoided if rabies is suspected.",

Dogs with cerebral infarction have similar CSF characteristics (Bichsel et al., 1984b; deLahunta, 1983; Vandevelde and Spano, 1977; Joseph et al., 1988) , although two dogs in one report had a mixed, but predominantly neutrophilic, pleocytosis and normal protein (Vandevelde and Spano, 1977) . The neutrophilic pleocytosis reflected the acute encephalomalacia noted on histopathologic examination (Vandevelde and Spano, 1977) . In one dog of another report, the CSF albumin and IgG index were normal (Bichsel et al., 1984b) . Another dog with a deep, parenchymal, hemorrhagic infarct in the basal nuclear region had normal CSF (Norton, 1992).",

            "text": "Cerebrospinal fluid analysis is not done commonly in animals with metabolic or nutritional neurologk disorders because most of these disorders are diagnosed from historical and physical findings and laboratory tests of blood and urine. When other procedures are nondiagnostic, or when therapy does not eliminate~ or perhaps worsens, the neurologic dysfunction, CSf analysis is indicated to investigate other causes of the neurologic signs. In most cases, routine analysis of CS]~ associated with metabolic or nutritional disorders does not detect abnormalities (Fishman, 1992; Scott, 19951 Bichsel et al., 1984b; Vandevelde and Spano, 1977) . Although brain edema is relatively common with some of these disorders (e.g., hypoxia, hyponatremia, or th~ osmotic dysequilibrium syndromes of hemodialysis oi diabetic ketoacidosis), the edema is usually cytotoxic rather than vasogenic. Therefore, the blood-brain/CS]~ barrier is usually intact and CSF protein is normal. IJ edema is severe enough to result in brain ischemia, infarction, or herniation, the blood-brain/CSF barrieI becomes dysfunctional, vasogenic edema occurs, and CSF protein rises. If neural necrosis ensues, the white blood cell count may also increase. Even in the (apparent) absence of vasogenic edema, blood-brain barriel leakage may occur, perhaps because of the biochemical effects of the disorder on the barrier cells. Animals and people with uremic or hepatic encephalopathies or hypothyroidism may have increased total protein with a normal IgG index (Fishman, 1992; Bichsel et al., 1984b Bichsel et al., , 1988 . People with diabetic neuropathy may alsc have increased CSF protein (Fishman, 1992) . Animals with severe metabolic encephalopathies often have seizures, and the effect of seizures on the CSF must alsc be considered (see Section VII.H.2). Disorders in which neural necrosis is a primary feature, such as the polioencephalomalacia of thiamine deficiency, typically have a pleocytosis and increased total protein (Bichsel et al., 1984b; George, 1996; deLahunta, 1983) . Specific biochemical analysis of CSF may show abnormalities, such as abnormalities in osmolality or electrolyte content with salt or water intoxication (Mayhew, 1989; Kopcha, 1987) , abnormalities in amino acid levels (suclq as glutamine) with hepatic encephalopathy (SchaeffeI et al., 1991; Grabner et al., 1991) , and elevated citrulline in bovine citrullinemia (Healy et al., 1990) .",

Most contrast agents are low-grade leptomeningeal irritants, resulting in leptomeningeal inflammation that is reflected in the CSF. By 90 minutes after myelography, the total white blood cell count and total protein can be elevated and the white blood cell differential count altered. The pleocytosis is typically a mixed mononuclear/neutrophilic response, with the proportion of mononuclear cells to neutrophils varying with the contrast agent used and the time interval after myelography. The pleocytosis may resolve within 10 days (Johnson et al., 1985) , although individual animals may have a slightly increased total white blood cell count up to 14 days following contrast injection (Spencer et al., 1982; Wood et al., 1985) . In contrast, one study of the contrast agents iohexol and iotrolan did not detect any alteration of total white blood cell count in CSF taken between I and 14 days following myelography (van Bree et al., 1991) . The CSF specific gravity and Pandy test score can also be elevated, presumably partly because of the presence of the contrast media (Widmer et al., 1992) . Increased CSF albumin and immunoglobulin levels may be due predominantly to blood-brain/CSF barrier leakage, and may return to normal levels within 5 days (Johnson et al., 1985) . In summary, any alteration of CSF within the first week or two following myelography must be assessed cautiously.",

            "text": "Patients with seizures due to progressive intracranial or some extracranial disorders typically have CSF changes reflecting the disorder. In contrast, the interictal CSF of patients with nonprogressive, intracranial disease should be normal. Postictal CSF is often abnormal, however. Pleocytosis of postictal CSF has been well documented in people (Fishman, 1992; Rider et al., 1995; Barry and Hauser, 1994) . The white blood cell counts may be up to 80//~1 with a neutrophilic component from 5 to 92%. The cell counts are highest at about 24 hours after the seizure. The mechanism of the pleocytosis is obscure (Fishman, 1992) . Convulsive seizures, regardless of cause, may also induce a reversible increase in blood-brain/CSF barrier permeability, resulting in a transient elevation of CSF protein. Brain metabolism is also stimulated during the seizure, resulting in an increase in brain lactate production and a decrease in brain pH (Fishman, 1992) . However, differentiating the effects of the local (brain) phenomena from the effects of systemic phenomena that occur during seizures (hypertension, acidosis, hypoxia, etc.) is difficult. For example, severe, experimental hyperthermia in dogs (core body temperature >41.2~ result., in increased CSF enzymes, calcium, and chloride, probably due to increased blood-brain/CSF barrier permeability (Deswal and Chohan, 1981) . Interpretation oJ postictal CSF must be done cautiously because of th~ potential confusion of a postictal, \"idiopathic epilep. tic\" condition with a progressive disease that alter, the CSF primarily. For children with seizures, the rec. ommendation has been made that CSF with >20 whit~ blood cell/~1 or >10 polymorphonuclear cells/~l no be attributed to the seizures (Rider et al., 1995) .",

The CSF is usually clear and colorless although xanthochromia may be present if hemorrhagq has occurred. The total white blood cell count is oftel normal, but pleocytosis may occur, particularly witl meningiomas and choroid plexus tumors (and occa sionally other tumors) (Bailey and Higgins, 1986b; Car rillo et al., 1986) . Pleocytosis is usually mononucleal although meningiomas may have >50% neutrophil (Bailey and Higgins, 1986b) . Neural lymphosarcom often has a lymphocytic/lymphoblastic pleocytosi (Lane et al., 1994; Williams et al., 1992; Couto et al 1984) , except in cattle, in which the tumor is usuall extradural (Sherman, 1987) . One report indicates th~ pleocytotic CSF is associated with a significanfl shorter survival time than is normal or albuminocytc logic CSF (Heidner et al., 1991) . The commonest CS abnormality is increased total protein, with choroi plexus tumors producing the most marked elevation (Rand et al., 1994b; Bailey and Higgins, 1986b; Moor et al., 1994; Sarfaty et al., 1988; Mayhew, 1989; Brehr et al., 1992; Waters and Hayden, 1990; Roeder et al 1990; Kornegay, 1991) .

The CSF may be normal or have mild to moderate mononuclear pleocytosis and increase in total protein (Mayhew, 1989; Reed et al., 1994) . Xanthochromia is occasionally present, as well as neutrophils and eosinophils (Mayhew, 1989) . The CSF albumin concentration and albumin quotient are reported to be normal and the IgG index elevated, indicating intrathecal IgG production (Andrews and Provenza, 1995) . Antibodies to S. neurona can be identified in the CSF by immunoblot analysis (Granstrom, 1993) . The test is very sensitive and specific for the diagnosis of EPM; however, its accuracy depends on an intact blood-brain/CSF barrier because many horses have serum antibodies to S. neurona but do not have clinical disease (Andrews and Provenza, 1995; Fenger, 1995) . Detection of S. neurona in the CSF by polymerase chain reaction provides definitive evidence of the presence of the parasite in the central nervous system. The results of polymerase chain reaction assay are independent of serum leakage across the blood-brain/CSF barrier (Fenger, 1994).",

Neospora seems to have more of a predilection fo the central nervous system than Toxoplasma, particu larly in young dogs (Dubey et al., 1989 . The CSI associated with neural protozoal infections generall~ has a mild to moderate increase in white blood cel count and total protein. Typically, the white blood cel differential count shows a mixed pleocytosis witf monocytes, lymphocytes, neutrophils, and eosinophih in order of decreasing percentage (Rand et al., 1994a Cuddon et al., 1992 Vandevelde ant Spano, 1977; Kornegay, 1981; Dubey et al., 1990; Averil and deLahunta, 1971; Hass et al., 1989) . Occasionally the white blood cell count and protein are normal (Ti pold, 1995; Parish et al., 1987) . The CSF IgG index wa~, elevated in three of three dogs studied; in two of two dogs, the IgM was normal and the IgA was elevatec (Tipold et al., , 1993b . In a study of experimentall~ infected cats, T. gondii-specific IgG was intrathecall~ produced, but T. gondii-specific IgM was not detected (Munana et al., 1995) . Antiprotozoal antibodies in the CSF may be detected by a variety of methods (Ruehlmann et al., 1995; Cole et al., 1993; Patton et al., 1991) However, the presence of antibodies does not necessarily indicate clinical disease (Munana et at., 1995; Dubey and Lindsay, 1993) . Recently, polymerase chain reaction techniques have been developed to identify the protozoa in tissue and fluids, including CSF (Stiles et al., 1996; Parmley et al., 1992; Novati et al., 1994) . Occasionally the organisms themselves may be seen in CSF cells (Dubey, 1990; McGlennon et al., 1990) .",

The CSF may reflect the physical trauma and consequent inflammatory response, and in some cases an immune reaction to the parasite tissue. The CSF abnormalities are variable and probably depend to some degree on the specific parasite, as well as on its location and the type of incited response. For example, H. boris larvae in the cow normally lodge in the lumbar epidural space and their effect on the spinal cord may be primarily compression. The CSF in such a case could be normal or have only mildly to moderately elevated protein. Parasites that actually invade neural tissue may leave the CSF unchanged or produce CSF with mild to marked pleocytosis and protein elevation, as well as xanthochromia. An eosinophilic pleocytosis is suggestive of parasitism, and typical of some parasites such Parelaphostrongylus (Mason, 1989; George, 1996; Pugh et al., 1995; Baum, 1994) . However, eosinophilic pleocytosis is not pathognomonic for parasitism, nor does a lack of eosinophils in the CSF rule out neural parasitism (Lester, 1992; Braund, 1994; George, 1996; deLahunta, 1983) . The development of an ELISA technique using Parelaphostrongylus-specific immunoglobulin to detect parasite antigen in the CSF might be of diagnostic value (Dew et al., 1992) .",

Mild elevations of the white blood cell count and protein may occur if the toxin causes breakdown of blood-brain / CSF barrier or neural degeneration or necrosis, such as in some cases of lead poisoning (Fankhauser, 1962; Swarup and Maiti, 1991; Dorman et al., 1990; Dow et al., 1989; George, 1996; Mayhew, 1989; Little and Sorensen, 1969) . Lead has been shown to poison capillary endothelial cells selectively (Goldstein et al., 1977) , as well as to cause cerebral cortical necrosis (Christian and Tryphonas, 1970) . If necrosis is severe, the white blood cell count and the total protein can be markedly increased with a predominance of neutrophils, as with leukoencephalomalacia caused by moldy corn poisoning in horses. Xanthochromia is also a characteristic of moldy corn poisoning, reflecting the perivascular hemorrhages in the central nervous system (McCue, 1989; Masri et al., 1987) . With toxicities, biochemical alterations of the CSF may occur more commonly than alterations of CSF cell counts or protein. At the onset of fatal signs of lead poisoning, CSF glucose, urea, creatinine, and creatine kinase levels are increased (Swarup and Maiti, 1991) . Neurostimulatory toxins may result in elevated monoamine metabolites in the CSF (Sisk et al., 1990) . Ivermectin toxicity producing recumbency in dogs elevates the CSF concentrations of homovanillic acid and 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (Vaughn et al., 1989a) . Interestingly, copper poisoning in sheep does not produce significant increases in CSF copper, zinc, or iron levels (Gooneratne and Howell 1979) .",

With acute traum~ the CSF may be pink and hazy or turbid, or actuall bloody. After centrifugation, the supernatant can b clear.

The pleocytosis is usually a mixed ce population, and a substantial proportion of neutrophi] (40-50%) is possible. Total protein may be moderatel to markedly elevated because of disruption of bloo vessels, interruption of CSF flow and absorption, an necrosis (Thomson et al., 1989; .

With spinal cord trauma/compre~ sion, lumbar CSF is more consistently abnormal tha cerebellomedullary CSF (Thomson et al., 1990) .

The white blood cell count may be no: mal or mildly elevated with generally a mixed or m( nonuclear pleocytosis.
