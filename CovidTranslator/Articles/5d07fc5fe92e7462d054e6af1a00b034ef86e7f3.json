The plant essential oil is a mixture of various components from plants. According to the different chemical structures of the essential oil, the composition can be divided into monoterpenes, sesquiterpenes, alcohols, esters, aldehydes and ketones. The constituents are very complex which are involved in the defense of the plant against pests, herbivores, fungi, and bacteria [2, 3] . Essential oils have many applications in indigenous medicines, food flavouring and preservation as well as in drug and cosmetic industries [4] . It also has antibacterial, anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidation, anti-tumor and other functions [5, 6] . Due to thetoxicological effect of the synthetic products, renewed efforts were provided in respect of the use of essential oils as natural antioxidants and preservatives in the food processing, food supplement production andpharmaceutical industry [7] .",

Because of medicinal importance and intricate chemical composition of several species and chemotypes, Artemisia continues to be a subject of wide interest for chemists and taxonomists [8] [9] [10] . It has been reported that most of the phytocompounds of A. asiatica comprise of terpenes and terpene alcohols, 1, 8-cineole, camphor, borneol, bornyl acetate, artemisolide, alkaloids, flavone eupatilin etc [11] [12] [13] [14] .",

DA-9601 also led to the suppression of COX-2 expression and also inhibited nuclear factor (NF)-kappa-B DNA binding in the colonic tissues [16] . The essential oil composition of A. asiatica has already been reported as well as its antibacterial and antifungal activity against a range of microbial strains [12] . However, its mode of action with regard to its antibacterial action has not been studies so far. Therefore, the aim of the study was to investigate the chemical composition and antibacterial activity of the essentialoil on several respiratory infection causing bacteria and tofurther evaluate the antibacterial mechanism against Haemophilus influenzaeby growth curve, the integrity of cellmembrane assays, the SDS-PAGE and SEM examination. Using the above assays, we expect to provide some scientific rationale for developing and utilizing this medical plant.",

Asiatica are presented in Table 2 . The results showed that the essential oil showed some antibacterial effect against all the tested bacteria including both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. In order to determine the antibacterial spectrum of the essential oil, 3 well-known standard drugs viz., Penicillin, chloramphenicol and streptomycin were used as positive controls. The results revealed that essential oil of A. asiatica exhibited a broad spectrum of antibacterial activity against the various microbial strains. The essential oil showed maximum growth inhibition against Haemophilus influenzae with a zone of inhibition of 24.5 mm and MIC/MBC values of 1.9/4.5 mg/mL respectively. However, the essential oil showed lowest growth inhibition against Pseudomonas aeruginosawith a zone of inhibition of 9.2 mm and MIC/MBC values of 5.8/9.4 mg/mL respectively. This is not unexpected because Pseudomonas aeruginosais a Gram negativebacteria which usually are resistant to most of the drugs used. The MIC/MBC values of the essential oil indicated that the antibacterial activity of the oil is somehow comparable to the standard positive controls. MIC was the minimum essential oil concentration that can prevent the bacteria from obvious growth. MBC was the lowest concentration of the essential oil that could kill the inoculum bacteria [21] . Thus from zone of inhibition values and MIC/MBC values, it was shown that Haemophilus influenza was the most affected bacteria, therefore further mechanistic studies were done on this bacterial strain.",

On the contrary the bacteria treated with the essential oil led to a rapid decrease in the number of viable cells. The growth of bacteria was suppressed by the essential oil. In the treatments (1\u00d7MIC) showed a slow decrease in bacterial number over the first 12 h period of the test. Unlike the changing trend of the bacterial number at 1\u00d7MIC, the number of viable cells with the treatment of 2\u00d7MIC reduced significantly in the first three hours after cultivation.

It is also important to mention here that the optical density values also increased with the incubation intervals of 1, 4, 8 and 24 h.

The different kinds of upper respiratory tract infections include the cold, laryngitis, pharyngitis, sinusitis etc [22] . The main contributing factors towards these nasty infections are the infections caused by certain bacteria like Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Bacillus anthracis, Streptococcus pyogenes etc. Some viruses like coronavirus, para influenza virus etc can also cause certain types of upper respiratory tract infections [23, 24] . Many of the bacterial strains have acquired resistance against the commonly used antibiotics resulting in limited efficacy of these drugs. As such there is an urgent need for novel, promising and cheap antimicrobial drugs which do not develop resistance easily against these microbes. Essential oils have wide range of applications in medicine and aromatherapy owing to their multiple chemical constituents in their mixtures giving rise to multifunctionality. Essential oils have been reported to exhibit antibacterial activity against a range of Gram-positive as well as Gram-negative bacterial strains [25] . It has been reported that traditionally essential oils and their constituents have been used for the treatment of various upper respiratory tract infections including colds.

            "text": "In the current study, we evaluated the antibacterial effects of Artemisia asiatica essential oil along with demonstrating its mechanism of action by using different state-of-the-art assays including DNA, RNA and protein leakage assays, dynamic curve assay and scanning electron microscopy assay. The mechanistic studies were performed on Haemophilus influenzae which was shown to be most susceptible to the essential oil treatment. The essential oil showed significant and broad spectrum antibacterial activity against the various microbial strains. The essential oil showed maximum growth inhibition against Haemophilus influenzae with a zone of inhibition of 24.5 mm and MIC/ MBC values of 1.9/4.5 mg/mL respectively. However, the essential oil showed lowest growth inhibition against Pseudomonas aeruginosa with a zone of inhibition of 9.2 mm and MIC/MBC values of 5.8/9.4 mg/mL respectively. Growth curve studies revealed that as compared to the bacteria treated with the essential oil, the control showed a fast increase in bacterial number. On the contrary the bacteria treated with the essential oil led to a rapid decrease in the number of viable cells. Our results are well in agreement with previous which have reported the essential oil of other Artemisia species to exert significant antimicrobial activities [30] . The essential oil components observed in case of other Artemisia were more or less similar as observed in the present study [30] . Furthermore the results showed that on adding the essential oil of A. asiatica to the bacterial culture, the constituents of the bacterial cell got released into the medium and this cell constituent release increased with increasing doses of the essential oil. SEM investigations revealed that the essential oil treatment led to damaged cell wall, deformed cell morphology, shrunken cells and also caused DNA damage. The damage to the bacterial cells seemed to enhance with increasing doses of the essential oil. Our results are information with previous studies wherein essential oils have been reported to inhibit cell wall synthesis via interaction with a number of cellular enzymes [31, 32] . Besides, essential oils have also been reported to induce DNA damage in bacterial cells and hence further confirming our results [33] . Given the promising results of the present study, we believe that further in vivo investigation should be carried out on the essential of A. asiatica to establish it as an important antimicrobial agent.",

The essential oil exhibited significant antibacterial activity against Haemophilus influenzae. Firstly, the essential oil was seen to damage the cell membrane which further led to the leakage of DNA, RNA, and proteins. Further, the SEM experiment was performed to examine the effects of the essential oil of A. asiatica on cell morphology of Haemophilus influenzae. The SEM experiment showed that severe morphological changes appeared in the cell wall and membrane, and the microscopy of treated cells showed many irregularly deformed and shrunken bacteria. ",
