            "text": "Vascular leak is a key driver of organ injury in diseases such as Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome caused by viruses, including COVID-19. Strategies that reduce enhanced permeability and vascular inflammation are promising therapeutic targets. Activation of the Angiopoietin-1 (Angpt1)-Tie2 tyrosine kinase signaling pathway is an important regulator of vascular quiescence. Here we describe the design and construction of a new soluble ANGPT1 mimetic that is a potent activator of endothelial Tie2 in vitro and in vivo. Using a chimeric fusion strategy, we replaced the extracellular matrix (ECM) binding and oligomerization domain of ANGPT1 with a heptameric scaffold derived from the C-terminus of serum complement protein C4-binding protein \u03b1 (C4BP). We refer to this new fusion protein biologic as C4BP-ANG1, which forms a stable heptamer and induces TIE2 phosphorylation in cultured cells, and in the lung following i.v. injection of mice. Injection of C4BP-ANG1 ameliorates VEGF-and lipopolysaccharideinduced vascular leakage, in keeping with the known functions of Angpt1-Tie2 in maintaining quiescent vascular stability, and therefore is a promising candidate treatment for inflammatory endothelial dysfunction.",

            "text": "Since the first clinical use of a VEGF antagonist for cancer and vascular eye disease more than a decade ago(1), there has been rapid development of new drugs targeting the VEGF-VEGFR2 and Angpt-TIE2 pathways (2) . In the Angpt-Tie2 pathway the major ligands are ANGPT1, which is a strong Tie2 agonist, and ANGPT2, which acts as a context-dependent antagonist of Tie2 (3, 4) . One of the key distinctions between these two ligands is that ANGPT1 self-clusters into higher order oligomers, and this is critical to induce Tie2 activation (5, 6) . ANGPT1 is secreted by a variety of perivascular cell types to act on its cognate receptor Tie2 on the cell surface of endothelium, where it regulates junction stability to protect against vascular leakage. Localized or transient increases in blood vessel permeability occur during inflammation, ischemia, and tumor-related neoangiogenesis (7) (8) (9) . Because the reduction of vascular leak has been linked to better patient outcomes in sepsis, ARDS and other conditions, therapeutic targeting of the Angpt-Tie2 pathway has been attempted by many groups (2, (10) (11) (12) (13) (14) (15) .",

These include the recombinant proteins BowAng1 (16) and COMP-ANG1 (17) , where the Tie2-binding fibrinogen-like domain (FLD) of ANGPT1 is fused to either the Fc of IgG1 (BowAng1) or the coiled-coil domain (CCD) of rat cartilage oligomeric matrix protein (COMP), respectively. Small molecules that inhibit the activity of TIE2 phosphatase VE-PTP are able to potently activate Tie2 in a ligand independent manner (18, 19) . In addition, therapeutic antibodies have been developed against ANGPT2 that antagonizes Tie2 in the inflamed vasculature. These include ANGPT2 neutralization antibodies such as trebananib, MEDI3617, LY3127804, nesvacumab and REGN910-3, as well as bispecific ANGPT2-VEGF-targeted antibodies vanucizumab/RG7221 and RG7216 (2, (20) (21) (22) . More recently, ANGPT2-targeted antibody ABTAA has been shown to trigger ANGPT2 clustering, converting ANGPT2 into an 'ANGPT1-like' agonist of TIE2 (23) . To date, ANG-TIE-targeted drugs have been tested in patients with cancer as well as in patients with retinal vascular diseases such as wet age-related macular degeneration (wAMD) and diabetic macular oedema (DMO) (2) . In all of these clinical settings, vascular leak is believed to play a pathogenic role.",

In addition to binding Tie2 at the cell-cell contacts and stabilizing endothelial junctions, ANGPT1 has an affinity to bind to a variety of extracellular matrices (ECM) (24) , responsible for anchoring endothelial Tie2 to cell-ECM attachments. As the action(s) of endogenous ANGPT1 is largely restricted to mediating pericyte-endothelium communication, in order to create a systemic therapy to activate Tie2, we needed to consider how to overcome the 'stickiness' or affinity of ANGPT1 to rapidly bind ECM and become immobile. To overcome the issue of ECM binding, we replaced the coiled-coil domain and linker sequence of ANGPT1 with a 57 amino acid segment derived from serum complement C4BP that naturally folds into a heptavalent scaffold, which allows the recombinant protein to circulate freely while maintaining potent Tie2 activating ability.",

It is expected that the C4BP segment forms a sevenunit stalk further secured by intermolecular disulfide bridges (Fig1B, top), which cluster seven FLDs of ANGPT1 in a stable molecular complex (Fig1B, bottom). In keeping, both C4BP-ANG1 and ANG1-C4BP appeared as high order oligomers of ~250 kDa in size on non-reducing SDS-PAGE, in contrast to their reduced monomeric counterparts of ~35 kDa (Fig1C). Electron microscopy further confirmed the formation of C4BP-ANG1 heptamers (Fig1D). Because storage stability of ANGPT1-based biologics tends to be problematic (25) , we expressed and tested several variants of the fusion constructions. The results showed regardless of the N-to-C domain order and 6xHis tag location all C4BP-ANG1 variants formed stable complexes (supplementary Figure S1 ), and could be safely stored in physiological buffer conditions with no formation of protein aggregates. In addition, we specifically tested ANG1-C4BP after freeze-thaw cycles. There was no quantity or quality decline of the protein complex as determined by UPLC-SEC analysis (supplementary Figure S2 ).",

As expected, by adding purified C4BP-ANG1 or ANG1-C4BP to culture medium of human umbilical vein cells (HUVECs) we observed activation of Tie2 as measured by phospho-Akt (Fig2B). Using a human embryonic kidney (HEK293) cell system that stably expressed full-length Tie2, we showed both C4BP-ANG1 and ANG-C4BP induced Tie2 phosphorylation in a dose-dependent manner (Fig2C). Furthermore, immunofluorescence studies showed a dynamic redistribution pattern of Tie2 on the surface of HUVECs following C4BP-ANG1 stimulation, resembling the effects of natural ANGPT1 (26) . C4BP-ANG1 caused Tie2 to coalesce into small puncta that also migrated towards the cell periphery (Fig2D), further suggesting adequate signaling through Tie2 is achieved. As expected, confluent HUVECs in culture formed continuous cell-cell junctions (Fig2E), whereas treatment of the cells with either LPS or VEGF caused disruption of the junctions in some areas. Meanwhile, when C4BP-ANG1 was present, junctional integrity was maintained in spite of LPS and VEGF treatments (Fig2E), and this is consistent with the function of ANGPT1 in maintaining endothelial quiescence and stability.",

The experiments demonstrated C4BP, either administrated locally through intradermal injection (Fig4A), or systemically through i.v. injection (Fig4B), markedly reduced leakage at the locations of intradermal VEGF injection. Furthermore, in a chemical-induced vascular leakage model using mustard oil, the levels of Evan's Blue leakage were also significantly lower in the C4BP-ANG1 treatment group (Fig4C). To model lung injury leading to ARDS in sepsis, we adapted a lipopolysaccharide-inhalation protocol to induce lung edema. The mice were divided into groups with or without being treated with C4BP-ANG1 from i.v. injection. As expected, mice that received two doses of C4BP-ANG1 treatments were partially protected from lipopolysaccharide-induced lung injury as measured by vascular leakage (Fig4D) .

Strategies include ANGPT1 mimetics, ANGPT2 neutralizing antibodies, bi-specific, doubletargeting antiangiogenic antibodies or affinity traps linking ANGPT2 with VEGF, or similarly, ANGPT2 with Tie2, and small molecule inhibitors of VEPTP or Tie2 catalytic activities, among others (2) . With the exception of Tie2 kinase inhibitors, all these therapies are designed to elevate the activity and function of Tie2 to promote vascular stabilization and reduce vascular response to inflammatory signals. Theoretically, these activities should counteract VEGF-induced neovascularization and inflammatory leakage that is characteristic of many human diseases. Many clinical studies have demonstrated an association between elevated expression of circulating ANGPT2 and poor clinical outcome in diseases characterized by vascular leakage and tissue damage (2, 29) . While it remains unclear if these elevated levels of ANGPT2 antagonizing Tie2 activity during inflammation are causal, agonistic ANGPT1 mimetic treatment with C4BP-ANG1 is predicted to ameliorate vascular destabilization that occurs in severe infectious conditions such as pneumonia from flu or coronavirus. Indeed, several clinical studies confirm that the ratio of circulating ANGPT1/ANGPT2 is predictive of patient outcome (30, 31) .",

These strategies include BowAng1, which contains a dimerization Fc domain and a tandem arrangement of the FLD, achieving a multimericity of 2x2=4. A second strategy fused the FLD of ANGPT1 to the short coiled-coil domain of cartilage oligomeric matrix protein (COMP), which generated a pentameric complex with \"super ligand\" activity. However, while COMP-ANG1 has improved solubility over native ANG1, the coiledcoil-to-coiled-coil interactions, which tend to have broad interaction preference among different coiled-coil domains (32, 33) , have the propensity to trigger protein aggregation during production (15, 25) . It may also retain at the ECM after injection due to a general affinity of the coiled-coil domain towards tissue coiled-coil proteins that are abundantly found in the ECM (24, 34) . We hypothesized that the selection of a scaffold with better serum-compatibility may solve multiple problems: 1) ECM-sequestration 2) degradation from systemic circulation 3) protein aggregation during production and storage and 4) possible antigenicity. Besides forming a heptameric scaffold, the selected C4BP complex used to construct C4BP-ANG1 does not carry immunogenicity of the parent protein. Hence, while C4BP-ANG1 structurally resembles native C4BP heptameric complex, it is able to function as a potent Tie2 ligand via its highly clustered FLDs. Furthermore, C4BP-ANG1 is well tolerated in mice with daily injections for two weeks. Since the fusion was constructed using all human protein sequences of C4BP and ANG1, we have not performed long-term injection studies beyond 14 days due to the concern of development of cross-species neutralizing antibodies.",

Native ANG1 is comprised of, from an N-to Cterminus order, a supercluster domain (SCD), a coiled-coil domain (CCOD), and a fibrinogen-like domain that binds Tie2 (top). The CCOD mediates CCOD-CCOD interactions between ANG1 molecules (middle), and through its linker segment with FLD, also binds the ECM. The SCD further clusters ANG1 into higher degree complexes (bottom). B. The C-terminus of C4BP naturally folds into a \"barrel\" structure through inter-linking disulfide bridges (red) between neighboring subunits. A total of seven (or eight) of these subunits complete the barrel structure (top) that, in C4BP-ANG1 or ANG1-C4BP, displays seven FLD in an arrangement reminiscent of that of native ANG1 (bottom, compared to A).
