However no specific viral cause can sometimes be identified. 2 The self-remitting course of the eruption and the spatial-temporal clustering epidemiology substantiate the viral etiology of GCS. 3 Case report A six-year-old girl endured a one-week bout of a febrile and coryzal illness. Her mother noted intensely pruritic skin eruptions over her legs and forearms one week after remission of the febrile illness. New lesions kept on erupting despite of therapy received. Pruritus was worse at night, and affected sleep significantly. The girl could no longer attend school or sports activities owing to the severe pruritus and that parents of her schoolmates expressed concerns regarding the potential contagiousness of the rash. She also had an episode of vomiting and diarrhoea during the course of illness.",

Ribavirin is said to be efficacious against influenza virus, parainfluenza viruses, respiratory syncytial virus, coronavirus, and hepatitis C virus. In particular, one of us (VZ) observed that oral ribavirin dramatically cleared some of the worse cases of acute severe GCS, when treated by paediatricians for co-existent lower respiratory tract infection (our unpublished observations). In addition, ribavirin is known to be effective in severe respiratory syncytial virus infection which is considered a common cause of GCS in India, especially in the young children (our unpublished observations shared with paediatrician colleagues). These considerations prompted us to consider utilising ribavirin in this disabling case of GCS, although with reluctance due to several concerns regarding the drug intolerance or toxicity, the uncertainty of the result and the absence of supportive literature data.",
