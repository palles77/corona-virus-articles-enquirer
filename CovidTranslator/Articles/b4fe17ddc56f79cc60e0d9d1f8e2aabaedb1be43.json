Records were reviewed to determine which patients with KD had been tested for respiratory viruses. Subsequently, KD patients were classified as cases and controls according to the results of their virology tests. Cases were defined as patients with KD in whom a viral respiratory pathogen was identified, and controls were those KD patients who tested negative for those viruses. Each case was matched with two controls for age, sex and date of hospitalization (\u00b1 3 weeks). Viral testing was performed at the discretion of the attending physician in all patients by direct fluorescent-antibody (DFA) assay for 7 respiratory viruses (RSV, parainfluenza virus [PIV] types 1, 2 and 3, influenza virus A and B and adenovirus). If the DFA was negative a viral culture was automatically performed. Patients' demographic characteristics, clinical presentation, course, response to treatment with intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG), laboratory results, and echocardiographic findings were compared between groups. Refractory disease was defined by the presence of persistent or recrudescent fever 36 hours after completion of IVIG infusion.5 , 8 Incomplete KD was defined by fever for at least 5 days and less than 4 of classic KD clinical criteria at presentation before any echocardiographic studies were performed.5 The study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center at Dallas (IRB #052009-004).",

Due to its seasonality, different studies have attempted to establish a link between KD and specific respiratory viruses including adenovirus, human coronavirus (HCov-NL63) and human bocavirus (HboV) with inconclusive results. 10, 12 , 14 In agreement with Shike and colleagues14 we did not find a predominant virus associated with the disease; rather, a similar proportion of children with KD that had a variety of respiratory viruses including adenovirus, rhinovirus, PIV or influenza. In a study conducted during two outbreaks of KD in United States during the 1980s, a preceding respiratory illness documented by questionnaire was found in 83% and 56% of children with KD, respectively. 15 The investigators measured convalescent-phase antibodies to 33 microbial agents, but there was no information as to whether the presence of a concomitant viral infection was associated with differences in clinical presentation and outcomes. 15 Currently, in the absence of a specific test, the diagnosis of KD relies on clinical characteristics, experience of the clinician, 5 and exclusion of other illnesses that could mimic the disease. 6, 16 In an earlier retrospective study conducted in an emergency department to assess the burden of adenovirus infections in children, treatment with IVIG was withheld and no echocardiograms were performed in 4 of 5 children with adenovirus infection and suspected KD. 7 In our study 3 of 6 patients with KD and adenovirus infections had abnormal echocardiograms initially, and 1 of the 6 patients developed cardiac abnormalities on follow-up examination. Moreover, children with KD and a concomitant viral infection had coronary artery dilations significantly more frequently that the control group. Except for this observation, there were no other significant differences in our cases vs. controls in terms of outcomes. In addition, 18% of patients in each group did not respond to the first dose of IVIG and 9% in each group developed coronary artery aneurysms.",

Our study has a number of limitations. Its retrospective design makes it difficult to draw definitive conclusions. We cannot demonstrate that all patients diagnosed with incomplete KD and a concomitant viral infection had indeed KD, or that the diagnosis of incomplete KD itself prompted clinicians to order viral testing more frequently which may have biased our results. Nevertheless this is an inherent limitation of this disease, whose cause is still unknown. In addition, the fact that non-molecular techniques were used for the diagnosis of respiratory viruses most likely underestimated the real incidence and contribution of respiratory viral infections in these patients and warrants future prospective studies to address the role of respiratory viruses in the pathogenesis of KD.
