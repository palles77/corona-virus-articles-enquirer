The main proposition of this model is that information-sharing practices and context simultaneously shape each other. The proposed model supports Foster's conceptualization of information practices as non-linear processes, but its emphasis on the interdependence between context and information practices provides a more effective means to capture complex negotiations involved in information-sharing practices. The proposition is that the major reason for nonlinearity in information practices is a continuous shifting of actors' interests, pressures, and concerns. Capturing these dynamic relations becomes possible through this model. The model also offers a way to generate a number of research questions and hypotheses, and as such it could be a useful tool for empirical studies on information sharing in academic communities.",

She argues that information-sharing practices in academic communities, although recognized in the literature on scholars' information seeking as omnipresent, \"have rarely been taken as objects of analysis in their own right\" (Talja, 2002, p. 143 ). This might be partly due to the focus on individual information practices in existing models of information behavior (IB). IB \"is conceptualized by many of these models as an intrinsically individual activity\" (Reddy & Jansen, 2008, p. 257) , and presented as \"a linear process consisting of stages and iterative activities\" (Foster, 2004, p. 228) .",

The main contributions of Foster's model to IB research are his understanding information practices as non-linear, complex interactions of activities and contextual elements, and his reinterpretation of the processes of problem definition and problem solving as occurring continuously through all stages of information seeking. However, a major limitation of Foster's model is lack of clarity about how the contextual layers are linked to the information core processes. The proposition here is that actor-network theory (ANT) can provide the means to capture the complexity of the links between information practices and contextual elements by shifting attention from a predetermined existence of the connection to the action of network building.",

Then, in order to address these limitations, ANT and Latour's circulatory system of scientific facts are introduced. An alternate non-linear model of information-sharing practices in academic communities is outlined, and the main elements of the model and its relation to information-sharing practices in academic communities explained. Finally, possible applications of this model, and future research directions are discussed. Foster's (2004) non-linear model of information-seeking behavior introduced a new perspective to the conceptualization of information practices, one in which \"the unit of observation expands from the study of individual tasks, individual search sessions, and the study of activities in relative isolation, and becomes the study of activities within a mesh of complex interactions\" (Foster, 2006, p. 165 ). However, ANT provides a more effective means to capture the non-linear movements of complex social, political, cognitive, and technological negotiations involved in information-sharing practices in academic communities. Latour's (1999) circulatory system of scientific facts is used as a foundation for building a non-linear model of informationsharing practices in academic communities. The main proposition of this model is that although information-sharing practices are shaped by contextual elements, they simultaneously shape the contextual elements. The main difference between this model and other IB models, including Foster's model, is this focus on the interdependence between context and information practices. Instead of a priori placing actors in a context, this model follows the actors in information-sharing practices, as they create context for themselves. As such, the model may contribute to understanding information-sharing practices from the actors' point of view.",

His initial analysis of 45 indepth, semi-structured interviews with academic and postgraduate researchers suggested that scholars' information-seeking activities involved three sequential stages: initial, middle, and final. However, subsequent testing resulted in the emergence of additional underlying themes and activities that could not be explained by a stage model. This inability indicated a need for a conceptual shift from understanding information seeking as a linear process, consisting of stages, to a view of information-seeking activities \"described in terms of concurrent, continuous, cumulative, and looped cycles occurring throughout a research project\" (Foster, 2004, p. 232 ). Foster classified these emergent concepts and activities into three core processes: opening, orientation, and consolidation. These three core processes are situated within three levels of contextual interaction: external context, internal context, and cognitive approach.",

Information behavior changes with any contextual change, and with any new information-seeking experience. Information-seeking activities are therefore \"analogous to an information seeker holding a palette of information behavior opportunities with the whole palette available at any given moment\" (Foster, 2004, p. 235) .",

Although problem definition is a stage placed at the beginning of information seeking in linear models, in Foster's model, the problem definition \"occurs continuously through to closure\" (Foster, 2006, p. 162) . Likewise, in linear models, problem solving is seen as a process of moving through successive stages toward a solution: With each stage the level of certainty is increased, until a stage of problem resolution is reached. On the other hand, in Foster's model, the certainty level is the product of a complex interaction between core processes and contextual elements, so that some activities can increase the level of certainty, and others can reduce it. The level of certainty is also determined by \"previous knowledge, previous information seeking, and other contextual elements\" (Foster, 2006, p. 163 ). Information seeking is completed when information seekers \"have achieved what they consider an appropriate level of certainty for each of the problem elements for which they establish a personal threshold\" (Foster, 2006, pp. 163-164) .",

The graphical representation of Foster's model ( Fig. 1) shows contextual layers as three nested squares that serve as containers for the information-seeking core processes; the movement of information practices is limited to the confines of defined contextual elements. Foster (2006) states that the core processes \"are placed within [emphasis added] an interactive framework of contexts, and a cognitive approach\" (p. 159), which suggests a one-directional causal relationship from context upon information practices. This relationship is not one-directional: Although information-sharing practices may be shaped by context, they also shape the context. Thus a layered presentation of contextual elements is not an adequate representation of the complex non-linear interrelationship between context and information-sharing practices. This suggests that there is a need for a different graphical representation, as well as theoretical conceptualization of the context in order to capture the complexity of the links between information practices and contextual elements. The proposition is that ANT can provide the means to capture these links by shifting attention from a predetermined existence of the connection to the action of network building, since \"the existence of this connection depends on what the actors have done or not done to establish it\" (Latour, 1999, p. 86) .",

            "text": "ANT emerged during the 1980s within the sociology of science and technology, with the work of Bruno Latour, Michael Callon, and John Law. One of the main assumptions of ANT is that science is the process of heterogeneous engineering in which the social, natural, and discursive are puzzled together in the process of translation. Basic concepts of ANT include actor and network. An actor is any agent, collective or individual, that can associate or disassociate with other actors. An actor is not just a point object or a placeholder (Latour, 2005, p. 153) , but an association of heterogeneous elements, so that each actor is also a simplified network (Law, 1992) . Since \"actor\" is frequently used to refer exclusively to humans, the term actant \"is sometimes used to include nonhumans in the definition\" (Latour, 1999, p. 303 ). An actor or actant is \"something that acts or to which activity is granted by others. . . . [which] can literally be anything provided it is granted to be the source of an action\" (Latour, 1997) . The word \"network\" came from the attempt to describe society not as twodimensional or three-dimensional but \"in terms of nodes that have as many dimensions as they have connections\" (Latour, 1997) . The notion of network enables ANT to replace spatial metaphors such as close/far, up/down, local/global, and inside/outside with associations Fig. 1 . Non-linear model of information seeking behavior (Foster, 2004, p. 232) . and connections that are not exclusively social, natural, or technological. This is where ANT differs from most approaches to context, including Foster's, in the IB field.",

            "text": "According to Talja, Keso, and Pietil\u00e4inen (1999) , there are two main approaches to context in the IB field. One is the objectified approach, in which context is described merely as \"a background for the study of individuals' or a particular group's information behavior\" (Talja et al., 1999, p. 753) . The other, interpretative approach, places the context in the foreground, since the context is the place where meaning is socially constructed. Hence this approach could \"be called a social constructionist or discursive approach\" (Talja et al., 1999, p. 753) . Latour (1999) might call these internalist and externalist approaches. In the first, content explains itself, without a need for external assistance. In the second approach, content is explained, or interpreted, by society. Latour (1999) claimed that an internalist explanation without consideration of the rest of the society is \"as meaningless as the idea of a system of arteries disconnected from the system of veins\" (p. 80). However, this does not mean that ANT \"embraces the opposite position, that of a 'social construction' of reality\" (Latour, 1999, p. 84) . For ANT, \"multiplicity is a property of things, not of humans interpreting things\" (Latour, 2005, p. 116) . Instead of using internalist or externalist approaches, which define a priori distance between content and context, Latour (1999) proposed an alternative modelthe circulatory model of scientific facts-in which the aim of researchers is not to find a contextual explanation for a scientific discipline, but to follow \"scientists themselves placing the discipline in a context\" (p. 104).",

In an opposite situation, there will be nothing to share, the circulation will stop, and the whole system will collapse. In most cases, however, academics do not share all of their data, they select only certain information to be shared. Avoiding information sharing can be a result of negotiation within the alliances loop when \"certain data sets funded by private commercial interests may carry usage and confidentiality restrictions that prohibit them from being shared\" (Birnholtz & Bietz, 2003, p. 340) .

This loop deals with the ways that disciplines and institutions provide credibility to the world mobilized in the first loop. Latour argues that an isolated specialist is a contradiction in terms, because agreed criteria of relevance, negotiated within these associations of specialists and regulations of scientific institutions, are \"necessary for the resolution of controversies as is the regular flow of data obtained in the first loop\" (Latour, 1999, p. 103 ). This loop directly accelerates the circulations in the first loop by demanding more and more data, but it also accelerates the circulation in other loops by increasing the credibility of data.

For any research development, it is crucial to cultivate interested powerful groups and institutions, such as military, government, and industry. The links between these groups and research have to be created since there is no natural and self-evident connection between, for example, the military and physics, industry and chemistry, or kings and cartography (Latour, 1999, p. 103 ).

Creating alliances is not a linear process going from basic to applied research. Howells, Nedeva, and Georghiou (1998) point out in their UK survey on industry-academic collaboration that although the significance of linkages between industry and academic communities has become fully recognized since the 1970s, these linkages go back to the late 19th century with the establishment of so called \"redbrick\" universities in the industrial areas of Britain. The aim of these universities was both to serve the academic communities, and align them to the local industry and economy. Recently, for example, we have seen a number of alliances built by academic communities interested in developing clean energy. Developing clean energy is becoming a major issue in winning elections in many countries. Unlikely actors, such as the automobile or coal industries, are building alliances with academic communities. These alliances appear more and more inevitable as academic communities translate their interests and the interests of industry into a composite goal. By shifting their interests, both industry and academic communities are not only creating a new goal, but also building a new context. So, the context is created by actors themselves through a chain of translations. If we place a priori this collaboration in an external contextual element, for example capitalism, and/or in an internal contextual element, such as \"anomalous state of knowledge\" (Belkin, 2005 ), we will not be able to understand this hard work of building alliances. Instead, we should follow the actors themselves in their world-building activities.",

For example, some governments are reluctant to fund human embryo research projects because of public concerns.

So, it is crucial to understand how this loop is connected to the other three contextual loops, and how they are all linked to and by the central loop of the model: how they are moved by, and how they are moving this loop of core processes.",

The core processes are shaped by the contextual elements, but they simultaneously shape the contextual elements, which also shape each other. No loop can circulate without circulation of all other loops. If circulation stops in only one loop, the circulation of the whole model will stop.

This link is so obvious that it appears to be independent from other loops. But any change in the circulation of other loops can change the circulation between networking activities and autonomization loop. The loss of public support, or a change of instruments and/or allies, can stop this circulation, or move the core processes in a non-linear direction. Suddenly, information sharing could go from networking back to the picture-building process again. From here, picture-building activities of mapping relevant concepts of research can be changed with any change in any loop. New instruments can bring new alliances. New data can change public representation. New public concern can create the need for new data. This is why with each contextual change, \"the opportunity and need for information-seeking change too\" (Foster, 2004, p. 235) .",

Or after any attempt of sifting, which is \"the process of deciding which material and sources were relevant\" (Foster, 2004, p. 234) , there is a possibility of moving the circulation of the model out of the loop of the mobilization of the world. The process of serendipity can move the circulation of the contextual elements in even more unpredictable directions.

The level of certainty is defined as a product of interactions between core processes and contextual elements (Foster, 2006) , but ultimately, according to Foster, individual seekers determine what is an appropriate level of certainty according to their personal threshold (Foster, 2006) . This contradiction is a result of a rigid presentation of contextual layers in Foster's model. As the contextual layers are presented as squares, layers, and containers, it is possible to regard them as separate entities, and consequently, to have different answers for different entities. It is possible to say that problem solving is determined by relationships between different actors, but ultimately, it is an individual seeker who has the last word. For ANT, problem definition and problem solving are the result of negotiations between different actors. They are not \"generated by the state of knowledge\u2026[but] they result from the definition and interrelation of actors that were not previously linked to one another\" (Callon, 1986, p. 228) .

This interrelation enables us to see non-linearity in information-sharing processes as a result of complex negotiations, since \"transfers of information never occur except through subtle and multiple transformations\" (Latour, 1999, p. 298) . Actors change the role from intermediaries-simply transporting information-to mediators, because they are \"endowed with the capacity to translate what they transport, to redefine it, redeploy it, and also to betray it\" (Latour, 1993, p. 81) . They change from intermediaries that are shaped by heavy layers of context to mediators that also shape the context, and \"information changes from brick to clay, moved and shaped in unique ways by each perceiver\" (Dervin, 1983, p. 169) . J\u00e4rvelin and Wilson (2003) suggest that one of the most important principles for judging the merits of conceptual models is their ability to generate hypotheses for testing and problems for solving.
