For instance, the outward facing apical membrane of polarized epithelial cells lacks receptors for agents, such as hepatitis C virus, herpesvirus, reovirus, poliovirus or adenovirus. In addition, macrophages eliminate pathogens from the luminal space. Here we show that human adenovirus type 5 engages an antiviral immune response to enter polarized epithelial cells. Blood-derived macrophages co-cultured apically on polarized epithelial cells facilitate epithelial infection. Infection also occurs in the absence of macrophages, if virus-conditioned macrophage-medium containing the chemotactic cytokine CXCL8 (interleukin-8), or recombinant CXCL8 are present. In polarized cells, CXCL8 activates a src-family tyrosine kinase via the apical CXCR1 and CXCR2 receptors. This activation process relocates the viral co-receptor \u03b1\u03bd\u03b23 integrin to the apical surface, and enables apical binding and infection with adenovirus depending on the primary adenovirus receptor CAR. This paradigm may explain how other mucosal pathogens enter epithelial cells.",

We validated this observation with two different human lung epithelial cell lines, bronchial epithelial 16HBE14o cells and alveolar type II epithelial A549 cells. When grown to confluent monolayers on transwell filters and inoculated with a non-replicating adenovirus reporter, which expresses murine interleukin (IL)-2 (Ad5-muIL2, muIL2 expression is hereafter referred to as infection) 17 , both cell types were poorly infected from the apical side, but were strongly infected from the basolateral side yielding infection levels of 20-40% of nonpolarized cell infections (Fig. 1a) .

Isolated human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC)-derived macrophages could not be infected with Ad5-muIL2 up to 45 h postinfection (pi), unlike 16HBE14o cells (Supplementary Fig. S2a ). As expected, PBMCderived macrophages did not express the Ad2/5 attachment receptor CAR, and had moderate levels of \u03b1\u03bd\u03b23/5 integrins on their surface ( Supplementary Fig. S2b 18 ) . To mimic the natural situation of macrophage-controlled mucosal epithelia, we seeded macrophages onto the apical side of polarized 16HBE14o monolayers and allowed attachment for 24 h. Transmission electron microscopy of macrophage and 16HBE14o co-cultures showed intact epithelial monolayers with macrophages attached to the apical membranes (Fig. 1c) . On apical inoculation of co-cultures with Ad5 wildtype for 1 h, virions could be readily detected in vesicular structures of macrophages and to a much lower degree in epithelial cells (Fig. 1c,d) . Epithelial cells cultured without macrophages contained no detectable virus particles (not shown). When co-cultures were inoculated with Ad5-muIL2 for 20 or 30 h, we detected no significant differences between apical or basolateral inoculations, whereas polarized epithelial cells without macrophages were not infected by apical inoculation (Fig. 1e) . These data indicate a crucial role for macrophages in Ad5 infection of epithelial layers consisting of macrophages and epithelial cells.",

            "text": "Macrophage-mediated apical infection depends either on direct interactions of macrophages with epithelial cells, or on messengers secreted from macrophages, such as cytokines. We tested whether the supernatant from macrophages inoculated with adenovirus, the so-called conditioned medium (CM), was sufficient to increase the Ad5-muIL2 infection of polarized epithelial cells. PBMC-derived human macrophages were inoculated with Ad2 for 4 h; the medium was collected and cleared by centrifugation and added to polarized 16HBE14o cells for 4 h, followed by apical inoculation with Ad5-muIL2 for 20 or 30 h (Fig. 2a) . Stimulation of polarized cells with CM led to strong increase of apical infection compared with nonstimulated cells (Fig. 2b) . Although we observed variations of CM potencies between macrophages from different blood donors, the typical increase of viral infection was 8-to 12-fold. In all instances, the maximal stimulation of apical infection was obtained at 4-8 h post stimulation (Fig. 2c) . Interestingly, the infection stimulation was much stronger, if CM was applied apically than basolaterally, and was only marginally increased by simultaneous addition to both apical and the basal domains compared with apical stimulation (Fig. 2d) . Importantly, the CM did not lose its potency by previous centrifugation under conditions, which completely pelleted viral particles ( Supplementary Fig. S3a ). Heat inactivation of CM at 75 \u00b0C for 15 min reduced the stimulatory activity to almost background levels, suggesting that the heat-sensitive factor(s) were responsible for the infection-stimulating effects ( Supplementary Fig. S3b ). Taken together, the data suggest that adenovirus-inoculated macrophages condition the medium with heat sensitive agents, which act on the epithelial cells from the apical side and enhance apical adenovirus infection.",

            "text": "CXCL8 mediates apical adenovirus infection. Adenoviruses are known to trigger the secretion of cytokines from macrophages, which coordinate a concerted antiviral immune response 19 . To identify cytokines in the infection stimulating CM, we performed a BioPlex assay including 12 different cytokines with known effects on epithelial layers. At 4 h after inoculation of macrophages with adenovirus, we detected IL-6, CXCL8, IL-10 and TNF-\u03b1 in the supernatant, and at 8 h, interferon (IFN)-\u03b3 was also detected, but IL-10 was no longer detected (Supplementary Table S1 ). We did not detect IL-1\u03b2, IL-4, IL-12/p70, IL-13, IL-15, IL-17 or IFN-\u03b12, suggesting that these cytokines have no decisive role in stimulation of epithelial infection. The treatment of polarized 16HBE14o cells with recombinant human CXCL8 (CXCL8), however, boosted apical infection in a dose-dependent manner, although not to the full extent as CM. Recombinant human IFN-gamma (IFN-\u03b3) had no infection-supporting impact (Fig. 3a) , although it increased the expression of HLA-1 (MHC-I) epitopes on A549 cells (data not shown). The depletion of CXCL8 from CM with a neutralizing antibody, however, significantly reduced the stimulation of apical infection, whereas depletion of IL-10 did not (Fig. 3b) . These data suggest an important role of CXCL8 in stimulating apical adenovirus infection, although it did not account for the full stimulation by CM. This conclusion was corroborated by the finding that blocking of the CXCL8 receptors, CXCR1 and CXCR2, with neutralizing antibodies before stimulation with CM reduced CM-mediated infection to a significant extent, yet not completely (Fig. 3c) . Neutralization of both receptors together did not have additive effects, suggesting a co-dependency of receptor function by heterodimerization, as earlier reviewed in ref. 20 . CXCR1 and CXCR2 are known to be internalized on ligand activation 21 , which initiates CXCL8 signalling 22 . We found that CMstimulated polarized epithelial cells efficiently internalized both receptors within 10 min, which is consistent with a high degree of activation (Fig. 3d) . Interestingly, both CXCR1 and CXCR2 were found on the apical side of polarized 16HBE14o cells by confocal imaging (Fig. 3e) , supporting the finding that apical application of CM did stimulate infection of 16HBE14o cells (Fig. 2d ).",

The treatment of CM with neutralizing antibodies against CXCL8 before stimulation abrogated the apical localization of \u03b1\u03bd\u03b23 integrin (Fig. 4b,c) . We confirmed these results by selective biotinylation of the apical cell surface and subsequent neutravidin pull-downs of biotinylated proteins (Fig. 4d) . Further analysis by SDS-PAGE and western blotting identified \u03b23 integrin as one of the biotinylated, thus apical proteins. The membrane cofactor CD46, which was reported to localize to the apical membrane compartment 23 , was also significantly biotinylated from the apical side, similar to \u03b23 integrin (Fig. 4d) . We next tested the functional significance of the apical localization of \u03b1\u03bd\u03b23 integrin on CM stimulation. Apical addition of anti-\u03b1\u03bd\u03b23 integrin function blocking antibodies to CM-stimulated 16HBE14o cells strongly reduced Ad5-muIL2 infection, whereas anti-\u03b1\u03bd\u03b25 integrin antibodies had no significant effects (Fig. 4e) . We further confirmed the role of the receptors \u03b1\u03bd\u03b23 integrin and CAR in apical infection on CM stimulation with competition experiments. Soluble forms of CAR and integrin receptors added after the 4 h stimulation period were able to interfere with infection in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 4f) . Control soluble CD46, however, had no effect. Likewise, soluble Ad2 fibre knob inhibited infection whereas Ad35 fibre knob, which does not bind CAR, showed no effect (Fig. 4g ). In agreement with these functional interference data, we found CAR epitopes on the apical side of CM stimulated 16HBE14o cells, distinct from the tight junction marker ZO-1 ( Supplementary Fig. S4c) .",

It is of note that the chemokine CXCL8 not only acts as an important chemo-attractant to neutrophils and initiates directed cell migration, it has also been implicated in inducing wound healing and migration of epithelial and endothelial cells 25 . CXCL8 leads to formation of focal complexes by signalling via Src/FAK and paxillin 26 . We tested whether signalling via Src and paxillin is involved in \u03b1\u03bd\u03b23 integrin relocalization.

We show that macrophages co-cultured with polarized epithelial cells on the lumenal side take up virus particles and secrete cytokines, which enhance infection of the epithelial cells with adenovirus. This cytokine response does not impair the barrier function of the epithelial cells and does not require the presence of macrophages, suggesting that the infection route depends on a viral receptor in the apical epithelial membrane rather than direct transmission of viral particles from macrophages to epithelial cells, for example, a 'Trojan-horse' mechanism as proposed for measles virus 31 . Cytokine mRNAs and proteins, including IL-6, CXCL8 are induced in response to adenovirus infection in several cell lines and also in vivo 32 . For example, CXCL8 was elevated in bronchial alveolar lavage fluid of macaque monkeys on inoculation of an adenovirus vector encoding the cystic fibrosis gene, and enhanced tissue toxicity 33 , or the proinflammatory cytokines TNF-\u03b1, IL-6 and CXCL8 were strongly induced in children with symptomatic human adenovirus viremia after stem cell transplantation 34 . In epithelial cells, the genomes of adenoviruses counter the antiviral effects of the cytokines by expressing early region three genes, and thereby downregulate cytokine mRNAs and protein levels 35 . In macrophages, however, the levels of viral gene expression are low, possibly due to inefficient delivery of viral genomes to the nucleus (reviewed in 28). Hence, we readily found four of the twelve tested cytokines in virus-conditioned macrophage medium, that is, CXCL8, IL-6, TNF-\u03b1 and IFN-\u03b3.",

CM was more potent than isolated cytokines in stimulating infection of nonpolarized cells, but the specific components of CM responsible for these effects are unknown. In contrast, the CXCL8 ligand-receptor pair is best known for its angiogenic and neutrophil chemotactic properties 36 . CXCL8-driven chemotaxis can be elicited in many cell types expressing CXCR1/2. It has an important role in fibroblast-mediated wound healing 37 , the formation of tumour metastases 38 , and neutrophile chemotaxis 37 . Chemotaxis forms and dismantles focal complexes and adhesions, and dynamically modulates anchorage of cells to the extracellular matrix. Anchorage involves \u03b1\u03bd\u03b23 integrin, initially in the leading edge of migrating cells 39 . Intriguingly, CXCL8 enhancement of apical adenovirus infection required the induced localization of \u03b1\u03bd\u03b23 integrin in the apical plasma membrane of the polarized epithelial cells, as indicated by neutralizing antibodies or soluble \u03b1\u03bd\u03b23 integrin competition, which also blocks infection of nonpolarized cells (CJ Burckhardt, M Suomalainen, P Schoenenberger, K.B., S.H. and U.F.G., unpublished results). \u03b1\u03bd\u03b23 integrin has an important role in viral infections, where it serves as an affinity-regulated co-receptor by binding to a 50-amino-acid RGD stretch of the adenoviral capsid protein penton base 40, 41 , and also critically contributes to HIV infection of adherent macrophages 42 .",

Src directly binds the cytoplasmic tail of \u03b23 integrin and is activated by \u03b1\u03bd\u03b23 integrin 44 a positive feedback loop for integrin and Src activation. Activated Src undergoes autophosphorylation on tyrosine 416 inducing a complex with focal adhesion kinase, which then phosphorylates paxillin on its critical tyrosine residue 118 (refs 39,46-48) . The stimulation of polarized epithelial cells with conditioned medium leads to phosphorylation of a Src-family kinase at Y416 and paxillin at Y118, indicating that this pathway is activated. This pathway is crucial for infection, because inhibition of Src family tyrosine kinases with PP1 and PP2 leads to loss of Src and paxillin phosphorylation, failure of \u03b1\u03bd\u03b23 integrin relocalization, and abrogated the infection stimulation. Paxillin may function in \u03b1\u03bd\u03b23 trafficking or as a component of a retention mechanism holding \u03b1\u03bd\u03b23 on the apical membrane on stimulation. Collectively, the data strongly suggest that the conditioned macrophage medium enhances apical infection by the formation of focal contacts and adhesion sites that are normally found in migratory cells.",

CAR has been reported to potentially co-localize with \u03b1\u03bd\u03b23 integrin in lipid-rich membrane patches 49, 50 . It critically supports infection, as indicated by soluble CAR and viral fibre knob competition experiments. In normal polarized epithelial cells, CAR is restricted to the baso-lateral domain and tight junctions by an intracellular trafficking mechanism involving the clathrin-adaptor AP1B 51 . Whether CAR is specifically delivered to the apical membrane or released from tight junctions remains to be investigated. In any case, the virus makes CAR available for apical infection. In doing so, it takes advantage of antiviral functions of CAR on epithelial cells, where CAR binds JAML from neutrophils, and thereby supports the infiltration of immune cells at sites of cell injury and infection 52 . Strikingly, epithelial CAR also enhances wound-healing in mucosal tissue by activating and binding to JAML on gamma-delta T cells 53 . These cells have important roles in primary defence of epithelial barriers against infection, traumatic insults and malignancies. These cells might have pivotal roles in the defence against adenoviral infection, and if impaired contribute to the severe pathological conditions in immunocompromised individuals.",

In the course of this activation, the immune modulator CAR is localized to the apical membrane and becomes available for binding of virus, which together with \u03b1\u03bd\u03b23 integrins triggers viral uptake and infection. This infection mechanism allows viral pathogens to take advantage of immunological antiviral reactions and gain entry into a well-protected epithelium.

For competition experiments, polarized 16HBE14o cells were stimulated with CM at 37 \u00b0C for 4 h, and incubated with soluble CD46, CAR, \u03b1v\u03b23 integrin, Ad2 fibre knob or Ad35 fibre knob at 4 \u00b0C for 1 h. Cells were infected with 10 5 pfu per well of either Ad5_CMV_ muIL2 or Ad5_CMV_eGFP reporter virus from the apical or basal side. In case of co-culture experiments, medium was changed after 8 h and infection continued for another 12 h on air-liquid interface with 100 \u00b5l of medium in the bottom chamber. In all other experiments, medium in both chambers was removed after 1 h and infection proceeded for another 19 h on air-liquid interface with 100 \u00b5l of medium in the bottom chamber. Concentration of muIL2 in the media was assessed by muIL2 ELISA according to the manufacturer's protocol (BD Biosciences). GFP-expression was visualized by confocal microscopy (CLSM (Leica SP5, Leica Microsystems)).",
