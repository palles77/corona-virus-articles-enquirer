Taken at its broadest meaning, the term fading puppies and kittens includes those that are either born weak and fail to thrive or are vigorous but then weaken, dying by approximately 1 week of age. The causes are many and include septicemia, inadequate environment, low birth weight, congenital abnormalities, maternal neglect or trauma, lack of ingestion of colostrum or inadequate milk, and neonatal isoerythrolysis (described as occurring in cats only). In most cases more than one of these factors probably is causative, with primary factors such as hypothermia, deficient colostrum ingestion, and immunodeficiency predisposing the animal to secondary infection, with subsequent hypoglycemia and dehydration leading to cardiopulmonary failure. Treatment of fading puppy and kitten syndrome depends on identification of the underlying cause.",

Small bottles marketed for animals or bottles intended for premature human infants can be used. The hole in the nipple should allow milk to ooze slowly.The bottle should never be squeezed to force expulsion of milk while the animal is nursing. \u2022 Tube feeding is quick. Caution must be used to ensure proper placement of the tube into the gastrointestinal tract and to prevent overflowing and regurgitation. The animal should be held horizontally on its ventrum. The feeding tube varies in diameter and length with age. A 5-Fr feeding tube should be used in animals weighing less than 300 g and an 8-to 10-Fr feeding tube should be used in animals weighing more than 300 g. Measure the length of the feeding tube by marking off 75% of the distance from the animal's last rib to the tip of its nose. This length ensures placement in the stomach without kinking of the tube within the gastrointestinal tract. Length should be rechecked and adjusted weekly. The warmed formula is gently expelled through the tube with a syringe. Monitor gastric distention; average stomach capacity in neonates is approximately 0.7 fl oz (4 tsp) per pound (40 ml/kg). The genital area should be massaged with a cotton ball or soft cloth moistened with warm water after feeding to promote urination and defecation.",

A growth food appropriate for the species, not human baby food, should be introduced. Young animals need more nutrients to allow for normal growth and development but take longer to ingest food and have a smaller digestive capacity, necessitating feeding ofa highly digestible food that is dense with energy-producing nutrients. Food should be offered as a gruel initially, formed by thoroughly blending 1 part dry food to 3 parts water or 2 parts canned food to 1 part water for puppies, and 1 part dry food to 3 parts formula or 2 parts canned food to 1 part formula for kittens. Fewer problems with postprandial gastric distention occur if the food is thoroughly soaked. Fresh water always should be provided. Gradually, less water or formula is mixed with the food until the puppy or kitten is eating dry food exclusively. Weaning usually is complete by 6-8 weeks of age. By the",
