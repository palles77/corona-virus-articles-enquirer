            "text": "To identify protein split sites quickly, a selection procedure by using chloramphenicol acetyl transferase (CAT) as reporter was introduced to search for folded protein fragments from libraries generated by random digestion and reassembly of the target gene, which yielded an abundant amount of DNA fragments with controllable lengths. Experimental results of tryptophan synthase alpha subunit (TSa) and TEM-1 b-lactamase agreed well with what the literature has reported. The solubility of these fragments correlated roughly with the minimum inhibitory concentrations of the CAT fusions. The application of this dissection protocol to protein fragment complementation assay (PCA) was evaluated using aminoglycoside-3 0 -phosphotransferase I (APH(3 0 )-I) as a model protein. Three nearly bisectional sites and a number of possible split points were identified, and guided by this result, four novel pairs of fragments were tested for complementation. Three out of four pairs partially restored the APH activity with the help of leucine zippers, and a truncated but active APH(3 0 )-I (D1-25) was also found. Finally, the weakly active APH(3 0 )-I-(1-253)NZ/CZ (254-271) containing a short 18 residue tag was further improved by errorprone PCR, and a best mutant was obtained showing a fourfold improvement after just one round of evolution. These results demonstrate that protein random dissection based on the CAT selection can provide an efficient search for protein breakage points and guide the design of fragments for protein complementation assay. Furthermore, more active fragment pairs can be achieved with the classical directed evolution approach.",

Experimental methods employing proteolysis or chemical cleavage of purified proteins access only limited sites. 13, 14 A different strategy employed by several laboratories is to create random fragment libraries by random primer polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method, 15 deoxyuridine incorporation method, 12, 16 or DNase I fragmentation, 17, 18 then search for properly folded polypeptides using a reporter protein such as green fluorescent protein (GFP) or an antibody. 16 Folded units can be probed independently of structure and function by these approaches. 12, 15, 16 However, the quality of fragment libraries constructed needs to be further improved because of preferential amplification, biased digestion, low efficiency, and the difficulty in controlling the lengths of fragments.",

In this current study, the previously used reporter protein, GFP, was replaced by chloramphenicol acetyl transferase (CAT) to allow for quicker selection of soluble protein fragments by simply evaluating chloramphenicol resistance of fragment-CAT fusion proteins. 21, 22 Also, improvements were introduced that led to generation of gene fragments concentrating in the range of 250-500 bp, which covered the most likely folded units in the range of about 80-170 aa. 17, 23 Experimental results for tryptophan synthase alpha subunit (TSa) and TEM-1 b-lactamase agreed well with what the literature has reported. 9, 10, 24 Further dissection of aminoglycoside-3 0 -phosphotransferase I (APH(3 0 )-I) yielded three nearly bisectional sites and a number of interesting cleavable points.",

Protein bisection using an incremental truncation assay 10, 11, 26 represents an improvement but requires a functionality-based selection assay, which limits its utility. Because PCA is based on the complementary action of normally two independently expressed protein fragments, 25 it is reasonable that more active heterodimers will be obtained when complementation occurs at the boundaries of independently folded units. To this end, four breakage sites from APH(3 0 )-I dissection with levels of different solubility were tested for complementation with the help of leucine zippers. 11, 27 Three out of the four pairs were found to restore partial activity, including the pair APH(3 0 )-I-(1-253)NZ/CZ(254-271). A truncated but active APH(3 0 )-I (D1-25) was also found, with activity as high as 50% of the wild type in terms of the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC). These illustrate that possible sites for protein complementation can be probed directly by simply evaluating the solubility of corresponding fragments. Finally, the short tag containing 18 amino acid residues in the pair APH(3 0 )-I-(1-253)NZ/CZ(254-271) was not reported previously, and as it has the potential to be a useful PCA reporter, random mutagenesis was further performed on the pair to improve its activity.",

Using this modified vector, 13 folded fragments were generated from TEM-1 b-lactamase dissection, aligned to the template sequence as shown in Figure 3 (B). The dissection results of TEM-1 b-lactamase showed four hot spots: around L40, E177-T181, A217, and A232-S235. Closer inspection showed that, among the 16 breakage sites obtained (Table III b ), F60 and A217 were near the sub-domain boundaries around F66 and K215. 28 Site R191 was close to the breakage points G196, E197, and L198 previously identified by complementation. 9, 24 .

Furthermore, sites L113 and M155 obtained in our CAT selection were close to the peak regions around G116 and T149 judged by SCHEMA to be harmful for recombination but later proved experimentally to be useful recombination sites. 30, 32 As recombination of homologous proteins likely requires the exchanged fragments to be more independently folded or less disrupted by exchange, these useful recombination sites were considered to be likely breakage points in this study. Overall, 16 out of 19 reported recombinant sites for TEM-1 b-lactamase were found in our CAT selection.

Leucine zippers have been shown to assist the reassembly of fragments of GFP, TEM-1 b-lactamase, and APH(3 0 )-IIa. 9, 11, 27 It was also reported that a short linker between fragment and the leucine zipper could lead to higher activity for APH(3 0 )-IIa, 11 thus in this study leucine zippers and short linkers GS and GSS were used for APH(3 0 )-I fragment complementation (see Fig. 1 ). Sites for complementation were chosen obtained in this work  L40, I64, T68, A137, D161, I166, A180, T183,  A185   G26, S215,   Previously reported results b  E42, A73, E135, R145, P155, G170, R188,  P192 based on the solubility of the fragment-CAT fusions (Table II) . Sites T90 (in APH-3) and G117 (in APH-7) were chosen as APH-3, APH-7, and the closely related APH-4 (with site F87) and APH-11 (with site L81) were more soluble than others. Sites A62, V65, and D67 were identical to the reported ones, 11 and thus were not further tested. A152 was not chosen because of the poor solubility of APH-5. Furthermore, D198 was in the ATP binding pocket, while W173 and V217 were close to the presumed kanamycin binding sites D168, E169, and R219 in APH(3 0 )-I (corresponding to D160, E161, and R211 of APH(3 0 )-IIa), 33 and F263 was only 8 residues away from the C-terminus. Lastly, D122, V126, and R246 were close to G117 and I253, thus these sites were not chosen. The remaining two sites, Y26 and I253, were also chosen for testing. During the actual sub-cloning, the corresponding gene segments for the intended N-terminal and C-terminal fragments were pooled respectively, and then inserted into the dual promoter vector pCY-T7 in sequel. At first, the activity of individual APH(3 0 )-I fragments with leucine zippers was characterized. All fragments could not confer resistance to kanamycin above the background level (12.5 lg/mL) except for APH(3 0 )-I-CZ(26-271), which showed a MIC of 100 lg/mL at 37 C in the absence of IPTG and 800 lg/mL at 23 C in the presence of IPTG, which was about 50% of the wild type. The deletion of the leucine zipper slightly lowered the MIC level (Table IV) . On the other hand, the MIC of APH(3 0 )-I-(1-25)NZ/CZ(26-271) was higher at all conditions, suggesting residues 1-25 of APH(3 0 )-I was not critical but helpful for the APH activity. At both 23 and 37 C, heterodimers also partially restored the APH activity at T90, I253 but not at G117 in the presence of 0.2 mM IPTG (Table IV) . The weak APH(3 0 )-I-(1-253)NZ/CZ(254-271) activity suggests that the C-terminal helix with 18 amino acids of APH(3 0 )-I can serve as an essential part for complementation.",

            "text": "In this study, a modified protein random dissection method combined with selection using CAT to search for folded fragments for identification of protein split sites was established. Experimental results of TSa and TEM-1 b-lactamase agreed well with what was reported in the literature, and yielded a wealth of information on the protein breakage points for APH(3 0 )-I, demonstrating that this method had the potential to be a general strategy to search protein split sites quickly and likely exhaustively, without requiring the structural knowledge of the target protein. Furthermore, three APH(3 0 )-I fragment pairs partially restored the activity with the help of leucine zippers, which may be useful for use in PCA. Therefore, active heterodimers can be obtained when complementation occurs at split sites identified from protein random dissection, and this provides a significant guide for PCA design. Nonetheless, it should be noted that for any such pairs to be useful in a PCA assay, further tests for spontaneous complementation and reversibility, and possibly further mutagenesis are required. 34 For APH(3 0 )-I, it is noteworthy that a number of more active heterodimers contain short or long overlapping sequences (Table IV) , an observation consistent with other reports. [35] [36] [37] [38] It has been proposed that the redundant polypeptide chains are pushed away, 36 but the reason for promoting complementation by these extra chains remains to be investigated. Notably, these heterodimers, such as APH(3 0 )-I-(1-117)NZ/ CZ(91-271), restore much higher activity (more than 25% of the parental protein) than those APH(3 0 )-IIa pairs previously reported (less than 10% of the parental protein). 11 Exploitation of possible protein split sites by our method has some advantages over the others. First, the procedure is facile, and which is similar to DNA shuffling protocol. 39 And using a reassembly step helps to control the fragment size distribution by simply adjusting the number of PCR cycles. As judged from the agarose gel analysis of reassembled DNA samples (see Fig. 2 ), gene fragment libraries constructed in this study were enriched at 250-500 bp, a range of sizes where domain or smaller folded units mostly likely reside. Colony PCR results of chloramphenicol resistant cells containing fragment-CAT fusions also revealed that the gene fragments in these cells centered at 250-500 bp (see Fig. 4 ). In addition, sequencing of resistant clones revealed $93.6% (74/79) folded fragments in libraries were unique, indicating no fragment was amplified preferentially. The use of CAT (with deletion of the initiation codon ATG) also significantly facilitates screening, independent of protein structure or function.",

As these sites are the boundaries at which the fragments can be exchanged, they are thus considered to be likely breakage points in this work. We have chosen STAR to systematically search for such possible sites for comparison. As shown in Figure 3 (D), the STAR score curve for APH(3 0 )-I generated by the predictor has five clear valleys which are presumably to contain possible recombination and thus likely spilt sites. Among the dissection sites of APH(3 0 )-I obtained in this work [solid lines in Fig. 3(D) ], only five sites (L81, F87, T90, D198, and V217) are within the STAR-predicted valleys, while 12/17 sites are away from the valleys, and in particularly 9/17 are close to the peaks. A similar pattern of discrepancy has been observed for TSa and TEM-1 b-lactamase between experimentally determined split sites and predicted recombination sites (Fig. S2 in supplementary data) . Nonetheless, these two computational methods provide complementary guides in search for possible split sites for a target protein. Folded fragments for the three proteins dissected in this work were mapped onto the primary amino acids sequence of the parental proteins (see Fig. 3 ). A structural analysis shows that split points from TSa and TEM-1 b-lactamase are predominant near the surface of the proteins and tend to cluster within loops ($90% of the sites are on the surface and half of which within loops). 38, 41 Split sites within secondary structures might introduce more severe disruption to a protein structure, therefore these sites should be carefully analyzed for further application in protein complementation. The fact that APH(3 0 )-I-(1-117)NZ/ CZ(118-271) showed no activity is presumably due to the position of G117 in one of the helices.",
