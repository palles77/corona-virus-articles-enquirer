            "text": "Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) is a highly contagious enteric pathogen of swine causing high mortality rates in piglets. PEDV outbreaks have occurred continuously in most swine-producing Asian countries and have recently emerged in the United States, leading to large economic losses for both the Asian and US pig industries. The spike (S) protein of PEDV consists of the S1 and S2 domains, responsible for virus binding and fusion, respectively. The involvement of the S1 domain in specific highaffinity interactions with the cellular receptor and induction of neutralizing antibodies in the natural host makes it a logical target for the development of effective vaccines and therapeutics against PEDV. Passive immunization by oral administration of egg yolk antibodies (IgY) obtained from immunized chickens provides an alternative source of specific antibodies for the prevention and treatment of PEDV in newborn piglets. In this study, we produced an IgY against the PEDV S1 protein and investigated its immunoprophylactic effect in neonatal piglets. A codonoptimized PEDV S1 gene consisting of amino acid residues 25-749 was synthesized and used to establish a stable porcine cell line constitutively expressing a recombinant PEDV S1 protein containing the chicken immunoglobulin Fc fragment at its C-terminus. The purified recombinant S1 protein was found to mediate potent immune responses in immunized hens. We next tested the ability of oral passive immunization with anti-PEDV S1 IgY to protect piglets against PEDV. Specific chicken IgY against the S1 protein was orally administered to neonatal piglets, and their responses subsequent to a virulent PEDV challenge were monitored. The results showed that oral administration of anti-PEDV S1 IgY efficiently protects neonatal piglets against PEDV, suggesting its potential as a prophylactic or therapeutic agent against acute PEDV infection.",

PED epidemics were first reported in Asia in 1982, and PED has since continued to threaten swine health, causing substantial economic losses for the Asian swine industry [3, 11, 21, 30, 38] . In early 2013, sudden PED outbreaks occurred in the United States sweeping through the pork industry across the country [24, 35] . Subsequently, starting in late 2013, large-scale outbreaks of PED rapidly recurred in Korea, Taiwan, and Japan; a US-strain-like PEDV was found to be responsible for the recent outbreaks in those countries, raising global concerns regarding control measures for PED prevention [17] [18] [19] 22] .",

The spike (S) protein of PEDV is a type I membrane glycoprotein consisting of 1,383 to 1,386 amino acids (aa), depending on the strain, that can be divided into the S1 (aa 1-735) and S2 (736-end) domains based on homology to the S proteins of other coronaviruses [6, 9, 15, 36] . Similar to other coronavirus S proteins, the PEDV S protein plays a critical role by interacting with the cellular receptor to mediate viral entry and inducing neutralizing antibodies in the natural host [1, 2] . More precisely, the S1 domain has been reported to contain the receptor-binding region and the main neutralizing epitopes [16, 37] . Furthermore, the S1 region has been established as a suitable target for determining genetic relatedness among PEDV isolates and for developing differential diagnostic assays and effective vaccines [4, 7, 15, 26] .",

This phenomenon appears to be due to genetic and antigenic differences between the vaccine strain and the strains prevalent in the field [15, 26] . Thus, the lack of effective vaccines increases the need for next-generation field-virus-based vaccines or control measures against PEDV infection. Passive immunization by oral administration of specific antibodies represents an attractive approach against gastrointestinal pathogens in both humans and animals [23] .

Ten generated cell clones were initially collected and subjected to RT-PCR and western blot analysis to examine S1 expression at the mRNA and protein level, respectively (data not shown).

            "text": "Vaccination against PEDV is one of the most important and effective prevention measures by passively transferring specific neutralizing antibodies present in vaccinated sows to their litters through colostrum and milk. Despite the availability of commercial attenuated and inactivated vaccines in Korea, PEDV continues to plague the domestic pork industry, raising issues regarding their protective efficacy. Recently, severe outbreaks of PEDV have reemerged in Korea and have been estimated to affect over 40 % of pig farms, causing serious economic impact on producers and customers [17, 18] . Our previous studies suggested that antigenic and genetic variations between the vaccine virus and field PEDVs may be the cause of the incomplete efficacy or failure of vaccination, which appears to be responsible for the periodic outbreaks in domestic herds [15, 26] . Furthermore, a comparison of the amino acid sequence of the S1 domain of the PEDV S protein, which is associated with viral binding to host cell receptors and contains neutralizing epitopes [16, 37] , has shown a difference of over 10 % between the vaccine strain and field isolates, suggesting the need for next- Effect of IgY against the PEDV S1 protein 2203 generation vaccine development [15, 17] . In addition to vaccination, artificial passive immunization using IgY has been used commercially as an alternative method for controlling PED by providing supportive immunity to neonatal piglets exposed to acute infection in Korea. However, opinions differ among swine practitioners and producers regarding the efficacy of this immunoprophylactic strategy. A similar debate regarding the commercial use of IgY may arise since the vaccine strain is also used to immunize chickens for the production of anti-PEDV IgY in Korea. We have previously demonstrated that the S1 protein of PEDV could be considered a potential candidate antigen for vaccination [26] . In the present study, the S1 protein of the field PEDV was used as an immunogen to inoculate hens, thereby producing anti-PEDV S1 IgY. We first aimed to stably express the full-length, codon-optimized S1 gene of PEDV in porcine-origin cells and to evaluate the immunogenicity and efficacy of IgY against the recombinant S1 protein. Subsequently, we were able to successfully generate a stable PK cell line continuously producing large amounts of the codon-optimized S1 protein tagged with cFc. Following the purification and concentration processes, approximately 30-40 lg of the recombinant S1-cFc protein could be consistently harvested from the culture supernatants of PK-rS1-cFc cells grown in a 100-mm culture dish. Since humoral immunity is an important indicator for evaluating the effect of the S1-based immunogen used in this study, we immunized chickens with the S1-cFc antigen prepared from the cell culture supernatants of PK-rS1-cFc cells and investigated whether they developed cytokine and antibody responses. All of the proinflammatory cytokines tested, except for TNF-a, were stimulated in chickens immunized with either the whole virus or the S1-cFc antigen. Of these, the expression levels of IL-6 and IL-8 genes were distinctly enhanced in the S1-cFc-inoculated group compared with the inactivated PEDV-inoculated group. Furthermore, the chicken sera raised against S1-cFc contained higher levels of neutralizing antibody than those raised against the SM98-1 vaccine virus. However, the final levels of anti-PEDV IgY were lower in the eggs of the S1-cFc-immunized chickens compared to those of the SM98-1-inoculated group. These inconsistent results may be attributed to the use of the heterogeneous SM98-1 virus in the serum neutralization assay, which possesses a high degree of genetic variation in field isolates. Nevertheless, our data indicated that the recombinant S1 protein efficiently elicits immune responses in chickens. Subsequently, we tested the prophylactic efficacy of each IgY in suckling piglets post-challenge-exposure. Our data showed that, regardless of the IgY administered, all neonatal piglets treated with IgY survived after challenge with virulent PEDV, suggesting that the anti-PEDV S1 IgY provides effective passive immunity to prevent mortality comparable to whole-virus-based IgY. Despite the lower levels of virus shedding in the feces of animals treated with anti-PEDV IgY, the anti-S1 IgY-based strategy resulted in more-efficient protection than the anti-PEDV IgY procedure, as determined by the duration and severity of diarrhea and histopathological lesions. These results indicated that the administration of anti-S1 IgY could significantly reduce the mortality and clinical signs of piglets, suggesting that Tissue specimens were collected from the small intestines of piglets from each group at the time of necropsy. The formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded tissue sections were deparaffinized and stained with hematoxylin and eosin. The sections were examined using a light microscope at 409 magnification. The inset images are enlarged versions of parts of the picture Effect of IgY against the PEDV S1 protein 2205 application of anti-S1 IgY is capable of partially blocking the virus from invading the small intestine. A more promising approach would be to use the entire field virus or its full-length S protein to produce IgY instead of using only the S1 domain, since the S protein contains multiple functional domains and neutralizing epitopes to efficiently stimulate non-susceptible hosts. For this purpose, the production and application of IgY against a Korean field isolate are currently under investigation.",

The results presented here indicate that the recombinant S1 protein can elicit cytokine and antibody responses and induce neutralizing antibodies in chickens. Furthermore, challenge experiments revealed that administration of anti-S1 IgY efficiently protected suckling piglets against field PEDV by providing passive immunity. PEDV infection causes high mortality rates (90-100 % in neonatal piglets under 7 days of age), and epidemiological observations indicate the rapid spread of the disease. In this circumstance, the preliminary results of the present study showed the potential of anti-PEDV S1 IgY application as a considerable measure against PEDV. Further experiments to optimize production procedures will be required to achieve higher titers of IgY; field studies on farms will be needed to better evaluate the efficacy of anti-S1 IgY. These studies will provide additional practical information for the future use of this alternative IgY method as a supplement to passive immunity against PED and other economically important viral diseases.
