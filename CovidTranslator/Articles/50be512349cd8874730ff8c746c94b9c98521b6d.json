It was not detected in the 42 dogs without clinical illness but was present in three (D4, D19, and D21) out of the 31 dogs with diarrhea symptoms. These rectal swabs were negative for canine parvovirus antigen. CAstV-genepositive rectal swabs were tested for CAstV and other RNA viruses (canine distemper virus, canine rotavirus, canine calicivirus, canine norovirus, canine kobuvirus, and canine coronavirus). Of the three dogs with positive rectal swabs, D4 (Toy Poodle, male, 2 months old) was positive for the CAstV gene only. In D19 (Miniature Dachshund, female, 1 A sequence analysis of the full-length capsid protein gene was performed to determine the genogroup of the detected CAstV strains, and amino acid sequences were deduced. Of the three CAstV strains, the sample volumes of the CAstV KU-D19-12 and KU-D21-12 strains were insufficient to perform a sequence analysis of the fulllength capsid protein gene. Thus, only the CAstV KU-D4-12 strain was analyzed, and its amino acid sequence was deduced. The CAstV KU-D4-12 strain was found to belong to the clade corresponding to the species Mamastrovirus 5, as were the other CAstV strains. In addition, the full-length capsid protein of the CAstV D4-12 strain showed more than 90 % sequence identity to that of the CAstV VM-2011 strain (Fig. 3) .
