HME disease can range from mild to a fatal, toxic shock-like syndrome, yet the mechanisms regulating pathogenesis are not well understood. We define a central role for type I interferons (alpha interferon [IFN-\u2423] and IFN-\u2424) in severe disease in a mouse model of fatal ehrlichiosis caused by Ixodes ovatus Ehrlichia (IOE). IFN-\u2423 and IFN-\u2424 were induced by IOE infection but not in response to a less virulent strain, Ehrlichia muris. The major sources of type I IFNs during IOE infection were plasmacytoid dendritic cells and monocytes. Mice lacking the receptor for type I IFNs (Ifnar deficient) or neutralization of IFN-\u2423 and IFN-\u2424 resulted in a reduced bacterial burden. Ifnar-deficient mice exhibited significantly increased survival after IOE infection, relative to that of wild-type (WT) mice, that correlated with increased type II IFN (IFN-\u2425) production. Pathogen-specific antibody responses were also elevated in Ifnar-deficient mice, and this required IFN-\u2425. Remarkably, increased IFN-\u2425 and IgM were not essential for protection in the absence of type I IFN signaling. The direct effect of type I IFNs on hematopoietic and nonhematopoietic cells was evaluated in bone marrow chimeric mice. We observed that chimeric mice containing Ifnar-deficient hematopoietic cells succumbed to infection early, whereas Ifnar-deficient mice containing WT hematopoietic cells exhibited increased survival, despite having a higher bacterial burden. These data demonstrate that IFN-\u2423 receptor signaling in nonhematopoietic cells is important for pathogenesis. Thus, type I IFNs are induced during a rickettsial infection in vivo and promote severe disease.",

Mice lacking the IFN-\u2423R are more resistant to infection with Listeria monocytogenes (9, 10) . Type I IFNs also render macrophages more susceptible to necroptosis, thus contributing to severe disease in Salmonella infection (11) . In contrast, type I IFNs are protective during certain bacterial infections. For instance, type I IFN signaling is crucial for host resistance to group B streptococcal infection, which correlated with increased tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-\u2423) and nitric oxide production by macrophages in the presence of type I IFN signaling (12) . Recently, the significance of type I IFNs during fungal infection was also observed, in that renal dendritic cell (DC)-derived IFN-\u2424 is necessary for host defense against Candida albicans infection (13) . Thus, it appears that type I IFNs can be protective during extracellular bacterial and fungal infections but contribute to pathogenesis during intracellular bacterial infections (7) ; however, the mechanisms for the dual effects of type I IFNs during bacterial infection are not well defined.",

            "text": "One possible explanation for the pathogenic role of type I IFNs during bacterial infection may be due to the ability of type I IFNs to suppress IFN-\u2425 expression and signaling. IFN-\u2425 is essential for clearance of many intracellular bacterial infections, including L. monocytogenes, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, and Ehrlichia muris (14) (15) (16) , and the ability of type I IFNs to suppress IFN-\u2425 signaling may contribute to bacterial pathogenesis. This idea is supported by observations in humans. It was shown in human leprosy patients that type I IFNs correlated with disseminated and progressive disease, whereas IFN-\u2425 was expressed in self-healing lesions (17) . The authors further demonstrated that IFN-\u2425-induced signaling and induction of antimicrobial pathways were inhibited by IFN-\u2424. In addition, type I IFNs correlate with active disease in M. tuberculosis patients (18) . Highly virulent strains of M. tuberculosis upregulate type I IFNs, impair Th1 responses (19) , and are less pathogenic in the absence of IFN-\u2423R signaling (20) . Impaired IFN-\u2425-mediated signaling by type I IFNs in these contexts may rely on downregulation of the IFN-\u2425 receptor, as observed in L. monocytogenes infection (9) , thus allowing increased pathogen growth in macrophages, or may interfere with downstream signaling pathways induced by IFN-\u2425 (17) .",

Misdiagnosis is very common for rickettsial infections, as presentation often occurs with nonspecific symptoms, and delayed treatment correlates with a poor out-come (21, 22) . There are currently no therapeutic treatments for severe rickettsial infections that are unresponsive to antibiotics. Human monocytic ehrlichiosis (HME) is caused by the obligate intracellular pathogen Ehrlichia chaffeensis. In recent years, additional isolates have been identified (23) , and it is not yet clear whether strain differences contribute to disease outcome. HME can be mild in some patients, whereas in others it progresses rapidly to a toxic shock-like syndrome or even death (24) . HME can be modeled in mice by using two genetically related pathogens, Ehrlichia muris, which causes mild disease (25) , and Ixodes ovatus Ehrlichia (IOE), which causes severe, fatal ehrlichiosis (16, (25) (26) (27) (28) . IOE-infected mice exhibit severe liver injury and leukocyte necrosis, similar to what is observed in severely ill HME patients; thus, IOE is an ideal model of severe ehrlichiosis and infection-induced shock (24) .",

In addition, fatal recall responses after low-dose infection of IOE were due to CD8 T cells and significant production of TNF-\u2423 (30) . TNF-\u2423 may promote shock-like disease during IOE by driving apoptosis and necrosis, as has been shown in mouse models of lethal inflammation (31) and in humans receiving high doses of TNF-\u2423 (32) . Despite the pathogenic inflammatory response induced by TNF-\u2423, mice deficient in TNF receptors still succumbed to primary IOE infection, suggesting that TNF-\u2423-mediated signaling may also be important for control of bacterial growth. In addition, this finding suggests that additional mechanisms are likely involved in promoting severe disease.",

Here, we first wanted to determine if type I IFNs were induced during ehrlichial infection, and then we sought to address their impact on disease. We demonstrate that induction of type I IFNs from plasmacytoid DC (pDC) and monocytes occurs in response to the highly virulent ehrlichial strain IOE but not in response to less virulent E. muris. We demonstrate that type I IFNs contribute significantly to disease and modulate host immune responses. We made the novel observation that IFN-\u2425 maintains the humoral immune response to IOE infection in the absence of type I IFN signaling. Surprisingly, however, IFN-\u2425 was not required for host defense to IOE infection in Ifnar-deficient mice. Moreover, we found that the host death during IOE infection was not dependent upon uncontrolled bacterial growth but was promoted by type I IFN signaling in nonhematopoietic cells. Our finding reveals a previously unrecognized role for type I IFNs in mediating pathogenesis during severe ehrlichial infection in vivo.",

            "text": "Gamma interferon (IFN-\u2425) production provides protection during ehrlichial infection (16, 34) and mediates hematopoietic changes, including increased monocyte production (43) . Whether type I IFNs are produced in vivo and if they play a protective or pathogenic role in disease outcome has not yet been investigated for any rickettsial pathogen. Here, we sought to determine the kinetics of IFN-\u2423 and -\u2424 production in models of mild and lethal ehrlichial disease. As expected, E. muris infection elicited robust IFN-\u2425 production, with peak concentrations detected in the sera at day 11 postinfection (43) (Fig. 1A) . IOE infection, however, elicited very little IFN-\u2425 production, consistent with what has been previously reported (28) . In contrast to IFN-\u2425, production of IFN-\u2423 and IFN-\u2424 was found to be high in the sera of IOE-infected animals, with peak concentrations detected on day 7 postinfection (Fig. 1B and C). Type I IFNs were undetectable in E. muris-infected mice. To determine if type I IFNs were also produced in tissues, type I IFN protein was measured in the spleen, lung, and liver. We found that IFN-\u2423 was increased in spleen and liver ( Fig. 1D and E) but not in the lung (Fig. 1F ) of IOE-infected mice, while IFN-\u2424 was detected at increased concentrations in all three tissues. These data demonstrate that mild ehrlichial disease correlated with a strong IFN-\u2425 response, whereas severe disease caused by IOE infection correlated with increased type I IFNs. We observed that mice deficient in TLR2 had elevated type I IFNs in the sera, relative to wild-type (WT) and MyD88-deficient mice ( Fig. 1G and H) . As TLR2-deficient mice are more susceptible to IOE infection (44) , these data raised the possibility that type I IFNs mediate more severe disease.",

Type I IFNs contribute to pathogenesis in some bacterial infections (11, 17, 45) ; thus, we next sought to investigate whether type I IFNs were protective or pathogenic during ehrlichial infection. Using mice deficient in the alpha subunit of the IFN receptor (Ifnar deficient), blocking signaling for all type I IFNs (\u2423, \u2424, and \u03b5), we first tested whether mice deficient in type I IFN-mediated signaling exhibited increased survival relative to WT mice after IOE infection. Whereas IOE infection was uniformly fatal in WT mice, 70% of Ifnar-deficient mice survived ( Fig. 2A) . As expected, IFN-\u2423R-mediated signaling did not affect survival of E. murisinfected mice. We next measured the bacterial burden in different organs of WT and Ifnar-deficient mice during IOE infection. Relative to WT mice, Ifnar-deficient mice exhibited significantly reduced bacterial burdens in the spleen and lung (Fig. 2B) . To investigate whether both IFN-\u2423 and IFN-\u2424 were contributing to the pathogenesis of IOE infection, we neutralized IFN-\u2423 or IFN-\u2424, or both, in WT mice. Relative to vehicle control, IFN-\u2423-or IFN-\u2424-neutralizing antibody-treated mice exhibited slightly reduced bacterial burdens in the spleen and lung, whereas mice treated with both anti-IFN-\u2423 and anti-IFN-\u2424 had significantly reduced bacterial burdens (Fig. 2C and D) , indicating that both IFN-\u2423 and IFN-\u2424 contributed to increased bacterial growth during IOE infection.",

Multiple cell types can produce type I IFNs (6, (45) (46) (47) ; thus, we sought to identify the origin of type I IFNs during ehrlichial infection. We performed intracellular staining to detect cellular sources of IFN-\u2423 during IOE infection at day 7 postinfection, as this was the peak of the IFN-\u2423 response. Relative to mockinfected mice, IOE-infected WT mice exhibited two populations of IFN-\u2423-positive cells in the spleen: Ly6C \u03e9 CD11b \u03ea and Ly6C \u03e9 CD11b \u03e9 cells (Fig. 3A) . The Ly6C \u03e9 CD11b \u03ea cells expressed CD45, CD317 (PDCA-1), Siglec H, and B220 but did not express CD3, CD19, NK1.1, or Ly6G (data not shown), indicating they are likely pDCs (48) (49) (50) . The Ly6C \u03e9 CD11b \u03e9 cells expressed CD115 and were F4/80 \u03e9/\u03ea , characteristic of monocytes. Thus, we concluded that the two populations of IFN-\u2423 \u03e9 cells were pDCs and monocytes, respectively, both of which were significantly increased (Fig. 3C) . To identify IFN-\u2424-producing cells, we used an IFN-\u2424 reporter mouse (51) . During IOE infection at day 7 postinfection, IOE-infected IFN-\u2424-yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) mice exhibited an increased number of splenic IFN-\u2424 \u03e9 pDCs, relative to that of mock-infected mice ( Fig. 3B and D) . Taken together, our data demonstrate that pDCs and monocytes are the primary hematopoietic cells that produce IFN-\u2423 and pDCs are producers of IFN-\u2424 during IOE infection.",

As T cells are the major cells that produced TNF-\u2423 during IOE infection (28), we performed intracellular staining for TNF-\u2423 during IOE infection. Both CD4 and CD8 T cells produced more TNF-\u2423 in the absence of Ifnar-mediated signaling during IOE infection ( Fig. 4A and B) . TNF-\u2423 can induce apoptosis during infection (52); thus, we compared apoptosis of leukocyte populations between WT and Ifnar-deficient mice during IOE infection using flow cytometric analysis of annexin V and 7-aminoactinomycin D. WT and Ifnar-deficient mice had similar frequencies of apoptotic and necrotic leukocytes, including T cells, B cells, NK cells, NKT cells, monocytes, macrophages, and neutrophils (data not shown). Thus, in the absence of type I IFNs, increased TNF-\u2423 does not contribute significantly to lethal inflammation, consistent with a mouse model of lethal shock caused by injection of TNF-\u2423, where type I IFNs are required for morbidity (53) .",

The Ehrlichia-specific IgM is also sufficient to protect against IOE infection in a challenge model (36) . Compared to WT mice, we found that Ifnar-deficient mice had increased plasmablasts in the spleen (Fig. 6A and B ). In addition, pathogen-reactive IgM in serum was also increased in the absence of Ifnar-mediated signaling (Fig. 6C) . These data suggest that type I IFNs were able to suppress the generation of plasmablasts and pathogen-specific IgM, resulting in increased susceptibility to IOE infection. Next, to test whether the impaired generation of plasmablasts during IOE infection was due to Ifnar-mediated signal- ing in B cells, we generated mixed BM chimeric mice that contained an equal mixture of WT and Ifnar-deficient BM. After IOE infection, we observed equal frequencies of splenic plasmablasts derived from Ifnar-deficient and WT cells ( Fig. 6D and E) , indicating that intrinsic Ifnar-mediated signaling was not suppressive for plasmablast generation. Because the higher pathogen-specific IgM production in Ifnar-deficient mice correlated with increased IFN-\u2425 production, we next tested whether increased plasmablasts and pathogen-reactive IgM production in Ifnar-deficient mice required IFN-\u2425 signaling. Thus, we treated Ifnar-deficient mice with a neutralizing antibody against IFN-\u2425. Neutralization of IFN-\u2425 resulted in significantly reduced splenic plasmablasts ( Fig. 6F and G) and serum IgM (Fig. 6H) , which was comparable to the levels observed in infected WT mice. These findings demonstrate an important role for IFN-\u2425 in driving expansion of the CD11c lo B220 lo plasmablast population and production of IgM during ehrlichial infection.",

IFN-\u2425 and IgM are important for protection against primary infection with the less virulent strain, E. muris, and are involved in protection against lethal challenge with IOE (33, 34, 36, 43) . To determine whether type I IFN-mediated suppression of IFN-\u2425 and the IFN-\u2425-dependent plasmablast response was responsible for IOE-induced death in WT animals, we neutralized IFN-\u2425 during the course of infection in Ifnar-deficient mice. Unexpectedly, we observed that neutralization of IFN-\u2425 had no impact on bacterial burden in the spleen or lung and did not impair survival (Fig. 7A and B) . Neutralization of IFN-\u2425 was effective as determined by ELISA (Fig. 7C ). In addition, we found that the IFN-\u2425-dependent splenomegaly observed in Ifnar-defi- amine this, we generated reverse BM chimeric mice (WT BM to Ifnar-deficient hosts and Ifnar-deficient BM to WT hosts). After IOE infection, Ifnar-deficient hosts with a WT hematopoietic system survived significantly longer than WT hosts with an Ifnardeficient hematopoietic system (Fig. 8A ). WT hosts with an Ifnardeficient hematopoietic system also had a slightly, but not significantly, higher concentration of serum IFN-\u2425 (Fig. 8B) . We found no difference in serum concentration of IFN-\u2423 between the reverse chimeric mice (Fig. 8C) . However, we noted that IFN-\u2424 concentrations were significantly reduced in chimeric mice where the nonhematopoietic system was WT and the hematopoietic compartment lacked Ifnar. Thus, improved survival is associated with a nonhematopoietic compartment that cannot respond to type I IFNs, despite increased IFN-\u2424 in these mice, and a presumably greater impact of IFN-\u2424 on the nonhematopoietic system. It also suggests that IFN-\u2423R signaling in hematopoietic cells is required for increase IFN-\u2424 production. Although mice with a WT hematopoietic system and Ifnar-deficient nonhematopoietic cells exhibited increased survival, they had a higher bacterial burden in both the spleen and liver (Fig. 8D ). Our data demonstrate that IFN-\u2423R signaling in nonhematopoietic cells is more important in mediating host death during IOE infection than the effects of type I IFNs on the hematopoietic system. Thus, type I IFNs promote shock-like disease during severe ehrlichial disease by targeting nonhematopoietic tissues.",

A possible role for type I IFNs in immunity to ehrlichial infection has not been previously investigated. We demonstrate here that infection with IOE, which causes fatal disease, elicits a robust type I IFN response that contributes to lethality. Type I IFNs exert a variety of immunomodulatory effects on host immune responses, and we found that type I IFNs impaired the production of IFN-\u2425. However, increased IFN-\u2425 was not essential for reduced bacterial burden or increased survival in the Ifnar-deficient mice. This was surprising, as impaired IFN-\u2425 has previously been thought to contribute to severity of disease during IOE infection. In fact, IFN-\u2423R-mediated signaling in the nonhematopoietic system contributed significantly to death during IOE infection. IOE-infected mice die of a toxic shock-like syndrome characterized by extensive liver damage and interstitial pneumonitis (27) . Vascular dysfunction is evident in extremely ill mice, and although the precise mechanism causing death is not clear, lung pathology and liver damage are likely involved. Our data demonstrate for the first time that direct IFN-\u2423R signaling in nonhematopoietic cells, which may include endothelial cells, epithelial cells, or hepatocytes, is critical in causing death in a model of lethal ehrlichiosis. Type I IFNs have been associated with endothelial activation and apoptosis, but the mechanisms underlying these effects, particularly during rickettsial infections, are unclear (55) . Vascular permeability is regulated, in part, by the opening and closing of endothelial tight junctions. It was recently shown that phosphorylation of vascular endothelial (VE) cadherin, a key protein in maintenance of adherens junctions, precedes the increase in endothelial cell permeability in an in vitro model of Rickettsia montanensis infection (56) , supporting the idea that endothelial tight junctions may be dysfunctional during severe ehrlichiosis. Vascular endothelial cell growth factor (VEGF) and the angiopoietin-Tie2 ligand receptor system function to regulate both angiogenesis and microvascular permeability (57) . Angiopoietin 2 (Ang2) contributes to increased expression of intercellular and vascular cell adhesion molecules (ICAM-1 and VCAM-1) on endothelial cells (58) , which promotes recruitment of monocytes and neutrophils. Interestingly, increased Ang2 is observed in anthrax (59), dengue hemorrhagic fever (60) , and severe malaria, all diseases associated with vascular dysfunction and induction of type I IFNs. Future studies are required to address the precise downstream mechanisms by which type I IFN signaling in nonhematopoietic cells contributes to lethal infection and vascular dysfunction during rickettsial infections.",

We believe this finding illustrates the requirement of type I IFNs in driving shocklike disease. Whereas TNF-\u2423 may initiate disease during IOE infection, type I IFNs appear to be necessary for development of the severe toxic shock-like syndrome. This is consistent with a mouse \"n.s.\" indicates no significant difference (P \u03fe 0.05). \"n.d.\" indicates not detectable. For data shown in panels A and C, at least five animals for each group were used. For panel B, at least nine animals for each group were used. model of shock caused by TNF-\u2423 administration. In comparison to WT mice, TNF-\u2423 administration to Ifnar-deficient mice results in reduced levels of proinflammatory cytokines, including interleukin 6 (IL-6), and less apoptosis in the liver (53) . Further supporting this idea is the observation that TNF-R2-mediated signaling in endothelial cells induced the expression of IFN-\u2424, which acted in an autocrine fashion to regulate chemokine expression, thus controlling recruitment of monocytes and macrophages to the endothelium (61). This proinflammatory circuit was shown to drive severe kidney disease in vivo. Thus, type I IFNs may mediate severe disease only in a context where TNF-\u2423 is already present. This experimental finding is supported by the clinical observation that type I IFNs are used frequently for treating hepatitis C virus and some types of cancer, such as melanoma, without causing shock (62, 63) , whereas systemic administration of TNF-\u2423 causes significant toxicity, including liver damage and hypotension (32, 64) . Understanding the relationship between TNF-\u2423 and type I IFNs in driving shock-like disease is likely relevant to other inflammatory diseases, such as sepsis.",

Ehrlichia lacks the genes encoding LPS and PDG; thus, the mechanism driving IFN-\u2423 and IFN-\u2424 production may involve sensing of bacterial nucleic acids. Recognition of nucleic acids depends on membrane-bound receptors, including TLR3, TLR7, and TLR9. We observed production of type I IFNs in the absence of MyD88 and TLR2, suggesting that TLR-mediated signaling is not required for induction of type I IFNs in response to IOE infection. However, it is possible that TLR3 is involved, as it can signal independently of MyD88. Cytosolic receptors, including stimulator of IFN genes (STING), can also sense nucleic acids and appear to be particularly important for type I IFN induction in response to intracellular bacterial infections (65) .

Here, we demonstrate that pDCs and monocytes produce both IFN-\u2423 and IFN-\u2424 during IOE infection. It is not yet clear whether type I IFNs are elicited during IOE infection due to direct pathogen recognition or due to infection-induced damage. Production of type I IFNs by pDCs and monocytes during IOE infection may also involve distinct mechanisms. Identifying the mechanism of IFN induction in response to IOE may reveal novel therapeutic targets for severe rickettsial infections that cause shock-like disease.",

            "text": "We observed improved bacterial clearance in the absence of IFN-\u2423R-mediated signaling, but the precise mechanisms by which type I IFNs impair bacterial clearance are not yet clear. We observed an enhanced IFN-\u2425 response and increased IgM responses in Ifnar-decifient mice, yet these were not required for effective control of bacteria, as a similar bacterial burden was observed upon IFN-\u2425 neutralization. These data were surprising and indicate that a unique IFN-\u2423\u2424-driven pathway impairs ehrlichial clearance. Increased TNF-\u2423 was also observed in the absence of type I IFNs, and it is possible that TNF-\u2423 is essential to control bacterial growth. We made the surprising observation that mortality did not appear to correlate with bacterial burden. In WT mice that contained an Ifnar-deficient hematopoietic system, we observed reduced bacterial burden in both the spleen and liver. However, mice died early, with kinetics similar to those of WT mice. On the other hand, Ifnar-deficient hosts containing WT hematopoietic cells exhibited higher bacterial burdens but prolonged survival. These data suggest that improved survival in the absence of type I IFNs is due, in part, to a reduced damage or a diminished pathogenic inflammatory response. Underscoring the role of type I IFNs in promoting a detrimental inflammatory response, we found that mice lacking TLR2 exhibited significantly increased type I IFNs, relative to WT mice, and TLR2-deficient mice are highly susceptible to IOE (44) . The precise mechanisms by which type I IFNs participate in severe disease require further study and are likely part of a more complex story. Herein, we demonstrate for the first time, to our knowledge, the critical role for type I IFNs in driving severe disease during a rickettsial infection. These findings provide rationale to examine the contribution of type I IFNs to disease in other rickettsial infections and to address the precise mechanisms by which type I IFN signaling in nonhematopoietic cells contribute to severe shock-like disease.",
