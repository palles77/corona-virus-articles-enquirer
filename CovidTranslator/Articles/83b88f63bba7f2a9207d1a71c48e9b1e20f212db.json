The association between serum albumin concentration at the time of listing for lung transplantation and the rate of death after lung transplantation is unknown. We examined 6808 adults who underwent lung transplantation in the United States between 2000 and 2008. We used Cox proportional hazard models and generalized additive models to examine multivariableadjusted associations between serum albumin and the rate of death after transplantation. The median follow-up time was 2.7 years. Those with severe (0.5-2.9 g/dL) and mild hypoalbuminemia (3.0-3.6 g/dL) had posttransplant adjusted mortality rate ratios of 1.35 (95% CI: 1.12-1.62) and 1.15 (95% CI: 1.04-1.27), respectively. For each 0.5 g/dL decrease in serum albumin concentration the 1-year and overall mortality rate ratios were 1.48 (95% CI: 1.21-1.81) and 1.26 (95% CI: 1.11-1.43), respectively. The association between hypoalbuminemia and posttransplant mortality was strongest in recipients with cystic fibrosis and interstitial lung disease. Hypoalbuminemia is an independent risk factor for death after lung transplantation.",

However, a scarce donor supply restricts lung transplantation to only a fraction of potentially eligible patients. Therefore, each transplant center attempts to \"achieve the best use of donated organs\" (3) by carefully selecting candidates with acceptably low predicted postoperative risks of death. While the Lung Allocation Score (LAS) system has improved organ allocation in the United States (4, 5) , recent data suggest that lung transplant recipients are sicker at the time of transplant than in prior years (6) , and that the posttransplant survival measure of the LAS is in fact a poor predictor of posttransplant survival (7) . Novel predictors of posttransplant survival time may improve allocation strategies and foster investigations of risk-reducing interventions.",

We further restricted the cohort to patients with ILD, COPD or CF (which account for more than 80% of lung transplant procedures in the United States) to minimize confounding by diagnosis. We sought to exclude patients with albumin < 0.5 g/ dL (there were none) or albumin levels \u2265 6.0 g/dL (n = 11) because the standard assay for serum albumin, the bromcresol green (BCG) method (26) , is inaccurate outside this range (9) . Recipients with missing serum albumin were also excluded (n = 1607). We excluded 190 recipients receiving mechanical ventilation at the time of transplantation in the primary analysis because we believed it would be a key confounder of the association between serum albumin and the risk of death after lung transplantation, but we included and adjusted for mechanical ventilation in post hoc analyses. After all exclusions, 6808 recipients were included in the primary analysis, of whom, 6435 had 1-year follow-up ( Figure 1 ).",

Figure 4 shows multivariable-adjusted survival curves for categories of serum albumin concentration stratified by diagnosis. Both multivariable-adjusted 1-year and overall survival varied significantly across albumin categories in both CF (p = 0.013 and 0.015) and ILD (p = 0.019 and 0.008) patients, but not in COPD patients (p = 0.144 and 0.140). Hypoalbuminemia was strongly associated with early mortality in CF and ILD recipients: for every 0.5 g/dL decrease in serum albumin the adjusted 1-year mortality rate ratio was 2.28 (95% CI: 1.32-3.96) and 1.40 (95% CI: 1.03-1.90), respectively. In COPD recipients, there was no association found between serum albumin concentration and the overall mortality rate, but for each 0.5 g/dL decrease in serum albumin, the adjusted 1-year mortality rate ratio increased 1.38 (95% CI: 1.01-1.90) ( Table 3 ).",

The concentration of albumin in serum is determined by the balance between its synthesis in the liver and its catabolism by the vascular endothelium (11, 14) . Hypoalbuminemia can therefore be a result of reduced synthesis due to liver disease and protein malnutrition, enhanced catabolism due to inflammation or to renal loss (11, 14, 19) . Since liver and kidney disease are rare among waitlisted lung transplant candidates, malnutrition and systemic inflammation are likely responsible for hypoalbuminemia in this population, and might lead to a higher risk of death by predisposing to infection and lung inflammation, or perhaps by contributing to a state of reduced physiologic reserve (frailty). Systemic inflammation is a primary cause of age-related muscle loss (sarcopenia), which is associated with hypoalbuminemia (35, 36) . Sarcopenia and its related clinical phenotype of frailty have been shown to predict complications after general surgery and mortality after liver transplantation (37, 38) . Future investigations that focus on identifying other measures of sarcopenia and frailty in patients listed for lung transplantation have promise to improve lung allocation and outcomes after lung transplantation.",

While the hazard ratios for early mortality among those with severe hypoalbuminemia were notably lower for participants with COPD compared to those with ILD (1.27 and 1.48, respectively), the hazard ratios for albumin as a continuous variable were almost identical for these two groups (1.38 and 1.40, respectively) and were statistically significant. The reasons for this discrepancy is not clear, but may be a result of the smaller number of COPD participants with severe hypoalbuminemia (n = 71), the arbitrary thresholds separating albumin categories, and/or differences in the influences of systemic inflammation and nutritional status on albumin levels between participants with and without COPD. Elevated serum albumin concentrations (5.1-5.9 g/dL) were detected in 73 (1.1%) recipients and multivariable adjusted mortality rate ratios ranged from 1.14 to 1.50, but neither association was statistically significant. It is likely that serum albumin was misclassified in some of these cases. For example, total protein may have been recorded instead of albumin. Accordingly, patients with low total protein concentrations between 5.1 g/dL and 5.9 g/dL will likely also be hypoalbuminemic and therefore have a higher posttransplant mortality. Elevated albumin is most often associated with severe dehydration, which is unlikely at the time of transplant listing because patients are already receiving care from many healthcare providers. Severe vitamin A deficiency is associated with elevated serum albumin (42), and CF patients are at risk for fat-soluble vitamin deficiencies due to fat malabsorption. However, only three CF recipients had elevated serum albumin at the time of transplant listing, and such severe vitamin A deficiency seems unlikely given these patients are receiving medical care.",

Interlaboratory variation in the measurement of serum albumin concentration is unlikely, since a standard assay, the BCG method (9, 26) , is used for the measurement of serum albumin. Second, serum albumin was recorded at the time of listing for lung transplantation rather than at the time of transplantation. It is likely that the serum albumin at transplantation differed from that at the time of listing, since these events were a median of 5 months apart, thereby misclassifying albumin for many study participants. Since it is likely that this error is independent of the risk of death after transplantation, we would expect such misclassification to bias toward the null. If so, our results may underestimate the true association between serum albumin and the risk of death after transplantation. Prospective studies with attention to the timing of albumin measurement may provide additional information about the predictive validity of serum albumin in this setting. Third, inclusion of imprecisely measured confounders and failure to include unmeasured confounders in our models could have contributed to some or all of the associations we observed. Our findings, however, were independent of important potential confounders such as diagnosis, BMI, diabetes, corticosteroid use, donor characteristics and procedural characteristics. Nevertheless, residual confounding by other factors cannot be entirely excluded.",
