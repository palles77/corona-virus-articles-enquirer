            "text": "Protein kinase R (PKR) plays a major role in activating host immunity during infection 25 by sensing dsRNA produced by viruses. Once activated by dsRNA, PKR phosphorylates the 26 translation factor eIF2\u03b1, halting cellular translation. Many viruses have methods of inhibiting 27 PKR activation or its downstream effects, circumventing protein synthesis shutdown. These 28 include sequestering dsRNA or producing proteins that bind to and inhibit PKR activation. Here 29 we describe our finding that in multiple cell types, PKR was depleted during mouse adenovirus 30 type 1 (MAV-1) infection. MAV-1 did not appear to be targeting PKR at a transcriptional or 31 translational level because total PKR mRNA levels and levels of PKR mRNA bound to 32 polysomes were unchanged or increased during MAV-1 infection. However, inhibiting the 33 proteasome reduced the PKR depletion seen in MAV-1-infected cells, whereas inhibiting the 34 lysosome had no effect. This suggests that proteasomal degradation alone is responsible for PKR 35 degradation during MAV-1 infection. Time course experiments indicate that the degradation 36 occurs early after infection. Infecting cells with UV-inactivated virus prevented PKR 37 degradation, whereas inhibiting viral DNA replication did not. Together these results suggest that 38 an early viral gene is responsible. Degradation of PKR is a rare mechanism to oppose PKR 39 activity, and it has only been described in six RNA viruses. To our knowledge, this is the first 40 example of a DNA virus counteracting PKR by degrading it. 41 42 Importance 43",

There are two 116 categories of PKR -/-MEFs derived from knockout mice: N-PKR -/-MEFs and C-PKR -/-MEFs 117 (52). The PKR -/-MEFs derived from mice created in the Weissmann lab (53) are designated N-118 PKR -/-MEFs, because the C-terminal fragment of PKR is still expressed and can be detected by 119 immunoblot when there is IFN induction (52). The fragment has the kinase catalytic activity of 120 PKR, but it does not bind dsRNA (52). The PKR -/-MEFs derived from mice created in the Bell 121 lab (54) are designated as C-PKR -/-MEFs, because the N-terminal fragment of PKR is still 122 expressed and can be detected by immunoblot with specific PKR antibodies (52). The fragment 123 is catalytically inactive, but it can still bind dsRNA (52).

The fraction remaining at 72 hpi in K271R SV40-MEFs suggests that the upper band of the PKR doublet usually seen in wild-type 161 cells is a phospho-PKR band, because only the lower band of the PKR doublet is seen in kinase-162 dead mutant K271R SV40-MEFs.

C57BL/6 MEFs were mock infected or infected at 187 an MOI of 5, and lysates were collected at 48 hpi in the presence of cycloheximide to keep the 188 mRNA bound to the ribosomes (56). Lysates were centrifuged through 25% sucrose to pellet 189 ribosomes, and RNA was purified from the pellets. The purified RNAs were used to generate 190 cDNA, which we assayed for PKR mRNA by qPCR. As a control for pelleting of ribosomes, we 191 assayed the pellets and sucrose cushion supernatants by immunoblot with antibodies to 192 ribosomal protein RPL7. We confirmed that RPL7 was only present in the pellets and not the 193 supernatants (Fig. S2 ). There was no significant difference between the amount of PKR mRNA 194 in the ribosome pellet of mock infected lysates compared to MAV-1-infected lysates (Fig. 4A) . 195 196 To confirm the results seen in total mRNA bound to ribosomes, we also centrifuged cell 197 extracts on sucrose gradients to generate polysome profiles. This enabled us to analyze levels of 198 PKR mRNA associated with actively-translating ribosomes during infection. C57BL/6 MEFs 199 were mock infected or infected at an MOI of 2, and lysates were collected at 24 hpi in the 200 presence of cycloheximide, as above.

RNA was purified from fractions containing monosomes and polysomes and then used to 205 generate cDNA, which we assayed for PKR mRNA by qPCR (Fig. 4C) . As a control, GAPDH 206 mRNA was measured by qPCR, and PKR mRNA levels in each fraction were normalized to the 207 GAPDH mRNA content. When the data for percentage of PKR mRNA bound to ribosomes was 208 pooled into monosome and polysome fractions and analyzed (Fig. 4D) , 90.1% and 91.8% were 209 bound to polysomes (fractions 7-19) for mock and infected samples, respectively, compared to 210 9.9% and 8.2% bound to monosomes (fractions 1-6).

To determine whether MAV-1 depletes PKR by either protein degradation 229 pathway, we first assayed whether PKR is lysosomally degraded as follows. CMT93 cells were 230 mock infected or infected with MAV-1 and treated at the time of infection with the lysosome 231 inhibitors ammonium chloride or chloroquine, or water (as a control). At 24 hpi, we collected 232 lysates and analyzed them by immunoblot with antibodies to PKR. In the presence of the 233 lysosomal degradation inhibitors, PKR was depleted by 24 hpi (Fig. 5A) , indicating that 234 lysosomal degradation was not the cause of PKR depletion during MAV-1 infection. We 235 confirmed that the inhibitor treatment did block lysosomal degradation by incubating cells with 236 dye-quenched bovine serum albumin (DQ BSA) in addition to the lysosomal inhibitors. DQ BSA 237 is self-quenched until it is digested in the lysosome (59, 60), and imaging confirmed that cells 238 treated with lysosome inhibitors did not fluoresce, but cells treated with the vehicle control 239 (H 2 O) did, as expected (Fig. 5B) . 240 241 Next, we examined whether proteasomal degradation is responsible for the degradation of 242 PKR by using proteasome inhibitors MG132 and bortezomib. These inhibit proteasome activity 243 by binding to the active sites in the 20S subunit and blocking the proteolytic activity (61-63). We 244 mock infected or infected C57BL/6 MEFs with MAV-1 and treated with MG132 or bortezomib 245 in DMSO at the time of infection. At 24 hpi, we collected lysates and analyzed them by 246 immunoblot for PKR protein levels. While PKR was depleted in the control DMSO-treated 247 MAV-1-infected cells as expected, PKR protein was present in the MG132-and bortezomib-248 treated cells at levels comparable to mock infected cells ( Fig. 6A and B ). To rule out the 249 possibility that PKR was present (not depleted) because the virus infection itself was inhibited by 250 MG132 or bortezomib, we assayed viral replication of MAV-1 with MG132 and bortezomib 251 treatment by qPCR of viral DNA. Viral replication was equivalent in all three treatment groups 252 ( Fig. S4) , indicating that the treatments did not affect the ability of the virus to productively 253 infect the cells. Taken together, these data indicate that MAV-1 infection results in PKR 254 depletion by causing PKR to be degraded by the proteasome during infection. 255",

We also found that the 5' UTR of mouse PKR 371 This indicates that PKR is not degraded by lysosomal degradation during viral infection, but by 378 proteasomal degradation. Though PKR degradation was due to proteasome activity during 379 MAV-1 infection, we were unable to demonstrate PKR ubiquitination, although we did detect 380 ubiquitination of mouse p53 (Fig. S5 ). This inability to demonstrate PKR ubiquitination could be 381 explained if at any given moment there were only low levels of ubiquitinated PKR present in the 382 cell. Perhaps, increasing the time under MG132 treatment could increase the amounts of 383 ubiquitinated proteins enough so that PKR ubiquitination could be seen. However, our inability 384 to detect ubiquitinated PKR is consistent with a similar inability to identify PKR ubiquitination 385 by RVFV NSs, even though NSs is known to recruit an E3 ligase to PKR (32). Alternatively, it is 386 possible that in MAV-1 infection, PKR is degraded in a ubiquitin-independent manner, possibly 387 because of intrinsic disordered regions of PKR or binding of regulating proteins to PKR that 388 target proteins to the proteasome (74, 75). 389 .

Ongoing 390 experiments are focused on determining the MAV-1 early protein(s) responsible for PKR 391 degradation. Two possibilities are E4 proteins, the homologs of hAd E4orf6 and E4orf3, which 392 we originally termed E4orfa/b and E4orfa/c, respectively (76). In human adenovirus, E4orf6 393 interacts with another early hAd protein, E1B 55K, to participate in an E3 ligase complex that 394 ubiquitinates and degrades p53 via proteasomal degradation (77, 78). When MAV-1 E4orf6, 395 E1B 55K, and mouse p53 are introduced by transfection into human cells, all three proteins 396 interact and mouse p53 is degraded (66). If MAV-1 E4orf6 and E1B 55K form a similar complex 397 in mouse cells, it may also degrade PKR. We have preliminary evidence that mouse p53 is 398 ubiquitinated in C57BL/6 MEFs during MAV-1 infection, which suggests that the mouse p53 399 degradation seen in human cells could be paralleled by degradation of endogenous mouse p53 400 and mouse PKR in mouse cells, mediated by MAV-1 E4orf6 and E1B 55K during infection. 401",

PKR is not detectably ubiquitinated during MAV-1 infection. CMT93 cells were transfected with a GFP-ubiquitin plasmid using standard Polyplus transfection protocols. At 24 hpt, the cells were infected with MAV-1 (MAV) at an MOI of 5 or mock infected (mock) and treated with 10 \u00b5M MG132 at 6 hpi. Cell lysates were collected at 12 hpi and immunoprecipitated with (A) PKR (D-20) or an isotype control antibody or (B) p53 (DO-1) or an isotype control antibody. Immunoprecipitated samples were analyzed by immunoblot with GFP, ubiquitin, isotype, PKR (B-10), or p53 (1801) The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the author/funder.

Comparing the results from MAV-1 infection 281 (Fig. 7A top, and 7B) and cycloheximide treatment of uninfected cells (Fig. 7A bottom, and 7B), 282 we conclude that MAV-1 was actively depleting PKR protein early in infection. E1A was 283 detected by immunoblot at 18 hpi (Fig. 7C), whereas viral DNA replication was first detected at 284 24 hpi in CMT93 cells (Fig. S6). Thus the 18 hpi timepoint is considered an early time point 285 during MAV-1 infection of CMT93 cells, prior to DNA replication, suggesting the involvement 286 of an early viral protein in PKR depletion. 287 288 An early viral function is required for PKR depletion by MAV-1 289 To determine whether viral gene expression or DNA replication are required for PKR 290 degradation during infection, we infected C57BL/6 MEFs and CMT93 cells with UV-inactivated 291 MAV-1 (which does not replicate viral DNA, Fig. S7). We infected cells at an MOI of 10 with 292 WT MAV-1 or UV-inactivated MAV-1 and analyzed lysates from 24 and 48 hpi by immunoblot 293 for PKR protein levels. In both cell types, while PKR was degraded by 24 hpi in the cells 294 infected with WT MAV-1, PKR protein levels were unaffected at both time points in cells 295infected with UV-inactivated MAV-1(Fig. 8A).

For example, p53 is capable of binding to the PKR promoter and inducing its 351 expression (73), but MAV-1 proteins cause p53 proteolysis (66). Together our results in 352 C57BL/6 MEFs and macrophages suggest the virus does not cause PKR protein depletion by 353 reducing PKR steady-state mRNA levels. 354 355 The differences in total PKR mRNA levels during infection between C57BL/6 MEFs and 356 primary peritoneal macrophages (Fig. 3) is possibly due to the fact that macrophages are an 357 immune cell, while MEFs are not. PKR protein took almost 3 times as long to be completely 358 degraded during infection in macrophages compared to MEFs (72 hours versus 24 hours) (Fig. 3592A). Total PKR mRNA levels were 2 to 3 times higher in MAV-1-infected macrophages 360 compared to mock infected macrophages, unlike the MEFs where total PKR mRNA levels were 361 unchanged or reduced 33-40% during MAV-1-infection compared to mock infected MEFs. Since 362 PKR is an IFN-stimulated gene (1, 2), higher levels of total PKR mRNA seen during infection in 363 the macrophages suggests IFN induction. This suggests that the immune response mounted by 364 the macrophages was greater than the immune response in the MEFs, and could help explain 365 why PKR took longer to degrade in macrophages compared to MEFs.",
