Other than age at the time of infection, the causes and correlates of severe illness in infants lacking known risk factors are poorly defined. We recruited a cohort of confirmed RSV-infected infants and simultaneously assayed the presence of resident airway microbiota and the molecular status of their airways using a novel method. Rigorous statistical analyses identified a molecular airway gene expression signature of severe illness dominated by excessive chemokine expression. Global 16S rRNA sequencing confirmed an association between H. influenzae and clinical severity. Interestingly, adjusting for H. influenzae in our gene expression analysis revealed an association between severity and airway lymphocyte accumulation. Exploring the relationship between airway gene expression and the time of onset of clinical symptoms revealed a robust, acute activation of interferon (IFN) signaling, which was absent in subjects with severe illness. Finally, we explored the relationship between IFN activity, airway gene expression and productive RSV infection using a novel in vitro model of bona fide pediatric human airway epithelial cells. Interestingly, blocking IFN signaling, but not IFN ligand production, in these cells leads to increased viral infection. Our data reveal that acute airway interferon responses are physiologically relevant in the context of infant RSV infection and may be a target for therapeutic intervention. Additionally, the airway gene expression signature we define may be useful as a biomarker for efficacy of intervention responses. All rights reserved. No reuse allowed without permission.",

Although other taxa were associated with airway gene expression, we were somewhat surprised to find no other OTUs were significantly associated with severity. It is worth knowing, 16S ribosomal RNA sequencing was not able to identify S. pneumoniae at the species level. Given our prior studies revealing a large impact of the microbiota upon gene expression in the airway, we studied the inter-relationships between the airway microbiome, airway gene expression and clinical severity. In general, these analyses confirmed that the existence of known pathogens, particularly bacteria, are strongly associated with gene expression in asymptomatic 35, 47 and symptomatic 47 infants. We considered the specific effect of the microbiota/H. flu on the relationship between gene expression and RSV severity. The results are consistent with H. flu altering the nature of the inflammatory response, from myeloid-predominant to CD4/8 T lymphocyte-predominant. These data provide a currently untested hypothesis for a potential mechanism whereby H. influenzae contributes to severe responses at the molecular and cellular level, which is a focus of current investigation.",

Critically, we have applied appropriately conservative corrections for multiple testing in each case. We believe that use of each of these analytical approaches is justified, as they each provide distinct yet important insight. Univariate analyses are used to estimate the direct associations between one covariate and individual genes. These analyses are easy to perform and interpret and do not suffer from potential collinearity issues among covariates. As such, they are useful to initially explore the overall pattern of associations between clinical covariates and transcriptome profiles. On the other hand, a multivariate model considers the influence of several covariates on gene expression simultaneously; therefore, the estimated association between the response variable and a given covariate is less likely to be affected by unmodeled interdependences. Arguably, a multivariate model is more natural than multiple univariate models because it more closely approximates the complex biological processes that collectively influence the transcriptome. That being said, more caution must be exercised when using complex multivariate models. When uninformative covariates are included in a multivariate model, they may mask true associations and reduce the statistical power to detect informative associations.

We have focused our efforts in identifying gene expression responses that distinguish infants severely affected by RSV infection as compared to infants who are not severely ill and have not included noninfected controls. Therefore, we are unable to address the specificity of the responses we observe and report. Other studies by our group (Storch and unpublished) suggest that responses to any viral infection can be identified but occur at a much smaller magnitude than those described here. Another limitation is the associative nature of most of the data presented. One must use caution and resist presuming that the in vivo correlative observations we report are mechanistic, rather than hypothesis generating. In some cases, we were able to show a mechanistic relationship between specific genes/pathway and the magnitude of viral infection (Fig. 5) . Importantly, this in vitro model provides a physiologically relevant system to further pursue mechanistic hypotheses resulting from analysis of our in vivo data.

A circos plot displays signaling pathway ontologies associated with severity (a.) Shown are a subset of genes with expression patterns significantly associated (FDR<0.05, fold change>1.5) with time since onset of clinical symptoms in a multivariate model, and key signaling pathway ontologies significantly associated with severity (n=692 genes, FDR<0.05). Pseudo-time series plots (b.) display gene expression patterns for key interferon signaling pathway genes significantly associated with the time since onset of clinical symptoms. IFIT1, MX1",

Infection of primary cultures of human lung epithelial (PHLE) cells differentiated at air-liquid interface with RSV emulates some gene expression responses associated with severity. (a.) Shown is a heat plot displaying relative expression for a set of genes significantly associated with the global respiratory severity score (GRSS) 48 hours after apical infection with RSV or in sham-infected controls (CTL). Also shown are box plots for multiplex ELISA for key immune mediators confirming increased production of CCL7 and IL6 following infection. (b.) Shown are the effects of RSV infection while treated with interferon ligand alone (RSV+IFN), interferon signaling inhibitor ruximitinib alone (RUX; RSV+R) or the two together (RSV+R+IFN). IFN treatment blocks the number and size of infection plaques, as well as the production of viral transcript, while blocking IFN signaling is sufficient to potentiate infection. (c.) Box plots for the expression of interferon signaling genes that are significantly associated with GRSS (IFIT1, MX1, RSAD2) shows their expression are increased by RSV infection and/or IFN treatment, but not in the presence of RUX.
