            "text": "Despite advances in peripartum care, maternal morbidity and mortality associated with infections in pregnancy are increasing even in developed countries. Recently published data 1,2 from the Center for Disease Control's Pregnancy Mortality Surveillance System indicates that although maternal mortality from hemorrhage, embolism, and anesthesia has declined in the United States, the proportion of maternal deaths due to infections has increased. During 1991-7 infection accounted for 13.2% of pregnancy-related deaths overall and 36.3% of abortion-related deaths. The greatest infection risk is found in blacks, older women, women without prenatal care, 1 and women with multiple pregnancy. 2 In the United States pregnancy rates are stable or increasing in these groups. 3 Infection is also a major cause of morbidity and mortality for the fetus and newborn. Many perinatal infections are associated with intra-uterine growth retardation and low birthweight, or cause fetal and neonatal brain injury. 4 Infections, particularly bacterial vaginosis and chorioamnionitis, can result in preterm delivery of live-born infants (delivery before 37 weeks gestation), or stillbirth. Evidence of intra-uterine infection has been reported in up to 70% of spontaneous births occurring at less than 30 weeks gestation, and 30-40% after that time. 5 Notably, the rate of preterm birth in developed countries is rising, and in the United States increased from 9.5% in 1981, to 12.7% in 2005. 6 In developed countries, infections due to Treponema pallidum (syphilis), Toxoplasma gondii, Listeria monocytogenes, parvovirus B19, HIV, group B streptococcus, Mycoplasma spp., Ureaplasma urealyticum, Chlamydia trachomatis, and other organisms associated with chorioamnionitis may cause stillbirth in up to 15% of pregnancies overall, with the greatest risk earlier in pregnancy. Among stillbirths at less than 28 weeks gestation, infection was estimated to be the cause in 19%, in comparison with 8% for stillbirths between 28 and 36 weeks, and 2% for stillbirths at more than 37 weeks. 7 In the United States fetal mortality rates for less than 28 weeks gestation, the period most likely to be associated with infection, have not declined since 1990, and the 2003 rate (3.21/1000 live births \ue031 fetal deaths) was even greater than the 1985 rate (2.01/1000). Black women were at the highest risk. The highest rate, 13.9/1000 live births plus fetal deaths, occurred in black women. 8 Globally, the World Health Organization estimates that perinatally acquired infection is responsible for more than 25% of deaths in newborns. 9",

In a normal pregnancy, the maternal immune system must allow implantation and subsequent development of a fetal 'hemi-allograft'. When evaluating and the regulatory role of cells of the innate immune system, such as monocytes, 13 NK cells, 12, 15 and dendritic cells. 16 Treg cells, which can inhibit allograft rejection, antitumor response, and contribute to persistence of intracellular pathogens such as Leishmania, express the CD25 cell marker. The number of circulating maternal Tregs increases throughout pregnancy, then slowly declines postpartum. Increased numbers of CD4 \ue031 CD25 \ue031 Treg cells are found in human maternal decidua, possibly in response to increased progesterone or other pregnancy hormones. 14 Changes in the NK cell population also occur early, by the 12th week of pregnancy, and much earlier than the Th2 shift, which is more apparent in the third trimester. The 'type 1 to type 2 shift' in the NK cell population is evidenced by changes in cell markers including decreased IL-18 receptor expression, increased ST2L expression, and by decreased IFN-\ue067 production; 12 the type 2, IL-10-producing but IFN-\ue067nonproducing 'NK2' cells are increased. 15 A regulatory NK cell population important for allograft tolerance has recently been described, and there appears to be a similar role for regulatory NK cells in protecting the fetus. A unique, immunosuppressive population of regulatory NK cells has been reported in the uterus of pregnant women. These cells are recruited to the endometrium from the peripheral blood, and proliferate and differentiate to TGF-\ue062-producing, immunosuppressive NK3 cells in the decidual microenvironment. These cells have an inhibitory receptor that recognizes placentally expressed class I antigens such as HLA-C, HLA-G, and HLA-E, to inhibit maternal NK cell activity. 15 A shift in pregnancy to favor 'type 2' responses can also be demonstrated in circulating dendritic cells, and in monocytes and granulocytes. In pregnancy, CD86\ue031, HLA-DR\ue031 dendritic cells are decreased in the third trimester, and are biased to secrete IL-10 rather than IL-12, favoring a Th2 phenotype. 16 Monocytes and granulocytes, which are the primary effector cells of the innate immune system, increase in number beginning in the first trimester, and have an activated phenotype, as demonstrated in vitro by enhanced phagocytosis and respiratory burst activity. Monocyte expression of the endotoxin receptor CD14 is increased, as is the endotoxin-induced production of IL-12. 13 In late gestation, monocytes and granulocytes concentrate in the decidua, and increase production of cytokines. Cytokine expression is further increased in labor, and may act to promote labor. The underlying activation of granulocytes and monocytes, and their potential enhanced cytokine response to microbial pathogens, may explain the association between infection and preterm birth.",

These cytokines include the immunosuppressive, Th2-enhancing cytokines IL-4 24 and IL-10, 25 plus TGF-\ue062, 26, 27 which enhances generation of Tregs and alternative activation of monocytes. TGF-\ue0621 has been found in amniotic fluid, and at increased levels in the blood of women between 21 and 36 weeks gestation. 28 Placentally produced cytokines that support monocyte activation include macrophage colony-stimulating factor, vascular endothelial growth factor, and pregnancy-specific glycoproteins such as PSG1a. 29 Later in pregnancy, increased placental production of progesterone, estradiol, corticotrophin-releasing hormone, human placental lactogen, and other pregnancy-related hormones further contributes to the systemic Th1 to Th2 shift and to enhancement of the monocyte response (reviewed in Sacks 13 ). The placenta also sheds syncytiothrophoblast debris, including subcellular microparticles that are released into the maternal circulation. In co-culture experiments, these microparticles stimulate PBMCs through monocyte and dendritic cell uptake, resulting in production of TNF\ue061 and IL-12, but minimal IL-18 or IFN-\ue067, and promoting the type 2 bias. 12 Pregnancy-associated tissues, such as amniotic epithelial cells, decidual inflammatory cells, and placenta express toll-like receptors (TLRs), particularly TLR2, TLR4, 30 and TLR3. 31 The TLRs are pattern-recognition receptors that recognize repeating sequences on the surface of microorganisms. Expression of TLRs is inhibited by estrogen and enhanced by higher progesterone levels. Some evidence suggests that TLR2 expression is altered in placental samples in acute chorioamnionitis. 32 In cultures of cells derived from normal first-trimester trophoblast, cross-linking of TLR4 promotes cytokine expression, but ligation of TLR2 results in apoptotic cell death. One interpretation is that stimulation through TLRs could be a way in which intra-uterine infections lead to preterm labor, intra-uterine growth retardation, spontaneous abortion, and preeclampsia. 33 However, data regarding the role of these receptors in the context of pregnancy are still limited.",

            "text": "In pregnancy, increased levels of the steroid hormones cortisol, estrogen, and, in particular, progesterone, are found locally in the uterus and placenta and in the circulation. 34 These pregnancy-associated steroids modulate the generation, survival, and activity of various immune cells. Most of the available data come from murine models. In mice, pregnancy steroids induce thymic involution, marked by shrinkage of the cortex with loss of CD4 \ue031 CD8\ue031 cells, and concurrent expansion of the medulla with production of Th2 cells (reviewed by Clarke and Kendall 35 ). Progesterone has a major influence on lymphocyte production, acting through intracellular receptors in thymic epithelium, 36 and by downregulating production of B cells in the bone marrow. 37 Steroid hormones also decrease the number of circulating lymphocytes by inducing apoptotic cell death. Although there is limited direct evidence from human pregnancy, similar effects have been described in many other animals, suggesting these mechanisms are conserved. 38 Glucocorticoids and progesterone influence the function of T lymphocytes by stimulating IL-4 and IL-10, but suppressing IFN-\ue067 and IL-12 production. 39, 40 In vitro, progesterone can influence even established Th1 clones to shift to produce Th2 cytokines. 41 Progesterone also acts indirectly by stimulation of progesterone-responsive tissues to produce P-induced blocking factor (PIBF), which induces production of the Th2 cytokines, leukemia inhibitory factor, and M-CSF, increases B cell antibody production, suppresses NK function, inhibits cytotoxicity by blocking degranulation and perforin release, and inhibits transformation into lymphocyteactivated killer cells. 42, 43 Progesterone acts on the uterus to enhance homing of NK cells, and upregulates placental expression of HLA-G and TLRs. 33 Estrogens contribute to modulation of the immune response by stimulating proliferation of a different cell population, the CD4 \ue031 CD25\ue031 Treg cells. 44 The steroid hormones also promote alternative activation of monocytes, and the shift towards antigen presentation and immune tolerance. 18 The impact of the changes in immune response due to progesterone and estrogen has been shown in several models. Pregnancy-related sex steroids have been shown to influence susceptibility to infection with Listeria monocytogenes and Toxoplasma gondii (reviewed by Roberts et al. 45 ). In rodent models, higher estrogen levels or estrogen treatment increased susceptibility to Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Mycoplasma hominis, and Ureaplasma urealyticum. 46, 47 In mice, progesterone administration increases mortality from infection with herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2). In rats, progesterone treatment before infection with Chlamydia trachomatis increases susceptibility to uterine infection, and prevents clearance of the organism resulting in a persistent infection; concurrent estrogen treatment limited the degree of inflammatory response. 48 oTher pregnancy-relaTed hormoneS In addition to steroid hormones, a number of placental products including corticotrophin-releasing hormone, human chorionic gonadotropin, and human placental lactogen can also suppress lymphocyte function, and activate monocytes. 13 Prolactin, which increases during pregnancy, helps suppress cell-mediated immunity, augments B cell function and survival, in part through modulation of Th2 cytokines, and helps to mediate the effects of estrogen. 49 A relationship between prolactin levels and susceptibility to parasitic infections, particularly malaria, has been proposed.",

Non-insulin-dependent and gestational diabetes both occur with greater frequency in non-whites. 50 Underlying hepatitis B infection has been reported as a risk for development of gestational DM even in women with low weight and body mass. 51 In pregnancy, circulating insulin antagonists including cortisol, prolactin, human placental lactogen, and leptin contribute to increased insulin resistance, with worsening of preexisting diabetes. Medical complications including infection are more frequent in pregnant women with diabetes, although most risk occurs in women with preexisting diabetes. 52 Overall, there is a four-fold increased risk of infection pre-and post-partum in insulin-dependent diabetic pregnant women. 53 Examples of increased risk include colonization and infection with group B streptococcus and post-cesarean wound infections. 54, 55 Unfortunately, the older literature does not always clearly distinguish between risk for pregnant women with preexisting DM and risk in women without DM prior to pregnancy, and increased risk cannot always be extrapolated for gestational diabetes. For example, solely gestational DM may not represent an increased risk for perinatal infection with group B streptococcus. 56 By contrast, the risk of urinary tract infection, particularly due to Gram-positive organisms, is increased in pregnant women with both preexisting and gestational DM. The frequency of urinary tract infections is decreased by good glucose control. 57 The risk of periodontal disease is also increased in all diabetic pregnant women, with a rate of 4.8% to 9.0% in gestational diabetes, and an even higher prevalence of 30.5% in women with preexisting diabetes. 58 physiologic changes uTerine decidual and SyncyTioTrophoblaST producTion of ido The amino acid tryptophan appears to be an important proliferation signal for T lymphocytes.

After 20 weeks gestation, pyelonephritis is a common complication of UTI due to ureteral obstruction and urinary stasis. Dilatation of the ureters in response to hormonal changes such as increased progesterone, or possibly to estrogen or relaxin, is apparent in some women as early as the 7th week of gestation. Hormonal factors also cause decreased ureteral peristalsis, which may progress to intermittent atony in later pregnancy. Additional mechanical dilation of the ureters occurs in mid-and late pregnancy due to the enlarging uterus. The dilated ureters may contain over 200 ml of urine. 62 Dextro-rotation of the uterus places the right kidney at greater risk. 63 The vast majority of UTI are caused by Escherichia coli, although Gram-positive pathogens are increased in women with DM.

Although these changes are not thought to increase the risk of contracting pneumonia, a decreased respiratory reserve increases the risk of respiratory failure and complications for mother and fetus. 66 Respiratory compromise from pneumonia decreases the maternal ability to meet the increased oxygen requirements needed to support a fetus. Additionally, the increased minute ventilation in pregnancy leads to a decreased PaCO 2 with a compensatory decreased serum bicarbonate (compensated respiratory alkalosis). As a consequence, even slight CO 2 retention is poorly tolerated, and may contribute to increased maternal morbidity and mortality from pneumonia, particularly during the third trimester. 67 In addition, the compensatory decrease in serum bicarbonate increases vulnerability to metabolic acidosis from sepsis or other causes.",

Pyelonephritis is more likely in the second and third trimesters, but over 20% of cases occur in the first trimester. 73 Symptoms include fever and flank tenderness, often accompanied by rigors, nausea, vomiting, and costovertebral angle pain and tenderness, usually associated with pyuria. In pregnant women, pyelonephritis may be complicated by preterm labor, septic shock or acute respiratory distress syndrome, 70 possibly reflecting an increased sensitivity to endotoxin in pregnancy. Pulmonary injury is most likely to occur in sicker patients who have tachycardia and high fever, in cases of fluid overload, or when beta-agonists are given for tocolysis. 74 In a recent prospective series, pulmonary insufficiency occurred in 7% of pregnant women with pyelonephritis. 73 In general, pregnant women with pyelonephritis should be hospitalized for initial management, and monitored for development of these complications. Initial treatment should include intravenous antimicrobials and careful intravenous hydration, with modification of therapy based on culture results. Suggested initial regimens are listed in Table 47 .4. Over 70% of infections are caused by E. coli. Gram-positive organisms, particularly group B streptococcus increase in importance in later pregnancy, and in some series cause more than 10% of infections in later pregnancy. 73 Penicillin, ampicillin or amoxicillin should be used for treatment of infections caused by group B streptococci. Group B streptococci remain susceptible to penicillin, and testing is not needed except in cases of penicillin allergy, when susceptibility to clindamycin and erythromycin should be determined. By contrast, resistance in Gramnegative organisms is increasing, particularly to ampicillin and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole. A review of 3871 urine culture isolates from women aged 16-45 years collected from July 2005 through June 2008 in our Hospital Center indicated that \ue02e90% of enterococcal isolates were susceptible to ampicillin, and \ue02e84% of S. aureus isolates were methicillin-susceptible. By contrast, susceptibility of E. coli was only 53% to ampicillin, 70% to cephalothin and (Table 47 .5). Susceptibilities of isolates collected specifically from patients in obstetrics/gynecology locations were similar to those for isolates from all women aged 16-45 years, with the exception that enterococcal isolates were 100% ampicillin-susceptible, and E. coli isolates were 100% susceptible to nitrofurantoin. Because GFR is increased by 30-50% in pregnancy, doses of some drugs such as aminoglycosides and ceftriaxone must be adjusted accordingly; 75 for aminoglycosides, serum drug levels are helpful. Other agents, such as cefazolin, do not require dose adjustment. Nitrofurantoin should not be used in pyelonephritis, as it has limited parenchymal penetration.",

Reports of endometritis after medical abortion are very rare, and endometritis or genital tract infection have been reported in fewer than 0.013% of women treated with mifespristone. 102 Reports linking toxic shock syndrome and infection with Clostridium sordellii and Clostridium perfringens after medical abortion 103,104 now appear to be linked to impairment of local innate immunity due to intravaginal use of the prostaglandin E2-pharmacomimetic misoprostol, but not to mifespristone. 105 When endometritis is suspected, a pelvic examination should be performed and aerobic cultures obtained from the endocervical canal. Blood cultures may be positive in up to 20% of women. 99 In post-cesarean infections, initial treatment should include coverage for anaerobic organisms in addition to aerobic Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, then modified based on culture results. Based on a meta-analysis of 39 clinical trials, the preferred regimen is clindamycin 900 mg plus gentamicin 1.5 mg/kg intravenously every 8 hours. 94 Clindamycin 2700 mg plus gentamicin 5 mg/kg intravenously as a single daily dose has been shown to be equally effective. 106 When fever persists after 48 hours, or enterococcal infection is suspected, addition of ampicillin 2 g intravenously every 6 hours or vancomycin is recommended. 107 Once the patient is afebrile, further treatment with oral antibiotics does not appear necessary. Persistence of fever and discomfort after 48 hours may signal the presence of a focus requiring debridement or drainage, such as pelvic abscess or an infected hematoma, or the presence of pelvic thrombophlebitis. Computerized tomography of the pelvis can be helpful in identifying these complications.",

In a small percentage, mastitis is complicated by breast abscess or recurrent mastitis. Risk factors for mastitis include older maternal age, fatigue, employment outside the home, trauma to the skin or nipple, ineffective nursing technique, and milk stasis. The presenting symptoms are chills, rigors, and fever, in conjunction with unilateral breast tenderness, erythema, and decreased milk production. Most mastitis is caused by S. aureus, which may be transmitted to the mother from an infant nasally colonized before hospital discharge, followed by streptococci and E. coli. Prevention includes proper positioning of the infant and nursing technique. Initial treatment includes an antistaphylococcal oral antibiotic such as dicloxacillin or cephalothin, after cultures of expressed milk have been obtained. If fever persists, coverage should be modified for activity against methicillinresistant S. aureus. Women should be treated for 10 days. If an abscess has formed it should be drained by ultrasoundguided needle aspiration, or surgically.",

Like hepatitis A, HEV may cause fulminant hepatitis, encephalopathy, and death. However, in contrast to hepatitis A, B, or C, pregnancy is a major risk factor for severe infection due to hepatitis E virus in endemic areas. The increased rates of fulminant infection and death in pregnancy have been attributed to pregnancy-associated changes in immune function, and also to a direct effect of steroid hormones on viral regulatory elements controlling viral replication. In a study of Asian women with acute HEV, HEV viral load was more than 10fold higher in pregnant than in non-pregnant women at similar stages of disease. 113 The severity of infection appears to be exacerbated by folate deficiency, which commonly complicates pregnancy in underdeveloped countries. Acute maternal infection in the second and third trimester is associated with pre-term birth, perinatal infant death, and acute neonatal infection with HEV, but infants who survive the initial period recover fully. 114, 115 Intestinal parasitosis and biliary ascariasis Infestation by intestinal parasites is common in pregnant women in the non-developed world. The extent of infection and types of infecting parasite vary according to region and socioeconomic conditions. A 2006 study in Venezuela found that 74% of women were affected by intestinal parasites, most commonly Ascaris lumbricoides (57%), Trichuris trichuria (36%), Giardia lamblia (14%), Entamoeba histolytica (12%), Necator americanus (8%), Enterobius vermicularis (6%), and Strongyloides stercoralis (3%). Pregnant women with intestinal parasites are more likely to be anemic, 116 but anemia may be the consequence of other confounding conditions rather than the parasite load. In most cases, pregnancy is not otherwise known to alter the course of the parasitic infection. An exception is infection with A. lumbricoides, which in pregnancy is more likely to cause biliary ascariasis. Biliary ascariasis may present as acute cholecystitis, cholangitis, biliary cholic, acute pancreatitis or hepatic abscess. Conservative treatment with bowel rest, antispasmodics, and antibiotics is successful in 68-80% cases, but the presence of dead worms, stones or strictures may prevent migration of the worms back to the duodenum, necessitating surgery. Animal models suggest the increased susceptibility to biliary ascariasis in pregnancy is due to relaxation of the sphincter of Oddi and decreased intestinal motility due to smooth muscle dysfunction as a consequence of increased progesterone and estrogen, particularly in the second and third trimesters. 117",

Sequestration occurs throughout the intervillous space of the placenta, and is not limited to the vascular wall. 120 Binding to other antigens may occur, but appears to be less important. The parasitized cells can also circulate, but the detectable parasitemia underestimates the placental parasite load, and examination of peripheral blood can be falsely negative. The risk associated with malaria in pregnancy is greatest during the first pregnancy. After several pregnancies, the mother develops specific 'antiadhesion' antibodies directed against the malarial antigens expressed by placental variants. 121, 122 In placental malaria, the intervillous spaces contain parasitized erythrocytes, and increased numbers of monocytes and macrophages (Figure 47 .1). These phagocytic cells often contain hemozin pigment, which may also be present as free pigment or in fibrin deposits, and may also contain ingested parasitized erythrocytes (erythrophagocytosis) (Figure 47 .2). The pigment deposits persist after the parasites have been cleared. The presence of both parasitized erythrocytes and hemozoin pigment indicate a chronic infection. When placental monocytes and macrophages are increased, changes in the placental cytokine balance are thought to contribute to poor outcome. 120 Malaria parasites do not cross the placenta to infect the fetus, although leakage of maternal cells into the fetal circulation at parturition could potentially lead to infection of the infant. Other plasmodium species do not adhere to placental receptors, and infection does not have the same clinical impact, although chronic infection with P. vivax is associated with maternal anemia, and low birthweight.",

However, schistosomiasis can adversely affect pregnancy outcome, such as low birthweight (japonicum) and preterm delivery (haematobium). Potential pathogenic mechanisms include maternal iron deficiency anemia due to direct blood loss in the stool (mansonii, japonicum) or urine (haematobium), or associated with chronic disease, and inflammation in response to placental infection by immature worms and eggs with consequent cytokine production. In S. haematobium infection, stimulation of cytokine production following binding of circulating antigen to placental TLRs has been proposed. Similar outcomes can be shown in animal models.

The virus is transported via the blood to the lymph nodes and spleen, and replicates in reticuloendothelial cells. Six to 20 days after the initial infection, the virus reenters the blood and disseminates widely, and the rash appears shortly thereafter. Virus is shed from the nasopharynx beginning 3-8 days after exposure, and for 6-14 days after onset of the rash, accounting for an extended period of infectivity. In most younger children, rubella is a mild illness, causing a low-grade fever that lasts for less than 24 hours, a maculopapular rash over the face and neck that lasts 2 or 3 days, and malaise. Many children are completely asymptomatic, although rare cases of rubella encephalitis have been reported. In older children, adolescents, and adults, rubella symptoms may include several days of fever, headache, malaise, coryza and conjunctivitis. Illness may be complicated by cervical adenopathy, which can precede the rash by several days, and by arthralgia or arthritis, which occurs in up to 70% of older girls and women. Thrombocytopenic purpura may also occur rarely.",

            "text": "Infection with human cytomegalovirus (HCMV or HHV-5) is a common congenital viral infection, affecting at least 1% of live-born infants in developed countries. Most severe fetal infections occur during primary maternal infection, with a congenital transmission rate of about 40%. Of these infants, 10-15% will be symptomatic at birth and an additional 5-10% will develop late neurologic findings. 134 Primary CMV infection during the third trimester has the highest rate of congenital transmission. In early pregnancy, spontaneous abortion can occur, often accompanied by evidence of placental infection, even without signs of fetal infection. Congenital infection can also follow reactivation of endogenous maternal CMV infection, or if the mother is reinfected with a new strain, but at a lower rate, presumably because of partial maternal immunity. 135 The risk of congenital infection in non-primary infection had previously been estimated at about 1%, 135 but a recent prospective study found a much higher rate of almost 20%. 134 It is now recognized that over 60% of congenitally infected infants have mothers with previous immunity to CMV, but with evidence of secondary infection during pregnancy. Most of these infants are asymptomatic at birth but are at risk for late neurologic disease. 136 HCMV infects many cell types, including fibroblasts, epithelial and endothelial cells, macrophages, and muscle cells, and latency is established once the primary infection is controlled. The consequence is that congenital HCMV may cause symptoms in virtually any organ system, most commonly the central nervous system, liver, spleen, gastrointestinal tract, and hematopoietic system. Disease may be mild or fulminant, with infant mortality rates of 25%. Findings typical of congenital HCMV infection include intra-uterine growth retardation, jaundice, hepatospenomegaly, enteritis, pneumonitis with respiratory distress, rash, chorioretinitis, pancytopenia., and central nervous system findings such as meningoencephalitis, calcifications, microcephaly, ventriculomegaly, ocular abnormalities, and cerebellar hypoplasia. Related symptoms include lethargy, seizures, and cognitive and motor deficits. Hearing loss affects 50-60% of infants with other findings of HCMV at birth, and 10-15% of infants who appear asymptomatic. Other deficits such as mental retardation, and visual and motor impairment are less common in infants who are asymptomatic at birth. 136, 137 In primary maternal HCMV infection, maternal viremia leads to placental infection, and subsequent hematogenous dissemination to the fetus. Maternal leukocytes transmit infection, either by migration later in pregnancy and direct contact with fetal endothelium, or indirectly by contact with uterine endothelial cells, which are in contact with cells of the cytotrophoblast. In cases of congenital transmission from mothers with recurrent CMV, local immunosuppression in the uterus is thought to allow HCMV reactivation in uterine macrophages, which then infect invading cytotrophoblast cells, allowing viral spread to the fetus. In an infected fetus, HCMV can be detected in blood, and viremia persists for months after birth.",

Infection of bone marrow erythrocyte progenitor cells (the precursors of erythroblasts and megakaryocytes) causes formation of giant pronormoblasts, cytoplasmic vacuoles, and large eosinophilic nuclear inclusion bodies, followed by cell death and an acute drop in peripheral reticulocytes, causing anemia.

When infection occurs between weeks 11 and 23, during the period of hepatic hematopoiesis, the fetus can develop severe fetal anemia, leading to high output cardiac failure and non-immune hydrops because of the short lifespan of fetal erythrocytes, and the three-to fourfold increase in erythrocytes needed to accommodate fetal growth during this period. Estimates from retrospective case series place the overall risk of fetal hydrops following parvovirus infection from 1% to 4%, and as much as 7% when infection occurs between 13 and 20 weeks gestational age. Death from hydrops occurs in 50-90% of untreated cases within 2-4 weeks after maternal infection. 144 Treatment includes intra-uterine transfusion, which improves survival to 85% in the cases of severe hydrops. 145, 146 Early studies suggested that the overall outcome after maternal parvovirus infection is good for liveborn infants, 147 and growth and general health are normal. 148 However, in a recent follow-up study of 24 infants treated with transfusions for hydrops, 3 of the 16 surviving children (32%) had developmental delays not attributable to other etiologies. 149 Parvovirus binds to susceptible cells through globoside or P-antigen, and individuals lacking P-antigens cannot be infected by the virus. However, P-antigen expression is not sufficient for viral entry into the cell, which requires the presence of a functional co-receptor such as the \ue0615\ue0621 integrin, 150 or possibly Ku80. 151 Placental expression of P-antigen, which is highest early in pregnancy and gradually declines to become undetectable in the third trimester, may influence the likelihood of maternal-fetal transmission. A virally encoded phosphoprotein, NS1, controls viral transcription and replication, and causes host cell death, both by direct toxicity and by promoting cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. The NS1 protein also causes release of placental proinflammatory cytokines that are associated with a poor pregnancy outcome.",

Listeria is able to replicate in the cell cytosol, and to use intracellular actin polymerization to propel bacteria from one cell to another cell with minimal exposure to the extracellular environment. 178 Listeria also expresses surface proteins called internalins that enable the organism to invade nonphagocytic cells including placental syncytiotrophoblast and villous cytotrophoblast cells, as well as intestinal cells. 180 The outcome of placental infection is pregnancy loss, fetal death, preterm birth or stillbirth. 181 A newborn exposed to Listeria may develop septicemia or meningoencephalitis.

DHF may be confused with pre-eclampsia, because of the symptoms of thrombocytopenia, liver dysfunction, capillary leak, edema, ascites, and decreased urine output. 182 Most pregnant women with dengue present in the third trimester. Dengue infection in the first trimester of pregnancy may be complicated by spontaneous abortion, and in the third trimester by premature delivery, and by severe and prolonged bleeding during surgical deliveries. The incidence of fetal death is increased. In DHF, increased vascular permeability and endothelial leakage damage the placenta, and may allow vertical transmission of virus. Fetal malformations do not appear to be associated with maternal infection. 183 However, exposure in utero may predispose the infant to DHF. Treatment is supportive, with intravenous fluid replacement and platelet transfusions as needed. 182 Pregnant women should avoid travel to areas of ongoing dengue transmission, particularly in the third trimester.",

Vaccination offers considerable protection against mortality, and the risk of death from smallpox infection appears to be 10-fold higher in unvaccinated as compared to previously vaccinated pregnant women. 195, 196 Acute maternal smallpox also has a devastating affect on pregnancy outcome, causing spontaneous abortion and premature termination of pregnancy. The overall proportion of abortion or preterm birth was 39.9%, 196 but has been reported to be up to 60-75%. 195 Over half of live births born to mothers infected in the second half of pregnancy die within the two weeks after delivery, and most within the first 72 hours. The risk of miscarriage and preterm birth were similarly elevated even in women with mild cases of smallpox. Prior vaccination does not appear to improve pregnancy outcome. 196 Cellular immunity appears to be the most important aspect of the immune response determining outcome, since neutralizing antibodies develop early in primary infections and do not influence lesion size or affect survival. Animal models in non-pregnant inbred mice of experimental poxvirus infections with vaccinia or the murine poxvirus ectromelia have shown that a 'type 1' immune response and production of Th1 cytokines promote resistance to smallpox, but a 'type 2' response enhances pathogenesis. 195 Smallpox vaccination of pregnant women is recommended only in the setting of a potential outbreak, since vaccination just before conception or during pregnancy can result, in rare instances, in fetal vaccinia. The risk is very small, and only about 50 cases have been documented, despite massive smallpox vaccination during eradication efforts. 197 For the 376 women in the US military enrolled in the National Smallpox Vaccine in Pregnancy Registry from 2003 through 2006, the rates of pregnancy loss (11.9%), preterm birth (10.7%), and birth defects (2.8%), were not increased, and there were no cases of fetal vaccinia. 198",

An agent with a known safety profile should be used whenever possible. Currently, the FDA categorizes antimicrobials for use in pregnancy based on evidence of safety and risk as Category A (Studies of use by pregnant women without known adverse effects on fetus), Category B (Appear safe in animal studies, limited studies in pregnant women or appear safe in human studies although some problem in studies of pregnant animals), Category C (Little or no evidence regarding safety or harm in pregnant women), Category D (Evidence of harm in some cases, but benefit may outweigh risk in some circumstances), Category X (Risk is high, unlikely to be outweighed by benefit). The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) plans to change this classification system in the near future to be more clinically descriptive.",

Sulfonamides and trimethoprim should be avoided when other agents are available. These drugs affect folate metabolism, potentially affecting first trimester neural tube development, and in the third trimester, sulfonamides can lead to neonatal hyperbilirubinemia and kernicterus. In G6PD-deficient women, sulfonamides can cause hemolytic anemia that may be poorly tolerated in pregnancy. Ceftriaxone is also known to displace bilirubin from albumin, but this does not appear to limit its use in pregnant women.",
