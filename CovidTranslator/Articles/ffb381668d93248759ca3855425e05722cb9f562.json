            "text": "H uman coronaviruses (HCoVs) were first recorded in the late 1960s; they are associated mainly with respiratory tract illness but are also involved in enteric and central nervous system diseases. They are represented by 2 prototype strains, HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43, which belong to antigenic groups 1 and 2, respectively. In 2003, human coronaviruses received worldwide attention with the emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) caused by a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV). In 2004, the increase in research on theses viruses soon led to the discovery of 2 other human coronaviruses, HCoV-NL63 in the Netherlands and, more recently, CoV-HKU1 in China (1) (2) (3) . In March 2004, van der Hoek et al. isolated HCoV-NL63 from a nasopharyngeal aspirate taken from a 7-month-old child hospitalized with bronchiolitis, conjunctivitis, and fever (1). One month later, Fouchier et al. characterized the same virus isolated from a nasal swab that had been collected from a child with pneumonia in April 1988 (2) . Phylogenetic analysis showed that HCoV-NL63 is a new group 1 coronavirus, most closely related to HCoV-229E. Partial HCoV-NL63 sequences from Australia, Japan, and Canada have been submitted to the GenBank database, which indicates that this virus is distributed worldwide. Two retrospective studies were con-ducted in the Netherlands, and 11 additional HCoV-NL63-positive samples were detected from November 2000 to February 2003.",

RNA was extracted by using the QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) according to manufacturer's instructions. The first RT-PCR assay was a 1-step simple RT-PCR that amplified a 255-bp fragment of the nucleocapsid (N) gene of HCoV-NL63 by using the following primers: N5-PCR2 (5\u2032-GATAACCAGTCGAAGTCACCTAGTTC-3\u2032) and N3-PCR2 (5\u2032-ATTAGGAATCAATTCAGCAAGCTGTG-3\u2032). The second assay was a 1-step multiplex RT-PCR that amplified the same 255-bp fragment of the N gene of HCoV-NL63, a 574-bp fragment of the membrane (M) gene of HCoV-229E, and a 334-bp fragment of the M gene of HCoV-OC43 by using previously described primers (4, 5) . These assays (OneStep RT-PCR kit, Qiagen) were undertaken in 25-\u00b5L reaction volume containing 2.5 \u00b5L RNA extract, 5 \u00b5L 5\u00d7 Qiagen OneStep RT-PCR buffer, 1 \u00b5L 10 mmol/L deoxynucleoside triphosphate (dNTP), 1 \u00b5L Qiagen OneStep RT-PCR Enzyme Mix, 1.2 \u00b5L of 10 \u00b5mol/L each primer, 3 \u00b5L Qiagen OneStep RT-PCR kit Q solution, and RNase-free water to 25 \u00b5L. The reaction was carried out in a GeneAmp PCR system 2700 thermal cycler (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA) with an initial reverse transcription step at 50\u00b0C for 30 min, followed by PCR activation at 95\u00b0C for 15 min, 40 cycles of amplification (30 s at 95\u00b0C, 30 s at 58\u00b0C, 1 min at 72\u00b0C), and a final extension step at 72\u00b0C for 10 min. Each RT-PCR test included water controls that were treated identically to the virus samples throughout and was performed with usual precautions to avoid contamination.",

            "text": "RT-PCR products were subject to electrophoresis on an agarose gel, stained with ethidium bromide, and visualized under UV light. The comparative analytical sensitivities of these simple and multiplex RT-PCR assays were previously studied on prototype strains by analyzing serial 10-fold dilutions of positive control for HCoVs NL63, OC43, and 229E. The analytical sensitivity was equivalent to detect HCoV-OC43, the multiplex assay was more sensitive (by one 10-fold dilution) to detect HCoV-229E, and less sensitive (by one 10-fold dilution) to detect HCoV-NL63 (data not shown). No cross-reaction of these tests was observed between these coronaviruses. Samples that were positive for HCoVs NL63, 229E, and OC43 were confirmed by using a DNA enzyme immunoassay (GEN-ETI-K DEIA, Sorin, Saluggia, Italy) carried out as recommended by the manufacturer with original probes previously described for HCoVs 229E and OC43 and the following probe defined in the N gene for HCoV-NL63: 5\u2032-(Biotin)CCTCTTTCT-CAACCCAGGGCTGATA-3\u2032 (4). A third RT-PCR assay was carried out on 12 HCoV-NL63-positive samples amplifying a 523-bp fragment with spike (S) gene-specific primers NL63-S-sens (position 22557-22582: 5\u2032-ACCGCTGTTAATGAGTCTAGATATG-3\u2032) and NL63-S-antisens (position 23043-23063: 5\u2032-GTCCTGCTATACG-GCTTGAA-3\u2032). This assay was performed essentially as described above. The RT-PCR products were purified by using ExoSAP-IT (USB Corporation, Cleveland, OH, USA) and sequenced with the primers by using the CEQ Dye Terminator Cycle Sequencing Quick Start Kit on a CEQ 8000 Genetic Analysis System (Beckman Coulter, Fullerton, CA, USA). The nucleotide sequences of the partial S gene (GenBank accession nos. AY994243-AY994254) were compared with the 2 prototype HCoV-NL63 sequences available in GenBank (NL63-Amsterdam1: NC005831 and NL: AY518894). Both nucleotide and predicted amino acid sequence alignments were prepared by using ClustalX version 1.83. The phylogenetic trees were constructed by using HCoV-229E as an outgroup.",

Discordant results were found for the remaining 6 samples: 3 were positive only in simple RT-PCR, and 3 were positive only in multiplex RT-PCR. These discordant samples were controlled by using the same methods from the RNA extraction product; the results obtained were identical. The specificity of the RT-PCR products under UV was confirmed by hybridization. Multiplex RT-PCR identified 3 samples with HCoV-OC43 and 1 sample with both HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-OC43.

            "text": "A number of viruses cause respiratory infections, and many infections cannot be attributed to any known pathogen (6) . This fact may be because some detection methods lack sensitivity, because some respiratory viruses are not systematically tested for, or because some pathogens are not yet identified. Of the 4 novel agents, HMPV, SARS-CoV, HCoV-NL63, and CoV-HKU1, identified recently, 3 were coronaviruses (1,3,7-9). Coronaviruses infect many species of mammals and birds, they possess the largest genome of all RNA viruses (\u224830 kb), and they have a high frequency of recombination. In addition, the potential to infect other species has been described for bovine coronavirus and is suspected to have caused the SARS outbreak (10, 11) . Therefore, coronaviruses represent a potential major infectious agent in humans. Based on genotypic and serologic characteristics, coronaviruses were divided into 3 distinct groups: with HCoVs 229E and NL63 in group 1 and HCoVs OC43 and HKU1 in group 2. SARS-CoV is not definitively assigned to any of these groups. However, an early split-off of SARS-CoV from the group 2 lineage was suggested (12) . Until recently, only the HCoVs 229E and OC43 and SARS-CoV have been thoroughly studied. As suggested by epidemiologic surveys conducted in the 1970s, human coronaviruses are distributed worldwide and circulate during seasonal outbreaks (13) (14) (15) . In this study, we determined whether this is also the case for HCoV-NL63. Furthermore, we looked at the symptoms of a HCoV-NL63 infection and the heterogeneity of the virus isolate circulating in France. In this study, 9.3% of the samples were positive for HCoV-NL63. These results suggest that HCoV-NL63 can frequently cause infections, particularly in young children.",

These additional cases of HCoV-OC43 infection in our patients can be explained by the fact that multiplex RT-PCR was performed directly on respiratory samples, whereas in previous routine tests, samples were first instilled into a cell culture system (HUH7 cell line) and RT-PCR was then performed on cell culture supernatant.",

Human coronaviruses, except SARS-CoV, generally cause disease much like the common cold, but they have also been associated with more severe lower respiratory tract conditions, especially in frail patients (4, 16) . Whether HCoV-NL63 is also responsible for coldlike illnesses in healthy adults, as has been described for HCoVs 229E and OC43, must be determined. The same can be said about the very recently described coronavirus CoV-HKU1. This virus was identified in a 71-year-old patient with chronic obstructive airway disease who was hospitalized with pneumonia (3).",
