They infused these cells into a patient with refractory metastatic melanoma who had not undergone any previous conditioning or cytokine treatment. The infusion of the autologous CD4 + T-cell clones caused complete tumor regression of a patient with refractory metastatic melanoma. The adoptively transferred NY-ESO-1-specific CD4 + T-cell clones were detectable for several months in vivo, and mediated a long-term complete clinical remission. Importantly, the infused clonal population of CD4 + T cells could induce T-cell responses to other tumor-associated antigens of his tumor. These observations supported that CD4 + T lymphocytes are also essential for the persistence of a long-lasting antitumor responses and generation of effective, nontoxic immune therapies for cancer.",

Therapy was independent of vaccination, exogenous cytokine support, CD8 + , B, natural killer, and natural killer T cells. Transferred CD4 + T cells expanded and differentiated into cytotoxic CD4 + T cells that could eliminate melanoma cells directly. This study confirmed that tumorspecific CD4 + T cells could cause tumor regression in adoptive immunotherapy against melanoma. 15 Melan-A/MART-1 is a transmembrane protein with 118 amino acids, and is expressed specifically on normal melanocytes and tumor cells of 75% to 100% of melanoma patients. 16 The Melan-A/MART-1 gene product was identified as a tumor-associated antigen by 2 different groups in 1994, simultaneously. Coulie et al 17 identified Melan-A as a melanoma antigen recognized by autologous cytotoxic T-cell clones from peripheral blood lymphocytes, showing a human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-A2 restriction. Kawakami et al 18 analyzed the target antigen of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes of HLA-A2 + melanoma patients by cDNA expression cloning, and cloned the same gene, designated MART-1. All of the tumor-reactive CTLs from both groups were observed to recognize the region encompassing residues 26 to 35 of Melan-A/MART-1 in association with HLA-A2. 1 . In 1995, Castelli et al 19 identified a naturally processed Melan-A/MART-1 peptide containing residues 32 to 40 and binding to HLA-A2.1 with tandem mass spectrometry. Subsequently, epitopes restricted by other HLA class I molecules including HLA-B45, 20 HLA-B35, 21 and HLA-Cw7 22 were described.",

Here, we reported the successful isolation, expansion, and characterization of CD4 + T-cell clones, which specifically recognized Melan-A/MART-121-50 peptide. We further demonstrated that these CD4 + T-cell clones recognized this epitope in 12 of 20 PBMCs of HDs in a HLA-DPB1*0501 restricted manner. Finally, we demonstrated that this epitope is naturally processed and presented by DCs pulsed with Melan-A/ MART-1 protein or lysates of melanoma cell lines. HLA-DPB1* 0501 is frequently expressed in Asian population (44.9% to 73.1%). 27 Therefore, this epitope could provide a new tool and could significantly increase the percentage of melanoma patients that can benefit from cancer immunotherapy.",

These peptides were 28 to 30 amino acid long and partially overlapped by 20 amino acids (Fig. 1A) . Autologous irradiated CD4 \u2212 cells were added as APCs. After 1 or 2 rounds of stimulation, the presence of Melan-A/MART-1-specific CD4 + T cells was assessed by intracellular staining with IFN-\u03b3 and CD4-specific mAbs after stimulation in the presence or in the absence of the Melan-A/MART-1 peptide pool. Data obtained after this analysis for the responding donors are shown in Figure 1B and data obtained for all donors are summarized in Figure 1C . IFN\u03b3 + and CD4 + T cells were detected in 4 of the 8 HDs. After the first cycle of in vitro stimulation, specific responses to the Melan-A/MART-1 peptide pool were detected for 2 (HD 005 and HD 106) of 8 health donors. After the second cycle of in vitro stimulation, specific responses could be detected for 2 more HDs (HD 006 and HD 108). For these 4 responding HDs, the frequency of IFN-\u03b3 producing CD4 + T cells was 2.5 approximately 7-fold (average 4.6\u00b11.9) higher than the control group (without the Melan-A/ MART-1 peptide pool). The IFN-\u03b3-secreting CD4 + T cells in response to stimulation with Melan-A/ MART-1 peptide pool were isolated by cytokine secretion-guided magnetic cell sorting. The purified fraction was either stimulated as a polyclonal population or was further cloned under limiting dilution conditions by stimulating with phytohemagglutinin in the presence of rhIL-2 (100 IU/ mL) and irradiated feeder cells. Five clones, derived from HD 106, were obtained. They specifically recognized the Melan-A/MART-1 peptide pool. Clone 5 and 7 had enough cell number and were selected for further study.",

As illustrated in Figure 5A , >99% of A375, A875, and SK-MEL-1 cell lines expressed Melan-A/ MART-1 protein as detected by flowcytometry. The processing and presentation of Melan-A/MART-1 antigen by DCs after incubation with lysates from tumor cell lines A375, A875, SK-MEL-1 (Melan-A/MART-1-expressing), or A549 (Melan-A/MART-1-negative) was assessed by ELISA measurement of IFN-\u03b3 secretion in the culture supernatant (DCs:T cells=1:10). As shown in Figure 5B , Melan-A/ MART-1specific CD4 + T cells efficiently recognized the Melan-A/MART-1 native antigen that is present in the tumor lysates from 3 tumor cell lines upon processing and presentation by professional APCs. This result suggests that clone 5 recognized an epitope that was present in Melan-A/ MART-1 positive tumor cells and was naturally processed. To further investigate the specificity of clone 5, soluble recombinant Melan-A/MART-1 protein at the indicated dose was pulsed to monocyte-derived DCs (DCs:T cells= 1:10). Recognition was assessed after 24 hours of incubation by ELISA measurement of IFN-\u03b3 secretion in the culture supernatant. Autologous DCs were able to more efficiently process the recombinant Melan-A/MART-1 protein produced in Escherichia coli and present the relevant epitope to theMelan-A/MART-1-specific CD4 + T-cell clone, in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 5C) , whereas no significant recognition was obtained using NY-ESO-1 protein used as an internal control, or using paraformaldehyde-fixed DCs pulsed with the Melan-A/MART-1 protein. Specific antigen presentation was also obtained at the different DCs:T cells ratio (Fig. 5D) . These results show that the T-cell epitope recognized by Melan-A/MART-1specific CD4 + T cells from HD 106 is efficiently processed and presented by professional APCs. Recognition of tumor cell lines endogenously express Melan-A/MART-1 antigen by HLA-DPB1*0501-restricted CD4 + T cells could not be assessed because of unavailability of appropriate tumor cell lines that could both express Melan-A/MART-1 and matched HLA-DP molecule.",

Until recently, HLA-DP-restricted epitope has been poorly characterized. The HLA-DPB1*0501 allele is the most frequent (44.9% to 73.1%) allele at the DPB1 locus found in the Asian population. 27 As consistent with the prevalence of DPB1*0501 in Chinese populations, PBMCs from 12 of 20 HLA-unselected HDs were able to present the Melan-A/ MART-1 epitope to specific clonal CD4 + T cells. The later molecular typing results showed that the 12 HDs, which had the ability to present Melan-A/ MART-1 21-50 to specific CD4 + T-cell clone, all expressed the DPB1*0501 allele, whereas the remaining 8 HDs did not. In contrast with the high expressing frequency in the Chinese population, HLA-DPB1* 0501 allele is rare in whites (2.6% to 5.3%). 27 This big difference in the allele frequency among different ethnic groups may contribute to explain why HLA-DPB1*0501 restricted epitopes have been reported less frequently in whites than in Asians. As approximately 44.9% to 73.1% of individuals express HLA-DPB1*0501, 27 the identification of this epitope significantly increase the percentage of melanoma patients that can benefit from anticancer immunotherapy.",

Recognition of 2 already known HLA class II epitopes by Melan-A/MART-1 specific CD4 + T-cell clone. Peptide recognition by Melan-A/MART-1 specific CD4 + T-cell clone 5 from healthy donor 106 was assessed by stimulating culture aliquots with synthetic peptides (2 \u03bcM). IFN-\u03b3 secretion in the culture supernatant was measured by ELISA 24 hours after stimulation. Data were shown as mean of triplicate values. Each graph is representative of at least 3 independent experiments giving comparable results. ELISA indicates enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; IFN, interferon; HLA, human leukocyte antigen. ",

This situation is reminiscent of previous findings with other tumor-associated antigens, such as SSX-2 30-33 and NY-ESO-1,[34][35][36][37] in which immunodominant hotspots also be observed. Immunological hotspots of T-cell epitopes have also been previously described in viral antigens, such as human immunodeficiency virus-1 proteins38 and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus nucleocapsid.39 These clusters of T-cell epitopes that bind to multiple alleles of MHC molecules are suitable targets for epitope-based vaccines and cancer immunotherapy because they are relevant to most of the human population and can elicit activation of both CD4 + and CD8 + T cells.40 Specific CD4 + T cells can recognize the epitope when recombinant Melan-A/MART-1 protein or lysates of Melan-A/MART-1-expressing tumor cell is processed and presented by autologous DCs. These results show that the T-cell epitope recognized by Melan-A/ MART-1-specific CD4 + T cells from HD 106 is efficiently processed and presented by professional APCs through the exogenous pathway. Recognition of tumor cell lines endogenously express Melan-A/MART-1 antigen by HLA-DPB1*0501-restricted CD4 + T cells could not be assessed because of unavailability of appropriate tumor cell lines that could both express Melan-A/MART-1 and matched HLA-DP molecule.",
