This has led some investigators to hypothesize that such illnesses may also have disruptive effects on sleep. While several self-report studies suggest that viral illness may influence sleep parameters, no studies have assessed polysomnographically recorded sleep following viral infections. Design: Parallel control group comparison. Setting: Sleep laboratory in a large urban medical center. Participants: Twenty-one men and women with susceptibility to the rhinovirus type 23. Interventions: Nasal inoculation with rhinovirus type 23. Measurements: Polysomnographically recorded sleep for five nights (2300 \u00b1 0700 h) post-viral inoculation. Twice daily (1030 and 1430 h) performance assessment during each experimental day using auditory vigilance and divided attention tasks. A multiple sleep latency test (MSLT) was performed daily for the duration of the study. Results: In symptomatic individuals, total sleep time decreased an average of 23 min, consolidated sleep decreased an average of 36 min, and sleep efficiency was reduced by an average of 5% during the active viral period (experimental days/nights 3 \u00b1 5) compared with the incubation period. Psychomotor performance was impaired. These changes were significantly greater than those observed in asymptomatic individuals. Conclusions: The common cold can have detrimental effects on sleep and psychomotor performance in symptomatic individuals during the initial active phase of the illness. D",

In another study involving viral inoculation, individuals who became symptomatic showed a performance decrement on a pegboard task involving hand \u00b1 eye coordination, but not on a visual search/memory task, whereas asymptomatic individuals showed no impairment [16] . Studies have shown that performance impairment may be present during the incubation period of the illness [18] and decrements may remain for several days following symptom remission [14] .",

Although items specifically related to ease of falling asleep were not assessed in previous studies, total sleep time has been reported to increase during the active phase of the illness [10] . However, self-reports of sleep parameters must be interpreted with caution as they are often uncorrelated with objective findings and such measures may be unduly affected by the general malaise and fatigue often accompanying even minor illnesses.",

However, one study has shown that performance impairments can be present in subclinically infected individuals who are not experiencing significant symptoms [15] . This apparent in-congruity in findings may be related to differences in task sensitivity as several of the performance measures in the present study were unaffected by the rhinovirus challenge. Specifically, lengthy monotonous tasks (i.e., simple reaction time, auditory vigilance) may be more sensitive to the effects of minor reductions in sleep duration while more complex tasks requiring multiple response modalities and increased cognitive effort may be less sensitive to these effects due to their inherent``activating'' nature. That is, certain tasks may themselves be activating and thereb\u1ef3`m ask'' sleepiness that may otherwise have been detected. In one study, impairment was detected in asymptomatic individuals on a five-choice reaction time task but not on a more complex detection task [15] . Similarly, in the present study, impairments were detected on a minimally complex vigilance task but not on a more complex divided attention task. Although it appears unlikely, it may be argued that an even more sensitive task may have enabled detection of impairments in asymptomatic individuals in the present study. Additional studies using a wider range of cognitive tasks are necessary before more definitive conclusions can be made.",

While previous findings of performance impairment were replicated, the effects on sleep were modest, and no effect on daytime sleepiness was found. Thus, while lack of sleep cannot be ruled out as a mediator of the performance impairment, it is unlikely given the absence of an effect on daytime sleepiness. The correlation between``cough'' and MSLT latency suggests another possible explanation that the symptoms themselves may have inhibited sleep onset on the MSLT. While this is not likely given the lack of consistent relationships between sleep latency on the MSLT and symptomatology, the tendency for symptomatic individuals to report increased nocturnal sleep latencies suggests that this possibility cannot be eliminated. Longer studies that evaluate more severe viral infections may show effects on daytime sleepiness.",
