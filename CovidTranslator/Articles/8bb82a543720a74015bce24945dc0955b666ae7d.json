If official sources did not have data for variables on some dates, we calculated the number of cases based on the relationships between variables. Because Wuhan did not systematically report the number of severe and critical cases, we estimated these numbers by assuming that the proportions of serious and critical cases out of all currently confirmed cases was the same in Wuhan as in the rest of Hubei. For the dates when it was not possible to estimate the severe and critical case counts using the above methods (January 18, 25, and 27), we assumed the number of severe and critical cases on those dates were the same as reported for the previous day.",

            "text": "Exceeding healthcare capacity may also lead to decreased quality of care, such as not being able to get access to a ventilator, which would lead to an increased case fatality ratio. By the end of February, Wuhan's case fatality ratio was 4.5%, 3.2% for the rest of Hubei province, and for the rest of China, where healthcare capacity was not exceeded due to strong social distancing and contact quarantine measures in the early phase of the epidemic (such as Guangzhou), 0.8%. 13 In both Wuhan and Guangzhou, the lockdowns did not lead to immediate downturns in the demand for hospitalization or the number of serious cases; rather, the peak in these measures occurred approximately a month after the lockdown in Wuhan, and two weeks after the lockdown in Guangzhou. This delay reflects the potentially long time from infection to severe and critical conditions as many COVID-19 patients who eventually require ICU care present initially as having only mild symptoms, 14 and even longer time to discharge or death, 15 resulting in the accumulation of hospitalized cases long after the downturns in the community spread. In Wuhan, the longer delay may also reflect the ongoing transmission after the lockdown described above, which itself resulted from the overloading of the healthcare system. This study has several limitations. We relied on officially reported statistics, which may not represent the change of actual case counts over time, but rather a reflection of testing and hospitalization capacity. The trend in Wuhan of the number of serious cases and hospitalizations is thus not reflective of actual need, but rather the trend in maximum capacity of the Wuhan system in diagnosis and treatment. We are therefore more confident of the hospitalization and serious case counts in Wuhan after mid-February, and in Guangzhou, where excess capacities in diagnosis and treatment were reported based on both official and unofficial sources. In addition, our projection of the ICU bed needs in US cities does not take into account scenarios where local transmission may differ from that of Wuhan.",

If social distancing measures are effectively implemented early in US cities, the growth of the epidemic may be delayed. But it is also possible that US cities may not be able to implement the extreme social distancing measures that were put into place later in the epidemic in Wuhan. Therefore, the actual number of hospital and ICU beds that will be needed over the course of a COVID-19 outbreak in a US city is impossible to estimate precisely. Our estimated capacity needs based on a \"Wuhan-like\" outbreak could be a benchmark for what healthcare providers would expect to see during the first three months of a local COVID-19 epidemic.",
