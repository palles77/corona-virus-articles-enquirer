Early studies implied that international air travels might be key cause of a severe potential pandemic without appropriate containments. In this study, early outbreaks in Mexico and some cities of United States were used to estimate the preliminary epidemic parameters by applying adjusted SEIR epidemiological model, indicating transmissibility infectivity of the virus. According to the findings, a new spatial allocation model totally based on the real-time airline data was established to assess the potential spreading of H1N1 from Mexico to the world. Our estimates find the basic reproductive number R0 of H1N1 is around 3.4, and the effective reproductive number fall sharply by effective containment strategies. The finding also implies Spain, Canada, France, Panama, Peru are the most possible country to be involved in severe endemic H1N1 spreading.",

On April 29th 2009, the World Health Organization announced a global warning of the H1N1 spreading. As the large-scale transmission has been confirmed (WHO swine influenza up-dated, http://www.who. int/csr/don/2009_05_05/en/index.html), planes were suspected to be a crucial factor of long distance spreading. The rapid infection rise and convenient transportation network inspire epidemiologists to concern risks of another similar pandemic of 1918 flu. *Corresponding author (email: cao413@irsa.ac.cn) Influenza A (H1N1) is known as a human-to-human transmission disease, which infects people by direct body contact or close airborne contact [2] . Airplane travel is an idealistic and typical obdurate environment for close contacts. In the absence of obvious evidence that the virus is transmitted through airplane to the world, it is probable that the worldwide airline network is the main venue of the transmission. For the instance, many cases reported in United States, Canada, South Korea and Hong Kong, China were clarified to be infected shortly after trips to Mexico, suggesting that air travel helps the influenza whip around the world. On April 27th WHO announced that Mexico became a severe infectious region, then many countries re-strained international travels to Mexico correspondingly. An appropriate mathematical model should be constructed to portray the epidemic features, including the contact rate per infection, the average infectiousness duration and even the basic reproduction number. The classic epidemiological model, Suspected-Infected-Removed (SIR) is usually used to formulate the epidemic process without effective containment strategies [3] .",

The hypotheses of SIR model is that all groups of a population should be mixed homogenously, thus they have same possibility to be infected. However, these hypotheses were malfunctional under novel H1N1 transmission due to only limited surrounding contacts could probably be exposed to the few patients in the very beginning. Instead, Susceptible -Exposure -Infective -Removed (SEIR) considered the limited susceptible population into the SIR model [4] . While the contact rate and the death/recovered/isolated rate could be roughly estimated, the SEIR model was well posed. However, while the pathology of infectious virus varies by cases, few studies have analyzed the spatial distribution of this new novel virus, which is significant factor to establish control strategies.",

By May 2, 2009 , WHO raised the level of global pandemic alert to 5th phase, which implied that endemic transmissions had occurred in other countries throughout the world. Without effective containments, the virus was spreading almost uncontrollably idealistically. On June 11, 2009 , WHO again raised the worldwide pandemic alert level to Phase 6 in response to the ongoing global spread of the 2009 H1N1 flu virus. During these 40 days, many countries adopted strict measures to protect their populations from the hazard. As a result, the local transmission process had been \"depressed\" so that we can focus on figuring out the global transmission by international air travel. While the virus seems to be uncontrolled globally, containments were changed. For example, China changed the overall strict containment to community controls, so it is meaningless to evaluate global evolvement under complicated control measure. Therefore, understanding large spatial diffusion of this virus depends on how to construct a general model to estimate the impact of international air travel for transmitting the virus. Even if there were no clear evidence showing H1N1 virus originated from Mexico, early evidence demonstrated that many outbreaks associate with passengers travelling back from Mexico City [2, 5] . Without sufficient information of air travel destinations from Mexico City, the spatial dynamic of epidemic would be hardly to estimate.",

So the airlines were adjusted by companies in order to minimize their cost by fully load airlines. The number of airline passengers who flew out of Mexico were correlated with the frequency of detected confirmed cases worldwide [2] . 135 cities all over the world were selected in surveillance airline system [8] . 60 of them were located in United States and some others distributed in epidemic area to represent the tendency of potential transmission. The internet based information provided airline flight number, the department time and arrival time as well as the plane type (http://www.carnoc.com).

After simulation, all parameters were assessed. According to the definitions of LSEIR model, essential epidemic parameters of H1N1 could be evaluated.

Although the super spreading events had not been reported like those during SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome) epidemic, the infected numbers from different infections varied according to our early finding. The basic reproductive number for H1N1 flu is less than for SARS and some other infectious diseases, but higher than Fraser's estimation (R 0 =1.4-1.6, based on the Mexico data by April 30th) [2] . The incubation period and infectious period are 1.000007 and 2.96765 respectively, which lead to define the duration of infectiousness is about 4 d (According to CDC of the United States, the incubation period of novel H1N1 is usually 24-48 h, regarding the infectious period is judged by cases.).

After the rapid alert had been made by WHO, it is assumed that control strategies had been adopted by other countries. In our study, the global airlines play a significant role in aiding the distribution of infections. Considering the infectiveness duration lasts no more than 7 d (approximately 4 d in our study), and the air travel will cost 1-2 days after having been infected, the infectivity will decrease during international journeys. And the subsequent, more numerous, transmissions in other countries would be caused by the secondary or third infection of the original patient visitor from Mexico. The flight transfer would delay this spreading but raise a risk for travelers from other countries. Most cities in our study are the capital of the country or the state, or the typical famous cities. All cities connect Mexico City though no more than two transfers. The flight transfer rate is set on 10% of total traveler in all these international airlines. Three phases of global transmission were considered: (1) Original phase: The international diffusion occurred at very beginning of Mexico outbreak; (2) Uncontrolled phase: The local outbreak in Mexico exceeds 800 persons. (According to WHO report, on April 28, Mexico City had more than 800 infections when more than 1000 susceptible cases needed to confirm.); and (3) Final phase: The influenza A tends to gradually phase out. At first, the symptoms and pathology of H1N1 were unclear until CDC laboratories in the United States confirmed two cases in California, thus the outbreaks were not noticed. The latent spreading lasted for several days, which lead the actual original outbreaks might be earlier than that from WHO report and makes our result a lag behind the reported outbreaks. Limited cross-infections between native cases and visitors probably happened but did not lead to international concern for a potential pandemic. On April 27, after Canada and Spain reported cases, WHO raised pandemic alter to level 4, which indicated that the virus might cause \"community level outbreaks\". Two days later, the pandemic alert had to be switched to level 5, implying that the pandemic was imminent. We assessed the possible world diffusion from Mexico. As the results illustrate, neighboring countries to Mexico and developed countries have higher risks to have H1N1 migrations (Figures 2,3) .

The large scale spatial diffusion was portrayed clearly as the virus was spreading through air travel. Our estimation validates that a solid relationship between H1N1 and air travel exists, and predictions could be made based on these findings. Also, the epidemic features of this novel H1N1 virus, including the basic reproductive number, the infectiveness duration, are estimated and control strategies are discussed. Accompanied with the WHO warning, countries all around the world constructed some measures to contain H1N1 cases, including airline restrictions, strict epidemiological surveillance and related public awareness campaigns. These strategies appear to have controlled the spread of H1N1 effectively. The spreading of this virus by airline travel from Mexico was especially analyzed in our study, demonstrating that control of the H1N1 spreading at international flights would be a high priority in avoiding a pandemic. Sanitation and antiviral drugs should be used within airplanes first because the narrow passenger compartment forms an ideal place for virus transmission and the cross-infection prolong the time of virus infectivity. Because control measures have strong impact on H1N1 spread, our future research will focus on finding out the relationships between certain containment strategies and the spread of H1N1 flu.",
