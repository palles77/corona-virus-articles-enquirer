            "text": "Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) is a recently emerged virus that has caused a number of human infections and deaths, primarily in the Middle East. The transmission of MERS-CoV to humans has been proposed to be as a result of contact with camels, but evidence of human-to-human transmission also exists. In order to work with MERS-CoV in a laboratory setting, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has determined that MERS-CoV should be handled at a biosafety level (BSL) 3 (BSL-3) biocontainment level. Many processes and procedures used to characterize MERS-CoV and to evaluate samples from MERS-CoV infected animals are more easily and efficiently completed at BSL-2 or lower containment. In order to complete experimental work at BSL-2, demonstration or proof of inactivation is required before removal of specimens from biocontainment laboratories. In the studies presented here, we evaluated typical means of inactivating viruses prior to handling specimens at a lower biocontainment level. We found that Trizol, AVL buffer and gamma irradiation were effective at inactivating MERS-CoV, that formaldehyde-based solutions required at least 30 min of contact time in a cell culture system while a mixture of methanol and acetone required 60 min to inactivate MERS-CoV. Together, these data provide a foundation for safely inactivating MERS-CoV, and potentially other coronaviruses, prior to removal from biocontainment facilities.",

Subsequently, a significant amount of effort was put toward developing vaccines, antivirals and animal models for what became known as Middle East Respiratory Syndrome-Coronavirus (MERS-CoV), an enveloped virus with a positive-sense RNA genome. Since its initial emergence in Jordan in April 2012, the virus has become a significant health concern throughout the Middle East, particularly in Saudi Arabia where the virus was isolated and first identified in June 2012 (Corman et al., 2012; Hijawi et al., 2013; Zaki et al., 2012) . As of 24 July, 2014 there have been over 830 laboratory confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection with at least 290 deaths associated with infection with this virus (Global Alert and Response Website: http://www.who.int/csr/don/en/), with the majority of cases occurring in Saudi Arabia.",

Typically, many of the downstream studies performed on highly pathogenic viruses are completed in BSL-2 or BSL-1 laboratory spaces due to the availability of equipment and to reduce stress on staff. In order to complete this work safely, viruses must be inactivated prior to removal from high containment (BSL-3 or BSL-4) laboratories. Previous studies with the closely related SARS-Coronavirus have established that treatment of virus with heat, ultraviolet light, chemical inactivants and a variety of detergents are effective at inactivating beta-Coronaviruses (Darnell et al., 2004; Darnell and Taylor, 2006; Kariwa et al., 2006; Leclercq et al., 2014; Rabenau et al., 2005a,b) while Leclercq et al. have shown that heat effectively inactivates MERS-CoV (Leclercq et al., 2014) .",

Gamma irradiation also provides a means of translating inactivation protocols between institutions as the effective dose (rad) will be consistent between instruments and is not necessarily user dependent. The kinetics of MERS-CoV inactivation by gamma irradiation was evaluated using a virus stock with typical titer (\u223c5 log 10 ) and a concentrated virus stock (\u223c10 log 10 ). Virus stocks were irradiated to a specified dose and the resulting titer quantified. These studies found that 1 Mrad was sufficient to reduce titers by 4-5 log 10 and that 2 Mrad was sufficient to completely inactivate the virus as determined by plaque assay (Fig. 1) .

In addition, the necessary aldehyde cross-linking that is required to inactivate a virus particle is independent of chemical penetration rates. Our evaluation process of blind passaging harvested cells requires that all virus particles in a preparation were adequately inactivated. As NBF and freshly prepared PFA are similar chemically, we were surprised to find that one replicate of 4% PFA treatment did not completely inactivate MERS-CoV after a 20 min incubation while one replicate of 4% PFA and both replicates of NBF were completely effective. Treatment for 30 min was shown to be universally effective for both NBF and PFA and has been adopted as our minimum standard for inactivation of MERS-CoV infected cultured cells. The use of a mixture of methanol and acetone, typically 1:1, is often used to fix and permeabilize cells for immunoassays such as IFA or other microscopy techniques. We found that this mixture was sufficient to inactivate MERS-CoV infected cells after a room temperature incubation of at least 60 min. While this technique is effective at inactivating virus, its use in evaluation of cellular morphology should be carefully considered due to the generation of cellular artifacts (Moloney et al., 2004) .",

Despite the likelihood that Trizol \u00ae inactivates virus in cell culture supernatant or infected cells within seconds, our standard methodology dictates a minimum 10 min room temperature incubation to ensure inactivation. Reagents such as AVL buffer, which rely primarily on guanidine isothiocyanate to denature and inactivate viruses, are now used frequently in research labs and in field work due to its ease of transport, ability to automate and easier use and disposal. In the work shown here, we have clearly demonstrated that treatment of MERS-CoV infected material with Trizol \u00ae LS or AVL buffer renders MERS-CoV, and likely other coronaviruses, inactive. We have also shown that RNA purified from MERS-CoV is not naturally infectious in a cell culture system. The ability of positive strand viral RNA to infect cultured cells has been a point of contention for a number of years with the NIH Office of Biotecnology Activities (OBA) and the Recombinant DNA Advisory Committee suggesting that purified fully intact RNA from positive strand viruses be handled at the same biocontainment level as the pathogen in question. The data for inactivation of MERS-CoV with Trizol \u00ae LS and subsequent addition to cultured cells demonstrates that purified RNA from this virus does not infect cultured cells suggesting that the guidance from OBA is not appropriate for this virus.",

There is also a question of thermal impact on virus stocks or experimental samples as the heat generated within the gamma cell is significant and can adversely affect material if not carefully controlled. Here we found that complete inactivation from a 10 log 10 cell culture stock was achieved following a 2 Mrad dose ( 60 Co source) with samples held on dry ice in a 2 l Nalgene beaker through the course of the irradiation. While clearly effective at 2 Mrad and appreciating that 3 Mrad should be sufficient to inactivate MERS-CoV, a prudent level of caution in our facility recommends that we utilize a minimum of 4 Mrad for the inactivation of MERS-CoV in cell culture supernatants under these irradiation conditions, a dose which should also be sufficient for virus collected from other biological systems, including tissues.",

            "text": "In the work described here, we have tested a series of procedures that are frequently used for the inactivation of enveloped viruses in a laboratory setting in their ability to render MERS-CoV noninfectious. These procedures are used for the fixation of infected cells, preparation of material for DNA or RNA analysis or irradiation of samples for assays such as antibody or cytokine analysis. Each of the techniques shown here will inactivate MERS-CoV, but most have a critical time component that must be met. The data provided here can serve as a guideline for other researchers, but demonstration of virus inactivation should be determined empirically by individual investigators, particularly in regards to the use of fixatives for inactivating viruses as these procedures a heavily dependent upon the user and requires quality reagents.",
