Since 2007, 12 batches of live Aujeszky's disease vaccines have been tested for Pestivirus by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), in the framework of the Official Control Authority Batch Release (OCABR). In addition to OCABR testing, random tests were carried out on 27 batches of seven different vaccines against porcine parvovirosis, swine erysipelas, IBR, PRRS, canine parvovirosis and feline panleukopenia used in Hungary between 2007 and 2009. In addition, 27 poultry vaccines, from eight different manufacturers, used in Hungary between 1996 and 2009 were randomly selected and examined by PCR for the presence of chicken anaemia virus (CAV) and egg drop syndrome virus (EDSV). A total of 35 different vaccines, including all poultry vaccines mentioned above, were tested for TTV (Table 1) .

Group 1 agents, including Pestivirus, chicken anaemia virus (CAV) and egg drop syndrome virus (EDSV) are well known to manufacturers and the competent authorities. Compendial detection methods, clear guidelines and legislation have been established to minimise the risk of contamination. Contrary to the wellknown Group 1 agents, Group 2 contains new potential contaminants, such as TTV and/or RD114 virus, recently found to be present in vaccines. These new contaminant agents have mainly been detected by academic research groups using nucleic acid amplification tests (NAT), underlining the key role of research both in hunting for new viruses and the improvement and evaluation of new, better methods for detection. Starting materials of animal origin, including bovine serum, SPF eggs and/or different tissues, such as CrFK are essential ingredients used in the production of many immunological veterinary medicinal products, but they also constitute one of the major sources of contamination. One of the specific risks associated with the use of bovine serum is the contamination of finished vaccine with bovine viral diarrhoea virus (BVDV), while CAV and EDSV pose a similar threat to poultry vaccines via contaminated eggs. A potential source of RD114 contamination is the use of endogenous retrovirus susceptible cell lines, for instance CrFK [14] , which is widely used to produce dog vaccines, especially against canine Coronavirus and Parvovirus. TTV may pose a threat to the safety of vaccines via contaminated bovine serum and contaminated tissues of bovine or porcine origin. On account of the wide species distribution of TTV, avian vaccines may be also affected by TTV contamination.",
