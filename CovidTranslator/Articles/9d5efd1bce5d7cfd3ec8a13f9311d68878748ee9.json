This strong partnership between the ASP team and laboratory has been extremely fruitful and has resulted in many successful initiatives to improve patient care. In addition, this collaboration has been helpful to address the challenges of assimilating new outpatient and inpatient clinical facilities into our rapidly expanding health care system. These challenges include finding solutions for the integration of diverse existing susceptibility reporting cascades, infectious diseases testing practices, antimicrobial formularies, and ASPs for newly assimilated hospitals and clinics.

Updated panel contents are reviewed focusing on the addition of new agents or the modified antimicrobial concentrations that are tested that may be relevant to our specific treatment guidelines. To ensure that the laboratory is providing the most clinically relevant antimicrobial susceptibility results, our program routinely validates and implements new breakpoint recommendations from the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI). 9 In addition to the standard rules for cascade reporting recommended by CLSI, 9 our program developed additional rules for antimicrobial susceptibility reporting so that results for some agents are \"hidden.\" Hidden susceptibilities are often agents that would be problematic for treating selected infections (such as fluoroquinolones for invasive Staphylococcus aureus). This facilitates a final goal of promoting the use of the right agent for the right patient. A \"hidden\" susceptibility result must be approved by the ASP member on call (or a consulting infectious diseases provider) before the microbiology laboratory can report the results for that agent in the electronic medical record. This reporting algorithm has guided providers to select an agent from among those reported, which are usually of narrow spectrum or enhanced efficacy, or are considered first-line therapy for the organism isolated. Some of our reporting rules for antimicrobial susceptibility results are described in Table 2 .",

The antibiogram serves as a resource for clinicians choosing empiric antibiotic therapy. By tracking changes in the antibiogram year after year, the antibiogram helps stewardship programs to identify emerging resistance or to document improvements in susceptibility rates after targeted interventions. The microbiology director has traditionally been responsible for preparing and validating the data for the annual antibiogram according to the rules described in the CLSI M-39 document. 10 Stewardship personnel, including pharmacists, have a vested interest in the antibiogram because of its potential impact on antibiotic prescribing. For this reason, stewardship pharmacists often work with the microbiology laboratory to populate susceptibilities, validate the data, and format the antibiogram so it is user (clinician) friendly. Color coding can help designate certain antibiotics as preferred based on enhanced susceptibility. Some institutions also add relative antibiotic cost information to the antibiogram to further assist clinicians at the point of antibiotic prescribing. Modern health care systems are often challenged with standardizing antibiograms to serve many stakeholders within the system. The system's stakeholders include staff working in different settings, such as clinics, nursing homes, long-term care facilities, community hospitals, and tertiary care medical centers. Developing antibiograms that serve each of these settings is difficult. It is important to identify stewardship staff or liaisons at each location who can provide the local perspective about the patient populations served, the antibiotic formulary, the most common infections encountered, and any resistance concerns.",

Consolidating antibiogram data can also improve the sample size for organisms that are infrequently cultured. However, there are barriers in developing antibiograms to serve multiple locations in a health system. It is possible that different locations use different assays for susceptibility testing or that the antibiotics tested are different because of inconsistent formularies. By working with microbiology, a system stewardship program can help standardize and align these processes, making consolidated antibiograms feasible and improving consistency in the use of antibiotics throughout the system.",

            "text": "There is no doubt that matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) has revolutionized the way that laboratories identify microorganisms. This technique identifies an unknown organism by analyzing the proteins present, separating them according to mass, charge, and the time it takes for each of the proteins to travel from the inoculation site to the detector end of the instrument. Based on these parameters, the instrument generates a protein spectrum that is then compared with the spectrums included in the database of the instrument. 12, 13 The main advantages of MALDI-TOF are the speed and accuracy for identifying microorganisms. The instruments have high performance characteristics and robust databases to identify the most common organisms isolated from clinical specimens. 14 Overall, identification is achieved 2 to 24 hours earlier for gram positives, and 24 to 72 hours earlier for gramnegative rods and yeasts compared with traditional systems of identification. 13, 15 Furthermore, MALDI-TOF is able to accurately identify fastidious or difficult to identify organisms that laboratories were previously unable to identify with conventional identification methodologies. The reporting of unusual organisms that are occasionally identified by MALDI-TOF can have unintended consequences because clinicians may be unfamiliar with the organism reported or with their potential pathogenicity and this can potentially lead to unnecessary antimicrobial treatment. Consultation with our ASP team is recommended for assessment of reporting language in the medical record and how clinicians might respond to a Staphylococcus epidermidis result as compared with a \"coagulase-negative staphylococcus\" report. Studies have shown that rapid identification of an organism by MALDI-TOF can improve time to appropriate antibiotic treatment, but only when associated with ASP collaboration. [16] [17] [18] [19] The laboratory at WFBH implemented MALDI-TOF technology in 2014 and our AS team has been fundamental in educating providers on how to use the early identification result to implement empiric therapy by providing reliable local antibiogram reports. Overall at our institution, the implementation of MALDI-TOF has clearly improved turnaround time for identification of organisms. Although MALDI-TOF does not provide susceptibility testing, many organisms have predictable susceptibility, and in these cases, rapid identification results in appropriate patient management.",

These multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays are usually offered as a \"panel,\" which can simultaneously detect, in a single specimen, the pathogens most commonly associated with an infectious syndrome, such as bloodstream, meningitis/encephalitis, respiratory, or gastrointestinal infections. 22 The implementation of rapid methods must be critically evaluated considering test volume, patient population, and availability of laboratory personnel and clinical support to ensure that the diagnostic technology selected is appropriate for the clinical service at a particular institution. Overuse or inappropriate use of these rapid tests may increase costs without providing the expected improvements in diagnosis and patient care. 23 In addition, many multiplex tests are not reimbursed by third-party payers in the outpatient setting, which can lead to serious economic consequences for the health care system and patient. ASPs affiliated with the clinical laboratory are of value to determine whether test parameters, such as sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictabilities, are useful for implementation.

The main advantage of rapid blood culture identification panels is that they identify the organism 1 to 3 hours after the blood culture has signaled positive compared with 24 to 48 hours using traditional methodologies. Furthermore, these panels can also identify genetic elements of resistance mechanisms, making them useful for selecting antibiotic therapy for multidrug-resistant organisms. 22, 26 At WFBH, we implemented the Biofire FilmArray Blood Culture Identification Panel (BioMerieux, Durham, NC), but because of current resource allocation do not use this panel for all blood cultures. To optimize cost-effectiveness and target patients at greatest risk, we elected to use this test routinely only for blood cultures from patients located in an intensive care or oncology units. We studied the impact of panel implementation for patients with noncontaminant gram-positive bacteremia and found improvements in AS metrics as shown in Fig. 1 . These improvements were attributed to the shortened time to organism identification and the ability to detect resistance. Median time to identification improved by 29 hours. Implementation of the panel also improved stewardship metrics for patients with blood cultures positive with a likely contaminant. For patients with blood culture contaminants, our study demonstrated a reduction in days of antibiotic therapy, shorter length of hospital stay, and fewer tests for vancomycin levels.",

Instead of reporting positive cultures to the nurse, results were reported directly to a stewardship pharmacist who relayed the result to the responsible provider along with antibiotic guidance. This method of communicating positive cultures improved stewardship metrics beyond what the rapid panel could achieve alone (see Fig. 1 ). Some hospitals, however, may struggle to maintain this model of reporting 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. After initial implementation of molecular blood culture testing with AS team reporting, we later elected to report results using in-basket functionality within the electronic medical record in conjunction with traditional reporting to nurses. Inpatient acute care pharmacists received the in-basket results instead of a dedicated stewardship pharmacist. Such passive reporting of panel results did not achieve the same improved stewardship metrics. Time to optimal therapy and time to de-escalation regressed back to levels close to the traditional method of only reporting to nurses (data not shown).

Furthermore, a large portion of lower respiratory tract infections is caused by viruses, mycoplasma, and chlamydophila. A multiplex PCR for respiratory viruses and difficult-to-culture bacteria, including pertussis, is now a frequently used panel test for respiratory infections. Testing for respiratory viruses other than influenza is controversial because many argue that detecting viruses for which there is no treatment may not be clinically important. Others state that identifying noninfluenza respiratory viruses is beneficial because it decreases additional testing, provides valuable information for epidemiologic and infection prevention purposes, and limits the use of antibiotics. 32 At WFBH, the first respiratory viral panel (RVP), a multiplex PCR for respiratory viruses, was implemented in 2009 around the time of the 2009 H1N1 influenza A pandemic. Initially it was mostly used for the diagnosis of influenza, but it quickly became a useful tool for assessing patients with other respiratory infections. Currently, the laboratory uses a multiplex PCR assay that includes 15 respiratory viruses and four bacterial pathogens. To begin with, microbiology and stewardship staff positioned the RVP for use in immunocompromised patients or those with moderate to severe respiratory infections needing hospitalization. Tests could be ordered without preauthorization or other restriction. Over time, the volume of ordered RVPs has substantially increased, with the maximum volume observed during the months of influenza activity. The high cost of the test and escalating RVP volume underscores the importance of diagnostic stewardship and prudent use of this test. In addition, test performance depends on collecting proper nasopharyngeal swabs and physicians and nurses should be trained on the procedure.",

Results of the study showed that providers were more likely to discontinue or de-escalate antibiotics if the RVP is positive ( Table 4 ). Hospital length of stay and attributable mortality was not changed. Microbiology and stewardship teams need to balance improved stewardship metrics associated with the test with its cost and high volume burden to the laboratory. Thus, although the escalating cost of RVP testing is concerning, it may be offset by reduced antibiotic expense and improved use. At WFBH the stewardship team is currently implementing diagnostic stewardship for the RVP to decrease the volume and improve the selection of patients for testing.",

Clinical specimens submitted for PCR testing were tested concurrently with an EIA that simultaneously tests for C difficile antigen and toxin. Members of the ASP performed chart review for each patient and made assessments of the likelihood of CDI while blinded to the EIA results.

This will ensure appropriate test use, a clear understanding of test characteristics and result interpretation, and opportunities for expert opinion to influence antimicrobial treatment.",

Antigen positive, toxin negative Interpretation: C difficile present but toxin not detected. Comment: This pattern is most consistent with C difficile colonization (occurs in 20% of hospitalized patients). There is no indication to treat C difficile colonization and anti-C difficile antibiotics do not prevent subsequent infection. Antimicrobial therapy and proton pump inhibitors should be avoided. Consideration should be given to medication causes of diarrhea, such as laxatives, stool softeners, colchicine, metformin, HIV protease inhibitors, antibiotics, or certain chemotherapy agents, among others. Enteral feeds are also a common cause of diarrhea. If symptoms and signs are consistent with colitis and risk factors are present for C difficile (eg, recent antibiotic exposure), additional testing using C difficile PCR may be performed, but testing requires prior authorization by the AS team. Antigen negative, toxin positive Interpretation: Undetermined. Comment: Toxin positivity should not occur without antigen positivity. Consider repeat testing if clinically indicated. Antigen negative, toxin negative Interpretation: Negative for toxigenic C difficile. Comment: There is no evidence of C difficile infection. Consider other causes of diarrhea. Consideration should be given to medication causes of diarrhea, such as laxatives, stool softeners, colchicine, metformin, HIV protease inhibitors, antibiotics, or certain chemotherapy agents, among others.
