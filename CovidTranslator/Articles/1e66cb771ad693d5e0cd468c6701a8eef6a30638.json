            "text": "Suckling CD 1 mice infected intracerebrally or extraneurally with 0C43 virus developed a lethal neurotropie infection with high titres of virus in the brain. Examination of infected brain by routine H & E staining revealed no necrosis even in extensively infected tissue. Resistance to infection developed with increasing age, and by 20 days of age mice were completely insusceptible to i. e. inoculation. Virus rephcation was also demonstrable by FA staining, in spinal cord, dorsaIroot ganglia and retina. All other tissues were insusceptible and in particular, macrophages from both susceptible and resistant mice were found to be resistant to infection both in rive and in vitro. Immunosuppression rendered 15 day old mice more susceptible to infection but adult mice remained insusceptible. The transfer of immune or non immune spleen cells from resistant mice did not confer resistance to newborn mice. Treatment of resistant mice with anti interferon globulin (AIG) did not render them more susceptible. These results indicate that the immune response is partially responsible for the development of resistance to 0C43 infection but that it is only partially protective and other factors must also be required. The basis for the unique susceptibility of neural tissues in suckling mice is being investigated.",

            "text": "W h e n 0C43 virus infects suckling mice it i n v a r i a b l y causes death following acute infection of the nervous system. High titres (1010 SMic LDs0/G) of virus can be recovered from the brain and extensive infection can be d e m o n s t r a t e d b y F A staining. Spinal cord, dorsal root ganglia and retina are also infected. There is, however, no growth of virus in non neural tissues as detectable either b y the presence of infectious virus or viral antigen. CD 1 mice become resistant to i.c. or i.p. infection by 20 d a y s of age a n d this resistance could reflect the inability of the virus to either re~ch or grow in its target organ. The failure to detect infected cells in the brain of adult mice following direct intracerebral injection of virus suggests t h a t t h e y are resistant because 0C43 virus does not grow in their brain cells. The timecourse of m a t u r a t i o n of the immune system (6) appears to parallel the development of resistance in mice. F o r this reason a d u l t (resistant) mice were immunosuppressed with cyclophosphamide (12) prior to infection with 0C43, but this did not render t h e m susceptible to infection. T r e a t m e n t of 15 d a y old mice with cyclophosphamide, however, rendered t h e m susceptible to a previously sub-lethal dose. This indicates t h a t the immune system, whilst being p a r t i a l l y protective in 15 d a y old mice, was not the sole factor in this resistance. Suckling mice could not be protected from infection b y the transfer of immune or non-immune spleen cells, in spite of the fact that large numbers of cells were transferred and care was taken to include adherent cells. The failure of transferred spleen cells to protect against infection could be due to their inability to localise in the site of viral growth i.e. the CNS as OC43 is exclusively neurotropie. I t has been demonstrated in MHV8 virus infections (3, 7) tha,t the maerophages of (susceptible) suckling mice support viral replication whilst those of adult (resistant) mice do not, and that this accounts for the differences in susceptibility. I n the above experiments the maerophages of CD 1 mice of all ages were uniformly insusceptible to OC43 virus infection, both in vitro and in vivo. The age-related resistance to 0C43 virus infection therefore does not depend on the inability of virus to grow in maerophages. This does not rule out a contribution of adult macrophages to control the infection by controlling virus replication in other cells (8) .",

            "text": "Treatment of adult (resistant) mice with AIG did not cause a significant increase in mortality following infection. This indicates that interferon is not involved in the resistance of adult mice to 0C43 virus, in contrast to the results reported for MIIV3 infection (10) . This difference in response to AIG could be due to the action of interferon on the extraneural growth of MHV3 whereas it was not capable of limiting the rapid growth of OC43 in the CNS. Resistance to i.p. inoculated virus appears earlier in life than resistance to i.c. inoculated virus ( Table 1) . I t is possible that the rate of clearance of virus from the blood is more efficient in older mice following i.p. infection, and this prevents virus from reaching the brain. Experiments to monitor the rate of clearance from the blood did indicate that inoculated virus could be detected in the blood of suckling mice at higher concentrations for slightly longer periods of time (data not shown). This could contribute to the development of resistance to i.p. infection. I t is concluded that age-related resistance of mice to 0C43 virus is likely to depend on changes in the ability of neural cells to support virus growth, possibly because of the absence of virus receptors. Experiments with cultured neural cells are being earried out to substantiate this. ",
