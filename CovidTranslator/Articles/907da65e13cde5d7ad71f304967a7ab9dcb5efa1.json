In this study, we found that two 20 different mechanisms are used in vitro to regulate PARP2 levels. In the presence of serum, 21 PARP2 is degraded through the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway, however, when serum is 22 removed, PARP2 is rapidly sequestered into an SDS-and urea-insoluble fraction. This 23 sequestration is relieved by serum in a dose-dependent manner, and again PARP2 is 24 detected by immunoblotting. Furthermore, and despite the presence of a putative serum 25 response element in the PARP2 gene, transcription is not affected by serum deprivation. 26",

The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the author/funder. . https://doi.org/10.1101/483289 doi: bioRxiv preprint factor and/or mitogen stimulation. To investigate this, we cultured different cell lines in 418 the presence or absence of serum and then assayed PARP2 levels. The loss of the PARP2 419 signal in cells cultured in SF medium (Fig. 1A) , and its return when serum was replaced 420 (Fig. 1B) supported the notion that the PARP2 gene was serum responsive. Given this on-421 off appearance at the protein level, and the presence of the putative SRE, we had expected 422 to see changes in PARP2 mRNA expression under the different culturing conditions. This, 423 however, was not the case and the presence of a PARP2 amplicon in cells cultured in the 424 SF medium indicated that the message was available (Fig. 1C) . Furthermore, the fact that 425 the quantitative-RT-PCR results showed no significant differences in expression in cells 426 cultured under the different conditions (Fig. 1D) indicated that the regulation of PARP2 in 427 cells deprived of serum was not due to the direct regulation of the gene, at least within the 428 time frame of our investigation. Thus, the presence of PARP2 mRNA under the SF 429 conditions did not seem to contribute to the fast return (within one hour) of the PARP2 430 signal after serum was added to cells incubated in CHX to block new protein synthesis (Fig.  431   6A) . Also, the reappearance of the PARP2 signal when serum was added was dose-432 dependent (Fig. 2B) and not reliant on increased transcription that was dependent on the 433 putative SRE in the PARP2 promoter (Fig. 1D) . These results implied that PARP2 under 434 serum-free conditions was either being rapidly degraded (Fig. 2C) proteases at the forefront of candidates responsible for the serum-dependent changes seen 442 with the different cell types (Fig. 1) . Unfortunately, our analysis using a caspase-specific 443 and a broad-spectrum caspase inhibitor (Fig. 3A ) as well as a proteolytic inhibitor cocktail 444 (Fig. 3B ) ruled out the possibility that caspases were responsible for the proteolysis. 445 Subsequent experiments were designed to explore the ability of serine, cysteine, metallo-446 and aspartic proteases to alter PARP2 levels (Fig. 3B) . As with the caspase inhibitors, those 447 routinely employed to prevent proteolysis did not have an effect on the PARP2 signals 448 when cells were cultured in serum-free conditions (Fig. 3B) .

Schematic representation of PARP2 regulation under different growing conditions. PARP2 maintains genomic stability by recruiting DNA repair machinery to sites of DNA damage (1), and when not required is ubiquitinated and degraded by the proteasome (2). Under stress condition (3), such as serum-starvation, PARP2 is either degraded in a proteasome-independent manner (4) or packaged into a SDS/urea-insoluble fraction (5).",

Leupeptin, an 452 inhibitor of endosomal trypsin-like serine and cysteine proteases (Simmons et al. 2005) 453 had no effect, which ruled out the involvement of cathepsin L. Details of the inhibitor 454 studies suggested that the disappearance of the PARP2 signal may not be the result of 455 proteolytic degradation, but instead and as noted above, due to the sequestration of the 456 protein to an insoluble form under serum-free conditions (Fig. 2B). 457 The detergent solubility of constituents within a cell is determined by the chemical 458 properties of the substrates as well as the detergents. Some cellular entities are naturally 459 resistant to extraction by detergents (Horigome et al. 2008; Takata et al. 2009) while other 460 proteins may be converted to detergent-soluble or insoluble forms following various 461 stimulations (Peters et al. 2012; Reis-Rodrigues et al. 2012). For instance, serum starvation 462 causes the translocation of dynein to a more detergent-soluble compartment in NRK cells, 463 growth hormone receptors occurs due to ligand-induced formation of cross-467 linked disulfide bonds (Goldsmith et al. 1997). These reports and our results led us to 468 investigate if serum deprivation caused an SDS solubility change in PARP2. Furthermore, 469 they raised the question of what in serum ameliorates the SDS solubility of PARP2? 470 Conversely, why does PARP2 become SDS insoluble when cells are serum-deprived and 471 what process initiates this sequestration or biochemical change? More importantly, what 472 physiological function does this regulation serve in cells, or does it even have biological 473 significance? Despite the similarities between PARP1 and PARP2, that the solubility in 474 SDS of the former did not change following serum deprivation would indicate that serum 475 withdrawal activated a PARP2-specific mechanism. 476 PARP1 regulation has been studied extensively and the protein can be found in 477 lamin-enriched or DNA-bound detergent-resistant fractions (Frouin et al. 2003; Vidakovic 478 et al. 2004). Furthermore, PARP1 changes its solubility in NP-40 detergent when modified 479 by sumoylation following heat shock (Martin et al. 2009). Several other proteins involved 480 in regulating DNA replication and repair, e.g. PCNA, P21, OGG1, XRCC1 and CAF-1 481 P150 are also found in DNA-bound detergent-resistant fractions (Amouroux et al. 2010; 482 Campalans et al. 2013; Frouin et al. 2003; Okano et al. 2003). Although PARP2 functions 483in DNA repair, this association with DNA would only enhance its resistance to some 484 nonionic detergents including Triton and NP-40, but not to anionic detergents like SDS. 485",

Moreover, under pathological conditions proteins can become SDS-496 insoluble, as in the mouse model of Alzheimer's disease where amyloid \u03b2 protein (A\u03b2) 497 changes to SDS-insoluble forms of A\u03b242 and A\u03b240 (Kawarabayashi et al. 2001) or in 498 Huntington's disease where the mutated Huntingtin protein with its polyglutamine repeat 499 expansion is resistant to SDS extraction (Heiser et al. 2000; Scherzinger et al. 1999).

The conversion of PARP2 504 between soluble and insoluble forms under different serum conditions that we observed 505 suggests the protein adopts a physiological conformation in either condition, linked to a 506 stress response. This is evident in nematodes and yeast where the accumulation of SDS-507 insoluble proteins in cells is indicative of aging (Peters et al. 2012; Reis-Rodrigues et al. 508 2012).

PARP1, the structural and functional relative of PARP2 is 521 ubiquitinated and degraded through the 26S proteasome, and the ubiquitination site is 522 mapped to its N-terminal DNA-binding domain (Wang et al. 2008). Two E3 ubiquitin 523 ligases, Iduna and CHFR, ubiquitinate and target PARP1 for proteasomal degradation in a 524 poly-ADP-ribose (PAR)-dependent manner (Kang et al. 2011; Kashima et al. 2012; Liu et 525 al. 2013). Interestingly, Iduna binds and ubiquitinates a panel of DNA damage repair 526 proteins including PARP2 (Kang et al. 2011). It is not known, however, if CHFR 527 ubiquitinates PARP2, but it is recruited to DNA lesions through binding to the PAR moiety 528 of pARylated PARP1, and is the first E3 ligase engaged in protein ubiquitination at DNA 529 damage sites (Liu et al. 2013). When this occurs PARP1 dissociates from DNA lesions and 530 is subsequently degraded in the proteasome. This degradation prevents cells from ATP 531 deprivation due to persistent poly-ADP-ribosylation (pARylation) (Liu et al. 2013) that 532 Liu et al. 2013) is likely the result of other DNA-dependent PARPs, possibly PARP2. If 536 so and in response to DNA damage, the presence of autoPARylated PARP2 may be the 537 result of it binding through the PBZ domain in CHFR. As attractive as this sounds, as serum 538 removal would have initiated mechanisms for cell cycle arrest (Bertoli et al. 2013), it is 539 unlikely with our cell lines that PARP2 ubiquitination and degradation contributes to cell 540 cycle arrest, as noted for CHFR-mediated PARP1 (Kashima et al. 2012). Our rationale for 541 disputing the degradation of PARP2 under these conditions comes from the MG-132 542 studies",

(A) Immunoblots of protein lysates 974 from HeLa, COS-7, MCF-7, NIH3T3, and IMCD cells cultured in CM and probed with the 975 H-250 PARP1/2 antibody to detect PARP1 (top panel) and PARP2 (middle panel), and 976 with an ERK antibody for a loading control. For the COS-7 and MCF-7 lines, cells were 977 cultured in CM until 90% confluent, and then the medium was replaced with SF medium 978 for 1 hour. (B) The loss of the PARP2 signal in COS-7 cells cultured in SF medium was 979 not due to cell death since adding medium containing serum (CM) (lane 2), allowed cells 980 to reacquire the PARP2 signal. MCF-7 cells were cultured in CM until 90% confluent and 981 then cultured for 30 minutes in either SF medium or maintained in CM. RNA was extracted 982 from each sample and (C) endpoint and (D) quantitative RT-PCR was done with human 983 PARP2 specific primers. The + lane had reverse transcriptase added to the first strand 984 reaction, and the -lane was the control for genomic contamination. Analysis from qRT-985 PCR data did not reveal any significant differences between cells cultured in CM compared 986 with those cultured for various times in the absence of serum. (E) Proteins collected from 987 MCF-7 cells cultured as in (C), were used for immunoblotting analysis with antibodies 988 against PARP1/2 and ERK. The reappearance of the PARP2 signal when serum was 989 replaced was indicative that the cells had not undergone apoptosis. (F) Proteins collected 990 from NIH3T3 cells cultured as in (C), were used for immunoblotting analysis with 991 antibodies against PARP1/2 and \u03b2-ACTIN. PARP2 signal was absent in SF cells when 992 SDS or urea extractions were used. Unless stated otherwise, results are representative of 993 three independent experiments. 994 All rights reserved.

After 20hr, cells were washed 165 in PBS (phosphate buffered saline) and proteins harvested by lysing in 1x RIPA buffer 166 (50mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 150mM NaCl, 1% NP-40, 0.5% Na-deoxycholate and 0.1% SDS) 167 supplemented with protease inhibitor cocktail on ice. Cell lysates were stored at -80\u00baC for 168 GST-pull down assays. Protein concentrations were determined using a Bradford assay and 169 equal amounts of total protein from each sample were incubated with Glutathione 170 Sepharose 4B beads overnight at 4\u00baC. Beads were washed 4 x 5 minutes with RIPA buffer 171 and then resuspended in 2x Laemmli sample buffer. Proteins pull-downed in these assays 172 were resolved by 8% SDS-PAGE, and then subjected to immunoblot analysis. 173In vitro ubiquitination assay 175 GST-PARP2 human recombinant protein (0.4\u03bcg) was added to a 20\u03bcl final volume 176 reaction mix containing 1x ubiquitin conjugation reaction buffer, 0.5mM MG-132, 1x 177 ubiquitin aldehyde, 2mM HA-ubiquitin, 1x Mg-ATP and 1\u03bcl HeLa protein fraction II. For 178 controls, 1\u03bcl of water was substituted for 1\u03bcl HeLa protein fraction II. Reactions were 179 carried out at 37\u00baC for 2hr and then inhibited by adding 2\u03bcl 10x E1 stopping buffer, 4\u03bcl 5x 180Laemmli sample buffer and 1.5\u03bcl of \u03b2-mercaptoethanol.

To determine protein concentrations using a Bradford assay, aliquots 189 were diluted 200 fold to minimize SDS interference. Equal amount of proteins was 190 resolved by 8% or 10% SDS-PAGE and then transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, 191 which were then blocked in 5% skim milk/Tris-buffered saline/Tween 20 (TBS/T) buffer 192 for 2hr at room temperature. Following an overnight incubation in primary antibody 193 (1:2500 diluted in blocking buffer) at 4\u00baC, membranes were washed in TBS/T buffer and 194 then incubated 1hr with a HRP-conjugated secondary antibody (1:4000 diluted in blocking 195 buffer) at room temperature. Membranes were washed extensively with TBS/T buffer and 196 signals were detected by enhanced chemiluminescence (Pierce Thermo Fisher Scientific). 197 Densitometric analyses were performed using ImageJ software (NIH). 198 HeLa cells cultured on glass cover slips were transfected with pEGFP-PARP2 and 201 mRFP-ub plasmids. At 24hr post-transfection, cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde 202 in PBS for 30 minutes at room temperature.
