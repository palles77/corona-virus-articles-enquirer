BCX1777 [(1S)-1,4-dideoxy-1-C-(4-hydroxypyrrolo[3,2-d]pyrimidin-7-yl)-1,4-imino-D-ribitol hydrochloride)] 30 is a nucleoside analog that is structurally similar to BCX4430. The purine base in BCX4430 is an adenine analog whereas it is a hypoxanthine analog in BCX1777. BCX1777 is poorly converted to its triphosphate metabolite and was used as a negative control compound, as indicated in figure legends. Synthesized BCX4430-TP was used in the in vitro hepatitis C polymerase activity assay. BCX4430, BCX4430-TP, and BCX1777 were synthesized by BioCryst Pharmaceuticals, Inc.",

Assuming an alpha of 0.05, the proposed sample size of six per group was selected to provide >80% power to detect a difference in proportion surviving between a treatment group (83% survival rate or higher) and the infection-control group, using a one-tailed Fisher's exact test. A sample size of six animals per group provided >80% power to detect differences between groups in geometric means of any quantitative measure of 3.5-fold (0.54 log 10 ) or greater, assuming a standard deviation of 0.30 log 10 at the 95 % confidence level (two-tailed Student ttest). For virus-challenge experiments involving mice, treatment-group sizes consisting of 10 mice were selected. Using a one-tailed Fisher's exact test, 10 mice per group allow for detection of a difference of 50 % or greater survival in the treated group versus that of an infection-control group with statistical power of 80 %, at a 95 % confidence level. For experiments involving guinea pigs, 8 guinea pigs per group allowed for detection of 63% or greater survival in a treatment group versus that of an infection-control group with statistical power of 80%, at a 95% confidence level.",

Table above shows negative irradiated protons integrated and referenced to a value of -100. The positive peaks were integrated with reference to the negative peaks and the values are as indicated in the table. Irradiation of H-6 aromatic proton shows NOE interaction with H-3' and the same is true for H-3' proton of azasugar when irradiated shows NOE with H-6 aromatic proton. This experiment indicates the base and H-3' proton are on the same side (beta) of azasugar. Irradiation of H-2' shows NOE interaction with H-5' and the reverse is also true on irradiation of H-5' indicating both H-2' and H-5' are on same side (alpha) of the azasugar ring. This two key experiments confirm BCX4430 to be an beta anomer.",
