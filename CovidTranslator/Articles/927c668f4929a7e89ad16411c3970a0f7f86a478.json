Asia has the highest number of tobacco users and is the prime target of transnational tobacco companies. The future of global tobacco control rests in this region and the challenges are clear. China, India, and Indonesia are key markets and Asia is a frontrunner in tobacco control measures, such as plain packaging of cigarettes. Some countries in Asia have a long history of tobacco control activities beginning in the 1970s, and WHO's Western Pacifi c Region is still the only region where all countries have ratifi ed WHO's Framework Convention on Tobacco Control. We reviewed the history, research, epidemiology, tobacco control action, obstacles, and potential responses and solutions to the tobacco epidemic in this region. Levels of development, systems of government, and population size are very diff erent between countries, with population size ranging from 1500 to 1\u00b73 billion, but similarities exist in aspects of the tobacco epidemic, harms caused, obstacles faced, and tobacco control actions needed.",

The tobacco industry regards Asia's economic and demographic growth as a business opportunity to expand its trade. Public health and development activists have mobilised social action to counter this threat and contain the health and economic costs of tobacco in the region. Although global eff orts for tobacco control are now better aligned, with the highest number of tobacco users worldwide, Asia is at the frontline of the tobacco epidemic. Campaigns to curb the epidemic must succeed in this region if the world aspires to be free from tobacco in the 21st century.",

In Hong Kong, the then-British colonial govern ment benefi ted from the experience of tobacco control measures in the UK, and noted the measures introduced in Singapore. The Hong Kong Council on Smoking and Health (the fi rst governmentfunded council in Asia) was established in 1987, the same year that Hong Kong banned manufacture, importation, and sale of smokeless tobacco, being only the second jurisdiction to do so.",

Commensurate with the global experience of that time, most early laws were neither suffi ciently specifi c nor comprehensive, or they had loopholes. For example, many early bans on promotion only specifi ed tobacco advertising, and not the full range of marketing, such as sponsorship; these laws had to be progressively revised and strengthened. Early educational messages were poorly funded (by comparison with the sophisticated advertisements of the tobacco industry), clumsy, technical, and diffi cult for the general public to understand. Asia has shown that tobacco control is not the prerogative of high-income countries, and that Asian nations-including low-income and middleincome countries-can grasp the political nettle of tobacco control, and can do so eff ectively.",

Only Thailand challenged the Trade Representative: full paper advertisements were taken out in US newspapers; con gressional hearings were held in Washington DC in 1990, when several Asian public health offi cials (including JM) testifi ed; and international opinion was mobilised. In adjudication of the case, the US General Agreements on Tariff s and Trade ruled that Thailand's importation ban was not justifi ed, but nevertheless, Thailand could maintain its law banning advertising and promotion, and could intro duce other tobacco control measures as long as they were applied to domestic and imported products equally. 2 A 1996 study 3 from the National Bureau of Economic Research showed that US trade policies had encouraged tobacco use internationally. The market share of US cigarettes in the four aff ected jurisdictions in Asia increased substantially after the countries were compelled to import US tobacco products under trade agreementscigarette consumption per head was almost 10% higher than it would have been if markets had stayed closed to American cigarettes. Although this fi nding was of extreme concern at the time, it galvanised Asia's tobacco control advocates and was the most instrumental factor toward an early under standing of the need to address political, economic, environmental, and trade components, and the need to tackle the tobacco industry and its supporters head-on. This political awareness was, and remains, crucial.",

In 2012, the Asian Development Bank estimated that, in the absence of intervention, smoking will eventually kill about 267 million current and future cigarette smokers who are presently alive in fi ve Asian countries (China, India, Philippines, Thailand, and Vietnam), and increases in tax would reduce the number of smokers and the number of smoking-related deaths, and would generate substantial new revenues. 10 Importantly, the Development Bank noted that the poorest socioeconomic groups in each country would bear only a small part of the extra tax burdens, but would reap many of the health benefi ts of reduced smoking. Up to now, only seven countries in Asia apply high excise and other tax at more than 70% of cigarette price. 11 Research has sometimes been supported technically and fi nancially by international organisations-eg, WHO, the US Centers for Disease Control Global Tobacco Surveillance System, 12 the International Tobacco Control Project, 13 and the US National Institutes of Health. Respected academic institutions and researchers in many Asian countries have used their research for policy and have channelled international and local research to the decision makers, which has added great weight to political lobbying. Translation of research into policy is a particular challenge, and not only in Asia. Many governments do not instinctively source data when designing government policy, and few policy makers in Asia have the scientifi c background to interpret the validity of the evidence, especially in lowincome and middle-income countries.",

Since 1980, rates of smoking in men have halved in Australia, Hong Kong, Japan, New Zealand, and Singapore. Smoking in women has not increased to the extent predicted in the 1980s. This fi nding is particularly sur prising because Asian women have become more independent, have greater purchasing power, and are less likely to follow admonitions from authority, teachers, and parents than they have been previously. However, such changes should not give rise to complacency and increases in smoking in girls in Asia are a particular concern. 16 Smoking prevalence is still high in some countries (table 1), especially in men (fi gures 1, 2). South Asia has the highest use of smokeless tobacco worldwide (fi gure 3). Most of the six million annual tobacco deaths worldwide are in Asia. In WHO's South-East Asia region, an estimated 1\u00b73 million people die every year from tobacco-related disease, 15 whereas in the Western Pacifi c region 14 two people die every minute, placing a huge burden on health-care systems.

Both national monopolies and commercial transnational tobacco companies operate in Asia, often side by side. These groups have ignored the clinical evidence; promoted smoking; established protobacco institutes; challenged tobacco control legislation; attacked individuals, organisations and WHO; mounted legal challenges against governments; and even secretly employed scientists in the infamous Asian Whitecoat Project to work undercover and slant the scientifi c data for second-hand smoke.

It has moved from being isolated, individualistic, and ad hoc, to a mainstream public health approach. 30 One new challenge is the integration of tobacco control in the framework of prevention of non-communicable diseases; 31 an even newer challenge is the framing of tobacco within national development plans, UN Development Assistance Frameworks, the poverty agenda, and inclusion in the next set of Millennium Development Goals. A new framework is needed to address the health epidemics of the 21st century, moving from a purely medical perspective to a perspective that incorporates political, economic, and fi nancial considerations. Challenges remain, including the association and confl ict of interest between governments and national monopolies in countries such as China, the scarce amounts of funding, the continuing legal challenges launched against governments undertaking tobacco control, and meeting of WHO's global monitoring target of reduced prevalence by 2025 so-called end-game targets of less than 5% smoking prevalence. Tobacco use is completely preventable through political will and proven techniques could reduce this epidemic. The epidemic will not only be solved in the corridors of clinics and hospitals, but also in the corridors of power.",
