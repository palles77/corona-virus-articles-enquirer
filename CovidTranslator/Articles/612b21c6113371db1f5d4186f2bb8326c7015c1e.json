Abnormalities of the development of the ear may create anomalies of the pinna, external auditory canal, middle ear structures, and inner ear. One of the anomalies that involves the external and middle ear is aural atresia (absence of the external auditory canal). Absence of the external canal may occur with a deformed or normal external ear. The ossicles may be deformed and are usually fused to each other as well as the bony plate representing the undeveloped tympanic membrane. The facial nerve may also be altered in its course through the temporal bone. Reconstruction of the atretic canal, removal of the bony tympanic plate, release of the fused ossicles, and reconstruction of a new eardrum is a complex surgical procedure that may improve hearing. Rarely there is incomplete development of the inner ear structures. The most common of these is dysplasia of the cochlea, and it may vary in severity.

A bone oscillator is used to test a range of frequencies by vibrating the skull, which stimulates the inner ear, directly bypassing the external and middle ear. Normally, air conduction thresholds require less energy than bone conduction thresholds. If bone conduction thresholds require less sound intensity than air conduction to be heard, the child has a conductive hearing loss. If air conduction and bone conduction thresholds are elevated but the same, the child has a sensorineural hearing loss. Most sensorineural hearing loss in children is a result of hair cell dysfunction in the organ of Corti. Hearing loss may be conductive, sensorineural, or mixed. Electrophysical tests such as brainstem auditory evoked response and sound emission tests that measure the intrinsic sounds from the inner ear (otoacoustic emissions) may be employed in young infants and children who cannot participate in behavioral audiometry. A mechanical test of tympanic membrane compliance (tympanometry) may also be used for audiometric assessment. All of these tools are employed by pediatric audiologists. 23 For purposes of describing hearing loss, a threshold between 20 and 40 dB is considered mild, 40 to 65 dB is moderate, 55 to 70 dB is moderately severe, 70 to 90 dB is severe, and greater than 90 dB is profound.

The posterior cricoarytenoid muscle contracts with each inspiration to abduct the cords just before activation of the diaphragm. The protective function of the larynx produces two reflexes: cough and closure. Cough is important to expel mucus and foreign objects. The closure reflex serves to prevent aspiration of foreign matter. In addition to closure, the larynx elevates during swallowing. Both closure and elevation occur simultaneously along with relaxation of the cricopharyngeus muscle during the swallow of a bolus. Finally, the larynx plays an important role in speech production by generating sound. Vibration of the mucosa covering the vocalis structures produces sound whose pitch and register is altered by changes in tension, length, and mass of the underlying vocalis muscle and ligament.",

Attempts to pass a flexible scope through the glottis in a child with airway obstruction should be avoided. Likewise, flexible endoscopy should be avoided in a child with supraglottitis because of the possibility of precipitating complete obstruction. Children with suspected airway pathology distal to the glottis or those in whom the possibility that flexible endoscopy could compromise the airway should undergo any airway examination in the operating room where rigid endoscopes and other airway equipment is immediately available to secure the airway if necessary. Nonsurgical intervention in the child with acute airway obstruction may begin with just observation alone in a high surveillance unit. Humidified oxygen administered by face mask will improve PO 2 and clearance of secretions. Racemic epinephrine administered by nebulizer acts to reduce mucosal edema and is useful in conditions such as laryngotracheobronchitis (infectious croup). Because its length of action lasts 30 to 60 minutes, treated patients should be observed for signs of rebound for 4 to 6 hours after administration. Corticosteroids have been shown to have value in the management of postintubation croup, adenotonsillar hypertrophy that results from EBV infection, allergic edema, and spasmodic croup. Use of corticosteroids in infectious croup and in infants with a subglottic hemangioma remains controversial. 10, 16 Other adjuvant therapies include antibiotics and inhalation of helium/oxygen mixture (heliox). Although viral agents are often responsible for inflammation in the larynx and trachea, bacterial superinfection is also common. Because of the prevalence of penicillin-resistant organisms, broad-spectrum antibiotics, including a higher-generation cephalosporin, penicillinase-resistant penicillin, or \u03b2-lactamase penicillin, are useful in preventing or eradicating infection. Heliox is a mixture of gas in which helium is used to replace nitrogen. The advantage of the helium-oxygen mixture is that its low density reduces air turbulence and gas resistance, allowing improved delivery of oxygen in patients with airway obstruction.",

Their best use is in cases where the pharynx is the site of obstruction. Oral airways are not as readily tolerated by children and only serve as a brief solution to an airway problem. During the 1970s, endotracheal intubation with polyvinyl chloride tubes revolutionized the management of supraglottitis, and even today intubation remains the mainstay of initial airway therapy in most children with severe airway obstruction. The size of the endotracheal tube used correlates with the age of the child. The subglottis, the narrowest part of the infant airway, typically admits a 3.5-or 4.0-mm inner diameter tube. The tube used in children older than a year can be roughly estimated by using the following formula: tube size = (16 + age in years) \u00f7 4. Once the airway has been established, the tube should be carefully secured and the child appropriately sedated and/or restrained if necessary to avoid accidental self-extubation. Another method of airway management should be considered in children with an unstable cervical spine or in whom oral or neck trauma makes visualization difficult.

The appearance of a neck mass in an infant often suggests a congenital disorder, whereas the sudden appearance of a mass in an adolescent might suggest a malignant process. Inflammatory diseases of the neck may occur in any age group but typically mirror the incidence of upper respiratory tract infections in children. Growth and temporal relationships are often important clues to a diagnosis. Neck masses that grow rapidly suggest either an inflammatory or malignant process, whereas slow-growing masses are typically benign. A history of systemic infection elsewhere in the body or recent travel or exposure to farm animals often points to an infectious origin. A history of trauma to the neck may explain the sudden appearance of a neck mass. Likewise, changes in the size of a neck mass with eating may suggest a salivary gland origin. Vascular lesions enlarge with straining or crying. Finally, systemic symptoms of fever, weight loss, night sweats, or fatigue in association with the sudden development of a neck mass may indicate a malignant process.",

Because the vascular, neural, and lymphatic patterns of the head drain into the neck, the source of neck disorders may be found in the head. Depending on the differential diagnosis, a physical examination of the entire body, including an assessment of lymph nodes in the groin and axillae and the presence of an enlarged spleen or liver, is essential. Palpable lymph nodes in the neck of children are a common finding, but lymph nodes larger than 2 cm fall outside the range of normal hyperplastic nodes and should be either monitored or investigated. The sudden appearance of large nodes in either the posterior cervical or supraclavicular regions may suggest a malignancy. 31 The consistency of a neck mass is also important in narrowing the differential diagnosis. Hard masses tend to be associated with either infection or malignancy. Fixation of a neck mass to skin or nearby structures is also suggestive of a malignancy.
