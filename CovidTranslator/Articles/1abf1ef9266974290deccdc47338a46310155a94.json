To address this, the complete nucleocapsid gene was cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli. Expressed nucleocapsid gene produced two distinct proteins (52 and 43 kDa); their specificity was confirmed by Western blotting using two different monoclonal antibodies. Recombinant N protein was purified and used as an antigen to develop an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for the serological detection of TCoV that was then validated using experimentally derived turkey serum. The N-based ELISA showed (97%) sensitivity and (93%) specificity for TCoV, which was significantly higher than an infectious bronchitis coronavirus-based commercial test for TCoV. To assess the utility of this recombinant ELISA, 360 serum samples from turkey farms in Ontario, Canada, and 81 serum samples from farms in Arkansas were tested for TCoV-specific antibodies. A high seroprevalence of TCoV was found in turkeys from the Ontario farms with 73.9% of breeders and 60.0% of meat turkeys testing seropositive using the N-based ELISA. Similarly, a high field prevalence was found in the turkeys from Arkansas, for which 64.2% of the serum samples tested seropositive.",

During IBV infections in chickens, the IBV N protein is expressed at high levels and produces antibodies that react with a variety of IBV serotypes (25) . The B-cell epitopes have been mapped in the carboxy-terminal region of the N protein (3, 26) . The N protein is also involved in the cell-mediated immunity and protection of chickens from IBV infection.

The cross-reactivity of turkey sera against IBV antigens was assessed using commercially available IBV whole-virus-coated ELISA plates (FlockChek infectious bronchitis virus antibody test kit; IDEXX, Westbrook, ME). The ELISA was carried out according to the manufacturer's instructions with the minor modification that the turkey sera were only diluted 1:250 rather than 1:500 as is normally the case when testing chicken sera. A subsample of 168 of the 360 serum samples obtained to assess the seroprevalence of TCoV in Ontario commercial turkey flocks were tested using the IDEXX kit, and the results were compared with the readings obtained from the recombinant N-based ELISA described above. Seropositive or seronegative status was determined using a cutoff OD 650 of 0.1 for the whole IBV antigen-based ELISA.",

First efforts to determine the seroprevalence of TCoV were based on virus neutralization (23) and fluorescent antibody tests (22) . Subsequently, ELISA-based detection methods were attempted; however, determining the seroprevalence of TCoV in commercial turkey populations remained difficult because TCoV cannot be propagated readily in cell culture (2, 4, 13; unpublished data) although at least some isolates can be propagated in turkey embryos (23) . Thus, a variety of antigens other than whole TCoV have been used to determine the seroprevalence of TCoV in turkey flocks. These include the use of IBV wholevirus antigen in an antibody-capture ELISA (this study and reference 17). Recombinant TCoV N protein derived from a prokaryotic expression system was suggested as a potential antigen for an antibody-capture ELISA specific for TCoV (18) , and N protein expressed in a baculovirus system (4) has been used to develop a competitive ELISA test in concert with MAbs raised against TCoV N protein (14) .",

A similar pair of expressed forms (52 and 43 kDa) was observed when the com- plete TCoV N protein was expressed using a baculovirus expression system (4) . Finding a doublet protein product is not unusual for some CoVs such as IBV and MHV that each produce two forms of their nucleocapsid proteins (6, 19, 27) . It has been shown that a whole-length IBV N-protein clone in E. coli expressed two protein bands (50 and 46 kDa) detectable using an MAb specific for the IBV N protein (29) . Similar phenomena of having different forms of the nucleocapsid protein have been reported for Newcastle disease virus, where this pattern was explained as the proteolytic cleavage of the translation product to yield different forms of the same protein (20) . The recombinant TCoV antigen ELISA developed herein had high specificity and sensitivity as determined using a twograph ROC analysis. Assuming a turkey flock seroprevalence of TCoV of about 65% in line with our observations and others (14) , the TCoV N-based ELISA would typically have a positive predictive value of 96.26% and a negative predictive value of 94.35%.

Using experimentally derived positive and negative turkey sera and a commercial IBV whole-virus antigen plate, TCoV-positive sera showed reactivity with the IBV antigens but at much lower OD readings. Thus, relatively few samples had OD readings above the cutoff values, and therefore, the inferred seroprevalence was much lower for this ELISA. For example, using a subset of 168 field serum samples, only 28 had OD 650 readings above a cutoff value of 0.100 (established using a two-graph ROC analysis and experimental turkey sera) using the IDEXX FlockChek IBV whole-virus ELISA performed according to the manufacturer's instructions and with the kit reagents (conjugated secondary antibody and enzyme substrate). In contrast, the TCoV-specific ELISA based on recombinant N protein found that 70.24% of these serum samples were positive for antibodies recognizing TCoV. There was a positive, albeit weak, correlation of this commercial IBV-based ELISA with the recombinant TCoV ELISA (Fig. 5) , presumably because the N protein is relatively conserved between IBV and TCoV (4, 14, 18) .",

            "text": "Seroprevalence of TCoV in Ontario, Canada, and Arkansas. Despite its cosmopolitan presence in turkey flocks and potential importance in disease pathogenesis, few epidemiological surveys have been conducted to determine TCoV seroprevalence. Using an indirect fluorescent-antibody assay or a commercially available IBV ELISA (IDEXX), it was determined that in Indiana, 175/325 (53.84%) or 163/325 (50.15%) of the field samples had antibodies for TCoV, respectively (17) . In a second study using a competitive ELISA and a recombinant TCoV N protein, 63% of the sampled turkey poults were found to possess antibodies to TCoV (14) . Our recombinant TCoV N-based ELISA detected 73.9% and 60.0% positive sera from breeder turkey farms and meat turkey farms in Ontario, Canada, respectively. Field serum samples obtained in Arkansas had similarly high seroprevalence. The higher observed prevalence of antibodies recognizing TCoV using our recombinant ELISA compared to results using the commercially prepared IBV whole-virus ELISA plate (17) and our results using the IDEXX IBV antigen plates suggest that TCoV-specific anti-bodies cross-react with IBV antigens but to a lower level than the homologous TCoV antigen. The prevalence of TCoV antibodies was high in both breeder turkey and meat turkey flocks as demonstrated by our data, but there was a significantly higher prevalence in the turkey breeder flocks, perhaps because the birds in the latter group are older and more likely to have had time to be exposed to the virus and mount a detectable serum antibody response.",
