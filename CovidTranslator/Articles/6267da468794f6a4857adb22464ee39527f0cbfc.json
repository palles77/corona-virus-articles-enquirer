Theoretically, courses that are able to recreate the practice environment, e.g. by looking at the competencies required to function in the field, rather than the competencies in isolation, would improve the ability of the students to apply the theoretical skills of the classroom to the workplace, and improve their ability to make intraprofessional linkages. [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] Professional support for the concept of education linked to practice is high, and it is already firmly embedded in the USA for both professional development and educational provision, with competency frameworks reflected in the curricula for training programmes, and both courses and schools for public health subject to assessment and accreditation of their programmes. 13, 14 The purpose of this study was to explore the interface between public health education and public health practice. This is particularly important because of the ill-defined nature of the public health workforce. As an analysis of job vacancies in Australia demonstrated, public health skills and competencies are applicable across a wide range of workforce roles, with the lack of clear practice boundaries complicating workforce planning. 15 By providing a snapshot of current provision, this paper helps to create a common framework for dialogue between stakeholders and has the potential to inform future curriculum planning.",

The standardized competency framework for specialists 30 and practitioners [31] [32] [33] in public health is already in place at a generic level, and work is underway to define the intraspecialism and entry-level competencies. 34 With the introduction of 'Agenda for change' and the underpinning knowledge and skills framework, the relationship between demonstration of competency and standards of practice is articulated across the whole of the health service workforce. Alongside this notion of a wider workforce for public health, the professionally led response has been to put developmental work into place that defines more clearly what is meant by being a 'specialist' in this wider conceptualization of the workforce, with explicit articulation of what it means to be a 'competent' specialist or a 'competent' practitioner (Table 1) .",

The Cochrane Collaboration reviews scientific evidence on an international basis, particularly in the evidence-based healthcare domain. Reflecting this complexity of practice within an educational context creates a substantial challenge for the public health education system. There is a significant risk that failure to do so will undermine the provision of a coherent, realistic and appropriate education for public health practice, which meets the needs of the widest conceptualization of the workforce. 1, 15, 39 Increasing literature on disparities and inequalities and new or rediscovered policy approaches, e.g. social marketing, the increasing 'personal' focus of public health, pose challenges to the existing teaching provision, making it difficult for universities to keep pace with the rate of change. With greater attention being given to accountability and outcomes in higher education, 40-42 a strong emphasis on competency-based training for public health and its subdisciplines, 28 and the incorporation of competencies into accreditation criteria for courses and schools of public health, 43 the challenges for providers of public health education have never been more explicit. Two key challenges have been identified in the literature for public health educationalists in relation to supporting their students to develop competency: to balance student needs to understand and apply the principles of public health with the need for them to be confident that they will be able to practice safely if they do so, with the role of education being the empowerment of students 44 ; and to support students in developing a broad range of knowledge and skills, which is related to the practices and settings of service and programme delivery. 10, 15, 45 Paradoxically, the scope of the public health agenda has never been more diffuse, with new developments heralding changes in policy direction, in practice and in research directions. Structural changes, 46 concerns about sustainability 25 and the ever-evolving operational/policy agenda add to the complexity. Calman's definition of the three levels of the public health workforce 47 has, in many respects, been expanded with the introduction of the 'fully engaged scenario' envisaged by Wanless. 25 The introduction of 'Agenda for change', the knowledge and skills framework and the work on the National Occupational Standards for Public Health undertaken by Skills for Health in the UK have all combined to define the expected competencies of the workforce more clearly at each of these levels.",

            "text": "In the UK, it is recognized that effective public health practice requires drawing upon the skills of diverse professional groupings. The three domains approach offers a model to make sense of both the scale of the agenda and the relative contributions of groupings to the practice of public health. It establishes the boundaries of the field for which the competencies achieved through training and education can be applied to a framework based on the historical origins of public health. The Welsh Assembly Government and the National Public Health Service in Wales use the framework explicitly in strategic commissioning and providing public health services. Thus, the three domains approach could ground teaching practice, enabling the assimilation of new thinking into the curriculum. In itself, however, it does not validate the required competencies. To validate the importance of what is included in an MPH course, it is necessary to consider what graduates do, the challenges they face and the mix of skills they require in practice settings. 15, 45 As the National Public Health Partnership in Australia noted, any conceptualization of the core functions of public health needs to be relevant to the 'total public health effort and not just to those activities which government public health authorities are responsible for carrying out or funding'. 1 Whilst the approach was grounded within the UK system, the Hong Kong case study demonstrated that the course could be applied to other settings. The restructured programme was run for the first time in the 2006/2007 academic year. The conceptual fit between this model and the accreditation competencies used by the Association of Schools of Public Health for review of schools suggests that the model could be applied more widely. 43 As Table 5 demonstrates, by grouping courses within thematic areas, the three domains approach provides a way of conceptualizing those underpinning skills and knowledge frameworks that are core to all aspects of public health practice. By grouping other topics within the three domains, explicit concentra-tion domains are provided that can be updated as new knowledge and events dictate. For example, in the field of health protection, infectious diseases and post-disaster management have increased in profile since the advent of SARS and the 9/11 terrorist attacks, respectively. Students can make informed choices about how to develop their skills within public health, choosing to focus on one aspect of public health practice or, alternatively, to 'drill down' in the skills of biostatistics and epidemiology, for example. This process is not dissimilar to that adopted in the USA, fitting conceptually with the redefined curriculum proposed by the ASPH competency project.",

The value of this to those seeking FPH membership would be considerable and may make the courses more attractive and sustainable. In practice, there has been limited operationalization of the competency frameworks within MPH provision, with only 12 of the 35 courses currently on offer making explicit reference to the FPH and the competency frameworks.",

It suggests that the process is at its most effective when assessment strategies reflect 'real-world observation' and consist of a 'portfolio' of assessment tools. 6 This will be a challenge for public health, in particular, given the ill-defined workforce and portfolio of practice, 49 which reflects the disparate nature of people engaged in public health activity and the understanding that public health is 'everyone's business' (David Worthington, personal communication). Whilst there is literature available that provides a framework to match a curriculum to practice development, 50 it has not previously been applied to public health. Applying the model to the findings from this study suggests that competency in relation to public health is relatively well defined. However, as public health itself is less well defined and delineated, 49 the reference points that are informing the competencies and which would inform both practice and curriculum development to support practice would need some further study to ensure that the maximal potential of the evidence base is achieved and reflected within a curriculum. Ensuring that the perspective of practitioners, specialists and their employing agencies are reflected adequately within the framework will be key to achieving this goal. 45 ",

Whilst the concept of competency has achieved a stage of relative definitional maturity, its functionality as a common foundation for academic and vocational work is debatable without further exploration to ensure that the competencies are grounded in the current context of practice, and reflect the experience of the specialist and practitioner workforces, and the current vision for practice articulated in policy documents. Models that incorporate competency-based learning within a more explicitly realized visualization of the delivery environment may better support students' future learning and adaptability to the workplace by enabling students to take a systemized approach to their learning, which is more responsive to the changing political and practical agendas. The three domains model, which has been found to be operationally robust in the UK and is endorsed by the FPH, its specialist body, could be easily adapted for use by providers of public health education, as evidenced by the UK and Hong Kong case studies.",
