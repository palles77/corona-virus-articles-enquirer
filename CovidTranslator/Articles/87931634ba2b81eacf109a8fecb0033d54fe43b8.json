However, the biological role of the macro domain is unclear. Mutations of amino acids 10 and 24 from asparagine to alanine in the ADP-ribose binding region of the macro domain impaired SINV replication and viral RNA synthesis particularly in neurons, but did not alter binding of poly(ADP-ribose). Mutation at position 10 had the greatest effect and caused nsP3 instability in neurons, decreased SINV-induced death of mature, but not immature neurons, and attenuated virulence in 2 week-old, but not 5 day-old mice. A compensatory mutation at amino acid 31 in the macro domain of nsP3, as well as reversion of mutated amino acid 10, occurred during replication of double mutant SINV in vitro and in vivo. The nsP3 macro domain is important for SINV replication and age-dependent susceptibility to encephalomyelitis.",

Sindbis virus (SINV), the prototype alphavirus, causes encephalomyelitis in mice and is a model system for study of the pathogenesis of diseases caused by alphavirus infections. In the nervous system, SINV infection targets neurons, and neuronotropism is determined in part by the glycoproteins E1 and E2 on the virion surface (Lustig, Jackson et al., 1988) . The outcome of infection depends on SINV neurovirulence and on host factors, including age and genetic background (Thach, Kimura et al., 2000; Johnson, McFarland et al., 1972) . Age-dependent susceptibility is a characteristic of alphavirus encephalitis and is due to intrinsic properties of neurons, not differences in the immune response (Fazakerley, Pathak et al., 1993; Griffin, 1976) . Newborn mice develop fatal disease, while adult mice survive infection. Likewise, undifferentiated neurons replicate SINV to higher titer in vitro and are more susceptible to SINV-induced cell death than differentiated neurons (Vernon & Griffin, 2005; Burdeinick-Kerr & Griffin, 2005) .",

The 3\u2032-terminal one-third of the genome encodes structural proteins, and the 5\u2032-terminal two-thirds of the genome encodes nonstructural proteins (nsPs) as polyproteins (P123, P1234). The nonstructural polyproteins are processed into four nsPs that form replication complexes in which the polyproteins and individual nsPs play different roles in virus replication. The replication complexes containing polyproteins synthesize negative-strand RNA and after the polyproteins are cleaved into individual nsPs, synthesize positive-strand RNA (Strauss & Strauss, 1994) . nsP1 has guanine-7-methyltransferase and guanyltransferase activities and plays a role in capping viral RNAs (Mi, Durbin et al., 1989; Scheidel, Durbin et al., 1987) . nsP2 has protease activity and cleaves nonstructural polyproteins (Ding & Schlesinger, 1989; Hardy & Strauss, 1989) , and also exhibits RNA helicase and 5\u2032 triphosphatase activities (Gomez, Ehsani et al., 1999; Vasiljeva, Merits et al., 2000) . nsP4 is the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (Kamer & Argos, 1984) .",

MacroH2A, the protein with the best studied macro domain, is enriched in heterochromatin and is involved in regional chromatin silencing and cell-type specific regulation of transcription (Changolkar, Singh et al., 2008; Ladurner, 2003; Nusinow, Hernandez-Munoz et al., 2007; Agelopoulos & Thanos, 2006) . These properties are associated with the nonhistone macro domain which interacts with histone deacetylases and poly(ADPribose) polymerase (PARP) to inhibit histone acetylation and nucleosome remodeling and repress initiation of transcription (Chakravarthy, Gundimella et al., 2005; Agelopoulos & Thanos, 2006) . In addition, macro domains of yeast, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus and hepatitis E virus proteins exhibit ADP-ribose-1\u2033 phosphatase activity in vitro (Martzen, McCraith et al., 1999; Saikatendu, Joseph et al., 2005) . This enzymatic activity is dispensable for coronavirus replication, but appears to play a role in the pathogenesis of mouse hepatitis virus infection (Eriksson, Cervantes-Barragan et al., 2008; Putics, Filipowicz et al., 2005) . The role of macro domains in other proteins is less clear (Chakravarthy, Gundimella et al., 2005) .",

A change from glutamate (GAA) (31E) to glycine (GGA) (31G) was present in plaques from SINV DM without the reversion at amino acid 10 ( Fig. 3B ). This second-site mutation was detected as early as 8 h after infection of CSM14.1 cells and represented more than 50 % of the total virus population (Fig. 3C ). However, this change at amino acid 31 did not increase the plaque size ( Fig. 3B ). Although most alphaviruses contain glutamate or aspartate at the position corresponding to nsP3 31E, most other macro domain proteins contain glycine (Fig.  3D ). When Ca and side chain positions of nsP3 31E are compared to those of corresponding residues in the Af1521 macro domain protein from Archaeoglobus fulgidus (Karras, Kustatscher et al., 2005) , 31E has a bulky side chain that the template glycine residue does not have, and C\u03b1 positions of 31E and nearby residues (30G and 32G) are not similar to those of corresponding residues in the template (Fig. 3E ). In contrast, Ca and side chain positions of nsP3 amino acids 10N and 24N are highly similar to those of corresponding residues in Af1521.",

In differentiated CSM cells, levels of nsP2 were also slightly lower, although nsP2 itself is not mutated. SINV SM24 showed minimal defects in the level of nsPs consistent with the less pronounced defects in viral replication. To examine the synthesis and stability of nsPs, differentiated CSM14.1 cells were labeled with tran35S at 20 h post-infection and chased for 45, 90, and 120 min, and levels of nsP2, nsP3, and nsP23 were analyzed by immunoprecipitation (Fig. 4C ). Similar amounts of nsP3 were synthesized in SINV WT-and DM-infected cells, but nsP3 was rapidly degraded in SINV DMinfected cells. Instability of mutant nsP3 was not a result of proteasome-mediated degradation because treatment with a proteasome inhibitor MG132 decreased, rather than increased, the amount of detectable nsP3 (data not shown). Furthermore, mutations in the nsP3 macro domain did not affect nsP3 stability in BHK21 cells (Fig. 4D) , indicating that the folding of mutant nsP3 is intact. The synthesis and stability of nsP2 and nsP23 were not significantly affected, suggesting that the mutations did not affect cleavage of P23 (Fig. 4C ).",

In this study we targeted the ADP-ribose binding site in the macro domain for mutational analysis and showed that the nsP3 macro domain plays an important role in SINV replication although the mutations did not affect PAR binding. Mutations at nsP3 amino acids 10 and 24 in the macro domain impaired virus replication and viral RNA amplification, and caused nsP3 instability in neurons. The greatest effects were detected when amino acid 10 was mutated. Mutated viruses formed small plaques in BHK21 cells, and virus variants with a reversion at amino acid 10 or with a secondsite mutation at amino acid 31, also in the macro domain, were rapidly selected during replication of SINV in cultured neurons and mouse brains. This study also showed that the mutations in the nsP3 macro domain impaired virulence for 2 week-old mice and mature cultured neurons.",

Virus variants with a reversion at nsP3 amino acid 10 to threonine or aspartate (the amino acid present in many macro domains at this position (Neuvonen & Ahola, 2009 )) emerged shortly after infection, indicating selective pressure. Furthermore, viruses with a second-site change at nsP3 amino acid 31 (glutamate to glycine) were selected and thus became more homologous in amino acid sequence and structure to other macro domains, in which this is a highly conserved amino acid (Neuvonen & Ahola, 2009; Till & Ladurner, 2009 ). Viruses with reversions at amino acid 10 of nsP3 did not have the change at amino acid 31, and the population of viruses with amino acid 10 reversion increased as the infection progressed, while the population of viruses with amino acid 31 reversion decreased (data not shown), suggesting that virus variants with these amino acid changes are different populations or are selected at different times after infection. The reciprocal relationship between these amino acid reversions suggests cooperativity and that a change at residue 31 is not required once the mutation at amino acid 10 is reverted.",

Likewise, mutations at nsP3 amino acids 10 and 31 in the SFV macro domain that affect coronavirus binding of monomeric ADP-ribose (Karras, Kustatscher et al., 2005) did not affect binding of PAR (Neuvonen & Ahola, 2009 ).

Studies of SFV have shown that mutation of the opal termination codon between nsP3 and nsP4 to encode arginine increases neurovirulence (Tuittila & Hinkkanen, 2003; Tuittila, Santagati et al., 2000) . In addition, mutations in the macro domain at nsP3 amino acid 11 (valine to isoleucine), 48 (alanine to glutamate) and 70 (glycine to alanine) collectively contribute to increased neurovirulence, but the mechanisms are not known (Tuittila & Hinkkanen, 2003) . We have shown that mutations in the nsP3 macro domain significantly reduced SINV virulence in 2 week-old mice and impaired the ability of the virus to induce death in mature neurons. Although replication of SINV WT and mutants was similar in mice as indicated by titers at 24 h after infection, the mutations facilitated virus clearance from the nervous system, a process dependent on the responses of infected cells to immune effectors such as interferon-\u03b3 and antibody (Burdeinick-Kerr & Griffin, 2005; Levine, Hardwick et al., 1991) . A similar effect on virus clearance was observed in the studies of MHV A59 with a single amino acid change in the macro domain (Eriksson, Cervantes-Barragan et al., 2008) .
