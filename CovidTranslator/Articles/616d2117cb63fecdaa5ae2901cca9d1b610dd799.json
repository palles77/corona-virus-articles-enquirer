            "text": "Samples taken at different intervals of time from suspension cultures of the NCTC 1469 line of mouse liver--derived (ML) cells infected with a mouse hepatitis virus have been studied with the electron microscope. The experiments revealed that the viruses are incorporated into the cells by viropexis within 1 hour after being added to the culture. An increasing number of particles are found later inside dense cytoplasmic corpuscles similar to lysosomes. In the cytoplasm of the cells from the samples taken 7 hours after inoculation, two organized structures generally associated and never seen in the controls are observed: one consists of dense material arranged in a reticular disposition (reticular inclusion); the other is formed by small tubules organized in a complex pattern (tubular body). No evidence has been found concerning their origin. Their significance is discussed. With the progression of the infection a system of membrane-bounded tubules and cisternac is differentiated in the cytoplasm of the ML cells. In the lumen of these tubules or cisternae, which are occupied by a dense material, numerous virus particles are observed. The virus particles which originate in association with the limiting membranes of tubules and cisternac arc released into their lumen by a \"budding\" process. The virus particles are 75 m# in diameter and possess a nucleoid constituted of dense particles or rods limiting an electron transparent core. The virus limiting membrane is sometimes covered by an outer layer of a dense material. In the cells from the samples taken 14 to 20 hours after inoculation, larger zones of the cell cytoplasm are occupied by inclusion bodies formed by channels or cisternae with their lumens containing numerous virus particles. In the samples taken 20 hours or more after the inoculation numerous cells show evident signs of degeneration.",

            "text": "Acute hepatic disease of mice resulting from virus infection was described in 1951 by Gledhill and Andrews (36) . Shortly thereafter, Nelson (58) , in the course of serial transmission of a spontaneous leukemia in Princeton mice by means of splenic implants, detected a virus responsible for the induction of hepatic lesions in his experimental mice and for the concomitant loss of the transplanted leukemic cells. These and subsequent reports of virus-induced acute hepatitis (6, 45, 55, 56) in experimental mice permit the conclusion that the specific agents responsible for the disease are widely disseminated in mouse populations in a latent state, and that activation follows the systemic stress imposed during experimental procedures. Since some strains of virus produce pathological lesions in the mouse liver similar to those found in human hepatitis (44) , and because trans-mission a n d study of the h u m a n disease is beset with difficulties, the s t u d y of hepatitis in mice h a s received increased attention, D u r i n g recent years, the biology a n d p a t h o l o g y of the disease h a s been u n d e r investigation, a n d some electron microscopic observations h a v e b e e n p u b l i s h e d (51, 69, 72) .

In our experiments the particles observed apparendy did not interfere with multiplication of the mouse hepatitis virus in the ML cells. However, their presence in this cell line provides an example of the caution which must be exercised in drawing conclusions from observations of viruslike particles in cultured cells employed in the search for new viruses. As Bernhard (3) points out, \"the morphologist is ahead of the biologist and has many unlabeled virus particles to sell.\" (b) The localized differentiations observed in the plasma membrane of the ML cells as well as their related invaginations and special cytoplasmic vesicles are morphologically identical with the formation reported by Roth and Porter (68) in hepatic cells and by de-~fh6 et al. (25) in blastlike elements in the thymus of chickens with myeloblastosis. We have recently observed similar structures in several other types of cells. These observations all suggest that such formations have a general significance in cell physiology. A dynamic interpretation provides two possibilities: they may represent different steps of a process of incorporation into the cell, or they may be related to a phenomenon of cellular excretion. Roth and Porter (68) , on the basis of their observations on the mosquito oocyte, concluded that the membrane differentiations and their infoldings are special sites for protein uptake. However, additional investigation is required to permit precise conclusions concerning the functional significance of these structures. For this purpose tissue cultured cells provide a good study system.",
