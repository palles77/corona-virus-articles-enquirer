Culture remains the gold standard of bacteriological diagnosis despite being moderately sensitive, time-consuming and expensive. Culturing also requires specific laboratory infrastructure as well as trained operators. Rapid antigen tests have been described to provide modest diagnostic sensitivity, particularly for vaccinated populations, but they can deliver results in minutes with relatively simple equipment and are less expensive than culture. Tests that are based on nucleic acid amplification (NAAT), such as PCR, are available for many infectious diseases. PCR techniques provide high accuracy with a time to results of few hours and allow multianalyte testing. However, these techniques involve performance of thermal cycling amplifications in high-precision instruments. Such equipment is bulky, expensive and complex to operate, requiring specially trained operators and stringent conditions of laboratory compartmentalization. All these factors constrain performance of PCR out of centralized laboratories.",

This technology is based on the strand-displacement activity of the Bst DNA polymerase, which avoids a continuous DNA amplification reaction. Four primers are necessary for the reaction: F3/B3, FIP/BIP (FIGURE 1A); additional LF/LB primers accelerate the reaction [15] (FIGURE 1B). This pool of primers combined with the restrictive annealing and a reaction temperature of 60-65\u02daC makes the reaction highly specific, allowing an 'amplification is detection' scheme in 15-60 min [16] . The common template for LAMP is DNA, but RNA template could also be detected by adding the reverse transcriptase together with DNA polymerase. This specific variant has been termed reverse transcriptase loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) [17] . White precipitates of magnesium pyrophosphate produced during LAMP reaction allow turbidimetric detection of DNA amplification by both qualitative visual methods and real-time quantitative turbidimetry [18] . Several detection methods such as intercalating fluorescence dyes [ LAMP does not need initial denaturation at 95\u02daC to allow strand separation, which is an interesting characteristic for POC applications. Nevertheless, higher levels of sensitivity (both analytical and diagnostic) have been obtained when including heating denaturation [26] with detection limits as low as one copy per reaction [27] .

The validation of a commercial loop-mediated isothermal amplification assay (TB-LAMP) for the detection of tuberculosis has been recently reported by Eiken and is expected to be launched into the market soon together with a kit for human African trypanosomiasis. The LAMP technology has also been implemented in the Illumigene (Meridian Bioscience, Cincinnati, OH, USA) assay for rapid diagnosis of Clostridium difficile, Mycoplasma pneumonia, Group A Streptococcus and Group B Streptococcus. In addition, Amplex Biosystems (Gie\u00dfen, Germany) have commercialized the eazyplex \u00d2 Super-Bug that detects carbapenemases antibiotic resistances (covering KPC, NDM, OXA-48, VIM and the Acinetobacter baumannii belonging Oxa-groups OXA-23 like, OXA-40 like and OXA-58 like) and the eazyplex SuperBug CRE, which also includes ESBL genes of CTX-M-1 and CTX-M-9 families. All these tests take between 15 and 30 min for results. It is also of interest to note that real-time PCR devices can be used for isothermal amplification and detection although less complex instruments are specifically aimed for this purpose. Among others, both Instrument Genie \u00d2 II (Optigene, Horsham, UK) and Instrument Genie III allow isothermal amplification and detection by fluorescence, whereas Ilumipro-10 (Meridian Bioscience, Cincinnati, OH) detects amplification products by turbidity.",

Since a first microfluidic disc for detection of hepatitis B virus reached an analytical sensitivity of about 50 copies per reaction within 60 min measured by turbidity [38] , a significant number of POC devices based on LAMP have been developed: that is, a multichannel microfluidic device based on LAMP turbidity with a need of only 0.4 ml for detection of the swine virus in less than 1 h [39] or a multiplex microfluidic RT-LAMP device able to distinguish three types of influenza A substrains with a detection limit of 20 copies per reaction in 30 min [40] . In a similar way, a colorimetric device based on a RT-LAMP assay has been reported to detect hepatitis E virus by visual detection with a limit of detection of 10 copies and low handling and equipment requirement [41] . Last year a completely automated POC device termed Microfluidic Biomolecular Amplification Reader was reported to process raw samples through combination of molecular, microfluidic, optical and electronic technologies. This battery-powered instrument, which uses light emitting diodes and phototransistors, is able to detect the HIV-1 integrase gen in 70 min [42] . Recently, a novel microfluidic biochip has been manufactured that integrates LAMP, line probes assay and giant magnetoresistive sensors, having high analytical sensitivity for hepatitis B virus detection (10 copies per ml -1 ) in 1 h [41] .",

Originally HDA process was performed through three different proteins (plus Polymerase): the DNA helicase, which unwinds the dsDNA, and two additional proteins (FIGURE 2) . Nevertheless, the new thermostable helicase Tte-UvrD from Thermoanaerobacter tengcongenesis is able to work at 65\u02daC, allowing more specific reactions without both MutL and SSB [44] . HDA amplification usually takes 60-120 min, at least for low-copy numbers, but possible modifications for optimization can be done [45] . Although only a single set of primers is needed for HDA, few multiplex HDA applications have been developed so far such as a duplex-detection of pathogens N. gonorrhoeae and Staphylococcus aureus by combining HDA with microarray-based detection [46] , and a 4-plex detection assay for four different genes from the same organisms [47] . HDA is compatible with diverse detection mechanisms like fluorescent detection [48] or electrochemical DNA detection with gold nanoparticles [49] .

This device, with pre-stored freeze-dried RPA reagents, has been described to allow detection of gene mecA of S. aureus in 20 min [61] . Novel development of digital RPA on a SlipChip indicates that RPA may potentially be fast and sensitive with low volumes [62] .",

This method seems to be strongly limited by the requirement of native restriction flanking the target sequence to be amplified [64] . By contrast, NEAR allows amplification of any target by adding restriction sites in flank regions. Only one strand is nicked in NEAR while, comparatively, SDA avoids the requirement of dATPaS (5\u00b4-O-l-thiotriphosphate) to prevent double-stranded cleavage [65] .

Interestingly, some methods such as LAMP, RCA and SMAP2 produce a continuous concatemeric DNA strand that could be useful for in situ detection. It is noteworthy that the majority of isothermal techniques have been attributed high analytical sensitivity within a range of 1-10 copies in previous studies, whereas SDA, ICAN and NEAR seem to be less sensitive. Nevertheless, since most evaluations have been performed at the development stage in academic laboratories, further studies on precommercial or available products should be undertaken to confirm these data. Certain techniques (LAMP, SMAP2, SDA, HDA, RPA and NEAR) appear to show mid-to-high tolerance to biological compounds and allow a low-or nonpretreated sample process. This could be an interesting characteristic for POC use and procedural simplicity. Denaturation is a previously needed step for some technologies as it obviously is for PCR. Since heating requirements at 95\u02daC for DNA extraction and denaturation are moderate, this factor may facilitate their integration into power-free POC instruments that would be particularly suitable for use in remote settings [55] . The integration of isothermal techniques into POC devices offers the advantages of simple instrumentation and the possibility of certain technologies to process raw samples, thus reducing costs of products and processes involved. However, most emerging isothermal near-POC or POC applications have only reached a proof-of-concept stage. Further evaluation studies are needed to determine their feasibility for commercialization.",

Because of their competitive advantages, isothermal technologies are likely to become reference chemistries for future POC applications and could gradually displace PCR-based solutions. Diverse isothermalbased technologies are tacking technical challenges at the micro-scale and finding their way to market. Low sample volume handling, low concentration of target, complex signal amplification due to Table 2 . low concentration, target instability and compatibility and integration of the various device subsystems have been identified as major hurdles for the development of POC assays. It appears that LAMP has reached a higher degree of maturity than other isothermal techniques to overcome such hurdles, according to the number of related developments and products. However, technical potentialities of LAMP or any other competing chemistries do not automatically guarantee their future adoption. In addition to further validation in clinical labs to obtain solid results, a range of cultural, organizational, economic and regulatory barriers may undermine successful deployment of diagnostics at the point of care, either isothermal or based on other technologies. One of the main challenges for effective implementation in the upcoming years will be to gain a positive perception from end users and healthcare providers. Since rapid diagnosis by POC assays alleviates patient anxiety and eliminates return visits for results, it appears that delivery of diagnosis on site will be well accepted by end users. However, acceptance of decentralized diagnostics by healthcare providers will imply important changes in clinical practices, workloads and logistics. New frameworks will need to be designed at the point of contact between the patient and the healthcare system to ensure adequate on-site sample collection, test performance and quality control of results [84] .",

Another challenge to be met in the near future will be to establish the final price for a POC test that is acceptable to payers, not only in terms of low cost but also of willingness to pay. It will be important to optimize costs of reagents, materials and systems of mass production and assembly of device components. Nonetheless, the final decision to purchase a POC test or a centralized laboratory test will not strictly be which test is cheapest or faster but rather the cost of the test needed to provide the desired clinical benefit [85] . On the other hand, future widespread use of POC devices will be constrained by nonharmonized regulatory conditions for commercialization of POC devices in diverse geographical markets, especially in Western countries.",

            "text": "Being aware that unexpected events may encourage or limit evolution toward near-patient diagnostics, we envision two scenarios where initial adoption of isothermal POC tests is more plausible within a timeframe of 5 years. Core laboratories, which are usually located in referral hospitals of industrialized countries, will presumably be the first market segment to be penetrated. Such environments are already familiarized with performance of PCR and other NAATs and can easily evaluate characteristics of isothermal POC solutions against current methods. Minor organizational changes may be needed for implementation of isothermal assays in specialized laboratories, but it will be fundamental that they prove to have sensitivity and specificity comparable to gold standard techniques for pathologies of complex etiology, most prevalent in referral hospitals. The demonstration of cost-effectiveness will also be required prior to adoption to ensure sustainability of diagnostic services. POC applications that would be best valued referral hospitals could be assays targeting diagnosis of time-critical, chronic or highly transmissible infections, as well as differential diagnosis of infections with common symptoms and different treatments and those requiring complex, toxic or expensive therapies. In a mid-term time, POC applications may be able to migrate from core laboratories to other areas within the referral hospital (emergency wards, intensive care units) and beyond (second-level hospitals, primary care), provided that they maintain diagnostic accuracy, rapidity and cost-effectiveness and allow use by nonspecifically trained personnel.",

            "text": "A second scenario for the implementation of POC testing in the next years will be the global health market. The WHO estimated that in 2008 resource-limited countries experienced 241 million cases of malaria, 2.8 million new infections with HIV, 7.8 million cases of reactivated TB and 217 million cases of bacterial pneumonia [86] . In fact, simple inexpensive POC tests based on antibody detection that are close to the 'ASSURED' ideal are already available in most developing countries in a lateral-flow or dipstick format (i.e., for the diagnosis of human immunodeficiency virus infection). It also needs to be highlighted that the majority of population in the developing world resides in remote rural areas, so patients often travel long distances to primary healthcare settings and thus may be unable to return for test results. Moreover, primary care infrastructures may have poor availability of trained technicians and limited electricity supply for equipment or refrigerators for the storage of reagents. Portable, extremely low-cost, very easy-to-use isothermal POC tests that provide rapid visual readouts with minimal instrumentation and reagents stable at room temperature would have wide acceptance in this scenario. In particular, it is expectable that mobile phones, which are prevalent in the developing world, will become fundamental complements of POC applications since they can contribute capabilities of battery-powered supply, readout and connectivity for transmission of results. The big size of the global health market and its urgent need for more accessible diagnostics offer attractive opportunities for manufacturers that have the ability to scale up POC applications and reduce prices. While margins may be low in the poorest countries, POC products may allow profitable commercialization in emerging middle-income countries. Those applications that target infections with a heavy burden on global health or that match with those occurring in developed countries may have higher potential for success in the short term.",
