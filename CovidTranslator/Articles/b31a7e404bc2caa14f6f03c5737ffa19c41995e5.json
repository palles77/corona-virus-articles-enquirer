Recombinant 3CL pro was expressed in Pichia pastoris GS115 as a 42 kDa protein that displayed a K m of 15 \u00b1 2 lM with Dabcyl-KTSAVLQSGFRKME-Edans as substrate. Purified 3CL pro was used for inhibition and kinetic assays with seven flavonoid compounds. The IC 50 of six flavonoid compounds were 47-381 lM. Quercetin, epigallocatechin gallate and gallocatechin gallate (GCG) displayed good inhibition toward 3CL pro with IC 50 values of 73, 73 and 47 lM, respectively. GCG showed a competitive inhibition pattern with K i value of 25 \u00b1 1.7 lM. In molecular docking experiments, GCG displayed a binding energy of -14 kcal mol -1 to the active site of 3CL pro and the galloyl moiety at 3-OH position was required for 3CL pro inhibition activity.",

It rapidly spread to over 32 countries in Asia, North America, and Europe. The mortality rate was approximately 10%, according to World Health Organization data. The causative agent of SARS is a novel human coronavirus (CoV), designated SARS-CoV. An efficient therapy and a vaccine are not currently available (Xu et al. 2005) . SARS-CoV is an enveloped positive single-stranded RNA virus (Rota et al. 2003 ) that encodes two proteases for proteolytic processing: a papain-like cysteine protease (PLP2 pro ) and a chymotrypsin-like cysteine protease (3C-like protease; 3CL pro ) located in the non-structural protein regions nsp3 and nsp5, respectively. Since 3CL pro is essential for the viral life cycle, it is an attractive target for the development of antiviral drugs directed against SARS-CoV and other CoV infections (Grum-Tokars et al. 2008) .",

Over 4,000 varieties of flavonoids have been identified (de Groot and Rauen 1998) . Flavonoids can act as potent antioxidants, and display anti-inflammatory, antiallergic, antihemorrhagic, antimutagenic, antineoplastic, and hepatoprotective activities (Tapas et al. 2008; de Groot and Rauen 1998) . In addition, flavonoids inhibit the catalytic activities of a great variety of enzymes, including hexokinase, phospholipase C, protein kinase C, a-glucosidase, and a-amylase. (Tadera et al. 2006) . Some flavonoid compounds such as quercetin, quercetin derivatives, catechin, epicatechin, epicatechin gallate and epigallocatechin gallate inhibit SARS-3CL pro expressed in Escherichia coli (Chen et al. 2005 (Chen et al. , 2006 Yi et al. 2004 ).

The gene encoding SARS 3CL pro polyprotein (amino acid residues 3,241-3,546, GenBank accession no. AY274119) (Benson et al. 2011) was optimized by replacing rare codons with high-frequency codons, which were selected on the basis of the findings for codons usage in Pichia pastoris ( Supplementary Fig. 1 ), and were synthesized and cloned in the pUC57 vector (pUC57-3CL) by a custom gene synthesis service (GenScript, Piscataway, NJ, USA). The 3CL pro gene was isolated from the vector pUC57-3CL by cutting with EcoRI and NotI, and was subcloned into the EcoRI/NotI restriction sites of the expression vector pPICZaA. The novel construct was named pPICZaA-3CL pro and transformed into E. coli DH5a (Promega, Madison, WI, USA) using a standard heat shock method. Transformants harbouring pPICZaA-3CL pro were selected from LB agar low salt medium [1% (w/v) Tryptone, 0.5% (w/v) yeast extract, 0.5% NaCl, pH 7.5] containing 25 lg Zeocin ml -1 (Invitrogen). Plasmid pPICZaA-3CL pro was amplified in E. coli DH5a, linearized by SacI digestion, and transformed into P. pastoris GS115 by a modified LiCl method. pPICZaA vector was also linearized by SacI digestion and transformed into P. pastoris GS115 as a negative control strain. Screening for positive clones was done by PCR with two sets of primers (Bioneer, Deajeon, Korea): set one contained 3CL pro primers [3CL-F (5 0 -GTGGATTCAGAAAAATGGCC-3 0 ) and 3CL-R (5 0 -CCGCCTGAAAAGTAACTCCT-3 0 )] and set two contained a-factor and 3AOX1 primers. The PCR conditions were 94\u00b0C for 5 min, followed by 25 cycles of 94\u00b0C for 1 min, 53\u00b0C for 30 s, 72\u00b0C for 1 min, and a final step of 72\u00b0C for 5 min. PCR was conducted using PCRmix and the PCR product was analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis.",

Inhibitor kinetic studies were performed for GCG, which was the best inhibitor against 3CL pro . The method was similar to those used in a kinetic study of the recombinant enzyme, except for the use of multiple concentrations of the inhibitor (0-60 lM) and variable concentrations of substrate (5-15 lM).

Docking files were prepared using AutoDock-Tools software (Sanner et al. 1996) . For the protein molecules, polar hydrogen atoms were added and nonpolar hydrogen atoms were merged. Kollman charges and solvation parameters were assigned by default. The threedimensional atomic coordinates of GCG were generated by the Corina program (Molecular Networks GmbH, Erlangen, Germany), Gasteiger charges were added and nonpolar hydrogen atoms were merged.

AutoDock version 3.0.5 software using the Lamarckian genetic algorithm (LGA) was used for the computational molecular docking simulation of flexible small molecules to rigid proteins with ligand and rigid proteins (Morris et al. 1998 ). Important docking parameters for the Lamarckian genetic algorithm were a population size of 250 individuals, maximum of 5 million energy evaluations, maximum of 27,000 generations, mutation rate of 0.02, crossover rate of 0.80, and 100 docking runs (each docking job produced 100 docked conformations). The probability of performing a local search on an individual in the population was set to 0.06 and the maximum number of iterations per local search was set to 300. The conformation with the lowest docked energy was chosen from the most populated cluster and was put through to the next stage.

This confirmed that the addition of an OH group at 5 0 -position of the B ring decreased the 3CL pro inhibitory activity. The effect of the structures of the A and C rings on the inhibitory activity was evaluated. Since AMPLS, which lacks the 2,3-double bonds in the C-ring, showed lower inhibitory activity than that of quercetin, 2,3-double bonds are probably crucially influential to the inhibitory activity. EGC lacking the C(4)=O in the C-ring, C(2)=C(3), containing 5 0 -OH group and lacking galloyl moiety showed the lowest inhibitory activity compared to that of AMPLS, daidzein, puerarin, quercetin, EGCG, or GCG.",

The active extracellular 3CL pro was successfully expressed and purified in P. pastoris GS115. Among the investigated flavonoids, GCG was the best inhibitor against 3CL pro by an in vitro assay. The structure and inhibition activity relationship among seven flavonoid compounds was also investigated. GCG showed numerous hydrophobic and H-bonds interaction with amino acid residues in the active site pocket of 3CL pro .",
