            "text": "Viruses are obligate intracellular parasites and this characteristic is exemplified by RNA viruses 1 . The genomes of RNA viruses are usually smaller than the genomes of DNA viruses, and RNA viruses are therefore more reliant on subverting host-cell proteins, and cellular structures and functions to facilitate virus replication. One structure that is targeted by RNA viruses is the nucleolus, a dynamic subnuclear structure. Most DNA viruses and retroviruses replicate in the nucleus, and therefore it makes sense that these viruses target nuclear structures. But as the primary site of replication of positive-strand RNA viruses and most negative-strand RNA viruses is the cytoplasm, the rationale for RNA viruses targeting nuclear structures is not immediately obvious. However, as discussed in this Review, recent research that capitalizes on advances in proteomics and cellular imaging techniques is beginning to increase our understanding of the mechanisms that RNA viruses use to subvert host-cell nucleoli.",

More detailed analysis of mammalian cells by electron microscopy indicated that the nucleolus could be divided into three discrete regions that reflect its primary role in ribosome subunit biogenesis 3 . These regions can be viewed as compartments formed by the functional association of macromolecules and comprise fibrillar centres, surrounded by dense fibrillar components, which in turn are surrounded by a granular component (FIG. 1) . The composition and structure of the nucleolus varies between different biological kingdoms. In mammalian cells the nucleolus is present during interphase but disintegrates and reforms in mitosis 4 . In yeast the nucleolus is present throughout the cell cycle and is proximal to the nuclear envelope. Plant-cell nucleoli have a fourth nucleolar structure, which has been referred to as a nucleolar vacuole or cavity 5 .",

            "text": "For many years the classic view of the nucleolus focused on its crucial function in ribosomal subunit biogenesis. Ribosomes are composed of a large and small subunit, which each contain their own ribosomal RNA (rRNA) molecules. In eukaryotes there are four different rRNA molecules (28S, 5S and 5.8S rRNAs in the large subunit and 18S rRNA in the small subunit) and >80 proteins. Transcription of the primary 45S pre-rRNA molecule from rDNA initiates in the fibrillar centre, and the nascent molecules are distributed in a 'Christmas tree'-like arrangement. Processing of the 45S pre-rRNA (into 5.8S, 18S and 28S rRNAs) occurs at, or near, the border between the dense fibrillar component and the fibrillar centre, and RNA assembly into ribosomal subunits occurs in the granular component before export into the cytoplasm. An additional feature is the perinucleolar compartment, which has also been implicated in RNA metabolism 6 and is associated with chromatin. Although studies of the nucleolus have focused on ribosomal precursor RNA, many other RNA species have been identified in the nucleolus including several precursor tRNA species and the signal-recognition particle 7 The nucleolus has also been proposed as a sensor of cellular stress, and one of the main molecules involved in this process is the tumour suppressor protein p53, which accumulates in the nucleus when cells are subjected to stressful stimuli, such as ultraviolet (UV) light and inhibitor molecules. For example, the inhibition of proteasome activity results in the accumulation of p53 in the nucleolus and its association with nucleolin 8 , and similar results have been found when cells are exposed to ionizing radiation 9 . Definitive experiments later showed that nucleolar disruption is a common factor in all stress responses that involve p53, and that impairment of nucleolar function leads to p53 stabilization 10, 11 .",

Although the number of nucleolar proteins identified has increased with the use of more sophisticated analytical techniques, the relative proportion of proteins in each functional class has remained the same 14, 15 . The interaction between different nucleolar proteins is central to coordinating the functions of this compartment. The multifunctional nature of nucleolar proteins and their numerous protein interactions illustrates an overriding principal of nucleolar architecture: that it is an amalgamation of many protein-protein and protein-nucleic-acid interactions, and disruption of these interactions can cause aberrant nucleolar function and possibly lead to disease 16 .",

The pat4 motif consists of a continuous stretch of (usually) four basic amino acids, and the pat7 motif starts with a proline residue and is followed by six amino acids, of which three of the last four are basic. As its name suggests, a bipartite signal contains two separate motifs, both of which are rich in basic amino acids. Protein nuclear-export signals (NESs) also vary, but one of the most common and well characterized NESs is an ~11 amino-acid, leucine-rich signal, typified by LX(2,3)LX(2,3)LXL, where several hydrophobic amino acids can substitute for leucine. The number of spacer residues (X) is indicated in brackets 19, 21 . By contrast, the signals that govern nucleolar localization and retention are not well defined 22 . The motifs involved are usually rich in arginine and lysine residues, however, there is no immediately obvious consensus sequence or structure. Presumably, proteins that localize to the nucleolus can also have nuclear-import and, if necessary, nuclear-export motifs. The nucleolar-localization signals (NoLSs) that have been identified so far can be grouped into those that contain single motifs and those that contain multiple motifs 23 . For example, single motifs include MQRKPTIRRKNLRLRRK identified in survivin-deltaEx3, a splice variant of the anti-apoptotic protein survivin 24 , and the RSRKYTSWYVALKR motif of fibroblast growth factor-2 (REF. 25 ). Alternatively, signals can take the form of an interaction between several functional domains of a protein, for example, in two components of the 60S ribosomal subunit -the human ribosomal L7a protein 26 and ribosomal protein L5 (REF. 27 ). Nucleolar localization can also be regulated by binding small effector molecules, such as nucleostemin binding to GTP 28 . Whether proteins localize, target, accumulate or are retained in the nucleolus is unknown, and the targeting signals that are associated with nucleolar proteins have been called not only NoLSs but also nucleolar-targeting signals and nucleolar-retention signals.",

Nucleolar localization of a protein can be governed by several factors, including whether the protein associates with another nucleolar-bound protein or alternatively traffics to the nucleolus on its own or associates with RNA transcripts that are being transcribed in the nucleolus.

The three most common techniques for visualizing the trafficking of nucleolar proteins are fluorescence recovery after photo-bleaching (FRAP), fluorescence loss in photo-bleaching (FLIP) and confocal microscopy of fixed cells. When used with cellular or viral nucleolar proteins that have been tagged with a fluorescent fusion protein (such as enhanced green fluorescent protein; EGFP) FRAP and FLIP allow measurements of dynamic trafficking. In FRAP analysis, a portion of the nucleolus (or the whole nucleolus) is irreversibly photo-bleached by a single, high-powered spot laser pulse. The recovery of the fluorescent signal in the bleached area is the consequence of movement of the EGFP-fusion protein back into the bleached area. This is recorded by sequential imaging scans, and the mobility of the protein can be calculated from the kinetics of fluorescence recovery (see the figure) . In FLIP analysis, a portion of, or a whole nucleolus, can be continuously photo-bleached in a manner similar to FRAP. In this way, the trafficking of several nucleolar proteins, including nucleolin, fibrillarin and B23.1, has been examined 3,112-115 .",

For many years it was believed that these findings were phenomenological, and that viral capsid and RNA-binding proteins might simply localize to the nucleolus because they diffuse through the nuclear-pore complex and associate with compartments in the nucleus that have high RNA contents, and therefore with the nucleolus because it is transcriptionally active. In this case, localization to the nucleolus would have no physiological consequences for the virus or the cell. However, RNAvirus replication is error prone and selection pressure might apply to such a fortuitous localization (given the ~700 nucleolar proteins and their diverse roles), with the concomitant effect that the virus could select for changes in its genome that ultimately disrupt nucleolar function or recruit nucleolar proteins to aid virus replication.",

The molecular mechanisms that are responsible for this effect are unknown, but the displacement and relocalization of nucleolar proteins by viral proteins could increase or decrease the nucleolar, nuclear or cytoplasmic pool of these proteins. Certainly, the accumulation of viral proteins in the nucleolus could potentially cause volume exclusion or crowding effects, which have been proposed to have a fundamental role in the formation of nuclear compartments including the nucleolus 51 . Therefore, disruption of nucleolar architecture and function might be common in virus-infected cells if viral proteins target the nucleolus or a stage of the virus lifecycle disrupts nucleolar proteins. For example, poliovirus infection results in the selective redistribution of nucleolin from the nucleolus to the cytoplasm 52 and inactivation of the nucleolar protein UBF (upstream binding factor), which shuts off RNA polymerase I transcription in the host cell 53 . The infection of cells with IBV has . The viral genome is therefore messenger sense and also functions as a template for the synthesis of negative-strand RNA. The RdRp uses the negative strand (or anti-genome) as a catalytic template for the production of new genomic RNA. Therefore, there is usually a molar excess (between 10:1 and 100:1) of positivestrand RNA over negative-strand RNA in infected cells. Positive-strand RNA viruses can either be enveloped or non-enveloped. However, they all produce capsid proteins for binding to viral RNA. These proteins have different names, including capsid, nucleocapsid and nucleoproteins, but all have similar functions. Negative-strand RNA viruses have a more complex life cycle in that the viral genome is not messenger sense and therefore the virus contains the enzymes needed to initiate the transcription of mRNAs and to facilitate replication 103 . been shown to disrupt nucleolar architecture 37 and cause arrest of the cell cycle in G2 and failure of cyto kinesis 36, 54, 55 . The IBV and arterivirus nucleocapsid proteins associate with nucleolin 55 and fibrillarin 56 , respectively. Similarly, the HIV-1 Rev protein has been shown to localize to the DFCs and GCs, and overexpression of Rev alters the nucleolar architecture and is associated with the accumulation of B23.1 (REF. 57 ). Rev overexpression also correlates with an increase in the proportion of cells in the G2 and M phases of the cell cycle and cells that have failed cytokinesis 57, 58 . Indeed, changes in nucleolar architecture have been observed in lymphocytes from patients infected with HIV-1 and this correlated with a loss of cell-cycle control 59 . From a therapeutic perspective, administering interleukin-2 can reverse the loss of cell-cycle control and might be a useful tool for HIV-1 therapy 60 .",

The nucleocapsid protein of the arterivirus porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) localizes to the nucleolus 41 and has been shown to contain two potential NLSs: a pat4 motif and a downstream pat7 motif 63 . Analysis revealed that a 31 amino-acid sequence that incorporates the pat7 motif could direct the nucleocapsid protein to both the nucleus and nucleolus 63 . The protein also contains a predicted NES, presumably to allow the protein to traffic back into the cytoplasm to contribute to viral function in that compartment 61 . Viral proteins might also traffic to the nucleolus through association with cellular proteins. For example, the hepatitis delta antigen has been shown to contain an NoLS that also corresponds to a site that promotes binding to nucleolin 64 .

Comparing the sequence of several different RNA virus NoLSs to the complete amino-acid sequence of the IBV nucleocapsid protein indicates that a basic amino-acid motif in the C-terminal region of the protein could be considered a candidate NLS and/or NoLS. Indeed, this signal is conserved in all coronavirus nucleocapsid proteins 35, 36, 65 and, on this basis, it was predicted that this motif would be involved in the pathogenesis of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) 65 . However, deletion and substitution mutagenesis revealed that an eight amino-acid motif located in the N-terminal region of the IBV nucleocapsid protein was necessary and sufficient for the protein to traffic to the nucleolus 66 , and the N-terminal and central region of the SARS-CoV nucleocapsid protein, rather than the C-terminal region, contained motifs which could function as both NLSs and NoLSs 38, 39, 67 .",

Such in vitro data have also been backed up by persuasive in vivo data.

This is one of the most complex cellular structures and is composed of >30 different proteins and, in mammalian cells, has a molecular weight of over 125 MDa. Small molecules -up to 50-60 kDa or less than 10 nm in diametercan diffuse passively through the NPC, but if proteins are larger than this size-exclusion limit and/or are required to move against a concentration gradient then transport requires energy-driven mechanisms. In this case, most proteins will contain the appropriate trafficking motifs such as nuclear-localization and nuclear-export signals. Nuclear-localization signals are recognized by proteins of the importin superfamily (importin \u03b1 and \u03b2) that mediate protein transport across the nuclear envelope using RanGTP. Nuclearexport signals are recognized by exportins. Internal ribosome entry site (IRES) . A structure that is located in the 5\u2032-untranslated region or open reading frame of some cellular and viral mRNAs. It mediates translation initiation independently of the mRNA cap structure by recruiting the ribosome directly to an internal position on the mRNA. could potentially be related to differences in nucleolar architecture 72 and proteomes between these cell types. The JEV core protein has been shown to interact with B23.1 and is translocated from the nucleolus to the cytoplasm 73 . Flaviviruses (such as JEV, dengue virus and West Nile virus) seem to have a nuclear stage to the synthesis of viral RNA, and several components of the viral replicase together with newly synthesized RNA have been found in the nucleus of infected cells 74 . One intriguing question is how such viral RNA traffics from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. Most cellular mRNAs are spliced, and the splicing process recruits proteins needed for efficient nuclear export 75 . Certain DNA viruses, such as herpesvirus saimiri, produce intron-less mRNA, and these viruses have evolved specific viral proteins (such as herpesvirus saimiri ORF57) 76 that interact with the cellular mRNA-export machinery (for example, the mRNA-processing and -export factor ALY) to transport viral mRNA from the nucleus to the cytoplasm 77, 78 , and a similar process might be used by RNA viruses. For example, in plants, tomato bushy stunt virus (TBSV) redistributes ALY from the nucleus to the cytoplasm, and this might be a way the virus mediates host-cell protein synthesis 79 . Also, in plants, RNA silencing, a host defence mechanism, targets viral RNAs for degradation in a sequence-specific manner, and plant viruses use several mechanisms to counteract this system. TBSV encodes a protein, P19, which interferes with this pathway. However, ALY might transport P19 from the cytoplasm to the nucleus or nucleolus and disrupt its silencing-suppressor activity 80 .",

Similar to the plant rhabdo virus maize fine streak virus (MFSV), the nucleocapsid and phosphoproteins of which localize to the nucleolus 83 , the animal negative-strand RNA virus Borna disease virus has been reported to use the nucleolus as a site for genome replication 85 , and its RNA-binding protein has the appropriate trafficking signals for import and export to and from the nucleus 86 . The RNA of the hepatitis delta virus genome is transcribed in the nucleolus 87 ; this is similar to the potato spindle tuber viroid, in which RNAs of opposite polarity are sequestered in different nuclear compartments, with the positive-sense RNA being transported to the nucleolus 88 .",

As nucleolar proteins have many crucial functions in cellular RNA biosynthesis, processing and translation it comes as no surprise that nucleolar proteins are incorporated into the replication and/or translation complexes formed by RNA viruses. Given that some nucleolar proteins have many functions, the same nucleolar protein might be used by a virus for different aspects of the replication pathway. One example of this is the interaction of nucleolin with picornaviruses. On the one hand, nucleolin has been shown to interact with the internal ribosome entry sites (IRESs) found in the 5\u2032 non-coding region of the poliovirus genome, and this interaction stimulates IRES-dependent translation (this also occurs with the hepatitis C virus (HCV) IRES) 89 . As their name suggests, IRES elements promote non-cap-dependent translation 90 . On the other hand, nucleolin has also been shown to interact with the poliovirus 3\u2032-non-coding region, which is involved in the regulation of negativestrand RNA synthesis and in the early events of virus infection 52 .",

HIV replication involves both cytoplasmic and nuclear steps and results in unspliced, single-spliced and multiple-spliced RNAs and about 15 to the nucleolus. The Rev protein exports partially or unspliced mRNA from the nucleus. Export is mediated in part by the exportin-1 nuclear-export pathway and interaction with the human Rev-interacting protein (hRIP) 99 . As for several other viral proteins that target the nucleolus, Rev was shown to contain a NoLS 100,101 that is distinct from the NLS 101 . Mutation of this signal prevented the subcellular localization of Rev to the nucleolus and also reduced the efficiency of its RNAexport function 101 . The structure of the nucleolus also seemed to be a key factor in the localization of Rev 102 . Rev has been reported to undergo multimerization in both the cytoplasm and the nucleolus, but fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) and FRAP studies have shown that Rev predominately forms multimers in the nucleolus 103 . Rev also binds to a cis-acting RNA element called the Rev-response element (RRE), which is found in all unspliced and incompletely spliced viral mRNAs, and this promotes the translocation of these mRNAs across the nuclear-pore complex.",

Similarly, the HIV Tat protein contains a NoLS 105 . Tat binds to a motif in HIV RNA known as the trans-activation response element (TAR).

This construct was introduced into HeLa CD4 + T cells and, when these cells were infected with HIV-1, replication of the virus was suppressed 108 . For therapy, this construct could be introduced into haematopoietic stems cells that have been removed from HIV-1-infected individuals, along with constructs carrying the TAR decoy and small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) to knockdown CCR5 (the co-receptor for HIV-1) 109 (FIG. 3) . Targeting CCR5 is a useful strategy 110 because siRNA-resistant viruses will (and do) occur; however, it should not be considered a stand-alone strategy as knockdown of the receptor is not 100%.

Our knowledge of the interaction between HIV and the nucleolus is leading to the design of novel therapeutic strategies, and has been pioneered by John Rossi's group. Although these approaches are currently targeted at patients with both AIDS and lymphoma they might be applicable to all individuals infected with HIV-1. Haematopoietic stem cells are taken from infected individuals and treated with lentiviral vectors that contain an anti-tat/rev short hairpin RNA (shRNA), an anti-CCR5 ribozyme and a nucleolar-localizing trans-activation response element (TAR) RNA decoy. TAR is a region of secondary RNA structure that is located within the HIV long terminal repeat and is present in all HIV mRNAs. The region prevents the efficient use of the mRNA unless it is bound by the HIV transactivator (Tat) protein. The engineered stem cells then form part of a bone marrow transplant back into the (now) irradiated individual. As a result T cells are produced that are resistant to HIV-1 infection.
