For this, they depended on the materia medica that was established by medicine men and priests from that era. This was followed by the origin of classical pharmacology in which the desirable therapeutic effects of small molecules were tested on intact cells or whole organisms. Later, the advent of human genome sequencing revolutionized the drug discovery process that developed into target\u00c0based drug discovery, also known as reverse pharmacology. This relies on the hypothesis that the modulation of the activity of a specific protein will have therapeutic effects. The protein that the drug binds to or interacts with is also referred to as a \"target.\" In this reductionist approach, small molecules from a chemical library are screened for their effect on the target's known or predicted function (Hacker et al., 2009) . Once the small molecule is selected for a particular target, further modifications are carried out at the atomic level to ameliorate the lock-and-key interactions. This one-drug/onetarget/one-therapeutic approach was followed for the last several decades.",

Advancements in omics technologies during this time were used to develop strategies for different phases of drug research (Buriani et al., 2012) . Computational power was implemented in the discovery process for predicting a drug-likeness of newly designed or discovered compounds and ligandprotein docking for predicting the binding affinity of a small molecule with a protein three-dimensional structure. In silico tools were developed to predict other pharmacological properties of the drug molecules such as absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion, and toxicity-abbreviated together as ADMET (van de Waterbeemd and Gifford, 2003; Clark and Grootenhuis, 2002) . The technological advancements triggered discovery efforts in a direction to discover more specific magic bullets that were completely against the holistic approach of traditional medicine. This magic bullet approach is currently in decline phase. The major limitations of this drug discovery approach are side effects and the inability to tackle multifactorial diseases. This is mainly due to the linearity of this approach.",

            "text": "During the peak, historical time of drug discovery and development of natural products\u00c0based drugs had played a significant role due to their superior chemical diversity and safety over synthetic compound libraries (Zimmermann et al., 2007) . Currently, it is estimated that more than one hundred new, natural product\u00c0based leads are in clinical development (Harvey, 2008) . Many active compounds (bioactives) from traditional medicine sources could serve as good starting compounds and scaffolds for rational drug design. Natural products normally act through modulation of multiple targets rather than a single, highly specific target. But in drug discovery and development, technology was used to synthesize highly specific mono-targeted molecules that mimic the bioactives from natural compounds rather than understanding the rationale behind their synergistic action and developing methods to isolate the bioactives from natural resources. Researchers understand that most diseases are due to dysfunction of multiple proteins. Thus, it is important to address multiple targets emanating from a syndrome-related, metabolic cascade, so that holistic management can be effectively achieved. Therefore, it is necessary to shift the strategy from one that focuses on a single-target, new chemical entity to one of a multiple-target, synergistic, formulation-discovery approach . This tempted the research world to go back and extensively explore natural sources, where modern pharmacology had begun. This renewed research focus indicates the need to rediscover the drug discovery process by integrating traditional knowledge with state-of-the-art technologies (Patwardhan, 2014a) .",

However, these efforts require some guidance for selecting the right type of targets and new scaffolds of drug molecules. Traditional knowledge can play a vital role in this process of formulation discovery and repurposing existing drugs. By combining advances in systems biology and NP, it might be possible to rationally design the next generation of promiscuous drugs (Cho et al., 2012; Hopkins, 2008; Ellingson et al., 2014) .

            "text": "The postgenomic era witnessed a rapid development of computational biology techniques to analyze and explore existing biological data. The key aim of the postgenomic biomedical research was to systematically catalogue all molecules and their interactions within a living cell. It is essential to understand how these molecules and the interactions among them determine the function of this immensely complex machinery, both in isolation and when surrounded by other cells. This led to the emergence and advancement of network biology, which indicates that cellular networks are governed by universal laws and offer a new conceptual framework that could potentially revolutionize our view of biology and disease pathologies in the 21st century (Barab\u00e1si and Oltvai, 2004) . During the first decade of the 21st century, several approaches for biological network construction were put forward that used computational methods, and literature mining especially, to understand the relation between disease phenotypes and genotypes. As a consequence, LMMA (literature mining and microarray analysis), a novel approach to reconstructing gene networks by combining literature mining and microarray analysis, was proposed (Li et al., 2006; Huang and Li, 2010) . With this, a global network was first derived using the literature\u00c0based, cooccurrence method and then refined using microarray data. The LMMA biological network approach enables researchers to keep themselves up to date with relevant literature on specialized biological topics and to make sense of the relevant large-scale microarray dataset. Also, LMMA serves as a useful tool for constructing specific biological network and experimental design. LMMA\u00c0like representations enable a systemic recognition for the specific diseases in the context of complex gene interactions and are helpful for studying the regulation of various complex biological, physiological, and pathological systems.",

            "text": "The significance of accumulated-data integration was appreciated by pharmacologists, and they began to look beyond the classic lock-and-key concept as a far more intricate picture of drug action became clear in the postgenomic era. The global mapping of pharmacological space uncovered promiscuity, the specific binding of a chemical to more than one target (Paolini et al., 2006) . As there can be multiple keys for a single lock, in the same way, a single key can fit into multiple locks. Similarly, a ligand might interact with many targets and a target may accommodate different types of ligands. This is referred to as \"polypharmacology.\" The concept of network biology was used to integrate data from DrugBank (Re and Valentini, 2013) and OMIM (Hamosh et al., 2005) , an online catalog of human genes and genetic disorders to understand the industry trends, the properties of drug targets, and to study how drug targets are related to disease-gene products. In this way, when the first drug-target network was constructed, isolated and bipartite nodes were expected based on the existed one-drug/one-target/onedisease approach. Rather, the authors observed a rich network of polypharmacology interactions between drugs and their targets (Yildirim et al., 2007 ). An overabundance of \"follow-on\" drugs that are drugs that target already targeted proteins was observed. This suggested a need to upgrade the singletarget single-drug paradigm, as single-protein single-function relations are limited to accurately describing the reality of cellular processes.",

According to network biology, simultaneous modulation of multiple targets is required for modifying phenotypes. Developing methods to aid polypharmacology can help to improve efficacy and predict unwanted off-target effects.",

This can be expanded in the future and lead to customized and personalized therapeutics. Integration of network biology and polypharmacology can tackle two major sources of attrition in drug development such as efficacy and toxicity.

The change in metabolism, bioavailability, and pharmacokinetics of formulation as well as safety would be the major concerns of this approach. The third strategy was to design a single compound with selective polypharmacology. According to Hopkins, the third method is advantageous, as it would ease the dosing studies. Also, the regulatory barriers for the single compound are fewer compared to a formulation. An excellent example of this is metformin, the first-line drug for Type II diabetes that has been found to have cancerinhibiting properties (Leung et al., 2013) .",

A computational framework, based on a regression model that integrates human protein\u00c0protein interactions, disease phenotype similarities, and known gene\u00c0phenotype associations to capture the complex relationships between phenotypes and genotypes, has been proposed. This was based on the assumption that phenotypically similar diseases are caused by functionally related genes. A tool named CIPHER (Correlating protein Interaction network and PHEnotype network to pRedict disease genes) has been developed that predicts and prioritizes disease-causing genes (Wu et al., 2008) . CIPHER helps to uncover known disease genes and predict novel susceptibility candidates. Another application of this study is to predict a human disease landscape that can be exploited to study the related genes for related phenotypes that will be clustered together in a molecular interaction network. This will facilitate the discovery of disease genes and help to analyze the cooperativity among genes. Later, CIPHER-HIT, a Hitting-Time-based method to measure global closeness between two nodes of a heterogeneous network, was developed (Yao et al., 2011) . A phenotype\u00c0genotype network can be explored using this method for detecting the genes related to a particular phenotype. A net-work\u00c0based gene clustering and extension were used to identify responsive gene modules in a condition\u00c0specific gene network aimed to provide useful resources to understand physiological responses (Gu et al., 2010) .",

This indicates the potential of NP to better understand the power of botanical formulations and to develop efficient and economical treatment options. The holistic approach of botanical formulations can be better explained by NP. A study has reported this property by exemplifying a TCM formulation against viral infectious disease . Not only does the formulation target the proteins in the viral infection cycle, but it also regulates the proteins of the host defense system; thus, it acts in a very distinctive manner. This unique property of formulations is highly efficient for strengthening the broad and nonspecific antipathogenic actions. Thus, network-based, multitarget drugs can be developed by testing the efficacy of the formulation, identifying, and isolating the major bioactives and redeveloping a multicomponent therapeutic using the major bioactives based on synergism (Leung et al., 2013) . NP also serves to document and analyze the clinical prescriptions of traditional medicine practitioners .

The constituent chemicals of the formulation were identified using an ultraperformance liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization-tandem mass spectrometry method. The known targets of those identified 48 compounds were mined from literature and putative targets that were predicted with the help of computational tools.

According to the addition and subtraction theory, the addition or removal of one or more ingredients from a traditional formulation resulted in a modified formula that plays a vital role in individualized medicine. Compounds from additive herbs were observed to be more efficient on disease\u00c0associated targets (Fig. 5.2) . These additive compounds were found to act on 93 diseases through 65 drug targets (Li et al., 2014a) . Experimental verification of the antithrombotic network of Fufang Xueshuantong (FXST) capsule was done through in vivo studies on lipopoly-saccharide\u00c0induced disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) rat model. It was successfully shown that FXST significantly improves the activation of the coagulation system through 41 targets from four herbs (Sheng et al., 2014) . NP analysis of the Bushenhuoxue formula showed that six components-Rhein, Tanshinone IIA, Curcumin, Quercetin and Calycosin-Acted through 62 targets for the treatment of chronic kidney disease. These predictions were validated using unilateral ureteral obstruction models, and it was observed that even though the individual botanicals showed a significant decrease in creatinine levels, the combination showed lower blood creatinine and urea nitrogen levels (Shi et al., 2014) . The antidiabetic effects of Ge-Gen-Qin-Lian decoction were investigated using an insulin secretion assay, and an insulin\u00c0resistance model using 13 of the 19 ingredients showed antidiabetic activity using NP studies (Li et al., 2014b) . To confirm the predictions of the network of Liu-Wei-Di-Huang pill, four proteins-PPARG, RARA, CCR2, and ESR1-that denote different functions and are targeted by different groups of ingredients were chosen. The interactions between various bioactives and their effect on the expression of the proteins showed that the NP approach can accurately predict these interactions, giving hints regarding the mechanism of action of the compounds (Liang et al., 2014) . Experimental results confirmed that the 30 core ingredients in Modified Simiaowan, obtained through network analysis, significantly increased HUVEC viability and attenuated the expression of ICAM-1 and proved to be effective in gout treatment (Zhao et al., 2015) .

Further information such as target-related diseases, tissue distribution and pathways are also to be collected depending on the type of study that is going to be undertaken. The Universal Natural Products Database (UNPD) (Gu et al., 2013a ) is one of the major databases that provides bioactives information. Other databases that provide information regarding bioactives include CVDHD (Gu et al., 2013b) , TCMSP (Ru et al., 2014) , TCM@Taiwan (Sanderson, 2011) , SuperNatural (Banerjee et al., 2015) , and Dr. Dukes's phytochemical and ethnobotanical database (Duke and Beckstrom-Sternberg, 1994) . The molecular structures of bioactives are usually stored as \"SD\" files and chemical information as smiles and inchkeys in these databases. Any of these file formats can be used as inputs to identify the targets in protein information databases. Binding database or \"Binding DB\" (Liu et al., 2007) and ChEMBL (Bento et al., 2014) are databases for predicting target proteins. Binding DB searches the exact or similar compounds in the database and retrieves the target information of those compounds. The similarity search gives the structurally similar compounds with respect to the degree of similarity as scores to the queried structure. The information regarding both annotated and predicted targets can be collected in this way. This database is connected to numerous databases, and these connections can be used to extract further information regarding the targets. The important databases linked to binding DB are UniProt (Bairoch et al., 2005) , which gives information related to proteins and genes; Reactome, a curated pathway database (Croft et al., 2011) ; and the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG), a knowledge base for systematic analysis of gene functions and pathways (Ogata et al., 1999) .",

In pharmacological networks, the nodes include bioactives, targets, tissue, tissue types, disease, disease types, and pathways.

Building a network involves two opposite approaches: a bottom-up approach on the basis of established biological knowledge and a top-down approach starting with the statistical analysis of available data. At a more detailed level, there are several ways to build and illustrate a biological network. Perhaps the most versatile and general way is the de novo assembly of a network from direct experimental or computational interactions, e.g., chemical/gene/protein screens. Networks encompassing biologically relevant nodes (genes, proteins, metabolites), their connections (biochemical and regulatory), and modules (pathways and functional units) give an authentic idea of the real biological phenomena (Xu and Qu, 2011) .",

In addition to Cytoscape, a number of visualization tools are available. Visual network pharmacology (VNP) , which is specially designed to visualize the complex relationships among diseases, targets, and drugs, mainly contains three functional modules: drug-centric, target-centric, and disease-centric VNP. This disease-target-drug database documents known connections among diseases, targets, and the USFDA-approved drugs. Users can search the database using disease, target, or drug name strings; chemical structures and substructures; or protein sequence similarity, and then obtain an online interactive network view of the retrieved records. In the obtained network view, each node is a disease, target, or drug, and each edge is a known connection between two of them. The Connectivity Map, or the CMap tool, allows the user to compare gene-expression profiles. The similarities or differences in the signature transcriptional expression profile and the small molecule transcriptional response profile may lead to the discovery of the mode of action of the small molecule. The response profile is also compared to response profiles of drugs in the CMap database with respect to the similarity of transcriptional responses. A network is constructed and the drugs that appear closest to the small molecule are selected to have better insight into the mode of action.",

This is because the bioactives form the foundation of any traditional medicine network. 2. Absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion, and toxic effects (ADMET) parameters associated with the bioactives/formulation when they are administered in the form of the medicine need to be considered in order to extrapolate in silico and cheminformatics data to in vitro and in vivo models. In silico tools that offer the prediction of these parameters can be depended on for this. But traditional medicines are generally accompanied by a vehicle for delivery of the medicine. These vehicles, normally various solvents-water, milk, lemon juice, butter, ghee (clarified butter), honey-that alter the solubility of the bioactives, play a role in regulating ADMET parameters. Experimental validation studies are required to evaluate this principle of traditional medicine. 3. Target identification usually relies on a single or a few databases due to the limited availability of databases with free access. This can occasionally give incomplete results. Also, there may be novel targets waiting to be discovered that could be a part of the mechanism of action of the bioactives. To deal with this discrepancy in the network, multiple databases should be considered for target identification. Integration of databases serving similar functions can also be a solution for this problem. In addition to this, experimental validation of the target molecules using protein\u00c0protein interaction studies or gene expression studies will provide concrete testimony to the network predictions. 4. A number of traditional medicines act through multiple bioactives and targets. Synergy in botanical drugs helps to balance out the extreme pharmacological effects that individual bioactives may have. The interactions of bioactives with various target proteins, their absorption into the body after possible enzyme degradation, their transport, and finally their physiological effect are a crucial part of traditional medicine (Gilbert and Alves, 2003) . However, in vitro assays or in silico tools are unable to give a clear idea as to the complete and exact interactions in a living organism. NP is only the cardinal step toward understanding the mechanism of bioactives/formulations. But this gives an overview of the action of traditional medicine which can be used to design in vivo experiments and clinical trials. This saves time and cost of research and inventions. 5. It is observed that formulations are working by simultaneous modulation of multiple targets. This modulation includes activation of some targets and inhibition of other. In order to understand this complex synergistic activity of formulation, investigative studies regarding the interactions of ligands with targets are to be carried out. This can be achieved by implementing high-throughput omics studies based on the network data.",

The data synthesis using NP provides information regarding the mode of action of traditional medicine formulations, based on their constituent bioactives. This is a kind of reverse approach to deduce the molecular mechanism of action of formulations using modern, integrated technologies. The current network analysis is based on the studies that have been conducted and the literature that is available. Hence, the data is inconclusive as a number of studies are still underway and novel data is being generated continuously. Despite its limitations, this still is a favorable approach, as it gives insight into the hidden knowledge of our ancient traditional medicine wisdom.

Moreover, the botanicals that undergo certain preparatory procedures during the formulation of the medicine may have its constituents that have chemically changed due to the procedures; like boiling, acid/ alkali reactions, interactions between the bioactives, etc. A way to navigate around this problem is to make use of modern, high-throughput chemical identification techniques like ultra-performance liquid chromatogra-phy\u00c0electrospray ionization\u00c0tandem mass spectroscopy (UPLC-ESI-MS/MS).
