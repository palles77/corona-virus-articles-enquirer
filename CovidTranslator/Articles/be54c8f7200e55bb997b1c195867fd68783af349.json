These included previously described protein-and lipid-based antigenic targets and newly discovered autoimmunogenic sugar moieties, notably, autoantibodies specific for the oligomannoses in both MS patient CSF and the sera of mice with EAE. These glycans are often masked by other sugar moieties and belong to a class of cryptic autoantigens. We further determined that these targets are highly expressed on multiple cell types in MS and EAE lesions. Co-immunization of SJL/J mice with a Man9-KLH conjugate at the time of EAE induction elicited highly significant levels of anti-Man9-cluster autoantibodies. Nevertheless, this antiglycan autoantibody response was associated with a significantly reduced clinical severity of EAE.",

            "text": "Evaluation of autoantibodies in autoimmune diseases has been enabled by development of new technologies, e.g., microarray-based large-scale auto-antibody profiling [Robinson et al., , 2003 Wang et al., 2002; Kanter et al., 2006; Beyer et al., 2012] . Robinson et al. developed \"myelin proteome\" microarrays to profile the evolution of autoantibody responses in an EAE model [Robinson et al., 2003] and found that the diversity of autoantibody responses increased as the disease evolved from acute to chronic relapsing EAE. Chronic EAE was associated with extensive intra-and intermolecular epitope spreading of autoreactive B-cell responses. Using human recombinant protein microarrays to examine auto-antibody profiles in the CSF of patients with relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS) led to the identification of a panel of proteins as possible differentiators between RRMS and other neurological diseases (OND) that warranted further investigation [Beyer et al., 2012] . Kanter et al. developed lipid arrays to monitor autoantibody responses against lipids present in the myelin sheath, including ganglioside, sulfatide, cerebroside, sphingomyelin, and total brain lipid fractions [Kanter et al., 2006] . This technology was applied to monitor lipidspecific antibody responses in CSF samples from individuals with MS and controls [Kanter et al., 2006; Ho et al., 2012] . These studies showed lipid-specific antibodies against sulfatide, sphingomyelin, and oxidized lipids in the CSF of MS patients. Sulfatide-specific antibodies were also detected in SJL/J mice with acute EAE. They further demonstrated that immunization of mice with sulfatide plus myelin peptide produced a more severe disease course of EAE, and administration of sulfatide-specific antibody exacerbated EAE. Thus, autoimmune responses to sulfatide and other lipids are present in individuals with MS and in EAE and may contribute to the pathogenesis of autoimmune demyelination.",

            "text": "Carbohydrates represent another class of antigenic structures with unique immunological properties [Wang and Kabat, 1996; Wang, 2004] . In brain, the myelin sheath and other tissues contain numerous sugar moieties, either in the form of glycolipids or as glycoproteins. Expression of brain carbohydrate, including mannosyl glycans, can be developmentally and/or differentially regulated [Schachter, 1991; Yuen et al., 1997; Chai et al., 1999a Chai et al., , 1999b Michele and Campbell, 2003; Breloy et al., 2012a Breloy et al., , 2012b Pacharra et al., 2012] . Some carbohydrates that exist intracellularly as part of the process of protein glycosylation are masked by other sugar moieties when the mature glycoproteins are released extracellularly [Brooks et al., 2002] . Such \"cryptic\" carbohydrates are, however, potentially immunogenic [Calarese et al., 2003; Wang and Lu, 2004; Newsom-Davis et al., 2009; Walker et al., 2011] . For example, HIV-1 virions [Calarese et al., 2003; Walker et al., 2011] and certain tumors [Newsom-Davis et al., 2009; Wang, 2012b; Wang et al., 2013] abnormally express N-glycan high-mannose (Man9) clusters. HIV-infected subjects [Trkola et al., 1996; Walker et al., 2011] and some cancer patients [Wang, 2012b; Wang et al., 2013] develop anti-oligomannose autoantibody responses. These observations prompted us to ask whether MS/EAE-associated autoantibody responses can also target this class of cryptic autoantigens.",

A practical approach was to incubate the printed microarrays with antibodies, receptors, or lectins known to react with the printed substance. As illustrated in Figure 1 , we examined preservation of Galanthus nivalis agglutinin (GNA)-specific glycoepitopes ( Fig. 1A -C) or 2G12-specific glyco-epitopes ( Fig. 1A , B, and D) by staining the spotted antigen arrays using corresponding probes. This demonstrated that the GNAepitopes were presented by three glyco-conjugates, i.e., Man9-cluster (4 # ), M9_2G12-cluster (3 # ), and Man5-9 RB (1 # ). In contrast, 2G12-glyco-epitopes were well-preserved only by one of the three, i.e., M9_2G12-cluster (3 # ), in this microarray substrate.",

The carbohydrate antigens that display N-glycan cryptic glyco-epitopes, e.g., AGOR (5 # ), ASOR (6 # ), and mannose clusters (1 # , 3 # , and 4 # ) [Wang, 2004 [Wang, , 2012b Newsom-Davis et al., 2009; Wang et al., 2013] were included for microarray spotting (Figs. 3 and 4) .

The colored needles that link the pairs of group means provide a global comparison of the antibody profiles between the MS group (red circles) and the OND group (blue crosses).

Specifically, we normalized microarray data sets by setting their IQR to be identical using the JMP-Genomics software package. This statistical operation effectively \"quenches\" the variation seen between subjects that is due to variable antibody concentrations in the CSF. The two groups illustrate similar Ig-RAR profiles for both IgG and IgM antibody activities (Fig. 3C  and D) .

Therefore, we examined MS-and EAE-affected CNS tissues to determine whether they abnormally expressed high-mannose cluster-related carbohydrates. We applied lectins of known specificities to monitor expression of various N-glycan complex carbohydrates in MS and normal control brain tissue samples and in spinal cords of EAE mice (Fig. 5) . The following three lectins were applied: (i) GNA, specific for the mannose-clusters; (ii) Phaseolus vulgaris-L (PHA-L), specific for Tri-II and m-II clusters; and (iii) Sambucus nigra I agglutinin (SNA-I), recognizing \u03b12-6 linked Neu5Ac residues. The results of this study were: A) GNA: In normal human cerebral cortex (Fig. 5, A0) , only the cytoplasm of neurons (red arrows) was stained. In an inflammatory MS lesion (A1), GNA stained a number of cell types, including cells with the morphological appearance of macrophages and reactive astrocytes (small red arrow). A dystrophic axon was also strongly positive (upper right corner, thick red arrow). In an acute inflammatory EAE lesion (A2), GNA stained many dystrophic axons (e.g., thick red arrow) and macrophage debris (e.g., thin red arrow). There was no positive staining in the spinal cords of control mice (data not shown). B) PHA-L: In normal human cerebral cortex (B0), PHA-L staining was negative. In an active MS lesion (B1), there was diffuse weak PHA-L staining. In the EAE lesion (B2), PHA-L staining was negative. C) SNA: SNA demonstrated positive staining of capillary endothelial cells in normal human cerebral cortex (C0) (red arrows). In the active MS lesion (C1), SNA selectively stained cells that were morphologically consistent with reactive microglia, (e.g., thick red arrow), as well as endothelial cells (small red arrows) (C1). In the EAE lesion (C2), SNA stained macrophage debris and endothelial cells (red arrows). In normal mice, SNA staining was limited to endothelial cells (data not shown).",

In the present study, we co-immunized SJL mice with Man9-KLH together with myelin peptide PLP 139-151. If the high-mannose-clusters were immunogenic, this immunization strategy should elicit antibodies targeting oligomannose antigens and if the anti-carbohydrate antibodies were pathogenic, induction of these antibodies should worsen the disease course. This in vivo validation experiment was conducted twice with similar outcomes.

The specificities of the anti-mannose cluster autoantibodies detected in EAE were strikingly similar to those in the CSF of MS patients. Specifically, both EAE-derived and MS-d erived anti-oligomannose antibodies were similarly reactive with the two Man9-clusters, M9_2G12-clusters (3 # ) and Man9-cluster (4 # ). As illustrated in Figure 1B , the former is a Man9-tetramer conjugate and the latter a Man9-monomer conjugate. This binding profile is similar to lectin GNA (Fig. 1C) but differs from the binding profile of a human monoclonal antibody 2G12 (Fig. 1D) in our microarray assays. The antibody 2G12 is well characterized as an unusual, domain-exchanged IgG1 recognizing the Man\u03b1(1,2)Man moieties in dense cluster configurations of high-mannose type N-glycans as displayed on the outer domain of HIV gp120 glycoprotein [Calarese et al., 2003] . In our microarrays, 2G12 was highly reactive with the M9_2G12 cluster in [(Man9)4]n-cluster configuration, but only weakly reactive with Man9-cluster in the (Man9)n-configuration (Fig. 1D ). In contrast, lectin GNA was strongly and equally reactive with the two oligomannose-conjugates (Fig. 1C) . Thus, the binding specificities of the MS and EAE-associated anti-oligomannose autoantibodies overlap with the binding profile of GNA.",

Further investigation will elucidate the physiological and/or pathological roles of anti-mannose cluster autoantibodies. Whether autoantibodies can play \"Janus-like\" opposing roles as CD47 does in autoimmune brain inflammation [Han et al., 2012] is under consideration.

Notably, human serum IgM antibodies specific for a number of glucosyl targets have been investigated for MS diagnosis and prognosis [Schwarz et al., 2003 [Schwarz et al., , 2006 Brettschneider et al., 2009] . These include GAGA4 [Glc(\u03b11,4)Glc(\u03b1)], GAGA6 [Glc(\u03b11,6)Glc(\u03b1)], GAGA3 [Glc(\u03b11,3)Glc(\u03b1)], and GAGA2 [Glc(\u03b11,2)Glc (\u03b1)]. In the present study, we tested a panel of glucose polysaccharides, including dextran preparations of N279, B1299S, and B1355S [Wang and Kabat, 1996] . Dextran N279 predominantly displayed \u03b1(1,6)-internal chain epitopes, i.e., repetitive units of GAGA6 [Glc(\u03b11, 6)Glc(\u03b1)]n as linear chains. B1299S was heavily branched and displays many terminal nonreducing end epitopes of [Glc(\u03b11,6)Glc(\u03b1)]n. B1355S was characterized by \u03b1(1,3)\u03b1(1,6)linkages, which may present the GAGA3 [Glc(\u03b11,3)Glc(\u03b1)]-moieties as both internal and terminal epitopes. However, this pilot study was limited in sample sizes, and it is difficult to conclude whether antibodies for these polysaccharides were significantly enriched in the CSF of MS subjects (Fig. 4C ).",

CSF samples from 11 MS (10 RRMS and 1 SPMS) and 9 OND subjects were characterized using microarrays spotted with 12 lipid and 20 carbohydrate antigens. Each preparation was spotted in triplicate at 2-4 dilutions. As illustrated in the overlay plots (A-D), this microarray supports detection of 126 unique antibody signatures. These included 63 IgG (A and C) and 63 IgM (B and D) signatures. Anti-human IgG or IgM secondary antibodies were used to reveal the antigen-specific antibodies detected by these microarrays. The captured IgG were stained with an anti-human IgG antibody conjugated with Cy3 at 2 \u03bcg/ml and the captured IgM in the same array revealed by a biotinylated anti-human IgM secondary antibody at 2 \u03bcg/ml and developed with Streptavidin-Cy5 conjugate at 2 \u03bcg/ml. Microarray data sets in A and B were processed as described in legend to Figure 1 and illustrated as microarray scores. In C and D, microarray data sets were further processed using JMP-Genomics to produce *RAR scores. The results are presented as overlay plots of the mean microarray scores for each group. The colored needles that link the group means of each pair of the scores provide a global comparison of antibody profiles of MS group (circles) and OND (crosses). *RAR Score: RAR-Relative Antibody Reactivity, the value of log2 transformed and IQR-standardized microarray value (Mean-background). For each antigen in a given concentration, the mean value of triplicate array detections was calculated.",

(A) Volcano plot analysis of the RAR scores of all antibody signatures. In the volcano plot, each point represents a biologically unique feature captured by the microarray, i.e., a normalized difference for a specific antibody signature (RAR MS -RAR OND ). The xaxis is the normalized difference (log2 scale); the y-axis is \u2212log10 (P-value), which weights the levels of significance of a difference. Points above the dashed line (cutoff level 2.5) represent signatures that differ significantly between the groups based on the Bonferroni test. Two signatures, M9_2G12_IgG and Man9_IgG, were identified by this critical statistical test as highly significant markers. In B and C, One-way analysis was performed to compare group means among the selected carbohydrate antigens listed in each panel. Each point in the panels represents the mean value (RAR score) of triplicate array detection of a subject. The means are shown as bars and standard deviations as diamonds around the mean value. The comparison circles for Student's \"t\"-test appear to the right of the mean diamonds to illustrate the significance of the differences among the means. By graphically showing the intersections, these circles allow visual inspection of the significance of differences. The more the circles intersect, the less significant their difference, and vice versa.

CNS tissues were stained with biotinylated lectins and developed with Streptavidin-HRP conjugate and DAB substrate. Lectins were pre-titrated and applied at 10 \u03bcg/ml for tissue staining. Column A, B, and C were stained with lectin GNA, PHA-L and SNA respectively. Normal: A0, B0, and C0; MS: A1, B1, and C1; EAE: A2, B2, and C2.
