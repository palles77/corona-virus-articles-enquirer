This study examines the making of new regionalism in South China, using the case of Hong KongeShenzhen region. By tracing the process of Hong Kong and Shenzhen integration during the past three decades, the research finds three stages in Hong KongeShenzhen regionalization after the late 1970s, namely, the emergence of informal regional society from below, the transitional regional society and formal regional society, with reference to Hettne's concept of regionness. Hong Kong's internal economic, political and societal difficulties and external changing conditions are conducive to Hong Kong government's re-regulation toward a more positive stance on cross-boundary regionalization. Although intense economic and social interactions exist between Hong Kong and Shenzhen, a cross-boundary regional community has not emerged yet. The slow development of cross-boundary regional community is different from European case. The active participation of the governments aims to facilitate crossboundary economic and infrastructure development and planning. This can take place well before reaching higher level of regionness: the formation of a regional community or the regional institutionalized polity.",

The boundaries of regions have become open, fuzzy or elastic, leading to the emergence of cross-border regions across state borders. The dramatic spatial restructuring spurs the emergence of new forms of regional governance, such as urban networks and cross-border partnership, in response to challenges posed by globalization (Arndt, Gawron, & Jahnke, 2000; Heeg, Klagge, & Ossenbr\u00fcgge, 2003; Katz, 2000) . The politicaleconomic geography of world cities extends well beyond the jurisdictional reach of the local state to reconfigure politicale territorial alliances on multiple scales of their host states (Brenner, 1999; Church & Reid, 1996; Vogel et al., 2010) .",

A crossboundary Hong KongeShenzhen metropolis is emerging as a new economic space under the institution framework of \"one country, two systems\" (OCTS) (Yang, 2005a; Shen, 2008a) . This paper aims to explore the evolution of regionalization in Hong KongeShenzhen cross-boundary region using the new regionalism approach. It needs to clarify some concepts first e regionalization, integration, regionalism, new regionalism and regional cooperation. In the literature, regionalization means the formation of regional groupings and is an advanced stage of regional integration. The process of regionalization can be understood in two dimensions e economic integration and politicaleinstitutional integration (Higgott, 1997; Sasuga, 2004) . Economic integration means enhanced economic relations while politicaleinstitutional integration means the establishment of formal politicaleinstitutional arrangements especially at the governmental level. (Old)Regionalism was a \"state-led phenomenon, which simplified the definition of the macro-region into being a result from some sort of cooperation between a group of contiguous states (Hettne, 2003, p. 23 )\". In contrast, new regionalism stresses an open and multi-dimensional system in which multiple (state and non-state) actors participate in regional projects (So, 2006) . Similarly, regional cooperation means economic and/or institutional partnership and is an important part of regionalization.",

In the literature, Hong KongeShenzhen integration, and Hong KongePRD regional integration in general, is understood both from the economic and political dimensions. On the economic dimension, Hong KongeShenzhen/PRD integration has been well documented in the literature from various perspectives including the new international division of labor, international commodity chains, cross-border production networks, social networks based on kinship ties (Leung, 1993; Lin, 1997; Shen, 2003; Sit, 1998) . The market players played a critical role in Hong KongeShenzhen economic integration in the form of crossboundary investment during the past three decades (Shen, 2008a; Yang, 2005a) . In recent years, increasing attention has been directed to the political or institutional dimension of regionalization. These studies include the changing relationship between Hong Kong and the PRD/Shenzhen (Shen, 2008b) , the multi-level governance in the cross-boundary region (Yang, 2005b) , the role of Hong Kong government in the cross-boundary urban governance (Shen, 2004 (Shen, , 2008a . Between above spectrum, Sum examined the sub-regionalism of Greater China from the integrated perspective of economic and political dimensions (Sum, 2001 (Sum, , 2002a (Sum, , 2002b . She investigated cross-scale regionalization of Greater China by introducing two concepts e \"time-space envelopes\" (TSEs) and \"time-space governance\" (TSG). She argued that the close connection between the geo-economic and nationalist TSEs was the dominating force underlying the rise of Greater China's subregional model of growth (Sum, 2001) . These studies facilitate our understanding of regionalization in Hong KongePRD/Shenzhen region.",

Regionalization in Hong KongeShenzhen region has its own unique evolutionary logic, proceeding from informal regional society from below to the transitional regional society and formal regional society. Hong KongeShenzhen regionalization has not reached the level of regional community. There is no agenda either to merge the two cities to form a full regional institutionalized polity in Hong KongeShenzhen region which is a significant departure from the EU (European Union). External forces also play a more important role than in the EU. This paper will focus on the following questions. What is the status of Hong KongeShenzhen integration or Hong Konge Shenzhen cross-boundary metropolis? What is the role of nation/ city state in the making of Hong KongeShenzhen region? The next section reviews the theory of new regionalism to provide a theoretical background for this study. The research methodology is introduced in the following section. The making of new regionalism in Hong KongeShenzhen region is examined in section four to six, by analyzing three different stages of regionalization and the role of internal actors and external forces in the process. In next section examines the status and prospect of forming a cross-boundary regional community. Theoretical implications are discussed in the concluding section.",

Regional formation is seen as a dialectic outcome of society, market and state interactions. Polanyi (1957) argued that there are \"double movements\", the expansion and deepening of the market system (the first movement) is followed by a political intervention (the second movement) in defense of society. The double movement thesis emphasizes contraction and change in the regional formation. The first movement involves a deliberate institutionalization of market exchange and the destruction of institutions built for social protection, which is also called \"de-regulation\". However, the first movement threatens the power of territorial organizations and induces turbulence and social unrest. But the territorial logic is not dismantled with the rise of new regional entities (Popescu, 2008) . Various political forces attempt to resist the process of globalization in order to ensure territorial control, cultural diversity, and human security (Hettne, 2003) . This leads to territorial state's attempts of re-regulation. Thus regionalism will enter the second movement and new institutions are created in response to the new political economy. Due to increasing competition and globalization, the regional scale becomes more important than national or supra-national scale for responding to new political economy (Brenner, 1999) . Hettne (2003) uses \"a second great transformation\" or the \"return of the political\" to refer to the increase of various political forces in shaping the course of regionalization.",

In the earliest history of regional space, people lived in small isolated communities with little contact. Subsequently, trans-local relations between previously more isolated communities were developed, leading to the emergence of regional complex. At this second level of regionness, the trans-local relations are widened. Nation-building leads to a temporary decline in the level of regionness due to the consolidation of national territories and the inward orientation of nation states such as the post-colonial creation of states in Asia and Africa after the Second World War. When the states take more open stances to external relations, the degree of cross-border contact may increase. However, the sense of regionness is still weak at this level. Exchanges and economic interactions are unstable, shortsighted and based on self-interest, rather than expectations of economic reciprocity, social communication and mutual trust (Hettne & S\u00f6derbaum, 2000) .",

Multi-dimensional regionalization occurs in economic, political and cultural dimensions spontaneously or through formalized regional cooperation with intensive interaction and communication among state and non-state actors. This level of regionness can be seen as a regional form of an \"international society\" of cooperating states (Bull, 1977) . The state is still the dominant actor at this level of regionness, but interdependence is increasing and its inward orientation is relaxed. The regional society can be either organized or more spontaneous in cultural, economic, political or military fields. Two types of regions, formal region and informal region, thus emerge under different dynamics of regionalization. This paper argues that Hong Konge Shenzhen region went through three sub-stages of regional society after the late 1970s, namely, the emergence of informal regional society from below, the transitional regional society and formal regional society, with increasing role of the Hong Kong government in the process of regionalization.",

The EU is a laboratory for building the regional institutionalized polity. It should be mentioned that a regional institutionalized polity is not bound to emerge due to the existence of a strong civil society, the accumulation of social capital and other institutional arrangements at the region. Sometimes, new forms of governance or looser alliances could be other possible ways to cement various regional interests.

It simplifies the complexities of regionalization, making the comparative analysis of emerging regions and the understanding of regionalism easier. As regionness is an endogenous approach to understanding contemporary regionalism, it must be combined with an exogenous approach to show how globalization and regionalization processes interact under different conditions of regionness, creating a variety of pathways of regionalization (Hettne, 2003) . The concepts of regionness and new regionalism have been developed by Hettne and his colleagues originally for world regions and macro-regionalization, such as the EU, North America and Asia Pacific, in the field of international relations and international political economy. However, they have been widely used on sub-national regions, micro-regions or cross-border regions in other academic disciplines such as geography, regional studies and urban planning. Hettne and S\u00f6derbaum (2000) also attempted to integrate macroregions (consisting of nation states) and micro-regions (subnational regions and cross-border regions) into the regionness concept. They argue that macro-regionalism and microregionalism are closely related. In East Asia, macro-regionalism has made slow progress while micro-regionalism is significant. Sub-regionalism or micro-regionalism in Greater China has been well documented in the literature (Sasuga, 2004; Sum, 2001 Sum, , 2002a Sum, , 2002b ). Sum's work on the emerging time-space governance of the Greater China's cross-boundary region is an important reference for understanding the relationship between Hong Kong, Taiwan and South China, especially the relationship between Hong Kong and the PRD region before the 1997 handover (Sum, 2002b) .

Hong Kong was formerly a British colony and was returned to China's sovereignty as a Special Administrative Region (SAR) in 1997. The framework of OCTS has been implemented in Hong Kong since then. Hong Kong enjoys a high degree of autonomy, with independent executive, legislative and judicial power. Shenzhen as Hong Kong's north neighboring city was designed as a Special Economic Zone (SEZ) by the central government in 1979, with the intention of attracting foreign investment as well as preparing for the return of Hong Kong (Wu, 1997) . In the administrative hierarchy, Shenzhen is a prefecture-level city under the administration of Guangdong Province. Shenzhen has grown from a small frontier town with a population of less than 30 thousand in 1978 to one of the top cities with a population over 10 million in China. Its GDP reached US$ 120.1 billion in 2009, about 57.0% of Hong Kong. Shenzhen was ranked as the second most competitive city in China in 2006e2010, only after Hong Kong (Ni et al., 2010) . Under the framework of OCTS, capitalist Hong Kong and socialist Shenzhen have different institutional bases, which are called asymmetric urban governance (Shen, 2008a) . Hong Kong government adopts a \"positive non-intervention policy\", while Shenzhen government adopts a \"developmental state\" approach to urban economy. Overall, the cross-boundary relationship between Hong Kong and Shenzhen is very similar to those trans-border cities and EUROREGION in the EU (Heddebaut, 2004) . Their integration can be analyzed through the lens of new regionalism. The rise of cross-boundary region of Hong KongeShenzhen/ Hong KongePRD region has much to do with a wide range of global and regional changes since the late 1970s. This study focuses on the period after 1979. Economic globalization has led to the rise of the \"world factory\" and the expansion of specific commodity chains in this region. Trans-national producers from the U.S., Germany and Japan relocated their manufacturing sectors to developing countries for cheap labor and raw materials (Sum, 2001 (Sum, , 2002a . The importance of such external force is another important feature of regionalism in South China, different from the EU.",

Anti-integration was popular among many officials, businessmen and residents. This has political, social and economic reasons. First, politically, there was disagreement on Hong KongePRD integration within Hong Kong SAR government. The government was divided into two camps with opposite views on the cross-boundary cooperation/ integration (Shen, 2004) . Some officials were concerned that close economic integration could undermine the political autonomy of Hong Kong SAR. Thus Hong Kong SAR government did not actively move toward cooperation. Second, it was recognized that local and international confidence in the future of Hong Kong was fragile during the early years after 1997. Many Hong Kong residents were worried that close integration may cause potential interference in Hong Kong's internal affairs by the Chinese government and change their capitalist way of life (Shen, 2004) . Third, on economic aspects, some interest groups, including real estate developers, homeowners and retailers, worried about the potentially negative economic impact on Hong Kong caused by close cross-boundary integration.",

The Fortress Hong Kong mentality began to dismantle from the mid-2003 and Hong Kong SAR government began to rethink its relationship with the mainland. Such a change has external and internal reasons. First, with close connections with the global economy, Hong Kong's policy making is much dependent on its external conditions and needs to make reference to other localities' strategies and actions (Ho, 2000) . In the period of post-1997 AFC, Hong Kong faced heavy urban competition from cities in the Greater China. Taking the strategy of \"Siliconization\" as an example, almost all localities in the Greater China attempted to re-position themselves as \"the next silicon valley\" (Sum, 2002a (Sum, , 2002b . Although Hong Kong proposed to develop itself into an \"e-hub\" (Jessop & Sum, 2000) , Taiwan and cities in South China also sought similar strategies, for examples, Taiwan as a \"science inland\" and Shenzhen as a \"gateway for information technologies\" (Sum, 2002a (Sum, , 2002b . On the other hand, Hong Kong was no longer the only pacemaker/gateway for China, with rapid economic development, further reform and opening in the mainland China. The growing Yangtze River Delta region, especially the emergence of Shanghai as international shipping center and international financial center, challenges the position of Hong Kong as an international logistics center and international financial center to some degree (Huang, 2009; Jiang & Shen, 2010) . Since 2007, Shanghai port has surpassed Hong Kong port in terms of container throughput, becoming the second largest container port in the world (Fig. 2) . Hong Kong's neighboring cities, Shenzhen and Guangzhou, no longer position themselves as the \"back factory\" of Hong Kong (Yeung, Shen, & Zhang, 2006) . Shenzhen has proposed to develop the headquarters economy, and build itself into a regional financial center and a logistics center in Asia-Pacific region in its strategy of Shenzhen 2030. Shenzhen port will catch up Hong Kong port soon (Fig. 2) . Guangzhou is very aggressive in building competitiveness and attempts to regain its position as the \"dragon head\" of South China (Xu & Yeh, 2005) . A large number of mega-projects have been initiated by Guangzhou since 2000. Guangzhou made massive investment in infrastructure such as metro system in preparing the Asian Games in 2010. Under such a competitive context, a debate on whether Hong Kong was being marginalized emerged among Hong Kong's top officials and scholars. The Bauhinia Foundation Research Centre, a think-tank of Hong Kong's chief executive, released a policy research report titled China's 11th Five Year Plan: Opportunities and Challenges for Hong Kong in 2006 . The report suggested that Hong Kong should take an active stance in cross-boundary cooperation in order to maintain Hong Kong's competitiveness in a globalizing era .",

To help Hong Kong's economy, the Central Government has introduced a series of preferential policies. In June 2003, the Central Government and Hong Kong SAR Government signed the first bilateral free-trade agreement e the Closer Economic Partnership Arrangement (CEPA). It covers three aspects: trade in goods, trade in services, and trade and investment facilitation. Under the CEPA, the potentially huge market of the mainland is opened in advance of all foreign investors to Hong Kong investors with lower entrance thresholds than China's commitments to WTO (World Trade Organization) (Yeung & Shen, 2008) . Taking trade in goods as an example, almost all Hong Kong domestic exports to the mainland enjoyed zero tariffs. Only in the first two years of implementation, Hong Kong's businesses saved a total of around HK$ 240 million in tariffs (Hong Kong SAR Government, 2006) . In addition, the Individual Visit Scheme was also introduced by the Central Government in 2003 to boost tourism in Hong Kong. Prior to the scheme, mainland visitors could only travel to Hong Kong on business visas or in group tours. Under this scheme, residents in 43 mainland cities are allowed to visit Hong Kong on an individual basis. Such scheme has greatly stimulated the growth of tourism industry for Hong Kong. It was estimated that tourist income generated by the scheme reached over HK$ 60 billion in 2004, accounting for 55% of the total income of the industry . It is clear that Hong Kong's economic recovery has greatly benefited from supports from the Central Government.",

Thus they took a negative stance toward cross-boundary cooperation (Shen, 2004) .

A consensus around close cross-boundary integration has emerged in the society.

Regarding the airport cooperation, two airports are complementary (Vogel et al., 2010, chap. 10) . Hong Kong and Shenzhen airports mainly offer international and domestic flights respectively. According to Shenzhen airport's statistics, 3 million mainland visitors to Hong Kong used Shenzhen A frontier closed area (FCA) was set up around Hong Konge Shenzhen boundary in 1951 to halt the influx of immigrants from the mainland and to restrict illegal activities. The development within the area has been frozen since then. Hong Kong government has been active in the joint development of the boundary area. It reduced the size of the FCA from 2800 ha to 400 ha in January 2008. Only areas around boundary control points remained as the FCA. It is expected that the released land from the FCA will provide ample space for Hong KongeShenzhen cooperation. Lok Ma Chau Loop Area is a key area for joint boundary development. 2 Two working groups, including environment, planning and project working group and development direction working group, were set up under the task force of joint development of boundary area. Some consultancy studies had been conducted by the task force.",

The importance of external force is another important feature different from regionalism in EU. In addition, the city state in the emerging Hong KongeShenzhen metropolis is a driving force of cross-boundary regionalization, instead of a counterforce in defense of society.

About 57,400 Hong Kong residents worked in Shenzhen in 2009, accounting for 29.2% of those Hong Kong residents working in the mainland.Boundary crossing has also become a frequent activity for many Hong Kong and Shenzhen residents. According to our surveys, 77.2% of Hong Kong residents visited Shenzhen occasionally (about once every two months or less) and 22.7% visited Shenzhen regularly (at least once a month) during the past year. Only 5.7% never visited Shenzhen. In contrast, only 44.7% of Shenzhen residents visited Hong Kong occasionally and 7.7% visited Hong Kong regularly during the past year. 38.6% never visited Hong Kong. It is clear that the majority of cross-boundary passengers were Hong Kong people due to the asymmetrical boundary-crossing control. Most Hong Kong residents could apply for a Home Visit Permit allowing unlimited travel to Shenzhen and other mainland cities. But Shenzhen residents could only apply for a double-entry visa to Hong Kong lasting three months to a year previously. From April 2009, 2.2 million Shenzhen residents with local hukou (household registration) can apply for an unlimited pass to visit Hong Kong within a year(Qiu, 2009).Regarding Hong Kong people's purposes of visiting Shenzhen, 3 over half (53.9%) were for shopping and entertainment, 17.3% for visiting relatives and family/tomb sweeping, 16.9% for working, 16.5% for transport transit and 9.4% for taking vacation/massage. Regarding Shenzhen residents' purposes of visiting Hong Kong, 73.8% were for shopping and entertainment, 33.2% for taking vacation/tourism, 15.7% for working, 10.1% for visiting relatives and family/tomb sweeping and 9.3% for doing business. It is clear that there is close social linkage between Hong Kong and Shenzhen. The respondents in both cities think that Hong KongeShenzhen cooperation will have positive impact on each other. Most Hong Kong people (69.8%) and Shenzhen people (88.3%) support the development of Hong KongeShenzhen metropolis. Clearly, the Hong",
