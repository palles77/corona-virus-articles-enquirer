Eighty percent of workers reported rabies vaccination. Some respondents indicated interest in enhanced occupational health services targeting their unique needs.

Individuals with extensive wildlife contact may be at the greatest risk of contracting novel infectious agents that could both cause disease in such individuals and then spread in human communities (Mazet et al. 2004; Zhang et al. 2008) . Wildlife workers face a wide range of known zoonotic disease threats from wildlife such as rabies, plague, brucellosis, and tularemia (McLean 1994; Rabinowitz et al. 2010) and have potential of contracting novel infections from such contact as well. Studies have shown that workers in professions with wildlife contact have a higher likelihood of being infected by known animal viruses such as hantavirus, and lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (Fritz et al. 2002; Kelt et al. 2007) .",

Such surveillance initiatives may take place at local, regional, or global scales. Wildlife workers engaged in surveillance for infectious pathogens in wildlife face unique occupational risks due to their animal contact. In addition, due to the geographical dispersion of such surveillance activities, consistent occupational health preventive services for such workers may be lacking because of the variability in both access to and quality of local health services, differing cultural norms, and other local and regional factors. Despite the unique risk of occupational illness and injury among these populations, the occupational risk of wildlife veterinarians, field researchers, wildlife rehabilitators, and other workers handling wild animals has not been well studied on a global scale. Additionally, although individual organizations have implemented occupational health programs for workers with wildlife contact (Ali et al. 2004) , there are no widely accepted models for preventive occupational health models for these groups. Previous studies of wildlife workers in the USA have revealed gaps in awareness and training related to zoonotic pathogens (Bosch et al. 2013) . Because such work places them at increased risk of infection with both novel and known animal pathogens, the aim of this study was to survey a group of workers engaged in wildlife disease surveillance in high-risk regions in order to better understand their potential occupational exposures to various wildlife pathogens.",

In wildlife work, exposures to animal feces and body fluids are common, and bites and scratches from a variety of species, including high-risk animals such as bats and rodents, were reported by respondents. The majority of the respondents reported training in multiple aspects of workplace safety. Use of gloves was high across tasks, while use of other personal protective equipment such as respiratory protection varied according to task. Some respondents indicated interest in greater access to protective equipment and occupational health services including training, surveillance, and medical follow-up of exposures. These results can be used to design enhanced occupational health services for wildlife workers. This study demonstrates the successful use of an internet-based platform to consent, enroll, and survey a geographically diverse and multi-language workforce located across multiple countries. It provides a unique snapshot of the challenging work being carried out on a global scale by people who have not historically been the subject of extensive study or surveillance, giving insight into the daily tasks, risks, and exposures of those who are in close contact with wildlife and wildlife samples.",

Additionally, the diversity of tasks and exposures that were surveyed limited the ability of the questionnaire to fully explore any particular exposure scenario in depth. Respondents had worked in a number of different wildlife surveillance jobs during their career, and therefore the reported lifetime exposures could not be associated with any one job position.

This implies that recent training could have influenced the reported behavior of the workers in a more protective direction, although our survey could not confirm this possibility due to its cross-sectional nature. Additionally, this suggests the possibility of the value of enhanced training and awareness of disease risks of wildlife workers in general. Along with training, it is imperative that wildlife workers have access to the necessary PPE to help mitigate risks. The extensive use of gloves reported in most wildlife work tasks indicates that consideration of personal protective equipment is routine among the survey respondents. The fact that the use of other types of personal protective equipment such as N95 respiratory protection varied by task and type of animal contact situation, with the highest rates of use reported during high-risk activities such as necropsy of diseased animals suggests that workers are making task-based judgments about risk. A number of respondents indicated that they took extra precautions when animals appeared to be sick, including extensive use of PPE and increased vigilance in performing tasks. At the same time, there was variability in the reported degree of access to PPE. These results underscore the importance of ensuring adequate access to personal protective equipment for this at risk population. They also support the need for task-based exposure assessment research to better understand the occupational risk in different exposure situations.",

While the occupational setting for wildlife work inevitably involves some risks that are difficult to control, such as the behavior or disease status of captured wild animals, possible applications of the hierarchy of controls model to wildlife surveillance work could include modifications in equipment or practices to decrease risks of animal bites or scratches during animal capture and/or restraint (Slate et al. 2009 ). Additionally, modifications to PPE designed for a laboratory environment may be necessary for those working in the field and could be a helpful measure to ensure effectiveness and compliance for wildlife workers. The recent Ebola outbreak in West Africa is a prime example of this, where health care workers reported difficulty wearing the recommended PPE for over 40 min due to heat and humidity, which ultimately led to an effort by a number of agencies to develop improved PPE for use in the field (NIOSH 2015) . Further studies to explore the use of such controls and other exposure reduction measures in wildlife surveillance work appear warranted.",

A wildlife worker presenting to medical care with a recent significant exposure (such as an animal bite) or symptoms consistent with an acute infection could represent the index case for a zoonotic spillover event from wildlife. Such infectious exposures could pose a risk to family members and other close contacts of the worker, and potentially even the global community. Almost a third of wildlife workers in this survey reported working and having occupational contact with wildlife in multiple countries, which may increase the risk of spreading infections to human or wildlife populations either through the worker themselves or through fomites. Extra precaution should be taken by those working in multiple countries to disinfect possible fomites, such as work boots or other reusable PPE. Such travel and exposure history emphasizes the importance of early recognition of an occupational infection in such persons. Enhanced occupational health programs with procedures for appropriate surveillance, diagnosis, and management of high-risk exposures and suspected workrelated illness across geographical regions, including the consideration of a wide range of both recognized and newly emerging potential animal pathogens could potentially help detect and prevent the sequelae of zoonotic infection. Such surveillance could also help detect subclinical zoonotic infection events that would not otherwise come to medical attention. Additionally, ongoing surveillance could assess the frequency and severity of occupational exposures and identify opportunities for their prevention, which could benefit the health of wildlife workers as well as the general population.",
