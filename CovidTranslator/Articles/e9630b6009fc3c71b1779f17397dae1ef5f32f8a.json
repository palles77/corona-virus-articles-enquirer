Infection was followed sequentially from nose to brain, using microscopy, immunohistochemistry and virus quantification. Lesions, antigen and virus were observed in the olfactory bulb and anterior brain as early as 2 days and posterior brain by 4 days after inoculation. Viral antigen extended through nasal mucosa into submucosa, then coursed along the olfactory nerve perineurium and fibers, through the cribriform plate into the olfactory bulbs. On days 4 and 7, viral antigen was found in the antero-ventral brain, along ventral meninges, olfactory tracts and anterior ramifications of the lateral ventricles. Virus was cleared from nose by 10 days and anterior brain by 20 days, but persisted in posterior brain for 20 days after inoculation. Mice also developed disseminated infection, with viremia and hepatitis. Infection of brain did not correlate with presence of viremia. In contrast to intranasally inoculated mice, orally-inoculated mice did not develop encephalitis, despite evidence of disseminated infection.",

            "text": "This study provides insight into one mechanism of central nervous system infection by viruses with respiratory tropism. Mouse hepatitis virus, similar to coronaviruses of other species, utilizes upper respiratory mucosa as its primary target [2, 4, 6, 8, 17] . A number of studies have demonstrated olfactory bulb or tract lesions following i.n. inoculation of different MHV strains [1-3, 6, 8, 10, 13, 17] . Results of the present study provide evidence that virus enters the brain di-rectly by extension along olfactory nerves. Sequential studies of lesion, antigen and virus distribution in nose and brain indicated anterior to posterior progression of infection. Furthermore, mice inoculated orally with MHV did not develop brain infection, although they showed evidence of viremic dissemination to liver. This suggests that there is an effective blood-brain barrier to MHV in mature mice. In contrast, the pattern of brain infection is decidedly different in neonatal mice. In these animals, MHV lesions are diffusely distributed throughout the brain, suggesting blood-borne infection [3, 4] . The mechanism of this age-dependent blood-brain MHV barrier is worthy of further investigation. Orally inoculated mice developed MFIV lesions in their anterior nasal tissues, presumably by entry of virus through the incisive foramina, patent openings between the mouth and anterior nose [9] . The fact that none of these mice developed brain infections despite anterior nasal infection suggests that olfactory neural extension of virus is inefficient and requires infection of the posterior nasal tissues, where olfactory epithelium and nerves prevail.",

However, only those vi~rus strains with relative neurotropism were capable of progressing into the posterior brain [6] . Thus, progression of infection within brain is MHV strain specific. The sequential distribution of lesions within the brain up to 7 days after i.n. inoculation of neurotropic MHV-JHM has been well described [8] , and resembled the posterior progression seen in our studies. The present study examined infection only for 20 days, but showed a sequential anterior-posterior regression of lesions and virus within the brain. Persistence of low levels of virus in the posterior brain stem corresponded with the location of persistent spongiform and demyelinating lesions in the brain stem following i.n. inoculation of several different strains of MHV [1, 2, 4, 6] . Although MHV-JHM is usually cleared from brain by 60 days after i.n. inoculation of susceptible mice [4] , temperature-sensitive mutants of MHV-JHM have been shown to persist for up to one year after intracerebral inoculation [11, 12] .",
