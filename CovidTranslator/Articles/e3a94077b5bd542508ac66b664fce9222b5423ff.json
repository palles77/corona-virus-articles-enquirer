The amphiphilic nature of the transmembrane a-helical domain is consistent with the protein forming a transmembrane channel with which smartsdine, the specific anti-influenza A drug, interacts. Together these features provide a structural basis for the hypothesis that M2 has a proton translocation function capable of regulating the pH of vesicles of the trans-Golgi network, a role important in promoting the correct maturation of the hemagglutinin glycoprotein . n 1991 Academic Press, inc .",

Evidence as to its function has been derived largely from studies of the action of these inhibitors . Characterization of drug-resistant mutants, arising both \"in vitro\" and \"in vivo,\" has indicated that the drugs interact with the membrane-spanning domain of the protein (Hay et al., 1985 ; Belshe etal., 1988 ; Bean et al., 1989) . The most common inhibitory activity of these agents is directed against a stage in virus uncoating about which there is little detailed information (Kato and Eggers, 1969 ; Bukrinskaya etal., 1982) . With certain strains of viruses, in particular of the H7 subtype, the hemagglutinin (HA) of which is cleaved intracellularly in cell culture, the drugs also act at a later stage in virus infection, preventing virus release apparently as a consequence of an M2-mediated conversion of the HA to its low pH conformation (Hay et al ., 1986 ; Sugrue et al., 1 990a ; Ruigrok et at, 1990) . The very nature of this alteration arid its reversibility by, e .g ., monensin suggest that M2 plays a role in regulating the pH of vesicular compartments of the trans-Golgi network (TON) .",

Additional polar or charged residues at position 27 (serine, threonine, or aspartic acid), 30 (threonine), or 34 (glutamic acid) in the sequences of the proteins of amantadine-resistant and rimantadineresistant viruses (Hay et al., 1985 ; Belshe et al., 1988 ; Bean et al., 1989) emphasizes the sidedness and amphiphilic nature of an a-helical configuration of this segment (Fig . 11) . Although there is no definitive evidence regarding the secondary structure of this domain or the relative orientation of the subunits in the tetramer, it is likely that the polar faces are directed towards the interior of the structure and away from the lipid environment of the bilayer . This view would fit the suggestion that amantadine interacts directly with a channel formed by the four subunits of the tetramer and that the amino acid changes, which abolish amantadine-sensitivity, directly influence binding . There is a precedent for this in that amantadine and various N-alkyl derivatives inhibit neuromuscular transmission by interacting with the ion channel of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor and competitively inhibit the binding of other channel blockers, phencyclidine and histrionicotoxin,tothereceptor (Warnicketal ., 1982 ; Eldefrawi et al., 1982) .",

(B) Perceived arrangement of two diagonally located a-helices of the tetramer with the hydrophobic faces towards the . lipid hilayer and the polar faces forming the interior of the . proposed channel . dence indicates that the M2 protein is capable of regulating the pH of vesicles of the TGN and may form a selective ion channel . In the absence of any direct evidence for this function the conclusion is based on observations that amantadine causes an M2-mediated conversion of HA to its low-pH conformation apparently as a consequence of exposure to a reduced pH in the TGN during its transport to the cell surface (Sugrue et al., 1990a ; F . Ciampor and A . Hay, unpublished data) . It is not known whether the amino acid changes in M2 which abolish this action do so by altering its function or the interaction of amantadine with M2 . In the latter regard, reciprocal changes of polar and apolar amino acids at two successive turns of the helix of the \"M2\" membrane-spanning region of the subunits of the nAchR alter the binding affinity of the quaternary ammonium anesthetic OX-222 (Leonard at al., 1988 ; Charnet etal., 1990) . A disposition of amantadine similar to that suggested for OX-222, with the amino group interacting with the hydroxyl group of serine 31 and the hydrophobic ring moiety directed towards the previous turn of the helix (valine/isoleucine, 27) (Fig . 11) , would be consistent with the amantadine resistance changes in the viral protein . On the basis of their effect on HA maturation, it is apparent that certain substitutions, e .g ., valine (27) by serine or threonine may enhance while others, e .g ., glycine (34) by glutamic acid, clearly compromise the functional activity of the Rostock M2 protein in infected cells (S .

This is a novel function for a virus protein which in the case of influenza A viruses has a role in both virus uncoating and glycoprotein (HA) maturation (Hay, 1989 ; Belshe and Hay, 1989) . In view of the similarities in the modes of replication of influenza A and influenza B viruses it is likely that an analogous protein, probably the 100-amino-acid NB protein of B viruses (Williams and Lamb, 1986 ) performs a similar function . In considering the wider implications for other enveloped viruses, a number of small membrane-associated proteins of undefined function have been identified . These include, for example, the SH and 1 A proteins of paramyxoviruses (Hiebert et al ., 1985 ; Olmsted and Collins, 1989) , the D3 protein of the coronavirus, infectious bronchitis virus (Smith et a!., 1990) , and the vpu protein of HIV-1 shown to have an important role in virus maturation (Terwilliger et al., 1989 ; Klimkait et al., 1990) . Finally, the mechanistic similarities between the antiviral and anticholinergic activities of amantadine may well encompass its pharmacological efficacy both in preventing influenza A infection and in alleviating symptoms of Parkinson's disease .",
