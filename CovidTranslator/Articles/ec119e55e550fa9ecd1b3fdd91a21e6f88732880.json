However, when human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) are transferred into NOG (NOD/Shi-scid, IL-2rg null ) mice, severe graft versus host disease (GVHD) hinders long term detailed analysis. Administration of human PBMCs into newly developed murine MHC class I-and class II-deficient NOG (NOG-dKO; NOG-Iab, B2m-double-knockout) mice showed sufficient engraftment of human immune cells with little sign of GVHD. Immunization with influenza vaccine resulted in an increase in influenza-specific human IgG Ab, indicating induction of antigen-specific B cells in the NOG-dKO mice. Immunization with human dendritic cells pulsed with HLA-A2 restricted cytomegalovirus peptide induced specific cytotoxic T cells, indicating the induction of antigen-specific T cells in the NOG-dKO mice. Adoptive cell therapies (ACTs) using melanoma antigen recognized by T cells (MART-1)-specific TCR-transduced activated T cells showed strong tumor growth inhibition in NOG-dKO mice without any sign of GVHD accompanied by preferential expansion of the transferred MART-1specific T cells. ACTs using cultured human melanoma infiltrating T cells also showed anti-tumor effects against autologous melanoma cells in NOG-dKO mice, in which changes in human cancer phenotypes by immune intervention, such as increased CD271 expression, could be evaluated. Therefore, NOG-dKO mice are useful tools for more detailed analysis of both the induction and effector phases of T-cell and B-cell responses for a longer period than regular NOG mice.",

However, there are significant differences between humans and mice, such as T-cell and B-cell signaling pathway components, Th1/Th2 differentiation, Toll-like receptors and cytokines and their receptors. 1 To overcome these problems, various humanized mice in which the human immune system can be studied in vivo have been recently developed. The most commonly used humanized mouse models are immunodeficient Il2r\u03b3 null mouse strains, such as NOG (NOD/Shi-Prkdc scid Il2r\u03b3 tm1Sug /Jic) mice 2 or NSG (NOD/LtSz-Prkdc scid Il2r\u03b3 tm1Wjl /J) mice 3 engrafted with human tissues, human hematopoietic cells (HSCs) or human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), in which human immune cells can be analyzed.",

However, these humanized mice are still insufficient because the developed human cells are not fully functional. For example, although immunization of these humanized mice with antigens leads to the production of antigen-specific IgM, antigen-specific IgG responses are very weak. 5, 6 T-cell differentiation, such as generation of CD4 and CD8 single-positive T cells, seems to be relatively normal in these humanized mice. 5, 7 However, the function of these T cells, especially induction of antigen-specific T-cell responses, remains controversial. 4 One of the reasons is thought to be mismatches between mouse MHC and HLA of donor human HSCs. To overcome these issues, new immunodeficient Il2r\u03b3 null mouse strains that express human HLA class I or class II molecules were generated and showed HLA-restricted antigenspecific CTL responses 8 or antigen-specific IgG responses. 9 Although these HSC-engrafted humanized mice have improved our understanding of in vivo human immune cell development and functions, 10 these mice could not reconstruct the current immune status of human individuals, including patients, because all of the human hematopoietic cells were reconstituted from HSCs. In particular, analyzing the association of T cells and autologous tissues, including cancer cells, in HSC-engrafted humanized mice is nearly impossible because it is difficult to obtain HSCs and tissues from the same patient.",

We previously reported that human PBMCs could be engrafted in NOG mice much better than in other immunodeficient mice. 11 However, because of severe xenogeneic graft versus host disease (xeno-GVHD) in these mice, there is a limited window for experimentation. All the engrafted T cells are activated by xeno-GVHD, and all the mice die of xeno-GVHD, which makes it difficult to analyze human immune responses precisely. Previously, murine class I MHC and class II MHC-knockout NSG mice were developed and analyzed for xeno-GVHD, 12 but the phenotypes and immune responses of transferred human PBMCs have not been clearly evaluated yet.",

NOG mice were established as previously reported. 2 NOG-dKO mice were established as follows. B6;129-H2-Ab1 tm1Doi (Iab null ) and NOD.Cg-Prkdc scid B2m tm1Unc /SzJ (NOD-scid B2m null ) mice were a kind gift from Dr Mathis D. of Harvard Medical School and Dr Shultz L. of The Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME, USA), respectively. Iab null mice were first backcrossed into C57BL/6JJic mice more than seven generations. The established B6-Iab null mice were further backcrossed into NOG mice with a speed congenic technique combining a marker-assisted selection protocol and in vitro fertilization to obtain NOG-Iab null mice. NOG-B2m null mice were also established by backcross-mating NOD-scid B2m null to NOG mice to introduce the Il2rg gene. NOG-dKO mice were obtained by mating NOG-Iab null and NOG-B2m null mice. For genotyping NOG-B2m null mice and NOG-Iab null mice, 3 different primers were used for detection of WT and KO genotypes. The primers used to detect the \u03b22 microglobulin (B2m) gene and I-ab gene were as follows: B2m gene, PI (B2m forward) = 5\u2032-AGAAGCCCAAGAGTTTCCTCATGG-3\u2032, PII (B2m reverse WT) = 5\u2032-AAAGCCAAGATGCAGTGTGTA GCG-3\u2032, and PIII (B2m reverse Mu) = 5\u2032-ACGTGCATGGAT CTGCAACATGTC-3\u2032; I-ab gene, PI (Iab forward) = 5\u2032-GAGTACGTGCGCTACGACAG-3\u2032, PII (Iab reverse WT) = 5\u2032-AGAGGGCAGAGGTGAGACAG-3\u2032, and PIII (Iab reverse Mu) = 5\u2032-TGCTCCTGCCGAGAAAGTAT-3\u2032. Genomic DNA was extracted from the tails of the mice. The PCR reaction conditions were as follows: 94\u00b0C 5 min/94\u00b0C 30 s-60\u00b0C 30 s-72\u00b0C 60 s (35 cycles)/72\u00b0C 10 min. A 676-bp band was detected for mutant B2m from the PI and PIII primer pair. A 488-bp band was detected for wild-type B2m from the PI and PII primer pair. A 587-bp band was detected for mutant Iab from the PI and PIII primer pair. A 335-bp band was detected for wild-type Iab from the PI and PII primer pair. The absence of MHC class I molecule expression in NOG strains (H-2K d and H-2D b ) on the surface of cells from NOG-dKO mice was confirmed by FACS (Supplementary Figure 1) . Mouse care and all experimental procedures were performed under pathogen-free conditions in accordance with the established guidelines of Keio University and Central Institute for Experimental Animals. For generating human PBMCtransplanted mice, human PBMCs were collected from healthy volunteers with informed consent using Lymphoprep (AXIS-SHIELD PoC AS, Oslo, Norway) and were injected into mice intravenously (5 \u00d7 10 6 /mouse).",

The relative concentrations of anti-HA antibodies were estimated by comparison to standard curves on each plate. Serum from a healthy volunteer with anti-HA IgG was used as standard serum. The titer of standard sera was defined as 1000 U/ml. After cells were removed, the plates were washed with H 2 O five times and incubated with 10 mM EDTA-2Na/PBS (150 \u03bcl per well) for 10 min at room temperature.

However, severe GVHD has been an obstacle for long-term follow-up and precise evaluation of the function of the T cells. We evaluated whether NOG-dKO mice can be used as a mouse model for T-cell-based adoptive cancer immunotherapies. We implanted 526 mel, a human melanoma cell line expressing MART-1, 16 a human melanoma antigen, and HLA-0201, in NOG mice and NOG-dKO mice and treated them with MART-1-specific T cells (MART-Ts), which were generated by transducing the HLA-0201-restricted MART-1specific TCR gene into activated PBMC-derived T cells from healthy human volunteers 15 (Figure 5a ). The NOG-dKO mice showed anti-tumor effects induced by MART-T administration with no body weight loss (Figures 5b and c) . Co-administration of exogenous human recombinant IL-2 prolonged the survival of T cells with higher MART-1/HLA-A2 tetramer-positive cells and enhanced the anti-tumor effects in NOG-dKO mice (Figures 5d and e) . Although the NOG mice showed stronger anti-tumor effects along with increased transfer of T cells, probably due to strong T-cell expansion via xenogeneic GVHD responses, the ratio of MART-1-specific T cells in the CD8 + T cells was smaller than that in NOG-dKO mice, suggesting that T-cell phenotypes were modified by xenogeneic GVHD responses in NOG mice (Figure 5e ). Next, we treated human melanoma-bearing NOG-dKO mice with autologous tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs). In NOG-dKO mice, administration of cultured tumor infiltrating T cells, TIL2 17 cells (Figure 5f ), showed significant anti-tumor effects against an autologous melanoma cell line, Mel2, which was established from the same patient from which the TIL2 cells were established (Figure 5g ). CD271 on human melanoma cells, which is reported to be induced by IFN-\u03b3 and involved in suppression of melanoma-specific CTLs, 18 was found to be increased in TIL2-treated melanoma cells (Figure 5h) , suggesting that NOG-dKO mice might also be used for evaluation of changes in human cancer phenotypes induced by T-cells following immune interventions. Altogether, the results of this study demonstrated that NOG-dKO mice are more useful for detailed and long-term analysis of B-cell responses and T cell responses at both the induction and effector phases of human peripheral blood than regular NOG mice.",

One possible mechanism is incomplete downregulation of MHC class I molecules by the deletion of the \u03b22 microglobulin gene, although we confirmed little expression of MHC class I molecules on the surface of cells from NOG-dKO mice (Supplementary Figure 1) . The other possible mechanisms involved in the stimulation of engrafted human T cells might be homeostatic proliferation, engrafted human antigen-presenting cells presenting murine proteins, and murine minor histocompatibility antigens (mHAs).

In this study, we showed influenza HAspecific IgG production in hPBMC-NOG-dKO mice vaccinated with HA antigen, suggesting that even with little inflammation caused by xeno-GVHD reaction, B-cell responses can be induced. Lack of xeno-GVHD in our mouse models enables more long-term and precise evaluation of human B-cell characteristics and responses. For example, the observation of B cells homing to the bone marrow (BM) almost 3 months (long-term) after human PBMC transfer in NOG-dKO mice (Figure 2e) is of interest.

The effector phase of anti-tumor immune responses in which anti-tumor T cells recognize and kill tumor cells can be evaluated more precisely and for a longer period in our NOG-dKO mouse models than in NOG mouse models because of the lack of xeno-GVHD. In particular, T-cell phenotypes, such as anergy or exhaustion, might be effectively evaluated. Our colleagues have recently reported that immunotherapies targeting PD-1 could be more precisely evaluated in our NOG-dKO mice than in NOG mice because the xeno-GVHD reaction induces nonspecific T-cell activation accompanied by PD-1 expression in NOG mice. 31 On the other hand, because of the short longevity of antigen presenting cells, our current mouse models may not be suitable for evaluation of the induction phase of anti-tumor immune responses if DCs are not supplied, as shown in Figure 4 . A variety of immune cells, such as macrophages, MDSCs, Tregs and NK cells, which play important roles in the cancer microenvironment, are also not well supported in our current mouse models. For supporting these cells, we are now developing various human cytokineproducing transgenic NOG strains. 32 In conclusion, compared with NOG mice, hPBMC-NOG-dKO mice are useful for analyzing current human individual immune status and providing long-term and more precise evaluation of human T-cell and B-cell responses.",
