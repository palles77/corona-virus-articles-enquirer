            "text": "Introduction Acute respiratory tract infections (ARI) in children are often treated with antibiotics even without evidence of bacterial infection. Serum procalcitonin (PCT) is elevated in bacterial but not in viral infections. Patients and methods We performed a retrospective analysis of children in the PID-ARI.net study on respiratory infections to address the question of whether plasma PCT could potentially distinguish between bacterial infections requiring antibiotic therapy and viral ARI. We analysed data on 327 children who had been included in the German PID-ARI.net study and in whom nasopharyngeal aspirates had been analysed with a 19-valent multiplex reverse transcriptionpolymerase chain reaction-enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for viral and atypical bacterial pathogens. Serum PCT was determined using a quantitative immunoassay (BRAHMS Kryptor PCTsensitive, Henningsdorf, Germany). We then focussed specifically on those children who were treated with antibiotics and therefore had been suspected of having bacterial infection but who had a serum PCT level lower than 0.1 ng/ml. Results Out of 327 children, 132 had serum PCT levels below 0.1 ng/ml. Of these 132, 38 children had been treated with antibiotics. After exclusion of 26 patients (with critical illnesses, antibiotics on admission or for reasons other than ARI), 12 children remained for further evaluation. Of these 12 children, four had atypical pneumonia; four others had positive virus testing, and, in the last four, the aetiology of ARI remained unknown; evidence of bacterial infection could not be detected in any.",

            "text": "Acute respiratory tract infections (ARI) account for the majority of antibiotic prescriptions in children. In most cases, however, antibiotics are given without clear evidence of clinically significant bacterial infection. The bacterial organism is isolated and identified as the causative agent in a minority of cases only. Several studies have shown that procalcitonin (PCT), a prohormone of calcitonin (normally produced by thyroid C cells), is elevated in bacterial infections but remains low in viral infections [9, 19, 21, 24] . As known so far, bacterial endotoxins are the main stimulus for PCT induction [6, 13] . Christ-Crain et al. [4] have shown recently that a PCT-guided therapeutic strategy in adult patients with lower respiratory tract infections can substantially and safely reduce antibiotic use. These promising results have been confirmed in further intervention trials by the same authors in patients with communityacquired pneumonia and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [5, 25] . The aim of this retrospective analysis was to evaluate the potential of PCT in distinguishing bacterial infections-or, more specifically, those needing antibiotic treatment-from viral respiratory tract infections in paediatric patients. The analysis was performed on data of the PID-ARI.net study, a comprehensive epidemiological study on acute respiratory tract infections in Germany [27] .",

We focussed on patients with PCT values of <0.1 ng/ml who were treated with antibiotics and thus, obviously, had been considered as suffering from bacterial infection. All patients not treated with antibiotics and recovering uneventfully were deemed to have had viral infections or self-limiting bacterial ARI. Severely immunocompromised individuals, e.g. children undergoing chemotherapy, stem cell or organ transplant recipients as well as children with an immunodeficiency syndrome, were primarily excluded. We also excluded neonates as several studies have shown higher reference values in this collective, especially within the first 48 h [3, 17] . Patients with other critical underlying conditions (such as with congenital cardiac defects) were excluded as, in these patients, antibiotic treatment is initiated more generously even without clear evidence for bacterial infection. Additionally, we did not take into account patients who had received antimicrobial therapy prior to admission since PCT concentration may decrease rapidly in successfully treated bacterial infection [1, 12] . Finally, we excluded children who were treated with antibiotics for reasons other than lower respiratory tract infections (e.g. urinary tract infection).",

We hypothesised that a PCT <0.1 ng/ml indicated absence of bacterial infection or-even more important-absence of bacterial infection requiring antibiotic treatment. In patients with PCT values of <0.25 ng/ml, bacterial infection was assumed to be unlikely. To find out whether these hypotheses were robust, we considered ARI in patients not treated with antibiotics to definitely have been of viral aetiology or self-limiting bacterial infection. We estimated it appropriate to exclude five patients from our analysis who were treated with antibiotics for other reasons (e.g. urinary tract infection), 17 patients who had already started with antibiotics prior to admission and of four children with chronic illnesses since these patients would also be excluded from a prospective trial. We then had a closer look into the remaining 12 patients with serum PCT concentrations of <0.1 ng/ml who started with antibiotic treatment on admission (postulating that in these patients bacterial respiratory tract infection had been suspected on admission by the paediatrician in charge). Specifically, were there children with low PCT who nevertheless proved to have bacterial infection? As far as could be judged from retrospective analysis of clinical, laboratory, microbiological or radiological findings in these 12 children, there was no substantial criterion for underlying bacterial infection. Antibiotic treatment could probably have been withheld safely. Therefore, we suggest a PCT serum concentration of <0.1 ng/ml as an adequate cutoff value to prospectively guide treatment decision in otherwise healthy children with ARI. As shown in Table 1 (column 5), 40% of patients with PCT values \u22650.5 ng/ml had not received antibiotics (neither initially nor in the clinical course) without adverse effects as far as could be judged from retrospective analysis. This reflects the very restrictive antibiotic treatment policy in patients with ARI in our institution. Thus, unlike Christ-Crain et al. in adult patients with ARI, we would not strongly encourage initial antibiotic treatment in children presenting with ARI and PCT values \u22650.25 ng/ml (especially \u22650.5 ng/ ml) in a prospective intervention trial. The most beneficial cutoff in infants and children still has to be determined.",

Comparing the percentages of RSV, adenovirus or rhinovirus detections, there was no relevant difference between high or low PCT values. It is known that viral infections, e.g. RSV, rhinovirus or hMPV, may facilitate bacterial adherence to respiratory epithelial cells [11, 15, 16] and thus may lead to bacterial superinfection. Therefore, viral-bacterial co-infections might account for a number of cases with PCT values of \u22650.25 ng/ml. On the other hand, previous studies have come to the conclusion that PCT cannot reliably distinguish between viral or bacterial aetiology but reflects more the invasiveness and severity of microbial invasion [2, 9, 13] . Thus, elevated PCT values of \u22650.25 ng/ml might rather indicate the presence of more invasive viral rather than true bacterial infection in some of our patients, too.",

In another five patients where atypical pneumonia had been diagnosed with radiograph only, PCT concentrations were below 0.25 ng/ml, too. This is in agreement with previous [12] . On the other hand, PCT seems to increase and even correlate with the prognosis of adult patients with community-acquired pneumonia due to Legionella pneumophila as shown in a recent study [10] . It is common clinical practice to treat patients with verified or suspected atypical lower respiratory tract infections with macrolides or doxycycline. In the literature, however, the indication for antimicrobial therapy in atypical pneumonia and its effectiveness are discussed rather controversially [8, 22, 23] . Within a possible prospective PCT-guided intervention trial, children with atypical (predominantly M. pneumoniae and C. pneumoniae, only rare cases of L. pneumophila in childhood) respiratory tract infections and PCT levels <0.1 ng/ml would obviously not be treated with antibiotics. Given the controversial discussion on this issue, however, there seems to be no relevant loss of safety withholding antibiotic therapy in these children. If there are strong clinical or radiological hints for atypical pneumonia, respective antibiotic therapy should be discussed.",

Additionally, we judged the culture positive for S. aureus as contamination since the patient did not develop clinical signs of infection (confirmed by personal follow-up call after discharge).

In our study, CRP was \u226440 mg/l in 11 cases and 43 mg/l in one of the 12 patients with a PCT <0.1 ng/ml. None of these patients had clear evidence for significant bacterial infection.
