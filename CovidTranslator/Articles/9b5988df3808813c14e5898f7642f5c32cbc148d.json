In this study, 1104 clinically diagnosed HFMD patients were included. Enterovirus 71 (EV71), coxsackievirus A16 (CA16), and 14 different respiratory pathogens were examined from nasopharyngeal swabs using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) or reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR). To evaluate the immune activation in HFMD patients, 8 cytokines and IgM antibodies to EV71 and CA16 from mild and severe patients were detected. Our results indicated that the severity of HFMD may affect the pathogen detection. The lower positive rates of enterovirus and respiratory viruses in severe HFMD cases by RT-PCR were probably related to stronger immune response. Therefore, immunological tests such as ELISA are essential supplements to PCR or RT-PCR in order to increase pathogen diagnosis in HFMD, especially in severe cases.",

Although other types of enterovirus (EV), such as coxsackie virus A4-A7, B2-B5, and EV18 are related to HFMD, human EV71 and coxsackievirus A16 (CA16) are the main pathogens (Bruu, 2003) . Severe cases with neurological and cardiopulmonary complications, such as aseptic meningitis, encephalitis, and poliomyelitis-like paralysis, are mainly caused by EV71 (Chong et al., 2003; McMinn et al., 2001; Wang et al., 1999 , Weng et al., 2010 .

It has been reported that different types of sample, early or multiple sampling may affect the positive rate of RT-PCR (Singh et al., 2002) . Immune detection of IgM antibody against EV71 or CA16 using serum samples, which is meaningful for early diagnosis, has been established (Hong et al., 2012; Xu et al., 2010) . However, the performance of the methods had not been fully evaluated. Recent studies have indicated that some antiviral proinflammatory and inflammatory cytokines were increasing after EV infection, especially in severe HFMD cases, and have been associated with certain adverse outcomes (Chung et al., 2008; Khong et al., 2011; Lin et al., 2002) . The strong or abnormal activation of the immune system in severe HFMD cases may affect the method choice concerning pathogen detection using either molecular methods or immune detection focus on IgM antibody.",

Of the 233 severe cases, the mean age was 1.91, and 67.8% were male. Of the 871 mild cases, the mean age was 2.24, and 58.4% were male. All the patients were given a clinical diagnosis of HFMD by senior physicians with special training, and in accordance with the HFMD clinical diagnosis guidelines published in 2009 by the Chinese Ministry of Health. According to the guidelines, the mild cases were characterized by fever or not, with herpetic stomatitis and a rash on the hands and feet. The cases with any neurological signs and cardiopulmonary complications, such as aseptic meningitis, encephalitis, and poliomyelitis-like paralysis, were defined as severe cases.",

The incidence of both MP and CP was lower than in some other reports (Defilippi et al., 2008 , Kese et al., 2002 , MC et al., 2009 ; this may be due to the fact that we did not focus on children with acute respiratory infection (Defilippi et al., 2008) or on patients in winter and spring when there are more likely to be epidemics of CP or MP (Kese et al., 2002 , MC et al., 2007 , MC et al., 2009 . Furthermore, it may be that the pharyngeal swabs special for virus preservation decreased the MP/ CP detection rate compared with sputum samples used in other studies, and the single sampling may also decreased detection rate.

Therefore, a hypothesis was proposed that this difference was a result of stronger activation of acute immune reaction in the severe patients. Earlier studies have indicated that increased proinflammatory and inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-\u03b1 and IL-6 secretion was detected after EV or respiratory pathogen infection (Cello et al., 1996 , Chung et al., 2008 , H\u00e4rk\u00f6nen et al., 2003 , Khong et al., 2011 , Lin et al., 2002 . Studies have suggested that the enhanced expression of IL-1, IL-6, IL-10, IL-13, IFN-\u03b3 and TNF is associated with life-threatening complications in severe HFMD cases (Lin et al., 2002 , Lin et al., 2003 , Wang et al., 2003 . Some cytokines, including IL-6, IL-10, IFN-\u03b3, transforming growth factor, and GM-CSF, have been reported to have specific or nonspecific antiviral effects (Ank et al., 2006 , Brooks et al., 2006 , Hong et al., 2012 , Huang et al., 2011 . A recent study indicated that EV71 infection increased the expression of IFN-\u03b3-inducible protein 10 (IP-10). High level of IP-10 was found in the plasma of severe HFMD patients with encephalitis, with functions to enhance viral clearance, increase IFN-\u03b3 expression and boost the infiltration of CD8 T cells (Shen et al., 2013) . Therefore, such a strong immunoreaction not only plays an important role in the pathogenesis of severe HFMD but also might affect the choice of the detection method. In this study, seven cytokines were much higher in severe cases than in mild cases. This finding supports our hypothesis and also indicates that detecting the levels of these cytokines may be utilized as an auxiliary diagnostic method to evaluate disease progression.",

In this situation, stronger immune activation in severe HFMD is coupled with the generation of specific antibodies and elimination of specific pathogens. Therefore, detection rate of EV an RV by RT-PCR was decreased. There was no difference in MP and CP detection between the severe group and mild group, suggesting that the elimination mechanism of CP/MP infection should differ from that of RV and EV. That is, the immune response which takes place in EV/RV infection is ineffective with CP/MP. Whereas virus isolation is still the \"golden standard\" for the HFMD diagnosis, it detects active replicative viruses relative to RT-PCR. Some relevant studies indicated the EV71 detection rate by virus culture is about 20% or even lower in the RT-PCR positive cases (Singh et al., 2002) . Practical RT-PCR methods have been used in worldwide (de Crom et al., 2011 , Watkins-Riedel et al., 2002 . However, enhanced immunoreaction in severe HFMD may eliminate EV and RV quickly from the nasopharynx, thus decreasing the detection rate by RT-PCR. Alternatively, studies indicated that the positive rates of IgM antibody for CA16 and EV71 could get more than 90% at day 7 after onset (Xu et al., 2010 , Xu et al., 2011 . The rapid generation of such antibodies was confirmed again in present study and, on the other hand, clarified the characteristics of immune response to EV. In view of this, RT-PCR detection combined with serum immunoassays, such as ELISA and cytokine profile detection, could be used for the early diagnosis of EV infection, especially in cases of severe HFMD.",

Furthermore, lower positive rates of EV and RV in clinically severe cases are possibly due to a stronger immune response. Therefore, immunological tests such as ELISA and cytokine detection could be essential supplements to RT-PCR in order to increase pathogen diagnosis in HFMD patients, especially in severe clinical cases.",
