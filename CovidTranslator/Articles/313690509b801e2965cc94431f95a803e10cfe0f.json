Animal inoculation did not lead to illness or isolation of a causative agent, except for illness in two guinea pigs which could not be passed to others through inoculation of organ suspensions. Such a pattern of failure to produce illness after the first passage might be produced by a toxin rather than an infectious agent. Other authors have also reported producing illness in guinea pigs which could not be further transmitted by passage of organ suspensions or blood? 4",

Although Caucasian children have been the majority group affected in two other community-wide outbreaks of KS, these areas have populations which are predominantly Caucasian, with very few Oriental children at risk. In a report on endemic cases reported to the Centers for Disease Control from the entire United States, Oriental children were also overrepresented and Caucasian children were underrepresented. 15 We were unable to determine whether this ethnic predilection for Japanese children is related to a specific genetic susceptibility or to environmental influences. We are currently engaged in studying the distribution of HLA A, B, and D types among patients with KS. In contrast to one report which found a twofold excess of HLA BW22, we and two other groups have not found an excess of any HLA A or B antigen among patients compared to controls. This investigation does indicate that environmental influences are an unlikely explanation for the overrepresentation of Japanese children among KS patients; the majority of patients had a middle-class American life-style.",

            "text": "syndrome, and the absence of cases older than eight years, together with the occurrence of epidemics, strongly suggest that an infectious agent or agents is involved in its pathogenesis. There are suggestions from the urticarial nature of the rash and the pathologic demonstration of vasculitis, arthritis, and carditis appearing in the subacute period, that hypersensitivity or a unique reaction pattern to an inciting agent may be involved. There are hints from our study and from other reports that previous exposure to the agent may have occurred in some cases. The most convincing case for \"recurrent disease\" was provided by the girl who died; three months previously she had had an illness which fulfilled diagnostic criteria for KS. We suggest that the disease results from an immunologically mediated reaction to an infectious agent which spreads widely through the community. As with poliomyelitis, upper class, \"clean,\" life-styles may influence age at onset or prior immunologic experience, and therefore the rates of clinical KS. This hypothetical undiscovered agent may be a single as yet uncharacterized or difficult-to-cultivate microorganism which can set off this unique reaction pattern just as the fl-hemolytic streptococcus incites the poststreptococcal complications of rheumatic fever and glomerulonephritis. Alternately, multiple agents may be able to incite the complete pattern of KS, just as influenza and varicella are associated with Reye syndrome and Mycoplasma, streptococci, and drugs are related to the Stevens-Johnson syndrome.",
