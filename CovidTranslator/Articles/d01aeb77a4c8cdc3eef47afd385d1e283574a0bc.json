            "text": "Although vaccines have been very successful in controlling many viral diseases, some diseases are likely to be controlled only by antiviral chemotherapy. The concept of antiviral drugs has only been accepted slowly, partly because of the toxicity of many of the earlier antiviral agents. In contrast to the development of antibiotics, attempts to develop antiviral drugs have indeed met a variety of problems. Being strictly dependent on cellular metabolic processes, viruses possess only limited intrinsic enzyme systems and building blocks that may serve as specific targets for a drug. Moreover, contrary to a bacteriostatic compound, an effective antiviral drug should not only display considerable specificity in its antiviral action, but should also irreversibly block viral synthesis in order to stop cell suicide due to the viral infection and restore normal cell synthesis (Vanden Berghe et al., 1986) . In addition to this inhibition, the antiviral agent must have a broad spectrum of activity, favorable pharmacodynamic properties, and not be immunosuppressive. In the ideal situation, the antiviral drug checks the infection while the immune system prepares to destroy the last virus particles (Munro et al., 1987) . This point is critical for those immune-compromised by illness (AIDS, cancer) or drug therapy (transplants, cancer). A frequent cause of death in these instances is from viral infections, so that adjuvant antiviral chemotherapy is vital in these circumstances (Shannon and Schabel, 1980) . Many viral infectious diseases still cause high mortality. Although antiviral chemotherapy has shown outstanding progress, antiviral agents are still required. The emergence of drug-resistant viruses during treatment raises a potential problem for effective therapy. Furthermore, new viral pathogens may be discovered. Biologically active substances of plant origin have long been known as viral inhibitors. These antiviral compounds may be extracted from sources, such as higher plants, which have, for various reasons, been explored considerably less than the traditional ones.",

Methisazone (25 mg/kg) was found to inhibit Variola virus in mice and was later used successfully to treat cases of eczema vaccinatum and to treat and prevent smallpox. Kaufman et al. (1962) , an ophthalmologist, successfully treated a herpes eye infection with an antineoplastic drug, Idoxuridine. At the same time, a group of chemists at the Du Pont chemical company in the United States investigated the antiviral activity of a molecule called Amantadine. It was active against influenza virus type A. In rapid succession, further nucleoside analogs, cytosine arabinoside, trifluorothymidine, and adenine arabinoside, were found to inhibit herpes virus. In the 1970s, the antiherpes activity of a new compound, 9-(2-hydroxyethoxymethyl) guanine (Acyclovir), was detected by J. Bauer at the Wellcome Research Labs. Within a decade, the same group was to discover azidothymidine (Zidovudine), the first effective inhibitor of the newly emerged HIV. The alkaloid from the Australian horse chestnut (Castanospermine australe), isolated in the 1980s, was also found to be active against HIV.",

The antiviral screening system should meet all requirements of any good assay, including validity, lack of ambiguity, accuracy, reproducibility, simplicity, and reasonable cost. Moreover, because we are dealing with plant extracts, the antiviral screen should be highly selective, specific, and sensitive; it is advisable to discriminate a true antiviral activity from a viricidal one at this stage. Because most of the aforementioned requirements are better met by in vitro testing, we not only prefer in vitro screening of the plant extracts, but also the use of the same bioassay to guide the isolation of the antivirally active compounds from the plant extracts. The antiviral activity of the pure compounds then has to be confirmed in a later stage by in vivo assays (Leven et al., 1982; Vanden Berghe et al., 1986) .",

            "text": "The plant kingdom is highly diverse and ranges from unicellular microscopic plants to long lived, huge trees. To screen each and every plant or their individual parts for the identification of antiviral components is a huge task. Several examples of plants having antiviral properties and newly identified active compounds from them are reported in various journals. One of the examples that can be cited here is cyanovirin N (CV-N), an 11-kDa protein isolated from the cyanobacterium Nostoc ellipsosporum, which exhibits the property of inhibiting HIV-1 infection and also possesses broad-spectrum activity. The phytochemical, Podophyllotoxin, isolated from the aqueous extract of Podophyllum peltatum L., inhibited HSV type 1 (HSV-1) (Bedows and Hatfield, 1982) . The acetone extract of another plant, Phyllanthus urinaria, also suppressed HSV-2 and HSV-1 (Yang et al., 2007) . Bessong et al. (2006) reported a comparison of various plants and their individual parts (stem, leaves, roots, and so forth.) in repressing viral reverse transcriptase (RT) and integrase, the two basic enzymes in HIV disease. After comparing all the extracts and fractions of the various plants, it was found that the n-butanol fraction of Bridelia micrantha (Hochst) exhibited the highest anti-RT activity. It has also been reported that the aqueous extract from the roots of Carissa edulis (Forssk.) Vahl, a plant grown in Kenya, displayed noteworthy activity against HSV for both wild type and resistant strains (Tolo et al., 2006) . Polyphenol-rich extract from the medicinal plant Geranium sanguineum L. has been reported to show a strong antiinfluenza virus activity, as well as antioxidant and radical scavenging capacities (Sokmen et al., 2005) Hepatitis A, B, C, D, and E viruses are the leading causes for the prevalence of viral hepatitis and liver inflammation. Despite the fact that presentation to any of these infections prompts intense disease, in any case, types B, C, and D are unique in causing chronic infection. Plants belonging to the genus Phyllanthus of the Euphorbiaceae family were extensively used as a traditional remedy against these infections. Clinical investigations were additionally intended to look at the inhibitory effects of different species of Phyllanthus, that is, P. amarus (L.), P. niruri (L.), and P. urinaria (L.) (Wang et al., 1995) . The screening of 56 different Chinese medicinal herbs led to the identification of two potent plant extracts against Duck hepatitis B virus, namely, Ardisia chinensis and Pithecellobium clypearia . Similarly, this also led to the identification of Oenanthe javanica (Blume) DC flavones (OjF). They acted as a strong inhibitor of HBsAg and HBeAg secretion (involved in viral pathogenesis) in 2.2.15 cells and also reduced DHBV-DNA levels in the HBV-infected duck model (Wang et al., 2005) . Because of the strong prevalence of HCV infection in poor countries, screening for the identification of anti-HCV potentials from medicinal plants are still ongoing. According to Hussein et al. (2000) various plant extracts, such as methanol extracts Acacia nilotica L. Willd ex Delile, Boswellia carterii, Embelia schimperi, Quercus infectoria, Trachyspermum ammi L., and aqueous extracts of Piper cubeba L., Q. infectoria, and Syzygium aromaticum L., were found to possess significant inhibitory activity against HSV.",

One such illustration is the atomic investigation of the heated water concentrates of Stevia rebaudiana L., which blocked a section of different irresistible serotypes of HRV into permissive cells by an anionic polysaccharide having a molecular weight of 9800 with uronic acid as a noteworthy sugar constituent (Takahashi et al., 2001) . Thus, an alkaloid concentrate of Haemanthus albiflos globules repressed RNA amalgamation of HRV spread in MA-104 cells (Husson et al., 1994) .",

This is due chiefly to the complexity of the different techniques involved in such research, which consequently requires the know-how and dedication of a multidisciplinary team. Nevertheless, many antiviral agents have been isolated from natural sources and partly or completely characterized. From these studies, several substances have emerged as true antivirals having a good chemotherapeutic index based on the viability of infected cells and on in vivo tests. Thus, different 3-methoxy flavones and synthetic derivatives have shown to be promising leads for the development of antirhinovirus drugs (Van Hoof et al., 1984; Vlientinck et al., 1988) , whereas the spanonin, glycyrrhizic acid, was found to be highly active in vitro against herpes simplex (Pompei et al., 1979) , varizella-zoster (Baba and Shijeta, 1987) , and human immunodeficiency viruses (Ito et al., 1987) . Whether these compounds have any clinical potential, that is, in the therapy of the corresponding viral diseases, remains to be determined. There, in vivo bioavailability and other pharmacokinetic parameters are subjects of future study.",

            "text": "Because of the problems of drug resistance stated earlier and of side effects, the pharmaceutical industry is looking forward toward natural products (mainly medicinal plant extracts) as a source of possible antiviral agents. Approximately 2500 medicinal plant species have been recorded globally to treat a myriad of inflictions and diseases. Polyphenols, alkaloids, flavonoids, saponins, quinones, terpenes, proanthocyanidins, lignins, tannins, polysaccharides, steroids, thiosulfonates, and coumarins are prominent bioactive phytochemicals that have been observed to combat viral infections, as they are harmless to the systems of the human body. Some selected anthraquinones and anthraquinone derivatives are noted for their Dammarane saponins, ginsenoside Rb1 (GRb1), and Chikusetsusaponin (Chi-III) have been found to possess antiviral activity against HSV-I using an in vitro plaque elimination assay. Chi-III prevented plaque formation at half the concentration of GRb1 (Fukushima et al., 1995 (Hudson and Towers, 1995) . The inhibitory effect of ferulic acid and isoferulic acid on murine interleukin-8 production in response to influenza virus infections in vitro has been reported (Hirabayashi et al., 1995) and the effect of isoferulic acid was found to be greater than that of ferulic acid. Hayashi et al. (1995) found a direct inhibitory activity of the steam distillate prepared from fresh plants of Houttuynia cordata (Saururaceae) against HSV-1, influenza virus, and HIV-1, without showing cytotoxicity, but not against Poliovirus and Coxsackie virus. Montanha et al. (1995a) evaluated the action of a series of 19 Aporphine alkaloids against HSV-1 in cell cultures. On the basis of viral titer reduction, six alkaloids were found to be active. Ellagitannins isolated from Phyllanthus myrtifolius and P. urinaria (Euphorbiaceae) showed activity against Epstein-Barr virus DNA polymerase. Flavonoidal constituents, such as biflavonoids and robustaflavones, exhibited strong inhibitory effects against influenza A and B viruses. The antiviral potential of the flavonoids of Chamaesyce thymifolia has been reported; they showed high cytotoxicity on HEp-2 cells and moderate inhibitory activity against HSV-1 and bovine viral diarrhea virus (Amaral et al., 1999) . Sotanaphun et al. (1999) isolated Sclerocarpic acid from the stem bark of Glyptopetalum sclerocarpum, which exhibited antiviral activity against Herpes simplex virus types 1 and 2. Rhamnan sulfate, a natural sulfated polysaccharide isolated from Monostroma latissimum, showed potent inhibitory effects on the virus replication of HSV-1, HCMV, and HIV-1 in vitro . Matsuse et al. (1999) tested aqueous and methanolic extracts of 39 Panamanian medicinal plants for anti-HIV effects. Seven of these were found to be moderate inhibitors of HIV-protease enzyme. Serkedjieva and Ivancheva (1999) investigated the inhibitory effect of five extracts from the Bulgarian medicinal plant G. sanguineum on Herpes simplex virus types 1 and 2. Yoosook et al. (1999) evaluated the anti-HSV-2 activities of Barleria lupulina and Clinacanthus nutans. The results suggested a therapeutic potential against HSV-2 for B. lupulina, but not for C. nutans. The antiviral activities of various water and methanol soluble substances isolated from G. lucidum against HSV types 1 and 2, influenza A virus, and vesicular stomatitis virus were studied using cytopathic effect inhibition assay and plaque reduction assay (Eo et al., 1999) . Kudi and Myint (1999) investigated the antiviral activity of medicinal plant extracts against Poliovirus, Astrovirus, HSV, and Parvovirus. Most of the extracts showed activity against more than one virus at a dose rate of between 100 and 400 \u03bcg/100 \u03bcL (Eo et al., 1999) . Bourne et al. (1999) assessed 19 plant products in vitro by plaque reduction assay to determine their activity against a commonly transmitted pathogen, Herpes Simplex virus type 2. Docherty et al. (1999) found that Resveratrol, a phytoalexin, inhibited HSV-1 and HSV-2 replication in a dose-dependent reversible manner. Anani et al. (2000) prepared methanol extracts from 19 medicinal plants of Togo and analyzed them for antiviral and antibiotic activities. Ten of the 19 showed significant antiviral activity against one or another of the test viruses (Herpes Simplex, Sindbis, and Poliovirus). Hudson et al. (2000a, b) evaluated ethanolic extracts of 11 plants, endemic to Madagascar, in order to determine the potential of Malagasy plants as sources of antiviral activities. Nine of the extracts had significant activity against HSV, whereas only four were active against the Sindbis virus. A bioactive flavonoid, \"Baicalein,\" isolated from the Chinese medicinal plant Scutellaria baicalensis Georgi showed antiviral properties using the high-speed countercurrent chromatography (HSCCC) technique (Li and Chen, 2005) .",

In the fruits of Schisandra chinensis (schizandraceae) used in oriental medicine, 22 lignans were identified, some of which, such as Wuweizisu C and Gomisine N, are very active. The same method threw light on the mechanism of the antihepatotoxic action of such well-known compounds as glycyrrhizin and its intestinal metabolites, which are protective against the first stages preceding hepatic lesions. Other tests of this type are used to track down active substances. From Taxus baccata, Potier's group isolated new analogs of taxol, a terpenic compound displaying very good antileukemic and antitumor activities. Taxol promotes the polymerization of tubulin into microtubules and inhibits their depolymerization. The choice among various fractions obtained by extraction was guided by the antitubulin activity in an in vitro test. Many substances that are present in only trace quantities and are difficult to purify have been studied chemically; for example, the demonstration of xylose-bearing derivatives is new in this series of compounds. Regarding structure activity relationships, in vitro cytotoxicity tests have shown that the activity is mainly related to the presence of a complex ester function in the compound. A list of plant extracts and their phytoconstituents that have antiviral potentials are listed in Table 16 .1.",

Most labs use a biological test system in which new molecules are added to tissue culture cells at a range of concentrations (e.g., 100-1000 \u03bcg/ mL); the drug-treated cells (and untreated cells as control) are then infected with a known multiplicity of infective virus particles. Thousands of compounds can inhibit viral replication in a cell culture. In general, the more complex the regulatory mechanisms of a virus, the easier it is to find molecules that inhibit it. A broad estimate of the ratios of the activity of antiviral compounds in a cell culture, animal models, and humans is 1000:10:1. During the evaluation of antiviral agents, many test conditions, such as the cell culture system, virus strain, virus challenge dose, virus input multiplicity of infection, and time of harvesting, can affect or even alter the test results. To test the inhibitory activity of a new antiviral agent, it is first necessary to select the host cell system(s) in which the virus replication can be measured. Viruses vary considerably in their ability to replicate in cultured cells. Many viruses can cause CPE while some of them can form plaques. Others can produce some specialized functions, such as hemagglutination, hemadsorption, or cell transformation. Virus replication in cell cultures can also be detected by the presence of viral products, namely, viral DNA, RNA, or polypeptides.",

Mosmann, Borenfreund, and Puerner first advocated the application of tetrazolium (MTT) and Neutral Red (NR) assay, respectively, to quantitate cell viability and the cytotoxicity to cells in vitro. Parida et al. (1999) compared the efficacy of two colorimetric assays (MTT and Neutral Red) to determine viral infectivity in microculture virus titration employing Polio virus type-3 and Dengue virus type-4. MTT assay, also known as tetrazolium assay, has been exploited extensively to reveal the protective efficacy of therapeutic agents and plant extracts against cancer, HIV-1, HSV, Polio virus type 3, DEN-4 virus, and to the determination of neutralizing antibody levels to HIV and Respiratory syncytial virus. MTT assay using microculture virus titration (MCVT) was applied for the determination of infectivity titers of Influenza viruses and was found to be compatible with the well-established procedure of egg infectivity assay. Unlike MTT, neutral red dye uptake assay has not been substantially exploited in virologic research. NR dye assay was earlier performed for the study of the antiviral efficacy of basil leaves extract against Polio virus type 3. MTT, a tetrazolium salt, is a yellow-colored dye [3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide] which gets cleared by mitochondrial succinate dehydrogenase enzyme into a blue-colored formazan in active cells. This product does not form crystals when it interacts with isopropyl alcohol and thus can be accurately measured. There is no need to harvest the viable cells, wherein the cell viability can be directly measured by a spectrophotometer (Parida et al., 1999) . The assay procedure has been discussed in Section 16.6.7.",

As already mentioned, the maintenance medium may contain antibiotics, such as penicillin G (20 \u03bcg mL \u22121 ), neomycin (1 \u03bcg mL \u22121 ), and amphotericin B (1 \u03bcg mL \u22121 ), in order to avoid sterilization of the test solutions. Any contamination by bacteria or fungi would indeed ruin the in vitro antiviral bioassay (Colegate and Molyneux, 1993) .",

(iii) Third, the EPTT using serial diluted extracts deals with a dynamic process, because the cells are subsequently infected with different MOI. (iv) This system allows the correlation of all possible MOI values in the same microtiter plate with decreasing amounts of plant extracts, so that the noncytotoxic concentration of plant extracts can be determined. At the same time, a correlation between extract toxicity and antiviral activity according to the corresponding MOI can be determined in the same microtiter plate. (v) It can be stated as a general rule that the detected antiviral activity should be stable in at least two subsequent dilutions of nontoxic concentration of the extract; otherwise the activity is directly correlated with the toxicity of the extract or is only viricidal. Moreover, a true antiviral product has to protect the cells, which have been infected with low virus dilutions (starting from 0.1 PFU per cell onward). (vi) Finally, it should be stressed that all possible steps of virus manipulation are to be completed before the plant extracts are added. This means that an antiviral product TCD 50 mL \u22121 ), under nontoxic conditions, must act on virus replication steps after uncoating.

Moreover, in a cell culture display, antiviral activity of an investigational item can be the aftereffect of host cell death after exposure to the item. Cytotoxicity tests utilize a series of increasing concentrations of the antiviral product to determine what concentration results in the death of 50% of the host cells. This value is referred to as the median cellular cytotoxicity concentration (CC50 or CTC50 or CCIC50). The relative effectiveness of the investigational product in inhibiting viral replication compared with inducing cell death is defined as the therapeutic or selectivity index (CC50 value/EC 50 value). It is desirable to have a high therapeutic index giving maximum antiviral activity with minimal cell toxicity. According to US FDA guidelines, it is recommended to determine CC50 values in both stationary and dividing cells from multiple relevant human cell types and tissues to establish the potential for cell cycle, species, or tissue-specific toxicities. Studies determining cytotoxicity and therapeutic indexes should be conducted before the initiation of phase 1 clinical studies.

The currently accessible antivirals, however effective, are exorbitant and past the reach of a majority of individuals. Along these lines, the advancement of safe, effective, and low-cost antiviral medications, for example, RT inhibitors, is among the top priorities, as many viral infections are not yet treatable and have high death rates. For the past few years, substantial work has been carried out regarding the effectiveness of medicinal plants on HIV infection (Premanathan et al., 1999; Calabrese et al., 2000; Asres et al., 2001) and an increasing popularity of over-the-counter plant products containing orthodox drugs has been observed. The main focus is to lower the adverse effects associated with viral infections and an inclination toward synergistic interactions of multiple molecules present in plant extracts. Be that as it may, because mostly pharmacological mechanisms of the combinations are not studied, antagonistic impacts or remedial disappointments have been seen (Chan et al., 2000) . A prerequisite that should be considered significant for medicinal plants is to identify and standardize the method of extract preparation, the suitable season for collecting plant material, and the details of its administration (Chattopadhyay et al., 2006) . As a lot of plant extracts and subsequent formulations have shown significant outcomes, it seems to be rational to endorse the idea of the study of medicinal plants as a quest to find potential antivirals.",
