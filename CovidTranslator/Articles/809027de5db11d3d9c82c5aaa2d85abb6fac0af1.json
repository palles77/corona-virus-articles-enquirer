            "text": "By co-opting host proteins for their replication, plus-stranded RNA viruses can support robust replication and suppress host anti-viral responses. Tomato bushy stunt tombusvirus (TBSV) recruit the cellular heat shock protein 70 (Hsp70), an abundant cytosolic chaperone, into the replicase complex. By taking advantage of yeast model host, we demonstrate that the four-member SSA subfamily of HSP70 genes is essential for TBSV replication. The constitutively-expressed SSA1 and SSA2, which are resident proteins in the viral replicase, can be complemented by the heat-inducible SSA3 and/or SSA4 for TBSV replication. Using a yeast strain carrying a temperature sensitive ssa1 ts , but lacking functional SSA2/3/4, we show that inactivation of Ssa1p ts led to a defect in membrane localization of the viral replication proteins, resulting in cytosolic distribution of the viral proteins and lack of replicase activity. An in vitro replicase assembly assay with Ssa1p ts revealed that functional Ssa1p is required during the replicase assembly process, but not during minus-or plus-strand synthesis. Temperature shift experiments from nonpermissive to permissive in ssa1 ts yeast revealed that the re-activated Ssa1p ts could promote efficient TBSV replication in the absence of other SSA genes. We also demonstrate that the purified recombinant Ssa3p can facilitate the in vitro assembly of the TBSV replicase on yeast membranes, demonstrating that Ssa3p can fully complement the function of Ssa1p. Taken together, the cytosolic SSA subfamily of Hsp70 proteins play essential and multiple roles in TBSV replication.",

            "text": "TBSV, a small (+)RNA virus is used to dissect the roles of host proteins within the viral replicase, which is the key enzyme for viral genome replication. The tombusvirus replicase has been intensively characterized via proteomics approaches, in vitro replication assays and development of yeast as a model host Li et al., 2009; Nagy, 2008; Nagy and Pogany, 2000; Panavas and Nagy, 2003; Panaviene et al., 2004; Serva and Nagy, 2006; Wang and Nagy, 2008) . Previous work revealed that TBSV RNA replication depends on two viral-encoded proteins, namely the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (p92 pol RdRp) and p33 replication co-factor, the key protein in recruitment of the viral RNA into replication (Monkewich et al., 2005; Pogany, White, and Nagy, 2005) . The peroxisome membrane-bound TBSV replicase also contains 6to-10 host proteins, which are likely involved in most activities of the replicase (Nagy and Pogany, 2006; White and Nagy, 2004) . The identified host proteins within the tombusvirus replicase include heat shock protein 70 (Hsp70, coded by the constitutively-expressed SSA1 and SSA2 genes in yeast) and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH, coded by TDH2 and TDH3 genes in yeast), which binds to the TBSV (\u2212)RNA and affects plus-strand synthesis (Wang and Nagy, 2008) . The replicase also contains translation elongation factor 1A (eEF1A), which binds to a cis-acting regulatory element in the TBSV (+)RNA as well as to p33 co-factor (Li et al., 2009) . Another host-derived component is Cdc34p ubiquitinconjugating enzyme, which ubiquitinates the p33 replication co-factor . Downregulation of these host factors inhibited, whereas their over-expression increased TBSV accumulation in yeast model host Serva and Nagy, 2006; Wang and Nagy, 2008) suggesting that they play significant roles in TBSV replication. In addition, Pex19p cytosolic transport protein binds transiently to the viral replication proteins as well as to the replicase complex, likely facilitating the transport of the replication proteins to the peroxisomal membranes, the site of replication (Pathak, Sasvari, and Nagy, 2008) . The functions of the above host proteins within the viral replicase are currently under intensive investigations.",

Based on the known cellular functions, Hsp70 and other chaperones were proposed to stimulate viral RdRp activity (Momose et al., 2002) , and participate in the assembly of the viral replicase and enhance replication (Kampmueller and Miller, 2005; Tomita et al., 2003; Weeks and Miller, 2008) . Plants infected by various plant viruses express cytosolic Hsp70 proteins at elevated levels, indicating that Hsp70 could play an important role during viral infections (Aparicio et al., 2005; Aranda et al., 1996; Whitham et al., 2003; Whitham, Yang, and Goodin, 2006) . Moreover, a viral-encoded Hsp70-like protein is involved in the assembly of virions and cell-to-cell movement of closteroviruses (Alzhanova et al., 2001; Peremyslov, Hagiwara, and Dolja, 1999) . In addition, Hsp70-like proteins are involved in nuclear localization, genome replication and cell transformation of DNA viruses, cell entry, virion assembly and disassembly, envelope protein maturation, folding of capsid proteins, and viral transcription by various viruses (Mayer, 2005) . Additional cellular chaperones, such as Hsp90 proteins or the J-domain containing Hsp40 proteins have also been shown to affect virus replication, including activation of reverse transcriptase for hepadnaviruses (Hu et al., 2004; Stahl et al., 2007; Tavis, Massey, and Gong, 1998) , or assembly of the BMV replicase (Tomita et al., 2003) . Most of the above studies point toward Hsp70 and other cellular chaperones as major players during virus replication.",

            "text": "Host proteins could play different roles during tombusvirus replication. Currently, tombusvirus replication is divided into six sequential steps: RNA template selection by p33 replication protein; recruitment of the replication protein-viral RNA complex to the site of replication; assembly of the viral replicase complex; synthesis of viral progeny RNAs, including minusand plus-strand synthesis; release of the newly made plus-strand viral RNAs from the replicase and disassembly of the viral replicase (Nagy and Pogany, 2006) . Hsp70 proteins might play multiple roles/functions in TBSV replication. Accordingly, the two cytosolic Ssa1p and Ssa2p Hsp70 proteins expressed constitutively in yeast have been shown to be recruited from the cytosol to the peroxisomal membrane (the site of TBSV replication) via interaction with the p33 replication co-factor (Serva and Nagy, 2006; Wang, Stork, and Nagy, 2009 ). Downregulation or over-expression of Ssa1/2p in yeast resulted in reduced and elevated level of TBSV RNA accumulation, respectively, suggesting that these Hsp70 proteins are important for TBSV RNA replication (Serva and Nagy, 2006) . These Hsp70 proteins are likely involved directly in replication since Ssa1/2p have been shown as components of the highly purified tombusvirus replicase complex (Serva and Nagy, 2006) . Using a HSP70 mutant yeast (ssa1ssa2), we found that the viral replication proteins remained cytosolic at an early time point, suggesting that Hsp70 is involved in subcellular localization of the viral replication proteins to intracellular membranes (Wang, Stork, and Nagy, 2009) . A novel in vitro replication assay also showed that Ssa1/2p are essential for the assembly of the TBSV replicase . An in vitro membrane insertion assay demonstrated that Hsp70 promoted the insertion of the viral replication proteins into the subcellular membranes (Wang, Stork, and Nagy, 2009 ). These functions of Hsp70 are not restricted to in vitro or yeast-based assays, since knockdown of cytosolic Hsp70 in plants or inhibition of Hsp70 with a chemical inhibitor were found to inhibit TBSV replication in a plant host (Wang, Stork, and Nagy, 2009 ).",

It is currently unknown if the function of Ssa1/2p is essential for TBSV replication and whether additional cellular Hsp70 or other heat shock proteins can complement the functions of Ssa1/2p for supporting TBSV replication. To address these questions and to further dissect the roles of Hsp70 in TBSV replication, in this work, we used a yeast strain lacking functional SSA2, SSA3 and SSA4 genes, while the SSA1 gene was either wt or temperature sensitive (ts). Based on the ssa1 ts strain, we demonstrate that the Ssa-subfamily of Hsp70 proteins is essential for TBSV replication in yeast. Using biochemical and temperature shift experiments, we show that Hsp70 is essential during the early steps of TBSV replication, but not during minus-and plus-strand synthesis.",

These observations indicate that either Ssa1p/Ssa2p are not essential for TBSV replication or they can be partially complemented possibly by other cellular chaperones. To test if complementation of TBSV replication can be enhanced by prior induction of heat shock proteins (Boorstein and Craig, 1990) , we incubated ssa1ssa2 mutant yeast at 42\u00b0C for 30 min prior to the induction of p33/p92 pol proteins and the TBSV DI-72 repRNA. In comparison with ssa1ssa2 mutant yeast grown at 23\u00b0C all the time (no heat shock), which support only 15% repRNA accumulation, the ssa1ssa2 mutant yeast treated with short heat-shock reached 80% repRNA accumulation of that measured in wt yeast (no heat shock) ( Fig. 1A versus 1B) . The stimulating effect of the short heat shock treatment prior to TBSV replication in ssa1ssa2 mutant yeast suggests that a heat-inducible host factor, likely a heat-shock protein, can efficiently complement the missing Ssa1/2p functions for TBSV replication.",

We will refer to these strains as SSA1 wt and ssa1 ts below.

Northern blot analysis of the RNA samples obtained after 18 hours of incubation at 32\u00b0C showed accumulation of TBSV repRNA to less than 1% in ssa1 ts yeast when compared to that of SSA1 wt ( Fig. 2A , lanes 3-4 versus 1-2). The accumulation of TBSV repRNA at 36\u00b0C was below detection limit in ssa1 ts yeast when compared to that of SSA1 wt ( Fig. 2A , lanes 8-10 versus 5-7). This low level of repRNA accumulation in ssa1 ts yeast grown at 32/36 \u00b0C is likely due to plasmid-borne transcription of repRNA (Panavas and Nagy, 2003) , indicating the lack of replication of the TBSV repRNA at 32 \u00b0C or at 36 \u00b0C in ssa1 ts yeast. Accordingly, isolation of the membrane-bound tombusvirus replicase complexes from the above yeast strains, followed by in vitro replicase assay using the co-purified TBSV repRNA showed undetectable level of replicase activity from ssa1 ts yeast grown at 32 \u00b0C, while the comparable assay from SSA1 wt grown at 32 \u00b0C showed easily detectable replicase activity in vitro (Fig.  2C ). In contrast, the membrane-bound tombusvirus replicase from ssa1 ts yeast grown at 23 \u00b0C was almost as active as that obtained from SSA1 wt grown at 23 \u00b0C (Fig. 2D ).

To test this question, we expressed GFP-SKL, which carries the C-terminal SKL sequence known to target proteins to peroxisome in wt yeast (Kragler et al., 1993) , from the GAL1 promoter. As expected, GFP-SKL was localized to the peroxisomal membrane, forming the punctate structure, in ssa1 ts yeast grown at the permissive 23\u00b0C temperature (Fig. 3B ).

Then, we added the replicase buffer and all four ribonucleotides, including 32 P-UTP, to the above membrane fraction to allow the RNA synthesis to occur by the preassembled TBSV replicase.

Since Ssa1p ts is partially inactive at 29\u00b0C in the in vitro replication assay, we propose based on the above results that Ssa1p ts is needed during the replicase assembly process, but not during RNA synthesis, which include both minus-and plus-strand synthesis in our in vitro replication assay . Accordingly, when we used 29\u00b0C during the assembly step and 20\u00b0C during the RNA synthesis step, then we observed TBSV repRNA replication occurring only in case of the Ssa1p wt , but not with the TBSV replicase containing Ssa1p ts (Fig. 5C , lanes 2, 4 versus 1 and 3). These data suggest that Ssa1p ts was defective in replicase assembly at 29\u00b0C in vitro, preventing the subsequent viral RNA synthesis at 20\u00b0C or 29\u00b0C. Altogether, the obtained results are in agreement with the model that Ssa1p is required prior/during the replicase assembly, but it is not needed during minus-and plus-strand synthesis in vitro.",

            "text": "Since ssa1 ts yeast cells survive short periods (up to 3 days) at the nonpermissive temperature (Becker et al., 1996) , we used temperature downshift experiments to test how TBSV replication is affected by the reactivation of Ssa1p ts by shifting to the permissive temperature. First, we cultured ssa1 ts yeast expressing YFP-p33 at 32\u00b0C, followed by decreasing the temperature to 23\u00b0C and shutting down the production of YFP-p33 by changing the carbon-source in the media from galactose to glucose. Using confocal microscopy, we observed that about 50% of yeast cells contained the characteristic punctate structures 6 h after the downshift, suggesting peroxisomal localization of YFP-p33 (Fig. 6A) . The other 50% of yeast cells still contained cytosolic YFP-p33, suggesting that the availability of the reactivated Ssa1p ts is limited (Fig.  6A) . Fractionation of the extracts of ssa1 ts yeast cells 6h after the switch to 23\u00b0C also showed similar ~50-50% distribution of YFP-p33 between the soluble or membrane-containing fractions (Fig. 6B, lanes 1-3 versus 7-9 ). In contrast, YFP-p33 expressed in ssa1 ts yeast at the nonpermissive temperature was found mostly in the soluble fraction (Fig. 6C , 0 hr time point). As expected, YFP-p33 expressed in SSA1 wt yeast was present in the membranous fraction regardless of the growth conditions ( Fig. 6B -C, 0 and 6 hr time points). The cytosolic cellular PGK protein and the membrane-bound cellular ALP protein were found in the expected fractions (Fig. 6B) . Altogether, these data are consistent with the model that correct peroxisomal localization of YFP-p33 requires a functional Ssa1p and reactivation of ssa1 ts by down-shifting to 23\u00b0C results in re-localization of p33 from the cytosol to the peroxisomal membrane in half of the ssa1 ts yeast cells by the 6 h time point.",

We found that 30 min after the downshift to 23\u00b0C, a small number of cells already showed several punctate structures, though the punctate structures became more visible by microscopy and detectable in the membrane fraction after 1-2 hours ( Fig. 7A and D) . The amounts of YFP-p33 and CFP-p92 in the membrane fraction became as abundant after 3 hours as after 6 hours (Fig. 7D, lanes 7-8 versus  11-12) . Interestingly, the sizes of individual punctate structures became bigger over time after the temperature downshift in the absence of new YFP-p33 synthesis (Fig. 7A ). This suggests on-going membrane rearrangement caused by the insertion of p33 into the membrane due to the presence of activated Ssa1p ts . Moreover, it seems that it requires 30 min to 3 hours for the re-activated Ssa1p ts to help re-localize YFP-p33 from the cytosol to the membrane. We observed the characteristic punctate structures with YFP-p33 in SSA1 wt yeast shifted from 32\u00b0C to 23\u00b0C or grown continuously at 23\u00b0C over time ( Fig. 7B-C) , suggesting that YFP-p33 localized correctly and efficiently in the presence of functional Ssa1p wt at both temperatures.",

            "text": "To test if the above observed changes in the subcellular localization of YFP-p33 during downshift to 23\u00b0C correlates with enhanced tombusvirus replicase activity, we measured the replicase activity on the co-purified repRNA in the membrane fraction of ssa1 ts yeast. We added either cycloheximide or glucose to the growth media to inhibit the production of new YFP-p33 and CFP-p92 in ssa1 ts yeast after downshifting the temperature (Fig. 8A-B) . It is important to note that the cycloheximide treatment down-regulates the production of all new host and viral proteins, while glucose selectively inhibits the production of new YFP-p33 and CFP-p92, which are driven from the GAL1 promoter. These in vitro experiments revealed that the replicase activity continuously increased in samples taken from 30 min to 4-6 hours, reaching to ~30% level of the replicase activity obtained with the preparation from ssa1 ts yeast cultured at 23\u00b0C (Fig. 8A) . Thus, it takes from 30 min to 3-4 hours for the re-activated Ssa1p ts to facilitate the assembly/activation of the tombusvirus replicase in the absence of new protein synthesis (+cyclehaximide, Fig. 8A, top panel) . Similarly, the membrane-localization of YFP-p33 also needed from 60 min to 3-4 hours under the same conditions (Fig. 8A , bottom panels). The picture was somewhat similar in the first 2 hours after the downshift to 23\u00b0C in ssa1 ts yeast cultured in the presence of glucose, which inhibits the production of new YFP-p33 and CFP-p92 (Fig. 8B) . However, the replicase activity at 3-4 hr time points reached up t\u00f5 40% of the replicase activity obtained with the preparation from ssa1 ts yeast cultured at 23\u00b0C (Fig. 8B ). This moderate increase in replicase activity when compared with the cycloheximide treatment (Fig. 8A) is likely due to the newly produced active Ssa1p ts after the downshift that seems to affect protein functions by the 4-hour time point. Indeed, we observed a ~6-fold increase in replicase activity from the 4-hour time point after the downshift in ssa1 ts yeast cultured at 23\u00b0C in a galactose containing media, thus resulting in new production of YFP-p33 and CFP-p92 as well as Ssa1p ts (Fig. 8C, lanes 9-12) . Altogether, these experiments demonstrated that the re-activated Ssa1p ts was capable of supporting efficient formation of the tombusvirus replicase, further confirming the essential role of cytosolic Hsp70 in tombusvirus replication.",

            "text": "Hsp70 is a highly conserved family of genes in all eukaryotic organisms showing high similarity with bacterial DnaK protein chaperones. Among the 14 HSP70 genes in yeast, SSA1-4, SSB1-2, and SSE1-2 are cytosolic, while others are localized in the ER or mitochondria (Ahsen and Pfanner, 1997; James, Pfund, and Craig, 1997) . In addition, the eukaryotic cell contains a battery of other protein chaperones, such as the HSP90 family and the J-domain HSP40 co-chaperones (Brodsky and Chiosis, 2006) . However, the purified tombusvirus replicase contains only Ssa1p and Ssa2p Hsp70 proteins at detectable level (Serva and Nagy, 2006) , suggesting that tombusviruses recruit only this group of cytosolic chaperones. Inactivation of SSA1/2, however, only partially debilitate TBSV repRNA accumulation (Fig.  1A ) (Serva and Nagy, 2006) , and prior heat shock treatment enhances TBSV replication, indicating that there is a heat shock inducible factor(s), which is capable of complementing the missing Ssa1/2p function for TBSV replication in yeast (Fig. 1B) . In this work, we demonstrate that complementation of SSA1/2 is due to the stress-inducible SSA3/4 genes, which are 80% homologous with SSA1/2 (Ahsen and Pfanner, 1997) . This conclusion is based on (i) that recombinant Ssa3p (Fig. 1C) can facilitate the assembly of the TBSV replicase in vitro; and (ii) we did not observe complementation of TBSV replication ( Fig. 2A) when we used ssa1 ts yeast strain lacking functional SSA2/3/4 and carrying ssa1 ts , which was inactivated at a nonpermissive temperature (Becker et al., 1996) . Also, the replicase preparation from ssa1 ts yeast grown at the nonpermissive temperature was inactive (Fig. 2C) , arguing that the SSA1/2/3/4 subfamily of HSP70 is essential for TBSV replication, albeit individual members in the subfamily play redundant function. Thus, the numerous other heat shock proteins of yeast cannot complement the functions provided by SSA subfamily for TBSV replication.",

The data presented in this and previous papers Wang, Stork, and Nagy, 2009) indicate that Ssa1p plays a role in the early steps of tombusvirus replication, including subcellular localization of the viral replication proteins, membrane insertion of the replication proteins and the assembly of the viral replicase complex. Accordingly, in vitro assembly of the TBSV replicase based on a yeast cell-free extract revealed that the constitutively expressed Ssa1p as well as the heat-induced Ssa3p (Fig. 1C ) could facilitate the assembly event. Also, YFP-p33 is mislocalized to the cytosol in ssa1 ts yeast cultured at the nonpermissive temperature, instead of forming puncate structures, which are characteristic for p33 associated with the peroxisomemembrane observed at the permissive temperature (Fig. 3A) . Thus, functional Ssa1p is required for correct subcellular localization of the viral replication proteins. Interestingly, based on time course experiments, in which Ssa1p ts was re-activated by shifting down to permissive temperature, we found correlation among accumulation of p33 in the membrane fraction (Fig.  7D) , the formation of punctate structures by YFP-p33 from the diffused cytosolic stage (Fig.  7A) , and the in vitro activity of the tombusvirus replicase in membrane preparations (Fig. 8A) , suggesting that Ssa1p is involved in these events. Indeed, we have shown previously that Ssa1p facilitates the membrane-insertion of p33 in vitro (Wang, Stork, and Nagy, 2009) . We have also shown that the targeted membranes include the peroxisome and ER membranes Pathak, Sasvari, and Nagy, 2008) . Apparently, the membrane insertion step for p33 and p92 pol is essential for the formation of active replicase complex, since the soluble, cytosolic tombusvirus replicase proteins cannot form functional replicase (Fig. 8B ) Panavas et al., 2005a; Wang, Stork, and Nagy, 2009) and no accumulation of TBSV repRNA is detected in yeast cells showing cytosolic distribution of YFP-p33 ( Fig. 2A and 6B ).",

Moreover, an in vitro TBSV replicase assembly assay performed with Ssa1p ts or Ssa1p wt at the permissive 20\u00b0C temperature, followed by RNA synthesis at a partially nonpermissive temperature for Ssa1p ts showed comparable level of activity for the replicase assembled with Ssa1p ts and Ssa1p wt (Fig. 5B) , arguing strongly against the role of Ssa1p during viral RNA synthesis in vitro.",

It took only 30 min to detect the activity of the tombusvirus replicase after the downshift (Fig. 8A-C) , which is similar to the time requirement for tombusvirus replicase assembly in vitro . However, the activity of the tombusvirus replicase increased ~10-fold when measured 3-4 hours after the downshift, suggesting that most of the replicase assembly or localization of the replication proteins take place slowly. We speculate that this slow replicase assembly and/or subcellular localization processes are due to the limiting amount of available re-activated Ssa1p ts since misfolded/mislocalized host proteins might also compete with the viral replication proteins for the service of Ssa1p ts after the downshift.",

The function of HSP70 is in the intracellular distribution and membrane insertion of the viral replication proteins, as well as the assembly of the viral replicase. Previous work has also shown the importance of the cytosolic Hsp70 in TBSV genomic RNA replication in plant cells and whole plant hosts based on knockdown and inhibition experiments (Wang, Stork, and Nagy, 2009 ).

Briefly, frozen yeast cells were homogenized with Genogrinder for 2 min at 1,500 rpm in 150 \u03bcl cold extraction buffer (200 mM sorbitol, 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 15 mM MgCl 2 , 10 mM KCl, 10 mM \u03b2-mercaptoethanol, yeast protease inhibitor mix; Sigma) plus 250 \u03bcl of glass beads. Each sample was further mixed with 600 \u03bcl prechilled extraction buffer, and unbroken cells were removed by centrifugation at 100 \u00d7 g for 5 min at 4\u00b0C. The supernatant was centrifuged for 10 min at 21,000 \u00d7 g at 4\u00b0C, and then the pellet was re-suspended and used in a standard tombusvirus replicase assay. Because no template was added to the in vitro reaction, the replicase preparation could only use the endogenous template present within the enriched membrane fraction. The replicase products were phenol-chloroform extracted, precipitated with isopropanol-ammonium acetate, and analyzed under denaturing conditions (5% PAGE containing 8 M urea).",

Increased accumulation of TBSV repRNA in ssa1ssa2 mutant yeast after short heat shock treatment. (A) Northern blot analysis of TBSV repRNA accumulation level in ssa1ssa2 mutant yeast cultured continuously at 23\u00b0C. TBSV repRNA accumulates to 15% in ssa1ssa2 mutant yeast of that found in wt yeast at the 16 hour time point after induction by galactose. The ribosomal (r)RNA is used as a loading control. (B) After 30 min heat shock treatment of yeast at 42\u00b0C, TBSV repRNA replication was launched by expression of p33/p92 and DI-72(+)RNA from the GAL1/GAL10 promoters in ssa1ssa2 mutant yeast by using culture media containing galactose, followed by shaking at 23\u00b0C. Northern blot analysis shows that TBSV repRNA accumulated to ~80% in the heat-treated ssa1ssa2 mutant yeast when compared to the wt yeast at the 16 hour time point. (C) Ssa3p can facilitate the in vitro assembly of the TBSV replicase. The purified recombinant FLAG-Ssa3p (lane 2) and FLAG-Ssa1p (lane 1) were added together with purified TBSV p33 (lanes 1-3) and p92 pol (lanes 1-3) to the membrane fraction of a cellfree extract prepared from untransformed yeast, which was programmed via the addition of 1 \u03bcg TBSV DI-72 (+)repRNA (lanes 1-3) .

Bottom panels: Ethidium bromide stained agarose gel shows repRNA and ribosomal rRNA levels in the total RNA samples in ssa1 ts and SSA1 wt yeast strains 16 hours after the induction of TBSV repRNA replication via galactose. Note that YFP-p33 and CFP-p92 each expressed from the GAL1 promoter, whereas DI-72 repRNA was expressed from the GAL10 promoter. (B) Western blot analysis to show the accumulation of YFP-p33 and CFP-p92 in ssa1 ts yeast and SSA1 wt yeast grown at 32\u00b0C. The yeast samples were the same as in panel A. (C) An in vitro replicase assay to test TBSV RNA synthesis in ssa1 ts yeast and SSA1 wt yeast grown at 32\u00b0C. We obtained the membrane fraction carrying the tombusvirus replicase from ssa1 ts yeast and SSA1 wt yeast grown at 32\u00b0C for 16 hours after the addition of galactose to induce TBSV replication.

The punctate structures show peroxisomal localization, while the \"doughnut\" -shape structure indicates cytosolic localization of p33 in yeast cells. The punctate structures formed in ssa1 ts yeast grown at 23\u00b0C are reminiscent of those found in SSA1 wt yeast (left side of the panel). (B) Cytosolic localization of peroxisome-targeted GFP, termed GFP-SKL, in ssa1 ts yeast grown at 36\u00b0C for 14 hours after induction from GAL1 promoter. Note that GFP-SKL carries the peroxisomal targeting sequence \"SKL\" at the C-terminus. The assembled tombusvirus replicase in the membrane fraction of ssa1 ts yeast is not temperature sensitive. Denaturing PAGE analysis shows the radiolabeled repRNAs produced by tombusvirus replicase preparations in vitro obtained from ssa1 ts yeast and SSA1 wt yeast grown at 23\u00b0C.

Ssa1p is required during the in vitro assembly of the TBSV replicase, but not during viral RNA synthesis. (A) A step-wise approach was used to separate the early steps, such as TBSV replicase assembly, from the late steps, which include viral RNA synthesis. The various components used in the procedure are listed. (B) Denaturing PAGE analysis of the radiolabeled in vitro replicase products obtained after the in vitro reconstitution of the TBSV replicase using the conditions shown during step 1 and step 3. (C) Similar analysis of the in vitro TBSV replicase assay with Ssa1p ts or Ssa1p wt as in panel B, except using different conditions during step 1 and step 3 as shown.

Time-course experiments to analyze re-distribution of p33 from the cytosol to the peroxisomes after shifting down the temperature from nonpermissive to permissive in ssa1 ts yeast. (A) Confocal laser microscopy shows the localization of YFP-p33 in ssa1 ts yeast grown at 23\u00b0C in a media containing glucose (to shut down the production of new p33/p92/repRNA) until the shown time point after switching from 32\u00b0C. See the details about yeast culturing in the legend to Fig. 6A . Note that the sizes of the characteristic punctate structures containing YFP-p33 grew over time in ssa1 ts yeast cells.

(A) Time-course experiments were performed to analyze the tombusvirus replicase activity in vitro in membrane fractions obtained from ssa1 ts yeast after shifting down the temperature from nonpermissive to permissive. p33/ p92 pol replication proteins and DI-72 repRNA were expressed from the GAL1/GAL10 promoters for 16 hours at 32\u00b0C, followed by adding cycloheximide (100 \u03bcg/ml final concentration, which halted yeast growth) to stop translation and shifting the temperature to 23\u00b0C to activate Ssa1p ts . Top panel: Denaturing PAGE analysis of in vitro replicase products obtained using the membrane-enriched fraction carrying the co-purified repRNA. The activity of the tombusvirus replicase (lanes 15-16) obtained from ssa1 ts yeast grown continuously at 23\u00b0C in the presence of cycloheximide was taken as 100%. Middle panel: Western blotting of YFP-p33 present in the membrane fractions used for the in vitro replicase assay in the top panel. Bottom panel: Western blotting of YFP-p33 present in the total protein extract that was used to adjust the amount of replication proteins in each sample. (B) Denaturing PAGE analysis of in vitro replicase products obtained using the membrane-enriched fraction carrying the copurified repRNA. The replicase preparations were obtained from ssa1 ts yeast grown for 16 hours at 32\u00b0C in a media containing galactose, followed by changing to a media containing glucose to stop translation of p33/p92 pol and shifting the temperature to 23\u00b0C to activate Ssa1p ts .

Note that p33/ p92 pol are produced continously under this condition. The image shows the denaturing PAGE analysis of in vitro replicase products obtained using the membrane-enriched fraction carrying the co-purified repRNA. See further details in panel A.

Disrupted yeast cells were separated to soluble (cytosolic) and membrane fractions via differential centrifugation, followed by Western blotting to detect YFP-p33. Top panel: the samples were taken 6 hours after down-shifting to 23\u00b0C (6 hr). Bottom panel: PGK, a soluble yeast protein, and ALP membrane protein were used as internal controls in the Western-blots. See panel A for further details about the growing conditions for yeast samples. (C) Western blot analysis of localization of YFP",
