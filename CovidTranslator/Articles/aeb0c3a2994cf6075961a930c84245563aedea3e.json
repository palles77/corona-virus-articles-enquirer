Understanding the state of the disease and planning for future trajectories relies heavily on data on the spread and mortality. Yet official data coming from various countries are highly unreliable: symptoms similar to common cold in majority of cases and limited screening resources and delayed testing procedures may contribute to underestimation of the burden of disease. Anecdotal and more limited data are available, but few have systematically combined those with official statistics into a coherent view of the epidemic. This study is a modeling-in-real-time of the emerging outbreak for understanding the state of the disease. Our focus is on the case of the spread of disease in Iran, as one of the epicenters of the disease in the first months of 2020.",

Building on the generic SEIR (Susceptible, Exposed, Infected, and Recovered) framework we incorporate two behavioral and logistical considerations. First we capture the endogenous changes in contact rate (average contact per person) as more death are reported. As a result the reproduction number changes endogenously in the model. Second we differentiate reported and true cases by including simple formulations for how only a fraction of cases might be diagnosed, and how that fraction changes in response to epidemic's progression. In estimating the model we use both the official data as well as the discovered infected travelers and unofficial medical community estimates and triangulate these sources to build a more complete picture. Calibration is completed by forming a likelihood function for observing the actual time series data conditional on model parameters, and conducting a Markov Chain Monte Carlo simulations. The model is used to estimate current \"true\" cases of infection and death. We analyze the future trajectory of the disease under six conditions related to the seasonal effects and policy measures targeting social distancing.",

The challenge is multi-faceted, from understanding a quickly evolving situation to responding with limited information and under extreme pressures on the healthcare system. From public understanding to policy choices, much depends on the data about the epidemics spread and models that integrate such data into actionable policies (Kaplan, Craft et al. 2002 , Thompson, Tebbens et al. 2008 ). Yet the official data is highly uncertain, with large variations in quality depending on the country reporting it, and regularly offering lower bounds that have unknown error bounds compared to the reality on the ground. Other sources of data, often based on smaller samples, travel screening, and anecdotal evidence may offer relevant hints, but there are not easily generalized or combined with official data.

            "text": "Current information (as of mid-March 2020) point to the spread of COVID-19 starting from a food market in Wuhan China in mid-November 2019. The epidemic was not officially detected until the early 2020, and spread rapidly, mostly in China, for January and February of 2020. In response significant public health resources were mobilized in China, entire cities and regions were put under quarantine, and economic activity was reduced to a fraction. By mid-February the speed of contagion was slowing down in China, offering hope to many that the epidemic would be contained before becoming a global pandemic. Since then, however, rapid rise of detected cases in many other countries have dimmed the hopes for containing the contagion at origins. The situation may also be much worse than official statistics portray. For example, in late February, the United States had only a handful of endogenous cases, i.e. identified as not being imported from China. Yet genetic sequencing of the virus among one of those cases tied it back to a traveler from China who entered the country six weeks before and was thought to have not infected anybody (Fink and Baker 2020) . This implies that the epidemic might have been spreading in the U.S. for six weeks without being detected. Cases of death from COVID-19 might have also been popping up, but attributed to flu instead. The situation may be worse elsewhere. Among countries in south and east Asia with significant economic and travel ties to China, several, including India, Pakistan, Indonesia, Malaysia, Vietnam, Myanmar, Bangladesh, and Philippines have reported limited cases (as of early March) despite having a total population of over two billion. That seems unlikely when many smaller countries or those with further ties from China already show sustained epidemics, unless temperature plays an important role in infectivity, a possibility that requires further investigation (Wang, Jiang et al. 2020) . Thus official statistics are not a reliable gauge for understanding the actual extent of the epidemic.",

Any under-estimation is worrisome, but early in the exponential growth phase of an epidemic such errors could be extremely costly. The risk of under-estimation is partly driven by the characteristics of the COVID-19 such as a potentially large population of unrecognized patients with mild symptoms (at least 80% of the cases have symptoms not very different from common cold or flu) (Novel Coronavirus Pneumonia Emergency Response Epidemiology 2020). Some heuristics are used to correct for such biases. For example the ratio of deaths to those recovered at the beginning of March was 6.3% (Worldmeters 2020), yet most reports put the death rate at lower rates (Fauci, Lane et al. 2020, Wu and McGoogan 2020) , implying that some 70% of cases go undetected. A formal study puts that number at 86% for the early stage of the epidemic in China (Li, Pei et al. 2020 ). Yet, the country-specific biases in measurement and reporting may exceed those due to the nature of the disease. To illustrate, in the next section we provide a quick survey of various clues related to the magnitude of epidemic in Iran, which we then build on in our analysis.",

First, is the number of cases identified among travelers arriving in other countries from Iran. Screening of passengers from high-risk countries in airports is more reliable than most countrylevel screening statistics. One study in pre-print estimated 18,300 total cases of infected individuals in Iran by February 25 (Tuite, Bogoch et al. 2020 ). The method relied on estimation of cases in the whole country based on three diagnosed cases of infection upon individuals' arrival from Iran in various international airports and the likelihood of such an incident given approximately 7,500 daily outbound passengers from Iran during those early days (Fraser, Donnelly et al. 2009 ). There is much uncertainty associated with these estimates, a wide 95% confidence interval of 3,770 -53,470, partly because the method assumes many cases of infected travelers have gone undetected. Nevertheless the range was orders of magnitude larger than official statistics at the time. Later reports on the number of infected travelers from Iran rose rapidly, to 97 cases by February 28 (RadioFarda 2020). An article in The Atlantic, offered a series of back-of-the-envelope calculations which included several simplifying assumptions, estimating 2 million accumulated cases of infected individuals by March 9 th (Wood 2020) .",

We start with the traditional SEIR (for Susceptible, Exposed, Infectious, and Recovered stocks representing population groups) model and incorporate feedbacks regulating endogenous changes in contact rate, screening, diagnosis, and reporting in response to risk perception and other relevant factors. Thus not only reported statistics, but also the effective reproduction number, Re, are endogenously generated and can change as people respond to the epidemic. The model is very simple on other fronts: it assumes perfect mixing for the whole population of Iran and includes no disaggregation of population into different groups, nor any travel patterns across population groups. The focus being on a single country, the only link with the pandemic is when the cases were first seeded in Iran (supposedly from China). We use this model, along with various strands of data reported above, to weave together an estimate of disease trajectory so far, and offer projections for expected future trajectory. Given the rapid development of this model and various uncertainties not included in the analysis, the results should be seen as an assessment to enhance the overall picture of the epidemic, but not as reliable point estimates. With these limitations in mind, we estimate over 916,000 (90% CI: 508K, 1.5M) cumulative cases of the disease in Iran as of March 20th, with over 15,485 (90% CI: 8.4K, 25.8K) deaths. We thus estimate that only 2.1% of cases and 9.2% of deaths are officially attributed to COVID-19, with the rest going undetected. The confidence intervals around our estimations are relatively wide due to data limitations and our conservative assumptions in estimating those intervals. Nevertheless these results point to extreme gaps between official data and actual trajectory of disease, which may lead to slow response and under-appreciation of risks of the diseases in the coming months.",

First, we formulate contact rate to be endogenously changing in response to perceived risk of infection (a function of death statistics). The impact of perceived risk on contact rate captures not only the endogenous changes in social interactions, gatherings, self-isolation of suspected cases, and hygiene, but also government mandated closure of events, schools, and businesses to name a few. For example in Iran schools and sport and cultural events were closed down after the seriousness of the epidemic was recognized in late February. Moreover people started to reduce their discretionary interactions in public spaces, cut down on social and family gatherings, and followed hand washing and mask wearing recommendations more closely. We assume public risk perception depends on the number of recent reported cases of death. This balancing feedback (loop B) can bring down contact rate, potentially enough to slow down the epidemic, and captures in a simple formulation how a few other countries, namely China and South Korea, have brought down their case counts after the initial exponential growth. Second, we explicitly model the endogenous changes in screening and reporting of cases over time. Here, the increased understanding of risks leads to mobilization of screening resources that further expand the case detection and official statistics in a reinforcing process (loop R2). Nevertheless even with good screening many mild cases will go undiagnosed and not counted in official statistics. .

Eleven uncertain parameters remain that are estimated using the above data. Five of the parameters are used to specify how official measurement and reporting relates to \"true\" values of infection and death, three parameters estimate public reaction to the reports, and two parameters are for mortality rate among two different groups of patients.

We then conduct a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulation to estimate the joint posterior distribution of the model parameters subject to observed data. We define a likelihood function for change over time (net-flow) of official reports on death, recovered and infection assuming they are count events drawn from model-predicted rates (Poisson distribution). We use a similar Poisson distribution assumption for number of infected passengers and unofficial reports of death as well, since they both fit well into a count measure framework. The MCMC method searches over the feasible ranges for the uncertain parameters and accepts various combinations of parameters that are consistent with the observed data. Similar methods are used frequently in estimating dynamic models of epidemics. For example Wu and colleagues used a similar likelihood based MCMC method for estimating the basic parameters of the COVID-19 epidemic and its potential for spread beyond China (Li, Pei et al. 2020 , Wu, Leung et al. 2020 . FOur prior experience with the use of MCMC methods in nonlinear dynamic models highlights the risk that model mis-specifications may lead to confidence intervals that are too tight. We therefore downscale the likelihood function to expand the confidence intervals (details in the online appendix) to err on the side of caution in assessing uncertainties and structural nuances not explicitly modeled.",

This estimate is consistent with, and slightly higher than, the 2.3% reported by Wu and McGoogan (2020) based on tracing confirmed cases in China. If correct, the magnitude of epidemic in Iran would be much larger than that in China so far, and limits to healthcare services may explain the increased death rate. This finding is reinforced by the limited coverage of testing in Iran that is indicated in our estimation. Many cases go unconfirmed, and at its maximum, formal testing is covering only 2.5 (0.9)% of infections and 26 (17)% of deaths. These estimates are consistent with qualitative media reports from Iran on very limited availability of testing, the doctors' need for getting authorization before conducting tests, and the multi-day delays in receiving test results that render them ineffective in the clinical decision making process. We estimate that hospital sources of news organizations who have offered alternative versions of actual death statistics in Iran have had a much wider coverage of true death statistics (42 (15)% of true values). Their count offers a lower bound for true deaths, is also close to our lower confidence bound, and suggests that the true number of cumulative cases, even with a case fatality rate as high as 3.7%, would not be lower than 380,000. Nevertheless, we estimate that even those medical community reports offer coverage significantly below 100%, consistent with the less-than-perfect coverage of hospital reports by media sources, and anecdotal evidence that hospital system has been overwhelmed in most hot spots of the disease and many patients have died at home and been buried with no testing or proper association of cause of death to COVID-19.",

We assess our projections' sensitivity to these structural assumptions by re-estimating the model for different values of each parameter. In this analysis we find a new set of best-fitting parameters given each different assumption on disease parameters. In Table 1 results are summarized as percentage changes in key projections (cumulative infections and cumulative death until March 20 th , 2020) compared to baseline bestfitting parameters. Results suggest these structural parameters are important in identifying the true magnitude of the epidemic. Specifically, a smaller fractional infectivity during asymptomatic period (\u03b8), a longer asymptomatic period (\u03c4), or a shorter duration of illness all significantly increase the projections for total cases and deaths. Reductions in the estimates are less significant when parameters move in the opposite direction, though a very high level of \u03b8 would bring down the .

Specifically, our scenarios about seasonality include no effect (status quo), moderate effect (infectivity of the virus decreases linearly from April 1 st and halves by June 1 st , then stays the same for the rest of the simulation), and very strong mitigating effect (infectivity of the virus decreases from April 1 st to a quarter of its base value by June 1 st , then stays the same for the rest of the simulation). For policy, our focus is on contact rate, and we include two conditions of status quo and aggressive efforts to decrease contact rate by half what it would be otherwise. These six conditions provide intuitions for a potentially wide range of cases. Both intervention and weather impacts are assumed to include rather strong options, which is to offer a feel for the range of possibilities, but not necessarily be representative of most likely scenarios. Moreover, we also note that the wide cone of uncertainty in the baseline simulations will continue and expand in future projections.",

If our best case scenario on the reduction of contacts and benefits of seasonality for containment hold, the number of infected cases will peak soon at approximately 494,000 (90% CI: 274K-813K), and will go down later on. This optimistic scenario will still lead to over a million infections and some 58,000 deaths (90% CI: 32K-97K) by the end of June. The less aggressive scenarios point to continued spread of the epidemic. A reduction in contagion is realized only when reproduction number remains below one as a result of natural contact reduction in response to recent deaths, government interventions that reduce contacts, and seasonality. Among these three, the first (behavioral response) is endogenous to recent death rate. When death rate comes under control (due to the combination of all those factors), our model assumes the contract rate rebounds, weakening the first channel. Economic pressures, normalization of death, and behavioral modeling after the more risk seeking (or those already recovered and thus presumably immune) could all weaken the behavioral response when the perceived risks have faded. The increased contact would then, with a delay, bring up the death rate close to levels sustaining a reproduction number around or slightly above one. This creates a strong attractor in the dynamics where in steady state contact rate is high enough to sustain the contagion but not so high to lead to the rapid infection of all the population. Therefore it is only with strong weather and/or government interventions that reduced reproduction number brings the epidemic under control. This dynamic offers a cautionary tale against declaring victory early in the fight against the epidemic. However the actual magnitude of such rebound effect is not known in this setting and our data offers no guidance on the relevant parameters. Therefore these results are only qualitatively suggestive but not quantitatively reliable.",

The availability of testing infrastructure has been a major bottleneck for detecting cases in Iran.

Not only mild cases are missed, but also many critical patients have been unable to access the care they need due to hospital congestion. The fact that majority of cases have mild symptoms similar to flu (Wu and McGoogan 2020) adds to the risk of under-counting even if the testing capacity was ample. In fact many mild or moderately sick patients may have preferred to stay home than risk being infected upon visiting a congested hospital, further reducing demand for testing.",

Therefore we have made several simplifying assumptions that readers should be aware of in interpreting our results. First, consistent with prior findings (Rahmandad and Sterman 2008) we have focused on capturing behavioral feedbacks in contacts and testing and have adopted a formal estimation process, but have done so at the cost of abstracting away from much detail complexity and heterogeneity in populations and risks. Second, we have left out explicit treatment of healthcare resources and their impact on the burden of disease. Third the model is scoped only around Iran --we ignore potential effects of global spread of the disease on Iran, including the risk of reintroduction of cases in future. Forth, we assumed that the recovered population are immune during our simulation time period of six months. Fifth, we ignore mutations in the virus which may change its contagiousness and case fatality rate. Despite these limits we hope the paper offers a more accurate assessment of the risks and scope of the epidemic for Iran and beyond. We also hope other researchers build on this work using the publicly available data, models, and replication instructions provided in the online appendix.",
