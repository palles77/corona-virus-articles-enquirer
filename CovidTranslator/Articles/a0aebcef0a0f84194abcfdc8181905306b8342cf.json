During that time, there has been a paradigm shift, such that veterinary infection control is a growing discipline that is becoming part of the customary way in which veterinarians practice medicine. This shift is seen primarily in large academic teaching hospitals associated with specific veterinary schools and in specialty clinics dedicated to advanced diagnostics and care for animals. However, the nature of medicine and mission of veterinary hospitals",

Environmental contamination with pathogens of concern is widespread in veterinary hospitals and should be an important target of proactive measures to prevent (limit) HAI. For environmental cleaning and disinfection (C/D) to be effective, all stakeholders should be educated as to the need for appropriate C/D and the participation of all (at any level) should be encouraged to accomplish this goal. Veterinary practices should seriously consider identifying personnel responsible for establishing infection control practices, establishing monitoring/audit procedures, and determining whether their practice situation warrants proactive environmental surveillance. More research is required to identify the precise relationship between environmental contamination and HAI and to establish control and surveillance/monitoring procedures of direct relevance to veterinary medicine. colonized/infected with a hospital pathogen has an increased likelihood of being colonized/infected themselves, and improvements in terminal cleaning and disinfection (C/D) lead to decreased rates of infection. [7] [8] [9] The organisms for which data implicating a role for environmental contamination are strongest include norovirus, Clostridium difficile, VRE, Acinetobacter spp, MRSA, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. 7, 9 It should be obvious that the list of organisms with the strongest links to environmental contamination is essentially the same as that for pathogens most closely related to HAI.",

            "text": "Many of the pathogens associated with HAI in humans are found in VTHs and can cause infections in animals. However, just as data on veterinary HAI are not readily available, the relationship of environmental contamination with most of these pathogens to HAI is not well defined. Nevertheless, as with human medicine, the link between HAIs and the environment of veterinary clinics is becoming more clear. There are numerous descriptions of environmental contamination associated with HAI in large animal hospitals, [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] and at the University of Pennsylvania's George D. Widener Hospital for Large Animals, where we conduct routine environmental surveillance for Salmonella, we have many examples directly correlating infection in animals (both community associated and HAI) with environmental contamination (Dr H. Aceto, unpublished observations, 2004 ). In addition, recently documented MRSA events in veterinary settings showed that environmental contamination ranged from 1% to 12%, [24] [25] [26] [27] and there are reports of contamination of the environment and equipment in small animal hospitals with enterococci many of which were multidrug resistant (MDR). 28, 29 One of these studies 28 investigated the hypothesis that cage doors, stethoscopes, thermometers, and mouth gags used in participating hospitals would have bacterial contamination that could contribute to HAI. This investigation was Environmental Cleaning and Disinfection accomplished by determining the prevalence of surface contamination with enterococci at 10 different veterinary hospitals. Because the locations within the hospitals that were sampled had direct patient contact, it is perhaps not surprising that they all yielded enterococci at 1 or more hospitals. To compare cleaning protocols with bacterial contamination, a veterinarian at each hospital was asked to complete a questionnaire. Results showed that only half of the hospitals had written standard operating procedures for hospital cleaning, and the wide variety of disinfectants used precluded examination of any relationship between cleaning and contamination. Moreover, 5 of 10 veterinarians surveyed reported almost never or never cleaning their stethoscopes, and there were also deficiencies in the cleaning of cage doors, thermometers, and mouth gags at some hospitals.",

This strategy can be as simple as ensuring that wood surfaces are properly sealed and painted or more complex by eliminating furniture and finishes that are not easily disinfected or, in the worst case, those that are essentially not cleanable by standard C/D methods. Furniture and finishes may include carpeting, upholstery, and unfinished or damaged wood surfaces. In a veterinary hospital, in which fecal material and respiratory or other secretions are abundant, frequently defy containment, are more likely to harbor pathogens, and may represent an HAI risk, cleanliness of treatment/procedures spaces, animal housing, and operating rooms is crucial. This necessity is particularly true in critical care and isolation units, where exacting evaluation of all surfaces, construction materials, and equipment is essential to maximize cleanability, environmental safety, and efficient operation of the area. Such considerations should influence the choice of materials and finishes for all kinds of surfaces (eg, floors, walls, benches and work surfaces, doors and frames); solid, nonporous surface materials that are highly durable and with as few Traverse & Aceto seams as possible are best. For example, in personnel areas, such as nursing stations, seamless, highly cleanable and exceptionally durable poured epoxy floors, although more expensive, are preferable to materials such as vinyl tile. Wherever seams are present, regular maintenance to ensure their integrity or that of other interfaces between surfaces is essential. Block walls should be sealed, with urethane-based paints, for example. Although metal doors and frames are nonporous and may be the ideal, some composites are also suitable. Any wood surfaces must be properly sealed and painted. For all materials, regular inspection and maintenance are a must. To facilitate cleaning, there should be adequate provision of drains. Drains should be connected to the sanitary system, and, to limit future disruption for the conduct of work to replace corroded drains, use of stainless steel drain hubs should be considered to prolong the life of the drain in the face of water, cleaners, disinfectants, and animal urine. The choice of heating and ventilation systems and the location of heaters and air vents are all critical components in facility design. Although this factor may be most obvious for the control of pathogens classically considered to be transmitted via the airborne route, it may be less obvious that organisms normally thought of as fecal-oral can be greatly impacted by heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems. Impacts can be both in terms of contaminating the system and in terms of the system facilitating pathogen spread via, for example, forced hot air systems that circulate contaminated particulates widely throughout a given space. It is imperative that engineers with knowledge about airborne transmission be involved in the design of HVAC systems for veterinary facilities, particularly isolation units.",

The steps in a typical practical C/D procedure of broad environmental application are shown in more detail in Box 2, with an emphasis on critical concepts such as dilution rates and contact times for disinfectants. The steps provided are suitable for high-level C/D but are readily adaptable to more low-level C/D needs. Some, but not all, disinfectants have good cleaning in addition to disinfecting properties, so the basic number of steps can be reduced in noncritical areas (to determine whether a particular disinfectant product has adequate cleaning properties inspect the manufacturer's label). However, where areas are grossly dirty, a separate detergent step is always required. In addition, some disinfectants require rinsing, because of the potential for toxicity or surface damage, but others may have residual activity, which might be negated by rinsing. The need for rinsing and claims for residual activity are also stated on the product label. Drying after C/D is always beneficial to pathogen control. Characteristics of each disinfectant product, including their compatibility with detergents and other chemicals, can be determined by careful inspection of the label, so it is important that individuals responsible for both choosing and using these products understand how to read the manufacturer's label. 36 More information on characteristics of disinfectants is covered in the section on choosing a disinfectant.",

The risk evaluation process helps guide the nature and stringency of the infection control procedures to be adopted. Because infection control measures are generally associated with some cost, consideration should also be given to how the risk/benefit ratio of these procedures is assessed (the latter might require evaluation over time). Disinfection protocols, for example, should be frequently reviewed and if necessary altered based on evidence gathered through patient and, potentially, environmental surveillance. In addition, there is ample evidence that, in addition to antimicrobial resistance, microorganisms can be resistant to disinfectants, antiseptics, and sterilants, either constitutively, through acquired means, or by formation of biofilms. 44 Keeping abreast of developments in antimicrobial resistance helps in determining the need for change.",

Veterinary hospitals should consider this approach and, as mentioned earlier, establish an infection control individual/group, which in the context of C/D ideally includes individuals responsible for C/D of the facilities, clinical representatives, and other relevant stakeholders. In addition to instituting C/D protocols, this group should be prepared to educate other staff to ensure buy-in at all levels and promote compliance. Although not widely adopted in veterinary medicine, auditing of C/D is a means of checking practice against a standard or desired outcome and it has been used to improve health service in human medicine. 54, 56 The infection control team should be encouraged to develop and conduct audits of C/D. The NHS materials include some sample cleaning standards and audit score sheets that are eminently adaptable to veterinary use. Cleaning standards for a few selected items are shown in Table 1 . Elements for consideration of cleaning standards can be divided into 3 overlapping major groups: environment, direct contact, and patient equipment. In terms of the environment, there are several subgroups: floors; fixed assets; electrical appliances; toilets, sinks, and other washing facilities; and furnishings and fixtures; examples of which are indicated in Table 1 . Issues to be considered when designing and implementing an audit process include frequency, personnel, methodology, sampling, scoring, and action. For human hospitals, personnel involvement and scoring systems can be complex. However, for most veterinary applications, audits could be conducted by an individual or, better yet, a small group, which comprises medical personnel and individuals responsible for C/D. Whoever conducts the audit should be able to competently judge what is acceptable in terms of cleanliness and infection prevention and control. Once the elements and standards criteria to be included in the audit have been identified, the scoring system could be as simple as acceptable (score 1) or unacceptable (score 0) for each element in a given space of a functional area (see later discussion), leading to an overall score for that area. Based on the number of elements scored, the area score can be converted into a percent Traverse & Aceto acceptable. As a guideline, the NHS system uses the following percentages as targets for the 4 functional risk areas described later: very high, 98%; high, 95%; significant, 85%; low, 75%; areas with scores lower than this are considered for predetermined remedial action. Ideally, regular audits should form part of the quality assurance program of your clinic. Issues raised should be followed up according to their magnitude and location. Lead times should be identified for remediation. For example, a problem in the surgical area needs to be resolved immediately, whereas one in a storeroom for noncritical items may require checking within some reasonable time, such as during the next scheduled audit. Although it is important that deficiencies be identified and corrected, efforts should be made to avoid the perception that audits will be punitive in nature. Functional areas for evaluation can be categorized as follows:",

There are also newer technologies, such as no-touch methods of surface disinfection. 7, 48, 49 These methods include ultraviolet (UV) light and hydrogen peroxide dry-mist or vapor (HPV) fogging procedures. 49 Both can be used for whole room decontamination and are more suited to occasional use either in response to a specific problem or as part of a program of thorough disinfection of specific spaces scheduled to occur at predetermined intervals. HPV is capable of killing a wide range of pathogens, including Cryptosporidium and w6 logs spores, whereas UV is reliably biocidal at 3 to 4 logs against vegetative bacteria. No animals or people can be present during the decontamination process. The use parameters for both are sensitive and require specialized equipment, representing a considerable capital investment, but unlike HPV, UV systems need no additional consumable products. Room decontamination is rapid with UV (w15 minutes) compared with 3 to 5 hours for HPV. In addition, for HPV, the HVAC system must be disabled and the rooms sealed to prevent unwanted dilution of the vapor, which requires considerable staff time. HPV is uniformly distributed throughout the room via an automated dispersal system and is particularly useful for disinfecting temperature-sensitive or complex equipment and furniture. It has been speculated that over time HPV might cause damage to sensitive electronics as a result of microcondensation, but this should not be an issue with the dry-mist form. HPV leaves no toxic residues (aeration units convert HPV into oxygen and water), and it requires no rinsing. Similarly, UV systems generate no residues and are not associated with health and safety concerns, but the environmental penetration of these systems is probably less than HPV. Neither procedure removes dust or stains, so the area must be clean before decontamination. Although these systems have been used widely in human medicine, there are no data to show whether or not the incidence of HAI decreases. 49 Other no-touch methods increasingly being used include self-disinfecting surfaces impregnated with heavy metals (eg, copper and silver) or germicides (eg, the bisphenolic compound triclosan). At our large animal hospital, we have successfully used silver-impregnated sticky mats (Dycem, Warwick, RI) in place of footbaths in main entry areas to our high-risk isolation and colic facilities as well as the entry way to the necropsy facility. Although we have not encountered specific problems with these mats, which are sampled weekly for the presence of Salmonella, it is well known that bacteria (particularly gram-negative organisms, including Escherichia coli) can be resistant to heavy metals by both intrinsic and, in some cases, acquired mechanisms. Five mechanisms of intrinsic resistance have been described that allow bacteria to survive in the presence of inhibitory or microbicidal concentrations of toxic metals 44 Bacterial resistance to biocides such as triclosan can be intrinsic or acquired by mutation or plasmid or transposon acquisition and can be via several mechanisms: exclusion; efflux mechanisms; mutation to decrease target sensitivity; or target overproduction. 44 The likelihood of resistance development should always be considered when choosing products, particularly because some items, such as the mats mentioned earlier, are expensive. Antimicrobial surface coatings based on nanoparticles are under development for both biomedical devices and environmental surfaces 57, 58 and may have the advantage over microbicidal coatings based on metals or agents, such as triclosan, because they have prolonged activity, and some seem unlikely to be associated with the development of microbial resistance. 57 Steam disinfection systems offer an alternative to liquid chemical disinfectants and can kill a diverse group of pathogenic organisms in seconds, but they are not suitable for all surfaces and introduce additional safety considerations. Characteristics of the ideal disinfectant are shown in Box 4. The possibility of achieving all of these qualities for all scenarios is unrealistic. Therefore, individuals Environmental Cleaning and Disinfection responsible for developing C/D protocols must learn to discretionarily pick and choose disinfectants based on the properties of the disinfectant, the perceived challenges of the task, and desired results of the disinfection procedure. For example, the disinfectant that might be chosen for a footbath or foot mat is likely different from the agent picked for general purpose C/D, because the footbath must be quick kill and preferably stable in the face of organic debris. Quick kill and lack of surface damage tend to be mutually exclusive characteristics. Even in the case of routine surface disinfection, procedures should not make for slippery floor surfaces, cause films to build up over time, or damage surfaces (film build-up and surface damage preclude effective cleaning). Although footbaths are not used as commonly in small animal compared with large animal clinics, they may be effective in preventing the transmission of infectious agents. [59] [60] [61] [62] [63] While opinions about the degree of efficacy vary, in the absence of other control methods, their use should certainly be considered in isolation areas, particularly if it is short-term, without attendant management problems.",

Even in the absence of active surveillance of the environment, monitoring of the clinical status of patients can be a helpful indicator of when both patients and the environment require closer scrutiny. 12 It should be the responsibility of designated infection control personnel to adjust the intensity or focus of surveillance (active or passive), based on developments in the hospital, the picture of disease prevalence in the referral area, literature, and so forth. In concert with these considerations, individual hospitals need to determine characteristics of their case population (size and type, critical care vs elective, both of which have been associated with increased risk), 12 level of risk aversion, cost-benefit analysis, and so forth, either before initiating a surveillance program or, just as importantly, evaluating an ongoing infection control program.

Establishment of a useful, active environmental sampling strategy might require collection of environmental and HAI baseline data, without which it is often not possible to assess the likelihood that particular infections are HAI, determine whether there has been an increase in such infections, or evaluate the efficacy of any interventions. However, in deciding whether or not to pursue a targeted surveillance program, even with good baseline data, it can be difficult to make such assessments on every occasion.",

Some of the potential actions associated with surveillance may be: Establishment of baseline rates of infection or contamination Provision of proof needed to convince practitioners to adopt best practices Identification and control of outbreaks Evaluation of the success of the infection control program Drive potential changes to current policy and procedure For the desired effect to be positively achieved, the collected information must be disseminated to individuals who can interpret and effect the desired change. In the case of HAIs and outbreak scenarios, surveillance can even be the foundation for a facility organizing and instituting or modifying an infection control program. If a facility is experiencing a suspected outbreak or is interested in introducing an infection control program, it is important for individuals to understand both the object of surveillance activities and various surveillances types (Box 6). However, in general, available reports suggest that most veterinary hospitals, including academic institutions, do not practice methodical collection and analysis of either patient or environmental data. 12 If a decision is taken to initiate active surveillance for a particular organism(s), it might be useful to consider factors that went into the choice of Salmonella as the general biosensor most commonly used in large animal hospitals. Salmonella is among the most important cause of HAIs in large animal hospitals, it is a significant zoonotic threat, and it has been associated with numerous outbreaks at VTHs. In addition, the following characteristics favor Salmonella as an effective biosensor:",

Although evidence-based choices for large animal hospitals are straightforward, the options for small animal clinics are less clear. In this context, although still useful in evaluating the effectiveness of C/D, the value of measuring organisms like generic E coli to assess HAI and overall effectiveness of infection control programs is increasingly questioned. Potential targets include MDR pathogens of concern, microorganisms causing the most significant problem in your facility, or evidence from multi-institutional surveys, but further research is necessary to provide veterinarians with better guidance. For these same reasons, some advocate using non-culture-based techniques, such as fluorescent tagging, because they are not tied to specific pathogens. 42 If specific pathogens are identified as targets, in addition to classic epidemiologic measures for the sensitivity, specificity, and predictive values of detection methods, another critical characteristic of testing that should be considered is speed to return of results. In terms of the environment, if it takes days to get results, there could be wide dissemination to patients and other parts of the hospital before corrective measures are initiated. These considerations explain the move away from traditional culture methods to more rapid techniques such as polymerase chain reaction, which often offer enhanced sensitivity and specificity, as well as greater speed.",

The standard of care at every veterinary hospital should therefore include a high standard of hygiene, awareness of the dangers of transfer of infectious agents between both animals and people, and procedures to reduce infection risk wherever possible. It is becoming increasingly clear that the environment of health care facilities is subject to contamination with pathogens and plays a role in at least some HAIs. Consequently, environmental management, with or without active surveillance, should be a component of risk reduction designed to limit HAIs. Effective C/D procedures are critical in preventing transmission of infectious agents between patients or from contaminated environments. Development of well-understood protocols and schedules for C/D, waste disposal, and environmental maintenance to ensure that surfaces Environmental Cleaning and Disinfection remain sealed and cleanable is important. Education of veterinarians and all staff as to the need for thoroughness and vigilance when it comes to C/D is critical to successful mitigation of HAI risks.",

Dilution rates and recommended contact times vary by product and are critical to efficacy; be sure to read the product label carefully and follow manufacturer's instructions.
