            "text": "The primary objective of this randomized controlled trial was to determine whether anti-IL-10 egg yolk antibodies fed upon arrival to a calf ranch would lower the prevalence of Cryptosporidium parvum shedding in naturally challenged preweaned dairy calves. The secondary objectives included measuring the effect of anti-IL-10 antibodies on calf health, performance, and shedding of less common diarrheal pathogens. A total of 133 calves, enrolled at 24 to 72 h of age, received a daily dose of 0.96 g of egg yolk powder with anti-IL-10 antibodies (MAB, n = 71) or without anti-IL-10 antibodies (MEP, n = 62) split between 2 feedings for the first 11 d on feed at a calf ranch. Daily health evaluations were completed for 15 d after arrival and on d 56. Digital weights were collected at enrollment and d 56, and hipometer weights were collected at enrollment and d 7 and 56. Packed cell volume and serum total protein concentration were measured at enrollment and on d 7 and 14. Fecal pH was measured at enrollment and on d 5 and 14, and fecal pathogen (C. parvum, coronavirus, rotavirus, and Salmonella spp.) shedding was assessed at d 5 and 14. Continuous outcomes were compared between groups using a Student's t-test or Wilcoxon rank sum test. Fecal pathogen shedding at d 14, respiratory disease at d 56, and antibiotic usage were compared using relative risk (RR) and chi-squared test. Fecal pH (median and interquartile range) on d 14 was 6.65 (6.39-6.99) and 6.52 (5.97-6.81) for MAB and MEP, respectively. On d 56, the risk of respiratory disease was lower for MAB compared with MEP (RR = 0.40; confidence interval = 0.16-0.99). The risk for antibiotic treatment was lower for MAB-compared with MEP-treated calves (RR = 0.38; confidence interval = 0.17-0.88). The risk of shedding rotavirus was higher in MAB (RR = 1.38; confidence interval = 1.10-1.81) calves. After multivariable analyses, hipometer weights (least squares means \u00b1 standard error) were 1.7 \u00b1 0.8 kg greater on d 56 in MAB compared with MEP; however, ADG was 0.04 \u00b1 0.02 kg/d lower in MAB calves. Total health score, diarrhea days, average respiratory score, packed cell volume, and serum total protein were not affected by feeding anti-IL-10 egg antibodies. In summary, feeding anti-IL-10 antibodies was associated with increased fecal pH, reduced risk of respiratory disease later in the preweaning period, and decreased antibiotic usage despite higher rotavirus infection. These findings might be associated with improved mucosal immunity, enhanced host defenses, or reduced susceptibility and warrant further investigation.",

            "text": "Neonatal calf diarrhea (NCD) and bovine respiratory disease (BRD) are the most common causes of morbidity and mortality in preweaned dairy calves (Windeyer et al., 2014; Cramer and Stanton, 2015) . Although NCD and BRD may be independent events affecting calves before weaning, the risk of BRD is increased in calves that have had other disease problems such as NCD in the first 2-wk of life (Windeyer et al., 2014) . Effective prevention, detection, and treatment are paramount for controlling NCD and, therefore, BRD, but the development of farm protocols is challenging because of the mixed array of causative organisms (viral, bacterial, or parasitic) , the prevalence of mixed infections, and the potential role of nutrition. Cryptosporidium parvum, rotavirus, coronavirus, and Salmonella spp. are important enteropathogens of 5-to 14-d-old calves (McGuirk, 2008) . Treatment is challenging because approved antimicrobial drugs have questionable efficacy (Smith, 2015) and antibiotic use may increase emergence of resistant bacteria (Berge et al., 2006) . With few effective treatment and prevention options, passive transfer of the maternal antibody remains a mainstay in managing NCD. However, recent studies have provided evidence for the effectiveness of egg yolk-derived antibody protection against diarrhea (Yokoyama et al., 1998; Mine and Kovacs-Nolan, 2002; Vega et al., 2011; Diraviyam et al., 2014) .",

Although it is possible that this finding is spurious, others have shown an increased risk of BRD later in the preweaning period in calves that have had earlier disease problems such as NCD in the first 2 wk of life (Windeyer et al., 2014) . It is possible that stabilizing fecal pH in very young calves, as demonstrated in the current study, or other unmeasured changes in the gastrointestinal function, had some effect on the development of clinical respiratory disease later in the preweaning period. The mechanism of improved respiratory health seen after improving gastrointestinal health is unknown; however, literature suggests pulmonary-intestinal cross-talk given the similar epithelial surfaces and mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (Keely et al., 2012) . Similar shared immune components and overlapping pathological changes of inflammation have been noted in human respiratory and intestinal mucosal disease (Keely et al., 2012; McGhee and Fujihashi, 2012) . Although antibiotic administration was primarily for treatment of respiratory disease, farm personnel responsible for treatment decisions were blind to treatment group and where not made aware of daily health scores. Therefore, bias at the level of farm personnel should not be driving these observed differences.",

            "text": "). Fecal pH on d 5 was not affected by treatment [MAB: 5.31, interquartile range (IQR) = 5.09-5.87; MEP: 5.29, IQR = 5.03-5.50; P = 0.23]. Fecal pH increased to a greater extent between d 0 and 14 in treated compared with control calves (P = 0.0001, Figure 2). Overall, 26/71 (37%) of MAB calves and 24/62 (39%) of MEP calves were diagnosed with clinical respiratory disease during the study period (P = 0.80). Average daily respiratory score for the first 14 d did not differ between groups [MEP calves: 1.47 (IQR = 1.1-1.67) vs. MAB calves: 1.33 (IQR = 1.07-1.73)]. However, compared with MEP, fewer MAB calves were diagnosed with respiratory disease on d 56 (MAB: 6/71, 8.5%; MEP: 13/62, 21.0%; P = 0.04) and treated with antibiotics (MAB: 7/71, 9.9%; MEP: 16/62, 25.8%; P = 0.03) during the preweaned period compared with MEP calves (Figure 3). More specifically, the risk of respiratory disease at d 56 was lower in MAB calves compared with MEP calves [relative risk (RR) = 0.40, CI = 0.16-0.99]. The risk of antibiotic treatment was lower in the MAB group compared with the MEP group (RR = 0.38, CI = 0.17-0.88; P = 0.01). Mean (\u00b1SD) antibiotic cost per calf for the MEP and MAB groups were $3.78 \u00b1 7.93 and $1.42 \u00b1 4.55, respectively (P = 0.04). The costs of antibiotic treatments were systematically higher in the MEP group compared with the MAB group [MEP: median $0 (IQR = 0-2.93) vs. MAB: median $0 (IQR = 0 -0); P = 0.02]. The median cumulative total health score was numerically lower in calves in the MAB group (49, IQR = 42-61) versus the MEP group (52, IQR = 37-63; P = 0.94). A total of 63/71 (89%) of MAB calves and 56/62 (90%) of MEP calves developed diarrhea (P = 0.77). No difference was seen in the number of diarrhea days during the first 14 d; both groups had a median of 3 d of diarrhea (MAB IQR = 2-5; MEP IQR = 2-4; P = 0.98). A total of 30 calves had abnormal navel scores detected in at least one exam during the follow-up period; however, the proportion of abnormal navel scores was not different between groups [MAB: 13/71 (18%); MEP: 17/62 (27%); P = 0.21].",
