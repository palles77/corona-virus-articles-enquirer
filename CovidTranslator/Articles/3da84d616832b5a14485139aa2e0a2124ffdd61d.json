            "text": "(HCQ) are generic antiviral agents that have shown effectiveness against SARS virus, and in this time of pandemic, physicians are trying any plausible approach to therapy. 1 News reports have appeared recently about China starting trials with a variety of medications to treat coronavirus (COVID-19), including both of these agents. 2 In fact, at least 10 trials have started now in different countries. 3 The Chinese are giving typically up to a 10-day course of 500 mg CQ twice daily, or 400 mg HCQ four times daily and these extreme doses have raised concerns about retinal damage. CQ and HCQ are well known to ophthalmologists because of retinal toxicity after long-term usage for systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and other rheumatoid diseases. Retinopathy is infrequently seen before 10 or more years of usage at American Academy of Ophthalmology (AAO) recommended dosage of <5 mg/kg real weight. 4 However, the doses proposed to treat COVID-19 are 4-5 times higher, and it is important that our specialty be informed whether there is ocular risk from these short-term treatments. Do we need to be worry, and what if anything should ophthalmology be doing?",

Some rheumatologists had been giving 1200 mg/day for 6 weeks as a loading dose when starting HCQ for SLE, and no visual loss was reported although detailed ophthalmologic exams were not performed. 5, 6 Two trials on treatment of myeloma and solid tumors used 1200 mg/day for 4-8 weeks, and again no visual loss was reported. 7, 8 The only high-dose ophthalmologic study by Leung et al followed 7 patients at 3-month intervals for 7-25 months while using 1000 mg/day of HCQ for small-cell lung cancer. 9 By patient weight these doses were 3-5 times greater than the AAO recommendation.",

Short-term trials (under 2 weeks) will have negligible risk even with doses 5-6 times the usual 5 mg/kg/day maximum recommendation. Usage for a few months will still have very low risk with doses under 3-4 times the usual level. However, if physicians suggest using these drugs for a year or more, I would strongly advise staying within the AAO recommendation, and screening annually.",

In a time of pandemic with world-wide shortages of medical personnel, funds, hospital beds, equipment, screening tests, and proven therapy, it would be counterproductive (and raise inappropriate fears) to suggest the addition of labor-intensive and expensive eye exams that are of low yield. However, as new protocols arise these will have to evaluated relative to the risk of retinopathy that their particular doses and durations of use may pose.",
