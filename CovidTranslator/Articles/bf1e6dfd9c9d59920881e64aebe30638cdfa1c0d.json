Despite general preparedness requirements within the industry, hospitals typically are a weak link with respect to community disaster preparedness, particularly for those incidents involving contaminated patients. Significant systemic constraints make most hospitals reluctant partners in preparedness and generate ineffective response; this condition has been highlighted by the antiterrorism training and preparedness programs in the past few years. Results of numerous exercises and actual responses across the United States indicate a predictable list of pitfalls, most of them related to inherent system limitations that continue to hinder effective disaster operations in hospitals:",

            "text": "Recent events have focused attention on the ability of communities to respond to acts of terrorism. In addition to intentionally generated incidents, most communities have been struggling with preparedness against a range of natural and technological hazards. Public safety and emergency management personnel have developed and tested response plans, and considerable federal resources have been expended toward the same end-albeit with inconsistent results. With some exceptions, community preparedness efforts have faltered at a common, though not exclusive, point: hospitals. Those involved in preparedness and response recognize the quandary: hospitals are essential, irreplaceable resources for planning, response, and recovery associated with disasters, but they carry a unique set of constraints that makes effective participation in such efforts challenging at best. Barbera et al. [1] cogently discussed the constraints and challenges facing hospitals, along with public expectations. Hospitals as a whole face difficult financial times: approximately 30% of U.S. hospitals are operating at a financial loss, with many more teetering on the financial brink [2] . Hospitals face increasing operating costs coupled with decreasing reimbursement rates. Emergency departments (EDs) have become primary care intake points for much of the public [3], regardless of their insurance status. Staffing shortages are becoming the rule for most departments across a wide range of skill levels and specialties [4] ; loss of experienced staff exacerbates the problem. High staff turnover rates further burden the remaining staff and add overtime and incentive costs to already strained budgets [5] .",

As of January 2001, hospitals wishing to achieve or retain JCAHO accreditation had to have a comprehensive plan in place, covering the four traditional phases of emergency management (mitigation, preparedness, response, and recovery) [7] . A hazard vulnerability analysis, part of the new standards, not only determines both the most likely and the most catastrophic incidents, but also identifies the range of hazards for a given hospital. This all-hazard approach, like municipal emergency operations plans, allows preparedness and a measured, flexible response to a variety of potential incidents. Plans may contain annexes for specific hazards, but an all-hazard plan should obviate a separate plan for each hazard (an \"earthquake plan,\" a \"terrorism plan,\" etc.). Plans are supposed to be tested and updated by at least one tabletop or similar exercise and one full-scale exercise or actual activation per year. The standards also establish requirements for staff training and familiarization with the plan.",

The Defense Department's Domestic Preparedness Program (continued by the Justice Department) in the late 1990s provided basic training on medical management of casualties affected by chemical, biological, and radiological warfare agents. Curriculum and training were limited by design: it was largely military in origin, focused on the response phase, and did not contain much depth in hospital preparedness. The Metropolitan Medical Response System (MMRS) [8], initially overseen by the Department of Health and Human Services and now part of the Department of Homeland Security, was the first large-scale federal program to focus on improving the ability of healthcare systems to detect, identify, and manage incidents involving large numbers of potentially contaminated casualties. The goal of incorporating first responders (public safety agencies), public health agencies, hospitals, and emergency management and linking local, state, and federal agencies was an innovative global approach to a healthcare system that is commonly approached via its components. The challenges faced by MMRS participants and administrators in the program's initial incarnation were less a result of the philosophy than of the style and method of administration. The MMRS is now part of the multi-faceted Homeland Security Grant Program [8A], addressing key issues of medical surge capacity in the community.",

Even were there significant excess hospital beds, it would be difficult to staff and equip them. Realistically, solutions must involve alternative assessment and treatment centers rather than physically expanding hospitals-and most do (either via adapting existing alternate facilities or setting up temporary ones). Providing adequate staffing for these alternative centers is the greater challenge.",

The grants were supposed to assist states in achieving \"critical benchmarks for bioterrorism preparedness planning,\" promulgated by the Department of Health and Human Services. Three of the initial benchmarks were to designate a bioterrorism preparedness coordinator, establish a hospital preparedness planning committee to advise the state health department, and develop a plan for managing epidemics, regardless of origin [13] . States have some discretion on disbursement (provided that funds are directed toward fulfillment of primary grant goals), with many aiming for general hospital preparedness as a first step in bioterrorism preparedness. Subsequent and planned grants from HRSA have allowed expansion of preparedness funding from hospitals to health systems and encourage regional and statewide coordination. In combination with public health preparedness grants from the CDC and the MMRS component of the Homeland Security Grant Program, the HRSA National Bioterrorism Hospital Preparedness Program [13A] is addressing local, regional, and state aspects of health-system surge capacity and capability.",

This should come as little surprise, because similar complaints are expressed about everyday operations-that is, a system that does not work well under normal conditions should not be expected to do so under extreme stress. Few facilities devote planning or resources to external communications.

Hospital security is an important part of JCAHO's \"secure environment,\" protecting patients, staff, visitors, information, and the physical infrastructure [22, 23] . Some hospitals, particularly large ones in urban areas, employ sworn law enforcement officers, either on contract or as employees. Regardless of the type and powers of security staff, the trend of minimal staffing applies across the board, commonly resulting in inadequate coverage for most facilities. Recurrent securityrelated challenges have internal and external foci: lockdown and the role of local law enforcement. Lockdown is a common constituent of hospital emergency plans, but there is little consistency to its definition, even between facilities in the same community. In its ideal use, lockdown is an incident management tool that allows hospital staff to assert or regain control of a situation that appears or escalates with little warning. Lockdown is analogous to cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR): it is a short-term step intended for use early in the incident to buy time for more definitive measures. In securing all or part of the facility against additional entry, staff implementing lockdown can gain some breathing room while providing short-term protection to themselves and their patients. Also, as with CPR, lockdown can make the difference between success and failure in implementation of an emergency plan but is rarely effective on its own; a plan that ends with lockdown is doomed to fail.",

This can be due to contamination of the area, an unmanageable crush of incoming patients, perceived threat of violence, or loss of infrastructure. In many of these exercises, hospital staff recognized impending failure and requested assistance from law enforcement agencies for facility security and crowd control. With few exceptions these requests were not met (or were met too late), although it eventually became apparent to most participants that these needs were indeed urgent and the loss of hospitals disastrous. Although it is not an exaggeration to say that law enforcement was not an eager player in hospital security, this was not due to laxity on the part of police. As expressed in the first TOPOFF exercise after-action report [24] , law enforcement agencies were overrun with urgent requests for multiple types of assistance. As they were given little to no external guidance on how to rank request urgency, they found themselves with too many priorities.

Considerable sums have been spent on extensive training and equipment designed to decontaminate thousands of people at an incident scene and hundreds at a hospital. Common goals in cities participating in MMRS contracts were for hospitals to be able to decontaminate at least 100 ambulatory patients without relying on external assistance (i.e., a fire service hazmat team). Goals related to HRSA grants focus on 500 per million of population, but do not specify an interval. Both MMRS and HRSA goals represent significant expectations, and to date they have proved largely fanciful. Terrorism aside, all acute-care hospitals should be able to successfully manage a single contaminated patient without external resources [25] . A 2002 American Hospital Association survey [26] reported that a majority of hospitals had plans in place for managing chemical and biological attacks; this is a marked increase relative to surveys taken before 11 September 2001 [27] . This encouraging report notwithstanding, most hospital plans likely fall into the category of \"fantasy documents\" [28] -that is, meeting legal and political requirements but not grounded in realistic capabilities or expectations and not conferring functionality. The great majority still find singlepatient decontamination an elusive goal.",

High turnover rates can quickly deprive a facility of trained employees. Insufficient or ineffective refresher training can produce the same effect as high turnover, as hard-won skills deteriorate due to lack of use. Many preparedness and decontamination training programs are provided in \"trainthe-trainer\" format-that is, a small group of employees is trained and expected to cascade the training down to fellow employees, even though their newly acquired \"expertise\" is unac-companied by experience, additional knowledge, or implementation capability.

The SARS outbreak of 2003 and the effect it had on hospitals and EMS staff is an excellent example: insufficient and inappropriate PPE contributed to the disruptive effect on health systems and exposure among healthcare workers [30, 31] . The safety net that chemoprophylaxis (for example, antibiotics for possible anthrax exposures) and immunization (for example, smallpox vaccine for healthcare workers) can provide will fail if it is not made available promptly and to all affected and potentially affected employees. Employees who are not confident that their employer will offer appropriate protection are unlikely to show up for work during a crisis.

The purpose of an exercise is to evaluate one or more measurable performance items via objective criteria. Performance items may include use of specific equipment, procedures, emergency plans, communications systems, or a combination of those. Given the longstanding JCAHO requirement of at least two exercises per year, hospitals should house considerable expertise in exercise design, conduct, and evaluation. In fact, a most significant recurring pitfall in hospital exercises is a distorted picture. An exercise, like a written plan, may meet JCAHO standards without conferring significant benefit in terms of actual preparedness or response capability on the hospital(s) in question.",

Examples include ED physicians immediately diagnosing rare conditions that are part of the exercise scenario, with equally rarely used medications being immediately available in the ED or pharmacy and, in more than one exercise, a large ED having a full decontamination station set up, with staff wearing full PPE, before play even began. Any exercise scenario induces a certain degree of artificiality, but effective exercises are designed so that artificiality does not interfere with evaluation of identified objectives. Untoward, artificial, staff preparation for an exercise adds artificiality that directly compromises effective evaluation. In addition, the overwhelming lack of exercises on evening and night shifts tests capabilities only when a hospital is at its highest staffing levels.

Hospitals are part of a greater whole, but each hospital must also have a degree of self-sufficiency to enable independent operations should regional assistance be unavailable.

The second step is to realize that any system can be overtaxed and that there will be some incidents in which even the most durable system will fail. Realistic expectations for communications systems in disasters are essential for effective implementation of an emergency operations plan. Redundancy is an obvious and desirable solution; simple lowtech equipment can be effective. Satellite phones and trunked and repeated radios that allow flexible external communications are important, but if the trunking system and/or repeaters are external to the hospital, the most the hospital can do is buy into the system. Likewise, amateur radio offers a vital and achievable link to other hospitals and publicsafety providers, but by definition they are outside the facility. This is not meant to de-emphasize the importance of being able to communicate with public safety and other agencies, but rather to focus on what can be done internally.

These systems can be surprisingly robust, even if communications into and out of the facility are disrupted. A facility that owns its own phone switch (that is, switching is done by an internal rather than an external computer) is more likely to retain internal function than one relying on a service provider's switch. This is even more important for large campuses comprising multiple buildings. Most hospitals have such boards in place, but they are not necessarily used during emergency operations. Status boards serve an important function away from patient-care areas as well: information management in hospital emergency operations centers (also known as command centers, coordination centers, and facility command posts). Effective display media in emergency operations centers are essential for managing incoming information, tracking resources and events, and making appropriate resource allocation decisions. \u2022 Runners: When all else fails-and even when it does not-runners are commonly employed to carry information between functional areas or groups. Given the universality of this function, it might as well be part of the plan, to be practiced and tested. Combining runners, status boards, and digital cameras creates the opportunity to receive quick, non-intrusive status reports from various parts of a hospital: literally a snapshot of status that may be delivered to the hospital's emergency operations center and displayed there. \u2022 Self-initiation: This is more a training than a communications issue, but the point is that the better trained and exercised employees are, the more capable they will be of independent implementation of an emergency operations plan when activation is initiated.

[39] effectively summarized healthcarespecific needs and goals for decontamination training that incorporate recent OSHA interpretations [40] [41] [42] [43] . \u2022 Let clinicians be clinicians: There are a few positions within a HEICS organization that should be filled by physicians, but in general the most important function for physicians in a disaster is that of a clinician. As many hospitals contract with physician groups, particularly for ED coverage, ensuring training is difficult. Therefore, hospitals should include select staff physicians in HEICS and other disaster training and provide brief orientations to the bulk of physicians, so that they understand the roles, responsibilities, and function of the emergency organization. \u2022 Move some training to the schools: New guidelines from the Association of American Medical Colleges [44] suggest a curriculum for future physicians in medical schools. Several nursing schools have been offering disaster courses for a year or more.",

Hick et al.[49] lucidly summarized recent interpretations, considerations, and justifications for Level C PPE in healthcare settings until more definitive standards are promulgated. OSHA has issued comprehensive and functional best practices for \"first receivers\" [49A] (the first hospital providers to make contact with patients from a large-scale external event), but at this writing they have not been formally adopted as standards.\u2022  Level C is still a step up: The decision to use Level C protection does not encompass an escape from OSHA standards for respiratory protection; [50] it requires personnel using respirators to undergo medical screening, fittesting (not necessary if hooded positive airpurifying respirators are used), training, and refreshers. Certain circumstances could justify Level B PPE, but this would be beyond the baseline and would be limited to facilities capable of implementing and maintaining the training and regulatory upkeep. \u2022 Plan to provide staff with chemoprophylaxis and/or immunizations as indicated: Whether chemoprophylaxis and/or immunizations come from internal stocks (most likely for initial use), locally cached supplies, or the material from the Strategic National Stockpile (SNS) [51]",
