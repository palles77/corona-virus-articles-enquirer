In order to complete our review of viral factors that influence the tropism of viruses for the CNS, we will discuss the role of viral genes that function to specifically enhance the replication of viral proteins in certain cells or tissues ('tissue-specific enhancers and promoters'). We will then examine the ways in which host factors, including specific host genes, can influence resistance or suscepbbility to certain types of neurotropic viral infections.

The human papovavirus, JC, which is the agent responsible for progressive multifocal leucoencephalopathy (PML), has provided an important example of the significance of viral transcriptional regulatory elements as a determining fac: tor in neurotropism 2.

This dysfunction in turn correlates with the inheritance of JCV DNA sequences, and high levels of JCV mRNA expression in the brain. It has been proposed that the cell-specificity of JCV DNA expression (i.e. in oligodendrocytes) might be due to the JCV enhancer elements, and that the subsequent expression of T-antigen in these cells could result in impairment of oligodendrocyte-induced myelination 6.

The LTR contains promoter and enhancer elements.

            "text": "In several cases, viral genes that do not encode either cell-attachment proteins or tissue-specific enhancers have been shown to be important determinants of neurovirulence or neurotropism, although in most cases their mechanism of action remains speculative. In the case of herpes simplex virus (HSV), the generation of intertypic recombinant viruses containing parts of the genomes from an HSV type 1 and an HSV type 2 parent have produced interesting insights into regions of the HSV genome important in neurotropism. In a number of these studies, the region of the HSV genome between 0.71--0.83 map units (m.u.) has repeatedly been shown to be important in neurovirulence and neurotropism 2~-23. This region encodes a number of HSV proteins including the immediate early proteins (ICP0, ICP4, ICP27) as well as ICP34.5. In analogous studies, the region of the genome between 0.31--0.44 m.u. has been shown to contain determinants that are important in allowing HSV to spread to the CNS after peripheral inoculation 24. This region also encodes a number of viral proteins including an envelope glycoprotein (gB), p40, ICP8, and the viral DNA polymerase. A great deal more work will be required before the regions of the HSV genome involved in neural spread, neurotropism, and neurovirulence can be defined at a more precise level. Nonetheless, these studies serve to emphasize the point that although a great deal of attention has focused on viral genes that encode cell attachment proteins or that act as tissuespecific enhancers, undoubtedly a large number of viral genes play critical roles at specific steps in viral pathogenesis and replication that are essential for infection of the CNS; alterations in many viral genes, by affecting a variety of steps in pathogenesis or replication, may consequently influence neurotropism. The principle that emerges from these studies is that neurotropism is influenced by viral genes acting at many steps in the viral replicative cycle and at different stages of pathogenesis. For many neurotropic viruses, young mice are more susceptible to infection than older mice, although poliovirus and viruses such as LCM, which produce immune-mediated pathology, represent exceptions to this rule. A variety of mechanisms may account for the development of age-related resistance to viral infection, including maturation of the immune response, changes in the susceptibility of macrophages to viral infection, increased interferon production, and changes in the susceptibility of critical target cell populations 27. Malnutrition and altered dietary states have been associated with increased susceptibility to infection with neurotropic viruses 27. A consistent sex-related difference (female resistance) in susceptibility to infection with toga viruses, picornaviruses, and rabies virus has also been seen 28. i The importance of differences in the genetic background of the host in the resistance to neuro-' tropic viral infections has been extensively investigated using inbred strains of mice 29. Examples of genetically related susceptibility have been described with rabies [} virus 3\u00b0, neurotropic coronaviruses 31, certain neurotropic retroviruses 32, flaviviruses, herpes simplex, and measles 33, and in diseases such as scrapie 34. In some cases, differences in the humoral and cell-mediated immune responses appear to be involved. For example, SJL and CBA mice are more resistant to intraperitoneal inoculation of street rabies virus than BALB/c or DBA mice. These differences correlate with the magnitude of the serum anti-rabies antibody response, which in turn seems to affect the degree of virus replication in the CNS 3\u00b0. More commonly, genes determining susceptibility do not appear to be linked to immune responsiveness 33.",

Host genes may also affect the sensitivity of specific viruses to the action of interferon, as illustrated by the capacity of the Mx gene in mice to protect carriers against lethal infection with influenza virus 36. Differences in susceptibility of inbred mouse strains may also reflect variation in the presence?, nature, or distribution of viral receptors, as has recently been shown for mouse hepatitis virus (MHV), a coronavirus 32.

This part of F1 is highly conserved among the paramyxoviruses, and appears to be the critical component mediating their fusion function.

The recognition that there is an anatomical and physiological barrier to the free entry of macromolecules from the cerebral circulation into the brain parenchyma (the blood-brain barrier) led David Bodian and others to postulate that areas where the blood-brain barrier was permeable (e.g. due to the presence of fenestrated capillary endothelial cells, the lack of a dense basement membrane, and less densely applied astrocyte processes) could serve as loci minoris resistante for the establishment of infection by blood-borne viruses. The choroid plexus does indeed seem to play this role for certain neurotropic viruses (e.g. mumps), although a similar role for other sites (e.g. area postrema) has never been consistently demonstrated.",

Current understanding of the methods by which hematogenously spreading viruses invade the CNS makes it difficult to understand why the tropism of viruses spreading exclusively by this route should be affected by the site of entry into the host, providing that the generation and maintenance of an equivalent magnitude viremia occurs. Nonetheless, old studies on the mechanism of the 'provoking effect' in experimental poliomyelitis raise this possibility 49. Bodian observed that cynomolgus monkeys given intramuscular injections of a variety of different substances followed within a specified interval by intracardiac inoculation of poliomyelitis virus (Type 1, Mahoney), developed a disproportionate incidence of initial paralysis affecting the traumatized limb (the 'provoking effect'). He suggested that local trauma could increase the permeability of blood vessels in the region of the spinal cord innervating the injured limb and thereby result in preferential localization of blood-borne poliomyelitis virus in that region of the spinal cord. Persuasive evidence for this sequence of events has never been obtained, and the issue of the effect of route of entry on CNS tropism for hematogenously spreading viruses must be considered unresolved.",

This is illustrated by murine infections via different routes with the neurotropic NWS strain of influenza 5\u00b0. After intranasal inoculation, virus spreads via nerves and produces destruction of neurons in the olfactory bulbs, trigeminal ganglia, and certain brainstem and cortical regions. After intraperitoneal inoculation, virus spreads hematogenously; little injury is noted in the olfactory bulbs, trigeminal ganglia or brainstem, and instead viral injury and viral antigens are found primarily in ependymal cells, perivascularly in the brain parenchyma, and occasionally in the choroid plexus and leptomeninges. Thus, in this model, differences in viral tropism appear to be primarily due to the nature of the predominant pathway used by the virus to enter the CNS.",

Viral genes may encode proteins that are capable of interacting with specific receptors on the surface of host cells. Viral genes can also determine whether transcription of viral genes and translation of viral mRNA occurs in specific types of cells. The susceptibility of the host to viral infections can be influenced by specific host genes that can determine the nature of the host response to viral infection (e.g. interferon production or antibody response), or the availability of receptors required for viral infectivity. Non-genetic factors such as the age and nutritional status of the host may also profoundly alter susceptibility to neurotropic viral infections. Finally, a number of interactions between the host and the virus such as the site of viral entry and the route of spread of virus can also influence the ultimate distribution of viral infection within the CNS.
