Fecal samples from 482 cats, approximately half of the cats with normal fecal consistency and half with diarrhea, were tested by zinc sulfate centrifugation and by real-time PCR for a panel of enteropathogens.",

The types of enteropathogens detected were related to the type of management model, e.g., viral and protozoal infections were most common in shelters, sanctuaries, and foster homes (confinement systems), whereas helminth infections were most common in trap-neuterreturn programs (free-roaming cats).",

Causes of diarrhea include factors such as stress, dietary change, microbiome dysbiosis (Suchodolski et al., 2015) , and infectious enteropathogens. A variety of feline and zoonotic enteropathogens capable of inducing diarrhea have been documented in unowned cats (Hill et al., 2000; Spain et al., 2001; Mekaru et al., 2007; Gow et al., 2009; Weese, 2011; Sabshin et al., 2012; Spada et al., 2013; Raab et al., 2016) . Factors that affect transmission of enteropathogens include single vs. group housing, sanitation practices, facility construction, preventive health protocols, host immunity, and the prevalence of other infectious organisms (Pedersen et al., 2004) . However, not all infections are associated with diarrhea, making it difficult to identify and segregate cats that may be shedding enteropathogens based on clinical signs alone (Hill et al., 2000; Vasilopulos et al., 2006; Gow et al., 2009; Queen et al., 2012; Sabshin et al., 2012; Paris et al., 2014; Silva and Lobato, 2015) .",

However, no such population-level guidelines are available to help shelter managers mitigate the animal and public health risks of enteropathogens. Guidelines developed for care of individually owned cats can be impractical in animal welfare organizations due to limited funding, staffing, and technical expertise. In the absence of expert guidance, shelter managers must devise their own preventive health programs, often in the absence of veterinary input or knowledge of the most important enteropathogens in their specific facilities.",

A majority of cats carried at least one enteropathogen of feline or zoonotic importance, regardless of management model. Prevalence of specific enteropathogens varied between management models, likely reflecting differences in preventive healthcare and housing conditions. For example, the TNR cohort consisted of free-roaming unowned cats with exposure to the natural environment and lacking regular preventive care, a possible explanation for the higher prevalence of helminths in this Table 2 Prevalence of enteropathogens in 482 cats tested in short-term shelters, long-term sanctuaries, foster care programs, and trap-neuter-return programs. group. In contrast, cats confined in FCP and LTS had close contact with other cats, shared litterboxes, dishes, and confined environments, and often received anthelmentics. Overall, enteropathogens that were highly contagious through contact with feces and had a chronic carrier state, such as Giardia spp., T. foetus (Cave et al., 2004; Yao and K\u00f6ster, 2015; Arranz-Sol\u00eds et al., 2016) , were found more commonly in cats sharing litter boxes (LTS and FCP) and less commonly in single-housed (STS) and non-confined cats (TNR).",

It has been suggested that cats housed in sanctuaries should be quarantined in single housing units, tested for enteropathogens, receive standardized vaccinations and parasite treatments, and be provided medically indicated individual treatments prior to introduction to other sanctuary animals (Polak et al., 2014) . Routine surveillance of pathogens within the sanctuary should be performed at regular intervals and control protocols revised as needed. On a practical level, this is unlikely to be feasible, since many sanctuaries are under-resourced, lack veterinary oversight, and frequently operate beyond their capacity to ensure the health of the cats and the people who care for them (Polak et al., 2014) . In addition, many enteropathogens are only intermittently shed in sufficient amounts to be detected by diagnostic tests, thus risking introduction by cats with undetected infections (Mekaru et al., 2007; Little et al., 2015) , and curative treatments are lacking for many enteropathogens. For managing feline and public health risks, cats adopted out of sanctuaries should have complete health examinations after adoption, and those transferred to other agencies should be segregated from other cats.",

Anthelmintics and treatment for external parasites should be routinely administered to all cats according to established guidelines 1 (Smith et al., 2009; Little et al., 2015) . Intake protocols that include routine treatments against coccidia (Litster et al., 2014) , tapeworms, and fleas (which can transmit tapeworms) in endemic regions can be more practical and costeffective than individualized testing and treatment. Treatments against some common enteropathogens, such as T. foetus, Cryptosporidium spp., and Giardia spp., are often impractical in large populations, or in the case of FCoV, do not exist . Such infections can be difficult to eradicate once introduced into a population. Although guidelines exist for minimizing the risk of zoonotic transmission from individual cats, particularly to immunocompromised individuals (Tuzio et al., 2005) , no such guidelines exist for large cat populations. Fortunately, the strains of Cryptosporidium spp. and Giardia spp. carried by cats are generally of low zoonotic potential Thompson et al., 2008) . This study had several limitations. Selection of participating organizations and the cats that were sampled were selected by convenience, as opposed to random selection. Therefore, it was not possible to assure that the sampled cats were similar to cats not sampled, and caution should be used when extrapolating the results to broader populations. Since fecal samples were intentionally collected such that approximately half were diarrhea and half were of normal consistency, the overall prevalence of diarrhea and enteropathogens in each sheltering model was not determined. Most of the cats with positive FPV tests had been recently vaccinated, and it is possible that the PCR test detected the vaccine virus rather than natural infection (Truyen et al., 2009) . Cats were tested only once, whereas many pathogens have variable rates of fecal shedding that may fall below the limit of detection (Mekaru et al., 2007; Little et al., 2015) . In addition, the pathogen screening panel used in this study did not include all enteropathogens associated with diarrhea in cats, such as rotavirus (Martella et al., 2010; German et al., 2015; Otto et al., 2015) , calicivirus (Castro et al., 2015) , and astrovirus (Ng et al., 2014) . It is likely that more enteropathogens will be associated with gastrointestinal disease in cats as they continue to be evaluated (Ng et al., 2014) .",

Practical options for control are limited by the diverse scope of enteropathogens, expense and limitations of diagnostic tests, lack of curative treatment options for many organisms, co-mingling of cats, and prolonged shedding and environmental persistence of some organisms. In light of the widespread presence of enteropathogens, risk-management strategies should be implemented to reduce transmission to people and other animals. These should focus on establishing high standards for housing and sanitation, routine administration of anthelmintics, compliance with preventive care guidelines, periodic surveillance, response to specific enteropathogen patterns, humane population management of free-roaming community cats, public health education, and most importantly, minimizing the duration and number of cats in mass confinement.",
