The earliest lesions were characterized by decreased MBP and MAG and increased GFAP. During the further progression of the disease, MBP and MAG losses continued to match each other. There was no indication of MAG loss preceding the disappearance of MBP. In the more advanced lesions there was a marked decrease of GFAP positive cells. Since these findings differed considerably from similar immunohistochemical studies in progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) where demyelination results from oligodendroglial infection, it was concluded that the oligodendroglial cell body is not the primary target of CDV. The marked astrogtial changes were also considered to contribute to demyelination in CDV infection but the mechanism by which this happens remains unknown.",

            "text": "Although demyelination in canine distemper virus (CDV) infection in dogs has been known for more than a century (Saunders 1973; Fankhauser 1982) its pathogenesis remains enigmatic. Immunopathologic reactions may play a role in the chronic stage of the disease (Krakowka et al. 1973; Vandevelde et al. 1982a, b) but recent evidence (Summers et al. 1979; Higgins et al. 1982; Vandevelde et al. 1982 a, b) leaves little doubt that the initial demyelinating lesions in distemper are directly virus-induced. It is not apparent how CDV causes myelin destruction. Ultrastructural studies (Wisniewski et al. 1972; Raine 1976; Summers 1979; Higgins et al. 1982) have consistently demonstrated CDV particles in the lesions, but have rarely (Raine 1976) , if at all (Higgins et al. 1982) , provided evidence for oligodendroglial infection or cytolysis. One fluorescent antibody study (Vandevelde and Kristensen 1977) failed to show a pattern of oligodendroglial infection in CDV-induced lesions as has been demonstrated with similar techniques in corona virus infection in mice (Nagashima et al. 1978) . A very important recent finding, however, was the demonstration of segmental demyelination in early distemper lesions suggesting some form of oligodendroglial alteration (Higgins et al. 1982) . In another ultrastructural study (Summers et al. 1979) it was suggested that CDV-induced fusion of glial cell membranes may lead to myelin destruction.",

The dogs had been infected with Cornell A75-15 CDV (kindly provided to us by Dr. M. Appel, Cornell University, Ithaca, NY, USA) . The details of the experimental procedure have been described elsewhere (Vandevelde et al. 1982a, b; Cerruti-Sota et al. 1983 ). In all dogs the brains had been removed immediately after death and fixed in 10~ CaC% neutralized formalin or 4~o PBS-buffered paraformaldehyde solution. Representative areas were processed for paraffin embedding. Sections stained with HE were examined, and a total of 22 representative lesion areas were selected from 14 dogs for immunohistological staining. These dogs had been killed at 16, 21, 24, 29, 31, 33, 34, 42, 56 , and 63 days after infection. All lesions were located in the classical subpial or periventricular predilection areas including the cerebellar central and foliated white matter, the cerebellar peduncles, and the white matter in the vicinity of the IVth ventricle. Sections were also cut from the same predilection sites in two dogs that survived the infection without brain lesions and in five normal noninfected beagle dogs. Anti MBP -PAP, x 100. B Adjacent section, to A. Loss of MAG does not noticeably exceed that of MBP (three asterisks in the vicinity of blood vessels serve as landmarks). Anti MAG-PAP x 100. C Spongy lesion in the cerebellar foliated white matter; 42 days p.i. Edge of lesion is roughly indicated by arrows. Loss of GFAP-positive cells as compared to the surrounding tissue. In the middle of the lesion a group of rounded cells As antiserum against the myelin associated glycoprotein (MAG) served a human monoclonal antibody (IgM K) from a patient with peripheral neuropathy. This serum binds specifically to MAG as shown by immunoblotting studies (Steck et al., submitted). In addition, imnmnocytochemical studies with this serum showed strong binding to myelin in several animal species including the dog with selective labeling of the periaxonal space (Steck et al., submitted). Antimyelin basic protein (MBP) was prepared by repeated injections of human MBP in complete Freund's adjuvans into rabbits and was a kind gift of Dr. C. Beranek, University of Berne.",

Thus, a pattern of demyelination in which the destruction of MAG precedes the one of the major myelin protein MBP, is indicative of a lesion at the level of the oligodendroglial cell body. There is some discrepancy in this hypothesis: although a similar sequence of events as in PML seems to take place in MS lesions (Itoyama et al. 1980 ), a recent ultrastructural study showed surviving and even multiplying oligodendrocytes in an active MS lesion (Raine et al. 1981) suggesting that the myelin sheath itself is the primary target in MS. However, in contrast to PML, the cause and pathogenesis of MS are largely unknown. Therefore, we believe that it is justified to compare the findings in PML (Itoyama et al. 1982) with those obtained by means of similar techniques in distemper lesions, which -for reasons discussed above -are also virus-induced.",

            "text": "Our results show simultaneous involvement of MBP and MAG in CDV infection. Even in the earliest lesions there was no clear indication for primary affection of MAG. Although in some lesions the loss of MAG seemed more obvious than the one of MBP, there was never any major discrepancy in MAG and MBP stainings as in the PML lesions studied by Itoyama et al. (1982) . The staining differences in a few of our lesions could be explained by the fact that MAG constitutes only a very small portion of the total myelin protein fraction, whereas MBP accounts for 30 ~ (Braun and Bostroff 1977) . In conclusion, our present study does not provide support for a primary lesion of the oligodendroglial cell in CDV infection similar to the one in PML. Our observations are consistent with previous ultrastructural (Wisniewski et al. i972; Raine 1976; Summers et al. 1979; Higgins et al. 1982) or fluorescent antibody studies (Vandevelde and Kristensen 1977) , which failed to provide conclusive evidence for oligodendroglial infection in canine distemper. However, Higgins et al. (1982) clearly demonstrated segmental demyelination in early distemper lesions similar to the one in experimental corona virus infection in mice, a disease in which oligodendrocytes are known to be the primary target (Lampert 1978; Dal Canto and Rabinowitz 1982) . It is conceivable that CDV induces primary lesions in the distal portions of the oligodendrocyte. Virus-induced fusion of glial membranes at this level, as proposed by Summers et al. (1979) , could play an important role.",

Surprisingly, during the further progression of demyelination regressive astroglial changes became conspicuous. In lesions with a pronounced spongy state there was a very clear decrease of GFAP-positive cells and processes. In addition we observed very faintly staining plump rounded cells in such lesions. Since all ultrastructural studies so far have shown abundant evidence for widespread astroglial infection in distemper (Wisniewski et al. 1972; Raine 1976; Summers et al. 1979; Higgins et al. 1982) it seems reasonable to explain the astrocytic changes in this study as a result of a profound cytopathic effect of CDV. It remains unclear if or how astroglial changes could be associated with demyelination. It has been known for a long time that fibrous astrocytes are an integral part of the white matter (Spielmeyer 1922) , where they are considered to provide structural support (Peters et al. 1976) . Although desmosome-like junctions between oligodendrocytes and astrocytes have been observed (Raine 1977) it is not clear how the latter cells would contribute to the stability and/or maintenance of the myelin sheath. The striking spongy appearance of advanced acute demyelinating lesions in distemper is ultrastructurally characterized by increased extracellular space and ballooning of myelin sheaths (Summers et al. 1979) . The vacuolated appearance of such lesions is reminiscent of brain edema associated with other noninfectious diseases in various animal species (Fankhauser and Luginbiihl 1968) .",

There are some similarities in this respect between CDV infection and demyelination in mice after experimental herpes simplex virus infection (Townsend 1981) . In this model, astroglial infection and cytolysis with vacuolation of myelin sheaths precede demyelination. It is thought that astroglial cytolysis activates macrophages which then cause myelin destruction by release of proteolytic enzymes (Townsend 1981) . However, all these considerations cannot explain the earliest lesion in distemper which consists of segmental demyelination in the absence of edema and in which hypertrophic astrocytes themselves participate in the separation of the myelin sheath from the axon (Higgins et al. 1982) .",

Two of these dogs had no clinical signs, the other two had clinically improved after an initial period of severe neurologic impairment. However, as shown on previous occasions (Summers et al. 1979; Vandevelde et al. 1982b; Higgins et al. 1982) clinico-pathologic correlations are often lacking in distemper. We cannot exclude that these four dogs had only mild lesions in the acute stage of infection. Thus, our immunohistological findings showing only minor myelin changes in these dogs cannot be taken as evidence of remyelination which is known to occur in distemper (McCullough et al. 1974; Higgins et al. 1982) , without corresponding ultrastructural studies of the same lesions.",

Some dogs with inflammatory lesions may recover clinically as literature data (McCullough et al. 1974; Appel et al. 1982) and the results of the present study indicate, while a few dogs develop severe progressive inflammatory demyelination as seen in some cases of spontaneous distemper. Such local immunologic reaction may enhance myelin destruction perhaps on an autoimmune basis as some studies indicate (Krakowka et al. 1973; Vandevelde et al. 1982a, b) . In the present study only one dog was examined at the stage of intense inflammation. Therefore, our immunocytochemical data are not sufficient to shed some light on the possibility of an immunologic attack on the oligodendrocyte in inflammatory canine distemper lesions.",

Further ultrastructural studies will be necessary to clarify the pathogenesis of virus-induced demyelination in CDV infection.",
