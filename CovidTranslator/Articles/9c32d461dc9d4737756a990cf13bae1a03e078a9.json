Disrupted mucus production is a cardinal feature of chronic respiratory diseases but how this alteration affect interactions between mucins and pathogens is complex and poorly understood. Here, we identify a central and unexpected role for the major airway mucin MUC5AC in pathogenesis of virus-induced exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Virus induction of MUC5AC is augmented in COPD compared to healthy subjects, is enhanced in frequent exacerbators and correlates with inflammation, symptom severity and secondary bacterial infection during exacerbation. MUC5AC is functionally related to inflammation as MUC5ACdeficient (Muc5ac-/-) mice had attenuated rhinovirus-induced airway inflammation whilst exogenous MUC5AC glycoprotein administration augmented virus-induced inflammatory responses and bacterial load. Mechanistically, MUC5AC-augmentation of rhinovirus-induced inflammation occurred through release of extracellular adenosine triphosphate (ATP). Therapeutic suppression of virus-induced MUC5AC release using an epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) inhibitor ameliorated exaggerated pro-inflammatory responses in a mouse COPD exacerbation model. Collectively, these studies demonstrate previously unrecognised pro-inflammatory effects of MUC5AC during infection and thus highlight a key unforeseen role in driving COPD exacerbation severity.",

We observed that sputum MUC5AC concentrations correlated with both upper and lower respiratory tract symptom scores ( Fig.2i ) with no significant correlations observed for MUC5B (Supplementary Fig.1h ). Since chronic mucus hypersecretion is associated with long term FEV 1 decline 19 , we also hypothesized that the amplified induction of MUC5AC during RV infection would be related to acute lung function changes during COPD exacerbation.

A previous study demonstrated that supernatants of mucopurulent material from subjects with cystic fibrosis can induce epithelial release of extracellular adenosine triphosphate (ATP) 20 , a well-recognised promoter of inflammation 21 that is also virus-inducible 22 . We therefore hypothesised that MUC5AC exerts its pro-inflammatory effects during RV infection via induction of extracellular ATP and examined the effect of ATP neutralisation using the ATP-hydrolysing enzyme apyrase in exogenous MUC5AC-treated RV-infected mice (Fig 5a) . Exogenous MUC5AC protein administration augmented BAL concentrations of ATP in RV-infected mice, an effect that was abrogated by instillation of apyrase (Fig 5b) . Apyrase administration also suppressed exogenous MUC5AC-mediated increases in airway inflammation during RV infection including BAL total cells and neutrophils (Fig. 5c) , inflammatory chemokines CXCL1/KC, CXCL2/MIP-2 and CCL5/RANTES (Fig. 5d) and pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF and IL-1b (Fig. 5e) . Apyrase also prevented the exogenous MUC5AC-mediated increase in neutrophil elastase, reversed the MUC5AC-mediated suppression of SLPI and suppressed MUC5ACmediated increased bacterial loads in RV-infected mice (Fig 5f-g) . Apyrase-mediated reversal of pro-inflammatory effects of MUC5AC did not occur via interference with antiviral immune responses or virus control, as we also observed no effect of apyrase on RVinduction of IFN-\u03b1, IFN-l2/3 (Supplementary Fig.6a -c) or lung virus loads ( Supplementary   Fig.6d) .",

By contrast, MUC5B was not induced above baseline and did not differ between COPD and control subjects at any timepoint, indicating that MUC5AC is the major induced mucin during exacerbations. We also found positive correlations between MUC5AC and a range of inflammatory markers. Since airway inflammation is enhanced in COPD exacerbations and believed to contribute to duration and severity of RV induced illnesses 17, 18 we also determined the relationship between MUC5AC and exacerbation severity, finding positive correlations with virus loads, symptom scores and acute lung function decline. MUC5AC is one of the major glycoprotein components of airway mucus and it is therefore unsurprising that its expression during virus infection correlates with lower respiratory symptom scores which comprise an assessment of sputum production. The correlation of MUC5AC with PEF decline can be explained by the fact that greater mucus production is likely to contribute directly to airway obstruction during exacerbation. Our findings in this acute human infection model are in keeping with clinical studies that have reported the association of symptomdefined chronic mucus hypersecretion phenotype with airflow limitation and FEV 1 decline 19, 25 and an animal study showing that genetic deletion of Muc5ac reduces mucus occlusion and improves lung function in models of allergic airway inflammation 11 .",

This contrasts our findings using exogenous MUC5AC administration where there was no effect on virus loads and MUC5AC enhanced virus-induced inflammation. The transgenic strain employed by Ehre et al was associated with ~18-fold increase in airway MUC5AC levels 9 . This level of augmentation greatly exceeds the increases observed in our human analyses where a ~2-fold increase was observed in stable state levels of MUC5AC in COPD versus healthy subjects and ~2-to 3-fold increase was observed from baseline to exacerbation. The concentrations of exogenous MUC5AC protein administered in our animal experiments (0.25-0.5mg/mL) were ~ 1.5-3.5 fold higher than the baseline MUC5AC protein concentrations we measured in the mouse airway (~150\u00b5g/mL) and are therefore more likely to be physiologically relevant to human exacerbation. Further, the effect of MUC5AC in reducing virus loads at the much higher MUC5AC levels generated in the MUC5AC transgenic strain reported by Ehre et al may be virus-specific 9 . The authors reported that MUC5AC binds to the influenza virus receptor, \u03b12,3-linked sialic acids in transgenic animals, consistent with a mechanism of influenza protection in vivo through impairment of efficient binding of virus to receptors on the bronchial epithelium leading to reduction in virus loads and consequently lesser inflammation. It is important to note that we used a non-human purified mucin protein in solution for our experiments which does not fully recapitulate the complex biophysical properties of mucin glycoprotein contained within endogenous airway mucus. We confirmed that the mucin preparation used was free of endotoxin and DNA but we cannot exclude that other mucin-bound proteins are present in the solution that may be contributing to the observed effects. Future validation of our findings using administration of human or mouse MUC5AC in similar mouse models is warranted, although extraction and purification of mucins from these sources is technically challenging and was not feasible for the current studies.",

            "text": "In addition to our observation that MUC5AC directly augments rhinovirus-induced airway inflammation, a number of previous studies have also demonstrated that inflammatory mediators such as neutrophil elastase and IL-1b can directly induce MUC5AC expression in lung epithelium 35 . We therefore speculate that mucin-induced airway inflammation might trigger further production of MUC5AC leading to a vicious cycle which contributes to enhanced airway inflammation and mucus hypersecretion to drive exacerbation severity in COPD. We thus hypothesised that early targeting of MUC5AC during rhinovirus infection might beneficially interrupt this cycle and evaluated the effect of upstream inhibition of rhinovirus-induction of MUC5AC using the EGFR inhibitor AG1478 in a COPD exacerbation mouse model. AG1478 suppressed rhinovirus-induced MUC5AC levels, accompanied by reduced airway inflammation, pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, neutrophil elastase and AHR, as well as enhanced SLPI production and reduced bacterial loads in rhinovirus-infected elastase-treated mice. Importantly, AG1478 had no impact on anti-viral responses, or virus control, reassuringly indicating that therapies aimed at inhibiting MUC5AC production would not be expected to adversely affect anti-viral host-defence. Jing et al recently reported in COPD airway epithelial cell cultures that administration of an EGFR inhibitor had no effect on RV-induction of MUC5AC and concluded that EGFR does not play a role in promoting virus-induced mucin expression in COPD 36 . However, in this study, the authors examined mucin expression solely at a late timepoint (15 days) post RV infection and did not evaluate effects of the treatment on mucin expression at earlier timepoints nor subsequent effects on production of inflammatory mediators. The data from our human challenge model indicates that peak RV induction of MUC5AC occurs at a much earlier timepoint (3 days) and previous studies have shown that EGFR inhibition can attenuate the early induction of MUC5AC in RV-stimulated airway epithelial cell cultures 23, 37 Our data in a mouse model of COPD-like disease supports the assertion that the early production of MUC5AC in response to RV infection occurs through EGFR and is thus amenable to therapeutic inhibition. A previous study using an inhaled EGFR inhibitor in stable COPD reported more effective EGFR inhibition was related to greater decreases in epithelial mucin stores at higher doses, but this drug was poorly tolerated 38 . Systemic EGFR antagonists are now commonly used in lung adenocarcinoma therapy 39 . Our data in mice now provides justification for human studies to evaluate the role of repurposing these agents for use in COPD exacerbations to inhibit MUC5AC production which could theoretically suppress airway inflammation, reduce secondary bacterial infection and diminish exacerbation severity.",

            "text": "Mucins were quantified in our study using ELISA-based assays in historically collected sputum samples specifically within a separated sputum plug aliquot, as this was the sample type available to us. Sputum plugs from severe asthmatics have previously been shown to contain more MUC5AC than MUC5B 40 and this constituent likely contains more surface goblet cell derived mucin which may contribute to the differences observed between induction of these two mucins in our studies. However, we also observed increased RVinduced MUC5AC but not MUC5B in an alternative sample type (BAL) from COPD subjects versus healthy subjects, supporting our findings in sputum. There is also evidence to suggest that proteases within sputum samples can interfere with immunodetection of mucins 14 . Some studies have attempted to address this by using treatment with protease inhibitors shortly after sputum collection 6, 41 . We have previously reported, using samples from the same study, that neutrophil elastase is increased in COPD subjects compared to healthy subjects following virus challenge 16 . Given that we observed greater induction of MUC5AC protein in COPD subjects compared to healthy subjects, despite increased levels of proteases, this suggests that the actual difference between these two groups could be even more substantial than observed in our study. Additionally, our finding that sputum MUC5AC but not MUC5B mRNA expression was increased during naturally-occurring exacerbation (mirroring what was observed at the protein level) provides an additional confirmatory approach that would not be subject to these potential confounders. Other studies have used alternative semi-quantitative antibody-independent techniques 7,14,42 but it is unclear whether these approaches would have sufficient sensitivity to detect subtle changes in mucin expression during infection. The primary aim of the human component of our study was to study how mucin levels change during virus-induced exacerbations and our study was unique in that we had sequential sampling from individual patients during exacerbation with consistent methods used to measure mucins in all subjects.",

These differences are attributed to the harsh conditions during the commercial purification process 5 . As a consequence, here, the purification of porcine gastric MUC5AC is performed manually from fresh pig stomachs. An optimization of the original purification protocol from Celli et.al 6 was described in detail previously 3 . In brief, crude mucus was obtained by gently scraping pig stomachs after rinsing them with tap water. The mucus was diluted 5-fold in 10 mM sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0, supplemented with 170 mM NaCl) and homogenized by stirring at 4 \u00b0C overnight. Cellular debris was removed via several centrifugation steps (8.300 x g for 30 min at 4 \u00b0C and 15.000 x g for 45 min at 4 \u00b0C) and a final ultracentrifugation step (150.000 x g for 1 h at 4 \u00b0C). Afterwards, the supernatant was separated chromatographically by size-exclusion chromatography (\u00c4KTA purifier system, GE Healthcare, equipped with a XK50/100 column packed with Sepharose 6FF), and the fractions containing the mucin glycoproteins were identified via PAS (periodic acid/Schiff's base) staining and pooled. After a subsequent dialysis step against ultra-pure water via cross-flow filtration, the mucin-solution was concentrated, lyophilized and stored at -80 \u00b0C.",

            "text": ", greater neutrophil elastase levels and thus greater risk of development of secondary bacterial infections. Siegel et al previously demonstrated reduced secondary pneumococcal growth following influenza infection in Muc5ac-/-mice 27 , an effect mediated by reduced provision of mucin-derived nutrients for bacterial growth in Muc5ac-/-mice, indicating that MUC5AC may be an important promoter of secondary bacterial infection via more than one mechanism. Combined with our findings in a clinically relevant human model, this highlights inhibition of MUC5AC as a potential target for reducing secondary bacterial infection in COPD. A recent study by Kesimer et al showed that total mucin concentrations in sputum at stable state were higher in COPD patients who experienced frequent exacerbations 7 . Previous studies have also reported chronic mucus hypersecretion to be associated with increased exacerbation frequency 28,29 and mortality risk related to pulmonary infection 30 . Here, we identify that frequent exacerbators also have enhanced sputum MUC5AC concentrations during exacerbation. Underlying mechanisms involved in the frequent exacerbator phenotype are poorly characterised, but our data raise speculation that these patients may have exaggerated mucin responses to infection potentially leading to enhanced airway inflammation and increased symptoms. The human experimental challenge model facilitates sequential sampling at precisely defined time points during the course of infection and allows evaluation of the temporal relationship between variables. We observed that MUC5AC induction peaked early at day 3 in the time course of these RV-induced COPD exacerbations, preceding airway inflammation which peaks between day 9 and day 15 post-infection 1,15 . Given the strong positive correlations observed between MUC5AC and these parameters in the current study, we hypothesised that MUC5AC induced by rhinovirus might contribute directly to enhanced airway inflammation during exacerbations. As it is not possible to infer causation from measurements in our human model we carried out complementary gain and loss of function experiments in mice to directly investigate the effect of a functional role of MUC5AC during rhinovirus infection. Mice with gene targeted deletion of Muc5ac (Muc5ac-/-) had attenuated airway inflammation following RV infection, similar effects to those reported in models of ventilator-induced lung injury in the same knockout strain 31 . In our study, exogenous MUC5AC protein administration additionally augmented rhinovirus induction of proinflammatory responses in mice, thereby confirming that MUC5AC is functionally related to enhanced airway inflammation during virus infection, effects not observed with administration of MUC5B protein or a control polymer of agarose/dextran solution.",
