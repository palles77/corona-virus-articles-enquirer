Accordingly, lyophilized sponge(55 gr. dry wt.) was extracted with diciiioranethane to give 1.3 grams of crude extract. Bioassay guided isolation began by flash chrcmatography on silica gel with successive elution by heptane, chloroform and finally 1:l methanol/chloroform. The antiviral fraction was subjected to repeated vacum flash chromatography (silica gel H) followed by HPLC (silica gel, 10,20% ethyl acetate/heptane) to give l(SOOmg,O.9% of lyophilized sponge) and 2(4Omg,O.O7%) as tan oils.",

A standard 'H CZSY6 experiment along with a one bond HEIUX' experiment established several proton-proton and one bond proton-carbon connectivities. In addition, several 3 bond correlations were obtained by a long range HEX?X*experiment. All correlations observed in these experiments are presented in Table 1 . A determination of the canplete carbon connectivity network by this method was precluded by substantial overlap of the signals for protons on C-5,C-6, and C-13, and for protons bound to C-8, C-9, and C-10. We subsequently performed a 2D iNAD~TEg'loexperiment to establish the remaining carbon connectivities. A contour plot of the upfield region of the symmetrical INADEQUATE 2D matrix is presented in Figure 2 . Cross peaks delineating the canplete connectivity network for all sp3 carbons are evident. Additional one-bond correlations for C-2,C-3,C-4, and C-16 were observed in the downfield region (not shown).The resulting structure assignment is consistent with the major mass spectral fragmentations, shown in Figure 1 .",
