            "text": "By any of several criteria, pneumonia (infection of the pulmonary parenchyma) must be considered one of the most important categories of disease affecting the respiratory system. First, pneumonia is extraordinarily common, accounting for nearly 10% of admissions to many large general hospitals. Overall, it has been estimated that more than 5 million cases of pneumonia occur each year in the United States. Second, pneumonia is a signifi cant cause of death. More than 80,000 Americans die of bacterial pneumonia each year, making it the sixth most common cause of death in the nation. It is no wonder that Sir William Osler referred to pneumonia as \"the captain of the men of death,\" particularly as he spoke before the era of effective antibiotic therapy. For many types of pneumonia, medical therapy with antibiotics (along with supportive care) has great impact on the duration and outcome of the illness. Because of the effectiveness of treatment, the diseases discussed in this chapter typically are gratifying to treat for all involved medical personnel. Unfortunately, the emerging trend during the past 15 years has been the acquisition of antibiotic resistance by some of the organisms causing pneumonia. Therefore, it has been necessary for the treatment of pneumonia to evolve in order to keep pace with patterns of antibiotic resistance.",

When host defense mechanisms of the upper and lower respiratory tracts are overwhelmed, microorganisms may establish residence, proliferate, and cause a frank infectious process within the pulmonary parenchyma. With particularly virulent organisms, no major impairment of host defense mechanisms is needed; pneumonia may occur even in normal and otherwise healthy individuals.

More severe impairment of host defenses is caused by diseases associated with immunosuppression (e.g., acquired immunodefi ciency syndrome), by various underlying malignancies (particularly leukemia and lymphoma), and by use of corticosteroids and other immunosuppressive or cytotoxic drugs. In these cases associated with impairment of host defenses, individuals are susceptible to both bacterial and more unusual nonbacterial infections (see Chapters 24-26).",

Since then it has been recognized as an important cause of pneumonia occurring in epidemics as well as in isolated, sporadic cases. In addition, it seems to affect both previously healthy individuals and those with prior impairment of respiratory defense mechanisms.

The classic example of a lobar pneumonia is that due to S. pneumoniae, although many cases of pneumonia recognized as being due to pneumococcus do not necessarily follow this typical pattern. Bronchopneumonia. In bronchopneumonia, distal airway infl ammation is prominent along with alveolar disease, and spread of the infection and the infl ammatory process tends to occur through airways rather than through adjacent alveoli and acini. Whereas lobar pneumonias appear as dense consolidations involving part or all of a lobe, bronchopneumonias are more patchy in distribution, depending on where spread by airways has occurred. Many of the other bacteria, such as staphylococci and a variety of gram-negative bacilli, may produce this patchy pattern. Interstitial Pneumonia. Interstitial pneumonias are characterized by an infl ammatory process within the interstitial walls rather than the alveolar spaces.

Several days later, patients become acutely and severely ill, with fever, dyspnea, cyanosis, septic shock, and often fi ndings of meningitis. The most prominent abnormality on chest radiograph is mediastinal widening from the hemorrhagic lymphadenitis and mediastinitis. Because viable spores are present in the mediastinum and not in the alveoli, anthrax is generally not transmitted from person to person via droplet nuclei. Despite treatment with ciprofl oxacin or doxycycline, mortality is extremely high after the onset of clinical illness, and public health guidelines have focused on prophylaxis (with either of these antibiotics) to prevent inhalational anthrax following confi rmed or suspected exposure to aerosolized spores. An anthrax vaccine is available but requires a complex administration schedule and annual booster injections.",

However, plague is one of the conditions thought to be of major concern as a possible weapon of bioterrorism. The causative organism is Yersinia pestis, a gram-negative rod that is transmitted by fl eas from rodents to humans. Infection through the skin disseminates to regional lymph nodes, leading to the clinical syndrome of bubonic plague. Infection of the lungs (pneumonic plague) can occur either secondary to bacteremic spread from skin or lymph nodes or via airborne transmission of the organism from person to person. Pneumonic plague is highly contagious through aerosolization of the organisms during cough.",
