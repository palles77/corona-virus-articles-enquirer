Predictions based on these models might not be reliable because these parametric curves are not data-based (see [13, 25] ).

Unfortunately, data are usually inadequate to estimate key model parameters, and these transmission models have not been extensively studied and used.",

            "text": "Back projection (see [8, 9] ) has become one of the most popular methods of reconstructing the past pattern of infections and it is also widely used to predict future numbers of cases with the disease (see [5, 7, 27] ). It makes elementary assumptions about the way the data are generated and the only additional information required is knowledge of the distribution of the time from infection to clinical diagnosis (see [7] ). However, the back-projection method is not without problems. One problem with the back projection method is ill-posed inverse (see [26] ). To avoid the problem, it is necessary to impose some kind of structure on the infection curve. Some implementations of back projection used a smooth parametric model (see [14] ) or a parametric step function (see [8, 9, 27] ) for the incidence curve. However, as the epidemic is only partially observed, it is not easy to correctly specify the incidence curve. Other investigators have allowed a nonparametric form for the incidence curve. Brookmeyer [10] , Bacchetti et al. [5] and Liao and Brookmeyer [22] used a smoothing spline method based on a penalized likelihood. Becker, Watson, and Carlin [7] applied a smoothed EM algorithm developed by Silverman et al. [29] . The smoother used in [7] is easy to compute, but does not perform well at boundaries. For example, Figures 1(b) and (c) show simulation results of the average of the estimated incidence curve over 500 replications of an epidemic, and the smoothed EM, denoted EMS, of Becker and Watson [7] , is biased, and is noticeably unsatisfactory for times close to the end of the observation period. Another common problem with the parametric and nonparametric back-projection methods is that the theoretical properties of the methods are largely unknown.",

Firstly, via the independent incubation process among the infected individuals, we propose the one-step estimate of the infective number at each day j based on the number of observed cases. The one-step estimator has closed-form expression and is obtained without any effort on the program and the computation. Simulations in Section 4 indicate that the one-step estimator performs much better than the unsmoothed and the smoothed back projection methods in terms of the mean square error. Considering that the one-step estimator may have slightly large variance for the number of infections in the recent past due to the very little accurate information available, and because that the recent past is our interest, we make an effort to improve the one-step estimate in the recent past by \"borrowing\" or making use of information of the neighbouring time points. That is, smoothing the one-step estimates over time using one of the existing smoothing techniques. Since the one-step estimator has closed-form, any existing smoothing techniques can be applied without any extra effort to the programming. Compared with the existing methods, the one-step and the smoothing one-step methods are noniterative, easy to compute and are shown to be asymptotically normal both with simple variance formulas.",

To reflect this, we divide the time axis [0, \u03c4] over which data have been collected into intervals of equal length, that may be thought of as \"months\", \"weeks\" or \"days\". These are indexed by the nonnegative integers j, j = 1, . . . , n, where n is the most recent interval beyond which no detected cases are available. We call \u03c4 the current time. Let the observed data d j be the number of cases detected on day j for j = 1, 2, . . . , n, z j be the unobserved number of individuals who were infected on day j, and z ju be the number of individuals infected on day j with incubation period u, u = 0, . . . , k, where k denotes the longest incubation time. Then z j = k u=0 z ju . Let p u be the probability that an infected individual is detected on day u, u = 0, . . . , k after infection. We suppose that p u , u = 0, . . . , k are known and assume that the incubation processes for different infected individuals are independent. This assumption is also made by the existing methods including back-projection. For infectious disease with a short incubation time such as SARS, reliable information on the incubation times is available and accurate estimates of the p u are readily obtained [15, 1] .

Since the infection number near the current time is our primarily interest, it is worthy to make an effort to reduce the variance of the one-step estimator and hence reduce the mean square error for the recent past. A natural method to reduce the variance is applying nonparametric techniques to smooth the one-step estimator over time. As a smoothing method, we choose the local linear model (see [16] ). This method has many good statistical properties. For example, it adapts automatically to the boundary of design points, which is especially important for our problem because our interest is on the boundary. We also note that it may be possible to improve the EMS estimator by using a more reasonable smoother than that which has been used in the EMS algorithm. However, a more reasonable smoother generally means greater computational complexity. Specifically, for the EMS estimator, we need to apply the smooth technique to each iterative EM step of the back projection method, which is a huge computational burden. However, since the one-step estimator has a closed-form, any existing nonparametric smoothing techniques can be used without any extra programming and computational efforts.

Two models are considered. The first concerns an infection processe without intervention, and z j depends on the size of the infective population just before j. Following traditional infection models, we simulate an epidemic process with hazard function h(t) = 0.05y(t\u2212), where y(t\u2212) is the total number of infectives in the population just before time t. We use a Weibull distribution with shape 1.5 and scale 8 to model the distribution of the incubation time (see Figure 1(a) ). The epidemic commences with 15 infective individuals. We conducted 500 simulations and the average of the total number of infected individuals was 959.08 (sd= 220.19). We obtained the estimates of the incidence curve using the one-step estimator (termed OS), the back projection estimator (termed BP) and the back projection method with a smoothed EM (termed EMS, see [7] ). Figure 1(b) shows the average of the estimated incidence curve over the 500 replications for the OS estimator, the BP estimator and the EMS estimator. Table 1 for each method. The bias is defined by the difference of the estimator from the mean number of cases E[z j ] as generated by the simulation model. From Figure 1 (b) and Table 1 , we see that the BP method has the largest variance and is considerably inefficient. The EMS is biased, particularly for times close to n = 95. In contrast, the proposed one-step estimator yielded a estimator that has much less bias than the EMS and has much less variance than the BP, as a result, has consistently smaller RMSE than the EMS and the BP estimators, and the improvement of the one-step estimate over the EMS and the BP increases as j becomes closer to n. Hence, the one-step estimator is much better than the EMS estimator and the BP estimator.

The pattern of the infection curve is in line with the outbreak occuring (see [12] ). The first infection wave, which started around 16th March 2003 in Amoy Garden, a large residential estate made up of many individual blocks. This was initiated by a patient who was treated for chronic renal failure but had been infected by SARS at Prince of Wales Hospital. He visited Amoy Garden on 14 and 19 March 2003 and used the toilet of his brother's flat. After the first wave, the epidemic had spread throughout Hong Kong. In the second wave, there were cluster infections in various hospitals. Two regional hospitals, the United Christian Hospital and the Princess Margaret Hospital, which started admitting SARS patients resulting from the first outbreak around 26th March 2003, both reported local outbreaks in the hospitals. 386 of 1755 infections were medical and healthcare workers. On 10th April 2003, home quarantine was implemented for all households with contacts of confirmed SARS patients. This preventive measure was implemented at the third wave.

To determine the properties of the estimator, we impose the following regularity conditions on \u039b(\u00b7), f (\u00b7) and the kernel function:i. f (\u00b7) is a continuous function with bounded support [0, \u03c4 0 ]; ii. \u039b(\u00b7) is bounded and continuous function on [0, \u03c4] and \u039b (\u00b7) is continuous at the point t 0 ; iii. The kernel K is a symmetric density function with bounded support; iv. sup s d s < \u221e. For any fixed j,. . , d n are independent random variables. Condition (iv) require that the variance of the number of observed cases in unity interval is bounded. Let a ju = p u / n\u2212j u=0 p u for u = 0, 1, . . . , k, j = 1, . . . , n and rewrite\u1e91 j as\u1e91 j = n\u2212j u=0 a ju d j+u . Here, p u = 0 for u > k. Sincewhere t j = j\u03b4 n , a j,s\u2212j is a continuous function of t j and it follows thatis a continuous function of t j and t m . From (A.1), we see that a j,s\u2212j = O(\u03b4 n /(min(\u03c4 \u2212 t j + \u03b4 n , \u03c4 0 ))). Then using condition (iv) and noting n s=j a j,Following Fan and Gijbels [16] , the conditions on K(\u00b7) and t 0 \u2208 [0, \u03c4], we haveexchanging the summation, we haveHence by condition (v), we getFollowing Fan and Gijbels [16] , the conditions on K(\u00b7) andwhere A 1 = b(t 0 , t 0 )/\u03c4 2 , A 2 = b (10) (t 0 , t 0 )u 2 /\u03c4 2 , A 3 = b (11) (t 0 , t 0 )u 2 2 /\u03c4 2 , and b (k1,k2) (x 1 , x 2 ) = \u2202 (k1+k2) b(x 1 , x 2 ) \u2202x k1 1 \u2202x k2 2 , k 1 , k 2 = 0, 1.The first part of Theorem 2 follows from (A.3)-(A.6).
