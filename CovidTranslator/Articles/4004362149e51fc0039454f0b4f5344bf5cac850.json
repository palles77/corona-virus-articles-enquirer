            "text": "Stressful exercise results in temporary immune depression. However, the impact of exercise on the immune responses via toll-like receptor (TLR) 7, which recognizes the common viral genomic feature, singlestranded RNA, remains unclear. To clarify the effect of stressful exercise on immune function in response to viral infection, we measured the changes in the plasma concentration of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-a and interferon (IFN)-a, which are induced downstream from the TLR-ligand interaction, in exhaustive-exercised mice immediately after treatment with the imidazoquinoline R-848, which can bind to and activate TLR7. Both exhaustive-exercised (EX) and non-exercised (N-EX) male C3H/HeN mice were injected with R-848 (5 mg kg -1 ), and blood samples were collected. In addition, RAW264 cells, which are mouse macrophage cells, were cultured 30 min after epinephrine (10 lM) or norepinephrine (10 lM) treatments, and were then stimulated with R-848 (10 lg ml -1 ). In addition, the effect of propranolol (10 mg kg -1 ) as blockade of b-adrenergic receptors on R-848induced TNF-a and IFN-a production in the exercised mice was examined. Both the TNF-a and IFN-a concentrations in the plasma of EX were significantly lower than those in the plasma of N-EX after R-848 injection (P \\ 0.05 and P \\ 0.01, respectively), although the R-848 treatment increased the plasma TNF-a and IFN-a concentrations in both groups (P \\ 0.01, respectively). The R-848-induced TNF-a production in RAW264 cells was significantly inhibited by epinephrine and norepinephrine pre-treatment, although IFN-a was not detected. The propranolol treatment completely inhibited exerciseinduced TNF-a and IFN-a suppression in response to R-848 in the mice. These data suggest that EX induces a reduction in TNF-a and IFN-a production in response to R-848, and that these phenomena might be regulated by an exercise-induced elevation of the systemic catecholamines.",

Recent studies have identified the imidazoquinoline resiquimod (R-848) to be an activator of human and murine toll-like receptor (TLR) 7 and human, but not murine, TLR8 (Jurk et al. 2002) . R-848-induced immune activation is very similar to virus ssRNA-induced immune activation because both R-848 and viral ssRNA bind to TLR7 (Akira et al. 2006) . In fact, pro-inflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-a are induced by R-848 stimulation via nuclear factor-kappa (NF-j) B activation, which lies downstream of the TLR-ligand interaction (Gibson et al. 2002) . In addition, R-848 is a potent inducer of interferon (IFN)-a, an antiviral cytokine (Colonna et al. 2002) , through interferon regulatory factor (IRF) 7 activation (Gibson et al. 2002; Heil et al. 2004; Karlsson et al. 2008) .",

            "text": "In recent studies, it has been reported that stressful exercise might be associated with an increased susceptibility to viral infection by the herpes simplex virus (HSV) and influenza virus infections (Kohut et al. 2001; Murphy et al. 2008) . In fact, stressful exercise has been shown to decrease the macrophage, neutrophil and natural killer cell functions (Davis et al. 1997; Ceddia and Woods 1999; Pyne et al. 2000; Kohut et al. 2001) . In contrast, based on the findings of a bioassay sensitive to IFN-a, it has been suggested that there is a rise in the circulating concentration of IFN-a following acute exercise (Viti et al. 1985) . However, the changes in IFN-a after pathogen stimulation during exercise and after exercise were not shown in that study. Accordingly, there is a possibility that changes in IFN-a in response to R-848 occurred with exhaustive exercise. We and other researchers have already shown that bacterial component-induced pro-inflammatory cytokine production is inhibited by acute exhaustive exercise (Bagby et al. 1994; Kato et al. 2006; Kitamura et al. 2007; Tanaka et al. 2010) . Furthermore, Kitamura et al. (2007) suggested that exercise-induced catecholamines are responsible for exercise-induced suppression of proinflammatory cytokine production. However, it remains unclear whether the immune response to viral infection is also inhibited by intense exercise. In particular, the role of TLR7 on stressful exercise-induced increase in viral infection is not currently understood. It is also unclear whether exercise-induced catecholamines stimulate cytokine production in response to R-848. The purpose of the present study was to determine whether exhaustive exercise (EX) inhibits TNF-a and IFN-a production after R-848 injection in mice. Our hypothesis was that R-848-induced TNF-a and IFN-a production would be inhibited following exhaustive exercise.",

An hour after the R-848 injection, mouse blood samples were collected in EDTA-coated tubes and immediately placed on ice. The plasma was isolated by centrifugation (2,000g, 20 min at 4\u00b0C) of whole blood and stored at -40\u00b0C until analysis of TNF-a and IFN-a.",

It is clear that the signaling pathway downstream of TLR7 requires IRF7, which enhances the ability to bind to the IFN-a promoter after nuclear translocation. Therefore, only IFN-a is directly induced by viral infection, and IFN-a induction is a consequence of this initial IFN-a expression. During viral infections, the rapid production of IFN-a is required to prevent the spread of viruses within the host organism. In addition to its direct antiviral effects, IFN-a regulates both the innate and adaptive immunity. Accordingly, exhaustive exercise-induced IFN-a suppression may be one reason why prolonged strenuous exercise increases the risk for viral infection (Nieman 1994) .",

            "text": "However, the question as to which stage (pathogen recognition, the mRNA expression of cytokine, mRNA translation, and/or post release neutralization) regulates immune depression after exercise remains unanswered, despite tremendous advances in our understanding of the role of TLRs in host defense and the specific signaling events that are initiated following TLR activation (Akira and Takeda 2004) . Acute exercise has been reported to decrease the monocyte cell-surface expression of TLRs in humans (Gleeson et al. 2006; Lancaster et al. 2005; Stewart et al. 2005; Simpson et al. 2009 ). However, other studies found no effect of acute exercise on monocyte cell-surface TLR4 expression (McFarlin et al. 2004; Tanaka et al. 2010) . The most likely explanation for the differences in these findings is related to the intensity/duration of the exercise stimulus and the form of the subject mammal. However, even if the expressions of TLR1, 2, 3 and 4, but not 9, were decreased by acute exercise (Gleeson et al. 2006; Lancaster et al. 2005b) , the effect of the exercise on TLR7 expression still remains unclear. In addition, a recent study showed that EX-induced TNF-a suppression in response to LPS was observed despite no changes in the cell-surface expression of TLR4 and the TNF-a mRNA expression (Tanaka et al. 2010) . Although this model of exercised animals with LPS injection might contribute to the study of immune function in response to bacterial infection, further studies are needed to clarify the detailed cellular and molecular mechanisms of immune functions in response to virus infection. Because it is well known that both LPS/TLR4 and R-848/TLR7 recognition induce NF-jB activation, and thereafter stimulate TNF-a mRNA expression (Akira et al. 2006) , one possibility is that exhaustive exerciseinduced TNF-a suppression in response to R-848 can also be regulated at the post-transcriptional stage of TNF-a in response to R-848.",

            "text": "The differences in the concentrations of epinephrine and norepinephrine between exercised and non-exercised animals are considerable. Exhaustive exercise increases plasma epinephrine (3.0-3.7-fold) and norepinephrine (4.2-10.4-fold) in rodents (Kitamura et al. 2007; Kr\u00fcger Fig. 4 Effect of the b-adrenagic receptor antagonist propranolol (Prop) on plasma TNF-a (a) and IFN-a (b) concentrations in response to R-848 in exhaustive-exercised mice. Mice were treated with Prop (10 mg kg -1 , i.p.) 30 min before the exercise (Prop?EX). Plasma TNF-a and IFN-a concentrations in the EX group were significantly lower than those in the N-EX group 1 h after R-848 (5 mg kg -1 , i.v.) injection (both **P \\ 0.01), but there were no significant differences between the plasma cytokine concentrations in the Prop?EX and the N-EX groups in response to R-848. ( ): n Eur J Appl Physiol (2010 ) 110:797-803 801 et al. 2008 . These catecholamines bind to aand b-adrenergic receptors on the external surface of the cell membranes. The hormone-receptor complexes interact with G proteins and activate adenylate cyclase which converts adenosine triphosphate (ATP) to cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP). cAMP activates protein kinase A, which subsequently phosphorylates certain intracellular proteins, thereby altering their activity (Tanaka et al. 2002; Collado-Hidalgo et al. 2006) . Catecholamines have been shown to suppress TNF-a production in response to LPS via a b-adrenergic receptor (Elenkov and Chrousos 2002; Kitamura et al. 2007 ). In peripheral blood leukocytes and plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs), the induction of interferon antiviral activity by double-stranded RNA (poly I:C) or CpG DNA was substantially inhibited by catecholamines (Collado-Hidalgo et al. 2006 ). In the present study, we found that epinephrine could completely inhibit and norepinephrine could partially, but significantly, inhibit the R-848-induced TNF-a production in RAW264 cells. Furthermore, the b-adrenergic receptor antagonist propranolol greatly attenuated exercise-induced suppression of TNF-a and IFN-a in response to R-848 in mice. Our data for the first time demonstrate the independent role of catecholamines in suppressing cytokine production in response to R-848 after exercise. It is known that catecholamines reduce macrophage production of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-a (Zinyama et al. 2001 ) and type I interferon such as IFN-a/b (Collado-Hidalgo et al. 2006) . We hypothesized that catecholamines contribute to the exhaustive exercise-induced reduction in TNF-a and IFN-a levels following R-848. In an in vitro experiment, following R-848 treatment TNF-a production was significantly inhibited by pre-treatment with epinephrine and norepinephrine. It has been reported that b-adrenergic agonists suppress, and a-adrenergic agonists augment LPS-stimulated TNF-a production and its gene expression (Ignatowski et al. 1996) . Norepinephrine has a high affinity for both aand b-adrenergic receptors, whereas epinephrine has a high affinity for b-adrenergic receptors alone (Woods 2000) . Therefore, the b-adrenergic receptors, which have an affinity for both epinephrine and norepinephrine, may modulate the effects of catecholamines on the exercise-induced changes in TNF-a in response to R-848. In this study, however, R-848 did not stimulate any significant IFN-a production in macrophages in vitro. Recent studies have reported that R-848 could not induce IRF7 and IFN-a production in human macrophages (Heil et al. 2004; Siren et al. 2005) . It remains to be determined which specific cell type is responsible for the increase in plasma IFN-a in response to R-848. Ito et al. (2002) previously reported that R-848 had the capacity to induce IFN-a production from pDCs, but not from CD11c ? myeloid DCs, in human peripheral blood. It is noteworthy that the pDCs constitutively express both b-adrenergic receptors (Goyarts et al. 2008 ) and TLR7 (Ito et al. 2002) . Although it has been reported that exercise induced IL-12 production of DCs in animals (Chiang et al. 2007 ) and that acute exercise induced a rise in circulating DC counts in humans (Ho et al. 2001) , unfortunately, it is not yet known whether the IFN-a production in DCs is induced by exhaustive exercise. At least, we could conclude that exercise-induced catecholamines acting through b-adrenergic receptors can significantly blunt TNF-a and IFN-a productions in response to R-848.",
