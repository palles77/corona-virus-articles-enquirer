However, at this time, there is no drug approved to treat ZIKV infection. Drug repurposing is the promptest way to obtain an effective drug during a global public health emergency such as the spread of Zika virus. In this study, we report a US Food and Drug Admistration-approved drug that is safe for pediatric use. Nitazoxanide and its bioactive metabolite, tizoxanide, have anti-ZIKV potential in vitro, and we identified that they exerts antiviral effect possibly by targeting the viral postattachment step.",

Zika virus can be transmitted by Aedes spp mosquitoes and also through sexual contact, blood transfusion, urine, saliva, and vertically from mother to fetus [1] . Since a large Zika outbreak happened in Brazil in 2014, ZIKV transmission has been reported in more than 60 countries and regions globally. Although 80% of patients infected with ZIKV are asymptomatic [2] , it can lead to fetal microcephaly in pregnant women [3] , and it may increase risk of neurological disorders and myelitis in infected adults [4] . The association between ZIKV infection and testis damage was proved in a mouse model recently, arising the concern between ZIKV infection and infertility in male [5] . To protect the public health, especially to avoid birth defects, it is necessary to find a safe drug that can be taken by mouth (orally) for prophylactic and therapeutic use during an epidemic.",

Nitazoxanide reduced infectious ZIKV particles by >100-fold at 10 \u03bcM, whereas tizoxanide completely abolished supernatant ZIKV proliferation at 10 \u03bcM. This inhibition was further demonstrated by immunofluorescence assay detecting the envelope protein expression ( Figure 1A ) and by Western bot detecting the ZIKV capsid protein ( Figure 1B) . No cytotoxicity was observed for these 2 drugs under assay concentrations ( Figure 1C ). We further investigated the kinetics of ZIKV propagation in the presence of these 2 drugs (Supplementary Figure 2) , and obvious inhibition was observed. In addition, both drugs inhibited intracellular ZIKV RNA production in a dose-dependent manner under different multiplicity of infections (MOIs) (Supplementary Figure 3) . To verify whether nitazoxanide and tizoxanide could inhibit ZIKV in human-derived cells, we performed antiviral experiments in A549 cells, and we found that both drugs could inhibit ZIKV infection in a dose-dependent manner under nontoxic doses ( Figure 1D , toxicity data not shown).",

At 4\u00b0C, the viral particles can physically bind to the cell surface without endocytosis, which occurs most efficiently at 37\u00b0C. After washing to remove the unadsorbed ZIKV, the cells were harvested for ZIKV RNA detection. Our results showed that these 2 drugs did not inhibit the attachment of ZIKV to the cells.",

In addition, we have performed a time-of-addition experiment using a high MOI. As shown in Figure 2D , addition of the compounds at 24 hours after the ZIKV infection at a MOI of 2 still potently inhibits virus infection, strongly suggesting that the drugs are capable of inhibiting established ZIKV infection, likely at a step of virus genome replication. A (H7N9). It is also reported to inhibit the replication of a broad range of other RNA and DNA viruses including respiratory syncytial virus, parainfluenza, coronavirus, rotavirus, norovirus, hepatitis B, hepatitis C, dengue, yellow fever, Japanese encephalitis virus, and human immunodeficiency virus [12] . Clinical trials have indicated its potential role in treating rotavirus and norovirus gastroenteritis, chronic hepatitis B, chronic hepatitis C, and influenza. It is suggested that nitazoxanide may inhibit virus infection by regulating the host responses [9] . The specific mechanism may be associated with its depleting intracellular Ca 2+ stores [13] . Thiazolides were also reported to inhibit the replication of H1N1 and different other strains of influenza A virus by selectively blocking the maturation of the viral hemagglutinin at a stage preceding resistance to endoglycosidase H digestion [14] . Our results indicate that nitazoxanide inhibits ZIKV infection by targeting the postattachment step, most likely virus genome replication. Perhaps, it also inhibits ZIKV replication by depleting intracellular Ca 2+ stores like bovine viral diarrhoea virus; however, novel mechanisms cannot be excluded in this setting, and further investigation needs to be performed.",

Luckily, nitazoxanide might be the unique drug that meets these criteria to date. It is an orally taken and pregnancy category B drug approved for adults and children above 1-year-old. The C max of plasma tizoxanide and tizoxanide glucuronide are 10. 6 \u03bcg/mL and 10.5 \u03bcg/mL, respectively, by oral administration of tablet [15] , which is a much higher than the concentration required to completely clear the virus in vitro (10 \u03bcM, 3.07 \u03bcg/mL for tizoxanide). Cytotoxicity to Vero cells was not observed at 10 \u03bcM for both drugs ( Figure 1C ). The in vitro anti-ZIKV activity of nitazoxanide does not seem as high as that recently reported for niclosamide [6] ; however, niclosamide is only marginally absorbed into blood stream after oral administration. In consideration of multidisciplinary factors, nitazoxanide may be a better anti-ZIKV drug that is worth immediate clinical research.",
