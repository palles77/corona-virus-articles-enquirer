Despite the use of highly active anti-retroviral therapy (HAART) that has reduced the incidence of KS, the disease remains the most common malignancy in patients with AIDS in developed countries [3] . Current anti-herpesvirus drugs, such as ganciclovir, cidofovir, and foscarnet, target DNA polymerase that are expressed during the late lytic phase of KSHV replication and have limited benefits against either KS or PEL [4, 5] . Specific anti-KSHV drugs are still much-needed for the treatment of KSHV-associated malignancies. In this study, peptideconjugated phosphorodiamidate morpholino oligomers (PPMOs) were explored to inhibit expression of KSHV early lytic genes and to suppress engraftment of PEL cells in mice with non-obese diabetic/severe combined immunodeficiency disease (NOD/SCID).",

Like other herpesviruses, KSHV displays a tightly regulated program of gene expression using two modes of infection: latent and lytic. The reactivation of KSHV lytic replication in PEL cells can be induced by chemicals, such as tetradecanoyl phorbol acetate (TPA) [15] . Lytic replication can be divided into immediate-early, early, and late stages, based on the expression time of viral genes after activation of lytic cycle. Two of the KSHV early lytic genes, viral interferon regulatory factor 1 (vIRF-1) and viral interleukin 6 (vIL-6), are among those that have been implicated in the pathogenesis of KSHV-associated malignant diseases.",

The vIRF-1 interacts with IRF-1, IRF-3, p53, and CBP/p300 proteins to inhibit type I/II human interferon (IFN) signaling and leads to transformation of NIH3T3 cells, as well as induction of tumors in nude mice [16] [17] [18] [19] . The IRF family members are transcription regulatory factors that bind to interferon-stimulated response elements (ISRE) to regulate interferon-responsive genes involved in pathogen response, cytokine signaling, cell growth regulation, and hematopoietic development [20] . The vIRF-1 protein directly interacts with these DNA binding proteins to interfere with their functions [21, 22] . vIRF-1 inhibits ATM/p53 signal transduction pathway by down-regulating the p53 total protein level [23] . These results suggest that vIRF-1 is an oncogenic protein and can potentially contribute to KSHV-driven malignancies.",

We speculated that the reduction of KSHV lytic replication might be a result of alleviation of vIRF-1 inhibition on cellular IFN signaling pathway. Our data on elevation of IRF-3 and STAT1 in KP1-treated cells also supports this speculation. BCBL-1 cells, after vIRF-1 inhibition, had higher levels of IRF-3 and STAT1, which play an important role in IFNsignaling and antiviral response.

Average ratio of BCBL-1 cells in peritoneal lavage of PPMO-treated SCID mice analyzed by flow cytometry. The percentage of BCBL-1 cells among total cells from peritoneal lavage of each mouse was used to calculate the average ratio in each group. A. Samples were collected at week 3 after BCBL-1 delivery. B. Samples collected at week 9 after BCBL-1 delivery. Dead mice were not counted in calculation of the average ratio of BCBL-1 cells in each group. Error bars represent variations among the five mice in each group. Significant differences between groups of ILP1 and CP1 are denoted by \"*\", which indicates P < 0.01. Survival curve of PPMO-treated SCID mice that were engrafted with BCBL-1 cells. One mouse in mock-treatment group (filled diamond), one mouse in CP1 group (cross out), and 2 mice in KP1+KP2 group (filled square) died before or during week 8. All five mice in ILP1 group (filled triangle) and one mouse in KP1+KP2 group were still healthy by week 17. All other mice were euthanized in week 11 due to poor health conditions. Observation ended at week 17. ",
