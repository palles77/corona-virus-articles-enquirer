The common pathogenic microorganisms include plasmodium, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), Escherichia coli (E. coli), Salmonella typhi, and so on. Each year they have caused great harm to the health of humans, animals and plants, leading to huge economic losses [1] . Therefore, it is highly desirable to develop a rapid, sensitive and low cost detection method to monitor and control their spread in food and environment. The traditional methods for detection of pathogenic microorganism in the sample demand several steps, in which include isolating and culturing, and a series of complicated biochemical tests [2] . Although the detection method is of high sensitivity and specificity, it cannot be applied to the fast on-site testing because it requires a long time (usually 5 to 7 d). In recent years, the biosensor as a rapid, sensitive, highly specific, low-cost detection technique has been widely used for the detection of pathogenic microorganism [3] . Biosensors convert the biological information produced by specific binding of bio-recognition elements and pathogenic microorganisms into physical signal output (like electrical, optical, and so on) to achieve the purpose of analysis/detection [4] . Antibodies most frequently used are the bio-recognition elements with the advantages of high affinity and high specificity in biosensors. However, the antibodies suffer from several drawbacks, such as requirement of a series of cumbersome and complex selection process, expensive, easy to degenerate and high environmental requirements for detection [5] . Therefore, new bio-recognition elements for detection of pathogenic microorganisms with high specificity and overcoming the shortcomings of antibodies are still needed to explore.",

The selection SELEX cycle generally need 2 to 3 months, the fastest is just 2 weeks, while preparation of monoclonal antibody is at least 3 to 6 months and expensive; (2) Aptamers are chemically synthesized, thus it can be modified flexibly with a variety of groups; (3) Antibodies are proteins that are easy to degenerate. The instability of traditional immunosensor limit its application scope, but the aptamers have chemical stability in the pH range of 2 to 12, and have a certain thermal refolding; (4) The composition of aptamers is simple, generally has a few dozen nucleotides (less than 100 nt), and thus the design of the aptamers is relatively simple.

In recent years, more and more aptamers screening method for pathogenic microorganisms have used the whole cells as targets. However, this method is often difficult to screen the aptamers with high specificity due to the complex target sites. To solve this problem, the counter-selection cycle involves the incubation of a closely related cell or microorganism with the random nucleotide library to eliminate the sequences that are non-specific to the target [15, 17] . Cao et al [15] used Staphylococcus aureus as the targets, and used Streptococcus and Staphylococcus epidermidis for counter-selection to improve the specificity of aptamers. After several cycles, they obtained a group of 11 sequences of specific aptamers for S. aureus, which shows higher specificity than that of a single aptamer.

Good separation methods can effectively reduce the number of screening cycles and improve the specificity and affinity of screening aptamers. As the targets (proteins or whole cells) are biological macromolecules, commonly separation methods are filtering [8] , centrifugation [17] , magnetic beads separation. Although the above methods can remove the unbound oligonucleotides, they cannot get the affinity information between target-binding sequences and the pathogenic microorganisms, which need the followed testing process. Currently, a lot of new separation technologies such as capillary electrophoresis [19] , surface plasmon resonance (SPR [20, 21] and flow cytometry, have been gradually used to separate target-binding sequences from non-specific oligonucleotides. These methods can not only remove the unbound oligonucleotides but also simultaneously evaluate the affinity of target-binding sequences and pathogenic microorganisms, which make the aptamer selection process relatively easier. The working principle of capillary electrophoresis is that the different charge-mass ratio between different components can result in the electrophoretic mobility differences. When the affinity between aptamers and targets is strong enough to form stable complex, relevant electrophoretic peaks for free oligonucleotides and the complex would be obtained in a suitable separation and detection condition [22] . The capillary electrophoresis has a great potential in this area owing to its advantages of rapidity, high resolution, simple operation, small amount of sample and low cost. In addition to capillary electrophoresis, SPR and flow cytometry have also been applied for aptamer screening. These methods not only efficiently separate the target-binding sequences but also simultaneously measure affinity information between targets and target-binding sequences, which simplify the steps in SELEX and are of great significance in the field of aptamer selection 3 Aptamers for pathogenic microorganisms 3 ",

Three kinds of aptamers of HIV were selected by using three different kinds of surface proteins of HIV as targets, including structural proteins RT (p50 reverse transcriptase) [13] , structural protein gp120 [20] , regulatory proteins Tat [24] , respectively. The hepatitis virus that can cause viral hepatitis is another kind virus for aptamer screening. Fukuda and Biroccio respectively used non-structural protein NS3 [26] and NS5 [28] of hepatitis C virus (HCV) as the targets to select aptamers of HCV. Influenza virus is a kind of easy pandemic virus. Gopinath et al [17] reported another aptamer selection process of another influenza A virus (H3N2). They used the whole-cell of H3N2 as targets to obtain the aptamers that specifically bound the HA protein on the surface of H3N2.

Zhen et al. used Bacillus anthracis spores as the targets for aptamer screening and get 79 sequences from 13 different classes of DNA aptamers by 18 cycles [36] . E. coli is the main bacteria in human and animal gut, in which some specific serotypes are pathogenic for humans and animals, especially for infants and young animals (birds). In recent years, the E. coli aptamer selection has also been increasingly reported. Bruno used E. coli O111:B4 endotoxin LPS as targets for selecting specific aptamers of E. coli O111:B4 [35] . Subsequently, the group also used E. coli 8739 outer membrane protein as targets and obtained 25 sequences of aptamers of E. coli 8739 [33] . In addition, the aptamers of other types of E. coli (E. coli DH 5\u012e [32] , E. coli k88 [34] ) have also been reported. Salmonella is the main foodborne bacteria and there is also some reports about its aptamers screening [38, 39] . 4 Aptasensors for microbial detection",

This is because that the interaction of pathogenic microorganisms and bio-recognition elements cannot produce the electrochemical signal, so it needs to use markers for detecting potential changes. While Zelada-Guillen et al [45, 46] developed a labelfree potentiometric sensor for detecting Salmonella typhi through using strong charge transfer capability of single-walled carbon nanotubes. A layer of the single-walled carbon nanotubes was modified on the electrode surface, and then the aptamers were immobilized on the surface of carbon nanotubes through self-assembled monolayer. When Salmonella typhi bound with aptamers, it led to conformational change of aptamers. Conformational change of aptamers removed the phosphate on the surface of carbon nanotubes, which caused the potential changes on the surface of the electrode. The biosensor can be used to detect Salmonella typhi at the concentration range of 0.2-10 3 cfu mL -1 [45] . The method has also been used to detect E. coli CECT 675 with the detection limits of 6 cfu mL -1 and 26 cfu mL -1 in milk and apple juice, respectively [46] .",

FETs aptasensor is based on the principle that the interaction of the aptamers immobilized on FETs and the target results in the changes of the distribution of charge on the FETs. Figure 2A is a typical scheme of FETs aptasensor. In comparison with antibodies, aptamers have the considerable advantages in fabrication of FETs aptasensors: (1) The size of aptamers is smaller (about 1 to 2 nm). The binding of the target to the aptamers occurs in the electrical double-layer, thus the resulting change of the charge distribution can be easily detected; (2) their small sizes and versatility allow efficient immobilization at high density on the FETs surface, thereby enhance the sensor sensitivity. So et al [32] developed single-walled carbon nanotubes (CNT)-EFTs aptasensor for the detection of E. coli. The aptamers were immobilized on the surface of CNT. When bound with the aptamers, the E. coli has shielding effect on the negative charge of the aptamers, which led to significantly decrease of conductance.",

As shown in Fig.2D ), QCM aptamer sensor is based on the principle that aptamers are immobilized on the quartz crystal, and when the load increases, the oscillation frequency of the chip would reduce under the external electric field, which is related to the mass adsorbed on the chip [62] . Minunni et al. used the QCM sensor to detect the Tat protein of AIDS virus HIV-1. The RNA aptamers of HIV-1 Tat protein were immobilized on the QCM gold electrode surface by self-assembly method and biotin-streptavidin linker to detect HIV-1 Tat protein with a detection limit of 0.25 mg L -1 . The three proteins of BCL-2, hIgG, and HIV Rev were used to confirm the specificity. The result showed that the biosensor had a good specificity for the detection of HIV-1 Tat protein.",

However, compared to wide variety kinds of antibodies, the types of aptamers for different pathogenic microorganisms are limited, which limits the development of the aptasensors for detection of pathogenic microorganisms. So it is necessary to develop more efficient screening methods for aptamers of different types of pathogenic microorganisms to screen out the high-affinity and high specificity of aptamers. Here, according to the development status of current aptasensors for detection of pathogenic microorganisms, we summed up the following trend of the aptasensors. ",
