This domain has previously been shown to require both zinc and calcium ions for optimal activity. In the present study we carried out metal-binding and conformational experiments on a purified cysteine-rich minidomain of the RUBV NS protease containing the putative Zn 2+ -binding ligands. This minidomain bound to Zn 2+ with a stoichiometry of \u22480.7 and an apparent dissociation constant of < 500 nM. Fluorescence quenching and 8anilinonaphthalene-1-sulfonic acid fluorescence methods revealed that Zn 2+ binding resulted in conformational changes characterized by shielding of hydrophobic regions from the solvent. Mutational analyses using the minidomain identified residues Cys 1175 , Cys 1178 , Cys 1225 and Cys 1227 were required for the binding of Zn 2+ . Corresponding mutational analyses using a RUBV replicon confirmed that these residues were necessary for both proteolytic activity of the NS protease and viability. The present study demonstrates that the CXXC(X) 48 CXC Zn 2+ -binding motif in the RUBV NS protease is critical for maintaining the structural integrity of the protease domain and essential for proteolysis and virus replication.",

            "text": "INTRODUCTION RUBV (rubella virus), an important human pathogen causing German measles, is a simple, plus-strand RNA virus that is the sole member of the genus Rubivirus in the Togaviridae family of animal viruses. The RUBV genome encodes five proteins which are expressed from two ORFs (open reading frames): the two proteins involved in viral RNA replication that are translated from one [termed the 'NS (non-structural) protein' or 'NS-ORF'] and the three structural proteins that form the virus particle from the second. Proteolysis is a common feature in expression of the proteins from both ORFs, as the primary translation product of the NS-ORF is cleaved into its two component proteins by a protease embedded in one of these proteins, whereas the structural-protein ORF translation product is processed co-translationally by the cellular enzyme signalase. The two replicase proteins, P150 and P90, are situated at the N-and C-terminal ends of the NS-ORF precursor respectively, and the embedded NS protease is at the C-terminus of P150 immediately upstream from the cleavage site. Other than cleaving the NS-ORF precursor, the NS protease has no known cellular targets [1] .",

We recently showed that the NS protease contains a linear EF-hand Ca 2+ -binding motif that plays a structural role in stabilizing the protease at physiological temperatures [3] . To our knowledge, this is the only example of Ca 2+ playing such a role in a viral protease. We also showed that Zn 2+ is required for optimal proteolytic activity [4, 5] . However, the exact Zn 2+binding ligands and the role Zn 2+ plays in protease activity have yet to be identified. On the basis of our model structure of the RUBV NS protease, a cluster of cysteine residues (Cys 1167 , Cys 1175 , Cys 1178 , Cys 1225 and Cys 1227 ) are arranged in close proximity in space and could potentially form a Zn 2+ -binding pocket. Structural Zn 2+ -binding sites are generally co-ordinated by four cysteine residues and histidine residues as ligands, although there are no histidine residues nearby in this cysteine cluster. In the present study we expressed and purified a minimal metal-binding domain from the NS protease, RUBCa (comprising amino acids 1143-1252 of P150), which contains the EF-hand Ca 2+ -binding loop as well as all of the putative cysteine residues involved in Zn 2+ binding. We used the well-folded RUBCa minidomain to study Zn 2+ binding and the resulting changes in minidomain structure with various spectroscopic methods and, furthermore, took a sitedirected-mutagenesis approach to identify the ligands involved in Zn 2+ binding. Mutants were also introduced into a RUBV infectious cDNA replicon to correlate Zn 2+ binding with NS protease activity and viability.",

On the basis of its primary-and secondary-structure similarity (see Supplementary Figure 3 ) to the well-characterized leader protease of FMDV (PDB code 1qmy), we built a model structure for the RUBV NS protease by homology modelling [3] .

Although MBP itself did not bind Zn 2+ , we were not able to rule out the possibility that an artificial Zn 2+ binding pocket might be formed by residues from both the MBP tag and the RUBV NS protease domain. In addition, the 65 Zn 2+ blotting does not provide quantitative estimation of Zn 2+ binding constants. With the tagless RUBCa minidomain in hand, we were able to confirm that the protease domain itself bound Zn 2+ . The purified minidomain was first subjected to metal-element screening by using ICP-MS, which revealed that it bound 0.6 mol of zinc and 0.7 mol of calcium ion per mol of protein simultaneously. The amount of minidomain-bound Zn 2+ was further confirmed with an independent colorimetric assay. In this latter assay, after purifying the RUBCa minidomain and removing background metal ions with Chelex 100 resin, the Zn 2+ content was determined with the metal indicator PAR, which detects protein-bound Zn 2+ released by protease K digestion. The released Zn 2+ forms a Zn-(PAR) 2 complex accompanied by a large increase in intensity at 500 nm (\u0394\u03b5=6.6\u00d710 4 M \u22121 \u00b7 cm \u22121 at pH 7.0) within 3 ms [15] (see Supplementary Figure 2 ). The amount of RUBCa-bound Zn 2+ ions ([Zn 2+ ]/[P]) was found to be 0.69\u00b10.03. Thus the bacterially expressed cysteine-rich RUBCa minidomain from the RUB NS protease was capable of binding Zn 2+ ions by itself.",

The RUBCa minidomain contains three aromatic tryptophan residues, one of which, Trp 1231 , is in close proximity (\u2248 5 \u00c5) to the proposed cysteine-rich zinc-binding pocket ( Figure 1B ). In comparison with fully exposed tryptophan (as seen in L-tryptophan solution) or highly buried tryptophan residues [as seen in domain 1 of the cell-adhesion molecule CD2 (cluster of differentiation 2)], the tryptophan residues in RUBCa were relatively well protected ( Figure 2 and Table 1 ), indicating the structural integrity of the minidomain. Since aromatic residues are highly sensitive to local or global conformational changes, we took advantage of this feature to probe Zn 2+ -induced conformational changes by monitoring intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence. As shown in Figure 3 (A), with the gradual addition of Zn 2+ ions to the minidomain, the emission maximum blue-shifted from 339 nm to 335 nm with a concomitant increase of fluorescence intensity by at least 15%, indicating that Zn 2+ ions caused conformational changes and led to the shielding of aromatic residues from the solvent.",

Upon transfection of in vitro replicon transcripts into Vero culture cells, the transcripts were translated to produce the NS-ORF precursor which is proteolytically cleaved if it contains a functional NS protease. Cleavage is detected through the presence of an HA epitope tag in P150 by Western blotting using anti-HA antibodies [3, 6] . As shown in Figure 4 (B), NS protease cleavage of the precursor (termed P200) to P150 was efficient in WT RUBrep-HA transfected cells as well as in RUBrep-HA/GFP-C1167S transfected cells (the other cleavage product, P90, was not detected by anti-HA antibodies). Vero cells transfected with RUBrep-HA/GFP constructs with single cysteine-toserine mutations at positions 1175, 1178, 1225, 1227, similar to the construct with a C1152S substitution at the catalytic site that served as the negative control, were unable to undertake cleavage (that is, only the P200 precursor was detected). In addition, cleavage in Vero cells transfected with RUBrep-HA/GFP constructs with combined cysteine-to-serine mutations (C 1167 S/C 1178 S, C 1175 S/C 1178 S, the treble mutant, C 1225 S/C 1227 S and the quintuple mutant) was abolished ( Figure 4B ). These findings correlated exactly with the effects of these mutations on Zn 2+ binding in that mutants unable to bind Zn 2+ lacked protease activity, whereas the Cys 1167 mutant able to bind Zn 2+ exhibited protease activity.",

The requirement for both Ca 2+ and Zn 2+ as cofactors in a protease is reminiscent of thermolysin, a thermostable metalloprotease produced by the Gram-positive bacteria Bacillus thermoproteolyticus. The only bound Zn 2+ in thermolysin is directly involved in the enzymatic activity, whereas the binding of four Ca 2+ ions is required for thermostability [29, 30] . In the present study we showed that the minidomain is well folded in the absence of Zn 2+ , which is different from the siutation in zinc-finger proteins, which require Zn 2+ binding for folding. Our conformational analyses clearly demonstrate that the bound Zn 2+ plays a structural role by maintaining structural integrity and shielding some hydrophobic regions from bulk solvent. Site mutagenesis of the putative Zn 2+ -binding ligands identified Cys 1175 ,Cys 1178 ,Cys 1225 and Cys 1227 , but not Cys 1167 , as co-ordinating ligands, and this corresponds exactly to protease activity in vivo, which requires the four earlier cited residues, but not C 1167 .",

            "text": "The discrepancy with these previously obtained results could arise for several reasons. First, in our previous studies [3] , the expressed NS protease regions were never successfully separated from the MBP tag, and thus we could not unambiguously rule out the contribution of Zn 2+ binding by the fusion tag. Additionally, identification of Zn 2+ -binding ligands was done using site-directed mutagenesis and a 65 Zn 2+ blotting assay in which the MBP-NS protease region fusions were not in solution (although subjected to renaturing conditions following blotting). It should also be noted that binding using the 65 Zn 2+ binding assay was assessed as 'all or none' by visual inspection, whereas the quantitative PAR assay used in the present study revealed that the decrease in Zn 2+ binding exhibited by the single mutants was in the range of 50-65%, potentially leading to a false negative result (that is, identifying a mutant as retaining Zn 2+ binding when it did not). Thirdly, the in vitro coupled transcription-translation assay was carried out under aerobic, non-reducing conditions that may not truly reflect the reducing environment of cell-based assays. Given the high numbers of cysteine residues in the NS protease (six in the less-than-100-amino acids region between residues 1152 and 1227), a reducing environment is more favourable for Zn 2+ binding and protein folding by preventing formation of mismatched disulfide bonds. It is to be noted that, in the in vitro assay, cleavage of the P200 precursor was only partially complete, whereas, in the in vivo assay, cleavage was nearly complete. Given this, we consider that cell-based assay carried out in the preset study is more reliable than the in vitro assay.",

            "text": "In summary, site-directed mutagenesis analyses carried out on the bacterially expressed minidomain within the RUBV NS protease have defined a CXXC(X) 48 CXC Zn 2+ -binding motif that is required for protease activity. On the basis of conformational studies on the minidomain, Zn 2+ plays a structural role in protease activity. Given the necessity of post-translational processing of the P200 precursor by this protease in the formation of replication complexes, it is not surprising to find that mutation of any of these residues impairs replication of a RUBV replicon. Interestingly, a nearby cysteine residue, Cys 1167 , is necessary neither for Zn 2+ binding nor protease activity, but is still required for replication. Tetrahedral Zn 2+ binding sites have been found that play structural roles in a number of other proteases of positive-sense RNA viruses [31] [32] [33] , and the requirement of Zn 2+ ion as a structural cofactor in these proteases is not a rare scenario. The spacing of the ligand residues of the RUBV NS protease Zn 2+ -binding site CXXC(X) 48 CXC is reminiscent of the CXXC(X) 31 CXC spacing of Zn 2+ -binding ligands in the PLpro (papain-like protease) of SARS-CoV [33, 34] . Mutational analyses have revealed that the four cysteines in SARS-CoV involved in the binding of Zn 2+ are also crucial for the proteolytic activity of PLpro. The crystal structure of SARS-CoV PLpro further confirms the mutational analyses and reveals that the Zn 2+ ion is co-ordinated with four cysteine residues residing on two \u03b2hairpins by adopting a tetrahedral geometry [34] . The four cysteine residues are located at or close to the termini of anti-parallel \u03b2-strands. Similar to the Zn 2+ -binding site in SARS-CoV PLpro, our results suggest that the Zn 2+ -binding site in the protease domain of RUBV are also formed by four cysteine residues. However, the four cysteine residues in RUBV protease are flanked by helices instead of \u03b2-strands. By fixing the backbone atoms and allowing free rotation of sulfur atoms on side chain in our model structure of the RUBV protease domain, the minimal distance between two sulfur atoms of proposed cysteine ligands falls into the range of 3.5-6.0 \u00c5, which is in good agreement with the average value of 4.0 \u00c5 in SARS-CoV PLpro. Further structural determination of the RUBV protease domain will unambiguously reveal the detailed co-ordination properties of Zn 2+ -binding pocket of RUBV protease.",
