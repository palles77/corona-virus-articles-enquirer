We identified recent refugees and asylum seekers < 18 years of age admitted to the University Children's Hospital in Basel, Switzerland, in 2015. A retrospective analysis was performed using electronic patient records. We identified 105 admissions in 93 patients with a median age of 5.7 (IQR 2.6-14.5) years. Eritrea, Syria, and Afghanistan were the most frequent countries of origin. The median duration of admission was 4 (IQR 2-6) days with infections and elective surgical interventions being the most common reason (54.8 and 16.1%, respectively). Most infections were airway, skin, and gastrointestinal in 46.4, 20.2, and 11.9%, respectively. The prevalence of tropical infections was 11.9%. The main pathogens identified were influenza A virus (13.8%), Staphylococcus aureus (10.3%), and rhino/ enterovirus (10.3%). Previous medical non-infectious conditions were recorded in 13%.",

Syria had become the largest source country, followed by Afghanistan and Somalia, together accounting for 54% of the global number of refugees and asylum seekers. These people were hosted mostly by neighboring countries like Turkey, Lebanon, and Jordan and only a fraction of them continued their way to Europe [24] . In 2015, approximately one million asylum seekers arrived by sea of which most (around 84%) landed in Greece, trying to subsequently make their way across the central and eastern Mediterranean routes to Western Europe, where Switzerland is one of the primary destination countries [7, [22] [23] [24] .",

Most of the existing studies in the European Region focused on maternity and mental health and are limited by inconsistent definitions of refugees and asylum seekers [3] . Refugee and asylum-seeking children are at particular health risk, highlighted by data collected in 2015 in Croatia by M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res, showing that 25% of refugees and asylum seekers requiring medical services were under 5 years of age [4, 5] . Studies from Germany, Netherlands, and Switzerland showed that refugee and asylum-seeking children had higher rates of emergency room presentations and admissions, higher rates of infections like tuberculosis and intestinal parasites, and lower rates of vaccine coverage [11-13, 16, 19] . However, health data on asylum seekers and refugees in the European Region, particularly in pediatric populations, is very limited. A review performed in 2012 on the health of migrant children in Switzerland confirms that the literature on this topic is scarce [8] .",

Amongst the group of medical reasons, acute infections were the most frequent reason of presentations (44%) [15] . Unlike other studies, we noticed a relatively low prevalence of tropical diseases with only a few cases of malaria and no intestinal parasitic infections [12, 13, 16, 17] . All cases of malaria originated from Eritrea which was the most frequent country of origin with endemic malaria in our population. Although malaria admission rates in Eritrea declined by over 75% between 2000 and 2014, neighboring Germany detected a sharp increase of Plasmodium vivax malaria in Eritrean migrants between 2014 and 2015 [20, 26] . The reason why we did not find any parasitic intestinal infections may have been the absence of routine screening procedures. Similarly, other screening tests for infections including schistosomiasis, HIV, and hepatitis B and C were not routinely performed but only if a clinical suspicion was present. Furthermore, it is likely that a certain selection of patients occurs in the refugee's home country upon departure and during transit. Families with limited resources who can only afford to pay for one family member's journey conceivably will select the healthiest individual with the highest chances to survive the journey.",

Only a small proportion of patients received immunizations during their admission. Likely explanations include that the clinicians deemed immunizations to be deferred to a later time point in individuals admitted for infectious reasons and the fact that in Switzerland immunizations are usually performed by the primary health care provider. Importantly, the possibility of starting catch-up immunizations was commonly missed by the treating team. The dense and difficult living conditions of asylum seekers increase the risk of transmission of highly contagious diseases, which may explain why the proportion of admissions due to influenza virus in our study was high. National recommendations for influenza vaccinations in children aim at individuals at risk: children with chronic diseases, pregnant women, or premature infants. Children that have close contact to individuals at risk or infants younger than 6 months are also advised to be immunized; however, health insurance only covers costs for the individuals at risk, and therefore, the majority of refugee and asylum-seeking children and adolescent remain unimmunized [6] .",
