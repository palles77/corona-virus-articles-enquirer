Relatively increased positive percentage in Fever Clinics suggested that the fever associated clinical symptoms were linked with viral NAT, at some degree. Interestingly, total positive percentage were associated with gender and age, while positive percentage in Fever Clinics was only associated with age, not gender. Therefore, consistent with other reports, we could conclude that for suspect SARS-CoV-2 infection, positive percentage would be higher in Male and Old, but in Fever Clinics, gender was not a risk factor.",

During the early Feb, the need of detect increased dramatically up to 10 thousands of samples per day in Wuhan City. But to what extend was this RT-PCR based viral nucleic acid test (NAT) could reflect the real SARS-CoV-2 infection? Therefore in this study, we retrospectively analysed NAT test of 4880 cases from Jan 22 to Feb 14, 2020 in Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University. All the cases were suspected of SARS-CoV-2 infection because of, 1) typical respiratory infection symptoms such as fever, cough and dyspnoea, or 2) close contact with a COVID-19 patient. RT-PCR were performed to detect ORF1ab and NP genes fragments from respiratory specimens, including nasal and pharyngeal swabs (NPS), bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BLF) and sputum.",
