            "text": "Background: Timely identification of respiratory virus infection is essential to mitigate inappropriate antibiotic use and to implement appropriate treatment and/or infection control procedures. As such, multiplexed PCR assays have become standard in many virology laboratories. Objectives: To compare the Seeplex RV15 (test of record) with two newer generation multiplex assays, the Anyplex II RV16 and the xTAG respiratory virus panels. Study design: Two hundred and three retrospective and 36 prospective respiratory samples were tested by all three assays. Samples were deemed to be positive if they tested positive for a virus by at least two of the three respective assays. Negative samples also had to test negative by at least two of the three assays. Inconclusive samples were those that showed band signal intensity between 0 and 100 on the RV15, but had not been previously tested on the RV16 or xTAG. Results and conclusions: Overall sensitivity and specificity of all three assays were similar (\u223c85% and 100%, respectively). Given each assay can identify multiple different viruses, the targets reported by one assay did not always agree with each target from another assay. Partial discordant rates were 47% and 21% for positive and negative samples, respectively. These higher than expected partial discordant rates may be due to primer or chemistry differences amongst the three multiplex assays.",

Early identification of respiratory pathogens permits rapid implementation of appropriate infection control precautions, decreased antibiotic use and where appropriate, initiation of antiviral therapies (Barenfanger et al., 2000; Heinonen et al., 2011) . Traditional laboratory methods such as viral culture and direct fluorescent-antibody testing are time consuming and lack sensitivity, and are no longer the method of choice (Gharabaghi et al., 2011; She et al., 2010) . Currently, molecular methods are now standard and are employed in most virology laboratories. Multiplexed assays have enabled the detection of several viral targets and permit the simultaneous identification of co-infections in patient specimens (Esper et al., 2011) . There are currently several multiplex assays available commercially. Three such Health Canada approved assays include the Seeplex RV15 ACE Detection Kit (RV15) (Seegene, South Korea), the Anyplex II RV16 (RV16) (Seegene, South Korea) and the xTAG Respiratory Viral Panel (xTAG) (Luminex, United States)",

As the RV15 is an earlier generation assay, one may have expected it to perform less effectively than its comparators in this study. In addition to this, the effect of a freeze-thaw cycle on samples done on the RV16 and xTag for virus detection and accuracy was not analyzed and is a limitation of this study. Sample input among the three assays also varied, with an input of 400 \u03bcL for xTAG and 700 \u03bcL for RV15 and RV16 respectively. There were no issues identified between the assays using the MS2 internal controls, and based on the results obtained from this study, alterations in sample input do not affect sensitivity of the assays. However, a lower sample input may be beneficial if patient sample volumes are limited. In this respect the xTAG assay may be more favorable. The discordancy rates amongst positive samples were high (47%). This may reflect preferential chemistry or primer sets to virus-type matching in one of the assays versus another. Upon closer inspection of the data, one can see variation between the different assays with respect to certain virus type sensitivities. A limitation of this evaluation to further investigate these differences is that sequencing and monoplex PCR testing was not conducted on discordant samples. In addition, conventional methods such as cell culture or direct fluorescence antibody testing were not performed.",

Ultimately, the ease of use, time to completion and cost of consumable materials will dictate which test methodology is preferable. Following this study, the RV16 replaced the RV15 in house, as the RV16 did not have any inconclusive results. There are however also many other commercial multiplex assays on the market. Some examples include FTD Respiratory (Fast-track diagnostics), EP Respiratory (Ausdiagnostics), FilmArray Respiratory Panel (Biofire Diagnostics/Biomerieux), Verigene \u00ae RV test (Nanosphere) and Prodesse Respiratory assay (Hologic/Gen-Probe) that have in-vitro diagnostic (IVD) indications by various licensing bodies (i.e. FDA, Health Canada, CE). Choosing an assay may be influenced by which jurisdiction it has approval for IVD. In conclusion, the RV16 was implemented in the laboratory because the inconclusive results previously obtained by the RV15 were resolved with the RV16 next generation platform. The RV16 platform also improved workflow compared to the RV15 gel-based detection to RT-PCR, which was deemed easier to interpret. ",
