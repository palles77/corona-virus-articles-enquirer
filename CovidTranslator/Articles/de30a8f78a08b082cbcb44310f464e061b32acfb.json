            "text": "The Lansing strain of poliovirus type 2 is a mouse-adapted virus that induces a fatal paralytic disease in mice after intracerebral inoculation. Our previous results indicated that the mouse-adapted phenotype maps to the Lansing viral capsid. To further define regions of the capsid that are specifically involved in the infection of mice, antigenic variants resistant to neutralization with monoclonal antibodies were selected, and their mouse neurovirulence was studied. The monoclonal antibodies used were directed against antigenic site 1, an immunodominant loop of capsid polypeptide VP1 located on the virion surface. Ten of twenty-two variants selected had lower intracerebral neurovirulence in mice when compared to the parental virus. Four of the ten antigenic variants with reduced neurovirulence were temperature sensitive (ts) for replication in HeLa cells, while the remaining six variants replicated in HeLa cells as well as the parent virus. Two ts+ variants that were studied had a reduced ability to replicate in the mouse brain. There was no difference in the histopathology and pattern of involvement in the central nervous system of one variant compared to the parent virus. In three variants, reduction of neurovirulence correlated with specific amino acid substitutions at positions 100 and 101 of VP1 , located within antigenic site 1. The ts phenotype in three variants was associated with a single amino acid deletion at position 105. Virus recovered from the brain of paralyzed mice that had been inoculated with the antigenic variants was characterized to identify the virus causing disease. In most cases, brain isolates resembled the inoculated virus in neurovirulence and amino acid sequence at the antigenic site. Virus recovered from brains of paralyzed mice that had been inoculated with the ts variants was either ts+ or cold sensitive, and had become more neurovirulent.",

In contrast, mice inoculated with the Pl/Mahoney strain of poliovirus do not develop disease (La Monica et al., 1986) . Viral recombinants between P2/ Lansing and Pi/Mahoney, constructed by manipulating cloned, infectious viral cDNAs, were used to show that the mouse-adapted phenotype of P2/Lansing maps to the viral capsid proteins (La Monica et al., 1986) .

Although the highest LDSO value observed with unselected P2/Lansing was 5.0 loglo PFU, many of the marvariants had an LDSO of 6.0 loglo and higher. We considered any virus with an LDSO of 6.0 loglo PFU or higher of significantly reduced neurovirulence. Not all of the mar variants had reduced neurovirulence; for example, variants 433Rl .l and 433R3.1 are clearly as neurovirulent as the parent virus. At least 10 other mar variants appeared to be quite lethal as judged by preliminary testing, and the LD5,, of these isolates was not determined. However, the high frequency of isolation of mar variants with low neurovirulence (10 out of 22) suggests that reduction in neurovirulence is linked to mutations that cause resistance to neutralization. The reduced neurovirulence of four variants, 433R12.1, 433R27.1, 435Rl .l, and 435R5.1, can be ascribed to their temperature-sensitive phenotype. Three ts mar variants contained a deletion of amino acid 105, while a fourth contained a substitution of Glu for Lys at amino acid 99. The replication of these viruses was reduced in cell culture at 39.5\", and the virions are also thermolabile at this temperature. These ts variants probably do not cause disease in mice because the mouse body temperature is 38\" (Doll and Johnson, 1985) . This conclusion is supported by the observation that the only viruses isolated from paralyzed mice inoculated with the ts variants had lost the ts phenotype and had become more neurovirulent.",

This conclusion is based on the location of amino acid 105 in the atomic structure of poliovirus (see below) as well as our observation that in neural isolate 433R27BEl L, the deleted amino acid 105 is restored. This isolate is ts+ and is neutralized by mab 433, indicating that the deletion of amino acid 105 in 433R27.1 is responsible for both the ts phenotype and resistance to neutralization. The ts+ phenotype of another neural isolate, 435Rl BE1 , is due to a second site suppressor since the amino acid 105 deletion is still present. Two other neural isolates recovered from animals inoculated with ts mutants had become cold sensitive (433R27BElS and 433R12BEl). These cs isolates still contained the 105 deletion, and therefore they must contain a second site suppressor mutation that renders them defective at low temperatures. It will be of interest to identify these second site suppressor mutations because they will provide information on how polypeptides interact in the poliovirus capsid. The ts phenotype of 435R5.1 is due to a mutation outside antigenic site 1, since two other variants with a substitution of Glu for Lys at amino acid 99 (433R17.1 and 433R26.1) were not ts.",

One possibility is that such changes alter the interaction of the virus with a mouse brain receptor and reduce the efficiency of infection. Indeed, any function mediated by the viral capsid, such as penetration, uncoating or RNA packaging, might be affected. Alternatively, the mutations might affect the stability of the virion capsid in the mouse brain, where the environment is quite different from that in a culture dish containing HeLa cells.
