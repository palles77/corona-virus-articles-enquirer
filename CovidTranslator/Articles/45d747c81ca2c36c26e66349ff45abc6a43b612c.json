However, occasionally epidemics occur in which most outbreaks are caused by a single genotype (e.g., Lordsdale-like virus in the Netherlands in 1996) (5, 11) . Hypotheses for the mechanisms behind the emergence of epidemic types range from large-scale foodborne transmission of a single strain to introduction from a nonhuman reservoir. An indication for the latter was a recent report from Japan of the finding of NLV-like sequences in stool specimens from pigs (12) . Enteric caliciviruses have also been detected in other animal species (calves, dogs, and chickens) (13) (14) (15) (16) . However, except for canine calicivirus (17) , these viruses lack definitive sequence evidence linking them to the Caliciviridae (18) . Molecular characterization of three calicivirus strains from cattle has recently been reported. The first virus (Tillamook virus; BCV-Bos1), described by Neill et al. (19) , caused respiratory symptoms and was phylogenetically related to San Miguel sea lion virus and vesicular exanthema of swine virus, both within the genus vesivirus. Viruses in this genus have a broader host range (20) . Two other viruses closely related to GGI NLVs (Jena virus 117/80 and Newbury agent type 2) were detected in feces from newborn calves with diarrhea (21, 22) . The",

To investigate if NLVs are commonly present in farm animals, pooled stool samples from 100 pig farms, 48 chicken farms, 43 dairy cow herds, and 75 veal calf farms from the Netherlands were assayed by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction amplification, using primers specific for the detection of NLVs from humans. NLV RNA was detected in 33 (44%) of the specimens from veal calf farms and two (2%) specimens from pig farms. Our data show that NLV infections-until recently thought to be restricted to humansoccur often in calves and sometimes in pigs. While zoonotic transmission has not been proven, these findings suggest that calves and pigs may be reservoir hosts of NLVs.",

Molecular characterization of calf enteric caliciviruses, named Newbury agent (22) and Jena virus (21) , revealed that they were genetically related and more closely associated with GGI NLVs than with any other known calicivirus.

            "text": "Phylogenetic analysis of the detected sequences showed that they formed a tight cluster with the Newbury sequence (22) and were closely related to NLVs from GGI. Bridger et al. (30) demonstrated that calves can be infected with Newbury calicivirus. The detection of Newbury-like NLVs in pooled veal calf samples of 33 farms from different regions suggests that the species is a normal NLV host. Similarly, the close genetic relationship between calicivirus sequences detected in the pig samples in our study and those from Japan suggests that these viruses commonly infect pigs. The close similarity of porcine and bovine sequences to the NLVs infecting humans indicates the possibility of an animal reservoir for human infection. However, these findings by no means prove zoonotic transmission. Genetically related viruses are commonly found in different species without resulting in apparent widespread interspecies transmission (e.g., rotavirus). On the other hand, zoonotic transmission cannot be excluded. The genetic distances between the animal and human NLVs are similar to the distances between the GGI and GGII strains, and epidemic spread of some NLV strains (5) led to the widespread-possibly global-emergence of a single predominant strain in the human population in 1995-96 (11) . This epidemiologic observation resembles early descriptions of the vesicular exanthema of swine virus (VESV) epidemics (31) . These viruses, belonging to another genus within the Caliciviridae, the vesiviruses, are known for their broad host range (20) . The occasional epidemic spread of VESV was later linked to introduction of caliciviruses from an ocean reservoir (20) . Therefore, interspecies transmission of NLVs is possible; the occasional widespread NLV epidemics caused by a single strain may result from introductions of new NLV strains from an animal reservoir. Reynolds et al. reported electron microscopy detection of caliciviruses in calf diarrhea outbreaks (32) , and the bovine caliciviruses Newbury agent (22) and Jena virus (21) were pathogenic for calves under experimental conditions and in field studies (33) . In our study, we did not record disease or death on the surveyed farms and therefore cannot determine whether these caliciviruses were associated with disease. Despite repeated attempts, experimental infection of different animal species with the prototype Norwalk virus has not been successful, with the exception of infection in chimpanzees (3) . Our findings may lead to the development of an animal model for the NLVs of humans; for example, a pig model would enable studies of (mucosal) immunity following NLV infection (1) .",
