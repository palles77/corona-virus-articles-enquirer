A membranous envelope is associated with a relatively low resistance to desiccation, heat, alcohols, or detergents, limiting survival of virus particles outside their host. However, carrying an envelope offers distinct advantages for a virus: (i) envelopment allows the virus to exit from its host cell using the cellular machinery for exocytosis, thus avoiding cell damage and preventing immune responses; (ii) the envelope increases the packaging capacity of a virus particle and allows for carrying additional viral proteins; (iii) the envelope hides structurally restricted capsid antigens from circulating antibodies; and (iv) envelope proteins on the surface of a virus have a higher structural flexibility than capsid proteins because they are not part of a rigid capsid structure; thus, enveloped viruses can escape neutralizing immune response better than their nonenveloped counterparts. Most zoonotic viruses are enveloped; apparently, variations of envelope proteins facilitate adaptation to different hosts, although of course additional adaptations are required.",

On the one hand, viral infection may be prevented by prophylactic vaccinations. Indeed, successful vaccines against several enveloped viruses have been established (Table 1) . On the other hand, newly emerging viruses cannot be targeted by vaccines, and there are no vaccines approved yet to prevent infections with several important human pathogens such as hepatitis C virus (HCV), HIV, cytomegalovirus (CMV), or Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). Furthermore, despite an effective vaccine against hepatitis B virus (HBV), >240 million people are still chronically infected and need curative therapeutic options.

Using cellular targets helps to avoid rapid adaptation of viruses and development of drug resistance, and often allows targeting of emerging as well as known pathogens at the same time. Therefore, targeting host cell factors is becoming more popular in antiviral drug development. Another alternative is using immunomodulatory therapies that have proven to be very efficient in the control of viral infections. In this review, we therefore focus on new developments in antiviral strategies primarily targeting host factors ( Figure 1 ) and on immunotherapies targeting the surface proteins of enveloped viruses (Figures 2 and 3) . sites by different enveloped viruses. Molecules binding to these membrane components compete with the virus for its attachment to the host cell and can thus inhibit infection at the earliest step. For example, a new class of synthetic anti-lipopolysaccharide (LPS) peptides, named SALPs, significantly interfere with de novo infection of various enveloped viruses in vitro, such as HIV, herpes simplex virus (HSV)-1, HSV-2, HCV, and HBV, by binding to heparan sulfate proteoglycan (HSPG) moieties covering the cell surface [1] . Further molecules that bind or mimic HSPG have been used to inhibit infection with distinct enveloped viruses: peptide 3-O-HS for HSV-2 [2] , peptide SB105-A10 for respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), lactoferrin for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) [2, 3] , chondroitin sulfate for Dengue virus [4] , and chemically sulfated derivatives of the Escherichia coli K5 capsular polysaccharide for CMV [5] .",

HIV fusion inhibitors (e.g., T-20, enfuvirtide) and CCR5 inhibitors (e.g., maraviroc) are already in clinical use (Table 2 ).

Blocking their tyrosine kinase activity with clinically approved inhibitors broadly impairs infection by all major HCV genotypes and known viral escape variants [7] . Recently, a myristoylated peptide derived from the N-terminal part of the large surface protein of HBV, named Myrcludex-B, has been shown to bind to the sodium-taurocholate transporter peptide NTCP serving as HBV and hepatitis D virus (HDV) receptor. Myrcludex B efficiently prevents HBV and HDV infection [9] , and is currently being evaluated in clinical trials.

This has been proven both in vitro and in vivo using ezetimibe, an FDA-approved selective inhibitor of intestinal cholesterol absorption [14] . Circulating HCV virions are embedded in triglyceride-rich lipoproteins, including very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) and low-density lipoprotein (LDL), and are therefore referred to as lipoviro-particles. Inhibitors of lipoprotein lipase (LPL), the enzyme catalyzing conversion of VLDL to LDL, prevent HCV infection in vitro as well as in primary human hepatocytes transplanted into uPA-SCID mice by retaining the viral particles at the cell surface [15, 16] .

CARs are composed of a single chain antibody fragment binding to viral envelope proteins on the surface of infected cells, and intracellular signaling domains. Due to the necessity of viral envelope proteins being incorporated into cellular membranes, this therapeutic approach can exclusively be used to target enveloped viruses. CARs have been shown to activate specifically T cells against CMV in vitro [53] or influenza virus in vivo [54] , and T cells expressing a CAR that binds the surface protein of HBV (HBs) efficiently kill infected primary hepatocytes and control viral replication in transgenic mice [55] . HBV, unlike other viruses, does not have a stage-dependent protein expression (a so-called early late shift), which would allow targeting only for a limited time span. HBV-infected cells constantly produce HBs even if virus replication is controlled, therefore, targeting HBs by immunotherapy represents a promising approach to cure hepatitis B. Antiviral T cell responses might also be induced by therapeutic vaccination. A prominent example are recent experiments with CMV-based vaccine vectors that conferred sustained control and even clearance of SIV in macaques used to model HIV infection [56] .",

The disadvantages of targeting distinct viral proteins or enzymes, however, are the high risk of resistance development and the narrow spectrum of application to often only one particular virus. Alternative therapeutic strategies therefore often aim at targeting host cell factors essential for supporting the viral life cycle. This can avoid rapid development of resistance, but also allows targeting of emerging pathogens that use similar infection strategies as the known viruses. Especially for chronic and persistent viral infections, immune therapies provide an attractive alternative that also has been proven to be very efficient in the control of viral infections but has not yet been broadly exploited.",

Antibodies block attachment of the virus to the receptor on the host cell by either binding to viral envelope proteins (A), or to the receptor (B). Fusion of virus and cytoplasm (C), or endosome membranes (D) is prevented by antibody blocking of the fusogenic peptide. Antibodies also mediate activation of the immune system via the Fc (fragment, crystallizable) region. Opsonization of infected cells or virus particles leads to activation of the complement cascade (E). The Fc region is also recognized by Fc receptors on natural killer (NK) cells, which secrete cytokines and lyse infected cells (F), or on macrophages, which phagocytize the virus-antibody complexes (G).",

Bispecific antibodies consist of two specificities: one targeting a viral envelope protein on the surface of the infected cell and the other one targeting a molecule on the immune cell, for example, CD3 on T cells. For example, bispecific antibodies are generated by chemically linking two F(ab) (fragment, antigen binding) regions (A), or by genetically linking two scFvs (single chain fragment variable) with different specificities, so-called bispecific T cell engagers (BiTEs) (B). Viral envelope proteins can also be targeted by T cells genetically modified to express a chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) (C). This receptor consists of an scFv binding to the viral protein, a spacer domain, and intracellular CD28 and CD3z signaling domains. Upon antigen binding the CAR dimerizes and activation of the T cell is triggered.",
