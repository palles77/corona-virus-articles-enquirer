In this study, we constructed a recombinant (pgsA-HA1 gene fusion) Lactococcus lactis strain that expresses and displays the avian influenza virus HA1 antigens on its surface. The vectors were administered by oral delivery with or without the addition of cholera toxin subunit B (CTB). The resulting immune responses were analyzed, and the mice were eventually challenged with lethal doses of H5N1 viruses. Significant titers of hemagglutinin (HA)-specific serum IgG and fecal IgA were detected in the group that also received CTB. Cellular immunities were also shown in both cell proliferation and gamma interferon (IFN-\u2425) enzyme-linked immunospot (ELISpot) assays. Most importantly, the mice that received the L. lactis pgsA-HA1 strain combined with CTB were completely protected from lethal challenge of the H5N1 virus. These findings support the further development of L. lactis-based avian influenza virus vaccines for human and animal uses.",

Since the viruses are going through constant genetic changes, one day they may acquire the ability to be transmitted among humans, leading to a human pandemic threat (30) .

L. lactis is a Gram-positive lactic acid bacterium that is widely used for the production and preservation of fermented milk products, so it is generally regarded as safe (GRAS). In order to improve the immune efficiency of recombinant L. lactis, various approaches have been explored, such as oral dosages, route of administration, adjuvants, and antigen location (surface, cytoplasm, and extracellular) (18, 26) ; among these methods, the mucosal immune route (intranasal or oral) combined with the nontoxic B subunit of cholera toxin (CTB), which is a strong mucosal adjuvant, are regarded as the best way to improve immune efficiency (2, 15) . After heterologous protein was displayed on the cell surface through the anchor domain, it showed a better immune outcome than proteins expressed intracellularly (17) . The use of PgsA from Bacillus subtilis as a C-terminal anchor protein has been verified by Lee et al. (16) .",

Then the pgsA DNA fragment and HA1 DNA fragment were fused into pgsA-HA1 through a bridge PCR using primers pgsA-F and HA1-R, which contained SpeI and HindIII sites, respectively. For generation of a surface display plasmid, the resulting pgsA-HA1 DNA fragment was digested with SpeI-HindIII and inserted into similarly digested pNZ8110 under transcriptional control of the nisA promoter to generate pNZ8110-pgsA-HA1 (Fig. 1A) . The resulting plasmid was transformed into L. lactis NZ9000 by electroporation to create the L. lactis pgsA-HA1 strain. As a negative control, L. lactis NZ9000 was transformed with the pgsA gene to generate the L. lactis pgsA strain.",

A total of 150 l 10 10 CFU of the L. lactis pgsA-HA1 or pgsA strain with [pgsA (CTB)]or without CTB was orally administered to BALB/c mice (SPF grade). The effects of vaccination on the production of HA-specific serum IgG and fecal IgA were examined 10 days after the final immunization. As shown in Fig. 2A IgG antibody titer obtained showed a significant increase compared with those of the other groups. Fecal IgA was also examined and was significantly produced after immunization with the L. lactis pgsA-HA1 (CTB) strain (Fig. 2B) .

However, proteins delivered orally are easily degraded and have very low immunogenicity (3), so it is essential to develop specific vaccine delivery systems and adjuvants to facilitate the antigen's interaction with the host's immune system. L. lactis is a nonpathogenic, noninvasive, and noncommensal food-grade bacterium that has been considered an ideal mucosal delivery vector (33) . L. lactis-derived vectors are widely used and have a superior safety profile (33) compared to other bacterially based live vectors, such as Mycobacterium bovis bacillus Calmette-Gu\u00e9rin (BCG) (1), Listeria monocytogenes (29) , Salmonella (9) , and Shigella (28) . However, it may have less immunogenicity than more virulent vectors. In order to improve Previously, we reported the development of a recombinant L. lactis strain for oral immunization in enteric minicapsules (19) . We used the nisin-controlled expression (NICE) system to construct L. lactis vectors that express and secret the HA antigen. In this study, we further modified the expression system to display the HA1 antigen protein on the surface of L. lactis through the PgsA anchor motif. We believe such modi-fication can further improve the antigen's stability orally and at the same time facilitate antigen presentation because bacteria cell wall anchoring proteins were found to be more resistant to proteolysis and easily taken up by the epithelial M cell of the small intestine (33) .",

            "text": "Furthermore, for orally administered vaccines, it is also considered essential to incorporate special adjuvants to boost interaction with the nucosal immune system. Various synthetic vectors such as microspheres, liposomes, nanoparticles, and immunostimulating complexes (ISCOMs) have been tested and showed improved immune responses, but the efficacies were not optimal (5). Certain bacterial toxins such as the cholera toxin (CT) and Escherichia coli heatlabile enterotoxin (LT) were considered more immunogenic (4) . Although these toxins are toxic in general, previous studies had shown that the B subunit may be a benign functional unit involved only in the recognition and binding to ganglioside GM1 cell receptors. Recombinant CTBs or LT subunits B (LTBs) had been used successfully in several vaccination studies as adjuvants with oral administration (4, 8) . They can stimulate upregulation of B7-2 expression on antigen-presenting cells (APCs) and promote Th2 immune responses (10) . In this study, we confirmed the immunestimulating effect of CTB. The CTB proteins were simply mixed with the HA-expressing L. lactis vectors and administered orally. Both the resulting IgG and IgA responses were higher, and the cell-mediated response was also improved compared to the data obtained with the L. lactis vectors alone (Fig. 2 and Fig. 3) . We think the immuneadjuvanting effect of CTB in our study is critical to generate protective immunity against H5N1 virus challenge. Experiments with heterologous cross-protection against various divergent strains are ongoing.",
