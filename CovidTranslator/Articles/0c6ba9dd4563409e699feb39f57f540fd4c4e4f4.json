In our study, 719 porcine diarrhoea samples from 18 provinces in China were collected for PDCoV and porcine epidemic diarrhoea virus (PEDV) detection. The epidemiological survey revealed that the positive rates of PDCoV, PEDV and coinfection were 13.07%, 36.72% and 4.73%, respectively. The entire spike (S) genes of eleven detected PDCoV strains were sequenced. Phylogenetic analysis showed that the majority of PDCoVs could be divided into three lineages: the China lineage, the USA/Japan/South Korea lineage and the Viet Nam/Laos/ Thailand lineage. The China and the Viet Nam/Laos/Thailand lineages showed much greater genetic divergences than the USA/Japan/South Korea lineage. The present study detected one new monophyletic branch that contained three PDCoVs from China, and this branch was separated from the China lineage but closely related to the Viet Nam/Laos/Thailand lineage. The strain CH-HA2-2017, which belongs to this new branch, had a possible recombination event between positions 27 and 1234. Significant amino acid substitutions of PDCoV S proteins were analysed and displayed with a three-dimensional cartoon diagram. The visual spatial location of these substitutions gave a conformational-based reference for further studies on the significance of critical sites on the PDCoV S protein.",

The clinical infection symptoms caused by PDCoV are similar to but milder than those of porcine epidemic diarrhoea virus (PEDV) . PDCoV is an enveloped, single-stranded, positive-sense RNA virus that belongs to the genus Deltacoronavirus within the family Coronaviridae of the order Nidovirales. PDCoV was first discovered in Hong Kong, China, in 2012 in a territory-wide molecular epidemiology study in mammals and birds (Woo et al., 2012) . PDCoV was subsequently reported in the United States in 2014 (Castro et al., 2012; Wang et al., 2014) and then in South Korea, mainland China, Japan, Thailand, Viet Nam and Lao People's Democratic Republic (Lao PDR) (Lee and Lee, 2014; Lorsirigool et al., 2016; Saeng-Chuto et al., 2017a; Song et al., 2015) . The coinfection of PDCoV with other enteric viral pathogens such as PEDV, rotavirus or kobuvirus are commonly reported (Mai et al., 2018; Marthaler et al., 2014a; Marthaler et al., 2014b) .",

            "text": "The genome of PDCoV is composed of approximately 25.4 kb nucleotides and has a genomic organization similar to other coronaviruses: a 5\u2032 untranslated region (UTR), open reading frame 1a (ORF1a) and ORF1b encoding two overlapping polyprotein precursors; four structural protein genes encoding spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M), and nucleocapsid (N); three accessory protein genes encoding NS6, NS7, and NS7a; and a 3' UTR and poly (A) tail (Chen et al., 2015a; Fang et al., 2017; Fang et al., 2016; Li et al., 2014; Woo et al., 2012) . For coronaviruses, the function of the S protein is to recognize receptors and mediate viral entry into host cells. The S protein is composed of an N-terminal S1 subunit for receptor binding and a Cterminal S2 subunit for the fusion of host and viral membranes. The cryo-electron microscopy structure of PDCoV S protein ectodomain (Se) without the transmembrane anchor or intracellular tail in the prefusion state (Shang et al., 2018) showed that the S1 subunit contained an N-terminal domain (S1-NTD), a C-terminal domain (S1-CTD) and connecting subdomains (SDs). The S2 subunit contained two central helices (CH-N and CH-C), a hydrophobic fusion peptide (FP), two heptad repeat (HR-N and HR-C) regions and connecting loops. Between S1 and S2 are connecting SDs and a long loop. Because the S protein of the coronavirus is the major surface protein and the main target of the host humoural immune response, it is considered to be evolutionarily related and a focus of vaccine design (Graham et al., 2013) .",

In the present study, to further investigate the epidemiology and phylogenetics of PDCoV in China, a total of 719 porcine samples from 18 provinces in China from 2016 to 2018 were simultaneously tested for PDCoV and PEDV. The S gene sequences of 11 PDCoV strains from PDCoV-positive samples were sequenced and analysed. Phylogenetic, sequence and recombination analyses were also performed. The results from this study will help to understand the prevalence of PDCoV strains in China and further provide more insights into the evolution and diversity of PDCoVs.",

Three sequenced strains (CH-HA1, CH-HA2 and CH-HA3), which formed a new monophyletic branch, were most closely related to the Viet Nam/Laos/Thailand lineage strains.

Is there any possibility that the major parent is recombinant also? It needs to be further studied until enough PDCoV sequences are available. However, the global genetic divergence analysis of PDCoV showed that the relationship between the China and Viet Nam/Laos/Thailand lineages (0.037 \u00b1 0.003) was farther than that of the China and USA/Japan/South Korea lineages (0.017 \u00b1 0.001), this result makes the close relationship between China's new branch and the Viet Nam/Laos/Thailand lineage incomprehensible, as these three lineages originated from the same or different ancestors and need to be intensely analysed with more sequences. Furthermore, the greater genetic divergence (0.036 and 0.037) of the Viet Nam/Laos/Thailand lineage among three lineages suggesting that the Viet Nam/Laos/ Thailand strains may diverged from other early lineages.",

The S protein of the coronavirus is the main determinant of viral host range and tissue tropism; thus, substitutions in the S protein are critical for analysing the evolution, infectivity and pathogenicity of PDCoV. In the present study, significant amino acid substitutions of the S protein between global PDCoV strains were analysed. Although the significance of these substitutions is almost obscured currently, the three-dimensional cartoon diagram displaying gave a visual spatial location and made it possible to deduce their potential functions. The substitutions mapped on the surface loops of S1-NTD and SDs may be associated with the connection of different S1 and S2 subunits to form the crown-like structure, the residue 307 located on a \u03b2-sheet of S1-CTD was exposed on the surface of the S trimer and may be responsible for the antigenicity of the S protein.",

The sites and locations of significant amino acid substitutions in the PDCoV S protein were analysed, but the exact biological functions need more experiments to be elucidated. Our study provides useful insights into the molecular characteristics of prevalent China PDCoV strains and provides references for further biological research on potential functional sites of the S protein and pathogenicity studies. Moreover, further analysis of molecular epidemiology based on the complete genome sequence is urgently needed. ",

S1-CTD: C-terminal domain of S1, CH-N and CH-C: central helices N and C, FP: fusion peptide, HR-N and HR-C: heptad repeats N and C, SDs: subdomains. The dots represent amino acids that are identical to the strain HKU15-44. The red bars indicate the precise positions of deletions in the S proteins. (B) All significant substitutions displayed on the threedimensional cartoon diagram of PDCoV S-e by using PyMOL software.
