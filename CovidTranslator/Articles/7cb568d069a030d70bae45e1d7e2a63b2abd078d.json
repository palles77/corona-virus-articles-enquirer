            "text": "All children hospitalized with a diagnosis of ALRTI, between April 2006 to March 2008 were enrolled. Nasopharyngeal aspirates (NPA) were collected following informed consent, on the day of admission according to a standard protocol and transported to the virology diagnostic laboratory within 4h. The supernatants and cells of NPA were separated by centrifugation [10] and the cell-free fluid was stored in aliquots at -80\u00baC until RNA extraction. Total RNA was extracted by using the QIAamp viral RNA mini kit (Qiagen, Germany) and complementary DNA (cDNA) was synthesized by using the PrimeScript RT Reagent Kit (TaKaRa, China). Primers used for HCoV-NL63 gene amplification have been previously described [1, 11] . The bulk PCR products were purified using a QIAquick Gel Extraction kit (Qiagen, Germany). Sequence analyses of the PCR products were performed on an ABI 3100 sequencer at core facility of nucleotide sequencing of Chongqing Medical University. The sequenced fragments of the HCoV-NL63 1a gene were assembled and analyzed with the SEQMAN, EDITSEQ, and MEGALIGN programs in the Lasergene program (DNASTAR, Madison, WI). Phylogenetic trees were generated by the neighbor-joining method using the MEGA4 program. Clinical evaluation and statistical analysis. The clinical diagnosis of ALRTI was based on the presence of cough, tachypnea, chest indrawing, or wheeze of <7 days duration, as per WHO standard protocol [12] . The medical files of HCoV-NL63 infected children were written by pediatricians. In brief, the lists included date of collection of NPA, demographic data (age, gender, hospital days, history of wheezing of patients or their families), symptoms (fever, cough, wheezing, tachypnea, cyanosis, rhinitis, hoarseness of voice, vomiting and diarrhea), laboratory testing (coinfection with viruses, white blood cell count and differential count, C-reactive protein, chest radiograph), discharge diagnosis, and outcome (amelioration or recovery).",

In this study, all HCoV-NL63 positive patients were under 12 months old, and most of HCoV-NL63 positive patients (6/8) were under 6 months old. These results show that HCoV-NL63 causes ALRTI in younger children, especially in infants, as shown in previous studies [8, 14] .",

In previous studies, [8, 9, 11, 15] some of the children with HCoV-NL63 infection experienced underlying medical problems, especially prematurity and pulmonary and cardiac diseases, whereas none of our patients experienced underlying diseases identified. None of the 8 patients required intensive care, indicating that HCoV-NL63 infection does not lead to relatively severe illness requiring internsive care even in infants. Unfortunately, VOLUME 49 __ OCTOBER 16 The phylogenetic analysis of the HCoV-NL63 isolates indicated they belonged to the separated circulation of cluster 1 viruses from September 2006 to December 2006, and cluster 2 viruses from January 2007 to September 2007. A one-year study from Canada also found all circulating isolates were in cluster 1 [11] , yielding a speculation that viruses from one cluster may shift to another over time and therefore lead to periodic circulation of two cluster viruses.",
