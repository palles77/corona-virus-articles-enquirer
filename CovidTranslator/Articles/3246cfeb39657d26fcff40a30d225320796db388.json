We investigated whether the microbiological profiling could be used to differentiate between these two conditions. Methods: Children up to five years of age, with rAOM (n = 45) or COME (n = 129) and scheduled for tympanostomy tube insertion were enrolled in a prospective study between 2008 and 2009. Middle ear fluids (n = 119) and nasopharyngeal samples (n = 173) were collected during surgery for bacterial culture and PCR analysis to identify Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae and Moraxella catarrhalis, and to detect 15 distinct respiratory viruses. Results: The occurrence of bacterial and viral pathogens in middle ear fluids did not significantly differ between patients suffering from rAOM and COME. In both patient cohorts, H. influenzae and rhinovirus were the predominant pathogens in the middle ear and nasopharynx. Nasopharyngeal carriage with two or three bacterial pathogens was associated with the presence of bacteria in middle ear fluid (P = 0.04). The great majority of the bacteria isolated from middle ear fluid were genetically identical to nasopharyngeal isolates from the same patient. Conclusions: Based on these results, we propose that the common perception that rAOM is associated with recurrent episodes of microbiologically mediated AOM, whereas COME is generally a sterile inflammation, should be reconsidered.",

OME, on the other hand, can either develop as a sequel to AOM, or develop de novo, the primary symptom being hearing loss due to the presence of middle ear fluid in the middle ear cavity (but in the absence of signs of acute inflammation) [6] .

AOM management generally involves adequate analgesics with an optional observation period for 48-72 h [5] . Thereafter, antibiotic treatment or, in the case of recurrent infections, antibiotic prophylaxis or ventilation tube insertion are considered [5, 8, 9] . In contrast, for OME disease, medical intervention is appropriate only if persistent clinical benefits can be achieved in the absence of spontaneous resolution. Therefore, healthy children with OME are observed for at least 3 months before medical intervention is considered, in which case surgical treatment involving the insertion of ventilation tubes or adenoidectomy is feasible [3, 10] . Vaccination against OM diseases is currently very limited, being directed against very few bacterial OM pathogens, and only one of the viral OM pathogens, i.e. the influenza vaccine. The heptavalent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine is primarily directed against pneumococcal invasive disease, whereas the introduction of vaccination only reduced the overall OM incidence by 6-9% due to serotype or pathogen replacement [11] . However, herd immunity may induce a further decline in OM incidence, in line with nasopharyngeal colonization studies 3 years after the introduction of the vaccine [12, 13] .",

Colonization of the nasopharynx with Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae or Moraxella catarrhalis (the three most important bacterial pathogens associated with OM disease) at an early stage, has been shown to predispose children for development of rAOM [14] . In addition, OM-prone children have increased carriage rates of these bacterial pathogens compared to healthy controls [15, 16] . In AOM, S. pneumoniae is the most frequently detected pathogen in middle ear fluid, followed by non-typeable H. influenzae and M. catarrhalis [17] [18] [19] . However, H. influenzae tends to predominate in COME, followed in a lesser extent by S. pneumoniae and M. catarrhalis [20] . In general, bacteria have been found less frequently in the middle ear of children suffering from COME compared to AOM (approximately 30% versus 70%, respectively) [17] .",

The COME patient population consisted of children who had experienced a period of persistent OM with effusion lasting longer than 3 months. RAOM or COME diagnosis was made by an otolaryngologist in routine clinical practice based upon signs, symptoms, otoscopy and audiometry including tympanometry. Patients with a history of malignancy, organ transplantation or immune deficiency were excluded from participation, as well as patients with recent elective ear surgery or systemic infectious diseases. Children with AOM and/or fever (T ! 38 8C) at the time of ventilation tube insertion were rescheduled for the procedure. Adenoidectomy performed in the same surgical setting was not considered to be an exclusion criterion. Patient characteristics and risk factors were acquired using a questionnaire, collected at the day of ventilation tube insertion.

The S. pneumoniae, H. influenzae and M. catarrhalis genotypes isolated from the total cohort of children comprised a genetically heterogeneous population structure, i.e. the isolates were genetically highly diverse, even though they all originated from a relatively restricted geographical region of The Netherlands. Importantly, the bacterial pathogens that were detected in the middle ear fluids of our cohorts tended to be genetically identical (using MLST) to those isolates cultured from the nasopharynx (80-100%), a finding that correlates with previously published data. Studies investigating the genetic relatedness of bacteria obtained from different locations of the upper respiratory tract, and within a single patient are scarce. Various approaches to determine the genetic relatedness of nasopharyngeal and OM isolates have been described, however MLST was only used once, a technique that is considered to be the gold standard regarding bacterial genotyping [42] [43] [44] . Rhinoviruses have been implicated in the pathogenesis of OM [45, 46] and showed to be the most frequently found virus in the nasopharynx and middle ear of both COME and rAOM patients. Co-infection of rhinovirus and enterovirus was found in the middle ear, but not in the nasopharynx. Co-occurrence of these viruses has been previously described by Rezes et al., who found rhinovirus in middle ear fluid in 4.8% of the 17 children, enterovirus in 23.8% and both rhino-and enterovirus in 14.3% [46] . Nevertheless, in our study the co-occurrence of multiple viruses in middle ear fluid or in the nasopharynx was rare. In the nasopharynx of our OM patients we found a single virus in 46% and 2 viruses in 9%, in contrast to healthy children as described by Bogaert et al. [47] . They found two or more viruses in the majority of the virus positive nasopharyngeal samples, in 96 children up to two years of age [47] . In our cohort only 15% of the children under the age of 2 had maximal two viruses in the nasopharynx. This finding suggests that in symptomatic children suffering from OM one virus is predominant in the nasopharynx, whereas in healthy children more viruses can be present without clinical significance.",

To our knowledge this is the first report describing a highly significant association for the co-occurrence of bacteria and virus in the nasopharynx of rAOM and COME patients. More specifically, nasopharyngeal co-colonization of rhinoviruses with either S. pneumoniae, or H. influenzae, was statistically significant. Pitkaranta et al. observed a positive correlation between the presence of S. pneumoniae or M. catarrhalis and rhinovirus in the nasopharynx, but not of H. influenzae and rhinovirus [45] . However, the authors focused on nasopharyngeal samples of OM-prone children, and exclusion criteria for their study were either recent or expected ventilation tube insertion and COME diagnosis [45] . In the present study, no association between the co-occurrence of these viruses and bacteria was observed in middle ear fluids for both rAOM and COME cohorts, likely caused by the relatively low number of bacteria detected in middle ear fluid. In addition, since viruses can predispose to bacterial superinfection, it is possible that they are already cleared from the middle ear cavity at the time of surgery.",
