            "text": "Durum wheat safety is affected by different threats comprising both abiotic and biotic agents. In the first class, pesticides are widely represented including neurotoxic molecules such as organophosphates and carbamates. Organophosphorus (OP) compounds are substances widely used in agricultural practices as pesticides having low environmental persistence and high efficacy. These compounds act by inhibition of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity as neurotoxic agents via an excessive stimulation of the cholinergic receptors in both insects and mammals, including humans [1] . This can lead to various clinical implications and high acute toxicity [2] . Among organophosphates dichlorvos (2,2-dichlorovinyl dimethyl phosphate) and pirimiphos methyl (O-[2-(diethylamino)-6-methyl-4-pyrimidinyl]O,O-dimethylphosphorothioate) are important contaminants for the durum wheat industry. Dichlorvos is one of the most widely used pesticides worldwide in the storage of many products, such as corn, rice, and durum wheat, finding widespread use in most European countries [3] . European Union regulation foresees a maximum residue limit (MRL) for dichlorvos in durum wheat at 2.0 mg/g [4] . Dichlorvos is also classified as a probable human carcinogen on the basis of the effects observed in mice and rats. Therefore, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) proposed cancellation of most uses of dichlorvos and proposed Potato, carrot, and sweet pepper samples spiked with aldicarb, propoxur, carbaryl, carbofuran, and methomyl tested with this AChE biosensor, exhibited acceptable recoveries (79-96%) [24] .",

The method included an oxidation step of phosphorothionates pastiches to produce the oxygenated derivative, which represent the active pesticide molecule. Moreover, the biosensors could be regenerated via the recovery of AChE activity through a chemical activation with pyridine-2-aldoxime methochloride (PAM).

This strategy has been applied to different kinds of electrodes in terms of geometry and material ranging from the hanging mercury drop electrode [50] , carbon paste electrode [51] , to screen-printed carbon transducers [52] . Methods to oxidize target DNA indirectly through the use of electrochemical mediators have also been explored. An especially attractive approach uses polypyridyl complexes of Ru(II) and Os(II) to mediate the electrochemical oxidation of guanine [53] . This detection approach provide high sensitivity without complex instrumentation through redox-mediated indirect DNA oxidation, the main limitation consisting in the electrode preparation that can be difficult to handle. Several applications have been described in which target DNA sequences are labelled with redox-active reporter molecules. Appearance of the characteristic electrochemical response of the redox reporter signals the occurrence of the hybridization event. Using physical separation methods to isolate the labelled sequences, LODs of the order of $10 \u00c010 molecules have been reported [54, 55] . As an alternative to chemical labelling schemes, DNA-mediated charge transport electrochemistry has been exploited as detection scheme using redox-active molecules that noncovalently associate with the double helix. In these analyzes, rather than serving as a reactant, the DNA is the mediator. These assays can provide high sensitivity and simplicity. Nanoparticle-based electrochemistry amplification is another detection scheme that has been exploited. In this case, intercalative probe molecules are used taking advantage of the electronic structure of double-helical DNA, using intercalated redox probe molecules to report the perturbations occurring in base stacking [56] . In this format the intercalator is not used to report the amount of DNA or whether it is double stranded versus single stranded; here the DNA base pair stack mediates charge transport to the intercalator bound to the DNA. The method relies on the switch of inherent characteristic of duplex DNA and its ability to mediate charge transport is used for the detection. Assays of DNA-mediated electrochemistry, using both DNAmediated charge transport, and nanoparticle-based electrochemistry amplification, are therefore uniquely suited to sense changes in DNA: damage, mistakes, mismatches, and even protein binding [57, 58] .",

            "text": "In this report, we review some recent applications of electrochemical DNA screen printed based biosensor for the detection of microorganisms including, viruses, bacteria, and fungi. An electrochemical hybridization biosensor based on the intrinsic oxidation signals of nucleic acids (guanine oxidation) and proteins (tyrosine and tryptophan) has been designed, that makes use of the unique binding event between Escherichia coli single-strand binding (SSB) protein and single-stranded DNA (ssDNA). The voltammetric signal from guanine oxidation significantly decreased upon binding of SSB to single-stranded oligonucleotides (probe), anchored on a single-walled CNT-modified screen-printed carbon electrode. Simultaneously, oxidation of the tyrosine and tryptophan residues of the SSB protein increased upon binding of the SSB protein to ssDNA and ss-oligonucleotides. The LOD of 0.15 mg/mL of target DNA can be applied to genetic assays [59] . Some work devoted to food safety resulted in the realization of an electrochemical biochip able to specifically detect Bacillus cereus. B. cereus constitutes a significant cause of acute food poisoning in humans. The DNA biosensor was specifically designed using a capture probe for the toxin-encoding genes. A bead-based sandwich hybridization system was obtained in conjugation with electric chips for detection of both vegetative cells and spores of Bacillus strains. The system consisted of a silicon chip-based potentiometric cell, and utilizes paramagnetic beads as solid carriers of the DNA probes. The specific signals from 20 amol of bacterial cell or spore DNA were achieved in less than 4 h. The method could be also applied directly to unpurified spore and cell extract samples. The developed method can offer a contribution in the rapid identification of Bacillus strains without preceding nucleic acid amplification [60] . A recent advancement in DNA biosensor consisted in the realization of an electrochemical microfluidic biosensor with an integrated minipotentiostat for the quantification of RNA based on nucleic acid hybridization and liposome signal amplification for dengue virus detection. The detection scheme was ensured by short DNA probes that hybridize with the target RNA or DNA sequence. A reporter probe, coupled to liposomes entrapping the electrochemically active redox couple potassium ferri/ferrohexacyanide, was used to amplify the recognition reaction. The capture probes were bound to superparamagnetic beads that were isolated on a magnet in the biosensor. Upon hybridization reaction, the liposomes were lysed to release the electrochemical markers. The detection occurred at interdigitated ultramicroelectrode array. The system was completed by a miniaturized instrumentation (miniEC). The functionality of the miniEC was successfully demonstrated with the detection of dengue virus RNA [61] . A biosensor for virus detection, particularly for SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) virus, has been described by Abad-Valle et al. [62] . The functioning scheme was a typical hybridization biosensor constructed on a gold thin-film electrode. The selected target, a 30-mer sequence, was chosen in a lysine-rich region, unique to SARS virus and the complementary strand, the probe, was immobilized to the gold surface. Hybridization reaction with the biotinconjugated SARS strand (at the 3 0 -end) was obtained and monitored using alkaline phosphatase (AP)-labelled streptavidin that permitted amplified indirect electrochemical detection. The analytical signal is constituted by an electrochemical process of indigo carmine, the soluble product of the enzymatic hydrolysis of 3-indoxyl phosphate. The use of a sensitive electrochemical technique such as square wave voltammetry allowed an LOD of 6 pM to be obtained for this DNA sequence [62] . A multiple pathogen detection system based on hybridization coupled with bioelectronic detection was described by Vernon et al. [63] . The method was developed using papillomaviruses as a model system. In this case, two chips were spotted with capture probes consisting of DNA oligonucleotide sequences specific for HPV types and two electrically conductive signal probes were synthesized to be complementary to a distinct region of the amplified HPV target DNA. The measuring system was able to successfully detect 86% of the HPV types contained in clinical samples demonstrating the feasibility of integrated detection of multiple pathogens.",

            "text": "Some work has been carried out from Prof. Palleschi's group in Rome leading to the development of disposable immunosensor for the determination of domoic acid (DA) in shellfish [72] . DA is neurotoxic amino acid responsible for the human syndrome known as ''amnesic shellfish poisoning'' (ASP). The method involves the use of disposable SPEs for the immunosensor development based on a ''competitive indirect test''. DA conjugated to bovine serum albumin (BSA-DA) was coated onto the working electrode of the SPE, followed by incubation with sample (or standard toxin) and anti-DA antibody. An anti-goat IgG-alkaline phosphatase (AP) conjugate was used for signal generation via the use of an electrochemical substrate, naphtyl phosphate. The enzyme product, naphtol was detected by differential pulse voltammetry (DPV). The immunosensors allowed the detection of 20 mg/g of DA in mussel tissue. Moving toward toxins produced by fungi, the same group has devised an electrochemical immunosensor for aflatoxin M1. The analyzed matrix was milk [73] . The immunosensors were fabricated by immobilizing AFM1 antibodies directly on the surface of SPEs, and allowing the competition to occur between free AFM1 and that conjugated with peroxidase (HRP) enzyme. The electrochemical technique used was the chronoamperometry, performed at \u00c0100 mV. Results have shown that using SPEs aflatoxin M1 can be measured with an LOD of 25 ppt and with a working range between 30 and 160 ppt. Moreover, the authors claim that interference problems have been addressed for the direct analysis of aflatoxin M1 in milk.",

For eeAChE, the recovery for dichlorvos-spiked samples ranged between 74 and 78%. The incomplete recovery may be due to concurrent causes, such as the use of whole kernels as sample, water-based extraction solvent, and adsorption exerted by the matrix. Although the advantage of using the extraction solvent as measuring buffer has an important influence on the speed of the assay, in order to detect dichlorvos at 0.5 mg/kg with better accuracy, it was necessary to use the rAChE; in that case, an I% of 26.3% was obtained, which is well above the minimum detectable inhibition of the method (8%). Moreover, the recovery of the samples spiked with Didivane was comparable to that obtained with the pure molecule, dichlorvos. The recovery data suggest that the buffer used in the extraction protocol allowed a repeatable recovery at an applicable contamination level of both dichlorvos in pure form and dichlorvos in commercial formulation (Didivane), thus avoiding the use of a polar organic solvent such as methanol or acetonitrile, which may influence enzyme activity and sensor stability. Despite aqueous-based extraction using whole wheat kernels has been demonstrated as effective to detect dichlorvos, the procedure might lead to inadequate homogeneity of testing samples. Moreover, aqueous solvents cannot be used for extraction of ground wheat samples due to the formation of a slurry, preventing filtration of adequate amounts of extract. To apply the electrochemical method to ground wheat samples, as generally required in food analysis, a non-aqueous extraction solvent was required.",

The immunosensor in the direct format was selected for the determination of OTA in wheat. Samples were extracted with aqueous acetonitrile and the extract analyzed directly by the assay without clean-up. The I 50 in real samples was 0.2 mg/L corresponding to 1.6 mg/ kg in the wheat sample with an LOD of 0.4 mg/kg (calculated as blank signal--3s). Within-and between-assay variability were less than 5% and 10%, respectively. A good correlation (r \u00bc 0.9992) was found by comparative analysis of naturally contaminated wheat samples using this assay and an HPLC/immunoaffinity clean-up method based on the AOAC Official Method 2000.03 for the determination of OTA in barley as reported in Table 29 .4. Fig. 29 .8. Differential pulse voltammograms obtained for the samples assayed (one representative voltammogram for each of the spiked levels, from 0.5 to 15 mg/kg). Competition blank signal is relative to OTA level \u00bc 0, blank signal is OTA-free wheat extract with no OTA-AP conjugate used in the assay. Reprinted with permission from Ref. [75] . DNA electrochemical sensors were developed for the detection of specific sequences of F. culmorum. The sensing principle of the proposed application was based on the affinity interaction between complementary strand of nucleic acids: the probe was immobilized on the sensor surface and the target analyte was free in solution. The hybridization is followed using an SWV. The direct label-free detection was accomplished by monitoring the guanine oxidation peak of the target sequence. This approach rely on the use of inosine-modified (guanine-free) probes. In fact, the nonelectroactive base inosine still forms a specific base pair with the cytosine residue. This results in a flat baseline (in the potential region +0.9-1 V versus pseudo Ag/AgCl reference electrode) for the probe-modified electrode. The duplex formation was thus detected through the appearance of the guanine oxidation peak of the target sequence, following hybridization. The use of such a label-free biosensor for the detection of post PCR samples can improve the safety, since the indicators are usually toxic or carcinogenic compounds, and save time. The sensors were first applied to synthetic complementary oligonucleotides, and then to PCR-amplified samples of F. culmorum. The specificity of the genosensors was tested in the presence of different amounts of non-complementary PCR sample. The crucial part of this work was to understand how to increase the occurrence of the hybridization reaction between the probe and the denatured single strand of PCR product. In this application, the probe selection was carried out using a computational approach. Computational tools can greatly improve the rational design of the ligands by exploiting different knowledge about the structure and the chemical properties of the target molecule. The computational run was performed by fixing the folding temperature at 371C with a concentration of sodium of 330 mM to fit the experimental conditions. The other parameters were left as default. An important purpose of this work was to evaluate the relation between experimental and computational data. Therefore the probe selection was focused on the study of the steric hindrance of the simulated secondary structure by emphasizing as primary parameter the intrastrand hydrogen bonds within the PCR single strand. For that reason, we selected the probes complementary to the PCR single-strand regions with different intra-strand hydrogen bonds as reported below (Fig. 29.9 ):",

The latter procedure performed using solvent extraction allowed a complete recovery of the pesticide from grounded kernels. The procedure that can be used in a laboratory environment as screening method allowed the detection at one order of magnitude lower (0.05 mg/kg) than in the former protocol using wild-type eeAChE.
