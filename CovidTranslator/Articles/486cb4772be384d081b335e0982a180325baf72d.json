The two principle types of cytoplasmic RNA granules are stress granules (SGs), which contain stalled translation initiation complexes, and processing bodies (P-bodies, PBs), which concentrate factors involved in mRNA degradation. RNA granules are associated with gene silencing of transcripts, thus, viruses repress RNA granule functions to favor replication. This review discusses the breadth of viral interactions with cytoplasmic RNA granules, focusing on mechanisms that modulate the functions of RNA granules and that typically promote viral replication. Currently mechanisms for virus manipulation of RNA granules can be loosely grouped into three non-exclusive categories; i) cleavage of key RNA granule factors, ii) regulation of PKR activation and iii) co-opting RNA granule factors for new roles in viral replication. Viral repression of RNA granules supports productive infection by inhibiting their gene silencing functions and counteracting their role in linking stress sensing with innate immune activation.",

As such, many disciplines of biology are now acknowledging the importance of RNA granules. RNA granules consist of condensates of mRNA and RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) found in nuclear and cytoplasmic compartments and are believed to form by dynamic reversible condensation or aggregation of key RBPs, particularly Ras-GAP-SH3-binding protein (G3BP1) and T-cell restricted intracellular antigen (TIA1). All aspects of mRNA biogenesis and expression are regulated by RBPs, including splicing, transport, subcellular localization, silencing, translation activation and RNA decay. Several of these steps involve cytoplasmic RNA granules, including mRNA transport, silencing and decay and many RBPs key to these processes are also found in RNA granules. Nuclear RNA granules include PML bodies, cajal bodies, nuclear speckles, nuclear stress bodies and others (20, 74) and have diverse functions ranging from stress responses to processing mRNA and non-coding RNAs. This review focuses on cytoplasmic RNA granules and the viruses that modify them.",

SGs and PBs each contain unique marker proteins, however, many proteins are found in both SGs and PBs such as eIF4E, TTP, Ago2, APOBEC3, PCBP2 and others (53, 55) . Based on distributions of unique and shared marker proteins in the granules, a continuum of RNA granules has been described in yeast, C. elegans and other species that span the gulf between SG and PBs (18) . Importantly, different types of RNA granules such as SGs and PBs contain many unique components associated with unique functions, but also contain some common protein constituents.",

A cytoplasmic mRNA cycle exists where mRNPs are in continual flux between active polysomes and these two silenced compartments (26, 56, 81) . SGs and PBs transiently interact with each other, they rapidly exchange mRNPs with surrounding cytoplasm and can share certain protein components and specific mRNA moieties (3, 18, 22, 55, 109) .

At this point little precise information is available concerning the identity of mRNA transcripts included in various types of granules, though it is thought that certain stress-active transcripts such as heat shock protein mRNAs are excluded from SGs during heat stress. Mechanisms to distinguish these transcripts from others included in SGs are not known.

This indicates PKR may sense formation of stress granules per se through a unique mechanism of activation (102) . A similar activation of PKR by Dcp1a also occurs that may involve the PKR activator PACT (28) . Once activated, PKR represses translation via eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation and can signal downstream to several innate immune effectors such as transcription factor nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kB) that functions in many inflammatory responses (38) . PKR also interacts with the IkB kinase complex, promoting dissociation of IkB from NF-kB and NF-kB transcriptional activation (16, 39) .",

Overexpression of G3BP1 in CVB3-infected cells results in marked decreases in VP1 protein expression, and viral titers; in contrast, siRNA knockdown of G3BP1 resulted in modest increases in viral protein and RNA levels (35) . The former could result simply from SG-induced activation of PKR (102), however, siRNA knockdown results support a more direct antiviral role. Similarly, EMCV disrupts SGs via cleavage of G3BP1 and expression of cleavage-resistant mutant G3BP1 restored SGs and enhanced IFN and cytokines production late in infection. Knockdown of G3BP1 also blocked SG formation, reduced IFN production and increased virus output (85) . Together this supports an antiviral role of either SGs or G3BP1 but does not distinguish them.",

SG formation induced by mengovirus was PKR-dependent, suggesting that the PKR axis of SG activation is important.

In this way, SGs may also be important in priming neighboring cells against infection. SGs may also serve as a platform to link innate immune activation with other stress signaling pathways. Supporting this tenet, the stress-responsive MAPK JNK is activated in a nonclassical pathway during stress granule formation involving a novel scaffold JNK-binding protein, WDR62. In this activation, both JNK and WDR62, are recruited to SGs by overexpression of SG nucleating proteins, but arsenite stress sends only WDR62 to SG while JNK localizes to PBs, indicating SGs induced by alternate pathways signal JNK differently (124) .",

However, mammalian cells also have multiple strategies to cope with the myriad of virus replication schemes and viral assaults on innate immune defenses. SGs may play prominent roles in limiting virus translation and replication and perhaps buying more time for cells to activate other antiviral signaling pathways that decide cell fate. Different consequences of viral infection on SG formation have been observed: viral suppression of SG formation, induction of transient SG assembly, induction of stable SGs and oscillation between SG assembly and disassembly during the course of infection. Most viral infections will hinder SG formation at some point in the infection cycle, indicating manipulation of RNA granules is critical for viruses.",

            "text": "The actual mechanisms for SG formation are poorly defined but canonically start with translation suppression via phosphorylation of eIF2\u03b1, inhibition of eIF4A helicase function or cleavage of eIF4G (4, 55, 56, 76) , that forces accumulation of stalled translation initiation complexes (Fig. 1) . Activation or overexpression of key SG nucleating proteins such as G3BP1, TIA1, TIAR, TDP-43, and caprin1, can also drive SG assembly but specifically how they function alone or together is not understood (54) . Transport of stalled mRNPs to sites of RNA granule assembly also requires mobility on microtubules and post-translational modification of factors (68, 87, 88) . The actual molecular mechanisms driving mRNP aggregation into large structures while also allowing dynamic exchange of components has been elusive. Recent advances suggest transitions from dispersed to condensed phases drives formation of \"liquid droplets\" or condensed \"gel phases\" that can be considered dynamic RNA/protein droplets (13, 42, 49, 54, 125) . A key molecular interaction driving the process may be multivalent weak binding interactions between key mRNP proteins that contain multiple proline-rich motifs, SRC homology domains or other regions of low complexity amino acid sequences (63) . Fused in sarcoma (FUS), TDP-43, G3BP1, TIA1 and many other RNA binding proteins found in SGs have suitable weak interaction domains (9, 13, 42, 49) . Post-translational modifications may figure prominently in regulation of these weak interactions and have been implicated in RNA granule assembly. For example, G3BP1 is phosphorylated and arginine methylated and TDP-43 arginine methylation and ubiquitination regulate SG assembly or coaggregation. Further, decoration of ribosomal proteins with O-linked N-acetylglucosamine is required for SG formation (15, 25, 88, 118) . Virus interference in any of these steps may be sufficient to block SG formation. The discussion below is categorized into non-exclusive classes based on mechanism of virus interaction with the RNA granule machinery, namely (1) cleavage of RNA granule factors, (2) control of PKR function, and (3) co-opting of RNA granules.",

To date, only picornaviruses such as poliovirus (PV), coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3), and encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV) have been found to cleave SG components, using similar mechanisms involving their conserved 3Cproteinases (3C pro ). In general, these viruses induce transient SG assembly where SGs form at the early phase of infection (~2-3 hpi), but active disassembly of SGs occurs during the mid phase of infection (~3-8 hpi) (35, 85, 127) . These viruses disassemble SG through cleavage of the critical SG nucleating protein G3BP1 by the viral 3C proteinase at the glutamine residue at amino acid 326. The crucial role of G3BP1 in SG formation was demonstrated through rescue of SG formation late in poliovirus infection from expression of 3C pro cleavage resistant G3PB1 mutant (Q326E) (127) . The C-terminal fragment of G3BP1 further inhibits SG formation and promotes CVB3 viral replication, although several fragments of G3BP1 can inhibit SG formation (35, 118) . A partly conflicting study reported SG stained with TIA1 persist in PV-infected cells at late times post infection (98) , but these foci are compositionally distinct from bonafide SGs since they exclude key functional SG markers eIF3, eIF4G, PABP and mRNA (128) . Thus, poliovirus directed cleavage of G3BP1 unlinks TIA1 aggregation, which still occurs, from assembly of stalled translation complexes in RNA granules. The residual TIA1-stained foci do not correlate with translational repression and accumulation of stalled translation initiation complex that define functional SGs. These findings imply that the composition and function of SGs can be different in virus-infected cells and SGs cannot be defined by use of only limited SG markers.",

However mutant \u03bcNS (78) (79) no longer binds core protein (\u03bb2) and is defective in supporting virus replication (19) , so the link between \u03bcNS localization to SG and virus replication remain unclear. However, PKR and the other individual eIF2\u03b1 kinases are not solely required for SG induction by MRV, indicating that SG formation requires multiple eIF2\u03b1 kinase signaling or another mechanism(100).

Interestingly, HCV induces PKR-dependent SG formation but that is subsequently counteracted by DNA damage-inducible protein 34 (GADD34), the cofactor of phosphatase 1 which dephosphorylates of eIF2\u03b1. Multi-day HCV infections involve oscillating SG formation, temporarily assembling and disassembling SGs by rapidly switching eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation status (104) . Disassembly of SG allows relief of translation restriction to allow viral protein synthesis and to maintain prolonged cell survival and chronic infection. In this regard, PKR and GADD34 are important gatekeepers for regulating cellular homeostasis linked to cell fate decisions. HCV also limits PKR accessibility and sensing of viral dsRNA by forming a nuclease-free membrane-wrapped vacuole compartment (93) .",

Although it is still unclear whether these granules disassemble during the infection for either virus, SGs may restrict TGEV infection. Ablation of the SG constituent protein PTB enhanced virus replication, whereas PTB overexpression restricted virus output. MHV also replicates more efficiently in non-phosphorylatable eIF2\u03b1 S51A mutant MEFs that cannot easily form SGs. The type of granules that form in both MHC and TGEV infected cells has not yet been rigorously determined since sole use of TIA1/TIAR as SG markers may not reliable (128) .

Semliki Forest Virus (SFV) induces eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation and forms bona fide SGs at early times of infection (4 hpi). While infection progresses, SFV hijacks G3BP1 from SG and relocates it into viral replication complexes (RC) via interaction with C-terminal repeat domains of nsP3, simultaneously disassembling SGs. At this point SG formation is blocked in the presence of pateamine A, an eIF2\u03b1-independent SG inducer (77, 92) . Chikungunya virus applies similar mechanism to sequester G3BP1 and redirects it into novel cytoplasmic foci that lack the SG marker eIF3 (34) . SFV also contains a translational enhancer near the initiating AUG codon that permits viral RNA to escape translational repression from by eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation. However, efficient translation of viral RNAs by this enhancer also facilitates disassembly of SGs during infection (77, 92) . The benefit of co-opting G3BP1 to viral RCs still needs to be explored, but maintaining SGs by mutation of the G3BP1interacting region in nsP3 dampens viral replication (34) .",

A low proportion of wild type MV infected cells could form SGs containing G3BP1 and ADAR1, a nuclear shuttling protein that is a weak PKR antagonist. In contrast, infecting ADAR1 depleted cells with wild type MV robustly stimulated PKR activation, SG formation and IFN-\u03b2 induction, suggesting that ADAR1 is a SG inhibitor that antagonizes PKR activity. Further experiments also verified that the p150 isoform of ADAR1 drives this process through deaminase catalytic activity (89) .

G3BP1 knockdown in RSV-infected cells resulted in a 10-fold reduction in RSV titer, however this was mostly a delay in replication kinetics (65, 66) . These data are reminiscent of results from the vaccinia virus system (see below) where, under specific conditions, SG-like aggregates correlate with virus improved replication. The RSV-induced granules were not probed for presence of multiple SG markers so their identity as bona fide SGs versus novel virus-induced G3BP1 or TIA1-containing foci are unresolved. Further, RSV was noted to deplete another SG protein HuR from G3BP1 foci, suggesting G3BP1-containing foci are defective in terms of SG composition. A contrary study using the RSV system showed that SG formation was inhibited, specifically by the trailer region of the viral genome (43) . However an unspecified eIF3 subunit was used as the sole SG marker, leaving the possibility that SG-like proviral structures form, which lack that eIF3 subunit, in a trailer-dependent manner. Nevertheless, the finding was consistent with earlier findings that the related Sendai virus trailer also blocks SG formation during infection (46) . To date, herpes simplex virus (HSV), and vaccinia virus (VV) are the only DNA viruses reported to regulate SG assembly. During acute infection HSV-2 actively represses SG formation that is phospho-eIF2\u03b1-dependent but does not restrict formation of SG foci induced by eIF4A inhibitor pateamine A. In this case phosphorylated eIF2\u03b1 is found to accumulate at 10 hpi without assembling SGs. The pateamine A-induced SGs were atypical, containing G3BP1 and PABP but were deficient in TIA1. TIA1 was instead partitioned into non-canonical nuclear foci containing Sam68. These data suggest that TIA1 is co-opted into novel roles that augment HSV-2 viral replication or transcription, similar to the examples for Dengue virus and WNV.",

Indeed, VV transcription is regulated by caprin1 and G3BP1 (51) . Further, translation factor and SG component eIF4G1 is recruited to single strand DNA in factories by protein I3, a ssDNA binding viral factor (134) . Translation initiation factor foci that formed in and around virus factories were shown to be devoid of the translational suppressor TIA1(121).

Flavivirus such as West Nile virus and Dengue virus that bind the SG protein TIA1 on viral RNA, also sequester many P-body constituent proteins, including DDX3, DDX6, GW182, Xrn1 and Lsm1, near or within perinuclear viral replication centers (21) while the numbers of PBs in cells decrease (30) (Fig. 3) . Evidence is building that PB constituents may directly bind viral RNA to aid recruitment to viral replication factories and may functionally promote RNA replication. Depletion of GW182, Lsm1, and DDX3 by siRNA knockdown reduces virus WNV RNA output (21) and knockdown of DDX6 reduces Dengue virus output (123) . Dengue virus genomic RNA has a conserved stem loop structure in the 3\u2032 UTR that binds DDX6 (Rck/p54); this feature is adjacent to the unstructured region that binds SG proteins G3BP1 and USP10 (123) . DDX6 is proposed to mask and unwind mRNAs and organize structures within PBs (32), thus it is possible that it also plays unwinding/organizational roles in viral RNA replication or packaging.",

The problem is partly solved by HCV partitioning of host RNAi and viral factors into distinct cytoplasmic compartments. Viral RNA replication requires recruitment of Ago2 and miRNA-122 to lipid droplets, whereas silencing of HCV RNA by siRNA and Ago2 requires interaction with P-bodies (14) . Normal RNAi biochemical roles are also separated from virus functions; DDX6 silencing decreased HCV replication and translation, but not the ability of miR-122 to stimulate HCV translation or promote HCV RNA accumulation. DDX6 does not have a role in the function of miR-122, and it appears that DDX6 and miR-122 modulate HCV through distinct pathways (45) .

Although some IAP mRNA localized to PBs, viral Gag protein was targeted to the endoplasmic reticulum where IAP buds (70) . MOV10 also inhibits IAP reverse transcription and retrotransposition, however this inhibition is independent of PBs (71).",

At this initial stage, a broad picture has appeared of what viruses may manipulate SGs and PBs. There is now a superficial sense how such manipulations may occur, but the molecular details of mechanisms are mostly sparse. When mammalian cells encounter stress situations the complex reprograming of gene expression that occurs is mandatory for survival and RNA granules play key roles in this process, organizing the dynamically changing pools of active versus silenced mRNPs. Viruses are potent stress inducers and have always needed to cope with cellular environments that sense and react to their presence. Thus, as we have summarized above, viruses have evolved a pleathora of schemes to block, subvert or reprogram the RNA granule responses for viral survival or more; perhaps cleverly supporting replication or assembly. required? How will viruses fit into these scenarios mechanistically? Will these mechanisms provide new antiviral drug targets?",

Since RNA granules cannot be isolated and purified, major questions remain as to the identity and scope of mRNAs that become included in granules and the extent to which they could trap viral transcripts if virus countermeasures were absent. Do SGs and PBs serve as powerful sites for general translational repression or viral RNA decay that must be counteracted? The various types of virus-induced SGs will have unique constituents compared to SGs induced by environmental insults such as arsenite or heat shock. Do the virus-induced SGs have unique functions? For viruses that co-opt SG components into novel virus-induced foci, the roles of these proteins, if any, in virus replication and package is unclear and require investigation. When viruses relocalize contain translation factors, are these functional for translation or other purposes? Does G3BP1 perform mechanistic functions for some viruses or is it just a passenger swept into the locale of new virus-directed processes? Since the real biochemical function(s) of many of RNA granule proteins like G3BP1 is complex and enigmatic, these answers may not be easily forthcoming. However, viruses are excellent probes of molecular biology so their study may unlock secrets of RNA granule biology that might remain veiled to other approaches.",

            "text": "Lastly, it is now clear that SG formation has many consequences to cellular metabolism beyond translational arrest; that crosstalk with apopotic and innate immune sytems by recruiting select group of signaling proteins is critically important. These exciting research areas are garnering increased attention and may reveal that RNA granules serve as major platforms linking stress signals with cell fate determination and activation of innate antiviral mechanisms as part of an integrated stress response. Since stress responses and innate immunity likely crosstalk at multiple levels, it is possible that aspects of RNA granule biology could be exploited in the future for broad-spectrum antiviral strategies. PKR dependent stress granule assembly pathway, innate immune factors that enter stress granules and interference by RNA virus modulation of PKR. Virus infection causes stress at multiple levels by restricting translation through activation of eIF2 kinases, principally PKR, or by causing cleavage or inactivation of other translation initiation factors. These translation insults convert active polysome mRNPs into stalled translation initiation complex mRNPs containing 40S ribosome subunits, initiation factors and mRNAs (boxed). A complex series of events involving nucleation of multiple stress granule proteins such as G3BP1, Tia-1/ TIAR, TDRD3, FUS, TDP43 and HDAC6 plus transport of mRNP complexes on microtubules leads to aggregates of translation initiation complex mRNPs in stress granules. Reovirus and rotavirus can repress SGs, but mechanisms are not known, points of interaction of other viruses with this scheme are indicated. Note that many viruses control PKR activation; only those discussed in the text are indicated. Virus blockade and co-opting of stress granule responses. A. Deconvolution immunofluorescence microscopy image of SGs and PBs in uninfected oxidatively stressed U20S cells stably expressing GFP-G3BP. Boxed inset shows a typical SG (green) with a closely associated PB (magenta) and enlarged images below show individual channel antibody stains for SG markers Tia1 (red) and G3BP (green), and PB marker RCK/p54/ DDX6 (magenta). Blue is DAPI stain for nuclear DNA. B. Specific points/proteins where viruses inhibit or divert the RNA granule assembly pathway are shown. Picornavirus 3Cproteinase cleaves the critical SG nucleating protein G3BP1. Several viruses co-opt G3BP and divert it into novel virus-induced foci. HCV diverts G3BP1 into replication/assembly complexes together with HCV core, ns5A and ns5B proteins that also associate with lipid droplets. HCVcomplexes also contain many P-body components detailed in Fig 3. Flaviviruses divert G3BP1 (with USP10 and caprin1) and TIA1/TIAR to replication complexes by binding the host proteins on virus RNAs. Junin virus (possibly N and G proteins) recruits G3BP1 into replication complexes with translation factors eIF4G and eIF4A. Alphaviruses recruit G3BP1 into viral replication complexes via direct interaction viral protein nsP3. Vesicular stomatitis virus diverts Tia1 and PCBP2 to virus complexes. Pathways of P-body disruption by viruses. P-bodies form via a complex series of events involving remodeling mRNPs by stripping of initiation factors and ribosome subunits, association with GW182, undergoing Pan2/3-mediated deadenylation, microtubule transport, and association with other RNA decay factors (e.g., Xrn1, Dcp1a, DDX6 (Rck/p54), GW182 and Lsm components of the exosome), and finally condensation in P-bodies. HCV co-opts many PB components into novel viral replication/assembly foci with viral core protein that also contain some SG components (e.g. G3BP, Fig. 2 ",
