Based on the published literature, we concluded that singleplex [one target per polymerase chain reaction (PCR) reaction], reverse transcription real-time PCR (RT-qPCR) has so far been shown to be more sensitive than multiplex (multiple targets per PCR reaction) testing and also that standardvolume singleplex RT-qPCR appears to have better sensitivity than low-volume singleplex RT-qPCR for respiratory virus detection. [7] [8] [9] For example, Deng et al [7] detected viral pathogens in 45.9% of respiratory specimens using a commercial multiplex method and in 62.6% of these specimens using singleplex RT-qPCR assays. Gadsby et al [8] compared three viral detection methodologies: FA and culture, singleplex RT-qPCR assays, and another commercial multiplex method. These investigators found at least one respiratory viral pathogen in 13.6% of specimens by FA and culture (combined), in 46.2% by the commercial method, and in 49.7% by RT-qPCR. [8] The RT-qPCR assays were considered to be the gold standard in this paper, and the sensitivity and specificity of the commercial multiplex method were reported as 78.8% and 99.6%, respectively, compared with RT-qPCR.",

Our evaluation of the stability of the PCR assays in the panel was also a limitation, since for logistic and financial reasons, we were able to assess the stability of the control assay for up to a 2-month period only, and we did not evaluate if the assay remained stable beyond this time period.

Ethical approval: Ethics approval was obtained from the Children's Hospital of Eastern Ontario Research Ethics Board for testing of anonymized residual aliquots of nasopharyngeal aspirate samples that were otherwise to be discarded. Competing interest: One of the authors (Slinger R) previously had a mutual confidentiality agreement with the company Life Technologies Inc. that expired in 2010. No funding or support of any type was received from the company for this study. The other authors have no competing interests. Contributors: Ellis C, Barrowman N, and Langill J analyzed the data. Misir A, Hui C, Jabbour M, Bowes J and Slinger R conceived and designed the study. All authors interpreted data, prepared and reviewed the manuscript.",

Molecular proficiency testing samples [Quality Control for Molecular Diagnostics Samples (QCMD) Past Panels (Qnostics, Glasgow, UK)] were therefore studied. These panels contain serially diluted mock samples and provided a means of comparing the RT-qPCR singleplex assay results with those obtained by a large number of participating laboratories using a range of molecular detection methods. Past panels tested were: QCMDBPDNA09 (Bordetella pertussis and Bordetella parapertussis), CP.MP09 (Chlamydophila pneumoniae and For two of the targets, bocavirus and coronavirus HKU1, proficiency testing samples were unavailable, so the performance of these assays in comparison with other laboratories could not be assessed.World J Pediatr, Vol 12 No 2 .
