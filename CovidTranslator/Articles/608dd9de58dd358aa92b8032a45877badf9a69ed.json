We used a standardised form to obtain demographic, clinical, and laboratory data, which were anonymised. Enterovirus PCR testing was done in blood and CSF specimens. Findings Between June 1, 2015, and Oct 31, 2015, and between June 1, 2016, and Oct 31, 2016, we enrolled 822 patients, of whom 672 had enterovirus PCR testing done in blood and CSF specimens.

[3] [4] [5] Paediatricians are also confronted frequently with young infants with fever without source or sepsis-like diseases. These febrile illnesses account for 3\u00b74-13\u00b76% of cases seen in emergency departments. 6 Symptoms can result either from severe bacterial infection requiring admission to hospital and empirical antibiotic treatments or, most typically, from benign and spontaneously resolving viral infection; therefore, diagnosis is a challenge. Additional molecular tests are needed to speed up diagnosis of conditions asso ciated with enterovirus infections. 5 Several studies have evaluated testing blood specimens, [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] but as yet no assessment has been done in a large cohort of paediatric patients.",

We used the search terms \"enterovirus\", \"nonpolio enterovirus\", \"meningitis\", \"viral meningitis\", \"aseptic meningitis\", \"enterovirus meningitis\", \"acute meningitis\", \"sepsis\", \"sepsis-like disease\", \"fever\", \"fever without source\", \"genome detection\", \"enterovirus detection\", \"enterovirus RT-PCR\", \"molecular detection\", \"viremia\", \"viremic\", \"virus load\", \"blood\", \"plasma\", and \"cerebrospinal fluid\". We also reviewed references from relevant articles not identified in the original search. Our search identified 12 studies in which enterovirus detection was reported in blood and CSF. Most studies were retrospective, the number of patients recruited varied between 11 and 34, and blood samples were not obtained in all patients whose CSF was tested. Two studies of 80 and 122 patients aged 90 days or younger with enterovirus infection were referenced to discuss our enterovirus detection frequency in the blood and CSF of febrile infants. In a study of 75 patients aged 16 years or younger with aseptic meningitis, 76% had enterovirus detected in blood samples by PCR. However, in that study, age groups were not analysed separately. In all these studies, symptom duration before lumbar puncture or venepuncture, and time between CSF and blood collection, were not recorded.",

To our knowledge, our study is the first to show that sensitivity of enterovirus detection in blood samples is related to patients' age and clinical presentation. Detection of enterovirus was more frequent in blood samples than in CSF specimens of newborn babies and infants with fever without source or sepsis-like diseases, and it was less frequent in blood samples of patients with suspected meningitis. Furthermore, our study showed that enterovirus positivity in blood was related inversely to patient's age with meningitis.",

Guidelines for biological management of patients aged 2 years or younger with febrile illness in the emergency department need to be reconsidered. When blood is sampled for a complete blood count, an additional blood tube should be obtained for enterovirus PCR testing, which can now be done sufficiently rapidly to have a real effect on infection management. PCR testing of blood samples done in routine practice could result in a more accurate assessment of the actual number of positive cases in patients with suspected meningitis, sepsis-like diseases, and fever without source. A positive enterovirus diagnosis could affect beneficially decisions about a patient's management, by reducing antibiotic or antiviral therapy, avoiding ancillary tests, lowering hospital-related costs, and allowing earlier discharge.",

Laboratory findings comprised the date and time at which biological specimens were taken, CSF and full blood count characteristics, C-reactive protein assay, and the results of other bacteriological and virological testing of samples recorded by biologists. Symptom duration was the interval between onset of symptoms and venepuncture (and lumbar puncture, if indicated). We estimated the onset of symptoms as either 8 am, 2 pm, 8 pm, or 2 am when symptoms were recorded in the morning, afternoon, evening, and night, respectively. CSF protein concentration was classified as normal if it was 0\u00b79 g/L or lower for newborn babies (aged \u226428 days) and 0\u00b745 g/L or lower for older children (aged >28 days).

These data suggest that viraemia occurs early and is of short duration, a finding rarely noted in other reports and only with small patient populations. 21, 22 In some biological diagnostic practices, CSF PCR testing is done only in patients with pleocytosis. In our study, we did lumbar puncture in 675 patients, of whom 371 did not have pleocytosis (data not shown). In these patients, however, enterovirus was detected in CSF (n=70) and blood (n=98). Without detection of enterovirus in blood or CSF samples, these patients without pleocytosis would have been discharged without aetiological diagnosis. Thus, the diagnostic practice to do enterovirus testing solely in patients with pleocytosis can lead to enterovirus infections being missed. Moreover, 144 patients had enterovirus PCR testing done only in blood samples, of whom 40 (28%) had enterovirus infection-mostly newborn babies or infants with fever without source.

Pleocytosis was noted in 44 (38%) of 116 patients with enterovirus viraemia, mainly those with suspected meningitis (data not shown). Dagan and colleagues 21 reported an inverse relation between viraemia and pleocytosis. The number of lymphocytes and monocytes was significantly lower in patients with viraemia than in those without viraemia. This finding and earlier data 21,26 suggest a detrimental effect of enterovirus infection on populations of mononuclear leucocytes during viraemia. This effect can be caused by virus replication in mononuclear leucocytes, because some enterovirus genotypes can replicate in vitro in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells. 27, 28 Accordingly, the concentrations of circulating mono nuclear cells at different ages and the ability of entero virus genotypes to replicate in these cells can affect the sensitivity of blood enterovirus detection.",

Second, virology management (including detection of viruses other than enterovirus) and bacteriology management varied between the 16 hospitals taking part. In 340 (41%) of 822 patients, no diagnosis was established, a figure similar to that reported by Ahmad and colleagues (43%). 11 Third, four different RT-PCR assays were used in our multicentre study. It is unlikely that this variability affected the overall results, because methods used are assessed annually by an external quality assess ment programme, and all yielded correct results.",

The high frequency of detection of enterovirus in blood samples from very young patients with fever without source and sepsis-like disease suggests that enterovirus febrile illnesses are underdiagnosed. It is important to reconsider the guidelines for biological management of patients aged 2 years or younger with febrile illness in emergency departments, to obtain-at the time of blood sampling-an additional tube for enterovirus PCR testing, which can be done sufficiently rapidly to have a real effect on management. A positive enterovirus blood diagnosis could beneficially affect patient management decisions by reducing antibiotic or antiviral therapy, avoiding ancillary tests, lowering hospital-related costs, and allowing earlier discharge. Blood enterovirus genome can also be used as an alternative biomarker in case of contraindications for CSF sampling and failure of lumbar puncture.",
