            "text": "Recent disasters have clearly demonstrated the need for increased surge capacity on the part of all elements of out-ofhospital, hospital, and emergency department (ED) systems. 1 Although billions of dollars have been spent to improve local, regional, and national preparedness, the preparedness efforts have focused on systems issues, such as statewide planning and coordination, interagency communications, and scene management, triage, and transport. The severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak raised the specter of entire hospitals becoming disabled because of quarantine and therefore unavailable to respond to the needs of the general public. SARS also introduced North American and other countries' governments and health care leaders to the modern concept of a massive population of acutely ill patients requiring high-level care during a short period, with the potential to overwhelm hospital ED and inpatient resources. More recently, concern about management options for possible human cases associated with H5N1 (avian) influenza is prompting a further reevaluation of our system capacities and infection control procedures. 2 The threat of an epidemic outbreak of an acute infectious disease or of a large population exposure to a biological or chemical agent also challenges current systems in terms of \"surge capacity,\" the ability to rapidly increase capacity to provide effective, if limited, care to a significantly increased volume of acute care patients. The need to protect health care providers from possible infection, exposure, or contamination and to limit the potential for disease-causing agents to spread to other patients requires additional capacity. In addition, in case of mass casualty or epidemic in the community, effective containment systems in which suspected cases can be isolated are required even as patients are receiving lifesaving care. Currently, EDs in Canada, the United States, and elsewhere are challenged by large numbers of acutely ill patients and reduced numbers of inpatient beds, leading to ED crowding. Crowding is identified as a root cause of ambulance diversions, and even the relatively small increase in patient volume associated with the traditional influenza season increases the amount of time EDs are unable to accept patients. 3 Little attention to date has been paid to the potential response for mass casualty caused by organisms capable of human-to-human spread through airborne contact. Although the likelihood of such an epidemic is unknown, recent analyses related to possible human-to-human spread of the H5N1 influenza virus suggest catastrophic effects on individuals and the health care system. The Government Accounting Office has found that many hospitals lack the capacity to respond to largescale infectious disease outbreaks and lack adequate equipment and isolation facilities. 4 EDs and hospitals generally have limited isolation capability, and much of this is concentrated in tertiary care facilities and major teaching hospitals. There exists no feasible contingency plan through which a large-scale escalation of ED and hospital isolation potential could be provided on short notice, and the construction of permanent, large-capacity isolation facilities is cost-prohibitive.",

Total negative pressure isolation is therefore proposed as a realistic alternative to hospital closure or quarantine at times of greatly increased need.

Garner 8 reviewed the types of isolation precautions taken in hospitals: handwashing and gloving, patient placement, transport of infected patients, meals, respiratory protection, eye protection, face shields, gowns and protective apparel, patient care equipment and articles, linen and laundry, dishes, glasses, cups, and eating utensils. Standard precautions are used for all patients: airborne precautions for those infected with organisms of 5 m or smaller size, droplet precautions when larger particles are involved and pose little risk of airborne transmission, and contact precautions when skin-toskin transmission can occur. Precautions appropriate for common organisms are found in Figure E1 (available online at http://www.annemergmed.com), and a more complete listing is provided online by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. 8 Of the interventions implemented to reduce transmission of infection, handwashing and glove use are believed to be the most important interventions to help reduce",
