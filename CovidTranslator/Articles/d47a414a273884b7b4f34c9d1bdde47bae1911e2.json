As we know, preparedness for the epidemic spread is a primary public health concern for any health department. Epidemic reporting of a disease is a fundamental event in understanding two key parameters in epidemiology, namely, epidemic diffusion within a population and growth at a population level. Normally, for a real-time epidemic, the reporting of cases is rarely complete, especially if the epidemic is new or symptoms are unknown or are yet to be discovered. For viruses with shorter incubation periods without virus shedding during the incubation period, any delay in reporting or lack of reporting could lead to a severe epidemic due to the absence of control measures. For example, for the Ebola virus, the average incubation period is between 2 and 21 days, and an individual diagnosed with the Ebola virus does not spread the virus to others during this period. If some of these individuals with Ebola are not diagnosed (and hence not reported to health care facilities) then after 21 days, these individuals will (unknowingly) spread the virus to others. There are other viruses whose incubation period is short but they are contagious during this period, for example, influenza. Even for epidemics with established symptoms, reporting could be nowhere close to complete. The impact of reporting on epidemic surveillance can then be theoretically measured ( Rao, 2012 ) .",

The observations by Bartlett (1957) on population size and the fraction of measles infecting people over various time points provided a new basis for using stochastic models for understanding retrospectively the seasonality of epidemics.

Then one of our central ideas is in determining which of these fractional waves (as described in section 4) is closest to the true epidemic. Usually data/information to construct a couple of such fractional wavelets could be observed in an emerging epidemic, say ( a ( t ), a ( t ))} and ( b ( t ), b ( t )), so the first step is to construct these pairs of wavelets. These fractional wavelets are constructed on partial data (partial in the sense that observed data on disease cases in an emerging epidemic is not complete). The question we are attempting is: can we predict ( ( t ), ( t )) from either one of or from both of the fractional wavelets? [Note: There is no terminology of \"fractional wavelet\" in the literature, but we are calling ( a ( t ), a ( t )) and ( b ( t ), b ( t )) the fractional wavelets].

Because we are dealing with true versus reported disease cases, this measure (a set of points each representing a distance between true and observed cases) could be termed the error in the reporting of disease cases. These kinds of measures will be very helpful (such measures after further filtration can be useful for practical epidemiologists). Instead of constructing wavelets for the overall epidemic duration, we will construct wavelets within intervals [ t 0 , t 1 ] and (t i \u22121 , t i ] for i = 2 , 3 , . . . , n described as in Fig. 4.3 . As the reported cases within an interval improve, described as in Fig. 4 .5 , the wavelet configuration improves.

An improvement of reported cases is ascertained from the data obtained in the subsequent time intervals. One way to update this is from future epidemic cases that were infected and/or diagnosed for the period (t i \u22121 , t i ] but made available during any of the intervals (t i , t i +1 ] for i = 2 , 3 , . . . , n \u2212 1 . That is, the sum of the epidemic cases that were reported during (t i \u22121 , t i ] and those reported during each of the future time intervals (t i , t i +1 ] for i = 2 , 3 , . . . , n \u2212 1 and that belong to the interval (t i \u22121 , t i ] will be treated as an improved number of reported cases for the interval (t i \u22121 , t i ] . We will update the reported number of cases in a previous interval from the future available reported cases that were associated with the previous time interval. Hence the evolution of the data for the interval (t i \u22121 , t i ] can be used to construct graphs as shown in Fig. 4 .5 . Since this evolution is assumed to be observed for a long period, it is also assumed that G i will be approximately convergent to G c i . As an epidemic progresses, we will update the intervals (t i \u22121 , t i ] with newly available information during (t i , t i +1 ] and as i approaches n then those intervals nearby to n will have less of a chance of evolution or less chance of up-gradation (due to a truncation effect). Once the reported numbers are complete, we will similarly study the recovery stage of an epidemic and hence collect the data to compute Fig. 4 .6 . Accumulation of old cases in new intervals distributed back to the respective time intervals is schematically described in Fig. 4 .7 . This procedure will update the reported cases in the past as long as at least one reported case observed in the present time interval belongs to one of the past time intervals.

The wavelets act robustly in our situation and hence the pictorial differences between the three wavelets of Fig. 5 .2 are minimal. Yet the differences in patterns is definitely present because of the order of the various wavelets. The a i values are taken from each of the numerical examples or a real epidemic data collected. They can be combined with the network of people who are connected with each of the disease cases to construct graphs for the interval i for i = 1 , 2 , 3 , . . . , 12 .

However determining which one of the fractions ( i ( t ), i ( t )) is closest to the true one is not so easy.

In summary, what we are trying to develop through this paper is, given that we have partial data of an event (here we mean event of reporting of disease cases), we will construct the complete event data. Wavelets, in this work, are occupying a key role in the processing of builtup or accumulated data to build complete event data. The event here is the reported number of cases in a time interval and these reported cases represent only a partial number of actual epidemic cases. Through this paper, we demonstrated a method of improving partial data to be close to data that could be complete. How we plan to update our data reported in an interval and bring it closer to the actual number of disease cases is described in this paper.",

We plan to come up with some interesting insights on how to construct wavelets for medical applications. The bottom line is that we will be able to help public health planners for better management and courses of action during emerging epidemics. The kind of analysis we present here to fill missing pieces of epidemic reporting information can be applied to other areas, for example, constructing total rhythm of a heartbeat from partial information, etc.",

A solution through wavelets is also not trivial because there is no ready-made set of wavelets available which will offer a timely road-map. So we have introduced a novel strategy.
