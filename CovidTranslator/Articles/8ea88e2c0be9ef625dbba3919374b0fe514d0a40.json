            "text": "USP17 was originally identified as a member of the murine hematopoietic specific genes as DUB3 [4] . Expression of USP17 within the cell is cytokine-inducible and is required for cell-cycle progression through the G 1 -S and G 2 -M checkpoints. A well-characterized substrate of USP17 is the cell division cycle 25A (CDC25A) phosphatase. In a normal cell, CDC25A is responsible for dephosphorylation of Cdk1 and activation of Cdk1-CyclinB complex for the progression of the cell-cycle ( Figure 1A) [5]. Cellular levels of CDC25A are regulated by the ubiquitin-proteasome system through Lys 48 ubiquitin chains. During the G 1 -S and G 2 -M checkpoints, USP17 is expressed to deubiquitinate and stabilize CDC25A in order to promote cell-cycle progression through these checkpoints [5] . In numerous cancer phenotypes, expression of USP17 is upregulated, resulting in its expression outside of these checkpoints which causes an excess of stabilized CDC25A that applies stress to the cellcycle resulting in unregulated cancer cell proliferation ( Figure 1B ) [5] [6] [7] . Other identified substrates of USP17 include the Ras converting enzyme 1 (RCE1) and the histone deacetylase dependent Sin3A co-repressor complex component, SDS3, both of which also play a role in cell-cycle regulation [8-10].",

A sequence alignment of the catalytic regions of USP17 against three wellstudied USPs is shown in Figure 2C [12]. As with other USPs, there are three highly conserved residues (Cys89, His334 and Asp350) that form the catalytic triad. Experimental binding studies by Ramakrishna and coworkers have shown the two predicted hyaluronan binding motifs bind to hyaluronan, a polysaccharide that is responsible for numerous cellular processes, including the regulation of cell division [11] . Many USPs are predicted to contain hyaluronan binding motifs, including the well-studied USP7, however the interactions between the USPs and hyaluronon itself is poorly understood [13] . In the case of USP17, the hyaluronan binding motifs have been shown to be important for the interaction of USP17 with its substrate, SDS3 [14].",

The initial slope of each reaction was measured as Arbitrary Fluorescence Units (AFU) per unit time (AFU/sec). These values were then converted to the amount of product produced per unit time (\u03bcM/sec) using the 'fluorescence extinction coefficient' of the product (either released AMC or Rho110). To determine of the fluorescence extinction coefficient of the product for each substrate, the reactions were allowed to plateau and the maximum AFUs were measured and potted in terms of substrate concentration.",

While there are a few USPs (i.e. USP11 and USP16) that can be expressed and purified from E. coli as their full-length constructs, many USPs are insoluble when expressed from E. coli [19, 20] . An alternative approach for the expression of full-length USPs has been to utilize the labor-intensive baculovirus expression systems which has successfully produced full-length USP1, USP7, and USP12 enzymes [3, 18, 20] . However, the most common approach for producing recombinant USPs is to truncate the USP of interest into its individual domains in order to obtain high yields of soluble protein from E. coli. With this approach, high priority is placed on the catalytic domain, as demonstrated for the well-characterized USP7, USP8, and USP14 catalytic domain constructs [3, [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] . However, it is often found that the enzymatic activity of the catalytic domain is significantly lower than that for the full-length enzyme, making Hjortland production of full-length USPs a necessity for advanced studies.

Refolding of active USP17 was achieved by rapid dilution of the protein into a refolding buffer containing only 0.7 M GuHCl. Purification of the active, refolded USP17 was achieved in two steps, nickel-metal-chelate affinity chromatography followed by SEC. From 5 L of E. coli culture, approximately 20 mg of USP17 can be obtained, and the enzyme is >95% pure as judged by SDS-PAGE ( Figure 3A ). From SDS-PAGE analysis, USP17 has an estimated weight of 60 kDa, which is close to the expected size of USP17 with a 6His tag (\u223c62 kDa). The specific activity and yield of USP17 was measured at each step during the purification, and the results of which are summarized in Table 2 . The activity measurements are normalized to the refolding step, the first step where active enzyme is present. The resulting calculated yield of USP17 was approximately 10% and the overall improvement in purification was 5-fold. In contrast, no activity could be measured for the catalytic mutant USP17-Cys 89 Ser suggesting the activity measured for wild-type USP17 was specific to USP17, and not to a contaminating enzyme that co-purified with USP17.",

            "text": "During the development of the USP17 purification procedure, it was evident from SDS-PAGE analyses and confirmed by western blot with an antibody towards the 6His tag (data not shown) that USP17 is prone to some truncation. These truncations are either the result of self-degradation of USP17 or the susceptibility of USP17 to protease degradation during expression. While a high yield of the full-length enzyme can be purified away from the truncations by the refolding method described above ( Figure 3A ), three different expression methods were attempted to identify the cause in attempt to reduce the amount of degradation observed. First, USP17 was expressed with a N-terminal 10His-GFP tag by baculovirus infection of Sf9 cells. The yield of USP17 from Sf9 cells was significantly less than what can be obtained by refolding and degradation was still apparent, as observed with a GFPtagged version of USP17 ( Figure 3B ). Second, we expressed, refolded from inclusion body, and purified a catalytic mutant of USP17, USP17-Cys 89 Ser ( Figure 3C ), to evaluate if the degradation is autocatalytic or the result of proteases within the cell. During the purification of USP17-Cys 89 Ser, the degradation pattern of USP17 was again observed ( Figure 3C ) indicating that USP17 is susceptible to protease degradation during expression. This conclusion is further supported by the absence of truncations appearing after the purification is complete, suggesting purified full-length USP17 is stable and not prone to selfdegradation. Third, attempts were made to truncate USP17 to improve solubility and prevent degradation ( Figure 2B ), a technique utilized by many other USPs as summarized in Table 1 . However, none of the USP17 truncations expressed solubly or were able to refold in a stable form from E. coli inclusion bodies. In summary, the refolding and purification methodology described above is the best procedure for obtaining high yields of recombinant full-length USP17. Three significant observations were made regarding the stability of USP17 during the optimization of the refolding and purification of USP17 from inclusion body. First, during the optimization of the refolding buffer, it was found that if the GuHCl concentration was reduced to < 0.7 M, USP17 precipitated immediately upon rapid dilution. Second, while USP17 can actively refold at a pH of 7.5, significantly more precipitant is observed than when USP17 is refolded at pH 9.5. Finally, to obtain a high yield of pure full-length USP17, 5% glycerol is required in the refolding buffer and all subsequent purification buffers to aid in stabilization. Without the glycerol present, USP17 would precipitate throughout the purification, specifically when concentrated for SEC. Furthermore, the glycerol acts as a cryo-protectant when USP17 is flash frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80 \u00b0C.",

After incubation, the samples were centrifuged and the remaining USP17 concentration and specific activity was measured to evaluate the effect temperature and incubation time had on the activity of the enzyme ( Figure 4A ). The specific activity was normalized to the measured activity at the beginning of day one for comparison ( Figure 4B) . A large amount of precipitation was observed in the samples incubated at 37 \u00b0C for each day. Almost a complete loss in specific activity was observed after day 1 and each day after, suggesting the remaining soluble protein was inactive. Similar to the samples incubated at 37 \u00b0C, large amounts of precipitation was observed for each sample stored at 25 \u00b0C. After day 1, the 25 \u00b0C samples only retained \u223c10% activity. After days 2 and 3 the samples 25 \u00b0C retained minimal activity. The samples stored at 4 \u00b0C had minimal precipitation and only lost \u223c35% of the total activity after day 1. Unlike the other temperatures tested, no further loss in total activity was observed after days 2 and 3 for the 4 \u00b0C samples. This suggests that any aggregation or inactivation that occurred during the incubation period happened within the first 24 hours and not thereafter.

The data in Figure 6 were fit to the Michaelis-Menten equation, and the resulting kinetic parameters from those fits are summarized in Table 3 . The kinetic parameters suggest that USP17 recognizes and hydrolyzes both Ub-AMC and Ub-Rho110 with somewhat similar catalytic efficiencies (k cat /K M = 1,500 (\u00d710 3 ) * M -1 * sec -1 for Ub-AMC and 880 (\u00d710 3 ) * M -1 * sec -1 for Ub-Rho110). Ub-AMC is the more commonly utilized fluorogenic substrate within the deubiquitinating enzyme literature. As such, Table 4 compares the kinetic parameters of USP17 with Ub-AMC, to those of other human USPs characterized to date [19, 24] . Interestingly, USP17 catalyzes the hydrolysis of Ub-AMC 3-fold more efficiently than USP7 as a result of the lower K m value associated with USP17. Similar to other USPs, USP17 poorly catalyzes the hydrolysis of the fluorogenic peptide substrate RLRGG-AMC and the ubiquitin-like modifier substrate ISG15-AMC, that is involved in the innate immune response (data not shown).",

Ten pH values spaced 0.5 pH units apart were chosen and the rates were measured in triplicate. The data in Figure 7 assumes typical bell-shaped curves and therefore the data were fit to the equation that describes the kinetic model of an enzyme undergoing two ionizations with two pKa values (pK a and pK b ) using SigmaPlot (v13: Systat Software Inc.). The resulting fits are shown in Figure 7 for both subsaturating and saturating substrate concentrations and the resulting pK a for 0.5 \u03bcM Ub-Rho is 6.83 \u00b1 0.07, which is similar to the pK a value at 5 \u03bcM Ub-Rho110 which is 6.75 \u00b1 0.04. The pK b value at 0.5 \u03bcM Ub-Rho110 is 9.13 \u00b1 0.07 which is similar to the pK b value of 9.35 \u00b1 0.04 at 5 \u03bcM Ub-Rho110.

            "text": "Ubiquitination of protein substrates involves one of the seven lysine residues of ubiquitin. The topology of the ubiquitin chain is directly dependent on the specific lysine residue that is used to conjugate one ubiquitin to the next. These differences can confer an additional layer of specificity for a particular USP beyond recognition of the protein substrate alone. Previous cell-based assays have demonstrated that USP17 can process Lys 63 chains conjugated to RCE1 and SDS3 and Lys 48 chains conjugated to CDC25A [5, 9, 10] . To further explore the ability of USP17 to recognize and cleave other ubiquitin linkages, we investigated the ability of USP17 to hydrolyze all seven lysine linkages (Lys 6 , Lys 11 , Lys 27 ,Lys 29 , Lys 33 , Lys 48 , or Lys 63 ) using di-ubiquitin as well as its ability to cleave a linear peptide linkage between two ubiquitins (linear). The di-ubiquitin chains were incubated with USP17 and the reaction products were analyzed by SDS-PAGE ( Figure 8A ). USP17 was able to process all linkages, to a certain extent, with the exception of linear di-ubiquitin. As was expected, USP17 was able to efficiently process Lys 48 and Lys 63 almost fully to monoubiquitin, as well as Lys 11 and Lys 33 ( Figure 8A, Top Panel) . A substantial amount of uncleaved di-ubiquitin remained for Lys 27 , Lys 29 , and Lys 6 ( Figure 8A , Bottom Panel). A comparison of these cleavage patterns to other characterized USPs is displayed in Table 5 . We then evaluated how USP17 processed longer ubiquitin chains by incubating USP17 with tetra-ubiquitin chains of Lys 48 ( Figure 8B ), Lys 63 ( Figure 8C ), or Lys 11 ( Figure 8D ) by evaluating the cleavage pattern over time. The data suggests that all three chain types are processed by exo-trimming to a similar extent within the time range tested.",

With this realization, there is a great need to expand upon the number of USPs that have been expressed and purified, allowing for more in depth kinetic, biochemical, biophysical and structural studies of the USP family. Furthermore, these advanced approaches can be used in conjunction with the development of small molecule inhibitors to further probe the functional roles of the USPs in cells, and ultimately the development of therapeutic compounds. Of the USPs that have been expressed via recombinant systems, few of them are of the full-length construct due to their inherent insolubility when expressed in E. coli. Therefore, it is not uncommon to see fulllength USPs expressed from the more labor-intensive, often low-yielding baculovirus expression systems. To obtain higher yields of soluble USPs, the individual catalytic domains or other domains of USPs have more often been produced.",

It is not likely that USP17 itself is responsible for its degradation, as similar degradation patterns are observed for the refolded catalytic mutant.

It was also observed to be a monomer in solution at 4 \u00b0C and at concentrations ranging from 0.5 to 1 mg/mL by DLS. However, USP17 was determined to shift to a more dimeric state when evaluated by either analytical-SEC at 1.3 mg/mL and 4 \u00b0C, or by DLS at concentrations ranging from 0.75 to 1 mg/mL and 25 \u00b0C. Taken together, the results suggest USP17 primarily assumes a monomeric state at lower concentrations (i.e. under the conditions of our kinetic assays) but the equilibrium may shift towards a dimer at higher USP17 concentrations (i.e > 1 mg/ml), and this dimerization may have some temperature dependence.",

The high level of USP17 catalytic activity provides further evidence of the significant role USP17 has in progressing the cell-cycle.

This specificity is partially implied by the different topologies the specific ubiquitin chains assume and whether or not the USP is capable of accessing each iso-peptide bond. Faesen and coworkers performed a di-ubiquitin panel assessing the ability of a variety of USPs to process the eight different ubiquitin chain types over time [19] . While subtle differences could be observed between the USP's ability to process the chains, it was clear that most of the USPs tested were promiscuous and could process the majority of the chains with the exception of the linear chain [19] . However, USP17 appears to be slightly more specific about the topology of each linkage than the other members of the USP family. While USP17 could process each of the ubiquitin chain types, with the exception of linear ubiquitin, it did so to varying degrees. USP17 easily processed Lys 48 and Lys 63 , supporting the previous cell-based findings [5, 9, 10] . Interestingly, USP17 processed the Lys 33 chain relatively well, a chain type that is not easily processed by most USPs, and is related to a handful of pathways which use ubiquitination to regulate the function of the substrate rather than target it for degradation [25] . Recently Lys 33 ubiquitin chains have been associated with the modulation of kinase activity [26] . USP17 also easily processed Lys 11 , which have been described as a strong degradation signal similar to the Lys 48 chains [7, 19, 27] . The observed cleavage pattern by USP17 is most similar to the cellcycle dependent USP1.",

CDC25A cellular levels are regulated through ubiquitination that signals for CDC25A degradation. (A) In a normal cell, USP17 deubiquitinates and stabilizes CDC25A to promote cell-cycle progression [5] . (B) In cancer cells, USP17 levels are upregulated which results in increased deubiquitination and stabilization of CDC25A. The increased levels of CDC25A therefore result in cancer cell proliferation [5] .
