However, the interaction between NDV and cells in early stages of infection is not well understood. Here, we report that, shortly after infection, NDV triggers the formation of autophagosomes in U251 glioma cells, as demonstrated by an increased number of double-membrane vesicles, GFPmicrotubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3 (GFP-LC3) a dot formations, and elevated production of LC3II. Moreover, modulation of NDV-induced autophagy by rapamycin, chloroquine or small interfering RNAs targeting the genes critical for autophagosome formation (Atg5 and Beclin-1) affects virus production, indicating that autophagy may be utilized by NDV to facilitate its own production. Furthermore, the class III phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Beclin-1 pathway plays a role in NDVinduced autophagy and virus production. Collectively, our data provide a unique example of a paramyxovirus that uses autophagy to enhance its production.",

The hallmark of autophagy is a doublemembraned autophagosome that engulfs bulk cytoplasm and cytoplasmic organelles [3] . Autophagosomes fuse ultimately with lysosomes, thereby generating singlemembraned autophagolysosomes and degrading their contents [4] . During autophagy, LC3 (microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3) is converted to lipidated LC3II and associates with the autophagic membrane. The punctuate distribution of LC3 upon lipidation is characteristic and serves as a marker for autophagy [5] , while the LC3II/actin ratio correlates well with the number of autophagosomes [6] . A multifunctional protein p62 (SQSTM1) interacts with LC3II and is specifically degraded by the autophagiclysosome pathway [6] .",

The molecular pathways that regulate autophagy have been investigated extensively. A critical positive regulator of autophagy is the class III phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3KC3), whose activity in promoting autophagy depends on its association with a multi-protein complex that contains the essential mammalian autophagy protein Beclin-1 (homologue of yeast Atg6) [7] . Two ubiquitinlike conjugation systems are required for the formation of autophagosomes, in which several Atg genes including Atg5 are involved. Autophagy may also be negatively regulated by the serine/threonine kinase mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) [8, 9] . Other negative regulators of autophagy include the class I PI3K/Akt pathway, which controls autophagy via its downstream regulator mTOR.",

In contrast, several single-stranded RNA viruses, such as poliovirus, coronavirus and dengue virus, exploit the elements of the autophagy system to benefit their own replication [13] [14] [15] .

In addition, and expression of p62 in NDV-infected U251 cells were investigated by immunoblot (IB). R stands for rapamycin. Cells treated with rapamycin were used as the positive control. Sample loading was controlled using an anti-actin antibody as indicated. Densitometry was performed for quantification, and the ratios of LC3II to actin are presented below the blots. (E) U251 cells were infected with NDV at a range of MOIs (0.01, 0.1, 1 and 10) for 24 h, and LC3II production was measured by IB. (F) The time course of induction of LC3II in U251 cells treated with UV-inactivated NDV at an MOI of 10 was examined by IB. The results are representative of two separate experiments upon NDV infection, elevated phosphorylation of p70S6K, a downstream effector of mTOR signaling, was also detected with a time dependence similar to that of mTOR phosphorylation (Fig. 2) . It is known that mTOR is one of the downstream effectors of the class I PI3K/Akt signaling pathways and that Akt signaling has been shown previously to be involved in the induction of autophagy in malignant glioma cells [23] . We examined Akt phosphorylation at different time points after NDV infection. As shown in Fig. 2 , increased phosphorylation of Akt was observed in NDV-infected cells until 24 hpi. Together, these data suggested that the class I PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway was activated during NDV infection and may not contribute to NDV-triggered autophagy.",

U251 cells infected with NDV were mock treated or treated with the autophagy inducer rapamycin, or the autophagy inhibitor CQ, at the concentrations used in previous studies [26] [27] [28] [29] . The two compounds had no effect on cell viability at the concentrations used in this study (data not shown). As can be seen in Fig. 3A , the production of LC3II was increased at 24 and 48 hpi in NDV-infected cells treated with rapamycin. CQ inhibits autophagy at a late stage by preventing the fusion of autophagosomes with lysosomes and thus increasing the cellular burden of autophagosomes [30, 31] . Because LC3II is an essential element in the formation of the autophagosome, the inhibition of autophagy by CQ results in the marked accumulation of LC3II [32, 33] . Figure 3B shows that CQ induced a moderate increase in LC3II in infected cells, indicating that CQ treatment blocks the fusion of the NDV-induced autophagosomes with lysosomes. Overall, these results indicated that rapamycin exerts an enhanced effect on NDV-induced autophagy, whereas CQ inhibits NDV-induced autophagy.",

As shown in Fig. 3C , infection in the presence of rapamycin resulted in an almost twofold increase in virus production at 24 and 48 hpi when compared with the mock-treated control. In contrast, CQ treatment resulted in a decrease in virus yield by nearly 2 logs (Fig. 3C) . Considering our observations about the effect on NDV-triggered autophagic induction by rapamycin or CQ in U251 cells, we inferred that the autophagic machinery plays a positive role in virus production in NDV-infected U251 cells.",

As illustrated in Fig. 4A , the expression of either Atg5 or Beclin-1 in uninfected U251 cells was inhibited to a large extent (about 75% reduction) by specific small interfering RNAs (siRNAs). Figure 4B shows that there was a reduction of approximately 10 times and 6 times, respectively, in the virus yield at 24 hpi and nearly 60 times at 48 hpi when compared with control infection.

            "text": "Members of the family Paramyxoviridae have been shown to induce autophagy in target cells. It has been reported that Cell lysates were analyzed for the activation of mTOR, p70S6K and Akt by immunoblot assay. The filters were stripped and reprobed with antibodies against total mTOR, p70S6K or Akt. Sample loading was controlled using an anti-actin antibody as indicated the parainfluenza virus simian virus 5 activates plasmacytoid dendritic cells through the autophagy pathway [16] , while measles virus induces autophagy in HeLa cells through a pathway mediated by CD46 [17] . However, it remains unclear whether autophagy is triggered upon NDV infection. In the current study, we demonstrated that, shortly after infection, NDV triggers autophagy in U251 glioma cells. By means of fluorescence and electron microscopy, several hallmarks of autophagy, including the formation of autophagosomes and GFP-LC3 dot formation, were observed in U251 cells upon NDV infection ( Fig. 1A and B). These observations were attested further by the increased production of LC3II (Fig. 1C) . Furthermore, decreased levels of p62 at 24 h and 48 h after NDV infection correlate well with LC3II production, indicating that a complete autophagic response was induced upon NDV infection. Taken together, these data strongly suggest that autophagy is induced and is a part of the cellular response during NDV infection. Further studies will be The process of autophagosome formation is tightly controlled by a few signaling pathways including the class I PI3K/Akt/mTOR and class III PI3K/Beclin-1 pathways. So far, the mechanisms that participate in paramyxovirusinduced autophagy remain largely unknown. In this report, we showed that Beclin-1 expression was induced at early stages of NDV infection, which correlates well with the increased production of LC3II, indicating a potential role of the class III PI3K/Beclin-1 pathway in NDV-triggered autophagy. In contrast, we observed increased phosphorylation of Akt, mTOR and p70S6K in NDV-infected U251 cells, suggesting that NDV-induced autophagy is not triggered by the class I PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway. Therefore, the class III PI3K/Beclin-1 pathway plays a crucial role in NDV-induced autophagy.",

            "text": "Although autophagy is known to be a cellular defense against viral infection, induction of autophagy has been shown to be beneficial for the replication of a few RNA viruses, including poliovirus [35] , dengue virus [14] and coxsackievirus [36] . In this report, we show that manipulation of the autophagic induction in NDV-infected U251 cells by pharmacological compounds or target-specific RNA interference resulted in significant alterations in virus replication. CQ treatment decreased virus production 24 and 48 h after NDV infection, while elevated virus production by rapamycin treatment was detected at 24 and 48 hpi. Interestingly, the effect on virus yield by CQ or rapamycin correlates well with their diverse effects on NDV-induced autophagy. Together, our data suggest that autophagy plays a critical role in virus production in NDV-infected cells. This notion is supported further by results from siRNA manipulations targeting ATG5 or Beclin-1 in U251 cells. The ATG5 protein is essential for the formation of the autophagosomal membrane, while Beclin-1 is necessary for cellular autophagy. A previous study has shown that ATG5 is necessary for the delivery of Sendai virus genetic material from the cytoplasm into endosomes, where the ssRNA sensor Toll-like receptor 7 resides [37] . The suppression of either of the two autophagic molecules in NDV-infected U251 cells resulted in the reduction of virus yield when compared with control. Together, these data indicate that autophagy is likely to be utilized by NDV to facilitate its own production. Of note, although several negative-stranded RNA viruses have been shown to induce autophagy, the relationship between autophagy and virus replication is poorly understood. Thus, our data will increase understanding of the role of autophagy in negative-stranded RNA virus replication.",
