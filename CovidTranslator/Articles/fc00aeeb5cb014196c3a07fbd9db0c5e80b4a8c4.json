In early 2014, PD-CoV was reported in pigs with diarrhea on swine farms in Ohio, USA (2) , and later in other states (2) (3) (4) (5) . In April 2014, PDCoV strain KNU14-04 was reported in pigs in South Korea (6) . A retrospective study in 2012 reported PDCoV strain S27 in Sichuan, China (7) . Recently PDCoV strain CNJXNI2 has been reported in pigs with diarrhea in Jiangxi, China (8) .",

            "text": "To the Editor: Field clinicians working during the unprecedented Ebola virus disease (EVD) outbreak in West Africa, which began in December 2013, have been confronted with complex situations concerning mothers and breast-fed children in which one or both in a pair have tested positive for Ebola virus (EBOV) (1) . More data, especially regarding virus shedding in breast milk, is critical to provide better care and guidance in future outbreaks. We report the case of a lactating EBOV-positive mother and her twin babies. The case is anonymously reported with the mother's consent. The study met the M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res Ethics Review Board and approved criteria for studies of routinely collected data.In Guinea in 2015, a woman and her 4-month-old twins (baby 1 and 2) were registered as contacts after the woman's mother tested positive for EBOV (postmortem diagnosis by reverse transcription PCR [RT-PCR]). The woman and her babies, who were exclusively breast-fed, were followed daily by contact tracers. When baby 1 became febrile, the woman left her home to seek help from a traditional healer, bringing both twins with her. A few days later, baby 1 died and was buried without EBOV testing; according to the World Health Organization case definition, baby 1 was a probable EVD case-patient (2) .Eleven days after baby 1 died, the woman became sick; 5 days later, she was admitted to an Ebola treatment center. At admission (day 0), she had headache, loss of appetite, abdominal pain, joint pain, dysphagia, conjunctival injection, and myalgia but was afebrile. On day 1, a blood sample from the woman was positive for EBOV by RT-PCR (Xpert Ebola Assay, GeneXpert Instrument Systems; Cepheid, Sunnyvale, CA, USA) with a cycle threshold (C t ) of 32.5. Baby 2 tested negative for EBOV on day 1 and 72 hours later. Baby 2 was tested twice because he was considered at high risk for infection after being breast-fed for 6 days while his mother was symptomatic (i.e., until day 1 of her hospital admission).On day 1, the woman was given convalescent-phase plasma from EBOV survivors; the treatment was given according to a compassionate-use protocol and was the standard process in this center at the time. On day 6, breast milk was sampled and tested positive for EBOV (C t 21.6) (Table) . The woman's clinical course was favorable; she remained afebrile during hospitalization, but mild symptoms persisted until day 5. The first convalescent-phase test, done on day 14, showed C t values of 40.5 and 27.5 for blood and breast milk, respectively. On day 21, a second breast milk sample tested positive (C t 32.7). On day 24, the woman was given cabergoline (0.5 mg 2\u00d7/d for 2 days) to cease lactation, after which no more breast milk samples could be collected. On day 29 after admission, she tested negative for EBOV in blood and urine and was reunited with baby 2. Serologic testing for baby 2 was done on day 23 and showed no sign of previous subclinical infection (ELISA, IgM, and IgG negative).Many questions in this case remain unanswered, but our findings show the potential infectivity of breast milk for",
