            "text": "Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis virus (TMEV) and other neurotropic virus infections result in degeneration of each component of the neuron: apoptosis of the cell body, axonal (Wallerian) degeneration, and dendritic and synaptic pathology. In general, axonal degeneration is detrimental for hosts. However, axonal degeneration can be beneficial in the case of infection with neurotropic viruses that spread in the CNS using axonal transport. C57BL/Wld S (Wld S , Wallerian degeneration slow mutant) mice are protected from axonal degeneration. Wld S mice infected with the neurovirulent GDVII strain of TMEV are more resistant to virus infection than wild-type mice, suggesting that axonal preservation contributes to the resistance. By contrast, infection with the less virulent Daniels strain of TMEV results in high levels of virus propagation in the CNS, suggesting that prolonged survival of axons in Wld S mice favors virus spread. Thus, axonal degeneration might be a beneficial self-destruct mechanism that limits the spread of neurotropic viruses, in the case of less virulent virus infection. We hypothesize that neurons use 'built-in' self-destruct protection machinery (compartmental neurodegeneration) against neurotropic virus infection, since the CNS is an immunologically privileged site. Early induction of apoptosis in the neuronal cell body limits virus replication. Wallerian degeneration of the axon prevents axonal transport of virus. Dendritic and synaptic degeneration blocks virus transmission at synapses. Thus, the balance between neurodegeneration and virus propagation may be taken into account in the future design of neuroprotective therapy.",

A neuron can be divided into different components: cell body (soma), a longer cell process called an axon, branching processes called dendrites and synapses. A neuron transmits information via the axon, which terminates at a synapse for conveying ongoing signals, while dendrites integrate incoming signals. Since axons as well as their neuronal cell bodies do not usually regenerate in the CNS, axonal damage often results in permanent neurological deficits. Axonal degeneration in the CNS can be seen in several neurological conditions, such as neurodegenerative diseases (e.g., amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and neuroaxonal dystrophy) [1], traumatic lesions and infections [2] [3] [4] [5] .",

TMEV induces axonal degeneration and apoptosis, which potentially suppress virus spread in the axon and virus propagation in the neuronal cell body, respectively. Both axonal degeneration and apoptosis are observed during physiological conditions, particularly during development [29] . Thus, neurons may use these mechanisms as self-destructive suicidal pathways to suppress virus spread in the CNS. These potential innate antivirus pathways may be necessary for the 'immunologically privileged' CNS. Also in this review, we will introduce a relatively new concept, compartmental neurodegeneration, an idea originally proposed by Gillingwater and Richester [30] , to describe the processes of Wallerian degeneration in the axon, apoptosis in the cell body, and dendritic and synaptic degeneration.

The two subgroups are 95% identical at the amino acid level, and studies using recombinant viruses between the two subgroups have revealed the multigenic nature of neurovirulence and demyelination [20] . Although TMEV is a natural enteric pathogen in mice, only intracerebral inoculation of virus induces CNS disease efficiently. The GDVII subgroup viruses, including the GDVII and FA strains, cause acute fatal polioencephalomyelitis in mice [32] . The less virulent TO subgroup viruses, including Daniels (DA) and BeAn strains, cause acute nonfatal polioencephalomyelitis 1-2 weeks postinfection (acute phase), and chronic inflammatory demyelinating disease approximately 1 month after infection (chronic phase) [33] .

There is substantial evidence that all major immune cells, including CD4 + and CD8 + T cells, antibodies and macrophages, can contribute to demyelination. Virus-specific CD4 + Th1-cell responses are associated with demyelination, while myelin-specific CD4 + T cells have been detected during the late chronic phase (epitope spreading) [36] [37] [38] . CD8 + T cells play an important role in virus clearance, while virus-specific as well as autoreactive CD8 + T cells have been suggested to contribute to demyelination [17, 23, 36, 37, 39, 40] . Similarly, anti-TMEV humoral immune responses can help virus clearance, while some antiviral antibodies cross-react with host myelin molecules, including galactocerebroside [38] . However, it should be noted that TMEV can cause demyelination in the organotypic culture in vitro in the absence of immune cells. In addition, immune-deficient mice, including nude mice and MHC class I or II deficient mice, also develop demyelination [20] . A transgenic mouse model (DA/Cre) that had tamoxifen-inducible expression of a subgenomic segment of DA virus RNA in oligodendrocytes and Schwann cells developed demyelination in the sciatic nerve, when DA/Cre mice were treated with tamoxifen [41] . Demyelination was not accompanied by inflammation in the DA/Cre mice. Here, viral RNA and/or protein, but not the immune system, seemed to cause demyelination.",

In DA virus infection, mild axonal degeneration can also be detected in the spinal cord white matter, as early as 1 week post-infection The number and extent of swelling of NFP + axons increased over time. During the subclinical phase, 2-3 weeks postinfection, NFP + damaged axons were detected in normal-appearing myelin sheaths containing myelin basic protein at the single fiber level, using double immunofluorescence confocal microscopy. Three weeks postinfection, beaded, fragmented and degenerating axons were detected. Significant axonal swelling occurred and NFP + fragmented and degenerating axons were seen 1 month postinfection. On the other hand, significant demyelination and perivascular mononuclear cell infiltration were not evident until 1 month postinfection Early onset axonal injury was also confirmed in mice infected with BeAn virus (TO subgroup), 14 days postinfection [43] .

This is opposite to the conventional theory for lesion development in demyelinating diseases accompanying axonal degeneration, where the inside axon is believed to be damaged secondarily to outside myelin damage (Outside-In model). In some patients with MS and in a neurotropic coronavirus-induced MS model, there is evidence that axonal damage can precede demyelination [5, 44] . In an autoimmune model for MS, experimental allergic (autoimmune) encephalomyelitis (EAE), autoantibodies against neurofascin, which were detected in MS patients, have been shown to bind the node of Ranvier and induce axonal damage and disease exacerbation in the absence of demyelination or inflammation [45] . Interestingly, predominant primary axonal damage has also been reported in a mouse model for peripheral nervous demyelinating disease, experimental autoimmune neuritis, induced by the P0 106-125 peptide [46] . Axonal degeneration has also been observed in vitro in cerebellar explant culture infected with DA virus [47] . By 72 h postinfection, electron micrographic analysis indicated that DA virus induced apoptosis of neuronal cells as well as axonal degeneration within the intact myelin sheath. In this cerebellar explant culture, myelin damage was not seen. Thus, TMEV can induce axonal degeneration both in vivo and in vitro in the absence of lymphocytes or demyelination.",

Wallerian degeneration slow mutant mice, C57BL/Wld S (Wld S ) mice, are a substrain of C57BL/6 (B6) mice [48] . Wld S mice have prolonged survival of the distal stumps of transected axons [30, 49, 50] both in the peripheral nervous system and the CNS [51] .

Wld S mice are protected from Wallerian degeneration by overexpression of a chimeric gene (Wld), which encodes the ubiquitin assembly protein Ufd2a fused to nicotinamide mononucleotide adenylyl transferase (Nmnat) [55] .

GDVII virus causes acute fatal polioencephalitis in mice, regardless of the strain of mouse. Most infected mice die within 10 days. In the brain, high levels of apoptosis of neurons and viral replication are observed, which is associated with a failure in both the cellular and humoral immune response against virus [12, 32] . GDVII virus was propagated in baby hamster kidney (BHK)-21 cells, and virus titer was determined by a plaque assay [57] . We inoculated different doses of GDVII virus intracerebrally into wild-type B6 and Wld S mice. Between days 4 and 5 postinfection, the mice started to show signs of encephalitis, such as weight loss, ruffled fur and a hunched posture. Mice receiving higher dosages of virus lost weight more rapidly than those receiving lower dosages. The B6 mice had more rapid weight loss and impairment of righting reflex [28] than the Wld S mice. Although most infected mice died within 1 week postinfection, more Wld S mice survived than B6 mice, particularly at low infectious doses (FIGURE 1A). Using the Reed and Muench calculation of the 50% end point [58] , we found that the median lethal dose (LD 50 ) titer of B6 mice was 1.03 plaque forming unit (PFU) and that of Wld S mice was 23.3 PFU (the LD 50 titer is defined as the dose that will kill 50% of the animals receiving that dose). The survival period was also longer in Wld S mice than in B6 mice (FIGURE 1B).",

The white matter appeared normal by conventional staining in both mouse groups. However, using immunohistochemistry against NFP, substantial numbers of damaged axons were detected in the white matter of the spinal cord in B6 mice (FIGURE 2C). By contrast, axonal degeneration was not observed in the spinal cord white matter of Wld S mice (FIGURE 2D). Thus, axons were preserved in infected Wld S mice, which likely contributed to the relative resistance of Wld S mice to GDVII virus infection. Therefore, axonal preservation can play a beneficial role in neurotropic virus infection. The beneficial role of preservation of axons has also been seen in other neurodegenerative models using Wld S mice, including EAE [59, 60] .",

Recently, axonal degeneration has been suggested to be an active program of self-destruction in many physiological and pathological settings, such as axonal branch elimination in development and neuronal insult [29, 56] . We speculated that axonal degeneration in B6 mice infected with TMEV can be a beneficial self-destructive mechanism that limits the spread of virus in the CNS. In addition, transection of infected axons would efficiently limit transport and spread of viruses from the gray matter to the white matter.

Terminal transferase dUTP nick-end labeling (TUNEL) + apoptotic nuclei can be seen in both TMEV antigen-positive and -negative cells. TMEV also induces apoptosis in vitro in cell lines, including cells of monocyte/macrophage and neuronal lineages [12, 19, 64] . Induction of apoptosis in vitro is inversely associated with cell permissiveness for infection: TMEV replication is restricted in cells that undergo apoptosis. In contrast, permissive cells, which are productively infected with TMEV, predominantly die by necrosis. GDVII virus induces a higher level of apoptosis of neurons than DA virus in the CNS [12]. This could be, at least partly, related to the absence of L* synthesis in the GDVII infection. The initiating AUG for the L* reading frame is present in all TO subgroup genomes, but not in the GDVII subgroup. GDVII virus and a DA virus mutant that lacks L* are more efficient at inducing apoptosis of cultured macrophages than the wild-type DA virus, suggesting that the L* protein has an antiapoptotic effect in macrophages [65] . On the other hand, in primary peritoneal macrophages infected with BeAn virus in vitro, one-third of the cells were apoptotic but negative for virus RNA and antigens [64] . This suggests that apoptosis was induced in BeAn virus antigen-negative cells by bystander killing, such as TNF-\u03b1 production or cell-tocell contact, but not by direct virus infection. Regardless of its mechanism, early induction of apoptosis in virus-infected cells as well as adjacent uninfected cells can limit virus spread both in vivo and in vitro.",

The difference in induction of inflammation between apoptosis and necrosis can be attributed to a release of certain intracellular molecules, known as damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs), only from necrotic cells [69] . DAMPs are normally hidden in the interior of cells and are only revealed after necrosis. Candidate molecules for DAMPs include heat-shock proteins, uric acid, highmobility group box 1 protein (HMGB1) and genomic dsDNA. Pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) from microorganisms, such as viral RNAs, are other molecules that play an important role in the induction of inflammation. In virus infection, phagocytosis of virusinfected apoptotic cells by resident macrophages should minimize the release of PAMPs extracellularly, compared with necrosis of infected cells. In addition, in some virus infections, necrosis of infected cells resulted from active virus replication, while apoptosis of infected cells resulted in abortive infection [64] . This also contributes to overall differences in the amount of PAMPs between apoptotic versus necrotic cell death in virus infection, leading to a lack of inflammation in the former and induction of inflammation in the latter. In addition, since DAMPs are known to function as an adjuvant [69], a lack of release of DAMPs from apoptotic neurons in GDVII virus infection may contribute to a relative lack of antiviral immune responses. Furthermore, phagocytosis of apoptotic cells can lead to the production of anti-inflammatory cytokines [70] .",

Similarly, axonal degeneration has been shown to be an active program of self-destruction in many physiological and pathological settings, such as axonal branch elimination in development and neuronal insult [29, 56, 74] . In a physiologic condition, it may be appropriate to call such an axonal change a 'physiological axotomy' rather than axonal degeneration ('axotomy' or 'axonotmesis' is defined as a nerve lesion producing discontinuity of axons, with preservation of the supporting nerve structures). Axonal injury may occur through a local self-destruct program designed to disconnect the axon from its target cell, thereby conserving energy or preventing spread of toxic substances, including virus, via axonal transport.",

Roussarie et al. [62] showed that, in Wld S mice, TMEV infection in the optic nerve resulted in virus transport from the axon to the myelin. Thus, preservation of the axon may favor virus spread not only within the axons (from the axon to the dendrite or from one neuron to the other) but also into the adjacent myelin/oligodendrocytes. However, if the myelin sheath surrounding an infected axon degenerates before virus infects the myelin sheath, this early degeneration (demyelination) can block centripetal transfer of virus from the myelin sheath to the cell body of the oligodendrocyte. In this context, demyelination might represent the oligodendrocytes' self-destructive attempt to suppress virus spread, although it ultimately results in potentially irreversible myelin damage [38] . Indeed, loss of myelin (demyelination) has been shown to occur in the presence of surviving cell bodies of oligodendrocytes in subtypes of MS and animal models for MS [43, 94] . This might represent demyelination as a compartmentalized degeneration of oligodendrocytes (we will not discuss this issue further, since it is beyond the scope of this review).",

The nature and site of initial injury to the neuron are often unknown; it is unclear if the process starts in the axon itself or within the neuronal cell body. In neurotropic virus infection, direct insult by virus can induce cell destruction, while infected neurons (and perhaps neighboring neurons also) may operate self-destructive machinery to combat neurotropic virus infection. The infected neuronal cell body can signal the axon to initiate the localized self-destruct process. Alternatively, the axon may sense danger signals locally and determine whether the axon should remain connected or degenerate. The candidate factors for axonal degeneration include influx of calcium, activation of m-calpain, caspase and/or gelsolin, and the ubiquitin-proteasome system [80] . Axonal degeneration can be induced by disruption of cross-talk between myelin sheaths and axons [5] . Here, elucidation of the precise mechanism of axonal degeneration in different neurological diseases is necessary for the development of a new therapeutic modality. Although there is no efficient treatment targeting axonal degeneration, several drugs, such as sodium and calcium channel antagonists, proteasome inhibitors and resveratrol (a red wine component that enhances SIRT1 activity), have been tested for their potential axonal preservation property [56, 95, 96] .",

In theory, neurons have individual self-destructive defense mechanisms in each compartment. Apoptosis of infected cell bodies can suppress virus replication, resulting in abortive infection. Dendritic and synaptic degeneration can block virus transmission trans-synaptically or at the neuromuscular junction. Compartmental neurodegeneration is a reasonable price to pay to restrict virus spread in the CNS (FIGURE 5). One example of this can be DA virus clearance in wild-type B6 mice, compared with virus persistence in Wld S mice during the early chronic phase of infection [60] . On the other hand, it is much more costly when this defense mechanism is not effective enough to combat highly neurovirulent virus infection. In GDVII virus infection, axonal preservation in Wld S mice could be crucial for better survival of hosts, compared with infected B6 mice with axonal degeneration.",

In infection with a less virulent virus that propagates slowly and/or infects persistently in the host CNS, self-destructive neurodegeneration machinery should efficiently suppress virus propagation in the CNS, and benefit the host, particularly if neurodegeneration is compartmentalized in small regions (FIGURE 5). Theoretically, compartmental neurodegeneration in the axon, dendrite or synapses allows the neuronal cell body to survive [89] . Then, after clearance of virus, the neuron might restore its function by regenerating its neuronal processes, although regeneration of neuronal processes in the CNS is generally not possible (in spite of some successful experimental reports [98, 99] ), in stark contrast to the peripheral nervous system. Future neuroprotection therapeutic strategies in neurotropic virus infection require careful consideration of the balance between neurodegeneration and viral propagation in the CNS.",

Immunohistochemistry against nonphosphorylated neurofilament (NFP) visualizes normal cell bodies and dendrites of neurons, while it visualizes damaged axons, but not normal axons. In both mouse groups, NFP + normal cell bodies and dendrites of neurons were seen in the GM. However, damaged axons (arrow) in the WM were detected only in B6 mice (C), but not in Wld S mice. Higher magnification showed NFP + axonal swelling in B6 mice, while no NFP + axon was seen in Wld S mice. Magnification: \u00d742; inset: \u00d7190. GM: Gray matter; WM: White matter. [30] . The neuron can be divided into compartments, structurally and functionally: the cell body (soma), axon, dendrite and synapse. During development and neurological diseases, each compartment often degenerates well before or independently of the other compartments. Degeneration of the cell body and the axon occurs through apoptosis and axonal (Wallerian) degeneration, respectively, which can be self-destructive in certain conditions [29, 56] . Although localized degeneration of the dendrite and synapse has also been demonstrated, precise mechanisms of dendritic and synaptic pathology (synaptosis) are not known. The myelin sheath is not a compartment of the neuron, but of the oligodendrocyte. Degeneration of the myelin sheath is demyelination, which can occur independently of the above compartmental neurodegenerative mechanisms or destruction of oligodendrocyte cell bodies. Since the CNS is an immunologically privileged site, the neuron itself has built-in self-destruct protection machinery -compartmental neurodegeneration. Early induction of apoptosis in the neuronal cell body limits virus replication intracellularly. Wallerian degeneration of the axon prevents axonal transport of virus, preventing 'intraneural' spread of virus inside the neuron (which can be more than 1-meter long in large animals). Dendritic and synaptic degeneration blocks virus transmission at synapses between neurons and at neuromuscular junctions, which prevents virus spread from one neuron to the other ('interneural' spread) or between the neuron and periphery organs, such as muscle, which are innervated by the neuron. The overall balance between neurodegeneration and viral propagation determines the outcome of infection.",
