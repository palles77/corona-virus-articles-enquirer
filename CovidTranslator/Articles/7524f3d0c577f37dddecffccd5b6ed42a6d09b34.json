The Z-isomer was more stable than the E-isomer. The Z-isomers ((Z)-5) were reacted with phosphonate reagents under two different conditions to obtain various butadiene derivatives (12) containing benzo[b]furo[3,2-d][1,3]oxazine skeleton. Typical compounds (5 and 12) were evaluated for their anti-osteoclastic bone resorption activity, antagonistic activity for the cysLT1 receptor and growth inhibitory activity for MIA PaCa-2 and MCF-7. Compounds 12f and 12j showed potent anti-osteoclastic bone resorption activity comparable to E 2 (17b-estradiol).",

SERMs are characterized by at least two common structural features, a phenolic hydroxyl group and a phenoxyethylamino group (phenyl-OCH 2 CH 2 N-). 14a,b The phenoxyethylamino group has been postulated to be important for binding to the central core of the estrogen receptor. 14c It has also been suggested to influence the endometrial properties of SERMs in women by the antiestrogenic side chain. 14a,b,d We recently reported that the compound 4 15 prepared in our current studies displayed very potent anti-bone resorption activity in vitro and exhibits a potent anti-osteopenic effect in vivo.

Some kinds of 2-acetyl-3-acylaminobenzo[b]furans (9d, 15 9e-g, 9h, 15 9i-o) were prepared by reactions of 8a and 8b with various acid chlorides such as (E)-5-phenylpenta-2-enonyl chloride, 19 cinnamoyl chlorides, 20 (E,E)-5-phenylpenta-2,4-dienoyl chlorides, 21 crotonyl chloride, 2-hexenoyl chloride and (E)-2-methylbut-2-enoyl chloride. The physical and spectral data of 2-acetyl-3-acylaminobenzo[b]furans (9) were listed in Table S1 , see Supplementary data. To a VM reagent prepared from POCl 3 with dry N,Ndimethylformamide (DMF) at 6\u00b0C was added 2-acetyl-5-bromo-(E)-3-cinnamoylaminobenzo[b]furan (9d). The reaction mixture was stirred at 25\u00b0C for 30 h, and an orange precipitate was deposited. Purification of the orange precipitate (presumed to be the immonium salt) 1 was difficult because of its chemical instability. An orange suspension of this precipitation in water was treated with 10% NaOH aqueous solution with vigorous stirring, and an orange powder was obtained (Method A). The orange powder could also be obtained by treating the orange suspension with triethylamine (Method B). Recrystallization of each orange powder from CHCl 3 -ethyl acetate (5:1) gave orange needles (representative 5a, mp 213-216\u00b0C, 46% (Method B)) (Scheme 3). 1 H NMR (HMBC, HMQC), MS and elemental analysis data of 5a supported cyclization of oxazine ring fused at the 2-and 3-position of the benzo[b]furan ring. Compound 5a was presumed to be a novel (E or Z)-(8bromo-(E)-2-styrylbenzo[b]furo[3,2-d][1,3]oxazin-4-ylidene)acetaldehyde with a characteristic exo-formylmethylene group on the oxazine ring. These data were, however, insufficient to confirm the structure of 5a. Attempts to prepare single crystals of 5a for X-ray analysis were unsuccessful. Thus, 5a was treated with diethyl 2-(diethylamino)-2-oxoethylphosphonate (11a) under Horner-Wadsworth-Emmons (HWE) reaction conditions to afford a butadiene derivative (12a) of which single crystals were successfully prepared. X-ray analysis of 12a demonstrated it to be (Z)-4- Fig. 1 ). 1 Consequently, a novel oxazine compound 5a was determined to be (Z)-",

These reactions might proceed via a cyclic titanium complex. 25e 4H-3,1-Benzoxazines showed various kinds of physiology activity. 2-8 Therefore we performed two kinds of small scale bioactive assays to find novel bioactivity for compounds prepared here. First, we evaluated the anti-osteoclastic bone resorption in vitro of seven representative compounds ((Z)-5a, (Z)-5l, 12a, 12b, 12d, 12f, 12j) prepared in this work. By coculture of fresh bone marrow preosteoclasts expressing the receptor activator of NF-jB (RANK) with calvarial osteoblasts that express the ligand for RANK (RANKL), bone resorbing osteoclasts developed and formed resorption pits on a dentin slice. PGE 2 stimulated pit formation, and estrogens (e.g., estrogen 2 (E 2 )) inhibited PGE 2 -stimulated pit formation by suppressing the RANKL effect. 26 Among the compounds tested, the ethyl ester 12f and phosphonate 12j showed potent inhibition comparable to E 2 , whereas the amide (12a, 12b, 12d) and exo-formylmethylene compounds ((Z)-5a, (Z)-5l) were inactive (Fig. 3) . 27 The butadiene moiety with an ester or a phosphonate functional group might play an important role in inhibiting osteoclasts.",

(E and Z-(8-bromo- [1, 3] oxazin-4-ylidene)acetaldehydes (5) bearing the characteristic exo-formylmethylene group at the 4-position were prepared by this reaction. 30 Unsaturated aldehydes (Z)-5 were reacted with several phosphonate reagents under two reaction conditions to afford the butadiene derivatives (12) having an ester or phosphonate or amide group on the terminal carbon in the butadiene moiety. The butadiene ester and phosphonate compound (12f, 12j) showed potent anti-osteoclastic bone resorption activity comparable to E 2 (17b-estradiol), and the evaluation of these activities of most of all prepared compounds is under way. These results including detail mechanism of biological activities will be reported elsewhere in due course. The exoformylmethylene compound (Z)-5f and the butadiene amide 12p inhibited cell growth of MIA PaCa-2 and MCF-7, respectively.
