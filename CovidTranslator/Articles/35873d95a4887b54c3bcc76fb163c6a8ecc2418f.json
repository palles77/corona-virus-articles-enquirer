            "text": "High interindividual variation in growth performance is commonly observed in veal calf production and appears to depend on milk replacer (MR) composition. Our first objective was to examine whether variation in growth performance in healthy veal calves can be predicted from early life characterization of these calves. Our second objective was to determine whether these predictions differ between calves that are fed a highor low-lactose MR in later life. A total of 180 male Holstein-Friesian calves arrived at the facilities at 17 \u00b1 3.4 d of age, and blood samples were collected before the first feeding. Subsequently, calves were characterized in the following 9 wk (period 1) using targeted challenges related to traits within each of 5 categories: feeding motivation, digestion, postabsorptive metabolism, behavior and stress, and immunology. In period 2 (wk 10-26), 130 calves were equally divided over 2 MR treatments: a control MR that contained lactose as the only carbohydrate source and a low-lactose MR in which 51% of the lactose was isocalorically replaced by glucose, fructose, and glycerol (2:1:2 ratio). Relations between early life characteristics and growth performance in later life were assessed in 117 clinically healthy calves. Average daily gain (ADG) in period 2 tended to be greater for control calves (1,292 \u00b1 111 g/d) than for calves receiving the low-lactose MR (1,267 \u00b1 103 g/d). Observations in period 1 were clustered per category using principal component analysis, and the resulting principal components were used to predict performance in period 2 using multiple regression procedures. Variation in observations in period 1 predicted 17% of variation in ADG in period 2. However, this was mainly related to variation in solid feed refusals. When ADG was adjusted to equal solid feed intake, only 7% of the variation in standardized ADG in period 2, in fact reflecting feed efficiency, could be explained by early life measurements. This indicates that >90% of the variation in feed efficiency in later life could not be explained by early life characterization of the calves. It is speculated that variation in health status explains a substantial portion of variation in feed efficiency in later life. Significant relations between fasting plasma glucose concentrations, fecal pH, drinking speed, and plasma natural antibodies in early life (i.e., not exposed to the lactose replacer) and feed efficiency in later life depended on MR composition. These measurements are therefore potential tools for screening calves in early life on their ability to cope with MR varying in lactose content.",

            "text": "High interindividual variation in growth performance is commonly observed in veal calf production. For instance, the coefficient of variation (CV) in ADG in healthy calves fed equal levels of nutrient intake was 5.9% for calves aged 13 to 26 wk (Gilbert et al., 2015b) , 12.3% for calves aged approximately 6.5 to 9.5 wk (Labussi\u00e8re et al., 2008) , and 21.3% for calves aged 3 to 6 wk (Akinyele and Harshbarger, 1983) . This interindividual variation occurs in the absence of clinical disease and at similar nutrient intake and therefore results mainly from variation in feed efficiency. Variation in feed efficiency can originate from variation in many biological processes. Assessing the ability of calves to respond to specific stimuli related to biological sources of variation might explain the variation in feed efficiency. We therefore designed targeted measurements related to feeding motivation, digestion, postabsorptive metabolism, behavior and stress, and immunology to characterize calves in early life kept under equal feeding and husbandry conditions. If these early life measures show genetic variation and thus consistency over time and are related to feed efficiency, such an early life characterization could be predictive of later life feed efficiency in healthy calves. Indeed, in beef cattle divergently selected for residual feed intake (a measure for feed efficiency), variation in feeding patterns, feed digestion, protein turnover, tissue metabolism, heat production, activity, and stress contributed to variation in feed efficiency Herd and Arthur, 2009 ). These phenotypic measures explained most of the genetic variation in residual feed intake. Such relations between animal characteristics and feed efficiency suggest that these characteristics could be used as early life measures to predict later life feed efficiency in veal calves.",

            "text": "Veal calves are fed milk replacers (MR), which commonly contain 40 to 50% lactose. High and fluctuating dairy prices are a major economic incentive to replace lactose from MR with alternative energy sources. However, differences in growth rates between individual calves increased further when lactose was replaced from the MR. For instance, the CV in ADG increased from 5.9 to 8.4% when lactose was partially replaced with maltose, although ADG decreased (Gilbert et al., 2015b) . This illustrates that variation in growth performance depends on MR composition and that not all calves are equally able to cope with lactose replacers (i.e., lowlactose MR). Digestive and metabolic processes may contribute to this increase in interindividual variation in growth performance when feeding low-lactose MR. For example, the CV in apparent ileal disappearance of DM increased from 5.0 to 6.9% when partly replacing lactose with maltose (Gilbert et al., 2015a) , and the CV in urinary glucose excretion increased from 42 to 82% when partly replacing lactose with glucose, fructose, or glycerol (Gilbert et al., 2016) . Predictions of feed efficiency of calves from traits measured in early life might therefore differ between calves fed a high-or low-lactose MR. Our objectives were (1) to examine whether variation in growth performance of healthy veal calves can be predicted from early life characterization of these calves and (2) to determine whether these predictions differ between calves that are fed a high-or low-lactose MR in later life.",

Blood samples were therefore collected at arrival before the first feeding as an indicator of the individual conditions upon arrival. A jugular blood sample was collected by venipuncture in lithium heparin tubes to determine hematocrit and the titers of natural antibodies (IgG and IgM). Blood was transferred to nonheparinized capillaries and centrifuged at 9,600 \u00d7 g for 4 min using a microcentrifuge (Heraeus Pico 17; Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA), and the percentage of red blood cells was calculated. Plasma was harvested from the remaining blood after centrifugation and stored at \u221220\u00b0C pending IgG and IgM titer analyses. In addition, a second blood sample was taken and analyzed for Hb concentration. No iron was administered following this first Hb check. In wk 5, 1 fecal sample was taken directly from the rectum and analyzed for the presence of pathogens (rotavirus, coronavirus, Escherichia coli K99, and Cryptosporidium) using an immunoassay (BIO K 288; Bio-X Diagnostics, Rochefort, Belgium). In wk 2 and 6, calf shape was measured. Heart girth and body length were measured to calculate the surface area of the body, assuming a cylinder and calculating surface area as (2\u03c0 \u00d7 r 2 ) + (\u03c0 \u00d7 d \u00d7 h), where r = heart girth/2\u03c0, d = 2 \u00d7 r, and h = body length. Surface area was divided by BW to assess calf shape (cm 2 /kg of BW). In addition, measurements were performed to characterize the calves. Most of these measurements were designed as challenges because these will likely cause more variation between animals, especially for metabolic measures under strong homeostatic control (Blair et al., 1990) . Targeted challenges were performed related to the following categories: feeding motivation, digestion, postabsorptive metabolism, behavior and stress, and immunology.",

            "text": "Postabsorptive Metabolism. In beef cattle, residual feed intake and plasma insulin concentration tended to be genetically related . In addition, protein turnover was identified to contribute to variation in feed efficiency in beef cattle . Indicators of protein catabolism, such as urea production, could therefore be used to explain variation in feed efficiency. In wk 7, after overnight fasting, postabsorptive metabolism was assessed during an MR meal challenge followed by a fasting challenge. Milk replacer was provided with a movable MR mixer and dispenser. Milk replacer supply was calculated as the difference between the weighed amount of MR before feeding and the remaining MR in the dispenser after feeding divided by the number of calves fed per feeding round (20 calves/feeding round), and MR supply was 506 \u00b1 13 g (mean \u00b1 SD). Each individual MR meal was supplemented with 41 mg of 13 C urea (99 atom%; Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO). Jugular blood samples 8091 were collected by venipuncture at \u22121.6 (basal), 1, 2, 6, 15, and 24 h after MR feeding in lithium heparin tubes for insulin, 13 C urea, and IGF-1 analysis and in sodium fluoride tubes for glucose, l-lactate, and nonesterified fatty acid (NEFA) analysis. Plasma was harvested after centrifugation and stored at \u221220\u00b0C pending analysis for glucose (all samples), insulin (\u22121.6, 1, 2, 6, and 15 h), l-lactate (all samples), NEFA (all samples), and 13 C urea enrichment (all postprandial time points for 10 randomly selected calves and for other calves at 1, 6, and 15 h after feeding). It can be expected that dilution of plasma 13 C urea is caused by endogenous urea production by the calf after 13 C urea absorption; therefore, the rate of 13 C urea dilution can be used as an indicator for urea production, as shown in pigs by Oosterveld et al. (2005) . Moore et al. (2005) found a strong genetic correlation between plasma IGF-1 concentration measured before and after weaning in Angus cattle, and plasma IGF-1 was genetically correlated with residual feed intake. Therefore, IGF-1 was analyzed in the \u22121.6 h plasma samples. For the meal challenge, calculated variables included the increase in plasma glucose, llactate, and insulin from basal to peak, which was 1 or 2 h postprandial, and the decrease in plasma NEFA from basal to 1 h postprandial. For the fasting challenge, variables included the decrease in plasma glucose and the increase in plasma NEFA concentration from 15 to 24 h after feeding and the decrease in 13 C urea enrichment from 6 to 15 h after feeding.",

In pigs divergently selected for residual feed intake for 6 generations, less efficient pigs had a higher fasting-and activity-related heat production (Barea et al., 2010) , of which the latter was partially related to differences in feeding behavior (Gilbert et al., 2009) . Behavioral measurements were therefore also performed. In wk 7, a human approach test was performed during the morning and afternoon feedings as described by Lensink et al. (2003) . In short, in phase 1 (i.e., approach phase), 1 person approached a drinking calf and noted whether the calf stopped drinking. In phase 2 (i.e., touch phase), the withdrawal reaction of the calf to the outstretching arm of the approaching person was scored from 1 (no withdrawal) to 4 (strong withdrawal reaction) 10 min after phase 1. For both phases, the mean score of each calf was calculated.",

Two calves were considered to be missing values for all variables related to the meal and fasting challenges because these calves appeared to have drunk their MR in the rumen. This appeared from the low increase in 13 C enrichment in plasma urea (<0.005 atom%) from 1 to 6 h postprandial, a postprandial increase in plasma glucose <1 mmol/L, and the absence of a postprandial decrease in plasma NEFA concentration. For fecal DM and pH, 16 calves were considered missing values as they tested positive on fecal pathogens. Additional analyses revealed that fecal pathogens were related to fecal DM (P = 0.021) and pH (P = 0.023). For the feeding motivation test with MR and for drinking speed of MR, 11 calves were considered missing values because they used a floating drinking teat. A drinking teat was used when calves showed difficulties with drinking MR directly from the bucket at arrival at the facilities. The mode of feeding MR affected intake during the feeding motivation test (P = 0.011) as well as drinking speed (P < 0.001). Furthermore, measurements performed within 3 d after individual medical treatment were considered as missing values (4 calves). Measurements of retention time of MR were not included in the statistical analyses due to a combination of factors. In 14 calves, the green color was not observed in the feces. In 20 calves, more than 20% of the MR was refused.

The effects of retained PC, MR treatment, and the interaction between retained PC and MR treatment on adjusted ADG in period 2 were analyzed. Variables not included in the PCA (i.e., the specific IgG and IgM response to HuSa injection, IGF-1 concentration, and calf shape) were also included in the models. First, the PC and abovementioned variables and the interaction with MR treatment were used in a univariate model. Principal components or interactions with the MR treatment with P < 0.2 were selected. Second, these selected PC and interactions were included in a multivariate model. Principal components or interactions with P > 0.1 were removed from the selection. Finally, the multivariate model with the greatest adjusted coefficient of determination and with all variables or interactions with P < 0.1 was selected. The same procedure as described above was used for selecting the model that explains most of the variation in unadjusted ADG in period 2. These models were performed with the MIXED procedure, including a random effect of pen. When an interaction effect was significant, the estimate statement was used to estimate the regression coefficient \u03b2 and the significance of \u03b2. Model residuals were checked visually on homogeneity of variance.",

However, serum IgG and IgM decrease in calves after birth, and endogenous IgG and IgM production starts between 8 and 16 d of age (Husband et al., 1972) , indicating that the IgG and IgM titers determined in our experiment are a combination of colostral antibodies and antibodies endogenously produced by the calf.",

The withdrawal reaction of calves to an outstretching arm and the movement score during confinement in a weighing scale are believed to reflect fear of humans and flightiness or nervousness, respectively; PC2 was therefore labeled as fearfulness. Basal cortisol concentration and activity level were described as stress and activity in PC3. These 2 separate PC are in agreement with the suggested model of responsiveness in calves along the 2 independent axes fearfulness and activity, which combined could represent the coping style of a calf (van Reenen et al., 2005) . The distance that had to be covered by the calves during routine weighing differed between calves. Distance to the weighing scale was positively correlated with the behavior toward the weighing scale (r = 0.45, P < 0.001) and behavior on the weighing scale (r = 0.20, P = 0.021).

Early life characteristics explained 17% of the variation in growth performance in later life. The ADG in later life was positively related to early life IGF-1 concentration and specific IgM response to HuSa and negatively related to drinking speed, plasma natural antibodies at arrival, and fearfulness in early life. The positive relation between IGF-1 concentration and growth performance in cattle has been reported before (Lund-Larsen et al., 1977; Kerr et al., 1991) , although Kerr et al. (1991) concluded that the predictive value of IGF-1 for final BW was low. In our data, early life IGF-1 concentration was not related to later life ADG adjusted for solid feed intake, indicating that IGF-1 is more related to solid feed intake than to feed efficiency. The negative relation between drinking speed and ADG in later life could have been partly caused by solid feed intake because high drinking speed and solid feed intake were negatively related (r = \u22120.16, P = 0.09). However, drinking speed was still negatively related to ADG after adjusting for solid feed intake, indicating that drinking speed also affected feed efficiency. Interestingly, a negative relation between residual feed intake (a measure of feed efficiency) and rate of eating has been reported for beef cattle as well (Bingham et al., 2009) . The negative relation between fearfulness and ADG in veal calves is in agreement with the generally reported finding that beef cattle with fearful or excitable temperament traits exhibit lower ADG than calmer animals (M\u00fcller and von Keyserlingk, 2006) . Temperamental characteristics and growth performance are often measured at the same time, but our data indicate that these characteristics also have a predictive value for later life growth performance. The mechanism behind the association between behavioral responsiveness to challenge and ADG in cattle is not clear, but it has been suggested that fearfulness negatively affects metabolism or feed efficiency (Cooke, 2014) . Interestingly, however, in the present study fearfulness was no longer related to ADG adjusted for solid feed refusals. This might indicate that fearfulness enhanced the occurrence of feed refusalswhich in turn attenuated ADG-rather than affected metabolism or feed efficiency. We applied a restricted feeding schedule to minimize variation in ADG related to variation in feed intake. However, refusals of solid feed occurred, resulting in variation in solid feed intake between calves (the CV of solid feed intake in later life was 22%). Therefore, the relation between growth performance in later life and early life measurements were at least in part related to solid feed and total energy intake.",

Early life characteristics explained only 7% of variation in feed efficiency in later life. Mainly interactions between early life characteristics and MR treatment affected feed efficiency significantly. Fasting plasma glucose was negatively related to feed efficiency in control calves and positively, although numerically, related to feed efficiency in GFG calves. Similarly, the relation between feed efficiency and fecal pH, drinking speed, and plasma natural antibodies at arrival differed between control calves and GFG calves. Drinking speed and fasting plasma glucose loaded positively on sPC1 in the secondary PCA, indicating that these early life characteristics could have a common underlying mechanism, which related negatively to feed efficiency in later life in control calves. Regardless of the mechanisms underlying these significant interactions, the early life characteristics (fasting plasma glucose, fecal pH, drinking speed, and plasma natural antibodies at arrival) can potentially be used for screening calves in early life on their ability to cope with MR varying in lactose content.",

This could indicate that a large part of the variation cannot be predicted by early life characteristics or that a large part of the variation is attributable to factors not taken into account in this study. In our study, utmost care was taken to prevent taking observations from calves during periods of clinical disease. However, variation in health inevitably occurred and may have affected some observations in early life or feed efficiency in later life. Individual medi-cal treatments in later life were registered for 23 calves. Days on medical treatment and adjusted ADG in later life were negatively related (r = \u22120.19, P = 0.040), indicating that clinical signs of illness or the medical treatment itself affected feed efficiency. The percentage of variance explained in feed efficiency increased from 6.5 to 11% when excluding the 23 calves that had received individual medical treatment, indicating that clinical disease contributed to interindividual variation in feed efficiency.",

            "text": "The effect of variation in health status or subclinical disease within our setting of minimized clinical disease is further illustrated by associations between calves housed together in one pen. Gastrointestinal and respiratory disorders often start localized within the stables. Usually, when >10% of the calves have clinical signs of illness, metaphylactic treatments are applied to the complete batch of calves. This procedure is reflected in the substantially greater use of group antimicrobial treatment than individual antimicrobial treatment in veal systems (Pardon et al., 2012) . Calves within close vicinity to an infected calf will be exposed to the pathogen and possibly subsequent disease, whereas clinical disease will likely be prevented in calves housed farther away. Therefore, calves within a pen affect each other more than calves between pens. This is also reflected in the large percentage (i.e., 30%) of variation in feed efficiency that was associated with the random pen effect in our study, although factors other than health status also contribute to this pen effect. This emphasizes the importance of health status in explaining variation in feed efficiency in veal calves. Inflammatory status could contribute to variation in feed efficiency. For instance, hepatic expression of genes associated with inflammatory processes differed in beef cattle divergent for residual feed intake (Alexandre et al., 2015; Paradis et al., 2015) . Mitochondrial function might also explain variation in feed efficiency. A higher mitochondrial respiration rate was found, for instance, in muscle tissue of beef steers with a low residual feed intake compared with beef steers with a high residual feed intake (Kolath et al., 2006) . Electron leakage and H 2 O 2 production was reduced in muscle mitochondria of pigs genetically selected for low residual feed intake (Grubbs et al., 2013) . Indicators of inflammation and mitochondrial function should be included in future studies to evaluate their contribution to interindividual variation in feed efficiency in veal calves.",

Seven of 10 retained sPC had high load-ings on PC from different categories, indicating that these categories have common underlying mechanisms. For instance, drinking speed, fasting plasma glucose, and IGF-1 concentration were positively associated in sPC1. The positive association between fasting plasma glucose concentrations and IGF-1 concentration in the basal plasma sample is in agreement with data presented by Chelikani et al. (2004) , where lowered plasma glucose concentrations coincided with lowered plasma IGF-1 concentrations in response to fasting in dairy cattle. In addition, plasma glucose and IGF-1 concentrations were positively related to plasma leptin concentrations (Chelikani et al., 2004) , an important hormone in regulating feed intake (reviewed by Ahima and Flier, 2000) . When plasma glucose and IGF-1 concentrations decrease in response to fasting, leptin concentrations decrease as well, which stimulates feed intake. In our study, glucose and IGF-1 concentrations were positively associated with drinking speed, indicating that leptin is probably not the underlying mechanism in sPC1. Regardless of the underlying mechanisms, the associations found by secondary PCA suggest that the responses of calves to challenges related to feeding motivation, digestion, postabsorptive metabolism, and behavior cannot be interpreted as separately functioning systems but rather contribute together to the physiology of the animal.",

This indicates that >90% of the variation in feed efficiency in later life could not be explained by early life characterization of calves. It is hypothesized that variation in health status explains substantial variation in feed efficiency in veal calves.
