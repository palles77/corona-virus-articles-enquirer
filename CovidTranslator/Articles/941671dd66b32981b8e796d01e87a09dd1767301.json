However, the higher sensitivity of respiratory viral nucleic acid amplification tests has made the interpretation of the positive results challenging. One way to correlate the presence of a specific virus with clinical disease is by virus quantification; few studies have demonstrated the association of higher hMPV viral load and more severe LRI outcome 3, 8, 9 . Because hMPV is phylogenetically and clinically closely related to respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) 1, 5 , it can be postulated that hMPV has the same tendency to induce acute otitis media (AOM) as RSV, an apparent ototropic virus 10 . During AOM, hMPV has been detected in 8% to 13% of NPS samples 11, 12 and in 2.3% of middle ear fluids (MEF) 12 . However, the role of hMPV in inducing AOM in children requires further study.",

The study was performed between January 2003 and March 2007 at the University of Texas Medical Branch in Galveston, Texas, USA, and was approved by the local Institutional Review Board. The study protocol has been described previously 10 . In brief, healthy children were enrolled at the age of 6 months to 3 years; they were followed for one year for occurrences of URI and AOM. The parents informed the study personnel when the child developed URI symptoms. Children were seen by a study physician, and followed closely for 4 weeks for the occurrence of AOM. At the study visit, otoscopic and physical examinations, and tympanometry were performed. AOM complicating URI was considered when AOM occurred within 28 days of the onset of URI. AOM was defined as 1) acute onset of symptoms, 2) signs of tympanic membrane inflammation and 3) the presence of fluid in the middle ear as documented by pneumatic otoscopy and/or tympanometry. Children were classified as otitis-prone if they had \u22654 OM episodes in one year, \u2265 3 in six months, \u2265 6 by age 6, or the first OM episode prior to age 6 months.",

After extraction, the elution volume was diluted 1:1 with nucleasefree 0.1 mM EDTA (Ambion/Applied Biosystems, Austin, TX). The recovered RNA was converted to cDNA using an iScript synthesis kit (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) in a reaction volume of 40 \u03bcL. Generated cDNA was evaluated using a duplex qPCR assay with primers amplifying hMPV and RSV targets 13 . TaqMan probes (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, Integrated DNA Technologies, Coralville, IA) were used to track the specific amplification in the duplex. Each 25 \u03bcL reaction contained: 12.5 \u03bcL iQ supermix\u2122 (Bio-Rad), 1 \u03bcL (5 \u03bcM) of hMPV and hRSV primers and 0.5 \u03bcL (7.5 \u03bcM) hMPV-FAM and RSV-TX Red probes, 4.5 \u03bcL nuclease-free water and 3 \u03bcL of cDNA template. qPCR was completed in a CFX\u2122 real-time PCR machine (Bio-Rad). Viral genomic titers were extrapolated from standard curves of plasmids harboring the PCR targets generated in parallel for each run. Based on qPCR of known concentrations of positive material, the duplex assay is able to detect as few as 10 copies in 50% of the spiked samples providing a more sensitive assay than many of the other reports.",

The milder inflammatory disease caused by hMPV, compared to RSV may explain the lower rate of complications such as AOM as we reported here. Previously, other investigators reported high rate of concomitant AOM during URI due to hMPV, but these studies didn't use PCR to detect wide variety of respiratory viruses; therefore, there was a possibility that the cases could be hMPV co-infected with other viruses. Williams et al. 7 reported 50% rate of AOM in 118 cases diagnosed retrospectively as hMPV-URI; they only used virus culture-negative samples for PCR detection targeting only hMPV but not other viruses. Heikkinen et al. reported 41% rate of AOM complication in 39 cases of hMPV-URI, including 61% rate in children younger than 3 years 2 . Their study only used PCR to detect hMPV, rhinovirus and enterovirus; the rates for AOM complicating URI associated with other viruses were not reported. The strength of our present study is the use of comprehensive virologic studies, including PCR for broad spectrum of respiratory viruses and the rate of AOM complication was assessed and compared among URI episodes associated with a single virus only, taking out the co-founding factor of co-infections. One other possible reason for our low rate of AOM complicating hMPV-URI could be from the high sensitivity of our novel quantitative PCR assay, which may have detected more hMPV cases even with low viral load and milder disease. In any event, the role of hMPV in AOM has been established; hMPV have been detected from nasopharyngeal specimens of children with AOM, and from the middle ear fluids, with or without pathogenic bacteria 12, 16 .",
