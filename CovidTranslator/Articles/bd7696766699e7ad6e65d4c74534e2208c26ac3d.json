Science can provide timely antimicrobials, even vaccines to help thwart the spread of infections. But disease and health care occur at the street level where person-toperson transmission occurs. Hospital and emergency department (ED) overcrowding remains a significant problem in containing the spread of infections. While some health care facilities (HCF) have improved access to masks and hand sanitizers as well as cough/sneeze etiquette posters, these can have limited value if manpower shortages, cultural imperatives, for example, going to a health care facility with many members of the family, and language and education barriers work against social distancing, personal hygiene, and other containment strategies. Some practices and health care facilities have implemented old pediatric strategies of placing potentially contagious patients into separate areas. Clearly this is a space-, manpower-, and resource-intensive strategy, but one that may reduce transmission of illness from those who are affected. A serious discussion on how to cohort and isolate potentially contagious people, as well as strategies to alleviate overcrowding, much of which stems from the misuse of ED and HCF for primary care problems, is vitally necessary. 47 The change in immigration-from the 1900s where illness often was a disqualification to entry to the 2000s where often very sick and contagious individuals freely enter-needs serious solutions. It seems this discussion, including how to reduce risk at critical population portalsairports, emergency departments, and elsewhere-rarely occurs unless there is threat of a SARS or novel swine flu infection, such as happened in 2003 and 2009, respectively.",
