The Sanitary Conferences led to a binding agreement in 1892-the International Sanitary Convention (ISC)-focused on quarantine for cholera. European states subsequently adopted additional conventions, which were incorporated into a single ISC. By 1926, the ISC covered primarily cholera, yellow fever, and plague. The raison d'\u00eatre of the earliest treaties grew out of a perceived security imperative for powerful countries. Most important was selfprotection against external threats, rather than safeguarding the public's health in every region of the world.",

The WHO Constitution empowered the Organization to adopt regulations to prevent the international spread of disease (Articles 21, 22) . Its power to adopt regulations is far-reaching-binding on Member States unless they affirmatively opt out. 12 In 1951, the WHA exercised this authority to replace the ISC with the International Sanitary Regulations (ISR), covering 6 diseases. In 1969, the WHA revised the ISR, changed their name to the International Health Regulations, and removed typhus and relapsing fever. The WHA removed smallpox in 1981 after its global eradication. By the time the WHA called for fundamental revision of the IHR in 1995, the treaty applied to the same 3 diseases as the original ISC-cholera, plague, and yellow fever-and no others. hemorrhagic fever, it became clear that the IHR were insufficiently flexible to respond to new infectious disease threats. The WHA called for the IHR's revision in 1995, and subsequent resolutions in 2001 and 2002 brought critical attention to the early detection of, and rapid response to, public health threats; yet the WHA took little action to shore up the obvious weaknesses in the IHR. [13] [14] [15] The imperative for global health governance took on fresh urgency with the advent of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). Although SARS cases emerged in November 2002, China delayed notifying the WHO until February 2003. China took 2 additional months before permitting WHO epidemiologists to enter Guangdong province, where the outbreak originated. Later, Beijing conceded it had experienced hundreds more cases than previously reported. 16 Then WHO Director-General Gro Harlem Brundtland criticized China's delays, 17 catalyzing a major political shift toward a global norm of transparency and prompt reporting, further driving IHR reform. 18 The WHA adopted the revised IHR in 2005, with the treaty entering into force in 2007. Currently, the IHR have 196 States Parties-every WHO Member plus Lichtenstein and the Holy See. 19 ",

Although the D-G continued the PHEIC on December 18, 2015, human-to-human transmission has virtually ended in the 3 most affected countries. This robust, albeit delayed, response demonstrates that political resolve and ample financing can bring seemingly intractable health threats under control.",

IHR NFPs throughout the Americas have been reporting laboratoryconfirmed cases of Zika to the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO), which has issued recommendations for the region. 33 Most concerning is a possible association between Zika virus and neurological disease (Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome [GBS]) or fetal abnormalities (microcephaly). Curbing the Zika epidemic will require effective vector control, mosquito and human surveillance, and research for reliable diagnostic tests and a vaccine. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention advised pregnant women to postpone travel to Zika-affected countries. Women who are considering becoming pregnant should talk with their doctor. 34 This is the first time the D-G has declared a PHEIC for a mosquitoborne disease, but the scope of the declaration was narrower than for other PHEICs. Dr. Margaret Chan said, \"I am now declaring that the recent cluster of microcephaly cases and other neurological disorders reported in Brazil, following a similar cluster in French Polynesia in 2014, constitutes a Public Health Emergency of International Concern.\" 35, 36 In other words, the PHEIC was for the cluster of microcephaly and GBS rather than for the Zika virus itself. From a legal perspective, the wording of the PHEIC introduces confusion as neither microcephaly nor GBS is an infectious disease. These neurological and congenital conditions per se do not appear to be hazards that could cross borders under the meaning of Annex 2. It is the Zika virus itself and the mosquito vector that have the potential for international transmission.",

Most MERS cases were linked to hospital settings, and in the absence of sustained community transmission, the Committee concluded the conditions to declare a PHEIC had not been met. 41 For many global health crises, the D-G chose not even to convene an Emergency Committee, including cholera in Haiti, the Fukushima nuclear disaster in Japan, and chemical weapons use in Syria. Each event would have required notification under Annex 2, in addition to the several hundred events that have been reported to the WHO as potential PHEICs.

The more time it takes to detect an event, the slower the response is and the more lives are lost. Every WHO IHR Review Committee and all the major commissions ( Table 1 ) have demanded that States Parties build and strengthen core capacities-all to little avail. 2,43(p12,13) Finding the resources to support health system capacity building has been challenging. While States Parties committed to providing domestic resources to build core capacities, national budgets often neglect this fundamental commitment under the IHR. Many countries with limited resources have had little bandwidth to prioritize building systems for unknown threats as they have struggled to meet the everyday health needs of their populations-ranging from primary care and essential medicines to safe childbirth and healthy mothers and babies. Similarly, the WHO and higher-income States Parties agreed to provide technical and financial assistance to countries in need (Article 44), but with some exceptions, 44,45 very few have funded projects explicitly for building IHR core capacities. The bulwark of international financing has been in the form of vertical funding streams, such as for AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria.

If not, countries were supposed to submit a concrete plan to reach full implementation.

Lowerincome states, perhaps understandably, express reluctance to upgrade their capacities without such assistance.

In 2011, the agency cut its budget by nearly US$600 million due to a severe fiscal deficit, notably its epidemic response capabilities. 47 Its regional structures have also been longstanding problems, with major variability in regional organizations. The D-G has called on governments and donors to build core capacities and has asked for State Party compliance with the IHR, but without impact. 48 All the Ebola commissions have exhibited an implicit distrust in the Organization to make the necessary reforms. Instead, each panel has proposed a well-funded and accountable WHO Centre for Emergency Preparedness and Response. The Harvard-LSHTM Independent Panel on the Global Response to Ebola, for example, insisted that a new center be quasi-independent, with a separate governing board ( Table 2) .",

Developing countries backed Indonesia's claim that it was unfair to require sharing viruses without any reciprocal obligation to make vaccines and medicines affordable. The WHO led a 5-year negotiation resulting in the 2011 Pandemic Influenza Preparedness (PIP) Framework. 49 The PIP Framework, however, applies only to pandemic influenza, and not to other novel pathogens such as SARS, MERS, and Zika. The PIP Framework stands entirely outside the IHR. The regulations, furthermore, are mostly silent on the health security issues of sharing biological materials and genetic sequencing data (GSD), as well as equitable access to medical countermeasures. Article 6(2) of the IHR, however, does offer some guidance for information sharing, stating that States Parties shall continue to provide relevant public health information to the WHO following a potential PHEIC notification, including case definitions, laboratory results, source and type of risk, number of cases and deaths, conditions affecting spread, and the health measures that have been deployed. There is no explicit mention of sharing biological materials or GSD, even though one could broadly interpret Article 6(2) to encompass these data. Certainly, biological materials and GSD are pertinent public health information that would shed light on the conditions affecting the spread of disease.",

As with other spheres of international law, such as in human rights or climate change, civil society could offer \"shadow\" reports and advocate for funding national capacities and fulfilling IHR and human rights obligations. Harnessing the power of CSOs requires more than incorporating them into existing or new IHR functions. Borrowing from the Framework Convention on Tobacco Control, the WHO could regularly host a Conference of the Parties where civil society could meet with governments to advance IHR implementation. The Framework Convention Alliance (CSOs committed to effective implementation of the Framework Convention on Tobacco Control) has propelled tobacco control reforms. A similar CSO network for IHR implementation could be transformative.",

The WHO could develop informal guidelines through Article 11, which allows the agency to share information with States Parties, alerting them to potential emergencies in a graduated fashion. Alternatively, the WHA could adopt a new IHR annex that illustrates the risk gradient, limiting negotiations only to the new annex. To maintain credibility, different grades should trigger clear operational and financial strategies. For example, an intermediate-level emergency could allow the WHO to access resources from the Contingency Fund. Similarly, the World Bank could release PEF funds based on graded emergency declarations by the WHO. 63 The promise of international assistance with adequate funding, even at an early stage, could provide additional incentives for States Parties to report a potential PHEIC through the Annex 2 algorithm. A full PHEIC declaration, however, would still be needed to raise the global alert, stiffen political resolve, and mobilize major resources.",
