Here we describe the mouse virulence properties of high replication fidelity 3D polymerase variants of human enterovirus 71 (HEV71), with mutations at positions 3D-S264L, 3D-G64R or at 3D-S264L plus 3D-G64R. Mouse-adapted strains (MP-G64R, MP-S264L and MP-S264L-G64R) were constructed in order to compare the virulence of the 3D polymerase variants with that of mouse-adapted parental virus (MP-26M). MP-S264L and MP-S264L-G64R were attenuated in mice (mean survival time 7.0 and 7.5 days p.i., respectively) compared to MP-G64R and MP-26M (mean survival time 6.5 and 6.0 days p.i., respectively). MP-26M and MP-G64R infection induced early onset, severe generalised necrotising myositis, whereas MP-S264L and MP-S264L-G64R infection induced a later onset, mild and focal skeletal muscle myositis. Our findings demonstrate that only the 3D-S264L mutation attenuates HEV71 in mice, suggesting that the high replication fidelity phenotype is not essential for virulence attenuation in this model.",

Single-step growth kinetic studies were performed in order to determine if the higher titre growth of the S264L-G64R polymerase variants in RD cells in the presence of ribavirin compared to parental virus was due either wholly or partly to increased replicative capacity. RD cells were infected (MOI = 10) and virus growth was measured over a 24 h time course. The growth kinetics in RD cells of S264L-G64R was compared to parental virus (Fig. 2) . In the absence of ribavirin pressure, S264L-G64R and parental virus populations grew efficiently in RD cells with no statistically significant differences (P > 0.05) observed in their single-step growth kinetics (Fig. 2) . Thus, the 3D-S264L-G64R mutation does not impact significantly on the growth of the S264L-G64R CDV population in RD cells. Viruses were harvested at four hourly intervals for 24 h and yields were quantified by TCID50 assay on Vero cells (Reed and Muench, 1938) .

By contrast, the S264L-G64R had acquired an average of only 1.8 (P < 0.0001) mutations per genome, respectively. Our data indicate that S264L-G64R has a high replication fidelity phenotype, resulting in six-fold fewer mutations being introduced into HEV71 genome during passage in the presence of ribavirin (400 M) compared to parental virus.

We recently extended this observation to HEV71 by demonstrating that two mutations (G64R, S264L) in the HEV71 3D pol generate a high replication fidelity phenotype and restrict genomic diversity (Sadeghipour et al., 2013) . Therefore, in this study, we were interested to determine if these 3D pol mutations also attenuate the virulence of HEV71. Prior to undertaking virulence studies in mice, we constructed a HEV71 strain that incorporates both 3D pol mutations (S264L plus G64R). The double mutant CDV (S264L-G64R) was ribavirin resistant and had a six-fold higher replication fidelity phenotype than parental virus, as we have previously shown for HEV71 strains incorporating single 3D pol mutations (Sadeghipour et al., 2013) . Furthermore, the 3D pol mutations did not alter the replicative capacity of S264L-G64R in RD cell culture.",

By contrast, G64R was not attenuated in mice and had a similar virulence phenotype to parental virus, suggesting that high replication fidelity may not be the sole determinant of virulence attenuation of mouse-adapted HEV71. However, it should be noted that G64R titres in the blood and skeletal muscle tissues of infected mice were significantly lower than in mice infected with parental virus, especially on days 3 and 5 post-infection. This suggests that the G64R mutation may have impacted negatively on viral fitness in vivo without leading to a measurable decrease in virulence in newborn BALB/c mice. Two alternative explanations for our inability to identify virulence attenuation in G64R are worth noting. Firstly, the inherent insensitivity of our newborn mouse model of HEV71 infection may have prevented the detection of attenuation due to the 3D-G64R mutation. Secondly, it is possible that ribavirin mutagenesis may have induced virulence attenuation of HEV71 via a differential effect on quasispecies diversity and the fitness of the S264L and G64R populations, as reported by Sanz-Ramos et al. (2012) .",

As previously noted, a high replication fidelity strain of poliovirus (3D-G64S) is attenuated in mice (Pfeiffer and Kirkegaard, 2005; Vignuzzi et al., 2006 Vignuzzi et al., , 2008 . Furthermore, Castro et al. (2009) identified a conserved lysine residue that contributes to the catalytic efficiency and copying fidelity of all nucleic acid polymerases; mutation of this lysine residue to arginine (K359R) in the poliovirus 3D pol generated a virus population that had a higher replication fidelity phenotype and was more highly attenuated in mice than the G64S variant (Weeks et al., 2012) . Similarly, mutations in the alphavirus chikungunya RNA-dependent RNA polymerase that increase replication fidelity and decrease genome diversity also impact negatively on viral fitness in both vertebrate and invertebrate hosts (Coffey and Vignuzzi, 2011) . Interestingly, mutations in the Coxsackievirus B3 3D pol coding region that generate a low replication fidelity phenotype and increased genome diversity also attenuate virulence in mice (Gn\u00e4dig et al., 2012) . Furthermore, a strain of SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) engineered to express low replication fidelity (inactivation 3 \u2192 5 exonuclease activity) is stably attenuated in mice (Graham et al., 2012) . Sanz-Ramos et al. (2012) reported that a ribavirin mutagenised foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) population was attenuated in mice even though a large proportion of clones within the quasispecies were highly virulent. Furthermore, a 2C-I248T mutation that was associated with the attenuated FMDV population did not attenuate wild type virus when incorporated into an infectious clone (Sanz-Ramos et al., 2008) . Sanz-Ramos et al. (2012) further demonstrated that mixed wild-type and ribavirin-mutagenised FMDV populations were attenuated in mice, suggesting that the mutagenised quasispecies population exerted a suppressive effect on virulence. Genome length sequence analysis and mixed viral population virulence studies of ribavirin-mutagenised HEV71 would enable us to determine if this mechanism also contributes to the attenuated phenotype of S264L.",
