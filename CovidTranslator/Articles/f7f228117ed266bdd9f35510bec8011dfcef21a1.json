This paper will review the technical developments which preceded Koch, and which permitted him to evolve his evidence of causation, particularly for tuberculosis. I will then present subsequent technical advances, up to the present time, which have permitted the identification of new organisms, each of which involved establishing the possible causal relationship to the disease from which it was isolated. In some cases, the discovery of the organism preceded recognition of the disease state with which it was associated. In other cases, the organism discovered by the new technique could not be cultivated in the laboratory or could not be reproduced in an experimental animal, thus not fulfilling the Henle-Koch postulates for causation. BACTERIOLOGY The major discoveries and examples of the organisms found are given in Table 3 . A few points should be emphasized at the start of this discussion. As has been stated so well by Bulloch in his great and comprehensive book, The History of Bacteriology [4] , most advances have evolved in a series of small steps based on the work of several successive investigators, and also the application of the method was not always made by its discoverer or even by those who later perfected the technique.",

The Dutchman, Antony van Leuwenhoek, was said to be the first to apply the light microscope to (1) the identification of living protozoa, in 1675, and (2) to bacteria, in 1675 [4] . This remarkable man ground his own lenses and made some 400 single biconvex microscopes (really more like magnifying glasses), which were capable of enlarging objects some 300 times. In addition to his activities as a lens grinder and microscopist, he was also a draper, haberdasher, wine gauger for the town of Delft, and a qualified surveyor. His discoveries with his microscopes included descriptions of bacteria found in his own teeth and other various morphological bacterial forms, such as cocci and spiral forms. His description of a motile animalcule which he found in his own feces was, in all probability, Giardia lamblia and, if so, was the first parasitic protozoa to be observed in man [4, 8] .",

            "text": "Proper morphological description of organisms under the light microscope required some method of staining them to identify their characteristics better. The earliest efforts were apparently those of Hermann Hoffman in 1869, who employed carmine and fuchsin stains; the former was also used by Weigert in 1871. The staining of bacteria as an art is said to have begun, however, when Weigert showed that methyl violet stain can reveal cocci in tissues [4] . Robert Koch improved on the method by preparing thin films on cover glasses, drying and fixing them in alcohol, and then using various stains, of which methyl violet SB, fuchsin, and analin brown were the most successful. Paul Ehrlich introduced methylene blue, and, by adding an alkali to the dye, which allowed it to penetrate bacilli, Koch was able to identify the tubercle bacillus in 1882. This technique was also the basis of Loeffler's methylene blue stain in 1884 [10] . Ehrlich improved the method of staining the tubercle bacillus by heating the slide and using aniline dye in a technique that was named the Ziehl-Nielsen acid-fast stain. Based on these observations, in 1884 Christian Gram, a Dane, developed (some say by accident) the stain that bears his name, which was made by adding Lugol's solution of iodine, followed by alcohol, and the Ehrlich stain (aniline-water-gentian violet). This stain is still used routinely today: every laboratory applies it to identify an unknown organism. Indeed, the first question in bacteriological classification is whether an organism is Gram-positive or Gram-negative.",

            "text": "In order to study specific bacteria, it was necessary both to find an appropriate medium for their pure culture and a technique to separate out individual organisms, or clones, to determine the homogeneity of the bacteria. Many workers were involved in these tasks, including Pasteur, Cohn, Loeffler, and Klebs. Edwin Klebs (1834-1913) had worked with the tubercle bacillus and with anthrax at the same time as Koch, or even slightly before, and apparently made the first attempts to obtain separate cultures by a technique he termed the \"fractional method.\" Oscar Brefeld, a great mycologist, laid down the basic principles of obtaining pure cultures based on studies of fungi. These observations were published in some 18 volumes. Joseph Lister, the Scottish surgeon who introduced aseptic techniques into the operating room, invented a specially constructed syringe with a graduated nut which could deliver volumes as small as l/loo of a minim. After a millionfold dilution, he was able to deliver a drop containing a single bacterium. In this way he separated single colonies of Bacterium lactis in 1878. Other workers, such as Nagele, Fitz, Hansen, and Salomonsen also used this dilution technique to obtain pure cultures. Parenthetically, it was this dilution technique by which Albert Sabin, some 100 years later, was able to obtain attenuated strains of poliomyelitis viruses that formed the basis of his oral vaccine. In bacterial cultures, it was Robert Koch who devised methods of isolating pure cultures that are still used today. His method was based on the use of clear nutrient gelatin with 1 percent meat extract. He prepared sterile slides, over which the medium was poured, inoculated with a platinum wire or needle, and then placed in a test tube with the sterile gelatin on a slant or upright. This method was demonstrated in 1881 with great acclaim before a distinguished audience in London, which included Lister and Pasteur. By 1883, Koch had improved the technique by mixing the bacterial inoculum with melted gelatin and pouring it over cold sterile glass plates. Students from all over the world flocked to Koch's laboratory in Berlin to learn the method. The ability to separate out and grow a single organism lent great specificity to the search for the causative agent of a disease. In virology, molecular techniques now permit identification of specific viruses, their genetic variability in human passage, and the genomic properties that determine pathogenicity and clinical response patterns. Epidemiologically, these tools in both bacteriology and virology have permitted the tracing of epidemics due to a specific strain of the organism, to differentiate between reactivation of an agent and exogenous reinfection, and to identify many molecular characteristics of the microbial agent responsible for pathogenicity, virulence, and the pattern of host response. For example, the change in even one amino acid may alter a virus so that it is pathogenic, as in the case of rabies virus. VIROLOGY The technical developments discussed above for bacteriology had little influence on the field of virology because viruses differ from bacteria in at least two essential ways: (1) except for the large vaccinia virus, most viruses are smaller in size than bacteria and cannot be seen under the light microscope; viruses require an electron microscope for their visualization; (2) viruses cannot be grown in bacterial media but depend on living tissues for their multiplication, either in a living organism or in tissue cultures derived from human or animal tissues. Thus, the major developments that permitted virology to emerge as a separate discipline were based on filtration methods, by which viruses could be separated from bacteria and other large parasites, the discovery of the electron microscope, and the development of susceptible animal models and of tissue cultures.",

These prion agents cause a number of diseases of animals and man, including a spongiform encephalopathy of sheep (scrapie), mink, and cattle, and kuru, Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD), and Gerstmann-Straussler-Schenker syndrome (GSS) in humans.",

Most of these studies involved known viruses that had been identified by other techniques.

The particles were found to be a new herpes virus, distinct from herpes simplex, varicella zoster, and cytomegalovirus. It was eventually called Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). While identified in Burkitt tumor tissue, its causal relationship to this tumor remained unclear until added means of identifying the presence of EBV or its antibody became available. The latter technique was provided by Gertrude and Werner Henle in 1966 [16] , when they developed an immunofluorescence test for identifying IgG antibody to the viral capsid antigen of the virus. This advance led to both case-control and prospective studies that implicated EBV as an initiator of the pathogenesis of the tumor by creating a proliferation of B lymphocytes. This rapid multiplication of B lymphocytes was augmented by malaria, which is also a B-cell mitogen, and which also impairs the cytotoxic T-cell response to such proliferation. The rapid multiplication of B cells resulted in a chromosomal translocation (from chromosome 8 to chromosome 14, 2, or 22), and, with this, the activation of an oncogene, c-myc, which was the final step in the appearance of a malignant cell whose clonal multiplication constitutes Burkitt's lymphoma.",

These viruses required new ones based on immunological evidence [20] , consisting of (1) the appearance of specific antibody to the agent during the course of the disease, (2) that such immunity protected against primary infection, (3) that only persons lacking the antibody were susceptible to the infection, and (4) that no other antibody could induce similar immunological events.",

These were identified in duodenal cells and stools of children with acute gastroenteritis in Australia by Bishop and associates in 1973-74 [21, 22] . Proof of causation rested on regular identification of the virus in sick children and the appearance of viral-specific antibody. Experimental reproduction of the clinical disease in animals was not possible, and even initial isolation in tissue cultures was extremely difficult. The diagnosis by immune electron microscopy of both virus and antibody was a major technique used for viral identification until easier methods, such as radioimmunoassay and the ELISA (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay) tests were developed. It is now recognized that this group of rotaviruses is the cause of some 30-S50 percent of cases of acute gastroenteritis in children under three years old worldwide. Vigorous attempts to develop a vaccine with attenuated human strains or animal rotaviruses (the so-called Jennerian approach) are under way. Unfortunately, the diversity of rotavirus strains and their poor antigenic properties are making this research a difficult task. Enough evidence of homotypic protection from a vaccine is at hand, however, to indicate fulfillment of one of Huebner's criteria for causation, i.e., that a vaccine prepared from the putative cause should decrease the incidence of the disease [19] .",

This success paved the way for development of a vaccine, a task now being vigorously pursued with both killed and attenuated viral preparations.

Neither of these methods were widely adopted, however, because of the difficulty of maintaining the cultures free of bacterial contamination; control of this problem awaited the discovery of antibiotics. In the meantime, the chicken embryo was discovered to be an important way to cultivate viruses. For example, in 1931 Woodruff and Goodpasture [27] showed that fowlpox virus replicated on the chorioallantoic membrane of developing chicken embryos. Subsequently, other pox viruses and herpes simplex viruses were cultivated in a similar manner, each producing characteristic plaques on the membrane. Many other viruses, such as the myxoviruses (influenza, Newcastle disease virus, and mumps) were also found to grow in the amniotic sac or allantoic cavity of the chick embryo, and many rickettsiae multiplied in the yolk sac. For these microbial agents, the chick embryo was not the initial means of discovery but provided an important media for diagnosis and for their growth for vaccines.",

The addition of antibiotics to their cultures had prevented bacterial and fungal contamination. The use of tissue cultures rapidly expanded from this point onward; however, these two early tissue culture cells did not grow continuously and thus required fresh material for every new viral passage. Other cell lines, derived from human (HeLa, Hep-2, WI-38) and animal sources (Vero), were then developed and shown to multiply continuously in culture. They provided appropriate substrates for the growth of many viruses and for the production of many vaccines. The WI-38 cell line, in particular, was used for many vaccines because it was derived from normal human embryonic lung tissue and did not pose the potential oncogenic problem of introducing cell lines derived from a human malignancy or from an animal source into humans.",

The virus can multiply in both B-and T-type lymphocytes. The prevalence of antibody to this virus has been of the order of 60 percent in healthy donors, indicating that it is a very common and often asymptomatic infection. A true causal relationship to primary infection with the virus appears to exist for exanthem subitum (roseola infantum), a common, febrile rash in young children, and with rare cases of an infectious mononucleosis-like syndrome in young adults [52, 53] . The virus is easily reactivated, and antibody has been found in high titer in 80 percent or so of a number of chronic and malignant conditions, such as the chronic fatigue syndrome, Hodgkin's disease, African Burkitt's lymphoma, and acute lymphocytic leukemia [52] .

For example, it has permitted the identification of HIV in the blood of 90 percent of AIDS patients, even well before antibody appears. It is also present in some infants born of HIV-infected mothers and provides a method to indicate that the infant is infected, since it is impossible to determine for six months or so if the antibody in the infant was derived from the mother or was the result of active infection of the newborn. The method is currently too complex and expensive, however, for such routine diagnostic tests. The PCR technique is based on amplification of impure DNA by simple chemical proliferation in vitro of a predetermined stretch of DNA [59] . The method is capable of amplifying specific DNA sequences more than a millionfold in only a few hours by an automated procedure. At a practical level, it is being applied to the diagnosis of both viral and bacterial infections, as well as to the search for known viral antigens in cancer tissues, such as HTLV-I in T-cell lymphomas, EBV in various lymphomas, hepatitis B and C viruses in liver cancer, and papilloma viruses in cervical cancer [61] . The high sensitivity of the technique also leads to some false-positive reactions, especially cross-contamination from true-positive samples, which have been previously tested in the same laboratory. Careful washing of equipment is essential. While an extremely important method of seeking known microorganisms, the requirement of prior knowledge of a DNA fragment of the infectious agent under study for amplification limits its application with respect to unknown agents. Other molecular techniques, however, have enabled investigators to clone the virus of hepatitis C (HCV) and to develop an antibody test for it before it has been grown in tissue culture, seen under the electron microscope, or serologic identification or genome characterization has been possible. This development has been described by Alter [62] under the interesting title, \"Descartes before the horse: I clone, therefore I am. The hepatitis C virus in current perspective.\" IMMUNOLOGY A key element in establishing that an infectious agent causes a particular disease is the demonstration of the appearance of a specific antibody to the agent, or of a fourfold increase in antibody titer, if antibody is already present when the specimen is taken. The presence of agent-specific IgM antibody is usually indicative of a primary infection, although certain reactivated infections, such as cytomegalovirus, are accompanied by a small IgM response. Another highly important discovery is the development of techniques for producing quantities of highly specific monoclonal antibodies, which was first published by Kohler and Milstein in 1975 [63] . The application of monoclonal antibodies to viral diagnosis has greatly enhanced demonstration of the specificity of the immune response, permitting differentiation between strains of the same agent and of differentiation of a reactivated infection from one due to exogenous reinfection.",

            "text": "The observation by Edward Jenner that persons who got well after cowpox were immune to smallpox led to his introduction of cowpox vaccine in 1798 [65] . This was an empiric discovery without scientific basis at the time, but the concept on which it was based has withstood the test of time and has eventually led to the complete eradication of smallpox from the world in 1977. About 100 years after Jenner's publication, Louis Pasteur and his associates began the scientific approach to immunology by preparing attenuated strains of microorganisms for protection against infectious diseases, first with fowl cholera vaccine in 1878-80 [66] and then with anthrax in 1881 [67] . Based on Jenner's contribution, Pasteur coined the term \"vaccine\" (from vacca, Latin for cow) for these immunizations. The use of these living attenuated, as well as heat-killed, cultures, for prophylaxis against infectious diseases, constitutes active immunization. The proof that this type of immunity, called humoral immunity, was due to antibody production occurred with the sentinel observation of Behring and Kitasato in 1890 [68] . They demonstrated the neutralizing antitoxic activity of sera from animals immunized with tetanus toxin and also that this antitoxic activity protected the animals against infection. This observation was followed one week later by a paper by Behring alone, showing the same to be true of diphtheria toxin. In their joint paper, it was also shown that the neutralizing activity of tetanus antitoxin could be transferred by serum from immunized animals to uninoculated animals and would result in protection, a process now known aspassive immunization. In 1895, Calmette published evidence of the neutralizing property in snake venom antiserum [69] . A mechanism to explain how antibody is produced and how it acts was proposed by Paul Ehrlich in 1897 and was termed the \"side-chain\" or \"receptor\" theory [70] .",

Huebner also added the concept that longitudinal epidemiological studies were helpful in establishing causation, as was the demonstration that protection against infection followed the use of a vaccine prepared using the candidate causal agent. Later, for infectious agents which could not be grown in tissue culture, the demonstration of an immune response to the candidate agent constituted the major basis for causal inferences. Examples of this type are the role of EBV in infectious mononucleosis and that of hepatitis B virus in viral hepatitis.

Perhaps the first demonstration of this phenomenon and of its use as a diagnostic test was the discovery by Koch of the tuberculin test [72] . Cell-mediated immunity is important in the control of viruses, fungi, and other intracellular bacteria and parasites. Although the skin test is used in the diagnosis of many of these infections, it has not been included as a criterion of causal proof of an infectious disease.
