            "text": "Most viral diseases, with the exception of those caused by human immunodeficiency virus, are self-limited illnesses that do not require specific antiviral therapy. The currently available antiviral drugs target 3 main groups of viruses: herpes, hepatitis, and influenza viruses. With the exception of the antisense molecule fomivirsen, all antiherpes drugs inhibit viral replication by serving as competitive substrates for viral DNA polymerase. Drugs for the treatment of influenza inhibit the ion channel M 2 protein or the enzyme neuraminidase. Combination therapy with Interferon-\u03b1 and ribavirin remains the backbone treatment for chronic hepatitis C; the addition of serine protease inhibitors improves the treatment outcome of patients infected with hepatitis C virus genotype 1.",

Some antiviral drugs possess multiple potential clinical applications, such as ribavirin for the treatment of chronic hepatitis C and respiratory syncytial virus and cidofovir for the treatment of cytomegalovirus and other DNA viruses. Drug resistance is an emerging threat to the clinical utility of antiviral drugs. The major mechanisms for drug resistance are mutations in the viral DNA polymerase gene or in genes that encode for the viral kinases required for the activation of certain drugs such as acyclovir and ganciclovir. Widespread antiviral resistance has limited the clinical utility of M 2 inhibitors for the prevention and treatment of influenza infections. This article provides an overview of clinically available antiviral drugs for the primary care physician, with a special focus on pharmacology, clinical uses, and adverse effects. viral thymidine kinase (TK) and subsequently by human enzymes. Acyclovir-triphosphate serves as a competitive substrate for viral DNA polymerase, and its incorporation into the DNA chain results in termination of viral replication. Acyclovir is approved for the treatment of primary and recurrent genital HSV infection (Table 1) . 2, 4, 5 Topical acyclovir may be used to treat genital herpes, but the oral formulation is generally recommended 6 ; IV acyclovir is used for severe cases. 1, 4 Suppressive therapy with oral acyclovir is also indicated to reduce the incidence of recurrent genital herpes. 4, 7 Oral acyclovir is modestly efficacious against orolabial herpes. In immunocompetent individuals, orolabial herpes is often self-limited, and antiviral treatment is generally not recommended. 7 However, oral acyclovir may be indicated for severe cases, for those with recurrent orolabial herpes, and in those who are immunocompromised. 7, 8 Intravenous acyclovir is the first-line treatment for HSV encephalitis 9 and should be started as soon as the disease is suspected clinically. Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain typically demonstrates temporal lobe involvement, and diagnosis is confirmed by detection of HSV DNA in the CSF. Major studies have evaluated the efficacy of 10 days of acyclovir treatment for HSV encephalitis; however, the recommended duration of treatment in the clinical setting is 2 to 3 weeks because shorter durations have been associated with relapse. 10 The treatment duration may be further prolonged in immunocompromised patients. 8 Acyclovir is also approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of VZV 11,12 ; however, young immunocompetent patients with zoster may not require treatment if the lesions are localized and have been present for more than 72 hours. Intravenous acyclovir is recommended for patients with disseminated zoster disease or visceral involvement. Acyclovir treatment of zoster reduces duration of viral shedding, formation of new lesions, and short-and long-term neuralgia. 13 Therapy should be started early, but even delayed initiation of acyclovir may still be beneficial in immunocompromised patients. Shortcourse prednisone may be added as an adjunct to acyclovir treatment of zoster to improve quality of life, especially in elderly patients.",

Oral acyclovir is used to prevent HSV during the early period after transplant in patients not receiving ganciclovir or valganciclovir prophylaxis. 14 Acyclovir is generally well tolerated. However, IV acyclovir may cause reversible nephrotoxicity in 5% to 10% of patients because of intratubular precipitation of acyclovir crystals. Acyclovir crystalline nephropathy is more common when acyclovir is given as a rapid infusion (reaching serum concentrations >25 \u03bcg/mL) 15 and in patients with dehydration and preexisting renal impairment. 16 Adequate hydration, a slower rate of infusion, and dosing based on renal function may reduce this risk. Reversible neurologic symptoms such as delirium and seizures may occur rarely in elderly people and those with renal impairment; this toxicity has been associated with high serum acyclovir concentrations 15 and high CSF levels of its metabolite 9-carboxymethoxymethylguanine. [17] [18] [19] Other adverse effects are gastrointestinal symptoms, myelosuppression, and rash. 3, 20, 21 Acyclovir-resistant HSV has been reported, especially in immunocompromised patients. [22] [23] [24] Resistance occurs by selection of viral mutants that are deficient in TK (which results in an inability to activate acyclovir) or that have altered DNA polymerase with reduced affinity to acyclovirtriphosphate. 23",

Oral valganciclovir is well absorbed and converted to ganciclovir by first-pass intestinal or hepatic metabolism. 79 The bioavailability of ganciclovir after valganciclovir administration is about 60%, and peak plasma concentrations are achieved in 1 to 3 hours. 80,81 Valganciclovir is eliminated renally as ganciclovir. 80, 82 Valganciclovir exerts its antiviral activity in the form of ganciclovir-triphosphate, which inhibits viral replication by serving as a competitive substrate for CMV DNA polymerase. Valganciclovir was first approved by the FDA for treatment of CMV retinitis in patients with AIDS. 83 For immediate sight-threatening lesions, valganciclovir is used in combination with an intravitreal ganciclovir implant. Valganciclovir is also used for preventing CMV disease in high-risk CMV donor-positive/recipient-negative recipients of kidney, heart, or kidney-pancreas transplants. 61, 84 In the United States, valganciclovir is not approved for preventing CMV disease in liver recipients because of a higher incidence of tissue-invasive CMV disease in patients who received valganciclovir vs oral ganciclovir prophylaxis. In other countries, valganciclovir is used for preventing CMV disease in all solid organ transplant recipients. It has recently gained approval for the prevention of CMV disease in pediatric heart and kidney transplant recipients. It can also be used to preemptively treat asymptomatic CMV infection in transplant recipients. [85] [86] [87] [88] Valganciclovir was recently demonstrated to be as effective as IV ganciclovir for treating mild to moderate CMV disease in transplant recipients. 86, 87, 89 Bone marrow suppression is the most common adverse effect of valganciclovir. Gastrointestinal manifestations, such as diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting, may be observed. Resistance to valganciclovir occurs through mechanisms identical to those underlying ganciclovir resistance, ie, through mutations in the gene, which encodes for CMV kinase, and the gene, which encodes for CMV DNA polymerase. 71 VIDARABINE Vidarabine, a purine nucleoside obtained from was historically used for treating HSV and VZV. Acyclovir has since become the preferred drug for these conditions. 90 Vidarabine is currently available only as an ophthalmic solution for treating recurrent epithelial keratitis and acute keratoconjunctivitis. 90 Once phosphorylated into its active form, vidarabine inhibits viral DNA polymerase. Adverse effects of ophthalmic vidarabine include irritation, pain, photophobia, lacrimation, and occlusion of the lacrimal duct. 90",

Oseltamivir is as effective as the other neuraminidase inhibitor, zanamivir, in reducing the febrile period during infection with influenza A (H1N1), influenza A (H3N2), and influenza B virus. 99 Oseltamivir is also used for postexposure prophylaxis against influenza A and B, including pandemic strains. For this indication, oseltamivir should be started within 48 hours of exposure and continued daily for at least 10 days or for up to 6 weeks during an outbreak. A systematic review reported no statistically significant difference between oseltamivir and zanamivir prophylaxis for preventing symptomatic influenza among immunocompetent adults. 100 The most common adverse effects of oseltamivir are nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, insomnia, and vertigo. Neuropsychiatric adverse effects, including delirium, abnormal behavior, and hallucinations, have been reported. Oseltamivir-resistant influenza A virus has been reported. 101-103 Mutations in the neuraminidase gene, such as R292K 101 and H274Y, 98 account for oseltamivir resistance. Surveillance conducted during the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic detected sporadic and infrequent incidence of oseltamivir-resistant pandemic (H1N1) 2009 influenza virus. All resistant viruses had neuraminidase mutations (most commonly H275Y mutation) that conferred resistance to oseltamivir, but not to zanamivir. 104 Oseltamivir resistance among influenza B viruses occurs less frequently. 105 Zanamivir. Zanamivir is an inhaled neuraminidase inhibitor that is used for the treatment and prophylaxis of influenza A and B viruses. 106 Zanamivir is not available orally since it is poorly absorbed. 106 Inhaled zanamivir produces high concentrations in the respiratory tract where influenza virus infection occurs. About 4% to 20% of inhaled zanamivir is absorbed systemically, producing peak serum concentrations at 1 to 2 hours. The absorbed drug is not metabolized and is excreted unchanged in the urine, while the unabsorbed drug is excreted in the feces. 106 The mechanism of action of zanamivir is similar to oseltamivir, by inhibiting neuraminidase, which is essential for release of newly formed viral particles from infected cells. 106 For treatment, zanamivir is given by inhalation twice daily for 5 days, with the therapy begun within 48 hours after symptom onset. Zanamivir can be given once daily for 10 days as postexposure prophylaxis of influenza A and B in household or close contacts. Zanamivir prophylaxis during community outbreaks may be given for 28 days. Zanamivir has occasionally been given IV to treat critically ill patients with influenza. 107, 108 Inhaled zanamivir is well tolerated. 106 Acute bronchospasm with decline in respiratory function has been reported; a bronchodilator should be available if given as treatment for patients with underlying pulmonary disease. Other adverse effects include headache and gastrointestinal symptoms. Hypersensitivity reactions and neuropsychiatric adverse effects occur rarely. 109",

Its triphosphorylated form, ribavirin triphosphate, is a potent competitive inhibitor of inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase, influenza virus RNA polymerase, and mRNA guanylyltransferase. As a result of this competitive inhibition, intracellular guanosine triphosphate pools are markedly reduced and viral nucleic acid and protein synthesis are inhibited.

The specific mechanism of their anti-HBV property is through competitive inhibition of HBV DNA polymerase. Because of their anti-HIV properties, it is highly recommended that CHB patients considered for treatment with these drugs be tested for HIV infection, and monotherapy with these drugs should be avoided for HIV-infected patients to reduce the risk of HIV resistance. Hepatitis B virus may also develop resistance to these drugs, usually after prolonged exposure, and this risk may be reduced by a strategy of combination antiviral therapies. The exact duration of anti-HBV treatment is not defined, and HBV relapse often occurs after discontinuation of treatment. Severe exacerbation of hepatitis may also occur on discontinuation of these drugs; hence, monitoring for hepatotoxicity should be performed after stopping treatment. Lactic acidosis may occur with nucleos(t)ide analogues, and the drugs should be withdrawn if there is a rapid increase in ALT levels, progressive hepatomegaly or steatosis, or acidosis.",

The major aim of treatment is to achieve SVR, which is defined as undetectable HCV RNA at 24 weeks after completion of treatment. A combination regimen of peginterferon-\u03b1 and ribavirin results in SVR rates between 38% and 46%, and the rate is even lower among black patients. Hence, major efforts have been made to develop novel therapies for CHC. Recently, 2 serine protease inhibitors were approved as novel therapies for CHC due to genotype 1 infection. The addition of serine protease inhibitors to the backbone therapies of peginterferon-\u03b1 and ribavirin will emerge as the standard of care for the HCV genotype 1 infection, both in treatment-naive and treatment-experienced patients.",

Boceprevir is a linear peptidomimetic ketoamide serine protease inhibitor that was recently approved for the treatment of CHC, particularly for genotype 1. 194 It is available in oral formulation, and the time to peak concentration after oral administration is 2 hours. Food enhances its absorption. Boceprevir is metabolized primarily in the liver. It has an elimination half-life of 3 hours and is excreted mostly in the feces. 194 Boceprevir exerts anti-HCV properties by binding reversibly to the HCV nonstructural 3 protein, ultimately inhibiting viral replication. In a recently conducted phase 3 international randomized placebo-controlled trial that enrolled previously untreated black and nonblack adults with HCV genotype 1 infection (SPRINT-2 [serine protease inhibitor therapy 2] trial), the addition of boceprevir for 22 weeks or 44 weeks to standard therapy (peginterferon-\u03b1-2b and ribavirin) resulted in significantly higher SVR rates compared with standard therapy alone for the nonblack cohort (67% and 68% vs 40%, respectively) and the black cohort (42% and 53% vs 23%, respectively). 195 The relative increases in SVR rates for the nonblack cohort were 68% and 70%, respectively, compared with the standard therapy. 195 The HCV RESPOND-2 (Retreatment with HCV Serine Protease Inhibitor Boceprevir and PegIntron/Rebetol 2) trial evaluated boceprevir for the treatment of patients who had experienced a relapse or who had not achieved SVR to peginterferon-ribavirin treatment. 196 In this randomized open-label trial that enrolled 403 patients, the SVR rates were significantly higher for patients who received peginterferon-ribavirin plus boceprevir treatment for 32 weeks (59%) or 44 weeks (66%) compared with standard peginterferon-ribavirin treatment alone (21%). 196 In a mul-tivariable stepwise logistic regression analysis, the baseline factors associated with SVR were boceprevir use, previous relapse (compared with previous nonresponder), low viral load at baseline, and absence of cirrhosis. 196 Boceprevir (800 mg 3 times daily) was approved by the FDA as the first HCV protease inhibitor for the treatment of CHC, specifically for genotype 1; it should be combined with peginterferon and ribavirin. The most common adverse effects of boceprevir are flulike illness, fatigue, nausea, dysgeusia, and anemia. 194 The addition of boceprevir nearly doubled the rate of anemia compared with the use of standard peginterferon and ribavirin therapy, with many patients requiring the use of erythropoietin. 195 Telaprevir. Telaprevir is an orally available inhibitor specific to the HCV nonstructural 3/4A serine protease. 197 It inhibits HCV replication by binding reversibly to nonstructural 3 serine protease. After oral administration, telaprevir achieves peak plasma concentrations in 4 to 5 hours. It is metabolized primarily in the liver and it has an elimination half-life of 4 to 5 hours. Most of the drug is excreted in the feces.",

The currently available antiviral drugs target 3 main groups of viruses: herpes, hepatitis, and influenza viruses. The antiviral therapeutic armamentarium has evolved over the years and is rapidly expanding. Some of the \"old\" antiviral drugs retain their clinical utility for most infections, such as acyclovir for herpes simplex virus and ganciclovir for CMV. However, other of these \"old\" antiviral drugs (eg, amantadine and rimantadine for influenza virus infections) have lost their clinical utility because of the rapid and widespread development of resistance. This serves as a catalyst for the development of novel therapies and, more importantly, should urge the medical community to use these drugs optimally in the clinical setting. Indeed, increased resistance has been observed to the neuraminidase inhibitors for the treatment of influenza viruses and the nucleos(t)ide analogues for the treatment of CHB. As novel therapies develop (eg, the serine protease inhibitors for the treatment of CHC), care must be taken to optimize their use so that the clinical life span of these drugs is not abbreviated by the development of resistance.
