            "text": "T he early 21st century has witnessed an important shift in the way the national governments view the role and functions of their public health systems. One element of this shift has been an increasing recognition of the need to closely integrate public health, acute care and emergency management systems. In the US, this shift has lead to greater collaboration of public health agencies with military, emergency management and law enforcement agencies, 1 and paralleled what has been described as the US' first episode of biopreparedness during the early years of the Cold War. 2 In Canada, the federal response following severe acute respiratory syndrome has been centred around the creation of a national Public Health Agency and its integration into a broader national security plan. 3 Internationally, the World Health Organization has increased efforts at strengthening global public health preparedness and response. 4 This glossary focuses on one of the key concepts in this current shift-that is, preparedness. The core functions of national public health systems have historically included regulatory, surveillance, health protection, health promotion and disaster response activities. 5 Yet, the new global environment in which national public health systems operate has led to a higher profile for preparedness and the capacity of public health systems to be ready for or respond to various types of public health threats, including pandemic influenza, West Nile Virus or bioterrorism. Although fears have been expressed in the US that current preparedness policies will lead to the militarisation of public health and to a public health in reverse, 1 6 it is important to recognise that preparedness policies in other national contexts do not necessarily imply similar implications. In terms of its global significance, the focus on preparedness has led to increased governmental attention on the development and maintenance of public health systems, including workforce competencies, organisational-level capacities and systems-level operations to improve disaster response.",

A hazard is the source or potential source of danger and may be due to natural, social or technological phenomenon. 7 The all-hazards approach divides emergency management functions into the following four areas: mitigation, preparedness, response and recovery. 8 9 Capacity Capacity refers to the faculty or potential that an actor has for responding to an event that exceeds everyday resources. Actors may be groups, organisations, public health or emergency management systems, or national governments. For example, the concept of surge capacity is founded on the belief of adequacy and flexibility, from which resources can be reallocated in time of need, 10 including establishing regional networks to allow resources to be brought in from neighbouring communities and areas. 11 The creation of national stockpiles, or reserve supplies, of vaccines and antibiotics for use in a bioterrorist incident may also be seen as examples of capacity development.",

Natural disasters involve the interaction of an environmental extreme-for example, flooding, drought, a flu pandemic-with the human system. 7 18 Technological disasters are caused by human agency and the misuse, malfunction or breakage of technology resulting in the toxic or infectious contamination of the environment. 7 19 Technological disasters include incidents such as toxic spills, radiation leaks or inadvertent spread of highly pathogenic microorganisms. Social disasters consist of such events as riots or terrorist acts. 7 Disaster phases Contemporary research on disasters and emergency management has commonly followed the all-hazards model and divided a disaster or emergency into four phases: mitigation, preparedness, response and recovery. 7 The first two phases occur before a disaster or emergency event; the latter two during or after the disaster. Mitigation involves those activities and policies that are designed to prevent or lessen the effect of an emergency event and reduce the vulnerability of high-risk areas or groups-for example, preventing the construction of homes in flood plains or planning potential evacuation routes. 20 Preparedness is planning how to respond in an emergency and involves the development of system-level capacities for emergency response. 8 Response is the immediate reaction to an emergency in which primary responders seek to save and safeguard lives, minimise property damage and improve the potential for better recovery. 7 8 21 Recovery involves the restoration of services, systems and livelihoods following the disaster. The recovery phase can be divided into short-term and long-term phases. Short-term recovery corresponds to, what is sometimes considered, the relief phase in which local community systems are being returned to a minimum level of operations. 20 22 The long-term recovery phase corresponds to what can be considered the rehabilitation or reconstruction period. It can last for months to years as the disaster area begins to return to its previous condition. If disasters are sufficiently colossal, they may have irreversible permanent effects on populations and communities.",

As such, national public health systems become increasingly interdependent on the capacity of other national systems to respond to emerging and re-emerging diseases.",

One of the underlying principles of the ICS structure is the common terminology, which refers to the need for all responding agencies to use common names for all personnel and equipment resources, and clear unambiguous language during radio transmissions.",

Organisations in disaster situations have been classified into five types: (1) adapting organisations, which maintain their original structure and personnel but adapt their functions to the needs of the disaster; (2) expanding organisations, which maintain their original structure but increase their personnel to respond to the disaster situation; (3) extending organisations, which increase their range of services or activities they conduct to cover the additional needs created by the disaster; (4) emerging organisations, which are created out of the disaster situation; and (5) redundant organisations, which play no role during a disaster. 7 34 Public health Public health has been defined as the science and art of promoting health, preventing disease and improving the quality of life of a population through organised efforts of society. 5 The infrastructure of that system is seen as the foundation for an effective public health response to bioterrorism, emerging infections and other health threats. 35 Risk Risk is the probability or chance of an emergency or disaster incident to occur. Risk can be seen as a product of the hazard and the degree of vulnerability or susceptibility of people, buildings or other resources to that hazard. 7 System capacities To respond during emergencies or disasters, public health systems need to have seven core system capacities in place: (1) preparedness and response capabilities; (2) communication services; (3) information systems; (4) epidemiology/surveillance; (5) laboratory services; (6) policy and evaluation; and (7) workforce development. 18 Public health systems might achieve these capacities by either establishing those services themselves or through agreements with outside partners.",

This is achieved through the use of both formal and informal surveillance systems. 5 The threat of bioterrorism has led to the further development of real-time surveillance systems, which is achieved through integrated databases and the immediate or rapid recording of patients' presenting complaints. 37 Monitoring involves the use of enhanced surveillance techniques to investigate the effectiveness of response following an outbreak. 5 (5) Laboratory services are essential for the identification of organisms and environmental agents which affect community health. Since not all local public health agencies have laboratories, it is critical for local agencies to develop formal relationships with public and private laboratories in the community or outside the local jurisdiction, to assure that such services are available if needed. 38 (6) Policy and evaluation activities include the work of public health agencies to develop policy and public health laws.",
