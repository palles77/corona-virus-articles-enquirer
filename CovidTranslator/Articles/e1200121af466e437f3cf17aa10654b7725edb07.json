            "text": "Europe is now considered as the epicenter of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, France being among the most impacted country. In France, there is an increasing concern regarding the capacity of the healthcare system to sustain the outbreak, especially regarding intensive care units (ICU). The aim of this study was to estimate the dynamics of the epidemic in France, and to assess its impact on healthcare resources for each French metropolitan Region. We developed a deterministic, age-structured, Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Removed (SEIR) model based on catchment areas of each COVID-19 referral hospitals. We performed one month ahead predictions (up to April 14, 2020) for three different scenarios (R 0 = 1.5, R 0 = 2.25, R 0 = 3), where we estimated the daily number of COVID-19 cases, hospitalizations and deaths, the needs in ICU beds per Region and the reaching date of ICU capacity limits. At the national level, the total number of infected cases is expected to range from 22,872 in the best case (R 0 = 1.5) to 161,832 in the worst case (R 0 = 3), while the total number of deaths would vary from 1,021 to 11,032, respectively. At the regional level, all ICU capacities may be overrun in the worst scenario. Only seven Regions may lack ICU beds in the mild scenario (R 0 = 2.25) and only one in the best case. In the three scenarios, Corse may be the first Region to see its ICU capacities overrun. The two other Regions, whose capacity will be overrun shortly after are Grand-Est and Bourgogne-Franche-Comt\u00e9. Our analysis shows that, even in the best case scenario, the French healthcare system will very soon be overwhelmed. While drastic social distancing measures may temper our results, a massive reorganization leading to an expansion of French ICU capacities seems to be necessary to manage the coming wave of critically affected COVID-19 patients.",

In Europe, 38 countries reported cases, Italy accounting for the majority of them, with 3,089 cases out of 4,290 (72%), and 107 deaths out of 113 (94.7%). France was ranked second with 423 cases and 5 deaths (1.2%) 6 . On March 11, WHO declared a pandemic, as 106 countries reported 118,628 confirmed cases and 4,292 deaths (3.6%) 7 . In Europe, the number of countries affected increased to 47, Italy still accounting for the majority of cases. 8 Figure 1 shows the number of cases in metropolitan France from January 22 to March 14 (source Sant\u00e9 Publique France). As of March 10, midnight, 2,030 cases were confirmed, leading to 44 deaths (2.2%) 8 . The two Regions the most impacted were Grand Est and Ile-de-France, with 489, and 468 cases, respectively. People aged over 75 years accounted for 19% of the cases but around 75% of the deaths 8 . As of March 10, 102 cases had been hospitalized into Intensive Care Units (ICU), 38% of them aged 65 years or less. The doubling time is approximately 72h, as the number of cases increased from 1,126 to 2,269 between March 8 and March 11, and from 2,269 to 4,469 between March 11 and March 14. It must be noted that it is likely that the number of confirmed cases is underestimating the true number of cases as all cases are not necessarily identified due to logistical issues in some Regions 8 . SARS-CoV-2 is a zoonotic virus, and bats are believed to be its reservoir. However, human-to-human transmission has been largely reported 9 . Transmission occurs mostly via droplets and fomites during close unprotected contact. Information about the main transmission parameters is still relatively scarce, and can vary according to the settings, the data, and the methods used.",

We considered an incubation period of 5 days and a contagious period of 11 days 19 . We assumed an average length of stay in hospitals and in ICU wards of 15 days for all patients, of all ages. We estimated the age-dependent susceptibility of the population based on the age distribution of infected cases reported by Wu and colleagues in China 11 .

They concluded that the health care system could not sustain an uncontrolled outbreak, and that strong containment measures were needed. Remuzzi and Remuzzi fitted exponential models and predicted that the Italian health care system could be at maximum capacity by March 14 29 .

The model was run for each catchment area independently, as we did not model population movements between catchment areas. Although it is theoretically feasible, it seems unnecessary in this context. Infected cases are already present in most locations, meaning transmission is likely to be mainly driven locally, not by inter-areas transfers. Moreover, control measures are already implemented to limit population movements. We are only presenting forecasts at one month, as long term predictions may be unreliable due to the few data available to calibrate the model concerning the epidemic in France. The critical factor that remains unknown to this date is the potential impact of seasonality on the transmission dynamic of COVID-19. Danon and colleagues modeled seasonal transmission by introducing a time-varying transmission rate. 21 They estimated that a 50% reduction in transmission during summer months would result in a smaller epidemic before the summer, followed by a resurgence in cases in the following winter. However, whether SARS-CoV-2 transmission will be affected by seasonal variations remains unclear. Although many infectious diseases have seasonal patterns, like influenza or other coronaviruses, newly introduced viruses can behave differently.

However, the potential discrepancies are likely to be modest and should not impact the interpretation of the results. More importantly, we assumed that ICU capacities could entirely be dedicated to COVID-19 critical patients. In France, ICU wards tend to have more than 80% occupancy rate (personal communication with clinicians), hence our analysis already assumes an important patient care reorganization, almost doubling current capacities. Also, we assumed a fixed length of stay of 15 days in ICU as observed in foreign countries. This value could vary across patients and locations, and could slightly bias the estimation of ICU needs in our study. To overcome this bias, we plan to use hospitalization data provided by regional health agencies (ARS), which may help to have better predictions of beds use. We restricted our model to metropolitan France, as overseas Regions are at a lower epidemic stage at the moment, and the transmission dynamics are likely to differ from metropolitan France. Finally, it must be noted that spatial division of the French territory used in this model does not exactly reflect administrative boundaries of the French Regions, as it was based on the merge of each Voronoi polygons representing the catchment areas of referral centers. However, division by catchment areas might help to better estimate the pressure on the referral centers, as people are more likely to be referred to hospitals based on geographical distance rather than administrative boundaries.",
