Existing direct-acting antiviral (DAA) drugs cannot be applied immediately to new viruses because of virus-specificity, and the development of new DAA drugs from the beginning is not timely for outbreaks. Thus, host-targeting antiviral (HTA) drugs have many advantages to fight against a broad spectrum of viruses, by blocking the viral replication and overcoming the potential viral mutagenesis simultaneously. Herein, we identified two potent inhibitors of DHODH, S312 and S416, with favorable drug-like and pharmacokinetic profiles, which all showed broad-spectrum antiviral effects against various RNA viruses, including influenza A virus (H1N1, H3N2, H9N2), Zika virus, Ebola virus, and particularly against the recent novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2.",

Notably, S416 is reported to be the most potent inhibitor with an EC50 of 17nM and SI value >5882 in SARS-CoV-2-infected cells so far. This work demonstrates that both our self-designed candidates and old drugs (Leflunomide/Teriflunomide) with dual actions of antiviral and immuno-repression may have clinical potentials not only to influenza but also to",

By using these two potent inhibitors, we could fully evaluate DHODH as a valuable host target both in infected cells and in vivo in infected animals. We identified that targeting DHODH offers broad-spectrum antiviral efficacies against various RNA viruses, including the DAA-resistant influenza virus and the newly emerged coronavirus SARS-CoV-2. Especially, our potent DHODHi can protect 100% mice from lethal influenza challenge, which is as good as the DAA drugs, and is even effective in the late phase of infection when DAA drug is no longer responding.",

A labor stain of A/WSN/33(H1N1, WSN) with 20 TCID50 was applied to infect MDCK cells, and serial dilutions of drugs (DMSO as controls) were added at the same time when cells were infected. Drug efficacies were evaluated by quantification of cell viability in both infected and non-infected cells, and the halfmaximal effective concentration (EC50) and the half-cytotoxic concentration (CC50) of the indicated drug were obtained accordingly. The selectivity index (SI) was calculated by CC50/EC50. As shown in Fig. 1D , the antiviral effect of Leflunomide is hardly detectable at the cell culture level (EC50>25 \u03bc M). However, Teriflunomide, the active metabolite of Leflunomide, exhibited a clear antiviral effect against the WSN virus (EC50=29.33\u03bcM, CC50=178.50\u03bcM\uff0cSI=6.08). As compared to Teriflunomide, the potent DHODHi S312 is ~12-fold stronger (EC50=2.36\u03bcM) and S416 is ~480-fold stronger (EC50=0.061\u03bcM) than Teriflunomide in their antiviral efficacies. We also tested different influenza A virus subtypes of H3N2 and H9N2. The antiviral efficacies of DHODHi followed the same pattern as they were against H1N1, which is S416>S312>Teriflunomide>Leflunomide in viral inhibitory efficacies (summarized in Table 1 ). The drug effective curve of S416 to H3N2 (EC50=0.013\u03bcM) and H9N2 (EC50=0.020\u03bcM) is shown in Fig. 1E and 1F . When we compared the drug efficacy by virus plaque assay, the results in Fig. 1G showed that the positive control DAA drug Oseltamivir (Osel) could reduce the plaque size to needlepoint size. However, the virus plaque in equivalent S312-treatment was not observable at all indicating that S312 is more efficient in inhibiting virus replication than Osel.",

Teriflunomide had a solid antiviral efficacy of EC50=26.06uM (at MOI=0.05, ~2.4-fold stronger than Favipiravir [EC50=61.88\u03bcM] 29 ) (Fig. 2C upper right) , whereas its pro-drug Leflunomide showed less inhibition of EC50=63.56uM (data not shown). We therefore further did immuno-florescent assay to visualize the drug efficacy. To determine more carefully the efficacy of Teriflunomide, which can be transferred to clinical treatment of SARS-CoV-2 immediately as an approved drug, a bit low MOI of 0.03 (Fig. 2C upper left) were applied. In this condition, the EC50 of Teriflunomide could reach 6\u03bcM with SI>33, indicating that Teriflunomide with effective EC50 and SI values have all the potentials to treat SARS-CoV-2-induced COVID-19 disease as an 'old drug in new use' option.",

To further validate virus genome replication is the major target of DHODHi, we used the influenza-A-virus mini-replicon system to quantify viral genome replication. Brequinar, another potent inhibitor of DHODH was included as a positive control 30 , whereas, Osel targeting influenza NA protein served as a negative control. The results in Fig.4E showed no inhibition on viral genome replication in the Osel-treated group, but there were obvious inhibitions on viral genome replication in both S312-and S416-treated groups as well as Brequinar-treated group in dosedependent manners. Almost 90% of viral genome replication was suppressed by 10IC50 of S312 (24\u03bcM) and S416 (0.6\u03bcM). As DHODH catalyzes oxidation of dihydroorotate (DHO) to produce orotic acid (ORO) and finally forms UTP and CTP\uff0c we add four nucleotides (adenine nucleotide(A), guanine nucleotide(G), uracil nucleotide(U), and cytosine nucleotide(C)), DHO, ORO respectively to mini-replicon system to identify the target of S312 and S416.

Moreover, supplement of DHODH substrate DHO cannot rescue viral genome replication (Fig. 4G) , but a supplement of DHODH product ORO can gradually reverse the inhibition effects of S312 and S416 (Fig. 4H) .

And till now, there is no approved drug to treat advanced influenza disease at the late phase specifically. We suppose that S312 could be effective in the middle or late phase of disease because it targets a host pro-viral factor of DHODH not affected by viral replication cycle. To test this, we compared the therapeutic windows of S312 and Osel in early (D3-D7), middle & late (D5-D9)\uff0csevere late (D7-D11 or D6-D14) phases (workflow shown in Fig. 5A ). When drugs were given in the early phase, both Oseltreatment and 'Osel+S312'-combination-treatment conferred 100% protection (Fig.   5B ). When drugs were given at the middle & late phase (Fig. 5C) , single Osel-treatment wholly lost its antiviral effect with no surviving. However, S312-treatment could provide 50% protection, and drug combination reached to 100% protection. When drugs were given at severe late phase of disease that mice were starting dying (Fig. 5D) , neither single treatment of Osel nor S312 can rescue the mice from death but combined treatment still conferred to 25% survival. To really show the advantage of S312 in treating severe disease, we additionally treated the mice a bit early before dying around 80% of initial weights (D6-D14) with a more optimal dose of S312 (5mg/kg). The data in Fig. 5E showed that S312 rescued 50% of mice from severe body-weight losses, and combined treatment coffered additional 25% survival. These results once again highlight that S312 has remarkable advantages over Osel to treat severe diseases at the late phase, and its therapeutic effectiveness could even be improved when S312 was combined with DAA drug.",

It catalyzes the dehydrogenation of dihydroorotate (DHO) to orotic acid (ORO) to finally generate Uridine (U) and Cytosine (C) to supply nucleotide resources in a cell. Under normal conditions, nucleotides are supplied via both de novo biosynthesis and salvage pathways, the latter of which is a way of recycling pre-existing nucleotides from food or other nutrition. However, in virus-infected cells, a large intracellular nucleotide pool is demanded by rapid viral replication. It is therefore reasonable that de novo nucleotides biosynthesis rather than salvage pathway is more critical for virus replication. Our data indeed show that virus replication is largely restricted when the DHODH gene was knocked off even with a complete culture medium. By contrast, cell growth was not affected by lacking DHODH at all, indicating that de novo nucleotides biosynthesis is not indispensable in normal cell growth without infection at least for days.

Strikingly, S312 showed active effects in vivo in lethal dose infection of influenza A viruses not only when used from the beginning of infection but also in the late phase when DAA drug is not responding anymore. Another surprise is the high SI value of S416 to against Zika (SI=1087.62), Ebola (SI=4746.11), and the current SARS-CoV-2 (SI>5882). These data interpreted that S416 is highly promising to develop further as it should be to S312. The extremely high SI of S416 may be due to its high binding affinity and favorable occupation of the ubiquinone-binding site of DHODH with faster-associating characteristics (kon = 1.76\u00d710 6 M -1 s -1 ) and slower dissociating binding characteristic (koff=2.97\u00d710 -3 s -1 ), which will reduce the possibility of off-target in vivo.",

We believe that a similar immune-regulating role of DHODHi will exist in COVID-19 patients. Thus, by targeting DHODH, the single key enzyme in viral genome replication and immuneregulation, a dual-action of DHODH can be realized in fighting against a broad spectrum of viruses and the corresponding pathogenic-inflammation in severe infections.

After 12 h.p.i., cells were treated with 2-fold serial dilutions of Oseltamivir, S312, S416, and Brequinar respectively. The luciferase activities were measured 24 h of post-treatment. (F) Effects of nucleotides addition on the antiviral efficacies of S312 and S416. The 10-fold IC50 of S312 (24 \u03bcM) or S416 (0.6 \u03bcM) and 50\u03bcM four nucleotides (Adenosine, Uridine, Cytidine, Guanosine) were added at the same time on 293T cells. After 24 h of treatment, the luciferase activities were measured. (G and H) Effects of addition of dihydroorotate (DHO) or Orotic acid (ORO) on the antiviral efficacies of S312 and S416. The luciferase activities were detected as above after treating with indicated concentrations of DHO or ORO. All results are presented as a mean of three replicates \u00b1 SD. Statistical analysis, two-way ANOVA for B, C, and D. One-way ANOVA for E, F, G and H. NS, p >0.05; *, p <0.05; **, p <0.01; ***, p <0.001. D7-11 (D) . Another groups of S312 (5mg/kg) or S312+Oseltamivir (5mg/kg+20mg/kg) were given i.p. once per day from D6 to D13 in E. The green bars indicate the period of drug administration. The body weight and survival were monitored until 14 days post-infection or when the bodyweight reduced to 75%, respectively (n =4-5 mice per group). The dotted line indicates endpoint for mortality (75% of initial weight). The body weights are present as the mean percentage of the initial weight \u00b1SD of 4-5 mice per group and survival curve were shown.",
