Influenza pneumonia (IP) brings huge burden to healthcare system due to its high morbidity and mortality rate. In United States, influenza accounted for more than 29 million infections and 16,000 deaths in 2019 (1) . It was reported that oral oseltamivir accelerates symptom alleviation and reduces risks of lower respiratory tract complications in influenza (2) . Therefore, early diagnosis and separation of IP patients from NCP patients will improve prognosis and optimize the allocation of medical resources. However, apart from overlapping symptoms and laboratory abnormalities, IP and NCP manifest similar chest CT findings (3), making it difficult to differentiate these two kinds of viral pneumonia.",

Trinary scheme was better correlated with specialists in both categories (Table E9 ). More details were in the Result E7. Table 1 summarized the CT devices on which both schemes and ten radiologists made wrong classification on cases from the external validation set. We first observed that the IP cases are from 10 CT devices, despite the fact that they were from the same center. The majority of the tested IP cases have been correctly classified by both schemes. The only exception was uCT 528, a new CT device. On uCT 528, eight patients were examined, seven of them were IP from Center 1, from which six and five cases were misclassified by Plain and Trinary scheme respectively. Yet more than three patients were also misdiagnosed by the specialists. The main manifestations were peripheral single or multiple ground grass opacities with or without patchy consolidation in the lower lobe or bilateral distribution, which mimic the findings of NCP, leading to the misclassification ( Figure E8 ). Another one was from Center 8 which was an NCP but misdiagnosed by all specialists ( Figure 4A ). The Trinary scheme performs better than the Plain scheme in this situation. Table 1 , the Plain scheme misclassified 16 cases and the Trinary scheme reduced it to 10. The error rates of both schemes for the two CT devices (SOMATOM Definition Flash and LightSpeed VCT) from Center 6 were exceptionally high compared to all other CT devices. As both of them only contributed IP training cases for the model, the classification model may learn the device specific features, and wrongly treated these features as specific to IP during training. During testing, the schemes would therefore tend to wrongly classify NCP.",

The similarities in clinical symptoms between NCP and IP, along with shortage and high false negative rate of nucleic acid detection kits, make the differential diagnosis difficult (24) (25) (26) , prompting clinicians to investigate new diagnostic methods. Chest CT had high sensitivity in diagnosing NCP at early stage, giving it an advantage over nucleic acid detection in time of crisis. This is the reason why Hubei Provincial Government adopted characteristic chest CT finding as an important criterion for diagnosis of NCP at the peak of outbreak. However, the similar chest CT manifestations of NCP and IP will inevitably lead to inaccurate diagnosis even for experienced physicians, and increase the risk of over-diagnosis and cross infection (3, 8) . The main challenge to employ CT as a predominant diagnostic tool is to improve the accuracy and speed in identifying specific lesions on chest CT images.",

By doing so, it would lead to high cost on the random region inputs, forcing the model to extract more lesion specific features. Although it is impossible to exclude all device specific features, we observed a visible improvement in performance (AUC from 0.85 to 0.89) on patient level classification. Such a performance is comparable with the judgement of experienced specialists. 13 (22.8%) NCP patients presenting uncommon CT findings, such as a small ground-glass opacity (GGO) in the central part were correctly classified by our Trinary scheme, .

We first demonstrated that the AI model performed well using training and test data from four machines of three centers with an AUC of 0.99. Similar performance of the model with specialists on independent verification data from fifteen machines of eight centers further suggests good clinical applicability. Although our AI system achieved good performance, it misclassified a small number of NCP and IP patients, which may be caused by poor spatial resolution of some of images. In this study, we used 5 mm instead of 1 mm layer thickness in CT reconstruction, which would limit our capability to detect small lesions. Nevertheless, 5 mm layer thickness is a standard parameter in most hospitals and is sufficient to identify major imaging differences between NCP and IP as demonstrated by our study.

Our deep learning model potentially provides an accurate early diagnostic tool for NCP, especially when nucleic acid test kits are short of supply, which is a common problem during outbreaks. This could help reduce the missed diagnosis rate and diagnosis time, ensure prompt patient isolation and early treatment, improve prognosis and largely prevent transmission. The high efficiency of our model to differentiate NCP and IP could be very beneficial to reduce misdiagnosis rate and optimize the allocation of medical resources, particularly in areas with high prevalence of both NCP and IP.",

They were misdiagnosed by five specialists (Figure 4). The results indicated both of the schemes surpassed the discrimination capability for residents for NCP and IP and achieved specialist level. More details were shown in the Result E7. As expected, both the Plain and the Trinary scheme performed better on cases from centers if the training data contained cases from same centers.

Similar performance (misclassified cases, 8 vs 7) was found for both schemes on the external validation set, which was generally comparable to that of the specialist group but outperformed the resident group. Table below shows NCP patients of three datasets were from Center 1~8 with 17 CT devices. There were 4, 6, 15 devices applied and 35, 15, 57 cases on the training, test and external validation sets. Similarto (a), the performance of both schemes bore comparison to the specialist group and outperformed the resident group. However, the Trinary scheme performed better than the Plain scheme with less misclassified cases (16 vs 10). It is noteworthy that there were total 50 NCP cases on the training and test sets, for one case was randomly selected on the validation set. On the contrary, IP cases on the validation set were all randomly selected from the training set. Therefore, a total of 156 IP cases were in the training and test sets. * means that IP patients from this type of device appear in the training set. IP=influenza pneumonia.
