BALB/c mice were used as an animal model to test the Arbidol activity in vivo. Orally administered Arbidol at 50 mg/kg body weight/day (once a day) significantly reduced mean virus yields in the lungs and heart as well as mortality after infection for 6 days. Our results demonstrate that in vitro and in vivo infection with CVB 5 can be effectively treated by Arbidol.",

CVB had been implicated in childhood myocarditis by the end of the 1950s. Since then, six CVB serotypes (CVB1-6) have been shown to cause not only myocarditis but also a wide variety of human diseases, including common colds, cardiomyopathy, diabetes, neurological disorders, and inflammation [1] [2] [3] [4] . Numerous outbreaks of CVB infections have been noted at the community level, but only Coxsackie virus B 5 (CVB 5 ) is known to have caused widespread nationwide epidemics in the United States, particularly in 1961, 1972, and 1983 [5] . Moreover, CVB 5 is associated with several human diseases, including encephalitis and myocarditis in immunocompromised children and CNS disease in older adults.",

A great number of picornavirus replication inhibitors have been described in vitro, but few of them have shown effectiveness in vivo [9] , and none has been approved for clinical use. Gancyclovir and cidofovir have been studied in myocarditis caused by cytomegalovirus in mice [10] , but there is no evidence that it also works for enterovirus-induced myocarditis.

Its chemical name is ethyl-6-bromo-4-[(dimethylamino)-methyl]-5-hydroxy-1-methyl-2-[(phenylthio) methyl] -indole-3-carboxylate hydrochloride monohydrate. Arbidol was first found to have wide-spectrum antiviral activity against human influenza virus. It was shown to inhibit the reproduction of rimantadine-resistant human influenza virus A, avian viruses H5N1 and H9N2, and influenza viruses B and C [14] . In many studies, Arbidol also exhibited broad and potent antiviral activity against a number of viruses including respiratory syncytial virus [15] , adenovirus [16] , parainfluenza virus type 5, rhinovirus type 14, avian coronavirus, infectious bronchitis virus and Marek disease virus [17] , hepatitis B virus [18] , and hepatitis C virus [19] . In our previous study, Arbidol showed broad-spectrum antiviral activity against a number of respiratory viruses, including FLU-A, RSV, HRV 14, and CVB 3 in vitro [20] . The extensive list of Arbidolsensitive viruses includes RNA and DNA viruses, enveloped and non-enveloped viruses, and pH-dependent and -independent viruses, emphasizing a broad spectrum of Arbidol antiviral activity. At the same time, the wide spectrum of Arbidol's activity suggests that Arbidol targets common critical step(s) in virus-cell interaction. In this study, we systematically investigated the antiviral activity of Arbidol against CVB 5 in vitro and in vivo.",

After removal of the growth medium, serial twofold dilutions of the compound in 200 ll test medium were added. At each dilution, four wells were infected with 100 TCID 50 /0.1 ml of virus, while four wells were left uninfected for toxicity determination. The same dose of Arbidol was added to the plate daily, since its halflife in cultured cells is about 18 h [23] . The plates were incubated at 37\u00b0C, and the development of cytopathic effect (CPE) was monitored daily by light microscopy until the virus-infected, untreated cells showed CPE up to 80%. At this time point, the culture medium was removed and 25 ll of the MTT solution (5 mg/ml in phosphatebuffered saline, PBS) was added to each well. The plate was further incubated for 4 h to allow MTT formazan formation. After removal of the supernatant, 50 ll of DMSO was added for solubilization of formazan crystals, which were homogenized on a microplate shaker for 15 min. The optical densities (ODs) were then read using a microplate spectrophotometer at double wavelengths of 540 and 690 nm. Results were expressed as a percentage of OD value of treated cell cultures with respect to untreated ones. All data were analyzed with SPSS 11.5, and the 50% cytotoxic (CC 50 ) and 50% inhibitory (IC 50 ) concentrations of the agent were determined. Thus, the therapeutic index (TI) for the compound was also determined from CC 50 /IC 50 .

            "text": "In this study, we tested the antiviral activity of Arbidol against CVB 5 , both in vitro and in vivo. Like other enteroviruses, CVB is a small RNA virus that replicates at 37\u00b0C, lacks a lipid envelope, and is stable at acid pH. When primarily cultured HEp-2 cells infected with CVB 3 were treated with Arbidol by different methods, arbidol was found to present potent antiviral activity against CVB 5 when added before and after infection. In a virucidal assay, Arbidol exhibited a strong effect against CVB 5 , and inhibited the CPE of CVB 5 on HEp-2 cells with a TI of 27.56, which is higher than other treatments. Those data suggested that Arbidol had a strong antiviral effect against CVB 5 during the adsorption step. We also cocultured HEp-2 cells with different doses of Arbidol after infection to study whether it still had an antiviral effect after virus entry into the host cell. The MTT assay showed that Arbidol had inhibitory activity against CVB 5 , with an IC 50 of 6.62 lg/ml and a TI of 12.45 (see Table 1 ). Semiquantitative RT-PCR data suggested that Arbidol prevented the synthesis of CVB 5 RNA in a dose-dependent manner. In short, our data demonstrate that Arbidol can induce durable antiviral activity in host cells, not only blocking the adsorption of viral particles onto cells but also inhibiting the late stage of the viral replication cycle.",

Mice infected with CVB 5 had some symptoms of circulatory failure such as cyanosis and lack of blood perfusion in the tail and auricle, and there was evidence of virus replication in the heart and lungs. Pathological findings were consistent with the results from virus isolation, and all viral control mice died by day 18 after infection. Thus, CVB 5 infection in BALB/c mice is a suitable in vivo model to study in vivo antiviral activity.",
