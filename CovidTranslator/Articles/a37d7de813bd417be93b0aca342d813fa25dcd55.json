            "text": "In the common cold, viruses induce a profound inflammatory response on the airway mucosa. This immune reaction leads to release of different inflammatory substances that are thought to play a major role in generating symptoms of the disease. It has been demonstrated that up to 80% of patients with the common cold have inflammation of the paranasal sinuses, as shown by computed tomography. 1 Recently, it has been shown that intranasally administered steroids have a beneficial effect as an adjunct therapy in acute sinusitis. 2 The optimal therapy for the common cold may therefore be to attack both arms of the infection, virus replication and inflammatory response, as has been suggested for viral bronchiolitis and pneumonia. 3 Saliva is essential for maintenance of the ecologic balance in the oral cavity 4, 5 and is considered an essential part of the mucosal host defense system. One of the major functions of this system is to inhibit the adherence of pathogenic bacteria to oral tissues by mechanical, immunologic, and nonimmunologic means. 6 In addition, the human mouth is an important route for viral transmission. Saliva, or salivary components, can neutralize some viruses such as herpes simplex virus type 1, 7,8 human immunodeficiency virus type 1, 9, 10 respiratory syncytial virus, 8 and echovirus 11. 8 Fluticasone propionate is a new, topically active glucocorticosteroid with high topical activity and low bioavailability. We hypothesized that this drug would relieve the symptoms in virus-induced rhinitis. However, cough was the only symptom in which we could find a beneficial effect. 11 To extend these findings, this study analyzed salivary flow rate and selected major host antimicrobial components present in whole saliva in patients with the common cold. This was considered important because the human mouth is one of the main routes of entry for viruses and bacteria into the human body.",

The analysis of these data, based on the output rates, does not indicate any systemic effect of either fluticasone propionate or the common cold on the non-immune defense factors. The analysis of the relative amounts of secreted proteins showed that immunoglobulins, especially IgA, contribute to a higher degree than other proteins to the total protein content of whole saliva in a patient with the common cold. In both study groups, the ingredients of the medication, such as benzalkone hydrochloride, may have had an effect that could not be controlled in this study.",

The increase was not evident after 7 days of the common cold, and no differences between the FT and CC groups could be noticed. Therefore, the salivary IgA response was probably induced by the viruses, and the treatment of the common cold with fluticasone propionate did not have any negative influence on this defense factor. Although the common cold was followed by a significantly enhanced mucosal IgA response, it is not clear whether this effect is clinically important. IgA is one of the major factors eliminating (eg, by aggregation) bacteria and viruses from mucosal surfaces, 23, 24 and this effect is therefore likely to be important in vivo. 4, 5 However, further studies of the actual microbial changes are needed to elucidate the real biologic significance of our observations.",
