In this study, bulk tank milk from 36 herds of dairy cattle in eastern China was submitted to serological investigations, 77.8% of herds was BVDV antibody positive. Individual animal status in two herds was further investigated collecting blood samples, the positive ratio was 49.74% and 24.64%, and the average positive ratio of calves, heifers, and lactating cows was 15.94%, 40.16%, and 41.7%, respectively. Moreover, clinical survey was carried out among 8170 dairy cattle from 36 herds, for diarrhea syndrome, respiratory problems and reproductive failure, and pathogens of all clinical cattle were further investigated. The results showed that BVDV was one of the main pathogen, which infected animals combining with various other viruses. Then, nine BVDV strains were isolated; phylogenetic analysis showed that BVDV subtypes currently circulating in eastern China were BVDV 1a and BVDV 1c. In addition, out of 377 cows tested, the 1.86% detected positive to the BVDV antigen. This study provided the foundation of further study on vaccination and control strategies of BVDV in eastern China.",

            "text": "Bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV) is a major pathogen causing bovine viral diarrhea (BVD) among cattle and other ruminants, leading to significant economic loss throughout the world (Brodersen 2014) . BVDV is an enveloped, positive strand RNA virus, which belongs to the genus Pestivirus of the family Flaviviridae. Two BVDV biotypes are distinguished: cytopathogenic (CP) and noncytopathogenic (NCP) viruses, according to their respective effects on cell culture (Ammari et al. 2010) . NCP is the most common naturally occurring biotype, but cytopathogenic effects on cultured cells do not relate to virulence in vivo (Peterhans et al. 2010) . The occurrence of CP BVDV in cattle persistently infected with NCP BVDV is directly correlated with induction of lethal mucosal disease (Hilbe et al. 2013; Kuwabara et al. 2007; Walz et al. 2010 ). In addition, BVDV is genetically divided into three types: type 1 (BVDV-1), type 2 (BVDV-2), HoBilike viruses (BVDV-3), or Batypical pestiviruses^, and it is noted that only BVDV-1 and BVDV-2 are recognized species, and Hobi-like is a tentative species (Bauermann et al. 2013; Giammarioli et al. 2015b; Stahl et al. 2010) . Recently, the virus isolates have been further grouped into different subgenotypes by phylogenetic analysis (Abe et al. 2016; Gomez-Romero et al. 2017; Otonel et al. 2014; Yesilbag et al. 2017; Yilmaz et al. 2012) . So far, 21 subgenotypes (BVDV-1a to BVDV-1u) and BVDV-2 subtypes (2a-2d) have been reported worldwide (Deng et al. 2015; Giammarioli et al. 2015a; Xue et al. 2010; Yesilbag et al. 2014) .",

In Ethiopia, seroreaction to BVDV antigens was detected in 32.6% of the 1379 cattle and 69.8% of the 149 herds sampled (Aragaw et al. 2018) . Within herd of Tamil Nadu, BVDV seroprevalence was 12-65% (Kumar et al. 2018) . In suburb of Mashhad-Iran, the seroprevalence of BVDV infection in industrial dairy cattle herds was 72.25% (Talebkhan Garoussi et al. 2009 ). In Ireland, BVDV infection was detected in 98.7% of nonvaccinated herds (Cowley et al. 2012 ). In addition, BVDV-1b and BVDV-1e were the most prevalent subtypes circulating in Italy, whereas the BVDV-1a and BVDV-2a subtypes were predominant and widespread in Korea (Bazzucchi et al. 2017; Han et al. 2018) . The prevalence of persistently infected cattle from selected, nonrandom sample in six large South African feedlots was 2.9% (Meiring et al. 2011) , while prevalence of PI calves in Japan in a dairy herd was estimated about 7.0%, which was very high ratio compared to that in previous reports (Helal et al. 2012) . In China, the pooled BVDV prevalence in dairy cattle in China was up to 53.0% according to the data obtained from systematic review and meta-analysis (Ran et al. 2018) . Furthermore, the BVDV subtypes currently circulating in China were various (1a, 1b, 1c, 1d, 1m, 1o, 1p, and 1q) (Xue et al. 2010) . However, previous studies are mainly conducted in northern and western China; it is less known about prevalence of BVDV and PI animal status among dairy cattle in eastern China recently.",

The culture plates were incubated at 37\u00b0C, with 5% CO 2 for 2 h. After centrifugation, the supernatants were discarded, and plates were rinsed twice with PBS (pH 7.2, 0.01 mol/L), and 1 mL DMEM (HyClone, USA) with 2% horse serum (Gibco, USA) was added. The infected MDBK cells were checked daily and appearance of cytopathic effects (CPE) was observed and recorded.

Systematic epidemiologic investigation and genetic typing of BVDV in China will be useful for studies on vaccine and control strategies. Fig. 1 The seroprevalence of BVDV in individual animals. A total of 402 blood samples were collected from herd #4 and herd #19 including calves, heifers, and lactating cows, and antibody against BVDV was detected by BVD/MD P80-ELISA test kit. The seroprevalence of BVDV in two herds was analyzed (a), and rate of calves, heifers, and lactating cows was statistically analyzed, respectively (b) In this study, bulk milk from 36 dairy cattle herds, which have no BVDV vaccination history and widely distributed in eastern China, was used to investigate epidemic of BVDV, as detection of BVDV antibody of bulk milk was a fast and easy method for the investigation of BVDV dairy cattle herds (Hanon et al. 2017; Lanyon et al. 2014a, b ; Velasova et al. (Table 1) . Moreover, the result of bulk milk will be negative according to Ab-ELISA manufacture's test procedure since prevalence of positive animals in one herd is less than 10%, so prevalence of BVDV positive herds should be more than 77.78%; this implied that BVDV may widely spread in eastern China.

            "text": "It is noteworthy that, although the positive rate is high, the majority of BVDV positive cases do not manifest clinically apparent symptoms. In this study, based on statistical analysis of clinical cases among 8170 individuals from 36 dairy cattle herds, diarrhea syndrome took the largest proportion, and reproductive failure was infrequent (Fig. 2a) . The pathogens showed that BVDV was the main pathogen, which infected dairy cattle combined with other viruses (Fig. 2b) . The BVDV can induce immunosuppression, so BVDV infecting animals easily facilitate secondary infections by other pathogens Alkheraif et al. 2017; Darweesh et al. 2018) . Virus isolation in this study was performed because it is commonly considered to be the gold standard for diagnosis of BVDV (Lanyon et al. 2014a, b) , and eight NCP and BVDV-1 strains as well as one CP and BVDV-2 strain were successfully isolated. Reportedly, the worst part of BVD disease in cattle is the persistence of infection caused by NCP biotype of BVDV, and our results further confirmed that most of BVDV field isolates from China were NCP. Moreover, it was showed that BVDV-1a, BVDV-1c, as well as BVDV-2 were circulating in eastern China based on the sequence of highly conserved 5\u2032-UTR (Fig. 4) . This study was potentially provided with additional background on the genetic heterogeneity that all BVDV isolates from cattle in China between 2005 and 2008 were of the BVDV type 1 genotypes (Xue et al. 2010 ). In addition, BVDV-2 genotype does exist in dairy herd although BVDV-1 was still main genotype in eastern China.",

Classically, the prevalence of PI animals ranges between 0.5% and 2% (Stott et al. 2012) . In this study, we found that the ratio of PI animals was 1.86% among 377 cows, which indicates that the herds containing PI animals are at higher risk of BVDV infection in eastern China. Therefore, as the identification of potential source of contamination in dairy cattle herds has been of increasing concern, epidemiological studies and eradication or control programs may be considered essential for removal of persistently infected cattle in some regions.",
