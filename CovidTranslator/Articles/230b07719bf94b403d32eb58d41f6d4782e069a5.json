Many contemporary virologists do not know, however, that the first animal virus described was a picornavirus, the etiological agent of the dreaded foot-and-mouth disease in cloven-footed animals. The discovery of footand-mouth disease virus (FMDV) by E Loeffier and P. Frosch in 1898 (Loeffier and Frosch, 1898) occurred at the same time as M.W. Beijerinck described the amazing \"contagium vivum fluidum\" in 1898. This liquid was a filtered leaf extract derived from tobacco plants suffering from tobacco mosaic disease. Free of bacteria, it was yet able to transmit the disease to uninfected plants. Already in 1892, I. Ivanovski had made a similar observation with tobacco mosaic virus but apparently he was unable to fully convince his peers of the significance of his discovery (Waterson and Wilkinsen, 1978) .",

            "text": "Research on viruses, now formally in its hundred-and-first year, has yielded an immense harvest Of biochemical and biological information. The studies were driven not only by an urgent need to understand, and possibly prevent, viral disease; they were also fueled by a strong curiosity about the minute biologicals called viruses, which we can view as chemicals, on the one hand and as \"living\" entities on the other. Poliovirus is an exquisite example of a chemical with a known empirical formula (Molla et al., 1991) that can be crystallized (Schaffer and Schwerdt, 1955) yet causes a devastating disease in humans. Poliovirus was discovered 90 years ago by Landsteiner and Popper (1909) to be the causative agent of poliomyelitis. The current knowledge of its chemical and three-dimensional structure and of its life cycle and pathogenesis is second to none. Indeed, the intense research efforts on poliovirus over a period of nine decades will lead to its demise in the near future: global eradication of poliovirus is considered possible by the year 2000.",

A serotype is defined by the virus's ability to elicit a set of neutralizing antibodies (\"antiserum\") in a host animal; this set of neutralizing antibodies will generally not neutralize any other virus, regardless of the origin of the antiserum. Neutralizing antibodies, in turn, are elicited by structures specific for a virus's capsid, and they have been referred to as neutralization antigenic determinants (or sites). The poliovirion carries at its surface four distinct neutralization antigenic determinants Minor, 1990) . However, poliovirus expresses only three unique sets of these four determinants; hence poliovirus occurs in three serotypes. Hepatitis A virus, on the other hand, expresses only one set of neutralization antigenic determinants; hence, it occurs in only one serotype. In contrast, human rhinoviruses (HRV) can express more than 100 unique sets of four antigenic determinants. Rhinoviruses, therefore, occur in more than 100 serotypes. It should be noted that a poliovirus has been constructed that expresses neutralization antigenic determinants of all three serotypes. This virus, which is severely handicapped in proliferation, is trivalent as it can be neutralized by all three serotype-specific antibodies (Murdin et al., 1992) .",

For example, the Ccluster consists of the three serotypes of poliovirus and of serotypes 1, 11, 13, 15, 17, [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] . Originally the C-CAVs were not considered related to polioviruses because of the profound difference in pathogenesis (common cold and poliomyelitis, respectively) and the different use of receptor (ICAM-1 and CD155, respectively). However, their very close kinship was revealed by genome sequence. This proximity has led to the interesting question of whether the C-CAVs are genetic variants of poliovirus (Harber et al., 1995) or vice versa (discussed in detail in Evolution An interesting recent variant of CAV24 is CAV24v, an agent that emerged in the early 1970s and that causes acute hemorrhagic conjunctivitis. This syndrome is also associated with a new variant of enterovirus 70, a D-cluster enterovirus (Table 12.1; Yin-Murphy, 1973) . The phenomenon of the sudden appearance of enterovirus strains causing human diseases not previously associated with picornaviruses is of greatest interest with respect to the dynamics of picornavirus diversification, particularly in view of the eradication of poliovirus. What are the mechanisms by which the picornaviruses and other RNA virus families have diversified? Clearly, the genetic program inscribed into the viral genome is being changed as the viruses acquire new genetic traits. The predominant driving force of the changes in the genotype is largely an adaptation to new opportunities to proliferate. In the following, we will discuss some mechanisms and rules of genetic diversification and evolution of picornaviruses. sequences involved in RNA replication, and the internal ribosomal entry site (IRES), controlling translation.",

In deviation to c a p -d e p e n d e n t \"scanning\", IRESes promote internal ribosomal entry, i.e. they allow initiation of translation independently of a capping group and even a free 5' end (Jang et al., 1988 (Jang et al., , 1989 Pelletier and Sonenberg, 1988; Molla et al., 1992; Chen and Sarnow, 1995) . Remarkably, IRES elements are defined by their function, not by their sequences or apparent higher-order structure(s). This is illustrated in Figure 12 .3, which depicts the sequence and folding pattern of the IRES elements of poliovirus and encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV; Pilipenko et al., 1989a,b) . In spite of these differences, the poliovirus IRES has been exchanged with that of EMCV, leading to a novel chimeric virus with excellent growth properties . Similarly, the IRES of hepatitis C virus (HCV), a flavivirus, was found to functionally substitute for the poliovirus IRES, yielding a p o l i o / H C V chimeric virus (Lu and Wimmer, 1996; Zhao et al., 1999) . Finally, a construct in which the IRES of h u m a n rhinovirus type 2 (HRV2) replaced that of poliovirus yielded a P V / H R V chimeric virus (PVI(RIPO)) that is FIGURE 12.3 Sequences and secondary structures of IRES elements of poliovirus and encephalomyocarditis virus. A. Poliovirus IRES; individual domains have been labeled with Roman numerals. B. Encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV) IRES; domains have been labeled with capital letters. Both IRESes contain a conserved YnXmAUG motif, of which the oligopyrimidine stretch (Yn) and the AUG triplet are indicated by solid bars. Note that in the EMCV IRES, the AUG triplet of the YnXmAUG motif is the initiating codon of the polyprotein. In the poliovirus IRES, this AUG triplet is silent and is separated from an AUG codon initiating the synthesis of the polyprotein by a \"spacer sequence\" of 154 nt (Jang et al., 1990) . Single attenuating mutations in the poliovirus vaccine strains map to domain V (Wimmer et al., 1993) .",

Theoretically, the poliovirus polyprotein could give rise to 77 different cleavage products if proteolytic processing by these enzymes and the maturation cleavage were entirely random (Wimmer et al., 1993) . In fact, only roughly 29-30 cleavage products have been identified in poliovirus-infected cells (Nicklin et al., 1986) . It has thus been concluded that processing of the picornavirus polyproteins is not random but follows a pathway that is determined by protein folding (masking of cleavage sites) and by the amino-acid sequences surrounding the scissile bond ( Figure 12 .4B, C; Harris et al., 1990) . For example, the precursor 3CD pr~ can be cleaved into 3C pr~ and 3CD p~ by a (cis?) cleavage in which the 3C/3CD pr~ proteinase is involved. Both 3C pr~ and 3D p~ are quite stable end-products of processing. However, in the case of poliovirus type 1 (Mahoney) (PV1 (M)), 3CD pr~ can also be efficiently processed in trans by 2A pr~ to 3C' and 3D' (Figure 12 .4C), two polypeptides with no apparent function in viral proliferation (Lee and Wimmer, 1988) . Just like 3C pr~ and 3D p~ 3C' and 3D' are quite stable endproducts of processing, even though 3D p~ harbors a perfect cleavage site for 2A pr~ and 3C' harbors a cleavage site for 3C/3CD pr~ (Figure 12.4) . Indeed, in PVl(M)-infected cells, nearly equal amounts of the four cleavage products of precursor 3CD pr~ are observed. It is assumed that structural constraints mask one or the other cleavage site from recognition and processing once the cleavage product has been formed (Lee and Wimmer, 1988) .",

Cleavage at TQSQ*G between 3C and 3D is slow, giving rise to the 3CD p~~ cleavage intermediate with a long half-life (Cao and Wimmer, 1996) . mutated this AxxQ*G cleavage motif at a specific site in order to avoid proteolytic processing. The amino acids placed by the mutants into the motif confirmed the proposed interaction between substrate and enzyme during cleavage (Cao and Wimmer, 1996 , and references therein). As will be discussed later, poliovirus is a purist with respect to cleavage signals, since the scissile bond in all cleavages, catalysed by 3C/3CD pr~ is Q*G (Kitamura et al., 1981; Semler et al., 1981a Semler et al., , 1981b . In other picornaviruses, or viruses of the large picoma-like superfamily, the cleavage site may differ from the canonical Q*G signal.",

However, reverse genetics was made more practical when the cDNA was cloned downstream of the phage T7 RNA transcriptase promoter and, using purified T7 transcriptase, virtually unlimited amounts of highly infectious transcript RNA could be produced in a simple test-tube experiment (>10 s PFU/~tg of transcript RNA; van der Werf et al., 1986) . This was important because mutant genomes with highly debilitating replication phenotypes could not be recovered by the inefficient cDNA transfection method. It was known before that VPg is not required to be at the 5' end for poliovirus RNA to be infectious (Nomoto et al., 1977a) . The 5' end of the T7 transcripts is pppGGUUAAAA.., whereas that of virion RNA is VPg-pUUAAAA... The extra G residues do not prevent transfection but they reduce the specific infectivity of the transcript. In any event, picornavirus RNA is quite tolerant of modifications of the 5' end of its genome and, in all cases, the virion RNAs isolated after transfections have the authentic terminus restored (Wimmer et al., 1993) .",

A replicative intermediate (RI) form consisting of a single +strand template and multiple nascent -RNA strands (A) has not been detected, so that, more probably, intermediates in -RNA synthesis are either mainly single-stranded (B) or double-stranded (C).

The evidence for the involvement of these proteins (2A pr~ 2B, 2BC, 2C, 3A, 3AB, VPg, 3C/3CD pr~ 3D p~ is based largely on genetic data or on biochemical experiments assumed to be indicative of genome replication (Wimmer et al., 1993; Xiang et al., 1997) . For example, genetic and bio-chemical analyses of 3AB strongly suggest that this protein, a non-specific RNA binding protein, and the proteinase 3CD pr~ participate in the formation of an initiation complex for +strands (Xiang et al., 1997) . Another example is the involvement of 2C in RNA replication. Briefly, poliovirus RNA synthesis is highly sensitive to the presence of 2 mM guanidine hydrochloride (Gua HC1); poliovirus mutants resistant to 2 mM Gua HC1 harbor a single amino-acid exchange (N179A/G) in polypeptide 2C. It has recently been established that 2C is an ATPase (and not a GTPase) and we now refer to it as 2C AwPase (Pfister and Wimmer, 1999) . The ATPase activity of purified 2C AwPase is inhibited by 2 mM Gua HC1, whereas that of purified 2C ATpase with a N179/G mutation is resistant to this concentration of the drug (Pfister and Wimmer, 1999) . On the basis of these considerations, it can be assumed that the ATPase activity of 2C AwPase is essential for genome replication. Just as with 3AB or 3CD pr~ however, the step(s) by which 2C AwPase is exerting its essential function are still unknown.",

Importantly, 3D p~ was established already in 1977 as being a primer-dependent and RNAdependent RNA polymerase . Although a deluge of circumstantial evidence suggested that a uridylylated form of VPg might serve as primer for 3D p~ (Nomoto et al., 1977b; Wimmer, 1982; Takeda et al., 1986; Toyoda et al., 1987) , direct evidence for this mechanism has been obtained only very recently (Paul et al., 1998b) . Briefly, VPg is being uridylylated to VPg-pU(pU) by the viral RNA polymerase 3D p~ in the presence of template (poly(A)). VPg-pU(pU) then primes the transcription of poly(A), leading to the synthesis of poly(U), which is the 5' terminus of-strands (Paul et al., 1998b) .",

            "text": "The participation in picornavirus replication of cellular proteins, referred to by investigators as \"host factors\", has also had a history of controversies. Several polypeptides were proposed to be involved in replication (e.g. a kinase or a uridylic acid transferase) but these proteins have disappeared after further analysis (Richards and Ehrenfeld, 1990 ). Ehrenfeld's and Semler's groups have recently identified a cellular 38 kDa RNA binding protein, poly(rC) binding protein 2 (PCBP2), that is not only required for the function of the poliovirus IRES but it has also the propensity to bind, together with 3CD pr~ to the poliovirus 5'-terminal cloverleaf (Blyn et al., 1996) . PCBP2 (or PCBP1, a protein related to PCBP2; Gamarnik and Andino, 1997) is undoubtedly the \"host factor p36\" that was originally proposed by Baltimore's group to effect the binding of 3CD pr~ to the poliovirus cloverleaf (Andino et al., 1990 (Andino et al., , 1993 . Andino et al. (1993) provided first evidence suggesting that the formation of a specific protein/cloverleaf RNP complex consisting of viral protein 3CD, a cellular protein (\"p36\") and the viral RNA is required for the initiation of +strand synthesis (Andino et al., 1993) . This hypothesis has been further supported by the discovery of PCBP2 (Gamarnik and Andino, 1997; Parsley et al., 1997) . PCBP2 is therefore a sensible candidate for a \"host factor\" involved in poliovirus RNA replication. However, poliovirus protein 3AB can replace PCBP2 in all biochemical reactions characteristic of the formation of a 5' terminal RNP. Moreover, 3AB and 3CD pr~ both cleavage products of the P3 precursor ( Figure 12 .4A), are associated in solution (Molla et al., 1994) . Finally, the phenotypes of mutants of 3AB in vivo and in vitro support the conjecture that 3AB is involved in the formation of a cloverleaf/3CDpr~ complex Xiang et al., 1995a,b) . Currently, there is no compelling evidence in favor of the cloverleaf/3CDPr~ complex over that of cloverleaf/3CDPF~ with respect to poliovirus genome replication (see a discussion in Xiang et al., 1997) .",

If so, only viral mRNA could serve as template in RNA synthesis. Since viral mRNAs lack VPg (Hewlett et al., 1976; Nomoto et al., 1976 ; see above), every +strand RNA that functions as template in RNA synthesis should also lack VPg. Available evidence suggests that all RNA templates involved in replication are terminated with VPg (Nomoto et al., 1977b; Petterson et al., 1977; Wu et al., 1978; Larsen et al., 1980) . Furthermore, RNA replication occurs in a tight membranous environment (Bienz et al., 1992) . Thus, it is unlikely that these genome replicating membranous complexes also harbor viral polysomes (Wimmer et al., 1993) . Indeed, crude, membranous replication complexes can be isolated from infected cells that can replicate poliovirus RNA yet they are free of ribosomes (Takegami et al., 1983; Takeda et al., 1986; Toyoda et al., 1987) .",

A similar model has been proposed for poliovirus by Gamarnik and Andino (1998) : the formation of an RNP consisting of cloverleaf/3CDpr~ at the 5' end of the viral mRNA inhibits further translation, thereby switching the template to replication. One problem with this model is that at the peak of poliovirus replication, translation and RNA syn-thesis occur concomitantly in the presence of an excess of 3CD pr~ molecules (note that for each virus particle, 60 molecules of 3CD pr~ are synthesized; the ratio of viral +strand RNA to unprocessed 3CD pr~ may be 1:100 through most of the replicative cycle).

It is unlikely that multiple initiation of-strands on the same template (prior to completion of the first-strand) occurs, since an RI with multiple -strands (such as in Figure 12 .5A) has not been found in infected cells (Bishop and Koch, 1969) . It is even possible that initiation at the poly(A) tail of poliovirus RNA occurs only once. Completion of the-strand will thus yield RF ( Figure 12 .5D), which we consider an intermediate in replication and not a byproduct (Wimmer et al., 1993) . One compelling argument in favor of this assumption is that in the RF the 5' end of +strands is in the close vicinity of the 3' end of -strands, a prerequisite first proposed by Baltimore and his colleagues (Andino et al., 1993; Harris et al., 1994) . Destabilization of this end of the RNA will lead to the formation of an RNP consisting either of cloverleaf/3CDpr~ or cloverleaf/3CDpr~ which, in turn, will free the 3' end of the-strand for VPgprimed +strand synthesis to occur ( Figure  12 .5E). Multiple initiation at this end will lead to the multistranded RI ( Figure 12 .5F), the nascent or full-length +strands being replaced during transcription by the 3D p~ unwindase.",

However, virus will replicate only if a HeLa cell $10 extract was co-injected with the RNA.

Analysis of the genotypes of progeny virus genomes (by RT/PCR) revealed only revertant or pseudorevertant RNAs. None of the original mutant genotypes were detectable.

            "text": "If a mutation (point mutation, linker insertion, etc.) engineered into the genome RNA is lethal, the lesion may effect complete abrogation of genome replication. Hence, reversion to viability cannot be expected. An interesting example of quasi-infectious versus lethal mutations in the poliovirus genome was described when mutations in VPg were studied (Kuhn et al., 1988; Reuer et al., 1990; Cao and Wimmer, 1995) . As mentioned, VPg is linked to the genome via a O4-(5'-uridylyl) tyrosine (the tyrosine in position three of VPg). A mutation of tyrosine to phenylalanine (Y3F) was originally described as being lethal (Reuer et al., 1990) . This conclusion made sense, since phenylalanine lacks a 04 hydroxyl group for phosphodiester formation. However, Cao and Wimmer (1995) later observed that cells transfected with VPg(Y3F) variant RNA produced viable virus, albeit only at very low frequency and only after prolonged incubation of the cultures. All of the progeny genomes carried a F3Y reversion. The possibility of contamination of the cultures with wt virus was excluded. The only explanation for this surprising result was that the VPg(Y3F) variant was quasi-infectious, presumably in that the threonine residue in position four of VPg may have served as a (poor) surrogate acceptor for uridylylation and protein priming of RNA synthesis (it should be noted that genome-linked terminal proteins are often attached to serine residues; Salas, 1991) . Further analyses supported this hypothesis. A VPg(T4A) variant was found to be viable, expressing good growth kinetics. In contrast, VPg(F3Y, T4A) variant RNA never yielded progeny virus and was, therefore, considered unable to replicate its RNA. This mutation then can be considered to be lethal.",

Genetic analyses have indicated that template switching occurs (predominantly?) during-strand synthesis (Kirkegaard and Baltimore, 1986) . 3. Recombination is precise: no deletions or insertions at sites of homologous recombination have been observed. This is true even if crossover occurred in the 154 nt long noncoding region (spacer region) between IRES and initiating AUG of poliovirus (Jarvis and Kirkegaard, 1992) even though the sequence of this \"spacer\" is not conserved amongst the three poliovirus serotypes (Toyoda et al., 1984) . Indeed, deletions in the \"spacer\" could conceivably be tolerated in view of the observations by Kuge and Nomoto (1987) and others that the spacer can be partially or completely deleted without loss of viability. 4. Template switching requires that the replication complex pauses, allowing a heterologous (invading) +strand to offer its service as template. An unsolved question is whether pausing and crossover is random (Jarvis and Kirkegaard, 1991) or non-random (Romanova et al., 1986) . The latter is in all probability true.",

Duggal and Wimmer (1999) observed that crossover patterns changed significantly when recombination occurred at different temperatures. Specifically, crossover between two genetically marked RNA strands at 34~ occurred over a wide range of the genome with preference for sequences coding for structural proteins in the 5'-terminal half of the genome. In contrast, recombination in vivo at 37~ and 40~ yielded crossover patterns that had shifted dramatically to a region encoding nonstructural proteins (Duggal and Wimmer, 1999) . Preferential selection of recombinants at 37~ and 40~ was ruled out by analyses of the growth kinetics of the recombinants. The reason for the temperature effect is unknown.

The resulting RNA transcripts proved highly infectious (Molla et al., 1992) .

These observations suggested that the insertion was stable, at least under the conditions studied. The EMCV IRES has no apparent sequence homology with any sequence of the poliovirus genome, the poliovirus IRES included. This eliminated the possibility that the EMCV IRES was rapidly removed by homologous recombination. Perhaps, illegitimate recombination (see below) to delete the IRES without debilitating the virus was a very rare event and not apparent in progeny virus.

Remarkably, the genome of this construct is 17% larger than that of the wt genome, an observation indicating that the capsid of naturally occurring polioviruses is not \"full\". However, attempts failed to encapsidate and express the larger luciferase gene instead of the CAT gene in the context of the dicistronic virus. The luciferase activity was clearly detectable in cells transfected with the appropriate dicistronic transcript, but the genome harboring luciferase was not encapsidated .

In these experiments, the strategy of Altmeyer et al. (1994) was mirrored, which made use of the genetic make-up of cardioviruses (mengovirus or EMCV). Specifically, the cardiovirus polyprotein is preceded by a small leader protein (67 aa) that is cleaved from the capsid region P1 by the viral 3C pr~ proteinase, thereby allowing maturation and encapsidation of the virion. Altmeyer et al. (1994) inserted into the leader sequence of the mengovirus genome a foreign gene ( Figure  12 .6F) and expressed the product of this fusion protein over several passages in tissue culture (Altmeyer et al., 1994 (Altmeyer et al., , 1995 . Andino et al., (1994) generated a similar \"leader\" protein in front of the poliovirus polyprotein. In this case, however, it was necessary to engineer a novel 3C/3CD pr~ cleavage site between the foreign ORF (the new \"leader\") and the viral polyprotein such that the foreign polypeptide can be cleaved from the poliovirus capsid precursor (Figure 12 .6E). Although these poliovirus constructs were originally claimed to express excellent growth properties and, more importantly, were reported to be genetically highly stable (Andino et al., 1994) , the poliovirus-based vectors proved, in fact, impaired in replication and prone to rapid deletions, at least if the insert was more than 500 nt in size (Mueller and Wimmer, 1998 , and references therein; see below). It should be noted that the cardiovirus-based vectors also suffered from loss of the inserts of a foreign gene upon repeated passage, an observation suggesting that even cardioviruses do not tolerate an extended leader protein for the purpose of gene therapy (Altmeyer et al., 1994 (Altmeyer et al., , 1995 .",

The apparent genetic stability of these replicons may be due to the fact that the RNAs are similar in size when compared to the wt genome, and that the naturally occurring cis cleavage (between PI*P2) catalyzed by 2A pr~ is highly efficient, placing no restriction on this step of polyprotein processing. However, the rapid selection of faster growing variants that lost the foreign gene is unlikely, since the trans-encapsidated replicons can only proceed to a one-step infectious cycle. This is very different from the selection pressure in proliferation-competent vectors, which engage in second-round infections.",

Homologous recombination cannot function because there is not enough sequence homology to engage in crossover. Pilipenko et al. (1995) have nevertheless proposed that short sequences may serve as parting and anchoring sites for template switching in illegitimate (non-homologous) recombination. An alternative mechanism is \"loop-out\" deletion, in which the nascent strand skips endogenous sequences, jumping to an upstream sequence that serves as anchoring sequence. Given the high frequency by which recombination occurs among sibling strands, a crossover mechanism may be favored, but decisive experiments to decide between these two mechanisms are lacking. In any case, a detailed study of genetic variations of polyprotein fusion vectors (Figure 12 .6D) strongly supports the model of parting and anchoring sites for template switching or loop-out deletion (Mueller and Wimmer, 1997; see below) .",

Upon replication, the inserted sequences were rapidly deleted as early as the first growth cycle in HeLa cells. Interestingly, the vector viruses did not readily revert to wt sequences but rather retained some of the insert plus the artificial 3C/3CD pr~ cleavage site (to allow processing at the N-terminus of the polyprotein). Thus, variants of different genotypes that replicated nearly as well as wt poliovirus had followed an evolutionary pathway towards the genetic organization of cardioviruses (Mueller and Wimmer, 1998) . That is, the poliovirus polyprotein of these variants was preceded by gag-derived \"leader\" proteins of different but distinct sizes (predominantly between 20 and 50 aa long), the most prominent leader size reflecting the length of that in cardioviruses (67 aa). In the immediate vicinity of the deletion borders of several isolates, short direct sequence repeats were observed that are likely to allow alignment of RNA strands for non-homologous (illegitimate) recombination during-strand synthesis (Figure 12.7; Mueller and Wimmer, 1998) . Interestingly, the selection of the leader size occurred during the very first rounds of replication of the transfected RNA; in most cases, as sequential shortening of the leader sequence was not observed.",

All naturally occurring DI particles carry deletions in the P1 capsid precursor region (Cole et al., 1971; Cole and Baltimore, 1973; Lundquist et al., 1979; Nomoto et al., 1979; Kajigaya et al., 1985; Kuge et al., 1986) . As mentioned before, Nomoto and his colleagues have found that the deletions in all DI particles are in-frame (Kuge et al., 1986) . Since genetically engineered DI genomes (replicons) with an out-of-frame deletion in the P1 region are unable to replicate, Nomoto and his colleagues (Kuge et al., 1986; Hagino-Yamagushi and Nomoto, 1989) correctly concluded that poliovirus RNA replication requires, at some stage of the replicative cycle, translation of the replicating RNA (cis requirement of translation), and that the DI particles with out-of-frame deletion cannot be complemented in trans. Novak and Kirkegaard (1994) confirmed this hypothesis in that replicons with translation termination codons downstream ofthe P1 coding region could not be rescued in trans. For hypotheses to explain this phenomenon, see above. Chetverin et al. (1997) have recently made the startling observation that certain RNA fragments can join to one another via a molecular pathway determined by the intrinsic chemical properties of the RNA molecules (Chetverin et al., 1997) . The fragments that formed chemically stable duplexes were selected by the replicase of phage Q[3: only those dimers that had acquired signals from two different RNA molecules were able to replicate. Gmyl et al. (1999) have now reported that viable recombinants could also be generated from non-replicating and non-translatable segments of the poliovirus genome. These fragments by themselves were unable to generate the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase necessary for a replication-dependent recombination event. The \"crossovers\" were targeted to the highly variable segment of 154 nucleotides located within the 5'NTR upstream of the initiating AUG codon for the polyprotein. A great number of recombinants have been obtained by transfection of mixtures of RNA fragments. Analyses of viruses that evolved after the mix- ",

The free 3' end of the nascent-RNA can re-anneal to a short complementary sequence further upstream on the same template strand, thereby looping out the intervening sequence (A), or it can re-anneal to the same complementary sequence but on a sibling +strand, and complete synthesis on this second template (B; strand switching).

Based on these considerations, we have suggested that the picornavirus genome be considered \"monocistronic\" (Wimmer et al., 1993) . It follows that the genome encodes only one gene product, the polyprotein. The polyprotein, in turn, contains multiple genetic units whose products may or may not be capable of intracistronic complementation. If this definition is accepted, one should avoid referring to individual coding regions of the picornavirus genome as \"genes\". Thus, there would be no \"3D p~ gene\". This convention makes good sense if one considers that a \"gene for 3D p~ is for the most part also the gene for 3CD pr~ a proteinase with properties unrelated to the polymerase 3D p~ It should be noted that Theiler's virus is an exception to the monocistronic nature of picornaviruses in that it encodes a small protein in a separate reading frame, mapping towards the N-terminus of the polyprotein .",

For example, the insertion of a second IRES into the genome would represent a viable dicistronic virus (Figure 12.6B) , an entity artificially generated by Molla et al. (1992, 1993b) . Apparently, during the evolution of picornaviruses, the elimination of genetic elements regulating the expression of different picornavirus proteins was favored over retaining them. Similarly, there was no pressure to generate such regulatory sequences and insert them into the genome. In other words, proteolytic processing of a single polyprotein evolved not only to be highly efficient but also as a means to regulate the temporal appearance of viral proteins (e.g. precursor proteins versus end-products of proteolytic cleavage). In contrast, in prokaryotic RNA phages or in-strand RNA viruses, the expression of proteins is regulated by sequence elements located between different cistrons.",

Indeed, CPMV and the dicistronic poliovirus shown in Figure 12 .6B have similar gene order and amino acid sequences, the main difference being that the genome of CPMV is bipartite. That is, rather than inserting a sequence such as an IRES into the genome, CPMV preferred to divide the genome into two portions, one coding for the capsid proteins the other for the replication proteins. Such a genetic arrangement, which requires two particles to initiate a complete infectious cycle, may be suitable for a plant virus (where the yield of virus per host can be extremely high and, equally importantly, the local concentration of host organisms can be high) but it would be highly disadvantageous for an animal virus.",

Complementation of guanidine mutants seemed unidirecional (Wimmer et al., 1993) . Bernstein et al. (1986) provided the first conclusive evidence for symmetric complementation, using mutants that were generated in 2A pr~ and 3A. These authors, however, also made the unexpected observation that mutants mapping to 2B or 3D p~ (which they had also generated by genetic engineering) could not be complemented (Bernstein et al., 1986) . On the other hand, Charini et al. (1991) clearly showed that mutations in 3D p~ mapping to a different region of the coding sequence could be rescued in trans. This example and many others (Wimmer et al., 1993) support the notion that the polyprotein is a single genetic unit that does not consist of non-overlapping genes whose functions can be separated by complementation grouping. A special case of complementation was tested using dicistronic polioviruses. Briefly, Cao and Wimmer (1995) constructed a virus with a genotype shown in Figure 12 .6B, the extra cistron being the coding region for poliovirus 3AB. The dicistronic construct yielded a virus expressing a small plaque phenotype but it was genetically unstable, losing its inserts after several passages. Nevertheless, if the lethal mutation VPg(Y3F, T4A) was engineered into the second cistron of the dicistronic virus (see above), the first cistron (3AB) could rescue the genome, albeit inefficiently.",

This was the case when widespread epidemics of acute hemorrhagic conjunctivitis ravaged Africa and the pacific rim (Yin-Murphy, 1973) and quickly expanded worldwide. Two picornaviruses were associated with this previously unknown clinical syndrome, coxsackievirus A24 variant (CAV24v) and enterovirus 70 (EV70; Table 12 .1). The former evolved from its ancestral CAV24, causing mild upper respiratory tract infections, whereas EV70 was primarily recognized for its association with a poliomyelitis-like neurological disorder (Melnick et al., 1974) . The deviation of tropism toward ocular tissues resulting in acute hemorrhagic conjunctivitis suggests a switch or an expansion in receptor specificity. This hypothesis, however, awaits confirmation, since the cellular receptor(s) of EV70 is unknown ( The circumstances and conditions that may favor a switch in host cell tropism with resulting changes in the pathogenic phenotype are unknown. A detailed discussion of our current view of the evolution of enteroviruses, however, is presented in the following section on Evolution. This is particularly relevant in the context of the imminent global eradication of poliovirus. It is known that coxsackieviruses A7 and A9 (CAV7, CAV9) as well as enteroviruses 70 and 71 (EV71) occasionally cause a clinical syndrome with striking resemblance to poliomyelitis (Melnick et a!., 1974) . Occurrence of poliomyelitis caused by these virus species has only rarely been reported in epidemic proportions (Voroshilova and Chumakov, 1959; Melnick et al., 1980) ; generally they occur as isolated incidents. Fortunately, preliminary evidence (da Silva et al., 1996) suggests that to date no surge in non-PV-caused poliomyelitis has occurred in response to the eradication of poliovirus in Latin America. However, the time elapsed since the eradication of wt polioviruses in the western hemisphere is too short in terms of evolution to conclude that the incidence of non-PV-caused poliomyelitis and poliovirus eradication are unrelated (see section on Evolution).",

A small segment in capsid protein VP1 of PV2(L) (the B-C loop) has been identified as carrying determinants of host range extension from primates to rodents (Murray et al., 1988) . However, whereas PV2(L) infection causes poliomyelitis in primates and in CD155 tg mice, normal mice developed histopathology indicative of panencephalomyelitis, which was radically distinct from poliomyelitis observed in primates and CD155 tg mice (Gromeier et al., 1995) . This observation suggests PV2(L) tropism toward a cell type in mice that is not targeted in primates. It is likely that the mouse-adapted PV2(L) acquired additional receptor specificity but the nature of the receptor for PV2(L) in normal mice is unknown. It should be noted that although PV2(L) causes disease in mice after intracerebral injection, cultivated mouse L cells cannot be infected with this strain (Gromeier et al., 1995) .",

Viruses normally evolve to adapt to host cells offering adequate portal of entries (receptors), thereby exposing the viral particles to an intracellular milieu supportive of particle propagation. Thus, favorable cell-internal conditions for viral replication would ideally be matched by a suitable viral receptor to avoid virus entry into cells that do not permit replication.

As has been discussed in the section on Genetics, the 5'NTR harbors the internal ribosomal entry site (IRES) that, on the basis of the early observation by Evans et al. (1985) with the Sabin type 3 vaccine strain, has been identified as a major determinant of virulence for a number of picornaviruses. Sequence comparison of the Sabin strains of poliovirus with their wt progenitors revealed point mutations within a confined region of the 5'NTR in all three serotypes, known as domain V (Figure 12 .3; reviewed in Wimmer et al., 1993) . In analyses of viral strains recovered from patients who acquired paralytic polio after vaccination, a point mutation at position 472 (direct reversion in domain V) of the IRES of PV3(Sabin) was proposed to contribute to the neurovirulence of the isolate (Evans et al., 1985) . Recent analyses led to a different hypothesis stressing a co-operative attenuating effect of capsid mutations with mutations in the IRES and other locations in the Sabin vaccine genomes (McGoldrick et al., 1995) . The mechanism responsible for IRES-mediated attenuation of neurovirulence remains obscure. Analyses of cell-type-specific growth restrictions in cell lines of neuronal origin and biochemical studies of cell-type-specific IRES function suggested impairment of initiation of translation in a cell-type-specific manner (Haller et al., 1996; Agol et al., 1989; La Monica and Racaniello, 1989) . Following the example of poliovirus, IRES elements or surrounding sequences of a large number of picornaviruses were found to contain genetic markers with a role in the determination of a pathogenic phenotype. This was most impressively demonstrated by the drastic attenuating effect of a deletion within the poly(C) tract of the 5'NTR of EMCV (Duke et al., 1990) .",

Poliovirus host range is limited to primates only. Within the primate organism poliovirus replicates within an unknown site in the gastrointestinal tract and within associated lymphatic structures, leading to viremia (Bodian, 1972) . At this stage, the virus causes hardly any disease symptoms. However, viremia may, in only about 1% of infections, lead to CNS invasion, presumably through passive passage of the blood-brain barrier (Yang et al., 1997) . On muscle injury, the virus may also reach the CNS via retrograde axonal transport Wimmer, 1998, 1999) . Within the CNS, poliovirus uniquely targets spinal cord anterior horn motor neurons. Lytic destruction of anterior horn motor neurons results in flaccid paralysis, the hallmark clinical sign of paralytic poliomyelitis (Bodian, 1972) .",

This peculiar restriction has been the subject of research interest for many years. Available evidence clearly suggests that the restriction of the host range of poliovirus to primates is determined predominantly by the receptor. In humans, this receptor is the immunoglobulin superfamily molecule CD155 (Mendelsohn et al., 1989) and two proteins closely related to CD155 function as poliovirus receptor in simians (Koike et al., 1990) . Clearly, the observed organ and cell tropism are co-determined by the virus's dependence on the cellular receptor. We believe that, at least in part, the expression of CD155 must also determine the highly restrictive cell tropism of poliovirus within the CNS, because mice transgenic for the CD155 gene develop a neurological condition with pathologic and clinical features identical to those observed in primates (Ren et al., 1990; Koike et al., 1991; Gromeier et al., 1996) . Furthermore, support for this hypothesis comes from studies of transcriptional control (Solecki et al., 1999) and developmental expression of the CD155 gene (Gromeier et al., 1999b) . It has been reported that CD155 expression is restricted to structures in close anatomical and functional relationship with spinal cord anterior horn neurons during embryonic development of the CNS (Gromeier et al., 1999b) . It is thus likely that the restrictive expression pattern of CD155 may indeed direct poliovirus tropism toward a specific cellular compartment of the CNS.",

The diverse spectrum of disease syndromes associated with human picornaviruses provides an excellent field of study to examine the factors that determine the clinical outcome of a viral infection. The enormous amount of sequence information, combined with a broad knowledge of the molecular biology of many of these agents, have sparked hopes of a rapid elucidation of the molecular basis for their pathogenic properties. Initial optimism that sequence comparison of virulent strains with their attenuated variants alone would rapidly identify those elements responsible for a pathogenic phenotype and unravel mechanisms of pathogenesis is, however, unjustified. This is particularly true for poliovirus, the most thoroughly studied picornavirus. Progress in the analysis of poliovirus neuropathogenicity has revealed that the interactions of poliovirus with the host are characterized by a degree of complexity not previously appreciated. Mechanistic concepts of viral pathogenesis, combined with one-dimensional views of virus replication and its relation to the host organism, have helped little in increasing our understanding of the selective susceptibility to poliovirus of motor neurons. Viral infections result in complex clinical syndromes that are difficult to explain in terms of single viral genetic elements. Using poliovirus as an example, picornavirus-induced disease is the result of an intricate interplay of numerous factors, of both viral and host origin, that coordinately affect the ability of the virus to propagate in any particular cell type or organ.",

It is less appreciated, although equally true, that it is the host environment that has provided new opportunities for viruses to proliferate and select new variants out of a huge number of mutants.

Indeed, the relatively slow pace by which the cellular environment is changing imposes severe restrictions on the mode of RNA virus evolution. A model has been proposed suggesting that, in each moment of protein evolution, mutations could only be accepted in a very limited number of positions of a polypeptide chain; otherwise, protein structure and function would have been severely compromised. These limited places of acceptable variation have been called covarions (Fitch, 1971) . It has been argued that the fast evolution of RNA viruses in a constrained environment has to proceed through the exploitation of constantly emerging but vastly overlapping covarions . This model of virus evolution provides a sensible hypothesis as to how picornaviral proteins have managed to accept a heavy load of mutations that are quite frequently unique and rarely seen at sites in cellular proteins, while still not entirely losing some discernible similarity with other viral and cellular homologs. This has important practical consequences, since structural similarities can be used to reconstruct the evolution of RNA viruses, an undertaking impossible just 20 years ago.",

As already noted, TMEV encodes a small, unique L* polypeptide outside the main reading frame at a locus overlapping the L reading frame. Additionally, the insect picornavirus InFV was predicted to encode unique domains as part of the polyprotein (Isawa et al., 1998; A.E. Gorbalenya, unpublished results) . A closer look at these proteins reveals the following. The L polypeptide preceding the capsid coding region (Figure 12 .9) is encoded by all picornaviruses except the entero-and rhinoviruses. The L protein is the most variable of all picornavirus proteins, and it exists in five different versions. L proteins with proteinase activity are encoded only by FMDV, ERV1 and ERV2 (Skern, 1998) .

For each picorna-like family group, excluding APV, the conserved organization of an \"averaged\" genome typical for this group is shown and compared with that of picornaviruses. The genomes are aligned with respect to the position of the 3D (-like) locus (the RNA polymerase). \"Averaging\" was carried out with respect to genome size so that most conserved genome features could be shown. Note that bymoviruses, comprising a genus of Potyviridae, have a bipartite genome. It is believed that all picoma-like viruses contain VPg at the 5'-end, although a VPg has not yet been demonstrated for every group of viruses. In picoma-like viruses, proteins were designated so as to reflect their similarity to the prototype picornavirus enzymes, although other nomenclatures may be in use by other investigators. Apart from studies with picomaviruses, enzymatic activities have been ascribed to some proteins of como-, poty-, calici-and sequiviruses, but the complete processing map of polyproteins has been established only for como-and potyviruses. The conserved 0~/~ Rossmann-fold and palm-like fold comprise only one of the domains of 2C and 3D, respectively, or their homologs. For further details, see legends to Figures 12.2 and 12.4, and the text. stranded antiparallel beta-barrel fold, dubbed \"jelly-roll\" (Rossmann and Johnson, 1989) . Amongst RNA and DNA viruses of different families, this fold is the most common to build icosahedral capsids (Rux and Burnett, 1998) . It is also conserved in a number of cellular proteins (Rossmann, 1987; Orengo et al., 1997) . Second, the core domain of 3D p~ containing several highly conserved sequence motifs, is related to a number of polynucleotide polymerases includ-ing RNA-dependent RNA polymerases of RNA viruses, reverse transcriptases of viral and cellular origins, and DNA-dependent DNA polymerases (Hansen et al., 1997 ). An analysis of the crystal structure of PV 3D p~ has also identified a (palm) subdomain adopting a RRM-like fold conserved among a number of functionally different proteins, including ribosomal proteins L7/L12 and $6 as well as the UIA splicing factor (Hansen et al., 1997) . Third, two picomavirus proteinases, the ubiquitous 3C pr~ and entero/rhinovirus-specific 2A pr~ have adopted 12-stranded antiparallel two beta-stranded barrel folds, conserved in cellular serine proteases with chymotrypsin as the prototype (reviewed in Skern, 1998) . These picornavirus proteinases have also relatives that are encoded by (+)RNA viruses belonging to dozens of different species (Gorbalenya and Snijder, 1996; Ryan and Flint, 1997) . Unlike cellular proteases, the picornaviruses 3C pr~ and 2A pr~ employ cysteine as the principal catalytic nucleophile and, in some lineages, have another unique replacementinstead of the catalytic Asp they use a Glu . The other small family of picornavirus proteinases, L pr~ of aphthoviruses, ERV1 and ERV2, is related to cellularpapain-like proteases (Gorbalenya et al., 1991; Skern, 1998) whose homologs have been identified in many animal and plant RNA viruses as well (Gorbalenya and Snijder, 1996) . Finally, 2C ATPase, whose structure is yet to be solved, belongs to the so-called helicase superfamily III. This protein group includes polynucleotidestimulated ATPases, some with helicase activity, which are encoded by (+)RNA and small DNA viruses as well as proteins of cellular origin (Gorbalenya and Koonin, 1990, 1993b) . The 2C AwPase has been predicted to be a three-domain protein. Two (x/(x domains flank an ATP-binding domain adopting a variation of the (x/J3 \"Rossmann\" fold, which is widespread in the protein world (Teterina et al., 1997) .",

Nevertheless, a preliminary functional profile of picornavirus proteins fits patterns of conservation evident at the structural level. The most conserved non-structural proteins provide the basic enzymatic activities needed for the synthesis and expression of viral RNAs inside the cell. The three conserved capsid proteins form the scaffold of virions shielding virus RNA from the detrimental environment outside the cell. All these activities appear to be virus-specific, although they may be modulated by cell-encoded components. In contrast, non-conserved viral proteins seem to sense and modify the host environment in addition to serving basic biosynthetic processes pro-grammed by the viral genomes (for instance, see Piccone et al., 1995; Zoll et al., 1996; Svitkin et al., 1998; Ventoso et al., 1998) . Virions also have host-dependent functions, such as the recognition of the cellular receptor, entry and, possibly, virion maturation. Different lines of evidence have shown that the least conserved regions of three capsid proteins, as well as VP4, may mediate these early activities of host cell entry (for recent work, see Hadfield et al., 1997, and Lentz et al., 1997) .",

This order is inflexible and none of the picornaviruses violates it, although entero-and rhinoviruses do not encode L proteins (see above). Despite a near absolute conservation of the order of protein domains, there is some plasticity (Figure 12 .10). Upon computer sequence analyses of the picorna-like viruses, it has become evident that the polyprotein can be divided into two parts, one comprising capsid proteins and the other the non-structural proteins. These parts are expressed rather independently. In a group of picorna-like insect viruses, Rhopalosiphum padi virus (RhPV), Drosophila C virus (DCV), Plautia stali intestine virus (PSIV) and cricket paralysis virus (CrPV), non-structural and capsid proteins are encoded by two ORFs, separated by a NTR (Koonin and Gorbalenya, 1992; Johnson and Christian, 1998; Moon et al., 1998; Nakashima et al., 1998; Sasaki et al., 1998) . In Comoviridae, a family of plant viruses, the capsid and non-structural proteins are encoded by two distinct RNAs, RNA2 and RNA1 (Goldbach, 1986) . Remarkably, in the dendrogram shown in Figure  12 .8, Comoviridae, Sequiviridae, a plant virus family having the same polyprotein organization as Picornaviridae (Turnbull-Ross et al., 1993) and picorna-like insect viruses form a division immediately adjacent to the Picornaviridae.",

(VPg)-3Cpr~ p~ (or equivalents). The functions assigned to the individual members of the group of non-structural proteins remain provisional for the majority of known viruses. They have been inferred largely on the basis of sequence similarities with proteins of well-characterized viruses like poliovirus. Among the positionally highly conserved non-structural proteins, the genomelinked protein VPg has a special standing (highlighted by bracketing) since it is conserved functionally rather than structurally in the picornalike viruses (Figure 12 .10; Gorbalenya and Koonin, 1993a) .",

Pairs of neighboring proteins are separated at scissile bonds cleaved by a virus proteinase or, in case of the VP4/VP2 junction, by an unknown mechanism. It could be hypothesized that the position of protein domains could be changed as long as the corresponding proteins were released more or less independently from the precursor. This, however, is not the case, as the pathway of proteolytic processing in picornavirus polyproteins is not random. Furthermore, at least some intermediate precursors, e.g. 2BC, 3AB and 3CD pr~ have essential functions that differ from those of the end-product of processing (see the section on Genetics). These considerations provide a biological reasoning for the observed conservation of the protein order in polyproteins.",

            "text": "We have already pointed out that the order of two conserved units within the polyprotein, the capsid precursor and replicative modules, is flexible. The two least conserved proteins, L and 2A, flank the capsid precursor at the N-and Ctermini, respectively, and bring additional plasticity to the organization of the polyprotein. This is reflected also in terms of expression, i.e. the mechanism of proteolytic processing. Processing of the capsid precursors as well as of the replicative module at junctions separating conserved proteins involves exclusively the conserved 3C/3CD pr~ proteinases, a mechanism functioning not only in picornaviruses but also in other picorna-like viruses (Figure 12.10; Ryan and Flint, 1997) . In contrast, the three cleavages separating the poorly conserved L and 2A pro-teins from the neighboring polypeptide chains (L/VP4, VP1/2A and 2A/2B) are processed by a range of mechanisms in a genus-specific manner. Furthermore, whereas picornaviruses use two general pathways of cleavages -3C pr~ pr~ versus distinct mechanisms involving L and 2A-this genetic repertoire may be further diversified in some picorna-like viruses. For instance, in Comoviridae and insect viruses, capsid precursor and non-structural proteins are encoded by distinct ORFs (Figure 12 .10), which eliminates the need for cleavages separating these polypeptide chains. 3Cpr~ pr~ have emerged as the major enzymatic factors in the regulation of protein expression in all picorna-and related viruses. Interestingly, the primary structure of sites recognized by these proteases is virus-specific rather than position-specific. Among picornaviruses, entero-and rhinoviruses employ sets of structurally uniform sites while viruses of the other genera use more diversified sets. Poliovirus and HAV exemplify the most extreme diversity. In poliovirus, all eight cleavage sites have the same (\"canonical\") Q/G structure ( Figure 12.4) , whereas in HAV, six variations of this structure were described in different sites (Palmenberg, 1990) .",

This feature separates poliovirus proteins from the overwhelming majority of cellular and viral proteins. The latter are heterogeneous both in size and sequence, particularly at their termini, because of a relative abundance of mutations, including insertions and deletions. Structural regularities documented for poliovirus can be visualized in a form of weak primary structure periodicities with the common denominator of 11 comprising the major portion of the replicative module. On the basis of these observations, it has been proposed that the replicative module of picornaviruses has originated from a primitive self-replicating RNA molecule through consecutive multistep duplications (Gorbalenya, 1995; Gorbalenya et al., 1986) .",

This organization may look unique on first sight, but in fact it resembles that of all other picornaviruses distantly related to enteroand rhinoviruses. These terminal appendices in the poliovirus variants resemble the L proteins and, hence, these poliovirus chimeras have a \"cardio-like\" organization ( Figure 12 .6E).

It can be speculated that deletion events in the 2A coding region of FMDV and ERV1 are the result of \"jumping\" of 3D p~ perhaps by loop-out deletion or by illegitimate recombination (Figure 12.7) . On the other hand, the three adjacent coding regions for VPg uniquely found in all strains of FMDV suggest duplication events. In other viruses, e.g. ERV2 or TMEV, genetic events such as local duplication and deletions may have occurred, leading to considerable size heterogeneity of the corresponding VPgs and adjacent sequences (Wutz et al., 1996; A.E. Gorbalenya, unpublished results) . Duplications have also been discovered in the 5'NTR of enteroviruses (Pilipenko et al., 1989a) . Picornavirus genomic redundancy, known as duplications, may have been generated by intragenomic recombination. After duplications, however, the sequences must have undergone some variation so as to avoid elimination by homologous recombination. Indeed, the nucleotide sequences (and to a small extent also the amino acid sequences) of the three VPgs of FMDV differ such that homologous recombination at this locus is unlikely (Cao and Wimmer, 1996) .",

Phylogenetic analyses suggest that \"new\" unrelated 2A and L proteins have emerged in the course of evolution of picornaviruses on several occasions, following the split of the major groups of the picornavirus tree. It is logical to assume that, following each split, one of the two descendants has arisen from an ancestral viral source, the other from an \"independent\" source. As to the latter, the coding sequence of either 2A or L could have recombined with a gene of either another virus or of the cell, leading to the replacement of the ancestral coding sequence. For eXample, this replacement mechanism could have resulted in the capture of cellular chymotrypsin-like (2A pr~ or papain-like (L pr~ activities.

For example, enteroviruses have a \"spacer sequence\" between the IRES and the ORF of the polyprotein ~. This spacer commences with an unused (\"silent\") AUG at the 3' border of the IRES. In poliovirus, it is 154 nt long and represents a small out-of-frame ORF terminating inside the polyprotein ORF. If the silent AUG at the 5' end of the spacer were to trigger initiation of translation and, in addition, a frame-shift mutation connected the small ORF with the main ORF, a small \"leader\" peptide would be created fused to the polyprotein. All that is then necessary is a 3C pr~ cleavage site to sever the \"leader\" from VP4-and a genetic arrangement would have been created resembling that of cardio-and aphthoviruses (Jang et al., 1990) . Indeed, the silent AUG of poliovirus can be turned on by changing its Kozak context (Pestova et al., 1994) , and stable poliovirus variants can be isolated that carry short foreign leaders (see above; Mueller and Wimmer, 1998) . Thus, the conversion of an enterovirus to a cardiovirus genotype with respect to an L protein can be envisioned by relatively simple genetic changes. Similarly, it should be possible to convert a cardiovirus genotype in this region into an enterovirus genotype by silencing its L ORF.",

Apparently, the synthesis of L* may present the virus with an advantage in the natural host, a fact that may have contributed to its selection.

A most important characteristic, however, does further divide a group of very closely related picornaviruses (e.g. polioviruses): the susceptibility to activation by different neutralizing antibodies and, hence, the separation into serotypes (see the Introduction). It is logical to assume that the (negative) pressure of the immune system may be largely accountable for serotype diversification of picornaviruses. That is, the immune response can lead to the selection of viral variants resistant to the neutralizing immune response produced by the surviving host. Such variants would form a pool from which a new serotype could be further selected. In fact, such mechanism of virus evolution seems to dominate in the case of influenza A virus or immunodeficiency virus (HIV). However, the sheer unlimited degree of serotype diversification observed in influenza viruses or HIV is an exception rather than the rule amongst viruses. Indeed, not all picornaviruses seem to be able to easily produce new serotypes. For example, the genus Hepatovirus encompasses only one serotype while others are restricted to a few serotypes (e.g. poliovirus).",

Thus, immuneescaping viral mutants are likely to be enriched in those variants that have maintained the ability to efficiently interact with the cognate receptor and follow the pathway of uptake and uncoating. This is, of course, only speculative but, if correct, it would explain in part serotype restriction (Harber et al., 1995) . In this respect it may be informative to compare receptor specificities with serotype diversities of human enteroviruses, on the one hand and rhinoviruses on the other. These two genera encompass viruses that have diverged from an immediate common ancestor and radiated during the same time period (Figure 12.1) . In the course of evolution, different serotypes in roughly the same numbers have been generated in these two picornavirus branches: there are about 66 enterovirus and over 100 rhinovirus serotypes. This implies that viruses of the two genera are similarly prone to accumulation of changes in those capsid structures giving rise to new serotypes.

Thus, in contrast to the quite similar extent of serotype diversification in both genera, adaptation to new receptors is significantly more restricted in rhinoviruses than in the closely related enteroviruses. Importantly, there is an overlap between the two receptor patterns and, taken together, the ICAM-1 receptor specificity appears to be dominant among entero-and rhinoviruses. This can be interpreted to mean that the immediate common ancestor of both enteroand rhinoviruses may have used a receptor related to ICAM-1. Regardless of whether this is true or not, the subsequent evolution of ICAM-1-recognizing picornaviruses has proceeded differently, as seen in the disparity of the current use of this cellular receptor (>90 for rhinoviruses versus 11 for C-cluster coxsackieviruses). Given that the serotype diversification has proceeded at a similar pace in entero-and rhinoviruses, enteroviruses may have had greater opportunities -or a greater need -to adapt to new receptors in order to initiate an infection. This may be related to the function(s) of receptors in viral docking and uncoating: whereas rhinoviruses may need the receptor only for docking and uptake (because of their inherent sensitivity to the acidic pH inside late endosomes), the exceedingly stable enteroviruses do need the receptor (and possibly a co-receptor) for docking, uptake and uncoating. With poliovirus, a particle stable to detergents, proteases and low pH (pH 2), this is exemplified in the formation of A-particles, a labile product of receptor/virion interaction and an intermediate in uncoating . A-particle formation appears to involve also sequences of neutralization antigenic sites (Harber et al., 1995) . Thus, the intercourse between receptor and enterovirion may be much more complex than that between receptor and rhinovirion. Consequently, a change in the serotype may have forced enteroviruses to search for new receptors to retain the uncoating capacity of the cellular receptor.",

It seems possible that the initiation of an infectious cycle of HRV does not critically require an interaction between structures of the neutralization antigenic sites of the virion and ICAM-1. That is, the N-terminal domain of ICAM-1, by inserting itself into the virion's canyon, can effect docking, uptake and uncoating of the particle. Progression through any of these events is not critically dependent on sequences of the neutralization antigenic sites. If correct, it follows that variation of the antigenic sites does not restrict viral proliferation and serotype evolution. Consistently, in other picornaviruses the neutralization antigenic sites and the determinants recognizing the receptor would be much more overlapping and mutually dependent.",

Despite some bias inherent in current analyses, phylogenetic studies of picornaviral genomes suggest that Picornaviridae have radiated densely over the course of evolution, at both early and late stages (Figure 12.1) . Furthermore, picornaviruses are members of a superfamily with numerous distant relatives (Figure 12 .8) that infect a wide range of organisms, including both plants and animals. Some of these viruses, like Sequiviridae, employ a genetic plan that is basically a variation of the genetic plan used by picornaviruses (Figure 12 .10).",

By this criterion also, picornaviruses are successful, since the majority of them, representing different branches of the picornavirus tree, infect humans. Humans are arguably one of the most successful species in the biological world. In truth, picornaviruses are relatively harmless even though few humans, if any, can escape picornavirus infections. This too can be viewed as evidence that these viruses have adapted well to their host, as they have not significantly undermined human affairs. This is true even for poliovirus, an agent that is commonly regarded as a deadly virus following epidemics of poliomyelitis. However, prior to this century, poliovirus did not cause epidemics, even though it infected humans at rates approaching 100%. Epidemics emerged because human behavior changed through the invention of modern hygiene. Hygiene broke the chain of natural immunization through infant infection combined with infant protection by maternal antibodies. Even in this century's devastating epidemics, however only 1-2% of infected individuals developed poliomyelitis. The poliovirus-human relationship alluded to above deserves to be discussed in more detail. Humans, who occupy a unique niche in the bio-logical world (because they care about each human life), did not accept their potential defeat as poliomyelitis became an epidemic. Unprecedented efforts combining medical research with modern technologies led to the development of two highly effective poliovirus vaccines, the inactivated poliovirus vaccine by Jonas Salk and the live attenuated vaccine by Albert Sabin (Wimmer et al., 1993) . Through education of the populace and advanced healthcare measures, mass vaccinations have gradually eliminated wild-type poliovirus, first in the developed countries and later in most of the world. Incredibly, the few cases of poliomyelitis in the western hemisphere now result from vaccination with the live Sabin strains. Overall, polio vaccination is a success story of greatest consequence. Indeed, through worldwide efforts led by the World Health Organization, it is likely that wild-type polioviruses will be eradicated globally by the turn of the century (WHO, 1985) .",

            "text": "The three serotypes of poliovirus belong to the C-cluster of enteroviruses (Table 12 .1; Figure  12 .1B). The most comprehensive analysis of the C-cluster has been performed with sequences of the VP4-VP2 capsids and with sequences of the 3D p~ RNA polymerase (Pulli et al., 1995) . Results of these analyses are consistent with data obtained in a study of the other regions of the viral genome using a less representative set of sequences (Poyry et al., 1996) . Therefore, these relationships shown in Figure 12 .1B can be assumed to be quite reliable. A phylogenetic analysis of the capsid VP4-VP2 region of C-cluster viruses indicated that the tree has split at least twice, perhaps before the emergence of an immediate ancestor of polioviruses. The first split led to the separation of a branch encompassing CAV1, CAV21 and CAV24 from the main C-cluster trunk, and the second, more recent one resulted in the separation of the ancestor for PV and the ancestor for CAV11, CAV13, CAV17, CAV18, CAV20 and CAV20b. The results obtained with sequences of 3D p~ favor an even more complex evolutionary history of poliovirus, including more than five intermediate steps (Pulli et al., 1995) . Consistent with the results of the analysis of the capsid region, CAV21 and CAV24 were among those viruses that diverged from the main trunk relatively early in evolution while the three poliovirus serotypes clustered together with CAV11, CAV13, CAV17 and CAV18. Remarkably, in the tree based on 3D p~ sequences the latter four coxsackieviruses (as well as several other coxsackieviruses) are interleaved with, rather than separated from, the three poliovirus serotypes (Figure 12 .1). This stands in contrast to the tree of the capsid region. Assuming the most parsimonious scenario of evolution, the combination of these results strongly implies that coxsackieviruses that recognize the ICAM-1 receptor formed a pool from which polioviruses, interacting with the CD155 receptor, have evolved. This conclusion is compatible with a hypothesis of the immune-driven evolution of entero-and rhinoviruses presented above. Furthermore, the analyses do not indicate that three polioviruses comprise a monophyletic subgroup within the C-cluster enteroviruses and, hence, have emerged from an ancestral virus by speciation, as one could expect from a distinct phenotypic profile of these viruses.",

These considerations may also have important practical implications. For the sake of the argument, we will assume that the poliovirus eradication campaign has been successfully completed and no more poliovirus particles, including those of the vaccine strains, are circulating worldwide. Furthermore, we will assume that all vaccination against poliovirus (including vaccination by inactivated vaccines) has been terminated, a scenario that has been envisioned to be a reality by the end of the next decade.

Prior to eradication, C-CAVs carrying such mutations could conceivably be eliminated by anti-poliovirus antibodies (Harber et al., 1995) but in the poliovirus-free world they may remain unchecked. This means that, once emerged, these new viruses carrying poliovirus-like neutralization antigenic sites with CD155 receptor affinity are less likely to be eliminated from the human population after eradication than before. Since all enteroviruses, the variants included, lead to enteric infections, these variants may find a passage to the CNS and, mediated by their affinity to CD155, may cause neurological disease. It is relevant to point out (Gromeier and Wimmer, unpublished results ) that poliovirus chimeric viruses in which the poliovirus IRES has been replaced with that of C-cluster IRES elements have been found to be highly neurovirulent in CD155 tg mice (see the section on Pathogenesis). Thus, there is reason to fear that in a poliovirus-free world new coxsackievirusrelated, poliovirus-like pathogens that can cause poliomyelitis may emerge in the course of natural viral evolution.

The RNA is packaged into a small, rigid, naked, icosahedral virion whose proteins are unmodified except for a myristate at the N-termini of VP4. The RNA itself does not contain modified bases. Thus, picornaviruses travel with light baggage. On first sight, the replication of picornaviruses is exceedingly simple. After having chosen a receptor from a large menu of cell-surface proteins, the virion enters the cytoplasm and immediately translates its genome, controlled by its IRES element. Thereafter, the polyprotein is processed by its own proteinases. RNA replication occurs by a unique, proteinprimed mechanism catalyzed by the RNAdependent RNA polymerase. Assembly appears to be linked to RNA synthesis, and release of the progeny virions follows a passive mechanism. There is no need for a cellular nucleus. Indeed, the entire replication cycle can occur in a cellfree system free of nuclei, mitochondria and perhaps of all other cellular organelles.",

Polyprotein processing proceeds in a controlled manner yielding cleavage intermediates and end-products that can be used for different functions. Thus, the menu of gene products is expanded through the temporal regulation of proteolytic processing. Details of all of these steps in replication are still obscure .",

            "text": "The key to ultimately understanding picornaviruses may be to rationalize the huge amount of information about these viruses from the perspective of evolution. It is possible that the replicative apparatus of picornaviruses originated in the precellular world and was subsequently refined in the course of thousands of generations in a slowly evolving environment. Picornaviruses cultivated the art of adaptation, which has allowed them to \"jump\" into new niches offered in the biological world. Also, by having chosen humans as an additional host, they were offered an abundance of opportunities to proliferate in different tissues, which has contributed to their diversification. These opportunities have further increased through the human population explosion and through changes in human behavior.",
