            "text": "The cheetah population in Namibia is the largest free-ranging population in the world and a key population for research regarding the health status of this species. We used serological methods and quantitative real-time PCR to test free-ranging and captive Namibian cheetahs for the presence of feline leukemia virus (FeLV), a gammaretrovirus that can be highly aggressive in populations with low genetic diversity, such as cheetahs. We also assessed the presence of antibodies to other gammaretroviruses and the responses to a FeLV vaccine developed for domestic cats. Up to 19% of the free-ranging cheetahs, 27% of the captive nonvaccinated cheetahs, and 86% of the captive vaccinated cheetahs tested positive for FeLV antibodies. FeLV-antibody-positive freeranging cheetahs also tested positive for Rauscher murine leukemia virus antibodies. Nevertheless, FeLV was not detectable by quantitative real-time PCR and no reverse transcriptase activity was detectable by product-enhanced reverse transcriptase assay in the plasma of cheetahs or the supernatants from cultures of peripheral blood mononuclear cells. The presence of antibodies to gammaretroviruses in clinically healthy specimens may be caused either by infection with a low-pathogenic retrovirus or by the expression of endogenous retroviral sequences. The strong humoral immune responses to FeLV vaccination demonstrate that cheetahs can respond to the vaccine and that vaccination against FeLV infection may be beneficial should FeLV infection ever become a threat, as was seen in Iberian lynx and Florida panthers.",

            "text": "T he cheetah population in Namibia is the largest free-ranging population of this vulnerable species (1) . For more than 2 decades, cheetahs have been considered highly susceptible to infectious diseases because of low genetic variability, which is assumed to impair immune responses to viral challenges (2) (3) (4) (5) . Evidence for fatal viral infections in cheetahs comes from an outbreak of feline infectious peritonitis (FIP), a consequence of feline coronavirus (FCoV) infections, in a captive population in the United States that was kept at nonethologically high density (6) (7) (8) and from a single case of very rapid feline leukemia virus (FeLV) disease progression in a captive Namibian cheetah in 1995 (9) . No disease outbreaks have been reported in any free-ranging cheetah population, but several studies have identified antibodies against viruses such as feline herpesvirus (FHV), feline calicivirus (FCV), feline parvovirus (FPV), FCoV, canine distemper virus (CDV), feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV), and rabies virus (10) (11) (12) (13) . In Namibia, free-ranging cheetahs are generally in good health; no clinical signs of viral infections were detected during sampling, and none of the histopathological examinations conducted after necropsies showed lesions related to viral infections (12) (13) (14) (15) . A recent study on major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I and class II confirmed the relatively low genetic variability in cheetahs (2) . Despite the small number of MHC class I alleles (10 alleles), Namibian cheetahs can still mount effective immune responses against some viral challenges, although their immunocompetence might be limited when they are confronted with new pathogens (2, 16) . Thus, it is important to continuously monitor the free-ranging cheetah population in Namibia, particularly for viruses for which no antibodies have been reported so far, such as FeLV, an oncogenic gammaretrovirus (10) (11) (12) (13) .",

Circumstantial evidence indicated that the origins of the infection were nonvaccinated feral and domestic cats viremic with FeLV (9) . Such a method of transmission and a course of disease were also observed in Florida panthers (Puma concolor coryi) (17) and Iberian lynx (Lynx pardinus), the most endangered free-ranging felid species (18) . In Namibia, cheetahs roam mainly on commercially used farmland, where they might come into contact with nonvaccinated feral and domestic cats and dogs, as well as freeranging leopards (Panthera pardus) and smaller carnivores (19, 20) . Previous studies documented that cheetahs in north-central Namibia have higher seroprevalences of FHV, FCV, FCoV, and CDV than do cheetahs in east-central Namibia (12, 13) . This is probably a consequence of greater contact frequency, due to a likely higher density of mostly nonvaccinated feral and domestic cats and dogs in regions with greater human populations (13, 21, 22) .",

In this retrospective study, blood samples that had been collected between June 2002 and July 2009 from 88 freeranging cheetahs (63 males and 25 females) on commercial farmland in east-central Namibia were analyzed. To study samples from animals living close to human settlements, with potential contact with domestic cats, we also sampled 56 cheetahs (37 males and 19 females) held in enclosures within their natural habitat. Thirty of the captive cheetahs were housed at the AfriCat Foundation, a nonprofit conservation facility for carnivores in central Namibia, and 26 on privately owned farms. We collected heparinized plasma samples from the free-ranging cheetahs, and we collected heparinized plasma and/or serum samples and EDTA-treated wholeblood samples from the cheetahs housed at AfriCat and the 26 captive cheetahs housed on private farms. Because samples collected over time may provide evidence of seroconversion, some animals were repeatedly used for sample collection. Of the free-ranging cheetahs, five were sampled twice, one was sampled three times, and one was sampled four times. Among the captive cheetahs, seven were sampled twice, two were sampled three times, and one was sampled four times. One animal was sampled as a free-ranging cheetah and later as a captive cheetah and was counted in both categories. The intervals between repeated sampling times ranged between 1 month and 28 months. In this study, we used 72 serum and 26 heparinized plasma samples from free-ranging cheetahs and 29 serum and 45 heparinized plasma samples from captive cheetahs. In addition, we used 26 EDTA-treated whole-blood samples from free-ranging cheetahs and 15 from captive cheetahs. Depending on the question examined, different sample sets were used (see \"Statistical analysis,\" below).",

Antibody levels were assessed by comparison with predefined positive-control sera, which consisted of pooled sera collected from FeLV regressor cats (29) . To determine FL-74 ELISA cutoff values, we measured the mean plasma OD values for specific-pathogen-free (SPF) cats (n \u03ed 15, assayed in duplicate), as a percentage of the positive-control value (assigned to be 100%). The cutoff value was set at the mean value plus 2.58 times the standard deviation (99% confidence interval for all negative results). Determination of the cutoff value for the p45 ELISA was performed in the same way, with 5 SPF cats.

After 1 day, 40 U/ml of interleukin 2 (IL-2) (Sandoz Pharmaceuticals AG, Cham, Switzerland) was added to the culture. Five milliliters of medium and IL-2 at 8 U/ml were added to the culture at day 3, and then 5 ml of medium was replaced and IL-2 at 8 U/ml was added to the culture every 3 to 4 days. Once a week, 5 ml of supernatant was collected, centrifuged for 10 min at 1,500 \u03eb g, and stored in 1-ml aliquots at \u03ea80\u00b0C. After 4 weeks, cells were frozen again and stored in liquid nitrogen. RT activity was assessed in supernatants collected in the fourth week of the PBMC cultures, at the Swiss National Center for Retroviruses, Uni-versity of Zurich (Zurich, Switzerland), using the product-enhanced reverse transcriptase (PERT) assay (36) . RT activity was also assessed in 12 heparinized plasma samples from WB-and ELISA-negative animals. Potential inhibition by heparin was excluded by testing a positive RT sample together with aliquots with and without heparin. As no inhibition was observed, no correction of the measured RT values was necessary.",

A similar observation has been reported recently for humans diagnosed with recent-onset psychosis (43) . Those subjects developed antibodies cross-reactive to MuLV and the Mason-Pfizer monkey virus (a simian D-type betaretrovirus), whereas patients with long-term schizophrenia or control subjects did not exhibit such cross-reactive antibodies (43) . Although this underlying cause is unlikely to be important for cheetahs, aberrant endogenous retrovirus expression might also be triggered by other factors and was reported to be involved in defective mice spermatogenesis (44) . Defective spermatogenesis can result in teratospermia, i.e., the production of \u03fe60% morphologically abnormal sperm per ejaculate, which is a well-known phenomenon in felids, particularly cheetahs (45) (46) (47) . However, the capacities of ejaculates from proven and unproven cheetah male breeders to inseminate oozytes in vitro do not differ (46) , suggesting that teratospermia in cheetahs is not of major concern for captive or free-ranging populations, particularly not for the world's largest population in Namibia. Still, aberrant endogenous retrovirus expression might be involved in the production of teratospermic ejaculates in cheetahs, eventually becoming problematic for particular individuals if teratospermia reaches levels that lead to infertility.",

Therefore, samples from FeLV-WB-positive and WB-negative animals were used in the PERT assay. The negative PERT results may be due to complete repression of the virus in the antibody-positive animals or the absence of infection in the antibody-negative animals. Animals with productive infections might exist in the wild only rarely or infections might have only a very short phase of viremia, with such animals having a rather low probability of being captured and sampled.

Therefore, in analogy to the situation in Mus pahari, we speculate that cheetahs, in the context of hunting (22) , become exposed to a gammaretrovirus present in wild mice. This virus might be able to transiently infect cheetahs, which develop an effective immune response, seroconvert, and are able to overcome this retroviral infection. Alternatively, cheetahs may react to low-level exposure to FeLV like domestic cats. In domestic cats exposed experimentally to low levels of FeLV, seroconversion to FeLV was observed but FeLV proviral DNA was found to be present only in very small amounts in some internal organs (31, 51) .",

We attempted to assess the magnitude of the immune responses after cheetahs have been vaccinated according to a protocol used for domestic cats (28) . The cheetahs housed at AfriCat that had been vaccinated for several years had higher OD values for p45 and FL-74 than did free-ranging and captive nonvaccinated cheetahs but similar OD values for p27 and similar patterns of antigen recognition in WB. The increased levels of antibodies to FL-74 virus in cheetahs with long residence at AfriCat can be explained by repeated FeLV vaccinations. Thus, tests for antibodies to p45 and FL-74 virus seem to be useful to assess the effects of FeLV vaccination on antibody induction also in cheetahs. From the 71% and 86% positive responses to p45 and FL-74 antigens, respectively, in the vaccinated cheetahs at AfriCat, it can be concluded that cheetahs readily respond to FeLV vaccination. However, of the five captive animals that were vaccinated once and retested 2 years later, only one animal (20%) demonstrated higher OD values for p45 and FL-74 in the second test. This supports the concept that boosting may induce increased levels of antibodies. However, increased levels of antibodies are not necessarily identical to protection. In view of the presence of domestic cats infected with FeLV, it might be useful to continue with the vaccination program in captive animals.",
