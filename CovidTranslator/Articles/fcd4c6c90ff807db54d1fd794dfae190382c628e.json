To evaluate the molecular mechanisms involved in the viral infection, in this study, we investigated the role of SARS-CoV Spike (S) protein in the regulation of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2). Expression of COX-2 stimulated by the S protein was verified by RT-PCR and western blot assay. To explore the relationship between S and COX-2, we constructed a series of plasmids containing truncated N-terminal fragments of the SARS-CoV S gene (designated from Sa to Si), which encoded truncated S proteins, and investigated whether these truncated proteins could induce effective expression of COX-2 in 293T cells. Our results showed that S d that encoded a truncated S protein with 422 aminoacid residues (from 1 to 422 aa), a part of 672 amino-acid S1 subunit is crucial for the induction of COX-2 expression. Immunofluorescence examinations also give the evidence that these N terminal 422 amino acids of the S protein were also required for the correct localization of the protein. We also compared S protein sequences of SARS-CoV isolated during the SARS break with that from palm civets, a possible source of SARS-CoV found in humans. S protein residues (344, 360), which mutated in the epitome from palm civet to human being were characterized in 3D modeling of 252-375 amino acid fragment.",

SARS-CoV is a member of the Coronaviridae family of enveloped, positive-stranded RNA viruses containing genes encoding polymerase (and polymerase-related proteins), spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M), and nuclearcapsid (N) proteins [2, 3] . Based on available information of other coronaviruses, the spike glycoprotein is the main virulence factor of SARS-CoV with multiple functions involved in specific receptor binding, cell membrane fusion, and protease susceptibility [4, 5] . Unlike many type I fusion proteins, including those of other coronaviruses, the S protein of SARS-CoV is not cleaved in the virus-producing cells [6] . However, two domains corresponding to the S1 and S2 proteins of processed coronaviruses can be defined [7] . The S1 domain mediates receptor association, whereas the S2 domain is membrane-associated and undergoes structural rearrangements that mediate membrane fusion. SARS disease clinically consists an incubation phase and respiratory phase. In these two phases, acute inflammatory reaction is the most obvious symptom [8] , characterized by the invasion of activated leukocytes into the injured tissue and its process is critically dependent upon the rapid expression of proinflammatory gene [9] .",

Two isoforms of COX were described, COX-1 and COX-2 [11] . COX-1 is constitutively expressed in almost all tissues [12] , while COX-2 is the inducible form of the enzyme, which is expressed in response to inflammatory and other physiological stimuli and growth factors and is involved in the production of those prostaglandins that mediate pain and support the inflammatory process [13] .

The phylogenetic study was conducted with the amino acid sequences of human SARS-CoV and palm civet SARS-CoV, whose sequence information were fully available in the public databases ( Table 2 ). The results showed that three amino acid residues in this fragment, residue 311, 344 or 360 were different between human SARS-CoV and palm civet SARS-CoV. In the transmission from animals to humans, G311 altered to R311, K344 altered to R344 and F360 altered to S360. It is interesting to see that all of the amino acid mutations in SARS-CoV S glycoprotein sequences between humans and civets are located in the S subunit (residue 270-375). The molecular models of S subunit (residue 270-375) obtained by comparing presented template model (Fig. 4 ). In this model, residue 344 and 360 were both located in a-helix and residue 311 was on random coil.",

The envelope protein Gp 120 of HIV also acts on the COX-2 through certain signaling pathway [22] . Spike is the largest gene encoding the SARS-CoV coat structural protein of 1255 amino acids with a molecular weight of 125-kDa. Our results reported in this study clearly demonstrated that the S protein of SARS-CoV could activate the expression of COX-2 protein and the activation was in a dose-dependent manner. It has been reported that hepatitis and AIDS patients showed a similar acute inflammatory syndrome [28] [29] [30] in clinic indicate robust expression of COX-2, thus raising the possibility that SARS-CoV may contribute to inflammation through induction of COX-2. Accordingly, it is worthwhile to speculate that the induction of COX-2 by the S protein may be the cause or consequence of pulmonary inflammation and immune hyperactivity in SARS patients. It has been suggested that different regions of spike protein carry various functions [31, 32] . Spike protein of SARS-CoV consists of two domains, S1 and S2. The S1 domain mediates the initial high affinity interaction with the cellular receptor and the S2 domain is responsible for the burden fusion and other important tasks. In this study, we examined the functions of different domains of the S protein in the regulation of COX-2 and the localization of S protein. Our results indicated that S 1-422 domain was required for the fully function of S protein in terms of activation of COX-2 gene. Results also showed that S 1-422 domain of SARS-CoV S protein was essential for localization of the protein on a membrane, most likely the cellular membrane. Since correct localization of membrane protein is required for proper function, including regulation of signaling pathways, therefore the observation that the S 1-422 domain was required for the activation of COX-2 may be due to the correct localization of the protein.",

In this report, we found that three amino acid residues: 311, 344, 360 are critical to the SARS-CoV transmission from palm civet to humans. Interestingly, a lysine at position 344 and a phenylalanine at position 360 are absolutely conserved in all of the more than 100 S protein isolated during the severe 2002-2003 outbreak. In contrast, the S protein of viruses isolated from humans during the less severe 2003-2004 outbreak had an arginine at position 344 and a serine at position 360. In 3D protein structure, these two residues located in a-helix, which suggested that mutation in these residues may change the structure of protein. A previous study reported that changing in 344 and 360 residues cannot change the affinity of SARS-CoV with cells, and our data showed that these two residues were on the fragment that is critical to the induction of COX-2 expression and the localization of Spike protein in cells, we proposed that 344 and 360 residues are an important determinant in the imflammation of SARS-CoV and in the transmission from palm civet to human.",
