            "text": "The polypeptide profile of the cell-adapted strain of bovine coronavirus (Mebus BCV-L 9) is remarkably affected by the host cell and trypsin. We compared the structural proteins of virus purified from different cell lines and found cell-dependent differences in the virus structure. BCV was purified from four clones of human rectal tumour cells (HRT-18): 3 F3, D 2, 3 E 3, and 4 B 3. The structural profiles of BCV propagated in clones 3 E 3 and 3 F 3 were identical, consisting of proteins with molecular weights of 185, 160, 140, 125, 110, 100, 52, 46, 37, 31 -34, and 2 6 -2 8 kilodaltons (kd). BCV purified from clone D2 lacked the 100 kd species, and clone 4 B 3 yielded virus lacking the 46 kd protein. We compared the structures of BCV propagated in HRT-18 cells [BCV(HRT-18)] and virus raised in bovine fetal spleen cells [BCV(D 2 BFS)]. The concentration of the 185 kd protein was higher in BCV (D 2BFS), and it also contained a 200 kd species. Protein profiles of in vitro trypsin treated and untreated BCV(HRT-18) differed only under reducing conditions, suggesting that trypsin cleavage sites are located within disulfide-linked regions of affected proteins. Propagation of BCV in D 2 BFS cells in the presence of trypsin resulted in cleavage of the 185kd protein and a concommitant increase of the 100kd protein. Activation of the fusion function probably depends on this cleavage process because fusion of BCV-infected D 2 BFS cells is trypsin dependent.",

            "text": "Proteolytic cleavage of inactive precursor polypeptides of assembled virions into an active form is necessary for inducing the infectivity of a number of viruses. Notably, orthomyxoviruses and paramyxoviruses require cleavage of envelope proteins for the viruses to become infectious. Processing of the viral proteins is accomplished either by cellular proteases or by exogenous proteases such as trypsin [2, 3, 7, 9, 10, 11, 18, 19] . Such findings are emerging for coronaviruses as well. Frana et al. [6] found that processing of the 180kd glycoprotein of mouse hepatitis virus strain A 59 (MHV-A 59) was host celldependent and affected the functional capacity of the virus. Those cells which fully cleaved the 180 kd protein to its 90 kd subunits activated rapid cell fusion. Cells which cleaved the protein incompletely required trypsin to activate rapid cell fusion.",

The dense and light forms of the virus had densities of 1.255 and 1.233 g/cm 3, respectively.

The profiles were examined under reducing and non-reducing conditions to reveal the effect of the enzyme on the viral polypeptides.

Electrophoretic transfer was carried out for 18 to 20h at 35volts at 10 to 15\u00b0C. Transferred proteins were stained with Ponceau S [17] , and molecular weight markers were cut off and saved for use in determining molecular weights of viral proteins. Transferred viral proteins were localized by incubating bovine anticoronavirus serum with blotted nitrocellulose membranes for 16 to 18h. Goat antibovine IgG (H + L chain) peroxidase conjugate (Kirkegaard and Perry Laboratories) was used. Membranes were developed by reacting with substrate consisting of 15mg 4-chloro 1naphthol dissolved in 5 ml methanol, followed by addition of 25 ml 0.05 M Tris pH 6.8, and 12 gl H202.",

Notably, the 185kd protein was present in high concentration in virus propagated in D2BFS cells, but it was present in low concentration in virus obtained from HRT-18 parent cells and clones. These findings are in agreement with those of Deregt et al. [5] who reported that gp 190 was present in low concentration in the Quebec BCV isolate propagated in Madin-Darby bovine kidney cells. A 100-110 kd doublet band was detected in BCV propagated in clones 3F3, 3E3, and 4B3, but only the 100 kd species was evident in BCV from clone D2. This difference may reflect a variation in processing or in glycosylation of the protein. Other investigators reported that HRT-18-propagated BCV (Mebus strain) contains predominantly 120 and 100kd proteins which are cleaved forms of gp 190 [8, 12] . Our demonstration of a doublet band of 100l l0kd concurs with the results of Deregt et al. [5] . These scientists reported that cleavage of gp 190 yields two comigrating gp 100 species. Glycoprotein staining of these blots using concanavalin A and peroxidase [4] indicated that the 100 kd protein was glycosylated. A 46 kd protein reacting with antibody was evident in virus raised in all cell lines except clone 4B3 and D2BFS. It was not detected in Western blots of uninfected cells. Silver-stained gels revealed that the 140 and 100 kd proteins, present under non-reducing conditions, disappeared under reducing conditions. At the same time, proteins of 95 kd and 65 kd appeared in the presence of a reducing agent. Similar findings were reported by Deregt et al. [5] . Hogue and coworkers [-7] found that the 140 kd species consists of disulfide-linked subunits of 65 kd, but they did not observe a change in the electrophoretic migration of the 100kd species under reducing conditions. The 18, 20, and 23 kd group of proteins was converted to a 20-23 kd cluster by reduction. Western blotting also revealed a change in the electrophoretic mobility of the 185 kd to a 190 kd protein under reducing conditions. Rather than consisting of disulfide-linked subunits, the 185 and 100 kd molecules and the 18-23 kd group of proteins possibly contain intrachain disulfide bonding. Reduction could alter the migration pattern of the proteins by breaking the intrachain bonds under this assumption.",
