            "text": "Diarrhea outbreaks in pig farms have raised major concerns in Europe and USA, as they can lead to dramatic pig losses. During a suspected outbreak in Belgium of porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), we performed viral metagenomics to assess other potential viral pathogens. Although PEDV was detected, its low abundance indicated that other viruses were involved in the outbreak. Interestingly, a porcine bocavirus and several enteroviruses were most abundant in the sample. We also observed the presence of a porcine enterovirus genome with a gene insertion, resembling a C28 peptidase gene found in toroviruses, which was confirmed using re-sequencing, bioinformatics, and proteomics approaches. Moreover, the predicted cleavage sites for the insertion suggest that this gene was being expressed as a single protein, rather than a fused protein. Recombination in enteroviruses has been reported as a major mechanism to generate genetic diversity, but gene insertions across viral families are rather uncommon. Although such inter-family recombinations are rare, our finding suggests that these events may significantly contribute to viral evolution.",

            "text": "Diarrhea is an important health problem affecting piglets, as well as an important cause of production losses in fattening pigs. Typical causes of clinical and subclinical enteric problems in the latter age group are bacteria such as Brachyspira spp., Lawsonia intracellularis and/or Salmonella spp., whereas viral causes at this age are generally less common (St\u00e5 hl et al. 2011; Collins and Barchia 2014; De Ridder et al. 2014) . In a minority of cases, fattening pigs and sows can be affected by porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), a re-emerging enteric coronavirus (Stevenson et al. 2013; Pensaert and Martelli 2016) . Classical diagnostic methods such as specific antigen-, gene-, or antibodydetection assays are currently in use in veterinary practice in order to reach an etiological diagnosis and to put into practice targeted prophylactic and therapeutic measures. However, in recent years, a considerable progress has been made in the field of viral metagenomics, which makes it more affordable to apply next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies to analyze the entire fecal viral content (the fecal virome) of a sample. Using this approach, the most frequently detected mammalian viruses in viral metagenomics studies were kobuviruses, rotaviruses, pig stool-associated ssDNA viruses, astroviruses, sapoviruses, and enteroviruses (Shan et al. 2011; Sachsenr\u00f6 der et al. 2012; Zhang et al. 2013) .",

            "text": "In January 2015, a case of diarrhea in fattening pigs occurred on a Belgian pig farm. Diarrhea emerged 2 days upon arrival after transport and clinical signs in the herd (1,000 fattening pigs) lasted for 21 days, affecting a total of 20 fattening pigs. The veterinarian suspected an infection with the re-emerging PEDV. This virus belongs to the genus Alphacoronavirus within the family of Coronaviridae. The virus replicates in enterocytes and leads to sloughing of the gut villi, which causes diarrhea. It was widely spread across Europe between the 1970s and 1990s, causing epidemics of diarrhea on pig farms. However, since then it has only sporadically been detected (Pensaert and de Bouck 1978) . In 2010, this virus was detected during severe outbreaks in Asia, and for the first time in the US swine population during spring 2013, causing mortality and severe economic losses (Song et al. 2015) . In 2014, a milder variant of the virus (OH 855) was detected in the US swine herds (Wang et al. 2014 ). These strains were later also detected in German swineherds in 2014, as well as in other European countries (Grasland et al. 2015; Mesquita et al. 2015; Stadler et al. 2015) . However, it is unclear if these genomic changes are correlating with an increased virulence of PEDV (Pensaert and Martelli 2016) . At the beginning of 2015 and following the outbreaks of PEDV in USA, there was an increased awareness in Europe, including Belgium, as this virus could also emerge in the local swine population at any given moment. Therefore, when the outbreak of diarrhea occurred on the above-mentioned farm, a mixed fecal sample (n \u00bc 12 pigs) was sent to the Laboratory of Virology at Ghent University. PEDV RNA was detected using an in-house RT-qPCR, but high Cq values (Cq > 30) suggested a rather low viral load, whereas typical clinical infections in gnotobiotic piglets results in shedding of the virus at loads >10 10 copies per milliliter of feces (Jung et al. 2014 ). Still, a full genome characterization was performed and this indicated that the strain was genetically highly similar to the INDEL strains circulating in Germany and USA, as reported elsewhere (Theuns et al. 2015) . Given the low abundance of PEDV in the fecal sample, and the large number of other viruses which can also cause gastro-intestinal disease in pigs, it was questioned in the present study if other viruses might have been present in the pig's fecal virome and if they could have contributed to the emergence of diarrhea on this farm.",

Then the separated peptides were analyzed in the Orbitrap QE operated in positive ion mode (nanospray voltage 1.5 kV, source temperature 250 C). The instrument was first operated in data-dependent acquisition (DDA) mode on the pool of synthetic peptides ordered (PEPotec SRM Custom Peptide Libraries, Thermo Scientific) and an inclusion list based on the m/z and RT of the synthetic peptides detected was created (Supplementary Tables S1 and S2 ). For DDA, MS scans were performed at a resolution of 70,000 fwhm for the mass range of m/z 400-1,600 for precursor ions, followed by MS/ MS scans of the top 10 most intense peaks with \u00fe2, \u00fe 3, and \u00fe4 charged ions above a threshold ion count of 16,000 at 35,000 of resolution. MS/MS was performed using normalized collision energy (NCE) of 25% with an isolation window of 3.0 m/z, an apex trigger 5-15 s, and a dynamic exclusion of 10 s. Data were acquired with Xcalibur 2.2 software (Thermo Scientific). Then the sample and synthetic peptides were re-ran in MRM/MSMS mode (Supplementary Table S2 ).",

Using an in house RT-qPCR assay, a low viral load of PEDV was detected, indicating that other viruses may have played a more important role in the pathogenesis of diarrhea in these pigs. Therefore, it was aimed to unravel the complete fecal virome of this pooled sample using an NGS approach. After trimming, a total of 57,164,223 NGS reads were assembled de novo into contigs (Bankevich et al. 2012; Bolger et al. 2014) . A total of 38,118,443 reads were assigned with DIAMOND (Buchfink et al. 2015) , of which 5,937,747 were assigned as viruses (16%). From these reads, 2,454,031 could be assigned to the order of the Caudovirales (41%) and 537,279 (9%) to the family Microviridae, which both contain exclusively bacteriophages. Only 2,780 NGS reads (0.1%) were obtained for PEDV, which corroborates the low viral load (Cq > 30) found by RT-qPCR. A total of 2,246,215 reads could be attributed to (near) complete mammalian porcine virus genomes (Table 2) . Of these, reads matching the porcine bocavirus (2,110,362 reads, 34%) were far most dominant, followed by 63,317 reads matching porcine enteroviruses. All viruses described hereafter were deposited in GenBank and accession numbers are provided in Table 2 .",

Interestingly, a contig of 8,043 nt in length was identified and assigned to enterovirus, with a partial in-frame torovirus-like gene insertion. Remapping of curated reads against this recombinant sequence using BWA (Li and Durbin 2009 ) as well as resequencing the insertion and breakpoints using Sanger sequencing on the original sample, confirmed that the obtained sequence was genuine and neither an artifact of the de novo assembly nor a result of random amplification. In Fig. 1B , a description of the genome organization of this novel recombinant enterovirus genome (Porcine enterovirus b 15V010/BEL/2015) is shown. As depicted in Fig. 1B , the torovirus-like gene insertion of 636 nt was present between the enterovirus 2 C and 3 A non-structural proteins. The inserted region formed a phylogenetic outgroup most closely related to several toroviruses. In the sample, we observed the presence of a small Torovirus contig of 256 bp, which was included in the phylogenetic tree (Fig. 1A , Torovirus/BEL/2015), showing very low similarity with the gene insertion found in the recombinant virus. Initial BLASTp searches attributed the highest aa similarity of this torovirus-like insertion to a porcine torovirus (66% aa similarity with NC_022787), but with the most recent reports of 2 similar recombinant viruses, it now shares 92.0% aa identity with the insertion of the recombinant enterovirus G from North Carolina (08/NC_USA/2015) (Shang et al. 2017 ) and 90.7% aa identity with the strain from Texas (EVG/Porcine/USA/Texas1/ 2014) (Knutson et al. 2017) . To infer whether the insertion was produced as a separate moiety or fused with the upstream or downstream enterovirus protein, we identified potential polyprotein cleavage sites, which were present up-and downstream of the insertion (Fig. 1B) . Pfam searches for motifs using hidden Markov models, revealed that the insertion seems to enclose an L-protease from the C28 family (e-value \u00bc 1.3e \u00c005 ). We also attempted to infer the function of the insertion using Phyre2 (Kelley et al. 2015) , which predicted a cysteine proteinase function (99.1% confidence, Fig. 1E ). The same function was also predicted for the FMDV L pro , but not for the porcine torovirus that showed the highest sequence homology with the insertion (Fig. 1E) .",

Picobirnaviruses are bisegmented double-stranded RNA viruses, belonging to the Picobirnaviridae family. Segment 1 encodes for a capsid protein and ORF1 with unknown function, while segment 2 encodes for the RdRp gene (Ganesh et al. 2012) . Up to date, only seven complete sequences for porcine picobirnaviruses are available in (Fig. 3B) . Figure 3B shows the genome organization of the novel gemycircularvirus and the phylogenetic analysis of known gemycircularviruses based on the amino acid level of the Rep gene. The porcine gemycircularvirus BEL15V015 presented the typical nonanucleotide stem loop motif (TATAAATAG) and rolling circle replication motifs I (LFTYS), II (HLHVFAD), III (YATKD), GRS (RKFDVEGFHPNIVPSL) and helicase motifs Walker-A (GRSRTGKT) and Walker-B (VFDDI). The novel porcine gemycircularvirus replicase shares its highest similarity on the amino-acid level (76%) with Mongoose fecesassociated gemycircularvirus b (Concei\u00e7\u00e3o-Neto et al. 2015) (Fig. 3B) . The divergent ssDNA circular virus (Fig. 3C ) encodes for two ORFs, bidirectionally transcribed: porcine stool associated circular virus BEL/15V010. The complete genome of the virus identified showed its highest similarity with porcine stool associated circular virus 5 isolate CP3 (82.9% nt). Interestingly, the capsid gene of the virus shows 91.3% nt similarity with isolate CP3 but only 65.2% similarity with the replicase. However, these two viruses did not cluster closely with other circular single-stranded DNA viruses and seem to belong to a new isolated clade (Fig. 3C) (Cheung et al. 2014) . Even though only two viruses from this clade were described so far, both were isolated from diarrheic porcine feces.",

In fact, NGS forms a powerful tool for diagnostics. Its application will lead to a better identification of viral enteric disease complexes and will allow investigating the relevance of coinfections of different enteric viruses, which may have remained unnoticed using traditional diagnostic techniques.

            "text": "Here, an outbreak of diarrhea in a Belgian pig farm was reported, 2 days after the arrival of new pigs, suggesting that these novel pigs were the source of infection. Since PEDV was being reported in Europe at the time, it was first diagnostically tested for. Even though the sample was positive for PEDV (RT-qPCR), the viral loads were rather low (Cq > 30). Our study does not provide evidence for direct causality of disease by a single viral agent, and the high number of viral reads attributed to a porcine bocavirus, the presence of other possible causative agents of diarrhea such as astroviruses, enteroviruses, and picobirnaviruses, merely indicate that more work needs to be performed to elucidate the role of coinfections in gastrointestinal disease. Moreover, none of these viral species are routinely tested for at diagnostic laboratories in cases of diarrhea on pig farms. Alongside these findings, an enterovirus with an insertion of a torovirus was described. Due to the large number of viral reads attributed to bocavirus and the enterovirus-torovirus recombinant, we attempted to isolate them using primary porcine kidney epithelial cells and ST (swine testis) cells (data not shown). Although CPE was observed 2 days after inoculation on porcine kidney epithelial cells, neither bocavirus nor the enterovirus-torovirus recombinant could be detected using PCR assays on any of the passaged cells. This is in contrast with the recently described recombinant virus from North Carolina, USA, where Shang et al. (2017) could isolate the virus using the ST cell line. We speculate that due to the large amount of additional non-recombinant enteroviruses in the sample, this might have put the recombinant enterovirus in an in vitro disadvantage. Using, Pfam and Hmmer searches for motifs, the insertion was predicted to enclose an L-protease from the C28 family. This protein has been best studied for foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV), a member of the Picornaviridae and is known to cleave host cell proteins, namely the p220 subunit of eukaryotic initiation factor 4 F (eIF-4 F). The cleavage of this initiation factor 4 F results in the shutoff of cap-dependent host cell protein synthesis, without affecting viral protein synthesis which can occur in the presence of cleaved p220 (Piccone et al. 1995) . Moreover, our structural analysis confirmed that the function prediction from the structure was a cysteine proteinase (for both our insertion and L pro of FMDV), even though their relatedness in sequence identity is low (Fig. 1E ). Structure prediction is often important to determine function when sequence similarities are lower. The predicted cleavage sites for the virus could be identified, suggesting that the inserted gene is producing a separate protein. Even though a small contig of 256 bp of Torovirus from the same insertion region could be detected in our pooled fecal sample, it clustered very distantly from the gene inserted (Fig. 1A) . Since the fecal sample resulted of a pool of 12 pig feces, this is not surprising and likely has a different host origin. In addition to confirming the presence of the enterovirus-torovirus recombinant using Sanger sequencing, we used proteomics to infer whether the protein of the insertion could be found in the sample. This is specially challenging since fecal samples are a very complex matrix. In addition, the torovirus insertion codes for a non-structural protein, which are only present inside infected cells, which might explain why only a few of the predicted peptides could be identified. In recent years, the field of proteomics has evolved greatly, in fact, SRM has proven to be a powerful technique to detect and quantify proteins (Picotti and Aebersold 2012) . This is especially suitable for detecting low abundant peptides, since the mass spectrometer focuses on detecting a preselected group of peptides. Taking the metagenomics data, the Sanger sequence confirmation and the proteomics results all together we can conclude that this recombinant virus is present in the sample and that the inserted protein is being expressed. Interestingly, two recent studies described porcine enteroviruses with a similar insertion (Fig. 1A) (Knutson et al. 2017; Shang et al. 2017 ). One of these viruses was isolated and a knockout mutant virus without the insertion yielded impaired growth and higher expression levels of innate immune genes in infected cells (Shang et al. 2017 ). Our analyses suggests that these viruses have a common ancestor (Knutson et al. 2017) even though a significant diversity was noted among them (>90% aa identity) (Fig. 1A) . Moreover, the fact that our strain before the insertion clusters with the virus isolated in Texas and after the insertion with the virus isolated from both Texas and North Carolina, can hint that an additional recombination occurred after the insertion event. Even though our recombinant strain is the first reported in Europe, it is very likely that such viruses might be more widely spread in the pig population, as the in vitro experiments of Shang et al. (2017) indicate that the virus might induce higher pathogenesis.",

            "text": "Not unexpectedly, a great number of other eukaryotic viruses were identified using viral metagenomics. However, even though the pathogenic role of PEDV has been well demonstrated, for other viruses this link is less clear. For instance, the novel porcine circular virus described in this study is highly similar to another virus also identified in diarrheic pigs (Cheung et al. 2014) . Therefore, it still remains a possibility that these viruses infect pigs and might play a role in diarrhea, which needs further elucidation. Gemycircularviruses, on the other hand, have been identified in a great variety of hosts, and no link with diarrhea has been yet demonstrated. It is likely that these viruses have a diet or plant origin, especially because the virus found in the pig sample clusters together with two gemycircularviruses found in the feces of a healthy mongoose (Concei\u00e7\u00e3o-Neto et al. 2015) . As for the picobirnaviruses, in animals they have been identified in diarrheic and non-diarrheic samples (Ganesh et al. 2014) . The main issue with segmented viruses is to link the different segments to the same virus. In our case, we identified four capsid and three RdRp genes, and further research is needed to link the different segments to their respective RdRp. As capsid segments are more divergent than RdRp, it is unexpected that more capsid than RdRp segments were identified. However, it cannot be excluded that there were more picobirnaviruses present in the pool and/or a reassortment event occurred, as previously described (Concei\u00e7\u00e3o-Neto et al. 2016) .",

In fact, it is important to consider the possibility of diarrhea as a result of the replication of a viral intestinal disease complex, where more than one agent might play a role. Given the availability and democratization of next-and third-generation sequencing technologies, this will certainly change the way diagnostics are being performed in the coming decades. However, one should bear in mind that the abundance of information generated with these methods is not easy to interpret and appropriate tools should be developed to help farmers and the pig industry in translating this information into useful management information.",
