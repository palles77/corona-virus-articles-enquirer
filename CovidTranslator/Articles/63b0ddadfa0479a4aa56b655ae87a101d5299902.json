            "text": "Over the past 3 decades, and similar to the horse industry, fresh embryo transfer has been widely practiced on large commercial scales in different camelid species, especially the dromedary camel and alpaca. However, the inability to cryopreserve embryos significantly reduces its broader application, and as such limits the capacity to utilize elite genetic resources internationally. In addition, cryopreservation of the semen of camelids is also difficult, suggesting an extreme sensitivity of the germplasm to cooling and freezing. As a result, genetic resources of camelids must continue to be maintained as living collections of animals. Due to concerns over disease outbreaks such as that of the highly pathogenic Middle East Respiratory Syndrome in the Middle East and Asia, there is an urgent need to establish an effective gene banking system for camelid species, especially the camel. The current review compares and summarizes recent progress in the field of camelid embryo cryopreservation, identifying four possible reasons for the slow development of an effective protocol and describing eight future directions to improve the current protocols. At the same time, the results of a recent dromedary camel embryo transfer study which produced a high morphologic integrity and survival rate of Open Pulled Straw-vitrified embryos are also discussed.",

They are seasonal breeders, the females only ovulate postmating (referred to as induced ovulators), and males produce viscous semen.

            "text": "The reproductive efficiency of camelids is low partly due to the late onset of puberty, the short breeding season, early embryonic loss, and a long gestation period of 13 months. Accordingly, assisted reproduction technologies, such as fresh embryo transfer (ET), have been widely practiced in dromedary camel breeding programs in Middle Eastern countries [7] , and in alpaca and llama programs mainly in Australia and South America [8, 9] . However, frozen embryos are not used in those commercial operations due to an unacceptably low pregnancy rate [1, 10] . The ability to successfully cryopreserve embryos could overcome the spatial and temporal barriers between recipient and donor, and subsequently offer considerable logistical and economic advantage. This is especially important for camelids because recipients need to have certain sized follicles (growing follicles) to be ovulated with the treatment of hormones, and this requires a large pool of females from which to select appropriate recipients [11] . In addition, embryo cryopreservation provides an effective means of preserving endangered camelids, such as the vicuna and guanaco. Furthermore, a successful cryopreservation technology would promote the application of other embryo biotechnologies, such as cloning and transgenics, on large commercial scales [12] . Thus, there is a need to compare and summarize recent progress in the field of embryo cryopreservation for camelids to provide researchers with new insight into designing experiments that will lead to more effective cryopreservation protocols for use in ET programs to facilitate a wider application.",

In the current ET practice with dromedary camels, example, hatched embryos are preferably collected on Days 7, 8, or 9 after ovulation with the intention of enhancing the recovery rate. Therefore, the protocols developed for nonhatched embryos in other species are unsuitable for freezing camelid hatched embryos. II. A much larger variation in embryo size: Embryo size not only differs between donors on Days 6, 7, and 8 but it can also vary substantially between embryos harvested from one animal. Thus, there is a challenge to develop protocols that fit different-sized embryos [27] . III. A great amount of lipids in embryos: Similar to porcine embryos, camelid embryos contain a high concentration of lipidsdthis has been shown to have an adverse effect on conventional freezing methods [28, 29] . IV. The lack of a convenient and reliable evaluation system for embryo quality: The morphologic appearance of cryopreserved embryos does not always correlate to their developmental potential, and so, it is insufficient to assess the outcome of the cryopreservation and to predict ET success [27] .",

Briefly, the results of those works have shown that camel embryos are sensitive to PROH, DMSO, and glycerol but tolerant to EG [18] . Subsequent studies were performed to determine the minimum exposure time to 1.5-M EG required to achieve cryoprotection and to compare different methods of rehydration with or without sucrose. The highest pregnancy rate (37%) was achieved when the embryos were exposed to EG for 10 minutes, cooled slowly at a rate of \u00c00.5 C/min to \u00c033 C before plunging into liquid nitrogen, and then thawed and rehydrated in 0.2-M sucrose in holding media for 5 minutes [18] . In comparison to vitrification, the relatively higher pregnancy rate from slow-frozen embryos may be due to more intact cytoskeleton integrity. Cell death associated with slow freezing was comparable to that of unfrozen control cells, but freezing caused widespread disruption of the actin cytoskeleton, indicating that levels of cell death in an embryo may not be as critical as cytoskeleton integrity for embryo survival and implantation. It appears that slow freezing maintains better cytoskeleton integrity of embryos compared with vitrification [36] .",

After a thorough examination of different parameters, an optimized protocol (7.5% EG \u00fe 0.25 M sucrose for 1 minute, a second equilibration solution 15% EG \u00fe 0.5 M sucrose for 2 minutes, followed by two drops of 30% EG \u00fe 1 M sucrose vitrification solution for 20 seconds each) was established [27] . Unfortunately, despite a high survival rate (91%) as judged by the morphologic appearance of embryos after warming and in culture, the transfer of 18 vitrified embryos (Day 7 or 8) into six recipients (three each) during the breeding season resulted in no pregnancy (unpublished data). In a subsequent experiment, 10 vitrified embryos were transferred into five recipients (two each), who had received 75 mg progesterone-in-oil (intramuscularly) for 3 days before transfer and for another 14 days after transfer when the pregnancy could be identified by ultrasonography. This exogenous progesterone was injected in case the frozen/thawed embryos did not produce enough maternal recognition of pregnancy signal to maintain the CL and prevent luteolysis. However, there was still no pregnancies, apparently indicating a total lack of developmental competence of those vitrified embryos (unpublished data). The frustrating results of these transfers imply that the current protocol still needs further modification, and importantly, that the morphological integrity of frozen embryos cannot be used to predict the success of ET outcome [27] .",

Therefore, it is reasonable to speculate that removal of lipids from embryos before cryopreservation may be vital not only for survival but most importantly to retain developmental competence [29] .",

            "text": "I. Cytoskeleton stabilization: Cytoskeleton-stabilizing agents, such as the cytochalasins (cyto-b), have been used in pig embryo vitrification to prevent cytoskeletal disruption during and after cryopreservation. The landmark success of live piglet production from embryos frozen by stabilized vitrification shows the importance of the cytoskeleton structure for retaining developmental competence of embryos [29] . However, the effect of cyto-b on the outcome of vitrification appears to be dependent on the developmental stage of embryos (e.g., hatched embryos in pig), with a narrow size range (e.g., 325-375 mm). This feature may limit its broader application in vitrification, but it can be circumvented by culturing early stage embryos in vitro to meet these requirements [29] . In a preliminary experiment, Day 7 camel embryos (n \u00bc 36) were recovered and cultured with or without pretreatment with 7.5-mg/mL cyto-b. Eleven embryos were vitrified after cyto-b treatment (French straw method, [10] ), and 16 embryos were not frozen but used to determine if prefreezing treatment alone caused cell damage. Without freezing, cyto-b did not affect cell viability as 12/16 (75%) transferred embryos resulted in pregnancies. However, after cryopreservation, 0/11 (0%) embryos pretreated with cyto-b and 3/9 (33%) without cyto-b pretreatment resulted in a pregnancy (unpublished data). It is obvious that cyto-b treatment does not have any lasting detrimental effects on embryo developmental competence, but that the treatment also does not provide protection for the embryo cytoskeleton during vitrification. A similar effect of cyto-b treatment on embryos has also been observed in an equine study [40] . II. Development of modified carrier tools: Carrier tools that are better adapted to the larger size and special structure of zona-free camel embryos may improve results. Although a direct comparison of OPS straws versus 0.25 mL French straws was not carried out [10] , it appears that a relatively larger vitrification volume is beneficial for embryo survival (Vajta G, personal communication). III. Delipidation: Removal of intracellular lipids by centrifugation and subsequent micromanipulation has been shown to be effective in the vitrification of pig morulae and early blastocysts [29] . When undertaking ET of camelids, for example, in dromedary camels, the uterus is flushed 7 to 8 days after mating to enhance the recovery rate; however, embryos are hatched at this stage. Without the protection of the zonae pellucidae, it would be difficult to centrifuge hatched blastocysts and to perform delipation. But it may be possible to collect expanded blastocysts from Day 6 donors, with two flushes at intervals of 12 hours. Collection and cryopreservation of unhatched embryos will have to be established if international exportation and transportation is intended, as current regulations allow only pathogen-free embryos with an intact zona pellucida to be exported [41] . IV. Embryo size: To overcome the problems associated with the large variation of embryo size from superovulated donors, the selection of a superovulation protocol appears to be an option for producing uniform embryos. For example, superovulation of dromedary camels with two injections of FSH dissolved in hyaluronan solution produces more similar sized embryos compared to other protocols [42] . V. A novel nonpenetrating CPA, carboxylated \u03b5-poly-L-Lysin (PLL): A Japanese group has recently reported that the addition of PLL in vitrification solutions significantly improved the survival rate of mouse oocytes and embryos [43] . Unfortunately, this product is not commercially available. The authors are currently collaborating with this group to see if PLL can improve the survival rate of dromedary camel embryos after freezing. VI. Automation of freezing procedures: Inconsistencies in the manual handling of samples and differences between individual embryologists can only be eliminated by full automation of the established proceduredan unavoidable task of the next decade applicable to cryopreservation for all species including humans, and for all procedures in assisted reproduction [44] . VII. Synchrony between donor and recipient: Apart from the quality of embryos, the optimal pregnancy rates of ET may depend on various other factors, such as the preparation of the recipient females. The degree of ovulation synchrony between donor and recipient appears to be of paramount importance for the success of an ET program. In the dromedary camel, for example, the pregnancy rate was highest (67%) when embryos were transferred into the recipients that had ovulated 24 hours after the donor, whereas the pregnancy rates dropped sharply to less than 10% if embryos were transferred to the recipients that had ovulated 72 hours behind the donor [45] .",

Inhibition of luoteolysis in recipient females: Due to the lack of the cyclical CL and a relatively short luteal lifespan of only 8-10 days in camelids, prolongation of the lifespan of the CL appears to be beneficial for establishing pregnancy by allowing more time for the embryos to secrete the important maternal recognition of pregnancy signal to the mother. The oral administration of the prostaglandin synthetase inhibitor, meclofenamic acid, can prevent both the luteolytic action of exogenous PGF2a and the normal increase in periphereal plasma PMSG concentrations in late diestrus, thereby prolonging the luteal phase and improving the pregnancy rate of ET [46] .",
