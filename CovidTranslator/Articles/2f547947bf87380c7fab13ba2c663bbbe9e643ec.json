With no antiviral drugs nor vaccines, and the presence of carriers without obvious symptoms, traditional public health intervention measures are significantly less effective. Here, we report the epidemiological and virological characteristics of the COVID-19 outbreak. Originated in bats, 2019-nCoV/ severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV)-2 likely experienced adaptive evolution in intermediate hosts before transfer to humans at a concentrated source of transmission. Similarities of receptor sequence binding to 2019-nCoV between humans and animals suggest a low species barrier for transmission of the virus to farm animals. We propose, based on the One Health model, that veterinarians and animal specialists should be involved in a cross-disciplinary collaboration in the fight against this epidemic.",

Several of the initial patients visited a wet seafood market where other wildlife species were also sold. Subsequent virus isolation from human patients and molecular analysis showed that the pathogen was a new coronavirus (CoV), first named 2019-nCoV, and subsequently this disease was renamed by WHO as COVID-19. A study group of the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV) proposed the name SARS-CoV-2, but this name remains to be officially approved [1] . This new CoV is now the seventh member of the Coronaviridae known to infect humans. With the explosive increase of confirmed cases, the WHO declared this outbreak a public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC) on January 30, 2020.",

Many CoVs cause intestinal and respiratory infections in animals and in humans [2] [3] [4] [5] . CoV came into the spotlight in 2002-2003, when clusters of 'atypical pneumonia' were first reported in Guangdong Province, subsequently spreading to Hong Kong. Researchers in Hong Kong isolated a novel CoV virus (SARS-CoV) and the disease was later renamed severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) (see Glossary). Because of international travel, the virus spread from Hong Kong to the rest of the world and more than 8000 people in 26 countries became infected, with a case fatality rate of approximately 10% (https://www.who.int/csr/sars/country/table2004_04_21/en/). SARS posed a serious public health threat to the world at that time, with a significant negative impact on the economy in affected areas. Subsequent studies found that SARS-CoV originated from bats and interspecies transmission to humans took place via an intermediate host: Himalayan palm civets (Paguma larvata) or raccoon dogs (Nyctereutes procyonoides) [5] [6] [7] . Another well-known CoV of animal origin is Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), which has an even higher case fatality rate, but it is rarely transmitted between humans.",

The R 0 of SARS-CoV in the absence of interventions was 2.3-3.7 [22, 23] . Breban et al. estimated MERS-CoV R 0 to be 0.50-0.92 by analysis of 55 of the first 64 laboratory-confirmed cases [24] . With the implementation of rapid diagnosis, coupled with effective isolation of patients, the R 0 of SARS-CoV dropped to less than 1, explaining why the SARS-CoV outbreak could eventually be controlled [25] [26] [27] . However, it is worth noting that R 0 estimates may vary upon numerous biologic, socio-behavioral, and environmental factors, and must be interpreted with caution [28] .",

The overall clinical characteristics of COVID-19 were also influenced by the different phases of this epidemic [12, 13, 21, 29, 33] . Patients in the first and second phase of the epidemic were older, more likely to be male, and likely to have exposure to the seafood market. Clinically, they had more bilateral patchy shadows, or ground glass opacity in the lungs [13, 21, 29, [33] [34] [35] [36] . In addition, the mortality rate of the first and second phases of the epidemic was 4.3-15% and thus significantly higher than the 1.36% determined for the later phase of the epidemic [13, 21, 29, 33, 34] . This higher mortality rate was either due to: (i) more people with underlying medical conditions, such as high blood pressure and diabetes [12, 13, 19, 20, 29, 31, 33] ;",

Importantly, 889 asymptomatic or subclinically symptomatic infected cases were reported [20, 37] . Asymptomatic infection was also documented in Germany: two asymptomatic patients' throat samples were tested positive by reverse transcription (RT)-PCR and by virus isolation, while both patients remained well and afebrile for 7 days [38] . Importantly, the asymptomatic manifestation jeopardizes the screening of infected people by temperature measurements or by overt signs and symptoms [12, 13, 19, 20, 29, 31, 33] . Virus infection is not selective in age, as it was reported even in a 1-month-old infant [20, 21, 37] . Of the 44 672 confirmed cases, 77.8% are between 30 and 69 years old and 51.4% are male [20] . Until now, there is no evidence for intrauterine infection by vertical transmission in women who developed COVID-19 during late pregnancy and no evidence that pregnant women are more susceptible compared with other adult patients [34, 39] . Although currently the number of new infections is decreasing, the COVID-19 epidemic is still ongoing. The order to Chinese citizens to return to work, which is accompanied by massive population movement, will likely increase the risk of transmission again. Overall, the current mortality rate of COVID-19 in China is 2.9% and in foreign countries 0.7%. The overall mortality rate remains the highest in Hubei (3.4%), 4.9 times higher than in other provinces (0.7%). For comparison, SARS-CoV exhibited a case fatality rate of 9.6% (774/8096) and MERS-CoV had a fatality rate of 34.4% (858/2494) (https://www.who.int/csr/sars/country/ table2004_04_21/en/; https://www.who.int/emergencies/mers-cov/en/). However, 2019-nCoV is more infectious than SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV [40, 41] .",

Trends in Molecular Medicine 1). Based on recombination analysis and phylogenetic trees (Figure 2A) , we found that 2019-nCoV shares a most recent common ancestor with BetaCoV/RaTG13/2013 (EPI_ISL_402131), because both viruses are in the same cluster. However, our results indicate that this cluster may be the result of convergent evolution or complex recombination events involving at least two virus species with differing evolutionary histories (Figure 2A ). The two external segments of this clustered viral genome, encompassing nucleotide (nt) 1 to nt 13 521, and nt 23 687 to nt 30 079, are similar to bat CoVs ZC45 and ZXC21. The first segment includes ORF1a and the second segment includes the C terminus of the S protein, ORF3, E, M, ORF6, ORF7a, ORF8, N, and ORF10 ( Figure 2A ). This finding is also supported by reconstructing maximum likelihood (ML) phylogenetic trees, which reveal that segments from nt 1 to nt 13 521 and from nt 23 687 to nt 30 079 are clustered with Sarbecovirus. However, based on the ML tree result, the middle segment from nt 13 522 to nt 23 686 of 2019-nCoV genome and RaTG13 does not cluster with Sarbecovirus. It forms a new branch in the phylogenetic tree, located between Sarbecovirus and an Unclassified CoV. In addition, a recent preliminary report showed that the receptorbinding motif (RBM) of these two genomes shares a very low sequence similarity [56] . This divergence indicates a possible alternative source for the RBM encoding sequence in 2019-nCoV, as suggested by other preliminary reports [52, 57] . Interestingly, Lam et al. found several putative pangolin CoV sequences with 85.5% to 92.4% similarity to 2019-nCoV [52] . Further preliminary studies showing the existence of multiple lineages of pangolin CoVs with genetic similarity to 2019-nCoV further support the hypothesis that pangolins served as a potential intermediate host [52, 58] . The currently available data do not fully elucidate if the virus was directly transmitted from bats to humans or indirectly through an intermediate host, nor do they currently rule out convergent evolution as an alternative hypothesis to recombination to explain the discordant phylogenetic trees. Consequentially, more sequence data are needed to confirm the specific source and origin of the 2019-nCoV, which can only be achieved by enhanced collection and monitoring of bat and other wild animal samples.",

The CTD is responsible for binding to the host receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) in the case of SARS-CoV and 2019-nCoV. The CTD contains two subdomains: a core structure (a five-stranded antiparallel \u03b2-sheet) and the actual RBM, which determines the receptor binding specificity. The recently released structure of the RBM ACE2 complex ( Figure 4A ) revealed that most S residues contacting ACE2 are identical between SARS-CoV and 2019-nCoV. However, some are unique, including an important salt bridge that involves different amino acids in ACE2 to bind S of SARS-CoV and 2019-nCoV. These slight differences might explain the more efficient binding of S from 2019-nCoV to ACE2, but this has not been observed in other preliminary studies [61, 62] .",

As a rule, furin cleaves S at a polybasic cleavage site (minimal motif R-X-X-R) during its biosynthesis in the trans-Golgi compartments or during virus entry in endosomes. Cleavage by trypsin and TMPRSS family members occurs at monobasic cleavage sites and likely takes place in the extracellular space and at the cell surface. Cathepsins, ubiquitous lysosomal enzymes with a rather broad substrate specificity, cleave S during virus entry [66] . For 2019-nCoV, it was shown that TMPRSS 2 primes S, the cathepsins B and L are only required in the absence of this protease [67] . Interestingly, S of 2019-nCoV has acquired a polybasic motif at the S1/S2 boundary, which is not present in S of the bat CoVs and SARS-CoV [68] .

What triggers the refolding of S is unclear; the low pH prevailing in the endosome during virus entry is only required to activate cathepsins and binding to the receptor causes only minor conformational changes, but might be required to expose a previously hidden proteolytic cleavage site. The structure of parts of the S2 subunit from SARS-CoV in the postfusion conformation ( Figure 3B ) revealed a six helix bundle between two heptad repeats (a motif of seven amino acids in which amino acid 1 and 4 are hydrophobic), which is a typical feature of class I fusion proteins, such as hemagglutinin (HA) of influenza virus and Gp160 of HIV. However, the six helix bundle formed by S is longer, indicating its formation released more energy that drives the fusion of two lipid bilayers [70, 71] .

The S binding site of ACE2 from macaque and chimpanzees is identical to human ACE2. ACE2 from other species revealed eleven (chicken), nine and ten (rodents), or only three (cat) amino acid differences compared with human ACE2. Of special interest are ACE2 proteins from farm animals and a pet cat, since they might become another possible reservoir for 2019-nCoV. ACE2 from pig contains six exchanges, but they are mostly located at the periphery of the binding site ( Figure 4B ). N90T causes the loss of the glycosylation site. E329 forms a salt bridge with R426 in S of SARS-CoV, but S of 2019-nCoV forms a salt bridge with another residue (D30) in ACE2. Thus, the exchange of E329 by N in porcine ACE2 might affect binding to S of SARS-CoV, but not to S from 2019-nCoV. A similar pattern emerges for amino acid differences between human and cattle ACE2 ( Figure 4C ) and cat ACE2 ( Figure 4D ). The few exchanges are also located peripheral to the core of the binding region and thus their exchange might not represent a large obstacle for infection of cells from these species with 2019-nCoV.",

The fatty acids are required for S to fuse with the host cell and affect virus assembly, similar to what has been described for other spike proteins, such as HA of influenza virus. Enzymes that attach acyl chains to S have not been identified, but cellular proteins are acylated by one or several of the 23 members of the ZDHHC family, which have distinct, only partly overlapping substrate specificities. If only a few of them might acylate S in airway cells of the lung, their blockade might result in suppression of viral replication, while acylation of cellular proteins will not be (or very little) compromised. Although more research is required, targeting acyltransferases might be promising, since the cluster of cysteines is present in S from all CoV genera, regardless of their origin. Acylation might thus be required for a very basic function of S, arguing that even newly emerged CoVs probably will also rely on this modification of S to replicate efficiently [76] . However, since key proteins of the innate immune response are also palmitoylated, acylation inhibitors might be limited if the proteins of the innate immune response are modified by the same enzymes as viral proteins.",

It might also be desirable to monitor farm animals and pet cats for infection with 2019-nCoV, since their ACE2 receptor responsible for 2019-nCoV binding differs in only a few amino acids from human ACE2. Surveillance might prevent the virus establishing itself in another animal species that is in close contact to humans. In addition, in light of the fact that there are multiple species of CoVs circulating in wildlife species and that these animals are constantly interacting with each other, host-species expansion or interspecies transmission of new CoV to humans seems to be inevitable. Major knowledge gaps regarding the emergence of 2019-nCoV remain exists but worldwide scientists are working with unprecedented speed to investigate the virus, rushing to develop targeted therapeutics (see Outstanding Questions). Notwithstanding, a global surveillance network involving veterinarians and animal biologists is urgently needed to monitor, and possibly to predict, potential sources for the emergence of another highly pathogenic CoV. We propose the concept of 'One Health' to facilitate scientific exchange across disciplines, sharing of data, and coordinated efforts in order to prevent future outbreaks.

Already by January 23, 29 provinces, plus six foreign countries, had reported a total of 846 confirmed cases, an approximately 20-fold increase from the first phase. Meanwhile, Wuhan city implemented a 'lock-down' (i.e., shutting down all movement within and out of the city). Unfortunately, this period coincided with the traditional mass movement of people, a form of 'home-coming', before Chinese New Year and thus more than 5 million people had already left Wuhan. iii. The third phase started on January 26, which is marked by the rapid increase of cluster cases.On February 10, retrospective analysis showed that the number of clustered cases accounted for 50-80% of all confirmed cases in Beijing, Shanghai, Jiangsu, and Shandong[19].",
