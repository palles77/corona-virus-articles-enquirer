In this study, we evidence that the anti-SARS-CoV2 activity of a clinically achievable hydroxychloroquine concentration is maximized only when administered before and after the infection of Vero E6 cells. This strongly suggests that only a combined prophylactic and therapeutic use of hydroxychloroquine may be effective in limiting viral replication in patients.",

To date, the clinical management of COVID-19 subjects almost exclusively consists of supportive therapy and, in particular, of ventilatory support for the most severe cases. Several drugs, some already in clinical trials, are currently being used in order to limit the inflammatory response or to hamper SARS-CoV-2 replication. Regarding the latter, no SARS-CoV-2-specific drugs are currently available and, as a consequence, there is the need for repurposing drugs used in other settings, such as chloroquine (CQ) and hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) 2, 3 . Several studies already demonstrated the in vitro efficacy of CQ and HCQ, evidencing the latter's higher activity on SARS-CoV-2 4, 5 . Importantly, a recent study also modeled the main pharmacokinetic features of HCQ trying to infer its lung concentration after different dosing regimens 6 .",

            "text": "In the lack of SARS-CoV-2-specific drugs it is extremely important to evaluate the clinical potential of drug-repurposing in order to face the current pandemic 8 . HCQ has gained the attention of the scientific and medical community based on previous in vitro data on similar viruses (SARS and MERS) and on preliminary reports discussing its possible clinical effectiveness [2] [3] [4] . In this atypical context, in which on-field medicine often anticipates experimental laboratory pre-clinic, there is urgent need of prompt experiments addressing specific clinical questions. For example, it is not clear what is the best administration regimen to maximise possible HCQ anti-viral effectiveness in COVID-19 patients. At this regard, a recent study evaluated the direct anti-SARS-CoV-2 effect in vitro and, importantly, modelled its bioavailability at the lung level where it could maximally exert its antiviral activity. Based on a dosing regimen of 400 mg given twice daily for 1 day, followed by 200 mg twice daily for 4 more days, it also suggested the more useful drug concentrations to be used in clinicallyoriented phenotypic laboratory assays 5,6,9 . On that basis, we evaluated the HCQ antiviral activity when administered before (preadsorption), after (post-adsorption) or before and after (full-time) virus adsorption in order to simulate its possible prophylactic, therapeutic and prophylactic/therapeutic clinical use. Moreover, we focused our attention on a single concentration (10 uM) easily achieved, well tolerated and endowed with a strong antiviral activity 6 . Moreover, in order to speculate on its possible mechanism of action, we also evaluated HCQ activity performing virus adsorption at 37 and 4\u00b0C. In fact, at 37\u00b0C the virus enters the cell in a more physiological context while, conversely, at 4\u00b0C virus it can dock to the cell receptor, but its internalisation is much more limited.",

A limited antiviral activity was also observed in the therapeutic setting (postadsorption) but, interestingly, a higher HCQ antiviral activity was observed at 4\u00b0C, suggesting its predominant SARS-CoV-2 interference at the endosomal level 10, 11 .

This observation allows to speculate on the need of a combined prophylactic and therapeutic clinical use of HCQ on in order to maximise its antiviral effects. In the atypical scenario of an ongoing pandemic, pre-clinical medical research should be focused on simple and fast observations potentially useful for the prompt set up of clinical trials. As an example, our observation could be easily translated in a clinical study on extremely high-risk categories, such as health care workers, based on the prophylactic administration of HCQ followed by its therapeutic use in case of positivity to SARS-CoV-2. The time is crucial during a pandemic and the correct clinical repurposing of HCQ could be really invaluable. author/funder. All rights reserved. No reuse allowed without permission.",
