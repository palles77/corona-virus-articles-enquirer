The ultimate impact of the COVID-19 outbreak will not be clear for a long time, but greater adherence to the lifestyle modifications suggested by healthcare and public health organizations will greatly delay the spread of the disease. This, in turn, will keep hospitals and clinics from being overwhelmed. For example, hospitals are overburdened in parts ofItaly, which is projected to approximately 80% of its total ICU beds occupied by COVID-19 patients before April 2020. 6 As healthcare professionals with a high public availability, community pharmacists are likely to be many patients' first option for health information. Patients may present to community pharmacies for refills or new prescriptions; prescribers may cancel non-urgent appointments, which would make the community pharmacist a sole point of in-person contact with the healthcare system. It is therefore imperative that community pharmacists be equipped with knowledge and tools to communicate clearly and effectively with patients about ways to limit the impact of COVID-19.",

The HBM was originally developed to study why patients may not seek screening for tuberculosis, 7 and is one of the most prominent public health frameworks for understanding why individuals may or may not act in the face of a threat to personal or community health. The HBM has been used for decades to study vaccination, medication adherence, diabetes self-care, condom use, and other behaviors that require modification of a patient's actions to mitigate a threat to health. 8, 9 Like many public health behavior models, the HBM studies behavior at an individual and community level by conceptualizing the determinants of behavior into several contributing factors called constructs. The HBM has evolved over time and many modified forms are present in literature; this article will operationalize the HBM as pictured in Figure 1 , adapted from Champion and Skinner. 7 Broadly, the HBM suggests that individual beliefs and direct cues to action inform behavior.In turn, beliefs are informed by one's background and are comprised ofone's impression of the perceived threat, the perceived benefits to taking action, the perceived barriers to taking action, and one's perceived ability to take action (i.e., perceived self-efficacy). The purpose of this article is to explain how community pharmacist can use the constructs of the HBM as a communication guide to move patients toward behaviors that will limit the spread of COVID-19.",

In the United States, for example, persons of lower socioeconomic standing may not have access to all of the tools needed to overcome all perceived barriers to action. Persons of differing ethnic backgrounds may react differently to calls for social distancingdue to varying cultural attitudes and norms regarding interpersonal interactions. An exhaustive list of how all modifying factors may interact with other HBM constructs in the context of COVID-19 is beyond the present scope, though some thoughts on modifying factors will be provided when discussing other constructs of the HBM. As community members themselves, community pharmacists are uniquely positioned to understand how these factors may impact their patients.

            "text": "When considering COVID-19 in the context of the HBM, community pharmacists may be poised to act most directly and most powerfully on these constructs. Educating the community on health risks is a core function of community pharmacy in most places, and community pharmacists are likely to be trusted members of their communities. Acting on these constructs may mean educating on individualor community-level threats, incorporating patient-level modifying factors and epidemiological findings as appropriate. For example, early data strongly suggest that older patients with the disease are more likely to experience viral pneumonia, hospitalization, or other significant adverse health outcomes; the odds of death may be as high as 15% in patients over the age of 80. 4, 5 Patients are also more likely to experience severe illness with COVID-19 if they have diabetes, COPD, or cardiovascular disease at baseline, or if they smoke or are male. 5 Conversely, pharmacists must be careful to avoid implying that there is no threat to younger, healthier individuals. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that 38% of COVID-19 hospitalizations may have occurred in patients under the age of 55. 10 It may be worthwhile to ask patients if they would tolerate a comparable chance of a similarly-negative avoidable outcome, such as an automobile accident that results in injury. Community-level threats may also be salient to those at lower individual risk. If a younger individual is from a culture that places a high value on family or the elderly, the pharmacist may want to underscore the risks of transmitting the disease to family members or older community members. Again, the pharmacist could ask if the individual would drive recklessly with valued family members in their automobile, for instance. Some discretion may be needed when interacting with members of the community who have anxiety disorders, obsessive-compulsive disorder, or other mental health concerns that may predispose to unhealthy fixation the threat posed by COVID-19. When interacting with these individuals, community pharmacists may instead choose to leverage other constructs in the HBM to motivate behavior change without producing undue distress, such as perceived benefits and perceived self-efficacy. This may be an exception to previous guidance to deploy as many constructs of the HBM as possible.",

In the context of COVID-19 prevention behaviors, it may mean reminding patients standing in line to practice social distancing or advising patients who exhibit symptoms of COVID-19 to quarantine themselves for the length of time suggested by their doctor. Community pharmacists should take care to practice cultural competence when providing guidance: some communities and individuals will want their healthcare professionals to be cooperative and consultative, while others may prefer simple, clear directions from an expert.",

Effective mitigation of the disease will require nontrivial efforts from a significant fraction of the world population, including social distancing and avoiding unnecessary interactions with others. No matter how stringently these measures are recommended, a fraction of people may not believe that they can or should act in ways that will limit the threat. The HBM is a model that has been used to study behaviors related to preventing or mitigating disease. It conceptualizes beliefs about disease as being comprised of the perception of the threat as severe and relevant, the perception of benefits of and barriers to acting, and the perception of one's intrinsic ability to act. As trusted, community-facing healthcare professionals, pharmacists are uniquely suited to bring about change in patient behaviors.Community pharmacists using HBM to reinforce COVID-19 mitigation behaviors should appropriately emphasize the severity and susceptibility of the threat, emphasize barriers to acting, help patients identify ways to overcome barriers to acting, and reinforce self-efficacy beliefs.",
