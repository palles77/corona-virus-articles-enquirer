Three partially overlapping fragments of TGEV S gene, encoding the amino-terminal, intermediate, and carboxy-terminal end of the protein, as well as the full length gene were inserted into the asd+ plasmid pYA292 to generate recombinant plasmids pYATS-I, pYATS-2, pYATS-3, and pYATS-4, respectively, which were transformed into S. typhimurium x3987. Recombinant S. typhimurium x3987 (pYATS-1) and'x3987 (pYATS-4) expressing constitutively a 53 kDa amino-terminal fragment of the S protein and the full length protein ( 144 kDa) , respectively, showed high stability. After 50 generations in vitro 60% and 20% of the bacteria transformed with pYATS-1 and pYATS-4, respektively, expressed the S-protein antigen. Since S. typhimurium x3987 (pYATS-1) showed a better level of expression and stability in vitro, this recombinant strain was selected as a potential bivalent vector to induce both immunity to SulnwnelZa and TGEV in swine. In order to study colonization of swine tissues by S. typhimurium Acya Acrp, a gene conferring resistance to rifampicin was cloned into the chromosome of S. typhimurium x3987, generating x4509 strain. Both S. typhimurium ,@509 (pYA292) and fl509 ( pYATS-1) colonized the ileum of orally inoculated swine with clearance of bacteria between days 10-20 post-infection. The expression of the amino-terminal fragment of the S protein diminished the ability of S. typhimurium x4509 (pYATS-1) to colonize deep tissues. The recombinant strain S. typhimurium x3987 ( pYATS-1) induced TGEV specific antibodies in both serum and saliva of orally inoculated swine. * Corresponding author: Phone: 34-l-585-4555.

            "text": "Transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) is a coronavirus that causes enteric disease in swine of all ages. The disease is especially severe in newborn animals less than two weeks old, in which mortality approaches 100% (Siddell et al., 1983; Saif and Wesley, 1992) . TGEV has four structural proteins: the spike (S), the nucleoprotein (N), the membrane protein (M) and the small membrane (sM) protein (Spaan et al., 1988; Spaan et al., 1990; Godet et al., 1992; Enjuanes and Van der Zeijst, 1995) . Protein S is the major inducer of TGEV neutralizing antibodies (Garwes et al., 1978; Sturman and Holmes, 1983; JimCnez et al., 1986) . In this protein, four antigenic sites (A, B, C and D) have been defined by mutual competition of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) (Delmas et al., 1986; Jim&e2 et al., 1986; Correa et al., 1988; Correa et al., 1990; Delmas et al., 1990) . Site A is antigenically dominant and has been subdivided into three antigenic subsites: Aa, Ab and AC (Correa et al., 1988) . Sites A and D, and to a minor extent site B, have been involved in the neutralization of TGEV (Delmas et al., 1986; Jimknez et al., 1986) . Sites A and B have been shown to be conformational and glycosylation dependent, while sites C and D are continuous and glycosylation independent, although a small effect of glycosylation has been observed in site D (Correa et al., 1988; Correa et al., 1990; Posthumus et al., 1990a; Posthumus et al., 1990b; Gebauer et al., 1991) Passive immunity is of primary importance in providing newborn piglets with immediate protection against TGEV infection (Saif and Wesley, 1992) . This type of protection can be achieved by the induction of lactogenic immunity (Stone et al., 1977; Wesley et al., 1988) , which can be stimulated by presentation of selected antigens to the immune system in gut associated lymphoid tissues (GALT) (Montgomery et al., 1974) . One possible approach to deliver antigens to the GALT is the use of vectors with tropism for Peyer's patches, such as Salmonella . A variety of attenuated Salmonella strains have been generated in laboratories worldwide (Bacon et al., 1950; Bacon et al., 1951; Germanier and Furer, 1971; Hoiseth and Stocker, 1981) . S. typhimurium Acya Acrp mutants, which are deficient in the synthesis of adenylate cyclase and the cyclic AMP (CAMP) receptor protein (CRP), are both avirulent and immunogenic in orally immunized mice, while retaining their ability to colonize and persist in the GALT (Curtiss III and Kelly, 1987) . Several heterologous genes from different pathogens have been expressed in S. typhimurium A cya A crp. The recombinant bacteria thus generated have been successfully used to deliver the foreign antigens to the GALT and induce secretory and systemic immune responses against both Salmonella and the recombinant antigen in different animal species, including swine (Stabel et al., 1990; Stabel et al., 1991; Doggett et al., 1993; Schtiel et al., 1993) . One main problem with live vector vaccines is the stability and maintenance of recombinant plasmids in vivo, since the use of drug-resistance genes as selection determi-nants is impractical in this situation. Nakayama et al. ( 1988) designed a balanced-lethal system in which a gene for P-aspartate semialdehyde dehydrogenase (asd+ ) from Streprococcus mutants was present in plasmid vectors to complement a lethal Aasd mutation in the chromosome of the Sulmonellu vaccine strain. The asd-encoded enzyme is required for the biosynthesis of diaminopimelic acid (DAP) , an essential component of the peptidoglycan in the cell wall of Gram-negative bacteria. Growth of usd mutants in the absence of DAP leads to cell lysis. The usd+ plasmids ensure stable in vivo maintenance in attenuated Ausd S. typhimurium in the absence of external selection (Nakayama et al., 1988; . In the present work usd+ plasmid pYA292 (Nakayama et al., 1988; has been used to express several fragments of TGEV S protein in attenuated S. typhimurium Acyu Acrp Ausd. The recombinant vectors obtained in this way were characterized and their potential use as bivalent oral live vaccines in swine has been evaluated.",

Three partially overlapping fragments of 1595, 2194 and 1298 bp coding for an amino-terminal, an intermediate and a carboxy-terminal fragment of the S protein, respectively, were obtained. The amino-terminal and carboxy-terminal fragments were subcloned into the expression plasmid pYA292 in frame with the 5' end of 1acZo gene. The intermediate fragment was also cloned into pYA292 by removing a fragment of 0.16 kb containing lacZ,cr gene. Both S gene fragments and the plasrnid pYA292 were digested with the appropriate restriction enzymes and purified from agarose gels prior to being ligated and electroporated into E. coli Ausd fi097F'. Recombinant plasmids pYATS-1, pYATS-2 and pYATS-3 containing the 5' end, intermediate and 3' end of the S gene, respectively, were obtained (Fig. 1) . The full length S gene was also cloned into pYA292 according to the following procedure: The 3' fragment 3330-4628 was cut with HindZZZ from the Bluescript vector containing this insert (Correa et al., 1990) . This fragment was cloned into the HindZZZ site of the Bluescript vector that contained the intermediate fragment of the gene ( 1135-3329), obtaining a recombinant plasmid which included an insert spanning the area 1135-4628 of the S gene. The fragment 1320-4628 was cut from this plasmid using the restriction sites AflII and PstI ( from Bluescript polylinker) and ligated to pYATS-1, previously digested with AflII and PstI. The recombinant plasmid generated in this way ( pYATS-4) was electroporated into E. coli fi097F'. Recombinant clones were screened for plasmid DNA by a modification of the Birnboim alkaline minilysate technique (Bimboim and Doly, 1979) . Restriction enzyme digestions and ligation reactions were carried out as described by the manufacturers (Boehringer Mannheim, New England Biolabs) .",

Dilutions were plated on LB agar for titer determination, Invasion, colonization, persistence, and immunity studies. Groups of two Large White x Belgian Landrace pigs inoculated with one single dose of S. typhimurium x4509 (pYA292) or x4509 (pYATS-1) , as described earlier, were sacrificed on days 1, 5, 10, and 20 postoral inoculation. Portions of different parts of the small intestine (duodenum, jejunum, and ileum), liver and spleen were removed from each animal, immediately placed in MLS and kept on ice. Samples were homogenized by using a Potter-Elvehjem tissue grinder, plated on brilliant-green agar containing 50 pg of rifampicin per ml and incubated overnight at 37\". The expression of the amino-terminal fragment of the S protein in S. typhimurium x4509 ( pYATS-1) colonies recovered from the inoculated animals was analyzed by western blot as it has been described previously.",

A slight aggregation of this product was observed in these bacteria. The product expressed from pYATS-2, corresponding to the intermediate fragment of the S protein, had a molecular mass of 70 kDa and was expressed at high level in S. typhimurium x3730 (pYA232).

The band of lower molecular mass that appeared in both S. x3730 and x3987 (pYATS-2) ( Fig. 2) corresponded to a degradation product of the intermediate fragment, since it was not present in the negative control. pYATS-2 expression product also aggregated in both bacterial systems. The expression of the carboxy-terminal fragment of the S protein was highly toxic in the two bacterial systems, as shown by the lack of growth of S. typhimurium x3730 (pYA232, pYATS-3) in the presence of IPTG or the absence of colonies obtained when electroporating pYATS-3 into S. typhimurium x3981. The whole S protein, with an expected size of 144 kDa, was expressed from pYATS-4 transformed bacteria as an aggregate of high molecular mass.

Recombinant product pYATS-1 included sequences from sites C, B, and D, while pYATS-2 included sites D and A.

The fact that only site Dspecific mAb 8D.H8 reacted with pYATS-2 product ( 1135-3229) could be due to a partial representation of this site in the intermediate fragment of the protein.

Recombinant x4509 ( pYATS-1) also showed a high degree of stability in swine, although the fact that 50% of the bacteria recovered from the small intestine at day 10 had lost expression of the S protein amino-terminal fragment suggests that the stability of this recombinant is lower in vivo than in vitro.",

The antibody response in serum was of the IgG isotype as determined by incubating directly with protein A in the RIA assay (protein A binds weakly to swine IgA) (Bennell and Watson, 1980) . In saliva, however, only IgA isotype antibodies were detected. The lack of detection of antibodies in saliva when incubating directly with protein A confirms the weak reactivity of this protein with swine IgA. All swine orally inoculated with S. typhimurium x3987 (pYA292) or x3987 (pYATS-1) developed specific antibodies to Salmonella antigens in serum and secretions, which probably indicates that the bacteria have been able to colonize the GALT of the infected animals.",

The protection against TGEV requires the induction of lactogenic immunity, since piglets are too young to develop an immune response in a short time and must receive passive immunity through the milk. The recombinant S. typhimurium x3987 ( pYATS-1) induced a secretory immune response against TGEV in saliva, which makes it a potential vector for the induction of lactogenic immunity. The induction of lactogenic immunity to both Sulmonella and TGEV by oral inoculation of pregnant sows, on which Salmonella could be more invasive, and consequently more immunogenic due to partial immune suppression during pregnancy, with S. typhimurium x3987 (pYATS-1) is currently under study.",
