The objective of this study was to search for likely microbial agents in diseased tissues using immunocytochemical techniques. Methods: Intestines and mesenteric lymph node specimens of 21 patients from two French families with a high frequency of Crohn's disease and from Connecticut were studied. The microbial agents searched for included Bacteroides vulgatus, Borrelia burgdorferi, Escherichia coil, Listeria monocytogenes, Streptococcus spp., bovine viral diarrhea virus, influenza A virus, measles virus, parainfluenza virus, and respiratory syncytial virus. Results: Seventy-five percent of the patients with Crohn's disease (12 of 16) were positively labeled with the antibody to Listeria. Macrophages and giant cells immunolabeled for this antigen were distributed underneath ulcers, along fissures, around abscesses, within the lamina propria, in granulomas, and in the germinal centers of mesenteric lymph nodes. In addition, 57% (12 of 21) of the cases contained the E. coil antigen, and 44% (7 of 16) contained the streptococcal antigen. The immunolabeling for the latter two agents also occurred within macrophages and giant cells, distributed in a pattern similar to that of Listeria antigen. Conclusions: The results suggest that Listeria spp., E. coil, and streptococci, but not measles virus, play a role in the pathogenesis of Crohn's disease.",

            "text": "I nfectious agents have been suspected in the initiation of Crohn's disease (CD) since this disorder was first recognized) A variety of microbial agents including Yersinia, 2\"3 Brucella, 2 Campylobacter, 2'4 mycobacteria, 2'5-8 chlamydias, 3'9'z\u00b0 cytomegalovirus, ~ and herpesvirus 12 have been considered putative agents; however, there is no convincing evidence for the etiologic involvement of any. Several approaches have been used in the attempt to show that microbial agents play a role in the etiology of CD. They include (1) demonstration of the presence of organisms or specific antigens in affected tissues; (2) culture of the microbes from the affected tissues; (3) demonstration of serological responses to the agent; and (4) localization and detection of individual pathogenspecific nucleic acid sequences in affected tissues by in situ hybridization and polymerase chain reaction. The objective of the present study was to use immunocytochemistry to seek selected infectious agents or antigens in diseased tissues. Intestinal tissues and mesenteric lymph nodes from 21 patients were studied. Twelve of the patients were from two French families with an extraordinarily high frequency of CD 13, and 9 patients were from Connecticut. Tissues of the French patients were previously examined by immunocytochemistry for the antigens of mycobacteria and Yersinia and were found to contain none) 3 Cartun et al. ll reported that, of 16 cases of CD, Escherichia coli and streptococcal antigens were identified in 11 (69%) and 10 (63%), respectively. They suggested that E. coli and streptococcal antigens may contribute in a secondary way to the pathogenesis. In the current study, antibodies to these two agents were applied to tissues of a new series of patients. Gump 14 found that the levels of circulating antibodies against Bacteroides vulgatus were elevated in patients with CD. This is the same species of Bacteroides shown by Breeling et al. 15 to provide immune enhancement of experimentally induced disease in a guinea pig model of inflammatory bowel disease. Therefore, evidence of in situ participation by B. vulgatus was examined in the present study. Listeria monocytogenes has been occasionally found in the gastrointestinal tract of healthy persons ~6 and has been implicated in causing granulomatous hepatitis in animals 17 and humans. 18 Because granulomas are an important feature of CD, L, monocytogenes was also sought. Antibody against Borrelia burgdorferi was used because of an anecdotal report of the coexistence of CD and Lyme disease in 1 patient.",

It is our understanding that all the tissues studied in this study, from patients and from controls, were promptly processed into paraffin blocks at the time of initial diagnostic pathological studies. The background of two French families with an extraordinarily high frequency of CD was previously reported by Van Kruiningen et al. t3 Briefly, in the first family, both husband and wife and their 4 children were affected. In addition, a spouse of one of the children has recently contracted CD after a 7-year relationship. In the second family, 7 of 11 children have CD.

Endogenous peroxidase activity was quenched with 3 % hydrogen peroxide for 5 minutes. The tissue was then rinsed with tap water and incubated in phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.4) for 5 minutes, and the primary antibody at predetermined optimal dilution was applied. Slides were placed in humidity chambers and incubated for 16 hours at 4\u00b0C. For the labeled streptavidin-biotin-peroxidase method, biotinylated secondary antibody appropriate to the primary was added and incubated at room temperature for 30 minutes. The sections were further covered with streptavidin horseradish peroxidase conjugate after the excess secondary antibody was rinsed off. After additional washings, the sections were covered with amino-ethylcarbazole chromogen and incubated at room temperature for 20 minutes. The chromogen was rinsed from the slides in running tap water for 1 minute, and the tissues were counterstained with Lerner-2 hematoxylin for 45 seconds, coated with Crystal Mount (Biomeda Corp., Foster City, CA), and heated for 15 minutes. The slides were coverslipped after cooling. For the indirect method, horseradish peroxidase-con-jugated secondary antibody was used.

The immunolabeling occurred in the nuclei ofmacrophages, fibroblasts, giant ceils, smooth muscle cells, and nerves. The labeled cells were distributed in the lamina propria, submucosa, muscle layers, subserosa, and granulomas (except that neither granulomas nor giant cells occurred in the normal or UC tissues). Of 16 patients with CD, 3 showed similar labeling of nuclei in endothelial ceils of small vessels. In contrast to these results with polyclonal antibody, none of the CD, UC, and normal control tissues were labeled by monoclonal measles nucleocapsid protein antibody, although highly specific staining with this antibody was observed in control tissue of subacute sclerosing panencephalitis.",

To our knowledge, this is the first suggestion that Listeria may occur in intestinal tissues of patients with CD.

Streptococci more than likely act as secondary rather than primary agents. On the basis of immunolabeling of formalin-fixed tissues, 11 of 16 patients with CD had antigen of more than one kind of bacteria. The involvement of multiple bacteria can be explained in the following ways. First, the disease may be caused by several microbial agents acting in sequence. Second, a predisposing genetic susceptibility, an environmental agent, or a specific virus infection may cause increased intestinal permeability that results in invasion by more than one bacterium. Third, this may represent colonization and invasion of ulcerated bowel by several members of the resident flora.",

In contrast, none of the tissues were immunolabeled by monoclonal measles nucleocapsid protein antibody, even though the positive controls (cell cultures containing measles virus and tissues from a patient with subacute sclerosing panencephalitis) were clearly and specifically labeled by the latter, both in the nucleus and in the cytoplasm. Because the polyclonal measles antiserum was not affinity purified, it appears that it may contain some antibody that is reactive with normal cellular components. Measles virus phosphoprotein is known to have immunologic cross-reactivity with an intermediate filament protein of human ceils, probably vimentin. 37 The lack of immunolabeling of all the CD and control intestinal tissues with monoclonal antimeasles nucleocapsid protein antibody suggests that either measles virus is not present or that the amount of antigen is insufficient to be detectable by the present methods. Therefore, our results do not confirm the data of Wakefield et al. regarding the presence of measles virus in CD. 21 Electron microscopic studies by Wakefield et al. 21 and our group 38 have shown the presence of viruslike particles in endothelial cells and giant ceils of CD tissues, particles that have the size and morphology of paramyxoviruses. Because we could not show evidence of measles virus, we used immunocytochemistry to search for other paramyxoviruses and found no evidence of parainfluenza or RSV. The identity of the viruslike particles remains to be determined. Additional immunocytochemistry and immunoelectron microscopy are needed to further explore the role of viruses in the initiation of CD.",

In addition, we have shown for the first time that the lesions of a majority of patients (75%) with CD, from two separate populations in Europe and North America, contain important antigen-bearing macrophages and giant cells that have immunoreactivity with antibody to L. monocytogenes. The specificity and significance of this latter finding remain to be determined.",

Listeria are widely distributed in nature and have been isolated from fecal specimens of healthy ferrets, chinchillas, ruminants, and humans. Human and animal populations can be healthy gastrointestinal carriers of this organism. .6 In an animal model, L. monocytogenes was able to colonize the gastrointestinal tract of germ-free mice, cross the gut mucosa, and cause systemic infection. 3\u00b0 L. monocytogenes are facultative intracellular pathogens,capable of producing granulomatous reactions. Granulomas and microabscesses have been shown in a liver biopsy specimen from an adult patient with listeriosis, is MacDonald and Carter 31 reported that the oral administration ofL monocytogenes consistently initiated infection in the Peyer's patches of the small intestine of SPF B6D2F1 mice. The Peyer's patches appeared to be the only site where L. monocytogenes made an initial invasion and survived in the intestinal tissues. It is tempting to suggest that on interacting with the host mucosa, Listeria may induce the aphthous ulcer, regarded as the earliest lesion ofCD 22  and the first to recur after surgery. 23 On the other hand, L monocytogenes antigen was coexistent with E. coli or streptococcal antigen in 83% of the patients with CD containing labeled antigen (10 of 12),",

Our results are also in agreement with the serological findings of Brown and Lee 32 and Tabaqchali et al. 33 who showed that E. coli antibody titerswere higher in patients with CD than in controls. In addition, E, coli and other potentially pathogenic bacteria were isolated more frequently from the intestinal serosa and mesenteric nodes of patients with CD (27% and 33%) than in controls.34 In the study of Tabaqchali et al., 33 sera from 30 patients with inflammatory bowel disease including 16 with CD and 14 with UC were assayed for the presence of antibodies against 159 E. cell O antigens and compared with sera from 16 matched control subjects. The patients with inflammatory bowel disease had higher titers of antibody than the control group, but there was no single serorype that was associated with the disease, suggesting that the E. coil participation was secondary. Group F Streptococcus immunolabeling was found in 44% of patients with CD, another finding consistent with the results of Cartun et a1.11 Injection of streptococcal cell wall fragments into the small intestine and cecum has been shown to induce granulomatous enterocolitis in rats. 35 Streptococcal lipoteichoic acid can be carried by the blood to other body sites. 36 Streptococci may have an important role in inducing extraintestinal features of CD.",
