Codes of (ethical) practice for healthcare professionals tend to emphasise responsibilities to individual patients. Ethical frameworks for public health focus on groups of individuals (populations), the majority of whom are relatively healthy and empowered. Hospital infection control professionals must take account of both of these perspectives, sensitive to the care of infected and potentially infectious individuals, while protecting the vulnerable and relatively dependent population of hospital patients from further compromise to their health. A number of frameworks for an ethics of public health have been proposed over the last few years but there are sufficient differences in ethical considerations between collective interventions that aim to protect and promote the health of the public and interventions taken in the context of hospital infection control to justify a distinctive ethics of hospital infection control. Professional bodies may be best placed to lead the development of such a framework.",

Freedom of movement, privacy, companionship and many other goods are valued by patients, staff and visitors. Frequently, methods for the control of the spread of infection involve constraints on individual freedoms, for example through restricting contact with others (isolation), restricting access to education (children in the USA cannot attend school without vaccinations), and restrictions on travel [as happened during the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak]. The Public Health (Scotland) Act 2008 gives statutory powers forcing quarantine in their own home on individuals with some types of serious infection and expanded requirements for compulsory notification. 4 Both of these powers potentially bring the principles of respect for the individual (autonomy and privacy) into conflict with the greater good (preventing the spread of infection).

The chief executive officer asks for information to be collected on the names of staff who fail to comply, so that he can discipline those staff failing to comply at the next audit. How will you respond to this request? C. The eye surgeons in a teaching hospital had noticed an increase in postcataract surgery infection. This had led to closure of the eye theatre for major remedial work to be carried out on a faulty air-handling unit. When the theatre is to be reopened the eye theatre sister asks if the patients who will be operated on should be told of the previous problems, particularly as there is no certainty that the deficiencies in the air-handling plant were sufficient to explain the high infection rate. Do the patients have a right to know? D. The strategic health authority offers your National Health Service trust \u00a3100 000 to 'improve infection control'. The head of infection control wants to prioritise rapid methods for the detection of MRSA because of ongoing public concerns with MRSA infection. There are several competing priorities, which include higher than expected death rates from fungal infection in the bone marrow transplant unit, increasing numbers of extended-spectrum b-lactamase-producing Escherichia coli infection in the renal unit, and concerns about the adequacy of facilities available for isolation of patients with diarrhoea. How should priorities be decided? E. An elderly man is admitted to an isolation ward following a hernia repair and the development of a postoperative wound infection from which MRSA has been isolated. During his stay in the isolation ward he develops norovirus infection, then C. difficile diarrhoea, and after a protracted stay he dies. The death certificate gives C. difficile as a contributory cause of death. His family ask for justification of the decision to place him in a ward with patients with infectious diarrhoea.

Many consider hospital infection control to be a natural extension of control strategies applied in the wider community for the control of spread of infectious diseases. So for example, the role of the English Health Protection Agency (HPA) is to provide an integrated approach to protecting UK public health. The HPA has taken a substantial role in overseeing the surveillance and strategic direction of infection control in National Health Service (NHS) trusts. The HPA website describes its function as 'to protect the community (or any part of the community) against infectious diseases and other dangers to health.' The HPA acknowledges that 'decision makers must balance individual freedom against the common good, fear for personal safety against the duty to treat the sick, and short term economic losses against the wider implications of the potential spread of serious diseases', but it says little about the principles to be used in balancing these requirements. More detailed guidelines have been produced by the US Public Health Leadership Society, by other recent reports, and by a number of books, some of which have proposed a change in the definition and emphasis of public health. 9e12 Many of the actions available to public health professionals are also used in hospitals. These include surveillance, education, isolation of individuals, cohorting, treatment of infectious individuals, vaccination, and actions to contain risks associated with food, water, and airborne transmission of agents of infection. However, there are important differences in ethical considerations between collective (infectious diseases control) actions undertaken to protect and promote the health of the public, and infection control in hospitals.",

Some are already at the margins of a minimum capability to function and these individuals are particularly vulnerable to falling below a minimum threshold following HCAI. Some individuals (such as infants undergoing intensive care) in early stages of growth and development may never achieve a full range of capacities to function, and HCAI adds significantly to this burden of reduced capabilities.

Munthe developed a model for the goals of public health within a European Public Health Network (EuroPHEN) project which was funded by the European Commission. 14 Munthe suggested that 'The most basic problem . seems to be the tension between the population perspective of public health and the individualistic perspective of traditional medical ethical notions of autonomy.' He proposed a population approach to autonomy, and an integrated multidimensional model of public health goals including consideration of autonomy (with respect to health opportunity choices), and equality (of health states and distribution of health opportunities). He proposed an integration of these goals with the traditional goal of public health e which is the promotion of population health e into the integrated goal of 'the promotion of equal (and real) opportunities of everyone to be more healthy.' In discussing how this model might work in guiding decision-making in practice, he argues that the relative importance of the traditional goal increases when population health is poorer. As population health rises, further gains in population health could be traded for gains in autonomy and equality. It is difficult to see how this approach could be applied in a hospital context. Levels of health (of hospital patients) are low (otherwise they would not be hospital patients), the capacity for autonomous decision-making may be impaired (because patients are ill), and the consequences of actions taken to control (hospital) population health may have impact not just on autonomy but also on the health of individuals e for example, on those placed in isolation.",

The application of this principle as a single principle to decision-making in public health is fraught with difficulties and is also potentially self-contradictory. 17 Instead the Nuffield Council draw on European Commission advice that decisions based on this principle require integration of at least five dimensions which include risk assessment (including acknowledgements of areas of uncertainty), attention to fairness and consistency, costs and benefits of different course of action, transparency, and proportionality (actions taken should be in proportion to the risk). 18 The Nuffield Council refer to this as a precautionary approach. This type of approach (particularly risk assessment, proportionality) will be familiar to many working in hospital infection control even though perhaps not formally defined in this way. e What are our responsibilities to those coming into hospital with respect to reporting the risks of healthcareassociated infection (HCAI) and actions taken to control HCAI? When do we require patient consent?",

Ethical dilemmas can provide a starting place in helping to identify important areas of concern and uncertainty. A number of examples of infection control ethical dilemmas are given by Bryan et al. 19 and in Box 1. An example of a situation with considerable ethical tensions is that of decision-making with respect to the closure of an intensive care facility with the objective of controlling an outbreak of infection such as caused by Acinetobacter baumannii (see example A in Box 1). There is much uncertainty concerning the impact of A. baumannii infection on overall patient outcomes in intensive care; and uncertainty with respect to the effectiveness of control strategies; closure of the facility has considerable potential to impact on patients who require intensive care (but for whom facilities may not be available if the unit is closed to new admissions); failure to control the outbreak may lead to spread to other units, and may lead to future problems such as the development of increasing antibiotic resistance.",
