Due to their low abundance in cells, sequencing-based studies of pre-miRNAs have been limited. We successfully enriched for and deep sequenced pre-miRNAs in human cells by capturing these RNAs during their interaction with Argonaute (AGO) proteins. Using this approach, we detected > 350 pre-miRNAs in human cells and > 250 pre-miRNAs in a reanalysis of a similar study in mouse cells. We uncovered widespread trimming and non-templated additions to the 3' ends of pre-and mature miRNAs. Additionally, we created an index for microRNA precursor processing efficiency. This analysis revealed a subset of pre-miRNAs that produce low levels of mature miRNAs despite abundant precursors, including an annotated miRNA in the 5' UTR of the DiGeorge syndrome critical region 8 mRNA transcript. This led us to search for AGO-associated stem-loops originating from other mRNA species, which identified hundreds of putative pre-miRNAs derived from human and mouse mRNAs. In summary, we provide a wealth of information on mammalian pre-miRNAs, and identify novel microRNA and microRNA-like elements localized in mRNAs.",

Animal miRNAs are generated in a two-step process, whereby miRNA precursors (pre-miRNAs) are first cleaved from their primary transcripts (pri-miRNAs) by the action of the DGCR8/DROSHA microprocessor complex (3, 4) . Alternative pre-miRNA biogenesis pathways have been described that bypass the microprocessor. For example, mirtron loci generate pre-miRNAs in a splicing-dependent and DROSHA-independent fashion (5, 6) . Pre-miRNAs are then transported into the cytoplasm by Exportin-5 for further processing (7, 8) .",

DICER cleaves the pre-miRNA to reveal a ~22 nt miRNA duplex, consisting of the upstream miRNA (denoted as the 5p miRNA) and downstream miRNA (denoted as the 3p miRNA). One of these strands is selectively loaded into AGO to form the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC). Alternatively, AGO2 has been shown to directly cleave several pre-miRNAs, which are then further processed by the poly(A)-specific ribonuclease (PARN) to give rise to mature miRNAs. This class of miRNAs is known as the AGO2-cleaved pre-miRNAs (ac-pre-miRNAs) (12) (13) (14) (15) . Such DICER-independent processing .

In concert with bioinformatic approaches, these datasets have been expanded to identify thousands of novel miRNAs (25, 26) . In contrast, sequencing of pre-miRNAs has been challenging, due to the presence of other RNA species, including the highly abundant transfer RNAs (tRNAs) and small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs), that exist in the same size range as pre-miRNAs. Attempts to use size selection to sequence pre-miRNAs have achieved < 1% of total sequenced clones corresponding to pre-miRNAs even after selective depletion of abundant species (27) . Alternatively, primer-based approaches have been applied, but these methods restrict analysis to known miRNA species and thus cannot be .

Using this approach, pre-miRNA libraries from mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) were generated with > 40% of reads mapping to miRNA loci (19) . Thus, this strategy can be used to efficiently study pre-miRNAs globally without the need for primer-based approaches or depletion of abundant RNA species. Here, we applied this approach to isolate and sequence pre-miRNAs and mature miRNAs from human embryonic kidney (HEK293T) cells. We developed a bioinformatic pipeline to capture post-transcriptional modifications, which we applied to data generated in this study from HEK293T cells, as well as to the previous data generated in MEFs. Our results provide global insights into pre-miRNA processing and provide an alternative strategy for identifying pre-miRNAs and other AGO-associated stem-loops in transcriptomes of interest. ",

Given that pre-miRNAs and mature miRNAs contain non-templated modifications at their 3' ends, we reasoned that standard alignment pipelines would be limited in their ability to align these sequences to miRBase. Therefore, we developed an alignment pipeline that utilized the first 35 nt of the pre-miRNA-seq (18 nt for miRNA-seq) reads for alignment (Fig. 1C) , followed by Smith-Waterman local alignment to extend the read as far as possible along the mapped miRNA sequence (see Methods) (43) (44) (45) .

In mouse, for which ac-pre-miRNAs are best characterized, we observed all previously identified ac-pre-miRNAs with the exception of miR-451, which is not expressed in MEFs (Table 1 ). In our human dataset, we also observed previously identified ac-pre-miRNAs, including 9 members of the let-7 family and miR-9-2 (Table S3) . From this approach, we identified 7 putative ac-pre-miRNA candidates in humans and 37 in mouse, including hsa-miR-455 and mmu-miR-335 (Figs. 3A-B and Tables 1 and S3 ).",

We further refined our analysis by only focusing on high confidence miRNAs, which left us with 158 human and 159 mouse miRNAs with reads mapping from pre-miRNA-seq and/or miRNA-seq libraries (Table S5) . We analyzed the correlation between pre-miRNAs and mature miRNA levels expressed from these families (Figs. 4A-B) .

Approximately 1.2 and 0.37 million clones passed our stringent filtering steps and mapped to human and mouse mRNAs, respectively (Table S1 ). To identify pre-miRNA-like AGO-associated stem-loops derived from mRNAs, we used a CLIP-seq peak calling approach to identify significant (modified false discovery rate (mFDR) < 0.01) read clusters in mRNAs (35) . We found a number of significant peaks that corresponded to nearly the full length of some highly expressed genes (e.g ACTB). Therefore, we further filtered significant clusters based on their size (< This resulted in 403 and 373 AGO-associated stem-loops derived from human and mouse mRNAs, respectively (Table S6) . We intersected our list of AGO-associated stem-loops derived from human mRNAs with recently identified miRNAs in humans from extensive smRNA-seq or from DICER photoactivatableribonucleoside-enhanced crosslinking and immunoprecipitation (PAR-CLIP) (26, 55) . In fact, 12 of our AGO-associated stem-loops were annotated as novel miRNAs in these lists supporting the ability of our approach to identify novel miRNAs (Fig. 5A) . Furthermore, 34 and 37 AGO-associated stem-loops overlapped with DICER and DGCR8 binding sites respectively, revealing that a number of the AGO-associated stem-loops derived from mRNAs interact with other components of the canonical miRNA processing pathway (55, 56) .

We observed robust knockdown of both DROSHA and DGCR8 protein levels (Fig. 5H) . Consistent with the role of DROSHA in regulating DGCR8 expression, we found that knockdown of DROSHA increased DGCR8 protein and RNA expression (Fig. 5H-I) . To determine whether DGCR8 and/or DROSHA participate in the regulation of AGO-associated stem-loop containing mRNAs, we performed mRNA-seq and RT-qPCR on knockdown RNA samples. To our surprise, the majority of mRNAs hosting AGO-associated stemloops were unaffected by knockdown of components of the microprocessor.

In fact, the only gene tested by RT-qPCR that was significantly affected was GLUL, but knockdown of either DGCR8 or DROSHA decreased the level of GLUL expression, in contrast to the expected role of the microprocessor. These data suggest that cleavage of AGO-associated stemloops does not have a significant impact on the expression of the host mRNA because cleavage events are rare, or because this process is independent of the microprocessor, with neither model being mutually exclusive.",

However, when we calculated the MPAR scores for AGO-associated stem-loops derived from mRNAs, we found that they had overall very low scores, indicating that they are poor substrates for producing mature AGO-bound smRNAs (Figs. 6C and S6E-F and Table S8 ). This is in agreement with the finding that these elements are more commonly oligo-tailed compared to canonical pre-miRNAs. In fact, we only found a total of 171 miRNAseq reads mapping to AGO-associated stem-loops derived from human mRNAs and the majority of these reads mapped to the recently identified miRNAs embedded within the mRNAs; GNAS, GLUL, and E2F1 (26,55) (example of .

Pre-miRNA-seq reads that did not map to miRBase were filtered on ncRNA and repeat-masker (RMSK), trimmed to 35 nt and mapped to spliced mRNA sequences. These alignments were then extended to find all matching bases.
