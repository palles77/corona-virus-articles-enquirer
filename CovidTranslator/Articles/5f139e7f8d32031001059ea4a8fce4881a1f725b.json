These implications include how we might modify practice for standard cardiac patients, those who are suspected COVID-19 patients, and those patients with COVID-19 who have either unrelated cardiac conditions or cardiac manifestations of the disease. It merits emphasis that this is a dynamic situation and one for which there are limited data. In addition, local conditions may vary considerably. The purpose of this joint statement from the ACC Interventional Council and SCAI is to discuss issues facing catheterization laboratory personnel during this time.",

In addition, the definition of truly elective requires clinical judgement, because in some cases deferral of patients may have independent deleterious effects. However, examples of procedures to defer include: a) PCI for stable ischemic heart disease, b) endovascular intervention for ilio-femoral disease in claudicants, or c) PFO closure. Case decisions should be individualized, taking into account the risk of COVID-19 exposure versus the risk of delay in diagnosis or therapy.",

However, in the patient with known COVID-19 and STEMI, the balance of staff exposure and patient benefit will need to be weighed carefully. Fibrinolysis can be considered an option for the relatively stable STEMI patient with active COVID-19. In patients with active COVID-19 in whom primary PCI is to be performed, appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) should be worn including gown, gloves, goggles (or shields), and a N95 mask, especially given the limited ability to take a history from the patient as well as the potential for clinical deterioration in STEMI cases. The use of Powered Air Purifying Respirator (PAPR) systems may also be reasonable, especially for patients who may be vomiting (e.g. inferior STEMI), or those who may require CPR and/or intubation. Importantly, the vast number of catheterization labs have either normal or positive ventilation systems and are not designed for infection isolation. Therefore, catheterization labs will require a terminal clean following the procedure leading to delays for subsequent procedures.",

            "text": "For most patients with NSTEMI and suspected COVID-19, timing should allow for diagnostic testing for COVID-19 prior to cardiac catheterization, and allow for a more informed decision regarding infection control. Rapid discharge of patients with primary NSTEMI following revascularization will likely be important in terms of maximizing bed availability and reducing patient exposure within the hospital. Follow-up through telehealth venues could be satisfactory in most cases. It has been suggested that in appropriately selected cases of patients with known COVID-19 and NSTEMI, (e.g., particularly for patients with type 2 MI) conservative therapy may be sufficient based on the patient's risk. It is important to note that recent reports suggest that acute cardiac injury is present in ~7% of patients with COVID-19 and may represent either type 2 MI or myocarditis (3) . All of these factors need to be taken into account when weighing risks and benefits vis-\u00e0-vis infection control. Efforts should be made to try to differentiate between these Type 2 MIs vs. \"primary\" acute coronary syndromes, with consideration of deferral of invasive management in the former, especially if the patient is hemodynamically stable. Unstable NSTEMI patients whose instability is due to the acute coronary syndrome (rather than other factors) may be considered under the STEMI rubric outlined above.",

Patients who are already intubated pose less of a transmission risk to staff given that their ventilation is managed through a closed circuit. Patients with COVID-19 or suspected COVID-19 requiring intubation should be intubated prior to arrival to the catheterization laboratory. Further, the threshold to consider intubation in a patient with borderline respiratory status may need to be lowered in order to avoid emergent intubation in the catheterization laboratory. Some institutions have suggested using a HEPA filter between tube and bag if staff are bagging an intubated patient, as bag ventilation can increase aerosolization. Other considerations are to use closed circuit BIPAP machines if intubation not available. Close coordination with critical care, ID, and anesthesia teams in airway management will be critical to avoid spread of infection.",

Despite measures to reduce exposure, staff shortages should be anticipated based on both the possibility of infected/exposed/quarantined staff as well as the derivative impact on staff due to school closings which will put a strain on home, dependent, and child-care resources. Specific consideration to subspecialty care teams may be required, with separation of individuals with overlapping skillsets (e.g. avoidance of two structural heart interventionalists being in the same care area simultaneously). Given the infectious risk of transporting patients from wards to the catheterization lab, some procedures routinely done in the catheterization laboratory should be considered for bedside performance. Examples include pulmonary artery catheter placement, pericardiocentesis, and intra-aortic balloon pump insertion. As mentioned above, the vast number of catheterization labs have either normal or positive ventilation systems and are not designed for infection isolation. Given the need for terminal cleaning following procedures on suspected or known COVID-19 patients, these cases should be done at the end of the working day if possible.",
