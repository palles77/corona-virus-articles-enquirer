The non-structural protein 3D plays an important role in FMDV replication and pathogenesis. However, the interaction partners of 3D, and the effects of those interactions on FMDV replication, remain incompletely elucidated. In the present study, using the yeast two-hybrid system, we identified a porcine cell protein, DEAD-box RNA helicase 1 (DDX1), which interacted with FMDV 3D. The DDX1-3D interaction was further confirmed by co-immunoprecipitation experiments and an indirect immunofluorescence assay (IFA) in porcine kidney 15 (PK-15) cells. DDX1 was reported to either inhibit or facilitate viral replication and regulate host innate immune responses. However, the roles of DDX1 during FMDV infection remain unclear. Our results revealed that DDX1 inhibited FMDV replication in an ATPase/helicase activity-dependent manner. In addition, DDX1 stimulated IFN-b activation in FMDV-infected cells. Together, our results expand the body of knowledge regarding the role of DDX1 in FMDV infection.",

The proteins VP0, VP1, VP3, L pro , 2B, 3A, and 3C pro play roles in inhibiting the host innate immune response (Li et al. , 2016a Zhu et al. 2016; Fan et al. 2017; Rodriguez Pulido and Saiz 2017; Rodriguez Pulido and Sanchez-Aparicio 2018) . Additionally, host cell proteins that interact with VP1, 2B, 2C, and 3A have been identified using the yeast two-hybrid system (Gladue et al. 2012 (Gladue et al. , 2014 Liu et al. 2017 Liu et al. , 2018 . 3D is an important viral protein that has multiple roles in FMDV replication and pathogenesis (Rai et al. 2013; Herod et al. 2016; Rai et al. 2017 ). An interaction between the host factor Sam68 and 3D has been reported (Rai et al. 2015) . To better understand the role of FMDV 3D in viral replication and virulence, we sought to identify new host cell proteins that interact with 3D using the yeast two-hybrid system. DEAD-box RNA helicases (DDX) are a family of putative RNA helicases that contain eight conserved amino acid motifs. They play important roles in the regulation of RNA metabolism, including transcription, pre-mRNA processing, RNA decay, RNA export, ribosome biogenesis, and translation (Rocak and Linder 2004) . DDX1 is a member of the DEAD-box RNA helicase family, and can inhibit or facilitate viral replication (Edgcomb et al. 2012; Zhou et al. 2017) .

DDX1, a dsRNA sensor, can activate type I IFN responses through the TRIF pathway (Zhang et al. 2011) . Thus, DDX1 may be involved in the activation of innate immune signaling pathways during viral infection. A recent study confirmed that DDX1 is involved in TGEV nsp14-induced IFN-b production (Zhou et al. 2017) . Based on the results in the present study, we suggest that DDX1 is also involved in FMDV-induced type I IFN production.

Our results are consistent with DDX1 being a mediator of FMDV-induced type I IFN production. However, the DDX1-DGAD mutant suppresses FMDV replication, indicating that DDX1 may exert its anti-FMDV effect through multiple mechanisms. In addition, our results confirmed the interaction between FMDV 3D and the DDX1-DGAD mutant (Supplementary Figure S1) , suggesting that the conserved DEAD-box motif is not essential for the 3D-DDX1 interaction. This finding suggests that the 3D-DDX1 interaction may not affect the ATPase/helicase activity of DDX1 or DDX1-induced signaling pathways.",
