These formulations can be continuous or discrete, deterministic or stochastic, or spatially homogeneous or heterogeneous, the latter often embracing a network formulation. Here we review the continuous and discrete deterministic and discrete stochastic formulations of the SEIR dynamical systems models, and we outline how they can be easily and rapidly constructed using the Numerus Model Builder, a graphicallydriven coding platform. We also demonstrate how to extend these models to a metapopulation setting using both the Numerus Model Builder network and geographical mapping tools.",

Individuals in class E then transfer, after a period of latency, into the class of infectious individuals, I, only to trans-fer on recovery or death to a removed class R. The recovered individuals may have some temporary, though possibly long term, immunity (V) and death (D) can arise from both natural and disease-induced causes (i.e., R=V+D). Variations and elaboration of the the SEIR process may include birth and death processes, other demographic class such as age [2] and sex [3] , spatial structure [4, 5] , and the genetic structure of hosts and pathogens [6, 7] . Further, stochastic formulations of SEIR models [8, 9] are increasingly being used to explore the inherent and very important stochastic aspects of epidemics including, probabilities of fadeouts versus breakouts in the early stages of epidemics, and logistical planning necessary for managing epidemics of uncertain ultimate size.",

His results have been considerably extended to elaborated SEIR models that include more complex characterizations of births and of deaths, and some age-structure -with a strong focus in the mathematics literature on the existence and stability of outbreak and endemic equilibria [11] . Analyses of stochastic SEIR models and elaborations remain more challenging, though some analytical results do exist. Most stochastic analyses, however, are computationally intensive and the results numerical rather than analytical. In addition, unlike deterministic SEIR models which are readily fitted to data, it remains a challenge to fit stochastic models to data, with new approaches involving concepts well beyond first courses in calculus or linear algebra.",

In the discrete-time formulation, a competing rates approach is used to derive transition proportions p, with identifying subscripts, as described in the text. out, we use the roman font S, E, I, V and D to name the class itself and the italic font S, E, I, V and D to refer to the variables representing the number of individuals in the corresponding classes. The assumption of homogeneity implies that age and sex structure are ignored. We incorporate population spatial structure-as would be found in countries comprising of a network of cities, towns, and villages-into a metapopulation framework [15, 18] , if we assume that a set of homogeneous subpopulations can be organized into a network of subpopulations, among which individuals move in a fashion that reflects appropriate movement rates (e.g., propensity to move as a function of age and sex [19] )and geographical factors (e.g., distances, geographical barriers, desirability of possible destinations). If the time scales of the epidemic and movement processes among subpopulations, including disease induced mortality, are much faster than the time scale of the background population demography (births, recruitment, natural mortality and population level migration) then we can ignore the demography; otherwise we cannot. For example, in the case of influenza, epidemiological and local movement processes involve noticeable changes at the scale of weeks, while demographic changes in the underlying population itself (beyond epidemic disease induced death rates) are obvious only at the scale of years. In this case, we can ignore natural births and deaths, and focus on epidemic processes alone.",

Thus to further reduce the dimension of the optimization problem, we set \u03c3 = \u03b3 during the optimization procedure. Further, we also fixed \u00b5 and \u03b3 (which in problems like this can be estimated outside of the incidence data) to 0.001 and 0.05 respectively, as well as setting \u03bb = \u03bd = 0. A more rigorous fitting of the Sierra Leone data would need these parameters to be properly estimated ahead of time, but our purpose here is to demonstrate different aspects of the fitting procedure, rather than undertaking an in depth analysis of the epidemic itself.",

In general, we should not expect and SEIR model to fit the data particularly well because many of the assumptions inherent in the SEIR model, as discussed in the previous section, are violated to some oftenunknown and likely-large degree.",

Thus the errors associated with this estimation can be quite large, and require a Bayesian type Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) approach to estimate them. Further, as is evident from our plots in Figure 8B , if we use the first T weeks of data, T = 10, 20, 30, and 40,to fit the model, we see that fitting the first 10 weeks (red curve) greatly overestimates the final size of the epidemic, while fitting the first 20 weeks somewhat underestimates the final number of cases. Before leaving this example, we note that in several runs of the optimization algorithm, different starting conditions converged to different solutions, thereby indicating that some of these solutions are local rather than global minimum. When this happened, we selected the solution that gave the lowest log-likelihood value, but our searches were not sufficiently exhaustive for us to be sure that we had found the global minimum for each case.",

As with all models of complex biological systems centered around organisms, populations or communities, the answer is the same: models provide a framework for obtaining insights into dynamic population processes that could not be obtained without them. Further, they provide a means for exploring and assessing the efficacy of interventions and other types of management actions designed to protect, conserve, or exploit the populations under consideration. In the context of epidemics this has certainly been true with regard to implementing vaccination [17, 62, 63] and quarantine programs [64] , assessing the effects of behavior [65] , case detection [66] , and treatment rates [67, 68] , managing the logistics of setting up treatment facilities during the course of All rights reserved.

Although, after 10 weeks, a fit to the Sierra Leone data set would have substantially underestimated the problem at hand, the fit at 20 weeks provided a much better ball park assessment of the final size of the Sierra Leone outbreak than could have been obtained with non dynamic modeling efforts. This remained somewhat true at 30 weeks and certainly so at 40 weeks, despite all the known serious violations of an SEIR model applied to an inhomogeneous, spatially-structured population. Thus SEIR models remain an important tool for managing epidemics, provided we treat predictions from such models with circumspection. [8] Allen LJ.
