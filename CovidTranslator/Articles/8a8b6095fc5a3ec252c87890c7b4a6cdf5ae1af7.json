During the past year many important research results were published in nanomedicine research areas. The significance of these investigations lies in the development of platform technologies including nanoscale molecular imaging, drug delivery, gene delivery, and diagnostic approaches. Dendrimer-based nanomedicine was developed for protein mimicry research, nanopharmaceuticals, diagnostic imaging with contrast agents, and targeted drug delivery in cancer cells. Biosensors with nanoscale materials provide unique and powerful technology for detection of biological and chemical species to aid in disease diagnosis and in the discovery and screening of new drug molecules. The development of a cancer therapy and monitoring with diagnostic nanotechnology include cancer-related genotyping detection, gene expression, and immunochemical analysis, as well as nearly real-time monitoring of patient blood for cancer cells. Nanotechnologies were developed for clinical applications in cardiovascular, neurological, pulmonary, skin, and renal diseases.",

AQP water channel proteins permit high water permeability of certain biological membranes. In people with no AQP1, lack of water causes defective urine concentration and reduced fluid exchange between capillary and interstitium in lung. Mutations in the gene encoding AQP0, expressed in lens fiber cells, result in familial cataracts. Mutations in the gene encoding AQP2, expressed in renal collecting duct principal cells, result in nephrogenic diabetes insipidus. Mistargeting of AQP5, normally expressed in the apical membranes of salivery and lacrimal gland acini, can occur in SjogrenTs syndrome. Aquaporins also are implicated in brain edema and muscular dystrophy (AQP4), anhidrosis (AQP5), renal tubular acidosis (AQP6), conversion of glycerol to glucose during starvation (AQP7 and AQP9), and cystic fibrosis (several).

Image reconstruction methods can be used to reconstruct three-dimensional (3-D structures from single nanomachine images at sub-nanometer resolution. Mining of salient structural features within the molecular components of a large nanomachine is a daunting task. Computational and visualization tools have been developed to extract features such as a-helices and b-sheets of protein subunits with a high degree of reliability. 3-D structure at sub-nanometer resolution can be combined with sequence-based structure prediction methods to derive pseudo atomic models of molecular components of a nanomachine. Dr. Chiu received the Presidential Award from AANM (Figure 4 , B).",

Protein misfolding is a complex phenomenon that can be facilitated, impeded, or prevented by interactions with various intracellular metabolites and interprotein interaction with intracellular nanomachines controlling protein folding. A fundamental understanding of molecular processes leading to misfolding and self-aggregation of proteins will provide critical information to help identify appropriate therapeutic routes to control these processes. Protein misfolding is the very fist link in this long chain of events eventually leading to neurodegeneration. Therefore, availability of methods capable of detecting the pathological protein conformations facilitates the development of novel tools for diagnostic and treating the diseases at very early stages of development. Single-molecule force spectroscopy atomic force microscope was proposed to measure the strength of the interprotein interactions before aggregation [3, 4] . The capability of the atomic force microscope to manipulate with the tip in the nanometer scale was used for development of the nanotweezers approach capable of single-molecule selecting of antibodies for a certain type of protein aggregates.",

To investigate the link between complex I impairment and sequence-specific, post-translational modifications of a-synuclein, the protein was isolated from rotenone-treated PC12 cells and analyzed by tandem mass spectrometry [5] . It was found that rotenone induced various modifications in the C-terminal region of a-synuclein, including oxidation of methionine, nitration and amination of tyrosine, and phosphorylation of tyrosine and serine. These modifications correlated with an increase in the levels of membrane-bound, oligomeric a-synuclein detectable by fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy and lipid flotation. In parallel, it was found that a-synuclein aggregation and toxicity were suppressed by DJ-1, an antioxidant protein that is dysfunctional in some cases of familial Parkinson disease. A current goal in nanomedicine is to determine how the conformational behavior of a-synuclein is influenced by sequence-specific modifications using single-molecule approaches.",

These polymers incorporate poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) into their backbone structure and are polymerized with one to several other monomers, such as sebacic acid (SA), that are also known to be safe in humans. The addition of PEG to the polymer backbone allows classical poly(anhydrides) to be formulated into nanoparticles that are readily resuspended in liquids for injection or inhalation, or into dry powder microparticles that are easily aerosolized for inhalation. PEG coats the surface of the particles naturally during particle preparation, allowing the linkage of targeting agents to the free end of PEG (i.e., end not attached to the rest of the polymer). Highly selective targeting of poly(PEG-SA) particles to inflamed blood vessels was demonstrated following the attachment of antibodies against molecules that are upregulated on the luminal side of inflamed endothelial cells in a collaboration with Prof. Doug Goetz from the Ohio University. Poly(PEG-SA) nanoparticles (with transferrin attached to the free end of PEG) were also able to penetrate targeted cancer cells and rapidly transit within the cell to the perinuclear region; these particles were more toxic to cancer cells at relevant doses than the free drug.",

Microbubbles (hollow microspheres with a shell composed of albumin) are currently used clinically as a contrast agent in diagnostic ultrasound. Dr. Price showed that ultrasound can be used at low frequencies to cause bubbles in targeted regions to explode (by cavitation), which causes a significant increase in the local permeability of the endothelium to drugs and even large particles. Highly targeted delivery of polymer nanoparticles to muscle tissue was clearly demonstrated in an animal model. Control over particle penetration depth was achieved by simply applying ultrasound without microbubbles, in which case particles penetrated only the endothelium and not into the interstitium, whereas the application of ultrasound with microbubbles led to particle delivery to both the endothelium and the interstitium. The results suggest that this technique may provide an alternative to molecular targeting for a variety of diseases.",

Furthermore, through quantitative polymerase chain reaction, immunohistochemistry, and proteomic studies the team showed that silver nanoparticles exerted positive effects through their antimicrobial properties, reduction in wound inflammation, and modulation of fibrogenetic cytokines. These results have given an insight into the actions of silver and provided a novel therapeutic direction for wound treatment in clinical practice.

Arrays of nanopillars, which are 200 nm wide and 4,000 nm tall, are successfully applicable to fast separation of DNA within 10 to 25 seconds. Nanoball, with a diameter of 50 nm, has been developed and successfully applied for fast separation of DNA fragments from 100 base pairs to 15 kilobase pairs. Bacteria cellulose, a biofiber with a diameter of 50 nm, has been found to be a useful in highly sensitive detection of biomolecules based on the optical confined effect.

The bioactive molecule that is thus generated acts as a biochemical trigger; it can be a hormone, a neurotransmitter, a second messenger, or an enzyme modulator. Therefore, in combination with focused light pulses, caged molecules represent a simple methodology for manipulating biology in living cells or tissues with excellent temporal and spatial resolution. Specific applications of the technology to manipulate neurotransmission at single synapses and to stimulate single nerve terminals were discussed.",
