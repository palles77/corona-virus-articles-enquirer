            "text": "Myocardial infarction triggers an inflammatory reaction that is involved in cardiac remodeling. Cardiac repair is dependent on regulatory mechanisms that suppress inflammation and prevent excessive matrix degradation. Chemokine induction in the infarcted heart mediates recruitment of leukocyte subsets with distinct properties. We demonstrate that signaling through the CC chemokine receptor 5 (CCR5) prevents uncontrolled postinfarction inflammation and protects from adverse remodeling by recruiting suppressive mononuclear cells. CCR5 and its ligands macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP)\u060a1\u2423 and MIP-1\u2424 were markedly induced in the infarcted mouse myocardium. In addition, almost 40% of the mononuclear cells infiltrating the infarct expressed CCR5. CCR5 \u060a/\u060a mice exhibited marked upregulation of proinflammatory cytokine and chemokine expression in the infarct. In wildtype infarcts CCR5 \u0609 mononuclear cells had antiinflammatory properties, expressing higher levels of IL-10 than CCR5 \u060a cells. In contrast, mononuclear cells isolated from CCR5 \u060a/\u060a infarcts had reduced IL-10 expression. Moreover, enhanced inflammation in the absence of CCR5 was associated with impaired recruitment of CD4 \u0609 /foxp3 \u0609 regulatory T cells (Tregs). The CCR5 \u0609 Treg subset exhibited increased IL-10 expression, reflecting potent anti-inflammatory activity. Accentuated inflammation in CCR5 \u060a/\u060a infarcts was associated with increased matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) expression, reduced TIMP levels, and enhanced MMP-2 and MMP-9 activity, resulting in worse cardiac dilation. These results suggest that CCR5-mediated Treg recruitment may restrain postinfarction inflammation, preventing excessive matrix degradation and attenuating adverse remodeling.",

            "text": "Leukocyte trafficking in sites of inflammation is governed by chemokines. Most chemokines bind to extracellular matrix molecules or are immobilized in the luminal endothelial cell surface, 1 which mediates inflammatory cell transmigration through ligation of G protein-coupled chemokine receptors expressed on leukocytes. Differential expression of chemokine receptors by monocyte and lymphocyte subsets determines their homing in inflamed tissues 2,3 resulting in infiltration with subpopulations with distinct functional properties. Emerging evidence suggests important roles for various mononuclear cell subsets, recruited through distinct chemokine-mediated pathways in tissue inflammation and repair. 4, 5 Healing of myocardial infarction is dependent on a chemokine-driven inflammatory response that ultimately results in replacement of dead cardiomyocytes with collagen-based scar. 6 Infiltration of the infarcted myocardium with leukocytes is associated with activation of proteases and extensive degradation of the cardiac extracellular matrix, resulting in chamber dilation and adverse ventricular remodeling. Dilative remodeling is a poor prognostic indicator in patients with myocardial infarction and is associated with ventricular arrhythmias, the development of heart failure, and increased mortality. Chemokine signaling through the receptors CCR1 and CCR2 appears to promote injury and chamber dilation after myocardial infarction. 7 Disruption of the CCL2/ CCR2 axis, or CCR1 deficiency, results in reduced inflammation and attenuated protease activity, protecting the infarcted heart from the development of adverse re-modeling. 8 -10 The effects of CCR2 signaling are mediated through the selective recruitment of the Ly-6Chi subset of monocytes that exhibit enhanced phagocytic, proteolytic, and proinflammatory properties. 5 We have previously demonstrated that CCR5 and its ligands macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP)\u03ea1\u2423/ CCL3 and MIP-1\u2424/CCL4 are markedly induced in murine myocardial infarcts. 9, 11 Because CCR5 signaling may be responsible for recruitment of distinct mononuclear cell subsets in the infarcted heart, we examined the effects of CCR5 deficiency on infarct healing and cardiac remodeling. Surprisingly, in contrast to CCR1 and CCR2 mutants, CCR5-null mice exhibited enhanced inflammation, accentuated matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) expression, and increased dilative remodeling after reperfused myocardial infarction. Defective control of the postinfarction inflammatory response in CCR5 \u03ea/\u03ea animals was associated with impaired recruitment of CCR5 \u03e9 foxp3 \u03e9 regulatory T cells (Tregs), a CD4 \u03e9 lymphocyte subset with potent anti-inflammatory properties. Our findings suggest that chemokine signaling through CCR5 prevents uncontrolled inflammation in the infarcted myocardium attenuating matrix degradation and adverse cardiac remodeling.",

Cells were then passed through a 40-m nylon mesh (BD Falcon), centrifuged (10 minutes, 500g, 4\u00b0C), and resuspended in 0.1% sodium azide solution in HBSS without Ca 2\u03e9 and Mg 2\u03e9 . Consecutively, two volumes of the cell suspension were layered on top of one volume of 15% w/v iodixanol Opti-Prep (Axis-Shield) at density of 1.084 g/ml and centrifuged (20 minutes, 750g, 20\u00b0C). Mononuclear cells were harvested from interphase, diluted with HBSS with 0.1% sodium azide (1:3 v/v), and centrifuged (10 minutes, 500g, 4\u00b0C) to remove iodixanol. Finally, cells were reconstituted with staining buffer (dPBS without Ca 2\u03e9 and Mg 2\u03e9 , 2% FBS, 0.1% sodium azide) and counted using Trypan blue (Sigma Aldrich). The mean and SEM for live cell recoveries were 2.15 \u03ee 0.3 \u03eb 10 6 /heart versus 2.2 \u03ee 0.5 \u03eb 10 6 /heart in wild-type and KO infarcts respectively (pNS).",

CXC chemokines containing the ELR motif play an important role in recruitment of neutrophils, 20 whereas the CC chemokine MCP-1/CCL2 is critically involved in infiltration of the infarct with monocytes. 9 Disruption of the MCP-1/CCR2 axis results in attenuated inflammation and reduced adverse remodeling, 9 possibly by preventing infiltration with proteolytic and proinflammatory CCR2 \u03e9 monocytes. 5 We present the first evidence suggesting that a chemokine-mediated pathway may play a role in suppression of the postinfarction inflammatory response. Our study demonstrates that, in contrast to animals with CCR1 or CCR2 disruption, CCR5-null mice exhibit worse adverse remodeling associated with enhanced inflammatory activity after myocardial infarction. CCR5 absence resulted in impairment of the endogenous mechanisms involved in suppression of postinfarction inflammation, markedly reducing infiltration of the infarct with suppressive Tregs. Defective control of inflammation was associated with increased proinflammatory cytokine expression (Figure 3) , shifting the balance of MMP:TIMP expression toward enhanced matrix degradation, increasing MMP activity, and leading to accentuated adverse remodeling ( Figure 7) . Evidence on the role of CCR5 signaling in immune responses is contradictory. Several studies have demonstrated a role for CCR5 in suppression of immunoinflammatory processes. CCR5-null mice displayed accentuated pulmonary inflammation and increased mortality on infection with influenza A virus 21 and had an enhanced delayed type hypersensitivity reaction suggesting a role for CCR5 in downmodulating T cell-dependent immune responses. 22 In addition, CCR5 \u03ea/\u03ea animals developed an exacerbated form of crescentic glomerulonephritis associated with increased mortality and enhanced recruitment of T cells and monocytes. 23 Absence of CCR5 was also associated with the induction of CD8 \u03e9 T cellmediated immunopathology leading to marked hepatic steatosis in viral hepatic inflammation. 24 In contrast, other investigations suggested that CCR5 signaling may enhance inflammatory activity. CCR5-deficient animals exhibited reduced macrophage infiltration in the brain after infection with neurotropic coronavirus. 25 Huffnagle et al showed that CCR5 \u03ea/\u03ea mice have defects in macrophage infiltration in the brain, but not in the lung, on infection with Cryptococcus neoformans, 26 suggesting that CCR5 may have organ-specific defects in leukocyte trafficking. Our study demonstrates that although CCR5 does not play a crucial role in monocyte recruitment in the infarcted myocardium, its absence is associated with markedly enhanced proinflammatory cytokine expression through impaired recruitment of leukocyte subsets with suppressive properties.",

To address this question, we first examined whether CCR5 mediates infiltration of the infarct with monocyte subsets that possess antiinflammatory properties. Nahrendorf and coworkers have recently demonstrated that mouse myocardial infarcts are sequentially infiltrated by two distinct monocyte subpopulations. 5 Ly-6C hi monocytes are recruited during the inflammatory phase of healing; these cells express CCR2 and exert potent phagocytic and proteolytic effects secreting large amounts of cytokines. Ly-6C lo/ CCR2-negative monocytes, on the other hand, infiltrate the myocardium during the reparative phase and promote healing by stimulating myofibroblast accumulation and angiogenesis. 5 In wild-type mice we identified a sizeable population of CCR5-expressing cells that infiltrate the infarcted myocardium accounting for almost 40% of the CD45 \u03e9 hematopoietic cells in the infarct (Figure 4 ). This CCR5 \u03e9 subpopulation of mononuclear cells exhibited increased expression of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 in comparison with the CCR5 \u03ea subset ( Figure 5 ). In addition, CCR5 gene disruption resulted in markedly enhanced upregulation of proinflammatory cytokines in the infarcted myocardium ( Figure 3 ) associated with reduced expression of inhibitory cytokines in mononuclear cells isolated from the infarct ( Figure 5 ). Thus, CCR5 expression appears to identify mononuclear cell subsets with anti-inflammatory properties.",

Several lines of evidence suggest that CCR5 may regulate immune responses by mediating recruitment of Tregs, a CD4 \u03e9 subpopulation of T cells with an essential role in immunological homeostasis and self-tolerance. 27 CCR5 signaling was essential for homing of tumor-associated Tregs in a model of pancreatic cancer 14 and was a key regulatory signal in migration of Tregs to the site of Paracoccidioides infection. 28 In addition, the CCR5 axis is critically involved in Treg recruitment in chronic intestinal inflammation 15 and directs homing of Tregs to Leishma-",

Although the role of Tregs in restraining autoimmunity and in providing protection from the immune response to infection is well-documented, their involvement in tissue repair after ischemic injury has not been investigated. We identified a sizeable population of Tregs in the infarcted myocardium (Figure 4) , as CD4 \u03e9 cells expressing foxp3, a transcription factor restricted to Tregs and indispensable for their differentiation. 30 Almost half of the CCR5 \u03e9 /CD4 \u03e9 cells infiltrating the infarct were identified as foxp3-expressing Tregs, whereas the majority of CCR5 \u03ea /CD4 \u03e9 T cells were foxp3negative ( Figure 4 ). Thus, in the population of CD4 \u03e9 T cells infiltrating the infarct, CCR5 expression was preferentially found in Tregs. Two lines of evidence suggested a crucial role for CCR5 in recruitment of Tregs in the infarcted heart. First, foxp3 mRNA expression levels were markedly reduced in CCR5-null infarcts ( Figure 6A ). Second, CCR5 absence was associated with significantly lower numbers of foxp3 \u03e9 T cells in the mononuclear infiltrate of the infarct ( Figure 6 ). Reduced infiltration with Tregs appears to abrogate regulatory signals that suppress inflammation in the infarcted heart. The molecular pathways responsible for Treg-mediated suppression of the immunoinflammatory response remain unknown. Although in vitro studies have demonstrated that Treg-mediated suppression requires direct cell contact, several in vivo investigations have suggested an essential role for secreted mediators, such as IL-10 and TGF-\u2424. 31, 32 Rubtsov and coworkers 33 have recently demonstrated that, although Treg-derived IL-10 synthesis was not required to prevent systemic autoimmunity, it was essential for protection from localized immune responses at environmental interfaces. Although the mechanisms involved in mediating the anti-inflammatory effects of Tregs in the healing infarct remain unknown, these cells may use multiple suppression mechanisms to control various aspects of inflammation. 33 Timely resolution of inflammation appears to be essential for prevention of adverse remodeling after myocardial infarction. 34, 35 Uncontrolled postinfarction inflammation may promote adverse remodeling through several distinct mechanisms. First, proinflammatory cytokines may enhance MMP synthesis, 36, 37 increasing matrix degradation in the infarcted heart. Second, inflammatory mediators, such as TNF-\u2423 and IL-1\u2424, may enhance cardiomyocyte apoptosis in the remodeling myocardium. 38 Third, proinflammatory cytokine signaling may suppress contractility accentuating ventricular systolic dysfunction. 39 Our findings demonstrated that although accentuated inflammation in CCR5-null mice did not affect the size of the infarct (Figure 7E) , it was associated with increased MMP expression and activity (Figure 7 , H-L). Thus, in the absence of CCR5 enhanced matrix degradation may result in adverse dilative remodeling of the infarcted ventricle.Our study identifies a chemokine-mediated mechanism responsible for suppression of the postinfarction inflammatory response and for protection from adverse remodeling after myocardial infarction. CCR5 signaling is an important molecular pathway controlling the postinfarction inflammatory response through the recruitment of Tregs. Infiltration of the infarct with regulatory T cells appears to provide essential inhibitory signals that prevent excessive inflammatory activity in the infarcted heart. Thus, pharmacological interventions or cell therapy enhancing the suppressive actions of Tregs after infarction may be promising new therapeutic strategies.",
