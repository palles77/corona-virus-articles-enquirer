            "text": "Wild Canis species such as the coyote (C. latrans) express a suite of reproductive traits unusual among mammals, including perennial pair-bonds and paternal care of the young. Coyotes also are monestrous, and both sexes are fertile only in winter; thus, they depend upon social and physiologic synchrony for successful reproduction. To investigate the mutability of seasonal reproduction in coyotes, we attempted to evoke an out-of-season estrus in October using one of two short-acting gonadotropinreleasing hormone (GnRH) agents: (1) a GnRH analogue, deslorelin (6-D-tryptophan-9-(N-ethyl-L-prolinamide)-10-deglycinamide), 2.1 mg pellet sc; or (2) gonadorelin, a GnRH (5-oxoPro-His-Trp-Ser-Tyr-Gly-Leu-Arg-Pro-GlyNH 2 ) porcine hypothalamic extract, 2.0 mg/kg im once daily for 3 consecutive days. A transient increase in serum concentrations of estradiol and progesterone (1 and 2 wk, respectively) was detected after treatment with deslorelin but not gonadorelin. Also, socio-sexual behaviors reminiscent of winter mating (including courtship, mate-guarding, precoital mounts, and copulatory ties) were observed among the deslorelin group. During the subsequent breeding season (January and February), however, preovulatory courtship behavior and olfactory sampling appeared suppressed; emergence of mounts and copulations were delayed in both deslorelin and gonadorelin treatment groups. Furthermore, whereas 8 of 12 females treated in October ovulated and produced healthy litters in the spring, 4 na\u00efve coyotes failed to copulate or become pregnant. Thus, perturbation of hormones prior to ovulation in species with complex mating behaviors may disrupt critical intrapair relationships, even if fertility is not impaired physiologically. #",

            "text": "Coyotes (Canis latrans) are indigenous wild canids widely distributed throughout North America. They are socially monogamous, territorial [1] [2] [3] , and seasonally monestrous [4] [5] [6] [7] . Both sexes are obligated to a single breeding season, extending January to March (depending on latitude), and become sexually inactive in the summer [4] [5] [6] . Spermatogenesis in coyotes begins late October or November, and mature spermatozoa may be found from December to May [4, 5, [8] [9] [10] . Meanwhile, ovaries from coyotes examined in January contain tertiary follicles, but cortices were otherwise unremarkable (without stigmata or ruptures). Ovulation is spontaneous, synchronous, and bilateral; thereafter, ovaries are dominated by corpora lutea [4, 6] and nonpregnant females enter a compulsory pseudopregnancy [11] . Coyote pups are www.theriojournal.com Available online at www.sciencedirect.com Theriogenology 72 (2009) [773] [774] [775] [776] [777] [778] [779] [780] [781] [782] [783] typically born March to May, after a gestation of 60 to 63 d [4, 5] , and both parents care for the young [1, 2, 5] . By July or August, ovaries are regressive but not yet fully regenerated, testes have atrophied, and epididymides are void of mature sperm [4, 5] . Accordingly, endocrine profiles supported the histologic evidence that coyote reproduction was confined to a singular seasonal event [7, 10, 11] .",

Male domestic dogs are fertile year-round, and bitches are typically aseasonal, with an interestrus interval 5 to 12 mo in duration [16] . A seasonal shift in reproductive recrudescence also was reported among first generation (F1) coyote-dog hybrids. Specifically, F1 hybrid offspring became sexually active in the fall (October to December) [5, 8, [17] [18] [19] , and one female bred again in May [5] . Variability in reproductive strategies of wild canids has been ascribed to changes in social or environmental conditions, particularly within genera other than Canis [20] [21] [22] . Thus, canid reproductive tactics appeared to be adaptive, capable of responding to alterations in selective pressures or environmental conditions.",

Seasonal changes in environmental factors act as cues allowing an animal to coordinate arrival of offspring with availability of critical resources. Photoperiod activates neuroendocrine messengers, which in turn stimulate a cascade of physiologic and behavioral events; however, receptors vary in sensitivity depending on photoperiod and sequence of exposure to hormones [23] [24] [25] [26] . In female coyotes, for example, Hodges [10] reported that in vitro cultures of pituitary cells showed a dose-dependent seasonal difference in sensitivity to gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH). Pituitary cells collected from coyotes in winter produced significantly more luteinizing hormone than cells harvested in April to October, but only when challenged with higher doses of GnRH.",

Two short-acting agents were employed, because the sensitivity of a purebred coyote to treatment protocols used in domestic dogs could not be predicted.

Concurrently, differences in hormone concentrations between successive weeks, and weekly intergroup comparisons (least square means: Bonferroni correction) analyses were performed. A variance ratio test was used to compare behaviors (courtship, olfactory sampling, precoital mounts, copulatory ties, and mate-guarding) of treatment pair-mates to colony mating behaviors. Unless otherwise noted, we assumed a level of statistical significance of P < 0.05.",

Yet within the deslorelin cohort, there was a 3 yr old na\u00efve pair that successfully bred; and another inexperienced pair (4-yr-old female with a 2-yr-old male) in the gonadorelin group reproduced. Alternatively, it is possible that none of these females actually ovulated, although random serum samples (collected from February 11 to March 7, 2003) were within or exceeded the expected seasonal range for progesterone. Interestingly, the females were sisters, and at least two of them have successfully bred since this study (D.A. Carlson, unpublished data).

If females are capable of estrus October through February and males are fertile December through May, then we speculate changes in habitat or resource availability or cross-breeding with domestic dogs could elicit a strategic shift in coyote reproduction. Monogamy and paternal care of young are important tactics in the reproductive strategy of free-roaming coyotes. Dominant adult (alpha) coyotes also are vigilant defenders of their territories, regulating access to food and potential mates. Yet the role socio-sexual behaviors play in the establishment and reinforcement of coyote pair-bonds is not fully understood. If the length of the breeding season expands from weeks into months, and the advantage of monogamy over polygamy is lost, consequent destabilization of a pack's social hierarchy could facilitate breeding among individuals previously prohibited from mating thereby affecting local population densities. Further study of coyote reproductive behavior will help biologists understand these mechanisms before alternative strategies emerge.",
