This cohort contained 4 transmission generations, and incubation periods of the cases between generations were not significantly different, suggesting that the virus has not been rapidly adapted to human beings. Interestingly, incubation periods of 233 cases (11.6%) were longer than the WHO-established quarantine period (14 days). Data modeling suggested that if adults take an extra 4-day or 7-day of isolation (i.e., a quarantine period of 18 or 21 days), 96.2% or 98.3%, respectively, of the people who are developing symptoms will be more effectively quarantined.

One of the key issues for controlling Covid-19 is to set up a suitable quarantine period which could capture about 95% of the cases developing symptoms so that the practice of isolations will be more effective and save public health resources. Thus far, the incubation time studies have been focused on hospitalized patients who were highly selected based on medical conditions, and further, sample sizes for inferring incubation times were small, for example, 10 and ~100, respectively 3, 4 . However, the majority (i.e., about 80% of adults and 95% of children) of the Covid-19 cases were not necessary to be hospitalized, and therefore, had not been hospitalized due to their mild conditions.

Thus, understanding the characteristics of the incubation period is crucial to design public health efforts. In this cohort, the full range of incubation periods of the Covid-19 cases ranged from 0 to 33 days among 2015 cases. Both male and female adults had their median incubation periods of 7-day, which is 1.8-day longer than those in other reports 3,4 (see discussion). However, a similar result was released in the recent news from the Chinese Medical Association that the median incubation periods were 5-7 days 5 . The median incubation period (9-day) of children were significantly longer than those of adults (t-test P = 0.02). For adults, the incubation periods for the majority (66.5%) of the cases were 1-9 days: most of them (57.6% and 52.0% for males and females, respectively) had 1-5 days incubation. Importantly, we found that the incubation periods of 11.5% (n=233, 123 and 105 were male and female, respectively) of the cases were longer than 14 days, the current WHO-set 14-day quarantine period. These results agree with a recent study which also reported 12.7% (n=13) of the cases whose incubation periods were longer than 14 days 4 .

Based on previous studies, WHO has set a 14-day quarantine period for Covid-19. However, we found that that the incubation periods of 11.5% (n=233) of the cases were longer than 14 days, meaning that the current quarantine policy only stops 88% of the cases for virus spreading. This finding is similar to another report showing that 13 (12.7%) cases had their incubation time longer than 14 days 4 . In general, a quarantine period that retains about 95% of the cases developing symptoms will be more effective 6 . Thus, we further analyzed the subset (n=233) and found that 98.7% and 97.9%, respectively, of the men and women cases who are developing the disease, will be quarantined, if everybody or adults alone, respectively, take an extra 7-day of isolation (i.e., a quarantine period of 21 days).
