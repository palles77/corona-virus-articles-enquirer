Few research journals in design have a regular audience among professional designers, or among the leaders in business, industry, and government who use design. At the same time, few professional design magazines have readers among scholars and scientists. We've been successful in reaching scholars and scientists outside the design field, and we reach a small but growing group of leaders in business and industry. We haven't yet attracted as many professional designers as we'd like, either as authors or as readers. For us, bringing these groups together is important. These groups must work together if we are to generate robust design knowledge for the design profession and for the discipline as a unified field. Only this large frame will enable us to make significant progress in addressing the challenges of the real world. At this particular moment, for example, China and the rest of the world are facing a health emergency with COVID-19. We strongly feel that design expertise applied to public policy and to health care should have enabled us to do more in addressing this challenge. This is also the case for the challenges of design for the complex socio-technical systems that form the core of modern industrial economies. Given these challenges, we have made a goal of generating more active dialogue between professional groups, academic groups, and leaders in business, industry, and government. We have begun this process by inviting commentary contributions and viewpoint articles from design professionals, and we are actively seeking other possibilities. These are central goals for the next five years of She Ji.",

This Chinese word has rich meanings.4 The character \"Sh\u00e8\" consists of two parts, respectively denoting \"language\" and \"action.\" Together as a whole, \"Sh\u00e8\" means setting up. The character \"J\u00ec\" means strategy. However, it has another meaningcalculation. When we put these two characters together, Sh\u00e8 J\u00ec can be understood as \"setting up a strategy.\" To this end, it means bridging language and action, aided by the technique of calculation-nowadays, digital computation with the tools of information technology. These interpretations meet in the Scandinavian concept of strategic design-as well as in the broad overview of design frames stated in Richard Buchanan's four orders of design.5",

We have redesigned the layout of the journal, choosing a new combination of fonts and an improved proportion of text to the space around it. In addition, we have changed the dimensions of She Ji. Our .pdf files are now compatible with both A4 and US Letter paper sizes. Readers from different places around the world will be able to print an article without having to shrink the original file to fit with their printers.
