There was no detectable antigenic cross-reactivity between these 4 viruses and FIPV, TGEV, HCV-229E, or CCV. Antiserum to FIPV reacted strongly with TGEV, and vice versa. Antiserum to both of these viruses had barely detectable to weak antigenic cross-reactivity with HCV-229E, and antiserum to IICV-229E had weak to moderate cross-reactivity with FIPV and TGEV.

This finding, coupled with the morphologic and It was interesting that the 8 coronaviruses selected for this study segregated into 2 distinct groups on the basis of antigenic cross-reactivity by immunefluorescence. Although viruses within each group were antigenieally related to each other, there appeared to be no antigenic relationship of viruses from one group with viruses of the other group. The first antigenically related group was comprised of MHV-3, HEV-67N, CDCV and I-ICV-OC43, and the second group was comprised of TGEV, FIPV, HCV-229E and CCV. These findings confirm a number of published reports on antigenic relationships among recognized coronaviruses. On the basis of serum neutralization or complement fixation tests, antigenie relationship has been previously reported between rat eoronavirus and MI-IV (14) , HCV-OC43 and MHV (11), HEV-67N and CI)CV (20) , HCV-OC43 and tIEV-67N (9), and CCV and TGEV (1) .

We could find no antigenic relationship by immunofluoreseenee between MHV-3 and HCV-229 E, and I-ICV-OC 43 and HCV-229E. A relationship between these viruses has been previously described (3). We also found no antigenic relationship between HEV-67N and TGEV, although a relationship using the immnnopreeipitation technique has been reported (2) . It has been reported that antiserum to TGEV does not react against FIPV in the fluorescent antibody test (25) . In contrast, we found that ~ntiserum to TGEV reacted strongly with FIPV. Finally, we are at a loss to explain the failure of anti-CCV globulin to react with TGEV and FIPV with immunefluorescence, especially considering the strong reaction against CCV demonstrated by both anti-FIPV and TGEV serum. Dog anti-CCV serum will apparently neutralize TGEV (1), and it is strange that this reaction was not detected with immnnofluoreseence.",
