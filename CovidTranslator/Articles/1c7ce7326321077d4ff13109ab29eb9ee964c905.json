Immune dysregulation during acute lung infection plays a role in lung injury and the systemic inflammatory response. Cytokines seem to be major players in severe lung infection cases. Here, we present a review of published papers in the last 3 years regarding this topic. The cytokine response during pneumonia is different in bacterial vs viral infections; some of these cytokines correlate with clinical severity scales such as CURB65 or SOFA. Treatment focused in the cytokine environment is an interesting area that could impact the prognosis of CAP. Some of the agents that have been studied as co-adjuvant therapy are corticosteroids, macrolides, and linezolid, but anyone of those have shown a clear or proven efficacy or have been recommended as a part of the standard of care for CAP. More studies designed to define the role of immunomodulatory agents, such as co-adjuvant therapy in pneumonia, are needed.",

Because new diagnostic tools are now available, the identification of other microorganisms is currently easier and has changed previous thinking regarding the causes of CAP. Most of the information we have obtained is from moderate to severe CAP patients who needed hospital care. Numerous viruses and bacteria are responsible for CAP. Infection can be caused by a single microorganism, but co-infection is also possible. Recent studies showed that respiratory viruses are the main cause. Among bacteria, S. pneumoniae remained the most commonly identified cause of CAP, but it represented only a minority of the patients [9\u2022\u2022] . A meta-analysis also found respiratory viruses, particularly influenza and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), as a common cause of CAP in 15 to 54 % of hospitalized adults [10\u2022\u2022] .

Influenza A virus (IAV) infection is the most common cause of pneumonia-related death in the developed world and mortality attributable to IAV infection can be much higher during pandemics. Currently available agents to treat IAV infection, including oseltamivir and zanamivir, inhibit viral NA. Therefore, they are most effective at limiting viral replication in the early stages of infection and in immunocompromised patients and are less effective once an antiviral innate immune response is established. The presence of viral RNA in the cytosol activates three major intracellular immune pathways that initiate the innate immune response toward the virus: retinoic acid inducible gene-1 (RIG-1) proteins, Toll-like receptors (TLRs; primarily TLR3 and TLR7), and inflammasome. Binding of viral RNA to helicase domains on RIG-1 triggers its interaction with mitochondriaassociated antiviral signaling protein (MAVS), which induces the generation of type I and III interferons (IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 and IFN-\u03bb) and activates the pro-inflammatory transcription factor nuclear factor (NF)-\u03baB. Replication of the influenza virus replication critically depends on cellular NF-\u03baB activity and NF-\u03baB is a crucial pro-inflammatory signaling module, suggesting that strategies to inhibit the NF-\u03baB pathway may be suitable for intervention. Finally, GM-CSF is an important mediator of antiviral host defense and a factor promoting repair of the alveolar epithelium [32\u2022\u2022] .",

Corticosteroids can switch off genes that encode proinflammatory cytokines (e.g., IL-6 and IL-8) and switch on genes that encode anti-inflammatory cytokines (e.g., IL-10). However, the use of steroids also exerts an influence on the immune function of different host defenses against bacteria when high dosages and prolonged treatment are used [47\u2022\u2022] .",

Statins are known to down-regulate cytokines and transcription factors that are abnormally increased during sepsis. Several in vitro and in vivo studies have demonstrated that statins reduce the levels of TNF-\u03b1, IL-1, IL-6, IL-8, NF-\u03baB, and C-reactive protein. These effects inhibit the up-regulation of cytokines and potentially decrease inflammation and immune dysfunction. As a consequence, statins may decrease the severity of symptoms associated with sepsis [55] . A metaanalysis performed in 2013 included 28 studies and revealed an association between statins and the risk and mortality of CAP. However, the results constitute very low quality evidence, based on the GRADE framework, due to the observational study design, heterogeneity, and publication bias. Given the biological plausibility of these findings and the high burden and mortality of CAP, the meta-analysis results warranted additional and better-designed studies to define the utility of statins in CAP [56] . A recent multicenter, double blind, randomized clinical trial studied rosuvastatin versus a placebo in patients with sepsis-associated acute respiratory distress syndrome with 70 % of the cases due to pneumonia. Patients did not improve clinical outcomes with rosuvastatin but may have contributed to a higher degree of hepatic and renal dysfunction [57\u2022] .",
