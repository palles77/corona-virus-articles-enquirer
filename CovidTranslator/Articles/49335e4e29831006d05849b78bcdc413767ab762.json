This study aimed to determine the antiviral activity of a probiotic lactic acid bacterium (LAB) against feline calicivirus (FCV), a surrogate of human NV. Bacterial growth medium filtrate (BGMF) of Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis LM0230 and its bacterial cell suspension (BCS) were evaluated separately for their antiviral activity against FCV grown in Crandell-Reese feline kidney (CRFK) cells. No significant antiviral effect was seen when CRFK cells were pre-treated with either BGMF (raw or pH 7-adjusted BGMF) or BCS. However, pre-treatment of FCV with BGMF and BCS resulted in a reduction in virus titers of 1.3 log 10 tissue culture infectious dose (TCID) 50 and 1.8 log 10 TCID 50 , respectively. The highest reductions in FCV infectivity were obtained when CRFK cells were co-treated with FCV and pH 7-adjusted BGMF or with FCV and BCS (7.5 log 10 TCID 50 and 6.0 log 10 TCID 50 , respectively). These preliminary results are encouraging and indicate the need for continued studies on the role of probiotics and LAB on inactivation of viruses in various types of foods.",

The economic cost of foodborne illnesses is approximately $152 billion in the US alone (Scharff 2010) . Enteric viruses, particularly human norovirus (NV) and hepatitis virus type A, are the leading causes of viral foodborne illnesses (Anonymous 2012; Koopmans and Duizer 2004) . Human NV, one of the top five highestranking pathogens with respect to the total cost of foodborne illness in the US, belongs to family Caliciviridae and is a well-known cause of ''winter-vomiting disease '' or ''stomach-flu'' (ECDC 2013; Scharff 2012) . The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (2013) reported that NV causes 19-21 million cases of acute gastroenteritis annually in the US and leads to 1.7-1.9 million outpatient visits, 400,000 emergency room visits, 56,000-71,000 hospitalizations, and 570-800 deaths, mostly among young children. More than half of all foodborne disease outbreaks due to a known cause reported to CDC from 2006 to 2010 was attributed to NV. In the European Union, caliciviruses (primarily NV) were responsible for 507 of 675 foodborne viral outbreaks (European Food Safety Authority 2009).",

In addition, recent experiments with NV in a variety of foods revealed that freezing, cooling, and mild heat treatment (minimal food processing) were not effective in significantly reducing virus titers (Mormann et al. 2010) . Thus, development of novel, efficient and safe strategies for controlling viral contamination of foods is of great interest to food scientists and food producers. In this regard, biopreservation (control of one organism by another) has received much attention in the last decade (Dali\u00e9 et al. 2010) .",

It is a Gram-positive bacterium used extensively in the production of butter milk and cheese (Madigan et al. 2012) . Other uses include the production of pickled vegetables, beer or wine, bread, and other fermented foodstuff, such as soymilk kefir. This organism has a homofermentative metabolism and produces L-(?)-lactic acid (Samar\u017eija et al. 2001) . It can also produce D-(-)-lactic acid when cultured at low pH (\u00c5 kerberg et al. 1998) . The capability to produce lactic acid is one of the reasons why L. lactis is one of the most important microorganisms in the dairy and food industries and has achieved the GRAS (generally regarded as safe) status (FDA 2012).The present study was undertaken to determine the antiviral activity of L. lactis subsp. lactis LM0230 against feline calicivirus (FCV), a surrogate of NV.",

The second portion was adjusted to pH 7.0 \u00b1 0.05 using 1 M sodium hydroxide solution, filter-sterilized, and labeled as 'pH-7 adjusted BGMF'. The BCS was prepared by washing the pellet of bacteria obtained above twice with sterile peptone phosphate water broth (PPWB; Fluka, Switzerland) to remove excess MRS followed by centrifugation at 2,0009g for 15 min. The washed pellet was re-suspended in 10 mL of PPWB. The viable bacterial cell count was determined spectrophotometrically by measuring the optical density (OD) at 620 nm against cell-free PPWB as a blank. A standard curve was created by plotting ODs of 10-fold serial dilutions of a standard BCS versus mathematically calculated colony forming units (CFUs)/mL of each dilution. The CFU/mL of the standard BCS was measured initially using the plate count technique on MRS agar plates.",

As shown in Fig. 1 , there is no significant decrease (P C 0.01) in FCV titer after pre-treatment of CRFK cells either with raw or pH 7-adjusted BGMF. The time of pre-treatment also had no significant effect (P C 0.01). (ii) Pre-treatment of cells with BCS, the CRFK cells were pre-treated with various BCS volumes (20, 50, and 100 lL) to examine the effect of number of bacterial cells on the capability of CRFK cells to support FCV replication. The cells were pre-treated for 30, 60, or 90 min for each BCS volume. Except for a little decrease in FCV titer (0.5 log 10 TCID 50 / 0.1 mL) with CRFK treated with 100 lL of BCS for 90 min, neither bacterial cell count nor the treatment time had any significant effect on FCV titer (P \\ 0.01; data not shown). (iii) Pre-treatment of FCV with BGMF, the pre-treatment of FCV with raw BGMF for 30 min, 90 min, and 24 h resulted in significant reductions (P \\ 0.01) in FCV titer by approximately 0.7, 1.0, and 1.3 log 10 TCID 50 /0.1 mL, respectively, whereas pre-treatment with pH 7-adjusted BGMF led to non-significant decreases (P C 0.01) with all pre-treatment times (Fig. 2) . (iv) Pre-treatment of FCV with BCS (virus adsorption to bacterial cells), the pre-treatment of FCV with BCS containing 1 9 10 8 , 2 9 10 8 and 3 9 10 8 CFU of L. lactis LM0230 resulted in non-significant decreases (P C 0.01) in FCV titers at either 30 or 90 min (Fig. 3) .

(v) Co-treatment of cells and virus with BGMF, cotreatment of CRFK simultaneously with BGMFs and FCV as virus infection led to significant decreases in FCV titers (P \\ 0.01; Fig. 4 ). The highest decrease in virus titer (7.5 log 10 TCID 50 / 0.1 mL) was obtained by co-treatment with pH 7-adjusted BGMF at MNTD (0 dilution). There were lower decreases in FCV titers with higher dilutions of pH 7-adjusted BGMF (1.3 and 1.0 log 10 TCID 50 /0.1 mL with 1:5 and 1:10 dilutions). Similar trend was seen with co-treatment with raw BGMF. The highest decrease in FCV (P \\ 0.01) was attained with MNTD (1:10 dilution) of raw BGMF followed by 1:20 dilutions to be 1.5, 1.3 log 10 TCID 50 /0.1 mL reduction, respectively.

(vi) Co-treatment of cells with BCS and virus, the cotreatment of CRFK monolayers with different volumes (20, 50, and 100 lL) of BCS (5.1 9 10 8 CFU/mL) during simultaneous FCV infection resulted in significant decreases (P \\ 0.01) in FCV titer versus its titer with control monolayers (without BCS). The highest decrease in FCV titer (6.0 log 10 TCID 50 /0.1 mL) was attained by treatment with 100 lL followed by approximately 5.7 and 5.0 log 10 TCID 50 / 0.1 mL when CRFK monolayer was treated by 50 and 20 lL of BCS, respectively (Fig. 5 ).

Therefore, its effect was eliminated by transforming lactic acid into its sodium salt (sodium lactate) at pH 7.0. This explanation is supported by a similar study in which pretreatment of FCV with 0.3 % D,L-lactic acid solution (pH 3.4-3.5) at 20\u00b0C led to 1.3 log 10 reduction in FCV titer (Straube et al. 2011) .

(2007) reported 70 % reduction in infectivity of VSV after 24 h incubation with different LAB strains. They attributed this reduction to the adsorption or binding of the virus on the surface of LAB strains probably because peptidoglycans in the cell walls of LAB trapped the virus (Boti\u0107 et al. 2007 ). The cell wall of L. lactis is also known to have a peptidoglycan structure consisting of A4a-type peptidoglycan, with a monomer primary structure (Glc-NAc-MurNAc-L-Ala-a-D-Glu-L-Lys-D-Ala) and a D-Asp in the interpeptide bridge, attached to the a-amino group of Lys (Courtin et al. 2006) . Some Lactobacillus strains have been shown to trap HIV virions by binding the mannose sugar rich ''dome'' of their attachment glycoprotein gp 120 (Carlson et al. 2004; Chang et al. 2009) . A similar mechanism may also have worked in the bacterium-virus interaction system of the present study.",

We hypothesize that the extracellular metabolites of L. lactis excreted in BGMF might prevent the attachment of FCV to the cells affecting its entrance into the cells. The observed antiviral activities of pH 7-adjusted BGMF indicate that lactic acid may not be the key factor in this action where it was transformed to sodium lactate during pH adjustment of BGMF. It has been reported previously that metabolites of L. lactis such as bacteriocins (Akko\u00e7 et al. 2011; Choi et al. 2000; Samar\u017eija et al. 2001 ) and hydrogen peroxide (Grufferty and Condon 1983; Samar\u017eija et al. 2001; Van Niel et al. 2002) may be responsible for such action. Antiviral activity of bacteriocins and bacteriocin-like substances produced by LAB, probiotics, and certain other bacteria has been reported (Ermolenko et al. 2010; Saeed et al. 2007; Todorov et al. 2005; Torres et al. 2013; Wachsman et al. 2003) .

Our results are also in agreement with Maragkoudakis et al. (2010) who observed significant decreases in infectivity of transmissible gastroenteritis coronavirus (TGEV) and RV when hosting cells co-infected with the viruses in presence of Lactobacillus sp. It was hypothesized that LAB cells induced release of reactive oxygen species such as NOand H 2 O 2 , which may be responsible for killing the studied viruses (TGEV and RV; Maragkoudakis et al. 2010) . Competition between bacterial cells and FCV for attaching to the functional receptors on the cells may also help elucidate these results. It is also possible that LAB may establish a ''cross talk'' (some sort of signaling) or alter the state of the epithelial cells and macrophages, which leads to an antiviral response as suggested by Boti\u0107 et al.

Second, the peptidoglycan structure of LAB may trap viral particles. Third, production of different metabolites (such as bacteriocins and hydrogen peroxide) can prevent the entrance of the virus into host cells thereby inhibiting its replication. Finally, the competition between the bacterial cells and the virus for attachment on host cells may be occurred. In addition, the induction effect of the bacterium Food Environ Virol (2014) 6:282-289 287 for the host cells to produce reactive oxygen substances might kill the virus.",
