As with the first study, vector integration analyses showed no evidence of aberrant clonal behavior.''Notably, the disease did not manifest or progress in the three patients 7 to 21 months beyond the predicted age of symptom onset,'' the researchers wrote. ''These findings indicate that extensive genetic engineering of human hematopoiesis can be achieved with lentiviral vectors and that this approach may offer therapeutic benefit for MLD patients.''The researchers cautioned, however, that although their data are promising, long-term follow-up of patients is needed in order to establish the full therapeutic potential of this gene therapy strategy for MLD: ''In addition, our data position lentiviral gene transfer as a feasible means to engineer human hematopoiesis to its near entirety-an approach that could be exploited for treatment of other diseases.'' Both studies were published online July 11, and in print on August 23.Dr. Naldini was corresponding author for the WAS study and one of two corresponding authors on the MLD study, joined there by Alessandra Biffi, group leader of the HSC gene therapy for lysosomal storage disorders research unit at the San Raffaele Scientific Institute.",
