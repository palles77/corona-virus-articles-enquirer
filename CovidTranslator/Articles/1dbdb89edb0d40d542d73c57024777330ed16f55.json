Varying the illness threshold at which school closures are triggered did not seem to have substantial impact on the effectiveness of school closures, suggesting that short delays in closing schools should not cause concern.",

Closing schools can cause significant social and economic disruption to the local community by placing additional burdens on parents, causing loss of income to school staff, and interfering with children's education, nutritional status, and other activities. 1, 3 Parents who are forced to stay at home to care for their children when schools are closed may have to sacrifice needed income or even lose their jobs, which could be disproportionately more likely among low-income families. In addition, those parents may have essential skills (such as healthcare) that are consequently temporarily lost to the system. Beyond education, schools are the sources of many vital community services, such as lunches and after-school programs. Therefore, a thorough understanding of the potential benefits and effects of school closure should accompany school closure policy-making.",

            "text": "School closures rose in prominence as a possible epidemic mitigation strategy after studies suggested that schools play an important role in influenza transmission. Glezen wrote in 1996 that \"the fires of the epidemic are carried by healthy school-age children,\" a perspective supported by extensive historical data from the 1918-19 and 1957 pandemics and the 1978 influenza season in Houston. [4] [5] [6] School classes with children in kindergarten through 12th grade have \"high potential for virus transmission\" according to social network analyses conducted in the United States, 7 Germany, 8 and Belgium. 9 Public health and school officials face numerous decisions when preparing for a potential influenza epidemic. They need to decide whether and when to close schools, how many schools to close, and how long they should keep schools closed. An official may choose to keep schools open and simply isolate students who contract influenza, close schools in which influenza cases appear (individual school closure), shut down the entire school system as soon as enough cases appear in the community, or some combination of these various strategies. The optimal choice depends on the potential effectiveness of each strategy and any synergistic effects in mitigating an influenza epidemic. However, decision makers may not have enough available data to make effective choices between the different strategies, and prospective studies may be difficult or impossible to perform. Retrospective data may be limited and not generalizable to different situations and circumstances. Computer simulations can help decision makers explore different possible strategies and their probable consequences.",

This model included explicit representations of the county's population, school system, work-places/commutes, households, and communities. The model also represented individual county residents, which allowed us to simulate different influenza epidemic scenarios and the ACHD to explore the effects of various school closure strategies. Our model incorporated many methods from other previously published MIDAS simulation models. 10, 11 The objectives of this study were to determine how school closures as an isolated strategy may minimize the course of an epidemic (as measured by the number of infected cases) and how these effects may vary with differing school closure durations, triggers, and types. Understanding the impact of school closure in isolation is important when other major mitigation strategies are not available or practical because the epidemic arrived unexpectedly (eg, the 2009 H1N1 pandemic when vaccines were not available and mass prophylaxis with antiviral medications was not attempted) or the infectious agent is completely novel. The model could be applied to other infectious diseases transmissible by casual contact, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome, by incorporating parameter values (eg, incubation period and transmissibility) specific to that infectious disease.",

For example, as the third row in Table 1 indicates, an infectious child coming into contact with a susceptible adult in a shared household has a .3 probability of transmitting the virus to the adult. By comparison, the fifth row of Table 1 indicates that an infected student who comes into contact with a susceptible student has a .0435 probability of transmitting the virus. The lower half of Table 1 delineates the frequency at which different individuals contact other individuals at different locations (eg, a student will contact 13.5 other students within his or her classroom and 15 students in the same school but other classrooms each school day). A newly infected person then moves to the exposed (E) state for the duration of the disease's incubation period and then to the infectious state (I) in which the person may infect others. Consistent with the results of the MIDAS combined-model study, only two-thirds of infectious patients exhibit symptoms. 11 After the duration of the infectious period, the person proceeds to the recovered state (R) and remains immune to subsequent infections for the remainder of the simulation.",

When parents were able only to catch 20 percent of symptomatic children before they went to schools, this strategy had no significant effect on the epidemic. Isolation as a strategy did not prevent asymptomatic infectious students from entering schools and spreading disease. In fact, the effectiveness of isolation as a strategy was highly sensitive to the percentage of infectious children who were symptomatic: decreasing this percentage from 75 to 25 increased the overall attack mean rate for an R 0 = 1.4 epidemic from 27.4 percent to 35.4 percent.

A 2-week system closure also resulted in a slightly higher overall AR (35.0%) with a slightly delayed peak (between days 68 and 76).

Although the effects on overall ARs were modest, the peak incidence was substantially decreased for closures of over 4 weeks. The simulation runs showed similar results at the higher R 0 values for all systemwide closures, ARs were higher, and epidemic peaks were same as earlier. For individual school closure, variations of duration and R 0 value generated findings very similar to those observed for school system closures.

School closures were effective in reducing the overall AR only when schools remain closed throughout the bulk of the epidemic and reopened after the epidemic has subsided (or an additional effective mitigation strategy such as vaccination is implemented in the interim). Reopening schools during the epidemic simply released a population of susceptible children to be subsequently infected and may continue to fuel the epidemic.

Second, an entire school system closure may be more difficult to coordinate and implement, depending on the location and jurisdiction, although it would certainly reduce confusion. It raises the questions of who has ultimate decision-making power and which schools in a county fall within the scope of those decisions. For example, in a given county, there may be different officials who hold authority to close public schools in various school districts and private schools. Individual schools with symptomatic students may be more willing and able to close quickly; ironically, schools may close in response to expressed parental concern or to reduce potential litigation.",

Our results suggested that the impact of school closures on overall ARs is not highly sensitive to changes in this threshold level, that is, when exactly school closure is initiated.

Instead, the most important factor seemed to be keeping schools closed for a long duration, that is, throughout most of the epidemic, once they are closed.",

Schools must remain closed for at least 8 weeks, that is, throughout most of the epidemic, to have a significant impact on overall ARs. Simply, screening for ill students and keeping them from attending schools had minimal effect on the overall extent of the epidemic. Individual and systemwide school closures appeared to be equally effective so if the latter are more difficult to execute, the former can suffice. In addition, our results did not support any specific \"illness\" threshold level at which to close schools. In other words, short delays in school closure may not have a significant effect on the AR, timing of epidemic peak, or peak incidence. Finally, school closures may delay the epidemic peak for up to a week, which may provide more time to implement a second more effective intervention such as vaccination. The observed effect of reducing the peak incidence during an epidemic could place more importance on school closures when medical care capacity is anticipated to become strained or overloaded because of the number of patients needing care during the epidemic. This might be especially important in the setting where flu vaccine was becoming available just at the beginning of the school year. It is possible that delay of school opening for several weeks, in order to ensure that students get vaccination prior to beginning the school year, could be highly effective. As flu vaccine production becomes more efficient, this scenario becomes increasingly possible.

The R 0 = 1.4 baseline is of particular interest because it was used as part of the model calibration process, 17 with an AR targeted at 35 percent. Our calibration of the model at R 0 = 1.4 (averaged over 100 statistical realizations) produced an AR of 35.1 percent, which corresponds to 435 745 infected persons. The AR for adults was 29.2 percent (274 342 infected adults) and students 70 percent (163 005 infected students). This higher AR for students was consistent with the other MIDAS models of R 0 = 1.4 epidemics. 17,25 Figure 1(a) shows incidence infections curves with no mitigations implemented for the various R 0 values calibrated for the research in the article, and Figure 1(b) displays incidence infection curves for the same values with systemwide school closure of a duration of 8 weeks.",
