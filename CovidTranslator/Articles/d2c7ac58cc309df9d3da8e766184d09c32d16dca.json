            "text": "Untargeted accurate strain-level classification of a priori unidentified organisms using tandem mass spectrometry is a challenging task. Reference databases often lack taxonomic depth, limiting peptide assignments to the species level. However, the extension with detailed strain information increases runtime and decreases statistical power. In addition, larger databases contain a higher number of similar proteomes. We present TaxIt, an iterative workflow to address the increasing search space required for MS/MS-based strain-level classification of samples with unknown taxonomic origin. TaxIt first applies reference sequence data for initial identification of species candidates, followed by automated acquisition of relevant strain sequences for low level classification. Furthermore, proteome similarities resulting in ambiguous taxonomic assignments are addressed with an abundance weighting strategy to improve candidate confidence. We apply our iterative workflow on several samples of bacterial and viral origin. In comparison to noniterative approaches using unique peptides or advanced abundance correction, TaxIt identifies microbial strains correctly in all examples presented (with one tie), thereby demonstrating the potential for untargeted and deeper taxonomic classification. TaxIt makes extensive use of public, unrestricted and continuously growing sequence resources such as the NCBI databases and is available under open-source license at https://gitlab.com/rki_bioinformatics.",

            "text": "Pathogenic strain identification using LC-MS/MS-based proteomics presents a crucial, yet highly challenging task. Many pathogenic strains feature significant phenotypic differences within a species with respect to pathogenicity, zoonotic potential, cell attachment and entry, host-virus interaction and clinical symptoms [1] [2] [3] . In a diagnostic context, strain-level knowledge is important to infer virulence 4, 5 and drug resistance 6 for appropriate therapy. However, inferring exact strain information from proteomic samples remains a difficult task, in particular when the taxonomic origin of a sample is unknown and when related strains feature high sequence similarity. In recent years, MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry has gained popularity as fast, sensitive and economical method for microbial biotyping. However, identifying strains using MALDI-TOF workflows is still very challenging and requires curated, often proprietary spectral databases 7 . Several commercial platforms for microbial biotyping down to the species or strain level are available based on MALDI and other technologies such as the Bruker MALDI Biotyper Systems 8 , the Bruker Strain typing with IR Biotyper 9 and the Ibis T5000 Universal Biosensor 10 . Several studies report on limitations of MALDI-TOF biotyping for strain-level identifications and advocate advancements towards MS/MS marker peptide detection and, consequently, the analysis was shifted to the MS/MS level 11, 12 . In these studies, however, the MS/MS-based protein identification was established using sequence databases that were already targeted or restricted to particular species or limited sets. In contrast, untargeted MS/MS typing approaches are limited to species level identification 6, 13 . However, in general MS/MS is preferred for the analysis of complex unpurified peptide mixtures as it is considered to provide more distinct and unambiguous peptide and protein identifications 14 and thus increased proteome resolution 15 as well as higher statistical confidence 16 . In particular, organisms with unknown taxonomic origin benefit from peptide sequence-based analysis, as MALDI-based biotyping is in comparison too prone to ambiguous identifications 17 . Furthermore, advances in instrumentation including higher resolution, mass accuracy and dynamic range increasingly allow for identification of the majority of all fragmented peptides 18 resulting in higher sensitivity, higher coverage of target proteomes and thus higher availability of distinctive features. Taking advantage of the vast amount of available protein sequences for MS/MS strain-level identification is challenging. On the one hand, constraining the search space may result in unidentified strains or incorrectly assigned taxa, in particular for non-model organisms 19 . On the other hand, applying large databases is not recommended either since it decreases peptide identification rates 20 and thus eventually impedes taxonomic inference 21 . Furthermore, with increasing database size sequence quality often decreases (e.g. when using the complete NCBI Protein in comparison to the NCBI RefSeq database) and contaminant sequences may occur more often 22 . Therefore, extended databases should only be used when necessary. However, strain-level identification of MS/MS spectra from samples with unclear taxonomic status requires an untargeted search against comprehensive databases holding as many strains as possible. A common and popular concept to handle increased search spaces is the application of multiple identification steps in general, independently of target application such as strain-level identification. These multi-stage identification search strategies are described by several different terms such as serial search 23 , multi-step 24 , iterative 25, 26 , multi-stage 27 , two-step [28] [29] [30] as well as cascade search 31 and they find application in proteomics, metaproteomics 26, 28 and proteogenomics 30, 32 . Most of these strategies do not only overlap in their objective of increasing the identification rate or identification confidence, but share methodological principles as well. This includes the concept of identifying primarily unassigned spectra using databases of increasing complexity (for instance, by employing altered digestion parameters, additional post-translational modifications or additional spectral and genomic databases) [24] [25] [26] [27] 31 as well as the recurring theme of database size reduction 24, 26, [28] [29] [30] 32 . In addition, some methods rely on spectral quality assessment to enhance subsequent identification steps 25, 32 or exhibit a focus on algorithmic runtime reduction 24 . Apart from database size, multi-proteome databases present an additional challenge for taxonomic assignment in the form of high sequence similarity between proteomes, in particular between related species and strains. These similarities give rise to taxonomically ambiguous, widespread and false assignments and thus need to be accounted for. Several methods exist that provide various strategies to account for ambiguous peptide spectrum matches due to sequence similarity. Dworzanski et al. apply a proteogenomic mapping approach in combination with discriminant analysis to infer most likely bacterial assignments 33 . The proteogenomic approach was further developed in BACid that applies several statistical measures to account for similarity, including the comparison of ratios of taxonomic differences and of unique peptides to known error rates, i.e. the noise levels 34, 35 . BACid has since been applied to and extended for samples of unknown origin 36 as well as mixtures of bacteria 36, 37 . With the focus on metaproteomic analysis, MEGAN 38 , UniPept 39 , MetaProteomeAnalyzer 40,41 and TCUP 6 rely on lowest common ancestor or most specific taxonomy approaches to assign peptides spectrum matches to taxonomic levels. MiCId uses a clustering approach based on peptidome similarity of taxa on different levels in combination with unified E-values to infer statistically significant representatives of clusters as identified or classified microorganisms 13, 42 . Tracz et al. use a direct assignment strategy by concatenating all proteins of a proteome into one pseudo-polyprotein and considering only the top-scored spectrum matches to a peptide as counts for bacterial candidates 43 . In contrast, Pipasic explicitly makes use of ambiguous peptide spectrum matches (PSMs) by applying abundance correction based on intensityweighted proteome similarities of organisms in metaproteomic samples 44 . While these methods share the objective of reducing uncertainty in taxonomic identification due to ambiguous assignments in the context of the protein inference issue 45 , their application for untargeted strain-level identification is not straightforward for several reasons. For example, unique peptides are not necessarily available for all candidate strains in the sequence databases for which the information given is often limited to species or higher taxonomic levels. In addition, the approaches rely on fully sequenced genomes (and thus uniform proteome coverage) or other forms of targeted, curated, inhouse or validated databases and are thus restricted to a predefined limited set of organisms, often with definite focus on bacteria. Furthermore, some methods do not scale well with immoderate large databases (i.e. high number of proteomes) with respect to computational or analytical performance. Previous multi-step procedures illustrate the effect of database size on identification confidence and the advantage of applying concise, prefiltered or specialized databases. Thus, we transfer the general concept of multi-step procedures to approach the increased search space necessary for untargeted and detailed taxonomic classification. We present TaxIt, an iterative workflow for untargeted strain-level identification of protein samples. By applying two separate identification steps for species-and strain-level classification, we circumvent the immediate need for a comprehensive database containing strain All rights reserved.

PSMs are subjected to an FDR cutoff based on a per-match FDR calculated as Ndecoy/Ntarget, with Ndecoy being the number of decoys in between targets (Ntarget) in a list of matches sorted by e-value 20, 53 . To acknowledge established false positive hits of previous iterations, decoy sequences with an e-value above the FDR-cutoff are passed on and concatenated to the database of the next iteration.",

TaxIt uses NCBI RefSeq proteins of selected kingdoms as reference databases for initial species identification followed by automated and selective strain protein incorporation. Unique-PSMs-and Pipasic-based strategies, however, apply comprehensive databases integrating as many strain-level sequences as possible at once, including all protein sequences from the NCBI Protein database for selected kingdoms. In general, a preselection of kingdoms may be justified by clinical findings based on, for instance, symptoms or microscopic examination 57 . Both, unique-PSMs-and Pipasic-based strategies use the same procedures for peptide search, FDR control and taxonomic classification as described in the iterative workflow. However, PSMs are not summarized at species level and counts are directly inferred at the lowest possible taxonomic level. For the unique-PSMs-based strategy, adjusted counts are based on PSMs that occur only once. In other words, only spectra assigned unambiguously to only one peptide sequence and thus organism are taken into account. The abundance similarity correction of Pipasic uses the similarity of expressed proteomes between taxa to account for attribution biases. Originally intended for metaproteomic abundance correction, it is here applied to highlight the most likely strain within a provided sample. All rights reserved.

Expressed proteins per taxa are extracted according to the taxonomic classification and digested peptides with a minimum length of six amino acids are prepared using trypsin digestion 58 . PSMs and tryptic peptides are then passed to Pipasic to obtain corrected relative counts. We perform all three strategies on several viral and bacterial MS/MS spectra samples with available strainlevel knowledge. This includes a Cowpox virus (Brighton Red) strain (acquired in-house), an Avian infectious bronchitis virus (strain Beaudette CK) 59 and a Bacillus subtilis BSN238 60 that we will refer to as cowpox, bronchitis and bacillus sample, respectively. B. subtilis BSN238 is a transgenic organism resulting from horizontal gene transfer (HGT) of the DivIVA protein from Listeria monocytogenes strain EGD-e to Bacillus subtilis subsp. subtilis str. 168.

For some samples, correct strains are observed as a top candidate even in the original counts, independently of database choice and prior to count adjustments. Nevertheless, all samples benefit either from the iterative and focused database usage, the count adjustment procedure or the reduced resource consumption while the outcome remains legitimate. It was shown that TaxIt improves taxonomic assignment already in the count-based ranking, independently of count adjustments, by limiting candidates to strains of a single species early on ( Figure  3) . For instance, the search of bronchitis samples against the NCBI Blast NR bacteria subspace results in a rather uniform distribution of original counts for Infectious bronchitis virus strains: the strains Beaudette, Beaudette CK and Beaudette UK are only slightly increased in comparison to other strains (Figure 3B,  Original) . In contrast, the iterative approach results in less strain candidates of the same species focusing solely on Beaudette strains when selectively searching against Avian coronavirus strains in the secondary iteration (Figure 3A, Original) . This is a consequence of how and whether parental or multispecies proteins are associated with strains or taxa in general within the NCBI taxonomy. In case of the iterative approach, fewer mutual species or genus proteins are consulted in the strain identification iteration. However, the extent of this effect varies between samples, candidate strains or target databases and taxonomies, respectively. For instance, bacterial strain proteomes such as the Bacillus subtilis strains feature numerous directly assigned mutual protein sequences and thus result in an extended range of candidate strains of the same species (Supplementary item 1 -Figure S3 and S4) . Nevertheless, the restriction to a specific set of strain proteomes prevents manifold primary misassignments to distant species, genera or even phyla as can be observed for Pipasic-and unique-PSMsbased original counts, respectively, that cannot be sufficiently resolved after correction (Supplementary item 1 - Figure S3 and S4) . In general, the iterative and selective database usage ensures that final strain selection is limited to strain candidates of an appropriate species. Thus, it prevents false positive hits on distinct strains of other taxa including species, genera and phyla and allows for a more confident final strain candidate selection. Furthermore, uniform distributions and even consensus in original counts of strain candidates demonstrate the need and benefit of count adjustment methods. The implemented weighting procedure can resolve ties between strains such as in the TaxIt cowpox sample analysis (Figure 2 ) or at least amplifies the correct strain and increases the distance to competing candidates. TaxIt infers exactly one strain for the presented samples each expect for the bronchitis sample where the strains Beaudette CK and Beaudette UK cannot be differentiated. We observed that the corresponding PSMs are fully shared between the two proteomes. Although different proteins are available for each strain in general, peptide hits are either assigned to shared proteins of the parent strain Infectious bronchitis virus or to homologous proteins that differ only in identifier but not in sequence. Though a more granular taxonomic relation cannot be ascertained from the NCBI taxonomy, we expect the Beaudette strains to feature a considerably closer relationship as compared to other Infectious bronchitis virus strains. Therefore, we consider the draw between Beaudette strains as sufficiently appropriate strain identification. For the unique-PSMs-based strategy, we observed a poor availability of unique PSMs at the strain level. While the exploitation of purely unique features is a common theme for species-level identification, the low amount of unique PSMs in strains is insufficient for strain-level inference.

TaxIt has a comparable computational runtime for small samples and databases (such as the viral data) despite using a constrained search space. This is primarily a result of the additional strain proteome downloads, since the NCBI Entrez API is not designed and optimized for large scale downloads and proteins need to be fetched in numerous iterations of small chunks. However, the download overhead fades into the background when considering full bacterial samples such as bacillus all (Table 2 and Figure  5) and gives place to a runtime improvement of three quarters when compared to NCBI Blast NR database searches. In contrast, the runtime of Pipasic is afflicted with additional sequence comparisons necessary for constructing the similarity matrix that is highly influenced by increasing numbers of PSMs and taxa to compare. Finally, the memory footprint of TaxIt in comparison to the unique-PSMs-and Pipasic-based strategies remains constantly less for all samples, as would be expected when using substantially less proteins in the search databases. On a final note, strain-level identification performance is generally limited by the availability and integrity of taxa and proteomes in used databases.
