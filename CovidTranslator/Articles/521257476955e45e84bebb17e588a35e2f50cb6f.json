            "text": "The fiber knob of adenovirus (Ad) causes the first step in the interaction of adenovirus with cell membrane receptors. To obtain information on the receptor binding site(s) several synthetic peptides derived from Ad2 and Ad3 fiber head sequences and their antisera were tested for interference with virus attachment to HeLa and FL cells and cell adhesion to viruses. The anti-peptide sera were also evaluated in ELISA and virus neutralisation test. Ad2 (of subgroup C) and Ad3 (of subgroup B) attachment was not significantly inhibited by peptides corresponding to the amino acid residues 535 554, 555-573, 562-582 of Ad2 fiber or 210-225, 267-283, 291-306 and 300-319 of Ad3 fiber. However, microplate pre-adsorbed Ad3 fiber residues 210 225 and 267 283 could bind FL and HeLa cells, and 1 mg/ml of Ad3 fiber residues 267-283 inhibited the cell adhesion to Ad3 virus to approximately 90%. This peptide may participate in the receptor binding site of Ad3 fiber. ELISA reactive anti-peptide antibodies against the homologous peptide and virus did not significantly reduce the cell adhesion to the immobilised virus or the virus attachment to cells, but in the neutralisation assay antibodies raised to Ad2 fiber residues 555-573 and 562-582 and Ad3 fiber residues 210-225 caused neutralisation of the homologous virus at serum dilutions of 1:500 and 1:32, respectively. The corresponding peptides and one further peptide of Ad2 fiber and two of Ad3 fiber seem to contain neutralisation epitopes.",

The N-terminus of the polypeptide chains of the fibers, located in the tail region, interacts with the penton base, and the C-terminus is in the knob (Devaux et al., 1987; Caillet-Boudin et al., 1988; Weber et al., 1989) . The length of the fiber of human Ad3 is only 16 nm (Ruigrok et al., 1990) . The Ad2 fiber is glycosylated (Ishibashi and Maizel, 1974) but the Ad3 fiber apparently not (Caillet-Boudin et al., 1989) .

In this paper we evaluated the influence of some selected peptides of Ad3 and Ad2 fiber knob on the first step of interaction between adenoviruses and permissive cells. The requirement for an influence of peptides is the existence of continuous determinants in the binding site(s). The influence was also studied with labeled viruses and labeled cells. Especially, the adhesion of HeLa and FL cells to these peptides, to Ad2 and Ad3 virus and the attachment of Ad2 and Ad3 to the cells was examined. Additionally, the ability of prepared anti-peptide sera to bind and to neutralise the virus serotypes Ad2 and Ad3 was investigated.",

The results with the Ad3 fiber peptides and their antisera can be described in relation to the model of Ad5 fiber head of Xia et al. (1994 Xia et al. ( , 1995 . According to this the virus neutralisation by anti-Ad3P1, anti-Ad3P2 and anti-Ad3P3 seems probable, because of the involved parts of the R-sheet and the IJ loop, respectively. It has been noted in the literature that the host receptor binding site of adenovirus is probably a conformation determinant of the trimeric knob Di Guilmi et al., 1995; Fender et al., 1995) . In this case, in relation to the dimensions of the receptor complex sequence motifs, especially of the fl-strands G and H may participate in the receptor binding and Ad3P2 with the fl-strand H as a part of the R-sheet could contain a part of the receptor binding site.",

The manner of virus neutralisation has not been evaluated up to now by us. The sucrose gradient analyses of the neutralising antibodies to demonstrate any aggregation due to immune complex formation are outstanding in the reaction with radiolabeled virus particles. The high titer of anti-Ad2P3 antibody in ELISA and especially in NT was not quite expected, because the virus neutralisation titer of the corresponding antiserum of Ad3P4 was low. A reason for the low neutralisation titer of Ad3P4 antibody may be using ISCOM instead of KLH. Another reason may be the biological variability of the rabbits, which was used for antisera preparation. It is known that the carrier can drastically influence peptide immunogenicity (Liebermann et al., 1990; Daniel et al., 1994) . It is also possible that differences in the sequences induce another secondary structure. But in the plot structure Ad3P4 contains more antigenic indices over 1.2 than Ad2P3 (not shown).",

Antibodies against the amino acid sequence of VP2 residue 156-170 of human rhinovirus type 2 recognised and neutralised native virus, apparently by preventing attachment to cells (Barnett et al., 1993) . It was interesting, whether this is similar for the adenovirus. Anti-Ad2P1, anti-Ad2P2 and anti-Ad2P3 sera were neutralising, but a reducing effect on the cell adhesion to virus could not be found under the chosen conditions. The possible virus aggregation by these and the other neutralizing antisera as described for anti-fiber serum by Wohlfart et al. (1985) could be the reason for this and also for the non-significant inhibition of virus attachment to cells. Logically also their peptides must not block of necessity the virus attachment to cells. Now we also evaluate the blocking capacity of peptides of the fiber knob of Ad2 and Ad3 against adenovirus infection in vitro. Using combinations of some peptides and of their antisera, synergistic effects on the attachment and the virus neutralisation can also be expected.",

Approximately 100 /zg/ml of peptides adsorbed approximately the same amount of FL cells as 0.1 /~g/ml of virus. The reason for the low cell-binding capacity of the peptides may be that the peptide contains only a part of the receptor binding site and steric conditions.Fig. 3demonstrates the results of binding FL and HeLa cells to Ad2 fiber and the binding of FL cells to the complete Ad2. Comparing these results, it was expected that 100 /2g/ml of Ad2 and 1 /zg/ml of Ad2 fiber would bind the same amount of FL cells, because the mass portion of fiber is approximately 1% of the virion. The cell-binding capacity of the virus was however lower.
