            "text": "Porcine hemagglutinating encephalomyelitis virus (PHEV) is a typical neurotropic coronavirus that mainly invades the central nervous system (CNS) in piglets and causes vomiting and wasting disease. Emerging evidence suggests that PHEV alters microRNA (miRNA) expression profiles, and miRNA has also been postulated to be involved in its pathogenesis, but the mechanisms underlying this process have not been fully explored. In this study, we found that PHEV infection upregulates miR-142a-3p RNA expression in N2a cells and in the CNS of mice. Downregulation of miR-142a-3p by an miRNA inhibitor led to a significant repression of viral proliferation, implying that it acts as a positive regulator of PHEV proliferation. Using a dual-luciferase reporter assay, miR-142a-3p was found to bind directly bound to the 3' untranslated region (3'UTR) of Rab3a mRNA and downregulate its expression. Knockdown of Rab3a expression by transfection with an miR-142a-3p mimic or Rab3a siRNA significantly increased PHEV replication in N2a cells. Conversely, the use of an miR-142a-3p inhibitor or overexpression of Rab3a resulted in a marked restriction of viral production at both the mRNA and protein level. Our data demonstrate that miR-142a-3p promotes PHEV proliferation by directly targeting Rab3a mRNA, and this provides new insights into the mechanisms of PHEV-related pathogenesis and virus-host interactions.",

The ILI that was observed may reflect an atypical form of illness or a variant of PHEV with increased virulence. PHEV is a neurovirulent virus that spreads to the central nervous system (CNS) via peripheral nerves, where neurite damage and neuronal death are observed, causing neurological symptoms. Since pigs are the natural hosts of PHEV, the virus has to adapt to replicate in rats and mice (i.e., ICR, BALB/c and Wistar) in vivo, and rat dorsal root ganglia (DRG) and mouse neuroblastoma N2a cells in vitro [8, 10, 11] . The mechanism by which neuronal degeneration is induced by PHEV infection is not well understood, and the study of virus-host interactions is therefore important.",

Several studies have shown that aberrant expression 1 3 of miRNAs is closely associated with proliferation, invasion, metastasis and the prognosis of various coronavirus infections [13] [14] [15] . Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) infection upregulates miR-17*, mir-574-5p, and miR-214 and inhibits the expression of miR-98 and miR-223. miR-17* and mir-574-5p have been shown to restrict the replication of SARS-CoV, whereas miR-214 contributes to immune escape [15] . miRNAs are processed from hairpin transcripts, and this maturation step gives rise to a 3p and a 5p strand, both of which allow the silencing of specific target genes through base pairing to a minimal recognition sequence [16] . The miR-142(a) hairpin gives rise to a \"guide strand\", miR-142(a)-3p, and a sister \"passenger strand\", miR-142(a)-5p [12] . miR-142a-3p has been sown to play a critical role in virus infection, inflammation, and immune tolerance. Trobaugh et al. showed that North American eastern equine encephalitis virus (EEEV) hijacks host miR-142-3p to limit viral replication in particular cell lines [17] . miR-142a-3p also modulates neutrophil development by controlling its maturation in zebrafish [18] . Using miRNA array, miR-142a-3p expression has been shown to be upregulated during PHEV infection [19] . However, it remains to be investigated whether miR-142a-3p controls virus proliferation or translation of mRNAs that are associated with neurological dysfunction.",

To identify potential target mRNAs for miR-142a-3p, bioinformatics software, including Targetscan Mouse, MicroCosm Targets, and Miranda, were used. We focused on a set of seven genes (Ptpn23, Rab3a, Rab12, Tmem55b, Stx12, Fyco1, and Rab14) that were shown previously to be downregulated genes in the CNS using an mRNA array [19] . Of these, Rab3a is of particular interest. It is a small RAB GTPase that plays a role in neurotransmitter release and contains conserved 3'UTR sequence elements that are partially complementary to miR-142a-3p [21] . In consideration of its strong association with virus infection and nerve injury, we selected Rab3a for further verification.

N2a cells were transfected with siRNA targeting Rab3a (siRab3a) and NC (the disordered base sequence, siNC) for 24 h, and the silencing effect was confirmed ( Fig. 4a and b) . These pretreated cells were subsequently infected with PHEV at an MOI of 10 for another 24 h, and qRT-PCR and Western blot assays revealed that PHEV proliferation significantly increased when Rab3a was functionally inactivated, compared with NC-transfected cells ( Fig. 4c and d) . To investigate the effect of a gain of Rab3a function, a GFP-N construct encoding Rab3a CDS (Rab3a-GFP) was generated and used to transiently transfect N2a cells for 24 h. As shown in Fig. 4e and f, increased expression of Rab3a mRNA and protein was detected in the Rab3a-GFP-expressing cells. In the representative blot, the upper band corresponds to overexpressed exogenous Rab3a protein (~50 kDa), while the bottom band is endogenous Rab3a protein (~25 kDa). These cells were subsequently infected with PHEV, and we found that Rab3a overexpression resulted in suppression of viral proliferation at 24 dpi when compared to GFP-transfected cells (Fig. 4g and h) . Taken together, our data indicate that miR-142a-3p might upregulate PHEV proliferation by targeting Rab3a, which plays a passive role in viral replication.",

The specific target mRNA is principally recognized by the seed region of miRNAs, though multiple validated targets lack perfect base-pairing interactions. miRNA target sequences could be involved in the control of exogenous gene expression and viral tropism in specific cells or tissues, and miRNA-based therapeutics might be designed to either restore or suppress the function of dysregulated miRNAs. Given the versatility and importance of miRNAs, both DNA and RNA viruses affect host pathways by destroying, boosting, or hijacking miRNAs to benefit the viral life cycle [24] . In the case of PHEV, a highly neuropathic virus, little is known about how miRNAs participate in its infection and pathological process. Lv et al. [25] reported that enrichment of miR-21a-5p increases PHEV proliferation by targeting the protein Caskin1, which is required for neuronal axon growth in vivo and in vitro. Here, we attempted to identify miR-142a-3p-mediated molecular mechanisms underlying PHEV pathogenesis.",

Previous studies have reported that miR-142 plays a variety of vital roles in various diseases, such as virus infection, inflammation, and cancer [12, 26] . In addition, miR-142 could be a promising biomarker for the diagnosis of many diseases [27] . Thus, the functional significance of miR-142a-3p during PHEV infection is of interest for research and antiviral therapy. It has been shown that miR-142a-5p disrupts neuronal morphogenesis to promote PHEV infection [28] . Although miR-142a-3p and miR-142a-5p originate from the miR-142a hairpin [12] , the relationship between miR-142 and PHEV infection is poorly understood. Here, we verified the interaction Fig. 3 Rab3a is a target gene of miR-142a-3p. (a) Schematic representation of WT or MUT luciferase reporter of Rab3a mRNA 3\u2032UTR. The frame and letters in blue indicate the point mutant. (b) HEK293T cells were cotransfected with Rab3a-WT or Rab3a-MUT reporter constructs and the indicated oligonucleotides (100 nM mimic, 400 nM inhibitor, or 100 nM NC) for 24 h. The cells were harvested, and Renilla and firefly luciferase activity was measured. (c) The mRNA and protein levels of Rab3a in N2a cells transfected with miR-142a-3p mimic were determined by RT-PCR and Western blotting. (d) The expression of Rab3a was measured in N2a cells after transfection with miR-142a-3p inhibitor. (e) Representative micrograph of immunofluorescence analysis for Rab3a expression (green) in N2a cells transfected with the miR-142a-3p mimic-or miR-142a-3p inhibitor. The cell nucleus was stained with Hochest33342 (blue). Quantitative analysis of the Rab3a staining is shown on the right. The bars indicate 20 \u03bcm. All of the data are representative of at least three independent experiments (*, p < 0.05; **, p < 0.01) \u25c2 between PHEV and miR-142a-3p and found that the amount of miR-142a-3p in mice had increased significantly 5 days after infection with PHEV. Meanwhile, miR-142a-3p RNA was also apparently upregulated in PHEVinfected N2a cells, implying that miR-142a-3p might be involved in PHEV infection in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, our data revealed that enrichment of miR-142a-3p could promote PHEV infection or propagation and that knockdown of miR-142a-3p had an opposite effect. We therefore concluded that miR-142a-3p could affect PHEV accumulation and might also play a specific role in PHEV pathogenesis. More follow-up work is needed to support this view.",

Sequencing, bioinformatics, and time course experiments indicated that miR-142a-3p directly targets the Rab3a mRNA 3\u2032UTR. Rab3a is a small G protein that belongs to the RAS family of proteins. It regulates vesicle trafficking and is involved in calcium-triggered exocytosis in nerve cells [29, 30] . Generally, Rab3a protein localizes to the Golgi complex and regulates the synthesis and transport of effectors by interacting with GTPase [31] . Given that PHEV buds from endoplasmic reticulum-Golgi intermediate compartments and is assembled within small vesicles in the trans-Golgi network, we hypothesize that Rab3a, a Golgi-associated protein, may acts as a regulator of PHEV replication or nucleocapsid assembly [11, 32] . In this study, we found that Rab3a deficiency promotes PHEV replication and propagation, while overexpression of Rab3a restricts virus proliferation. Thus, we draw the preliminary conclusion that, in some phase of PHEV infection, Rab3a functions as a negative regulator through base-pairing interactions with miR-142a-3p.",
