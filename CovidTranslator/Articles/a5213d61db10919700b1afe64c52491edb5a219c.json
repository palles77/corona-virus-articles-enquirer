Through using the qualitative research method, the two SARs' institutional frameworks of tourism planning are investigated. The political economy framework is also applied to explain how the wider politicaleeconomic conditions of each society shape the governance. The results reveal that despite governance under similar Basic Law and sharing the same culture, the two SARs have very different forms of power relations resulting from their unique political eeconomic circumstances. Both have a centralized mode of governance but Macao's is more centralized and fragmentary than that of Hong Kong. Through this comparative research, a better understanding of the two societies and their structures and institutions can be gained and useful lessons learnt about the two SARs.",

Sustainable tourism development advocates a more balanced concern for economic, social and environment interests in tourism policy decision-making. As the concerns of sustainable tourism span numerous policy domains and involve diverse actors who have varied interests and priorities, the ability to strike a balance is often determined by how policy decisions are made and who governs or how power is distributed (Hall & Jenkins, 1995) . Sustainable tourism development can only be achieved by having effective governance which draws a diverse range of actors into tourism decision-making (Bramwell & Lane, 2011) .",

Comparative studies also serve as a tool for developing classifications of social phenomena and for establishing whether shared phenomena can be explained by the same causes (Creswell, 2009 ). In particular, Masser (1984, p. 148) suggests that cross-national comparative planning studies act as means of improving planning practice through the interpretation and transfer of experience from one country to another; and as a way of developing planning theory by transcending national cultural boundaries. It is hoped that through a comparative study of these two cities, a better understanding of the two societies and their structures and institutions can be gained.",

People, values, place, culture and government philosophy all interact to shape the decision-making process (Hall & Jenkins, 1995) . In order to manage the diverse interests, a new way to manage the tourism planning and development process therefore is needed. Governance is generally regarded as a more appropriate model of political steering whereby the values of non-governmental actors are also included in the decision-making process (Wesley & Pforr, 2010) . Bertucci (2002) (cited in Wesley & Pforr, 2010) argues that a healthy governance environment is the most important factor in making tourism a successful activity for sustainable development. He highlights three cores features of governance: (1) a transparent political environment that facilities representation and participation; (2) political and regulatory coherency; and (3) partnerships between state, private interests and civil society. Governance therefore signifies \"a new process of governing or a changed condition of ordered rule, or the new method by which society is governed\" (Rhodes, 1996, pp. 652e653) . It includes multiple stakeholders and emphasizes democracy, collaboration, coordination, stakeholder management, decentralization, community planning, powerpolitics, institutional arrangements and community participation (Caffyn & Jobbins, 2003; Robson & Robson, 1996; Sheldon & Abenoja, 2001; Tosun, 2000 Tosun, , 2006 Williams, Penrose, & Hawkes, 1998) .",

Governments do have several important roles to play in the governance process (Bramwell, 2011; Hall, 2005) . They are the principal actor in the political process of tourism development (Bramwell, 2011) . The governments may be in a position to offer incentives or impose requirements on actors to alter their behavior so as to promote sustainability (Bramwell, 2011) . However, if the goal of sustainable development is to be achieved, a new form of governance is needed. The role of government has to change from a steering role to one that engages with and manages partnerships (Beaumont & Dredge, 2010 Political economy concerns how politics affects choices in a society. It is a useful concept to understand how the political and economy conditions of a society shape the power relationship among key actors (Jessop, 2008) , especially the capacity and role of a government (Pierre, 1999) . The political economy approach starts from the proposition that the state is a \"social relation\" and is \"socially embedded\" (Jessop, 2008, pp. 1, 5) . The politicaleeconomic environment of a city establishes parameters and legitimacy for local political interaction and decision-making, especially the role of government in the decision-making process (Digaetano & Klemanski, 1999) . Conditions created by a particular politicale economic environment produce opportunities for developing certain governing alignments (alliances and power structures) while imposing constraints on others. According to Jessop's strategicrelational approach to political economy, actors are reflective and are capable of taking a strategic view of the structural constraints and are able to select their specific actions within those constraints strategically. Therefore, \"the strategic choices of actors and organizations in the state are likely to be affected by the structural pressures in a specific society, including the broad economic and socio-cultural change and the lobbying by actors in civil society\" (Bramwell, 2011, pp. 468e469) .",

Tourism planning concepts and approaches have changed considerably since the Second World War in response to the changing social circumstances. It began with the \"boosterism\" approach, upholding the view that tourism development was of automatic benefit to the hosts and therefore natural resources should be exploited for tourism development. The planning approach later shifted to an economic industryoriented approach, which regarded tourism as an industry that could be used as a government tool to achieve certain goals of economic growth (Hall, 2005) . In the 1970s, a rational planning approach was adopted, upholding the view that spatial planning could help to eliminate the negative impacts of tourism on the physical environment (Hall, 2005) . In the 1980s, critical/emancipatory approaches prevailed in response to the increased concerns about the negative environmental and social impacts of development and the realization that public choices could not be determined by a few technocrats. Realizing that local residents were stakeholders who might benefit from tourism activity, the emphasis was on communication and dialogue with the aim of achieving more community consensus (Habermas, 1984) . Finally, a sustainable approach emerged in the early 1990s which required each stakeholder to uphold the principles of sustainable development in decision-making and to work in a collaborative manner (Hall, 2005) .",

Gill and Williams (2011) reported the reasons for the shift in the mode of governance of the Canadian ski resort of Whistler from a pro-growth mode to a corporatist one which shows greater concern for sustainable development; this shift included realization of the degradation of the environmental conditions of the area, hosting the Winter Olympic Games, and the increasing political necessity of collaboration with local indigenous peoples.",

Institutions in the broadest definition are social rule structures with associated standing patterns of behavior and procedures (Lavoie, 1994) . In tourism planning, institutions often refer to the decision-making rules, procedures, established practices, systems and organizational arrangements (Bramwell & Lane, 2011; Tosun, 2000) . It is not uncommon for scholars to use the institutional approach to understand power. For instance, Andriotis (2002) found that the lack of a holistic and integrative institutional structure and framework to coordinate planning in Crete, Greece had resulted in a fragmentary planning approach that was easily led by private or economic interests. Bramwell (2011) also reported that in Malta tourism was pro-growth driven because the working group which was responsible for conducting a study on local tourism growth limits was composed of a hotelier and two tourist board officers who were pro-growth.",

First, power is not evenly distributed within a community. Some groups and individuals in society have relatively more influence than others on the governance processes affecting tourism due to their means of access to resources (Hall & Jenkins, 1995) . The power relations of a society are shaped by the political and economic structure of that society. These power relations determine the rules and regulations and are manifested in a city's institutional arrangements. In tourism, this means the planning administration, process, and practices which place constraints on some stakeholders while delegating power to others, and they determine who acquires the greatest governing power, their policy agendas, and the capability and role of government.",

Three main aspects of the two SARs' tourism planning institutional framework were studied; these include: (1) the tourism planning administration, (2) strategies, polices and guidelines, and (3) the tourism plan-making process. Data were mainly collected from the secondary sources. First, the SARs' government website was browsed to understand their administrative structure of planning. Second, the published documents on the urban planning law, regulations and policies, and government planning studies and reports were carefully reviewed. Attempts were made to understand what laws, polices and guidelines related to tourism planning exist in the two SARs, along with the content and scope of information given for development. Information on the planning law, regulations and policies could be obtained from the governments or from the governments' websites. Third, some case studies about the two cities' tourism planning as reported in newspapers and academic articles were also reviewed. These case studies provided further insights into the operation, system and practice of tourism planning in the two SARs. Although newspapers and media reports have their own limitations in terms of the data reliability, they provide some insights into the current news of the two SARs. To improve reliability, multiple sources were checked and used. Fourth, two government officials involved in public works and one academic specializing in urban planning and tourism in the two SARs were interviewed. Finally, direct observation was used, since the author has lived in Hong Kong and Macao for more than 10 years each and therefore has been able to observe the two SARs' politicaleeconomic conditions and their tourism planning practices.",

With Macao benefitting from the booming tourism and gaming sectors, the unemployment rate remains low (lower than Hong Kong), at 2.3% in 2011 (DSEC, 2012) . Gaming revenue accounts for more than 70 percent of the government's revenue. Hong Kong is governed by an executive-led polity. The governing power is concentrated in the hands of a Chief Executive (also known as Governor in the colonial period) and the appointed civil servants. The first Chief Executive was formally selected by a 400-member committee, his selection a result of both pro-Beijing leaders' active head-hunting and the preference of those local pro-Beijing elite members who were put into the selection committee through a process of quasi-appointment (Cheung, 2005) . Through the appointments of the local businessmen and professionals and pro-Beijing elites to the various important advisory committees e including the Executive Council (ExCo) (responsible for overall policymaking) and the Legislative Council (LegCo) (responsible for the approval of law making and government budget) e to advise him on major administrative decisions, the government is able to form an elite consensus politics (Cheung, 2005) . For instance, in the 2012 LegCo election, of the 70 LegCo members, 43 of them are pro-Beijing and 27 are pro-democracy (Cheng, 2012) . Also, among the 30 seats from the functional constituency (FC) that were elected by industry and professional groups, 18 of them represent the interests of the traditional business and professional elites (e.g., commercial, industrial, finance, accountancy, medical, legal, real estate and construction, architecture, surveying and planning, financial services, textiles and garment, import and export, and insurance).",

Hong Kong's manufacturing power grew in the 1950s, as a result of a \"transferred industrialization\" (Ng, 1999, p. 11 ) process initiated by mainland capitalists who fled to Hong Kong with the establishment of the communist People's Republic of China in 1949. The colonial government had practiced a laissezfaire industrial development policy. As the largest landlord in the territory, the government relied on land sales to \"boost the public coffers\" (Ng, 1999, p. 11) . Ng (p. 11) argues that \"the government had a larger stake in the development-related industries (such as property and financial sectors) rather than the manufacturing one. The development ideology is very much economic growthoriented. The invisible hand, the market, is a major means of urban governance in the HKSAR.\" The top-down elitist approach is reflected in its heritage and tourism planning practices. The declaration of which places, buildings, sites or structures should be designated as monuments for protection in Hong Kong is the sole responsibility of the Antiquities Authorities, after consultation with the Antiquities Advisory Boards and with the approval of the Chief Executive. There was no official mechanism for the public to launch a request for designating a historic building as a monument. The public was neither consulted before or after designation of monuments (Yung & Chan, 2011) .",

The post-1997 years saw an even more active community voice their demands and expectations to the government. Yung and Chan (2011, p. 459) observe, \"After 1997, Hong Kong people have increasingly strived for their own identity, and the need for social equity in acquiring more social spaces, and more democratic right, particularly, in city planning and development is growing.\" Henderson (2008) also comments that there are increasing numbers of professionals and researchers speaking up to protect the city's heritage and tourism resources (Henderson, 2008) . Cheung explains that this was because most of the Hong Kong people did not have a chance to elect their Chief Executive. Also, a number of bold initiatives set up by the first Chief Executive, Mr. Tung (such as the 85,000 housing target which turned Hong Kong into an IT hub and an international center for Chinese medicine), were not successfully launched due mainly to the Asian Financial Crisis. Hong Kong people were also upset about the top-down and paternalistic policymaking style of Tung and felt that their voices and needs, especially the quest for a more democratic society, were not being heard (Cheung, 2005) .",

However, unlike the previous period, these protests were more lively, spontaneous, and creative, and thus more difficult for the government to suppress. The new mode of political mobilization relied more on media and social networks supported by information technology (Chan & Lee, 2007) . In response to the increasingly politicized community, the HKSAR government has increased their transparency in policymaking since 1997.

This site was carefully protected by the previous colonial administration in the 1990s, which enforced a maximum development height of 20.5 m (Ponto Final, 2007) .

Without checksand-balance mechanisms, the existing institutional arrangement of Macao provides more access to, and the means to determine the use of, a city's resources; it encourages clientelism and could easily be led by private economic interests (Andriotis, 2002) .",

Macao's active civil community developed late when compared with Hong Kong, due to the overall lower level of education in Macao, fewer organized professional groups compared with Hong Kong, and long-term segregation and miscommunication between the Portuguese government and the locals. In Hong Kong, the mature political community led by the well-educated middle class and professionals was developed in the early 1980s. It has imposed significant challenges to the city's governance by actively demanding more transparency in policymaking. While Macao's casino gaming has contributed significantly to the local economy and employment opportunities (Wan, 2012) , Hong Kong does not show great achievements after the handover of power. Instead it has to deal with a lot of social and economic problems brought on by the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome and the Asian Financial Crisis. Hong Kong people are becoming even more vocal in demanding that their government handle all these problems, and they would like to be informed and involved in every policy made in the territory. This is also a reason why transparency and public participation in policymaking is more emphasized in Hong Kong than in Macao.",

It needs to act proactively and use more creative means to communicate plans to the public.

The major problem is the lack of rigorous research on economic diversification and a precise definition (Macau Daily Times, 2012b; Wan, 2012 ).

A centralized government body, such as the Hong Kong Commerce and Economic Development Bureau in charge of strategic tourism policymaking, should help to coordinate matters related to tourism development. Finally, sustainable tourism growth needs to incorporate the diverse values of different stakeholders in the decision-making process (Beaumont & Dredge, 2010; Wesley & Pforr, 2010) .

The number of tourists grew from 9.16 million in 2000 to 28 million in 2011 (DSEC, 2012). Casino operators increased from just one in 2002 to three in 2011 (managed by six companies). The number of casinos jumped from 11 to 34 over the same period(DICJ, 2011). World-famous casino resorts such as Wynn, Sands, Venetian, and Crown now have their own casinos in Macao.

Hong Kong is a Special Administrative Region (SAR) of the People's Republic of China. Following British rule from 1842 to 1997, China assumed sovereignty under the \"one country, two systems\" principle. The HKSAR is governed under the Basic Law of Hong Kong, which ensures that the current political situation will remain in effect for 50 years (HKSAR Government, 2012b). Financial services, trading and logistics, tourism, and professional services are the four key industries in the Hong Kong economy.
