[6] [7] [8] [9] Treatment of acute asthma National and international guidelines for the management of acute asthma recommend: (1) inhaled \u00df 2agonists for all patients, (2) systemic (usually oral) corticosteroids for those with moderate and severe asthma, and (3) repeated doses of inhaled \u03b2 2 -agonists and anticholinergics for severe cases. 6;7;9;10 The latter two recommendations independently reduce admission rates by 25% in studies of predominantly school-aged children. 11;12 Several features must be noted. First, recommendations are severity-specific; patients with mild asthma do not appear to benefit from oral corticosteroids. 11;13 Second, the concept of the \"golden first hour of treatment\" supports early and aggressive asthma management, as the risk of admission is only reduced when oral corticosteroids are administered 3 to 4 hours prior to the decision to admit. Third, of all treatments administered in the ED, oral corticosteroids are by far the most effective for preventing admission. 14 Fourth, there is no equally effective substitute for oral corticosteroids;",

Fifth, systemic corticosteroids are inexpensive generic drugs. Short treatment with oral corticosteroids is generally devoid of significant side effects, 19 though rare cases of fatal or disseminated varicella have been reported. 20 Sixth, while recommendations are relatively similar in young children, older children, and adults, the evidence for the former is weaker due to the underrepresentation of preschool-aged children in relevant trials. 11;12 While oral corticosteroids are the cornerstone of management of acute, moderate or severe asthma, 6 several reports have recently shaken the belief that they are equally effective for all patients with asthma, showing that children with viral-induced wheezing 21 and smoking adults 22 are corticosteroid-resistant. Indeed, in a large placebo-controlled randomized controlled trial of 700 children aged 10-60 months with mild-to-moderate viral-induced wheezing, oral corticosteroid was not superior to placebo for reducing the length of stay in hospital or improving the PRAM clinical score, despite adequate study power. 21 Critics have suggested that: (1) in most children, the disease may not have been asthma (documented in only 16% of patients) but rather the North American definition of bronchiolitis; (2) some patients (with mild asthma) may not have needed corticosteroids; 23 (3) the prolonged stay in hospital did not seem supported by severity, 24 and (4) the dose of 1 (instead of 2) mg/kg may have been insufficient. Yet, this study elicited major discomfort regarding acute asthma management in young children. 24 In another, adequately powered, landmark trial, 2-week treatment with prednisone showed marked blunting of response in adult smokers, with an improvement in forced expiratory volume in 1 second of 237 mL (95% CI: 43, 431) in never-smokers compared to no change or 47 (-148, 243) mL in current smokers. 22 The question remains as to whether smoking adolescents and children with environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) respond as well as those not exposed.",

Asthma, defined as airway obstruction (cough, dyspnoea, wheezing) with hyper-reactivity and reversibility with bronchodilator or corticosteroids, begins early in life 29;30 While children and adults meeting these criteria can be diagnosed at the first episode, generally three wheezing episodes are required for children \u226412 months to reduce the risk of misclassification with bronchiolitis. 8;31 Heterogeneous groups of children with bronchiolitis and asthma may explain the poor response to oral corticosteroids in studies including infants and toddlers. 21;24 Thus, an operational definition of asthma, clinically applicable to children aged 1-17 years, is needed to reasonably exclude bronchiolitis.",

[35] [36] [37] [38] The incidence of viral-induced asthma peaks in September and continues throughout the fall and winter. 32 In adults with acute asthma, viral infection is associated with longer hospital admission 39 and increased sputum neutrophils, suggesting a predominantly neutrophilic airway inflammation. 39 In a study of children aged 3-36 months, those infected with rhinovirus showed fewer relapses when treated with oral prednisone compared to placebo, suggesting that rhinovirus did not impair responsiveness to steroids. 40 In another placebo-controlled trial of 283 young children with wheezing, prednisolone did not significantly decrease the overall time to discharge; however, it reduced by half the length of stay in children infected with picornavirus and by fourfold that of children with enterovirus, suggesting that response may be organism-dependant. 41 Clearly, oral corticosteroids may not 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20  21  22  23  24  25  26  27  28  29  30  31  32  33  34  35  36  37  38  39  40  41  42  43  44  45  46  47  48  49  50  51  52  53  54  55  56  57  58  59  60   F  o  r  p  e  e  r  r  e  v  i  e  w  o  n  l  y   9 be as effective in patients with viral infections as in those without, perhaps due to neutrophilic airway inflammation, a condition associated with poor response to corticosteroids.

Heavier ETS exposure in preschoolers who spend more time at home than school-aged children 46,47 may explain a poorer response in young children. Objective documentation of smoking would also be important if possible, even before high school where many already smoke. 48 Of particular concern is whether a blunted response to oral corticosteroids would be found in children exposed to tobacco smoke and adolescents with a short history of active smoking. With 25% of asthmatic children exposed to ETS and 25% of teenagers actively smoking, [49] [50] [51] such an assessment appears critical.",

In the first group, we selected 8 polymorphisms in 7 genes that can be divided into those coding for xenobiotic metabolizing enzymes and those coding for mediators of inflammation and immunity, specifically the ones demonstrated to affect lung function, disease severity and interaction with exposure to ETS. 67; 68 We selected polymorphisms affecting gene function, top-ranking SNPs in a number of association studies. TGFB1 polymorphisms were found to correlate with disease severity; 69 CC16 polymorphisms play a role in the development and persistence of the asthma phenotype in childhood; 70 CD14 polymorphisms have been linked to pathogenesis of asthma and lung function in smokers. 71 The ORMDL3 gene confers susceptibility to early-onset asthma, particularly through interaction with early life exposure to ETS; 67;72 GSTM1 and GSTP1 are involved in the metabolism of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon derivatives and reactive oxygen species; 73;74 GSTM1 null and GSTP1 genotypes have been associated with an increased risk of asthma 75 and rapid decline of lung function among smokers. 76 The ADRB2 receptor gene was found to contribute to the occurrence of wheeze among children who were exposed to tobacco smoke in utero and early childhood 77 and related to \u03b2 2 -agonist response. 68;78 Among genes affecting the corticosteroid and inflammatory pathways, we selected genes (CHRH1, TBX21 FCER2, GLCC1, STIP1 and SERPINE1) that were shown to correlate with response to corticosteroids in patients with asthma; the finding for some of them was replicated in several cohorts. 79-82;82-84 All selected polymorphisms with the gene name, position and corresponding reference are summarized in Table.

            "text": "The need for hospital admission is a powerful marker of therapy failure, likely to alter physicians' practice and influence decision makers as hospital costs alone account for 43% of total asthma costs. 109 Although subject to practice variation, physician's decision to admit is usually based on an unsatisfactory response to bronchodilators and systemic corticosteroids in the ED, indicating severe asthma or poor response to corticosteroids. 22 Admission may be affected by other reasons, such as parental anxiety, distance, or fatigue, and of course, availability of ED and hospital beds. 50 Adding a cutoff length of ED stay, above which a patient is considered admitted, limits the impact of external factors (bed availabilities) which may vary widely within and between institutions. Moreover, incorporating return visits resulting in admission provides an additional measure of failure of ED treatment by adding a measure of the decision appropriateness. Time to meeting severity criteria for discharge (PRAM<4) and length of active treatment are two additional measures of interest, less influenced by factors other than severity. 14 Accurate and objective assessment of the severity of airway obstruction is clearly the biggest challenge in acute paediatric asthma research. Standard lung function tests, such as spirometry, require a forced expiratory manoeuvre that is extremely difficult and unreliable for preschool-aged children because of poor coordination; it is not obtainable in 35% to 50% of acutely ill school-aged children because of illness severity and/or poor familiarity with technique. [110] [111] [112] About three-quarters of asthmatic children cannot perform standard lung function tests in the ED setting. 113 In contrast, respiratory resistance by forced oscillation is an effort-independent measure that can be obtained in untrained acutely ill children aged \u22653 years 110 We and others have demonstrated the reproducibility and sensitivity to change of respiratory resistance 114 and established reference values for Canadian children. 115;116 Thus, the measure of respiratory resistance (Rrs) can serve as precise and reliable index of severity and response in acutely ill children, although still missing very young or uncooperative preschoolers and as such cannot serve as main outcome.",

[134] [135] [136] Throughout the induction, lung function tests using respiratory resistance will be documented to ensure that the coughing effort do not induce bronchospasm. 134 Sputum will be processed according to standard techniques within 8 hours of. Briefly, sputum will be separated from saliva and dispersed using dithiothreitol. The dispersed suspension is then centrifuged and filtered; cytospin slides will be prepared on site by a trained medical technologist, and the supernatant frozen at -70\u00b0C for subsequent quantification of inflammatory mediators. Differential cell counts and inflammatory mediators will each be analysed by an independent laboratory, blinded to exposure and outcome.",

Pilot data were extracted from two large recent chart audits 14;138 totalling 1628 children presenting with acute asthma to the ED (in which age, gender, baseline PRAM, timing of oral corticosteroids intake and admission were documented) and two recently completed trials 119;139 totalling 518 children, in whom tobacco exposure was also ascertained by questionnaire; we then focused only on children meeting our current eligibility criteria (age, baseline PRAM, corticosteroids within an hours of arrival). Based on the literature, we assumed the prevalence of viral pathogen varied between 60% and 80%. 140;141 The baseline risk of admission was 41%; after recruitment of the initial 320 patients, the observed overall risk of admission was substantially lower at 16%, which substantially reduced the effective sample size from 1200 to 800. First, using the Wald test (using prevalence of factor and risk of admission in unexposed), we calculated the sample size required to detect a risk difference (RD) of admission of 7.5%, taking each determinant in turn as the independent variable in a bivariate logistic regression; we used 95% confidence intervals for each estimate obtained from pilot data to examine the impact on power. 142 Then, using the method proposed by Hsieh et al. 143 25 we calculated the inflation factor to adjust the total sample size, based on the observed correlation between key determinants (age, gender and tobacco exposure, and baseline severity). As the observed correlation between determinants and severity and any pair of determinants was negligible (Phi coefficients < 0.03), there was no need to inflate the sample size. At an alpha of 0.05, a sample of 800 children had 80% power to detect a risk difference of admission of \u22657.5% for all key determinants. We targeted the risk difference of 7.5%, because it was considered in a survey of researchers of the Pediatric Emergency Research in Canada (PERC) network as a clinically meaningful effect size that would support a practice change. After documenting a 1% lost after enrolment (from 10% originally estimated) and 20% missing key samples (viral or cotinine), our target recruitment sample is 1008 to obtain an effective sample of 800 children. Acknowledging that the majority of selected polymorphisms have a minor allele frequency of at least 30% and using an alpha of 0.005 (with Bonferroni correction for 14 polymorphisms), 1008 children will provide 80% power to detect an OR of 1.5 between each polymorphism and admission. Finally, of the expected 400 children recruited at the University Health Centre Sainte-Justine, we estimated that 200 children would cooperate with eNO measurements and 60 with induced sputum.. These sample sizes should be adequate to detect a correlation coefficient as low as 0.2 to 0.35, respectively, with the area under the curve of the PRAM score during the ED with 80% power and a two-sided 0.05 \u03b1.",
