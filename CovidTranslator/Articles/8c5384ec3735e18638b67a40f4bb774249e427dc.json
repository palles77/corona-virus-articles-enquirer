The crystal structure of the protease domain was determined to a resolution of 2.4 \u00c5 using multiple isomorphous replacement and anomalous scattering. The SeMV protease domain exhibited the characteristic trypsin fold and was found to be closer to cellular serine proteases than to other viral proteases. The residues of the S1-binding pocket, H298, T279 and N308 were mutated to alanine in the DN70-Protease -VPg polyprotein, and the cis-cleavage activity was examined. The H298A and T279A mutants were inactive, while the N308A mutant was partially active, suggesting that the interactions of H298 and T279 with P1-glutamate are crucial for the E -T/S cleavage. A region of exposed aromatic amino acids, probably essential for interaction with VPg, was identified on the protease domain, and this interaction could play a major role in modulating the function of the protease.

To accomplish cleavage at specific sites, viruses employ one or more proteases with unique cleavage specificities. In an earlier study, we have shown that in SeMV, the processing is mediated by the Nterminal protease domain coded by ORF2 (Satheshkumar et al., 2004) . It is a serine protease, similar to cellular proteases like trypsin and chymotrypsin (Gorbalenya et al., 1988) . The catalytic residues are H181, D216 and S284. The protease cleaves the ORF2 polyprotein at three different positions, at E325-T326, E402-T403 and E498-S499 to release four different domains-protease, VPg (viral protein genome linked), p10 and RdRP (RNA-dependent RNA polymerase) (Satheshkumar et al., 2004) . In most other viruses that have VPg at the 5V end of their genome, the domain arrangement is VPg -protease, whereas, in sobemoviruses, it is protease -VPg.",

The serine protease domain lacking the 70 amino acids (DN70-Pro) was found to be inactive in trans. However, the presence of VPg at the C-terminus of DN70-Pro rendered the polyprotein active in cis and trans. By mutational analysis, it was demonstrated that interaction of W43 in the VPg domain with the protease was responsible for both cis and trans proteolytic activities and the associated conformational changes. It was suggested that the natively unfolded VPg is an activator of the protease and could regulate the polyprotein processing.",

It was found that the solubility and the activity of the protease were enhanced by the deletion of 70 (DN70-Pro) and 92 (DN92-Pro) residues. The DN70-Pro and DN92-Pro domains of the polyprotein were cloned, expressed and purified as described earlier (Satheshkumar et al., 2004) . Both DN70-Pro and DN92-Pro domains were crystallized using microbatch method in the presence of 0.2 M Tris, pH 8.0, 0.2 M ammonium sulphate, 0.6 M 1,6-hexane diol, 5 mM hmercaptoethanol and 4% glycerol.

The Ntermini of both DN70-Pro and DN92-Pro therefore correspond to the residue V135.

SeMV protease does not have any significant sequence similarity to any of the cellular or viral serine proteases.

The side chain of D216 is stabilized by two hydrogen bonds-between its Oy1 and the main chain N of H181, and its Oy2 and Ny1 of H181. The N(2 of H181 is at a hydrogen bonding distance from Og of S284, although the geometry for the hydrogen bond is not optimal. The electron density for the imidazole ring of the H181 is not very clear, implying conformational flexibility. This is a feature found in the active site histidines of other serine proteases also. In the HRV protease, the active site H40 exists in alternate conformations (Petersen et al., 1999) , while in the polio viral 3C protease, the electron density for the side chain is weak, and the mean temperature factor of the atoms is above the average (Mosimann et al., 1997) . The oxyanion hole, a highly conserved region of the active site in terms of sequence (GXSG) and structure, is important for the stabilization of the oxyanion intermediate formed during the reaction. In SeMV protease, the main chain amide nitrogens of G282 and S284 are involved in the oxyanion hole formation.

Mutational analyses have demonstrated that the serine protease domain of SeMV cleaves at E -T occurring between protease -VPg, and VPg-p10 domains, and also at E -S between p10 and RdRP (Satheshkumar et al., 2004) . In order to understand the structural basis of the stringent cleavage specificity of the enzyme, a comparison was carried out between SeMV protease and the structures of other proteases that display glutamate specificity (Table 2C ). It was observed that the histidine that binds to the carbonyl oxygen of Glu/Gln is conserved in all Glu/Gln-specific proteases except the S. griseus proteases (2sga and 2sgp) where a positively charged arginine at the base of the substrate-binding pocket stabilizes the glutamate (Read et al., 1983; Read and James, 1988) . The corresponding residue in SeMV protease is H298, and it is directed towards the active site. Ny1of H298 forms a hydrogen bond with N(2 of H275 (Fig. 4A) . The conformation of H275 side chain is, in turn, stabilized by a hydrogen bond from Ny1 to the main chain N of the disulfidebonded C277. In the glutamate-specific S. griseus protease (1hpg), the role of the histidine triad, H213, H199 and H228 (1hpg numbering), in stabilizing the charge on glutamic acid has been emphasized (Nienaber et al., 1993) . In SeMV protease, a corresponding histidine triad does not exist, and H275 hydrogen bonded to the conserved H298 is not in the same position as that of H199 in the S. griseus protease. However, the chain of hydrogen bonds is maintained. This can possibly help in the stabilization of the charge of the glutamic acid side chain. The residues present in the proposed glutamate-binding site or the S1 pocket are T279, A280, H298, F301 and N308 (Fig.  4A) . Out of these residues, only H298 and T279 are conserved across most of the Glu/Gln-binding proteins. In a few cases, Thr is replaced by Ser, whose Og substitutes for the Thr Og. His and Thr have been implicated to have a major role in Glu/ Gln binding, and the mutations of these have resulted in inactive enzymes in poliovirus 3C protease (Ivanoff et al., 1986) . In the crystal structure of TEV complexed with substrate, it has been observed that the carboxyamide group of glutamine forms hydrogen bonds with both His and Thr (Phan et al., 2002) .",

These aromatic residues F269, W271, Y315 and Y319 are not consecutive in sequence but form a stack near the C-terminus of the protein. Two of these residues form part of the C-terminal helix. These residues may be of functional significance to the polyprotein. SeMV residues F269 and W271 are conserved across genomes of sobemoviruses. The presence of exposed aromatic residues is believed to indicate a protein -protein interaction interface. It has been demonstrated that there are extensive interactions between protease and VPg, and the conformational changes that accompany these interactions enhance and regulate protease activity (Satheshkumar et al., 2005) . W43 of VPg was shown to mediate aromatic interactions with the protease, which results in a positive peak at 230 nm in the CD spectrum of protease -VPg fusion protein, but the interacting partner in protease was not identified. The presence of exposed aromatic residues in the present structure strongly suggests that this might be the site of protease -VPg interaction. It is probable that W271 of protease interacts with W43 of VPg domain. The positive peak observed at 230 nm in the CD spectrum of protease -VPg fusion protein might be the result of this interaction. Further mutational studies are required to delineate the significance of the aromatic stretch of residues in protease activity.",

The presence of a C-terminal helix is a characteristic of many serine proteases. The disordered short segment at the Cterminus is not long enough to reach the active site suggesting the possibility of intermolecular cleavage between protease and VPg (trans-cleavage). However, it is possible that there could be a major conformational change because of the presence of the natively unfolded VPg at the C-terminus, and this may position the residues for cis-cleavage at the active site.",

The relative positions of the N-terminus and the active site suggest that an intramolecular cleavage is indeed possible. The N-terminus in the crystal structure is disordered, and clear electron density is observed only from S138. A further extension of approximately four residues is long enough to approach the active site through the cleft below the bII-cII loop of domain II. This gains additional support by the observation that the N-terminus of SeMV protease superposes very well with the glutamyl endopeptidase from Bacillus intermedius (1p3c), as shown in Fig. 7 . In the case of 1p3c, the N-terminus extends to the active site, and this extension is essential for zymogen activation and charge compensation for glutamate specificity (Meijers et al., 2004) . Therefore, based on the relative positions of the N-and C-termini and the active site in the crystal structure, it can be concluded that the cleavage between protease and VPg could occur in cis or trans, while the N-terminal cleavage could be cis.",

The residues Ala and Val are small and could be accommodated in the active site without steric hindrance. These observations also suggest that the specificity of the protease depends not only on sequence but also on the conformation of the polypeptide. A non-specific cleavage on the polypeptide chain has been observed at the Cterminus of TEV protease also (Nunn et al., 2005) . There have also been reports in the literature on other viral proteases such as rhinovirus HRV2-2A protease, where the specificity requirements for cis-cleavage are less stringent than for trans-cleavage. The entropy term for substrate binding is favorable in ciscleavage, and hence, the specificity requirements are less stringent (Petersen et al., 1999) . In spite of this, most viral proteases are extremely specific, and they function mainly in the processing of the respective polyproteins. Their activities are modulated by the presence of VPg domains either at the N-or Cterminus. Determination of the structure of the protease with the VPg domain could shed light on the molecular mechanism of such regulations.",

Both isomorphous and anomalous difference Patterson maps were calculated for these derivatives using CCP4 program suite and Harker sections for the space group P3 1 21 were plotted.",

The rest of the sites in all the derivatives were identified from the difference Fourier maps using MLPHARE in CCP4 program suite (1994) . The fractional coordinates of all the sites, their occupancies and anomalous occupancies were refined in MLPHARE for all the derivatives to a resolution of 2.8 \u00c5 . The B-factors of the sites were not refined and were fixed at the values obtained from the Wilson plots. The space group was confirmed to be P3 1 21, as this choice resulted in an interpretable map with the correct handedness.",

This resulted in the placement of 34 residues with side chains and 123 without side chains into the electron density map. The coordinates of the partial model and the phases from RESOLVE were used as input for ARP/wARP version 6.1 (Morris et al., 2003) for building the rest of the model. 80% of the residues were built by the program, which included residues 140-161, 174-194, 205 -250, 257 -303 and 306-323 . The rest of the residues were built manually in subsequent cycles of refinement using COOT (Emsley and Cowtan, 2004) and REFMAC 5.2 (Murshudov et al., 1997) . The progress of the refinement was monitored by using 5% (459) of the total 9272 independent reflection measurements for the calculation of the free R-factor. The Hendrickson -Lattman coefficients were used as restraints during the refinement (Skubak et al., 2004) . Individual B-factors of non-hydrogen atoms were refined.",

The sense and antisense primers were designed with desired changes in the nucleotides (Table 3) , and restriction sites were incorporated in the primers to enable easy screening. The PCR was carried out using Deep Vent polymerase (New England Biolabs) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The PCR product was treated with 0.5 Al DpnI enzyme at 37 -C for 45 min to remove the template DNA and transformed into 2 aliquots of DH5a competent cells. The cells were plated after transformation in antibiotic containing plates. The colonies obtained were inoculated separately. Plasmid isolation was carried out and digested with the appropriate restriction enzyme. The mutants screened by restriction enzyme digestion were further confirmed for the presence of mutation by DNA sequencing. E. coli BL21 (DE3) pLysS cells were transformed with the recombinant clones, and the proteins were expressed by induction with 0.3 mM IPTG for 4 -5 h at 30 -C. The cell pellet was resuspended in buffer A (50 mM Tris -HCl, pH 8.0, 300 mM NaCl, 0.2% Triton X100, 5% Glycerol), sonicated and the expression was checked by SDS polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The cleavage activity was monitored by the appearance of bands of expected size on the SDS polyacrylamide gel. The results were confirmed by Western blot analysis as described in Satheshkumar et al. (2004) .",
