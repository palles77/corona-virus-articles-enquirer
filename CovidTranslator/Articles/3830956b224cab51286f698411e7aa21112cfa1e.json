Methods: In a multi-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, we recruited 480 adults aged 18 to 65 years within 36 h of onset of influenza-like symptoms. There were 225 patients with confirmed influenza. Eligible patients were randomly assigned 6 g of Antiwei (n Z 360) or placebo (n Z 120) twice daily for three days. All patients recorded their temperature and symptoms on diary cards during treatment. Analyses were performed in both the influenza-like population and the influenza-confirmed population.",

            "text": "Influenza caused by infection with either influenza A or B viruses, is one of the most common and important respiratory illnesses affecting all ages. Uncomplicated influenza is generally resolved over a 2-to 5-day period, although cough and malaise can persist for weeks. Influenza epidemics such as the influenza A (H1N1) pandemic in 2009, which is the first pandemic since 1968, are associated with increased morbidity and hospitalization rates, and excess mortality 1,2 within the most vulnerable populations, including the elderly, infants and those with underlying medical conditions. 3 Although drugs such as the adamantanes (i.e., amantadine and rimantadine) and the neuraminidase inhibitors (i.e., oseltamivir and zanamivir) are available to treat or prevent influenza, recent emergence of adamantane resistant strains has rendered these agents less effective. 4, 5 In addition, sporadic cases of oseltamivir-resistant influenza A (H1N1) virus infection have been reported worldwide following the H1N1 pandemic of 2009. 6 Even though vaccination strategies against influenza A (H1N1) virus are now present in China, some patients may look beyond conventional treatments and consider complementary and alternative medicines, including traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), in this situation. TCM represents one aspect of Chinese medical philosophy that is characterized by an emphasis on maintaining and restoring balance. Chinese medicinal herbs, the most important component of TCM, are derived from plants and usually incorporate one or more herbs as the basic drugs to treat the disease. 7 Supplemental use of Chinese medicinal herbs were found to be beneficial in the management of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003 8e10 and, based on that supplementary treatment, Chinese medicinal herbs might also show promise for treating or preventing influenza and influenza-like illness. Some randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have been published, but the evidence for treating or preventing influenza by TCM has not yet been convincingly established, due to poor reporting quality and small sample size. 11, 12 Antiwei granule is a traditional Chinese prescription, consisting of Mahuang (Herba Ephedra), Baimaogeng (Rhizoma Imperatae), Gegen(Radix puerariae), Guizhi (Ramulus Cinnamoumum), Kuxingren (Semen Armeniacae Amarum.), Ganjiang (Rhizoma Zingiberis) and Gancao (Radix Glycyrrhizae). One gram of Antiwei granule equals 3.83 g of crude drug. The resource, pharmacological actions and components in this formula are listed in Table 1 . 13 According to TCM, Mahuang and Baimaogen in this formula, which are regarded as \"the principal\" herbs, could relieve exterior disorder and defervesce. Gegen and Guizhi, which serve as \"the Minister\", cooperate with \"the principal\" to relieve exterior syndrome and defervesce. Kuxingren and Ganjiang are \"the adjuvant drug\", which can open the inhibited lung-energy, regulate the flow of Qi, eliminate phlegm and relieve cough. Gancao serves as \"the guiding drug\", which can moisten lung to arrest cough and coordinate all of the drug actions of this formula.",

According to Treatise on Cold-induced Diseases (Shang Han Lun), a variety of herbal formulas have been used to treat patients with infectious diseases for over 1800 years. Chinese medicine is widely accepted amongst Chinese populations. The use of Chinese medicine in treating pandemic and endemic diseases has long been described in traditional medical books such as Shang Han Lun, and Huangdi's Canon of Medicine (HuangDi Nei Jing). The prescriptions for infectious diseases were made based on the clinical presentations, rather than laboratoryconfirmed pathogens, which were beyond their knowledge at that time. Only a small fraction of the thousands of medicinal plants used worldwide has been tested rigorously in randomized, placebo-controlled trials. Yet randomized, controlled trials are the best way to demonstrate the efficacy of any medical, herbal or conventional therapy. 25 Although herbs or herbal products, as part of complementary and alternative therapies, have been proposed, their effectiveness in treating or preventing influenza has not been established beyond reasonable doubt. 11 The extract of elderberry was used to treat the influenza in the past, 26 and two studies have demonstrated a significant benefit of herbal products in prophylaxis against viral infection. 27, 28 Herbal supplement users have also reported significant improvement in influenza-like symptoms such as chills, cough, fatigue, and headache and quality-of-life measures such as mental health score, 27 as they have in our study.

            "text": "A variety of Chinese herbs have been widely used as antipyretic drugs for clearing accumulated heat in the lungs, according to the theory of TCM. One recent study by Kubo T. et al. showed that there is a more antipyretic effect of Mao-to, a Japanese herbal medicine, for treatment of type A influenza infection in children, in comparison to Oseltamivir. 29 The Japanese traditional herbal medicine includes Mahuang, Guizhi, Kuxingren and Gancao, which as components were included in Antiwei. In our study, the antipyretic effect was apparent within 24 h of Antiwei administration, when influenza symptoms are generally most troublesome. Although we did not assess economic effects, the indirect costs of influenza such as workplace absenteeism and performance at work could be improved according to the clinical benefits observed in the influenza-confirmed population and in the population with influenza-like illness. 30 Studies in animal experiments and in vitro, have confirmed that Antiwei can inhibit growth of a variety of virus, including influenza A and B, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), adenovirus etc (data not shown). We now show that Antiwei can significantly reduced the positive rate of influenza virus after treatment. These findings are consistent with results from studies of other antiviral drugs for influenza and other self-limiting viral diseases, for which increased therapeutic benefit is obtained when treatment is started as early as possible after symptom onset. 31 The duration of cough and expectoration was shorter and the severity of the two symptoms was generally lower in the Antiwei groups (data not shown). Influenza is transmitted by virus-laden secretions. Cough and expectoration could be the most distressing symptoms of influenza and also contributes to the spread of infection. Patients who received Antiwei had significantly lower positive rate of virus on laryngopharynx swabs than those in the placebo group. Such differences, together with improvement of symptoms, including cough and expectoration, may help to reduce transmission of the virus.",

Only one patient given Antiwei reported mild paroxysmal palpitation, which was resolved within two days without additional treatment. This symptom was not associated with discontinuation rates in the Antiwei group compared to placebo. No other adverse effects or abnormalities in laboratory test were associated with Antiwei treatment. It must be noted that the Antiwei contains Mahuang, which has been reported to have some side effects (such as chest pain, hypertension, arrhythmia, myocardial infarction, stroke, or death 32 ) when served as a dietary supplement for weight reduction and performance enhancement, but the use of Mahuang in this study was not associated with any significant adverse events. In our prescription, 6 g of Antiwei equals to 23 g of crude herbs, in which there is 2.5 g of Mahuang, so the daily dose of Mahuang was only 5.0 g, which is a small dosage compared with the conventional dose in other TCM treatments.",

Antiwei might also be a potent medication for use in influenza pandemics and in situations where a shortage of antiviral agents and vaccines exists. Our findings provide a rationale for continuing studies of this agent in the treatment of influenza, and these should now include studies in children and in high-risk populations. Further large-scale studies to investigate the other antiviral effect of Antiwei, and studies of its mechanism(s) are also now required.",
