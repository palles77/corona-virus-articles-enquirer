Follow-up specimens were available within 30 days for 179 infections, creating the sample set to assess prolonged rhinovirus presence. Of the 179 infections, 46 involved the detection of the same rhinovirus strain in repeated specimens, including 8 events of prolonged presence of the same strain (detected in specimens collected .30 days apart), representing 4.5% of the evaluable rhinovirus infections. There were 26 events in which a rhinovirus strain was replaced by a different strain within a 30-day interval, representing 14.5% of the 179 infections. CONCLUSIONS: Although rhinovirus infections are common in healthy infants, prolonged presence of rhinovirus RNA in the respiratory tract after an upper respiratory infection was uncommon (,5%). Detection of rhinovirus RNA in an infant most likely represents an infection within a 30-day period.

Prolonged duration of rhinovirus infections has been described in immunocompromised patients: 4 months in a pediatric stem cell transplant patient, 9 8 to 15 months in adult recipients of lung transplants, 10 and up to 4 months in adult patients with primary hypogammaglobulinemia. 11 To date, the study of persistent or novel repeated rhinovirus infections in infants during the first year of life when humans are first exposed to these viruses has not been reported.",

PCR is more sensitive than viral culture; this characteristic, together with the ability of some respiratory viruses (adenovirus, picornaviruses) to persist after infection or to cause asymptomatic infections, can confound the interpretation of positive PCR results. Application of a cutoff value to quantitative PCR may identify clinically relevant rhinovirus infections. 12 Largescale longitudinal studies involving rhinovirus strain characterization are lacking, particularly in infants and children without underlying conditions. Most studies involve children with underlying illness or strain characterization is absent or limited. We previously showed that sequential specimens from children with URI were frequently positive for rhinovirus. 13 The aim of this study was to characterize rhinoviruses that are detected repeatedly in sequential samples, to differentiate new infections from prolonged presence of viral nucleic acids. We herein describe the results of sequence analysis of rhinovirus RNA detected in nasopharyngeal specimens from infants during URI episodes and monthly asymptomatic visits.",

Study subjects were recruited from the UTMB newborn nursery or the primary care pediatric clinics; they were healthy and resided in Galveston. Preterm infants and those with major medical problems or anatomic/ physiologic defects of the ear or nasopharynx were excluded. Subjects were enrolled from near birth (before 1 month of age) and followed to the first AOM episode, or between 6 and 12 months of age. Subjects completed the study at age 6 months if AOM developed before 6 months or were followed up to 12 months for AOM occurrence. Nasopharyngeal swabs were collected at 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 months and at 9 months if the subjects still remained in the study. During the follow-up period, parents were instructed to report to the study team as soon as the subject began to develop cold symptoms: nasal stuffiness, runny nose, cough, and sore throat, with or without constitutional symptoms such as fever, decreased appetite, and restless sleep. The Institutional Review Board of UTMB approved the study protocol. Written informed consent was obtained from the parents on behalf of the infants.",

Consistent with our earlier study that examined the persistence of adenovirus nucleic acids in nasopharyngeal secretions, 13 we used a 30-day cutoff to define prolonged presence of rhinovirus RNA. Other studies have also used a 30-day time limit to distinguish between new and repeated nucleic acid detection. 21 Of the 179 rhinovirus infections analyzed, 148 (83%) had between 2 and 11 follow-up specimens that were negative for the specific rhinovirus strain. This finding provided strong evidence that the rhinovirus strain was permanently rather than transiently absent. Clinically, this finding was associated with a lack of symptoms and likely indicated a resolution of infection. Of 179 rhinovirus infections that were evaluated, RNA was detected in 133 (74%) in only a single specimen; 46 (26%) infections showed repeated detection of the same strain. Half of the repeated rhinovirus RNA events were #7 days in duration; the majority of repeat positives occurred within a 30-day window. Among the 46 infections with repeated isolates, there were a total of 99 isolates, for an average of 2.2 per infection. The majority of the 46 infections had 2 isolates, several had 3, and none had .3.

Infants can be infected with a variety of rhinovirus strains throughout the first year of life. Indeed, our data show that repeated detection of rhinovirus RNA from nasopharyngeal specimens from infants is more likely to represent new infection than prolonged presence .30 days. Among the 179 rhinovirus infections studied, there were 26 occurrences of a rhinovirus strain being replaced by a different strain within the 30-day follow-up period, compared with only 8 prolonged rhinovirus infections. Persistent rhinovirus infections (or prolonged presence of rhinovirus RNA) have been described, usually in patients with underlying conditions. Wood et al 22 examined rhinovirus RNA persistence in 39 subjects (both children and adults) with acute asthma. Patients were followed up once at 4 to 6 weeks posthospital admission. Very few positive viral specimens had sequence analysis performed, so it was difficult to assess how frequently persistence of the same rhinovirus strain occurred. Chronic rhinovirus infection and persistence of RNA have also been described in transplant patients 9,10 and in those with hypogammaglobulinemia. 11 Jartti et al 8 studied serial rhinovirus infections in infants at risk of developing asthma. Considering only moderateto-severe rhinovirus infections, 1 of 150 (0.7%) was associated with the same rhinovirus strain detected at least 2 weeks apart. Because our study included all rhinovirus occurrences regardless of symptoms, our observed higher rate of rhinovirus persistence (8 of 179 [4.5%] .30 days and 16 of 179 [8.9% ] .14 days) was not surprising. Unlike other studies, including the Jartti study in infants at risk of asthma, the infants in our study had no underlying conditions. ",

These are most likely false negatives due to low rhinovirus RNA viral load or to inadequate sample collection. Reinfection by the same rhinovirus strain is unlikely due to host immunity. Two cases had an intervening sample positive for a different rhinovirus strain, highlighting the number and variety of rhinovirus infections during infancy.The 8 cases of prolonged rhinovirus RNA presence in our study occurred both in the presence and absence of upper respiratory symptoms. The longest in-As expected, the presence or development of symptoms appeared to be associated with an increase in viral load, whereas the absence or resolution of symptoms was associated with a decrease in viral load.Our study limitations are common to most studies of this type and include the inability to detect rhinovirus RNA present at very low levels, particularly in mixed infections. This inability would result in underreporting of rhinovirus infections, likely including events of prolonged presence. Not all samples had follow-up testing at regular intervals to address the question of virus persistence. However, our criteria for follow-up testing were very strict. If the criteria were relaxed, our number of evaluable rhinovirus infections would have increased substantially, which, in turn, would have decreased the proportion of cases with prolonged rhinovirus presence. On the basis of sample collection, our reported intervals between repeated isolates of rhinovirus RNA may not have always reflected the true duration of persistence, but they provide a more accurate indication than in previous reports. Future studies to provide more precise measurement of rhinovirus Cases of prolonged presence of rhinovirus RNA in infants. Each specimen is represented by a solid black (I) or double (II) vertical hash marks. Solid marks (I) represent specimens collected during symptomatic URI, and double marks (II) indicate collection during asymptomatic monthly visits. Rhinovirus strains in boxes represent those with repeated presence .30 days apart. Pos/ND, rhinovirus qRT-PCR positive, sequence not determined; Neg, rhinovirus qRT-PCR negative. persistence should include studies with more frequent, longitudinal sampling with viral load measurement. Future directions for further study might also include multicenter studies for larger numbers of patients. In summary, we showed that in otherwise healthy infants in the first year of life, rhinovirus URI infrequently resulted in prolonged presence (.30 days) of rhinovirus RNA in the respiratory tract. Infants often have repeated infections with different rhinovirus strains in the first year of life. The detection of rhinovirus RNA by qRT-PCR in this population most likely represents current or recent infection. Rhinovirus infections in young,otherwise healthy infants rarely result in persistence of RNA beyond 30 days. The detection of rhinovirus RNA most likely represents recent infection. Further studies with frequent follow-up visits will help define the duration of virus shedding in rhinovirus infections with various clinical manifestations.",
