            "text": "Manipulation of the cell cycle and induction of apoptosis are two common strategies used by many viruses to regulate their infection cycles. In cells infected with coronaviruses, cell cycle perturbation and apoptosis were observed in several reports. However, little is known about how these effects are brought out, and how manipulation of the functions of host cells would influence the replication cycle of coronavirus. In this study, we demonstrate that infection with coronavirus infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) imposed a growth-inhibitory effect on cultured cells by inducing cell cycle arrest at S and G 2 /M phases in both p53-null cell line H1299 and Vero cells. This cell cycle arrest was catalyzed by the modulation of various cell cycle regulatory genes and the accumulation of hypophosphorylated RB, but was independent of p53. Proteasome inhibitors, such as lactacystin and NLVS, could bypass the IBV-induced S-phase arrest by restoring the expression of corresponding cyclin/Cdk complexes. Our data also showed that cell cycle arrest at both S-and G 2 /M-phases was manipulated by IBV for the enhancement of viral replication. In addition, apoptosis induced by IBV at late stages of the infection cycle in cultured cells was shown to be p53-independent. This conclusion was drawn based on the observations that apoptosis occurred in both IBV-infected H1299 and Vero cells, and that IBV infection did not affect the expression of p53 in host cells.",

            "text": "Host factors are involved in all steps of the viral replication cycle. Concomitantly, host gene expression and anti-viral defense mechanisms are modulated by viruses in order to optimize their own replication. Two aspects of such regulations with increasing importance are the viral manipulation of the progression of host cell cycle and apoptosis. Cell cycle progression is triggered by the activation of a series of cyclindependent kinases (Cdks), which form complexes with cyclins, and are regulated by the availability of the cyclin subunit, changes in phosphorylation state, and association with cellular Cdk inhibitors (CKIs), such as p21 Cip1 , p27 Kip1 , p 57Kip2 , and p16 ink4a , whose expression is also tightly controlled (Morgan, 1995; Nurse, 2004; Sherr and Roberts, 1999) . Viruses may manipulate host cell cycle to maximize their own replication. Apoptosis constitutes part of the host cell defense mechanisms against viral infection (Benedict et al., 2002; Hay and Kannourakis, 2002) . Viral infection could activate a variety of signal transduction pathways that lead to apoptosis of the infected cells. A number of viruses and their gene products were found to be able to induce apoptosis (Roulston et al., 1999; Teodoro and Branton, 1997) . Apoptosis can also facilitate the release of progeny virus and thus plays important roles in the viral life cycle during a lytic infection (Roulston et al., 1999) . In this report, we study the cell cycle manipulation and induction of apoptosis in cells infected with coronavirus using avian infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) as a model system.",

In 2003, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) emerged as a dangerous pandemic agent that caused a highly contagious health threat with a fatality rate of 10% (Ksiazek et al., 2003) . IBV, the prototype of coronavirus, is the etiological agent of infectious bronchitis which impairs the respiratory and urogenital tracts of chickens. Recently, a number of reports highlighted that coronaviruses and their encoded proteins could induce cell cycle perturbation. Murine coronavirus mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) and its nonstructural protein p28 were shown to induce G 0 /G 1 arrest (Chen and Makino, 2004; Chen et al., 2004a) . The nucleocapsid (N) protein of SARS-CoV disrupts cytokinesis and blocks S-phase progression in mammalian cells by inhibiting the activity of cyclin-Cdk complex (Li et al., 2005; Surjit et al., 2006) , and SARS-CoV infection increased the number of hepatocytes undergoing mitosis (Chau et al., 2004) . Various coronaviruses and their encoded proteins were also found to be inducers of apoptosis. These include both structural and nonstructural proteins of SARS-CoV (Chau et al., 2004; Chow et al., 2005; Law et al., 2005; Surjit et al., 2004; Tan et al., 2004; Yang et al., 2005) , IBV (Liu et al., 2001) , TGEV (Eleouet et al., 1998) , and MHV (Liu et al., 2003) and its E protein . However, the involvement of p53, which is a key mediator of apoptosis, has never been reported.",

To rule out the possibility that this cell cycle arrest is Vero cell-specific, search for other cell lines that are susceptible to the Vero cell-adapted IBV was carried out, resulting in the selection of a number of cell lines that support efficient IBV infection (data not shown). Among them, H1299, a human lung carcinoma cell line, was used in this study. Similar to the typical cytopathic effects (CPE) in Vero cells, IBV infection of H1299 cells showed rounding up and fusion of infected cells to form giant multinucleated syncytia, detachment of infected cells from the culture dish, and eventually cell lysis and death (Fig. 1a) . The infected cells were further analyzed by Western blot with anti-IBV N protein antibodies. A typical N protein profile was detected (Fig. 1a) . These results confirm that the Vero celladapted IBV could efficiently infect H1299 cells. As H1299 is a p53-null cell line (Gjoerup et al., 2001) , it also provides a good cell system for studying the involvement of p53 in IBV-induced cell cycle arrest and apoptosis.",

Determination of total cell number showed that IBV inhibited cell growth in an MOI-and time-dependent manner (Fig. 1b) . The reduction in cell number for H1299 cells was more significant than that of Vero cells (Fig. 1b) . Further analysis of cell proliferation by MTT assay showed that, at a MOI of 1, IBV infection inhibited the growth of both cell lines efficiently, although H1299 cells were more sensitive to IBV infection (Fig. 1c) . These results demonstrate that IBV infection inhibits cell proliferation, and the p53 status is not a determinant for IBV-mediated growth inhibition. However, p53 might play a certain role, as more obvious inhibition of growth was observed in p53-null cells.",

As cyclin A, Cdk2 and cyclin D1 were reported to be degraded through ubiquitindependent proteolysis pathway in tumor cells and in cells infected with coxsackievirus (Chen et al., 2004b; Luo et al., 2003) , Western blot analysis of these proteins were carried out in IBV-infected H1299 cells in the presence of proteasome inhibitors, lactacystin and NIP-leu-leu-leu-vinylsulfone (NLVS). As can be seen in Fig. 4a , IBV infection induced a 22% increase of S-phase cells at 24 h post-infection (compared 'Mock' with 'DMSO'). Addition of both lactacystin and NLVS annulled the S-phase cell cycle arrest and restored the expression of cyclin A, Cdk2 and cyclin D1 protein in a dose-dependent manner (Figs. 4a and b) . Lactacystin was shown to be more efficient than NLVS, except in the stabilization of cyclin A (Figs. 4a and b) . The effectiveness of the proteasome inhibitors was also proved by the accumulation of multiubiquitinated proteins (Fig. 4b) . The level of Cdk1 remained unchanged under identical experimental conditions (Fig. 4b) . These data suggest that IBV infection specifically promotes the degradation of cyclin A, Cdk2 and cyclin D1 through a proteasome-dependent mechanism, leading to the cell cycle arrest.",

A substantial increase in the number of apoptotic cells was observed at 36 h post-infection in both cell lines (Fig. 6a ). Nuclear staining with Hoechst showed apparently distorted and fragmented nuclei (Fig. 6b) . As the TUNEL assay could distinguish apoptotic cells undergoing DNA fragmentation by adding labeled nucleotides to the fragmented DNA ends, cells even at early stages of apoptosis could be visualized by horseradish peroxidase colorimetric reaction. As shown in Fig. 6b , the number of TUNEL signal-positive cells was drastically increased at 36 and 48 h post-infection in both cell lines (Fig. 6b) . Addition of the broad caspase inhibitor, QVD, significantly reduced the detection of the TUNEL signal- positive cells. These data strongly suggest that IBV infection is capable of inducing apoptosis irrespective of the presence or absence of functional cellular p53.",

In this study, we demonstrate that IBV infection induces cell cycle arrest at the S and G 2 /M phases at early stages and apoptosis at late stages of the viral infection cycle on cultured mammalian cells. The cell arrest at the S and G 2 /M phases was catalyzed by viral modulation of various cell cyclins/Cdks and the accumulation of hypophosphorylated RB. Our data also showed that cell cycle arrest was manipulated by IBV for the benefit of viral replication. As IBV-induced cell cycle arrest and apoptosis were detected in both p53-null H1299 cells and wild-type p53containing Vero cells, p53 activation is not required for the two events. This study not only extends the observations of Dove et al. (2006) to another cell type, but also reveals that IBV For successful propagation, viruses may manipulate cell cycle progression to create a more conducive environment (Op De Beeck and Caillet-Fauquet, 1997; Schang, 2003; Swanton and Jones, 2001) . As cellular components fluctuate during the cell cycle, these manipulations may force the cell into a phase that is favorable for virus replication. In the case of DNA viruses, coordination with host cell DNA replication in the S phase may be required for efficient replication of the viral DNA genomes (Schang, 2003) . For example, EBV could block the host response and actively promote an S-phase-like environment for viral lytic replication (Kudoh et al., 2004 (Kudoh et al., , 2005 . S-phase-dependent enhancement of viral RNA replication was also reported for dengue virus 2 and hepatitis C virus (Helt and Harris, 2005; Scholle et al., 2004) . Cell cycle dependence for retrovirus replication may include arrest at the S phase and mitosis (Katz et al., 2005) . G 2 /M arrest is also a common strategy employed by viruses to optimize virion production. Cell cycle arrest at G 2 /M phase was observed to boost both early and late steps of HIV infection (Goh et al., 1998; Groschel and Bushman, 2005) . Coxsackievirus, however, replicates more slowly in cells arrested at G 2 /M, compared to cells arrested at either G 1 or the G 1 /S boundary (Feuer et al., 2002) . In this study, we demonstrated that IBV could manipulate cell cycle for the enhancement of viral replication. The G 2 /M arrest may result in a change in the cellular physiology that is more conducive to viral infection. It is also possible that a simple increase in cell surface area due to arrest would promote viral entry. Furthermore, protein synthesis is greater in the G 2 /M phase, which may have a knock-on effect on virus assembly and hence increase virus output.",

In cellular response to viral infection, p53 is generally activated to induce either cell cycle arrest or apoptosis. As a DNA damage response protein, p53 transcriptionally activates numerous genes involved in apoptosis, DNA repair and cell cycle arrest (Vogelstein et al., 2000) , and p53-dependent arrest of cells at G 1 /S or G 2 /M is an important component of the cellular response to genotoxic stress including virus infection. The first transcriptional target of p53 identified was p21, a CKI of the Cip/Kip family, which bridges the function of p53 with the cell cycle and plays important roles in regulation of cell cycle progression or arrest (el-Deiry et al., 1993; Harper et al., 1993) . Overexpression of p21 could inhibit two critical checkpoints in the cell cycle, namely G 1 and G 2 , through both p53-dependent and -independent pathways (Macleod et al., 1995) . The observation that IBV infection induces cell cycle arrest at S and G 2 /M phases in both H1299 and Vero cells virtually rules out the possible involvement of p53 in these processes.",

To support this conclusion, neither p53 overall expression level nor its post-translational modification state was affected upon IBV infection. Viral proteins from several DNA viruses, including the SV40 small t antigen (Gjoerup et al., 2001) , the Rep78 protein from adenoassociated virus type 2 (Schmidt et al., 2000) , adenovirus E4orf4 protein (Kleinberger, 2000) , HPV E6 (Fan et al., 2005) , papillomavirus E2 (Desaintes et al., 1999) and the chicken anemia virus protein apoptin (Teodoro et al., 2004) , were reported to induce p53-independent apoptosis. Induction of early apoptosis could limit viral production and spread of progeny virus to the neighboring cells, most viruses have therefore evolved strategies to disrupt early apoptosis to allow production of more progeny viruses. These include suppression of the IFN action in the case of human adenovirus and HPV (Barber, 2001) , inactivation of p53 and coding for antiapoptotic Bcl-2 homologs to prevent premature death of the infected cells to sustain virus replication (Benedict et al., 2002; Cuconati and White, 2002) . Some viruses or viral proteins, such as HTLV-1 Tax protein and HIV-1 Nef, inhibit apoptosis by modulating Bcl-2 family members at the transcriptional level or via post-translational modification (Benedict et al., 2002) . Poxviruses, myxoma virus, human CMV, and adenovirus can specifically target members of the TNF receptor (Benedict et al., 2002) .",

            "text": "Cross talk exists between cell cycle regulation and apoptosis (Gil-Gomez et al., 1998; King and Cidlowski, 1998) . Apoptosis is an end point of stalled cell cycle progression in most cases. But in other cases, progression through the cell cycle appears to be required for efficient induction of apoptosis (Santiago-Walker et al., 2005) . One characteristic feature of DNA damage-induced apoptosis, especially in the absence of wild-type p53, is the activation of a G 2 /M cell cycle checkpoint prior to cell death. However, G 2 /M cell cycle arrest is not always a prerequisite for subsequent apoptosis. Moreover, it was reported that apoptosis is frequently associated with the G 1 phase of the cell cycle (King and Cidlowski, 1998) and arrest at the late G 1 or S phase may accelerate or potentiate apoptosis (Meikrantz et al., 1994) . In addition, apoptosis is a consequence of the Sphase arrest imposed by IFN-\u03b2 in HPV-infected cervical carcinoma cell line ME-180 (Vannucchi et al., 2005) . In this study, apoptosis may mechanistically link to the cell cycle arrest induced by IBV infection, but it is unlikely that apoptosis is merely a direct consequence of the cell cycle arrest. It is possible that cell cycle arrest in IBV-infected cells would prevent the induction and execution of early cell death of the infected cells.",
