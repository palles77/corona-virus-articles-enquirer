We conducted a prospective cluster-randomized trial comparing surgical masks, non-fi ttested P2 masks, and no masks in prevention of infl uenzalike illness (ILI) in households. Mask use adherence was self-reported. During the 2006 and 2007 winter seasons, 286 exposed adults from 143 households who had been exposed to a child with clinical respiratory illness were recruited. We found that adherence to mask use signifi cantly reduced the risk for ILI-associated infection, but <50% of participants wore masks most of the time. We concluded that household use of face masks is associated with low adherence and is ineffective for controlling seasonal respiratory disease. However, during a severe pandemic when use of face masks might be greater, pandemic transmission in households could be reduced.",

Therefore, nonpharmaceutical interventions such as mask use, handwashing, and other hygiene measures or school closure might be effective early control strategies. In contrast to pharmaceutical interventions, little is known about the effectiveness of nonpharmaceutical interventions in the community. A recent analysis gives estimates of the effect of school closure (1) , and several prospective, randomized controlled trials of handwashing have been published (2) (3) (4) (5) (6) (7) (8) (9) (10) (11) . However, clinical trial data on the ability of face masks to reduce respiratory virus transmission in the community are limited to 1 published prospective trial, which showed lack of effi cacy (12) . In addition, adverse effects of wearing masks (particularly respirators) may affect compliance and effectiveness (13) (14) (15) . Despite the lack of quantitative evidence, many countries have included recommendations in their pandemic plans on the use of face masks (16) (17) (18) . We present the results of a cluster-randomized household study of the effectiveness of using face masks to prevent or reduce transmission of infl uenza-like illness (ILI).",

Enrollment in the study was restricted to households with >2 healthy adults >16 years of age; the adults had known exposure within the household to a child with fever and respiratory symptoms. Suitable households were identifi ed at a pediatric health service comprising the emergency department of a pediatric hospital and a pediatric primary care practice in Sydney, New South Wales, Australia. The study protocol was approved by the local institutional review board.",

According to New South Wales Health guidelines, pamphlets about infection control were provided to participants in all arms. Study participants and trial staff were not blinded, as it is not technically possible to blind the mask type to which participants were randomized. However, laboratory staff were blinded to the arm of randomization. Figure 1 shows the fl ow diagram for the trial as suggested by CONSORT guidelines (20) .",

            "text": "We estimated that, irrespective of the assumed value for the incubation period (1 or 2 days), the relative reduction in the daily risk of acquiring a respiratory infection associated with adherent mask use (P2 or surgical) was in the range of 60%-80%. Those results are consistent with those of a simpler analysis in which persons were stratifi ed according to adherence (online Technical Appendix, available from www.cdc.gov/EID/content/15/2/233-Techapp. pdf). We emphasize that this level of risk reduction is dependent on the context, namely, adults in the household caring for a sick child after exposure to a single index case. We urge caution in extrapolating our results to school, workplace, or community contexts, or where multiple, repeated exposures may occur, such as in healthcare settings. The exact mechanism of potential clinical effectiveness of face mask use may be the prevention of inhalation of respiratory pathogens but may also be a reduction in handto-face contact. Our study could not determine the relative contributions of these mechanisms. In our study, fi t testing for P2 masks was not conducted because this is unlikely to be feasible in the general community during a pandemic. As such, we felt it was more appropriate to determine the effi cacy of non-fi t-tested masks. We found no difference in adherence between P2 and surgical masks, an important fi nding, as there is a common belief among healthcare workers that P2 masks are less comfortable. The size of the study did not permit conclusive comparison of the relative effi cacy of P2 masks and surgical masks. Given the 5-to 10-fold cost difference between the 2 mask types, quantifying any difference in effi cacy between surgical masks and particulate respirators remains a priority that needs to be addressed by a larger trial.",

However, this effect would have biased the results toward the null in the intention-to-treat analysis. The survival analysis explicitly accounted for the existence of a fi xed incubation period and incubating infections at the time of enrollment. A potential alternative study design would be to enroll participants from asymptomatic households, do follow-up for development of infection, and then immediately intervene with masks. For such a design, given that only 15%-20% of closely exposed adults will develop illness after exposure to an ill child, thousands of households (rather than hundreds) would be required to afford the same study power. In addition, such a design would have been fraught with underascertainment of incident infections and delayed implementation of mask intervention. We believe ours is a more effi cient design. A further limitation is that some parents may have acquired infection outside the home. We identifi ed 5 child-parent pairs with discordant viral infections. The randomization process should have ensured that outside exposure was equally distributed between arms, and this effect would have biased the results toward the null.",

ILI in enrolled adults was 17.1%, but laboratory confi rmation was modest; the virus was identifi ed in only 34.7% of adult ILI cases (the rate of laboratory diagnosis in children was high at 63.8%). However, even intention-totreat analysis using ILI outcome shows no signifi cant difference between the groups. We used self-reporting to determine adherence; previous research indicates that patient self-reporting is more reliable than judgments by doctors or nurses when compared against urine drug levels (30). In addition, the signifi cant association between adherence and clinical protection provides internal validation of selfreporting as a measure.",

            "text": "An important aspect of this study is that we included respiratory viruses other than infl uenza. Although these viruses may differ in their relative dependence (accurate quantitation of this relativity is uncertain for the various viruses) on different transmission mechanisms (i.e., large droplet, aerosol, or fomite), all are transmitted by the respiratory route. Therefore, face mask use should have some effect on virus transmission (e.g., interference with handnose contact), given that participants in all arms of the study received the same infection control advice. In addition, we argue that assessing multiple respiratory viruses allows our results to be generalized more broadly to other infections, including new respiratory viruses that may emerge in the future. Conversely, the low rate of confi rmed infl uenza A or B infection (18.4%) in the study could mean that our fi ndings are not directly applicable to a scenario in which infl uenza predominates. If infl uenza is more likely than the other viruses in our study to be transmitted by the respiratory route, the prevalence of mixed infections would tend to bias our results toward the null. However, it is possible that a pandemic strain may have different transmission characteristics than seasonal strains as demonstrated by attack rates in different age groups in pandemics compared with seasonal outbreaks and by the detection of infl uenza virus in different clinical samples in human infl uenza virus A (H5N1) cases. Results of our study have global relevance to respiratory disease control planning, especially with regard to home care. During an infl uenza pandemic, supplies of antiviral drugs may be limited, and there will be unavoidable delays in the production of a matched pandemic vaccine (31) . For new or emerging respiratory virus infections, no pharmaceutical interventions may be available. Even with seasonal infl uenza, widespread oseltamivir resistance in infl uenza virus A (H1N1) strains have recently been reported (32) . Masks may therefore play an important role in reducing transmission.",
