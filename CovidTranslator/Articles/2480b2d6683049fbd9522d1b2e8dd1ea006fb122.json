The differences in clinical data and outcome between single and multiple viral infections in hospitalized children were analyzed. Methods: We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of hospitalized children who had fever and a xTAG Respiratory Virus Panel (RVP) test over a 2-year period. The clinical data were analyzed and compared between single and multiple viral infections. Viral etiologies in upper and lower respiratory infections were analyzed and compared. Results: A total of 442 patients were enrolled. Patients with positive viral detection (N Z 311) had a significantly lower rate of leukocytosis (p Z 0.03), less evidence of bacterial infection (p Z 0.004), and shorter duration of hospitalization (p Z 0.019) than those with negative viral detection. The age of patients with multiple viral infections was younger than those with single viral infection; however, there were no significant differences in duration of fever, antibiotics treatment and hospitalization between these two groups.",

Conclusion: Multiple viral infections were associated with younger age and a higher risk of developing LRTI. However, multiple viral infections did not predict a worse disease outcome. More studies are needed to unveil the interplay between the hosts and different viruses in multiple viral infections.",

            "text": "Acute respiratory tract infection (ARTI) is a leading cause of fever and hospitalization in children worldwide. 1 Upper respiratory tract infection (URTI) is the most frequent human illness and the most common disease in childhood; on average, infants and preschoolers develop six to eight URTIs per year. 2 URTIs can cause non-severe but widespread epidemics that are responsible for the continuous circulation of pathogens in the community. Moreover, lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) may also develop severe disease and is the leading infectious cause of death in children younger than five years of age. 3 For both URTI and LRTI, viral infection is the primary cause, especially in children. Clinically, the febrile presentation could lead to the use of more diagnostic tools and antibiotics. Therefore, accurate and timely identification of the responsible viral pathogen could reduce unnecessary use of antibiotics and length of hospital stay. 4 Multiple viral infections are more commonly seen in pediatric patients than in adults. 5 Multiple viral infections were reported to be associated with increased hospital admissions, intensive care unit admissions, lengthened duration of hospitalization, and prolonged mechanical ventilation use. 6e8 However, some studies indicated that disease severity, management, and outcome were not associated with multiple viral infections. 9e12 Interestingly, a study published by Martin et al. revealed that illnesses with multiple virus detections were correlated with disease of less severity. 13 Hence, whether multiple viral infections correlate with disease severity remains unclear.",

RVPs were performed to investigate the possible viral etiology.

If one of the quick antigen tests came back positive, further RVP test may not be conducted. The clinical characteristics, laboratory data, comorbidities (congenital heart disease, chronic respiratory disease, chronic neurological disease, prematurity, malignancy), clinical diagnosis, duration of antibiotics use, ICU admission and duration hospitalization of the patients were recorded. Patients were divided into three age groups ( 2 years old; > 2 and 5 years old; >5 years old). For further comparison of the differences between patients with URTI and LRTI, acute rhinitis, pharyngitis, laryngitis, tonsillitis, otitis media (AOM), acute sinusitis and croup were categorized as URTI whilst LRTI included acute bronchiolitis, bronchitis, and pneumonia. Patients with positive results of Mycoplasma pneumoniae serum IgM, urinary pneumococcal antigen, or bacterial culture results from blood, urine, or sputum were recorded as evidence of bacterial infection.

Nevertheless, there was no difference in duration of fever and the clinical outcome, including duration of antibiotics treatment and hospital stay, between these two groups of patients. These findings are consistent with recent systematic reviews and meta-analyses which have concluded that there was no significant difference between children with single and multiple respiratory viral infections concerning the clinical disease severity, the length of hospital stay, admission to the intensive care unit, need for mechanical ventilation, oxygen requirements, and death. 11, 16, 17 By contrast, some studies showed that multiple viral infections increased the risk of ICU admission. 18 Of note, the simultaneous detection of multiple viruses does not necessarily implicate the pathogenic effect at the time of detection, especially when molecular methods are used. It is also difficult to distinguish between active viral infection, viral shedding, and potentially non-pathogenic viral infection. For instance, HBoV and HAdV may have prolonged viral shedding. 11 The detection of two viruses may represent an episode of acute infection in the presence of other viral persistence from a recent infection. 19 Moreover, the mechanisms of disease virulence and viraleviral interaction in multiple infections are not clearly understood. They may result from direct interactions of viral genes or indirect interactions resulting from alterations in the host-environment or immunological interactions. 20 Different pathogenic mechanisms may be triggered by different viruses, which may potentiate or inhibit the effects on each other. For instance, RSV or influenza coinfection with other viruses may associate with a worse outcome. 7,21 Furthermore, some studies indicated a high viral load is related to higher disease severity in respiratory infections 22 ; however, conflicting results have been reported. 23 Therefore, further studies are needed to determine whether multiple viral infections contribute to disease severity.",

Previous studies have shown slightly different rankings of common respiratory pathogens; nevertheless, HRV has consistently been the most common cause in all age groups. 24 Similar to results of previous studies, RSV and PIV are the most common cause of lower respiratory tract infections in infants and young children. 25, 26 HAdV is accountable for around 10 percent of ARTI in children in the previous study 5 and it was 9% in our study. This was underestimated because patients with a positive quick adenovirus antigen test without proceeding to have xTAG RVP testing were not included in our analysis. Six percent (19/311) of children were reported positive for HCoV, of which 2.5% were positive for OC43 (8/311), 2.2% for NL63 (7/311), 0.6% for 229E (2/311), and 0.6% for HKU1 (2/311). These are similar to previous results. 27 In this study, 27% of children had multiple viral infections. The result is similar to the previous studies that detection of multiple viruses simultaneously in pediatric patients ranges from 10 to 30%. 28 Similar to previous findings, the three most commonly detected viruses in multiple viral infections were HRV, RSV, and PIV in this study. 10, 29 Furthermore, higher percentages of HBoV (79%), HAdV (62%), and HRV (49%) infection were present in children with multiple viral infections. Previous studies showed that around 33%e75% of HBoV was detected in children who had co-infection with other viruses. 30, 31 According to the previous study by Lee et al., multiple respiratory viral infections with HAdV were reported in 30.5% of children. 32 HRV was the most common co-infecting virus which occurring in 69.6% of multiple viral infections. 33 In addition, the most common combinations of multiple viral infections were HRV \u00fe RSV and HRV \u00fe HAdV and triple/quadruple viral infections accounted for a certain proportion similar to the results of previous studies. 11,33e35 HBoV infections occurred mostly in children less than 2 years of age with a mean age of 0.88 AE 0.09 years. The previous study indicated that HBoV circulates in the community and is acquired early in life. 36 The clinical picture of adenovirus infection was characterized by high grade and prolonged fever. Laboratory findings of HAdV infections include elevated CRP, leukocytosis, and neutrophilia. 37 In our study, HAdV had significantly longer fever duration (5.60 AE 0.54 days) and elevated CRP level (3.53 AE 4.51 mg/ dl).",
