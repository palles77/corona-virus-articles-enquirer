Between 17 March and 7 July 2003, as a result of dilemmas in balancing sensitivity and specificity, five different case definitions were used. The patients referred for SARS assessment were analysed from a public health perspective. None of the patients referred had SARS, based on serological and virological criteria. Nevertheless, all 72 patients required thorough assessment and, depending on the results of the assessment, institution of appropriate prevention and control measures. Changing case definitions caused confusion in classifying cases. A centralised assessment of the reported cases by a team with clinical and public health expertise (epidemiological and geographical risk assessment) is a practical solution for addressing differences in applying case definitions. The burden of managing non-cases is an important issue when allocating public health resources, and should be taken into account during the preparation phase, rather than during an outbreak. This applies not only to SARS, but also to other public health threats, such as pandemic influenza or a bioterrorist episode.",

The sense of urgency increased with evidence that the disease could spread easily and that the clinical course could be severe [1] [2] [3] [4] . Following the WHO global alert on 12 March 2003 and the WHO travel advisory notice on 15 March 2003, countries worldwide started reporting cases [5, 6] . In May 2003, the WHO revised the case definitions of SARS [7] , based on knowledge of the disease available at that time. Early studies in 2003 showed a low sensitivity (26%) when using the WHO criteria for clinical assessment of patients before admission to a SARS clinic in a region with extensive local transmission [8] . A comparable low sensitivity (27%) and a much lower positive predictive value were found when screening patients before admission to a general hospital in Singapore [9] . In the designated screening centre for evaluation of possible SARS cases in Singapore, the WHO case definitions were found to be helpful at initial assessment, despite an under-triage of 0.3% [10] . To address the low sensitivity of the WHO criteria, researchers from Hong Kong developed a clinical prediction rule for the emergency department [11] .",

Their benefits and limita-tions in practice depend on their purpose, the context in which they are used, and the skills of the user. When formulating a case definition, balancing sensitivity and specificity is crucial [13] . The initial emergence and spread of SARS in the absence of specific diagnostic tests required that physicians and public health authorities worldwide formulate a set of criteria for separating suspected or probable cases from non-cases. This report describes the background, and the choices made with respect to classification and management, of patients referred for SARS assessment in The Netherlands. The consequences of the use of different case definitions for the reporting behaviour, patient management and evaluation of public health interventions are highlighted. None of the cases met the criteria for reporting to the WHO according to the case definitions in force at the time in The Netherlands. All cases were reevaluated on the basis of the latest case definition from the WHO (1 May 2003) [7] , and differences with important public health consequences were revealed. (Table 1) , for surveillance purposes and comprehensive clinical assessment, required obligatory radiographical evidence of lung infiltrates consistent with pneumonia, and well-defined epidemiological criteria for exposure (i.e., close contact with an individual with severe respiratory disease in the affected areas during the previous 10 days). This more specific case definition was issued to avoid considering SARS in the differential diagnosis of the expected large number of patients with acute respiratory infections at a time when the incidence of mild (common) respiratory disease in travellers was high and the influenza season was ongoing. General practitioners and clinicians were asked to report suspect cases on a voluntary basis to the Dutch Public Health Services. On 1 April 2003, mandatory SARS notification was introduced. The Public Health Services were asked to consult the National Co-ordination Centre for Outbreak Management (LCI) for an assessment of SARS probability. In the following weeks, four subsequent case definitions followed in which, gradually, sensitivity increased (Table 1) at the expense of specificity. The criteria for case definitions and notification were evaluated on each occasion by members of the Outbreak Management Team, who were responsible for issuing scientific advice. Major factors in balancing sensitivity and specificity were the severity of the clinical course, the frequency of local transmission in affected areas, and the level of contact with potentially infected individuals. On 10 June 2003, the WHO case definition for a suspect case (revised on 1 May 2003) was also adopted in The Netherlands for reporting patients for SARS assessment.",

The second source was the dataset from the SARS reference laboratory in The Netherlands (Department of Virology, Erasmus MC Rotterdam), to which clinical specimens were sent. These cases were referred for SARS assessment on the basis of their clinical status, travel-associated risk and \u2044 or contact with suspect \u2044 probable SARS cases. The referral by the clinician \u2044 public physician was compared retrospectively with the assessment on the basis of the Dutch case definition at the time of submission, and with a reassessment on the basis of the WHO case definition issued on 1 May 2003. The risk ratio (RR) for being a suspect case was calculated by comparing the referral of the case by the clinician with the first assessment (RR1), the referral with the reassessment based on the WHO definition (1 May 2003) (RR2), and the first assessment with the reassessment (RR3). The data sources were compared using a capture-recapture method [14] . The same classification of cases was used for both data sources.

During the worldwide SARS epidemic in 2003, five case definitions were subsequently used in The Netherlands. The latest, used from 10 June onwards, was identical to that issued by the WHO on 1 May 2003. The three major criteria for SARS (i.e., respiratory disease, fever and travel-associated risk) were met in 25 (34%) cases. Of these, two patients had spent just a few hours in an airport in an affected area, and another two patients became ill outside the incubation period. Using the most sensitive case definition (WHO, 1 May 2003), 21 cases would have been considered as suspect, and two (2.8%) patients would have qualified as probable cases. These cases were not reported to the WHO because, at the time of their assessment, they did not meet the criteria for probable cases according to the prevailing Dutch case definition.",

In the UK, over 400 cases were referred for assessment, among which four probable cases were identified [21] . In France, 437 cases were notified, with seven being classified as probable cases, among which four were later confirmed as being infected with SARS-CoV [22] . The Netherlands was not a country affected by SARS, and there was no local transmission. SARS was ruled out on the basis of the criteria in force at that time. As soon as SARS-specific diagnostic tests became available, they were used on samples from 37 patients. Acute sera taken early in the course of the infection can result in false-negative serological results unless convalescent sera are also analysed at a later date. Negative serology was not the only criterion for ruling out SARS; discharge from observation took place only when the clinical course improved and \u2044 or an alternative diagnosis could fully explain the illness.",

The severity of the disease (pneumonia or respiratory distress syndrome) is an important criterion for including patients in the suspect group, and for referring them for further assessment in countries considered to be at low risk according to the WHO classification [23] . To increase the assessment specificity, the inclusion of significant travel exposure (i.e., contact with a person suffering from respiratory disease in areas with local transmission) or hospital exposure (i.e., the patient has been hospitalised or has been working in a risk area for SARS) should be obligatory when considering SARS in patients returning from abroad.

Continuous vigilance by healthcare professionals and public services will provide the basis for identifying possible cases. From a public health point of view, in order to prevent the medical services from becoming overwhelmed, a first-line filter is needed to separate suspect cases from notsuspect cases before referring patients for further assessment. The first-line filter will be based on broad clinical and epidemiological criteria (e.g., history of contact and travel exposure) and will be refined gradually as knowledge concerning this disease becomes available.",

This expert team, with both the necessary experience and the authority to confirm the suspicion, should be available at all times. Centralised assessment is appropriate as long as there are only imported cases, or local transmission remains at a low level. This approach might have limitations for countries in which a delay in isolating patients could occur because of large distances between hospitals. This is undesirable because shortening the period between the onset of symptoms and isolation, and proper management of contacts, have proven to be effective in containing SARS. The risk of secondary transmission has been shown to decrease significantly when cases are isolated within 3 days of the onset of symptoms [26, 27] . Telephone or online consultation with the expert team is a useful option.",

The extent of transmission of influenza by sub-clinical cases during a pandemic is difficult to predict, and in such a situation, timely preparedness and proper allocation of resources to manage both suspect cases and non-cases, and their contacts, are important. The danger of over-reporting cases should be taken into account when estimating and planning epidemic control resources before an outbreak occurs.
