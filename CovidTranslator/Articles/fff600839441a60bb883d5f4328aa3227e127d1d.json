            "text": "The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of a porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) infection on the development of the immune response after pseudorabies virus (PRV) vaccination in pigs. Pigs were intranasally inoculated with the European PRRSV strain, Lelystad virus ter Huurne, and were vaccinated intramuscularly with PRV 2 weeks later (LV-PRV group). Control pigs were vaccinated with PRV only (PRV group). Eight weeks after PRV vaccination, pigs from both groups were challenged intranasally with wild-type PRV. We measured the lymphoproliferative, and the cytolytic responses to PRV of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC), isolated from blood samples. In addition, serum samples were examined for antibodies against PRV and LV. One week after PRV vaccination, PBMC proliferated abundantly to PRV in both groups. However, in the LV-PRV group the lymphoproliferative response declined after 1 week, whereas, in the PRV group, the lymphoproliferative response was high for 3 weeks and declined thereafter (P<0.05). After challenge, the lymphoproliferative response was 1 week earlier and was consistently and signi\u00aecantly higher in the PRV group than in the LV-PRV group. The PRV-speci\u00aec killing was higher at 3 weeks after PRV vaccination and 5 weeks after PRV challenge 19AE3 and 24AE6%, respectively, in the PRV group, compared to 7AE4 and 6AE9%, respectively, in the LV-PRV group (P<0.05). However, later after vaccination and challenge the cytolytic response was identical in both groups. The antibody titre against PRV developed equally in both groups. After challenge, no PRV virus was isolated from both groups. From these results we conclude that, although PRRSV infection did cause changes in the time course of the T-lymphocyte response after PRV vaccination, PRRSV infection did not inhibit the development of vaccine-induced protection after PRV. #",

The lymphoproliferative response tended to be quicker (not signi\u00aecantly) and longer (2 weeks) (P<0.05) in the PRV group than in the LV-PRV group after PRV vaccination. This lymphoproliferative response was also quicker (1 week) and consistently higher in the PRV group than in the LV-PRV group after PRV challenge (P<0.05). Furthermore, when we used in vitro PRV-stimulated PBMC, the cytolytic response against PRV reached a maximum in week 3 after PRV vaccination and week 5 after PRV challenge in the PRVgroup, whereas the LV-PRV group did not (P<0.05). Later after vaccination and challenge, the cytolytic response was comparable in both groups. The same kinetics of the cytolytic response against PRV vaccination with M141 was described in an other study (De Bruin et al., 1998) , which indicates that the LV-PRV group in this study did not reach a maximum level in the cytolytic response, whereas the PRV group did. When PBMC were used directly, we also observed a signi\u00aecantly higher cytolytic response against PRV on day 10 after PRV vaccination in the PRV group than in the LV-PRV group (P<0.05). These results indicate a mild immunosuppressive effect by the PRRSV infection on the development of a cellular immune response after PRV vaccination and challenge. An explanation for this lower T-lymphocyte response may be that PRRSV infects monocytes and macrophages, which may hamper ef\u00aecient antigen-presentation and thereby suppressing the ability of PBMC to proliferate.",

(1992) , who also observed an enhanced humoral response after challenge with PRV, after an earlier PRRSV infection. It is possible that PRRSV infection stimulates the humoral response. However, an explanation for this discrepancy is that we used a very potent vaccine strain, inducing protection and no increase of antibody-titres (Kimman et al., 1992 (Kimman et al., , 1994 De Bruin et al., 1998) . We could not detect differences in protection against a PRV challenge between both groups, but a negative effect of a PRRSV infection on protection after PRV vaccination can not be excluded when less potent vaccine strains are used. However, the M141 vaccine strain was used, because this strain induced a high cellular immune response (De Bruin et al., 1998) and eventually negative effects of a PRRSV infection on the development of the cellular immune response could be measured very well.",

Although we measured fever after LV inoculation and PRV vaccination, we could not detect clinical signs of Aujeszky's disease after vaccination with M141 (a PRV mutant strain that causes mild clinical signs (Kimman et al., 1994; De Bruin et al., 1998) ).

The open arrow indicates inoculation with PRRSV. Closed arrows indicate PRV vaccination and challenge. Signi\u00aecant differences are indicated with an asterisk (P<0.05).",
