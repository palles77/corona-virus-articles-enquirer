It is believed to have originated from Guangdong in Southern China [2] and eventually affected about two dozen countries worldwide. The World Health Organisation (WHO) has estimated that more than eight thousand people have been affected by this illness and 774 people have died. In Singapore 32 out of the 206 patients who contracted SARS died. Almost a quarter, 48 patients, were critically-ill. Five developed large artery cerebral thrombosis. Stroke occurring in the context of viral infections is exceedingly rare. Here we report the clinical features and explore various patho-physiological mechanisms that could have contributed to cerebral thrombosis in these patients.",

Two out of the seven patients managed in the other hospitals needed intensive care. Neurological complications in all SARS patients were tracked prospectively and reviewed by the first author. Table 1 summarises the salient features of the five patients with stroke. These were all patients managed at TTSH. \u25a0 Abstract Of the 206 patients who contracted Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) in Singapore five developed large artery cerebral infarctions. Four patients were critically-ill and three died. Intravenous immunoglobulin was given to three patients. An increased incidence of deep venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism was also observed among the critically-ill patients. We believe our experience warrants an increased vigilance against stroke and other thrombotic complications among critically-ill SARS patients in future outbreaks, especially if treatment such as intravenous immunoglobulin, that increases pro-thrombotic tendency, is contemplated.",

Three weeks into her hospitalization paralytic and sedative drugs were withdrawn. She did not regain consciousness. The pupillary, oculocephalic and plantar reflexes were normal.

Significant hypotension was present just before the onset of stroke in four patients (Table 1) . Embolism from proximal sites, including the heart and severe hypotension in the context of sepsis could have resulted in the strokes. The apparent association between SARS and stroke therefore might be coincidental. However, about a third of criticallyill SARS patients managed at TTSH also had venous thromboembolism (including pulmonary embolism) in spite of treatment with LMWH at doses to achieve anti-Xa levels of 0.5-1.0 IU/ml (Yim CF et al., manuscript in preparation), [4] . In randomised studies of critically-ill patients, heparin has been reported to reduce the incidence of venous thromboembolism from about 30 % to 15 % [5, 6] . Four out of the eight SARS cases that underwent post-mortem examination in Singapore (this series includes case 5) had evidence of pulmonary thromboemboli [7] . A possible increase in AMI had also been observed in the Singapore cohort of SARS patients (Lim IH, personal communication). Furthermore, the four stroke patients who were critically-ill were not significantly older (56 \u00b1 13 years) than all critically-ill SARS patients at TTSH (50 \u00b1 16 years, Anova p = 0.45).",

Another study found four strokes among 520 patient-days of infusion over four years [10] . However, no strokes have been reported in more than 700 patients participating in controlled trials using IVIg [8] . It is believed that IVIg-induced increase in viscosity may be inconsequential except in patients with hypercoagulable states [8] . The safety of IVIg and the role of anti-Xa monitored doses of LMWH in criti-cally-ill SARS patients should therefore be studied in future outbreaks.",

Even in a common illness such as chicken pox, cerebral thrombosis, typically of large vessels, is estimated to occur in only one out of 6500 infections [11] . The co-morbidity in our patients might have contributed to the relatively high incidence of about one stroke in 42 SARS infections.",

Stroke and arteritis have also been documented in animal viral infections. This may be pertinent as the SARS coronavirus is widely believed to have evolved from a yet unidentified animal virus [16] . Examples of stroke in animal viral infections include malignant catarrhal fever (herpes virus), Aleutian disease (parvovirus) and border disease (pestivirus) [17] . The equine arteritis virus, an arterivirus belonging to the same order as coronaviruses, causes lymphocytic infiltration, necrosis of smooth muscle and occlusion of vessel wall. Electronmicrographs show virions within endothelial cells [18] . However, we have not been able to demonstrate SARS virions within endothelial cells or causing primary endothelial injury (data not shown). We also did not perform transcranial Doppler examinations to identify vaso-spasm, because the highly infectious nature of SARS and the increased incidence of nosocomial transmission among health care workers restricted investigations to only those that could have a direct impact on the patients' management.",
