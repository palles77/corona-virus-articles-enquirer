            "text": "In this article, we demonstrate a statistical method for fitting the parameters of a sophisticated network and epidemic model to disease data. The pattern of contacts between hosts is described by a class of dyadic independence Exponential-family Random Graph Models (ERGMs) while the transmission process that runs over the network is modeled as a stochastic Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Removed (SEIR) epidemic. We fit these models to very detailed data from the 1861 measles outbreak in Hagelloch, Germany. The network models include parameters for all recorded host covariates including age, sex, household and classroom membership and household location while the SEIR epidemic model has exponentially distributed transmission times with gamma distributed latent and infective periods. This approach allows us to make meaningful statements about the structure of the population-separate from the transmission process-as well as to provide estimates of various biological quantities of interest, such as the effective reproductive number, R. Using reversible jump Markov chain Monte Carlo, we produce samples from the joint posterior distribution of all the parameters of this model-the network, transmission tree, network parameters and SEIR parameters-and perform Bayesian model selection to find the best-fitting network model. We compare our results with those of previous analyses and show that the ERGM network model better fits the data than a Bernoulli network model previously used. We also provide a software package, written in R, that performs this type of analysis. (2008) and Groendyke et al. (2011) to deal with host covariate information. This means that known discrete or continuous properties of hosts, such as age, household, other group memberships and spatial distribution can be incorporated into an analysis and the relative importance to the spread of the disease of each of these properties quantified. Further, we show that a Bayesian model selection algorithm can be used to find the subset of covariates that best explains the contact structure within the population. Thus, for the first time, an explicit network model of plausible complexity can be estimated from disease data allowing us to more fully understand the mechanisms at play in the spread of epidemics through populations, and potentially offer better means of testing alternate strategies for containing these epidemics.",

Estimating the parameters of these network models from data, however, remains a serious challenge. The focus of this paper is on fitting a plausible network model to real data to demonstrate that rigorous statistical methods can feasibly be used with this class of models. The data we fit here-from a measles outbreak in Germany in 1861-were very well documented (Pfeilsticker, 1863) and thus provide an ideal testing ground for new methods.",

            "text": "There have been several previous analyses of this data set, with differing goals and utilizing various methods. Our analysis differs from most previous works in that we assume that the epidemic spreads across the edges of a contact network. Contacts here are assumed to be substantial enough to have a reasonable chance of transmitting the pathogen. We use the data to infer the properties of this contact network. These properties -the factors that influence the propensity of individuals to make infectious contacts with one another -are very important in the study of epidemiology, as the network structure is known to have a significant impact on both the spread of an epidemic (Meyers et al., 2005; Keeling and Eames, 2005; Read and Keeling, 2003; Wallinga et al., 1999; Anderson and May, 1991, Ch. 11-12) , as well as on the methods of containing the spread of these epidemics (Keeling et al., 2002; Ball et al., 1997; Becker and Utev, 1998; Hall and Becker, 2009) . As argued in Welch et al. (2011) , there is a lack of rigorous statistical work that fits network models to data; the present paper seeks to address that lack. class, household, age, gender, dates of symptom onset, and various other items. Oesterle (1992) later augmented these data by mapping the spatial coordinates of each affected household and also inferred, for each infected individual, the person who was the putative source of infection. 188 children aged fifteen and younger were susceptible to measles during the time of this epidemic and each of these individuals was indeed infected over the course of this outbreak. Part of this data set is displayed in Web Figure 1 . See Section 2 and Lawson and Leimich (2000) or Neal and Roberts (2004) for more detailed descriptions of this data set and population. Lawson and Leimich (2000) analyze these data using a proportional hazards model. They are interested in the spatial and temporal effects of transmission (and their interaction), and thus consider a spatio-temporal model. The authors use their model to estimate a parameter that measures the \"spatial scale of spread\" and find a weak spatio-temporal interaction in the data. Neal and Roberts (2004) analyze the Hagelloch measles data by using a stochastic epidemic model that describes the transmission rate between two individuals (one infectious and one susceptible) as a function of the individuals' covariates. In particular they consider the effect of belonging to the same household, attending the same school class, and the physical distance between the houses of the individuals. They seek to discover which factors are the most important in describing the transmission rate and use a reversible jump MCMC algorithm to choose among various models. Ultimately, they find that their full model (i.e., the model incorporating all of the effects mentioned above) best fits the data, and that there is very strong evidence that the classroom for younger children (6 -10 years old) played a strong role in enabling the spread of the epidemic. Britton et al. (2011) analyze these data by introducing a three-level mixing model (a generalization of the two-level mixing model of Ball et al. (1997) ) and an SEIR epidemic model. Their model assumes a three-level structure, with each (susceptible) individual belonging to a household, a group (school class in this case), and to the community as a whole. In their model, an individual may transmit the disease to any individual within their household, group, or community; the corresponding frequencies of infectious contact for each type of transmission are modeled by independent Poisson processes with varying rates. The authors produce estimates for the transmission rates in their model, and also derive estimates of a threshold parameter (defined in Ball et al. (1997) ) for this epidemic. They compare the log-likelihood of their model to those of two different two-level mixing models (one which eliminates household-level mixing and another that eliminates group-level mixing) and conclude that the three-level mixing model offers a substantially better fit to the data and that both the group and household effects were important in the spread of this disease. Groendyke et al. (2011) analyze these data by using a stochastic SEIR epidemic model to model the progression of the disease and an Erd\u0151s-R\u00e9nyi random graph model (Gilbert, 1959; Erd\u0151s and R\u00e9nyi, 1959) to describe the contact network in the population. While the authors were successful in estimating the parameters for their models, the Erd\u0151s-R\u00e9nyi model is likely an overly simple representation of the true interaction structure since it does not allow for the incorporation of the various factors that Neal and Roberts (2004) and Britton et al. (2011) found to be material in the transmission of this disease.",

These include effects for household, classroom and gender homophily. Since preliminary analysis showed that the effects of being in the same classroom were likely to be different for classroom 1 than for classroom 2, we compute a separate statistic for each classroom. Similarly, we allow the gender homophily effect to vary according to whether the dyad consists of two males or two females. Two other dyadic statistics we consider are continuous in nature: absolute age difference between individuals (measured in units of 4 years) and the spatial distance (measured in units of 100 m) between the individuals' households. Finally, we also include a statistic whose value is 1 for every dyad, in order to measure the overall propensity of edge formation. This statistic is the analogue of the intercept term in a regression analysis. If we take X to consist of only the covariate whose value is 1 for every dyad, the resulting model is the Erd\u0151s-R\u00e9nyi model. Interaction terms could easily be included in this model framework by introducing covariates for each subgroup. For example, for a classroom/ gender interaction, we would include binary covariates for male/classroom 1, female/ classroom 1 and so on. Due to the sparsity of the data here, we do not consider interactions.",

Following Lawson and Leimich (2000) (also see Atkinson et al.

This is plausible considering the extremely contagious nature of measles. There is also a noticeable gender homophily effect, and furthermore, this effect appears to vary by gender, with females showing a stronger tendency to contact each other than males. There is also some evidence of an age effect; the posterior distribution for this coefficient falls largely below zero, indicating that increasing age differences result in decreasing odds of contact.

There are a couple of parameters, however, that deserve further discussion. Recall that the Age Difference parameter corresponds to a statistic measuring the absolute value of the age difference between two children. The marginal posterior distribution for this parameter is largely negative, suggesting that children who are closer in age will tend to be more likely to be in contact than those with larger age differences. Compared to many of the other parameters, though, the effect of this parameter appears to be rather weak. This is likely due to the inclusion of the two Classroom effects in the model. As each classroom consists of children who are close in age, we might expect that much of the effect of age similarity would be captured in the Classroom effects. Indeed, when we leave the Age Difference parameter out of the model, the estimates for both of the Classroom parameters increase accordingly. Nonetheless, the fact that the majority of the marginal posterior distribution for this parameter is negative indicates that there may be some effect due to age difference beyond that which can be explained by the Classroom effects.",

The corresponding degree distributions of these networks are shown in Figure 3 .

This problem was discussed in Britton and O'Neill (2002) and explored in Groendyke et al. (2011) . One method of assessing the severity of this problem is to examine the correlations in the joint posterior distribution; as in Groendyke et al. (2011) , we consider the correlation between log (p ij ) and log(\u03b2). For the Erd\u0151s-R\u00e9nyi model, in which, for all i, j, p ij = p, the correlation between log (p ij ) and log(\u03b2) is approximately \u22120.79, whereas for model 4, the posterior correlations between log (p ij ) and log(\u03b2) vary by dyad, but all fall between \u22120.31 and 0.05. In addition, Web Figure 2 shows the estimated posterior density for the parameter \u03b2 for both the Erd\u0151s-R\u00e9nyi model and model 4; clearly, the latter model yields a stronger signal for \u03b2, whereas in the Erd\u0151s-R\u00e9nyi model, the posterior distribution of \u03b2 is substantially influenced by the shape of its prior. Groendyke et al. (2011) similarly found that when using an Erd\u0151s-R\u00e9nyi model to analyze this data, the posterior distribution of \u03b2 was heavily influenced by its prior (a gamma distribution).",

It is drawn in a style to display both temporal information (when individuals became exposed, infectious, etc.) and topological information (who infected whom). Inspection of the tree can be highly informative about the behavior of the epidemic.

The tree shows this host causing 16 secondary infections, more than any other in the outbreak. Yet the posterior distribution of secondary infections caused by Host 176, shown in Web Figure 3 , indicates that there is little signal in the data for how many infections were caused by this host, with estimates ranging from 4 to 34. Oesterle (1992) , who empirically assigned secondary infections to individual hosts, assigned none to host 176.

Here, we are working with a mixed population of immune adults and susceptible children so consider the effective reproduction number, R, which is the actual number of secondary cases per primary case (Wallinga and Teunis, 2004 ) and provides a lower bound for R 0 . R is largest at the beginning of the epidemic when depletion of susceptible individuals has had little impact. We use techniques for finding a mean estimate of R at the beginning of the epidemic by using methods for estimating R 0 in situations where a stochastic epidemic is assumed to spread over edges of a contact network that includes only susceptible individuals. Britton and O'Neill (2002) gives such a formula for a type of SIR epidemic and Erd\u0151s-R\u00e9nyi network model; Groendyke et al. (2011) slightly modify this formula for use with an SEIR epidemic model. While these formulas consider the mean degree of the contact network, they fail to take into account the shape of the degree distribution. Meyers (2007) describes an approach for calculating R 0 which depends on the first two moments of the degree distribution; Kenah (2011) discusses a similar formulation, originally proposed by Andersson (1998) , incorporating the distribution of the length of time spent by individuals in the infectious state in order to produce a formula for R 0 . Using this general framework, we can find an expression for the mean of R at the beginning of the outbreak corresponding to the network and epidemic models used here: (2) where D is the random variable describing the degree distribution for the individuals in the population. Using Equation (2) in conjunction with the joint posterior samples generated using our MCMC algorithm, we can approximate the posterior distribution of R. Doing so yields 95% posterior credible intervals of (6.2, 9.8) for the 18 .9) for model 4. Thus, model 4 yields a substantially higher estimate of R, though both estimates seem reasonable (Anderson and May (1991) gives estimates of R 0 for measles ranging between 5 and 18 for various outbreaks). For both models, the posterior distribution of R was roughly bell-shaped and symmetric.",

            "text": "We would also like to assess the quality of the network and epidemic models that we have employed here to describe the Hagelloch measles epidemic. To this end, we consider simulating 1,000 contact networks from our network models and corresponding posterior parameter samples, and then simulating epidemics over these networks, again using epidemic parameter values sampled from the joint posterior distributions produced by our MCMC algorithm. We then assess the model fit by comparing the simulated epidemics with the actual original data. In particular, we compare the number of individuals in the infectious state over time as the epidemic progresses through the population. Figure 5 shows the actual data as compared to the simulated epidemics for model 4 as well as the Erd\u0151s-R\u00e9nyi model. Overall, the simulated epidemics produced by model 4 appear to more closely match the original Hagelloch measles data than do those produced using the simpler Erd\u0151s-R\u00e9nyi model. The epidemics produced by the Erd\u0151s-R\u00e9nyi model spread through the population more slowly than did the actual outbreak. This is particularly noticeable at days 30-40 (where the simulated number of infectious individuals is fewer than those in the actual outbreak) as well as at days 50-60 (where the simulated number of infectious individuals is greater than those in the actual outbreak). In contrast, the more general ERGM matches the actual outbreak pattern much more closely, with the number of individuals in the infectious state rapidly increasing and then decreasing at roughly the same time points as in the actual outbreak. We believe that the main factor contributing to the ability to better match the actual outbreak pattern is the more complicated structure of the full network model -and the corresponding degree distribution pattern it produces. With the exception of \u03b2, the estimates of the epidemic model parameters were very similar between the two models; hence we believe that the difference in network structure is the primary contributor to the improved model fit. We hasten to point out, though, that there are clearly aspects of this epidemic that even our improved model fails to adequately capture. For instance, the bulk of the simulated epidemics peak (in terms of number of infectious individuals) slightly (perhaps 3 days) before the peak of the actual outbreak. Also, the maximum number of infectious individuals in the actual outbreak is somewhat greater than that produced by the simulated epidemics.",

In particular, we consider the idea of shutting down the schools in order to try to contain the spread of the disease. This approach is perhaps overly simplistic, as the contact patterns of children outside of school would be modified, and probably increased, after a school closure (see, for example, Eames et al. (2011) ), yet we include it to demonstrate the ease with which control strategies can be modeled and tested within the framework we present here. As above, we simulate epidemics using parameter values sampled from the posterior distribution, but we set the \u03b7 parameters corresponding to Classroom 1 and Classroom 2 both equal to zero. Examining the resulting simulated outbreaks, a couple of observations can be made. First, this containment strategy does little to diminish the ultimate size of the outbreak. The left panel of Figure 6 shows a histogram of the number of individuals infected in the simulated outbreaks. While the outbreaks simulated under the containment strategy do indeed tend to be smaller, the difference is very small. (In fact, in both the presence and absence of the containment strategy, the epidemic affects almost all of the 187 susceptible individuals in virtually all of the simulations.) The right panel of Figure 6 gives a histogram showing the day on which the infectious group reaches its maximum size; we use this as a measure of the speed of the outbreak. We can see that the epidemic does spread considerably less rapidly in the presence of the containment strategy. These histograms indicate that this containment strategy, while only minimally effective in diminishing the ultimate size of the epidemic, is indeed able to significantly slow down the progression of the disease through the population.",

This more flexible framework makes it possible to incorporate any number of nodal and dyadic covariates, any of which may be categorical or quantitative in nature. We have shown that we can not only distinguish the (biological) effects of the epidemic from the (sociological) effects of the population interactions, but we can also make meaningful statements regarding the contact structure of the population in question and which factors have substantial impacts on this structure. We demonstrated our procedure by analyzing a very rich data set describing a measles outbreak in the town of Hagelloch, Germany in 1861. The results of this analysis also suggest that this approach has the potential to provide more thorough information regarding population structure than has previously been considered.",

(2011) similarly found that these were likely significant factors in the spread of this disease; all three analyses find that the Classroom 1 effect was more substantial than the corresponding Classroom 2 effect. Our analysis found that the Gender homophily factors also appear to affect the propensity of edge formation, while the evidence for the effect of age difference was much weaker; the other two analyses of these data did not include these factors in their model. Neal and Roberts (2004) finds a significant spatial effect in the transmission rate for this outbreak; they use three different forms for the spatial effect in their model and note that their results are robust to the choice of spatial model form. In the present analysis, other than the increase in infectious contact due to intra-household relationships, which we found to be the strongest effect, there does not appear to be much of a spatial effect in the data. Britton et al. (2011) did not include a spatial effect in their model. The choice of which model a researcher fits to data is largely down to what question the researcher wishes to answer. We believe there are many cases where it is of interest to separate the contact process from the transmission process as we have done here. Whereas the network model considered here is much more general than those previously utilized for this type of inference, it could nonetheless be extended in several ways. Much social networks literature recommends using a dyadic dependence model rather than the independence model we use here to capture effects such as clustering; however, we believe that the large number of covariates our independence model takes into account likely already captures clustering due to matching on these attributes, though in the absence of such covariate information it may be necessary to model clustering explicitly using a dyadic dependence model. It may also be useful in some cases to consider a more sophisticated model for the transmission rate than the simple model used here, which assumes that the transmission rate is constant, across both time and individuals. One might consider a rate that is a function of the length of time that an individual has been infected, since for many diseases, the level of infectiousness is known to vary throughout the infectious period. Further, we assumed that the infectious period began one day before the onset of prodromes and finished 3 days after the onset of rash. In work not reported here, we reanalysed the data with a longer infectious period, finishing 5 days after the appearance of rash, as in Lawson and Leimich (2000) . This change does not greatly affect parameter estimates (except for k I and \u03b8 I ) but it changes the shape of the observed epidemic curves of the type shown in Figure  5 , suggesting that this lag period could be estimated directly from the data.",
