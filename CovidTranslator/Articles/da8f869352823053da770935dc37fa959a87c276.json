Their coverage of these topics has been attracting increased scrutiny in recent years. 2, 3 For example, Goldacre has drawn attention to what he suggests may be a project by The Daily Mail to 'divide all the inanimate objects in the world into the ones that either cause or cure cancer'. 4 There have been a number of projects aimed at assessing the quality of medical reporting, such as the NHS 'Behind the Headlines' series. 5 Poor medical reporting can have serious consequences; Hargreaves et al. criticized journalists for their contribution, at least in part, to the controversy over the measlesemumpserubella vaccine for failing to challenge misleading claims. 6 Previous studies have examined what gets into the press, 2 what types of material are covered, 7e9 the sources from which newspaper articles were derived, 3 the contrast between messages in the scientific and lay press, 10 whether print media exaggerate scientific advances, 11 the role of press releases, 12, 13 and how journalists use the medical literature to produce newspaper articles. 14 There are also a number of excellent resources describing the quality of reporting, including the Australian Media Doctor initiative (www. mediadoctor.org.au) 15 and the US Health News Review (www.healthnewsreview.org).",

Using a newly developed tool to assess the quality of reporting, this study found that the highest quality articles were in The Times and The Independent, both of which achieved consistently high scores. Among the broadsheets, The Daily Telegraph was more prolific, publishing three times as many articles as The Times or The Independent, but many of these were short, anonymous articles that seemed to have been taken from the newswires. Only The Independent and The Guardian had no anonymous articles. Unsurprisingly, short articles taken directly from press releases scored lower as there was rarely any background information, risks and caveats were not explored, and a second opinion was not included. The significant correlation between column inches and scores is intuitive; longer articles have more scope to meet the criteria, such as discussion of caveats and giving an adequate background. Thus, it was unsurprising that The Times had the highest average quality as it also had the longest articles on average. The quality of articles correlated with the impact factor of the journals from which they emanated. This may, in part, reflect the study criteria; articles derived from journals with higher impact factors were more likely to report randomized controlled trials or large-scale studies, which will yield more information that will be captured by the tool. Another possibility is that the quality of the press release may be more informative in journals with a higher impact factor, thereby increasing the quality of derived articles.",

Consequently, the main findings summarized above add materially to what is already known about media coverage of health reporting. However, this study has also contributed to the methodology of assessing the quality of newspaper articles, operationalizing existing guidelines to create a novel instrument, demonstrating its reliability, and undertaking a process of item reduction to identify the core underlying constructs that can be used in future research (whether caveats are explored, whether the safety of a drug/intervention is described, whether there is a quotation from an independent specialist, whether the article is placed in context and whether risks are compared).",
