Although the virus was isolated in 1955, an effective RSV vaccine has not been developed, and the only licensed intervention is passive immunoprophylaxis of high-risk infants with a humanized monoclonal antibody. During the past 5 years, however, there has been substantial progress in our understanding of the structure and function of the RSV glycoproteins and their interactions with host cell factors that mediate entry. This period has coincided with renewed interest in developing effective interventions, including the isolation of potent monoclonal antibodies and small molecules and the design of novel vaccine candidates. In this Review , we summarize the recent findings that have begun to elucidate RSV entry mechanisms, describe progress on the development of new interventions and conclude with a perspective on gaps in our knowledge that require further investigation.",

In the following years, the virus was also isolated from infants with severe lower respiratory illness 2,3 . Since then, RSV has been demonstrated to be a ubiquitous pathogen that infects nearly all children by 2 years of age, with one-half having experienced two infections during that time 4 . Globally, RSV is responsible for ~60,000 in-hospital deaths annually in children younger than 5 years of age 5 , and in the United States, RSV has a disease burden similar to that of nonpandemic influenza A for elderly and high-risk adults 6 . Recognition of the substantial disease burden attributable to RSV has ignited interest in the development of effective interventions and has led to substantial investments by pharmaceutical companies and philanthropic organizations.",

This family also contains human metapneumovirus (hMPV), which belongs to the Metapneumovirus genus and, like RSV, is a major pathogen in children 7 . The symptoms of RSV and hMPV infection are indistinguishable 8 , and both are generally transmitted through close contact 9,10 , although they can be spread in aerosolized droplets 11 . After a short period of replication in the epithelial lining of the nasopharynx and upper respiratory tract, an RSV infection may spread to the small bronchioles or alveoli of the lower respiratory tract 12 . Host immune responses to RSV infection increase mucus production and inflammation, leading to a narrowing of the airway that results in bronchiolitis in young children and acute respiratory illness in older adults or those with underlying chronic conditions 13 . During a series of clinical trials in the 1960s, aberrant immune responses to natural infection after immunization with a formalin-inactivated whole-virus RSV vaccine were shown to cause vaccine-enhanced disease in infants [14] [15] [16] [17] . This disease was characterized in part by pulmonary neutrophil infiltration 18 and immune complex deposition in small airways 19 . As a result of those trials, RSV vaccine development has progressed cautiously, particularly in RSV-naive infants.",

There are multiple vaccine target populations -pregnant women, elderly individuals and RSV-naive infants -and each will likely benefit from a specific vaccine modality or regimen. The legacy of vaccine-enhanced disease has, in part, led to the development of alternative interventions, such as those using monoclonal antibodies and small mol ecules. This set of alternatives includes the FDA-approved monoclonal-antibody therapy licensed under the brand name Synagis, also known as palivizumab. However, its use is restricted to passive immunoprophylaxis of high-risk infants owing to its cost and modest efficacy 20 , and more potently neutralizing antibodies with longer half-lives are in development. Like antibodies, small-molecule fusion inhibitors block RSV entry, and they avoid concerns related to enhanced disease upon natural infection.",

The cystine noose present in these structures adopts a conserved fold that is also observed in the fourth subdomain of the tumour necrosis factor receptor (TNFR) 51 . In the past year, two groups determined four high-resolution X-ray crystal structures of neutralizing antibodies bound to human RSV G-derived peptides 52,53 . Although the cystine noose was structurally conserved with minor flexibility at the tip of the noose, multiple conformations of the highly conserved amino-terminal flanking region were observed, suggesting that this region is flexible and generally unstructured (FIg. 2c) .",

Over the past 20 years, duplication events in the RSV G ectodomain have generated emergent RSV genotypes that have been detected globally, including the Buenos Aires genotype (BA) in 1999 and the Ontario genotype (ON1) in 2010. The BA genotype is distinct from other RSV-B genotypes in having a 60-nucleotide duplication arranged as a tandem repeat insertion in the second mucin-like domain near the carboxyl terminus 58 . Following its first isolation, the BA genotype has spread globally and replaced the circulating RSV-B strains in certain regions 59, 60 .

This interaction is primarily mediated by a stretch of positively charged amino acids located between the two mucin-like domains of G, referred to as the heparin-binding domain 89 . However, variants of G lacking the heparin-binding domain retain some heparinase-sensitive binding to cells, suggesting that other regions of G may bind weakly to GAGs 87 .",

Virions containing only F on the surface retain ~50% of their infectivity for cells treated with heparinase or deficient in GAG synthesis, suggesting that F also interacts with one or more non-GAG attachment factors. Several proteins have been proposed to interact with F and facilitate RSV entry, including intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM1) 103 , epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) 104 and nucleolin 105 . Of these, the data for nucleolin are the strongest, and nucleolin has been shown to interact with many other viruses, including parainfluenza type 3 (PIV-3) 106 , enterovirus 71 (reF. 107 ), Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever virus 108 , adeno-associated virus type 2 (AAV-2) 109 and HIV-1 (reF. 110 ). Given the promiscuity of nucleolin, it is likely to function as an attachment factor for RSV F, as opposed to acting as a functional receptor.

A more recent report indicated that the initial steps of RSV fusion occur at cholesterol-rich microdomains in the plasma membrane, with completion of membrane fusion possibly requiring a dynamin-independent endocytic event 114 . A subsequent study demonstrated that RSV utilizes macropinocytosis as an initial entry mechanism followed by fusion in endosomes 115 .

Recent cryo-electron tomography studies have provided support for this model through the visualization of filament assembly and budding at the plasma membrane 170 . However, other experiments have suggested that this process may be more complex, with filament formation initially occurring intracellularly as vesicles containing viral proteins traffic along microtubules and grow into filaments that are then loaded with nucleocapsid before merging with the plasma membrane through an unknown mechanism 172 . After budding from the apical membrane of polarized epithelial cells, virions detach and are released in a m-dependent maturation process as filamentous particles ~130 nm in diameter and 0.5-12 micrometres in length 170, 173, 174 . over time, the m layer dissociates from the viral membrane, creating non-filamentous regions in the virion that ultimately lead to spherical or pleiomorphic particles that are thought to be less infectious, likely owing to a premature conversion of the F protein from the prefusion to postfusion conformation 77, 78 .

Receptor-induced triggering remains a possibility, although a host cell molecule that stimulates refolding of F has not been identified to date. Evidence for such a molecule was suggested in an article from 2003 that reported that human RSV infects human but not bovine primary cells, whereas bovine RSV infects bovine but not human primary cells 116 . Using chimeric viruses, the species tropism was attributed to the F 2 subunit. However, to our knowledge, these data were neither pursued further nor independently verified. The third option, provocation by a second viral glycoprotein, appears unlikely given that virions lacking both the G and SH proteins are infectious and grow to high titres in culture. Furthermore, unlike the attachment proteins of paramyxoviruses, which have tertiary and quaternary structure 117, 118 , the G proteins of RSV and the related hMPV are predicted to be mostly disordered 65 . This lack of structure would make it difficult to transduce a binding event from the G protein to the F protein. A fourth mechanism, originally proposed for certain paramyxoviruses, is known as the clamp model (reviewed elsewhere 119 ), whereby the G protein binds to and prevents spontaneous triggering of the F protein until engagement of the G protein by a host cell receptor. The ability of viruses lacking the G protein to grow to high titres in cell culture disfavours this mechanism for RSV F.",

The benefit of triggering at the proper time and place is that all fusion proteins remain functional until the possibility of a productive fusion event is maximized. However, it may not be necessary for all viruses to be so efficient. It is well documented that the prefusion conformation of RSV F is unstable and converts to the postfusion form at some basal rate 77 . As expected, both longer incubation times and incubation at elevated temperatures increase the conversion to the postfusion conformation 78,120 . Therefore, it is possible that the basal rate of spontaneous conversion to the postfusion form is sufficient for RSV entry once attachment by G or F brings the target cell membrane into close apposition with refolding F proteins (FIg. 4) . Evidence for this model would likely require fusion reconstitution experiments with liposomes or supported lipid bilayers in which the composition of the target membrane could be carefully controlled.",

In the provocateur model (see the figure) , the binding of a cellular receptor to the receptor-binding domain head of the tetrameric attachment protein results in a conformational change that, in a two-step process, first exposes the four-helix bundle stalk domain, enabling association with F, and then triggers membrane fusion by lowering the activation energy required to initiate F refolding through F-stalk interactions. Crystal structures of various paramyxovirus attachment proteins have revealed the beginning (four heads down) 176 , intermediate (two heads up and two heads down) 177 and end (four heads up) 117 states of the conformational changes in the tetrameric head domains associated with the unveiling of the stalk domain. Compelling evidence for the provocateur model comes from experiments utilizing 'headless' stalk constructs that have been observed to constitutively activate conformational changes in F [178] [179] [180] . In addition, certain residues on the surface of the Newcastle disease virus or parainfluenza virus 5 HN stalk have been shown to specifically disrupt fusion activation 176 , presumably through direct interactions with the F protein (reviewed elsewhere 181 ). Thus, although a number of outstanding questions remain, the molecular mechanisms governing the spatiotemporal regulation of Paramyxoviridae fusion activation have a solid basis in experimental evidence and appear to be conserved across this family of viruses.",

An RSV intravenous immune globulin infusion preparation, RespiGam, was used prophylactically in the late 1990s and early 2000s to prevent severe RSV-associated lower respiratory tract disease in young children with bronchopulmonary dysplasia or premature birth 124 . The use of RespiGam was discontinued in 2003 and replaced by prophylaxis with palivizumab (Synagis), a humanized murine monoclonal antibody that binds the F glycoprotein 125 . Palivizumab recognizes an epitope within antigenic site II, which is preserved on both the prefusion and postfusion F conformations 126 (FIg. 5a) . As palivizumab does not prevent triggering of conformational changes in F, it presumably blocks entry and membrane fusion by preventing conversion of the prehairpin intermediate into the postfusion conformation. As with RespiGam, palivizumab is used for prophylaxis only for high-risk infants because of its cost and limited efficacy 20 .",

Some of the F-directed antibodies are 10-50-fold more potent than palivizumab, and many of them recognize epitopes located exclusively on the prefusion conformation. Consequently, these prefusionspecific antibodies are able to lock F in its prefusion conformation and prevent conversion to the prehairpin intermediate 76 . One such human antibody, called D25, which recognizes antigenic site \u00d8, was optimized to produce a variant, MEDI8897, with enhanced potency and extended serum half-life 133 . Owing to these improvements, MEDI8897 may require only a single dose during the RSV season to prevent severe disease in infants, and results from a phase IIb clinical study were expected in late 2018 (reF. 134 ). However, a different prefusion-specific antibody, REGN2222, which recognizes antigenic site V, recently failed to reach its clinical end points in a phase III study 135 , and the reasons for the failure are not yet known. Other prefusion-specific antibodies are also in preclinical development, as are antibodies directed against the G protein that inhibit viral attachment 52,53 . Cocktails of antibodies against F and G, or against two different antigenic sites on F, are also being considered and may lead to synergistic effects and reduced viral escape.",

On the basis of crosslinking studies with RSV virions 138 and biochemical and structural studies with peptides comprising the heptad repeats of the RSV F 1 subunit 139 , it was thought that the small molecules bound to a fusion intermediate of F and prevented the postfusion conformation from completely forming. However, once the prefusion and postfusion F protein crystal structures were determined, the escape mutations for these molecules were found to cluster inside the central cavity of the prefusion conformation, whereas in the postfusion conformation, they were separated by ~100 angstroms 140 (FIg. 5b) . Crystallographic experiments later revealed that the small molecules bind inside the central cavity of the prefusion conformation and interact with residues in the fusion peptide and the second heptad repeat 141 . Functional studies with soluble F proteins 142 and membrane-bound F proteins 141 demonstrated that the small molecules function as antagonists that prevent The fusion (F) protein can interact with one or more attachment factors to bind the virus to the host cell, a process that is greatly enhanced by the viral attachment protein (not shown).

Approximately 5 years ago, researchers demonstrated that the majority of RSV-neutralizing activity in human sera is specific for the prefusion conformation of F 147 , and many of the most potent antibodies specifically target this conformation 129, 148 . As a result, vaccine development of candidates containing the F protein has focused on structure-based engineering approaches to stabilize F in the prefusion conformation 75, 149 , and animal studies have shown that prefusion F elicits higher neutralizing antibody titres than does postfusion F. Currently, several prefusion F-subunit vaccine candidates are in phase I clinical trials 150,151 , and results are expected to be announced in 2019. Candidates containing postfusion F, or molecules with the postfusion F morphology, have failed in several recent late-stage clinical trials [152] [153] [154] , but they remain under development, and one candidate is being tested in a phase III trial 155 .

Vaccines based on viral vectors and DNA or RNA are also thought to be safe for infants because the infants' cells produce the encoded antigen or antigens, leading to a balanced T cell response and display of properly folded antigens on the cell surface for antibody recognition and elicitation. There are several live-attenuated vaccine candidates in phase I trials, with the majority attenuated via deletion of viral genes such as NS2 or M22 (reF. 157 ). New candidates in preclinical development include some that have been engineered to display prefusion-stabilized variants of the F glycoprotein 158, 159 . Three vector-based candidates are in or have almost completed phase II trials, including two adenovirus candidates expressing either prefusion-stabilized F protein 160 or F, N and M2-1 (reF. 161 ) and a modified vaccinia Ankara (MVA) candidate expressing F, G, N and M2-1 (reF. 162 ). For all live-attenuated vaccines, achieving the optimal balance between attenuation and immunogenicity will be crucial, whereas viral vector and nucleic-acid-based vaccines will need to achieve sufficient gene delivery and expression to produce a robust immune response.",

Indeed, we may now be closer to having an effective RSV vaccine than we are to understanding the molecular mechanisms of RSV attachment and fusion. Future experiments should define how, or if, the G protein interacts with CX 3 CR1 and uncover new host cell attachment factors. Similarly, the interactions of F with G and M proteins and host cell factors will need to be biochemically and biophysically characterized. The development of reconstituted fusion assays should help to better define the minimal requirements for RSV fusion and answer outstanding questions concerning the triggering of the F protein. Structural studies of F protein intermediates, as well as uncleaved forms of F, will also improve our understanding of RSV fusion and may identify new targets for antibodies or small molecules.",

Clinical trials for fusion inhibitors, such as JNJ-53718678, are ongoing, and new trials will be started soon. For small-molecule and monoclonal-antibody interventions, which bind to a single site on the glycoproteins, the presence and distribution of naturally occurring RSV variants will need to be monitored as they could affect the results of clinical trials and long-term product efficacy. Similarly, the large-scale administration of such an intervention may select for the emergence of escape variants, as has occurred for other RNA viruses such as the influenza virus, and cocktails of more than one antibody or small molecule should be considered for development. Vaccines may also benefit from the monitoring of RSV variation, although in general, the immune responses to vaccines are diverse and target multiple viral epitopes.",
