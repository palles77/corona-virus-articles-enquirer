BamHI and XhoI restriction sites were attached to the 5' and 3' ends separately by PCR, and the PCR product was inserted into the pET-28b-SUMO vector. The recombinant plasmids were transformed into Escherichia coli strain BL21 (DE3) (TransGen Biotech). kanamycin-resistant colonies were grown in Luria-Bertani medium at 37 \u00b0C until the OD 600 reached 0.8. Isopropyl \u03b2-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside was added to a final concentration of 0.1 mM, and the cultures were grown for an additional 20 h at 16 \u00b0C. Cells were harvested by centrifugation, resuspended, and homogenized in lysis buffer containing 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 150 mM NaCl, 4 mM MgCl 2",

Data were processed and scaled using the HKL2000 package [1]. The crystal belonged to the space group P2 1 2 1 2 1 , with one HCoV-EMC 3CL pro dimer per asymmetric unit, corresponding to a solvent content of 47% [2] . The complex structure was determined using PHASER [3] with the crystal structure of SARS-CoV 3CL pro (PDB code: 2AMQ) as the initial searching model. The presence of bound N3 molecules was initially revealed by the difference in the density map. Manual model construction and refinement were performed with COOT [4] and PHENIX HcoV-EMC 3CL pro -2012.09.19 [5] following rigid body refinement, energy minimization, and individual B-factor refinement. The quality of the final refined model was verified using the program PROCHECK [6] . The final refinement statistics are summarized in Table S1 .",
