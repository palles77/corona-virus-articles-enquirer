It is a rare disease that occurs mainly in individuals who are exposed to tropical rain forests and are bitten by mosquitoes that have been infected by monkeys. The intermediate cycle of yellow fever occurs only in humid or semihumid savannahs of Africa and in small-scale epidemics in rural areas. Semidomestic mosquitoes infect monkey and human hosts. Urban yellow fever is a disease of humans. It is spread by Aedes aegypti mosquitoes that have been infected by other people. These mosquitoes have adapted to living among humans in cities, towns, and villages. Urban yellow fever is the cause of most yellow fever outbreaks and epidemics.",

With advances in biotechnology, category C bioterrorism agents and emerging pathogens may become attractive weapons for bioterrorists. For bioterrorists, category C bioterrorism agents and emerging pathogens have many advantages over conventional weapons and other biologic agents listed under categories A and B, including their relatively low costs; their relative accessibility; and the relative ease with which they could be produced, be delivered, and avoid detection. Their use, or even threatened use, is potentially capable of producing widespread social disruption. Although biotechnology is a tool by which bioterrorists could develop weapons of mass destruction, it also should be used to improve the methods of fighting such weapons.",
