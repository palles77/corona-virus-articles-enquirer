The resulted amplicons were separated by gel electrophoresis, and the DNA fragments were excised, purified and subjected to sequencing in both directions. The obtained sequences were verified by basic local alignment search tool. As for the amplification of complete N gene region, cDNA was synthesized by using SuperScript III First Strand Synthesis System for RT-PCR (Invitrogen, USA) with NR2 primer (Table 1). Two microliters of the generated cDNA was subjected to one round of PCR cycle by using MyFi \u2122 Mix Kit (Bioline, USA) with NF1 and NR2 (Table 1) primers following the parameters: 95 \u00b0C for 1 min followed by 25 cycles at 95 \u00b0C for 15 seconds, 52 \u00b0C for 15 seconds and 72 \u00b0C for 30 seconds and terminal elongation at 72 \u00b0C for 5 min. Then, 0.5 \u03bcL of the resulted PCR amplicon was further subjected to the second round PCR following the abovementioned parameters.

Similar observation as the Malaysian case has been reported by Memish et al. [9] , which substantiate the cross-species transmission to humans, with the possibility of dromedary camels being the primary reservoir hosts of MERS-CoV [8] [9] [10] [11] . Juvenile camels may play a big role in the viral transmission, since the younger were shown to shed more virus compared to the old ones [9, 10, 12] . The transmission from camels to human was postulated to occur through very close contact with high infectious dose of virus via nasal route [11] . Other possible route of transmission is via consumption of raw milk from infected camels, which was supported by a report showing that MERS-CoV could survive slightly longer in raw camel milk in comparison to other species [13] .",

            "text": "On 15 April 2014, Malaysia has confirmed the first case of MERS-CoV infection in a 54 year-old man, who came back from Saudi Arabia after performing the umrah. He was a known diabetic and was on medical treatment. The patient had departed from Jeddah and arrived in Malaysia on 29 March 2014; and on 10 April 2014, he was admitted to one of the local hospitals for treatment of severe acute respiratory infection. However, he succumbed to his illness on 13 April 2014[3].Combination of throat and nasal swab specimens taken from the patient was sent to a state hospital laboratory that has the capability to perform real-time RT-PCR (rRT-PCR) assay for MERS-PCR targeting partial part of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and nucleocapsid, followed by amplification of complete N gene region. Nucleotide sequencing of the first Malaysian case of MERS-CoV was performed following the confirmation with real-time RT-PCR detection. Results: Initial analysis of partial RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and N gene revealed that the nucleotides had high similarity to Jeddah_1_2013 strain. Analysis of complete N gene region (1 242 nucleotides) from the case showed high similarity and yet distinct to the nucleotide sequences of camel-derived MERS-CoV. Conclusions: From the finding, there are possibilities that the patient acquired the infection from zoonotic transmission from dromedary camels.CoV. An rRT-PCR screening assay targeting upstream of E gene (upE) and an rRT-PCR confirmatory assay targeting open reading frame (ORF) 1a gene were performed at the state hospital and both assays were positive for MERS-CoV[3]. Since this is the first case that has ever yielded a positive result in Malaysia, the sample was sent to the Virology Unit, Institute for Medical Research, Kuala Lumpur which acts as the national MERS-CoV confirmation laboratory, for further investigations. In this study, the complete N gene region of MERS-CoV of the first Malaysian case was analyzed and it was compared genetically with other human cases and virus identified in camels.",
