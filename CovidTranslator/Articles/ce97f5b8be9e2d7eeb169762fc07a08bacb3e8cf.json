Little is understood regarding how 21 specific thymine residues are targeted for J-modification or the mechanism of J regulated transcription 22 termination. To identify proteins involved in J-synthesis, we expressed a tagged version of the J-23 glucosyltransferase (JGT) in Leishmania tarentolae, and identified four co-purified proteins by mass 24 spectrometry: protein phosphatase (PP1), a homolog of Wdr82, a potential PP1 regulatory protein 25 (PNUTS) and a protein containing a J-DNA binding domain (named JBP3). Gel shift studies indicate 26 JBP3 is a J-DNA binding protein. Reciprocal tagging, co-IP and sucrose gradient analyses indicate PP1, 27 JGT, JBP3, Wdr82 and PNUTS form a multimeric complex in kinetoplastids, similar to the mammalian 28 PTW/PP1 complex involved in transcription termination via PP1 mediated dephosphorylation of Pol II. 29 Using RNAi and analysis of Pol II termination by RNA-seq and RT-PCR, we demonstrate that ablation of 30 PNUTS, JBP3 and Wdr82 lead to defects in Pol II termination at the 3'-end of polycistronic gene arrays in 31 Trypanosoma brucei. Mutants also contain increased antisense RNA levels upstream of promoters, 32 suggesting an additional role of the complex in regulating termination of bi-directional transcription. In 33 addition, PNUTS loss causes derepression of silent Variant Surface Glycoprotein genes important for 34 host immune evasion. Our results provide the first direct mechanistic link between base J and regulation 35 of Pol II termination and suggest a novel molecular model for the role of the CTD of Pol II in terminating 36 polycistronic transcription in trypanosomatids. 37 38 Author Summary 39 Trypanosoma brucei is an early-diverged parasitic protozoan that causes African sleeping 40 sickness in humans. The genome of T. brucei is organized into polycistronic gene clusters that contain 41 multiple genes that are co-transcribed from a single promoter. We have recently described the presence 42 of a modified DNA base J and variant of histone H3 (H3.V) at transcription termination sites within gene 43 clusters where the loss of base J and H3.V leads to read-through transcription and the expression of 44 downstream genes.

However, the underlying termination mechanism is not fully understood. In typical 60 eukaryotes, Pol II termination of protein-coding genes is tightly linked to the processing of the nascent 61 transcript 3' end (reviewed in (1)). This association ensures complete formation of stable polyadenylated 62 mRNA products and prevents the elongating Pol II complex from interfering with transcription of 63 downstream genes. Transcription through the polyadenylation site results in an exchange of transcription 64 factors, resulting in the regulation of the elongation-to-termination transition, in an ordered series of 65 events: 1) dissociation of the elongation factor Spt5, 2) Pol II pausing, 3) changes in phosphorylation 66 status of Pol II C-terminal domain (CTD), which promotes 4) recruitment of cleavage factors and 67 termination factors, 5) transcript cleavage and 6) termination by the 5'-3' 'torpedo' exoribonuclease 68 XRN2/Rat1.",

This PP1-dependent dephosphorylation allows the efficient recruitment 73 of the termination factor Seb1 as well as decreased Spt5 stimulation of Pol II elongation that enhances 74 the capture by the torpedo exoribonuclease. Transcription termination was also affected in the S. 75 cerevisiae PP1 isotype Glc7 mutant (3). PP1 action is modulated through the formation of heteromeric 76 complexes with specific regulatory subunits (4). These regulatory protein subunits regulate PP1 by 77 targeting the protein to specific subcellular compartments, to particular substrates, or reduce its activity 78 towards potential substrates. The vast majority of regulators are intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) 79 and bind PP1 via a primary PP1-binding motif, the RVxF motif (4-6). One of the key PP1 regulatory 80 proteins in the nucleus is the PP1 nuclear targeting subunit (PNUTS) (7, 8). PNUTS is a multidomain 81 protein defined by the canonical PP1 RVxF interaction motif. It also has an N-terminal domain that 82 interacts with the DNA binding protein Tox4 and a domain near the C-terminus that interacts with Wdr82 83 (9). This stable multimeric complex in humans is named the PTW/PP1 complex. Targeting of the complex 84 to chromatin is presumably due in part through associations with Tox4. While the function of Wdr82 in this 85 complex is not known, it may mediate interactions with Pol II by recognizing Ser5-phosphorylated CTD, 86 as it does when it is associated with the Set1 complex (10). In yeast, PP1 is associated with PNUTS and 87 Wdr82 homologs in APT, a subcomplex of the cleavage and polyadenylation factor (11-14), and their 88 deletion caused termination defects at Pol II-dependent genes (15, 16). In mammals, PNUTS and Wdr82 89 mutant cells have defects in transcription termination at the 3' end of genes and 5' antisense transcription 90 at bi-directional promoters (17).",

Kinetoplastids are early-diverged protozoa with unique genome arrangements 93 where genes are organized into polycistronic transcription units (PTU) that are transcribed by Pol II. Pre-94 messenger RNAs (mRNA) are processed to mature mRNA with the addition of a 5' spliced leader 95 sequence through trans-splicing, followed by 3' polyadenylation (reviewed in (18)). Given the close 96 relationship between poly(A) processing and transcription termination in other eukaryotes, it is not clear 97 how multiple functional poly(A) sites within the trypanosome PTU can be transcribed without resulting in 98 premature termination. Therefore, a novel signal or mechanism may be involved in allowing polycistronic 99 transcription and termination in kinetoplastids. Two chromatin factors, base J and histone H3 variant 100 (H3.V), have recently been shown to have an impact on Pol II termination in kinetoplastids. Base J is a .

In T. brucei and Leishmania major, J and 103 H3.V are enriched at sites involved in Pol II termination (20-23). This includes sites within polycistronic 104 gene clusters where (premature) termination silences downstream genes. Loss of J or H3.V leads to 105 read-through transcription (21-26). At PTU internal termination sites this leads to increased expression of 106 the downstream genes.

Equally unclear is what 111 regulates the specific localization of these marks, including base J, in the genome. Base J is synthesized 112 in a two-step pathway in which a thymidine hydroxylase (TH), JBP1 or JBP2, hydroxylates thymidine 113 residues at specific positions in DNA to form hydroxymethyluracil (hmU) (27), followed by the transfer of 114 glucose to hmU by the glucosyltransferase, JGT (28, 29) (reviewed in (19, 30)). The TH enzymes, JBP1 115 and JBP2, contain a TH domain at the N-terminus (27, 31-34). JBP1 has a J-DNA binding domain in the 116 C-terminal half of the protein that is able to bind synthetic J-DNA substrates in vitro and bind chromatin in 117 a J-dependent manner in vivo (35-38). The ability of JBP1 to bind J-DNA is thought to play a role in J 118 propagation and maintenance. JBP2 does not bind the modified base directly, but is able to bind 119 chromatin in a base J independent manner, presumably via the C-terminal SWI2/SNF2 domain (31, 35). 120 The JGT lacks DNA sequence specificity, and can convert hmU to base J in vivo regardless of where it is 121 present (39-41). This and other analysis of J synthesis indicate that JBP1 and JBP2 are the key 122 regulatory enzymes of J synthesis.",

It . https://doi.org/10.1101/753004 doi: bioRxiv preprint 157 previously characterized. We named the 74-kDa protein JBP3 (LtaP36.0380) because it has a domain 158 with homology to the base J DNA binding domain of JBP1 (Fig 1B and S1 ) and we demonstrate its ability 159 to bind J-DNA (see below). The 29-kDa JGT interacting protein was named PNUTS (LtaP33.1440) since 160 it contains a conserved RVxF PP1 interactive domain (Fig 1C and S2 Fig) within an apparent intrinsically 161 disordered region of the protein and is a part of a complex similar to the PTW/PP1 complex in humans 162 (where JBP3 may represent a functional homolog of Tox4). PP1 interactive proteins such as PNUTS are 163 highly disordered in their unbound state and fall in a group of intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) (4-6). 164 This intrinsic flexibility is important for the formation of extensive interactions with PP1 (6, 43, 44). A 165 bioinformatics analysis using the DISOPRED3 program (45, 46), which scores for the occurrence of 166 disorder-inducing amino acids, predicts a majority of TbPNUTS is disordered (S2 Fig). Similarly, the 167 Compositional profiler (47) shows PNUTS is enriched in major disorder-promoting residues and depleted 168 in major order-promoting residues. This inherent disorder may explain why TbPNUTS migrates slower in 169 SDS-PAGE than predicted (see S3A Fig). To confirm the complex, we subsequently performed tandem 170 affinity purifications with tagged JBP3 and Wdr82. Reciprocal purification of JBP3 and Wdr82 resulted in 171 the identification of JGT, PNUTS, PP1, JBP3 and Wdr82 with a significant number of unique peptide hits 172 (Table 1 ). These data indicate that in Leishmania JGT associates with a protein complex composed of 173 PNUTS, PP1, JBP3 and Wdr82 similar to the PTW/PP1 complex in humans, shown to be involved in 174 transcription termination (Fig 1F) . While JBP3 may be a functional homologue of the human Tox4 DNA 175 binding protein (see below), JBP3 appears to be conserved only in the genus trypanosome. Based on this 176 similarity, we now refer to this complex as PJW/PP1 in Leishmania. 177 178 Fig 1. Identification of a novel phosphatase complex in Leishmania tarentolae.

As shown in Fig   465 5A and B, the silent 8340 gene within a dSSR on chromosome 10 is transcribed upon the loss of 466 TbPNUTS. To see whether there is a correlation between the initiation of the antisense transcript with 467 sense mRNA coding strand TSS, we analyzed the 5'-end of the nascent antisense transcript at this dSSR 468 using RT-PCR (Fig 5C) . The significant drop of inability of a 5' primer to amplify the cDNA corresponding 469 to the nascent 'antisense' transcript indicates the 5' end of the PNUTS regulated transcript is adjacent to 470 the TSS for the sense transcript on the opposing strand. Using various 3' primers for generating cDNA, 471 antisense transcription is attenuated in uninduced cells as shown in the decline in cDNA with increasing 472 length of the transcript (Fig 5D) . In the absence of PNUTS the antisense transcription fails to terminate, 473 as seen in the maintained levels of cDNA for all primers tested in + Tet. The increasing effects of the loss 474 of PNUTS on level of transcript with increasing length of the transcript supports the idea of PNUTS 475 regulating early termination/elongation of the antisense transcript.

In other cases there is selective upregulation of the VSG gene, including the pseudo VSGs 576 that are present upstream of some telomeric VSGs. The apparent selective VSG upregulation may be 577 due to the combined effect of low level transcription of the entire BES and enhanced stability of VSG 578 mRNAs. For example, the increased VSG mRNA half-life (4.5 hrs) compared with ESAG 6 and 7 (1.8-2.8 579 hrs) (81, 82). Transcripts of genes located approximately 5 kb upstream of the VSG have also been 580 shown to be selectively rapidly degraded, presumably by nonsense-mediated decay (83). We also 581 noticed that increased levels of RNA close to the promoter are significantly higher when there is an 582 additional BES promoter upstream for ESAG10. In fact, the most significant gene expression changes are 583 in BESs that have dual promoters (S2 Table) . These data would suggest derepression of telomere-584 proximal VSG genes after PNUTS depletion is due to transcriptional activation of silent Pol I promoters. 585 However, these results are also consistent with increased Pol I elongation along the BES. Repression of 586 silent ESs is mediated at least in part by the inhibition of Pol I elongation within the BES preventing the 587 production of VSG mRNA from the silent BESs (84-86). Similar to its inhibition of Pol II transcription 588 elongation at termination sites at the 5' and 3' end of PTUs genome-wide, PNUTS may also function at 589 telomeric regions to attenuate Pol I transcription elongation within the silent ESs. The data here suggest 590 PJW/PP1 controls VSG silencing at BESs by regulating Pol I elongation (termination) and/or regulating 591 access of the polymerase to silent promoter regions.",

A fixed value peptide spectral match (PSM) 843 validation node was used to validate each PSM at a maximum delta Cn of 0.05. All PSMs were subjected 844 to further validation with a maximum of 1% false discovery rate utilizing PSMs matched to a reverse 845 (decoy) database while being assigned to protein groups. The L. tarentolae JBP3 gene was amplified from genomic DNA by PCR with primers containing 5' 860 Nde I and 3' BamH I restriction sites. PCR fragments were digested with Nde I and BamH I and 861 subcloned into the pet16b expression vector.

The role of PNUTS is 680 thought to reflect the essential nature of PNUTS/PP1 since differential phosphorylation of the CTD of Pol 681 II has been proposed to regulate the directionality of transcription at bi-directional promoters. Specifically, 682 Tyr1 and Ser1 hyperphosphorylation of Pol II have been shown to be associated with antisense divergent 683 transcription at mammalian promoters (106-108). Spt5 regulation of Pol II elongation is involved in control 684 of divergent antisense transcription as well as readthrough transcription at 3' end of genes in yeast",

Of the 40 early firing origins that have been mapped in T. brucei, 36 are upstream of TSS (73).497 Analysis of L. major has indicated that replication initiation sites occur at the genomic locations where Pol 498 II stalls or terminates, including sites precisely downstream of base J (74). Therefore, increased 499 transcription at PTU flanking regions in the absence of TbPNUTS may cause DNA replication defects. To 500 see whether pervasive transcription has any effect on T. brucei replication, we first analyzed whether 501 TbPNUTS is required for proper cell-cycle progression. In T. brucei, DNA replication and segregation of 502 kinetoplastid DNA (K) in the single mitochondrion precede those of nuclear DNA (N), so cells at different 503 stages can be distinguished by their N and K configurations. 1N1K content indicates that cells are in G1, 504 1N2K indicates cells in S phase and 2N2K indicate post-mitotic cells.

To do this we 509 labeled TbPNUTS RNAi cell line (treated with tetracycline for 0, 1 and 2 days) with BrdU and BrdU 510 labeled DNA was then detected using anti-BrdU antibodies. As shown in S9B and C Fig, uninduced cells 511 show normal cell cycle profiles. Two days after RNAi ablation, there is no change in the cell-cycle profile 512 or quantities of cells at each stage. Similarly, there is no detectable change in levels of BrdU incorporation 513 in the S phase population (S9C Fig).
