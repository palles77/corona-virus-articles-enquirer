CyHV-3 has been implicated in a large number of disease outbreaks in carp populations causing up to 100% mortality. The aim of this study was to investigate the requirement of cholesterol-rich lipid rafts in CyHV-3 entry and replication in carp cells. Plasma membrane cholesterol was depleted from common carp brain (CCB) cells with methyl-b-cyclodextrin (MbCD). Treated and nontreated cells were infected with CyHV-3 and virus binding and infection parameters were assessed using RT-qPCR, immunocytochemistry and virus titration. The effect of cholesterol reduction severely stunted virus entry in vitro, however after cholesterol replenishment virus entry and subsequent replication rates were similar to the control infection. Furthermore, cholesterol depletion did not significantly influence virus binding and the subsequent post-entry replication stage, however had an impact on virus egress. Comparative analysis of the lipid compositions of CyHV-3 and CCB membrane fractions revealed strong similarities between the lipid composition of the CyHV-3 and CCB lipid rafts. The results presented here show that cholesterol-rich lipid rafts are important for the CyHV-3 replication cycle especially during entry and egress.",

Members of the Alloherpesviridae family are increasingly recognised as pathogens in aquaculture. One important pathogen is the Cyprinid herpesvirus 3 (CyHV-3), a herpesvirus from the Cyprinivirus genus which infects common carp, Cyprinus carpio and its coloured variety, the koi (Waltzek et al., 2009) . CyHV-3 infections may cause severe outbreaks of the so called koi herpesvirus disease (KHVD) leading to up to 100% mortalities in infected populations, consequently causing a severe negative impact on carp aquaculture and the ornamental koi trade.",

The CyHV-3 virion has an icosahedral capsid, an amorphic protein tegument and a lipid envelope containing virus glycoproteins Hutoran et al., 2005) which it acquires during the budding step from infected cells. This process is similar to the mechanism observed for mammalian herpesviruses (Mettenleiter, 2002) . In electron microscopical studies on infected cells, CyHV-3 nucleocapsids appear to bud from the inner nuclear membrane into the perinuclear space. When the nucleocapsids cross the outer nuclear membrane into the cytoplasm, its primary envelope is lost and a second envelope is acquired through budding into cytoplasmic vesicles (Hanson et al., 2011; Miwa et al., 2007) .",

            "text": "In enveloped viruses, the viral membrane is required for the critical steps of entry into the target cell and fusion with the host's cellular membrane in order to deliver the viral capsid into the cell cytosol. The classical endocytotic pathway, which many viruses use as the primary step of internalisation, is clathrin-dependent endocytosis (Marsh and Helenius, 2006) . Instead, many viruses use the lipid raft/caveola-dependent entry route, which is characterised by the importance of high levels of cholesterol and sphingolipids ((Doherty and McMahon, 2009 ) and references therein). In the plasma membrane of cells (chole) sterolsphingolipids are particularly enriched in dynamic nanoscale liquid ordered microdomains, ordered assemblies of proteins and lipids, which are also termed as lipid rafts (Simons and Toomre, 2000) . These microdomains are associated with a range of important cellular and physiological functions including cell signalling, membrane and protein trafficking and sorting and nutrient transport. Lipid rafts have been extensively studied in mammals. In fish, lipid rafts have been isolated from rainbow trout (Zehmer and Hazel, 2003) , Atlantic cod (Gylfason and Asgeirsson, 2008) , and common carp , furthermore the presence of functional lipid rafts in goldfish macrophages was shown (Garcia-Garcia et al., 2012) . The lipid raft model is used to investigate a large range of processes including, protein trafficking (Ikonen, 2001) , metabolic diseases (Maalouf et al., 2010) and cell signalling (Magee et al., 2002; Varma and Mayor, 1998) . In addition, lipid rafts and cell membrane cholesterol were found to be involved in various stages of the viral life cycle, such as entry (Nguyen and Hildreth, 2000; Ono and Freed, 2001) , assembly and budding (Chazal and Gerlier, 2003) . Many studies demonstrated that several enveloped viruses enter host cells in a cholesteroldependent manner, including coronavirus (Choi et al., 2005) , poxvirus (Chung et al., 2005) , paramyxovirus (Martin et al., 2012) and herpesvirus (Bender et al., 2003) .",

Currently, CyHV-3 infection is considered the most serious disease affecting carp aquaculture worldwide . Knowledge of how this virus penetrates the host's cell membrane helps understanding the infection process and allows us to improve antiviral strategies against this serious pathogen of common carp.",

We demonstrate that depletion of cellular cholesterol by methyl-b-cyclodextrin (MbCD) reduces CyHV-3 cell entry and budding. Furthermore, the CyHV-3 lipid profile showed a greater similarity to the cholesterol rich, lipid ordered membrane microdomains suggesting a role for lipid rafts in virus trafficking in the cell. To our knowledge, this is the first communication which addresses the role of lipid membrane components during the infection of fish cells with an aquatic herpesvirus.",

At this concentration a higher level of cell death was observed as described in Section 2.2 (data not shown). Incubation with 7.5 and 10 mM of MbCD led to a significant reduction in cholesterol levels whilst not disrupting the cell monolayer, furthermore no changes in cell morphology could be observed. Subsequently, the kinetics of MbCD induced cholesterol depletion was examined including the rate of cholesterol replenishment. Incubation of CCB cells with 10 mM MbCD for 1 h led to an almost 70% reduction in the cholesterol content of the cells at 1 and 2 h post incubation (Fig. 1b) . At 48 h post incubation, the cellular cholesterol was replenished to the pre-treatment level. In untreated cells and the cells incubated with both 10 mM MbCD and 2.5 mM cholesterol, the cholesterol levels were maintained at the pretreatment level (Fig. 1b) . In all treatments, the cell monolayers remained intact and the cells remained viable. Therefore for further experimentation, 10 mM MbCD and an incubation period of 1 h were selected. ",

The mRNA expression of CyHV-3 genes which were used as a marker for CyHV-3 replication, TK, MCP and DP all showed significantly lower expression levels in the MbCD treated cells at 2 and 5 days post infection. In infected cell cultures, the expression levels of these genes increased during the time of infection, and therefore the expression levels of these genes corresponds to the progress of infection in an in vitro setting (Adamek et al., 2012) . The viral gene expression levels were significantly lower in MbCD treated cells when compared to cells co-treated with MbCD and cholesterol as well as in non-treated cells in both time points (P 0.001). At 2 days p.i., the mRNA expression in MbCD treated cells was 56\u00c2 lower for CyHV-3 TK, 65\u00c2 for CyHV-3 DP and 85\u00c2 lower for CyHV-3 MCP compared to non-treated cells (Fig. 2a) . The differences were even higher at 5 days p.i. (from 73\u00c2 for CyHV-3 DP to 110\u00c2 for CyHV-3 MCP) (Fig. 2a-c) . Interestingly, this assay also showed (similarly to FICC) that the MbCD and cholesterol cotreated cells displayed slightly higher expression of viral genes (form 1.2\u00c2 to 1.6\u00c2) than the non-treated cells (Fig. 2a-c) .",

The development of effective treatment strategies for these virus infections requires knowledge of their basic replication traits. Entry into a host cell for a virus is the critical step for initiating infections. Knowledge of virus entry pathways is therefore important for understanding viral pathogenesis, target cell population and exploring effective treatment strategies which block virus infection before entering the cell. Cyprinid herpesviruses, together with other herpesviruses from fish and amphibians differ in gene contents from mammalian herpesviruses (McGeoch et al., 2006) and therefore were assigned to the family of Alloherpesviridae within the order Herpesvirales (www.ictvonline. org; Waltzek et al., 2009) ). Mammalian herpesviruses have been shown to use different pathways for cell entry. In addition to endocytosis, mammalian herpesviruses can enter cells via cholesterol dependent fusion at the plasma membrane (Rahn et al., 2011) . Cholesterol, a major component of lipid raft fractions in the cell membrane, has been shown to be critically important in the replication cycle of herpesviruses (Bender et al., 2003; Ren et al., 2011) and several enveloped viruses from different families (Bavari et al., 2002; Huang et al., 2011; Ren et al., 2008) . The present study provides evidence that cholesterol is also essential in the replication cycle of CyHV-3, a herpesvirus from a fish host.",

Firstly, MbCDtreatment of cells reduced the virus multiplication and synthesis of virus associated proteins in infected cells. Secondly, the effect of cholesterol removal was reversible: when cholesterol was replenished in the cell or when additional cholesterol was added to MbCD-treated cells, the virus multiplication was restored. Thirdly, MbCD treatment of cells prior to virus infection resulted in a lower virus load relative to mock-treated cells or cells treated post virus infection. Fourthly, MbCD-treatment decreased the number of virus particles released from the cells. Finally, lipids isolated from the virus envelope are similar in composition to that of the lipid raft fraction of CCB cells and dissimilar to the detergent soluble non-raft fraction.",

In particular, MbCD is widely used to study the importance of cholesterol in the infection process of several viruses (Bender et al., 2003; Chung et al., 2005; Martin et al., 2012; Ren et al., 2011) , since it captures cholesterol and removes it from the cell membrane. As a result, lipid microdomains are disrupted with concomitant blocking of biological processes that depend on them (Zidovetzki and Levitan, 2007) . Here we could show that incubation with increasing amounts of MbCD resulted in a substantial decrease of cholesterol levels in carp derived CCB cells whilst still retaining an intact monolayer of viable cells. The incubation of goldfish kidney derived macrophages with MbCD caused a shifting of flotillin-1, a protein commonly associated with lipid rafts in mammalian cells, from the lipid raft fraction to the non-lipid raft associated fraction of the membrane (Garcia-Garcia et al., 2012) . This indicates that like in mammalian cells, the incubation of fish derived cells with MbCD leads to a disruption of lipid rafts in a fashion similar to mammalian cells. At the same time, unlike other cholesterol binding agents that become incorporated into membranes, MbCD is strictly surface-acting and can be rapidly removed when cells are incubated with fresh medium. In CCB cells, the cholesterol level remained low until at least 2 h post MbCD treatment. During this period of time, a reduced entry of CyHV-3 into CCB cells and subsequent multiplication and virus protein expression was observed. The virus binding/virus entry assays indicated that cholesterol was critical for virus entry but not for binding and for the post entry stages of the replication cycle. A similar effect of cholesterol depletion was also observed in bovine herpesvirus type 1 infection of MDBK cells (Zhu et al., 2010) . The data reported here also shows that the lower CyHV-3 replication rate seen in MbCDtreated CCB cells was not an indirect result of MbCD treatment on host cell gene regulation or lipid trafficking. Interestingly, cholesterol was not shown to be required during the binding process to the plasma membrane. However, by 48 h post MbCD incubation, the cholesterol levels of CCB cells had been completely replenished and then the virus replication and spread followed a similar trend to that of the untreated infected cells.",

            "text": "During morphogenesis, CyHV-3 acquires its envelope through budding into cytoplasmic vesicles (Hanson et al., 2011; Miwa et al., 2007) . Due to the morphogenesis process, the lipid composition of the virus is therefore likely to be representative/comparative to the place where budding occurred (Vangenderen et al., 1994) . In a variety of viruses, the lipid composition is distinct from that of the host cell plasma membrane from which they are derived. This led to the assumption that viruses might bud from specific microdomains in the plasma membrane (Scheiffele et al., 1999) . In CyHV-3, this view is supported by the observation that the sequestration of cholesterol from the cell membrane hindered the egress of CyHV-3 from infected cells (current communication). In addition, annexin A2, a cellular lipid rafts-associated protein not encoded by the CyHV-3 genome (Aoki et al., 2007) , was identified in the CyHV-3 virion (Michel et al., 2010) , suggesting that this protein was derived from the cell and not produced by the virus. The lipid profile of CyHV-3 (rich in triglycerides, free fatty acids, cholesterol, monoacylglycerol and phosphatidylocholine) appears similar to the lipid raft fraction isolated from the cell membranes of CCB cells as well as from several carp tissues and differs from that of the DSM fraction. In particular when the lipid content was displayed as polar and non-polar lipids, the composition of the lipid raft fraction is significantly different when compared to the DSM fraction. Interestingly, there is no significant difference between the polar:non-polar ratio of the virus and the lipid rafts. Viruses acquire their lipid envelope directly from their immediate surrounding area, therefore the similarity between the lipid raft and virus lipid composition suggests that lipid rafts are involved in entry, trafficking and/or budding of CyHV-3. The observations on the composition of the lipid envelope, the presence of Annexin 2a in the CyHV-3 as well as the reduced release of virus particles from cells after cholesterol sequestration from the cell membrane would support the hypothesis that the CyHV-3 uses lipid rafts as a portal of exit during egress.",

As CyHV-3 is a member of the family Alloherpesviridae, which is an ancient phylogenetic diversification of herpesviruses, our data suggests that this method is probably conserved amongst all members of the larger clade of the Herpesvirales and might represent an ancient pathway. These results might have fundamental connotations for further research on the innate immune responses influencing cholesterol-rich lipid rafts, in particular studies on the antiviral effect of type I interferon stimulated proteins such as viperin, which in mammals was shown to stunt virus egress by disrupting lipid rafts in the cell membrane of infected cells (Wang et al., 2007) . Furthermore the cholesterol pathway could be a good target for effective treatment or prevention of viral infections in fish.",

Depicted is the percentage of CCB cells positive for CyHV-3 glycoprotein on 4 and 7 days post infection (dpi). No virus associated protein was detected in MbCD treated cells at 4 dpi.
