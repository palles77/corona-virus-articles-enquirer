As part of an effort to generate broad-spectrum inhibitors of these enzymes, we screened a library of inhibitors based on a halopyridinyl ester from a previous study of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) 3CL proteinase against Hepatitis A virus (HAV) 3C pro . Three of the compounds, which also had furan rings, inhibited the cleavage activity of HAV 3C pro with K ic s of 120-240 nM. HPLC-based assays revealed that the inhibitors were slowly hydrolyzed by both HAV 3C pro and SARS 3CL pro , confirming the identity of the expected products. Mass spectrometric analyses indicated that this hydrolysis proceeded via an acylenzyme intermediate. Modeling studies indicated that the halopyridinyl moiety of the inhibitor fits tightly into the S1-binding pocket, consistent with the lack of tolerance of the inhibitors to modification in this portion of the molecule. These compounds are among the most potent non-peptidic inhibitors reported to date against a 3C pro .",

As such, proteinases constitute an important target for novel antivirals. The main proteinases responsible for this processing in picornaviruses and coronaviruses are the 3C and 3C-like proteinases (3C pro and 3CL pro ), respectively. 1 Picornaviruses include important human pathogens such as human rhinovirus (HRV), poliovirus (PV), and hepatitis A virus (HAV), as well as significant insect, plant and agricultural pathogens, such as footand-mouth disease virus (FMDV). Coronaviruses include the etiological agent of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak in 2002. Given the significance of these viral pathogens, intense efforts are underway to develop novel antiviral compounds that target 3C pro s and 3CL pro s.",

In the central portion of the groove between the two domains, lie the conserved residues of a catalytic triad: the nucleophilic Cys172; the general acid-base catalyst His44; and Asp84, that forms a hydrogen bond to His44. 4 This catalytic triad is consistent with other 3C pro structures identified to date including those of PV, HRV, and FMDV. [5] [6] [7] The coronaviral 3CL pro s have a similar two-domain b-barrel fold with a third a-helical domain that plays a role in dimerization and contributes to the active site pocket. 8 Coronaviruses have an active site Cys-His catalytic dyad 9 but for both types of proteinases the catalytic mechanism is similar. Following binding of a substrate, the latter's carbonyl carbon atom of the scissile peptide bond is subject to nucleophilic attack by the sulfur atom of the active site Cys. Formation of a tetrahedral intermediate is stabilized by residues of the electrophilic oxyanion hole, and loss of the amide leads to formation of an acyl enzyme intermediate. 4 The catalysis is complete following deacylation and restoration of the active site.",

            "text": "With some exceptions, such as peptidyl aldehydes 10 and peptidyl fluoromethyl ketones, 11 many of the inhibitors of HAV 3C pro that have been developed to date are not particularly potent in their initial binding to the enzyme. Keto-glutamine analogues have been well studied as potential inhibitors. Such analogues with a phthalhydrazide moiety display initial competitive (reversible) inhibition of HAV 3C pro with the best having a K i of 9 lM. 12 Over a longer period (hours), they then alkylate the active site cysteine thiol with concomitant loss of the phthalhydrazide moiety. 13 Such compounds were improved through cyclization of the glutamine side chain, resulting in inhibitors with IC 50 s in the low micromolar range. 14 Lall et al. 15 also investigated interaction of b-lactones with HAV 3C and found a reversible inhibitor having a K i of 9 lM. Interestingly, the enantiomeric compound was an irreversible inhibitor with a k inact /K i = 3800 M \u00c01 min \u00c01 . 4 Given the similarity of the active site architectures of 3C pro and 3CL pro , it is expected that these proteinases will be inhibited by similar classes of compounds. Indeed, it may be possible to generate broad-spectrum inhibitors of these enzymes. Screening of a 50,000-member library of small molecules revealed a pyridinyl thiophene ester, 1 (Table 1) , that inhibited SARS 3CL pro with an IC 50 of 0.5 lM. 16 This compound also inhibited HAV 3C pro with an essentially identical IC 50 . More recently, a library of 82 heteroaromatic esters based on 1 was created and screened against SARS 3CL pro . 17 The most potent ester 24 (Table 2) inhibited the proteinase with an IC 50 of 50 nM. Mass spectrometric analysis suggested a mechanism of inhibition involving acylation of the enzyme by the furoyl group. Slow reactivation of the enzyme further suggested that the acyl-enzyme was subject to deacylation, and that the enzyme catalyzed the slow hydrolysis of the ester.",

This suggested that HAV 3C pro might catalyze the slow hydrolysis of the ester inhibitor. To investigate this possibility, we developed an HPLC-based assay to monitor inhibitor hydrolysis by HAV 3C pro and SARS 3CL pro . Reactions were performed using a concentration of pyridinyl ester high enough to ensure enzyme saturation. HPLC analysis of the reaction mixture demonstrated that the expected hydrolysis products could be observed in a time-dependent manner concomitant with the disappearance of the ester (Fig. 1 ) and that this hydrolysis was dependent on the enzyme. For each of the tested esters, product identification was confirmed when possible by comparison to known standards. The assay was performed at several concentrations of ester to confirm saturation of the proteinase with the ester and enzymatic hydrolysis rates were corrected for the non-enzymatic hydrolysis of the inhibitor.",

For example, 60, 66, 68 and 78 moderately inhibited HAV 3C pro at concentrations of 1 lM despite the different sizes of the cyclic acid moiety. While the cyclic acid moiety is subject to some constraints, as illustrated by compounds 65, 69, and 78, these constraints are difficult to deduce from the current data set. The spacing between the ester and alcohol or acid moiety was also more critical for the alcohol than the acid. Compound 37 was a good inhibitor despite possessing two additional carbon atoms (-CH@CH-) on the acid side of the ester with respect to 20. By contrast, the insertion of a single additional carbon atom (-CH 2 -) on the alcohol side of the ester of the potent inhibitor 24 yielded 25, a poor inhibitor. Finally, the presence and position of the halogen on the pyridine ring were important determinants of inhibition as was the position of the ring nitrogen with respect to the ester bond. Thus, compounds containing 2-or 4pyridinyls (2, 4, 11 and 13) were poor inhibitors. Similarly, compounds lacking the halogen substituent (3 vs 45) or in which this substituent is ortho or para to the es- ter group (15 and 16 vs 45) were also poor inhibitors.

First, the distance between the S c of Cys172 and the carbonyl carbon in 24 is 3.4 \u00c5 . Second, these two atoms are almost coplanar with the imidazole ring of His44. Therefore, His44 is in an ideal position to have its N e2 acting as a general base. During normal enzymatic hydrolysis of peptidyl substrates, the scissile peptide bond is expected to be in line with the spatial orientation between the Cys and His catalytic pair in the active site. However, the modeled HAV 3C pro -24 complex shows a rather different direction for the central scissile ester bond of compound 24, primarily due to the predicted strong propensity of the bromopyridinyl ring to bind inside the S1 pocket. Interestingly, a similar binding mode was predicted for the complexes between SARS 3CL pro and a group of pyridinyl ester-based inhibitors. 21 Considering the similarities of picornaviral 3C pro and coronaviral 3CL pro , it is not surprising that the library of pyridinyl esters yielded similar potent inhibitors of the HAV and SARS proteinases. 17 In particular, both enzymes are catalytically driven by a Cys-His pair and have a high specificity of Gln as the P1 residue. This specificity reflects their similar S1 pockets, especially the histidine at its base (His163 and His191 of SARS 3CL pro and HAV 3C pro , respectively) which is an important determinant of P1 specificity in both enzymes. 4, 22 Consistent with these similarities, the predicted binding mode of halopyridinyl esters to SARS 3CL pro17 is very similar to that predicted for HAV 3C pro , with the halopyridinyl moiety occupying the S1 pocket and the ring of the acid moiety extending into the S2 pocket.",

Initial inhibitor screening and IC 50 determination for HAV 3C pro were done using a 96-well plate and a Victor 2 fluorescence plate reader (PerkinElmer, Woodbridge, ON, Canada). Substrate (10 lM) and inhibitor (0.25-10 lM) were prewarmed for three minutes in black 96-well microplates in a total volume of 200 ll before the reaction was started with the addition of enzyme (k ex = 355 nm, k em = 460 nm). Determination of K i was done using a Varian Eclipse Fluorescence Spectrophotometer (Varian, Cary, NC, USA). The assay was performed using a 100 lL quartz cuvette (k ex = 340 nm, k em = 490 nm for SARS 3CL pro ; k ex = 320 nm, k em = 420 nm for SARS 3CL pro ). Initial rates were calculated using the first 3 min of the progress curve and were corrected for the inner filter effect as described by Liu et al., 23 using SND(edans)G or Abz-SVTLQ as appropriate. Steady-state equations were fitted to the initial-rate data using the least-squares and dynamic weighting options of LEONORA. 24 ",
