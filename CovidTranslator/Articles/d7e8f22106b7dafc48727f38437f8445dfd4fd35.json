The global propagation of the viral disease, denoted COVID-19 (\"coronavirus disease 2019\"), has unified the scientific community in searching for possible inhibitory small molecules or polypeptides. Given the known interaction between the human ACE2 (\"Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2\") protein and the SARS-CoV virus (responsible for the coronavirus outbreak circa. 2003), considerable focus has been directed towards the putative interaction between the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein and ACE2. However, a more holistic understanding of the SARS-CoV-2 vs. human inter-species interactome promises additional putative protein-protein interactions (PPI) that may be considered targets for the development of inhibitory therapeutics.",

In the present study, of the \u223c285,000 predicted pairs, we selected only the highly conservative set of predicted interactions for each of the 14 SARS-CoV-2 proteins resulting in the identification of 225 putative human protein targets. We publicly released these predictions and related meta-data for use by the broader scientific community in the following DataVerse repository: 10.5683/SP2/JZ77XA, [10] . The dataset of experimentally elucidated human-virus PPIs was obtained from the VirusMentha database [11] . These 10,693 known PPIs are used to train the PPI predictors and infer new putative interactions between human proteins and the SARS-CoV-2 proteome. For the all schema, the proteomes of the 43 viral families were collected from Uniprot and are summarized in the appendix Table 4 . In anticipation of the generation of the predicted interactome using the proximal schema, we tabulate the 689 training PPI and the Group IV viral families over which they are distributed (Table  1) .

That is, species for which the proteome is known, however, the the number of experimentally validated PPIs involving the proteins of this organism is insufficient to train a model to generate the comprehensive interactome. To circumvent this, the PIPE4 algorithm leverages the known PPIs of evolutionarily similar and well-studied organism, serving as a proxy training set. Using an approach denoted as cross-species PPI prediction, the experimentally validated PPIs from the proxy species are used to train the PPI predictor which is then applied to the proteome of the understudied target organism. Due to the limited availability of known SARS-CoV-2 PPIs, we here use the PPIs from a collection of well-studied and evolutionarily similar proxy viruses to generate these cross-species predictions as depicted in Figure 1 . The PIPE4 algorithm is particularly well-suited to cross-and inter-species PPI prediction schemas, given that the SW-scoring function appropriately normalizes the prevalence of sequence windows within each training and target species proteome [6] .",

SPRINT leverages a spaced seed approach for determining protein window sequence similarity, where each position in the two windows must either be identical, or do not matter, as defined by the match/don't_care bits of the spaced seeds. Furthermore, protein sequences are encoded using five bits per amino, enabling the use of highly efficient (SIMD) bitwise operations to rapidly compute protein window similarities and, thereby, score predictions [7] . Unfortunately, the present version of the SPRINT algorithm is not designed to explicitly handle inter-and cross-species prediction, nor to predict the specific subsequence site of interaction between a given pair of proteins. Nonetheless, it is among the only PPI predictors capable of predicting comprehensive interactomes in a timely manner and was demonstrated to outperform other PPI predictors, including the PIPE2 algorithm [7] .",

This presents an opportunity to develop protein-specific local decision thresholds, where only those interactions scoring significantly above baseline are reported. These one-to-all score curves are based on the underlying assumption that we expect true SARS-CoV-2 vs. human PPIs to be rare, such that the vast majority of prediction scores should fall below the decision threshold. Furthermore, by also plotting the one-to-all curves for each human protein, we can apply the same local decision logic to the reciprocal perspective (while not performed here, this analysis forms the basis of the Reciprocal Perspective method) [16] .",

In the absence of known PPIs between SARS-CoV-2 and human, it is difficult to determine a suitable global decision threshold. By instead examining the morphology of the one-to-all score curves for both perspectives, we can qualitatively identify high-scoring pairs. This process can be further automated through the identification of the baseline/knee for each view under the assumption that true PPIs are rare and high-scoring, while non-interacting pairs tend to generate scores residing below the knee in the baseline. In Figure 2 , we overlay the one-to-all score curves for each SARS-CoV-2 protein and \"zoom' into the high-score/low-rank region to emphasize that the selection of a single global top-k or score threshold would inappropriately exclude relatively high-scoring pairs within specific SARS-CoV-2 proteins, while admitting too many low-scoring putative PPI for other proteins.",

Consequently, the minimum PIPE-Site size is 20\u00d720 with the peak in the bottom-left corner. Additionally, this implementation may result in the predicted site extending past the coloured matrix, either to the right or above. This defined window size additionally prevents predictions within the terminal 20 amino acids of both sequences given that the widow sizes in these regions would necessarily be less than 20 amino acids in length. Finally, the PIPE-Sites may overlap when numerous hits appear within close proximity, as is the case when a \"band\" of hits appears in the matrix. Finally, when the peak of the landscape comprises only a few hits (generally <3) the entire landscape is predicted as a site of interaction; evidently, these should be disregarded. Therefore, when interpreting the landscapes, it is important not to solely rely on these proposed regions; they function as an initial guide, yet other high-scoring, or \"hot-spot\", regions of interest may exist in the landscape. By providing a matrix of raw scores (in the form of a space-separated .mat file), visual interpretation of the results promise to reveal notable subsequences as well as enable the application of related interaction site predictors to identify putative sites of interaction.

Interestingly, only 76% identity was observed (Figure 7) suggesting that the SARS-CoV-2 protein might have evolved to be sufficiently different from its SARS-CoV variant to render existing anti-virals ineffective.

To that end, we used the PIPE-Sites algorithm to predict the three most likely putative interaction interfaces between the Spike (P0DTC2) and ACE2 (Q9BYF1) proteins ( Figure 6 ). Note that all predicted subsequence offsets are 0-indexed. With a maximum landscape peak of 6, the PIPE-Sites algorithm identified three putative interaction interfaces: Most interestingly, certain of these region along the Spike protein appears to coincide with mismatched or gap regions along the dot plot alignment depicted in Figure 7 ). For example, upon closer investigation of the alignment around residue 420, we note six mismatches. Their proximity to a candidate region of interaction certainly warrant additional experimental investigation (Figure 7 ). While numerous inhibitory strategies exist, including the use of small molecules or small interfering RNAs, this research is most directly amenable to the design small inhibitory peptides that inhibit virus infection by preventing Spike protein-mediated receptor binding and blocking viral fusion and entry. Unfortunately, much like small peptides and interfering RNAs, peptide-based solutions are disadvantaged by their low antiviral potency.",

Consequently, additional viral-human interactions might be targeted and disrupted with the use of small inhibitory peptides or molecules. To this end, we leverage sequence-based predictors to score all possible interactions between the SARS-CoV-2 and human proteomes. For each of the 14 viral proteins, sorting the 20,366 scores (for each human protein) into a monotonically decreasing rank order enables the identification of the subset of high scoring putative interactors with that one viral protein (Figure 4A,D).",
