Single and dual fluorescence flow cytometry were used with monoclonal antibodies to bovine (Bo) CD molecules to identify lymphocyte subpopulations. Few ileal mucosal lymphocytes were present in calves at birth. However, by 1.5 weeks of age, the villi were populated with large numbers of lymphocytes, and by 3 weeks of age, the numbers had increased further. These included a prominent subpopulation of yST cells. Several subsets of y8T cells populated ileal mucosa after birth. The predominant subset coexpressed BoCD2, and a smaller subset coexpressed BoCD8. WC1 + y8T cells comprised the smallest subset. All y8T cell subsets coexpressed ACT2, a molecule expressed on activated WC1 + and WC1 -y8T cells from cattle.",

T lymphocytes that express the oB T cell receptor (TcR2) coexpress either BoCD4 (T helper lymphocytes) , or BoCD8 (T cytotoxic/suppressor lymphocytes) (Ellis et al., 1986) . y6 TcR+ (TcRl) lymphocytes comprise the third major subpopulation. TcRl+ cells are a prominent subpopulation, especially in young animals. TcRl + cells in cattle 1 week to 2 years of age can comprise 40-80% of total lymphocytes in peripheral blood and 35% of lymphocytes in spleen (Hein and Mackay, 1991; Wyatt et al., 1994) . The prominence of TcRl + cells in peripheral blood is attributable to a subset of TcRl ' cells that expresses a high molecular weight molecule (workshop cluster 1, WCl; Wijngaard et al., 1992; Cracker et al., 1993; MacHugh et al., 1993b) . The prominence of TcRl + cells in spleen is attributable to a WC1 + subset that coexpresses BoCD2 and BoCD6 (Davis et al., 1990; Sopp et al., 1991) . The WCl-subset represents a very small proportion of peripheral blood TcRl + cells, while the WC1 + subset represents a very small proportion of splenic TcRl + cells. Neither subset is well represented in lymph nodes (McClure et al., 1989; Howard and Morrison, 1994; W.D. Davis, 1994, unpublished observations) . Phenotypic heterogeneity of peripheral blood TcRl+ cells derives, in part, from the expression of the WC1 molecule as either of two monoclonal antibody (mAb) defined isoforms (MacHugh et al., 1993a) . In addition, the forms of TcRl on WC1 + lymphocytes are positive for mAb-defined determinants expressed on all TcRl molecules or expressed on subsets of the TcRl molecule (Morrison and Davis, 1991) .",

Briefly, the ileum was flushed with cold phosphate buffered saline (PBS), and several small samples of ileum were removed and snap-frozen in O.C.T. compound (Miles, Inc., Elkhart, IN) for histological evaluation. The ileum was weighed, cut into three to four pieces of approximately equal length, and each piece tied at one end. The ileum pieces were then everted to expose the luminal surface, filled with Hank's Balanced Salt Solution (HBSS) (GIBCO/BRL, Grand Island, NY), and tied at the other end. These everted pieces were incubated in capped tubes in HBSS containing 5 mM dithiothreitol (D'IT) (Sigma Chemical Co., St. Louis, MO) at 37\u00b0C for 12 min. After the incubation period, the tubes were gently inverted several times. The supematants containing dislodged epithelial cells and associated lymphocytes (IEL) were collected. The incubation and collection steps were repeated three additional times in the absence of DTI. The resulting cell suspensions were pooled.",

Because phenotypic heterogeneity is characteristic of this lymphocyte subpopulation, dual fluorescence flow cytometry was performed to identify subsets of TcRl+ lymphocytes among IEL and LPL from the three groups of calves. Fig. 4 contains dot plot showing the coexpression of molecules on TcRl+ lymphocytes recovered from villous epithelium from a 1.5week-old calf. Panel A depicts isotype control mAb. In the remaining panels, expression of TcRl is shown on the Y axis, while expression of the other molecule being examined is depicted on the X axis. Panel B shows WCl, panel C shows BoCD2, panel D shows BoCD8o, panel E shows BoCD8/3, and panel F shows ACT2. Of the TcRl+ lymphocyte subsets seen, TcRl/BoCD2+ cells comprised the largest subset, while TcRl/WCl + lymphocytes were the smallest subset. A small proportion of TcRl + cells coexpressed BoCD8a , but TcRl/BoCD8B+ cells were rare among IEL, suggesting the TcRl/BoCD8+ cells expressed the BoCD8a homodimer. No TcR 1 /BoCD4+ lymphocytes were found (data not shown). ACT2 was expressed on all of the TcRl + lymphocytes recovered from villous epithelium. All of these observations are consistent with results of others that indicate TcRl + lymphocytes in calf ileum are phenotypically different from other lymphoid compartments (Waters et al., 1995) .",

Further, the majority of TcRl + cells populate the ileum after birth. Our findings in calf ileum are similar to reports on TcRl + lymphocytes in mouse small intestine. TcRl + lymphocytes populate mouse small intestine after birth. A large increase in the number of TcRl+ and TcR2+ IEL occurs around weaning (about 3 weeks of age in mice) (Bandeira et al., 19911 .

            "text": "Very little is known of the functions of TcRl ' lymphocytes. However, they might serve as regulatory cells in intestinal immune responses. Suppression of immune responses in the intestine might be important in preventing adverse immune responses to the large number of potential antigens delivered to the intestine during food consumption. It has been suggested that ingested food proteins are presented to villous epithelial cells, rather than via M cells to organized lymphoid tissue (Kraehenbuhl and Neutra, 1992) , and that this alternate antigen presentation pathway induces suppressive T lymphocytes in intestinal mucosa (Bland and Warren, 1986) . Suppressive TcRl+ lymphocytes have been demonstrated in cattle, both in blood and in mammary gland secretions. They express ACT2, and can be either WC1 + or WC1 -. These TcRI/ACT2+ cells downregulate antigen-specific CD4+ T lymphocyte responses (Chiodini and Davis,. 1992; Park et al., 1994) . In this context, it is of interest that ACT2 is expressed on all TcRl+ IEL and LPL from birth. The presence of ACT2 on all of the TcRl+ lymphocytes in calf ileal mucosa is consistent with an immunoregulatory function for this subpopulation. This study indicates that T lymphocytes, including several subsets of TcRl+ cells, populate calf ileal mucosa after birth. This information is important because it will help provide a basis for evaluating mucosal immune responses to enteric pathogens important in young animals. The findings also suggest cattle might prove useful as a model for comparative studies on the function of TcRl cells in the mucosa.",
