Following the application of these wastes to land the potential exists for environmental contamination. Plants, soil and ultimately water courses which may subsequently be used as catchments for public water supplies may all be affected. Research attention is now being focused on this possibility, especially in the case of protozoan pathogens which may be the most important as they are often resistant to current methods used in public water treatment. In this review we highlight some of the many factors that are likely to influence the degree of pollution by their effect on both the vertical and horizontal transport of microorganisms through soil. Soil pH, temperature, the presence of plants, microbial surface properties, type of waste, soil type and soil water content and flow may all affect the rate and extent of vertical transport, with the latter two generally considered to be the most important. Lateral movement is a particular problem in soils with impermeable substrata or in waterlogged conditions and in these cases the major factors affecting movement include rainfall rate, topography of the land and the rate at which microorganisms partition into the runoff.",

It is estimated that approximately 200 million t of waste are produced by livestock in England and Wales each year (National Rivers Authority, 1992) . Cattle and sheep account for about 90% of this total with about half being voided directly onto pasture during grazing and half being collected in buildings. Although of potential value as fertiliser, these wastes pose a pollution threat due to their high biochemical oxygen demand and their ability to release nitrates and phosphates to the aqueous environment. The codes of Good Agricultural Practice for Protection of Water and Air (MAFF, 1992a,b) contain advice and recommendations to enable farmers to minimize the risk of chemical pollution. However, livestock wastes also contain large numbers of microorganisms, including many potential pathogens (Keamey et al., 1993a) and it is only recently that concern has been expressed about the possible spread of these pathogens to the human.population (Fernan-dez-Alvarez et al., 1991) . Although biological pollution is mentioned in the MAFF guidelines (MAFF, 1992a) , further research is required before detailed recommendations can be made.",

            "text": "Pathogen dissemination from livestock wastes to water supplies may occur following direct leakage to drainage systems from wastes in buildings or stores, or indirectly following the application of waste to land. In addition, the potential exists for transfer of pathogens to the water phase from faeces deposited onto pasture during livestock grazing. Depending on soil type and conditions the route from soil to water course will vary. Much of the permanent grassland in the UK is on impermeable soils which means the most likely route of pollution is as surface or sub-surface runoff. However, on more permeable soils the most likely route of pollutant transfer is down through the soil profile to land drains or ground water. Low rate sprinkler irrigation of wastes, in addition to pathogen dispersal through soil, also results in the possibility of aerosol dispersal. Undoubtedly bacteria, protozoa and viruses will all be present in aerosols but the period over which they retain viability will be largely dependent on environmental conditions. It is generally considered that to decrease the possible risk of air contamination, wastes should be dispersed when there is a low wind speed, warm bright sunlight and a relative humidity of between 40-60% (Elliott and Ellis, 1977; MAFF, 1992b) .",

Whilst some pathogens are obligate parasites and are of limited concern, others can survive saprophytically in the environment for long periods, although in some cases survival is restricted to a transmissive cyst or spore stage. Examples of some of the pathogens found in animal wastes which may cause human disease are shown in Table 1 , although in many cases it has not been conclusively proven that animals are the source of human infection. A wide range of pathogenic microorganisms are included and it is beyond the scope of this review to cover them all, some of the most important are perhaps those responsible for gastrointestinal infections and we aim to illustrate this review with selected examples of bacteria, protozoa and viruses responsible for diseases of the digestive system.",

            "text": "In the well-developed countries of Western Europe and North America where drinking water treatment facilities are designed essentially for bacterial removal, the incidence of large scale waterborne bacterial gastroenteritis is now rare. However, over the last two decades there has been increasing concern over the emergence of 'new' forms of enteritis, caused by protozoan parasites and enteroviruses (West, 1991) . These new agents of disease may be indicative of changes in agricultural practice. However, it may be that the scale of the problem in both humans and livestock has only just been realized following recent improvements in detection methods and epidemiological surveillance, or that other factors such as increased travelling abroad or changes in socio-economic conditions have changed the risk of exposure. In some cases, what was previously identified as salmonellosis or gastroenteritis of unknown cause may now be correctly identified as cryptosporidiosis. The recorded UK incidents of cryptosporidiosis and rotavirus infections of cattle (these will predominantly be of calves) over the period 1984 to 1992 are shown in Fig. 1 with corresponding numbers of salmonellosis (caused by Salmonella dublin, Salmonella typhimurium and all other serotypes) for comparison. These numbers, obtained from the Veterinary Investigation Diagnosis Analysis issued by the Central Veterinary Laboratory are probably an underestimate of the extent of the problem as they show only the number of incidents diagnosed. subsequent repeated diagnoses relating to the same incident are not included in the data and, in addition, many cases may have not been reported. However, they do illustrate that the reported incidence of cryptosporidiosis and rotavirus infections have increased although this again could result from heightened awareness rather than real increases in occurrence. The reported incidence of salmonellosis declined over the same period.",

It has been shown that organic compounds are able to compete with viruses for adsorptive sites on soil colloids (Carlson et al., 1968) , and studies have shown that waste type can influence viral transport in soil. Results obtained by Dizer et al. (1984) illustrated this by showing adsorption of virus particles from a tertiary (chemically) treated wastewater effluent to be greater than that from the corresponding secondary (biologically) treated effluent. Similarly, Lo and Sproul (1977) demonstrated that extraneous organic matter competed for adsorption sites with poliovirus. They showed that not only was viral adsorption decreased but that desorption of bound virus from silicate minerals also occurred in the presence of proteinaceous material. However, contrasting results were obtained in a study by Rees (1990) investigating the movement of faecal coliforms in soil following the application of different waste types. Whilst waste type still affected the degree of microbial movement in this case it was shown that whilst bacteria were detected in the leachate of columns treated with dirty water 1-3 h after simulated rainfall, it took twice as long for them to appear in the leachate of slurry treated columns. This may have been a result of the physical retention or binding of the bacteria within the slurry matrix.",

Traditionally, farm yard manure was composted, an aerobic process where temperatures often rise as high as 70\u00b0C and therefore the majority of pathogens were destroyed (Jones, 1980) .

More recent results (Turpin et al., 1993) indicate that Salmonella cells in soil may persist for even longer periods in a viable but non-culturable state, thus they would not be detected by traditional plate count techniques. Studies are needed to investigate if such non-culturable cells are still capable of causing disease.

Until recently cryptosporidiosis was considered rare in animals and man, and associated only with immunocompromised patients. However, research over the last decade has resulted in its recognition as an important pathogen of both animals and man. Many studies in different countries have demonstrated that C. parvum is detected in a large proportion of diarrhoeal outbreaks of cattle, sheep and pigs (Reynolds et al., 1986; Angus, 1990; Robert et al., 1991; Villacorta et al., 1991 ) . In cattle and sheep cryptosporidiosis and the associated diarrhoea is almost exclusive to young animals and thus peaks of disease outbreaks occur around lambing and calving times ( Fig. 2) . Infection with Cryptosporidium often occurs in conjunction with other enteropathogens such as rotavirus, enteropathogenic E.coli and Salmonella spp., and such multiple infections increase both morbidity and mortality rates (Angus, 1990) .",

Oocysts are excreted in large numbers (up to 1 \u00d7 101\u00b0 g-~ ) in the faeces of infected animals (Smith, 1992) and, since ingestion of as few as ten oocysts can result in disease, the potential for infection is huge. The severity of disease is governed by the immunological status of the host (Ungar, 1990) . In man, infection may occur at any age, although due to their lower hygiene levels, incidence in pre-school children is greater than in older children and adults (Grimason et al., 1990 ). (Current, 1987) . In such cases the diarrhoea may be irreversible and will ultimately result in death. Infection in the immunocompetent patient is generally less severe. Symptoms include diarrhoea, abdominal pain, anorexia, vomiting, fever and flu-like malaise. These symptoms generally last 7-14 days although general feelings of malaise and mild abdominal cramps may persist for up to a month. Symptoms generally commence 5-10 days following oocyst ingestion with excretion of infective oocysts commencing with the onset of diarrhoea, and often continuing long after disease symptoms have ceased (Ungar, 1990) .",

            "text": "Contamination of water courses with Cryptosporidium is potentially a problem because oocysts are not totally removed by current water treatment practices. The transmissive oocyst is resistant to the levels of chlorine routinely used in water treatment plants (West, 1991) and sand-bed filtration is currently the only effective method of removal (Smith, 1992) . Ozonation is currently being investigated as an alternative (Finch et al., 1993a) although the high concentrations required for effective removal may be impossible to achieve at the normal temperatures used in waste water treatment plants (Robertson et al., 1994) . The detection of cryptosporidia in both water and faecal samples relies on microscopic identification of oocysts (Smith et al., 1993) . Owing to the low numbers of oocysts in water, and the low numbers required for infection, detection relies on the filtering of large volumes of water through cartridge filters with a nominal pore size of 1/~m. Following the concentration of oocysts, samples are stained. Several methods can be used which include auramine phenol, modified Zeihl Nielson or FITC labelled monoclonal antibodies (Casemore, 1992) . In addition, differential dye inclusion by viable and dead oocysts enables viability assays to be carried out (Campbell et al., 1992) . All of these assays are time consuming and rely on identification by trained personnel. Possible alternative methods, including the use of flow cytometers to automatically sort and count monoclonal labelled preparations are therefore being investigated (Vesey et al., 1991 ; Vesey et al., 1993) ",

In support of this Rose et al. (1988) demonstrated that river water passing through an area of intensive animal farming had significantly greater levels of Giardia contamination than at its lake source outlet. Infection can occur following ingestion of as few as ten cysts (Smith, 1992) and the incubation period following ingestion of cysts prior to the onset of symptoms is generally 7-14 days (Adam, 1991) .

Whilst the solid phase of soil is comprised of organic matter, sand, silt and clay, it is the organic matter and clay particles that have the greatest effect on movement as a result of microbial adsorption to their negatively charged surfaces. Such adsorption is believed to be largely responsible for the retention of viruses in soil (Goyal and Gerba, 1979) whereas with the larger bacteria and protozoa, filtration and sedimentation are also important. Soil pore size will also significantly affect movement of bacteria and protozoa through soil although viruses, because of their small size, are less likely to be affected. Griffin and Quail (1968) investigated the role of moisture on the movement of Pseudomonas aeruginosa in soil and concluded that whilst continuous water films were a prerequisite for bacterial movement, unless the soil pores were above a certain size translocation would be severely restricted. They suggested that for rod-shaped bacteria a pore diameter of less than l-l.5/zm would severely restrict passage either by active or passive movement. It has frequently been shown that greater microbial movement occurs in coarse soils with larger pore spaces than in finer textured soils where pore sizes are significantly smaller (Bitton et al., 1974; Tan et al., 1991; Huysman and Verstraete, 1993a) . For example, Patni et al. (1984) examining the bacterial contamination of drainage water from manured land showed that the percentage of annual rainfall that percolated to depths below the drains was greater in coarse as opposed to fine textured soil, suggesting the potential for dissemination of pathogens is greater in soils of the former type.",

Macropores which include channels formed by plant roots, earthworms and other soil micro-and mesofauna, cracks caused by freeze-thaw cycles and fissures caused by soil drying will all have been removed by processes such as sieving and laboratory studies using such soil may demonstrate significantly less microbial movement than intact soil cores. For example, Smith et al. (1985) comparing movement in an intact vs. the corresponding disturbed soil showed that at least 93% of the inoculated E. coli cells were retained in disturbed soil from which the majority of channels and macropores had been removed by mixing. In contrast, in the intact cores only 21-73% of inoculated cells were retained, indicating the role of macropores in bacterial transport. Similarly, Van Elsas et al. ( 1991 ) showed greater transport of Pseudomonas fluorescens to greater depths in undisturbed soils than in those which had been repacked. This increased transport in undisturbed soil is considered to be due to water flow bypassing the main filtering effect of the soil by flowing through macropores (Thomas and Phillips, 1979; White, 1985) . Protozoal cysts, being considerably larger than bacterial cells and therefore more likely to be dependant on macropores for their transport, may be expected to show an even greater response to a lack of macropores in disturbed soils. However, repacked soil cores do have a role to play in our understanding of how factors other than soil structure, such as adsorption to the soil matrix, can affect microbial transport (Gannon et al., 1991) .",

For example, Pseudomonas spp. are known to be highly susceptible to drying conditions (Labeda et al., 1976; Wessendorf and Lingens, 1989; Hozore and Alexander, 1991) , whereas other species such as Arthrobacter and Azospirillum are relatively resistant (Labeda et al., 1976; Bashan et al., 1991 ) .

Studies by Postma et al. (1989) suggest a possible explanation for this phenomenon. In their study, maximum incorporation of Rhizobium leguminosarum cells into soil aggregates occurred when the bacterium was inoculated into soil at low water contents. As the water content at time of inoculation increased, the numbers of cells bound in stable aggregates decreased; they hypothesized that this was due to water in pores preventing penetration by the bacteria.",

The grazing activities of microphagous soil fauna may also influence the survival of pathogenic microorganisms, particularly bacteria. Dispersal may occur either by transfer on the surface of mesofauna (Ruddick and Williams, 1972) or following passage through the gut, although the viability of organisms may be affected by this process (Pedersen and Hendriksen, 1993) . Channels produced during the movement of earthworms and other organisms are also likely to affect the movement of percolating water and therefore any microorganisms it contains. The importance of earthworms in bacterial transport following slurry application was shown by Opperman et al. (1987) who demonstrated significantly greater movement of cofiforms in soil columns amended with earthworms (Eiseniafoetida) than in control columns without worms.",

            "text": "On impermeable substrata, or in saturated soils additional water may be lost through surface runoff (Moore, 1989) although in some conditions infiltration (saturated flow) or surface storage may occur. Runoff from agricultural land after natural rainfall or irrigation often reaches water courses which are subsequently used as sources for public water supplies. Consequently, when such land has been treated with animal (or human) wastes the possibility exists for the transmission of pathogens to the human population (Patni et al., 1985) . Contamination of water courses via runoff has been reported from grazed land (Doran and Linn, 1979; Jawson et al., 1982) , feedlots (Young et al., 1980) , land treated with animal manures or slurry (Thornley and Bos, 1985) and sewage treated land (Dunigan and Dick, 1980) . Many studies have illustrated the role of runoff from both grazed and waste treated land, in decreasing water quality. Results from a study by Doran and Linn (1979) comparing the bacteriological quality of runoff from a grazed vs. non-grazed area showed faecal coliform counts to be five to ten times higher from the grazed area. In a similar study Jawson et al. (1982) showed faecal coliform counts in runoff still exceeded the water quality standard up to 1 year after removal of cattle from the land, suggesting that these organisms have the ability to survive in the environment. In addition to direct pollution by farm animals, Thornley and Bos (1985) found that runoff from barnyard and manure piles resulted in drainage waters having both biological and chemical characteristics of domestic sewage, leading subsequently to an adjacent river exceeding provincial guidelines for water quality.",

Anaerobic storage in slurry holding tanks is practised and has been shown to reduce numbers of pathogenic bacteria (Kearney et al., 1993b) but again information on the survival of other pathogens under these conditions needs further investigation. Two possibilities exist for water, treatment with ozone and/or sand filtration, but again the research has yet to be completed. Thus, neither of these approaches can be relied upon in the short term, whereas a knowledge of the major factors influencing the rate and extent of movement of pathogens through farm systems and soil could at least lead to guidelines being put into place to lessen the chance of dispersal of pathogens into water.",

Paucity of information for these 'new' pathogens and for movement of the more established pathogens after direct application of livestock wastes has necessitated extrapolation from information published for other microorganisms. Of the many interacting factors influencing movement of microorganisms through soil, soil type and soil water content and flow are commonly quoted as the most important. Soil type will vary dramatically in different regions of the UK where grass or arable land is fertilised with livestock waste and consequently the filtering effect of the soil is also likely to vary significantly. Agricultural practice will also affect both the survival of microorganisms and their subsequent transport with the type of waste, the degree of soil disturbance during and after application and the presence of root crops all likely to influence the degree of pathogen dissemination. This review highlights the lack of direct information on the movement in and across soil of pathogenic microorganisms present in livestock waste following the application of the waste to land. Isolated studies, mainly with pure cultures of viruses and bacteria, have demonstrated some of the many interacting factors which are likely to influence microbial movement in soil. Results from these studies indicate the complex nature of the process, and the difficulties in trying to predict or model movement based on limited information. Detailed research using a range of conditions representative of those encountered in the field are required before accurate models or predictions which take account of the many interacting factors governing movement can be made.",
