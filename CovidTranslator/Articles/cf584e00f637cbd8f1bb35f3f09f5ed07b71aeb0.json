Here, the crystal structure of the 33.1 kDa transmissible gastroenteritis (corona)virus M pro is reported. The structure was re\u00aened to 1.96 A \u00ca resolution and revealed three dimers in the asymmetric unit. The mutual arrangement of the protomers in each of the dimers suggests that M pro self-processing occurs in trans. The active site, comprised of Cys144 and His41, is part of a chymotrypsinlike fold that is connected by a 16 residue loop to an extra domain featuring a novel a-helical fold. Molecular modelling and mutagenesis data implicate the loop in substrate binding and elucidate S1 and S2 subsites suitable to accommodate the side chains of the P1 glutamine and P2 leucine residues of M pro substrates. Interactions involving the N-terminus and the a-helical domain stabilize the loop in the orientation required for trans-cleavage activity. The study illustrates that RNA viruses have evolved unprecedented variations of the classical chymotrypsin fold.",

The name`3C-like proteinase' was introduced originally because of similar substrate speci\u00aecities of the coronavirus M pro and picornavirus 3C proteinases (3C pro ) and the identi\u00aecation of cysteine as the principal catalytic residue in the context of a predicted two-b-barrel fold (Gorbalenya et al., 1989a,b) . Meanwhile however, several studies have revealed signi\u00aecant differences in both the active sites and domain structures between the coronavirus and picornavirus enzymes (Liu and Brown, 1995; Lu and Denison, 1997; Ziebuhr et al., 1997 Ziebuhr et al., , 2000 . Also, the crystal structures reported for a number of picornavirus 3C proteinases (Allaire et al., 1994; Matthews et al., 1994; Bergmann et al., 1997; Mosimann et al., 1997) have not been useful in predicting the three-dimensional structures of coronavirus main proteinases. Because of the large phylogenetic distance between the two groups of enzymes, we will use the term coronavirus M pro throughout this article.",

In TGEV M pro , these are Cys144 and His41. There has been some debate on the existence of a third residue in the catalytic centre. In common with picornavirus 3C proteinases, the catalytic centre of the coronavirus M pro is predicted to be embedded in a chymotrypsin-like, two-b-barrel structure in which cysteine (rather than serine) serves as the principal nucleophile.

            "text": "Structure determination by MAD phasing The presence of 10 methionine residues in the TGEV M pro molecule suggested that selenomethionine-based multi-wavelength anomalous dispersion (MAD; Hendrickson et al., 1990) could be used to solve the phase problem. The unit cell dimensions of the crystals (a = 72.8 A \u00ca , b = 160.1 A \u00ca , c = 88.9 A \u00ca , b = 94.3\u00b0, space group P2 1 ) and self-rotation calculations indicated the presence of as many as six TGEV M pro molecules per asymmetric unit. In the MAD phasing process, we \u00aenally succeeded in locating 48 (out of 60) crystallographically independent selenium sites by the`Shake & Bake' approach to direct methods (Weeks and Miller, 1999) , without recourse to heavy atom derivatives or other methods of phasing (see Materials and methods). The phases obtained resulted in a readily interpretable electron density map. Quality of the model All six copies (designated A\u00b1F) of the TGEV M pro in the asymmetric unit of the crystal could be built into well-de\u00aened electron density (Figure 2) , which covered almost all of the 302 amino acid residues of each monomer. The only exceptions were the two C-terminal residues which were not visible in \u00aeve of the six chains. Monomers A, E and F also lacked electron density for residue 300. (Thompson et al., 1997) , and corrected manually on the basis of the three-dimensional structure of TGEV M pro . The corresponding sequences of FIPV (strain 79\u00b11146), HCoV (strain 229E), bovine coronavirus (BCoV, isolate LUN), MHV (strain JHM) and IBV (strain Beaudette) were derived from the replicative polyproteins of the respective viruses whose sequences are deposited at the DDBJ/EMBL/GenBank database (accession Nos: FIPV, AF326575; HCoV, X69721; BCoV, AF391542; MHV, M55148; IBV, M95169; TGEV, AJ271965). The b-strands and a-helices as revealed in the TGEV M pro crystal structure (this study) are shown above the sequence alignment (see also Figures 4 and 5). Black background colour indicates the catalytic cysteine and histidine residues. Grey background colour indicates the key residue of the S1 subsite (TGEV M pro His162) and its equivalents in other coronavirus main proteinases. Also shown in grey are the phenylalanine and tyrosine residues (TGEV M pro Phe139 and Tyr160) that are proposed to stabilize the neutral state of His162 (see text for details).",

Domain II is smaller than domain I and also smaller than the homologous domain II of chymotrypsin and hepatitis A virus (HAV) 3C pro (Tsukada and Blow, 1985; Allaire et al., 1994; Bergmann et al., 1997) . Several secondary structure elements of HAV 3C pro (strands b2II and cII and the intervening loop) are missing in the TGEV M pro . Also, the domain II barrel of the TGEV M pro is far from perfect ( Figure 4 ). The segment from Gly135 to Ser146 forms a part of the barrel, even though it consists mostly of consecutive loops and turns. In fact, in contrast to domain I, a structural alignment of domain II has proven dif\u00aecult. The superposition of domains I and II of the TGEV M pro onto those of the HAV 3C pro yields an r.m.s.d. of 1.85 T 0.05 A \u00ca for 114 equivalent (out of 184 compared) C a pairs, while domain II alone displays an r.m.s.d. of 3.25 T 0.28 A \u00ca for 57 (out of 85) C a pairs. Domain III is composed of \u00aeve, mostly antiparallel, a-helices and the loops connecting them. The crossover angles are~90\u00b0between helices B and E,~30\u00b0between B and D,~20\u00b0between C and E, and~80\u00b0between E and F, whereas C\u00b1B and B\u00b1F are parallel to each other (see Figure 5 ). Interhelical contacts are mediated by hydrophobic side chains. The loops between the helices are quite long and \u00aell up most of the interstitial space of domain III. Database searches (Holm and Sander, 1993; Gilbert et al., 1999) did not reveal other proteins or protein domains with the same topology as domain III. The N-terminal segment (residues 1\u00b15) of the polypeptide chain folds onto domain III, placing the N-terminus of the protein within 17.0 (T2.7) A \u00ca of the C-terminus ( Figure 4) .",

The distance between the sulfur atom of Cys144 and the N e2 of His41 is 4.05 (T0.04) A \u00ca , i.e. longer than the corresponding cysteine\u00b1 histidine distances in HAV 3C pro (3.92 A \u00ca ; Bergmann et al., 1997) , poliovirus (PV) 3C pro (3.4 A \u00ca ; Mosimann et al., 1997) and papain (3.65 A \u00ca ; Kamphuis et al., 1984) ( Figure 6B and C). In contrast to papain, but in agreement with the picornavirus 3C proteinases, the sulfur atom is in the plane of the histidine imidazole.

In proteinases of the papain family, an asparagine is the third member of the catalytic triad. Chymotrypsin and other members of this serine proteinase family have a catalytic triad consisting of Ser195...His57...Asp102. In HAV 3C pro , Asp84 is present at the required position, although its side chain points away from His44, making its role disputable (Malcolm, 1995; Bergmann et al., 1997) . PV 3C pro , human rhinovirus (HRV) 3C pro and HRV 2A pro have a glutamate or aspartate in the proper orientation to accept a hydrogen bond from the active site histidine (Matthews et al., 1994; Mosimann et al., 1997; Petersen et al., 1999) . In contrast, TGEV M pro has Val84 in the corresponding position, with its side chain pointing away from the catalytic site ( Figure 6B and C). A buried water molecule is found in the place that normally would be occupied by the side chain of the third member of the catalytic triad. This water molecule makes hydrogen bonds to His41 N d1 , His163 N d1 and Asp186 O d1 ( Figure 6B ). His163 is not conserved among coronavirus main proteinases and its substitution by leucine (M pro -H163L) had no signi\u00aecant effect on the proteolytic activity in the standard peptide assay (see Materials and methods), as compared with the activity of the wild-type M pro (Table I) . Asp186 makes a salt bridge to Arg40 that appears to be required to maintain the active site geometry, since both Asp186 and Arg40 are absolutely conserved among coronaviruses. Through this (and other) interaction(s), the polypeptide segment 184\u00b1199, which connects domains II and III and is probably involved in substrate binding (see below), is held in the proper position. Taken together, the data contradict a direct involvement of His163 or Asp186 in catalysis, making the TGEV M pro a clear case of a viral cysteine proteinase employing only a catalytic dyad.",

This leads us to believe that, similarly to 3C pro (Matthews et al., 1994; Bergmann et al., 1997; Mosimann et al., 1997) , speci\u00aec substrate binding by M pro is ensured by well-de\u00aened S4, S2 and S1 speci\u00aecity pockets.

The model is based on the assumption that M pro binds substrates in a manner analogous to that found in complexes of chymotrypsin-like proteinases with peptide inhibitors. X-ray structures have shown that the P4\u00b1P1 residues of peptide inhibitors assume a common main chain conformation when bound to these proteinases, with the P4 and P3 residues adopting a b conformation and the P2 and P1 residues assuming a speci\u00aec main-chain conformation suitable to place their side chains in the pre-formed S1 and S2 speci\u00aecity pockets Structure of TGEV main proteinase (James et al., 1980; Fujinaga et al., 1985 , 1987 , Matthews et al., 1999 .

            "text": "It has been shown for the HAV, HRV and PV 3C pro enzymes that the imidazole side chain of a conserved histidine, which is located in the centre of a hydrophobic pocket, interacts with the P1 carboxamide side chain of the substrate. This interaction is generally accepted to determine the picornavirus 3C pro speci\u00aecity for glutamine at P1 (Matthews et al., 1994 (Matthews et al., , 1999 Bergmann et al., 1997; Mosimann et al., 1997) . Mutational analyses revealed that any replacement of His162 completely abolished the proteolytic activities of the HCoV and feline infectious The sequence of the 15mer substrate peptide, H 2 N-VSVNSTLQSGLRKMA-COOH, was derived from the N-terminal M pro autoprocessing site (residues shown in bold indicate the scissile bond). The activity of wild-type M pro (encompassing 302 residues) was taken as 100% and the mean value of three experiments, which did not vary by more than 15%, is shown. a Proteolytic activities were determined using a peptide-based cleavage assay ; see Materials and methods). peritonitis virus (FIPV) M pro enzymes . The structure shows that the imidazole side chain of His162 is positioned suitably to interact with a P1 glutamine side chain. His162 is located at the very bottom of a hydrophobic pocket which is formed by residues Phe139 and the main-chain atoms of Ile140, Leu164, Glu165 and His171. The side chain of Glu165 forms an ion pair (2.96 T 0.14 A \u00ca ) with His171. This salt bridge is itself on the periphery of the molecule, forming part of the`outer wall' of the S1 subsite. Accordingly, mutants of the HCoV 229E M pro , in which the residue equivalent to His171 had been replaced by alanine, serine or threonine, retained signi\u00aecant proteolytic activities . In order to interact with the P1 glutamine side chain of the substrate, His162 has to maintain a neutral state over a wide pH range. Most probably, this is achieved by two important interactions: (i) stacking onto the phenyl ring of Phe139, at a distance of 3.53 T 0.18 A \u00ca ; and (ii) accepting a hydrogen bond from the buried Tyr160 hydroxyl group which has no other hydrogen-bonding partner. The role proposed for the hydroxyl group of Tyr160 is strongly supported by FIPV M pro mutagenesis studies in which the proteolytic activities of Y160F, Y160G, Y160A and Y160T mutants were shown to be dramatically reduced . Tyr160 is part of the absolutely conserved coronavirus M pro sequence signature, 160 Tyr-X-His 162 (Figures 1 and  2) , whereas Gly(Ala)-X-His is found at the equivalent sequence position in most 3C and 3C-like proteinases (Gorbalenya et al., 1989a) . Accordingly, in the 3C and 3Clike proteinases, stabilization of histidine in the neutral tautomeric state has to be ensured by other residues. Notably, in the case of PV 3C pro , this involves a tyrosine residue (Tyr138) which, however, is provided by a different part of the structure (b-strand cII; Mosimann et al., 1997) . For HAV 3C pro , other mechanisms are proposed (Bergmann et al., 1997) .",

An intermolecular ionic interaction between Arg4A and Glu286B (6.0 T 0.7 A \u00ca ) appears to play a role in positioning the N-terminal residues. Because of the 2-fold non-crystallographic symmetry (NCS), the same interaction occurs between Arg4B and Glu286A. Residues 6A\u00b18A form a short b-strand interacting with strand cII of monomer B (at Val124B). Most of the interactions between the N-terminus of molecule A and the region next to the S1 subsite of molecule B constitute a perfect \u00aet. Given the fact that the P\u00a2 residues in serine and cysteine proteinases constitute the leaving group of the cleavage reaction and, in coronavirus main proteinases, are not subject to stringent speci\u00aecity requirements, it is quite conceivable that, after autoproteolysis, the N-terminus of one monomer slides over the active site of the partner monomer and adopts the position seen in our crystal structure, i.e. with Ser1A interacting with Glu165B at the`outer wall' of the S1 subsite. This, in turn, would suggest that the dimer we are seeing corresponds to the product of the autolysis reaction and that this occurs in trans. Molecular modelling revealed that binding of the M pro N-terminus in the active site cleft of the same molecule would require remodelling of the entire N-terminal segment and beyond (residues 1\u00b113; data not shown), making cleavage in cis less likely. There is additional experimental evidence supporting these conclusions. First, dilution experiments with MHV M pro translated in vitro contradict cis-cleavage activity (Lu et al., 1996) . Secondly, the fact that, early in infection, M pro remains part of a relatively stable 150 kDa precursor protein in which it is\u00afanked by hydrophobic domains (Schiller et al., 1998) argues against rapid autoprocessing in cis. The proposed model of intermolecular selfprocessing would imply that components of the replication complex could \u00aerst be anchored to membranes (i.e. the site of RNA replication) in an uncleaved form, and only later, when the precursor proteins accumulate to high local concentrations, will M pro release itself by intermolecular cleavage, thereby triggering the complete spectrum of trans-processing reactions.",

            "text": "A speci\u00aec conformation of the N-terminal segment allows it to`squeeze' residues 1\u00b18 in between domains II and III of the same monomer and domains II and III of monomer B (see above and Figure 8 ). In this context, the N-terminus also interacts with domains II and III of its own protomer. For example, the side-chain amino group of Lys5A makes strong intramolecular hydrogen bonds with Ser110A O g of domain II (2.83 T 0.15 A \u00ca ), and with the Glu286A main chain oxygen (2.80 T 0.07 A \u00ca ), as well as with Glu291A O e1 (2.74 T 0.13 A \u00ca ) of domain III. Furthermore, the side chain of Leu3A completes a hydrophobic patch on domain III which includes Phe206A, Ala209A, Phe287A, Val292A, the C b atom of Gln295A and Met296A; these residues belong to helices B and F. All sequenced members of the coronavirus proteinase family have a hydrophobic residue in position 3, while glycine is absolutely conserved in position 2 (see Figure 1 ). The latter residue adopts the a L conformation which is easily accessible only to glycine. To investigate the functional signi\u00aecance of these interactions, a recombinant protein, M pro D1\u00b15, in which the N-terminal residues Ser1\u00b1Lys5 were removed from the M pro sequence, was expressed and tested for proteolytic activity in a trans-cleavage assay using a 15mer peptide representing the N-terminal TGEV M pro autoprocessing site. As shown in Table I , the activity of M pro D1\u00b15 was decreased to only 0.3% of the M pro activity. We conclude from these data that, indeed, residues 1\u00b15 may be critically involved in stabilizing the mutual orientation of domains II and III and thus, indirectly, in maintaining the proper orientation of the intervening loop region (residues 184\u00b1199). If this hypothesis is correct, then the deletion of domain III should have similarly detrimental effects on the proteolytic activity and, in fact, the published data (see Introduction) seem to support this conclusion. To corroborate this hypothesis further, an additional set of M pro mutants was characterized in which we used the structural information to remove domain III completely. In this approach, the probability of domain III misfolding, which might have been the cause of M pro inactivation in previous studies using randomly`truncated' coronavirus main proteinases (Lu and Denison, 1997; Ziebuhr et al., 1997; Ng and Liu, 2000) , should be signi\u00aecantly reduced. The TGEV M pro deletion mutants tested for activity comprised (i) domains I and II (M pro D184\u00b1302); (ii) domains I and II together with the entire loop region (M pro D200\u00b1302); or (iii) domains I and II combined with the loop region but lacking the \u00aeve N-terminal residues (M pro D1\u00b15/D200\u00b1 302). As Table I shows, M pro D200\u00b1302 had clearly detectable (albeit signi\u00aecantly reduced) activity (0.4% of M pro ). Similarly, the mutant M pro D1\u00b15/D200\u00b1302 had signi\u00aecantly reduced activity (0.6% of M pro ). In sharp contrast, no activities were detectable for M pro D184\u00b1302 and the active site mutant, M pro -C144A (the latter being used as a negative control). The fact that residues 184\u00b1199 proved to be indispensable for proteolytic activity supports our model of substrate binding (Figure 7) in which residues of the loop are predicted to be critically involved in the formation of a b-sheet-type structure with the substrate (see above). The data also show that an intact N-terminus and the C-terminal domain are required for full activity. The structure suggests that the additional ahelical domain III as well as the N-terminal residues help \u00aex domains II and the loop 184\u00b1199 in a catalytically competent orientation. It will be interesting to investigate whether similar mechanisms are also operating in other 3C-like proteinases with (smaller) C-terminal domains (e.g. arteriviruses and potyviruses; Ziebuhr et al., 2000; .",

Thus, calculation of the electrostatic potential (Nicholls et al., 1991) does not reveal an overall basic character of domain III, nor are there distinct patches of basic or aromatic residues (data not shown).

Also, the conserved picornavirus sequence motif, KFRDI, located between domains I and II, as well as the small helices and reverse turns that together form the RNAbinding site of HAV 3C pro (Bergmann et al., 1997) are missing in the TGEV M pro structure.",

To substitute the M pro residues Cys144 (by Ala) and His163 (by Leu), the corresponding codons were replaced in pMal-M pro by site-directed mutagenesis using a recombination-PCR method (Yao et al., 1992) . The details of the primers used for cloning and mutagenesis and the amino acid sequences of the recombinant proteins expressed and tested for proteolytic activity are given in Table I . The plasmid DNAs were transformed into E.coli TB1 cells and the recombinant proteins were synthesized, af\u00aenity puri\u00aeed and cleaved with factor Xa as described previously . The purity and structural integrity of the mutant proteins were analysed by SDS\u00b1PAGE. The control protein for this experiment, wild-type TGEV Mpro pro , was puri\u00aeed in an identical manner. Enzymatic activities of the mutant proteins were measured by using a peptide cleavage assay with a peptide substrate representing the N-terminal TGEV M pro autoprocessing site (H 2 N-VSVNSTLQSGLRKMA-COOH; letters in bold indicate the scissile bond that is cleaved by M pro ).
