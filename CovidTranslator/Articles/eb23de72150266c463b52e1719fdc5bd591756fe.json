The largest class of RNA viruses are the positivestrand RNA viruses, which package messenger-sense, single strand RNA in their virion particles. These viruses include many important pathogens such as hepatitis C virus, the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus, poten-tial bioterrorism agents, and the vast majority of known plant viruses. Nevertheless, such positive-strand RNA viruses also have beneficial uses, serving as useful expression vectors in both animals and plants [1, 2] . Among other advantages, such viruses generally have small genomes, high wild type replication and gene expression levels, and lack DNA forms to genetically transform host DNA. Vector derivatives of such viruses can provide high level expression of recombinant proteins and RNAs for many purposes including direct immunization of humans and animals, and vaccine production in plants.",

For example, insertion of foreign genes in RNA viruses as a payload for vaccine production or other directed expression often decreases the efficiency of viral genomic RNA replication and subgenomic mRNA expression for reasons that are not well understood. The degree to which viral genomic RNA replication is reduced varies with the gene inserted, is often substantial, and is not simply a function of the length of the inserted foreign sequence. Such reductions in replicative fitness not only reduce the level of gene expression but usually make the expression vector genetically unstable, since the high levels of RNA recombination in such viruses lead to the appearance of deletion variants that have lost part or all of the payload gene, and thereby gained increased replicative fitness that allows them to overgrow the starting vector ( [3] and references therein).",

These findings show that the BMV 1a RNA replication protein plays key roles in directing the form and assembly of the RNA replication complex (Fig. 1) . 1a localizes to the cytoplasmic face of the perinuclear endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane, and induces the membrane to invaginate into the ER lumen to form 50-70 nm vesicles or spherules [7] . The interiors of these ER luminal, membrane-bound spherules, which remain connected to the cytoplasm by a narrow, membranous neck, become compartments or mini-organelles for viral RNA synthesis. 1a is the sole viral factor needed to induce spherule formation. By other interactions (Fig. 1) , 1a also independently recruits viral RNA templates and 2a polymerase to these compartments, which become the sites of negative-strand RNA synthesis. Negative strand RNAs then are retained in these compartments and used as templates to synthesize new positive-strand RNA for further viral translation and assembly of new infectious virions. Thus, these replication compartments concentrate the viral replication factors and RNA templates and link successive RNA replication steps. Viral positive-and negative-strand RNA templates in these structures also are protected from nucleases [7] , suggesting that these compartments also protect potentially double stranded (ds) viral RNA replication intermediates from dsRNA-induced host defense responses including RNA interference and interferon responses [10] .",

Since 1a self-interacts [11] , these large numbers of 1a proteins may form a capsid-like protein shell to direct the formation and membrane envelopment of the spherular replication compartment. Structure and assembly of the spherular replication compartment thus appear potentially very similar to those of a budding, membrane-enveloped virion particle. In particular, BMV RNA replication complex assembly closely parallels the steps by which the reversetranscribing, replicative cores of retrovirus virions assemble and become membrane enveloped. Specifically, the functions discussed above for BMV 1a, 2a polymerase, and certain 1arecognized cis-acting signals on BMV genomic RNAs recapitulate the functions of Gag (the major capsid protein), Pol (polymerase or reverse transcriptase) and RNA packaging signals in virion assembly by retroviruses like HIV [7] . The similarities revealed bridge retroviruses, positive strand RNA viruses and dsRNA viruses, which also package RNA templates and RNA polymerase in a protein shell for replication. These and other similarities suggest that all three virus classes use related mechanisms for nucleic acid replication and may have evolved from common ancestors.",

The potent approaches of yeast genetics and the large and growing understanding of yeast molecular biology thus can be applied to studying BMV replication and virus-host interactions. Interestingly, such yeast genetic studies of BMV replication depend heavily on using engineered virus derivatives as vectors to express selectable, counter-selectable, or screenable marker genes, making colony-level yeast phenotypes dependent on viral RNA replication. In recent years, classical yeast genetics have been used to identify host genes that function in controlling BMV translation [14, 15] , selecting BMV RNAs as replication templates [16] , activating the viral RNA replication complex [17] , maintaining a lipid composition required for membrane-associated RNA replication [18, 19] , and other steps.",

Specifically, we transformed each of the yeast deletion strains with plasmids expressing BMV 1a, 2a and a BMV RNA replication template with the capsid gene replaced by a luciferase reporter gene. Luciferase expression then depended on viral RNA replication and RNA-dependent mRNA synthesis. BMV-directed luciferase expression levels in this entire collection of deletion strains were independently assayed twice, and selected strains were analyzed further with detailed assays for various viral RNAs, proteins and activities.",

Examples of some of the host genes identified and the effects of their deletion on the accumulation of viral RNA replication products are shown in Fig. 2 . Of the pool of yeast genes identified, several had previously been shown to function in BMV replication, confirming that this approach could identify relevant host genes. Yeast genes that were newly implicated in BMV RNA replication by this screen included genes in RNA, protein or membrane modification pathways, and many genes of presently unknown function. Thus, these screens identified many new host factors that affect BMV replication and implicated previously unconsidered pathways in the virus lifecycle. Further studies should determine more directly the diverse roles by which these host factors contribute to virus replication and identify additional host genes, such as essential genes not covered by this screen, that contribute to BMV replication. Moreover, since even the cellular function of many of these genes is unknown, these virus-motivated studies also should help to illuminate basic cell biology.",
