These effector pathways individually block viral transcription, degrade viral RNA, inhibit translation, and modify protein function to control all steps of viral replication.

Type II IFN consists of the single IFN\u03b3 gene product that binds the IFNGR receptor complex. IFN\u03b3 mediates broad immune responses to pathogens other than viruses. The more recently described type III IFNs include three IFN\u03bb gene products that signal via the combined IFNLR1 and interleukin-10 receptor 2 (IL-10R2) receptors. To date little is known about the type III IFNs, although they are known to regulate the antiviral response and have been proposed to be the ancestral type I IFNs 3 . Type I IFNs, which in humans comprise 13 IFN\u03b1 subtypes, IFN\u03b2, IFN\u03ba, IFN\u03b5, IFNo, IFN\u03c4 and IFN\u03b4, engage the ubiquitously expressed IFN\u03b1 receptor (IFNAR) complex that is composed of the two components, IFNAR1 and IFNAR2. The function of type I IFNs is well characterized and they are known to be essential for mounting a robust host response against viral infection. Accordingly, IFNAR-deficient mice have increased susceptibility to numerous viruses but maintain resistance to other microbial pathogens, such as Listeria monocytogenes 4, 5 . Similarly, humans with genetic defects in components of IFN signalling (STAT1, TYK2 or UNC93B) die of viral disease, with the defect in type I IFN (rather than IFN\u03b3) signalling having the more significant role 6-9 .",

Instead, many of the gene products encode pattern-recognition receptors (PRRs) that detect viral molecules and modulate signalling pathways, or transcription factors that form an amplification loop resulting in increased IFN production and protection from virus spread to limit disease. ISGs that encode promising candidates with direct antiviral activity include proteins that catalyse cytoskeletal remodelling, that induce apoptosis and that regulate post-transcriptional events, such as splicing, mRNA editing, RNA degradation and the multiple steps of protein translation, as well as subsequent post-translational modification. Indeed, several such proteins, ISG15, the GTPase Mx1, ribonuclease L (RNaseL) and protein kinase R (PKR) have been validated as antiviral effectors in studies of gene knockout mice.

The equivalent diglycine residues within this motif on ubiquitin are adenlylated and conjugated by a thiolester bond to sequential cystine residues on the E1-activating, E2-carrier and E3-ligase enzymes, before being transferred to lysine residues on protein substrates. As the ubiquitin E1 enzyme (UBE1) is unable to form a thiolester bond with ISG15, ISGylation was initially thought to require a parallel and distinct pathway 15 . However, as the counterpart enzymes that catalyse ISGylation are identified, it is becoming apparent that there is direct interplay between these two pathways. The enzyme UBE1L (ubiquitin-activating enzyme E1-like) was shown to be the specific ISG15-activating enzyme 16 . Challenging this specificity, two E2 ubiquitin carrier enzymes, UBCH6 (also abbreviated UBE2E1) and UBCH8 (also abbreviated UBE2L6) were shown to also serve as ISG15 carriers 17, 18 . Ablation of UBCH8 by RNAi suggested this as the principal ISG15 E2 carrier in HeLa cells 19 . Finally, two E3 ubiquitin ligases, HERC5 (HECT domain and RLD 5) and TRIM25 (Tripartite Motif Protein 25), have been identified to also conjugate ISG15 to protein substrates, via their respective HECT (Homologous to the E6-Ap Carboxyl Terminus) or RING (Really Interesting New Gene) domains 20, 21 . Appropriately, all enzymes identified in the ISGylation pathway are coordinately induced by IFN ( Figure 3 ). As for ubiquitylation, ISGylation is reversible and a number of enzymes that catalyse the hydrolysis of ISG15 (termed deISGylation) have been identified, including the ubiquitin-specific protease-18 (USP18, also abbreviated UBP43), USP2, USP5, USP13 and USP14 22, 23 .",

Unlike ubiquitylation, ISGylation does not drive protein degradation (regulated by K48-linked ubiquitin), but rather parallels ubiquitin's activating effects (mediated by K63-linkage). Accordingly, ISG15 has been reported to prevent virusmediated degradation of the IFN regulatory factor 3 (IRF3), thereby enhancing induction of IFN\u03b2 27 . ISGylation has also been shown to modulate the function of enzymes. An instance of this is the increased affinity of the Eukaryotic Translation Initiation Factor 4E family member 4EHP for the 5\u2032 cap structure of RNA 28 .

However, extrinsic ubiquitylation has been claimed through analysis of surface proteins on spermatozoa during post-testicular maturation 32 .

Supporting this, chimeric SV expressing ISG15 are protected from the otherwise lethality of the wild-type viral infection in Ifnar1-/-mice. Compellingly, this rescue effect was dependent on the integrity of the conserved LRLRGG residues at the C-terminus of ISG15 35 . Confounding these reports, a similar chimeric ISG15-SV did not rescue the same Ifnar1-/-mouse, as reported by another laboratory. However, the recombinant SV construct did provide modest protection in vitro 36 . Ablation of the deISGylation enzyme, USP18, in mice increased resistance to virus infection, notably VSV. However, the expected reciprocal sensitivity to VSV is not apparent in either the Isg15-/-or Ube1l-/-mice 37 . However, Isg15-/-mouse embryonic fibroblasts were more susceptible to VSV infection, although this sensitivity was lost after IFN treatment, suggesting circulating IFNs in vivo may obscure some viral resistance mechanisms 27 . Other in vitro experiments support a role for ISG15 in mediating resistance to Ebola virus, via ISGylation of the E3 ubiquitin ligase NEDD4 (Neural Precursor Cell Expressed, Developmentally Downregulated-4), thereby preventing subsequent ubiquitylation 38 . Similarly, HIV-1 Gag and Tsg101 ubiquitylation is inhibited by ISG15 39 . Both NEDD and Gag/Tsg101 ubiquitylation mediate virion release from cells. Further corroboration of an antiviral role for ISG15 comes from the identification of viral proteins that have evolved to target different steps in ISGylation. The Nonstructural protein-1 (NS1) of the influenza B virus binds ISG15 to block ISGylation 16, 40 . Finally, a number of viral proteases from SARS coronavirus, crimean-congo hemorrhagic fever virus, equine arteritis virus, porcine respiratory and reproductive syndrome virus, and SV have been identified to mediate deISGylation 41-43 .",

RNA degraded by RNaseL is able to activate the other cytoplasmic PRRs RIG-I and MDA5 (melanoma differentiation-associated gene 5) resulting in IFN gene induction.

OAS2 produces four alternatively spliced transcripts that encode two proteins of 69 and 71 kDa. OAS3 encodes a single transcript that produces a 100 kDa protein. These proteins have considerable homology to each other, with OAS1, OAS2 and OAS3 encoding one, two and three, respectively, 'OAS' domains ( Figure 2 ). The most distinctive of the OAS proteins is OASL. Two OASL transcripts are expressed producing two proteins of 30 and 59 kDa. The higher molecular weight OASL contains a putative nucleolar localization signal (RKVKEKIRRTR) at its C-terminus that, probably, accounts for its unique (from the other OAS isoforms) distribution in the cell. The OASL protein also has an OAS domain, however, mutations at key residues disable the catalytic function of this human protein. Interestingly, one of the two mouse homologues retains its 2\u2032, 5\u2032-polymerase activity. In addition to the OAS domain, OASL has a unique 160 amino acid C-terminus that encodes a ubiquitin-like domain that is homologous to ISG15. Accordingly, OASL becomes conjugated (ISGylation) to cellular proteins following the treatment of cells with type I IFNs 71 .",

PKR belongs to a small family of protein kinases that respond to environmental stresses to regulate protein synthesis (the other members are EIF2\u03b1K1 (eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2\u03b1 kinase 1; also known as HRI), EIF2\u03b1K3 (also known as PERK) and EIF2\u03b1K4 (also known as GCN2)). Members of this kinase family phosphorylate the translation initiation factor EIF2\u03b1 at serine residue 51, resulting in sequestration of the limiting guanine nucleotide exchange factor EIF2\u03b2 88 . This prevents recycling of GDP, halting translation, to allow the cell to reconfigure gene expression. Much of the antiviral and antiproliferative activities of PKR can be attributed to its phosphorylation of EIF2\u03b1. Moreover, structural determination of the complex of EIF2\u03b1 and PKR argues against the existence of alternative substrates 89 . However, there is extensive biological and biochemical evidence for alternative PKR targets, although the consequences of PKR phosphoregulation of other proteins have not been well characterized. As well as directly regulating proteins by phosphorylation, PKR evokes cellular responses by modulating cell-signalling pathways (discussed below).",

The significance of this ability of RNaseL to induce apoptosis has been exemplified through genetic analysis that identified a polymorphism (R462Q) that was associated with reduced enzyme activity and increased incidence of prostate cancer 123 . Intriguingly, this SNP was subsequently associated with a putative oncolytic xenotropic murine leukaemia-related virus 124 . Other nonviral functions of RNaseL are implied in experiments that show delayed skin-graft rejection in RNaseL-deficient mice 125 . A polymorphism identified in OAS1 has also been associated with type I diabetes, which is consistent with a viral aetiology for this disease 126, 127 . Given that PKR modulates several signalling pathways, a wider function than determined solely by regulation of translation would be expected. As mentioned, PKR is required for TLR4-mediated apoptosis in macrophages. Although PKR-mediated apoptosis is in part attributable to inhibition of translation through EIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation, alternative signalling via IRF3 is also important 101 . PKR also promotes degradation of the inhibitor I\u03baB, thereby activating the potent transcription factor NF-\u03baB 128 . Regulation of NF-\u03baB accounts for the diminished NADPH oxidase 2 (NOS2) and IFN\u03b2 expression in PKR-deficient cells 129 . Additionally, PKR was shown to be required for LPS-induced STAT inflammatory signalling 130 . There is also a defect in IFN-induced phosphorylation of serine 727 in STAT1 131 , which is shown to be necessary for the basal expression of caspase-3. Accordingly, PKR-deficient fibroblasts are variably resistant to apoptosis induced by different stimuli, including dsRNA, LPS and TNF 132 . Conversely, over expression of PKR in NIH3T3 fibroblasts sensitises them to apoptosis 103 . PKR may also influence the adaptive immune response by negatively regulating CD8 + T-cell function, as PKR-deficient mice have increased contact hypersensitivity responses and stimulus-dependent T-cell proliferation 133 . PKR has also been implicated in IgE class switching in B cells. This points to a mechanism by which viral infection may induce IgE-mediated disorders, such as allergy and asthma 134, 135 . Surprisingly, these signalling events are not wholly mediated by direct phosphorylation by PKR, suggesting that the kinase acts as a scaffold to bridge signalling pathways from alternative PRRs 136 .

            "text": "IFN action is mediated via three receptor complexes: heterodimers between IFNAR1 and IFNAR2 bind type I IFNs; IL10R2 associates with IFNLR1 to bind the three IFN\u03bb; and a tetramer consisting of two IFNGR2 receptor chains with two IFNG1 receptor chains binds dimers of the type II IFN\u03b3. Signal transduction is initiated by pre-associated Janus tyrosine kinases (JAK1 and TYK2), which phosphorylate the IFNAR1 receptor chain enabling recruitment and phosphorylation of the Signal Transducers and Activators of Transcription (STATs). STAT heterodimers associate with the IFN regulatory factor 9 (IRF9) forming the IFN-stimulated transcription factor (ISGF3), or STAT homodimers form the IFN\u03b3 activation factor (GAF). These complexes translocate to the nucleus to induce IFN-stimulated genes from ISRE or GAS promoter elements, for type I and III, or type II IFN responses, respectively. Divergences from this simplified signalling pathway occur, for instance, type I IFNs are reported to elicit STAT homodimers, and more complicated interplay, with activation of other STAT proteins, occurs than is shown here. Accordingly, the C-terminal UBL is sufficient for activation and transfer to E1 and E2 enzymes. However, the N-terminal UBL appears necessary for, E3-mediated, conjugation to protein substrates. b | Domain structure of the large GTPase MxA. The distinguishing features of the dynamin protein family are the large GTP-binding domain (DTNC) that contains three consensus GTP-binding elements (not indicated) and a self-assembly sequence (SAS), the central interactive domain (CID), and the C-terminal leucine zipper (LZ, also called a GTPase effector domain). The LZ region contains a coiled coil domain at its C-terminus that forms bundles of \u03b1-helices involved in protein-protein interactions. c | Domain structure of OAS proteins and RNaseL. The OAS1, OAS2, OAS3 proteins contain 1, 2, or 3 copies, respectively, of the OAS domains. Duplicated OAS domains within OAS2 and OAS3, and the single domain in OASL are catalytically inactive (indicated by hatched lines). The C-termini of all the OAS proteins are variable, with OASL also encoding a unique ubiquitin-like domain (UBL). The OAS domain produces 2\u2032, 5\u2032-oligodenylates that activate RNaseL. RNaseL has eight Nterminal ankyrin repeats (ANK), which mediate protein-protein interactions, and two kinaselike domains, a Ser/Thr/Tyr kinase (STYLc) and a PUG domain found in some kinases, and a number of other nuclear proteins. However, neither domain has functional kinase activity. d | Domain structure of PKR. PKR contains a repeated RNA-binding motif (RBM), which together constitute the N-terminal RNA-binding domain (RBD). Upon binding of viral RNA, steric ISG15, with the primary activating E1 enzyme UBE1L, and with multiple E2-carrier enzymes (shown here as an example is UBCH8), and E3-ligase enzymes (shown here as an example is HECT5) are coordinately induced by IFN via ISRE sequences in their respective gene promoter regions. E1, E2 and E3 proteins sequentially catalyse the conjugation of ISG15 to numerous protein substrates to modulate pleiotropic cellular responses to inhibit virus production. This process (ISGylation) is reversibly regulated by proteases (shown here as an example is USP18), which are also induced by IFN. OAS is expressed at low constitutive levels and is induced by type I IFNs. The protein accumulates in the cell cytoplasm as inactive monomers. Upon activation by viral dsRNA the enzyme oligomerizes to (in the instance of OAS1) form a tetramer that synthesizes 2\u2032, 5\u2032oligodenlylates that, in turn, activates the constitutively expressed inactive RNaseL. Binding of 2\u2032, 5\u2032-oligodenlylates to RNaseL triggers dimerization of enzyme monomers, via their kinase-like domains, which then cleaves cellular (and viral) RNAs.",

PKR is activated directly by viral RNAs, as well as a number of other ligands, such as cerimide or the protein activator PACT. Upon activation PKR monomers are phosphorylated and dimerize to form the active enzyme. Activated PKR regulates a number of cell signalling pathways via mechanisms which have not been fully explained, but a critical function of PKR is the inhibition of translation via phosphorylation of eIF2\u03b1.",
