We used our existing DNA diagnostic signature prediction pipeline, which selects regions of a target species genome that are conserved among strains of the target (for reliability, to prevent false negatives) and unique relative to other species (for specificity, to avoid false positives). We performed simulations, based on existing sequence data, to assess the number of genome sequences of a target species and of close phylogenetic relatives (near neighbors) that are required to predict diagnostic signature regions that are conserved among strains of the target species and unique relative to other bacterial and viral species. For DNA viruses such as variola (smallpox), three target genomes provide sufficient guidance for selecting species-wide signatures. Three nearneighbor genomes are critical for species specificity. In contrast, most RNA viruses require four target genomes and no near-neighbor genomes, since lack of conservation among strains is more limiting than uniqueness. Severe acute respiratory syndrome and Ebola Zaire are exceptional, as additional target genomes currently do not improve predictions, but near-neighbor sequences are urgently needed. Our results also indicate that double-stranded DNA viruses are more conserved among strains than are RNA viruses, since in most cases there was at least one conserved signature candidate for the DNA viruses and zero conserved signature candidates for the RNA viruses.",

We face challenging decisions as to how limited sequencing resources should be allocated. We have built a system to evaluate sequencing needs using simulations and random sampling of existing sequence data. When some sequence data are already available, the results indicate whether additional target species genome sequences or genome sequences of close phylogenetic relatives (i.e., near neighbors [NNs] ) are required to predict high-quality DNA signatures for target detection. In addition, patterns observed in existing sequence data for classes of viruses (single-or double-stranded, RNA or DNA, positive or negative sense) may guide initial investments for unsequenced pathogens. Since we have built a dynamic system, not only a one-time analysis, it is possible to do real-time, automated evaluation concerning whether additional target or NN sequencing may still be warranted or if diminishing returns may have been reached. This is the first such system, to our knowledge, designed to address these issues. The system applies Monte Carlo simulation, which is a general method using stochastic techniques, based on the use of random numbers and probability statistics.",

This pipeline selects regions of a target genome that are both conserved among strains (to prevent false negatives and low reliability) and unique relative to other species (to preclude false positives and low specificity). We use multiple sequence alignment algorithms to generate a consensus sequence of conserved bases among strains. We have assembled an approximately 1-Gb database of viral and bacterial fullgenome sequences for assessing uniqueness. Suffix tree algorithms facilitate the creation of a \"consensus plus uniqueness gestalt,\" or simply the \"gestalt,\" of sequence fragments unique in the target consensus relative to everything in the database (5, 9) . In this gestalt, all bases that are not conserved and/or not unique are represented by dots, and the remaining sequence fragments may be mined for diagnostic signatures. The DNA signature pipeline then identifies regions suitable for a platform-specific assay; in most cases we predict TaqMan signatures composed of two primers and an internal probe. When these signature candidates are destined for laboratory screening, they undergo rigorous in silico screening against the Gen-Bank nonredundant database (a huge sequence database [1] ), and, when appropriate, human genomic data, to guard against cross-reaction with nontarget organisms. In addition, signatures to be screened in the laboratory are annotated as to whether they are intergenic or land on genes, particularly genes of interest such as those associated with virulence. Our pipeline is limited by the amount of sequence data available.",

NNs were organisms that were in the same family a To objectively select a minimum number of target and NN sequences required for development of high-quality DNA diagnostic signatures, we selected the following: (i) the (t, n) pair with the minimum number of target sequences for which the 75% quantile of results from random Monte Carlo simulations was less than or equal to c \u03e9 20, where c is the number of signature candidates when the full data set is used; and (ii) the (t, n) pair with the minimum number of NN sequences for which the 75% quantile was less than or equal to c \u03e9 20. Thus, if only t target strains and n NNs had been sequenced, one would have a 75% certainty of predicting no more than 20 poor candidates out of the total candidates generated, which would have been eliminated computationally if all currently existing sequence data had been used in the predictions.

In contrast, as the number of target sequences increases, the number FIG. 1. Range plot for plum pox virus, displaying results typical of many viruses. To discriminate samples in which zero NNs were used, the range is drawn as a horizontal grey line, and when n is \u03fe0, the range is drawn as a black line. The best estimate of the true value is the quality measure determined using the entire target and NN pools and is represented by a vertical black line. This best estimate plus a constant c of 20 is at the location of the vertical dashed line and was selected to indicate a reasonable distance from the true answer. The 75% quantile for each range is shown with a black, vertical tick mark.",

As the size of the NN set grows, regardless of the number of targets, the range of the number of signature candidates shrinks and moves toward fewer signatures. This triangular pattern suggests that NN sequences factor prominently in identifying regions of the genome that are unique to the target species. In fact, conservation among strains of variola and among strains of vaccinia enabled us to generate a reasonable list of signature candidates with only a single target sequence, as long as four NN sequences were available to eliminate nonunique regions (Table  1 ). NN sequences also facilitated signature generation for other double-stranded DNA viruses but not nearly to the extent as for variola and vaccinia. Human adenovirus B was the only double-stranded DNA virus for which NNs did not improve signature prediction. Thus, there is a general pattern that NN data aids in signature prediction for double-stranded DNA viruses, but this is not a rule.",

For both these species, additional sequences after the first target provide no guidance as to signature prediction. Because sequenced isolates are so closely related, any single target provides virtually the same information for the purpose of generating detection signatures. The second point clearly illustrated in Fig. 3 is that there are no close NNs currently sequenced to reduce the pool of candidates. Currently, we have a severe need for sequence from close NNs of SARS and Ebola Zaire to narrow the pool of signature candidates to those least likely to generate false positives in the field. For Ebola Zaire, neither Ebola Reston nor Marburg virus, currently the most closely related organisms for which we have sequence data, are sufficiently similar to rule out signature candidates that might cross-react in the field.",

These analyses indicate that sequencing three or four strains of most RNA viruses will highlight the regions that are least conserved and thus are inappropriate regions for DNA-based detection signatures. The remaining, more-conserved sequence regions may then be mined for detection signatures, whether a single signature or several signatures are required to detect all strains. In some cases where strains cluster into types, the distinction between types and species may be subjective along a continuum. In these situations, typespecific signatures may be a more appropriate goal than species-specific signatures, particularly if types differ in virulence.",

This is the case for variola and vaccinia, due to the low mutation rate for orthopox viruses and the similarity of species in this genus. We are in the process of analyzing sequencing needs to develop diagnostic signatures for bacteria, and preliminary results indicate that variola and vaccinia may be more similar to bacteria, with their much larger genomes, than to other viruses in terms of the requirement for NN sequence data. Indeed, the variola and vaccinia genome sequences are an order of magnitude longer than those of the other viruses with sufficient sequence data for our Monte Carlo methods. Conservation does not depend on sequence length alone, however, as illustrated by JC virus, the shortest of the double-stranded DNA viruses we examined at approximately 5,000 bp, and with a huge number of sequenced genomes (Table 1) . Although no single signature was present in all genomes, other analyses (data not shown) indicate that there are 23 TaqMan signature candidates that are shared among at least 75% of the 187 JC genomes. Thus, for this short virus, there is relatively high sequence conservation. In sum- on March 20, 2020 by guest http://jcm.asm.org/ mary, our results indicate that double-stranded DNA viruses are more conserved among strains than are RNA viruses, since in most cases there was at least one conserved signature candidate for the DNA viruses and zero conserved signature candidates for the RNA viruses. Sequences for SARS and Ebola Zaire are unusually conserved compared to other RNA viruses because all the sequenced isolates originate from a geographically limited area and have been sampled in a relatively short period of time, thus leaving short opportunity for strain divergence. With time and geographic isolation, strain diversity will become more important, but at this time no further sequencing of SARS and Ebola Zaire isolates are necessary for developing diagnostic signatures for these species. Instead, sequencing of close phylogenetic relatives of these species is urgently needed.",
