            "text": "Electron microscopy of cells infected with strain Beaudette indicated that virus release occurred by at least two distinct mechanisms. A small number of virus particles were enveloped individually by thickened portions of the endoptasmic reticutum which formed rounded vesicles (Fig. 4a, b) . These vesicles, with a diameter in the range 90--180 nm, resembled those associated with incoming particles and often exhibited small exterior spicules. Vesicles with thickened membranes were seen in infected cells throughout the cytoplasm both empty and containing virus particles, and empty vesicles were also present in uninfected cells. The observations of vesicles at cell boundaries suggested that, after formation in the endoplasmic reticulum, the vesicles moved to the cell surface where they could be seen fused with the plasma membrane (Fig. 4c, d) . Since this mechanism is the reverse of micropinocytosis it was important to establish in which direction the vesicles at the cell surface were moving in order to distinguish outgoing particles from already released progeny virus re-entering the monolayer in a secondary cycle of infection. That infection or re-infection of cells occurred for a considerable time (at least ten hours) after inoculation was evident from the continued phagocytosis of virus particles (Fig. 5) . As a rule it was not possible to judge the direction of movement for vesicles opening onto the exposed cell surface (i. e. away from the substrate) since the large amount of extracellul~r virus seen close to the surface prevented unambiguous interpretation. However, virus release by reverse micropinocytosis could be demonstrated for thickened vesicles opening into regions of the monolayer in which different cells were in close contact. In this ease virus particles could be seen to have been effectively trapped in the narrow (Fig. 6a, b) . The majority of virus particles remained within the endoplasmic retieulum and were seen later in infection in large cytoplasmic vacuoles, many of which were apparently formed by dilation of the eisternae. The size of the vacuoles was not related to the number of enclosed virus particles and many vacuoles were empty (Fig. 7) ; control cells often contained large numbers of empty vacuoles. There was evidence to suggest that the -\u00a2acuoles fused with each other (Fig. 7) but with strain Beaudette there was no observation of fusion with the plasma membranes.",

The majority of progeny virus particles appeared to be released by cell lysis.

The presence of spikes on budding particles was also established and this observation demonstrates the early attachment of at least some of these subunits during virus formation.

The electron micrographs indicate that IBV was able to enter CK cells by two distinct mechanisms both of which may be classified as viropexis. Although we did not observe any morphological evidence of uncoating, no other means of entry was detected and we assume that viropexis initiates infection. The mechanism by which the majority of particles entered the cells involved engulfment of the virus, and cell debris present in the inoculum, by surface processes or pseudopodia to form phagocytic vacuoles. The second method involved the uptake of individual particles by micropinocytosis. The thickened membrane forming the enveloping invagination can be identified with the modified or 'coated' merebrane characteristic of the transport vesicles present in many cell types (13, 7) . Virus entry by micropinocytosis and subsequent association with coated vesicles has not been described previously for coronaviruses but has been observed in L cells infected with a rhabdovirus, vesicular stomatitis virus (14) , and in HeLa cells infected with type 5 adcnovirus (5).",

However, the envelopment of virus particles by coated vesicles and their subsequent release from the cells by reverse mieropinocytosis are phenomena not previously described for any virus. This mechanism may be peculiar to those members of the coronaviru s group which bud into the cisternae of the endopl~smic reticulum since the particles are formed within the membranes from which the coated transport vesicles are produced (t4). In this respect our failure to observe any association of 'T' strain virus particles with coated vesicles may be significant since this strain was seen to bud predominantly into cytoplasmic vacuoles. The method of release of virus particles by fusion of vacuoles with the cell plasma membranes seen in 'T' strain infected cells appears similar to the process described for coronaviruscs from human respiratory infections (12) .",

Although infectious particle release was not measured in the present study, ALEXANDER and COLLI~S (i) have demonstrated release of infectious virus, measured as PFU, from CK cells infected with approximately 5 PFU of IBV strain Beaudette per cell. The maximum titre of released virus was reached 12--14 hours after inoculation, at a time when light microscopy of the infected cells revealed cytopathie effect in the form of small syncytia, but no obvious cell death or lysis had occurred. In their study the maximum titre represented a total infectious particle production of 10--20 PFU per cell (ALs~XA~DER, unpublished). This tow total and the failure to detect an increase in the rate of infectious particle release late in infection would suggest that the majority of particles seen in our thin sections were non-infectious. Similarly, observations on human coronaviruses grown in tissue culture have shown a lack of correlation between the infectivity titres and the large numbers of particles seen by electron microscopy (12) . While it is tempting, in the ease of strain Beaudette, to correlate the number of released infectious particles with the frequency of virus release from coated vesicles in our work, clearly further study is required to show more exactly the relationships between the different methods of particle release and the production of infectious virus.",
