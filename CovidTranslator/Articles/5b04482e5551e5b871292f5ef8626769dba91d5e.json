            "text": "This paper describes mapping of antigenic and host-protective epitopes of infectious bronchitis virus proteins by assessing the ability of defined peptide regions within the S1, S2 and N proteins to elicit humoral, cellmediated and protective immune responses. Peptides corresponding to six regions in the S1 (Sp1-Sp6), one in the S2 (Sp7) and four in the N protein (Np1-Np4) were synthesized and coupled to either diphtheria toxoid (dt) or biotin (bt). Btpeptides were used to assess if selected regions were antigenic and contained B-or T-cell epitopes and dt-peptides if regions induced an antibody response and protection against virulent challenge. All S1 and S2 peptides were antigenic, being recognised by IBV immune sera and also induced an antibody response following inoculation into chicks. Three S1-and one S2-bt peptides also induced a delayed type hypersensitivity response indicating the presence of T-cell epitopes. The S2 peptide Sp7 (amino acid position 566-584) previously identified as an immundominant region, was the most antigenic of all peptides used in this study. Two S1 (Sp4 and Sp6) and one S2 peptide (Sp7), protected kidney tissue against virulent challenge. From four N peptides located in the aminoterminal part of the N protein, only one, Np2 (amino acid position 72-86), was antigenic and also induced a delayed type hypersensitivity response. None of the N peptides induced protection against virulent challenge. The results suggest that the S1 glycoprotein carries additional antigenic regions to those previously identified and that two regions located in the S1 and one in the S2 at amino acid positions 294-316 (Sp4), 532-537 (Sp6) and 566-584 (Sp7) may have a role in protection.",

            "text": "Infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) is a commonly occurring, economically significant pathogen of commercial poultry [5] . Chicks of all ages are susceptible to infection. In young chicks respiratory disease and nephritis lead to mortality, reduced weight gain and condemnation at processing, whereas in adult birds there is a reduction in egg production. Since IBV is endemic on all commercial poultry sites, flocks are vaccinated throughout production life with live and inactivated IBV vaccines. However, outbreaks of infectious bronchitis still plague the industry due to the continual emergence of variants. It is speculated that the intensive use of live, often multiple vaccines, contributes to the emergence of variants through mutations and recombination [20, 22] . For that reason attempts have been made over the last two decades to develop alternative vaccines, such as subunit vaccines [16, 33, 34, 37, 38] . Such vaccines would allow the use of only the part of the IBV protective antigen, enabling vaccination against multiple serotypes by one vaccination.",

            "text": "Infectious bronchitis virus is a species within the family Coronaviridae. The genome of IBV consists of a positive single strand RNA, 27.6-kilo bases in length [3] . The genome encodes four structural proteins, the spike glycoprotein S (180 kDa), membrane glycoprotein M (26-34 kDa), the nucleocapsid protein N (50 kDa) and a small membrane glycoprotein. The S glycoprotein (approximately 1145 amino acids in length) consists of the amino-terminal S1 (approximately 520 amino acid residues) and carboxy-terminal S2 (approximately 625 amino acid residues) generated during post-translational cleavage of S. The S1 and S2 associate to form the viral envelope in which S1 is exposed on the virion surface, anchored by S2 [11] . The S1 glycoprotein induces protection against virulent challenge [6, 14, 16] and consequently S1 has been targeted to determine relevant differences between vaccines and emerging strains. However, S1 is highly variable [7, 8] and sequence comparisons between vaccines and variants have failed to identify region responsible for the induction of protection. Antigenic characterisation of S1 has been hindered by its highly conformational nature and the uncertainty as to whether humoral or cell-mediated immune (CMI) responses are the primary mechanism of protection. To date, focus has been on mapping regions in S1 that induce antibody responses [8] . The S1 glycoprotein induces virus neutralising and cross-reactive ELISA antibodies and CMI responses [14, 15] . Five antigenic sites that induce virus neutralising antibodies have been mapped within the hyper-variable region of S1 at amino acid residues positions 24-61 and 132-149 and also outside the hyper variable region at 291-398 [17-19, 21, 25, 26] . All regions identified were conformation dependent [17, 24] with monoclonal antibodies having been the main tool used in mapping antigenic epitopes on S1.",

As shown, sera of chicks immunised with various classical IBV strains reacted with all S-bt peptides, with significant titres detected against Sp2-, Sp3and Sp7-bt. The titres against Sp7-bt were the highest (3,200-6,400) approaching those detected against whole VicS antigen (6,400-12,000). Sera to all IBV strains, regardless whether raised against classical or variant strains, reacted with Sp2-bt and Sp7-bt indicating that these two epitopes are broadly cross-reactive. Of the four N-bt peptides, only the Np2-bt reacted with IBV immune sera ( Table 2) .",

            "text": "The region represented by Sp7 (amino acid positions 566-584), located at the amino terminal end of the S2 glycoprotein, was consistently the most antigenic. High antibody titres against this epitope were detected in IBV immune sera and Sp7-dt also induced the highest antibody response following immunisation. The Sp7 induced antibodies were also detected in immunoblotting, indicating that it is a conformation-independent and presumably linear epitope. These results are in agreement with previously published observations [21, 24] showing that the same region expressed in E. coli was antigenic, conformation-independent, and gave rise to cross-reactive antibodies. We have also shown that the Sp7 region induces a DTH response and thus carries a T-cell epitope. It has been speculated that immunodominance of the S2 region corresponding to Sp7 is the result of its location in the mature virion, being in the stalk of peplomer S [10, 11] .Additionally that surrounding regions contribute to Sp7 presentation further enhancing its antigenicity and immunodominance [10] . It was observed in this study that in immunoblotting Sp7 sera reacted strongly with the S and weakly with the S2. This was also the case with VicS antisera. We speculate that un-cleaved (or undissociated) S is present in VicS virus [4] and since the presentation of Sp7 epitope is more favourable in the whole S than in the S2 alone, a stronger reactions is detected in immunoblotting between Sp7 antisera and the peplomer S, then between Sp7 antisera and the S2 subunit.",

Protection was not complete as only kidney, but not tracheal tissues, were protected. Previous results showed that immunisation of chicks with the purified S1 provided protection of the kidney but not the trachea [14] . From the S1 sequence comparisons and cross-protection data it was expected that Sp5 and Sp6 might be involved in protection, whereas Sp1, Sp2 and Sp4 would not. The prediction held true for the Sp6 region (amino acid position 532-537) but not for Sp5. It was surprising that Sp7 provided protection since the S2 glycoprotein of IBV was shown not be involved in protection [6] . However, a synthetic peptide corresponding to the carboxyl-terminal end of the E2 peplomer (residues 993 to 1009) of murine hepatitis virus, a neurotropic coronavirus, induced protection against virulent challenge and protection was correlated with the presence of antibodies [35] . The Sp7 peptide induced a high level of antibodies and this could have contributed to clearance of challenge virus. Currently it is uncertain whether humoral or CMI responses have a role in protection. In this study there was no correlation between antigenicity of an epitope, its ability to induce DTH response, conformation requirements and protection. Sp6 and Sp7 induced a DTH response whereas Sp4 did not, however all three provided protection.",

However the Np2 region, in spite of being antigenic, was not involved in protection.
