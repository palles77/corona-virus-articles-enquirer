            "text": "We evaluated the usefulness of a serum Aspergillus PCR assay for the diagnosis and prognosis of invasive aspergillosis in a study involving 941 patients for a total of 5146 serum samples. Fifty-one patients had proven/probable aspergillosis. We compared galactomannan (GM), PCR and mycologic analysis of pulmonary samples in both neutropenic and nonneutropenic patients. PCR performed in serum yielded 66.7% sensitivity, 98.7% specificity, 75.6% positive predictive value and 98.0% negative predictive value, while the GM index yielded 78.4% sensitivity, 87.5% specificity, 27% positive predictive value and 98.6% negative predictive value. The inclusion of PCR in the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) and the Mycosis Study Group (MSG) mycologic criteria permitted the reclassification of nine other cases from possible to probable aspergillosis and increased the sensitivity to 71.7%. Combining the GM index with serum PCR increased the detection rate of invasive aspergillosis with 88.2% sensitivity. PCR was systematically negative in 16 patients with noninvasive forms of aspergillosis (namely aspergilloma and chronic aspergillosis). Remaining PCR positive after a period of 14 to 20 days of treatment was related to poor outcome at 30 and 90 days. Our results also indicate that, unlike the determination of the GM index, the initial fungus load as determined by PCR was highly predictive of 90-day mortality, with the rate of the latter being 15.8% for patients with <150 copies/mL vs. 73.2% for patients at or above that cutoff (p <0.0001). Therefore, PCR appears to be a powerful and interesting tool for the identification of patients with invasive aspergillosis who might benefit from more intense care.",

They also may be influenced by the use of certain medical devices [5] or antibiotics [6, 7] , leading to a large number of false-positive results. GM detection has also been reported in invasive fungal diseases not due to Aspergillus [8] [9] [10] . Moreover, \u03b2-D-glucan is present in many fungus species and is therefore not specific to aspergillosis. Other tools have been developed to improve diagnosis, including in particular real-time PCR in blood samples to detect circulating Aspergillus DNA. Several studies have shown the potential interest of this PCR approach, but because of a lack of standardization, it has not yet been included in the EORTC/ MSG mycologic criteria. Recently however, a panel of experts has argued for its inclusion in those criteria [11] .",

PCR was more sensitive in neutropenic patients (82.1%) than it was in nonneutropenic patients (62.5%), but the difference was not significant (p 0.09).

[20] reported that patients with poor outcomes 45 days after the initiation of antifungal treatment had high baseline serum GM. We, however, found only a nonstatistically significant trend for the GM index in the determination of outcomes. Nevertheless, Bergeron et al. also found no association between outcome and Aspergillus DNA detection, while our work supports that the initial level of Aspergillus DNA is highly predictive of the 90-day mortality rate. As concerns our results more specifically, we found that a PCR threshold of 150 copies/mL could discriminate patients with low (below the threshold) or high (above) probabilities of 90day mortality. PCR thus has a much greater discriminative capacity than does the determination of the GM index. This result could be useful for identifying patients who may benefit from more intensive care and designing further clinical studies. We also showed that PCR quantification is useful in follow-up to predict outcomes. After only 1 week of therapy, an increase or decrease in the number of copies is not relevant for the assessment of treatment efficacy or outcome. However, PCR results after 2 weeks of treatment did appear to have relevance. In our study, patients who had a negative PCR (to which we add one patient who had cleared more than 99% of the initial load) between days 14 and 20 were all alive at day 30, and seven of them were still alive at day 90 vs. none of the five patients who remained PCR positive.",

This may explain at least in part the relative lack of sensitivity for PCR in our study, as non-fumigatus species may account for more than 25% of disease [22] .
