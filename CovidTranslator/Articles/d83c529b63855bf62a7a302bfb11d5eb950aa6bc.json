Currently, no effective vaccines or drugs have been developed against it. As a member of the genus Alphacoronavirus, FIPV encodes two polyprotein precursors required for genome replication and transcription. Each polyprotein undergoes extensive proteolytic processing, resulting in functional subunits. This process is mainly mediated by its genome-encoded main protease, which is an attractive target for antiviral drug design. In this study, the main protease of FIPV in complex with a Michael acceptor-type inhibitor was crystallized. The complex crystals diffracted to 2.5 \u00c5 resolution and belonged to space group I422, with unit-cell parameters a = 112.3, b = 112.3, c = 102.1 \u00c5 . There is one molecule per asymmetric unit.",

FCoVs have two antigenically distinct serotypes: type I and type II (Balint, Farsang, Szeredi et al., 2014) . Both serotypes occur in two pathotypes: Feline enteric coronavirus (FECV) and Feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV). FECV mainly replicates in the lower portion of the intestinal tract, spreads by the faecal-oral route, and presents clinically as mild or inapparent enteritis (Pedersen et al., 1981; Herrewegh et al., 1997; . On the other hand, FIPV efficiently replicates in macrophages/monocytes, leading to feline infectious peritonitis (FIP), a highly lethal systemic granulomatous disease of wild and domestic cats (Addie et al., 2009; Pedersen, 2009; Balint, Farsang, Szeredi et al., 2014; Kipar & Meli, 2014) . FIP, as an immune-mediated disease, features the antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) phenomenon (Weiss & Scott, 1981; Vennema et al., 1990; Tirado & Yoon, 2003) . The virus-specific antibodies induced upon infection by FIPV in cats do not protect them, but enhance the infection by FIPV and thus accelerate the disease symptoms (Weiss & Scott, 1981; Vennema et al., 1990; Tirado & Yoon, 2003; Takano et al., 2008) . Hence, there has been little progress in the development of clinical vaccines against FIPV, although a variety of methods have been tried, such as avirulent vaccines, attenuated live FIPV vaccines and recombinant vaccines (Pedersen, 2009) .",

This process is mediated by two virus-encoded proteinases. Nsp5, also named main protease (M pro ), is responsible for 11 out of 15 cleavage sites, thus playing a pivotal role in this digestion process and being indispensable for viral replication (Dye & Siddell, 2005) . The critical role of nsp5 in virus replication makes it an ideal target for anti-FIPV drug design (Yang et al., 2005; Anand et al., 2003) . To date, several crystal structures of other coronavirus main proteases have been solved (Anand et al., 2002 Yang et al., 2003 Yang et al., , 2005 Hilgenfeld, 2014) . Based on the structural analysis of these main proteases, the idea of designing wide-spectrum inhibitors against CoVs has been proposed. In this study, we report the crystallization ",

The recombinant plasmid was verified by sequencing and then transformed into Escherichia coli strain BL21 (DE3) for protein expression. Cultures were grown in LB medium containing 0.1 mg ml \u00c01 ampicillin at 310 K until the optical density at 600 nm reached 0.6. Isopropyl -d-1-thiogalactopyranoside was then added to a final concentration of 0.5 mM and the cultures were induced to express FIPV main protease at 289 K for 16 h. Thereafter, centrifugation was used to harvest the cells and the bacterial pellets were resuspended in PBS (140 mM NaCl, 10 mM Na 2 HPO 4 , 2.7 mM KCl, 1.8 mM KH 2 PO 4 pH 7.3) supplemented with 1 mM dithiothreitol (DTT) and 10% glycerol. After sonication at 277 K, the bacterial lysate was centrifuged at 12 000g for 50 min at 277 K and the precipitate was discarded. The supernatant was loaded onto a disposable column containing glutathione Sepharose 4B affinity resin (Pharmacia) to purify the GST-tagged FIPV main protease. The fusion protein was then subjected to on-column cleavage using commercial PreScission protease (Pharmacia) at 277 K for 18 h. The protease was added to a final concentration of 0.25 mg ml \u00c01 for proteolysis in PBS. Five additional residues (GPLGS) were left at the N-terminus of FIPV main protease. The resulting protein of interest was further purified by anion-exchange chromatography using a HiTrap Q column (GE Healthcare) with a linear gradient from 25 to 250 mM NaCl in 20 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 10% glycerol, 1 mM DTT and reached more than 90% purity by SDS-PAGE analysis (Fig. 1a) .",

However, upon virus infection the induced antibodies further enhance the infection instead of neutralizing the virus. This is the so-called 'antibody-dependent enhancement' (Weiss & Scott, 1981; Vennema et al., 1990; Tirado & Yoon, 2003) . Thus, no clinical vaccines against FIPV have been successfully developed to date. For this reason, the FIPV main protease, which is indispensable for virus replication, is an alternative target for antiviral therapy and has been subjected to crystallographic studies.",
