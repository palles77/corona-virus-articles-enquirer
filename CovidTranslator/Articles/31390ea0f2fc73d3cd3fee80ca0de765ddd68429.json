The purposes of this study were to detect respiratory viruses in hospitalized children younger than six years and identify the influence of temperature and relative air humidity on the detected viruses. Samples of nasopharyngeal washes were collected from hospitalized children between May/2004 and September/2005. Methods of viral detection were RT-PCR, PCR and HRV amplicons were confirmed by hybridization. Results showed 54% (148/272) of viral positivity. HRSV was detected in 29% (79/272) of the samples; HRV in 23.1% (63/272); HPIV3 in 5.1% (14/272); HMPV in 3.3% (9/272); HPIV1 in 2.9% (8/272); FLUB in 1.4% (4/272), FLUA in 1.1% (3/272), and HPIV2 in 0.3% (1/272). The highest detection rates occurred mainly in the spring 2004 and in the autumn 2005. It was observed that viral respiratory infections tend to increase as the relative air humidity decreases, showing significant association with monthly averages of minimal temperature and minimal relative air humidity. In conclusion, viral respiratory infections vary according to temperature and relative air humidity and viral respiratory infections present major incidences it coldest and driest periods.

Epidemiological studies from tropical regions indicate that factors as rainy seasons (34) or low air humidity (3) , in addition to temperature, may influence respiratory viruses outbreaks. Global warming carries profound changes in Earth\u00b4s climate, and major changes in the atmosphere and in the climate have a vast impact on the biosphere and the human environment (20) . Consequently, climatic variations and extreme weather events also cause profound impacts on infectious diseases incidences. Infectious agents (such as protozoa, bacteria and viruses) are devoid of thermostatic mechanisms, and reproduction and survival rates are thus strongly affected by fluctuations in temperature. Temperature dependencies are seen in correlations between disease rates and weather variations over weeks, months or years, as well as in close geographic associations with key climatic variables and the distributions of important infectious diseases (28) .",

In contrast, the period of incidence in 2005 occurred between early autumn and late winter, with outbreaks in autumn. Among all seasons that samples were collected, HRSV was the most identified virus, except for the summer 2005. Outbreaks were observed in winter and spring 2004, and autumn 2005. Presenting similar results, HRV was also detected during the whole period of sample collection. Outbreaks were observed in winter and spring 2004, and autumn 2005 (Figure 1B). HPIV3 and HMPV were detected in four of all seasons studied, being HPIV3 mainly detected in spring 2004 and HMPV in autumn 2005. HPIV1 had an incidence in two seasons, principally detected in spring 2004. FLUA, FLUB and HPIV2 presented incidences only in one season of the year, detected in winter and autumn 2005 respectively (Figure 1B).

Viral respiratory infections The Figure 2 illustrates viral respiratory infections correlated to monthly average of relative air humidity and monthly average of temperature. In the beginning of autumn 2004, relative air humidity was 75% and respiratory viruses were detected in few samples. The results show that when relative air humidity and temperature begin to decrease, viral respiratory infections tend to increase; when the temperature and the levels of relative air humidity increase and are maintained relatively high (summer 2005), the detection rate of respiratory viruses decreases, evidencing strong influence of temperature and relative air humidity levels on the incidence of viral respiratory infections in this period. The influence of temperature and relative air humidity on the circulation pattern of respiratory viruses was evidenced by statistical analysis.",

There was an anticipation of HRSV infections, which occurred at higher rates in March and April -a transition between summer and autumn. In this period, there was a fluctuation of the average temperature, which dropped a few degrees, then increased for a short period of time and decreased again. We can also observe that HRSV infections in 2004 were more prevalent than in 2005, thus evidencing the influence of temperature on infections by HRSV.",

ARI accounts approximately for 20% of mortality in children up to 5 years old(30).Respiratory viruses have been reported as the main cause of low respiratory tract infections in children(3,11, 38,39)    living in emerging countries, and despite advances in the epidemiological knowledge of these infections, researches involving respiratory viruses features that circulate in countries as Brazil are still necessary.From 272 samples collected from hospitalized children because of ARI, 54.4% presented viral etiology. These data are in accordance with previous studies that reported respiratory Viral respiratory infections viruses as the main cause of ARI, consisting of rates averaging from 30 to 75.5% (7, 11, 26). There is knowledge that ARI, caused by viral infections, are influenced by a diversity of factors (34) and the mainly one observed on the present study was the relation between the detection of respiratory virus and climatic season, which presents differences in the meteorological factors of each season, including the variation of temperature and relative air humidity. Before the prospect of anthropogenic climatic change emerged, epidemiologists were not greatly interested in climate-health relation (32). Recently, the discussions over the impacts of global warming on the terrestrial environment have awoken the interest of the association between climatic variations and health problems. Studies showed that the temperature-mortality relation varies greatly according to latitude and climatic zone. People living in warmer cities are more affected by lower temperatures, and people in colder cities are more affected by higher temperatures. In contrast, in the UK and some other northern high latitude countries, seasonal death rates and illness events are higher in the winter.(23). In Brazil circulation of respiratory viruses shows different patterns according to region (7). In the Southeast region, which possesses a predominant subtropical climate, characterized by dry winters with moderate low temperatures and rainy summers, respiratory viruses have higher incidences in the coldest and driest months. Our results showed a significant association between viral respiratory infections and monthly average of minimal relative air humidity (p=0.046), and between monthly average of minimal temperature (p=0.044).Therefore, it is observed that meteorological aspects may present influence one over the other, occurring variations on temperature according to fluctuations on relative air humidity, as relative air humidity varies according to temperature. These data reveal concomitant influences of climatic factors on viral respiratory infections. Consequently, the low temperatures and low relative air humidity could have effects on children respiratory tracts and immunological system, increasing their susceptibility to pathogens. Also these climatic profiles could cause an improvement of viral particles dissemination, leading to a higher probability of infection.In the United States, the HRSV season has been documented to start in late December and end in late March with regional variability in average start time -ranging from late November and early January in the South and the Midwest, respectively(26). Compared to several other respiratory viruses which are primarily spread by droplets, the mode of transmission for HRSV is direct or indirect contact(17,18). It has been suggested that human social behavior related to weather may increase person-to-person contact and may play a part in the seasonality of HRSV epidemics(4, 34). Crowding, large family size, multiple birth, and crowded homes are known risk factors for HRSV infection(2).",

Thus, it was verified a statistical significant association (p=0.010) between HRSV identification and monthly average of minimal temperature, showing that in Southeast Brazil this virus presents a correlation to periods that temperatures are lower. In Viral respiratory infections contrast to our observations,Omer et al. (2008) observed an association of higher HRSV incidence with the increase of rainfall and temperature; however, it is necessary to consider that this study was performed on an island population, at sea level in a tropical equatorial region.Concerning HRV, outbreaks were observed during spring, autumn and winter, agreeing to previous obtained results (7, 10), that detected HRV mainly in coldest months. AssociatingHRSV with HRV outbreaks, it was possible to verify that in 2004 HRSV had a major detection rate in late winter and spring; and comparing with the same period in 2005 it was verified that HRV had a higher prevalence, almost occurring an inversion on the incidences of these viruses in this period. An explanation for it would be the genotypes of HRSV circulating in 2004 and 2005. Children infected by HRSV in 2004 could obtain a better immune response to this virus in 2005, therefore leaving better conditions for HRV infections.",
