One sample (HA-2564) was scored negative by fi eld and laboratory PAGEIA, but (low) positive (optical density [OD] of 0.327) by conventional EIA (Table) .

The other 4 samples (HB-2628, HA-2609, HA-2616, HB-2710) were scored as positive by fi eld and laboratory PAGEIA but negative by conventional EIA. In the fi eld, each of these samples was scored as 1+ or 2+ and had ODs of 0.331-0.664 by laboratory PAGEIA.

Thus, we are confi dent that such samples in the fi eld will indicate seropositive animals. Because we are suggesting that this assay be used for identifying seropositive rodents and not for determining seroprevalence (although it appears to be adequate for those studies as well) and to be conservative, we considered only samples that appeared dark green (3+ and 4+) in the fi eld assay to be positive with relative certainty. To minimize the complexity of the PAGEIA under fi eld conditions, we did not use a negative control antigen to assess nonspecifi c reactivities of serum samples. Use of this test will allow deer mice with antibody to SNV to be identifi ed. Deer mice are the population most likely to be naturally infected with that virus, and those rodents can be retained for further testing and for studies of tissues, live cells, and body fl uids to be used for subsequent laboratory investigations, such as for determining cellular immunologic responses, viremia levels, viruria levels, and virus shedding in excreta and secreta.",
