Serum samples from 100 healthy blood donors (set 3), collected in 2002, were also included. The specific IgG response to whole virus, the fragment from positions 450 to 650 of the S protein (S450-650), and the full-length N protein of SARS-CoV were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs). Western blot assays were carried out to confirm the ELISA results. Fifty-one of the serum samples in set 1 (89%) bound to the N protein, a proportion similar to that which recognized whole virus (79%) and the S-protein fragment (77%). All 33 serum samples from set 2 were strongly positive for N-protein-specific IgG, while 27 (82%) were positive for anti-S450-650 IgG. Two of the serum samples from set 3 were strongly positive for anti-N-protein IgG but not anti-S450-650 IgG. Similar levels of IgG responses to the S and N proteins were observed in SARS patients during the manifestation and convalescent stages. In the postinfection period, however, a number of patients had much lower serum IgG levels against S450-650 than against the N protein.",

Its genome encodes several structural and nonstructural proteins, including the spike (S) glycoprotein, the nucleocapsid (N) protein, the membrane protein, RNA polymerase, and the main protease 3C-like (3CL) protein (2, 7, 9) . The 49-kDa, 422amino-acid-residue N protein of SARS-CoV shares 32% homology to the N proteins of the other human CoV strains (7, 9) . It is abundantly expressed in cells infected by SARS-CoV and induces strong antibody responses in patients (2, 5, 10). The S glycoprotein, which mediates membrane fusion between the virus and the host cell (4, 13, 14, 16), consists of 1,267 amino acid residues and has approximately 25% homology to the S glycoproteins of the other human CoVs (7, 9) . We have previously documented that a 31-kDa fragment comprising amino acid residues 450 to 650 (S450-650) of the S protein of SARS-CoV contains immunodominant epitopes and can be used with high specificity and sensitivity as the coating antigen in enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) for the detection of anti-S-protein immunoglobulin G (IgG) in patient sera (18, 19) .",

Briefly, Vero E6 cells maintained in Dulbecco modified Eagle medium containing 10% fetal calf serum were seeded in 96-well plates at a density of 8 \u03eb 10 3 cells/well and cultured overnight. Serially diluted serum samples were mixed with the pseudovirus preparations for 30 min at 37\u00b0C, and then the mixtures were added to the wells containing monolayers of Vero E6 cells. After incubation at 37\u00b0C for 1 h, the mixture in the wells was replaced with fresh medium and the cells were cultured for an additional 48 h. After washes, the cells were lysed with the luciferase assay reagent (Promega, Madison, WI), and the luciferase activity in the cell lysate was determined with a Veritas microplate luminometer (Turner Biosystems). The luciferase activity of the reference group (Vero E6 cells treated with pseudovirus alone) was taken as 100% infection. Cells not treated with pseudovirus were included as a specificity control, and their luciferase activity readings were at least 3 log units lower than that for the reference group in all experiments. The luciferase activities of the experimental groups (Vero E6 cells treated with pseudovirus preparations in the presence of serum antibodies) were compared with that of the reference group; and the results, expressed as percent infection, were calculated as follows: 100 \u03eb (luciferase activity of the experimental groups/luciferase activity of the reference group).",

The recombinant proteins were then used as coating antigens to develop ELISA systems for the detection of S-specific and N-specific antibodies. The results presented in Fig. 2 demonstrate that these ELISA systems are able to readily detect specific IgG antibodies in patient sera. To confirm the assay specificity, 100 individual serum samples from healthy blood donors (set 3) were screened at a dilution of 1 in 100 by the S450-650-based and N-protein-based ELISAs. None were positive by the S450-650-based ELISA (Fig. 3B ).

However, ample evidence suggests that S450-650 contains a dominant epitope(s) for anti-S-protein antibodies in sera from most patients confirmed to have SARS. For instance, we have previously shown that the S450-650-based ELISA could detect IgG antibodies specific for two immunodominant B-cell epitopes, S511-545 and S596-600, in convalescent-phase sera from most SARS patients in a sensitive and specific fashion (18, 19) . Lu and coworkers showed that patient sera mainly recognized epitopes contained within residues 441 to 700 of the S protein of SARS-CoV, as determined in Western blot assays (6) . In addition, Zhou and colleagues documented in 2004 that residues 485 to 625 of the S protein of SARS-CoV elicited neutralizing antibodies against the virus (21) .",

However, clear segregation between the anti-N-protein and anti-S-protein IgG levels was observed in the postinfection sera, with the rate of positivity for anti-S-protein antibody lower than that for anti-N-protein antibody (100% versus 82% positive for anti-N-protein and anti-S-protein IgG, respectively). This observation may have important implications for our understanding of the humoral immunity against SARS-CoV and also future SARS vaccination programs. For example, a combination of priming with an inactivated virus vaccine and boosting with recombinant S protein may be necessary to maintain high-titer S-protein-specific neutralizing antibodies in recipients. SARS-CoV binds to the ACE2 receptor on the cell surface by using the S protein; thus, S-protein-specific rather than N-protein-specific antibodies are able to neutralize the infec-FIG. 6 . Western blot assays of sera from patients and healthy subjects. Recombinant N protein (lanes N), S450-650 (lanes S), and 3CL protein (lanes 3CL) were run in SDS-12% polyacrylamide gels. After electrophoresis, the protein bands were transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes for probing with sera from patients in the convalescent phase (set 2) (A to C) or serum samples N20 and N49 from healthy blood donors (set 3) (D). Bound antibodies were then detected by using HRP-labeled goat anti-human IgG. (19) . The data in Fig. 8 indicate a positive correlation between the titers of S450-650-specific IgG antibodies and their neutralization ability. Even though the number of serum samples (n \u03ed 6) included here was too small for a statistically meaningful analysis of any correlation between S450-650-specific antibody titers and their neutralization activity, the results were nonetheless supportive of such a notion. Presumably, all individuals make neutralizing antibodies following SARS-CoV infection; however, the S-protein-specific neutralizing antibodies seem to last in the host for a relatively shorter period of time than the N-protein-specific antibodies, as evidenced by the clear segregation between the anti-N-protein and anti-Sprotein IgG antibodies in the serum samples from set 2. Two of the 100 serum samples from set 3 were strongly positive by the N-protein-based ELISA and Western blot assays ( Fig. 3 and 6D) and also by the Huada ELISA (Table 2) . This is epidemiologically intriguing, as these serum samples were collected more than 1 year before the first reported outbreak of SARS in humans. These two individuals did not recall having a \"mild\" infection with symptoms similar to those associated with SARS prior to blood sample collection. This study also illustrated that these N-protein-specific sera did not have neutralizing abilities in our pseudovirus neutralization assays (Fig. 8B) . It is possible that antibodies were elicited in the sera of these individuals by an infection(s) with human CoV strains such as 229E, OC43, NL63 (12) , and HKU1 (15) . It has been documented that human CoV strains 229E and OC43 are responsible for \u03f330% of all common colds (11) , and the recently identified strains NL63 and HKU1 also contribute significantly to the overall spectrum of CoV infection (1) . The N proteins of known CoVs are relatively more conservative than other structural proteins (3) . The N protein of human CoV strain NL63 shared the highest amino acid sequence identity with that of human CoV strain 229E (12) , while the N protein of human CoV strain HKU1 had less than 40% homology with those of other non-group 2 CoVs (15). Furthermore, Sun and Meng showed that polyclonal antisera against known animal CoVs cross-reacts with the N protein of SARS-CoV (11) . Since serology remains the \"gold standard\" for the diagnosis of SARS, it is important to explore serological crossreactions between SARS-CoV and other CoVs. ",
