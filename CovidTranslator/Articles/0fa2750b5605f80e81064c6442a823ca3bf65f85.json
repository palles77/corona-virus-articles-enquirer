This is the matrix protein of There is a number of protein structure prediction programs available. Some are integrated in complex commercial DNA/protein analysis packages, while others are freely available to the scientific community. These later programs have shown its usefulness, but have three major shortages. They usually do not have any graphical capacity, which is essential for a proper understanding of the predicted structures, they can not simultaneously analyze more than one protein structure feature, and they are not very fast. Although some of the commercial programs do overcome these deficiencies they are not freely available to the academic community, are usually expensive and sometimes need mainframe computers to be implemented. From these considerations, we believe PREDICT7 can be useful to other investigators in this field.",

Secondly, part of the information obtained is somewhat redundant with some of the predictions. This is the reason beneath the decision of not including every prediction in graphical outputs.information as it comes: each can complement the other, helping to fit data in the puzzle.A review on this subject relative to integral membrane proteins has recently been published(19) and illustrates how both kinds of data should be considered.",
