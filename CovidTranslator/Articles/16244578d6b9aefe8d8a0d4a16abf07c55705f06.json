Recently, biochemical and structural studies of cellular macro domains have been performed, showing that they are active as ADP-ribose-1 00 -phosphatases. Macro domains are also present in a number of positive-stranded RNA viruses, but their precise function in viral replication is still unknown. The major human pathogen severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) encodes 16 non-structural proteins (nsps), one of which (nsp3) encompasses a macro domain. The SARS-CoV nsp3 gene region corresponding to amino acids 182-355 has been cloned, expressed in Escherichia coli, purified and crystallized. The crystals belong to space group P2 1 , with unit-cell parameters a = 37.5, b = 55.6, c = 108.9 \u00c5 , = 91.4 , and the asymmetric unit contains either two or three molecules. Both native and selenomethionine-labelled crystals diffract to 1.8 \u00c5 .",

The particularly large size of the genome probably results from the fact that it encodes for unusual enzymatic activities within the viral world (Snijder et al., 2003) .

To date, 330 proteins have been reported to possess such a domain (from the SMART database; Letunic et al., 2004) . The macro domain is found in a number of multidomain proteins, including nonstructural proteins of several ssRNA viruses (such as rubella virus, alphaviruses and some coronaviruses), some poly-ADP-ribose polymerases and the C-terminal domain of macro-H2A histone proteins, but it can also constitute a stand-alone protein by itself, as is the case in bacteria, archaebacteria and eukaryotes (F. Forouhar, I. Lee, S. M. Vorobiev, R. Xiao, T. B. Acton, G. T. Montelione, J. F. Hunt & L. Tong, unpublished work; Allen et al., 2003; Shull et al., 2005; Letunic et al., 2004) . This wide distribution suggests an essential and ubiquitous role in cellular processes.",

The role of this activity, particularly in the viral world, is still puzzling. We are interested in identifying the exact role of viral macro domains by a combination of enzymatic characterization studies and structural studies of the enzyme alone or in complex with biologically relevant molecules. Therefore, we have initiated the structural and functional characterization of Semliki Forest virus, human coronavirus 229E and SARS coronavirus macro domains. During the course of this study, the crystal structure of a slightly different construct of another strain of SARS-CoV (strain Tor2) was solved as an apo enzyme and published (Saikatendu et al., 2005) . The Tor2 protein is dimeric, both in solution and in the crystal, and its structure reveals that the active site is occluded by the dimeric association, which explains why soaking experiments with various ligands failed for this particular crystal structure.",

            "text": "As soon as the SARS-CoV genome sequence became available, we performed the annotation of its genome independently using the VaZyMolO ('viral enzyme module localization') tool that had been previously developed in our laboratory. The scope of VaZyMolO is to define within large viral polyproteins viral proteins and protein modules that might be expressed in a soluble and functionally active form (Ferron et al., 2005) . Our annotation of the proteins (nonstructural, structural and accessory) encoded by the SARS-CoV genome was similar to that of Snijder et al. (2003) . In the case of nsp3, we defined six independent domains, including a macro domain. Being located between two poorly characterized domains (namely a glutamic acid-rich acidic domain and a SARS-specific unique domain; SUD), the SARS-CoV macro domain did not have clearly defined borders. Our annotation within the VaZyMolO database was based on multiple criteria, including bioinformatics approaches, examination of the available three-dimensional structures of cellular macro domains and existing biochemical data. The latter suggests that in some viruses the N-terminal border definition may be particularly crucial for detection of ADP-ribose-1 00 -phosphatase activity (T. Ahola, personal communication). The coding sequence for this domain (consisting of 174 amino acids, amino acids 182-355 of nsp3, isolate Frankfurt 1, DDB/EMBL/Genbank accession No. AY291315) was amplified from the pMal-SARS-CoV-X plasmid kindly provided by Akos Putics and John Ziebuhr (Putics et al., 2005) . Amplification was performed by PCR using two primers containing the attB sites of the Gateway recombination system (Invitrogen). A sequence encoding a hexahistidine tag was added at the 5 0 end of the gene. The cDNA was then subcloned in the pDest14 plasmid (Invitrogen). The open reading frame of the final construct was checked by sequencing (MilleGen, Toulouse, France).",

Protein expression was induced by the addition of a final concentration of 50 mM isopropyl 1-thio--d-galactopyranoside (IPTG) and the cells were incubated for a further 20 h at 298 K and 250 rev min \u00c01 . Cells were collected by centrifugation at 5000g for 20 min at 277 K and the bacterial pellets were resuspended and then frozen at 253 K in 50 mM Tris-HCl, 150 mM NaCl, 10 mM imidazole pH 8.0 (10 ml per OD 600 unit and per litre of culture). Cellular suspensions were thawed, supplemented with 1 mM PMSF, 0.2 mg ml \u00c01 lysozyme, 0.1 mg ml \u00c01 DNase, 20 mM MgSO 4 and protease-cocktail inhibitor (Sigma), lysed by sonication and centrifuged (20 000g) for 40 min at 277 K to produce cell-free extract. All purification steps were performed at 277 K. The supernatant was applied onto a 5 ml bed-volume HiTrap nickel immobilized metal-ion affinity chromatography (IMAC) column (Amersham Biosciences) connected to an FPLC system (Amersham Biosciences). The protein was eluted with 50 mM Tris-HCl, 150 mM NaCl, 250 mM imidazole pH 8.0. Fractions containing the protein were determined by SDS-PAGE, pooled and then applied onto a preparative Superdex 200 gelfiltration column pre-equilibrated in 10 mM MOPS, 150 mM NaCl pH 7.0. Protein was eluted with a retention volume corresponding to a monomeric macro domain. The purity of the protein was evaluated by SDS-PAGE. Protein was concentrated to 8 mg ml \u00c01 using a Vivaspin 10 kDa molecular-weight cutoff centrifugal concentrator (Vivascience). The protein concentration was determined from the molar extinction coefficient of the enzyme at 280 nm (9840 M \u00c01 cm \u00c01 ) as calculated by the Expasy server (http://www.expasy.org/tools/ protparam.html). The purified protein was stored at 277 K. Selenomethionine (SeMet) labelled protein was prepared following standard procedures (Doubli\u00e9, 1997) and the protein was purified using the same protocol employed for the native protein except that 1 mM TCEP was added to the protein immediately after its elution from the IMAC column and to the gel-filtration buffer. Typical yields were 15-20 mg of pure protein per litre of culture for both native and SeMet-labelled protein.",

As the amount of protein was not a limiting parameter, we used a wide-screen approach using the following commercial kits: Wizard Screens I and II (Emerald Biostructures), Structure Screens I and II (Jancarik & Kim, 1991 Hampton Research). Using the 8 mg ml \u00c01 purified protein sample, three drops were set up by a Cartesian robot controlled by the AXSYS software above each reservoir; these drops were made up of 300, 200 and 100 nl of protein solution, respectively, and 100 nl reservoir solution (Sulzenbacher et al., 2002) . From these 864 conditions, two hits were identified in the Stura Footprint Screen. A primary optimization of these conditions was performed using homemade solutions, which were dispensed in 64 wells of a Greiner crystallization plate in a 8 \u00c2 8 format by the Tecan Genesis robot. The best conditions were then transposed to hanging drops in 24-well tissue-culture Limbro plates. As in the Greiner plates, hundreds of plate-like multiple crystals grew from a single nucleation point overnight. Microseeding in undersaturated equilibrated drops led to single crystals that were suitable for X-ray analysis (Fig. 1) . The final conditions for crystallization were as follows: 2 ml protein solution (8 mg ml \u00c01 ) was mixed with 1 ml reservoir solution (total volume of 0.5 ml) containing 0.1 M imidazole pH 7.9, 1.3 M sodium citrate. Multiple crystals grew overnight. They were crushed and used to microseed a pre-equilibrated drop made of 2 ml protein solution (8 mg ml \u00c01 ) mixed with 1 ml of a reservoir solution containing 0.1 M imidazole pH 7.8, 0.9 M sodium citrate. These conditions differ from those found by Saikatendu and coworkers (see Table 1 ), which is not surprising considering that the constructs are quite different (considering the N-terminal tag, the construct of Saikatendu and coworkers is three amino acids longer at the N-terminal and ten amino acids longer at the C-terminal extremities).",
