Currently, little is known about the secular trend in ED visits due to septicemia in the general population of Taiwan. It is also necessary to consider the confounding risk factors that might have affected the incidence of septicemia during the same calendar period [24] , such as annual incidence of metastatic malignant neoplasms and malignant neoplasms of the lymphatic and hematopoietic tissues [25] .",

However, there has been little research on awareness of the diagnosis of patient visits for septicemia in the ED during implementation of EGDT and SSC, or how patient visits for septicemia are influenced by implementation of these programs. In the current study, we expected that EGDT protocol and SSC education program would increase awareness of the diagnosis of patient visits from septicemia in the ED, which in turn would increase the number of visits due to septicemia. We used segmented regression to determine the immediate impact of the EGDT protocol and SSC education program on the annual rates of septicemia-related ED visits by comparing the visit rates before EGDT implementation (1998) (1999) (2000) (2001) , during EGDT and SSC implementation (2002) (2003) (2004) (2005) , and after SSC implementation (2006-2012).",

For instance, we might be interested in the effects of the different components of a larger intervention introduced at different times. The level and slope are the parameters that define the intercept and slope, respectively, of each successive segment of the time series. The level parameter was defined as the expected or mean number of patient visits at a particular time interval, and the slope parameter quantifies the change in the number of patient visits over a single unit of time (per year). A disjointed or interrupted intervention effect is reflected in the step-change (change in intercepts) in the outcome variable between any two consecutive periods after the intervention. Beforeand-after changes in the number of septicemia-related ED visits were estimated by testing differences in the slopes between the pre-and post-intervention periods.

This means that the estimated coefficients of the segmented regression model were transformed; these results are presented in Table  2 . As shown in Table 2 , there was a significant change point for the intercepts (i.e., the level parameter) and a statistically significant overall trend in the number of patient visits ( P < 0.0 0 01). In particular, the level change in septicemia-related ED visits was significant for the 0-19 group as well as for middle-aged and older adult groups (for level change, both P < 0.0 0 01). Fig. 1 shows the fitted numbers of septicemia-related ED visits by age group across the three calendar periods. Both the observed and the model-based estimates are shown for comparison. Variation in the overall septicemia-related ED visits over the 15year period mainly resulted from the decreases observed in all age groups for 20 03-20 06 and the increases in the middle-aged and older adult groups between 2008 and 2012, whose upward trends appeared parallel to each other ( Fig. 1 ). Fig. 2 shows the significant estimated change points (for 2002 and 2007) for the two interventions (EGDT protocol and SSC education program). After comparing septicemia-related ED visits of the intervention period, there were one-to two-year lags in the effect of the intervention. Theoretically, the intervention effects might occur over several periods, which embed in rolling periods. To better quantify the early impact of the EGDT protocol and SSC education program, we additionally compared model-predicted ED visits with and without the intervention to confirm the intervention effects. In expressing the results of the segmented regression modeling, we either report the level and trend changes in ED visits following implementation of the EGDT protocol and SSC education program (see Table 2 ) or compare estimated numbers of ED visits in the post-intervention period when the intervention was implemented and when it was not (i.e., the counterfactual value). We considered the Poisson regression models for 2002 and 2007 to express the intervention effects, respectively. In practice, the intervention effect can be expressed as the absolute difference in predicted visits between when the intervention was implemented and the counterfactual value. Alternatively, we can present the ratio of the absolute difference value to the counterfactual value. We can express the ratio as a percentage increase or decrease by multiplying by 100.",

Discharge data from the Nationwide Inpatients Sample found that the hospitalization rate for septicemia ranged from 0.65 to 1.35 per 10 0 0 population in 1993-2003 [32] . The findings can be attributed to a gap between the true and reported incidence of septicemia, a phenomenon that might be explained by advances in diagnostic devices used by hospital infection control teams [33] , a higher likelihood of ED physicians to make septicemia-related diagnoses (i.e., surveillance bias), and overall increased awareness of septicemiarelated symptoms and signs by the general population, including at-risk patients and their family members. Indeed, we found that the number of septicemia-related ED visits was about the same in 2012 as in 2002.",

However, these visits showed differing trends after the two interventions. The EGDT protocol is regarded as so complicated that it remains controversial whether it actually reduces case fatalities. On the other hand, the SSC guidelines can be delivered as part of an education program, which has been shown to improve outcomes. Potentially counter-intuitive to these findings is the finding that there were fewer estimated septicemia-related ED visits when the SSC intervention was not implemented. This can be explained by an increase in physician awareness. Physicians' awareness of septicemia-related symptoms might be promoted through education programs. Chen et al. investigated the effect of a nationwide educational program based on the SSC guidelines on hospitalizations for severe sepsis. The annual severe sepsis incidence rate increased slightly after the program (by 0.4 on average). Furthermore, physicians' clinical practice of sepsis care and patient mortality rate for severe sepsis both decreased [37] . Thus, it is important to evaluate the effectiveness and outcomes of the SSC education program.",

            "text": "In Taiwan, because the size and infection situation of each hospital differ, the implementation times of the interventions are not the same for each hospital. However, the emergent rescuer responsive hospitals for acute care must implement SSC quickly because of requirements by the MOHW-namely, the Grading Responsible Hospitals for Acute Care (GRHAC) audit program, which was implemented from 2007 to 2009 [39] . The MOHW has annually audited and updated the list of responsible acute care hospitals since 2009. The current lag between the implementation of the SSC intervention and its actual rollout, which is about three years, allows for a dramatic growth in septicemia ED visits to the ED. With the implementation of the SSC program, public health decision-makers might be able to increase the period for protocol administration, and thereby better evaluate the impact of the SSC intervention on septicemia-related ED visits. Therefore, it might be important to consider the length of the intervention period when developing health care plans that can help public health programs achieve their goal.",

            "text": "This study has several limitations. First, the covariates were limited in number and were rather specific categories since there is a shortage of individual-level claims data. Therefore, there is a potential risk of unmeasured and uncontrolled confounding variables in the current analysis. Second, we investigated the impact of the EDGT protocol and SSC education program on septicemia-related ED visits between 1998 and 2012 due to data availability. Besides, the relatively short pre-intervention period (1998-2001 and 2002-2005) might have limited the statistical power for the segmented regression analysis to detect minimal changes in the level or slope parameters [29] . Third, the aggregated format datasets make it difficult to completely adjust for confounders (such as comorbidities, education levels, or lifestyle) in the multivariable linear regression model. Further completed studies need to resolve this limitation when using individual data. Fourth, the number of cases of septicemia was relatively low ( Table 1 ) compared to another study using aggregate claims data (which reported the incidence rates for severe sepsis) [37] . One potential reason is the coding method of sepsis we adopted. Gender differences might be another reason: For example, women might be less likely to develop septicemia than men [40] .",
