In this study, RNA aptamers against SCV NTPase/Helicase (nsP10) were isolated from RNA library containing random sequences of 40 nts using in vitro selection technique. Nucleotide sequences of enriched RNA aptamer pool (ES15 RNA) contain AG-rich conserved sequence of 10-11 nucleotides [AAAGGR(G)GAAG; R, purine base] and/or additional sequence of 5 nucleotides [GAAAG], which mainly reside at the loop region in all the predicted secondary structures. Isolated RNAs were observed to efficiently inhibit double-stranded DNA unwinding activity of the helicase by up to $85% with an IC 50 value of 1.2 nM but show a slight effect on ATPase activity of the protein in the presence of cofactor, poly (rU). These results suggest that the pool of selected aptamers might be potentially useful as anti-SCV agents.",

SCV is an enveloped, single-stranded RNA positive-strand virus with a genome of $30 kb [2, 3] . There have been several reports of anti-SCV drug development against viral main protease (3CL protease) [4, 5] and SCV NTPase/Helicase (nsP10) [6, 7] . Tertiary structure of the SCV NTPase/Helicase has not been experimentally verified, but the structure prediction of the protein was recently reported [8] . SCV nsP10 has been shown to contain helicase activity of unwinding double-stranded DNA with a 5 0 to 3 0 polarity [9] . Furthermore, it has been observed that RNA homopolymer significantly stimulated ATPase activity of the helicase [9] . The viral helicase has been identified as a potential target for therapy in other viruses due to its indispensability in viral genome replication [10] [11] [12] . Thus, SCV NTPase/Helicase (nsP10) that was recently purified and characterized is an attractive target for development of anti-SCV agent [9] .",

SELEX is an efficient method to isolate high affinity DNA and RNA ligands for target molecules including proteins, organic dyes, and other small molecules [15] . RNA aptamers have been isolated using the SELEX against several viral proteins, such as HIV Tat [16] and reverse transcriptase [17] , and HCV NS3 protease [18] /helicase [19] , and NS5B RNA-dependent RNA polymerase [20, 21] , all of which could inhibit the enzyme activity in vitro. However, no studies have been undertaken for the isolation of RNA aptamers against SCV nsP10 to inhibit NTPase/Helicase activity of the protein. In the present study, we utilized the SELEX to isolate RNA aptamers against SCV NTPase/ Helicase from RNA library containing random sequences of 40 nts. After 15 successive rounds of SELEX, we have isolated enriched RNA aptamer pool that can efficiently inhibit nucleic acid unwinding activity of the helicase with a slight effect on ATPase activity of the protein.",

The recombinant His-tagged SCV NTPase/Helicase was purified as described previously [9] with a following modification; after purification with a nickel-charged HiTrap chelating column (GE Healthcare) chromatography, fractions containing the protein, which was determined by 10% SDS-PAGE, were ultrafiltrated with Amicon stirred cell (YM-30). During the ultrafiltration, desalting and buffer exchange was accompanied for the next column containing 180 ml of Sephadex G-100 resin (Sigma), which was washed with Buffer A (25 mM Tris-HCl; pH 7.5, and 0.3 mM NaCl). After the protein sample (2 ml) was applied to column, it was eluted with the same buffer at a flow rate 0.3 ml/min. Pure fractions determined by SDS-PAGE were combined, and the pooled fractions were ultrafiltrated with Amicon stirred cell (YM-30) for volume down. The purified protein in 30% (v/v) glycerol was frozen at \u00c080 o C for long term storage. Protein concentration was determined using a Bio-Rad protein assay system (Bio-Rad) with bovine serum albumin as the standard. Typical yields were $5 mg of purified protein/6 liter of bacterial culture.",

It has been previously reported that RNA aptamers for hepatitis C virus NS3 protease contains a conserved sequence of 9 nucleotides in the loop structure [18] .

ATPase activity of the SCV helicase has been previously reported to be highly stimulated by single-stranded RNA [9] . We have confirmed the RNA-stimulated ATPase activity of the purified SCV helicase using RNA homopolymer (poly (rU)), and RNA concentration dependence on the ATPase activity was investigated (data not shown). Since the RNA aptamer pool constitutes a mixture of RNAs of 90 nts length, it may stimulate the ATPase activity of the protein if the protein recognizes the RNA pool as a genuine cofactor for ATP hydrolysis activity. As shown in Fig. 3A , ES15 RNA stimulated the ATPase activity in a dose-dependent manner with a K 1/2 value of 2.34 ng/ll. This dose-dependent stimulation of ATPase activity was also observed with the random RNA library, suggesting that the SCV helicase hydrolyzes ATP by utilizing ES15 RNA as a RNA cofactor for ATPase activity regardless of RNA sequences and binding affinity. We next investigated whether the RNA aptamer pool could inhibit ATPase activity of the helicase in the presence of 100 nM poly (rU) RNA. As shown in Fig. 3B , ES15 RNA failed to significantly inhibit the poly (rU)-stimulated ATPase activity even at the highest amount tested. At a high dosage of the RNA aptamer pool slight decrease of the ATPase activity was observed. This is probably because the RNA aptamers might take over the binding of poly (rU) to the helicase and maximal stimulation of the ATP hydrolysis by ES15 RNA is less than that by the poly (rU) (data not shown). Averaged molecular weight of the aptamer pool (ES15 RNA) was precisely determined to be 30.2 kDa by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry (Fig. 3C ). Using the averaged molecular weight and K 1/2 value of ES15 RNA for ATPase stimulation shown in Fig. 3A , apparent ATPase IC 50 for ES15 RNA was calculated to be 77 nM. This value indirectly reflects a binding affinity of the ES15 RNA to putative site for ATP hydrolysis stimulation in the SCV helicase. In the previous report of the RNA aptamers against HCV NS3 helicase domain, RNA aptamers specific to the helicase with high-affinity interfered with the substrate RNA binding without stimulation of the ATPase activity [19] . On the contrary, in our study both original random RNA library and RNA aptamer pool stimulated ATPase activity of the protein, indicating that the RNA aptamer pool against the SCV helicase can substitute RNA substrate in a competitive manner and play a role as a cofactor for ATP hydrolysis.",

A similar approach for the helicase activity assay has been reported recently in the HCV helicase and the SCV helicase [7, 24] . Previously, it has been shown that the SCV helicase requires 5 0 -overhang of the dsDNA substrate for its 5 0 to 3 0 directionality in unwinding [9] . Thus, we have designed dsDNA substrate with a 20 nts of 5 0 -oligo(dT) overhang as described in Materials and methods. When the two oligomers are in very close proximity due to annealing, the FRET occurs from the Fluorescein to TAMRA, emitting a very weak fluorescence from Fluorescein. Whereas, an increase of fluorescence in Fluorescein dye may be observed due to the absence of FRET after the duplex has been unwound either by the heat denaturation or by the helicase (Fig. 4A) . To ensure that the unwound oligoDNAs do not reanneal, an excess amount of trap DNA that is identical to the shorter strand (T0D25Flu) but does not contain the Fluorescein was included in the reaction. Thus, reannealing process has very little effect on the fluorescence of Fluorescein. Reaction condition was chosen to ensure that the helicase undergoes its dsDNA unwinding catalysis in a steady-state. As 5 min incubation of the dsDNA substrate and the helicase in the presence of ATP and Mg 2+ is sufficient enough for the steady-state of DNA unwinding, effect of the presence of various concentrations of ES15 RNA or random RNA library was tested in the middle of steady-state phase of helicase reaction and compared to the control reaction where no RNA was added. Trap oligoDNA was added along with the testing RNAs to augment the fluorescence signal from 5 0 -end Fluorescein of the displaced DNA strand.",

Remarkably, the helicase IC 50 value appeared to be smaller than the ATPase IC 50 value, indicating that the RNA aptamers more strongly bind to the helicase when the protein is complexed with dsDNA substrate rather than the helicase without dsDNA substrate. The random RNA library did not show a significant inhibition of the helicase activity, suggesting that strong binding affinity with defined sequences (i.e., conserved sequences in SE15 RNAs) to the helicase is necessary to inhibit dsDNA unwinding activity. Although the binding site of SE15 RNA on the SCV helicase is not defined in this study, the isolated ES15 RNA against the SCV NTPase/Helicase is a fully effective inhibitor of dsDNA unwinding activity of the helicase with IC 50 of 1.2 nM, but not ATPase.
