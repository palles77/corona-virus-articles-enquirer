Sera from some of the patients also showed immunoreactivity to U274 (59 of 81 [73%]), a protein that is unique to SARS-CoV. In addition, all of the convalescent-phase sera showed immunoreactivity to the spike (S) protein when analyzed by an immunofluorescence method utilizing mammalian cells stably expressing S. However, samples from the acute phase (2 to 9 days after the onset of illness) did not react with S, suggesting that antibodies to N may appear earlier than antibodies to S. Alternatively, this could be due to the difference in the sensitivities of the two methods. The immunoreactivities to these recombinant viral proteins are highly specific, as sera from 100 healthy donors did not react with any of them. These results suggest that recombinant N, S, and U274 proteins may be used as antigens for the development of serological assays for SARS-CoV.",

The high mortality rate of up to 15%, together with the highly contagious and acute nature of the disease, has imposed tremendous psychological and economic burden on the public. In Singapore and elsewhere, to reduce the risk of contact with people who may have been exposed to the SARS-causing virus, strict quarantine orders were served to those who had traveled to SARS-affected countries, those who had been in direct contact with SARS patients, and those with temperatures exceeding 38\u00b0C. Early diagnoses of the disease during the early phase of infection could avoid unnecessary quarantines, reduce the stress to those concerned, and help doctors to decide on appropriate medical action and/or treatment. It is therefore vital to identify SARS patients as early as possible, with certainty and accuracy. Given that no effective anti-SARS therapeutics are currently available, the first line of defense is to identify and isolate infected patients as early as possible. Hence, the need for the development of sensitive and highly specific diagnostic kits that can be used in the field is urgent and immediate.",

            "text": "A novel coronavirus was identified as the etiological agent of SARS (2, 3, 5, 10) . Coronaviruses are enveloped viruses that contain a single-stranded, positive-sense RNA genome of 27.6 to 31 kb. Analyses of the nucleotide sequence of the novel SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) showed that the viral genome is nearly 30 kb in length (9, 11) and contains 14 potential open reading frames (ORFs) (9) . With the identification of the SARS-CoV genome, several diagnostic tests based on the detection of viral RNA sequences by use of PCR have been designed and are now available. Such tests, although sensitive, have inherent problems: scientists and clinicians around the world are unsure what types of samples (respiratory samples, saliva, stool, blood, or conjunctival fluid) from patients give the most reproducible RNA preparations; RNA extraction protocols are not straightforward, and if not done well, may produce RNA preparations that are not useful for the reverse transcription step that converts viral RNA to DNA; and the whole process of extraction, reverse transcription, and PCR can be time-consuming if confirmatory tests have to be done with several pairs of primers. In addition, false positives are possible with amplification methods, as was observed in August 2003 in Canada, when some patients infected with other human coronaviruses initially tested positive for SARS by a PCR method (http://www.bccdc.org). Contamination in PCR laboratories is always a concern, which in the case of SARS could lead to unnecessary quarantines.",

The sequence of SARS-CoV reveals ORFs for four structural proteins, i.e., spike (S), membrane (M), envelope (E), and nucleocapsid (N), which are present in all coronaviruses (6, 9, 11, 13) . In addition, there are several ORFs predicted from the SARS-CoV sequence that encode proteins unique to SARS-CoV, as they show no significant sequence homology to viral proteins of other coronaviruses. In this study, we screened a panel of SARS-CoV ORFs expressed in mammalian and/or bacterial cells for reactivity toward convalescent-phase patient sera, as well as sera from acutely infected patients, to determine which antigen(s) would be most suitable as a diagnostic marker for the detection of SARS-CoV infection.",

These were obtained at two time points of infection, one at 2 to 11 days after the onset of illness (set A) and another at 16 to 54 days after the onset of illness (set B) ( Table 2 ). For all seven cases, the second time point samples were taken at least 8 days after the first time point samples. As shown in Fig. 3a , anti-IgG antibodies against GST-N protein were present in all seven patients' sera at the later time point (set B), but not at the early time points (set A). For both sets of sera, the membranes were incubated with the diluted sera (1:150) for 1.5 h at room temperature, followed by incubation with the secondary anti- body (HRP-conjugated anti-human IgG) for 1 h at room temperature. In addition, all seven of the late time point sera also contained antibodies against GST-U274, albeit at a lower level than that for GST-N (Fig. 3a, set B) . We repeated the experiment for the early time point sera (set A) but incubated the blots with diluted sera overnight at room temperature instead of for 1.5 h and used three different secondary antibodies, anti-IgG, anti-IgM, and anti-IgA, and the results for each of them are shown in Fig. 3b . For IgG, only samples 9A and 11A showed some reactivity to GST-N. For IgA, though, all seven samples showed reactivity to GST-N, and the signals were particularly strong for samples 9A and 11A. For IgM, all seven samples showed a low level of reactivity to GST-N. As the early time point sample for each patient was collected a different number of days after the onset of illness, our results suggest that by as early as 2 days after the onset of illness (patient D2, sample 2A), IgM and IgA antibodies against the N protein were present. By 9 days after the onset of illness, very high levels of IgA antibodies against N were present and IgM and IgG antibodies were also detectable (Fig. 3b, samples 9A and 11A) . As for GST-U274, some reactivities were observed for IgA (samples 5A, 8A, 9A, and 11A) and for IgM (sample 11A) from 5 to 11 days after the onset of illness. Interestingly, quite a strong signal for GST-U274 was observed for sample 11A (11 days after the onset of illness) when IgM was used, and for the corresponding early sample, 11B, the signal for GST-U274 was also strong (Fig. 3) .",

As shown in Table 3 , the samples were taken from 31 to 111 days after the onset of illness. Plasmapheresis products from 2 of the patients (P7 and P8) and sera from the other 59 patients were used. All of the samples showed strong immunoreactivity against the N protein (100%), and 44 of the 61 samples (72%) were positive for U274 (Table 3 ). In general, the signals observed for the U274 protein were much lower than those for the N protein. The exceptions were samples from patients 749 and 859, for which the signals for the U274 and N proteins were equally strong. Another 99 samples from healthy donors were also tested, and none of them showed any immunoreactivity to N or U274. In addition, samples from two patients (patients 868 and 873) who had close contact with probable SARS patients but never developed any of the clinical symptoms also did not show any immunoreactivity to N or U274 (Table 3) .

Detection of IgG antibodies against SARS-CoV S protein in convalescent-phase sera by immunofluorescence. Due to the large size and heavy glycosylation of the S protein, it is advantageous to express this protein in mammalian cells instead of bacteria, as it is then possible to detect antibodies that may be dependent on conformation and/or glycosylation of the S protein. CHO cells were stably transfected with a full-length S construct tagged at the C-terminal end with GFP. After selection with antibiotics, a pool of clones expressing significant levels of S protein, as indicated by GFP fluorescence, were obtained (Fig. 4) . These CHO cells were used for an immunofluorescence staining method to determine if there were IgG antibodies against the SARS-CoV S protein in convalescentphase sera. Briefly, the cells were fixed with acetone and then incubated with diluted patient sera, followed by incubation with an Rh-conjugated anti-human IgG antibody. As shown in Fig. 4 , sera from patients 1 to 6 all contained IgG antibodies against S, as detected by immunofluorescence, and no signal was observed when a control serum was used.",

For the early time points (set A), there were lower levels of IgG and IgM antibodies against N, but for two of the patients, D9 and D11, the IgA antibodies against N were present at high levels (Fig. 3b, samples 9A and 11A) . As the early time point serum from patient D9 (sample 9A) was taken at day 9 after the onset of illness, the data suggest that a high level of IgA antibodies against N can be present by this time. Taken together, all seven early samples (set A) showed immunoreactivities to the N protein, and one of the samples was taken as early as 2 days after the onset of illness (sample 2A). Finally, a third set of 61 samples from convalescent patients was 100% positive for IgG antibodies against N ( Table 3 ). These samples were collected from 31 to 111 days after the onset of illness, and the high level of IgG antibodies against N observed here is consistent with a recent report that IgG antibodies against SARS-CoV in patients persisted for \u03fe13 weeks after the onset of symptoms (7). The presence of a strong immunoreactivity towards N suggests that it may be released from the virus or infected cells into the circulation at some stage of infection or that it may be presented by antigen-presenting cells for cytotoxic killing of infected cells. We therefore speculate that IgG antibody against N may contribute to the humoral immune response protecting patients against SARS, as has been observed for other coronaviruses (13) . Future experiments will aim to address the mechanism by which N is presented as an antigen and its role in viral infection and/or replication. Our results also complement the preliminary mass spectrometric identification of N as the most immunogenic viral antigen (4). Interestingly, unlike some coronaviruses in which the M protein is most abundant, N appears to be the most abundant protein in SARS-CoV (11) . As may be expected, 100% (74 of 74) of the convalescentphase sera also showed reactivity to the large S glycoprotein, which is responsible for the petal-shaped spikes found on the surfaces of coronaviruses (6, 13) . In this case, we used fulllength S expressed in mammalian cells (CHO) to achieve proper folding and glycosylation of the protein and immunofluorescence techniques for analysis. This has some advantages over immunofluorescence using SARS-CoV-infected Vero cells, as the latter would require a biosafety level 3 facility. However, this method still needs specialized expertise and is labor-intensive and thus not suited to mass testing. Therefore, in future studies, it is important to determine the epitope(s) on the S protein that is recognized by the antibodies in patient sera, as this epitope(s) may be easier to express than the full-length S protein and may allow the development of chromatographic or enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)based diagnostic assays.",

The immunoreactivity of U274 indicates that this novel and unique viral protein is expressed and is likely to be a protein involved in the biogenesis of SARS-CoV. Moreover, a potential transcription regulating sequence was found upstream of the U274 coding sequence, suggesting that it is the first ORF for one of the major subgenomic RNAs of SARS-CoV-infected cells (9, 11) . U274 does not share any significant homology with any protein in the database, but it appears to have a similar topology to that of M, with three transmembrane regions and a large internal C-terminal domain.

Because of the fact that early-phase sera of all seven patients showed immunoreactivity to N, IgA and/or IgM offers a powerful and reliable system for the diagnosis of early infection. In addition, the presence of high levels of IgG antibodies against these proteins, in particular the N protein, in late infection or convalescent-phase sera suggests that this system would also be suitable for epidemiological studies. Further studies of sequentially bled patients in early stages of infection will be needed to characterize the development of these antibodies over time, and consequently, their utility in early infection. The N and U274 proteins can easily be expressed in bacteria and may be purified to a high degree, which might provide a better sensitivity and specificity over the current use of coarse viral lysates for serological assays, as the presence of antibodies against cellular components in viral lysates can result in false positivity. Therefore, the use of these recombinant viral antigens in a rapid chromatographic or ELISA-based kit can be expected to yield a superior diagnostic test. Due to the difficulty of expressing the S protein, the N protein appears to be the best candidate for the development of serological assays for the rapid detection of SARS-CoV infection. Indeed, the recombinant proteins S and U274 described here have been shown to work well in an ELISA format (3a) .",

However, the S protein is predicted to contain hypervariable regions, as these have been found in other coronaviruses (6, 13) , and this might pose another problem for the use of S in diagnostic assays. For the N protein, when we compared the sequences of 18 SARS isolates that were deposited in the GenBank database, we found that only two of them showed a difference, at one amino acid, from that of the Singapore isolate (SIN2774) that we used for this study (data not shown; also see reference 12). Therefore, the N protein does not appear to undergo rapid mutation, which is another advantage for its use for serological assay development. For U274, there is a slightly larger variance between the different reported sequences, with five sequences showing one amino acid substitution (when compared to SIN2774) and one sequence showing two amino acid substitutions (1). This may be one reason why fewer of the patient sera (73% compared to 100% for the N protein) reacted with the recombinant U274 protein used here.",

In summary, we have shown that antibodies against the S and N proteins are present in convalescent-phase sera from patients fulfilling the WHO case definition of probable SARS but not in sera from healthy contacts or volunteers. This observation is consistent with the finding that SARS-CoV is the causative agent of SARS. The analysis of seven pairs of sera showed that lower levels of antibodies (mainly IgM and IgA) against N were present during the acute phase of infection and that high levels of IgG antibodies were detected after 16 days or more. To date, serological diagnosis for SARS has been the most reliable method, but it requires convalescent-phase serum collected 28 days after the onset of illness to be the most accurate (http: //www.cdc.gov/ncidod/sars/testresultsc.htm) and is thus retrospective. Our data showed that IgM and/or IgA assays could help in early diagnosis. Although Li and coworkers (7) reported that patients were positive for IgM only from week 2 of illness (when assayed with coarse viral lysates), the use of recombinant N protein may increase the sensitivity of ELISA assays and allow for earlier detection.",
