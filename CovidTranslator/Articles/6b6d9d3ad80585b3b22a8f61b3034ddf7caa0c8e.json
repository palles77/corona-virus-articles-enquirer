However, despite their widespread distribution and significance, most people have never heard of Mabs or how they have both transformed healthcare and spawned an entire new industry. Produced in the laboratory, Mabs are derived from the billions of tiny antibodies made every day by our immune systems to combat substances, known as antigens, which are regarded as foreign or potentially dangerous. Millions of different types of antibodies can be found in the blood of humans and other mammals. Made by white blood cells known as B lymphocytes, each antibody is highly specific-that is, it has the ability to bind to only one particular antigen, which may be derived from bacteria, viruses, fungi, parasites, pollen, or nonliving substances, such as toxins, chemicals, drugs, or foreign particles considered alien to the body. Once antibodies have marked their antigen, they and other types of cells produced by the immune system can attack it. The field of genetically engineered therapeutic Mabs has relied on many inventions during decades of research, but two key discoveries in the mid-1970s stand out as seminal events that laid the groundwork for this field to exist as we know it today. Although Mabs were first described in 1975 (Kohler and Milstein, 1975) , only when the original rodents forms were replaced by their human equivalents did their potential as therapeutic agents began to be properly appreciated (Lonberg, 2005; Winter et al., 1994) . The reasons for this are complex, but related to a combination of perceptions including patentability, immunogenicity, effector function, and a wish to avoid undesirable side effects.",

They are routinely used in hospitals for blood type and tissue, a vital process to ensure safe blood transfusion and organ transplantation. In other cases, they are employed as research probes to determine the pathological pathway and the cause of diseases, such as cancer, autoimmune diseases, and neurological disorders. On the diagnostic front, monoclonal antibodies are intrinsic components of test kits for the detection of ovulation, pregnancy, or menopause. They are also used for analyzing body fluids for medical diagnosis, and to determine whether there has been a heart attack.",

It was developed by IDEC, and it has since merged with Biogen. Rituximab is a Mab against the protein CD20, which is primarily found on the surface of immune system B cells. Rituximab destroys B cells and is therefore used to treat diseases that are characterized by excessive numbers of B cells, overactive B cells, or dysfunctional B cells. This includes many lymphomas, leukemias, transplant rejection, and autoimmune disorders. IDEC teamed up with Genentech to get FDA approval and to comarket Rituxan. In parallel, Genentech developed Herceptin (Trastuzumab) for the treatment of breast cancer associated with the HER2/neu receptor. Herceptin was approved by the FDA in 1998 and is the first important example of personalized medicine requiring a diagnostic test to ensure efficacy, since only patients who express the Her2 gene in their breast cancer tissue have a chance to benefit from treatment with this Mab.",

High-scale production of Mabs at the industrial level could further be achieved. This has sparked a race for the development of antibody-mediated therapeutics in the clinic with the investment of large amounts of money from the biopharmaceutical sector toward that end, which is already paying off. The major success of human Mabs in immune and inflammatory conditions, such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA), Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, spondyloarthropathies, juvenile arthritis, psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis, and others (Andreakos et al., 2002) , marks merely the beginning of a rapidly evolving field with more than 150 diverse Mabs currently being evaluated in clinical trials or being candidates for approval by the FDA in the USA.",

The ideal was to develop FIGURE 25.2 Monoclonal Antibody Rituximab 3 ANTIBODY-DRUG CONjUGATES a hybrid cell line that could produce between 5 and 10 g of Mabs per liter. This demanded several steps, and even more, each requiring skill and patience. First was the creation of a hybrid cell, after which a clone secreting Mabs in high concentrations had to be selected. Then a culture medium had to be developed to encourage the optimal growth of the hybridoma. Scaling up such media was not easy in terms of quality control because they contained fifty or more ingredients, and it was important to determine how many nutrients to add. Hybridomas stop secreting Mabs, for example, if given too much glucose.",

The antibody connected to the cytotoxic warhead (drug) via a linker serves as targeted delivery system to the tumor expressing the antigen/target recognized by the antibody. Ideally, in blood, after systemic administration, this prodrug is nontoxic. Upon binding of the antibody to the targeted tumor antigen and internalization of the complex into the cancer cell, the drug is then released in its active form and in sufficient quantity to kill the cell.

For instance, if the unconjugated antibody is susceptible to deamidation or isomerization with known pH dependence, this degradation mode is also likely to be present in the ADC. These types of degradations may impact the product potency, especially if the affected residues are found in the complementarity-determining region. Much has been learned through years of experience with unconjugated antibodies about the susceptibility of various amino acid residues to chemical degradations, allowing substantial insights to be gained from examination of the protein primary sequence alone, coupled to available information about local solvent exposure and flexibility (Kosky et al., 2009; Robinson and Robinson, 2001) . It may be expected that most chemical modifications to the primary sequence of the unconjugated antibody will also occur in the ADC form. Fragmentation is another possible chemical degradation pathway for ADCs, driven by the breakage of covalent bonds between chains or within the peptide backbone. The altered physical state of the molecule following addition of the small molecule drug may result in some differences in the susceptibility of the ADC to fragmentation, but the fundamental susceptibility of the ADC to fragmentation is likely derived mostly from the Mab. A common unconjugated antibody degradation mode involves breaking the heavy chain peptide near the hinge region, leading to free Fab and Fab + Fc products (Cordoba et al., 2005) . This is still a feasible degradation pathway for ADCs as well. Comparison of fragmentation rates between conjugated and unconjugated antibodies can reveal whether the ADC form has different stability toward fragmentation.",

Nanostructures were reported to be taken up by the cells at rates 15-250 times greater than microparticles.

However, the porosity of the tumor blood vessels may vary with the tumor type (Bae, 2009) .

An antibody can be simply absorbed on the surface of a nanocarrier via hydrophobic and/or electrostatic interaction (Sokolov et al., 2003) . However, using this approach, the absorbed antibody may orient randomly on the surface and result in losing the binding affinity. Furthermore, the antibody may exchange with other endogenous protein in vivo (Nobs et al., 2004) . Therefore, antibodies are generally preferred to attach to the nanocarriers covalently (Arruebo et al., 2009 ). An antibody consists of a number of functional groups that provides many options for bioconjugation (Manjappa et al., 2011) . Bioconjugation can take place by means of adsorption (at the isoelectrical point of the antibody via electrostatic interaction), by direct covalent linkage between the surface of the nanoparticle and the antibody, or by using adapter molecules.",

These particles were efficiently internalized into hematopoietic and neural progenitor cells in quantities up to 10-30 pg of superparamagnetic iron per cell. Iron incorporation did not affect cell viability, differentiation, or proliferation of CD34 + cells. Following intravenous injection into immunodeficient mice, 4% of magnetically CD34 + cells homed to bone marrow per gram of tissue, and single cells could be detected by magnetic resonance imaging in tissue samples. In addition, magnetically labeled cells that had homed to bone marrow could be recovered by magnetic separation columns. Localization and retrieval of cell populations in vivo enable detailed analysis of specific stem cell and organ interactions critical for advancing the therapeutic use of stem cells (Lewin et al., 2000) . Nanomaterials with fluorescent properties or nanoparticles labeled/encapsulated with fluorescent dyes have also been applied for microbial detection. Using antibody-conjugated silica nanoparticles, these materials can be used as a superior signaling element, to detect cells, proteins and bacteria in an immunoassay (Grifantini et al., 2002; Tan et al., 2004) .",

Thousands of fluorescent dye molecules are encapsulated in a protective silica matrix, resulting in a nanoparticle with an amplified and reproducible signal for fluorescence-based bioanalysis. Whereas in conventional immunoassays only one or a few dye molecules are linked to an antibody molecule and then used to signal an antibody-antigen interaction event, the bioconjugated nanoparticles, which are attached to the antibody molecule, are enabled to carry many dye molecules inside, allowing a significant amplification of the analytical signal. Furthermore, bacteria present many surface antigens available for antibody recognition, and, therefore, a greatly amplified signal can be achieved since thousands of nanoparticles can attach to each bacterium. These bioconjugated nanoparticles allow the detection of a bacterium cell per given sample just in 20 min with a spectrofluorometer.",

Nanotechnology in the field of cancer has the potential to improve the monitoring of therapeutic efficacy, provide novel methods for the detection and profiling of cancers at early stages, and allow surgeons to delineate tumor margins and sentinel lymph nodes. Nanomaterials have unique features that are attractive and can be applied to biosensing. The development of various nanomaterials and nanotechnology has enabled detection of cancer biomarkers with great precision and sensitivity that could not be achieved before. Many studies are being conducted on developing sensing mechanisms that will push down the detection limit as far down as possible (Anajwala et al., 2010) . Ligand-free nano-formulations generally possess passive targeting property with little tissue specificity. To address these limitations, research has been continued to advance active or specific targeting to enhance the efficacy of anticancer therapeutic agents, as well as to reduce the toxicity to nontargeted healthy tissues. Nanoparticles containing the chemotherapeutic agents are specifically designed to target the cancerous cells either by ligand receptor interaction or antibody-antigen recognition. Highly specific Mabs are used to strengthen the immune response and to intensify the immune system's antitumor capacity. Moreover, Mabs are highly specific when attached to nanoparticles to aid in targeted delivery of various antitumor cytotoxic agents or function themselves as effective therapeutic agents (Sutradhar and Amin, 2014) . There are different ways of destroying cancer cells with Mabs: directly by inducing apoptosis, blocking growth factor receptors or inducing the formation of antiidiotype, and indirectly by activating complement-mediated cellular cytotoxicity and antibody dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity .",

Although mouse Mabs have been used for making targeted nanoparticles, strong cross-species immune responses limit their potential for future clinical translation. Currently only a few types of humanized Mabs, such as HER-2 antibody (Herceptin), are available for the production of targeted nanoparticles (Slamon and Pegram, 2001) . Alternatively, high affinity recombinant antibody fragments have been developed as targeting ligands (Yang et al., 2015) . For example, a human single chain antibody against the epidermal growth factor receptor (ScFvEGFR) that is highly expressed in the majority of epithelial tumors was conjugated to different types of nanoparticles. Specificity of tumor imaging and targeted therapeutic effects of these nanoparticles have been demonstrated in several animal tumor models (Yang et al., 2015) . The major advantages of using natural ligands for tumor targeting are their high binding affinity, specificity, and, most importantly, low immunogenicity. Owen et al. (2013) reported higher antibody-conjugated lysosomal P (LA-co-TMCC)-g-PEG-furan micellar concentration in HER2 positive cell lines with significant cellular distribution resulting in two-to threefold increase in lysosomal accumulation compared to using the antibody alone (Owen et al., 2013) . In addition, Nobs et al. (2004) reported that thiol functionalized anti-HER2 Mab can be conjugated with the maleimide containing liposomes. Internalization of these antibody coupled immunoliposomes by HER2 positive breast cancer cell line (SK-BR-3) was observed with enhanced effects compared to the control liposomes (Nobs et al., 2004) . Many authors observed that the use of lisposomes was more effective in vitro than in vivo. To prove targeted drug-loaded liposome as an effective and safe treatment option for HER2 positive breast cancer, more in vivo studies need to be conducted.",

            "text": "Topical delivery is a relatively easy and a less risky method of drug administration. However, delivery to the posterior segment via this route is considered inefficient and unsuccessful, since less than 5% of the topically applied dose enters the eye and an even smaller fraction of it (0.001%) is expected to reach the posterior segment. Intravitreal administration involves the direct administration of drug solution/suspension into vitreous humor via pars plana using a 30-G needle. In contrast to the topical Roth et al. (2007) and systemic routes, intravitreal injection makes high concentrations of drug locally available to the internal eye tissue, including the choroid and the retina. Similarly, the intravitreal administration of Macugen (pegaptanib sodium; Pfizer) and Lucentis (ranibizumab; Genentech/Novartis), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) inhibitors, is highly successful for the control of AMD. However, agents with molecular weight less than 500 Da when applied intravitreally tend to be drained off from the site of application with a half-life of less than 3 days, indicating a need for repetitive injections. Anyway, the period requiring a repeat dose may extend from a few days to several months for macromolecular antibodies. For example, three is the mean number of injections of bevacizumab (Avastin; Roche) required to be administered per year for the treatment of AMD. On the other hand, the recommended dosing frequency of ranibizumab (Lucentis) is once a month (0.5 mg; 50 \u00b5L) for at least 9 months (Rosenfeld et al., 2006) , whereas pegaptanib sodium (Macugen) needs to be injected intravitreally at 6-week intervals for 1 year (Kitagawa and Yuzawa, 2013) . Nevertheless, repetitive intravitreal injections, even if spaced widely, are invariably associated with complications, such as vitreous hemorrhage, retinal detachment, cataract, and endophthalmitis. The rate of endophthalmitis and retinal detachment being observed with intravitreal injection is 0.2 and 0.05%, respectively (Edelhauser et al., 2010) . Moreover, patient compliance is lower with such regimens because of the painful and invasive procedures requiring hospitalization and specially trained physician for administration, in addition to the high cost of the medicine per se (Kaur and Kakkar, 2014) .",

Another reason why Mabs are so expensive is the fact that many of them are still protected by patents. A drug's patent life is 20 years from the date of filing, in order to help developers recover some of the research and development costs involved in getting a drug to market.

In addition, Mabs need to be administered by intravenous or subcutaneous injection, unlike other antiinfectives that can be taken orally, so they are unsuitable for patients in developing countries who have limited access to healthcare. Mabs are also more effective at preventing infection rather than treating established ones, and unlike vaccines provide only short-term prophylaxis.

One solution might lie in the use of a cocktail of Mabs to target the diverse range of antigens that viruses carry. Such a strategy would effectively mimic the natural immune response: once infected, the body tends to develop several antibodies in response to the antigens presented by a virus, each of which attaches to one of the different antigens. It is this diversity of antibodies that helps the immune system in fighting the invader. The use of a cocktail of Mabs is already being investigated for the treatment for rabies Recent advances in Mab engineering have opened up new opportunities for serum therapy. Importantly, Mabs offer the means to prepare standardized agents, which, when combined in a cocktail, can yield a product that is more precise and more potent than traditional serum therapy. To date, the development of antiinfective Mab products has attracted little commercial investment. In part this is because infectious diseases are short-lived and therefore have a limited market. This is in contrast to chronic conditions like cancer and autoimmune diseases, which require regular treatment and therefore have greater profit potential. Nonetheless, the pharmaceutical climate is changing, fueled by concern over the rise in new pathogens (such as West Nile and corona viruses); the reemergence of old pathogens (like tuberculosis), increasing antibiotic resistance among microorganisms; and the rise of superbugs like MRSA, as well as the growing epidemic of patients who are immunocompromised as a result of HIV infection, organ transplantation, chronic degenerative diseases, and improvements in cancer care.",

This has transformed the care of cancer patients, who no longer face the prospect of losing hair and other serious side effects associated with other cytotoxic drugs. The advantage of Mabs is that they can be given as maintenance therapies. This is reshaping our perceptions of some cancers from what was once seen as inevitably fatal to a chronic condition. Mabs have also enabled the prescription of specific therapeutics for particular tumor antigens in individual patients. This allows a greater degree of personalization in the management of cancer than in the past. Indeed, Mabs are expected to be an increasingly important component in personalized cancer therapies.",
