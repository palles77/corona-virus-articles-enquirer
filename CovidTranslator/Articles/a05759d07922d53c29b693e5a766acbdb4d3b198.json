GFP/6-labeled vesicles co-localized lacking the first or second halves of the hydrophobic domain (GFP/6\u220624-32 and GFP/6\u220633-42), accumulated strongly with BiP in 87.5% of cells (n \u03ed 64) that contained both GFP/6 fluorescence and anti-BiP immunofluores-throughout the bombarded cell cytoplasm and nucleus in cence. In some cells, however, GFP/6-containing structures reacted with a single protein of~70 kDa, as anticipated, whereas the anti-\u03b2-xylosyl serum reacted with numerous that lacked detectable BiP were also detected ( Figure  6A ). Vesicles containing GFP/6 co-localized strongly with proteins (data not shown). Reaction of anti-\u03b2-xylosyl serum with numerous proteins was expected, as this \u03b2-xylosyl-containing proteins in only 9.2% of cells (n \u03ed 87); the remaining cells (90.8%) contained little or no antiserum recognizes a carbohydrate moiety added to proteins traversing, or residing within, the Golgi apparatus detectable co-localization ( Figure 6B ). Protoplasts treated with Cy3-labeled secondary antibody but no primary (Lauri\u00e8re et al., 1989; Zhang and Staehlin, 1992) . The first series of gradients were carried out in the antibody exhibited GFP/6 fluorescence but no Cy3 fluorescence ( Figure 6C ). These results suggest that a high presence of 3 mM MgCl 2 , which preserves the integrity of ribosomes associated with rough ER (RER) (Lord et al., proportion of GFP/6-containing vesicles contain protein associated with the ER. 1973; Wienecke et al., 1982) . Non-fused GFP from TEV-GFP-infected tissue remained at the top of the sucrose To characterize further the membranes to which the 6 kDa protein attaches, sucrose gradients were used to gradient ( Figure 7B ), which is consistent with its localization in the cytosol.

Membranes from half-leaves were GFP/6-infected tissue, however, sedimented to a position near the bottom of the gradient ( Figure 7C ; peak fractions extracted and analyzed on sucrose gradients under high (3 mM) or low (0.1 mM) MgCl 2 conditions.

Two BiP-containing gradient fractions were analyzed by immunoblot assay using anti-GFP, anti-BiP and anti-\u03b2-xylosyl sera. The peaks were resolved, one near the top and one near the bottom of the gradient ( Figure 7D ), the latter of which specificity of anti-GFP serum was tested in preliminary experiments using total SDS-soluble protein extracts and was coincident with the GFP/6-containing peak. The heavy BiP-containing fractions contained rRNA (data not shown) sucrose gradient fractions from non-infected plants, and using total proteins from TEV-GFP-infected and TEV-and were present in the gradient at positions consistent with previous analyses of ER from plants (Wienecke et al., GFP/6-infected plants. No reactivity was detected in total extracts or in any sucrose gradient fraction recovered from 1982). The heavy peak, therefore, was concluded to contain ER membranes, with at least some of the mem-non-infected plants ( Figure 7A ). Single proteins of the sizes predicted for GFP and GFP/6 were detected in total brane associated with ribosomes. The nature of the light BiP-containing peak was not determined.

The membrane may provide a scaffolding than in the previous experiments.
