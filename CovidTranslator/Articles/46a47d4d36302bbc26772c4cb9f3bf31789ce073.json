Furthermore, the ability of HNSCC cells to migrate and invade results in significant regional and distant metastasis and poor patient survival.

CD147 allows for oncogenic cells to interact with supporting cells, such as fibroblasts and endothelial cells, resulting in increased expression of matrix metalloproteinases (MMP) and hyaluronan and upregulation of vascular endothelial growth factor [5, [9] [10] [11] .

            "text": "The tumor microenvironment also contains the secreted peptide AGR2. Elevation of AGR2 expression has been found in malignancies arising from a variety of anatomical sites, including the esophagus, breast, prostate, pancreas, lung and ovaries [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] . Furthermore, AGR2 was found to enhance breast cancer metastasis in xenografts [31] . While the exact function of AGR2 is, for the most part, unknown, it is believed that AGR2 acts as a chaperone, guiding misfolded proteins out of the cell [32, 33] . Several investigations into tumor progression have found AGR2 has a role in promoting cell migration and invasion [22, 23, 31, 34] . To this end we investigated if there was a link between these proteins, CD147 and AGR2, and metastasis of HNSCC cells.",

Cytoplasmic immunoreactivity of AGR2 correlated with membranous expression of CD147 in all but one specimen (95%, n=19).

            "text": "It is well known HNSCC cells have a propensity to invade and migrate resulting in a high incidence of regional and distant metastasis, decreasing survival and prognosis. It is becoming increasingly evident that the ability of oncogenic cells to migrate and invade is dependent on a complex set of interactions with components of the tumor microenvironment. CD147, a highly glycosylated transmembrane protein, behaves as a coordinator for oncogenic cell migration and invasion via regulation of essential molecular events necessary for carcinogenesis [10] . Following malignant transformation of a normal cell into an oncogenic cell, CD147 facilitates each phase of oncogenesis. CD147 promotes proliferation, induces VEGF expression and angiogenesis, stimulates proteolytic enzyme expression and enables anchorage-independent growth [5, 9, 12, [41] [42] [43] [44] . As a result, oncogenic cells are able to migrate, invade and metastasize [1, 10, 44, 45] . AGR2, a secreted peptide, has also been found to promote growth and metastasis and allow for anchorageindependent growth. Therefore, in tumorigenesis there may be a collaborative relationship between AGR2 and CD147 [22] . In this study, we demonstrated HNSCC cell proliferation, tumor growth rate and metastasis was reduced by a reduction in either CD147 or AGR2 expression.",

HNSCC cells crosstalk with supporting cells, such as fibroblasts, in the tumor microenvironment to promote MMP expression [8, 46, 47] . CD147 facilitates cell invasion by induction of proteases (MMPs) which degrade and remodel the extracellular matrix [5] . The result is oncogenic cells are able to traverse the basement membrane and extracellular matrix and invade regional and distant tissues. In accordance, CD147 expression has been found to be significantly higher at the invasive front of HNSCC specimens relative to the more differentiated core [10] . Several of the HNSCC specimens in this study demonstrated similar findings, with high CD147 expression by the oncogenic cells located near the invading edge. In order to simulate a basement membrane in vitro, we coated porous membranes with basement membrane extracts containing type IV collagen, laminin, entactin and heparin sulfate proteoglycan. Relative to vector control, knockdown of CD147 and AGR2 significantly reduced the ability of HNSCC cells to invade and traverse the basement membrane (p < 0.0001). Furthermore, the addition of AGR2 to the media did not increase the number of invading vector control cells. However, AGR2 supplemented media did increase the number of invading knockdown cells relative to those cells exposed to unsupplemented media (p < 0.05). Additionally, those knockdown cells exposed to a higher concentration of AGR2 demonstrated higher rates of invasion (Fig. 3B ). This suggests that AGR2 is a critical element of the invasion phenotype of HNSCC cells.",

The expression patterns of CD147 and AGR2 in HNSCC were evaluated by immunofluorescence analysis of oral cavity squamous cell carcinoma specimens (n=20). Approximately half of the oncogenic cells demonstrated CD147 expression while close to a third demonstrated AGR2 immunoreactivity. CD147 expression was primarily membranous, while AGR2 immunoreactivity was predominately cytoplasmic. Western blot analysis (A) of protein expression levels verified knockdown of CD147 expression by OSC-19/siE and FADU/siE and knockdown of AGR2 expression by OSC-19/ siA and FADU/siA cell lines relative to vector control (VC). Additionally, knockdown of CD147 correlated with an absence of AGR2 expression. Treatment of vector control cells with anti-CD147 (Tx) had no effect on CD147 or AGR2 expression levels. Proliferation of OSC-19 and FADU vector control and knockdown (siE, siA1, siA3) cell lines (B) was assessed following 48 h \u00b1 anti-CD147 (200 \u03bcg/mL). Relative to vector control, a reduction of CD147 or AGR2 expression resulted in a significant decrease in cell proliferation. There was a reduction in proliferation of OSC-19/VC and FADU/VC cell lines following treatment with anti-AGR2 (C). Columns, mean for triplicate; bars, SE. Migration and invasion were evaluated by a transwell chamber system. Reduction in CD147 or AGR2 expression significantly decreased both migration and invasion of OSC-19 and FADU knockdown cells compared to vector control (A). Addition of AGR2 to the media did not affect migration (B) or invasion (C) of OSC-19/VC or FADU/VC cell lines. However, supplementing the media with either 50 or 200 ng/mL of AGR2 significantly increased both migration (B) and invasion (C) of both the OSC-19 and FADU knockdown CD147 and AGR2 cell lines. Statistical significance by unpaired t-test, ****p<0.0001. Columns, mean for triplicate; bars, SE. . Targeted fluorescence imaging assisted in localization of primary disease and lymph node metastasis (C). Microscopically, regional lymph node metastases were detected in all OSC-19 xenografts. However, there was a significant difference in the number of positive lymph nodes of the knockdown cells relative to vector control (D).

Orthotopic OSC-19 xenografts were divided into two cohorts: control and anti-CD147 treatment. Anti-CD147 treatment (200 \u03bcg i.p./triweekly) was begun on the day of tumor cell implantation. By day 8, there was a significant reduction in tumor growth rate (A). The incidence of positive lymph nodes was similar between the two cohorts (B). However, none of the mice in treatment cohort had evidence of bilateral lymph node (BLN) metastasis while 60% (n=3) had positive BLN in the control group (B). Lysates of primary lesions were prepared for western blot and zymogram analysis. There was a trend toward decreased CD147 (C) and AGR2 (B) expression in the treatment group. Furthermore, there was a significant decrease in MMP2 expression in the treatment cohort (E). Statistical significance by unpaired t-test, *p<0.05, **p<0.01.
