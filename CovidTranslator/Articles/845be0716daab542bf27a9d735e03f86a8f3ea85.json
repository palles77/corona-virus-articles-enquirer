We designed and evaluated a panel based on this principle to rapidly identify the presence of common disease agents in dogs and horses with acute respiratory illness. This manuscript describes a nanoscale diagnostic PCR workflow for sample preparation, amplification, and analysis of target pathogen sequences, focusing on procedures that are different from microliter scale reactions. In the respiratory panel presented, 18 assays were each set up in triplicate, accommodating up to 48 samples per plate. A universal extraction and pre-amplification workflow was optimized for high-throughput sample preparation to accommodate multiple matrices and DNA and RNA based pathogens. Representative data are presented for one RNA target (influenza A matrix) and one DNA target (equine herpesvirus 1). The ability to quickly and accurately test for a comprehensive, syndrome-based group of pathogens is a valuable tool for improving efficiency and ergonomics of diagnostic testing and for acute respiratory disease diagnosis and management.",

            "text": "With the demand for rapid and comprehensive detection of multiple agents in clinical diagnostics for humans and animals, single-organism molecular diagnostic methods for pathogen detection are burdensome unless used for large numbers of samples being tested for a single disease. In the veterinary context, high-throughput diagnostic methodologies are particularly important due to the additional need for covering pathogens from a wide variety of species. OneHealth approaches for management of food-borne disease and emerging pathogen surveillance are examples of testing needs that include a number of bacteria, viruses (DNA or RNA based), parasites, and fungi. The challenge to combining tests for multiple analytes together (multiplexing) in order to improve testing efficiency is a possible loss of sensitivity and a large burden for optimization and validation of assays.",

Based on the concept of spatial multiplexing, every sample is tested for a large number of targets in separate through-holes. This platform was initially used with cyanine-based double-stranded DNA binding chemistry 2 and is now available for probe-based chemistry using dark quenching probes 3 . This platform has primarily been used for genetic profiling in humans 4 and animals 5 .

In the optimization of this protocol (not shown), we compared a number of preamplification parameters including the master mix, addition of random primers, number of cycles, annealing time, and dilution prior to amplification. Each target had its own optimal conditions, and those described here represent those that yielded the best limit of detection overall for our panel. This panel covers a wide range of pathogenic targets and sample types that are encountered in routine veterinary diagnostic testing, but modifications to the preamplification procedures may be necessary for different panels. The manufacturer-optimized amplification conditions are based on a standard probe-based real-time PCR protocol with a 10 min at 95 \u00b0C enzyme activation followed by denaturation at 95 \u00b0C and annealing/extension at 60 \u00b0C. The primers and probes are pre-printed on the plates also using manufacturer-optimized conditions and therefore do not require titration. Combining the reverse-transcription and preamplification steps for all samples (regardless of the type of target) was necessary in order to maintain efficiency in the workflow. Having all samples reverse transcribed is also beneficial for maximizing sensitivity. Furthermore, use of a master mix for the preamp that is optimized for minimizing inhibitors allows versatility in combining different sample types on the same plate.",

This was likely due to the sub-optimal melting temperature (T m ) of the primers, which should ideally be 58-60 \u00b0C (the ideal probe Tm is 68-70 \u00b0C). A limitation of this platform is that it takes longer to design and manufacture the plates than for ordering individual probes, which limits the ability to quickly modify sequences. Another limitation of real-time PCR in general is the inability to detect novel or unexpected pathogens. This can be overcome to some extent by designing assays that match sequences in multiple species, but unbiased whole genome sequencing based methodologies are more suited for discovery of novel agents. 11, 12 Nanoscale real-time PCR allows a new paradigm for syndrome-based rather than species-based testing, which is useful for reducing reagent and labor costs in high-throughput molecular diagnostics. Large-scale panel testing by this approach can facilitate OneHealth surveillance efforts such as those described by Dunne and Gurfield 13 and Moutailler et al. 14 . Collection of swab samples early, generally within 3 days of clinical onset, provides the best chance to identify the presence of respiratory pathogens. Infectious disease emergence is often unpredictable, and tests that can be performed on different species without the need for modification of reagents are ideal for preparedness. Future applications of this technology are likely to be in pathotyping, antimicrobial resistance profiling, and further syndrome-based clinical diagnostic panels. Nanoscale real-time PCR is most useful for rapid, high-throughput screening of multiple sample and pathogen types, and would be complemented by unbiased or partially biased sequencing-based approaches for identifying new and emergent pathogens.",
