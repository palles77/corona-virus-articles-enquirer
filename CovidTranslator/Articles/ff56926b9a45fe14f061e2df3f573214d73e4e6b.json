The viral structural proteins (gp200, gp140/gp66, gpl00/gpl20, p52, and gp24/p20) were detected in radiolabeled cell extracts by 9 to 12 hours post-infection, as well as two possible non-structural proteins with apparent mol.wts, of 36,000 and 32,000. The predominant 52,000 nucleocapsid protein could be detected in cell lysates as soon as 6 to 8 hours after infection; it was initially resolved as a complex of 3 closely migrating species with mol.wts, ranging from 46,000 to 52,000. Pulse-chase and immunoprecipitation experiments indicated that gp200 arose from a putative precursor with mol.wt, of 150,000 to 170,000, that underwent glycosylation. Proteolytic cleavage of gp 200, in turn, probably yielded the gp 100 and gp 120 species. The unique TCV hemagglutinin protein originated from a primary precursor with mol.wt, of 60,000, which underwent rapid dimerization by disulfide bond formation and glycosylation to yield gp 140. The peplomeric and matrix proteins were both shown to be N-glycosylated, as indicated by their sensitivity to tunicamycin (TM) and their resistance to sodium monensin (SM). In the presence of TM, proteins with mol.wts, of 90,000, 120-130,000, and 150,000 accumulated in TCV-infected cells rather than peplomeric glycoproteins, and the matrix protein E 1 was only detected in its unglycosylated form. The addition of TM to the culture medium interfered with the maturation of progeny viral particles, as suggested by the absence of peplomers at the surface of the intravacuolar and extracellular virions, and the accumulation of amorphous material not found in the absence of the glycosylation inhibitor. High yields of virus replication were obtained, in the presence of SM, even at concentrations which greatly affected the cellular functions. 240 S. Dea et al.",

            "text": "The coronavirus virion possesses two or three major envelope glycoproteins [40] . The latter are synthesized from different virus-specific subgenomic RNAs which are translated at the level Of membrane-bound ribosomes [34, 35] , and then undergo post-translational processing at the level of rough endoplasmic reticulum or Golgi apparatus [40, 42] . The peplomeric (E2) protein precursors of mouse hepatitis (MHV) and avian infectious bronchitis (IBV) viruses are cotranslationally N-glycosylated and have then an apparent mol.wt, of 150,000 [27, 32, 36] . The polypeptides synthesized in vitro or in tunicamycin-treated cells have a mol.wt, of approximately 120,000 [3, 28, 33] . This agrees with the mol.wts, of the polypeptide moieties predicted from nucleotide sequences of their E2 genes [1, 20, 31] . A glycoprotein with a mol.wt, of approximately 170,000 has been identified as the intracellular precursor of the E2 protein of bovine enteric coronavirus (BCV), and hemagglutinating mammalian coronavirus [9, 10] . Unglycosylated precursors have not been yet identified for BCV, but concomitant with the loss of its surface projections, the virus is neither infectious nor hemagglutinating, after cultivation in the presence of TM [10] . Following further glycosylation, the peplomeric protein of these coronaviruses undergoes proteolytic cleavage to yield two subunits with mol.wts, of 85-100,000 [9, 20, 41] . This proteolytic cleavage is a host-cell dependent event and is required for activation of the cell-fusing activity, and therefore appears to be an important determinant of viral pathogenesis [12] . The precursor proteins to the BCV hemagglutinating protein (gp 124/gp62) are gp59 (monomer) and gp 118 (disulfide-linked dimer) [9, 10] .",

Therefore, the glycosylation process of the p20-23 intracellular precursors does not depend on transfer of oligosaccharides from dolichol phosphate intermediates and is not inhibited by tunicamycin, but by sodium monensin, an inhibitor of the Golgi function [18, 27] .

In contrast, the addition of 0.5 to 2.5 ~tM sodium monensin did not interfere with Tunicamycin at a concentration of 0.5 lag/ml slightly decreased the overall intracellular protein synthesis, as suggested by the intensity of bands of [35S]methionine-labeled proteins resolved by SDS-PAGE of cell lysates. Polypeptides corresponding to TCV peplomeric glycoproteins showed a drastic decrease in their apparent molecular weights, yielding 90,000, 120-130,000, and 150,000 polypeptide species (Fig. 3 A, arrowheads) . These new intracellular polypeptides were also resolved by Western immunoblotting (Fig. 3 B) . Radioim-munoprecipitation experiments using the anti-TCV hyperimmune serum, after [35S]methionine and [3H]glucosamine labeling, confirmed the absence of the peplomeric glycoproteins from TM-treated cells, whereas the relative amount of the unglycosylated high mol.wt, polypeptide species increased (Fig. 4A, lanes  5 and 7) . A major non-glycosylated polypeptide having a mol.wt, of 60,000 was also revealed in the presence of TM.",

In addition to the peplomeric and matrix glycoproteins, TCV virions contain an envelope glycoprotein, having a mol.wt, of 140,000, which behaves as a disulfide-linked dimer of 60-65,000 subunits, and which has been associated to the hemagglutinin (accompanying paper). In this paper, we described the identification of virus-induced intracellular polypeptides in TCV-infected HRT-18 cells, the kinetic of their synthesis, their post-translational processing in the presence of glycosylation inhibitors and their significance with respect to the production of mature virions. We found that TCV had a modest inhibitory effect on cell protein synthesis, making the analysis of virus-specific proteins difficult. Nevertheless, new intracellular protein species could be detected as soon as 6 h post-infection either by SDS-PAGE analysis of pulse-labeled TCV-infected cell extracts or by Western-immunoblotting, using anti-TCV hyperimmune serum produced to the eggadapted Minnesota strain. The TCV structural proteins were all detected by 9 h post-infection, in agreement with the one-step growth curve that was determined in a previous study [7] and the replication cycle of coronaviruses [40] . At least 12 to 14 polypeptides immunoprecipitated from lysates of TCVinfected cells. Six of these polypeptides, with approximate mol.wts, of t 50-170,000, 130,000, 90,000, 48,000, 46,000, and 30-32,000, did not co-migrate with virion proteins. Although a definitive relationship could not be established among these various intracellular polypeptides, pulse-chased experiments and analysis of infected cell extracts after cultivation in the presence of glycosylation inhibitors suggested that some of these products correspond to intracellular precursors, cleavage products or aggregated forms of structural glycoproteins.",

Whether these two intracetlular polypeptides are in fact related remains to be demonstrated. It may be possible that a certain amount of a primary E2 apoprotein is cleaved and then further glycosylated to give the final gp 100-120. A recent study on the intracellular processing of measles virus F and HA proteins demonstrated that glycosylation was essential to the post-translation proteolytic cleavage to proceed [30] . Similarly, results obtained with coronavirus MHV-A59 have suggested that the proteolytic cleavage of E2 was a post-translational event that occured only after assembling of the virion and further processing of the E2 protein in the Golgi apparatus [-12, 20, 273 . With TCV, gp 100 and gp 120 species were also demonstrated after treatment with monensin, an inhibitor of the Golgi function, suggesting that the first glycosylation acquired in the RER may be sufficient.",

Non-glycosylated polypeptides with apparent mol.wts, of 120-130,000 and 150,000 were immunoprecipitated from extracts of TCV-infected, TM-treated cells. The new intracellular polypeptides were also identified by Western-immunoblotting. Although a definitive precursor-final product relationship was not demonstrated with E2 or E 3, the latter were not synthesized in the presence of TM. This was confirmed by radiolabeling with glucosamine and by EM. Both surface glycoproteins of the TCV virions thus possess N-linked oligosaccharides. The observation that the nonglycosylated polypeptides were only detected in the presence of this glycosylation inhibitor indicated that glycosylation of the E2 and E3 was initiated at the co-translational level. This is, again, typical for N-glycosidic linkages. The accumulation of amorphous material in the cysternae of TCV-infected, TM-treated cells may result from the rapid degradation of these putative non-glycosylated precursors. Monensin has been shown to produce an intra Golgi blockade of a number of secretory proteins by collapsing the hydrogen ion gradient across cellular membranes [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] . It thus blocks \"O\" glycosylation, but not N-glycosylation which occurs in the RER. The 100K and t40K species were heavily labeled with glucosamine in the presence of monensin, which further supported the results obtained with TM.",

The absence in the same gel of the 36-42,000 mol.wt, species, probably corresponding to an aggregated form of E1 [10, 15, 38, 39] , and the presence of E1 in lysates of TCV-infected, SM-treated cells, further supported this notion. In this respect, TCV differs from viruses of the subgroup of mammalian hemagglutinating coronaviruses [9, 18] , but resembles IBV [2, 3, 37] . Whereas glycosylation of glycoproteins with N-glycosidic linkages is generally initiated at the co-translational level, glycosylation of E 1 of TCV appears to be exclusively a posttranslational event. This is suggested by the observation that apoprotein precursor of E 1 (p20) was present in TCV-infected cells prior gp24. For TCV and IBV, E 1 therefore constitutes an example of a membrane glycoprotein that is targeted to the ER and is not subsequently directed further along the secretory pathway. As previously reported for IBV and MHV [3, 16, 37] , E 1 appeared to be the only glycoprotein required for the formation of TCV virions, and its glycosylation is apparently not essential [3, 37] . Arrest of virus budding, as demonstrated in MHV-infected cells cultivated in the presence of monensin [23] , was not demonstrated in TCV-infected cells in the presence of TM. This strengthens the notion that glycosylation of E 1 is not necessary for virus budding.",
