Cell tropism and host range is determined in part by the coronavirus spike (S) protein 4 , which binds cellular receptors and mediates membrane fusion. As the largest known class I fusion protein, its size and extensive glycosylation have hindered structural studies of the full ectodomain, thus preventing a molecular understanding of its function and limiting development of effective interventions. Here we present the 4.0 \u00c5 resolution structure of the trimeric HKU1 S protein determined using singleparticle cryo-electron microscopy. In the pre-fusion conformation, the receptor-binding subunits, S1, rest above the fusion-mediating subunits, S2, preventing their conformational rearrangement. Surprisingly, the S1 C-terminal domains are interdigitated and form extensive quaternary interactions that occlude surfaces known in other coronaviruses to bind protein receptors. These features, along with the location of the two protease sites known to be important for coronavirus entry, provide a structural basis to support a model of membrane fusion mediated by progressive S protein destabilization through receptor binding and proteolytic cleavage. These studies should also serve as a foundation for the structure-based design of betacoronavirus vaccine immunogens.",

Like other class I viral fusion proteins, the two subunits trimerize and fold into a metastable pre-fusion conformation. The S1 subunit is responsible for receptor binding, while the S2 subunit mediates membrane fusion. Coronaviruses typically possess two domains within S1 capable of binding to host receptors: an amino (N)-terminal domain (NTD) and a carboxy (C)-terminal domain (CTD), with the latter recognizing protein receptors for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV 6,7 . Although these individual domains have been structurally characterized, the organization of the complete spike has not yet been determined, preventing a mechanistic understanding of S protein function.",

The CTD is located at the trimer apex close to the threefold axis, and the core interacts with the other two S1 CTD cores and with one NTD from an adjacent protomer.

Structural alignment of the SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV CTD-receptor complexes 11, 12 with the HKU1 pre-fusion S protein reveals that the protein-receptor-binding surface of the S1 CTD is buried in the HKU1 S protein trimer and is therefore incapable of making equivalent interactions without some initial breathing and transient exposure of these domains (Fig. 2b) . a, A single protomer of the trimeric S protein is shown in cartoon representation coloured as a rainbow from the N to C terminus (blue to red) with the reconstructed EM density of remaining protomers shown in white and grey. b, The S1 subunit is composed of the NTD and CTD as well as two sub-domains (SD-1 and SD-2).

HKU1 S1 also contains two sub-domains (which we term SD-1 and SD-2) that lack significant homology to previously determined structures (Fig. 2c, d) . These sub-domains are primarily composed of S1 amino acid sequences following the CTD. However, stretches of amino acids preceding the CTD as well as S2 residues adjacent to the S1/S2 cleavage site also contribute to the sub-domains.

The fusion peptide forms a short helix and a loop, with most of the hydrophobic amino acids buried in an interface with other elements of S2. Unlike influenza HA where the C terminus of the fusion peptide is only 14 amino acids away from the N terminus of HR1, the fusion peptide of HKU1 S is 60 amino acids away from HR1. This span of protein contains four short \u03b1-helices and several longer regions lacking regular secondary structure.

The post-fusion six-helix bundle structures of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV S2 heptad repeats 22,23 reveal that coronavirus S proteins also undergo a similar transition (Fig. 3c) . However, the S protein must carry out five such loop-to-helix transitions, highlighting the complexity of S proteins relative to other class I fusion proteins. In addition, the membrane distal regions of the pre-fusion S2 central three-helix bundle (S2 amino acids 1070-1076), which is the C-terminal portion of HR1, are splayed outwards from the threefold axis (Extended Data Fig. 7 ). In the available coronavirus post-fusion HR1-HR2 structures, this portion of HR1 forms a tight three-helix bundle 22,23 . Formation of this three-helix bundle may be prevented by interactions between the C-terminal end of the S2 HR1 and the S1 CTD, and thus disruption of these interactions through receptorinduced conformational changes would provide an additional means by which receptor binding in S1 can initiate S2-mediated membrane fusion.

Three hours after this plasmid was transfected into FreeStyle 293-F cells (Invitrogen), kifunensine was added to a final concentration of 5 \u03bcM. FreeStyle 293-F cells are a high-transfection-efficiency cell line adapted for suspension culture derived from low passage clonal cultures and after purchase were not further authenticated. Cells were not confirmed to be free of mycoplasma, but were only used for protein expression. Cultures were harvested after six days, and protein was purified from the medium using Ni-NTA Superflow resin (Qiagen). The buffer was then exchanged using a HiPrep 26/10 desalting column (GE Healthcare Biosciences) from a high-imidazole elution buffer to a low pH buffer (20 mM Bis-Tris pH 6.5, 150 mM NaCl). Afterward, endoglycosidase H (EndoH) (10% w/w) and HRV3C protease (1% w/w) were added to the protein and the reaction was incubated overnight at 4 \u00b0C. The digested protein was further purified using a Superose 6 16/70 column (GE Healthcare Biosciences). The furin-cleaved HKU1 S construct analysed by negative-stain EM was similar to the one described above except that it encoded residues 1-1249 and contained the wild-type RRKRR furin-recognition site. Expression and purification were also similar, except that a plasmid expressing furin was co-transfected into the FreeStyle 293-F cells to ensure complete processing of the protein.",

Tris-buffered saline (TBS) was used as buffer if dilution was necessary. Negative-stain electron microscopy data collection. Grids were loaded into a Tecnai T12 Spirit operating at 120 keV and imaged using a Tietz TemCam-F416 CMOS at 52,000 \u00d7 magnification at ~1.5 \u03bcm under focus. Micrographs were collected using Leginon 31 and processed within Appion 32 . Particles were picked using a difference-of-Gaussians approach 33 and aligned using reference-free 2D classification employing iterative multivariate statistical analysis/multi-reference alignment (MRA/MSA) using a binning factor of 2 to remove amorphous particles 34 . Particles in classes that did not represent views of HKU1 S proteins were discarded. ISAC 35 was used to generate a template stack from which initial 3D models were generated using the EMAN2 (ref. 36) procedure initialmodel.py. 3D models were refined using EMAN1 (ref. 37) . Sample preparation for cryo-electron microscopy. Sample solution (3 \u03bcl) was applied to the carbon face of a CF-2/2-4C C-Flat grid (Electron Microscopy Sciences, Protochips) that had been plasma cleaned for five seconds using a mixture of Ar/O 2 (Gatan Solarus 950 Plasma system). The grid was then manually blotted and immediately plunged into liquid ethane using a manual freeze plunger. Cryo-electron microscopy data collection. Movies were collected via the Leginon interface on a FEI Titan Krios operating at 300 keV mounted with a Gatan K2 direct-electron detector 31 . Each movie was collected in counting mode at 22,500 \u00d7 nominal magnification resulting in a calibrated pixel size of 1.31 \u00c5/pix at the object level. A dose rate of ~10 e \u2212 /((cam pix) \u00d7 s) was used; exposure time was 200 ms per frame. The data collection resulted in a total of 1,049 movies containing 50 frames each. Total dose per movie was 57 e \u2212 /\u00c5 2 . Data were collected at 1.0 to 3.5 \u03bcm under focus. Cryo-electron microscopy data processing. Frames in each movie were aligned 38 , and CTF estimation was carried out using CTFFIND3 (ref. 39) . Particles were picked from a subset of the data employing a difference-of-Gaussians approach 33 and aligned using reference-free 2D classification employing iterative MRA/MSA using a binning factor of two 34 . The resulting 2,188 particles were used to generate an initial 25 \u00c5 lowpass-filtered 3D reconstruction using EMAN2. SPIDER refproj. spi 40 with a delta theta angle of 15 degrees was used to generate 83 projection images of the initial 3D reconstruction. These projection images were used as templates for picking particles from the entire cryo data set. Particles from the entire data set were aligned and classified with the same methods used for the subset of particles stated above. After 2D classification, unbinned selected particles were symmetrically refined in RELION version 1.3 (refs 41, 42) against the initial 3D reconstruction filtered to 60 \u00c5 resolution. This refinement was followed by particle polishing and refinement of the resulting realigned, B-factor-weighted and signal-integrated particles using RELION version 1.4b1. The resolution of the final map was 4.04 \u00c5 at an FSC cutoff of 0.143. A mask was generated in RELION using a threshold that accounted for the entire structure. From this threshold, the mask was further dilated by 3 voxels and a Gaussian fall-off was generated over an additional 6 voxels. The mask effect on FSC was taken into consideration. Phases were randomized in the unfiltered half-set maps for initial FSC lower than 0.8 and a new FSC between these phase-randomized maps was generated and used to correct for mask effects in the final FSC-based resolution estimate. The reported resolution of 4.04 \u00c5 is the RELION CorrelationCorrected value",

Model building and refinement. An initial model of the S1 NTD was generated using the Modeller 43 homology modelling tool in UCSF Chimera 44 with the BCoV NTD (PDB 4H14) 8 as a template. The NTD homology model was docked into the HKU1 S protein EM density and refined with Rosetta density-guided iterative local refinement 45 while imposing C3 symmetry. Rosetta output models were clustered based on pairwise r.m.s.d. using a cluster radius of 2.15 \u00c5. The lowest energy model from the largest cluster was selected for additional refinement. This model and the conserved CTD core from SARS-CoV (PDB 2AJF) 11 were used as starting structures for model building and refinement.

The third protomer of the trimer has been omitted for clarity. b, HKU1 S1 CTD (blue) uses a short helix to cap the central helix and HR1 (red). c, The influenza haemagglutinin HA2 central helix (red) is also capped by a helix in HA1 (blue) 14, 28 . d, The S2 N-terminal \u03b2-strand is connected to the remainder of the S2 subunit via a loop and an \u03b1-helix (dotted lines). These regions of the EM density are of insufficient quality to confidently build this protein region but enable interpretation of connectivity. e, In the pre-fusion HKU1 S protein, the tops of the central S2 helices (blue, red, green) are splayed outwards from the threefold axis and capped by the S1 CTDs (white). The S1 NTD, SD-1 and SD-2 have been omitted for clarity. f, In the post-fusion six-helix-bundle structure of SARS S 22 , the corresponding helical regions from (e) form a well-packed three-helix bundle.",

All class I fusion proteins require proteolytic cleavage adjacent to the fusion peptide or loop, and the metastable pre-fusion state is triggered by a series of events that involve pH change or receptor binding. The post-fusion conformations all contain anti-parallel six-helix bundles composed of the HR1 and HR2 from the membrane-proximal subunit. However, there is a great diversity in pre-fusion conformations as shown here. Members of this class that also participate in receptor binding [14] [15] [16] 28, 53 (top row), including S glycoproteins of coronaviruses, are organized such that their receptor binding subunits sit atop the fusion machinery, and need to be shed in order for membrane fusion to proceed. Paramyxovirus F proteins [54] [55] [56] [57] (bottom row) have a different architecture than the capped fusion proteins on the top row. The F proteins all have disulfide bonds between the membrane proximal and membrane distal subunits, and the two subunits remain interconnected throughout the rearrangement process.",
