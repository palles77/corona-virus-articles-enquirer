This article does the same by discussing the causative agents, pathogenesis, and therapeutic agents separately; however, we hasten to remind the reader that in reality, disease is seldom that simplistic. Instead, many cases and outbreaks of neonatal diarrhea are associated with multiple pathogens, and most pathogens cause diarrhea by more than one mechanism. In some cases, it is important to know the etiologic agent because specific therapy can be directed against it; in other cases, nonspecific, symptomatic and supportive therapy is the only alternative. Although our therapy should be directed against specific pathogens if they are known or suspected to be involved, the greatest success in treating diarrheic calves comes when treatment regimens reverse pathophysiologic abnormalities associated with most or all diarrheas of calves, regardless of cause.",

Most severe cases occur in calves younger than 1 week of age. To cause diarrhea, ETEC must possess an adherence factor (pili) and secrete enterotoxin. 13 The most frequently identified type of pilus is K-99 (also known as F-5), although F-41 is also found on ETEC from calves. 83 Thermostable enterotoxin (STa) is produced by ETEC isolated from calves. Diagnosis of colibacillosis is confirmed by isolating E. coli from the feces and identifying the K-99 pilus antigen. A small percentage of ETEC may possess other pilus antigens and cause disease, but these are encountered infrequently and should be suspected only if K-99 ETEC are not isolated but clinical signs and signalment are typical of colibacillosis. Remember, E. coli may be isolated from almost every calf in the world. Escherichia coli are normal inhabitants of mammalian large intestines, and isolation of them from the feces without identification of the pilus antigen or enterotoxin has very little pathogenic significance. Misunderstanding of that fact has led to tremendous misuse of antimicrobial drugs in diarrheic calves.",

The significance and prevalence of viral diarrhea are yet to be determined. The less known viruses receive little attention from diagnostic laboratories, so their prevalence is probably underestimated. Viral infection can occur at almost any age. Herd immunity and environmental contamination may be important determinants of the age of onset in a particular herd. Rotavirus usually affects younger calves (3 days to 3 weeks), causing mild to moderate diarrhea if there are no complications. 80 Villous atrophy first occurs in the orad half of the jejunum, and later spreads to the rest of the small intestine. 80 Coronavirus can result in more serious disease because it affects a grater portion of each villus and because of its propensity to infect the large intestine as well as the small intestine. 80 Bredavirus also causes lesions in both small and large intestines. 60 Clinical signs of viral enteritis are nonspecific but include watery-to-mucoid diarrhea (without blood), dehydration, and depression.",

In the small intestine, diarrhea is associated with prolonged Phase II of the migrating myoelectrical complex (MMC), appearance of minute rhythms, or disorganization of the MMC.12 None of these phenomena can be viewed as decreased intestinal motility. However, diarrhea is associated with decreased short spike bursts in the colon (thought to be stationary contractions that impede HOW).l1 If these segmental contractions are not present in the colon, normal or even infrequent long spike bursts (or peristaltic contractions) are capable of moving ingesta rapidly through the colon. Therefore, a single dogmatic statement about \"increased\" or \"decreased\" motility during diarrhea cannot be applied to the entire intestinal tract. It is generally accepted that \"hypermotility\" is seldom a Significant cause of diarrhea and that drugs that generally inhibit intestinal motility are seldom indicated as a part of antidiarrheal therapy.",

Firstly, we seldom have the advantage of knowing the exact etiologic agent, at least at the commencement of therapy. Even with the resources available to physicians, an etiologic diagnosis is accomplished in fewer than half of human diarrheic patients. 39 Furthermore, even when we know the etiologic agents, there are only a few pathogens against which we can direct specific therapy, namely ETEe, Salmonella, and Giardia. The second impediment to successful treatment is incomplete understanding of the pathogenesis of diarrhea. Except for secretory diarrhea associated with ETEe in which the mechanism is well-defined, the relative importance of inflammation and its various mediators and pertubations of gut hormones and motility is unknown. Finally, the excessive emphasis on the character and quantity of the feces rather than the general condition of the patient is an impediment. An interesting perspective was presented by Ludan; in infectious enteritis, acute diarrhea per se is, with its cleansing effect, physiologic with beneficial effects. The acute dehydration that accompanies diarrhea is pathologic. 48 Unfortunately, in bovine practice we are not able to routinely supply all the necessary supportive care to maintain calves while the diarrhea runs its course and the calfs intestine heals. Therefore, the search continues for a cure for the diarrhea itself. Although this may prove to be life-saving, we should also remember that an extremely successful antidiarrheal agent may have serious side effects if diarrhea is, in fact, a beneficial physiologic process.",

Our understanding of the cause and pathophysiology of diarrhea of calves has advanced remarkably, but the far-too-common practice by owners and (to some degree) veterinarians of treating diarrheic calves with antimicrobial drugs does not reflect these advances. The high incidence of mild-to-moderate, self-limiting diarrhea of neonatal calves has perpetuated the practice of administering a few \"scour pills\" to every calf with loose feces.

Perhaps more germane to the issue of modification of intestinal motility of diarrheic patients is the fact that the pertubations of motility during diarrheal disease are poorly understood. It is not easy to restore a physiologic function to normalcy if one does not know the nature of the abnormality or even know if an abnormality exists. Therefore, in view of what is known and not known about motility in diarrheal disease, most authors do not recommend anticholinergic drugs that \"paralyze\" the gut for treatment of diarrheal diseases. Opiates, however, are effective antidiarrheal drugs. Previously described as an anti secretory drug, loperamide is thought by some to exert its antidiarrheal effect primarily through its motility modifying properties. 73 Loperamide induced changes in motility of the gastrointestinal tract of healthy calves, but it did not attenuate changes induced by mannitol or castor oil. 29 It did, however, delay the onset of diarrhea induced by mannitol or castor oil. The authors of that study concluded that the antidiarrheal effect of loperamide was not due to its effect on motility.",

It possesses antisecretory and antimicrobial properties. In human patients, berberine remarkably reduced fecal volume in ETEC-induced diarrhea. 64 In a clinical trial in the Netherlands, disodium cromoglycate (200 mg fed twice daily) reduced the severity of diarrhea in veal calves. 30 Nutmeg, fed daily to calves for 3 to 4 days after birth, was credited with the absence of diarrhea for 2 years on one farm. 77 Acupuncture was found to be equally effective as gentamicin for treatment of undifferentiated diarrhea in piglets 44 and was equal to neomycin for treatment of ETEC in piglets. 36 The use of probiotics has been advocated for prevention of diarrhea when fed before disease is present, and as an aid in enhancing recuperation if fed during convalescence. 7 Theories proposed to explain the potential benefit of probiotics include alteration of pH in the intestinal lumen, production of enzymes, B vitamins and antibiotics, alteration of intestinal flora through competition and more. 91 Lactobacilli reduce the population of E. coli in the small intestines of mice. 37 Cell-free broth from cultures of L. bulgaricus showed significant anti-entertoxin activity in pigs, whereas Str. fascium broth had strong inhibitory activity against E. coli. 53 Several other strains had little or no activity against toxin or the organism. Therefore, it is unwise to generalize about \"probiotics\" just as it is unwise to generalize about antibiotics. They apparently are not all the same.",

Appropriate, specific antimicrobial or antiprotozoal therapy should be instituted when colibacillosis, salmonellosis, or giardiasis is confirmed or suspected. All calves with diarrhea should be rehydrated if necessary, and proper nutritional support should be provided. Antisecretory agents such as flunixin meglumine and bismuth subsalicylate may be beneficial for treatment of calves with colibacillosis and salmonellosis. Adsorbants, such as attapulgite and bismuth subsalicylate, also may reduce loss of fluids. Perhaps loperamide or a similar drug will be proven effective in calves in the future.",
