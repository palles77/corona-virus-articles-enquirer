            "text": "A novel virus, rainbow trout orthomyxovirus (RbtOV), was isolated in 1997 and again in 2000 from commercially-reared rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) in Idaho, USA. The virus grew optimally in the CHSE-214 cell line at 15 \u2022 C producing a diffuse cytopathic effect; however, juvenile rainbow trout exposed to cell culture-grown virus showed no mortality or gross pathology. Electron microscopy of preparations from infected cell cultures revealed the presence of typical orthomyxovirus particles. The complete genome of RbtOV is comprised of eight linear segments of single-stranded, negative-sense RNA having highly conserved 5 and 3 -terminal nucleotide sequences. Another virus isolated in 2014 from steelhead trout (also O. mykiss) in Wisconsin, USA, and designated SttOV was found to have eight genome segments with high amino acid sequence identities (89-99%) to the corresponding genes of RbtOV, suggesting these new viruses are isolates of the same virus species and may be more widespread than currently realized. The new isolates had the same genome segment order and the closest pairwise amino acid sequence identities of 16-42% with Infectious salmon anemia virus (ISAV), the type species and currently only member of the genus Isavirus in the family Orthomyxoviridae. However, pairwise comparisons of the predicted amino acid sequences of the 10 RbtOV and SttOV proteins with orthologs from representatives of the established orthomyxoviral genera and a phylogenetic analysis using the PB1 protein showed that while RbtOV and SttOV clustered most closely with ISAV, they diverged sufficiently to merit consideration as representatives of a novel genus. A set of PCR primers was designed using conserved regions of the PB1 gene to produce amplicons that may be sequenced for identification of similar fish orthomyxoviruses in the future.",

The genome segments range in length from 874 to 2396 nucleotides having partial complementarity in their 5 and 3 -terminal sequences. Typically, two large basic and one acidic polymerase proteins (PB1, PB2, and PA) are encoded and interact to form the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) . Orthomyxoviruses also contain a surface glycoprotein (GP) with functions that vary in differing genera to include hemagglutination (HA), esterase activity (HE) and envelope fusion (HEF). Members of the genera Influenzavirus A and Influenzavirus B have a second envelope glycoprotein, a neuraminidase (NA), which contains sialidase activity (Suzuki et al., 2005) while others may have a fusion protein (F) that lacks sialidase activity (Aspehaug et al., 2005) . Two membrane or matrix proteins are encoded from the same RNA segment, the M1 protein is a non-glycosylated matrix protein while M2 functions as a proton-selective ion channel protein (International Committee on the Taxonomy of Viruses, 2005) . In addition, another RNA segment typically encodes two nonstructural proteins that include NS1 that serves as an antagonist of the type I interferon response and NS2, a putative nuclear export protein (NEP).",

Sanger and next-generation sequencing of the RbtOV genome Viral RNA was extracted by TriReagent (Sigma-Aldrich) from a 500 uL aliquot of clarified cell culture fluid from a flask of CHSE-214 cells infected with RbtOV following the manufacturer's instructions. Because the virus type was initially unknown, attempts were made at amplifying extracted viral RNA by reversetranscription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) using in-house sets of DNA primers designed from sequences of known fish viruses (rhabdovirus, paramyxovirus, orthomyxovirus, nidovirus, bunyavirus, picornavirus, hepevirus or aquareovirus), but performing the reverse transcription and annealing at lower stringencies. The PCR conditions used were similar to those for the fish virus, infectious hematopoietic necrosis virus (World Organization for Animal Health, 2009) that include lower annealing temperatures so that primers do not require exact base pairing. Conditions for RT-PCR were: 30 min reverse transcription at 40 \u2022 C followed by 2 min denaturation at 95 \u2022 C, then 30 amplification cycles of 95 \u2022 C for 30 s, 40 \u2022 C for 30 s, and 72 \u2022 C for 60 s, and followed by final extension at 72 \u2022 C for 7 min. Four primer sets produced amplicon bands and the nidovirus primer set yielded an amplicon with a sequence that BLAST searches showed was similar to the PB1 gene of orthomyxoviruses. Using this authentic sequence, new primers were developed to use in 5 and 3 Rapid Amplification of cDNA Ends (RACE) techniques (Invitrogen) were used according to the manufacturer's instructions to gain sequences directed toward both ends of the PB1 gene segment of RbtOV-1.",

Remaining sequences were assembled de novo with the VELVET assembler (Zerbino and Birney, 2008) with a minimum contig length set to 30 nt. To identify putative RbtOV segments, resulting contigs were aligned to the protein sequences of ISAV using BLASTx. Contigs that had a significant alignment score were aligned to the protein sequences using CLUSTAL to verify the validity of the annotation of the four largest viral segments. Primer sets were designed from conserved regions of ISAV and influenzaviruses to allow amplifying portions of the other genome segments, and finally each segment was completed with 5 and 3 RACE methods to obtain all 16 segment termini. Sequence data were edited using SEQUENCHER 4.1 (Gene Codes Corporation) and aligned with the CLUSTALW algorithm in MACVECTOR 6.0 software (Accelrys). Using the methods above, a partial sequence of the PB1 gene was also obtained for the other rainbow trout virus isolated in 2000, known as RbtOV-2.",

First, Cutadapt (Martin, 2011) was used to trim adapter sequence and filter out reads below Phred quality scores of 20. Sequence reads that passed quality filter were then assembled into contigs using SPAdes (Bankevich et al., 2012) . The contigs were then screened for virus sequences using BLASTn and BLASTx searches against GenBank non-redundant nucleotide and protein databases (Camacho et al., 2009) .

The PCR conditions used were those for the fish virus, infectious hematopoietic necrosis virus (World Organization for Animal Health, 2009) that include: 30 min reverse transcription at 50 \u2022 C followed by 2 min denaturation at 95 \u2022 C, then 30 amplification cycles of 95 \u2022 C for 30 s, 50 \u2022 C for 30 s, and 72 \u2022 C for 60 s, and followed by final extension at 72 \u2022 C for 7 min.",

Significant BLASTx hits against ISAV protein sequences were obtained for 20 contigs, characterizing large portions of the segments 1-4 of RbtOV.

All eight segments of the RbtOV-1 isolate were completely sequenced by traditional Sanger sequencing methods and 5 RACE techniques were used to obtain the exact terminal sequences.

Surprisingly, the NP of RbtOV had a calculated pI of 8.7, although long stretches of acidic residues were observed such as \"EEEEEEAQEE\" beginning at nt 296. The pI for the NP of RbtOV was similar to that of ISAV at 8.3, but less basic than the other orthomyxoviruses that range from 9.4-9.6 (Table 3) .

For ISAV, an ortholog of the NA has been characterized and is also located on the fifth largest segment, although it is not known to have sial- idase activity and is thus termed a fusion (F) protein (Aspehaug et al., 2005) . The orf encoding the NA of RbtOV begins with an AUG in strong initiation context, producing a predicted protein of 480 aa. The predicted amino acid sequence of the neuraminidase of RbtOV produced alignments having a 23-24% identity with the NA of influenzavirus A or B (Fig. 3) . The three viruses shared nine conserved cysteine residues in the carboxyl half of the protein, reminiscent of a zinc finger domain present among the V proteins of several paramyxoviruses (Lamb and Kolakofsky, 2001) . Surprisingly, the RbtOV neuraminidase sequence showed no significant similarity to any ISAV protein, although manually, a 16% amino acid identity could be obtained by pairwise comparison with that of the F protein of ISAV. An unusually high number of threonine residues were predicted to be encoded in the RbtOV neuraminidase, 14%, compared to the other proteins of the virus where threonine content ranged from only 4-8%. This was especially evident for aa 52-89 of the NA, where 21 threonine residues out of 38 residues (55%) were located. As shown in Table 3 , the neuraminidase of RbtOV was somewhat acidic (pI 6.0) compared to the F protein of ISAV or the NA of influenzaviruses A and B (pI 7.0-8.1). While the sialidase activity of RbtOV was not tested, BLAST searches using the full amino acid sequence of the RbtOV neuraminidase indicated it was most like the NA of the N3 strains of influenzavirus A and related to the sialidase superfamily of proteins having sialidase propeller motifs 2-6. Four N-linked glycosylation sites were identified in the amino acid sequence of the RbtOV neuraminidase, similar to the four or five sites found in the NA of influenzavirus A or B and greater than the two present in the NA of ISAV (Table 3) .",

For members of the family Orthomyxoviridae, the function of this protein, whether involved in hemagglutination, neutralization, envelope fusion, or esterase activity, varies with the genus. The HA gene of RbtOV contains an orf beginning with an AUG in adequate initiation context only nine nucleotides from the leader terminus and within the region of complementarity, a feature similar to that of ISAV (Merour et al., 2011) . Initiation at this start site is predicted to encode a protein of 464 aa (Table 1) . The next strong, in-frame AUG codon is at nt 156 and may serve as an alternate start for protein synthesis. The predicted amino acid sequence of the RbtOV hemagglutinin did not produce a significant match with any orthomyxovirus sequence in the NCBI database when searched using BLASTp. Instead, the percent amino acid identities ranged between 20 and 24% for all of the representative orthomyxoviruses compared (Fig. 3) , including ISAV, which has esterase activity, and thogotovirus, which has a glycoprotein (GP75), that is not closely related to the influenza virus HA. However, Position-Specific Iterated BLAST (PSI-BLAST) selected to query virus proteins, revealed several viral envelope glycoproteins that did show significant similarity to the HA of RbtOV such as koala retrovirus, gibbon ape leukemia virus, and bat coronavirus. This may be due to similarities in the leucine zipper and heptad repeat features, more common to fusion proteins.",

Two additional, somewhat hydrophobic, domains (aa 83-104; aa 113-134) in the NEP sequence of RbtOV were similar to those near the C-terminus of influenzavirus A, where two alpha helices C1 (aa 64-85) and C2 (aa 94-115) are located (Paterson and Fodor, 2012) .",

The first AUG (+2 frame) at nt 38 begins an orf that encodes a smaller protein of 207 aa with a predicted mass of 23.2 kDa (M1). The second AUG (+1 frame) at nt 88 begins an orf that encodes a larger protein of 235 aa with a predicted mass of 25.6 kDa (M2). Based primarily on the location of the two orfs, predicted protein sizes, and amino acid alignments, the matrix proteins of RbtOV showed the greatest similarity to their ISAV orthologs, but the percent amino acid identities between the sequences encoding these two proteins was low (20-21%) for both the M1 and M2 (Fig. 3) . However, the amino acid sequences revealed no significant matches with any orthomyxoviruses when analyzed using BLASTp. Pairwise alignments of the RbtOV matrix proteins with orthologs of other representative orthomyxoviruses were also low for M1 (16-21%) and M2 (20-27%). Both the M1 and M2 proteins of RbtOV were predicted to be highly basic with a pI of 9.4. While this appears similar to the M1 proteins of ISAV and influenzaviruses that range from pI 9.2-9.7, it was unlike the M2 proteins of ISAV and other representative influenzaviruses that are typically quite acidic with a range from pI 4.4-5.7 (Table 3 ). The deduced M1 amino acid sequence of RbtOV-1 contains three N-linked glycosylation sites, whereas the M2 protein only has one.",

Both Bayesian and maximum likelihood methods, using either the complete PB1 nucleotide sequence or the deduced amino acid sequence, produced trees with similar topologies. These analyses indicated that RbtOV and SttOV are isolates of the same virus species and most closely related to ISAV, the sole species within the genus Isavirus (Fig. 6 ). Further analyses with additional viral genes would aid in confirmation of this finding. This relationship is further supported by evidence that RbtOV has the same genome segment order as that of ISAV as well as the closest percent amino acid identities for most of the other encoded proteins. However, the overall levels of nucleotide or amino acid sequence identities between RbtOV/SttOV and ISAV shown in Fig. 3 are sufficiently low to indicate they are clearly separate virus species. Furthermore, our phylogenetic analysis and pairwise comparison of the PB1 sequences of RbtOV and SttOV with other known orthomyxoviral taxa revealed that the distances between RbtOV/SttOV and other taxa are greater than the intragenic diversity of any of the established genera within the family Orthomyxoviridae. Consequently, we could not assign RbtOV/SttOV into any previously described genus and the viruses potentially represent prototypes in a new genus, tentatively named Mykissvirus based on the species name of the original host, pending ICTV approval.",

Additionally, a partial PB1 sequence from a second isolate of RbtOV from rainbow trout (RbtOV-2) and a nearly complete genome of a third isolate from steelhead trout (SttOV-1) were compared to the initial isolate of RbtOV and to other orthomyxoviruses. These isolates appear to be members of the same virus species and sufficiently distinct from other orthomyxoviruses to merit consideration as a member of a new genus in the family Orthomyxovirdae. In vitro growth conditions were optimized, a plaque assay developed for infectious virus quantification, and a reverse transcription -polymerase chain reac-tion (RT-PCR) assay was modified for detection and identification of similar fish orthomyxoviruses in the future.",
