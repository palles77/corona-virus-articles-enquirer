            "text": "Provision of an adequate mass of IgG from maternal colostrum is essential to health and survival of neonatal calves. Colostrum supplements (CS) have been developed to provide supplemental immunoglobulin when maternal colostrum is of poor quality. However, colostrum replacers (CR) that provide \u2265100 g of IgG have not been formulated. Our objective was to determine the absorption of IgG in newborn calves fed CS derived from bovine serum or CR derived from bovine immunoglobulin concentrate. The CS were prepared by collecting, processing, and spray drying bovine serum and blending with other ingredients to provide 45 to 50 g of IgG per dose. The CR were prepared by further processing bovine serum to increase IgG concentration to >50% IgG and blending with other ingredients to provide 100 to 122 g of IgG per dose. Holstein calves (n = 160) were fed 90 to 244 g of IgG from CS or CR in 1 or 2 feedings in two experiments. Blood was collected from each calf by jugular venipuncture at 0 and 24 h of age and plasma IgG was determined by turbidimetric immunoassay. Apparent efficiency of IgG absorption was calculated. Plasma IgG concentrations at 24 h of age were indicative of IgG intake and averaged 5.5 to 14.1 g/L in calves fed CS and CR. Mean apparent efficiency of IgG absorption in calves fed CS was 25 and 28% in experiments 1 and 2, respectively. Mean apparent efficiency of IgG absorption in calves fed CR ranged from 19 to 32% and were affected by method of processing and number of times fed. Treatment of plasma with polyethylene glycol reduced the efficiency of IgG absorption in experiment 1. The addition of animal fat to CR had no effect on IgG absorption. A second feeding of CR increased plasma IgG, but efficiency of absorption was reduced. Mean body weights at 60 d of 2059 age were not affected by treatment and ranged from 64.3 to 78.2 kg. Plasma IgG concentration in calves fed \u2265122 g of IgG from Ig concentrate approached (9.9 g/L) or exceeded 10 g/L, indicating successful transfer of passive immunity. Provision of IgG to prevent failure of passive transfer is possible with CR containing >20% IgG when fed at 454 g per dose. (",

Unfortunately, several studies indicate that the acquisition of passive immunity is often inadequate in young calves in the United States (Besser and Gay, 1994; Donovan et al., 1998; Virtala et al., 1999) . Failure of passive transfer may be attributed to colostrum containing inadequate mass of IgG, poor colostrum feeding methods, and poor efficiency of IgG absorption in calves (Abel Francisco and Quigley, 1993; Lee et al., 1983; Rea et al., 1996; . Colostrum supplement (CS) products have been developed to provide exogenous IgG to calves when colostrum is of low IgG concentration. Many producers also use these products to replace colostrum when it is unavailable due to maternal agalactia, acute mastitis, or other causes.",

Absorption of IgG from CS derived from lacteal secretions have been reported to be poor (Abel Francisco and Quigley, 1993; Garry et al., 1996; Ikemori et al., 1997; Mee et al., 1996; Morin et al., 1997; Zaremba et al., 1993) , although the reasons for poor IgG absorption have not been defined clearly. Conversely, absorption of CS derived from serum protein generally has been reported to be similar to that of MC . Most CS provide 25 to 45 g of IgG/dose (typically 454 g), which is reconstituted in 2 L of water. Therefore, feeding one or two doses of CS will not provide a sufficient mass of IgG to prevent failure of passive transfer in young calves. Most veterinarians recommend consumption of at least 100 g of IgG within the first 12 h of birth. Colostrum replacer (CR) products should provide a minimum of 100 g of IgG in a form that is readily absorbable by the calf. Our objective was to compare the plasma IgG concentration and efficiency of IgG absorption in calves fed CS derived from bovine serum or with bovine IgG concentrates formulated into CR.",

Calves were enrolled in the study if they had no obvious congenital defects and were clinically healthy. Each calf was removed from the dam within 10 min of birth and moved to the calf housing area. The calf was processed (weighed, identified with an ear tag, its navel was dipped with tincture of iodine, bulls were fitted with an elastic castrator, and extra teats were removed from heifers), stimulated with burlap sacks and moved to an individual elevated metal stall fitted with a heat lamp. Calves were not weighed in experiment 2 due to a malfunction of the scale during the experiment. Calves in experiment 1 were assigned randomly to receive one of four treatments: 3.9 L of MC as soon as possible after birth and an additional 1.9 to 3.9 L at approximately 8 h of age; 454 g of CS-1 as soon as possible after birth and at 8 h; 454 g of CR-1 as soon as possible after birth; or 454 g of CR-2 as soon as possible after birth.

Therefore, intake of MC is only an estimate, based on amount of MC offered and estimated MC refusal. Five pools of MC were used, and IgG concentration ranged from 76.8 to 133.8 g/L. Age at first feeding was not significantly affected by treatment, although calves fed CS-1 tended (P < 0.10) to be fed later than other calves.

A factor affecting plasma IgG concentration and AEA is mass of IgG fed. Most CS products provide 25 to 45 g of IgG, which may be difficult to measure in the circulation using conventional methods of analysis. Many veterinarians recommend that calves consume a minimum of 100 g of IgG in the first 24 h after birth.

Regulatory approval of products for prevention or treatment of failure of passive transfer requires that products produce an increase in circulating IgG concentration in at least 20 neonatal animals fed a dose of the product above a minimum standard for the specific species (9 CFR 113.499). To date, no approved CS has been shown to increase IgG concentration above the species standard. In Experiment 2, mean plasma IgG exceeded the bovine species standard (10 g/L) in calves fed 122 or 244 g of IgG. Our data suggest that mass of IgG and method of processing are critical to ensure adequate transfer of passive immunity. It is important to recognize that products providing less than 100 g of IgG/dose should not be used to replace colostrum; rather two discrete classes of products (CS and CR) with unique functions and formulation should be recognized.",

Preparation of an IgG concentrate with polyethylene glycol to fractionate the IgG from bovine plasma reduced the concentration of IgG in plasma of calves at 24 h of age; further research is needed to determine the nature of this reduced concentration. Feeding increased doses of IgG from further processed bovine serum can increase circulating IgG in calves.",
