            "text": "Lectins are sugar-bindingp roteins that engage in interactions with endogenousa nd exogenousg lycans. The interactions between lectins and carbohydratesa re involved in many fundamental biological events, from cell adhesiont oa ntigen recognition and internalization, inflammation, or quality control in protein folding. The most abundant class of animal lectins are the C-typel ectin receptors (CLRs) serving ab road range of functions. They are involved in pathogen recognition and in prevention of autoimmunity by contributing to the immune system's ability to identify carbohydrate-based pathogen-asso-ciated molecular patterns (PAMP) and damaged-self-associated molecular patterns (DAMP).They take part in signal transduction, cell trafficking, and in the induction of T-cell differentiation. Their name,C -type lectins, indicates the presence of a Ca 2 + ion in their carbohydrate recognition domain (CRD). This ion is the primary site of carbohydrate interaction and typically coordinates two vicinal hydroxyl groups on as ugar ring. Many C-typel ectin receptors arey et to be exploreda nd described in detailw ith regard to their CRD structure, carbohydrate binding specificities, and the molecular factors governing the interaction with glycans. However,i ti sk nown that the CRDs of CLRs feature evolutionarily conserved groups of residues that coordinatet he Ca 2 + ion and determine the monosaccharide binding specificity of the CLR.S o, aG lu-Pro-Asn (EPN) motif results in ap reference for mannose( Man), N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc), fucose (Fuc), or glucose (Glc) residues,w hereas a Gln-Pro-Asp (QPD) sequence leads to recognition of galactose (Gal) and N-acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc). [1] Available data also suggestst hat the extended binding sites of CLRs often display ah igher affinity towardsl arger glycans tructures, thanks to additional interactions occurring in the vicinity of the primary Ca 2 + site. [2] Thus, complex glycanse xposing the same monosaccharide can bind to CLRs with very different affinities, depending on the accessibility of the recognition elementa nd on additional features of the lectin bindings ites. Structural studiesa lso demonstrate that secondary binding sites can alter the affinity and specificity of the CLR towardsl igands. As an example, langerin, [3] at ransmembrane CLR expressedo nL angerhans-cells, and the dendritic-cell specific intercellulara dhesion molecule-3-grabbing non-integrin (DC-SIGN), aC LR expressed by dendritic cells (DCs) [4] shares imilar primary binding sites with similars pecificity for oligomannosides, but langerin has an additional calcium-independent sugar-binding site and binds to large sulfatedg lycosamino glycans, whereas DC-SIGN does not. [5] Given the key role played by lectins in biological systems, many research groups have turned their attention towards the development of glycomimetic molecules to be used as selective probesf or the study of sugar-protein interactions and/or for medicinal chemistryp urposes. [6] Glycomimetics present several advantages as drug candidates over natural glycans, since they can be made metabolically more stable, more bioavailable, and possibly morea ctive and selectivethan natural oligosaccharides. Our previous studies have focused on inhibiting the dendritic cell receptor DC-SIGN, aC LR implicated in viral and bacterial infections. [7] The primary binding site of DC-SIGN CRD recognizes mannoseo ligosaccharides, l-fucose residues in Lewis-type blood antigens, [4] and biantennary N-glycans with terminal GlcNAcm oieties. [8] Additional druggable sites on the lectin have been described recently. [9] DC-SIGN-mediated adhesion to dendritic cells is the first step of severalv iral infections, notably by HIV and Ebola viruses. [10] Glycomimetic antagonists of DC-SIGN have mainly been designed startingf rom high mannoseg lycans, like Man 9 (Man) 9 (GlcNAc) 2 (1,F igure 1), or from Le X (Fuca1,3-(Galb1,4-)-GlcNAc) (2)-type structures. In particular,p seudo-di and tri-mannoside fragments (3-6)w ere synthesized [11] as mimics of the D2 and D3 arms of Man 9 ( Figure 1 ). When used in multivalent constructs, they were found to block DC-SIGN-mediatedi nfection with activities up to the nanomolar level both in HIV and Ebola infection models. [12] Notably,t he bisbenzylamide derivatives 6a [11c] and 6b [11d] also exhibited strong selectivity towards DC-SIGNa nd did not bind to langerin, aCLR that shares with DC-SIGN asimilar set of ligandsbut, rather than spreading the infection,f acilitates HIV eradication. [13] These results suggested that, with appropriate modifications, the structure of 6 could represent a general template to generate ad iverse library of glycomimetics containing one natural monosaccharide as the lectin-targeting element andatuning unit, which could providea dditional functional elements for interaction witht he lectin in the proximity of the primary binding site. As mentioned above, the structure of 6 derives from mimicryo ft he Mana1-2Man disaccharide, the terminal unit of the D1-D3a rms of Man 9 and a common disaccharide ligand for DC-SIGN (PDB:2 IT6) and for other CLRs of the immune system with similar specificity,s uch as DC-SIGNR, [14] langerin (PDB:3 P5F), [15] and dectin-2 (PDB: 5VYB). [16] Screenings uch al ibrary against these CLRs in am icroarrayf ormat may become ap otent toolf or glycomimetic drug discovery. [17] Glycan microarrays,a si ntroduced and developed over the past 15 years, have been an essential tooli nt he characterization of lectin specificity, [18] andh ave been used to pave the way for the therapeutic exploitation of vital lectinsugar interactions.",

DC-SIGN has ad ual role as ac ell surface pattern-recognizing receptor and as am ediator for T-cell activation.A dditionally,anumber of pathogens, most notably the HIV virus, are known to exploit DC-SIGN in the initial steps of host invasion. [10a, 25] For thesereasons, DC-SIGN has been actively investigated, both as at arget for discoveryo fa nti-adhesive antiviral therapies and for its potential role in immunoregulation. [26] The lectin recognizes highly mannosylated oligosaccharides often found on viral and bacterial cell surfaces;t he four Lewistype blood group antigens (Le x Le y ,L e a ,a nd Le b )a nd mannancapped lipoarabinomannan and phosphatidylinositol-mannosides expressedo nm ycobacterial surfaces. [27] On the array (Figure 3A), many of the mannosylated structures, but essentially none of the b-fucosylated ligands are recognized by the tetrameric DC-SIGNe xtracellular domain (ECD).A lthough DC-SIGN is knownt ob ind fucosylated oligosaccharides, they all consist of a-fucosides, whereas, to the best of our knowledge, b-fucosides have not been explored before. The mannose-based ligands identified by red bars in Figure 4h ad originally been designed as DC-SIGN antagonists and tested by SPR as inhibitors of DC-SIGN binding to mannosylated BSA. [11c] Both the SPR data and the microarray resultsi ndicate that all these compounds have as imilar affinity for the lectin,w ith the methyl ester 17.2 being the least effective of the series. None of the additional modificationso ft he amide functionality attempted in this library wasf ound to improve on the previous design. On the other hand, very low fluorescencei ntensity was detected for all tertiarya mide derivatives( 17.10, 17.20, 17.30, 17.36, 17.37, 17.38,a nd 17.39)o nt he chip. This observation confirmed early data from previousS PR screenings in our groups, which had indicated that tertiary amides on the pseudo-dimannoside scaffold were significantly reducing the binding affinity towards DC-SIGN. [28] The current set of data strongly suggests that this feature can be reliably used to generate selectivity against DC-SIGN. Overall, these data allowed the validation of microarray results and showedt hat the screening technique implemented is robusta nd adequate for fast analysis of binding activity.",

            "text": "Dendritic cell-associated C-type lectin 2, dectin-2, is ap redominantly macrophage and monocyte associated CLR, [37] with a known specificity for mannose and ap reference for Mana1-2Man recognition. [16] Dectin-2 binds to bacteria such as Klebsiella pneumoniae and Mycobacterium tuberculosis and fungi such as Candida albicans. [38] Its antifungal activity has been demonstrated in animal-models. [39] Upon ligand binding, dectin-2i sa ble to promote signaling, cytokine secretion,a nd, finally,the initiation of aT h17 immune response. [40] The binding profile of dectin-2E CD towards the glycomimetic library is shown in Figure5A. It can be observedt hat some of the mannosides appear to interactm ore strongly than mannose 19.2,aw eak binder of dectin-2. Remarkably,d ectin-2 exhibits an affinity towards some tertiary amide structures (17.10, 17.20, 17.30, 17.36, 17.37, 17.38,a nd 17 .39,s howcased in Figure 5B )a nd b-fucosylated ligands, which are not or barely recognized by DC-SIGN( Figure 3A ). Although the two lectins display as imilarp rofile for mannosidesb earing secondary amide structures, they clearly differ in the fucoside section and more strikingly so in the mannoside-bearing tertiary amide groups section. This suggests the possibilityo fa nu nprecedented selectivity between the two CLRs towards glycomimeticc ompounds,w hich may be related to the different nature of the two binding sites. [16] Indeed,t he X-ray structure of the dectin-2i nc omplex with Man 9 GlcNAc 2 has been recently solved. [16] Figure 6s hows dectin-2C RD superimposed to the X-ray structure of the DC-SIGN complex with the pseudo-dimannoside 3. [41] The overlay shows ah ighly conserved tertiary structure with ad ifference in the loops in close proximity of the Ca 2 + binding site that contain V351 for DC-SIGN andH 171 for dectin-2( to the right of the ligand in Figure 6A ). At the other side of the Ca 2 + ion, the X-ray structure of dectin-2 shows av ery shallow surface, lined by aT rp side chain (W182, Figure 6A ). Alignment of the dectin-2a nd DC-SIGN sites shows that the DC-SIGN binding region (blue) is more confined, by Phe313 on one side and Val351 on the opposite side of the Ca 2 + ion ( Figure 6B ). The Val351 side chain is in close contact with the cyclohexane ring of 3 andn ear the amide sidec hains of the amide derivatives ( Figure 6B ). In dectin-2, the corresponding loop is more open and the valine residue is replaced by ahistidine in this position (His171). The different loop orientation,a sh ighlighted in Figure 6 , allows more available space between the protein and the position of the amide side chain of the mimics (as indicated by the curved arrow in Figure 6B ). As ar esult, this lectin may be able to accommodate mannobioside mimics with larger groups, such as tertiary amides, for the interaction with its CRD. Further investigation on these ligands is underway.",
