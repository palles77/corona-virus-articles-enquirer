In the effusive form, antibody titers and protein electrophoresis in the effusions were analyzed. The distribution of the immune cells and of the virus in FIP lesions were also investigated immunohistochemically with the avidin\u00b1biotin complex (ABC) method, using antibodies against the FIP virus (FIPV), myelomonocytic (MAC387) and lymphoid (CD3, CD4 and CD8 for T-cells and IgM and IgG for B-cells) antigens. Seropositive animals (antibody titer>1:100) were present among both the FIP infected cats (73%) and the healthy cats (70%). Cats with effusive FIP had neutrophilic leukocytosis (P>0.05), lymphopenia (P<0.01) and eosinopenia (P<0.001). In both effusive and noneffusive forms decreased albumin/globulin ratio (P<0.001) with hypoalbuminemia (P<0.001), hyperglobulinemia (P<0.001) and increased 2 -(P<0.05), -(P<0.05) and gglobulins (P<0.001) were found. Hypergammaglobulinemia was not related to the antibody titers, suggesting the presence of other proteins with g-motility (e.g. complement fractions). The electrophoretic pattern of the effusions was always similar to that of the corresponding serum. Antibody titers higher than those of the corresponding serum were often detected in the effusions. Immunohistochemical findings were not related to the antibody titers, but they were related to the histological aspect of the lesions. In cellular foci of FIP lesions many virus-infected macrophages and few lymphocytes, mainly CD4 , were found. Extracellular viral and myelomonocytic antigens were also detectable in the foci with intercellular necrosis. Only few FIPV-infected cells were present at the periphery of the larger necrotic foci: in these lesions MAC387 cells were mainly neutrophils, with many MAC387 \u00c0 macrophages, probably due to their activated state; a small number of lymphocytes, with an increasing percentage of CD8 cells was present. Lymphocytes were more abundant when cellular foci and FIP-infected macrophages were centered around neoformed vessels. IgM and IgG exposing B-cells were always few and scattered. In conclusion the simultaneous analysis of body fluids and of the cellular composition of the lesions showed a Veterinary Immunology and Immunopathology 65 (1998) 205\u00b1220 : S 0 1 6 5 -2 4 2 7 ( 9 8 ) 0 0 1 5 5 -X complex immune status, on which type III and type IV hypersensitivity could coexist. # 1998 Elsevier Science B.V.

The FIP virus (FIPV) originates from the less pathogenic feline enteric coronavirus (FECV) by a minor mutation (Pedersen and Floyd, 1985) , and acquire the ability to pass through the epithelium into the lymph and to replicate in the cells of the monocytic\u00b1macrophagic line (Stoddart and Scott, 1989) . Within the monocytes, FIPV spreads throughout the body to target organs. The two feline coronaviruses (FCoV) have slight and poorly understood differences in their genoma (Vennema et al., 1995) , but they are morphologically and antigenically identical (Boyle et al., 1984) . This leads to some problems in both diagnosis and understanding of the pathogenesis of the disease.",

            "text": "The appearance of the disease and the different clinical forms (effusive or noneffusive) depends on the cellular immune efficiency: cats with a strong cellular immunity may not develop the disease, while those with a weak cellular immunity have the noneffusive FIP and those without a cellular reaction have the effusive form (Pedersen and Black, 1983; Pedersen, 1995a Pedersen, , 1987 Humoral immunity, in contrast, seems to increase the probability of getting the disease. Even if antibody-enhanced infection has been recently questioned (Olsen et al., 1992 (Olsen et al., , 1993 Addie et al., 1995) , many experimental results demonstrate that anti-FCoV antibodies facilitate the uptake of the virus by the macrophages (Hayashi et al., 1983; Stoddart and Scott, 1989 ; Barlough and Stoddart, 1990; Hohdatsu et al., 1994; Pedersen, 1995a) , and that immunocomplexes lead to a type III hypersensitivity reaction with disseminated intravascular coagulation and fibrinoid necrosis of the vessel's walls, responsible for the effusions (Hayashi et al., 1977 (Hayashi et al., , 1978 Pedersen and Boyle, 1980; Weiss et al., 1980; Jacobse-Geels et al., 1980; Weiss and Scott, 1981; Fenner, 1987; Pastoret and Bourtonboy, 1991; Pedersen, 1995a) . This hypothesized immune-mediated pathogenesis is also supported by epidemiologic considerations (Pedersen and Floyd, 1985; Addie et al., 1995) and by other immunopathological findings, such as the fluctuations of antibody titers and complement fractions during the course of the infection (Pedersen and Boyle, 1980; Jacobse-Geels et al., 1982) .",

In other immune-mediated diseases such as leishmaniasis (Carvalho et al., 1992; Bourdoiseau et al., 1997) , canine blastomycosis (Legendre and Becker, 1982) and feline immunodeficiency virus (Lin et al., 1990) or feline leukemia virus infections (Hoover et al., 1987) , lymphopenia has been interpreted as a sign of reduced cell-mediated immunity. This conclusion was based upon a reduced lymphocyte blastogenesis (Legendre and Becker, 1982; Lin et al., 1990; Bishop et al., 1992; Carvalho et al., 1992) or a low CD4/CD8 ratio (Bishop et al., 1992; Lawrence et al., 1995; Hoffmann-Fezer et al., 1996) . This study gives only a quantitative evaluation of lymphocytes, and no information about blood lymphocyte subpopulations or functions in FIP are available in literature. Thus, although an impairment of lymphocyte functions can not be excluded, the neutrophilia and eosinopenia only in the cats with the acute effusive form suggest a stress leukogram (Jain, 1986 (Jain, , 1993 .",
