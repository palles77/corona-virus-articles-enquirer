            "text": "RNA interference (RNAi) gained international attention in 1998 when Fire, Mello and colleagues discovered the ability of double-stranded RNA to silence gene expression in the nematode worm Caenorhabditis elegans 1 . Three years later, Tuschl and co-workers published their celebrated proof-of-principle experiment demonstrating that synthetic small interfering RNA (siRNA) could achieve sequence-specific gene knockdown in a mammalian cell line 2 . The first successful use of siRNA for gene silencing in mice was achieved for a hepatitis C target shortly thereafter 3 . Since that time, the biotechnology sector has made considerable efforts in the advancement of siRNA therapeutics for the treatment of various disease targets, including viral infections 4,5 and cancer [6] [7] [8] .",

RNAi is triggered by the presence of long pieces of double-stranded RNA, which are cleaved into the fragments known as siRNA (21) (22) (23) nucleotides long) by the enzyme Dicer 9 . In practice, siRNA can be synthetically produced and then directly introduced into the cell, thus circumventing Dicer mechanics (FIG. 1) . This shortcut reduces the potential for an innate immune interferon response and the shutdown of cellular protein expression that can occur following the interaction of long pieces (>30 nucleotides) of doublestranded RNA with intracellular RNA receptors 10 .",

Argonaute 2, a multifunctional protein contained within RISC, unwinds the siRNA, after which the sense strand (or passenger strand) of the siRNA is cleaved 12 . The activated RISC, which contains the antisense strand (or guide strand) of the siRNA, selectively seeks out and degrades mRNA that is complementary to the antisense strand 13 (FIG. 1) . The cleavage of mRNA occurs at a position between nucleo tides 10 and 11 on the complementary antisense strand, relative to the 5\u2032-end 14 . The activated RISC complex can then move on to destroy additional mRNA targets, which further propagates gene silencing 15 . This extra potency ensures a therapeutic effect for 3-7 days in rapidly dividing cells, and for several weeks in non-dividing cells 16 . Eventually, siRNAs are diluted below a certain therapeutic threshold or degraded within the cell, and so repeated administration is necessary to achieve a persistent effect.",

In order for these advances to be implemented in a clinical setting, safe and effective delivery systems must be developed. While 'naked' , chemically modified siRNA has shown efficacy in certain physiological settings such as the brain 23 and the lung 24 , there are many tissues in the body that require an additional delivery system to facilitate transfection. This is because naked siRNA is subject to degradation by endogenous enzymes, and is too large (~13 kDa) and too negatively charged to cross cellular membranes.",

Alternatively, siRNA can be introduced directly into the cell. The siRNA is then incorporated into the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC), resulting in the cleavage of the sense strand of RNA by argonaute 2 (AGO2).

However, chemical modifications can be introduced into the siRNA molecule to evade immune defences in vivo. For example, many non-modified siRNAs can induce nonspecific activation of the immune system through the Toll-like receptor 7 (TlR7) pathway 38, 39 . This effect can be reduced by the incorporation of 2\u2032-O-methyl modifications into the sugar structure of selected nucleotides within both the sense and antisense strands 38, 40 (FIG. 3a) . 2\u2032-O-methyl modifications have also been shown to confer resistance to endo nuclease activity 41 and to abrogate off-target effects when incorporated into the seed region, which corresponds to nucleotides 2-8 on the antisense strand 42 . Other common modification approaches to mitigate enzymatic degradation include the introduction of phosphorothioate backbone linkages at the 3\u2032-end of the RNA strands to reduce susceptibility to exonucleases. It is also possible to incorporate alternative 2\u2032 sugar modifications (for example, a fluorine substitution) to increase resistance to endonucleases 43 .",

Although many types of compound have been investigated as potential candidates, this Review focuses on synthetic materials that have successfully delivered nucleic acids in vivo. An overview of the delivery agents presented here can be found in TABLE 2. Liposomes and lipid-like materials. unilamellar and multilamellar liposomes are commonly used as pharmaceutical delivery vehicles 68 . In an aqueous environment, certain materials have the ability to form liposomes, in which a lipid bilayer forms a sphere with an aqueous core. For example, one set of polar head-groups can create the outer surface of the nanocomplex, while another set of polar head-groups faces the interior hydrophilic core, which houses the nucleic acid payload 69 (FIG. 4) . It is also possible for liposomes to be amorphous in structure, with the lipids and nucleic acids interspersed throughout. liposomes can be created using single or multiple types of lipid, which allows for additional flexibility when optimizing the physical and chemical properties of the nanoparticle 68 . liposomes have been used for the delivery of nucleic acids for over 20 years, originating with studies by Felgner and colleagues detailing the ability of the cationic lipid DOTMA (N-[1-(2,3-dioleyloxy)propyl]-N,N,Ntrimethlyl ammonium chloride) to deliver both DNA and RNA into mouse, rat and human cell lines 70, 71 . More recently, stable nucleic acid-lipid particle (SNAlP) formulations have demonstrated efficacy in several models in vivo. A study by Morrissey and co-workers indicated that HBV replication was inhibited through the delivery of an siRNA-SNAlP complex that targeted HBV RNA. Three daily intravenous injections of 3 mg per kg per day reduced serum HBV levels by at least one order of magnitude, and the effect was specific, dose-dependent and lasted for up to 7 days after dosing 4 . In addition, Zimmerman and colleagues demonstrated the ability of SNAlPs to enable knockdown of ApoB in the liver of cynomolgus monkeys 57 . A single siRNA injection resulted in dose-dependent silencing of ApoB mRNA expression in the liver 48 hours after administration, with maximal silencing of more than 90%. Knockdown was confirmed to be caused by ApoB mRNA cleavage at precisely the site predicted for the RNAi mechanism, and persisted for 11 days at the highest administered dose of 2.5 mg per kg 57 .",

            "text": "In 2004, the first clinical trial involving siRNA was carried out by Acuity Pharmaceuticals for the treatment of AMD. The completed Phase II trials reported that all doses were well tolerated with a lack of adverse systemic effects. Testing has now moved into Phase III trials, which have been taken over by Opko Health. Allergan is currently conducting a Phase II clinical trial on an siRNA for AMD, with completed Phase I results indicating minimal side effects and improved vision in some of the patients. Although Silence Therapeutics also had an siRNA product for AMD in the pipeline, they have now refocused their Phase II clinical study on the treatment of diabetic macular oedema, which is another condition caused by leaky vasculature within the eye. Importantly, a recent study has reported that anti-VEGF siRNA efficacy in the eye is not due to specific gene silencing, but is instead caused by nonspecific stimulation of the TlR3 pathway, which can reduce angiogenesis 102 . Although this study calls into question the nature of the anti-angiogenic effect reported in AMD clinical trials, it does not explain the therapeutic effects observed in other applications of siRNA in which appropriate controls have been performed.",

The incorporation of tissue-specific ligands into these particles may enable targeting, which will assist with in vivo biodistribution and delivery. We also anticipate that future developments will require attention to nonspecific activation of the immune system by siRNA, including TlR3 and TlR7 pathways 102, 104 . Given the potential for nonspecific effects, it is important that the therapeutic mode of action be validated when possible, such as through direct measurement of target mRNA levels in vivo. Chemical modification of siRNA -such as 2\u2032-O-methyl substitutions -can minimize nonspecific effects 40 , and we expect that additional improvements in both activity and delivery will be mediated by direct chemical modification of the siRNA sequence.",
