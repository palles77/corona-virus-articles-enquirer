Antibody tests are widely used but cannot differentiate between vaccination and reinfection. We developed a PRRSV antigen capture enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) using well-characterized monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) raised against the nucleocapsid (N) protein of North American and European PRRSV. This antigen assay detected purified N protein from both genotypes at levels as low as 0.4 and 0.8 ng, respectively. The specificity and sensitivity of the N antigen assay were evaluated with ground lung tissues from 8 PRRSV-infected and 16 healthy swine, and culture supernatants from six PRRSV isolates as well as other swine viruses were confirmed by reverse transcriptase PCR (RT- N antigen assay (12.45%) , RT-PCR (15.02%), and a commercial test for antibodies against PRRSV (78.97%). Of the 466 sera, 47 were positive by both antigen and RT-PCR tests, 11 by antigen test only, and 23 by RT-PCR only; the two assays had an overall agreement of 92.7%, indicating a significant percentage of active PRRSV in asymptomatic pigs despite previous immunization. These findings suggest that the antigen assay is a valuable field tool for the epidemiological control of PRRSV that can be used for rapid screening, particularly in asymptomatic animals.",

            "text": "Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS) is rapidly gaining importance as one of the most economically significant diseases in swine worldwide. The PRRS virus (PRRSV) plays a major role in its pathogenesis and causes persistent disease due to factors such as virus genetic diversity, virulence, or modulating the immune system of the swine (8, 10, 29) . Since PRRSV is genetically heterogeneous, currently available vaccines cannot provide a completely protective effect (9, 17, 19) . Therefore, the rapid diagnosis of PRRSV infections is important for reducing economic loss through timely management and epidemiological control. Currently, reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR) and serological tests are widely performed for the diagnosis of PRRSV infections (1, 6, 15, 18, 26, 27) . Although molecular detection, such as that by RT-PCR, provides promising sensitivity and rapid diagnosis, the molecular approach is costly, as it requires specialized laboratory equipment and experienced technicians. Serological testing is a cost-effective tool for the routine diagnosis of PRRS. However, the serological detection is limited by the inability to differentiate between vaccination, primary infection, or reinfection (19) . Therefore, the development of effective methods for monitoring and controlling PRRS is necessary. Viral antigen detection methods are convenient and cost-effective and have been used successfully with various infectious diseases (2, 11, 16) . During acute virus infection, viral antigens in the blood appear earlier than the antibodies. Thus, rapid and accurate primary screening for the stage of PRRSV infection can be achieved by the detection of the viral antigens rather than by the detection of specific antibodies. In our previous study, we successfully used novel monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) raised against ideal targets to develop the viral antigen detection methods for the diagnosis and monitoring of human disease activity (4, 24, 38) . The approach may be adapted to the diagnosis of PRRSV infections. PRRSV is an enveloped positive single-stranded RNA virus that can be divided into two different genotypes, the European strains (EU PRRSV; type 1) and the North American strains (US PRRSV; type 2) (21) . PRRSV contains nine known open reading frames (ORFs) (28) , and ORF7 encodes the highly conserved viral nucleocapsid (N) protein. This N protein has been identified as the most abundant and immunogenic protein in the virion (35, 36) . Currently, several serological tests based on the PRRSV N protein as the antigen have been developed and are widely used for the detection of antibodies produced in PRRS from infection with the North American or European PRRSV (23, 27, 34) . Thus, the PRRSV N protein may be used to develop viral antigen detection methods. Here, we report on the successful development of an enzyme immunoassay for the PRRSV N antigen using monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) raised against the N proteins of both US PRRSV and EU PRRSV. This assay represents a valuable test for monitoring swine sera for the presence of active PRRSV.",

Afterwards, the wells were blocked with 3% BSA (Sigma-Aldrich) in PBS for 2 h, and then a constant concentration of one of the nonbiotinylated MAbs (50 l) was incubated with an optimal concentration of different biotinylated MAbs (50 l) for 1 h at 26\u00b0C. After the plates were washed, streptavidin conjugated with HRP (Zymed) was added and plates were incubated for 30 min at 26\u00b0C. The plates were washed, and the binding of the biotinylated MAb was detected by the addition of tetramethylbenzidine (TMB; KPL, Gaithersburg, MD). The reaction was stopped after 10 min by the addition of 1 N sulfuric acid, and the plates then were examined in an ELISA plate reader (Bio-Tek, Winooski, VT). An irrelevant, unlabeled MAb was used as a control. The percentage of inhibition was calculated with the equation [1 \u03ea (OD 450 of the test well/OD 450 of the control well)] \u03eb 100, where OD 450 is the optical density at 450 nm. The results were described as follows: inhibition of \u03fe75% represented competitive binding, inhibition from 25 to 75% represented relatively competitive binding, and inhibition of \u03fd25% represented noncompetitive binding (24). To select the best combination of capture and detector antibodies for an antigen capture ELISA, MAbs were paired according to their ability to recognize different epitopes on the N protein. The procedure was modified from that previously described (24, 38) . In brief, microwell plates (Costar) were coated with 100 l/well of each capture MAb at a concentration of 10 g/ml and incubated overnight at 4\u00b0C. After the blocking steps were performed, a series of diluted PRRSV N proteins of known concentrations, virus-infected culture supernatants, or undiluted pig sera were added to duplicate wells (100 l/well) and incubated for 1 h at 37\u00b0C. After the plates were washed, 100 l/well of diluted HRPconjugated MAb was added and incubated for 30 min at 37\u00b0C. After further washes, 100 l/well of TMB solution was added, and the reaction was stopped after incubation for 10 min with 1 N sulfuric acid. The absorbance was determined as described above. Test samples were considered positive if their mean absorbance was greater than twice the mean absorbance of the normal controls.",

Bovine serum albumin (BSA) was used to establish the baseline for the assay, and a sample was considered positive if the OD 450 was two times greater than that of BSA. With these criteria, the minimal amount of recombinant US and EU PRRSV N proteins detected with this assay was approximately 4 (0.4 ng/test) and 8 ng/ml (0.8 ng/ test), respectively.

Each serum sample was processed into three aliquots for use in the PRRSV N antigen capture ELISA, RT-PCR, and the serologic immunoglobulin G (IgG) test (a commercial IDEXX HerdChek* PRRS 2XR test kit), respectively. The percentage of specimens positive for antibodies against PRRSV, as determined by the IDEXX HerdChek PRRS 2XR ELISA, was 78.97% (368/466), despite all swine previously having been immunized twice. It is very interesting on March 19, 2020 by guest http://cvi.asm.org/ that when the PRRSV N antigen capture ELISA was used to detect PRRSV N antigen in these 466 serum specimens, which were obtained from asymptomatic animals, the N antigen was detected in 58 of 466 (12.45%) specimens. Traditional RT-PCR was performed as a reference with the 466 serum specimens, and PRRSV N RNA was detected in 70 of 466 (15.02%) specimens. The sequence analysis of ORF7-amplified fragments determined them to be highly homologous, with 94 to 96% nucleotide identities to the PRRSV strain of CH-1a (Chinese isolate). The results of the three assays are summarized in Table 2 . Of the 58 N antigen-positive (N antigen \u03e9 ) samples, 47 were concordant with the RT-PCR test (i.e., N antigen \u03e9 , RT-PCR \u03e9 ), leaving 11 sera that were discordant with the RT-PCR test (N antigen \u03e9 , RT-PCR \u03ea ). Comparing the sensitivities of the two assays, 47 of 466 sera tested positive for both N protein and viral RNA, 385 tested negative for both N protein and viral RNA, 11 had detectable N protein but were negative by RT-PCR, and 23 had detectable viral RNA but were negative by the N antigen assay. The statistical analysis results demonstrated a relatively good correlation between the two assays, with 92.7% agreement ( \u03ed 0.693). Of the 368 PRRSV antibody-positive sera, 43 were positive by both N antigen and RNA tests. Four sera were positive by both the N antigen and RNA tests but negative by the antibody test. Of the 58 N antigen and 70 PRRSV RNA-positive serum specimens, 51 and 64 specimens, respectively, also were positive for PRRSV antibodies. Collectively, these data demonstrate that although vaccinated pigs have antibody responses, active PRRSV infections are present in some swine farms. The RT-PCR assay was more sensitive than the N antigen assay, although the antigen capture ELISA is relatively convenient and rapid.",

Second, asymptomatic healthy pigs also can have antigenemia or viremia in their sera, which is detectable with these more sensitive tests. These asymptomatic pigs may serve as important reservoirs for the transmission of PRRSV to uninfected pigs. Moreover, they may be shedding escape mutants, which one day can exacerbate vaccine failure. The present vaccine is unlikely to be completely effective, because the wild virus is affecting and immunomodulating monocytes and macrophages, which are central players in the pig's immune system (3, 12, 39) . Thus, the vaccine-conferred immunity can be dampened down once the intrusion by the wild-type virus is sufficient to downregulate the original immunity (19) .",

The test cannot differentiate between vaccination and reinfection. In addition, a large number of diagnostic serological assays have been developed over the years that utilize different viral antigens (22, 34) . However, serological diagnosis often is confounded by the failure to distinguish between antibody induced by infection and those arising from other means, such as maternal antibodies or vaccine-induced antibodies, although it might be possible to differentiate the serological response induced by vaccines from that caused by disease to a limited extent (7) . Moreover, antibody production varies among pigs with respect to the strength of the immune response, the time of response, and the waning of antibody levels. In these respects, the direct detection of antigen has significant advantages over serological assays by avoiding the reliance on the host's production of antibodies.",

For this purpose, the currently developed PRRSV N antigen capture ELISA is a promising option as an adjunct to the serological tests. This is based on our assessment of the antigen capture ELISA, which was found to have results comparable to those of RT-PCR.

This indicates that vaccines do not necessarily work well in pigs or against reinfection. Therefore, antigen monitoring is particularly important. Findings from this study indicate that N antigen capture ELISA can be a useful adjunct for the early diagnosis of PRRSV infections and is a good monitoring tool, even after vaccination. This paper represents the first report of antigen detection by antigen capture ELISA in the peer-reviewed literature. Previous attempts at antigen detection for PRRSV infections were limited largely to the use of the immunostaining of tissues from infected animals (25, 30, 34) . By using well-characterized MAbs with high affinity and high specificity to N of PRRSV, no evidence of cross-reaction was found when tested with other important pig viruses, such as PRV and FMDV. The overall performance of the present assay is similar to that of other antigen capture ELISAs developed for other viruses, such as dengue virus (24, 38) and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (4, 13) . In summary, these findings suggest that a specific MAb-based PRRSV N antigen capture assay can be used reliably for the early diagnosis of PRRSV infections as an alternative to the more traditionally used virus isolation and RT-PCR methods. Although the detection of PRRSV N by antigen capture assay was slightly less sensitive than the detection of viral RNA by RT-PCR in this study, the N antigen capture assay has the advantage of being a quantitative assay, which can be implemented more easily in the field setting. Other future developments include testing the application of the assay in other accessible specimens, such as saliva, urine, feces, and semen.
