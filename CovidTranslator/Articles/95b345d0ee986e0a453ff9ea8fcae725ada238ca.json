In particular, front-line health care workers -emergency medicine physicians, intensivists, anesthesiologists, nurses, and many others -have continued to care for massive surges of COVID-19 patients in the setting of health systems illprepared for the level of disease severity with dangerous, worldwide shortages of personal protective equipment (PPE) and protocols that might attenuate health worker risk overwhelmed. Over 9,000 health care workers have developed infection internationally including 3,400 in China and over 6, 200 in Italy, as well as hundreds of infections in United States personnel. 4 During this time of a global health emergency, rapid communication, international collaboration, and transparency are critical to better inform and adapt the guidance of precautionary measures when new evidence becomes available. Countries around the world have responded in different ways in managing risk to ophthalmologists and patients in the absence of signs or symptoms of COVID-19. Preparedness through risk mitigation strategies for the public, patient and providers are warranted and should be informed by available evidence and our collective, global experience. The gaps in evidence that we face also need to be addressed during this pandemic to guide international consensus and inform preparedness measures for future outbreaks. Limiting ambulatory care services to time-sensitive or urgent conditions, particularly in high-volume specialties such as ophthalmology, have also been recommended to reduce the potential for transmission in the community and physician offices. However, measures within the clinic are also needed to mitigate risk for patients with urgent or emergent complaints, and routine evaluations as the outbreak abates.",

Clinic management: Contacting patients prior to their appointments to ask those with fever or respiratory symptoms not to attend the clinic is essential. The majority of patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection may be asymptomatic, 8 and shedding appears to be highest in the earliest stage. Thus, asymptomatic carriers of SARS-CoV-2 may confer a particular risk to ophthalmologists during examination. 8 Specific factors may place ophthalmologists at increased risk of infection during examination of their patients, compared to the risk experienced by clinicians in other disciplines. Specialties that may also be at higher risk of infection include anaesthesiologists who are routinely exposed to aerosolized respiratory secretions and otorhinolaryngologists related to sinus and nasopharyngeal procedures.",

Of the health care workers who died from COVID-19 in Wuhan, three were Chinese ophthalmologists who worked in the same unit including Li Wenliang, who believed that he had been infected while treating an asymptomatic glaucoma patient. 9, 10 The route of transmission in these cases is unknown, but the upper respiratory system and nasopharynx are a major site of viral infection, and likely present a higher risk to the ophthalmologist than exposure to tear film harbouring SARS-CoV2. Recent studies have shown that viral RNA may be observed in association with the small minority of patients who display conjunctivitis (i.e. < 1% of patients with COVID-19 presented with conjunctivitis). Viral RNA has not been identified in the tear film of COVID-19 patients without conjunctivitis to-date, but data representing sampling performed early in disease when viral load is highest are lacking. 11, 12, 13 The World Health Organization (WHO) and United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) have recommended the use of full PPE for the examination of PUIs and COVID-19 patients. The face masks can be divided into N95 respirators and surgical masks, and both have different uses. The N95 respirator is designed with filtration requirements to prevent inhalation of small airborne particles and minimize leakage from the facial seal. 14 As such, it protects the wearer from the inhalation of viral particles. Surgical masks are often fitted loosely but can prevent respiratory droplet transmission and prevent hand-to-face contact. They are considered to be more effective in preventing spread from an infected person wearing the mask to another than in protecting the wearer from infection. In a randomized clinical trial, the use of N95 respirators and surgical masks were found to have comparable outcomes in protection from influenza virus in outpatient settings 14 ; however, N95 respirators are the preferred option when dealing with PUIs or COVID-19 patients.",

The rapidly growing number of COVID-19 cases throughout the world has prompted state and federal authorities to institute measures to contain, suppress and mitigate the pandemic. Advisory measures include social distancing, working from home, and safe hygiene practices. Legal measures have included global travel restrictions, reduction or postponement of elective and non-urgenthealth services and surgeries, and government-mandated \"lockdowns\" and curfews.5",

Active screening of all patients and very limited companions can be instituted via a targeted questionnaire and non-contact temperature check at the clinic or hospital entrance. Following check-in, having patients wait in their cars or in open spaces outside the office for cellular phone notification are options, as well as increased spacing between patients in office waiting rooms. For patients with respiratory symptoms or a fever and an urgent or emergent visual complaint, masking the patient, expedient patient movement to the exam room, a prompt focused exam by a provider and equipment disinfection are critical. ii. Staff protection: With the reduction in patient numbers, an accompanying reduction to only essential personnel limits staff risk. Conversion to virtual meetings can often meet administrative and educational priorities. Leave of absence for respiratory symptoms or self-quarantine for individuals returning from high-risk, travel advisory locations are necessary, while health declaration and temperature monitoring of staff should occur daily for those who are in the clinic. Judicious use of PPE, proper training in donning and doffing protocols, and avoidance of physical contact with patients should guide staff-patient interactions. For persons under investigation (PUI) and those with a confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis, a mask for the patient and full PPE for the provider including a single use N95 mask and eye protection is required. iii. Environmental precautions: Droplet and fomite precautions are essential when managing patients with urgent or emergent eye disease. In all cases, a disinfection protocol for all potentially contaminated equipment (i.e. slit lamp biomicroscope, surfaces, indirect ophthalmoscope, lenses) is needed. Large breath shields on slit lamps may act as a barrier to respiratory droplet transmission. Protecting the patient: Subspecialty guidance and telemedicine Within the US, strategies are rapidly evolving to develop expert panel subspecialty guidelines that stratify the urgency of in-person examination. Moreover, the use of telemedicine including home visual function testing, transmission of image and video, and face-to-face interactions via widely available applications can provide ophthalmologists with opportunities to provide limited care and counselling. Importantly, these interactions may provide reassurance to patients about their disease or identify symptoms that require an in-person evaluation. To broaden access through widespread use of technology, federal authorities in the U.S. have waived normal privacy guidelines with categories of telemedicine (Medicare telehealth, virtual check-in and E-visits). 7Protecting the providerRisk reduction strategies during this outbreak should follow CDC standard precautions and transmission-based precautions for contact and respiratory routes of transmission of SARS-CoV2. However, there is also an imperative to judiciously utilize PPE given the worldwide shortages for front-line providers.",

Within countries, policies may vary regionally (e.g. Milan, Lombardy may vary from Bologna, Emilia-Romagna). The majority of ophthalmic clinics have restricted their practices to urgent and emergent cases only, although some practices have suspended ophthalmic services completely. 14 In most countries, ophthalmologists and patients are required to wear surgical face masks instead of N95 respirators. On-site temperature screening and regular hand hygiene are broadly required for both patients and doctors. Given the rapid surge of COVID-19 and mortality rates, some countries (e.g. China) have taken a \"make no mistake\" approach where the ophthalmologists are required to wear full PPE (including N95 masks) for all patients. Many practices (US, UK/Europe, China, Korea, Singapore and Australia) are adopting custom designed or commercially available slit lamp breath shields to minimize respiratory droplet transmission during the ophthalmic exam.",
