            "text": "CD209 (DC-SIGN) is an important C-type lectin which acts a receptor of many pathogens. The single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) \u03ea336A\u03feG in the CD209 promoter has been demonstrated to regulate promoter activity and to be associated with several important infectious diseases, such as human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1), Mycobacterium tuberculosis, and Dengue fever. CD209 facilitates severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-coronavirus spike protein-bearing pseudotype driven infection of permissive cells in vitro. In keeping with previously published findings, our in vitro studies confirmed that this SNP modulates gene promoter activity. Genetic association analysis of this SNP with clinico-pathologic outcomes in 824 serologic confirmed SARS patients showed that the \u03ea336AG/GG genotype SARS patients was associated with lower standardized lactate-dehydrogenase (LDH) levels compared with the \u03ea336AA patients (p \u03ed 0.014, odds ratio \u03ed 0.40). High LDH levels are known to be an independent predictor for poor clinical outcome, probably related to tissue destruction from immune hyperactivity. Hence, SARS patients with the CD209 \u03ea336 AA genotype carry a 60% chance of having a poorer prognosis. This association is in keeping with the role of CD209 in modulating immune response to viral infection. The relevance of these findings for other infectious diseases and inflammatory conditions would be worth investigating. \u1b67",

            "text": "Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is a novel infectious pulmonary disease caused by the SARS Coronavirus (SARS-CoV), which probably originated in Southern China in the fall of 2002. The disease then spread to other parts of Asia, Europe, and Northern America, with more than 8000 cases reported worldwide [1] [2] [3] . In Hong Kong, there were approximately 1800 SARS patients with approximately 300 deaths. The consensus document of World Health Organization (WHO) reported that 20%-30% of individuals developed severe lung injury, resulting in an overall fatality rate of 15%-17% [4, 5] . Clinical studies in Hong Kong and Taiwanese SARS patients had shown that high lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels on admission were independently associated with adverse clinical outcome of the disease [2, 6, 7] . SARS pathogenesis studies have identified angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as a functional receptor for SARS-CoV [8] , and CLEC4M (or liver/lymph node-specific ICAM-3-grabbing nonintegrin [L-SIGN]) as a binding receptor for SARS-CoV [9] . CD209 (or dendritic cell-specific ICAM-3-grabbing nonintegrin [DC-SIGN]), which shares 77% amino acid identity with CLEC4M [10, 11] , was found to interact with the spike (S)-protein of the virus, enhancing pseudotyped SARS-CoV S-protein-driven infection and facilitating viral transmission to susceptible cells [12, 13] . CD209, a C-type lectin expressed on subsets of human dendritic cells (DCs) and alveolar macrophages [10, 14, 15] , functions both as a cell-adhesion and as a pathogen-recognition receptor [16] . It has been shown that CD209 as a pathogen-recognition receptor allows DCs to capture and interact with a plethora of pathogens, such as Mycobacterium leprae [17] , M. tuberculosis [18] , parasites and other viruses such as HIV-1 [19] , Ebola [20] , hepatitis C virus (HCV) [21] , and Dengue virus [22] . As an adhesion receptor, it plays an important role in many DC functions, such as DC-T cell interaction and DC migration [23, 24] .",

In the CD209 promoter region, a putative functional variant \u03ea336A\u03feG (dbSNP: rs4804803) affecting a Sp1-like binding site has been described [30] . This promoter SNP was found to affect the transcription activity of CD209 in vitro [30] . Moreover, it was found to have significant association with susceptibility to HIV-1 infection, M. tuberculosis infection, and human T-cell lymphotropic virus type-1 infection [31] [32] [33] [34] . For instance, the \u03ea336G allele was found to be associated with susceptibility to parenteral but not mucosal for HIV-1 infection in Caucasian individuals, although this finding was not replicated in individuals of African descent [32] . This allele was also found associated with severity of Dengue fever disease in the Thai population [30] .",

Our previous association study for SARS-CoV infection showed that the ICAM3 Asp143Gly SNP (\u03e9443A\u03feG; dbSNP: rs2304237) demonstrated significant association with higher LDH levels and lower total white blood cell counts on admission [27] . Replacement of a charged aspartate by a neutral glycine of this ICAM3 SNP may affect exposure of an N-linked glycosylation site, possibly affecting interaction between ICAM3 and CD209. In this study, using in vitro competitive electrophoretic mobility shift assay and luciferase promoter activity assay, we confirm the findings reported by Sakuntabhai et al. [30] , showing that CD209 promoter \u03ea336A\u03feG SNP could affect the binding of nuclear extract proteins and regulate promoter activity. Given our previously observed significant association between the ICAM3 SNP with high standardized LDH levels and low white blood cell (WBC) counts [27] , and the functional relationship of ICAM3 with CD209, we hypothesized that the CD209 \u03ea336A\u03feG SNP may also show a similar association, and may have a synergistic effect with the ICAM3 SNP.",

Because of the variation in the reference range of LDH level used by different hospitals, LDH levels on admission was standardized by dividing the actual values by the upper limit of normal reference range as previously described [27] . Comparison between the mean measurements of patients having wild-type versus the variant genotype was first examined using a Mann-Whitney test. To identify the suitable cut-off point to dichotomize measurement values for statistical analysis, the value of the standardized LDH levels was arranged in ascending order, forming a curve that fit into a polynomial trend line. The cut-off value was taken at the point when the values begin to change exponentially. Cases with standardized LDH levels greater than or equal to the cut-off were categorized as high standardized LDH level, whereas cases with levels less than the cut-off were classified as low standardized LDH level. Allele and genotype distributions of the CD209 SNP in these standardized LDH level groups were assessed using 2 test using SPSS for Windows (Version 13.0), and odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were used to measure the strength of association. Logistic regression and interaction model analysis using SPSS 13 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL) was performed as described [37] for analysis of synergistic effect.",

The overall mean of standardized LDH levels for the \u03ea336G-positive group (1.03 \u03ee 0.04) was around the upper limit of the normal range, in contrast to the \u03ea336 G-negative group (1.14 \u03ee 0.03), which was 14% above the upper limit of the normal physiologic range. Such 14% excess of physiologic reference levels most likely carries biologic significance. Increase in serum LDH activity is postulated to be a result of massive tissue destruction related to immune hyperactivity during the acute phase of SARS-CoV infection [38] . Indeed, high LDH levels on admission has previously been shown to be an independent prognostic indicator of SARS infection which can help clinicians to predict adverse clinical outcome [2, 6, 7] . The patients who died of SARS were too few in our cohort for valid statistical analysis. As our patients were recruited from six different hospitals, differences in management preferences introduced confounding factors, which rendered clinical parameters inappropriate for use as adverse clinical outcome measures. In contrast, laboratory parameters can be easily standardized as a ratio of the upper limit of normal reference range. Thus, besides being clinically relevant, standardized in this manner, LDH levels on admission could be used as a surrogate marker for adverse disease outcome.",

It has been reported that a cytokine and chemokine storm occurs with a significant elevation of T-helper cell cytokine IFN-\u2425, inflammatory cytokine IL-1, IL-6, IL-12, monocyte-chemoattractant protein-1 and T h 1 IFN-\u2425-induced protein-10 during the early phase of SARS-CoV infection [39] with \"ground glass\" changes on chest radiography [40] . Individuals who died during the first 10 days of illness show pathologic evidence of diffuse alveolar damage with a mixed alveolar infiltrate, lung edema, and hyaline membrane formation [41] .

The G allele of CD209 \u03ea336A\u03feG might thus be protective for lung injury during the progression of SARS infection.",

Asian populations have the lowest frequency, with that among Chinese patients in our study 8.7%, that in Thai individuals reported as 8% [30] , and that in an Asian group studied 5.4% [34] , which is significantly different from that observed in European Caucasian, African, and American-African populations (\u03fe20%) [30, 31, 33, 34] (dbSNP assay # ss15355133). Such genetic heterogeneity between populations of a SNP that can influence CD209 expression levels is supportive of its possible contribution to the process of natural selection. This SNP has been shown to have significant association for parenteral HIV-1 infection [32] , tuberculosis [31] , human T-cell lymphotropic virus infection [34] , and Dengue fever infection [30] , suggesting its role in natural selection for individuals who survived from lethal disease/pathogen challenge. Indeed, studies have found genetic imprinting by natural selection imposed through pathogen pressures on human genes involved in immune response or in host-pathogen interactions, such as HLA [42, 43] and CCR5 [44] .",

The present study found the homozygote wild-type (or \u03ea336Gnegative genotype) of the CD209 \u03ea336A\u03feG SNP was associated with higher standardized LDH levels on admission. Combined genotype analysis of CD209 \u03ea336A\u03feG and ICAM3 \u03e9443A\u03feG showed that the overall combined genotypes was significantly associated with LDH levels, with the \u03e9443GG/\u03ea336AA genotype having significantly highest standardized LDH levels. Patients with this \u03e9443GG/\u03ea336AA genotype had a 4.34-fold increased risk for higher standardized LDH levels on admission. Although the com- bined analysis gave statistically significant results, results from multivariate logistic regression analysis failed to demonstrate a synergistic effect between the two SNPs. The physical locations of CD209 and ICAM3, \u03fe2.5Mb apart on chromosome 19q13, and the high recombination rate within this region (obtained from HapMap http://www.hapmap.org), suggest that the loci of these two SNPs are highly independent. In summary, our in vitro experiments confirmed the findings of Sakuntabhai et al. [30] that the \u03ea336A\u03feG promoter SNP has a role of in transcriptional regulation of CD209. Our genetic association study showed that the \u03ea336A\u03feG variant of CD209 was associated with higher standardized LDH levels on admission which is an independent prognostic indicator for SARS, suggesting that the \u03ea336A\u03feG polymorphism of CD209 may influence the outcome of SARS infection. This functional SNP may alter the CD209 gene expression thus altering host immune response. The relevance of this finding in relation to other infectious diseases or inflammatory conditions would be worth investigation.",
