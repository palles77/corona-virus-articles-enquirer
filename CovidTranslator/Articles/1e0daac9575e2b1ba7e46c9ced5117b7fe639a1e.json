The nanoESI MS analysis of neuraminic acids after treatment of BSM with NanS-p gave evidence that NanS-p variants of EHEC O157:H7 strain EDL933 cleave off O-acetyl groups from mono-, di-, and tri-O-acetylated Neu5Ac and N-glycolylneuraminic acid (Neu5Gc), regardless of the carbon positions C7, C8 or C9 of the acetate esters.

One of the natural reservoirs of EHEC strains is the intestinal tract of ruminants, especially cattle, where they can survive in the presence of mucus-derived carbohydrates (Aperce et al., 2014; Bertin et al., 2013; Fox et al., 2009 ). EHEC O157:H7 strains have caused numerous cases and outbreaks during the last decades (Page and Liles, 2013) Most strains of this serotype express Shiga toxin (Stx) 1 and/or Stx2 with their different variants and the locus of enterocyte effacement (LEE), encoding a type III secretion system (Scheutz et al., 2011; Stevens and Frankel, 2014) . The first reported EHEC O157:H7 outbreak occurred in 1982 where at least 47 people developed diarrhea in Michigan and Oregon after consuming contaminated meat in a fast-food restaurant (Riley et al., 1983) . One of the strains that have been isolated during this outbreak was EDL933 (O'Brien et al., 1993) . Up to now, this is one of the bestcharacterized EHEC O157:H7 strains worldwide and was therefore used in the current study. The primary site of infection in the human body is the large intestine, where EHEC cells adhere to the intestinal epithelium, damage this cellular barrier by the action of type III effector proteins and translocate Stx into the blood system (Nguyen and Sperandio, 2012) . Infecting EHEC strains may evade host defence, gain access to growth substrates and overcome colonization resistance mechanisms (Stecher and Hardt, 2011) . They replicate in the colon during the course of infection, but up to now, the mechanisms of competition with the microbiota and carbon nutrition are only poorly understood. An important carbon source for EHEC are breakdown products of the gastrointestinal mucus that are produced by the host in high amounts each day . Many commensal gut microorganisms attain required C-and N-sources from mucin glycoproteins (Johansson et al., 2009 (Johansson et al., , 2011 Marcobal et al., 2013) . Endowed with various glycoside hydrolases and exploiting synergistic mechanisms between them they are well adapted to grow in the mucus environment (Marcobal et al., 2013) .",

To get access to the limited nutrients in large intestine, replication of EHEC strains depends on mechanisms to compete at least for one of the mucus-derived carbohydrates or to be otherwise metabolically flexible (Conway and Cohen, 2015) . Commensal non-pathogenic E. coli represent presumably the major competitors in the gut, because they exhibit a similar genetic background as EHEC do. Thus, the expression of additional genes involved in sugar catabolism, which are located on genetic mobile elements in EHEC, is imperative for the assertiveness of EHEC towards commensal E. coli. Mucus-derived sugars as fucose, galactose, N-acetylglucosamine, Nacetylgalactosamine or N-acetylneuraminic acid (Neu5Ac) can be utilized by EHEC as well as by commensal E. coli (Aperce et al., 2014; Chang et al., 2004; Fabich et al., 2008) .",

Neu5Ac is highly abundant in glycans of the large intestine (Robbe et al., 2003) , where E. coli preferentially colonizes, compared to the small intestine ( Barnett Foster, 2013; Torres et al., 2005) . N-glycolylneuraminic acid (Neu5Gc) is the hydroxylated derivative of Neu5Ac carrying an OH-group in the N-acetyl chain at carbon C5. Neu5Gc is generated by the enzyme CMP-Neu5Ac-hydroxylase, which is expressed as functional enzyme in all mammals except humans, who produce an inactive enzyme due a deletion in the corresponding chromosome (Peri et al., 2018) . Although humans lack a functioning CMP-Neu5Ac-hydroxylase, Neu5Gc has been found in low quantities in human mucins most likely due to catabolic incorporation from nutritional Neu5Gc derived from red meat (Varki and Schauer, 2009 ). Furthermore, neuraminic acids exhibit a large heterogeneity in the gut with respect to structural modifications of their hydroxyl groups. A very common modification is the O-acetylation with up to four O-acetyl residues at carbon atoms C4, C7, C8 and C9 (Varki and Schauer, 2009; Vimr, 2013) . Neu5Ac is the major sialic acid present in mucin, followed by the mono-O-acetylated Neu5Ac-variants Neu5,9Ac 2 , Neu5,7Ac 2 and Neu5,8Ac 2 . Less common are the di-O-acetylated Neu5Ac-species Neu5,8,9Ac 3 and Neu5,7,9Ac 3 (Robbe et al., 2003) .",

The three variants were investigated as representatives of the EDL933 NanS-p and were selected due to phylogenetic reasons (Saile et al., 2016) . For analysis of the role of NanS-p, several nanS and nanS-p deletion mutants have been constructed up to a supermutant that did not contain any nanS or nanS-p genes, and their role in substrate utilization has been demonstrated (Saile et al., 2016) . Compared to nanS, the nanS-p genes harbour additional nucleotides downstream of the SGNH hydrolase-like domain and a DUF1737 domain.

After enzyme treatment, we qualitatively analysed the extent of O-acetylation by means of HPTLC (see above). The results of the exposure of Neu5,9Ac 2 and Neu5,4 Ac 2 with the EHEC O-acetylesterases are shown in Fig. 1A and Fig. 1B , respectively. Incubation of Neu5,9Ac 2 with NanS-His (Fig. 1A, lane 4) , NanS-p1-His (Fig. 1A, lane 5) , NanS-p2-His (Fig. 1A, lane 6) and NanS-p4-His (Fig. 1A, lane 7) resulted in a HPTLC band that separated at the position of Neu5Ac reference in the chromatogram (Fig. 1A) , indicating the de-O-acetylation of Neu5,9Ac 2 to Neu5Ac. Thus, all tested enzymes were capable to cleave the O-acetyl group from carbon atom C9, while Neu5,9Ac 2 remained intact in the buffer controls without enzyme (Fig. 1A, lane 3) when compared to the applied Neu5,9Ac 2 standard (Fig. 1A, lane 2) . It should be mentioned that the Neu5,9Ac 2 preparation used in this study contained a small amount of Neu5Ac, which did not affect complete de-O-acetylation of the Neu5,9Ac 2 substrate to the Neu5Ac end product by the four EHEC O-acetylesterases.

Afterwards, the chemically released sialic acids were identified by nanoESI MS. Mass spectra of sialic acids obtained after exposure of BSM to the recombinant O-acetylesterases are exemplarily shown for NanS-His and NanS-p1-His in Fig. 2B and 2C, respectively. Identified sialic acids with the corresponding ion species and their m/z values are listed in Table 2B and C, respectively. Spectra of BSM-derived sialic acids upon exposure to NanS-His or NanS-p1-His evidenced predominant Neu5Ac and Neu5Gc core structures, accompanied by weaker signals, which could be assigned to mono-O-acetylated Neu5Ac(OAc) and Neu5Gc(OAc) species and the di-O-acetylated Neu5Ac(OAc) 2 derivative. Importantly, Neu5Ac(OAc) 3 and Neu5Gc(OAc) 3 variants, which appear in the spectra at m/z 458.13 and m/z 474.13, respectively, were undetectable after O-acetylesterase treatment. Similar results were obtained with recombinant NanS-p2-His and NanS-p4-His (data not shown). Our results show that NanS as well as NanS-p are able to release acetyl residues not only from mono-O-acetylated sialic acids, but also from di-and tri-O-acetylated sialic acids as demonstrated for Neu5Ac(OAc) 2 , Neu5Ac(OAc) 3 , and their di-and tri-O-acetylated Neu5Gc counterparts. Furthermore, we could show that NanS and NanS-p have the ability to deacetylate O-acetylated sialic acids in soluble form and linked to O-glycans of mammalian mucin.",

For this purpose, we incubated BSM with either sialidase BTSA-His, or coincubated BSM with sialidase BTSA-His and either NanS-His, NanS-p1-His, NanS-p2-His or NanS-p4-His. After an exposure time of 4 h, we determined the sialic acids released from BSM first by means of HPTLC. The results of the enzymatic digestions of BSM using BTSA-His alone and combined with NanS-His, NanS-p1-His, NanS-p2-His or NanS-p4-His are shown in Fig. 3 . One mg/mL Neu5Ac (Fig. 3, lanes 1, 9) or Neu5,9Ac 2 (Fig. 3,  lanes 2, 10) were used as standards. Due to its higher polarity, Neu5,9Ac 2 clearly separates beyond Neu5Ac allowing for unequivocal distinction of the two compounds.

The enzyme seems not to exhibit any specificity for Neu5Ac or the O-acetylated derivative. Coincubation of BSM with BTSA-His and O-acetylesterases revealed Neu5Ac only, while Neu5,9Ac 2 could not be detected. Due to the suggested capability of NanS-His and its homologs to deacetylate mono-, di-, and tri-O-acetylated sialic acids, the above described digests were repeated and the released sialic acids were detected using mass spectrometry. For this purpose, proteins of the digests were precipitated with methanol and the supernatants were directly applied to nanoESI MS. Mass spectra of sialic acids obtained from digests of BSM using BTSA-His alone, BTSA-His combined with NanS-His and BTSA-His combined with NanS-p1-His are shown in Fig. 4A , 4B and 4C, respectively. Identified sialic acids with the m/z values of the corresponding ions are listed in Table 3A -C, respectively. The mass spectrum obtained from BSM exposed to BTSA-His alone (Fig. 4A) shows ions derived from Neu5Ac and Neu5Gc basic structures and Neu5Ac(OAc) and Neu5Gc (OAc) (listed in Table 3A ). Thus, BTSA-His was capable to cleave off Neu5Ac and Neu5Gc as well as the mono-O-acetylated counterparts from glycans.

However, if BTSA-His was added to the medium, significant differences in the OD 600 between EDL933\u0394nanS\u0394nanS-p1a-p7 and EDL933 or EDL933\u0394nanS was detected with values of 0.91, 1.32 or 1.24, respectively (Fig. 5) . For all strains, an increased OD 600 was observed when BTSA-His was added, compared to the cultivation without BTSA-His. An explanation for this phenomenon is that both, Neu5Ac and Neu5,9Ac 2 , terminally bound to the mucin, were released by BTSA-His, whereby the degradation of Neu5Ac was unaffected by the deletions. Thus, Neu5,9Ac 2 may be additionally utilized by EDL933 or EDL933\u0394nanS. As a control a culture of EDL933\u0394nanS\u0394nanS-p1a-p7 was supplemented with NanS-p4-His, resulting in an OD 600 comparable to that of a wildtype EDL933 culture.",

Sialic acids are highly abundant in the large intestine, where they decorate the mucus layer(s) in terminally exposed positions on the mucin O-glycans. Sialic acids can be modified by up to three acetic acid esters at the positions of the hydroxyl groups of the sialic acid core including Neu5Gc species, whereby Neu5Gc and its derivatives do exist in all mammals except humans (Robbe et al., 2003; Varki and Schauer, 2009; Vimr, 2013) . While pure Neu5Ac and Neu5Gc are readily cleavable by bacterial sialidases, O-acetylation protects them from enzymatic hydrolysis (Juge et al., 2016) . The intestinal E. coli strains are generally considered competitors for EHEC strains owing to their similar genetic background. Both groups harbor genes for sialic acid metabolism and are able to utilize free sialic acids as carbon and nitrogen sources. Compared to commensal nonpathogenic E. coli, EHEC harbor several phage-encoded NanS homologs (NanS-p) (Saile et al., 2016 (Saile et al., , 2018 . These enzymes catalyze de-O-acetylation of Neu5,9Ac 2 to Neu5Ac, which after sialidase action can be taken up and metabolized by both, commensal and pathogenic E. coli (Saile et al., 2016 (Saile et al., , 2018 . Currently, it is not known, why EHEC strains contain a chromosomal nanS gene and multiple prophage-associated nanS-p genes. One hypothesis is that multiple nanS-p genes confer a gene dose effect to ensure substrate utilization and to outcompete commensal E. coli in the gut (Saile et al., 2016) .",

NanoESI MS spectra of chemically released sialic acids from BSM revealed ion signals of mono-, di-, and tri-O-acetylated Neu5Ac and Neu5Gc derivatives. NanS and NanS-p were capable to de-O-acetylate such O-acetylated sialic acids of BSM as determined by nanoESI MS analysis. Since various of the known microbial 9-O-acetylesterases are unable to de-O-acetylate Neu5,4 Ac 2 , we probed the specificity of NanS and the NanS-p esterases with respect to cleavage of the acetyl ester at C4 of Neu5Ac. HPTLC analysis revealed that neither NanS nor the NanS-p esterases are able to split off the O-acetyl group from this position. Mass spectra of NanS-or NanS-p-treated mucin still exhibited ion signals of O-acetylated sialic acids. Since O-acetyl groups are mostly located at position C4 and/or C9, it is tempting to speculate that the detected mono-O-acetylated Neu5Ac-species represent the Neu5,4 Ac 2 isomer. Otherwise, an incomplete digestion or inactivation of the enzymes due to long-lasting incubation at elevated temperature could be the reason.",

Although EHEC does not encode a sialidase, de-Oacetylation of bound sialic acids leads to liberation of acetate, which in turn can be readily used as an additional carbon source. However, de-Oacetylation results in sialidase-accessible Neu5Ac or Neu5Gc basic structures, which are common substrates of commensal sialidases, e.g., BTSA of B. thetaiotaomicron. In order to verify this hypothesis, we probed the removal of BSM-bound sialic acids with BTSA-His. This sialidase hydrolyzes pure Neu5Ac and Neu5Gc and also the mono-Oacetylated counterparts Neu5Ac(OAc) and Neu5Gc(OAc). Di-and tri-Oacetylated sialic acids were resistant towards BTSA giving evidence for a protective effect of O-acetylated sialic acids from degradation.",

Even though B. thetaiotaomicron encodes sialidases, this bacterium lacks the nan operon and is unable to utilize released sialic acids as a nutrient. Therefore, the complementary action of both enzymes may result in a higher content of free sialic acids in the gut. In order to assess the growth-promoting effect of a mixed enzyme treatment, we cultivated the EHEC O157:H7 wildtype strain EDL933, and its mutant strains EDL933\u0394nanS and EDL933\u0394nanS\u0394nanS-p1a-p7 on mucin, mucin supplemented with BTSA-His and mucin exposed to BTSA-His combined with NanS-p-His. The combination revealed a significantly enhanced bacterial growth suggesting that EHEC exploits sialidases of commensal gut bacteria, and is supported by own Oacetylesterases to get access to O-glycan-derived sialic acids of intestinal mucus. On principle, sialic acids per se and particularly the Oacetylated species prevent from subsequent digest of desialylated glycans by glycosidases (Phansopa et al., 2015) . Collectively, the sialidasemediated release of sialic acids combined with complementary saponification of acetic acid side chains allows for ensuing stepwise digest of desialylated glycans by glycosidases such as galactosidases, N-acetylhexosaminidases or fucosidases. It can be speculated that the primary role of NanS-p esterases during infection could be the perturbation of the mucus layer integrity and initiation of commensal degradation, which may enable or at least facilitate EHEC strains crossing of the mucus barrier and getting access to the epithelial cells in the colon.",
