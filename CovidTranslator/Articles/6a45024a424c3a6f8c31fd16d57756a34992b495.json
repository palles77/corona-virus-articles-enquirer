Timely health communication, along with surveillance, quarantine, isolation, and travel restrictions, figured prominently among the tools the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) used to help contain the outbreak. During the SARS response, health communication was shown to be an integral element by ensuring that knowledge about prevention measures reached the public, healthcare providers, the media, and other stakeholders.",

These documents were disseminated through an automated fax information service, a voice information service, and a telephone hotline, as well as traditional print media.

First, a fact sheet was transmitted by fax or electronic mail to emergency department physicians and infectioncontrol practitioners at 102 hospitals in New York City and to all acute-care hospitals and county health departments in the state. Second, a special plague advisory was distributed to 20,000 physicians in New York City (3).",

Web sites that referred to these pages with a substantial number of visits included those from 1) organizations serving constituent groups such as families adopting children from Asia and expatriates overseas, 2) organizations with major meetings or conferences in areas with SARS, and 3) major news organizations. Overall, during the outbreak, DGMQ generated >125 documents, including updates and translations into seven languages, which were posted on the SARS pages of the CDC Web site. This material was written for multiple audiences, from highly technical to low literacy, and was disseminated through multiple platforms, from traditional print (e.g., >2,700,000 yellow Health Alert Notices were handed out by Quarantine Officers to passengers disembarking from 11,840 flights from areas with SARS) to electronic (postings on Web sites and CDC's Secure Data Network).",

Historically, CDC has never advised against travel to any region, even during the plague epidemic in India. However, because of the rapid spread of SARS, its short incubation period, and the potential severity of illness, the need was recognized to codify different levels of concern about potential transmission to travelers. Thus, the travel alert and advisory system was developed. 1 A travel alert is a notification by CDC that an outbreak of a disease is occurring in a geographic area. Its purpose is to provide information to travelers and resident expatriates about the status of an outbreak, how to reduce their risk for infection, and what to do if they become ill. The risk for individual travelers is thought to be definable and limited. In contrast, a travel advisory recommends against nonessential travel to an area because the risk to travelers is considered to be high as a result of ongoing transmission or inadequate containment. The travel advisory not only provides information about the status of an outbreak, but also is intended to reduce risk for exposure by decreasing the volume of traffic to the affected area.",

Institution of either an alert or advisory was dependent on the magnitude and scope of the outbreak, the containment measures being used, the quality of surveillance in the affected area, and the quality and accessibility of medical care, all of which are based on reports from the involved countries. Once instituted, downgrading an advisory to an alert required adequate surveillance and no evidence of ongoing transmission for at least two incubation periods after the date of onset of symptoms in the last case (for SARS, 20 days). Removing an alert was dependent on the above criteria, as well as lack of evidence of new cases for three incubation periods (for SARS, 30 days) and no exportation of cases, as determined by an assessment of the information reported from the countries involved. During the outbreak, the relationship between DGMQ and the airline industry through the Airline Transport Association (ATA) and the airline medical directors was strengthened. As international spread of SARS through airline travel became a possibility, ATA was not only eager to provide information necessary for tracking passengers, but also served as a sounding board for specific guidelines for the traveler, flight crew, cargo handlers, and cleaning crew, and for the management of ill passengers. Other stakeholders included the cruise ship industry and U.S. citizens living overseas.",
