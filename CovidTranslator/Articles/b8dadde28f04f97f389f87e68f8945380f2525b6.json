In childhood HPS, Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is the major causative agent, and red blood cells (RBCs) are predominantly phagocytosed by macrophages. To investigate the mechanism of RBC phagocytosis triggered by EBV infection, we adopted a rabbit model of EBVassociated HPS previously established by using Herpesvirus papio (HVP). The kinetics of virus-host interaction was studied. Using flow cytometry, we detected the emergence of antibody-coated RBCs, as well as anti-platelet antibodies, at peak virus load period at weeks 3 to 4 after HVP injection, and the titers increased thereafter. The presence of anti-RBCs preceded RBC phagocytosis in tissues and predicted the full-blown development of HPS. The anti-RBC antibodies showed cross-reactivity with Paul-Bunnell heterophile antibodies. Preabsorption of the HVP-infected serum with control RBCs removed the majority of anti-RBC activities and remarkably reduced RBC phagocytosis. The RBC phagocytosis was specifically mediated via an Fc fragment of antibodies in the presence of macrophage activation. Therefore, the emergence of anti-RBC antibodies and the presence of macrophage activation are both essential in the development of HPS. Our observations in this animal model provide a potential mechanism for hemophagocytosis in EBV infection.",

            "text": "Hemophagocytic syndrome (HPS) is a fatal disorder frequently associated with microbial infections such as Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), 1 cytomegalovirus, 2 and recently, H5N1 influenza virus. 3 Although this syndrome is diverse in etiology and genetic association, HPS shares common clinical and laboratory features and is characterized by fever, hepatosplenomegaly, hypercytokinemia, cytopenia, coagulopathy, and a systemic proliferation of macrophages with phagocytosis of blood cells. 4 -7 Among the viral pathogens responsible for HPS, EBV accounts for more than 60% of HPS cases in young children. 5, 6 The pathogenesis of EBV-associated HPS has been proposed to result from a dysregulated cytotoxic T-cell response with macrophage activation in response to EBV infection in clinical conditions such as X-linked lymphoproliferative disorders and sporadic hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH). [7] [8] [9] [10] The phagocytic process by macrophages is by no means a random event but involves a meticulous interaction between ligands on the surface of phagocytosed cells and the receptors on the activated macrophages. 11, 12 Because macrophage activation is a common phenomenon in infectious diseases, the relative rarity of HPS and the frequent association of HPS with EBV raise such a possibility that EBV may play a specific role in triggering HPS. Furthermore, the major blood cells engulfed by macrophages in EBV-associated HPS are red blood cells (RBCs) or platelets, distinct from the predominant lymphocytes in H5N1 influenza infection and other conditions such as Rosai-Dorfman disease. 3 , 13 To investigate why specific blood cells are selectively phagocytosed by macrophages in different conditions should help to clarify the pathogenesis of virus-associated HPS.",

            "text": "One clue to resolve this issue comes from the observations that virus infection may induce a wide spectrum of polyclonal B-cell and antibody responses against RBCs, platelets, lymphocytes, and endothelial cells. 14 -16 The cell types that are opsonized, ie, prepared for phagocytosis by specific antibodies, may represent the selective targets of phagocytosis by activated macrophages mediated through Fc receptors. Of note, production of Paul-Bunnell (PB) heterophile antibodies that agglutinate RBCs is a prevailing serological marker for acute EBV infection or infectious mononucleosis. 15, 17 The prevalence of anti-RBCs or heterophile antibodies in EBV infection may explain the frequent association of HPS with EBV. Therefore, we hypothesize that anti-RBC antibodies may play a pivotal role in triggering the phagocytosis of red cells in EBV-associated HPS. To test this hypothesis, we adopted a rabbit model of EBV-associated HPS previously established by Hayashi and colleagues 18 -20 using EBV-related Herpesvirus papio (HVP) . In this rabbit model, HVP is previously found to infect T and B cells, distinct from the predominant or exclusive infection of T or natural killer (NK) cells in HLH cases. 9, 21 Although not entirely similar to the disease entity of human HLH, this animal model still represents a valuable tool to investigate the pathogenesis of virus-associated HPS. In this study, we extended the study to the kinetics of virus-host interaction, and the development of anti-virus and anti-RBC antibodies was longitudinally followed, with correlation to the presence of hemophagocytosis in tissues. In vitro and ex vivo phagocytosis assay was further performed to clarify the role of anti-RBC antibodies in RBC phagocytosis by activated macrophages mediated via Fc receptor.",

Quantitative PCR studies showed that HVP DNA in rabbit sera was de-tectable from day 12, and the viral load peaked during weeks 3 to 4 after HVP inoculation and declined thereafter. HVP DNA could also be detected by PCR in most other tissues, such as spleens, lymph nodes, livers, and lungs from HVP-infected rabbits (data not shown).

Immunohistochemical studies revealed that the infiltrating lymphoid cells in liver and lungs were mostly CD5 T cells, and only rarely B cells (data not shown). The in situ EBER1 signals correlated to the white pulps of the spleen, which contained Band T-immunoreactive cells ( Figure 2C , top). To confirm the specificity of HVP-infected cells, immunomagnetic purification and fractionation of T and B cells was performed on spleen lymphocytes. HVP DNA could be detected in the fractions of T and B cells in spleen ( Figure 2C, bottom right) .

            "text": "Using FITC-labeled anti-rabbit immunoglobulin in flow cytometric analysis, we found that red cells from HVP-infected rabbits were coated with antibodies. The antibody-coated red cells appeared at around 2 weeks after virus inoculation, and the reactivities increased rapidly thereafter: 2% on day 13, 20% on day 22, and 60% on day 24. In the last week immediately before death, more than 90% of red cells were coated with antibodies ( Figure 3A) . Considering that patients with infectious mononucleosis produce heterophile antibodies that agglutinate red cells, we speculated that a link may exist between the heterophile antibodies and anti-red cell autoantibodies in our rabbit model. An agglutination test using a Monospot kit showed that all HVP-infected rabbits produced PB heterophile antibodies, whereas control rabbits did not ( Figure 3B, top) . The antibody-coated red cells closely correlated to the titers of heterophile antibodies during disease progression ( Table 1) . Preabsorption of HVPinfected sera with normal rabbit erythrocytes could significantly reduce the agglutination activity of heterophile antibodies. The titers of heterophile antibodies decreased from 1:250 to below 1:50 after preabsorption ( Figure 3B, bottom) . These results indicate that the antired cell antibodies in the serum of HVP-infected rabbits cross-reacted with PB heterophile antibodies in this rabbit model. In this rabbit model, we observed that the platelets in HVP-infected rabbits decreased with disease progression (data not shown). To clarify whether the HVP-infected rabbits also developed anti-platelet antibodies, we gated CD41 \u03e9 (platelet marker, Figure 3C ) cells to observe the antibody-coated platelets. As shown in Figure  3D , the antibody-coated platelets could be observed at day 9 after HVP inoculation and, similar to anti-RBC antibodies, the titers of anti-platelet antibodies increased with correlation to the severity of diseases. Figure 4 , A and B, summarizes the kinetics of virushost interaction in this HPS animal model. The first event detectable after virus inoculation was the appearance of HVP DNA in rabbit sera at day 12, followed by the production of anti-VCA antibodies in sera and the presence of viral genomes in PBMCs and tissues at day 19. The production of anti-RBC/heterophile antibodies developed at a relatively late stage, usually occurring when the virus load peaked during weeks 3 to 4 after HVP inoculation, and increased rapidly thereafter. Notably, the red cell phagocytosis in rabbit tissues could only be observed after the emergence of anti-RBC antibodies, suggesting that the coating of red cells with antibodies is a prerequisite for phagocytosis of red cells. The increasing titers of anti-RBC antibodies represented a reliable indicator to predict the full-blown diseases and impending mortality in HVP-infected rabbits.",

            "text": "To clarify whether both the presence of antibodies against red cells and macrophage activation are essential for the hemophagocytic process, we performed serial in vitro phagocytic studies. First, the human promonocytic cell line U937 was treated with or without TPA and tested for the activity to engulf FITC-labeled latex beads. U937 cells could phagocytose the fluorescent beads only when the U937 cells were preactivated by TPA (data not shown). Furthermore, the TPAtreated U937 cells could only engulf Coombs-treated cells ( Figure 5A , right; Coombs cell) but not control red cells ( Figure 5A, control) , indicating that the coating of a red cell with anti-RBC antibodies was required for phagocytosis by activated macrophages. For clarification of the relationship between the titers of antibodies present on red cell surfaces and the degree of RBC phagocytosis, different ratios of antibody-coated RBCs were used to measure the percentages of phagocyto-sis by flow cytometry. The fraction of macrophages was gated ( Figure 5B , top left), and the fluorescence intensity of the gated macrophages was measured. The Coombs cell study showed a higher nonspecific background attributable to the adherence of RBC lysate to the surface of activated macrophages. The fluorescence intensity of phagocytosed Coombs cells was measured over the M1-defined region ( Figure 5B , bottom left). As shown in Figure 5B (right), the activities of RBC phagocytosis by macrophages increased with the ratio of Coombs cells (human IgG-coated RBCs). Ex vivo phagocytosis assay further showed that the TPA-activated rabbit monocytes could engulf rabbit erythrocytes only when pretreated with HVP-infected rabbit sera ( Figure 5C, right) , but not the uninfected sera ( Figure 5C , left). To define clearly the specificity of the immunoglobulin fragments that reacted with macrophages, excess Fab fragments, Fc fragments, or the whole IgG molecules were used to compete with the antibodies of Coombs cells. Figure 5D demonstrates that Fc fragments as well as whole IgG molecules, but not Fab fragments, could completely block the engulfment of Coombs-treated cells by TPA-activated U937 cells, indicating that phagocytosis is mediated through Fc receptor. Taken together, the data shown above indicate that both the presence of anti-red cell antibodies and macrophage activation are essential for RBC phagocytosis, which is mediated via Fc fragments.",

In this study, we demonstrated by in vivo, ex vivo, and in vitro studies that the emergence of anti-RBC, and probably anti-platelet antibodies, after HVP infection is pivotal to trigger the phagocytic process in this rabbit model of EBV-associated HPS. Based on the dynamic kinetics of virus-host interaction in vivo as shown in Figure 4 , the emergence of anti-RBC antibodies always preceded the development of RBC phagocytosis in tissues and the increasing titers of anti-RBC antibodies predicted the full-blown development of HPS and the impending mortality of HVP-infected rabbits. Given that this rabbit model of EBV-associated HPS is not entirely similar to human HLH cases, the findings we observed in this study can still provide valuable information on the mechanism of hemophagocytosis in virus-associated HPS.",

As shown in this study, we demonstrated that both the phagocytic process and the specific types of blood cells phagocytosed by macrophages represent nonrandom biological events. In the absence of anti-RBC antibodies, red cell phagocytosis did not occur even in the presence of ac- tivated macrophages and vice versa. This observation may therefore explain the relative infrequency of HPS in most viral infections other than those observed with EBV and in virus-associated HLH patients.",

            "text": "EBV-associated HPS usually develops in patients with abnormal immune disorders such as X-linked lymphoproliferative disorders 22 or in rare conditions in which EBV infects T or NK cells such as HLH and NK/T cell lymphoma. 9,10,23 In X-linked lymphoproliferative disorders, the mutation of a suppressor SAP protein leads to dysregulated CTL response in primary EBV infection. 24, 25 In sporadic HLH patients, EBV usually infects T or NK cells rather than B cells, and EBV latent membrane protein-1 has been demonstrated to initiate the TRAFs/NF-B/SAP/ ERK signaling pathway to activate T cells and up-regulate Th1 cytokine secretion. [25] [26] [27] [28] Alternatively, HLH may result from mutations of perforin genes, leading to an ineffective CTL response to EBV infection. 21 Distinct from the predominant or exclusive infection of T or NK cells by EBV in HLH, 9, 21 HVP infects T cells, B cells, and possibly macrophages in this rabbit model. Virus infection of B cells may induce polyclonal activation of B lymphocytes and leads to the formation of a wide variety of autoantibodies, including those directed against smooth muscle, blood groups, lymphocytes, platelets, and erythrocytes. 29 -31 Summarizing the data, we presented in this study, we propose that the development of HPS requires two essential events, one involving dysregulated CTL immune response, which results in hypersecretion of Th1 cytokines and the subsequent activation of macrophages, and the other branch involving the autoreactive polyclonal B-cell response that produces autoantibodies against blood cells. Whether monocytes/macrophages can be infected by EBV is still controversial. Recent studies, however, have demonstrated the capability of EBV to infect and replicate in freshly isolated human monocytes. 32 The infection of macrophages by EBV may further activate macrophages. In this animal model, the infectivity of tissue macrophages by HVP was inconclusive because of too few cells to be obtained for flow cytometric analysis. However, HVP DNA could be detected in the CD14 \u03e9 monocyte fraction in PBMC. Therefore, the possibility of HVP infection of macrophages may exist. The infection of monocytes/macrophages by EBV/ HVP may further activate the macrophages to secrete monokines and make the cytokine storm worse in HPS.",

This epitope forms the basis for commercially available kits currently used for antibody detection in the diagnosis of infectious mononucleosis and was adopted in this study. Several explanations have been proposed to describe the mechanism of developing heterophile antibodies in EBV infection. Molecular mimicry of host cell DNA or proteins to viral gene products is the most pre-vailing theory. 31, 34 By preabsorption of HVP-infected sera with rabbit red cells in this study, the titers of heterophile antibodies were reduced significantly, suggesting that the PB heterophile antibodies may cross-react with or even represent the major components of anti-RBC antibodies in HVP-infected rabbit serum. One critical question is whether the finding of anti-RBC antibodies in this animal model can be applied to human HPS or HLH patients. We retrospectively retrieved serum samples from a total of 20 EBV-associated HPS patients for indirect Coombs test, and eight of them were positive (W.-C.H. and I.-J.S, unpublished data), suggesting that anti-RBC antibodies do exist in some of the EBV-HPS patients. We are now performing a prospective multicenter study using direct Coombs test to clarify the positivity of anti-RBC antibodies in EBV-HPS patients.",

The rabbits developed symptoms and signs typical to that of human HPS such as coagulopathy, cytopenia, and depletion of lymphoid systems and bone marrow.
