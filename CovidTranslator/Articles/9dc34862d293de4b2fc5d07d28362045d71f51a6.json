Emergency department (ED) clinicians are at high risk of exposure to both these and common communicable diseases. Personal protective equipment (PPE) is recommended to protect clinicians from acquiring, or becoming vectors of, infection, yet compliance is typically sub-optimal. Little is known about factors that influence use of PPE-specifically gloves and masks-during routine care in the ED. Methods: This was an ethnographic study, incorporating documentation review, field observations and interviews. The theoretical domains framework (TDF) was used to aid thematic analysis and identify relevant enablers of and barriers to optimal PPE use. Results: Thirty-one behavioural themes were identified that influenced participants' use of masks and gloves. There were significant differences, namely: more reported enablers of glove use vs more barriers to mask use. Reasons included more positive unit culture towards glove use, and lower perception of risk via facial contamination. Conclusion: Emerging infectious diseases, spread (among other routes) by respiratory droplets, have caused global outbreaks. Emergency clinicians should ensure that, as with gloves, the use of masks is incorporated into routine cares where appropriate. Further research which examines items of PPE independently is warranted. (R. Barratt).",

N95/P2 masks are usually reserved for a few diseases (chickenpox, measles, tuberculosis) in which pathogencontaminated droplet nuclei (residue from evaporated droplets) or dust particles can remain suspended in air for long periods and enter the upper and lower respiratory tracts.",

            "text": "There is limited recent literature examining the use of PPE in EDs. Following the introduction of universal precautions in the early 1990s [21] , a number of studies reported poor compliance with these measures in the ED [22] [23] [24] . More recently, Singh et al. used self-administered questionnaires to determine compliance with (what are now referred to as) standard precautions in the ED, and found that gloves were frequently used, but there was poor compliance with other PPE, especially eye protection [15] . Evanoff et al. [25] observed video footage to assess compliance with PPE during 304 invasive procedures in an ED and reported 96% glove use for trauma patient encounters, compared with 68% and 78%, for use of mask and protective eyewear, respectively. In a trauma centre study, the compliance rates for use of masks and eye protection, after an educational intervention, were 16% and 44%, respectively [26] . ED clinicians are regularly at risk of facial contamination during invasive procedures, intubation and other resuscitative measures [27] . They are also exposed to both seasonal and emerging respiratory infectious diseases. In one paediatric ED setting, only 1-12% of clinicians reported that they always or usually wore a mask or eye protection, while assessing febrile respiratory patients during winter [28] . Although gloves are worn frequently, patient safety may be compromised by misuse, such as not changing them between dirty and clean tasks on the same patient or between different patients and/or failing to comply with hand hygiene before and after use, which often contaminates the clinician's hands [29] [30] [31] . Commonly cited factors contributing to sub-optimal compliance with PPE in healthcare include inadequate knowledge and training, perception of risk, organisational culture and environmental barriers [32, 33] . Reid et al. [28] identified knowledge, access to PPE, patient diagnosis and unit culture, in the ED context, as factors influencing PPE compliance.",

While it is difficult to plan in advance for such a rare event, staff who are competent in the principles and practice of routine infection prevention and control (IPC) and PPE use are more likely to be better protected from the start and more prepared to implement high-level precautions rapidly and safely. In this area there is a paucity of literature which examines factors that facilitate or hinder the use of PPE during routine clini-cal care in the ED. Most previous studies have focused primarily on compliance with standard precautions during procedures that pose a high risk of exposure to blood and body fluids [25, 26] or on overall compliance with PPE use, without elucidating determinants of those behaviours [15] . They have described 'how' clinicians use PPE, whereas the present study aimed to shown 'why' PPE is, or is not, used by exploring the factors that influence the use-specifically of gloves and masks-during routine care, in one ED. We employed methods that allowed close engagement with clinicians so as to understand their choices and behaviours and utilised the Theoretical Domains Framework (TDF) [34] to assess the relevant enablers and barriers. A better understanding of these practices in this context could assist managers, educators and clinicians to optimise enablers and address barriers, locally, and inform health policy and pandemic planning more widely.",

It is difficult to ascertain whether the glove use was excessive as there is no published research that explores the indications for and use of gloves in an ED. A recent systematic review of glove use and transmission of infection in other inpatient departments concluded that gloves were often overused and misused [42] . The published literature related to hand hygiene auditing provides some indication of ED rates for glove use. During a hand hygiene observational study in an ED, Carter et al. [43] reported that only 32% of hand hygiene opportunities, whether or not hand hygiene was performed, were associated with glove use, indicating that in this setting, the majority of patient encounters did not incur the use of gloves. Nevertheless, when optimising behaviour for cross infection, attention should also be focused on hand hygiene practices associated with the use of gloves [29] .",

The apparent under-use of protective masks in this study reflects literature reports of low rates (3-25%) for mask compliance in the ED setting [25, 26, 44] . The optimal use of protective masks by healthcare workers has been shown to reduce transmission of sporadic and epidemic infectious diseases. During the global SARS outbreak in 2003, SARS-CoV transmission in a Vietnamese hospital was significantly reduced when protective mask use among clinical staff increased [45] . Skowronski et al. [46] attributes the prevention of SARS transmission within a Vancouver hospital to the prompt implementation of IPC measures, including PPE, in the ED for a traveller returning from Asia with severe influenza-like illness. This is in contrast to the outcome for a similar case in Toronto, when droplet and airborne precautions were not put in place in the ED for over 21 h, resulting in 14 further cases of cross infection [4] .",

            "text": "Many participants blamed the chaotic, fast-paced ED environment, as a significant barrier to using a mask. While this argument has been reported previously [44] , the same contextual reasoning could also apply to gloves, which are in fact regularly used and take longer to don and doff-at least if hand hygiene is included. Thus, other factors may be more influential determinants of mask use, such as the team behavioural norms in the department or the individual's perception of risk of infectious diseases. One barrier to optimal mask use demonstrated in our research was the strong personal belief about PPE use of some senior medical staff, which overrode IPC policy. This is reflective of a recent study which found that the clinical autonomy of doctors was a significant factor in their IPC practice [47] . In an ED where there are numerous 'leaders', different role models and aberrant behaviour can impact negatively on the IPC culture of the department. Participants identified a lack of positive role modelling and leadership which has been shown elsewhere to influence individual behaviour towards PPE [26, 47, 48] . In contrast to our findings, a recent qualitative study that utilised focus groups with nurses and assistants, reported a positive peer culture for encouraging respirator mask use [49] . This may indicate a greater perception of risk associated with diseases that required an N95/P2 respirator mask. In our study, a clinician's reduced perception of risk of infection from facial exposure was a barrier to wearing a mask. Furthermore, clinicians perceived less risk to themselves when the patient was wearing a protective mask for a potential respiratory disease and felt protected enough not to wear a mask. Public Health guidelines recommend that symptomatic persons in hospital waiting rooms and other public spaces are given a mask to wear to prevent transmission of respiratory infection [50, 51] . This measure is largely accepted by the public and has had some success in community settings [52] [53] [54] . However, research is limited on its protective effect for clinicians engaging in direct patient care. The literature also reports the problem of noncompliance with mask use by the public [55] . This risk may increase in the ED setting, where, as identified by participants in our study, patients are unwell and often non-compliant in correct mask use.",

In addition, the placement of boxes of masks was a practical barrier. Poor access to masks is also a common finding in the literature [44, 57, 58] . In our study setting the introduction of ten isolation equipment trolleys addressed some of these barriers. Applying human factors design principles is one method to address some of the contextual environmental barriers to optimal IPC behaviour such as difficult access to PPE [14, 59] .",

On the other hand, other authors have recognised that the unique complexity of an ED environment can challenge conventional IPC protocols and practices. For example, Liang states that overcrowding, multiple clinician-patient encounters, limited isolation facilities and other factors unique to an ED are barriers to good IPC practice [61] .
