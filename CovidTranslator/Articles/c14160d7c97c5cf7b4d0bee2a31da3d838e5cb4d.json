These kinds of terminologies are considered useful for standardizing terms and encoding data and are currently used in many existing information systems. However, they suffer from a number of limitations that make data reuse difficult. Relatively recently, it has been proposed that formal ontological methods can be applied to some of the problems of terminological design. Biomedical ontologies organize concepts (embodiments of knowledge about biomedical reality) whereas terminologies organize terms (what is used to code patient data at a certain point in time, based on the particular terminology version). However, the application of these methods to existing terminologies is not straightforward. The use of these terminologies is firmly entrenched in many systems, and what might seem to be a simple option of replacing these terminologies is not possible. Moreover, these terminologies evolve over time in order to suit the needs of users. Any methodology must therefore take these constraints into consideration, hence the need for formal methods of managing changes. Along these lines, we have developed a formal representation of the conceptterm relation, around which we have also developed a methodology for management of terminology changes. The objective of this study was to determine whether our methodology would result in improved retrieval of data. Design: Comparison of two methods for retrieving data encoded with terms from the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-9-CM), based on their recall when retrieving data for ICD-9-CM terms whose codes had changed but which had retained their original meaning (code change). Measurements: Recall and interclass correlation coefficient. Results: Statistically significant differences were detected (p < 0.05) with the McNemar test for two terms whose codes had changed. Furthermore, when all the cases are combined in an overall category, our method also performs statistically significantly better (p < 0.05). Conclusion: Our study shows that an ontology-based ICD-9-CM data retrieval method that takes into account the effects of terminology changes performs better on recall than one that does not in the retrieval of data for terms whose codes had changed but which retained their original meaning.",

As such, large amounts of data have been recorded using these terminologies. However, they suffer from a number of limitations that make data reuse difficult. Relatively recently, it has been proposed that formal ontological methods can be applied to some of the problems of terminological design. In the application of formal ontological methods, a crucial distinction to be made is the one between concepts (embodiments of knowledge about biomedical reality) and terms (what is used to code patient data at a certain point in time, based on the particular terminology version). Techniques from computer science have historically been used to represent terminologies in computer-based information systems. Ontological engineering is defined as ''the set of activities that concern the ontology development process, the ontology life cycle, and the methodologies, tools and languages for building ontologies'' [1] . The AI community has developed methods in the form of languages and reasoning algorithms that can be used to create terminologies that are amenable to computer-based automated reasoning. While ontological engineering has always drawn from different disciplines, more recently there has been an effort to directly incorporate philosophical notions in ontological engineering methods. Formal ontology is defined by Smith as ''the science of what is, of the kinds and structures of objects, properties, events, processes and relations in every area of reality'' [2] . As an example of the perceived contributions of formal ontology, its practitioners seek to provide formal meanings of fundamental relations, such as the subsumption (or is-a) relation and the part-of relation as well as to provide guidelines on the proper use of these relations. Furthermore, it is argued that these methods will lead to the creation of terminologies that are of higher quality than many of the currently existing ones.",

Our evaluation is focused on code change, which occurs when the code for a term changes but the term's meaning remains exactly the same. For example, in the 2005 version of ICD-9-CM, the code for ''Meconium aspiration syndrome'' is 770.1, but in the 2006 version, its code was changed to 770. 10 . Recall can be decreased when searching for ICD-9-CM-encoded data because when the code for a term changes, a retrieval method that does not properly manage the code change may miss cases that are encoded with the new code for the term.",

Applications like these rely on temporal databases, which record time-referenced data. Some of the techniques developed in temporal database research are relevant to the problem of terminology maintenance, since many of the issues in terminology maintenance are also temporal in nature. Much like ontologies, databases model a part of reality. In addition, they also collect information about specific facts in that reality, using a variety of structures collectively called database entities. In general, temporal data are associated with facts recorded in these entities. Among these aspects is the notion of valid time -a span including the past, present, or future -when the fact is true. All facts have a valid time by definition. On the other hand, the transaction time of a database fact refers to the time when the fact is current in the database [10] . The transaction time spans from insertion to deletion of the fact in the database. The notion of a valid time is particularly relevant to terminology maintenance because relationships between codes, terms, and concepts (or meanings) change over time (as terminologies are updated) and thus have a valid time, i.e. it is only during the valid time of the relationship that a code, a term, and a concept are related to each other in a particular configuration. The notion of transaction times, on the other hand, would be useful in local installations of terminologies, because information regarding when the facts regarding a particular code-term-concept configuration are added to the database can be used in ''rollbacks'' (i.e., restoring a configuration to a previous, stable state) and conflict resolution (e.g. resolving conflicts between a shared version and a local version).",

Temporal data models and temporal entity relationship modeling A significant amount of research work has gone into extending the conventional data models used in database management systems in order to support the capture of temporal data. Many relational models have been proposed [11] , and each of these models include techniques for representing valid time and transaction time. The Bitemporal Conceptual Data Model, for example, uses timestamps for tuples, corresponding to facts, with values that are sets of (transaction time, valid time) pairs [11] . The presence of a (tt, vt) pair in a timestamp of a tuple means that the current state of the database at time tt records that the fact represented by the tuple is valid at time vt. The disadvantage of this approach is that the size of the database increases very quickly as time passes. An alternative model uses a fixed-length format for tuples [12] . T s and T e record starting and ending transaction times, while V s and V e record starting and ending valid times. The database stays up-to-date without changing things at every clock ''tick''; this is made possible by the introduction of the variable now that assume the changing current time value.",

Concepts, however, are usually represented within ontologies, which are much better suited to handling the structures and semantics that are required for concepts and relations. Configuring a database of concept-term relationships to work with an ontology is possible, but it comes at the cost of maintaining separate structures, each with its own set-up and maintenance requirements.

The MED had mappings to the ICD-9-CM terminology, and every time the ICD-9-CM terminology changed, the maintainers of the MED first had to detect changes by comparing text versions of the two versions of ICD-9-CM using the UNIX diff program. Then, they had to analyze and handle the changes so that the mappings would remain valid. In earlier work, we formally described changes in terminologies that included possible reasons (both good and bad) for the changes. Corresponding to these changes were adaptive mechanisms for properly handling the changes in the MED. It was shown that while it was easy enough, with the right tools, to detect surface-level or syntactic changes in terminologies, the problem of determining the semantics of the change (i.e. how has the meaning of the term changed, if at all) was another problem altogether -one that was more difficult, and ultimately, more important. For the results of syntactic analyses were deceptively simple, and only by doing a semantic analysis would it be possible to prevent the introduction of problems such as term redundancy, term ambiguity, and undetected changes in meanings of terms. To be specific, each of these problems would potentially result in a lowering in the quality and usefulness of inferences that could be made based on encoded data. To help in the prevention of these problems, he proposed a classification of terminology changes, alongside a methodology to handle these changes according to a concept-oriented paradigm that adhered to desiderata of controlled terminologies.",

The approach was centered on a formal model of medical concepts largely similar to those used in frame-based and semantic net-based knowledge representation systems. This formal representation in turn allowed Oliver to describe detailed and formal operations to handle the types of changes that we had earlier described [13] . For evaluation, she created a small sample test set based on three existing sources of medical knowledge in one subdomain (rickettsial diseases) and demonstrated evolution of the medical terminology in two divergent directions (one local version and one shared version). Then, a proof-of-concept demonstration was performed by synchronizing the local version with the shared version using a synchronization-support tool which incorporated the CONCORDIA model and a model for change logs that could be disseminated among independent sites.",

In the system that he created, multiple authors were allowed to independently define terms, and then partially rely on the system to detect and manage conflicts in the definitions. Conflicting differences in definitions were detected using the logically-based definitions of terms, and a description-logic classifier detected conflicting definitions based on semantic equivalence rather than syntactic equivalence. Furthermore, the configuration management methods that he developed relied on ''change sets'' that contained information on changes that had been made by authors. These change sets were used to support terminology verification and automated migration [14, 15] .",

The Active field is filled with a boolean value that indicates whether a component (e.g. Concept, Relationship, Description, etc.) is valid within a particular release of SNOMED-CT effectiveTime serves as a timestamp for the log entries. Using this mechanism, it is possible to see both current values and historical values of any component at any point in time.

These modifications are introduced in order to be able to accurately map ''Not elsewhere classified''-type terms to the concepts to which they refer without requiring the introduction of artificial ''NEC'' concepts. The modification is relatively small: we introduced an inheritable attribute to the ConceptTermRelation concept, which can be filled with one of two possible Boolean values (''true'' or ''false''). When a ConceptTermRelation instance has an inheritable value of true, then the descendants of the concept to which the ConceptTermRelation instance is linked (via the hasConceptTermRelation relation) can inherit the link to that ConceptTermRelation instance. ''Not elsewhere classified''-type concepts are not directly represented as a concept in the ontology. Instead, it is through the use of the inheritable attribute in ConceptTermRelation that one is able to handle changes in meaning (semantic drift) of ''Not elsewhere classified''-type terms. In those subdomains where a ''Not elsewhere classified''-type term is used (e.g. ''Viral pneumonia due to other virus, not elsewhere classified''), some concept X that corresponds to the root term (''Viral pneumonia'' or ''Viral pneumonia, not otherwise specified'') will have at least one ConceptTermRelation instance that has the value ''true'' for its inheritable attribute and whose hasTerm attribute will be the ''Not elsewhere classified''type term (e.g. ''Viral pneumonia, not elsewhere classified''). After inspecting the start and end datetimes of the ConceptTermRelation instances of the child concepts of concept X, we can determine which of the child concepts of X will inherit a link to inheritable ConceptTermRelation instance(s) at a particular point in time. For the point of time we are interested in (e.g. '' March 5, 2006 ''), if the time period of an inheritable ''NEC'' ConceptTermRelation instance is valid (e.g. ''January 1, 2006 -''), then any concepts that do not have any ConceptTermRelation instances that are valid for that point in time will inherit the link to the inheritable Concept-TermRelation instance. Furthermore, those concepts that are children of concept X that do not have any ConceptTermRelation instances linked to them (i.e. those concepts without a corresponding term in any version of the terminology) will automatically inherit the links to the inheritable ConceptTermRelation instance. Thus, any changes to the meaning of the ''Not elsewhere classified''-type term are automatically handled because the ''inheritable'' ConceptTermRelation instance serves as a virtual pointer to those concepts that are not referred to by a term in a particular version of the terminology. For example (see Fig. 3 ), let's say a new term is added (simple addition) in the new version (January 1, 2007) of a terminology and the term's corresponding concept is a child of concept X. The addition of the new ConceptTermRelation instances (start date January 1, 2007) that are related to the child concept tells us that from January 1st 2007 onwards, the link to the inheritable ConceptTermRelation instance will not be inherited by that child concept. Therefore, no change is needed: the handling of a change in the meaning of an ''NEC''-type term is implicit in the representation mechanism. Figs. 3 and 4 show how our method might improve data retrieval when ''NEC''-type terms are involved.",

On the left we show the taxonomical hierarchy for the ''Viral pneumonia'' domain. Solid arrows stand for subsumption relations. To the right of the graph are the ConceptTermRelation instances for some of the concepts. In the 2003 version, we show two ConceptTermRelation instances for concept 1 (''Viral pneumonia'') and two ConceptTermRelation instances for concept 2 (''Pneumonia due to adenovirus''). In 2003, although it isn't a coded term in ICD-9-CM 2003, the ontology already has the concept for ''Pneumonia due to SARS-associated coronavirus''. Hence, it ''inherits'' the code ''480.8'' from its ''parent'' concept (concept 1). The 2004 version of ICD-9-CM adds the entry for ''Pneumonia due to SARS-associated coronavirus'', so we create two new instances of ConceptTermRelation for concept 5. Since concept 5 now has its own ConceptTermRelation instances, the code ''480.3'' overrides the inheritable code ''480.8'' from the parent concept. Not shown are the ConceptTermRelation instances for concepts 3 and 4. (1) When retrieving cases of SARS-associated pneumonias, a method that ignores the fact that 480.8 in 2003 will include SARS-associated pneumonias will not retrieve those cases (decreasing recall). In the example above, Cases 1, 3, and 4 will not be retrieved by methods that do not recognize that the meaning of ''480.8''(''NEC'') includes these cases encoded in 2003 when 480.8 had a broader definition. Our method incorporates these facts and so is able to retrieve these cases. (2) Invalid comparisons might be made between data encoded as 480.8 in different years. This can happen because data encoded as 480.8 in 2003 will include SARS-associated pneumonias while data encoded as 480.8 in 2004 will not. A na\u00efve assumption that 480.8 in 2003 and 2004 are comparable will not take this into account. Our method can track these differences, and the precision of comparisons across years can be improved by more precise definitions of ''NEC'' according to the terminology version.",

Possible responses included ''Yes'', ''Maybe'', ''Cannot tell'', and ''No''. A positive case was defined as a case where the diagnosis was given by the primary physician. A negative case was defined as a case where the diagnosis was not given by the primary physician. The raters' responses were dichotomized into the two categories in three different ways.

Table 1 shows the ten selected code changes that we examined in our study, with entries describing the changes between years, the terms associated with the codes that were changed, and the actual codes that were listed in ICD-9-CM. A total of 675 cases were retrieved by the screening process and presented to the judges. Table 2 shows the results of measuring the recall performance of Methods 1 and 2 on the code changes. The results show that Method 2 performed significantly better (p < 0.05) than Method 1 for two of the ICD-9-CM terms whose codes had changed (Code changes 3 and 9), regardless of how judges' responses were dichotomized in the reference standard. For a third code change (Code change 8), Method 2 performed better than Method 1 using dichotomization 3.

Furthermore, we have adopted a formal representation of terminology changes that is compatible with the widely-adopted Web Ontology Language (OWL) representation for ontologies. One advantage of an ontology-based approach is that it allows us to handle changes in the terminology in a way that propagates these changes down a class hierarchy correctly (inheritance). This in turn allows for an easier time managing changes in terminologies and incorporating them in a way that does not alter or lose the meaning of existing data. The method also takes into account problems with managing other types of terminology changes that are not solved by simply querying for the class. For example, in major name changes, the meaning of a term associated with the code changes but the code remains the same. Our method allows for the representation and handling of these kinds of changes. SNOMED-CT, as mentioned above, includes a log-style change mechanism that employs the use of the effectiveTime and active fields. These fields are used to handle changes to the ontology itself, and are used in the core ontology files (i.e. Concept, Description, Relationship, Reference Set). There is some overlap with the methods in our model that pertain to changes in the ontology (as opposed to changes in the relation between concepts and terms), but our methods also specifically deal with problems involve the relationship between terms and concepts. SNOMED-CT does include ''cross-maps'' between the SNOMED-CT ontology and external terminologies such as ICD-9 (and ICD-10 in the future), but the mappings (analogous to the ConceptTermRelation in our model) do not include equivalent attributes that would allow for the kind of change management we describe here [18, 19, 36, 37] .",

It is not hard to understand why Method 2's recall performance can be significantly better for terms whose codes have changed. Over time, human coders will become better at using the new (and correct) code for the diagnosis, even though there is bound to be some lag between the official start date of a code change in ICD-9-CM and full compliance with that change. A method that did not take into account code changes would miss more cases with the correct diagnosis, since the method would not know that cases with the new code should be retrieved. On the other hand, a method that took into account the new code would retrieve cases with the old code (prior to the date when the change is enforced) as well as cases with the new code (subsequent to the date when the change is enforced).",

Code reuse is a type of terminology change that occurs in ICD-9-CM when the name associated with a code is changed in such a way as to change its meaning (the converse of a code change). Although none of the codes were affected by code reuse, this type of change does occur in ICD-9-CM. If one of the codes had been reused during the study period, a method that did not take into account code reuse would incorrectly retrieve cases coded with that code subsequent to its change in meaning, thereby increasing the number of false positive cases and reducing precision.",

ICD-9-CM-encoded data is ubiquitous, as it is currently a part of reimbursement and reporting requirements, therefore, the results of this study are applicable to a broad range of areas such as quality assurance and clinical research.
