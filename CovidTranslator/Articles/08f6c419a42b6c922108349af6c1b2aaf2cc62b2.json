            "text": "respiratory illnesses, asthma is one of the most frequent paediatric diagnoses requiring hospital admission. 1 The burden of illness is much higher in preschool-aged children, who account for over 50% of emergency department (ED) visits [1] [2] [3] [4] and who have three times the hospital admission rate of older children and adolescents. 5 The difficulty in measuring asthma severity in young children has resulted in a dearth of comparative therapeutic evidence between preschoolers and older children. [6] [7] [8] [9] Treatment of acute asthma National and international guidelines for the management of acute asthma recommend: (1) inhaled \u03b2 2 -agonists for all patients; (2) systemic (usually oral) corticosteroids for those with moderate and severe asthma; and (3) repeated doses of inhaled \u03b2 2 -agonists and anticholinergics for severe cases. 6 7 9 10 The latter two recommendations independently reduce admission rates by 25% in studies of predominantly school-aged children. 11 12 Several features must be noted. First, recommendations are severityspecific; patients with mild asthma do not appear to benefit from oral corticosteroids. 11 13 Second, the concept of the 'golden first hour of treatment' supports early and aggressive asthma management, as the risk of admission is reduced only when oral corticosteroids are administered 3-4 h prior to the decision to admit. Third, of all treatments administered in the ED, oral corticosteroids are by far the most effective for preventing admission. 14 Fourth, there is no equally effective substitute for oral corticosteroids; promising contenders such as high-dose inhaled steroids, 15 16 intravenous antileukotrienes 17 or magnesium sulfate 18 have been shown to be inferior to oral corticosteroids and are used as an add-on therapy. Fifth, systemic corticosteroids are inexpensive generic drugs. Short treatment with oral corticosteroids is generally devoid of significant side effects, 19 though rare cases of fatal or disseminated varicella have been reported. 20 Sixth, while recommendations are relatively similar in young children, older children and adults, the evidence for the former is weaker due to the under-representation of preschool-aged children in relevant trials. 11 12 While oral corticosteroids are the cornerstone of management of acute, moderate or severe asthma, 6 several reports have recently shaken the belief that they are equally effective for all patients with asthma, showing that children with viral-induced wheezing 21 and smoking adults 22 are corticosteroid-resistant. Indeed, in a large placebo-controlled randomised controlled trial of 700 children aged 10-60 months with mild-to-moderate viral-induced wheezing, oral corticosteroid was not superior to placebo for reducing the length of stay in hospital or improving the Pediatric Respiratory Assessment Measure (PRAM) clinical score, despite adequate study power. 21 Critics have suggested that: (1) in most children, the disease may not have been asthma (documented in only 16% of patients) but rather the North American definition of bronchiolitis; (2) some patients (with mild asthma) may not have needed corticosteroids 23 ; (3) the prolonged stay in hospital did not seem to be supported by severity 24 and (4) the dose of 1 (instead of 2) mg/kg may have been insufficient. Yet, this study elicited major discomfort regarding acute asthma management in young children. 24 In another adequately powered landmark trial, a 2-week treatment with prednisone showed a marked blunting of response in adult smokers, with an improvement in forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV 1 ) of 237 mL (95% CI 43 to 431) in never-smokers compared to no change or 47 (\u2212148 to 243) mL in current smokers. 22 The question remains as to whether smoking adolescents and children with environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) respond as well as those not exposed. None of these aforementioned findings have been replicated, thus prompting us to review the potential determinants of responsiveness.",

[25] [26] [27] It is thus critical to distinguish asthma from bronchiolitis in young children. 28 Bronchiolitis is clinically defined in North America as the first wheezing illness in a child \u226412 months, with respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) as the most frequent pathogen. Asthma, defined as airway obstruction (cough, dyspnoea and wheezing) with hyper-reactivity and reversibility with bronchodilator or corticosteroids, begins early in life. 29 30 While children and adults meeting these criteria can be diagnosed at the first episode, generally three wheezing episodes are required for children \u226412 months to reduce the risk of misclassification with bronchiolitis. 8 31 Heterogeneous groups of children with bronchiolitis and asthma may explain the poor response to oral corticosteroids in studies including infants and toddlers. 21 24 Thus, an operational definition of asthma, clinically applicable to children aged 1-17 years, is needed to reasonably exclude bronchiolitis.",

[35] [36] [37] [38] The incidence of viral-induced asthma peaks in September continues throughout the fall and winter. 32 In adults with acute asthma, viral infection is associated with longer hospital admission 39 and increased sputum neutrophils, suggesting a predominantly neutrophilic airway inflammation. 39 In a study of children aged 3-36 months, those infected with rhinovirus showed fewer relapses when treated with oral prednisone compared to placebo, suggesting that rhinovirus did not impair responsiveness to steroids. 40 In another placebo-controlled trial of 283 young children with wheezing, prednisolone did not significantly decrease the overall time to discharge; however, it reduced by half the length of stay in children infected with picornavirus and by fourfold that of children with enterovirus, suggesting that response may be organism dependent. 41 Clearly, oral corticosteroids may not be as effective in patients with viral infections as in those without, perhaps due to neutrophilic airway inflammation, a condition associated with poor response to corticosteroids.

Heavier ETS exposure in preschoolers who spend more time at home than school-aged children 46 47 may explain a poorer response in young children. Objective documentation of smoking would also be important if possible, even before high school where many already smoke. 48 Of particular concern is whether a blunted response to oral corticosteroids would be found in children exposed to tobacco smoke and adolescents with a short history of active smoking. With 25% of asthmatic children exposed to ETS and 25% of teenagers actively smoking, [49] [50] [51] such an assessment appears critical. Several reports highlight the need for objective measurement of nicotine exposure, because of parental underreporting of their child's exposure to ETS. 46 52 Cotinine, a nicotine metabolite with a half-life of 20 h, is a widely accepted indicator of recent tobacco use and exposure. 53 Serum cotinine requires blood sampling, a major deterrent for study participation in paediatrics. 47 53 Good correlations exist between serum and either salivary (r=0.71) or urine (r=0.69) cotinine measures. 53 With a 1:10 ratio of cotinine level between saliva and urine, 54 passive exposure may lead to saliva levels of 5-10 ng/mL 55 56 and urine levels of 10-100 ng/mL. 45 However, as urine sampling in young children may not occur for several hours and is more complex to obtain in children not yet toilet-trained, saliva cotinine measured by the quantitative enzyme immunoassay kit is a well-validated, non-invasive solution that offers required precision with minimal volume and a detectable level of 0.05 ng/mL. 56 57 Other determinants A number of other factors could possibly modulate the responsiveness to oral corticosteroids including, among others, gender, 1 race, 58 59 perceived asthma phenotype (derived from age, common asthma triggers and interim symptoms), 31 60 61 inhaled corticosteroids, 2 73 62 allergens, the alleged trigger, 63 and other environmental triggers, all of which can be documented clinically by questionnaire.",

In the first group, we selected eight polymorphisms in seven genes that can be divided into those coding for xenobiotic metabolising enzymes and those coding for mediators of inflammation and immunity, specifically the ones demonstrated to affect lung function, disease severity and interaction with exposure to ETS. 67 68 We selected polymorphisms affecting gene function, top-ranking single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in a number of associated studies. Transforming growth factor \u03b2 1 polymorphisms were found to correlate with disease severity 69 ; CC16 polymorphisms play a role in the development and persistence of the asthma phenotype in childhood 70 ; CD14 polymorphisms have been linked to pathogenesis of asthma and lung function in smokers. 71 The ORMDL3 gene confers susceptibility to early-onset asthma, particularly through interaction with early life exposure to ETS 67 72 ; GSTM1 and GSTP1 are involved in the metabolism of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon derivatives and reactive oxygen species 73 74 ; GSTM1 null and GSTP1 genotypes have been associated with an increased risk of asthma 75 and rapid decline of lung function among smokers. 76 The ADRB2 receptor gene was found to contribute to the occurrence of wheeze among children who were exposed to tobacco smoke in utero and in early childhood 77 and was related to \u03b2 2 -agonist response. 68 78 Among genes affecting the corticosteroid and inflammatory pathways, we selected genes (CHRH1, TBX21, FCER2, GLCC1, STIP1 and SERPINE1) that were shown to correlate with response to corticosteroids in patients with asthma; the finding for some of them was replicated in several cohorts.

Sputum eosinophils and ECP increase with exposure to allergens and decrease with corticosteroid treatment. 86 A higher proportion of neutrophils is associated with smoking 22 44 87 and with viral infection. 39 88 The non-eosinophilic inflammatory phenotype in adults has been associated with poor response to corticosteroids. 89 90 Markers of this phenotype include an increased proportion of neutrophils, IL-8 and myeloperoxidase, all of which are easily quantifiable. 91 92 Contrary to adult findings and criteria, three distinct inflammatory cell patterns have been reported during paediatric exacerbations: non-eosinophilic (<2.5% eosinophils) in 22%, eosinophilic (\u22652.5% eosinophils) in 43% and combined eosinophilic/neutrophilic (\u22652.5% eosinophils and >54% neutrophils) in 35%, with paucigranular inflammation not described in acute paediatric asthma. 62 Combined eosinophilic/neutrophilic exacerbations show more mast cells and higher sputum ECP levels than eosinophilic exacerbations. There is increasing evidence that eosinophilic asthma is more responsive to corticosteroids than non-eosinophilic asthma; a promising mechanistic pathway to explore. 93 94 Expired nitric oxide (eNO) is increasingly recognised as a non-invasive marker of airway inflammation, particularly in atopic asthma, 95 96 and correlates strongly with the percentage of airway eosinophils (r=0.78) and ECP (r=0.53) in children with asthma. 97 Although the understanding about the link between NO and airway inflammation remains incomplete, airway epithelial cells activated by inflammatory cytokines produce an increased amount of eNO due to the expression of inducible NO synthase. 98 eNO is elevated in untreated asthma 99 and improves with asthma therapy. 100 101 Of interest, eNO correlates with other markers of eosinophilic inflammation, including sputum eosinophils. 102 103 Thus, eNO appears to reflect the magnitude of eosinophilic airway inflammatory and may serve as a promising biomarker of eosinophilic inflammation in children too young or unable to cooperate with induced sputum sampling. 104 As it can be measured in preschool-aged using an offline technique 105 106 and in older children using commercially available instruments, 107 108 it could serve as a biomarker of subsequent response to corticosteroids if indeed the type of airway inflammation modulates response.",

Moreover, incorporating return visits resulting in admission provides an additional measure of failure of ED treatment by adding a measure of the decision appropriateness. Time to meet severity criteria for discharge (PRAM <4) and length of active treatment are two additional measures of interest that are less influenced by factors other than severity.",

            "text": "Accurate and objective assessment of the severity of airway obstruction is clearly the biggest challenge in acute paediatric asthma research. Standard lung function tests, such as spirometry, require a forced expiratory manoeuvre that is extremely difficult and unreliable for preschool-aged children because of poor coordination; it is not obtainable in 35-50% of acutely ill school-aged children because of illness severity and/or poor familiarity with technique. [110] [111] [112] About three quarters of asthmatic children cannot perform standard lung function tests in the ED setting. 113 In contrast, respiratory resistance (Rrs) by forced oscillation is an effort-independent measure that can be obtained in untrained, acutely ill children aged \u22653 years 110 We and others have demonstrated the reproducibility and sensitivity to change Rrs 114 and established reference values for Canadian children. 115 116 Thus, the measure of Rrs can serve as a precise and reliable index of severity and response in acutely ill children, although still missing very young or uncooperative preschoolers and as such cannot serve as the main outcome. Clinical scores appear to be a reasonable alternative to lung function testing as they can be used in children of all ages. Although many clinical scores have been designed, only two have been validated for use in both preschool-aged and school-aged children. 112 117 The PRAM is the only score developed and validated against a concurrent measure of lung function in children aged 3-6 years, 117 and subsequently validated in children aged 1-17 years. 23 It is a discriminative and responsive tool, with a change in scores \u22653 indicating clinical importance. 23 117 The inter-rater reliability is consistently above 70%. 23 The 12-point PRAM, rating five weighted items (oxygen saturation, suprasternal retractions, scalene muscle contraction, air entry and wheezing), has been used in landmark clinical trials. 21 It can be used to assess severity at baseline (mild: PRAM 0-3; moderate: PRAM 4-7; severe: PRAM 8-12), improvement with treatment depicted as the area under the curve, need for admission (PRAM \u22654, 4 h after the oral corticosteroids) and time until ready for discharge (delay until PRAM <4). 23 Indicators of recovery following discharge Among children discharged home, the time to complete recovery will vary widely between individuals. Although symptom scores are frequently used in clinical trials, only four have been specifically developed for use in children. 69 70 71 The Asthma flare-up diary for young children (formerly the Pediatric Asthma Diary) is the only one validated to detect day-to-day change in the functional status of preschool-aged children following an acute care visit 118 ; it is highly sensitive to detect group differences in intensity and duration of symptoms in randomised controlled trials; however, its performance in school-aged children has not been explored. 119 Another diary has been validated for detecting change in school-aged children but not in the context of acutely ill children. 120 Use of \u03b2 2 -agonists is an additional marker for the duration and intensity of symptoms, as greater use of rescue relievers is expected to occur in children with more symptoms. 119 Finally, the impact of the disease on the quality of life of the patient or the caregivers is a recognised, sensitive and unique marker of the burden of disease on the patient or family. 121 Several well-validated asthma-specific quality of life instruments are available for adults 122 and school-aged children with stable asthma. 123 To our knowledge, only one instrument, entitled 'Effects of a child's asthma flare-up on parents', is available for measuring the burden of disease on parents of preschool-aged children following an asthma exacerbation; we have developed the instrument using Kirshner and Guyatt's 124 approach for developing health instruments, validated it in a randomised controlled trial 119 and received two copyrights (French version: #1019528 English version: #1019529 (manuscript in preparation).",

As some inclusion and exclusion criteria may become evident during or after the ED stay (ie, pneumonia), a central adjudicating committee comprising a paediatrician/ED physician and respirologist will review the eligibility criteria of children who, after enrolment, appear to be ineligible due to the failure to meet one or more inclusion or exclusion criteria and who did not receive or tolerate oral corticosteroids as recommended in the protocol. The main trigger for identifying these children will be the ED physician's low degree of confidence that this child had asthma, suspicion that he/she may have bronchiolitis and the suspicion that he/she did not retain the oral corticosteroids. In this case, the relevant case report forms, relevant anonymised laboratory testing (ie, imaging, microbiology, virology and haematology) and relevant anonymised medical chart sections will be reviewed by the adjudicating committee. The adjudicating committee will be central, although we are not ruling out the possibility of creating local committees at each site, depending on the volume of cases to review. In such a case, the site would be added as a covariate in the analysis. Disagreement will be resolved by consensus or the assistance of a third observer. The proportion of excluded children, assumed to be around 10%, will be monitored and reported.",

Pilot data were extracted from two large recent chart audits 14 138 totalling 1628 children presenting with acute asthma to the ED (in which age, gender, baseline PRAM, timing of oral corticosteroid intake and admission were documented) and two recently completed trials 119 139 totalling 518 children, in whom tobacco exposure was also ascertained by questionnaire; we then focused only on children meeting our current eligibility criteria (age, baseline PRAM and corticosteroids within an hour of arrival). Based on the literature, we assumed the prevalence of viral pathogen varied between 60% and 80%. 140 141 The baseline risk of admission was 41%; after recruitment of the initial 320 patients, the observed overall risk of admission was substantially lower at 16%, which substantially reduced the effective sample size from 1200 to 800. First, using the Wald test (based on the prevalence of factors and the risk of admission in unexposed children), we calculated the sample size required to detect an RD of admission of 7.5%, taking each determinant in turn as the independent variable in a bivariate logistic regression; we used 95% CIs for each estimate obtained from pilot data to examine the impact on power. 142 Then, using the method proposed by Hsieh et al, 143 we calculated the inflation factor to adjust the total sample size, based on the observed correlation between key determinants (age, gender and tobacco exposure, and baseline severity). As the observed correlation between determinants and severity and any pair of determinants was negligible (\u03b2 coefficients <0.03), there was no need to inflate the sample size. At an \u03b1 of 0.05, a sample of 800 children had 80% power to detect an RD of admission of \u22657.5% for all key determinants. We targeted the RD of 7.5%, because it was considered in a survey of researchers of the Pediatric Emergency Research in Canada (PERC) network as a clinically meaningful effect size that would support a practice change. After documenting a 1% loss after enrolment (from 10% originally estimated) and 20% missing key samples (viral or cotinine), our target recruitment sample is 1008 to obtain an effective sample of 800 children. Acknowledging that the majority of selected polymorphisms have a minor allele frequency of at least 30% and using an \u03b1 of 0.005 (with a Bonferroni correction for 14 polymorphisms), 1008 children will provide 80% power to detect an OR of 1.5 between each polymorphism and admission. Finally, of the expected 400 children recruited at the University Health Centre Sainte-Justine, we estimated that 200 children would cooperate with eNO measurements and 60 with induced sputum. These sample sizes should be adequate to detect a correlation coefficient as low as 0.2-0.35, respectively, with the area under the curve of the PRAM score during the ED with 80% power and a two-sided 0.05 \u03b1.",

Given the high prevalence of suspected factors (young age (60%), viral infection (60-80%), ETS (20-30%)), the potential impact of poor response on the rate of failure of ED management is sizeable. The exploration of potential hostenvironment interactions will broaden our understanding of corticosteroid responsiveness in children and enable us to focus on relevant alternative/supplemental strategies to adequately manage these patients. Documentation of the similar effectiveness of systemic corticosteroids across determinants will provide the needed reassurance as to the value of national recommendations for the treatment of all children with acute asthma.",
