The task of protecting patients and dental workers during the past decade has prompted dramatic change in what is required of dental practice. In addition to the Bloodborne Pathogens Standard of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, infection control guidelines published by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to protect patients have been mandated in all states, according to federal law. [2] [3] [4] In recent years, instrument cleaning, disinfection and sterilization have received detailed attention and definition. [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] Patients can be protected from cross-infections only if each patient's oral tissues are not handled alternately with operatory equipment and surfaces contaminated with saliva and blood during the care of previous patients. 5 Preventing cross-contamination requires identification of the sources of contamination, as well as the careful implementation of well-designed barriers and aseptic techniques.",

In a busy practice, time allowed between patients for thorough cleaning and disinfecting is often inadequate. These factors make rendering operatory equipment and surfaces free of contamination a difficult challenge. These observations have contributed to the development of guidelines for operatory asepsis. 6, 13, 26, 27, [29] [30] [31] [32] [33] [34] [35] [36] We found nothing in the literature that provided detailed documentation and evaluation of a method of assessing contamination of contact surfaces in the dental operatory, how much contamination is encountered in private operatories or an evaluation of efforts made by private office personnel in preparing operatories for safe reuse. Thus, we designed this study to establish a basis for evaluating infection control procedures and equipment, and to propose an initial standard for assessing oral contamination of operatory surfaces.",

Each tube was vortexed for 1.0 minute to release the bacteria from the cotton swabs. The spread plates were prepared by placing 0.2 mL of the sample in 100-millimeter petri dishes containing Columbia colistin naladixic acid, or CNA, sheep blood agar, an enriched medium selective for gram-positive organisms. The sample was spread evenly over the agar surface with a sterile glass spreader. The plates were incubated in candle jars at 37 C for 48 hours. After incubation, AHS colonies were counted. Isolates were identified according to the framework described by Facklam 40 and Facklam and Carey. 44 Three recovery media were used: trypticase soy broth, or TSB; letheen broth; and Dey/Engley, or D/E, neutralizing broth. After disinfectants dry on a surface, the residual disinfectant can be reactivated when moistened by the recovery media from the cotton swab. Letheen broth and D/E neutralizing broth contain ingredients that neutralize disinfectants. However, it is known that these neutralizing ingredients also can have bacteriostatic effects on, and some degree of toxicity for, the recovered bacteria. 45 Before the sampling in the private offices and in the general environment, we performed tests to determine which of the recovery media was most sensitive for recovery of AHS. Letheen broth effectively neutralized residual phenolic disinfectants and was less toxic to the recovered AHS than was the D/E neutralizing broth. D/E broth was approximately six times less sensitive than letheen broth. 10 Iodophors, chlorine and hypochlorites are sufficiently neutralized by the organic material in letheen broth, or other nutrient media, such as TSB. 45 TSB was even more sensitive than letheen broth when there were no residual disinfectants recovered in the sample. We chose TSB for sampling surfaces where disinfectants were not used, or where use was limited, because it is not toxic to the bacteria.",

Although the AHS were detected in samples from nondental environments, they were present in low numbers. One or two \u03b1-hemolytic colonies were observed on spread plates of four of the samples taken in the barber shop. None of the other spread plates for the nondental samples grew AHS colonies, although one sample from the ophthalmology clinic grew the indicator organisms in the recovery medium. The Fisher exact test was used to compare the afternoon sampling results in the private dental offices with the sampling results in the nondental areas (16 percent, five of 32), since the samples in the nondental areas were also taken in the afternoon. This difference was significant (P = .00129). The difference is attributed to the activity of saliva-contaminated hands' touching surfaces in a dental operatory despite the efforts of dental personnel to clean and disinfect those surfaces. Although this activity does not take place in barber shops or medical clinics, AHS were detectable there nevertheless. AHS also are dispersed into the environment through sneezing, coughing and talking. Detection of low numbers of AHS in the general environment is acceptable; however, a higher standard should be applied to an environment in which instruments and fingers of clinic personnel touch or penetrate the mucous membranes of patients. 6 Survival on dental operatory surfaces. AHS survived on environmental surfaces for several days. 10 However, relative humidity has a pronounced ef-fect on the survival of AHS in saliva dried on surfaces. There is accelerated die-off at high relative humidities, or RH. At 75 percent RH, the die, or D, value-the time for 90 percent to die, or one logarithm reduction-was demonstrated to be only two hours, whereas at lower RH of 53 percent and 33 percent, the D value was 12 hours and 60 hours, respectively. 10 We used the Fisher exact test to compare the private dental office sampling results from the morning (31 percent [35 of 113] of the samples were positive for AHS) with those from the afternoon (45 percent [60 of 132] positive for AHS). The difference was significant (P = .014). This difference is attributed to the die-off of the indicator organisms during the approximately 15 hours after the last patients were seen the day before.

This can be achieved in several ways. Foot controls rather than chair buttons should be used to adjust seats and to operate water faucets for handwashing.
