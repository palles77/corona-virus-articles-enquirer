We localized transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) spike (S) protein in DRMs in the viral envelope. Though S protein was not solubilized by cold non-ionic detergents, this behavior was unchanged when cholesterol was depleted from viral membrane by methyl-\u2424-cyclodextrin (M\u2424CD) and the protein did not comigrate with cellular DRM marker proteins in flotation analyses. Therefore, the S protein is not anchored in the viral membrane DRMs as they are known to occur in the plasma membrane. Cholesterol depletion from viral membrane may not affect the adsorption process as neither the sialic acid binding activity nor the binding to aminopeptidase N was reduced post-M\u2424CD treatment. Reduced infectivity of cholesterol-depleted TGEV was observed only when the adsorption process occurred at 37 \u2022 C but not when the virus was applied at 4 \u2022 C. Cholesterol is important for a post-adsorption step, allowing membrane rearrangements that facilitate virus entry.",

Accumulating evidence suggests the involvement of DRMs in virus life cycles (Simons and Ehehalt, 2002) . Cholesterol, a major constituent of DRMs is important in the entry of nonenveloped viruses such as simian virus 40 (SV40), rotavirus, enterovirus and rhinovirus (Suzuki and Suzuki, 2006) . The binding of enveloped viruses to specific cellular receptors and fusion of the viral membrane with a cellular membrane are indispensable for virus entry. Correspondingly, the initiation of virus infection may require cholesterol in either of the two membranes involved or in both. Previous data show that the infectivity of influenza virus and canine distemper virus is sensitive to cholesterol depletion from the viral membrane (Imhoff et al., 2007; Sun and Whittaker, 2003) . In contrast, murine leukemia virus, Ebola virus, and Marburg virus are sensitive to cholesterol depletion from the cellular membrane (Bavari et al., 2002; Lu et al., 2002) . Cholesterol in both membranes is required for the infection by human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and herpes simplex virus (Smith and Helenius, 2004; Nayak and Hui, 2004 As far as coronaviruses are concerned, the depletion of cellular cholesterol by the drug methyl-\u2424-cyclodextrin (M\u2424CD), a cholesterol depletion reagent, inhibits virus entry of several coronaviruses: mouse hepatitis virus (Thorp and Gallagher, 2004; Choi et al., 2005) , severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-coronavirus (Li et al., 2007; Glende et al., 2008) , human coronavirus 229E (Nomura et al., 2004) and avian infectious bronchitis virus (Imhoff et al., 2007) . More recently, we showed the importance of cholesterol in both the cellular and viral membranes for TGEV infection (Ren et al., 2008) . This finding raises the question whether there are DRMs in the viral envelope.",

            "text": "An increased content of cholesterol is a characteristic feature of DRMs derived from the plasma membrane. As cholesterol depletion from TGE virions results in a reduction of viral infectivity (Ren et al., 2008) , we were interested to find out whether the surface protein S that mediates virus entry is localized in DRMs. For this purpose, we analyzed whether the TGEV S protein is resistant to solubilization by Triton X-100 at 4 \u2022 C. As shown in Fig. 1A , the S protein was found in the pellet, i.e. it was associated with the Triton X-100-insoluble fraction. For comparison, we used vesicular stomatitis virus that is not affected in its infectivity when cholesterol is depleted from the viral membrane. The surface protein G of this virus was only detected in the soluble fraction. The same result was obtained when two other non-ionic detergents were used, Tween 20 or Brij96 (data not shown). This solubilization behavior would be compatible with the presence of the S protein in detergent-resistant microdomains. To further characterize the membrane association of the S protein, TGEV particles were treated with M\u2424CD to deplete cholesterol from the viral membrane. M\u2424CD is commonly used to destroy the integrity of DRMs. Application of this drug at a concentration of 10 mM reduced approximately 33% infectivity of TGEV (P < 0.01), compared with the infectivity of nontreated viruses (Fig. 1B) . To analyze the association of cholesterol with the infectivity of TGEV, a cholesterol replenishment assay was performed. As shown in Fig. 1C , the infectivity of TGEV restored to 80% of the value determined prior to cholesterol depletion, after addition of 200 M exogenous cholesterol to M\u2424CD-treated TGEV (Fig. 1C) . The data indicate that the viral infectivity is significantly reduced by M\u2424CD and can be restored by cholesterol. However, the S protein was still only detected in the detergent-insoluble fraction (Fig. 1A) . This result indicates that the surface protein of TGEV is arranged in the viral envelope in a detergent-resistant way that is not affected by cholesterol depletion.",

Cholesterol, a characteristic structural component of lipid rafts, is thought to function as a dynamic glue that keeps the raft assembly together (Simons and Toomre, 2000) . As far as virus entry is concerned most of the information available is related to the role of DRMs in the plasma membrane of the target cell where they may act as platforms for concentration of virus receptors and/or for an efficient penetration process. However, the exact mechanism how membrane microdomains contribute to virus entry is not known. This is also true for coronaviruses which are reduced in their infectivity when the integrity of DRMs is abolished by cholesterol depletion of the target cell membrane (Bavari et al., 2002; Li et al., 2007; Ren et al., 2008; Thorp and Gallagher, 2004) . Despite this similarity, coronaviruses differ with respect to the location of the cellular receptor. Aminopeptidase N, the cellular receptor of human coronavirus 229E, TGEV and some other members of this virus family is constitutively present in DRMs. By contrast, the receptor for mouse hepatitis virus, CEACAM, is usually detected in the detergent-soluble fraction but may be recruited to the DRM fraction during the entry process (Choi et al., 2005; Thorp and Gallagher, 2004) .",

As these viruses belong to quite diverse families, the importance of cholesterol in the viral membrane may be a more general feature of many enveloped viruses. The importance of cholesterol in the viral membrane may suggest that DRMs are present in the viral envelope and may be important for the function of the viral membrane proteins. The evidence, however, is circumstantial as DRM association of viral proteins has been analyzed only in infected cells. It has not been demonstrated that the association of viral protein with membrane microdomains is maintained in the viral envelope. It gets even more complicated with viruses like herpesviruses, coronaviruses or hepatitis virus B which mature at intracellular membranes. The concentration of cholesterol and sphingolipids is increasing in the membranes along the secretory pathway, i.e. from the ER to the plasma membrane.

DRMs are typically recovered as low-density material in equilibrium flotation gradients and measuring DRM association provides valuable information regarding the preference for rafts by proteins or lipids of interest (Ono et al., 2005) . Sedimentation analysis indicated that the TGEV S protein cannot be solubilized by cold non-ionic detergents. Though this behavior is compatible with the location of a protein in DRMs, other pieces of evidence do not support this conclusion. Cholesterol depletion did not render the S protein soluble by cold non-ionic detergent and in the flotation analysis it was not transferred to fractions where DRM proteins are expected. Therefore, factors other than cholesterol-rich detergent membranes are responsible for the insolubility in cold non-ionic detergents. Interaction with other viral proteins such as the M and/or the E protein may contribute to this behavior. In this respect, it is interesting to note that the VSV G protein behaves different from the TGEV S protein. The former protein may interact with other proteins in the viral envelope not as tightly making it easier to solubilize G by detergent treatment.",

            "text": "Though the effect of cholesterol depletion on virus infectivity cannot be explained by the lipid raft concept, it is evident that cholesterol is important for virus entry. Our analysis did not provide any evidence that the two binding activities of the S protein, binding to sialic acids on sialoglycoconjugates and binding to aminopeptidase N, are reduced in cholesterol-depleted virions. Therefore, a post-adsorption step appears to require cholesterol for optimal infectivity. Stages in the infection cycle following the binding to cellular receptors have also been implicated in the importance of cholesterol for other viruses (Funk et al., 2008; Hambleton et al., 2007) . To understand the role of cholesterol, one should keep in mind that cholesterol depletion results in a reduction but not in the abolishment of virus infectivity. Virus entry may occur also at lower cholesterol levels but increased cholesterol makes this process more efficient. In this context it is interesting that cholesterol depletion reduced infectivity only when virus binding occurred at elevated temperatures. When the adsorption step was performed at 4 \u2022 C, the infectivity was somewhat lower but unaffected by cholesterol depletion. Interestingly Choi and coworkers reported a similar finding when they analyzed the infection by mouse hepatitis virus with cholesterol-depleted cells (Choi et al., 2005) . Based on these findings we conclude that virus entry can be optimized when binding of virions to the cell surface can be combined with membrane rearrangements that are possible at 37 \u2022 C but not at 4 \u2022 C. Future work has to address the question whether cholesterol facilitates coronavirus entry by affecting the membrane fluidity or whether other molecular interactions depend on an increased content of cholesterol. 005) and a visiting scholarship from Deutscher Akademischer Austauschdienst (DAAD) to X.R. are acknowledged.
