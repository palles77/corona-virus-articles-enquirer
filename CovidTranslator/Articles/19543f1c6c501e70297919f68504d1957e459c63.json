The tube is then incubated at 94\u00b0C for 15 minutes and placed on ice. The first strand cDNA synthesis was conducted by mixing 10 \u00b5l of primed mRNA with 0.5 \u00b5l of Murine RNase Inhibitor, 1 \u00b5l of ProtoScript II Reverse Transcriptase, 8.5 \u00b5l of nuclease-free water. Tube was then incubated in a preheated thermal cycler with the following cycler condition: 25 \u02daC for 10 minutes, 42 \u02daC for 50 minutes, 70 \u02daC for 15 minutes, and hold at 4 \u02daC. Second strand cDNA synthesis was conducted immediately after this step by mixing 20 \u00b5l of first strand synthesis reaction with 8 \u03bcl of Second Strand Synthesis Reaction Buffer (10X), 4 \u03bcl of Second Strand Synthesis Enzyme Mix, and 48 \u03bcl of nuclease-free water. The tube was thoroughly mixed by gentle pipetting and incubated in a thermal cycler at 16 \u02daC for 1 hour, with heated lid set at 40 \u02daC.",
