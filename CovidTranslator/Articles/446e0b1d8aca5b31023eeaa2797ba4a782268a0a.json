This drug is used for the treatment of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection by increasing CD4 lymphocytes [2] . These cells are measured in the blood as CD4 and CD8 counts [3] . The CD4 count is a reflection of immune system efficiency: the lower the CD4 count, the weaker the immune system will be. If the CD4 count is <200 in a microliter of blood, the person is considered to be infected and is involved with AIDS [4] . In fact, patients with a CD4 count of <400 showed a significant increase in their CD4 counts following treatment with IMOD\u00e4 for 3 months in comparison to those in a control group who were not treated with IMOD\u00e4 [5] . Therefore, this viral infection disease can be treated with an increasing number of CD4 lymphocytes in the blood [6] . In addition, the presence of selenium as an immune booster and the presence of flavonoids such as chlorogenic acid, caffeic acid, kaempferol, esculetin, apigenin, luteolin, rutin, ferulic acid, etc., which have antioxidant effects, help to remove free radicals and improve the immune system as well.",

Additionally, the agent inhibits acute and chronic hepatitis C virus infection [8, 9] . Furthermore, Arbidol has antioxidant properties and is in the category of the least toxic drugs (LD50 > 4 g/kg) which does not have adverse effects on the human body when taken orally at the recommended dosages [9] .",

In addition, it was shown in different studies that IMOD\u00e4 can increase interferon release from host cells significantly [2] . One such interferon is interferon gamma (IFN-c) which is crucial for innate and adaptive immunity. This is also the case with Arbidol, which shows interferonogenic activity as well [8] . Therefore, this provides strong evidence to indicate that IMOD\u00e4 can increase the efficacy of Arbidol further in the treatment of patients. Consequently, this new idea will produce a novel medicine that increases CD4 cell numbers, boosts the immune system further, and thus will be a better choice to prevent and cure viral infectious diseases.",

The same result was achieved in another similar clinical trial on 66 patients [11] . Therefore, Arbidol is effective and safe for patients with the above-cited influenza types including acute viral upper respiratory infection (URI). The properties of IMOD\u00e4, concerning its safety and efficacy, have been the subject of several studies [2, 3] and review articles [12, 13] in animals and humans. In addition, it is a bonus to indicate the positive function of IMOD\u00e4 through its antioxidant activity in aged mice [14] . In this study, it was concluded that IMOD\u00e4 prevents superoxide anion and free radicals through its total antioxidant power. All these aforementioned effects from IMOD\u00e4 can be used in the treatment of immunologic disorders. The same results in the safety and efficacy are expected for the novel medicine; however, it is anticipated to have a stronger action. At present, the mixture of IMOD\u00e4 and Arbidol at a laboratory scale has been formulated in a single 500-mg capsule and a pilot scale is in progress. In this formulation, 120 mg of IMOD\u00e4, as an active herbal mixed dried extract, and 100 mg of Arbidol raw material were combined with suitable common excipients (15 mg talc, 85 mg starch, and 180 mg lactose). The toxicology studies of this novel medicine was carried out by the investigators in mice and showed practically zero toxicity for doses ranging from 2 to up to 4 g/kg (unpublished data). Based on Arbidol itself, a course of 12 capsules twice a day should be prescribed. Accordingly, the dosage in this study would be two capsules a day, 6 days per week.",

            "text": "In this context, we proposed a novel idea to prevent and treat viral infections such as influenza diseases. As discussed above, IMOD\u00e4 has been used successfully within the last few years, resulting in increased CD4 lymphocyte counts and consequent improvement of the immune system. Similarly, Arbidol also by itself has proven within the last two decades to be a safe and effective drug for the prevention and treatment of flu and influenza. Therefore, with the advantage of both medicines, a stronger choice to prevent and cure not only flu but also some other infectious diseases such as acute hepatitis B and C can also be targeted. In a large sample of gatherings such as the Hajj pilgrimage where millions of Muslims are in close contact while performing their religious obligations, the viruses can be transferred with ease by sneezing and coughing. Testing the idea in several groups of attendees could prove the safety and the efficacy of the above combination in a clinical trial. Such results will be published and the whole society can benefit, especially during the flu seasons of the year. This strategy will also help to stop the spreading of such viruses to other countries. Moreover, the mass production of such a beneficial medicine in different forms such as capsules, tablets, and probably ampoules are proposed if biological tests prove promising.",

Consequently, in this combination, the weakness of the agents will be improved by advantages of both medicines as discussed. Eventually, CD4 cell numbers will increase further to obtain a better choice to prevent and cure viral infectious diseases. This could be achieved by the addition of interferon-inducing activity, broad-spectrum antiviral efficiency, antioxidant activity, and inhibition of the fusion of influenza viruses interacting with cell membranes. Today, because of severe deadly ''Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus'' (MERS-CoV) that has caused many life-threatening infections in Saudi Arabia and can cause a global epidemic, the importance of this hypothesis becomes much clearer.",
