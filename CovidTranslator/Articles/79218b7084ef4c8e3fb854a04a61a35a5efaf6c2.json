HP is therefore a wide and complex domain: systems in this domain are large, to mean that size and scope of such systems are conspicuous and that system boundaries may not be easy to identify; systems are integrated, to mean that it is generally not sufficient to study each subsystem in isolation; systems are different in purpose and require a multidisciplinary approach for their design and analysis.",

The field of information fusion is commonly characterized as multidisciplinary research area and includes and/or overlaps with a number of other areas. The information fusion at sensor level includes signal processing; at data level data processing; at meta-data level it overlaps with knowledge representation and, finally, at the decision level it involves the decision making capability.

In recent years the decreasing sensor cost and the development of telecommunication technology have made possible the deployment of networks with a huge number of sensors; in this case the use of information fusion centers is unpractical. Consequently a new class of sensor networks, whose way of functioning is called network centric, has emerged. These networks do not have a fusion center and their functioning is based on the information exchange between near-by sensors. Under this approach the information can be considered as a property of the network rather than of the own sensor. This solution is strongly advocated for its robustness and ease of implementation, but it might suffer when the number of sensors grows very much. It has a broad range of potential applications in the field of Homeland Protection: surveillance of habitat and environmental monitoring, structural monitoring (e.g., bridges), contaminants, smart roads, intruder detection, battlefield. It is complementary to the classical surveillance with few large-costly sensors hierarchically organized.",

These networks should be designed to be resilient to Electronic Counter Measures (ECM), cyber attacks and should be able to manage increasing and highly variable flow of data. The satisfaction of such demanding requirements, maintaining however the limitation of resources such as energy, bandwidth and node complexity, can be achieved borrowing from biological systems several mechanism. For example bio-inspired sensor networks employ decentralized decisions through the self-synchronization mechanism observed in nature that allows forcing every single node of the network to reach the globally optimal decision, without the need of any fusion center. However there are also drawbacks associated to these architectures: in fully decentralized systems, communication issues are more complex and depend on the topology of the network; generally, communication overheads are higher than in centralized systems.",

Section 2.22.4 gives a broad and very general description of the basic categories of intelligence that are the source of data and information employed to perform the fusion process. The Sections 2.22.5 and 2.22.6 tackle different aspects related to homogeneous sensor networks. The former proposes several issues from a theoretical point of view, illustrating, next to traditional approaches, the new trends of Collaborative Signal and Information Processing (CSIP), self-organizing and selfsynchronizing sensor network; Section 2.22.5 proposes also some remarks about real applications and the need to rethink some mathematical algorithms to overcome the network centric approach. The latter, Section 2.22.6, proposes three real study cases where the novel approaches give significant results. Likewise Section 2.22.7 tackles the aspects related to heterogeneous sensor networks, dealing with the problems of deployment, behavior assignment and coordination of the different sensors. Also in this case a special attention is focused on the mathematical issues related to these new approaches. Real applications of this kind of sensor networks are described in Sections 2.22.8 and 2.22.9, respectively for the border control problem and the forecasting and estimation of an epidemics.

Data fusion is aimed to enhance situation awareness and decision making through the combination of information/data obtained by networks of homogeneous and/or heterogeneous sensors. A sensor network presents advantages over a single sensor under different points of views, as it supplies both redundant and complementary information. Redundant information is exploited to make the system robust to the failure in order that a malfunction of an entity of the system means only a degradation of the performances, rather than the complete failure of the system, since information about the same environment can be obtained from different sources. More robustness can be achieved also with respect to interferences, both intentional and unintentional, due to frequency and spatial diversity of the sensors. Complementary information build up a more complete picture of the observed system; for example sensors are dislocated over large regions providing diverse viewing angles of observed phenomenon and different technologies can be employed in the same application to provide improved system performance.",

For example, in the case of a sensor network employed for the surveillance of an area, usually the information traffic goes from the sensor nodes to a single sink node called information fusion center. According to the information received from the sensors, the fusion center monitors the area where the sensors are deployed and decides the actions to take. Conceptually, the algorithms employed in this case are relatively simple and the resource allocation is straightforward because the central component has an overall view of the whole system. This kind of architecture presents several drawbacks: high computational load, the possibility of catastrophic failure when the fusion node goes down and the lack of flexibility to changes of the system and sensor entities. Therefore this approach is still valid if the number of sensors, whose information is fused, independently of the width of the area to be monitored, is limited and also the relationship and interconnections among sensors are limited too.",

The principle of a hierarchy is to reduce the communications and computational loads of centralized systems by distributing data fusion tasks among a hierarchy of sensor entities. However in a hierarchy there is still a central component acting as a fusion center. Entities constituting local fusion center, locally process information and send it to the central fusion node. This approach is commonly used in robotics and surveillance applications. Although this architecture reduces the computational and communication loads, there are still some drawbacks",

Crisis management is the ability of identifying and assessing a crisis, planning a response, and acting to resolve the crisis situation. Border control aims to build a smart protection belt all around a country to counter terrorism and illegal activities; yet it is not resolutive due to the difficulty of controlling the country boundaries along their full and variegated extension, the non necessarily physical nature of attacks in the current information age, and the threats which often arise internally to the country itself. HS includes also land security that is particularly critical because of its complexity and strategic importance; the security of critical assets, such as electric power plants, communication infrastructures, strategic areas and railway networks, must be ensured continuously in space and time [25] [26] [27] . The most recent terrorist attacks have shown the vulnerability of national critical infrastructures [28] and have made the world aware of the possibility of large-scale terrorist offensive actions against civil society: the September 11th, 2001 attack on the World Trade center in New York City is the most dramatic example of this new terrorism. The main emphasis has been put on the terrorist threat, but what emerges is the fragility and vulnerability of modern society to both deliberate threats and natural disasters. The HP domain includes also the protection from deliberate attacks against the commercial activities of a Country led also out of the national territory, comprehensive also of the territorial waters and Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ). Seaborne piracy against transport vessels remains a significant issue (with estimated worldwide losses of US$13-16 billion per year), particularly in the waters between the Red Sea and Indian Ocean, off the Somali coast, and also in the Strait of Malacca and Singapore, which are navigated by over 50,000 commercial ships a year [29, 30] .",

Figure 22 .5 reports a block diagram representing this functional model. Although originally developed for military applications, the model is generally applicable. Furthermore, the model does not assume its functions to be automated, they could equally well be maintained by human labor. Hence, the model is both general and flexible.

In this level, which is sometimes referred to as multi-sensor data fusion or multisensor integration, data is combined to assign dynamic features (e.g., velocity) as well as static (e.g., identity) to objects, hence adding semantic labels to data. This level includes techniques for data association and management of objects (including creation and deletion of hypothesized objects, and state updates of the same). Level 1 addresses the following functions: data alignment, data/object correlation, object positional/kinematic/attribute estimation, object identity estimation. \u2022 Level 2-situation assessment: investigates the relations among entities such as force structure and communication roles. This level involves aggregation of level 1 entities into high-level, more abstract entities, and relations between entities. An entity in this level might be a pattern of connected objects of level 1 entities. Input data are assessed with respect to the environment, relationship among level 1 entities, and entity patterns in space and time. Level 2 addresses the following functions: object aggregation, contextual interpretation/fusion, event/activity aggregation, multi-perspective assessment. \u2022 Level 3-impact assessment: outlines sets of possible courses of action and the effect on the current situation. The impact assessment, which is sometimes called significance estimation or threat refinement, estimates and predicts the combined effects of system control plans and the entities of level 2 (possibly including estimated or predicted plans of other environment agents) on system objectives.

Process refinement evaluates the performance of the data fusion process during its operation and encompasses everything that refines it, e.g., acquisition of more relevant data, selection of more suitable fusion algorithms, optimization of resource usage with respect to, for instance, electrical power consumption. Process refinement is sometimes called process adaption to emphasize that it is dynamic and should be able to evolve with respect both its internal properties and the surrounding environment. The function of this level is in some literature handled by a so called meta-manager or meta-controller.

In 2002, a level 5 was added [39, 40] , named User Refinement, into the JDL model to support a user's trust, workload, attention, and situation awareness. Mainly the level 5 was added to distinguish between machine-process refinement and user refinement of either human control action or the user's cognitive model. In many cases the data fusion process is focused on the machine point of view, however a full advantage can be taken by considering also the human factor, not only as a qualified expert to refine the fusion process, but also as a costumer for whom the fusion system is designed. Figure 22 .6, taken from [40] , shows the JDL fusion model including also the level 5.",

Figure 22 .7 shows a multi-sensor data fusion architecture with a representation of the levels involved into each process of data fusion. Level 0 and level 1 concern the combination of data from different Data fusion architecture. sensors, level 2 and level 3 are often referred to as information fusion. Under the proposed partitioning scheme, the same entity can simultaneously be the subject of level 0, 1, 2, and 3 fusion processes. Entity features can be estimated from one or more entity signal observations (e.g., pixel intensities, emitter pulse streams) via a level 0 data preparation/association/estimation process. The identity, location, track and activity state of an entity (whether it be a man, a vehicle, or a military formation) can be estimated on the basis of attributes inferred from one or more observations; i.e., via a level 1 data preparation/association/estimation process. The same entity's compositional or relational state (e.g., its role within a larger structure and its relations with other elements of that structure) can be inferred via level 2 processes. Thus, a single entity-anything with internal structure, whether man, machine, or mechanized infantry brigade-can be treated either as an individual, subject to level 1 observation and state estimation-or as a \"situation,\" subject to compositional analysis via level 2 entity/entity association and aggregate state estimation. The impact of a signal, entity, or situation on the user goal or mission can then be predicted based upon an association of these to alternative courses of action for each entity via a level 3 process.",

In [45, 46] he identified three levels of situation awareness, namely perception, comprehension, and projection, parallel to the corresponding levels in the JDL model. Therefore the levels in the JDL model can be considered as processes producing results to help a human operator became aware of the situation. In [47] in addition to this three different aspects identified by Endsley, the model included also \"intention\" (i.e., the understanding of own options and courses of action relative to own goals) and \"metacognition\" (i.e., accounting for how reliable own situation awareness is likely to be). These levels summarize the fact that situation awareness requires the understanding of information, events, and the impact of own actions on own goals and objectives. This process involves several capabilities as learning, detection of anomalies, prediction of future behaviors, managing uncertainty, and analysis of heterogeneous sources.",

Because decision-support systems for situational awareness are tightly coupled with fusion systems, the OODA loop has also been used for sensor fusion [49] . Observations in OODA refer to scanning the environment and gathering information from it; orientation is the use of the information to form a mental image of the circumstances; decision is considering options and selecting a subsequent course of action; and action refers to carrying out the conceived decision.

An example of result at the first level may be represented by the automatic identification of a tank by processing of row sensors data; at the next level an enemy unit composition can be indentified on the basis of its number and relative locations.

In their seminal work H. Cramer and C.R. Rao found how to compute the best theoretical accuracy that can be achieved by an estimator. The lower bound of accuracy, i.e., the mean square error of any unbiased estimator, is given by the inverse of the so-called Fisher Information Matrix (FIM). The computation of the CRLB (Cramer-Rao Lower Bound) applies to problems involving the maximum likelihood estimation of unknown constant parameters from noisy measurements [59] . The best achievable improvement of target location and track accuracy can be quantified by the reduction of the CRLB consequent to the track fusion. In [60] this computation is reported in case of fusion of data from two sensors with an ideal unitary detection probability. In [61, 62] the same computation has been proposed in case of detection probability less than one and false alarm probability higher than zero. Cooperative sensor data fusion: A cooperative sensor network uses the information provided by two independent sensors to derive information that would not be available from the single sensors. An example for a cooperative sensor configuration is stereoscopic vision: by combining two-dimensional images from two cameras at slightly different viewpoints a three-dimensional image of the observed scene is derived. Cooperative sensor fusion is the most difficult to design, because the resulting data are sensitive to inaccuracies in all individual participating sensors. Thus, in contrast to competitive fusion, cooperative sensor fusion generally decreases accuracy and reliability. Sensor S4 and S5 in Figure 22 .8 represent a cooperative configuration. Both sensors observe the same object, but the measurements are used to form an emerging view on object C that could not have been derived from the measurements of S4 or S5 alone.",

In the field of Homeland Protection one of the main task to be assigned to a sensor network is the surveillance with its most general significance. Automatic surveillance is a process of monitoring the behavior of selected objects (targets and/or anomalies) inside a specific area by means of sensors. A target generally consists of an object (e.g., a tank close to a land border or a rubber approaching to the coast) whose presence and characteristics can be detected and estimated by the sensor; an anomaly consists in a non usual behavior (e.g., a jeep moving off-road, the increasing of the radioactivity level within an area) that can be revealed by the sensor.

In this case the sensors are costly, with adequate computation and communication capabilities. Sensors are normally located in properly selected sites, to mitigate terrain masking problems; nevertheless, they provide different performance depending on the location of target inside the surveillance area. Typical sensors are radars (ground-based, air-borne, ship-borne or space-based), infrared or TV cameras, seismic, acoustical, radioactive sensors. Usually in this kind of networks, as represented in Figure 22 .9, the information traffic goes from the sensor nodes to a single Block-diagram for optimal system resource management in a sensor network. sink node called information fusion center that performs the target localization and tracking.

            "text": "Nowadays, a novel approach to the automatic surveillance has been adopted; it is based on the use of many sensors with short range capabilities, low costs, and limited computation and communication capabilities. In case of a huge number of sensors, the use of information fusion centers is unpractical and their functioning is based on the information exchange between \"near-by\" sensors. The sensors can be distributed in fixed positions of the territory, but they could also be deployed adaptively to the change of the scenario. There are several approaches: they can be randomly distributed inside the surveillance area and if the number of sensors is high, the performance of the surveillance system can be considered independent of the location of the targets; then the signal received by each sensor is processed using the computational capabilities of a sub-portion of the sensor system and employed to re-organize dynamically the network. Sensors may be agile in a variety of ways, e.g., the ability to reposition, point an antenna, choose sensing mode, or waveform. Notice that the number of potential tasking of the network grows exponentially with the number of sensors. The goal of sensor management in a large network is to choose actions for individual sensors dynamically so as to maximize overall network utility. This process is called Collaborative Signal and Information Processing (CSIP) [65] . One of the central issues for CSIP to address is energy-constrained dynamic sensor collaboration: how to dynamically determine who should sense, what needs to be sensed, and who the information must be passed onto. This kind of processing system allows a limitation in the consumption of power. Applying a surveillance strategy which accounts for the target tracking accuracy and the sensor random location, only a limited number of sensors are awake and follow/anticipate the target movement; thus, the network self-organizes to detect and track the target, allowing an efficient performance from the energetic point of view with limited sensor prime power and with a reduced number of sensors working in the whole network. For example in [66] , instead of requesting data from all the sensors, the fusion center iteratively selects sensors for the target localization: first a small number of anchor sensors send their data to the fusion center to obtain a coarse location estimate, then, at each step a few non-anchor sensors are activated to send their data to the fusion center to refine the location estimate iteratively. Moreover the possibility to actively probe certain nodes allows to disambiguate multiple interpretations of an event.",

This quantity is dependent on the actual observation data up to the current time, and is implicitly dependent on the underlying system state. Therefore, it is adaptive to the particular realization of the underlying system state and provides a more accurate and effective online indication of the estimation performance than the unconditional PCRLB. In [71, 72] the PCRLB is proposed as a criterion to dynamically select a subset of sensors over time within the network to optimize the tracking performance in terms of mean square error.

Sensors are randomly spread out over a two dimensional surveillance area. In a self-organized system, its elements affect only close elements; distant parts of the system are basically unaffected. The control is distributed, i.e., all the elements contribute to the fulfillment of the task. The system is relatively insensitive to perturbations or errors, and have a strong capacity to restore itself. Initially independent components form a coherent whole able to efficiently fulfill a particular function [74] . Flocks of birds, shoals of fish, swarms of bees are examples of self-organizing systems; they move together in an elegantly synchronized manner without a leader which coordinates them and decides their movement. It has been shown that flocks of birds selforganize into V-formations when they need to travel long distances to save energy, by taking advantage of the upwash generated by the neighboring birds. Cattivelli and Sayed [75] propose a model for the upwash generated by a flying bird, and shows that a flock of birds is able to self-organize into a Vformation as if every bird processes spatial and network information by means of an adaptive diffusive process. This result has interesting implications. First, a simple diffusion algorithm is able to account for self-organization of birds. Second, according to the model, that birds can self-organize on the basis of the upwash generated by the other birds. Third, some information is necessarily shared among birds to reach the optimal flight formation. The paper also proposes a modification to the algorithm that allows birds to organize, starting from a V-formation, into a U-formation, leading to an equalization effect, where every bird in the flock observes approximately the same upwash. The same algorithm based on birds flight is extended in [76] to the problem of distributed detection, where a set of sensors/nodes is required to decide between two hypotheses on the basis of the collected measurements. Each node makes individual real-time decisions and communicates only with its immediate neighbors, in order that any fusion center is not necessary. The proposed distributed detection algorithms are based on diffusion strategies described in [77] [78] [79] and their performance is evaluated by means of classical probabilities of detection and false alarms.",

            "text": "Several studies have shown how a simple self-synchronization mechanism, borrowed from biological systems, can form the basic tool for achieving globally optimal distribution decisions in a wireless sensor network with no need for a fusion center. Self-synchronization is a phenomenon first observed between pendulum clocks (hooked to the same wooden beam) by Christian Huygens in 1658. Since then, self-synchronization has been observed in a myriad of natural phenomena, from flashing fireflies in South East Asia to singing crickets, from cardiac peacemaker or neuron cells to menstrual cycles of women living in strict contact with each other [80] . The goal of these studies is to find a strategy of interaction among the sensors/nodes that could allow them to reach globally optimal decisions in terms of a \"consensus\" value in a totally decentralized manner. Distributed consensus algorithms are indeed techniques largely studied in distributed computing [81, 82] . The approaches suggested in [83, 84] give a form of consensus achieved through self-synchronization that may result critical in wide-area networks, where propagation delays might induce an ambiguity problem. This problem is overcome in [85] [86] [87] where also a model of the network and of the sensors is proposed. Each of the N nodes composing the network is equipped with four basic components: (1) a transducer that senses the physical parameter of interest y i (e.g., temperature, concentration of contaminants, radiation, etc.); (2) a local processing unit that provides a function g i (y i ) of the measurements; (3) a dynamical system, initialized with the local measurements, whose state x i (t) evolves as a function of its own measurement g i (y i ) and of the state of nearby sensors; (4) a radio interface that makes possible the interactions among the sensors. The criterion to reach a consensus value is the asymptotical convergence toward a common value of all the derivatives of the state, for any set of initial conditions and for any set of bounded. This condition makes the convergence to the final consensus independent of the network graph topology. However the topology has an impact on several aspects: the overall energy necessary to achieve the consensus and the convergence time. In general there exists a trade-off between the local power transmitted by a each sensor and the converge time depending on the algebraic connectivity of the network graph, as shown in [88] . In the practical applications these aspects cannot be neglected; for instance, the design of a network should account for the precision to achieve, and the time to get the consensus value at the given precision, versus such constraints as the energy limitations of the sensors. A global overview of the problem is given in [89] .",

This problem and the similar data association problem are very important and apply also to single sensor data processing. To perform data registration, the relative locations of the sensors, the relationship between their coordinate systems, and any timing errors need to be known, or estimated, and accounted for otherwise a mismatch between the compiled picture and the truth may result. An overstated confidence in the accuracy of the fused output, and inconsistencies between track databases, such as multiple tracks that correspond to a single target may appear. A missed registration can result from location and orientation errors of the sensor relative to the supporting platform, or of the platform relative to the Earth, such as a bearing measurement with an incorrect North alignment. Errors may be present in data time stamping, and numerical errors may occur in transforming data from one coordinate system to another. Automatic sensor registration can correct for these problems by estimating the bias in the measurements along with the kinematics of the target. However, the errors in sensor registration need to be known and accounted for [90] . In [91] a maximum likelihood (EML) algorithm for registration is presented using a recursive two-step optimization that involves a modified Gauss-Newton procedure to ensure fast convergence. In [92] a novel joint sensor association, registration, and fusion is performed exploiting the expectation-maximization algorithm incorporated with the linear Kalman filter (KF) to give simultaneous state and parameter estimates. The same approach can be followed also with non linear filtering techniques as the Extended KF (EKF) and the Unscented KF (UKF) as proposed in [93] , where also the performance is evaluated by means of the PCRLB.",

The model of sensor network presented here is characterized by the absence of a fusion center. In other words the deployment, the construction of the consensus values, and the detection of local anomalies in the data are the result of local interactions between sensors. Nevertheless the local interactions will lead to global solution of the considered problem. This is an example of model of a network centric sensor network. The sensors are assumed to be identical and they measure a quantity pertinent to the properties of the area to survey able to reveal the presence of an intruder. In the proposed study case the sensors are able to measure the temperature of the territory in the position or in the \"area\" where they are located; in absence of anomalies there is a uniform temperature on the territory where the sensors are deployed. The sensor measures are noisy and can be considered synchronous. This measurement process is repeated periodically in time with a given frequency. From these measures a \"consensus\" temperature is deduced, pertinently to the territory where the sensors are deployed and an estimate of the magnitude of the noise contained in the data. Finally using these consensus values as reference values local anomalies are Territory of the city of Urbino (Italy) selected for the study case.",

The issue of resource constraints is particularly important for a network of chemical sensors, because modern chemical sensors are equipped with air-sampling units (fans), which turn on when the sensor is active. Operating a fan requires a significant amount of energy as well as a frequent replacement of some consumable items (i.e., cartridges, filters). This leads to the critical requirement in the design of a WSN to reduce the active (air-sampling) time of its individual sensors.",

The DSC implies that a sensor in the network should be invoked (or activated) only when the network will gain information by its activation [104] . For each individual sensor this information gain can be evaluated against other performance criteria of the sensor system, such as the detection delay or the detection threshold, to find an optimal solution in given circumstances. However, the DSC-based algorithms involve continuous estimation of the state of each sensor in the network and usually require extensive computer simulations [103, 104] . These simulations may become unpractical as the number of sensors in the network increases. Furthermore, the simulations can provide the numerical values for optimal network parameters only for a specific scenario.",

In this section we will present the experimental results obtained using real data and a Bayesian estimation algorithm combined with the minimum description length (MDL) for source number estimation. A radiological field trial was conducted on a large, flat, and open area without any obstacles at the Puckapunyal airfield site in Victoria, Australia. The measurements were collected using the DSTOs 3 Low Cost Advanced Airborne Radiological Survey (LCAARS) survey system which consists of an AN/PDR-77 radiation survey meter equipped with an RS232 interface module, a gamma probe and software written in Visual Basic running on a laptop computer. The gamma probe contains two GM tubes to cover both low and high ranges of dose rates. It was capable of measuring gamma radiation dose rates from background to 9.99 Sv/h 4 without saturating [130] with a fairly flat response [131] . Three radiation sources were used in the field trial: source 1 was a cesium sources ( 137 Cs) with \u03d1 1 = 11 m 10 m 9105 \u00b5Sv/h T , source 2 was also a cesium source with \u03d1 2 = 3 m 50 m 1868 \u00b5Sv/h T , and source 3 was a cobalt source ( 60 Co) with \u03d1 3 = 41m 5m 467 \u00b5Sv/h T . The aerial image of the experimental site with the location of sources and the local Cartesian coordinate system is shown in Figure 22 .17. Four data sets were collected during the field trails in the presence of r sources, with respectively r = 0, 1, 2, 3 [132] . Data sets with r > 0 sources contains 50 count measurements in each measurement point. Estimation of parameter vector \u03d1, under the assumption that r is known, was carried out using the Bayesian importance sampling technique known as the progressive correction [125, 133] . This technique assumes that prior distribution of \u03d1, denoted p 0 (\u03d1), is available. The information contained in the measurement vector z is combined with the prior to give the posterior pdf: p(\u03d1|z) \u221d l(z|\u03d1) \u00b7 p 0 (\u03d1). The minimum mean squared error estimate of \u03d1 is then the posterior expectation:",

This indicates that the measurement model is not perfect, which is not surprising considering that it is based on many approximations. In situations where the measurement likelihood is not exact, it is necessary to introduce a degree of caution to make the estimation more robust. In the framework of progressive correction this can be achieved by G S = S l=1 \u03b3 l < 1.

Since a single sensor generally can only perceive limited partial information about the environment, multiple similar and/or dissimilar sensors are required to provide sufficient local pictures with different focus and from different viewpoints in an integrated manner. As viewed, information from heterogeneous sensors can be combined using data fusion algorithms to obtain synergistic observation effects. Thus the benefit of multi-sensors system are to broaden perception and enhance awareness of the state of the world compared to what could be acquired by a single sensor system.

One is the centra1ized paradigm, where all actions of all sensors are decided by a central mechanism. The other alternative is to treat sensors in the network as distributed intelligent agents with some degree of autonomy. In such a decentralized architecture, bi-directional communication between sensors is enabled, so that communication bottlenecks possibly existing in a centralized network can be avoided. A major research objective of decentralized sensor management is to establish cooperative behavior between sensors with no or little external supervision. In a decentralized sensor network scenario a local view perceived from a sensor can be shared by some members of the sensor community. Intuitively, a local picture from one sensor can be used to direct the attention of other sensors or transfer tasks such as target tracking from one sensor to another. An interesting question is how participating sensors can autonomously coordinate their movements and sensing actions, on grounds of shared information, to develop an optimal global awareness of the environment with parsimonious consumption of time and resources.",

The simple ones have only the capability of sensing their coverage area with a reduced computation capabilities and they transmit data to complex sensors. The information they provide may be encoded, for example, by a \"1\" if sensor detects something crossing its coverage area and by a \"0\" otherwise. Complex sensors, instead, have computation capabilities; they are able to locate the target by applying sophisticated algorithms (e.g., in [143] the maximum likelihood estimation algorithm is applied). The topology simulated in [143] , constituted by 80 simple sensors and 20 complex sensors, is represented in Figure 22 .19b: the sensors are indicated by circles; the complex sensors are connected by the solid lines, simple and complex sensor by dashed lines. Figure 22 .20 shows the number of active sensors during the target tracking: the theoretical value and the simulated value are compared. It is evident that in a self-organizing configuration the number of active sensors is optimized with the consequent advantage of saving of power. An adaptive self-configuring system consists of a collection of independent randomly located sensors that, carrying ahead local interactions, estimate the position of the target without a centralized control unit that coordinates their communication. It is fault tolerant and adapts to changing conditions. Furthermore, it is able to self-configuring, i.e., there is not an external entity that configures the network. Finally, the task is performed efficiently, i.e., it guarantees both a reasonably long network life and good target tracking performances. From local interactions, sensors form an efficient system that follows the target, i.e., local communication leads to a self-organizing network that exploits the features of the theories of random graphs and of self-organizing systems. The most natural way to approach random network topology is by means of the theory of random graphs [144, 145] . The theory of random graphs allows, for instance, to compute an upper bound to the estimated number of active sensors at each time step.",

However the use of airborne platforms to perform surveillance, are limited to missions \"on spot\" because it is not practical or cost/effective for continuous surveillance. The radar sensor can be mounted on manned or unmanned aircraft, usually equipped with electro-optic devices, and they can be used to monitor areas of several tenths of kilometer length.

            "text": "Fixed radars for border control are usually in X and Ku band, but, because of the attenuation they suffer from foliage, they cannot be used for FOPEN applications. The ability of traditional microwave radars in operating in an environment with dense foliage is severely limited by foliage backscatter and attenuation of microwave frequencies through foliage [151] . As attenuation falls with increasing wavelength, lower frequencies such as those in the VHF and UHF bands (30-1000 MHz) may be suitable for FOPEN radar applications [152] [153] [154] [155] . FOPEN SAR (Synthetic Aperture Radar) systems started to be used in the early 1990s. They are usually mounted on manned or unmanned aircraft and mainly address illegal activity control and search-and-rescue operations. The focus is now for ground based systems and/or sensors with capabilities to detect walking personnel and moving vehicles [156] . Logistic constraints drive the technology to very low power devices, that are able to operate for several months or years, without maintenance. Another important issue is, together with a good probability of detection, the low false alarm probability, that is requested to be lowered up to 1 false alarm per day, or lower, even in presence of specific weather conditions (rain, wind) and/or local seasonal fauna. A special attention is due to the effect of environment. In dense foliage environments the main clutter effects are the backscatter and the attenuation. Backscatter: The fixed clutter returns can have a zero Doppler component raising up to 60-70 dB above the noise level with spectra amplitude and shape without large variations with frequency, but depending mainly on the wind strength [150] . Considering the measurements reported in [150] of the backscatter Doppler spectra, in order to perform efficient clutter rejection, two values of thresholds can be used: i.e., 1 m/s in case of light air, 2 m/s in case of windy/gale. Attenuation: The attenuation depends mainly on the frequency used and the radar beam grazing angle, even if small variations are reported with different polarizations [153] . Many studies have been carried out for SAR application and several studies report data for attenuation measured directly at ground level [151, 153, 154, 157] . The total attenuation, taking in account the major effects of the environment for a ground radar, can be summarized as follows: (22.45) where: 4 is the attenuation due to the ground reflection at the heights of the antenna (h r ) and the target (h t ), for the wavelength \u03bb, \u2022 L f is the attenuation due to the foliage: it depends on the distance, the polarization and the forest type. It depends also on the distribution of the trees and the diameter of the masts, that can limit the line of sight, together with the height and density of lower canopy level.",

In consideration of the potentially huge geographic extension of the system and of the importance to optimize the deployment of sensors as well as communication and processing power resources, a distributed tracking architecture is necessary. At the first level of the tracking architecture each sensor produces its own \"local\" tracks, in order to make available to the fusion engine a filtered information. Then a second level tracking combines local tracks originating from different sources into system tracks. This solution distributes the computational load on the peripheral nodes and reduces considerably the communication traffic which must be transmitted from the local level to the higher echelons; this is extremely important in consideration of the reduced bandwidth generally available between the peripheral elements and the center of the system.",

Digital Terrain Elevation Data (DTED) are also used to perform accurate projections of the tracks on the terrain and to identify zones where the target trajectory will be masked by obstacles and thus improve track continuity and the estimate of track kinematic parameters (e.g., maximum target velocity given the terrain type). The following Figure 22 .30 shows, for instance, how environmental knowledge can be exploited to improve the tracking function [170, 171] . Figure 22 .30a shows a landscape covered by forests and crossed by a network of paths; due to the nature of the environment, targets especially if motorized, will preferentially move along the track, avoiding off-road areas more difficult to traverse. The blue line represents the trajectory of a track which moves along a winding path in the forest. Figure 22 .30b on the other side shows how information relative to roads and viability in general can be exploited to improve the tracking performance. When the track approaches a bifurcation or a crossing, different hypotheses are generated to take into account possible target trajectories, such as on-road, off-road and also move-stop motion. More specifically the adoption of techniques such as road aided tracking is specifically important since it allows to improve the accuracy in the estimation of target kinematic parameters and therefore to make longer term projections. Finally weather information is exploited to further improve the tracking processing by feeding in information about areas where target detection is less probable (e.g., flooded areas) and expected target velocity is low given the past days weather conditions (e.g., heavy rain is expected to result in limited target velocity).",

In a coastal scenario NCTR capabilities are needed against ships, potentially involved in terrorism, illegal immigration or contraband operations, in order to assess and prioritize threats and to provide the appropriate response. Sensors such as radar, EO/IR, may provide useful information for classification. In the radar case, the NCTR technology facilitates the identification of non-co-operative targets by transmitting wide band signals and by processing the radar echoes in a suitable multidimensional domain; e.g., time-frequency and range-angle. In the former case the target is discriminated on the basis of the jet engine or the helicopter rotor modulations of the echo [172] [173] [174] [175] ; in the latter case the target is discriminated on the basis of the measured two-dimensional radar image obtained by ISAR techniques [176] [177] [178] (Figure  22 .31 shows a snapshot of the radar image of a ship).",

The key idea is to detect an epidemic outbreak using early symptoms, well before the clinical or laboratory data result in a definite diagnosis. The rationale is that a spread of an infectious disease is usually associated with the measurable changes in the social behavior, which can be measured by non-medical means. Recent studies [183] [184] [185] have demonstrated that these non-medical sources of syndromic data streams, such as the absenteeism from work/school, the pharmaceutical sales, internet queries, twitter messages, and alike, can enable one to draw important conclusions regarding the epidemic state in the community. The \"Google Flu\" project [186] (flu-related searches in Google) is a well publicized example of this approach.",

In general, all algorithms applied in this area can be divided into two main groups, the data mining methods and the information fusion (also known as data assimilation) methods. Data mining is primarily concerned with the extraction of patterns from massive amounts of raw data without using dynamic models of the underlying process (i.e., epidemic spread) [183, 185] . Information fusion algorithms, on the contrary, strongly rely of mathematical models: in this case, the dynamic model of an epidemic outbreak and the measurement model of a particular syndromic data stream [187, 188] . Naturally, the accuracy of information fusion algorithms is significantly determined by the fidelity of the underlying models.",

While a similar work has been considered earlier, see [189] [190] [191] [192] , this section introduces two novelties. First, in order to overcome the limitations of the standard \"compartment\" model of epidemic spread (the \"well-mixed\" approximation) we employ a more flexible alternative, see [193, 194] . The adopted epidemic model has the explicit parameter of \"mixing efficiency\" (or level of social interaction) and is therefore more appropriate to represent a variety of social interactions in a small community (e.g., self-isolation and panic). An advantage of the adopted epidemiological model is also that it enables to estimate the scaling law of the noise level with respect to the population size of a community. Second, a more flexible model of syndromic measurements, validated with data sets available in the literature [183, 186] , is adopted in the section. This measurement model is robust in the sense that some of its parameters are specified imprecisely, as interval values. The optimal sequential estimator (filter) and predictor are then formulated in the Bayesian framework and solved using a particle filter.",

To cater for this uncertainty, we assume that \u03c2 j can take any value in an interval, \u03c2 \u2208 \u03c2 1 , \u03c2 2 around \u03c2 = 1.

Figure 22 .33 shows the histograms of particle filter estimated values of \u03b1, \u03b2, and \u03bd, after processing 25 days of syndromic data (i.e., in total 100 measurements). The histograms in this figure reveals that the uncertainty in parameters \u03b1 and \u03b2 has been substantially reduced after processing the data (compared with the initial p(\u03b1 0 ) and p(\u03b2 0 )). The uncertainty in \u03bd, on the other hand, has not been reduced, indicating that this parameter cannot be estimated from syndromic data. While this is unfortunate, it does not appear to be a serious problem in forecasting the epidemic mainly because the prior on \u03bd in practice is fairly tight ( \u03bd \u2248 1). This is confirmed in Figure 22 .34 which shows a sample of 100 overlaid predicted epidemic curves (gray lines) based on the estimate of i, s, \u03b1, \u03b2, \u03bd obtained after 25 days. Figure 22 .34 indicates that the forecast of the peak of the epidemic is fairly accurate, while the forecast of the size of the peak is more uncertain. Most importantly, however, the true epidemic curve (solid red line) appears to be always enveloped by the prediction curves. More experimental results can be found in [199] .",

The discussed matter has been subdivided in nine sections which have covered a long trip starting from the description of the Homeland Protection problem, to the illustration of a wide spectrum of information sources (sensors and the like), to the netting of such sensors (both homogeneous and heterogeneous), with a broad range of practical applications: cooperative sensing to defend a urban territory, network of cooperative chemical sensors, detection and localization of radioactive point sources, use of so-called electronic fence to protect long borderlines of a territory, up to the estimation and forecasting of an epidemic. This work, an unofficial collaboration between experts from industry, research centers and academia, has brought together a wide spectrum of competences scientific, technical/technological/systemic and on the field.

The continuous analog of the steepest descent method consists in obtaining the solution of the optimization problem of Eq.(22.5)  computing the asymptotic value as \u03bb 1 goes to infinity of a solution of Eq. (22.8) equipped when \u03bb 1 = 0 with a suitable initial condition. This asymptotic value hopefully is a point that solves Eq. (22.5) and satisfies Eqs.(22.6)  and(22.7).Note that the function F i depends only on \u03be j , j \u2208 L i , that is can be computed in the location \u03be i using only information available in \u03be i , i= 1, 2, . . . ,N . Approximating the gradient of F with the appropriate pieces of the gradients of the function F i , i = 1, 2, . . . , N , and using Eq. (22.9) instead than Eq. (22.8) we can find an approximation of the solution of Eq. (22.5) integrating numerically the initial value problem for Eq. (22.9). Note that the solution for the ith differential equation of Eq. (22.9) is computed in the location \u03be i , i = 1, 2, . . . , N . This approximation of the solution of Eq. (22.5) is obtained using only local information so that it is \"network centric.\" When the asymptotic value as \u03bb 1 goes to infinity, the solution of Eq. (22.9) coincides with an asymptotic value of a solution of Eq. (22.8), solving numerically Eq. (22.9), we can obtain in a network centric manner a solution of Eq. (22.5).

Note that in Figure 22.13a we have \u03be i = B i , i = 1, 2, . . . , 20. The Figure 22.13b shows an optimal Voronoi partition. Note that in Figure 22.13b we have \u03be i = B i , i = 1, 2, . . . , 20. The Voronoi partition shown in Figure 22.13b satisfies Eqs. (22.5)-(22.7). The centers ofFigure 22.13b have been obtained integrating numerically, using the explicit Euler method in Eq.(22.9), equipped with the initial condition given by the centers shown inFigure 22.13a. InFigure 22.14 we show the graph associated to the optimal Voronoi partition of shown inFigure 22.13b. The graph is obtained joining with branches the Voronoi centers that are (distinct) neighbors.

For \u03c9 = 0, the pdf \u03c1 of Eq. (22.18) has a delta impulse in zero, meaning that the measured concentration in the presence of intermittency can be zero on some occasions.
