Infectious diseases, whether they be natural (e.g. SARS [severe acute respiratory syndrome] and influenza) or the result of bioterrorism, have the potential to create a large influx of critically ill into our already strained hospital systems. With proper planning, hospitals, health care workers and our health care systems can be better prepared to deal with such an eventuality. This review explores the Toronto critical care experience of coping in the SARS outbreak disaster. Our health care system and, in particular, our critical care system were unprepared for this event, and as a result the impact that SARS had was worse than it could have been. Nonetheless, we were able to organize a response rapidly during the outbreak. By describing our successes and failures, we hope to help others to learn and avoid the problems we encountered as they develop their own disaster management plans in anticipation of similar future situations.",

The strength of Ontario's response lay in the work of the people who stepped up and fought SARS. What went right in a system where so much went wrong, is their dedication \u2026 [1] Disaster management plans have traditionally been required to manage major traumatic events that create a large number of victims. Infectious diseases, whether they be natural or the result of bioterrorism, have the potential to create a large influx of critically ill patients, and disaster management planning should take such eventualities into account. This need was demonstrated in February 2003, when a new illness -SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) -spread from the People's Republic of China to 28 countries, resulting in 8096 probable cases with 774 deaths [2] . This review explores the Toronto critical care experience of coping in a disaster outbreak situation. By sharing our experiences and our coping strategies, we hope that others will learn from our successes and avoid the problems we encountered, many of which were a direct result of lack of preparedness. We hope that this review will encourage others to make plans to cope with similar outbreaks in the future, should they occur.",

            "text": "The diagnosis of SARS relies on a high index of clinical suspicion because there is no early, reliable and readily available diagnostic test for the responsible virus (SARS-CoV) [3] [4] [5] [6] . Likewise, it is expected that other emerging infectious agents will pose diagnostic challenges. Because of this, as infected individuals present to medical institutions where staff are unprepared, the risk for spread is considerable. An outbreak situation may arise quickly and without much warning, taxing the resources of any health care system and the ability of its personnel to cope. The most fundamental guidance we offer is that you need to have a plan in advance. Since 11 September 2001, the USA and other countries have run exercises to prepare for attacks, including bioterrorism [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] . We believe that, based on the way in which SARS crippled our health care system (in particular critical care delivery) and dealt significant blows to our economy, a great deal could be gained from simulating similar events and planning a system wide response to emerging pathogens. The development of a disaster management plan in the event of emerging diseases poses very unique challenges, and we offer some insights into these below.",

The model we propose (Fig. 1 ) is one of a Central Critical Care Crisis Team, composed of leaders of different subteams of multidisciplinary professionals responsible for domains of crucial importance: clinical management, infection control, education, communication, team morale, manpower and system thinking, data collection, research and, finally, lobbying to ensure resources are available to meet critical care needs. Appointed leaders should have the capacity to gather quickly a team of professionals to help address issues within their domains. Team membership is not a competition or a measure of professional worth. Rather, consideration must be given to who can best fulfill the roles. The role of the Central Critical Care Crisis Team is to coordinate the efforts of the various leaders, to avoid duplication of efforts and, through regular sharing of information, problems and support, to work together to devise creative solutions and anticipate future needs. Concerted efforts to address cross-institutional problems can be addressed in these forums.",

This was an issue that had to be addressed immediately because getting appropriate staff to work required that they felt as protected as possible. Anecdotally, we found in some centres that distrust occasionally emerged between front-line health care workers and leadership. This may have been due to several issues, including the following: there was no clear system-wide communication strategy, and as a result rumours and speculation frequently went unchecked; infection control and other recommendations changed frequently, leading many individuals to question the validity of previous directives; and confusion over whether the responsible virus could be airborne and variable use of airborne versus droplet protection. Of note, subsequent evidence suggests that airborne transmission may in fact be possible [16] . In retrospect, we believe a city-wide, consistent and regular communication strategy (which occurred in some institutions) that acknowledged the fact that leadership was making decisions in the face of uncertainty would have minimized the distrust.",

The presence of leaders who are prepared to risk their own health alongside front-line staff, who listen to staff concerns and address them to the best of their ability, and who discuss and/or reiterate management plans is another straightforward means to provide much needed support and a boost to staff morale. It is important that leadership demonstrate willingness to participate in the front-line environment.

Questions arose regarding whether there is a duty to care and how much personal risk should be expected [22] . Some refused to care for SARS patients, and some refused to even enter wards containing SARS patients [22] . Others demanded 'danger pay' and compensation for illness and quarantine. Understandably, some worried about the extent of their disability and life insurance coverage. These views raised further challenges, fracturing the front-line teams who found themselves asking what, if anything, made their colleagues' lives more 'valuable' than their own. Issues of duty to care and of balancing personal risk and professional obligations remain for a large part unanswered. Further research and debate is required. Disaster planning must, however, consider whether such issues are likely to arise and include potential strategies to deal with them. Consideration should be given to developing means to decrease the anxiety regarding transmission of illness to family members; these could include child care and arranging the provision of alternate living quarters for staff, among others.",

This was a big problem because our occupancy rates were already unacceptably high. This supply issue will become a crucial concern in any future outbreak or disaster situation. In addition to our problem with bed availability, the human resources component further exacerbated the problem; the staff numbers were reduced by fear of contracting the disease, quarantine and illness. When SARS transmission occurred in ICUs, entire units were quarantined for 12-14 days. Of tertiary care university medical/surgical ICU beds and community ICU beds in Toronto, 38% and 33%, respectively, were closed at some point [28] . Maintaining provision of ICU services to non-SARS patients became an important consideration as the outbreak progressed. In anticipation of future outbreaks, plans to organize critical care resources to meet the needs of all critically ill patients should be developed. For example, critical care beds can be rapidly augmented by other areas of the hospital that are adequately equipped (e.g. recovery rooms, operating rooms, emergency rooms, etc.).",

The scope of future outbreaks or disasters will always be uncertain, but, potentially, critical care providers will need to be able to care for many, many more patients very quickly. Because most ICUs currently function at very high occupancy rates, absorbing such additional numbers is unimaginable. Meeting these needs clearly requires us to move from institution-based to system-based thinking.

Such measures may also result in faster disease containment (by decreasing breaches in infection control) and better patient care as the teams become more familiar with the disease. Unlike the Toronto experience, in which SARS hospitals were designated late in the outbreak, SARS hospitals in other countries experienced little to no transmission to staff [30] . In Toronto, entire ICUs were quarantined as a result of transmission of SARS to staff [28] . Subsequently, provision of critical care to both SARS patients and all other critically ill patients was jeopardized. Although designation of outbreak hospitals seems a simple solution, it is not as easy as it appears. For example, finding staff willing to work in such a setting is a challenge. In addition, such a plan does not preclude other hospitals from knowing how to deal with the illness because, for the most part, the diagnosis is not clear for several days and originating hospitals will need to be prepared to manage patients until that point. Furthermore, designated hospitals will need access to other medical services as affected individuals develop other complications. Finally, the act of transporting such contagious individuals is not without considerable risk, and hence transportation requires careful planning. We recommend that regions develop and, importantly, test plans for working as a system during a disaster like this.",

The SARS outbreak has taught us that we can no longer accept, without comment or objection, the present need to cope and function, day in and day out, in a situation of inadequate critical care resources and manpower. The importance of having all levels of government understand what critical care is, what our needs are, and the help we require to serve our patients now and in the future is perhaps the most valuable lesson of all that we offer to our readers -one that we learned the hard way from surviving the SARS outbreak.",

Training our staff and our future ICU trainees for such eventualities, through the use of simulators and mock disaster codes, has become necessary to build on our successes and learn from our past to avoid the problems we encountered during SARS.",
