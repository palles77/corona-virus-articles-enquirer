Affected individuals became susceptible to opportunistic infections and specific immune deficiency resulting from the depletion of CD4+ lymphocytes. Intensive investigation revealed the etiologic agent of AIDS to be a lymphotropic retrovirus, the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) [2, 3] . Today, three classes of drugs are available to treat patients infected with HIV: the nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTI), the nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTI), and the protease inhibitors (PI). The currently accepted standard of care for HIV infection involves the use of three drug combination regimens [4] . The use of combination therapy has profoundly reduced the morbidity and mortality associated with HIV infection. However, the approved anti-HIV drugs and the combination(s) of these drugs have significant limitations including toxicity, the selection of drug-resistant variants, pharmacokinetic interactions with other agents and poor adherence due to complex dosing regimens. These limitations have necessitated the continued search for anti-HIV agents with an improved clinical profile.",

In addition to the morbidity associated with acute clinical infection, chronic liver disease, cirrhosis, hepatitis delta virus infection and primary hepatocellular carcinoma are recognized sequelae [5] . The reservoir for HBV includes an estimated worldwide population of 300 million carriers. Approximately 25% of chronic carriers will die from primary hepatocellular carcinoma or cirrhosis of the liver. At present there are only two approved therapies for the treatment of HBV infection, a-interferon and lamivudine. The limited efficacy of a-interferon and the emergence of lamivudine-resistant HBV variants have made it clear that additional therapies are needed for the treatment of acute and chronic HBV infection. These new therapies will include combination regimens analogous to those used to treat HIV infections. F Figure 1 . Structure of emtricitabine (524W91, FTC) [6] . The oxathiolane ring, which is an analog of a 2',3'-dideoxyribose ring, has the L configuration at what corresponds to the 4' position (*). This is in contrast to naturally occurring nucleosides, which have a D configuration at this position. Clinical studies have demonstrated the drug to be very effective in suppressing both HIV and HBV in infected patients. In this report we will present an overview of the prechnical and clinical studies conducted to date on emtricitabine and when possible critique differences between emtricitabine and other nucleoside analogs currently approved for the treatment of HIV and HBV disease. Particular attention will be paid to comparing the antiviral activity of emtricitabine to that of lamivudine and differentiating the activities of the two compounds based on the introduction of fluorine into the C-5 position of emtricitabine.",

The results are summarized in Table 1 . A comparison of the in vitro potency of emtricitabine to that of the other nucleoside analogues currently used to treat HIV is difficult owing to the wide variety of cell types, virus strains and assay conditions used by the numerous investigators who have determined EC^Q values for these compounds. However, if EC^Q data derived from PBMCs infected with the LAI, LAV or Illg strain of HIV-1 are used as the basis of comparison, emtricitabine and the nucleoside analogues currently approved for human use can be divided into three potency groups. The most potent group includes emtricitabine and AZT, with ECg^ value ranges of 0.001 to 0.01 |JM and 0.001 to 0.058 loM, respectively.

The results are summarized in Table 2 . Although different laboratory strains of virus, different cell types and different assay methods were used by the investigators in these studies, emtricitabine consistently showed greater activity than lamivudine with the activity advantage ranging from three-to 11-fold. The sensitivity of HIV-1 clinical isolates to inhibition by anti-HIV drugs is assessed in vitro to gain insight into the variation in activity that might be encountered in a clinical setting. The results of one such study conducted with emtricitabine in human PBMCs are presented in Table 3 . Schinazi et al. tested two low passage clinical isolates; J6 and 2:DR2, in phytohemagglutinin-stimulated PBMCs isolated from uninfected donors [8] . The EC^Q values are similar to those calculated using laboratory strains of virus in PBMCs. The sensitivities to emtricitabine reported for two additional wild type clinical isolates, WT-pre-AZT (obtained from D. Richman, Veterans Affairs Medical Center, San Diego, CA) and WT-MKC09-day 29 (obtained from a Phase I Emivirine trial. Triangle Pharmaceuticals, Inc.), were similar to those determined by Schinazi et al. against J6 and 2:DR2. In the single experiment in which a direct comparison was made between the activity of emtricitabine and lamivudine, emtricitabine demonstrated the same fivefold potency advantage seen using laboratory strains of virus.",

In this study, PBMCs from HIV-infected patients were cocultured with PBMCs isolated from uninfected donors. The naturally infected PBMCs served as a source of a diversified population of virus not selected for by in vitro propagation. At the end of the coculture period, the degree of viral replication was measured by HIV-1 p24 ELISA. Results from this study expressed as mean EC^^, EC^^, and EC^^ values are given in Table 4 . A potency ranking (based on EC^Q values) showed emtricitabine to be the most potent compound, followed by zalcitabine, lamivudine, zidovudine, TIBO, and didanosine. The low potency ranking for zidovudine compared to that observed in laboratory strains may be the result of inclusion of PMBCs from AZT-experienced patents in the coculture. [12] To determine if the antiviral activity of emtricitabine varied in different subtypes of HIV-1, activity was evaluated against HIV-1 group M and group O in MAGI-CCR5 cells and PBMCs. Table 5 shows the results. EC^Q values were also obtained for lamivudine, zidovudine, and didanosine. Emtricitabine was more active than lamivudine and didanosine, and had activity comparable to that of zidovudine. ",

A time course showed that the nucleotides of emtricitabine were formed rapidly and reached a steady-state intracellular concentration by three to six hours [20] . The concentration of emtricitabine 5'-diphosphate was somewhat higher than the concentration of the 5'-mono and 5'-triphosphate derivatives [7, 14, 20, 21] , as shown in Figure 2 . When the intracellular concentrations of the phosphorylated forms were measured as a function of the extracellular concentration (concentrations ranged from 0.01 to 10 JLIM), the concentration of the 5'-phosphorylated derivatives of emtricitabine increased in a dose-dependent manner, indicating that the anabolic pathway was not saturated at the concentrations tested ( Figure 2 ). An intracellular half-life of approximately 2.4 hours was determined for emtricitabine 5'-triphosphate in HepG2 cells [20] . This half-life is extremely short compared to the estimated 30 hours half-life seen in PBMCs taken from healthy human volunteers dosed orally with 200 mg emtricitabine QD [22] . In studies to determine which enzymes were responsible for phosphorylating emtricitabine to the 5'-triphosphate, 2'-deoxycytidine kinase was identified as the enzyme that catalyzes the phosphorylation of emtricitabine to the corresponding 5'-monophosphate [14, 21, 23] . Using calf thymus 2'-deoxycytidine kinase, the relative [20] . In this experiment HepG2 2.2.15 cells were incubated with emtricitabine for 24 hours. rate of phosphorylation was 3.4% of that measured for 2'-deoxyguanosine and 40% of that observed for 2'-deoxycytidine. Shewach et al. demonstrated emtricitabine to be a good substrate for human deoxycytidine kinase [23] . An apparent K^ value of 11.8 |aM and an apparent relative V^^^ of 9.3 nmol-mL'^hr\"^ was determined when UTP was the phosphate donor. When ATP was the phosphate donor, an apparent K^ value of 7.4 |iM and an apparent relative V^^^ of 3.8 nmol-mL'^hr^ was obtained. Phosphorylation of the 5'-monophosphate was catalyzed by 2'-deoxycytidine monophosphate kinase [14, 21] . The efficiency with which the enzyme, purified from calf thymus, phosphorylates the 5'-monophosphate of emtricitabine was approximately 32% of that observed when using the natural substrate, 2'-deoxycytidine 5'-monophosphate. Emtricitabine 5'-monophosphate can also be phosphorylated by nucleoside monophosphate kinase purified from beef liver. However, the phosphorylation catalyzed by this enzyme is relatively inefficient. The formation of the 5'-triphosphate of emtricitabine from the 5'-diphosphate has been proposed to be catalyzed by nucleoside diphosphate kinase (NDP) [14] , a cytosolic enzyme with a broad specificity for nucleoside 5'-diphosphates. However, Cheng et al. have recently suggested that the L-nucleotide 5'-diphosphates cannot be utilized as a substrate by NDP kinases but are selectively phosphorylated by 3-phosphoglyceride kinase. [24] Inhibition of HIV-1 reverse transcriptase by the 5'-triphosphate of emtricitabine Human immunodeficiency vims encodes a reverse transcriptase (HIV-RT) that synthesizes a double-stranded DNA copy of genomic RNA. Emtricitabine 5'-triphosphate serves as an alternative substrate inhibitor of HIY-RT and is incorporated into a growing chain of viral DNA. Incorporation results in the termination of nascent chain DNA synthesis due to the lack of a hydroxy 1 group in the 3'-position of the sugar moiety of emtricitabine, which in turn results in inhibition of viral replication.",

            "text": "Although a steady state kinetic analysis represents a useful beginning, it is insufficient to establish a detailed kinetic and mechanistic picture of the enzyme-catalyzed reaction [25] . A pre-steady-state kinetic analysis can provide a detailed picture of the events that occur at the enzyme active site. This includes binding of the nucleotide substrate to the enzyme-DNA complex to form an initial ternary complex (Kj^), the maximum rate of incorporation of the single nucleotide 5'-monophosphate (k ,), and the overall efficiency of incorporation, which is defined as the quotient k ^/K^. Using rapid quench techniques to carry out a pre-steady-state analysis, Feng et al. compared the pre-steadystate kinetics of single nucleotide incorporation of dCTP, lamivudine 5'-triphosphate and emtricitabine 5'-triphosphate opposite a template guanosine in RNA-dependent DNA synthesis with HIV-1 RT [26] . The results are shown in Table 8 . The overall incorporation rate of the oxathiolane nucleoside analogs is significantly slower than that observed for the natural substrate dCTP, as evidenced by the values of k j. The k J value of dCTP ranges from 280 to 700 times greater than the corresponding k J values for the oxathiolane nucleoside analogues. However, the K^ values reveal that the oxathiolane substrates bind much tighter to the enzyme-DNA complex than does the natural substrate, with the K^ values of the analogues being approximately six-to 30-fold lower than those of the natural substrate. Both the K^ and k j values reveal emtricitabine 5'-triphosphate to be a better overall substrate for the enzyme than is lamivudine 5'-triphosphate. The result of the k ^^ and K^ advantage is increased efficiency for emtricitabine 5'-triphosphate relative to lamivudine 5'-triphosphate. Emtricitabine 5'-triphosphate is incorporated almost an order of magnitude more efficiently than is lamivudine 5'-triphosphate during RNA-dependent DNA synthesis. This efficiency advantage can account in part for the higher activity seen for emtricitabine compared to lamivudine in cell culture ( Table 2) .",

Therefore the potential for emtricitabine 5'-triphosphate and lamivudine 5'-triphosphate to serve as substrates for Pol y was investigated (J. Feng, personal communication. Triangle Pharmaceuticals). For dCTP, emtricitabine 5'-triphosphate, and lamivudine 5'-triphosphate, the order of incorporation efficiency is dCTP > lamivudine 5'-triphosphate > emtricitabine 5'-triphosphate.

Both emtricitabine and lamivudine were well tolerated during the seven days of the study with no evident toxicity.

DNA sequence analysis showed a change at codon 184, with methionine replaced by valine. Based on synergy data with zidovudine and the lack of cross-resistance, the authors suggested that combination of the oxathiolane analogues with zidovudine might slow the emergence of resistance to emtricitabine and/or lamivudine. Indeed, passaging virus in the presence of increasing concentrations of emtricitabine and 50 nM zidovudine was able to delay appreciably, but not prevent, the emergence of emtricitabine-resistant virus [11] .",

            "text": "Treatment of HEV-infected patients with lamivudine has been shown to be effective in suppressing virus replication and in reducing inflammatory activity. However, resistance to this agent has been documented that is associated with mutations in the YMDD motif in domain C of the viral DNA polymerase, analogous to changes seen in the YMDD motif of HIV-RT. Methionine 204 [39] had mutated to either isoleucine (M204I) or valine (M204V). The M204V mutation is almost always observed in conjunction with an additional mutation, L180M in the B domain. Because of the sequence homology between the active sites of HIV RT and the HBV DNA polymerase [29] , the importance of the YMDD motif to the catalytic activity of both polymerases, and the role of the methionine in the resistance of HIV-1 to lamivudine and emtricitabine, it would be anticipated that HBV containing either the M204I or the M204V mutation is crossresistant to emtricitabine. Inhibition assays performed using Hep ADS 8 and HepAD79 cells, which replicate wild type and the M204V mutant HBV, respectively [40, 41] , confirmed that the methionine-to-valine mutation conferred resistance to emtricitabine as well as to lamivudine. EC^^ values for lamivudine and emtricitabine versus wild type and mutant HBV were 0.09 and 1.3 |iM, and 0.04 and 1.25 [oM, respectively. Interestingly, introduction of the M204V mutation into the HBV polymerase did not impart the same degree of resistance to emtricitabine or lamivudine seen upon introduction of the Ml84V mutation into the HIV polymerase. Zoulim et al. (personal communication from F. Zoulim, INSERM, France) using a duck (DHBV) polymerase assay reported that mutations conferring resistance to lamivudine showed cross-resistance to emtricitabine. In their studies, mutations were made in the DHBV DNA polymerase at M204 and LI80 that correspond to the M204 and the L180 mutations in HBV. The inhibitory activity of the 5'-triphosphates of lamivudine and emtricitabine was compared against wild type and mutant polymerases using enzyme expressed in a coupled transcription/translation rabbit reticulocyte lysate system. Both lamivudine 5'-triphosphate and emtricitabine 5'-triphosphate were inhibitors of viral minus-strand DNA synthesis, with IC^Q values of 6.1 \u00b1 3.5 ILIM and 8.5 \u00b1 4.1 | LiM, respectively. When tested against the M204V-, M204I-, and M204V -I-L180M-containing mutants, the IC^Q values for lamivudine 5'-triphosphate and emtricitabine 5'-triphosphate increased markedly (>100 ILLM). In cell culture assays using LMH cells transiently transfected with DHBV genomes containing mutations M204V, M204I, or M204V + L180M, neither lamivudine nor emtricitabine showed any antiviral activity.",

This depletion could account for toxicities observed in the clinic.

Jeffrey, personal communication. Triangle Pharmaceuticals). Under these conditions, emtricitabine had no adverse effects on cell growth, mitochondrial DNA synthesis or lactic acid production.

Protocol FTC-101 was an open-label, sequential, dose-ranging trial evaluating the in vivo antiviral activity of emtricitabine in HIV-infected patients given 14 days of monotherapy at 25 mg BID, 100 mg QD, 100 mg BID, 200 mg QD, and 200 mg BID. A total of 41 patients (N = 8 or 9 per dose group) naive to lamivudine and abacavir were enrolled. At screening, CD4\"^ cell count ranged from 198 to 1071 cells/mm^ and plasma HIV-1 RNA ranged from 3.9 to 5.9 log^Q copies/mL. Plasma HIV-1 RNA was measured at baseline and frequently over the 14 days of treatment. The pharmacokinetics of emtricitabine in plasma and emtricitabine 5'-triphosphate levels in PBMCs were also evaluated.Potent antiretroviral activity occurred in all dosage cohorts, with a strong trend towards greater activity at the higher doses (Figure 5). Viral suppression in the 200 mg QD group was comparable to that observed in the 200 mg BID group. The 200 mg QD dose group showed a median drop from baseline at day 15 of 1.9 logj^, as compared to 1.3, 1.5, 1.7, and 1.9 log^^ for the 25 mg BID, 100 mg QD, 100 mg BID, and 200 mg BID dose groups, respectively. The onset of anti-HIV activity occurred within 48 hours of initiating emtricitabine dosing with the most rapid viral load decline occurring between days 3 and 8. Results of statistical analyses of HIV-1 RNA AAUCMB (average area under the curve minus baseline), change from baseline at day 15 (last day on study treatment), and maximum change from baseline, consistently supported the dose-response relationship and the maximal antiviral effect at the 200 mg QD and 200 mg BID doses.Protocol FTC-102 was an open-label, randomized, parallel-group monotherapy trial comparing three once-daily dosage regimens of emtricitabine (25 mg, 100 mg and 200 mg QD) and the approved lamivudine regimen (150 mg BID) during 10 days of monotherapy. A total of 81 patients, naive to lamivudine and abacavir, were randomized to one of the four treatment regimens. At screening, median CD4\"^ cell count ranged from 350 to 431 cells/mm^ and median plasma HIV-1 RNA ranged from 4.3 to 4.7 log^^ copies/mL.

An overview of each study is given below.FTC-201: A Pilot Study Evaluating the Efficacy and Tolerance of the CombinationEmtricitabine + ddl + efavirenz Administered Once Daily in the Treatment of HIV-1-Infectedy Antiretroviral-Ndive Patients (ANRS091-Montana Study). Phase II study is being conducted by the ANRS (Agence Nationale de la Recherche sur le SID A, Paris France) to evaluate a once-daily regimen of FTC + ddl + efavirenz. To date, 34 of 40 treatment-naive patients have completed 96 weeks. Results demonstrate durable antiviral and immunologic effects lasting for the 96-week period using a fully once-a-day regimen. Using a non-completer-equals-failure analysis at 96 weeks, 85% and 80% of patients maintained a plasma HIV RNA level below 400 and 50 copies/mL, respectively. There was a median CD4\"^ cell count rise of 259 cells/|aL at week 96. Overall, the regimen has been well tolerated. The most common treatmentrelated adverse events occurred during the first 24 weeks of the study, and were mild to moderate in severity.FTC-303: A Randomized, Open-Label Equivalence Study of Emtricitabine Versus Lamivudine in Patients on a Stable Triple Antiretroviral Therapy Regimen Containing Lamivudine Plus Stavudine or Zidovudine, and a Protease Inhibitor or a Non-Nucleoside Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitor.Study FTC-303 was a randomized(2:1), open-label, 48-week equivalence study of FTC vs. 3TC in 440 patients on a stable (HIV RNA < 400 copies/mL) triple therapy regimen (>12 weeks) containing 3TC. Patients were randomized to continue 3TC or switch to FTC by screening viral load (<50 and >50-400 copies/mL) and by the presence of a protease inhibitor or non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor in their regimens. At entry, the treatment groups were comparable with regard to race, gender, age, and baseline disease. Patients had a mean age of 41.5 (range 22-80) years, 64% were Caucasian, and 86% male. Median baseline CD4\"^ cell count was 488 (range cells/mm^ and median plasma HIV-1 RNA was 50 copies/mL. The median duration of previous antiretroviral therapy was 28 months.",
