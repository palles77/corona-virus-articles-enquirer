This modification generates an N-terminal threonine nucleophile that is used to hydrolyze the pantetheinyl moiety of its natural substrate. We determined the crystal structure of autoactivated ThnT to 1.8 \u00c5 through X-ray crystallography. Comparison to a mutationally inactivated precursor structure revealed several large conformational rearrangements near the active site. To probe the relevance of these transitions, we designed a pantetheine-like chloromethyl ketone (CMK) inactivator and cocrystallized it with ThnT. Although this class of inhibitor has been in use for several decades, the mode of inactivation had not been determined for an enzyme that uses an N-terminal nucleophile. The co-crystal structure revealed the CMK bound to the N-terminal nucleophile of ThnT through an ether linkage and analysis suggests inactivation through a direct displacement mechanism. More importantly, this inactivated complex shows three regions of ThnT that are critical to the formation of the substrate binding pocket undergo rearrangement upon autoproteolysis.",

This post-translational modification is involved in the regulation of protein folding 1 , cell signaling 2 , nucleoporin biogenesis 3 , apoptosis 4 , and the function of many enzymes [5] [6] [7] . These studies have established that self-cleavage proceeds through an N-O(S) acyl shift mechanism: an active-site nucleophile (Thr, Ser or Cys) attacks into its N-terminal peptide bond generating a (thia)oxazolidine intermediate (Fig. 1a) . 8 This transient species collapses to a (thio)ester, which is subsequently hydrolyzed to yield two subunits bearing new N-and C-termini. The N-terminal nucleophile (Ntn) generated by autoproteolysis is used by enzymes, such as the Thr-utilizing proteasome \u03b2-subunit (P\u03b2S), 9 in a catalytic diad (or triad) for catalysis. It was originally believed that all Ntn-utilizing enzymes belonged to the same superfamily (dubbed the Ntn-superfamily). 5, 10 However, subsequent research showed a second group of enzymes exists (the D/O-superfamily), which is related to the Ntn-superfamily through convergent evolution. 11 Together, these enzymes perform a diverse array of hydrolysis and acyl transfer reactions.",

Consequently, a comparison between the functional active site before and after autoactivation is possible for only two systems, glycosylasparaginase 14, 15 (GA) and P\u03b2S. 9, 16 This lack of mechanistically relevant structural information constitutes a fundamental gap in our understanding of how a single protein sequence is optimized to facilitate both autoproteolysis and enzymatic catalysis in its mature form. Because cephalosporin acylase (CA) and penicillin acylase (PA), both members of the Ntnsuperfamily, are currently the subject of directed evolution experiments to improve the industrial production of \u03b2-lactam antibiotics, 17, 18 further insights may provide valuable lessons in the development of enzymes with improved activity. Addressing this problem will rely on the ability to compare and contrast structural changes upon autoactivation for both the Ntn and D/O superfamilies. To this end, we sought to extend our analysis of ThnT by determining the mature structure of the enzyme and elucidating the features necessary for substrate binding and catalysis.",

Wild-type ThnT crystallized under similar conditions and in the same space group as the mutationally inactive precursor ThnT T282C. Diffraction to high resolution and phasing by molecular replacement yielded the 1.8-\u00c5 crystal structure of wild-type ThnT. For clarity, all residues of ThnT referenced hereafter will be numbered according to their position in the precursor protein. Autoproteolysis generates two subunits, \u03b1 and \u03b2, comprised of residues 1-281 and 282-399, respectively. Like most structurally characterized Ntn enzymes, the subunits of ThnT remain intimately intertwined after activation with global features comparable to their uncleaved forms (Fig. 2a) . 11, 19 The N-6His tag and the first 23 residues of the \u03b1 subunit were not observed, as was the case for the T282C structure. A short linker sequence leading into the scissile bond of the pro-enzyme, residues 274-281, showed few tertiary interactions and modeled with very high average B-factors (41.4 \u00c5 2 ). 13 These disordered residues comprise the C-terminus of the \u03b1 subunit and, as we anticipated, they are not observed in the structure of mature ThnT. Interestingly, comparable disorder in precursor proteins and nascent C-termini has been found in many autoproteolytic systems. 14, 20 This observation is readily explained as a strategy employed to promote dissociation of the C-terminus, which must occur to expose the active site of the mature enzyme.",

Comparable strain was observed at this position in the pro-enzyme inactive state and we hypothesized this destabilization was used to help drive formation of the reactive conformation. 13 Hence, it appears retention of this unfavorable geometry is a consequence of the selection for an active site that can promote two different chemical reactions. The energetic penalty of straining this bond may be offset by the hydrogen bond between the carbonyl of Thr282 and the amide nitrogen of Asn217, which would be disrupted upon relaxation of the \u03c9 angle. The amide proton of Phe144 and \u03b4NH 2 of Asn217 comprise the oxyanion hole of ThnT for autoactivation 13 .

This dramatic structural rearrangement is promoted electrostatically by reorienting the carbonyl of Arg74 away from Asp321 and positioning it 1.4 \u00c5 closer to the side chain of Lys300.

These residues correctly orient the nitrogen lone pair to accept a proton from the nucleophile (Fig. 2b) .

Hence, it is now possible to distinguish between system-specific and general features of their active sites. The catalytic activity of P\u03b2S relies on a hydrogen bond network very similar to that shown in Fig. 2b . However, the active site of each protein is formed from different parts of their topologically distinct folds (Fig. 4) , reinforcing their relationship through convergent evolution. Consequently, it appears this hydrogen bond network represents an optimal balance between facile autoactivation and substrate catalysis. We recently reported that the Thr \u03b3-methyl may accelerate the intramolecular cyclization that occurs during the N-O acyl shift in autoproteolysis. 13 This phenomenon is known as the Reactive Rotamer Effect (RRE) 24 and a similar effect may apply to any reaction for which the rotamer distribution may be shifted to favor the reactive state by the addition of steric bulk. This is precisely the case for ThnT and P\u03b2S, where the inactive g+ rotamer is structurally viable for both Thr and Ser, but is destabilized by Thr because the \u03b3-methyl shields a hydrogen bond with Gly322 (in ThnT) or Lys33 (in P\u03b2S). 9 Similarly, the g+ rotamer cannot be formed for the ornithine acyltransferases (members of the D/O superfamily) because it would cause a strong 1.7-\u00c5 steric clash with the Thr111 in the oxyanion hole. 25 Hence, comparison of ThnT with P\u03b2S and other Ntn enzymes reveals unique features of each active site that promote formation of a reactive state. Combined with the role of the RRE in autoproteolysis, we believe these effects strongly and specifically contribute to the selection of Thr nucleophiles in autoproteolytic systems.",

This raised the possibility that a secondary cleavage, similar to that observed for CA, 26 might also occur for ThnT. The slow timescale of the apparent hydrolysis, however, suggested the phenomenon could be due to a contaminating protease. Although inclusion of protease inhibitors failed to prevent this cleavage, N-terminal sequencing showed that hydrolysis occurred two residues prior to the first observed residue in the crystal structure.

Because ThnT and P\u03b2S have similar active site geometry, we hypothesize this mode of inactivation is common between them.",

Comparison with the wild-type structure shows the \u03c8 angle of Thr282 has rotated 10\u00b0 such that the derivatized side chain is deflected away from the oxyanion hole. Additional rotation of the \u03c8 angle would provide space to allow the \u03b3O-bearing bond angles to relax. However, the system appears to have settled in an energetic minimum that maintains the hydrogen bond between Gly322 and Thr282 \u03b3OH.

For the Ser proteases, the nucleophile attacks into the carbonyl forming an oxyanion that displaces the adjacent halide forming an oxirane intermediate. This 3-membered ring is subsequently opened by attack of the His residue of the catalytic triad, resulting in a second covalent attachment. 30 Were a comparable mechanism involving an oxirane to occur in the inactivation of ThnT, its formation would obey the well-known stereoelectronic requirement that attack of the oxyanion into C' proceed anti-periplanar to the chloride leaving group (Fig.  6b) . The location of the oxyanion is well-defined by the location of the oxyanion hole of ThnT. Modeling this species shows that placement of the chloride anti-periplanar to the oxyanion results in a strong steric clash with Ser320 and the carboxylate of Asp321. Because this geometry is intrinsic to oxirane formation, and the ThnT active site harbors features that would significantly impede expulsion of the chloride, we do not believe inactivation of ThnT occurs through an oxirane intermediate. Instead, the ether linkage reported here is most similar to the thioether formed upon derivatization of the cysteine proteases papain, 31 SARS-CoV peptidase 32, 33 and HAV 3C. 28 For the latter two enzymes, an episulfonium species was also trapped, presumably as an intermediate of the inhibition process. A comparable mechanism for ThnT would involve a highly unstable oxonium species that is unlikely to occur (Figure 6c ). Together, these constraints suggest the mechanism of HMK inhibition in ThnT is distinct from those reported for the serine and cysteine proteases.",

Formation of the Michaelis complex places the carbonyl of the scissile amide into the oxyanion hole (Fig. 7) . The majority of the enzyme-substrate interactions are in the pantothenate binding region defined by the ThnT-inhibitor structure (Fig. 5b) , consistent the capacity of ThnT to efficiently hydrolyze a variety of pantetheinylated compounds. 12 The cysteamine moiety of the substrate provides the ideal distance for the carboxylate of thienamycin to form a salt bridge with Arg148. The catalytic nucleophile is centered within the active site and its exposure to solvent is minimized by Phe144 and Phe348 from the opposite subunit. Like other N-terminal amidohydrolases 5, 37 , the \u03b1-amine deprotonates the hydroxyl of Thr282 to generate a reactive nucleophile. Attack into the substrate generates a tetrahedral intermediate whose collapse is concurrent with protonation of the amine leaving group. Studies have shown that amidohydrolases often provide a hydrogen bond acceptor to facilitate inversion of the nitrogen 38 , and we hypothesize Ser320 may satisfy this role for ThnT ( Figure S2) . Expulsion of the amino leaving group generates thienamycin and an acyl enzyme intermediate. A water molecule in a position similar to Wat1 or Wat2 ( Figure 2B ) is then activated by the \u03b1-amine, which hydrolyzes the acyl enzyme intermediate, regenerating the ThnT active site.",

In all systems, dissociation of the nascent C-terminus after autoproteolysis is favored by a lack of tertiary contacts. When autoproteolysis is initiated through a si-face attack, the same oxyanion hole is used for both self-cleavage and substrate catalysis. Within the active site, the Thr \u03b3-methyl facilitates this chemistry by directing the nucleophile into a reactive state. Lastly, we identified large structural rearrangements necessary for the formation of the ThnT substrate binding pocket. Although P\u03b2S is \"insignificantly different\" 16 before and after autoproteolysis, most other enzymes from the Ntn-superfamily, including penicillin acylase 39 , cephalosporin acylase 40 , and \u03b3-glutamyl transpeptidase 20 show evidence of a unique conformational rearrangement. These enzymes each contain a high degree of similarity with the ThnT pro-enzyme active site, but are structurally divergent after autoproteolysis. We propose this is evidence of a more general phenomenon. Autoprocessing systems with shared chemistry, regardless of lineage, will have comparable features prior to autoprocessing that may dissipate as each protein rearranges to its unique mature state. The observation that two markedly different conformations of the Arg74-Thr80 loop of ThnT (Figure 3b ) facilitate each of the hydrolytic chemistries highlights the orchestrated complexity of the structure-function relationship in autoproteolytic enzymes. Not only does sequence encode for an intrinsically reactive folded state but, as we have shown here for ThnT, the downstream consequences of this selfcleavage result in spontaneous reorganization to the catalytically competent state of the mature enzyme.",

Crystals grew overnight and were cryoprotected by immersion into 20% PEG3350, 0.7 M sodium acetate and 20% glycerol prior to flash-freezing in N 2 . Crystallization and data collection for ThnT were carried out at X6A at the National Synchrotron Light Source.

Both structures were solved by molecular replacement using the PHASER program 41 , as implemented in the CCP4 package 42 .

The carbapenem substrate and covalent intermediates were generated with the structure drawing functionality of DS 2.1 and manually docked in the active site of ThnT. Generally, the system was typed with the CHARMM force field and minimized using an adopted basis NR algorithm. 46 Crystallographic waters were explicitly included in all minimizations. Attempts to position the substrate or inhibitor in an orientation substantially different from the observed conformation (e.g. placing the chlorine atom inside the oxyanion hole), resulted in significant active site distortion. All rotamers of the CMK C'-Cl bond were independently minimized before and after oxyanion formation to assess the capacity of ThnT to accommodate reactive intermediates. All hydrogen bonding interactions defined by the inhibitor-bound structure were constrained to \u00b1 0.2 \u00c5 of their measured values. The algorithm exited after achieving a root-mean-squared gradient of < 0.1 kcal/(mol \u00c5). All other settings were default.",

The nucleophile is labeled T1. b) The global fold of ThnT arose from a gene duplication event, as evidenced by the identical connectivity of the central \u03b1\u03b2\u03b2\u03b1 unit (colored) characteristic of the D/Osuperfamily of autoproteolytic enzymes. 11 The nucleophile, T282, is adjacent to a parallel \u03b2strand and the oxyanion hole element F144 is on a geometrically identical region of the protein as G47 of P\u03b2S, whereas N217 is located closer to the nucleophile in the primary sequence. Non-conserved structural motifs are colored white. Image generated with TopDraw. 47 Model of the ThnT Michaelis-complex with a pantetheinylated carbapenem. This model shows that the substrate binding cavity is well-suited to accommodate a carbapenem substrate and that a positively charged residue, R148, is positioned to form a salt bridge with the carboxylate moiety of the substrate.

(a) Abstraction of a proton by a general base (B:) initiates cis-autoproteolysis with Thr (X=O, Y=CH 3 ), Ser (X=O, Y=H) or Cys (X=S, Y=H) nucleophile. The activated residue attacks into its N-terminal amide bond, resulting in a (thia)oxazolidine ring that collapses to a (thio)ester with concomitant protonation of the amine leaving group by a general acid (AH). The \u03b1-amine activates a water molecule for hydrolysis of the (thio)ester, creating a new N-terminal residue. (b)Mechanism of ThnT hydrolysis of a pantetheinylated carbapenem. The N-terminal amine acts as a general base to activate the nucleophile for attack into the carbonyl of the pantetheine sidechain. The \u03b1-ammonium donates a proton back to the amine leaving group, generating an acyl-enzyme intermediate. In a manner directly comparable to autoactivation, the \u03b1-amine again activates a water molecule to hydrolyze the substrate from the enzyme, returning it to its resting state. This hydrolytic chemistry is standard among Ntn-utilizing enzymes.",

(b) Residues Phe144 and Asn217 from the \u03b1 subunit form the oxyanion hole of ThnT and the three residues D321, G322, and D323 are positioned to activate the \u03b3OH of Thr282, allowing for its role as the catalytic nucleophile. The position of a bound glycerol molecule suggests an orientation for the pantetheine moiety of the substrate.

(b) Isomerization of the G76-P77 peptide bond from cis (pro-enzyme state) to trans (mature state) is accompanied by reorganization of the entire R74-T80 loop.

(c) The loop harboring S320-D321 was observed in two conformations in one subunit of the uncleaved protein. This converts to a single observable conformation after autoproteolysis.

This parallels the accepted mechanism of inhibition for traditional Ser proteases, where the imidazole side chain of the catalytic triad subsequently attacks C' forming a second covalent bond to the inhibitor. Both formation of the oxirane and its collapse to an ether are unlikely to occur within the ThnT active site. (c) After formation of the oxyanion intermediate, a second nucleophilic attack occurs, as has been proposed for thioether formation in Cys proteases.
