Modeling the reporting delay distribution is a common feature of nowcast approaches. However, many nowcast approaches ignore a crucial feature of infectious disease transmission-that future cases are intrinsically linked to past reported cases-and are optimized to a single application, which may limit generalizability. Here, we present a Bayesian approach, NobBS (Nowcasting by Bayesian Smoothing) capable of producing smooth and accurate nowcasts in multiple disease settings. We test NobBS on dengue in Puerto Rico and influenza-like illness (ILI) in the United States to examine performance and robustness across settings exhibiting a range of common reporting delay characteristics (from stable to timevarying), and compare this approach with a published nowcasting package. We show that introducing a temporal relationship between cases considerably improves performance when the reporting delay distribution is time-varying, and we identify trade-offs in the role of moving windows to accurately capture changes in the delay. We present software implementing this new approach (R package \"NobBS\") for widespread application.",

Multiple features of the disease and surveillance system contribute to reporting delays, including: delays in symptoms onset after infection; delays in medical care-seeking after onset; delays in providers obtaining and reporting diagnostic information; level of awareness of disease activity influencing care-seeking and reporting; and system-level processing delays, a result of complex and multi-tiered disease reporting and communication systems interacting at multiple administrative levels (3) . Reporting delays can be further exacerbated in resource-constrained settings.

            "text": "Nowcasting, or \"predicting the present,\" is an approach to mitigate the impact of reporting delays. With origins in the insurance claims and actuarial literature (4, 5) , nowcast models aim to estimate the number of occurred-but-not-yet-reported events (e.g. insurance claims, disease cases) at any given time based on an incomplete set of reports. In public health settings, nowcasting approaches have been explored for AIDS in the 1980s and 1990s (6) (7) (8) as a consequence of the long incubation period from HIV infection until development of AIDS. More recently, nowcasting has been applied to infectious disease outbreaks such as foodborne illness outbreaks (9, 10) . These studies draw principally on survival analysis and actuarial techniques to model the reporting delay and draw inferences based on historical patterns. A majority of studies have strictly focused on modeling the reporting delay distribution-a legacy of the actuarial techniques giving rise to many of these approaches-and generally neglect a key feature of outbreaks: that future cases are intrinsically linked to past reported cases, a fact that creates potentially strong autocorrelation in the true number of cases over short time intervals. In other words, the infectious disease transmission process provides an additional signal of the number of cases to be expected in the near future that has not been included in common methods such as the reverse-time hazard model (11, 12) and the chain ladder method (13). However, proposals to extend the latter approach to state-space models that account for temporal relationships in reporting have existed in the literature since the development of these techniques(13-15) and have been applied in at least one infectious disease context (16) . These developments are promising for disease surveillance, but it is critical to demonstrate performance in a diversity of settings as infectious disease nowcast models to date have largely focused on specific applications, not the common challenges that exist across many different diseases. In this investigation, we find that nowcasting is especially challenging when the proportion of cases reported the week they occur (delay 0) is low and reporting delays are highly variable; we know of no investigations that specifically identify models that perform well in these commonly occurring circumstances. As a result, the characteristics of robust and broadlyapplicable models are difficult to identify. Additionally, several previous models have largely focused on providing point estimates of the number of cases. Point estimates may be helpful, but quantifying the uncertainty in those estimates is even more important in the context of infectious disease outbreaks because uncertainty is intrinsic, and accounting for plausible outcomes apart from the point prediction is critical.",

We demonstrate the robustness of this approach in two very different disease surveillance contexts and identify the conditions that favor its application, especially when the reporting delay distribution is time-varying. Specifically, NobBS allows for both uncertainty in the delay distribution and the time evolution of the epidemic curve, producing smooth, time-correlated estimates of cases. We demonstrate that NobBS performs well for weekly nowcasts of (1) dengue cases in Puerto Rico and (2) influenza-like illness (ILI) cases in the United States, requiring no disease-specific parameterization despite the two pathogens being very different (vector-borne vs. directly transmitted) and exhibiting substantially different reporting delays. Lastly, we test NobBS against a previous Bayesian nowcast method (9) and find that NobBS outperforms this benchmark for both diseases and multiple time periods. In particular, we show that while point estimates of the models are similar when time-to-report distributions are relatively fixed over time, NobBS improves the estimation of uncertainty and accommodates temporal variation in delay probabilities. We present an R package, \"NobBS,\" as a tool to complement both routine public health surveillance as well as forecasting efforts.",

            "text": "We developed a Bayesian approach to nowcast total case numbers using incomplete, timestamped reported case data based on an estimated delay distribution, intrinsic autocorrelation from the transmission process, and historical case data. Generally, the approach learns from historical information on cases reported at multiple delays (e.g. no delay, 1-week delay, 2-week delay, etc.) from the week of case onset to estimate the reporting delay probability at each delay and the relationship between case counts from week-to-week, and uses this relationship to predict the number of not-yet-reported cases in the present. We tested this approach, NobBS, using two different infectious disease surveillance data sources: dengue surveillance in Puerto Rico, and national notifications of influenza-like illness (ILI) in the United States. Using all of the available data on case reporting delays up to the point of prediction, weekly dengue nowcasts were estimated for the time period December 23, 1991 through November 29, 2010 (989 weeks), and weekly ILI nowcasts were produced over the period June 30, 2014 through September 25, 2017 (170 weeks). For comparison, we generated weekly nowcasts over the same periods using an existing Bayesian approach, here referred to as the benchmark approach (9). To leverage a large amount of historical data to fit the nowcast model while also having a large window over which to assess nowcasts, we used a 104-week (approximately 2-y) moving window dengue and a 27-week (approximately 6-mo) moving window for ILI. Our primary outcome metric to assess nowcast performance was the logarithmic score, a proper score that evaluates the probability assigned to the observed outcome rather than error associated with a point prediction. For purposes of discussion, we reported the exponentiated form of the mean logarithmic score (the geometric mean of the assigned probabilities) to provide a metric on the scale of 0 (no certainty of the outcome) to 1 (complete certainty of the outcome). In addition, we estimated other metrics describing the performance of point estimates (mean absolute error (MAE), root mean square error (RMSE), and relative root mean square error (rRMSE)) and the 95% prediction interval (PI) coverage, and of these, focus on comparing the rRMSE and 95% PI coverage across approaches.",

Table 1 summarizes the point and probability-based accuracy metrics for each, where higher accuracy is indicated by higher average scores, lower MAE, RMSE, and rRMSE, and lower distance from 0.95 for the 95% PI coverage. Because the NobBS model accounts for both under-reporting and the autocorrelated progression of transmission across successive weeks, it makes predictions even in weeks when there are no cases reported for the week. Conversely, the benchmark model does not make nowcasts for weeks in which there are no initial case reports (common in the dengue Puerto Rico data), hence the nowcasts in Figs. 1C and 2C appear as discontinuous lines. To compare models despite these differences, we report accuracy metrics between NobBS and the benchmark approach for both (1) the full time series of the data and (2) weeks when at least one case was reported in the first week, i.e. the subset of weeks for which both models could make predictions (Table 1) . We also computed error metrics for the benchmark model for the full time series by assigning point estimates of 0 cases for nowcasts in weeks without predictions. accuracy, as measured by the log score and the prediction error, are compared to (C) nowcasts by the benchmark approach with (D) corresponding log scores and prediction errors. For nowcasting, the number of newly-reported cases each week (blue line) are the only data available in real-time for that week, and help inform the estimate of the total number of cases that will be eventually reported (red line), shown with 95% prediction intervals (pink bands).

Overall, we observed that the accuracy of nowcast point estimates (rRMSE) was higher for the ILI data compared to dengue, which may be related to the high proportion of cases reported with 0-weeks delay in these data. Large weekly absolute changes in the number of initial case reports also appeared to be related to increased error, particularly for dengue, which had high fluctuations in the number of initial reports over time (Table S1 , Fig. S2 ).

However, analysis of the probability distributions of the nowcasts revealed a much more substantial difference; the average score for NobBS was approximately twice as high for dengue and more than 10 times as high for ILI cases (Table 1 ). This indicates that the NobBS approach assigned much higher probability to the actual outcome, even though point accuracy was somewhat lower for the ILI cases.",

This feature is critical in the context of infectious disease transmission, where the number of true infections in a given week mechanistically depends in part on the number of true infections in previous weeks due to the infectious process, whether the pathogen is transmitted directly or by vectors (18) . Hence, variations of autoregressive models are common in disease forecasting (19, 20) . When reporting delays are time-varying, as is often the case in epidemics (17), we show that the NobBS approach is less accurate compared to its performance in a stable delay distribution, but still shows improvement over the benchmark approach likely because the NobBS approach is informed by the number of cases experienced in previous weeks, not just the delay distribution, making it more robust to larger fluctuations.",

Two weeks in the dengue time series highlight this: August 3, 1998 and August 16, 2010. In those weeks, the number of cases initially increased by 16 and 17, respectively, from the previous week after 10 week with an average absolute change of 2.6 and 1.8 cases, respectively. Because this increase is an outlier in the distribution of reporting delays, in particular for delay d=0, the model substantially overestimated the true number of cases before correcting the following week. We observed that shorter moving windows either exacerbated this issue (e.g. in 2010) or produced a similar overestimate (e.g. in 1998) (Fig. S6 ), which appears to be a consequence of the volatility in estimating the variance of the random walk process, despite more accurate estimation of the reporting delay probability (Fig. S7) . While the smooth, autocorrelated relationship fit in the NobBS model helps reduce the effect of week-to-week variability in early reporting, it remains a challenge.

Shorter moving windows can improve estimation of the delay in the presence of changes, but explicitly estimating changes in that distribution may be explored for additional robustness in the presence of systemic changes in reporting. For example, authors in (21) propose a smooth estimate of the time-varying reporting delay distribution using p-spline smoothing. Specifying a time-specific change has also been proposed (9), but empirical identification of a change point in real-time may be challenging or impossible in the context of nowcasting. The challenge that remains in all described approaches is the ability of the model to pick up on changes in the delay distribution that occur quickly, in other words that may otherwise be smoothed out by splines and long moving windows.",

Predictive distributions were assigned to a series of bins categorized across possible values of true case counts. We used bin widths of 25 cases for dengue and 1000 cases for influenza, allowing for a larger number of bins for ILI cases based on case ranges of approx. 0-400 for dengue and 4,000-40,000 for ILI. For a predictive distribution with binned probability pi for a given nowcast target, the logarithmic score was calculated as ln(pi). For example, there were 115 cases eventually observed for the week of January 20, 1992. The NobBS nowcast for this week, which assigned a probability of 0.4 to the bin [100,125), thus received a log score of ln(0.4) = -0.92. As in (22, 23) , a very low log score of -10 was assigned for weeks in which the predictive distribution did not include the true case value, for weeks in which the bin probability \u2264 e -10 . This rule provides a lower limit (-10) to the score of highly inaccurate predictions.",

This probability was used to calculate the simulated number of cases that would be observed with d=0, out of the total number of cases that would be eventually observed for that week. The remaining cases were distributed to other delays ranging from 1-52 weeks using NB(0.9,0.4). This produced a rough approximation for a hypothetical scenario in which cases are reported faster (higher probability of d=0) during weeks with higher disease activity (more cases).
