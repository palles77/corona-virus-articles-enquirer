In Italy, the magnitude and increasing trend of the case-fatality risk (CFR) is fueling the already high levels of public alarm. In this paper, we highlight that the widely used crude CFR is an inaccurate measure of the disease severity since the pandemic is still unfolding. With the goal to improve its comparability over time and across countries at this stage, we then propose a demographic adjustment of the CFR that addresses the bias arising from differential case ascertainment by age.",

L'applicazione del nostro metodo ai dati nazionali italiani dimostra che, fino al 16 di Marzo, il tasso di fatalit\u00e0 rimane assimilabile a quello osservato nella regione di Wuhan, ma comincia a conoscere un drastico incremento negli ultimi giorni. I nostri risultati indicano che il metodo proposto migliora la comparabilit\u00e0 del tasso di fatalit\u00e0 nel tempo e tra paesi, dimostrando la sua utilit\u00e0 come strumento per tracciare e comprendere l'evoluzione pandemica attuale.",

Although often used interchangeably, these are two distinct concepts. COVID-19-related mortality indicates the proportion of individuals in the population who die from the disease. The severity of COVID-19 measures the risk of dying among infected individuals. Overall mortality is thus determined by the severity of the disease for the proportion of infected individuals in the population, and it will be higher if disease severity is elevated for a large share of the population. This is the reason why a demographic argument frequently cited is that the old age structure of the Italian population and extensive intergenerational contact between older and younger generations have made it more vulnerable to COVID-19-related mortality (3) .",

The combined effect of these two circumstances is that the number of positive individuals in each age group whom are exposed to the risk of COVID-19-related death differs at each point in time and across countries.

In this paper, we argue that this is the main bias to be addressed to improve the comparability of the CFR over time and across countries at this stage of the pandemic. We then propose a demographic adjustment that discounts the evolving age distribution of infected cases in the calculation of the CFR. Our results show that the adjusted CFR in Italy as of March 16 was significantly lower than the crude CFR, and in a range similar to that for the Chinese region of Wuhan. This indicates that the adjusted CFR we propose could be used as a standard indicator of COVID-19 severity for comparisons across countries and over time at this evolving stage of the pandemic.",

The initial outbreak that started on February 21 seems to slow down in the most severely affected northern region, but the outbreak in the central and southern region is picking up speed. As a result, our adjusted CFR has been increasing between March 16 and March 20. Additional sub-national data for cases and deaths by age are needed to better explore how local severity is contributing to the national CFR. As more data become available, it will be possible to test whether our results remain valid.",
