There are also several groups of organisms which accumulate vanadium, employing it in their biological processes. Vanadium being a biological relevant element, it is not surprising that many vanadium based therapeutic drugs have been proposed for the treatment of several types of diseases. Namely, vanadium compounds, in particular organic derivatives, have been proposed for the treatment of diabetes, of cancer and of diseases caused by parasites. In this work we review the medicinal applications proposed for vanadium compounds with particular emphasis on the more recent publications. In cells, partly due to the similarity of vanadate and phosphate, vanadium compounds activate numerous signaling pathways and transcription factors; this by itself potentiates application of vanadium-based therapeutics. Nevertheless, this non-specific bio-activity may also introduce several deleterious side effects as in addition, due to Fenton's type reactions or of the reaction with atmospheric O 2 , VCs may also generate reactive oxygen species, thereby introducing oxidative stress with consequences presently not well evaluated, particularly for long-term",

In this work we will make a review on medical applications of vanadium complexes, not trying to systematically cover all publications, but to make a more comprehensive text. The recent book edited by Michibata [20] includes chapters of 'Vanadium Effects on Bone Metabolism', 'Vanadium in Cancer Prevention', Cardiovascular Protection with Vanadium Compounds' and 'Inhalation Toxicity of Vanadium', thus these topics will only be shortly addressed.",

            "text": "Considering relative elemental abundance in our planet's crust, vanadium (0.019%) is the 18th element, thus not far from that of zinc (0.008%) [6] . It is ubiquitously distributed in soil, fossils (particularly in crude oil), water, air and living organisms. In sea water vanadium exists mainly in the form of H 2 VO 4 \u2212 and is the 2nd most abundant transition element, being about two orders of magnitude more abundant than iron [6] . The usual V concentrations in drinking water are in the 10 nM range, but groundwater from volcanic areas may contain much higher amounts, up to ca. 2.5 M [6] , and contamination is frequently observed in rivers, lakes and seas ( [11] and references therein). Many metal ions have a general tendency to interact with biomolecules, therefore, it is not surprising that natural evolution has incorporated many of them into performing a wide variety of tasks and playing crucial roles in living beings. Since nature has made such extensive use of metal ions, the questions: \"Can metal ions be incorporated into drugs? And can coordination chemistry be used with advantage for medicinal purposes?\" naturally arise and are the subject of Medicinal Inorganic Chemistry [7, 21] . Vanadium, being ubiquitously present in our planet's crust also found roles in biological systems, and this work focuses on the potential uses of vanadium-based therapeutic compounds in Medicine.",

The generation of a stable transition state between the vanadate and the enzyme has been considered the reason for its inhibitory effect to the enzyme activity. Studies by X-ray diffraction demonstrated that vanadate binds in the active site of the enzyme with trigonal bipyramid geometry.

Vanadium can stimulate the enzyme activity through the formation of complexes with ligands that resemble the structure of physiological substrates. For instance, the glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase is activated by vanadate. Another mechanism to regulate enzymatic activity is related to the enzymes activated or inhibited through the phosphorylation of tyrosine residues. Vanadate also forms esters with Tyr residues mimicking their phosphorylation process with a great impact in several biological events. The activation by vanadate of some cytosolic kinases and the insulin receptor (IR) has impact on the balance between phosphorylation-dephosphorylation processes. In vitro experiments with cells in culture show that VCs may cause or enhance insulin mimetic actions such as stimulation of protein phosphorylation in Tyr residues increasing the level of phosphoinositides, stimulate cell proliferation in different cell lines, promote the uptake of small molecules and ions, etc. On the contrary, vanadium compounds also can exhibit antitumor effects as well as toxic and transforming actions in different cell lines. Moreover, it is worthy to know that globally the underlying mechanisms of action of vanadium compounds are still poorly understood [14, [42] [43] [44] [45] [46] .",

It has been previously reported that VO(acac) 2 , VO(maltolato) 2 and NaVO 3 , attenuated basal lipolysis in 3T3L1 adipocytes assessed by glycerol release as a marker of lipolysis [47] . Though both Akt and ERK pathways are activated by the VCs, but only Akt activation by these three vanadium compounds plays a role in their antilipolytic effect. On the other hand, VO(acac) 2 can block cell cycle progression at the G1/S phase via a highly activated ERK signal pathway in human hepatoma HepG2 cells. The results indicated that similar activated pathways may lead to differential biological consequences for cancer cells and adipocytes, indicating that VCs may be used in the prevention and treatment of both diabetes and cancer. The action of insulin depends on its binding to the hormone receptor and its activation. Then the transduction of the signal involves a series of protein kinases such as MAPK and S6 kinases, as well as lipid kinases such as PI3-K. The insulin mimetic effects of vanadium may be caused by the stimulation of the autophosphorylation of the insulin receptor but in different manner than the hormone [48] [49] [50] [51] [52] [53] . These effects depend on the tissue and the animal species. For instance, in rat lung cells and rabbit and mouse diaphragm cells vanadium did not cause autophosphorylation of insulin receptor [54, 55] . On the other hand, the inhibition of tyrosine kinase activity of insulin receptor by vanadate did not suppress the effects of vanadate on glucose metabolism, suggesting a post-receptor action [52] . VCs that show insulin-like effects, stimulate kinases of the signal transduction pathways used by insulin beyond IR and IRS-1such as MAPKs and PI3K.",

In partially pancreatectomized rats [88] vanadium administration reversed insulin resistance by restoration of muscle glycogen synthesis; in STZdiabetic rats it stimulated basal hexose uptake in muscle and liver [89] and even in non-diabetic rat muscle vanadium therapy increased sensitivity to insulin stimulation of glycolysis and glycogen synthesis [90] , impaired antioxidant status and excessive food and fluid intake [91, 92] .",

Probably a relevant aspect deserving care is that neither curcumin nor VO(cur) 2 were effective in reducing plasma glucose levels in STZ-diabetic rats. In contrast, there are reports on the capacity of curcumin to facilitate lowering of plasma glucose or to decrease insulin resistance. The difference might be that these experiments by Thompson et al.

The pharmacological functions of VO(alx) 2 include hypoglycemic effects and the improvement of hyperinsulinemia, hypercholesterolemia and hypertension [108, 109] . VO(alx) 2 significantly induced V uptake in the insulin-responsive tissues such as the adipose, liver and muscle tissues [110] . VO(alx) 2 also affects the tyrosine phosphorylation of IR\u2424 and IRS, leading to the activation of PI3K-Akt signaling and the translocation of GLUT4 to the plasma membrane. Moreover, it was also demonstrated that VO(alx) 2 regulates the DNA binding activity of the FoxO1 transcription factor, which in turn controls the expression of gluconeogenesis genes in response to Akt activation [111] . Overall, VO(alx) 2 improves diabetes, obesity and hypertension by enhancing insulin sensitivity and leptin resistance in obesity-linked type 2 diabetic KKAy mice and was proposed as a promising VC to treat both type 1 and obesity-linked type 2 diabetes [109] .",

Vanadium can also enter the blood stream by injection or infusion, either intentionally when injected intravenously or intraperitoneally, or accidentally when present as a 'contaminant' in infusion solutions [134] . Besides speciation, vanadium compounds ending up in the blood stream either after resorption in the gastrointestinal tract, or via the lungs, or by infusion/injection, are subjected to redox interconversion between V V and V IV , depending on the oxygen tension and the presence of redox-active agents.

At the very low concentrations such as those present in blood plasma V V exists mainly as H 2 VO 4 \u2212 and HVO 4 2\u2212 , often referred as VO 3 \u2212 , or as monovanadate; at pH 7.4 and low concentrations of V V in blood plasma, and several potential ligands being present, it is not expected that divanadates (V 2 ) or tetravanadates (c-V 4 ) might form. In cells, usual physiological vanadate concentrations are also too low to allow for the formation of oligovanadates. Locally, however, concentration enhancement or template-directed nucleation [144] may take place, and the oligovanadate(s) then formed can interact with proteins and DNA. Cellular targets and processes probably affected by decavadates are: (1) membrane depolarization, (2) pumps, channels, receptors in cellular membrane and in endoplasmic reticulum membrane, (3) contractile system, (4) cytoskeleton structure and function, (5) mitochondria bioenergetics, (6) ROSs species changes and antioxidants responses, and (7) probably also nucleous [112] . V IV normally exists as V IV O-species. V IV O 2+ is quite susceptible to oxidation for pH > 3 and forms an insoluble hydroxide for pH > 4 (K sp \u2248 7.4 \u00d7 10 \u221223 ) [145, 146] . At pH > 5 oligomeric vanadium species may be relevant, even at concentrations as low as 10 nM, see (Fig. 3) . In blood serum probably V IV O 2+ is totally bound to high molecular mass and low molecular mass bio-ligands also present; inside cells many bio-ligands are present that form complexes with V IV O 2+ with binding constants probably higher than 10 9 , thus most of the V IV O 2+ should also be bound. However, the presence of a very small amount of V IV O(OH) 3 \u2212 (free or bound?) cannot be ruled out and its relevance in physiological media should be taken into account. ",

Instead, as mentioned above, vanadium in the form of H 2 VO 4 \u2212 , is probably involved in the regulation of phosphate-dependent processes, such as metabolic processes involving phosphatases and kinases and the phosphate metabolism in general [32] . Thus, probably vanadium is an essential element. This plausible regulatory role of vanadium is certainly related to the structural and chemical similarity between phosphate and vanadate (see Fig. 4 ). Additionally, the participation of V IV and V V in leveling reactive oxygen species (ROS) suggests that vanadium can be beneficial in the treatment of several diseases and malfunctions related to ROS imbalances [23] . The competitive behavior of vanadate with respect to phosphate is likely the clue for the insulin-mimetic/insulin-enhancing effect of VCs.

However, unlike phosphate and phosphate esters, vanadate is not easily released once bound at the enzyme's active site. Additionally, in contrast to phosphorus, for which the 5-coordinate state, achieved on binding covalently to the active center, is just a transitional situation, vanadium forms quite stable 5-or 6-coordination compounds; thus, once bound at the active site, vanadates are not easily released and hence block off this site for phosphate, thus resulting in an inhibition of the respective enzyme [6] . Interestingly, the known examples of protein structures with vanadium bound in the active sites globally show that both the square pyramidal and the trigonal bipyramidal geometries can support the transfer of the phosphoryl group in phosphatases and other phosphorylases [180] . However, it is clear that there are much more reported examples of trigonal bipyramidal complexes in the active site than square pyramidal complexes. Considering that in small molecules the square pyramidal geometry is more common than the trigonal bipyramidal one, this observation supports the expectation that the trigonal bipyramidal geometry of V V is supported by the proteins with preference over the square pyramidal geometry. This is an interesting result, but probably is not very surprising as most of these phosphatases are build-up to support a 5-coordinate phosphate transition state.",

Fig. 1 provides an overview of the uptake and distribution of vanadium compounds in the human body. When internalized orally, VCs are subjected to rather strong acidic conditions (pH \u2248 2) in the stomach; the potentially 'destructive' effects of such acidity can be circumvented by drug encapsulation. The saliva and the small intestine are slightly alkaline. Therefore, in addition to the expected speciation of the originally applied pro-drug, while crossing these organs with quite distinct pH conditions, the possible loss of ligand(s), oxidation (mainly in the oral cavity) and reduction (mainly in the GI tract) must be considered as unavoidable situations. Additionally, the original VC may have changes upon interaction with low and high molecular mass constituents, which may behave as ligands. These are abundantly present in the nutritional components, as well as in body fluids and secretions of body fluids stimulated by the intake of food. In fact, without participation of ligands, VCs would be converted into simple compounds: (i) V IV O 2+ salts, probably then forming insoluble V IV O(OH) 2 (for 4 < pH < 7.5), which will not be absorbed and is expelled with the feces, and (ii)",

Either by endocytosis, by diffusion, or by the anion channels (vanadate), vanadium may be uptaken by cells and then be again subjected to speciation and redox leveling. Its availability for subsequent therapeutic or toxicity effects will depend on several factors, namely the amount uptaken, the type of tissue and if the carrier ligand is still present or not, allowing leveling of effects and/or targeting to the sites of therapeutic action.

The IR is a tetrameric trans-membrane protein, being tyrosine kinases, with two \u2423 subunits exposed to the outside and the two \u2424 subunits (IR\u2424) exposed to the cytosol. When insulin docks to the \u2423 subunits, the tyrosine residues of the intracellular \u2424 subunit IR\u2424 become phosphorylated, this corresponding to the activation of IR\u2424. The cytosolic insulin-signaling cascade is initiated in this way, and involves several post-receptor events, ending up with the activation of the glucose transporter (GLUT4). Thus, the phosphorilation of IR\u2424 triggers the phosphorylation of IR substrates, IRS, intracellular proteins containing tyrosine residues. The activation of the IRS in turn initiates a signaling cascade, in the course of which kinases such as phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), protein kinase B (PKB/Akt), and glycogen synthase kinase-3\u2424 (GSK3\u2424) are activated [3, 183] . PKBs, which bind phosphate through Tyr or Ser residues, and then target GLUT4, the glucose transporter [3, 6] , which is translocated to the cell surface and intakes glucose.

If vanadate is present inside the cell, as the result of uptake of a vanadium compound (see Fig. 8 [200] , thereby restoring/keeping active the signal transduction paths for glucose uptake [201] (Fig. 8 ). This possibility was confirmed for e.g. BMOV [202] 1a and for VO(dhp) 2 4 [203] . VO complexes inhibit PTP-1B and activate phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase \u2192 Akt signaling through the enhancement of tyrosine phosphorylation of IR\u2424 and IRS [3] . The particular case of BMOV action was reviewed by Srivastava and coworkers [204] who showed that, besides being better than inorganic V-compounds in inducing phosphorylation of PKB, GSK-3 and FOXO1, a key upstream transducer of BMOV is probably the transactivation of IGF-1R. In this way and through the activation of the PI3K pathway, the phosphorylation of PKB is mediated as well as its downstream targets which regulate glucose transport, glycogen synthesis and gluconeogenesis. The group of Crans [205] also suggested that activation of IR signaling by both insulin and BMOV administration involves increased association of IR with specialized nanoscale membrane micro-domains. The observed insulin-like activity of BMOV (or of its decomposition products) would be due to changes in cell-surface membrane lipid order rather than due to direct interaction with the IR.",

Thus, alternatively, or additionally, ROS produced by vanadates (V IV O(OH) 3 \u2212 or H 2 VO 4 \u2212 ) may be responsible for e.g. the inhibition of PTP-1B by oxidatively targeting the Cys residue present in it.

The group of Crans also proposed that the compound stability and the ability to interact with cellular redox reactions are key aspects for the insulin-enhancing activity exerted by VCs [5] .

The metastatic properties of some tumor cells such as human malignant glioblastoma and breast cancer were also highly inhibited or impaired by Metvan.

In MG-63 human osteosarcoma cell line, its V IV -complex, Na 2 [V IV O(silibinin) 2 ]\u00b76H 2 O, VOsil, inhibited the viability of the osteosarcoma cells in a dose dependent manner with a greater potency than silibinin or the inorganic V IV . The VOsil also displayed a concentration effect both in cyto-and genotoxicity processes. Distribution of the redox status of the cells determined through the increase in ROS level and the decrease in GSH/GSSG ratio were the main events involved in the deleterious effects of the complex on tumoral osteosarcoma cells. Moreover, the complex caused cell cycle arrest and the activation of caspase 3 that triggered apoptosis [244] . Comparing the antitumoral effectiveness of VOsil, with those of the reference metallo-drug (cisplatin) in MG-63 cells: (a) at the lower tested concentrations (2.5 and 10 M), cisplatin and VOsil did not have any effect on cell viability; (b) at 25 M, cisplatin and VOsil were similar as inhibitory agents of cell proliferation, since both of them produced ca. 15% decrease in cell viability; (c) at the middle tested concentration (50 M), VOsil was less deleterious than cisplatin (60% versus 23% survival), whereas at 100 M the differences were 33% versus 21% of surviving cells, respectively.",

A good correlation between the in vitro and in vivo experiments was supported by the IC 50 values for both complexes, considering the results in the osteoblast studies and the IC 50 values obtained with the in vivo model of toxicity (FET test). Moreover, the cytotoxicity in cell cultures showed a decrease in mitochondrial enzymatic activities and DNA damage could also be observed by comet formation in MC3T3-E1 cells while this effect could not be observed in the osteosarcoma cells. Additionally, VO(NH 2 O) 2 (Val) greatly Fig. 11 .

Since VO(NH 2 O) 2 (Val) was more stable as well as less cytotoxic, both in cell cultures and in the in vivo model than VO(NH 2 O) 2 (Met), it is considered a promissory compound to be further investigated as a potential antitumoral agent.

The key protein, defects of which may drastically change the effects of VCs, is p53 (a large number of tumor cell types have defects in the gene encoding this protein) [11] . In p53-defective cells (tumor cells or non-tumor p53-knock out cells), VCs inhibit the cell cycle and thus induce apoptosis [263] . Activation of NF-B by ROS generated by VCs enhances the apoptotic effect [264] . In contrast, in p53-functional cells, disturbed phosphorylation of p53 leads to inhibition of apoptosis [265] . In addition, VCs stimulate the cell cycle, thus inhibiting apoptosis, as both processes are mutually connected [263] . Moreover, NF-B activation inhibits apoptosis of tumor cells. One relevant issue is that frequently VCs cause much more DNA damage in tumor cells compared to non-tumor cells when present at the same levels. Extensive DNA damage leads to apoptosis of tumor cells while a less intensive damage evoked by vanadium compounds in non-tumor cells may stimulate synthesis and activation of repair enzymes, thus protecting those cells from apoptosis [11] . The above processes promote tumor cell growth at early stages of the disease and have an antitumor effect in the advanced stages of cancer. In fact, there are studies in animals treated with carcinogens that suggest that VCs used at low levels have selective effects on the tumor cells [266, 267] .",

It is also considered by the World Health Organization as one of the seventeen neglected tropical diseases together with Chagas disease and leishmaniases. The disease affects mostly poor populations living in remote rural areas of Africa. Untreated, it is usually fatal.

This study is particularly relevant since QSAR studies are still not very common in inorganic medicinal chemistry research due to the difficulty to get a high number of structurally related compounds [280] . Lipophilic effects are among the factors controlling transport to and interaction with biological receptors. Lipophilicity was experimentally determined using reversed-phase TLC experiments where the stationary phase, precoated TLC-C 18 , may be considered to simulate lipids of biological membranes or receptors, and the mobile phase, MeOH:DMF:Tris-HCl buffer pH 7.4 (85:5:10, v/v/v), resembles the aqueous biological milieu. The The indicator variable I col takes into account the potentially different biological behavior of the selected NN scaffolds. The highly electrophilic epoxyphen may react with biological nucleophiles from proteins and DNA through the epoxide-moiety, while the nucleophile aminophen may react with biological electrophiles through the amino-moiety. Moreover, the -expanded systems dppz, phen and phen derivatives may also intercalate to DNA. In summary, the equation highlights the relevance of the lipophilic parameter on the desired bioactivity. Additionally it also reflects the significance of the structure of the co-ligand on the anti-T. cruzi effect. Accordingly complexes with DNA-modifying coligands with the higher I col values, i.e. aminophen and epoxyphen, were the most cytotoxic for the parasite.",

A compartmentation of the glycolytic enzymes, most of which are placed in an organelle called the glycosome, and a relative inefficacy of the respiratory chain has been described. Previous research on T. cruzi epimastigotes metabolism using [l-13 C] glucose as substrate described the detection by 13 C NMR of the carboxylates succinate, pyruvate, acetate and lactate and the amino acids Ala and Gly as main catabolites of glucose [282] . Therefore, the modifications in the excreted metabolites produced by the incubation of the parasite with the selected V IV O-compounds were followed by 1 H NMR spectroscopy. An increment of excreted Gly, acetate and Ala was observed. Acetate and Gly are catabolites produced in the parasite single mitochondrion. Alanine is produced in the cytosol of the parasite cell from pyruvate that is originated in a specific parasite organelle called glycosome, via phosphoenolpyruvate. This pyruvate is also used, into the mitochondrion, in the like-Krebs cycle (Fig. 17 ) [283] . Consequently, an increment in the amount of Ala could be indicative of an increment of cytosolic pyruvate due to a deficient mitochondrion uptake emerging of deleterious effects on mitochondrion integrity. Consequently, the mitochondrion could be pointed out as a potential target for these complexes [280] . The presence of the V IV O core together with the semicarbazone and NN co-ligands seemed to be determinant of the activity. The [V V O 2 (L-H)] complexes, where L are the salicylaldehyde semicarbazone derivatives L1-L5 showed no antitrypanosomal activity [279] .",

The complex is almost ten times more active than [V V O(L6)] 25. To explain the high inhibitory activity against the parasite of 26 as compared to 25, the interaction of this compound with DNA due to the presence of the phen ligand was postulated [288] (Fig. 19) . It was hypothesized that the higher activity of these VCs may be related to either an easier uptake and/or to their higher efficacy toward their targets. On the other hand, inside cells the vanadium speciation may yield species containing or not the original ligands. The phen moiety may indeed be relevant in this respect since it improves the biological activity of the metal-based systems probably by acting as DNA intercalator. Indeed, DNA interaction ability of the phen complex was demonstrated by AFM, fluorescence spectroscopy and viscosity measurements. There are two additional recent reports of VCs bearing inhibitory effects on Leishmania spp. growth. One of them established the growth inhibition of L. tarentolae promastigotes in vitro due to decavanadate (NH 4 ) 6 V 10 O 28 \u00b76H 2 O. The authors suggested the inhibition of phosphatases as a probable mechanism of action [290] .",

In this context, native or chemically modified polysaccharides have been studied to potentiate the immune response. A previous research by the same authors showed that V IV O complexation of galactomannan (GMPOLY), isolated from the lichen Ramalina celastri, exacerbated the cytotoxicity to intracellular Leishmania [9] . The in vitro effects of galactomannan (GALMAN-A) isolated from seeds of Mimosa scabrella and its oxidovanadium(IV/V) complex on macrophage activation and leishmanicidal activity on Leishmania (L.) amazonensis intramacrophages amastigotes were confirmed.

In fact, besides questions on their speciation in the gastrointestinal tract, even small VCs cannot be expected to simply diffuse through membranes to get to the target tissues. They must undergo translocation from the bloodstream through the endothelium of capillaries into the interstitial fluid [79] . Binding to transferrin and/or albumin might be relevant in this respect, but further research must address the mechanisms by which these processes might occur. Thus, a deeper knowledge of the in vivo speciation of VCs should help to better understand the mechanisms of transport, targeting and the mode of action, and give support to the design of efficient vanadium-based drugs.",

Antibacterial vanadium compounds 3.7.3.1. Activity of vanadium compounds against Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Only a few reports on anti-tuberculosis activity of VCs can be found in the literature. A very slight potentiation of the activity on M. tuberculosis H 37 R v of the bioactive 2-aminobenzoylhydrazide by generation of V IV O-complexes was reported several years ago [299]. More recently, V IV O-and V V -complexes of three thiosemicarbazone derivatives (Htsc), [VO(acac)(tsc)] and [VO 2 (tsc)], were evaluated on the pan-susceptible M. tuberculosis (MTB) H37Rv ATCC 27294 strain. Only [VO(acac)(L8-H)], where L8 = 2-acetylpyridine-N(4)-phenylthiosemicarbazone and acac = acetylacetonate, showed an interesting minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) result (MIC 90% 3.6 M)",
