Accordingly, acute, chronic active, and chronic silent lesions are thought to occur along a continuous timeline, eventually producing the scarred and hardened areas within the CNS that can be appreciated grossly (FIGURE 1). The acute MS plaque represents the earliest stage of lesion formation. It is typified by robust inflammatory infiltration combined with demyelination distributed throughout the lesion 47, 54, 98 (FIGURE 1) . Typical features of the acute plaque include ill-defined margins of myelin loss, infiltration of immune cells and parenchymal edema 47 . The constituents of immune cell influx centered around vessels (termed perivascular cuffing) include lymphocytes (predominantly T cells), monocytes and macrophages. A portion of major histocompatibility class II (MHCII)-expressing cells, distributed evenly throughout the lesion, are loaded with lipids (foamy macrophages; FIGURE 1) and participate in active stripping of myelin from axons. While oligodendrocyte apoptosis has been observed 61 , the degree of oligodendrocyte loss within active lesions can be variable 54 . In spite of the relative degree of axonal sparing, axonal injury can be extensive in acute lesions (see section below; 129 ). Glial reactivity throughout the lesion is noted, particularly hypertrophic astrocytes. However, dense glial scarring is not typical of the acute plaque.",

            "text": "The chronic plaque is characterized by a region of hypocellularity with loss of myelin and glial scarring. On gross examination of post-mortem tissue, the hardened and discolored appearance of chronic plaques is often appreciable in frequently targeted areas of the CNS (e.g. the corpus callosum; FIGURE 1). Histologically, the lesion borders of chronic plaques are more distinct than those of acute plaques (FIGURE 1). A division into two forms of chronic plaque is made to signify temporal evolution from active destruction at the edge of the lesion (chronic active plaque) to an entirely \"burned out\" lesion devoid of active inflammatory destruction (chronic silent plaque). In chronic active lesions, inflammation continues along the outer border with the histologic appearance comparable to acute lesions 54 . Thus, borders of the chronic active plaque are populated with activated microglia and macrophages, vessels demonstrating perivascular cuffing, and reactive astrocytes. The presence of antibody and complement are more prominent in chronic active lesions. Areas of re-myelination are often observed on the edge of lesions, but can encompass the entire of lesion 77 . The core of the chronic plaque is typically hypocellular, though, and often contains thickened vessels with enlarged perivascular spaces. Chronic silent lesions are characterized by loss of the inflammatory traits along the border of chronic active lesions. Remyelination and the presence of oligodendrocyte progenitors are uncommon 136 . Essentially, the chronic silent plaque is \"burned out\", containing minimal inflammation and devoid of the active inflammatory border. This is accompanied by a complete loss of oligodendrocytes and a variable but demonstrable reduction in axonal density (FIGURE 1). Overall, the gross and histologic features of the MS plaque imply a complex progression of inflammatory damage culminating in a scarred region of demyelination.",

            "text": "Extensive variability across MS plaques exists, including different degrees of inflammation, demyelination, re-myelination and axonal injury. Controversy has emerged in the \"taxonomy\" by which lesions are grouped, possibly in part as a result of studying a combination of autopsy and biopsy tissues at different stages of the disease. A relatively recent attempt was made to re-define the process of categorizing MS lesions by proposing a system for classification based on suspected pathologic mechanisms. Alongside a temporally-based system, Lucchinetti et al described various types of lesions based on the pattern of leukocyte markers, myelin proteins, immunoglobulin and complement within lesions 79 . From 83 pathologic specimens obtained at autopsy or from biopsy, four distinct patterns of immunologic and pathologic features of actively demyelinating lesions were discerned, patterns II and III being the most common. Pattern I is characterized by the predominance of T cell and macrophage inflammatory content; pattern II is characterized by T cell and macrophage infiltration, along with accentuated immunoglobulin deposition and myelin degradation products within macrophages; pattern III is distinguished by pronounced oligodendrocyte loss at the active edge of the lesion and preferential loss of myelinassociated glycoprotein (MAG); and pattern IV is characterized by oligodendrocyte dystrophy and the absence of remyelination or shadow plaques. Importantly, these distinct patterns were consistently observed within samples from the same patient, but varied between patients. The authors, based on the results from one open-label clinical trial in patients who had brain biopsies, hypothesized that deficit recovery after plasma exchange was indicative of the individual pattern of MS pathology. Plasma exchange was effective in patients with biopsy-proven pattern II (with prominent antibody and complement involvement) but not for patients with pattern I or III lesions 66 . Overall, categorization of MS lesions based on immuno-pathologic mechanisms has added to the complexity of paradigms for lesion classification.",

In particular, challenges have emerged to the idea that there is a clear delineation between the different patterns of pathology 106 . Prineas and colleagues have reported acute lesions from the same patient consisting of features from several of the four pathologic patterns 12 . Furthermore, in a recent study, 131 tissue specimens from 39 MS patients all had lesions with little interindividual variation in pathologic features. Indeed, lesions from this study exhibited traits consistent with inclusion into pattern II (i.e. deposition of complement and antibodies in proximity to macrophages and the absence of oligodendrocyte apoptosis) 22 . Therefore, various pathologic patterns of disease may more precisely refer to the stage of lesion; the relevance of the classification system based on four individual subtypes of plaques remains to be confirmed.",

One hypothesis proposed regarding initial events during plaque genesis is that early intrinsic oligodendrocyte injury leads to the inflammatory damage historically associated with the pathologic features of MS plaques. Thus, toxic insults directly affecting the oligodendrocyte could serve as a trigger for a common immuno-pathologic pathway associated with evolution into later stages of the plaque. That 30 out of 39 cases examined by Breij et al 22 were from patients who were in the progressive phase of disease would suggest that early heterogeneity of lesions could have been missed. Further support of this hypothesis comes from a study in which 26 active lesions were examined from 15 patients at autopsy, 11 of whom were early in the course of their disease 61 . In this study, tissue immediately adjacent to lesion borders showed microscopic evidence of cellular injury without the presence of immune infiltration. Prineas and colleagues speculate that there are possibly toxic factors diffusible to the edge of the lesion resulting in oligodendrocyte fragility, and refer to these areas of initial injury as \"pre-phagocytic\" 61 . Therefore, a critical question remaining in the field of neuropathology is whether differences exist between borders of acute versus chronic active lesions. Further work is required in order to more clearly identify white matter within the CNS that is undergoing early changes or at risk for doing so and how this relates to features described in more established MS plaques.",

Histologically, gray matter lesions are less inflammatory with fewer infiltrating Tlymphocytes and microglia/macrophages 99 . Purely cortical gray matter lesions have also been described as lacking complement deposition 23 and blood-brain barrier breakdown 132 . Whether gray matter plaques arise from distinct immunologic mechanisms is unclear at this time. In an attempt to more carefully evaluate the processes involved, cortical lesions have been separated into several categories based on the depth of penetration from the surface into the brain (FIGURE 2). Type I lesions include discernable injury to both white and gray matter; Type II lesions have perivascular areas of demyelination isolated to the cortex; and Type III lesions demonstrate cortical demyelination below the pial surface that often cover several gyri and stop at cortical layers three or four 99 . Others have proposed a fourth category, Type IV, to describe lesions that affect all cortical layers without extending into the white matter 18 19 (FIGURE 2 ). Type III and IV lesions are the most extensive and difficult to visualize. Although scarce inflammatory cells are found within these lesions, the meninges overlying them contain inflammatory cells that collect in structures resembling ectopic B-cell follicles 72, 80 . In support of a role for lymphoid neo-genesis in the pathogenesis of these lesions is that patients with ectopic B-cell follicles (41% of secondary progressive MS patients) had a more rapid disease progression 80 . More solid determination of the role for ectopic B cell follicle formation in MS will depend upon the reliable detection of cortical lesions by MRI and identification of the immuno-pathologic mechanisms leading to lymphoid neogenesis within the CNS.",

Further, IFN\u03b2 can inhibit the differentiation of naive CD4 T cells into Th17 cells 107 . Patient responses to IFN\u03b2 may be related to the level of IL-17 prior to the onset of therapy 5 . This result re-emphasizes the complexity and heterogeneity of the disease; in particular, the response to current therapies may signify differences in the pathogenesis of MS between patients 67 . The Th17 pathway offers a new therapeutic target, including the molecular pathways that regulate IL-17 40 . However, consistent with the complexity of cytokine networks and regulation, a singular stance that IL-17 is purely pathogenic is likely to be an oversimplification. In particular, IL-17 may participate in limiting tissue destruction during an inflammatory response 93 . Overall, evidence is mounting to suggest that Th17 cells are present during the inflammatory destruction of tissue in MS, but questions remain about the direct contribution of this newly identified lineage of CD4 T cells. At this point, it is reasonable to be inclusive of Th17 cells in the pathogenesis of MS (FIGURE 4) , but to what degree they are involved remains to be shown.",

Naturally, this observation has prompted consideration over whether Ig present within plaques specifically targets myelin antigens. Molecular features of B cells found within MS plaques demonstrate that B cell receptor genes are modified in a specific way that indicates their evolving response toward specific targets 10, 96 . Further specificity of Ig from MS tissue has been described. MBP-reactive 135, 137 and MOG-reactive 92 Ig has been isolated from CNS tissue of patients with MS. Additionally, in situ deposition of MOG-specific antibodies has been detected in MS lesions, along with MOG-and MBP-specific Ig complexed with myelin within macrophages 49 . In contrast, detection of Ig appeared non-specifically dispersed throughout cellular constituents of plaques and NAWM, without significant differences compared to control tissues, suggesting that Ig presence may be secondary to white matter injury rather than antigen-specific B cell activation unique to MS 11 . Thus, while controversy persists as to the antigen-specific nature of B cell involvement in MS, the presence of plasma cells and Ig continues to fuel investigation into their involvement during MS plaque development.",

            "text": "As a representation of B cell involvement in CNS parenchymal damage of MS patients, CSF analysis has afforded several clues on the role of Ig in the pathogenesis of MS. The localized intrathecal production of Ig, referred to as oligoclonal bands (OCB), is detected in over 90% of patients with RRMS 46 , and their absence is associated with reduced severity of disease 4 . While OCB are thought to be a product of clonally-expanded B cells within the CSF compartment, their potential targets remain elusive. Plasma cells from the CSF of patients with inflammatory demyelinating disease produce antibodies that are capable of binding myelin 134 and recognizing MBP 73 . However, a more recent study of the CSF of patients with MS failed to detect IgG from CSF clonal B cells that bound to MBP, PLP or MOG 95 . Analysis of OCB has also included investigation of IgM, which is found in a subset of MS patients 133 . CSF-restricted IgM isolated from MS patients have been found to target a variety of lipid antigens, predominantly phosphatidylcholine 133 . These persistent lipidspecific IgM OCBs are associated with more aggressive disease 20, 133 , and might be associated with a poor response to interferon therapy 21 . Taken as a whole, a multitude of potential targets, including those from myelin as well as other CNS antigens 83 , have been proposed and investigated in patients with MS (Reviewed by Reindl and colleagues 110 ). 59 . This appears independent of antibody effects, since anti-CD20 treatment does not directly target Ig-secreting plasma cells 46 ; results in early efficacy in relapse reduction and inflammatory MRI lesions 59 ; and does not alter CSF Ig levels 33 . B cells may promote neuro-inflammation in MS via direct and indirect effects on T cells, such as the secretion of the pro-inflammatory cytokines. For example, B cells from MS patients produce more TNF-\u03b1 and lymphotoxin in the presence of the T cell-derived pro-inflammatory cytokine IFN-\u03b3 compared to healthy controls 8 . Following anti-CD20-mediated B cell depletion in RRMS patients T cells produced less IFN-\u03b3 and were less proliferative in response to TCR engagement 8 . Conversely, B cells are likely to also have immune-suppressive traits that are important in the immuno-pathogenesis of MS. For example, IL-10 secretion by B cells can serve to limit pro-inflammatory autoreactive CD4 T cell responses 45 . Found in approximately 40% of autopsy specimens only from patients with SPMS 80 , the presence of these follicles was purported to be a maker for cortical lesions immediately adjacent to the ectopic follicle within the meninges. This finding has been disputed in subsequent work that failed to detect meningeal follicles in 12 patients with SPMS 68 . Interestingly, there may be an association between the presence of EBV infectious material and secondary lymphoid follicles observed in MS patients 114 . The implication of this finding is that latent infection of B cells with EBV drives the expansion and maturation of B cells along with ectopic follicle generation within the CNS, promoting intrathecal Ig production and the targeted destruction of underlying myelin in this region 46 . While only observed in patients with SPMS, it is possible that the generation of these lymphoid organlike structures begins during the relapsing-remitting phase and evolves over time. Whether these structures are inhibited by B cell-depleting therapy in MS remains to be investigated.",

Adequate function of the BBB depends upon several unique anatomic and cellular features, including tight junctions between endothelial cells, specialized expression of molecular transporters, and placement of immune cells within the CNS relative to the vasculature 35 . Only by engaging in a critically timed sequence of events are auto-reactive lymphocytes able to enter the CNS compartment. Initially, leukocytes engage in rolling, activation and arrest to the endothelium of the BBB. This is greatly facilitated by up-regulation of adhesion molecules by the vasculature, including ICAM1 and VCAM1 102 . While a trigger for vascular change remains unclear in MS, hypothetically changes in the vascular endothelium could result from pro-inflammatory mediators circulating within the vasculature, including TNF and/or LPS. Subsequently, migration of cells through and between endothelial cells takes place 63 . Eventually, concentrated extravasation of immune cells in perivascular cuffs within the CNS parenchyma culminates in a breach of the BBB that is an essential component to the process of inflammatory destruction of white matter in MS 54 .",

In addition to VLA-4, other trafficking molecules impart specificity of migration into the CNS. Recently, ALCAM-1 was shown to be localized to the BBB and up-regulated in active MS lesions 26 .

Several chemokines and their receptors have been implicated in leukocyte influx to the CNS in MS 63 . For example, CXCL12, constitutively expressed in the CNS, is typically localized to the basolateral aspect of the CNS microvasculature and functions to retain leukocytes within the perivascular space. Redistribution of CXCL12 to the luminal aspect of vessels was observed in autopsy specimens from MS patients, which would allow for the dissemination of lymphocytes into the CNS parenchyma 84 . Other chemokines are thought to participate in the recruitment of lymphocytes into the CNS in MS. Recent work in the EAE system has demonstrated that the initial wave of T cell infiltration into the CNS prior to disease onset is CCR6-dependent. 109 . Furthermore, in EAE, the initial wave of inflammatory CD4 T cells express IL-17 and are potentially recruited specifically via CCR6 into the CNS via the choroids plexus that expresses the CCR6 ligand, CCL20. These results have yet to be convincingly replicated in human samples. Several other chemokine and chemokine receptors expressed by various cell types in MS show dysregulation including CCR7, CCL19 and CCL21, CCR5 97, 127 . Thus, there may be a unique chemokine signature at different phases of disease and in different regions of the CNS in order for various leukocytes to localize to the CNS during MS.",

Experimental evidence based on animal models has shown that antigen-specific encounters within the CNS between T cells and APCs is crucial to the unfolding of MS. In EAE, without newly generated myelin antigens from the CNS by APCs, inflammatory demyelination does not proceed, even in the presence of myelin-reactive CD4 T cells 116, 128 . Thus, CD4 T cell-mediated disease is thought to be a multi-stage process, involving the initial activation of auto-reactive CD4 T cells, as well as reactivation within the CNS immune compartment. DCs are thought to be the major APC during the secondary phase of cognate interactions with CD4 T cells within the CNS 14, 56 . Perivascular spaces within areas bordering edges of active lesions contain immnostaining for CD209, a marker for a subset of DCs, suggesting that antigen presentation by DCs at the interface of the BBB contributes to the earliest inflammatory processes promoting lesion formation 61 . Visualization of APC interactions with encephalitogenic CD4 T cells using intravital microscopy in a rat model of MS suggests that primed CD4 T cells actively engage with these perivascular APCs en route to entry within the CNS 13 .",

Microglia are hematogenously-derived resident APCs within the CNS. Upon activation, they express greater amounts of MHCII and co-stimulatory molecules 2 , signifying a greater capacity to promote pro-inflammatory T cell responses within the CNS. Activated microglia are localized to active plaques 76 . Experimentally, impeding microglial function attenuates EAE 62 . However, relative to other professional APCs, microglia are not as potent at inducing auto-reactive T cell responses 85 and may even down-regulate CD4 T cell functions 94 . Thus, as resident APCs within the CNS, microglia are capable of performing APC functions, but likely are not the lynchpin for driving autoimmunity of the CNS in MS. Another APC potentially involved in driving myelin-reactive CD4 T cells in MS is the B cell. As already mentioned, recent work suggests that B cells play a prominent role in the pathogenesis of MS 46, 59 , and potentially play important roles in antigen presentation to T cells. In addition to effects on T cells, MHCII-dependent interactions with B cells promotes Ig class switching from IgM to IgG. Thus, antigen-specific interactions between B cells and T cells represent a critical step in the generation of Ig responses in MS. It is important to acknowledge that not all interactions between APCs and T cells promote inflammation. In addition to the effects of regulatory B cells mentioned above, APCs can also engender anti-inflammatory responses 48 . For example, suppressor myeloid cells are generated after EAE induction and are capable of suppressing T cell function 140 . In MS, the process of myeloid suppression is thought to be regulated in part by TREM-2, a trans-membrane signaling protein expressed by microglial cells, macrophages, monocytes and DCs 101 . This mechanism may be dysregulated by secretion of soluble TREM-2, which could act as a decoy receptor and prevent inhibitory function of transmembrane TREM-2 101 .",

Although MS has classically been described as a disease marked by the loss of myelin in greater proportion to the loss of axons, axonal damage was noted in the earliest pathological descriptions of MS lesions 29 . Modern techniques have allowed for precise demonstrations of axonal damage. Antibodies directed at amyloid precursor protein show damaged axons in active areas of MS lesions 42 . Representing a major advance in the field of MS pathology, Trapp et al 129 were able to directly view and quantify transected axons using confocal microscopy by counting axonal ovoids at the ends of transected axons. The active areas of MS lesions were found to contain more transected axons than inactive areas in more chronic lesions. Of note, comparisons of biopsy and autopsy samples from patients with relapsingremitting, secondary progressive, and primary progressive MS suggest that axonal pathology is greatest within the first year of disease onset, particularly in patients with RRMS 71 . These studies propose that axonal pathology occurs in areas of active inflammatory demyelination and early during the course of disease.",

Release of toxic molecules by these cells such as proteases and reactive nitrogen species can cause oligodendrocyte injury, demyelination, and axonal degeneration, disrupt the blood-brain barrier, and contribute to the loss of axonal conduction. 118 . Axonal damage also occurs by activation of other components of the innate immune response such as Toll-like receptors 43 . Toll-like receptor 2 is over-expressed by oligodendrocytes in MS lesions where it inhibits remyelination 117 . Antibody-mediated injury to axonal components, e.g. neurofascin, can result in axonal and neuronal dysfunction 83 . As a consequence of immune injury to myelin, higher energy demands on demyelinated axons and glutamate-mediated excitotoxicity may further impart unsustainable damage 81 103 . Overall, axonal injury in MS is likely mediated by multiple mechanisms at play in both active and chronic lesions.",

            "text": "Neuronal loss in MS can be severe and occurs throughout the brain. Neuronal loss in the range of 18-35% has been reported in the cortex, hippocampus, thalamus, and spinal cord (reviewed in 18 ). Damage to axons and neurons has been evaluated in vivo using MRI techniques such as quantitative proton MR spectroscopy. In patients presenting with their first clinical attack of MS, the amount of NAA in the whole brain is already decreased, indicating early neuronal damage 111 . This reduction is still present one year later and was independent of whether the patients had progressed to develop MS. Other MRI techniques, such as measurement of brain volume or diffusion tensor imaging, have provided more variable results in evaluating axonal and neuronal damage especially in short term studies as factors such as demyelination and edema can confound the results. However, examination of neuronal integrity using OCT shows a loss of macular volume in patients with progressive forms of MS, which correlates with poor visual acuity especially in patients with a history of optic neuritis 25 . Similar to axonal injury, the processes resulting in neuronal loss in MS are likely several-fold. Direct immune injury to the gray matter can result in a loss of neurons, as within gray matter lesions a significant increase in apoptotic neurons was observed primarily in large pyramidal cortical neurons 99 . However, in layer II of primary motor cortex from NAWM, paralbumin interneurons were more affected than other neurons that are relatively spared in MS patients 31 . This differential susceptibility of neurons exposed to the same insult is part of a key consideration in how clinical deterioration, particularly with secondary progression, is related to repeated accumulation of axonal or neuronal damage to various neuronal populations. Further, axonal and neuronal survival may be directly tied to the trophic support provided by myelin, which may be particularly relevant during a high metabolic demand state of neurons exposed to inflammatory stressors 90 .",

These include the role of B cells, including antibodydependent and antibody-independent mechanisms; the extent of axonal and neuronal injury; the contribution of a new lineage of CD4 T cells identified by the production of IL-17; leukocyte trafficking mechanisms to the CNS; and new lymphocyte targets during disease. These stand out among many other recent developments that due to space limitations were not able to be covered in this review. Topics involving resolution of inflammation in MS lesions, suppressor cells (Treg, CD8 T cells, etc.) and remyelination are bound to be important in driving toward a more comprehensive understanding of the pathogenesis of MS. Overall, an attempt has been made not to detail every mechanism involved in the pathology of MS, but rather highlight the features of disease that are under current study (FIGURE 4). ",

Further, IL-17 gene expression is up-regulated in lesions of MS patients 78 , and Th17 cells are found in perivascular cuffs and borders of active lesions 130 , indicating Th17 cells home to areas of inflammatory demyelination (FIGURE 3). These studies clearly highlight the association between Th17 cells and MS immune pathology. How might Th17 cells contribute to the pathogenesis of MS? In vitro mobilization studies suggest that Th17 cells cross the blood brain barrier (BBB) more efficiently than other T cells. IL-17-secreting CD4 T cells are capable of eliciting damage to the BBB 65 , which would promote greater influx of other inflammatory cells. Once present in the CNS parenchyma, Th17 cells are capable of mediating injury via recruitment of PMNs 70 and monocytes, along with co-production of other cytokines, such as IL-22 and IL-21, 120 .",
