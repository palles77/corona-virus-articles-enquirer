            "text": "Swine testis (ST) cell cultures were treated with various doses of recombinant human interferonalpha 2a (IFN), and assayed for 2',5' oligoadenylate synthetase (2-5 A synthetase) activity. Treatment with 100 or 1000 units/ml of IFN resulted in increased 2-5 A synthetase activity, but there was no significant response to 1 unit/ml of IFN. Titres of porcine transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) were reduced between 6 and 15 hours post-infection in ST cells treated with 1000 or 2500 units/ml of IFN. Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of lysates of TGEV-infected ST cells, and of lysates immunoprecipitated with anti-TGEV antibodies, revealed that the synthesis of the N and S proteins of TGEV was reduced in cells treated with 100 or 1000 units/ml of IFN. Viral RNA production, as determined with a probe which hybridized to the S gene of TGEV, was found to be reduced in ST cells treated with 1000 units/ml of IFN, but not in cells treated with 100 units/ml. It was concluded that, in IFN-treated ST cells, TGEV protein production may be decreased in the absence of reduced viral RNA production, and that 2-5 A synthetase may not be a significant factor in the antiviral activity of IFN against TGEV.",

            "text": "It is well established that the replication of transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), a porcine enteric coronavirus, may be inhibited by treatment with interferon (IFN) -alpha. Thus natural porcine IFN-qlpha was found to reduce the yields of TGEV in swine testis (ST) cells and in porcine enterocytes (Weingartl and Derbyshire, 1991) . Similarly, an antiviral effect of recombinant human IFN-alpha was demonstrated against TGEV in ST cells by Jordan and Derbyshire ( 1994) . Information is lacking, however, on the mechanism of the antiviral action of IFN-alpha against TGEV and other coronaviruses. For many viruses, the most consistent characteristic of the IFN-induced antiviral state is a reduction in viral protein synthesis. Interferons induce a number of cellular proteins (Sen and Ransohoff, 1993) ) including 2'5 oligoadenylate synthetase (2-5 A synthetase), which has been studied extensively and shown to be a major contributor to the IFN-induced antiviral state, at least in relation to picomavirus infections (Samuel, .1988 ). The antiviral effects of 2-5 A synthetase depend upon its ability to catalyse the synthesis of 2-5 A oligoadenylates, which activate a latent endonuclease which can degrade viral messenger RNA and therefore inhibit viral protein synthesis. Recombinant bovine IFN-alpha induced a dose-dependent increase in 2-5 A synthetase in ST cells, and infection of neonatal pigs with TGEV caused a significant increase in enterocyte 2-5 A synthetase activity (Bosworth et al., 1989) . The role of 2-5 A synthetase in the antiviral activity of IFN-alpha against coronaviruses is unknown.",

The treated cells were monitored for 2-5 A synthetase activity, and, after infection with TGEV, the stage of the infectious cycle inhibited by IFN was determined.

However, there was a marked difference in the reduction in virus yield obtained with 100 units/ml versus 1000 units/ml of IFN. The experiments on the production of TGEV proteins and RNA in IFN treated cells indicated that RNA production was little affected by 100 units/ml of IFN, but decreased by 1000 units/ml of IFN, while protein production was decreased by both 100 and 1000 units/ml of IFN. The proposed mechanism of action of 2-5 A synthetase is through the activation of a latent ribonuclease which degrades viral RNA, particularly mRNA, and leads to decreased viral protein production (Samuel, 1991 , Chebath and Revel, 1992 , Sen and Ransohoff, 1993 . Our results indicate that viral protein production may be decreased without apparent decreases in RNA production, and suggest that 2-5 A synthetase may not be a significant factor in the reduction in TGEV yield in IFN-treated ST cells.",

The present results indicate that TGEV protein production is more sensitive than RNA accumulation to the antiviral state induced by IFN; it is decreased by a lower concentration of IFN and is more significantly reduced than RNA accumulation. These results support the conclusion that decreased TGEV protein synthesis is not primarily due to a decrease in viral RNA accumulation, but rather results from a decrease in translation of these viral RNAs. This conclusion, and the data discussed above, suggest that the 2-5 A synthetase system does not play a significant role in the observed decrease in viral protein production. It is likely, therefore, that the IFNinduced antiviral state to TGEV is mediated primarily through another mechanism, perhaps the Pl /eIF-2 kinase system, which is known to inhibit translation (Samuel, 1991) .",
