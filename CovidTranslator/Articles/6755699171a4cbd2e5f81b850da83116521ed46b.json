            "text": "[ 6 _ T D $ D I F F ] The Century of Epidemics IMED 2016 speakers from all regions of the world agreed that over the course of the coming century, epidemics are likely to occur more frequently, as will the risk of global pandemics. The world's increasing population, higher demand for protein, climate change, increasing mobility, social vulnerability and political instability were only a few of the factors discussed that contribute to the projected increase. At the same time, rapid advances in science and improvements in technology and data sharing offer new ways to prevent, detect, predict and respond to those threats. Although we are not able to prepare when, where or which pathogen will emerge next, we will be better prepared to prevent the next pandemic. The general public's interest in emerging infectious diseases was highlighted in a poster presentation by Dr. [ 1 7 _ T D $ D I F F ] Daniel Lucey and colleagues, who showed details of a planned exhibit on ''Exploring Pandemics: A Smithsonian museum endeavor for the public'' at the Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History in Washington, DC. The exhibit is scheduled to open in early 2018 through early 2020, coinciding with the 100-year commemoration of the 1918-1920 Influenza pandemic and will offer the public an opportunity to explore and understand better 10 epidemics caused by zoonotic viruses from around the world.",

            "text": "[ 7 _ T D $ D I F F ] One World -One Health: Transboundary Emerging Diseases in Humans, Animals and Wildlife IMED opened with a plenary session dedicated to transboundary emerging diseases in an increasingly interconnected world. Professor Albert Osterhaus talked about HIV, Avian flu, SARS, MERS-CoV, Ebola and Zika as some of the diseases that originated in animals and passed to humans. While many of these have been well studied, there remain significant gaps in understanding the linkages of infection, making it challenging to predict and prepare for the next epidemic. Several speakers presented results on studies that further examined zoonotic disease spread and aimed at identifying pathogens and environments most conducive to spillover to humans. Professor Christine Kreuder Johnson and Professor Rudovick Kazwala discussed results from USAID's Emerging Pandemic Threats PREDICT project, that uses a riskbased strategy to investigate emerging diseases threats. Dr. Kreuder Johnson's team examined common animal hosts and convergent mechanisms involved in past spillovers of zoonotic viruses in order to identify high-risk interfaces for surveillance activities and interventions aimed at prevention. The team found that viruses transmitted to humans had significantly higher host plasticity. In other words, they were reported in a more taxonomically diverse host range. Viruses with higher host plasticity were also more likely to amplify viral spillover by secondary human-to-human transmission and have broader geographic spread. Dr. Kazwala reported on results from the PREDICT project in Tanzania where bats, rodents and non-human primates were subjected to molecular virology diagnostic tests and revealed the presence of 64 viruses including 48 novel viruses.",

            "text": "Since the last IMED, flaviviruses have emerged as prominent threats in the world. The flavivirus session addressed the ongoing Zika virus epidemic in the Americas and other regions of the world and the Yellow fever virus outbreak in Africa, which threatened to go global. A major concern of the Zika virus epidemic is the association of maternal infection with birth defects, a complication that has not been seen with flavivirus infections in humans in the past but has been seen with congenital infections in animals. Professor James MacLachlan discussed what is known about congenital infections of animals with flaviviruses and highlighted the critical role of the timing of infection. For example, infections with Bluetongue virus (BTV) have clearly shown the critical role of gestational age in determining outcome. Fetuses infected prior to mid-gestation that survive congenital BTV infection are born with cavitating central nervous system defects that range from severe hydranencephaly to cerebral cysts (porencephaly). Bunyaviruses cause gestational age-dependent teratogenesis in fetal ruminants but, in addition to cavitating central nervous system defects, affected fetuses are born with contracted limbs -congenital hydranencephaly/arthrogryposis syndrome. Dr. Vanessa van der Linden, a pediatric neurologist from Recife, in Northeastern Brazil then gave a heartbreaking description of Zika[ 1 9 _ T D $ D I F F ] -related neurologic complications. Recife is one of the areas hardest hit by the Zika epidemic and Dr. van der Linden was one of the first to recognize the microcephaly epidemic in this area. She reported patients suffering from the full range of manifestations including craniofacial disproportion, spasticity, seizures, irritability, brainstem dysfunction, limb contractures including arthrogryposis, hearing and ocular abnormalities, and brain anomalies detected by neuroimaging. She emphasized the importance of vigilant health professionals to recognize changes in the neurodevelopment during the first years of life and the necessity of a team approach to provide the best care to affected children and support for their families.",

She argued that in reality, not all epidemics are viewed equally.

She talked about the challenges implementing STRIVE in the face of limited infrastructure, high community concern, and changing epidemiology.

The importance of the food chain as a source for emergence and spread of antimicrobial resistance between animals and humans was highlighted in a nation-wide study in Lebanon. Dr. Ghassan Matar described a direct transfer of resistant determinants in bacterial clones from animal food products to humans. But understanding antimicrobial resistance is expanding even further, from human and animal antibiotic use to the human influence on resistance in the environment. Dr. Ursula Theuretzbacher noted that the link between the animal and human sector was well studied and led to policy changes in some parts of the world. Such regulatory initiatives are still missing in the environmental field which is usually not included in the One Health approach to tackle the global resistance problem. The direct release of multidrug resistant bacteria from healthcare settings, antibiotic manufacturing facilities and animal farms into the environment as well as the pollution of the environment with high concentrations of antibiotics create a dangerous resistance reservoir.",
