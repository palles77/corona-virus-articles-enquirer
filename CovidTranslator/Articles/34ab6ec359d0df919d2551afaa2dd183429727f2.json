He was disoriented and was taken to the pediatric intensive care unit with a significantly low Glasgow coma score [GCS: 10 (E3V3M4); eye opening, 4; verbal response, 4; motor response, 5]. On clinical examination, he was lethargic, and he had a fever (39 \u2022 C) and spontaneous oral-buccal movements (chewing, swallowing), suggestive of motor automatismswere noticed. There were no focal neurologic signs, and meningeal irritation signs were also negative. Laboratory tests revealed leukocytosis (white blood cell; 23.000/mm 3 ) and an elevated C-reactive protein (CRP) level of 11.2 mg/dL. Biochemical parameters were normal except hyponatremia was noted (Na: 128 mEq/L). On the first day of admission, he had hypertension (170/100 mmHg) and GCS worsened. Cranial computed tomography (CT) was consistent with pansinusitis. Cefotaxime, vancomycin and acyclovir treatment were started for suspected central nervous system (CNS) infection, and phenytoin was added for seizures. Cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) was clear in appearance, and the pressure was normal. Laboratory examination of CSF revealed pleocytosis (300/mm 3 with neutrophil predominance), an elevated protein level of 194 mg/dL and a normal glucose level. Electroencephalography (EEG) was normal and showed no seizure-related activity. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis of a nasopharyngeal specimen (influenza, parainfluenza, rhinovirus, adenovirus, respiratory syncytial virus, human metapneumovirus, bocavirus, and coronavirus) and CSF (herpes simplex virus, enterovirus, cytomegalovirus, Epstein-Barr virus, HHV-6, and influenza) were negative. An autoimmune encephalitis panel (NMDA, CASPR2, LGI1, anti-Hu, anti-Yo, anti-Ma2) was also negative. Blood serology tests for EBV, CMV, HSV, Parvovirus, measles, mumps, rubella, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Borellia burgdorferi, and brucellosis remained negative. T2-weighted and diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) imaging showed an intensified signal in the splenium of the corpus callosum (Fig. 1) . Bacteriologic culture of CSF was negative, but blood culture was positive for S. pneumoniae (penicillin-sensitive). After S. pneumoniae infection was confirmed, acyclovir and vancomycin were discontinued, and cefotaxime (200 mg/kg/day) was administered for 10 days. The patient completely recovered without any sequelae and was discharged on the 10th day of hospitalization. Follow-up MRI 15 days after the first imaging demonstrated a complete disappearance of the abnormal signal in the splenium of the corpus callosum (Fig. 1 ).",

Reduced diffusion in the splenium has been explained by intramyelinic or interstitial edema, which can be potentiated by hyponatremia. Takanashi et al. [10] reported that most patients with MERS had mild hyponatremia (131.0 \u00b1 4.1 mmol/L), but it is difficult to determine whether this hyponatremia is the real cause of the illness. Similarly, the patient in this case had hyponatremia, but S. pneumoniae was considered to be the causative agent because of the patient's fever, respiratory infection findings and positive blood culture. Axonal damage, oxidative stress and activation of the immune system are considered to be associated with pathogenesis of MERS [4] . Additionally, local infiltration by inflammatory cells could lead to reduced diffusion on MRI. Similar to our case, pleocytosis, a sign of inflammation in the central nervous system, is reported in patients with MERS [4] . Genetic factors may also play a role because patients with MERS have been most commonly seen in Southeast Asia. Although several mechanisms have been proposed for MERS, and the exact pathophysiology is still uncertain.",
