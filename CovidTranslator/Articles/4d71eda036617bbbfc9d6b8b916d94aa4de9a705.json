By January 31, the global confirmed cases have reached 9,776 with a death toll of 213, and the WHO declared the outbreak as a public health emergency of international concern (WHO, 2020). By February 9, the global death toll has climbed to 811, surpassing the total death toll of the 2003 SARS epidemic, and the confirmed cases continued to climb globally. As governments and public agencies in China and other impacted countries respond to the outbreaks, it is crucial for modelers to estimate the severity of the epidemic in terms of the total number of infected, total number of confirmed cases, total deaths, and the basic reproduction number, and to predict the time course of the epidemic, the arrival of its peak time, and total duration. Such information can help the public health agencies make informed decisions.",

            "text": "A simple answer for the wide range of model predictions might be that there was too little information at the beginning of the outbreak, especially before January 23 when Wuhan was quarantined and locked down, and that there was a lack of reliable data, except for the confirmed case data that could be used for model calibration. Rigorous model calibration methods, including maximum likelihood methods and the Bayesian inference based MCMC methods, already take into consideration uncertainties in data by allowing the data at each time point to follow a probability distribution with the mean given by the assumed model and the variance t given by the assumed probability distribution, where the variance may depend on the mean. The lack of data, as we will demonstrate, is a more serious concern for modellers. A key issue that can explain the variability in model predictions is understanding how the available data (confirmed cases) compares with model predictions. Confirmed cases are people with symptoms who made contact with a hospital, got tested, and whose infection of COVID-19 was confirmed by DNA or imaging tests. The infected compartment in by transmission models represents all people who are infected. These include people who may or may not have symptoms and contacts with a hospital, as well as people with confirmed laboratory tests and those who are misdiagnosed. In this sense, confirmed cases (data) are only a fraction of the total infected population (model predictions). A metaphor of an iceberg best represents the difference between data and model predictions. The entire iceberg represents the total infected population, and the tip of the iceberg above the sea surface represents the case data. The part of the iceberg hidden under the water represents the infected people that are unknown to public health surveillance and testing; often called the hidden epidemic. The difference between cases and infections can be measured by the case-infection ratio r, between the newly confirmed cases and the number of infected people, or as a surrogate, the ratio between the cumulative confirm cases and the cumulative number of infected people.",

            "text": "The case-infection ratio r can vary widely for different viral infections that spread through air droplets and close contacts. For the SARS epidemic, the ratio r was in the range of 1=5 \u00c0 1=2 (Chowell et al., 2004; Gumel et al., 2004; Lipsitch et al., 2003; Zhang et al., 2005) . In contrast, for seasonal influenza in 2019e2020, the ratio r can be as small as 1=100, based on estimates from the US CDC (US CDC, 2020). Why should this be a problem for the modellers? In model calibration, in order to estimate key model parameters such as the transmission rate b, by fitting the model output to the confirmed cases data, it is necessary to discount the total number of infectious people, I\u00f0t\u00de, from the model prediction, by the case-infection ratio r to appropriately predict confirmed case data. For each value of the ratio r, a corresponding value for the transmission rate b can then be estimated by fitting the model to data, which in turn determines the basic reproduction number R 0 , the scale of the epidemic, as well as the peak time. Given the potential wide range for the case-infection ratio r of the COVID-19, the estimated transmission rate b has a wide range, and hence the wide range of reported model predictions.",

This is known as nonidentifiability in the modeling literature, see e.g. (Lintusaari, Gutmann, Kaski, & Corander, 2016; Raue et al., 2009; van der Vaart, 1998) . It means that a group of model parameters can not be uniquely determined from the given data during model calibration.

These rudimentary optimization algorithms attempt to find a global minimum of the given objective function, but there are infinitely many global minima given nonidentifiability. Standard Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) procedures based on Bayesian inference often fail to converge to the target posterior distribution in the presence of nonidentifiability, and can produce best-fit parameter values with unreliable credible intervals, since these often relies on elementary MCMC algorithms. Elementary MCMC algorithms converge very slowly given a very skewed posterior distribution. In our study, we used an improved model calibration method using Bayesian inference and affine invariant ensemble MCMC algorithm that can ensure fast convergence to the target posterior distribution when facing nonidentifiability, and provide more reliable credible intervals and model predictions.",

A complex model incorporates more biological and epidemiological information about the epidemic and is more biologically realistic. A drawback of a complex model is that it requires more model parameters to be estimated compared to a simpler model. Given the dataset, such as the confirmed case data of COVID-19, increased number of parameters in a complex model that are unknown and need to be estimated by model fitting can lead to a greater degree of uncertainty in model predictions. In choosing an appropriate model, it is important to draw a balance between biological realism and reducing uncertainty in model predictions, and this choice can significantly influence the reliability of model predictions. The modeling procedure to determine the right balance is model selection using various information criteria, for instance the Akaike Information Criteria (AIC) for nested models (Akaike, 1973; Sugiura, 1978) .",

We briefly outline in Section 2 the methodology for model calibration using an improved procedure based on Bayesian inference and model selection method using Akaike Information Criteria. In Section 4, using the SIR model, we illustrate the linkage between the transmission rate and caseinfection ratio, and the presence of nonidentifiability when only the confirmed-case data is used for model calibration. In Section 5, we present detailed results of the SIR model calibration and our model predictions, including the distribution of peak time, prediction interval of future confirmed cases, as well as the total number of infected people. In Section 6, we estimate the impact of further control measures recommended in Wuhan after February 7 and predicted the changes in peak time under different assumptions on the reduction of transmission achieved by these measures. In Section 7, we estimated the impact of timing the return to work on the course of the epidemic, in terms of peak time, peak values, and the duration of the epidemics. Our results are summarized in Section 8.",

Here we note the difference between the latent period, which is the period from the time an individual is infected to the time the individual is infectious, and the incubation period, which is the period between the time an individual is infected to the time clinical symptoms appear, which include fever and coughing for COVID-19. For SARS, infected individuals become infectious on average two days after the onset of symptoms WHO (2003); so, the SARS latent period is on average longer than the incubation period. For COVID-19, evidence has shown that infected individuals can be infectious before the onset of symptoms (Bai et al., 2020) , but the length of the latent period is largely unknown. In comparison to the SIR model, the SEIR model has the strength of being more biologically realistic, but the SEIR model has the drawback of having two additional unknown parameters: the latent period and the initial latent population.",

It is common to use a Poisson or negative binomial probability model for observed count data. When the mean of a Poisson or negative binomial distribution is large, it approximates a normal distribution. Since the newly confirmed cases are approaching large values quickly, the distribution of the count data will be approximately normal and the probability model for the observed count data in our study was assumed to a normal distribution with mean given by rI and variance given by 1= t. There are four parameters to be estimated in the SIR model from data: transmission rate b, diagnosis rate r, the initial population size I 0 for the compartment I on January 21, 2019 (t \u00bc 0), and the variance q \u00bc 1=t for the noise distribution in the data.

Mathematical modeling is an important tool for estimating and predicting the scale and time course of epidemics, evaluating the effectiveness of public health interventions, and informing public health policies. The focus of our study is to demonstrate the challenges facing modelers in predicting outbreaks of this nature and to provide a partial explanation for the wide variability in earlier model predictions of the COVID-19 epidemic.",

By comparing standard SIR and SEIR models in predicting the epidemic using the Akaike Information Criterion, we showed that, given the same dataset of confirmed cases, more complex models may not necessarily be more reliable in making predictions due to the larger number of model parameters to be estimated.",

            "text": "Using a simple SIR model and the dataset of newly diagnosed cases in Wuhan for model calibration, we demonstrated that there is a linkage between the transmission rate b and the case-infection ratio r, which resulted in a continuum of best-fit parameter values, which can produce significantly different model predictions of the epidemic. This is a hallmark of nonidentifiability, and the root cause for variabilities in model predictions. The nonidentifiability should not be interpreted as a shortcoming of transmission models; neither is it caused by the limited number of time points in data. Rather, it is caused by the lack of datasets that are independent of the conirmed cases to allow modelers to produce independent estimates of b and r. The reliability in model predictions depends on how rigorously the nonidentifiability is addressed in model calibration and on the choice of parameter values. We demonstrated that Bayesian inference and an improved Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm, the affine invariant ensemble Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm, can significantly reduce the wide parameter ranges in the uniform prior and produce workable credible intervals, even in the presence of nonidentifiability. We showed that the estimated credible intervals for the parameters are sufficiently small to allow our credible interval for the peak time to fall within a week. We have further demonstrated that the peak time of the epidemic is much less sensitive to parameter variations than the peak values and the scale of the epidemic. This was also observed in our previous work on predicting seasonal influenza for the Province of Alberta.",
