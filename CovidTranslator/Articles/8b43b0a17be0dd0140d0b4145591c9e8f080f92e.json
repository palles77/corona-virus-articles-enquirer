A synopsis of the known data is used to propose a molecular model of the mechanism involved and for the role of the pseudoknot. This latter structure is able to recruit 30s ribosomal subunits to initiate translation, but also to bind S.15 and to stop translation by trapping the ribosome on its loading site. Information on the S 15 protein recognition of the messenger RNA site was deduced from mutational analyses and chemical probing. A comparison of this messenger site with the S 15 ribosomal binding site was conducted by analysing hydroxyl radical footprintings of these two sites. The existence of two subsites in 16s RNA suggests that the ribosomal protein S15 might present either two different binding sites or at least one common subsite. Clues for the presence of a common site between the messenger and 16s RNA are given which cannot rule out that recognition specificity is linked to a few other determinants. Whether these determinants are different or not remains an open question.",

In most cases, polycistronic messengers of diverse origins (retroviruses, yeast retrotransposon Ty, several procaryotes) are affected. Translation responds to at least two sets of cis-acting elements, a short specific sequence and a highly ordered structure just downstream, which is very often a pseudoknot. As result, it allows the synthesis at a low yield of a specific protein either by inducing a frameshift upstream of a stop codon or by causing read-through at the termination step. As far as we know there is no regulation acting in tram and the translation rates observed are permanent, suggesting that the mechanisms involved can be considered as an integrated way to express several compacted messages. Despite intensive work to elucidate their precise role in the ribosome-mRNA complex, the mechanisms involved are still unknown. Sometimes the presence of a pseudoknot is absolutely necessary but at others sites it can be replaced by a stable stem-loop. Stability of stem 2 has also been invoked [l] .

They constitute important signals in cis which are essential not only for ribosome binding and movement as noted above for the ribosomal frameshifting or the read-through of termination codons, but also for the interaction with a repressor molecule. Very often, the protein from the translated message corresponds to the repressor, thus inducing autoregulation by its translation rate. The study of rps0 expression is perhaps one of the most convenient tools to help understand these problems. The rps0 gene encodes a small ribosomal protein, of 10000 Da, S15, and constitutes the first gene of the rpsOpnp operon, located at the 69th minute of the E coli chromosome. The expression of rps0 has been shown to be autoregulated through the formation of a pseudoknot. Taking into account the recent progress made in our knowledge of the operator site of rps0 mRNA and the general features of the pseudoknot structure by NMR [4] [5] [6] , a tentative, comprehensive model of translation autoregulation is proposed.",

            "text": "Initiation of translation can be modified by restricting the access of the initiating ribosome to the Shine-Dalgamo se-quence. This can occur in two ways: either reversibly, by masking the Shine-Dalgamo sequence or irreversibly by cutting this sequence with an endoribonuclease [7] . In most of the studied cases, the former solution has been observed. The Shine-Dalgamo binding site is often embedded in a more or less stable stem-loop created by alternative structure [8] or antisense RNA [9] . Proteins can also bind specifically to the Shine-Dalgamo region and inhibit ribosome loading by steric hindrance [lo] . In this case, the ribosome loading site and the repressor binding site can overlap, but this is not absolutely necessary, as protein binding at a distant site is able to induce alternative RNA structures which, in turn, can entrap the Shine-Dalgarno sequence. In this classical model of autoregulation, occupancy of both sites is mutually exclusive and competition is observed between ribosomes and repressor. Another reversible way to modulate translation is to arrest the ribosome movement before the productive ternary initiation complex is formed. In this model, the ribosome is trapped by the repressor on mRNA at the pretemary step. Interestingly, in the two messengers known to exhibit this feature (ie the messengers of the ribosomal protein S4 and S 15 [ 11, 12] ), a pseudoknot is present, suggesting that it may serve as an energetic barrier to the ribosome.",

Hairpin II is less stable than hairpin I and carries the Shine-Dalgamo sequence embedded in the stem and the initiation codon in the loop (fig 2) . However, an alternative structure is also present in equilibrium with hairpin II. The invariant core of this structure is formed by the stem of hairpin I, but its loop is paired with a stretch of seven nucleotides located just downstream the initiation codon ( fig 2) . When the pairing of the loop is achieved, a new stem (stem 2) is formed, creating a pseudoknot: both stems are separated by a spacer consisting of an unpaired U nucleotide. The two loops (1 and 2) connecting the stems are strongly dissymmetric: loop 1 carries two nucleotides crossing the deep major groove whereas loop 2 contains 31 residues and crosses the minor groove.

However, when this deletion was analysed, the autocontrol indeed disappeared. Thus, although no spontaneous mutations were isolated in hairpin I, it could be concluded that this structure is necessary for the autocontrol because it is involved in the pseudoknot formation. More direct evidence for the existence in vivo of the pseudoknot was obtained by mutational analysis. It turns out that each time a point mutation disrupts the Watson-Crick base pairing in stem 2, autocontrol is lost. On the other hand, each time a complementary mutation is introduced in the other strand to restore Watson-Crick basepairing, autocontrol is also restored [13, 14, 161 . Thus there is a perfect correlation between pseudoknot disruption in vitro and loss of autoregulation in vivo on the one hand and between restoration of autoregulation in vivo and restoration of stem 2 stability in vitro on the other.",

A major consequence of S 15 binding is that all nucleotides corresponding to the loop of hairpin I (positions (-39) to (-47)) become unreactive to DMS and CMCT [ 171. This reduction of reactivity is primarily due to the formation of stem 2 of the pseudoknot. Note that Ac-16) and ACAT), which are not involved in base-pairing in the naked pseudoknot, are also protected. In addition, the bulged UC_53) and U(+2) become also unreactive. Further hydroxyl footprint experiments confirmed that S15 shields . Additional evidence for the stabilisation of the pseudoknot by S15 was provided by toeprinting experiments. Indeed, the primer extension of a complementary oligonucleotide at the 3' end of the pseudoknot fragment by reverse transcriptase was analysed in the presence and in the absence of the S 15 protein. Faint bands corresponding to stops around +lO, +lI, +13, +14 were detected only in the presence of S15 and were shown to increase with S 15 concentration, suggesting that the binding of S15 induces stabilisation of the pseudoknot [ 121. Moreover, a direct correlation between the formation of the pseudoknot and S 15 binding was shown by in vitro binding experiments using retention on nitro-cellulose filters. Indeed, mutations preventing pseudoknot formation induce a drop of the binding affinity of at least lo-fold [18] .",

Thus, in the ternary complex, the pseudoknot structure must be open. When tRNAfMet was omitted, the stop corresponded to +lO, at the edge of the pseudoknot, suggesting that in the binary complex, the pseudoknot is present and able to stop reverse transcriptase [ 121. In the presence of S 15, the signal at +lO increases with S 15 concentration and does not change in position even when tRNAfMet is added. These observations indicate that S15 does not prevent 30s subunit binding, as was observed in competition mechanisms. On the contrary, it stabilises the pseudoknot in the presence of 30s subunits. Direct evidence for the presence of both 30s and S 15 on the same RNA molecule was provided by footprint experiments [ 121. In the presence of S 15, specific protection around Gs(_4&43) in stem 2 was clearly detected whereas protection of the Shine-Dalgarno sequence appeared in the presence of 30s subunits. When both components were present, protection in the Shine-Dalgamo sequence and in stem 2 were present indicating that both kind of molecules are bound simultaneously to the pseudoknot. Participation of pseudoknots in ribosome loading has already being described [20, 211. The apparent binding cooperativity observed between S15 and 30s subunits might be the result of an increased binding of 30s after S15 binding exposing the Shine-Dalgarno sequence in loop 2. On the other hand, an increased binding rate of S 15 only in the presence of 30s cannot be excluded because toeprints are clearly detected at position (+lO) in the presence of 30s subunits, whereas, in their absence, only very faint bands are observed around this position in the mutant CFP5517 [12, 17] . Thus, the repressor might bind to the 30S-mRNA complex more tightly than to the mRNA as proposed by Draper [ 191 and this increased affinity might account for the cooperativity observed. If this last hypothesis is correct, a true entrapment mechanism (and not competition) would exist, in which S15 would bind and prevent the pretemary complex to form the ternary complex. Unfortunately, neither the binding constant affinities of S 15 and 30s subunits for the messenger, either naked or in a binary complex (see fig 8) , nor the in viva concentration of free components, which would allow to deduce the order of binding, are precisely known and no definitive conclusion can be drawn actually about the origin of this cooperativity.",

Thus, restoring perfect base pairing induces loss of autoregulation, suggesting that UoG is specifically recognized by S 15. However, to explain that this base-pair is not recognised in strains carrying mutations preventing pseudoknot formation, it is necessary to admit that the formation of a pseudoknot is required because either it carries another binding site or/and it provides a correct adjustment of the UOG base-pair. it has been shown that the formation of the pseudoknot per se does not allow S15 binding as illustrated by a mutant exhibiting C instead of U(-3s) in the spacer between the stem. This mutant is able to form a pseudoknot in vitro, but does not autoregulate [ 181. The pseudoknot formed is probably different because the spacer nucleotide cannot form a canonical Watson-Crick base-pair and presumably does not allow correct stacking of the two stems. Thus, the pseudoknot conformation must satisfy several rules before S15 can recognise its target and bind: 1) the UoG determinant must be present; 2) a pseudoknot has to form, accounting for the presence of stem 2; and 3) complementarity between position (-47) of loop 1 and (-38) of the spacer is required leading to stacking of the stems and to the formation of loop 1 restricted to only one nucleotide. This last condition predicts that a pseudoknot exhibiting only seven nucleotides in stem 2 is needed to allow only one nucleotide to cross the deep major groove.

This conclusion accounts for the detection in vitro of several conformations of the pseudoknot, with either one or two nucleotides in loop 1 and correlative variation of +_ 1 base pairs in stem 1 and 2. However, S 15 binding is able to stabilise the formation of a unique conformation constituting two stacked stems of 17 base pairs long, with only one nucleotide crossing the major groove. Fe(H)-EDTA footprinting experiments, which generate free hydroxyl radicals able to attack the ribose moiety of the backbone show that S 15 protects essentially one strand from positions (-42) to (-49), a region encompassing the upper part of stem 1, stem 2 and loop 1. Further protection was detected at +lO in the other strand, corresponding to the upper part of stem 2 and also minor protection around the initiation codon in loop 2 [ 181. As this probe is insensitive to secondary structure, it can be concluded that the protection observed does not correspond to some rearrangement linked to S 15 binding but to a true shielding by the ribosomal protein. Protection at (-49) means that IJ(-r91 of the predicted UoG determinant might interact with the protein or at least that it is within its close proximity as is also U(45) which is known not to interact with S15. No clear answer can be given for Ac-46) either. It might interact directly or might be simply buried in the deep narrow groove of stem 2. A 3D model was derived from these data [ 181. In this model, S 15 sits in the deep groove of the coaxial stack, especially in the region of the loop that displays the sharp turn of the ribose phosphate backbone making contacts with both strands [ 181. S15 might recognise a specific and unique conformation of the sugar-phosphate backbone that is provided by the pseudoknot or interact non-specifically in this area.

One can imagine that, after binding, if the concentration of free S15 is low, the pseudoknot opens, the initiation complex is formed and translation can proceed. In the presence of SE, the pseudoknot stability is increased drastically by S15 binding and pseudoknot transconformation and translation initiation is blocked. Note that once the active ternary complex is formed (after melting the pseudoknot), S15 is unable to bind and inhibit translation. the corresponding regions are apparent, except for their position relative to UoG. Site directed mutagenesis on both 16s RNA and the S15 protein might help to clarify this point.

The pseudoknot appears to be the fully active species for translation because it recruits efficiently 30s ribosomal subunits thanks to its presumed fully exposed Shine-Dalgarno sequence. What is the function of hairpin II? A possible function is to increase the translation rate and autoregulation by preventing the ribosome from binding outside of the pseudoknot by masking the Shine-Dalgamo sequence. One can imagine that an equilibrium between a pseudoknot and an unstructured messenger would permit the formation of an initiation complex independently of the pseudoknot formation, thus escaping from regulation. By combining an optimal stability of the pseudoknot with high efficiency of ribosomal binding, this pseudoknot is able to initiate translation actively because after 30s binding and the ternary initiation complex can be formed easily through pseudoknot disruption. On the other hand, by keeping the same structure for ribosome and S 15 binding, a cooperativity is developed which gives a high translational control efficiency. Thus, the messenger reconciles contradictory requirements for two opposed functions and a precise equilibrium must be conserved for correct regulation. If the binding rate of ribosomes to the Shine-Dalgamo sequence is altered, all the regulation is perturbed. For example, increasing the binding of 30s by improving the complementarity of the Shine-Dalgamo sequence with 16s RNA stabilises the binary com-plex and stimulates translation whereas repression is decreased. Conversely, increasing the ribosome dissociation rate increases autoregulation efficiency by allowing a decrease in the rate of the ternary initiation complex.",
