Considerable effort has been invested in the development of portable, user-friendly, and cost-effective systems for point-of-care (POC) diagnostics, which could also create an Internet of Things (IoT) for healthcare via a global network. However, at present IoT based on a functional POC instrument is not available. Here we show a fast, user-friendly, and affordable IoT system based on a miniaturized polymerase chain reaction device. We demonstrated the system's capability by amplification of complementary deoxyribonucleic acid (cDNA) of the dengue fever virus. The resulting data were then automatically uploaded via a Bluetooth interface to an Androidbased smartphone and then wirelessly sent to a global network, instantly making the test results available anywhere in the world. The IoT system presented here could become an essential tool for healthcare centers to tackle infectious disease outbreaks identified either by DNA or ribonucleic acid.",

            "text": "Dengue fever, ranked as the most important mosquito-borne viral disease with pandemic potential, emerged as a serious public health concern. The World Health Organization (WHO) reported that in the past fifty years, the number of cases has increased 30 times, causing huge human and economic cost which has yet to be tackled [1] . According to studies [2, 3] , there were an estimated 390 million annual cases of dengue fever and an estimated 3.9 billion people in 128 countries are at risk of being infected by dengue fever virus (DENV) with different serotypes. The DENV is affecting numerous areas in Eastern and Southeast Asia, such as China [4] ; the lowlands of Nepal [5] ; the slums in Delhi, India [6] ; Hanoi, Vietnam [7] ; and Iran [8] as well as other parts of the world, such as the Middle East, North Africa [9] , and South America [10] . Due to the lack of effective treatment of severe dengue fever [11] , accurate and early detection methods to identify the DENV serotype [5, 12, 13] are required in order to provide careful patient monitoring and to prevent the disease's progression to a more severe stage. Mobile laboratories suitable for tackling highly contagious diseases such as Ebola, have been developed [14] , but they are too bulky and expensive for non-contagious DENV, malaria or similar diseases. An easy-to-use, affordable, truthful and reliable point of care (POC) device to perform rapid and economical DENV diagnostic tests in high-risk areas is badly needed. Moreover, it is of the utmost importance to immediately report the results of the POC, including its time and location, to authorities in a centralized location to take required measures.",

Connecting the easy to use and cost-effective POC devices providing the DENV diagnoses via a mobile network would create an Internet of Things (IoT) [15] for healthcare [16, 17] , an essential tool to tackle any infectious disease outbreak. The IoT would speed up the information transfer from POC devices to a centralized location and then based on models using big data analysis [12, 18, 19] , suggest targeting specific sites. The IoT would be able to communicate with the POC systems, inform its operator where to go next to perform testing, remotely change the test protocols or provide other important information to the POC device user. This year, the fifth generation of cellular mobile communications will be released with a massively increased data rate compared to those of previous generations. Nevertheless, the IoT for POC applications such as DENV testing can rely on the oldest generation of 2G, as the POC communication with the centralized location requires a low data rate, an important feature for cash strapped countries of the developing world.",

The paper-based lateral flow immunechromatographic test is fast and easy to usetherefore is often used in remote areas. However, due to its lower sensitivity as well as specificity, a confirmation using a second detection method (ELISA and/or RT-PCR) is often required. The ELISA method relies on antibody production by the human immune system, the method being more suitable for advanced stages of the disease. The RT-PCR is the preferred method as, in principle, it can detect a single copy of specific ribonucleic acid (RNA) [24, 25] having both sensitivity and specificity required for early disease detection (lowering the cost of treatment). Unfortunately, RT-PCR tests are typically only carried out in hospitals or certified diagnostic laboratories after the onset of DENV symptoms. The RT-PCR method is highly specific and reliable; the problem is that not every infected patient makes it to the hospital to be positively diagnosed. As an outcome, the diagnostic results are not available as quickly and comprehensively as required for disease outbreak control.",

All results can be collected as cloud data by a network to create a disease outbreak map showing the disease outbreak area and carry out continuous monitoring. amplification data, as well as MCAs, were displayed on the integrated thin film transistor (TFT) screen of the PCR unit. Then they were transferred to the smartphone via BT to be displayed by the mobile system and also further processed by subtracting the background noise and normalization. The data were then averaged from four consecutive runs and plotted in a linear (Fig. 3B) and logarithmic (Fig. 3C) scale. We then calculated the C T as the value of the cycle number with 10% of relative fluorescence amplitude as (20.07 \u00b1 0.17) cycle (mean \u00b1 standard deviation from four measurements), showing an excellent point to spot result uniformity. We also extracted the MCA (Fig. 3D ) and performed the curve fitting using a modified Boltzmann curve obtaining a T M value of (81.98 \u00b1 0.16)\u00b0C (mean \u00b1 standard deviation from four measurements). We subsequently performed a numerical differentiation of the fitted curves for better visualization (Fig. 3E) by showing the values of T M as peaks of the -dF/dT curve. Concurrently, we performed identical testing using a commercial real-time PCR system getting comparable results for both, C T and T M (Supplementary section A) . Then, the data containing the time of experiment and GPS location could be sent via LTE to the centralized location for further analysis of the disease spreading.",

Samples collected from cheek swabs or from saliva have very low contents of DNA, thus hindering the PCR analysis. There are readily available single-step kits for real-time PCR systems capable of processing samples as they are collected [37, 38] . The only requirement is mixing the sample with these reagents. After the mixing step, the cells are enzymatically lysed, so that DNA/RNA from cells is released, followed by heating to stop the lysis enzymes [39] and activation of the polymerase, which is then followed by PCR thermal cycling. The last two steps would be performed on the hand-held PCR.",
