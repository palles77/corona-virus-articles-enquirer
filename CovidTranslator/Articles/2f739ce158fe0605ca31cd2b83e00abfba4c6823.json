            "text": "Background: Viral respiratory tract infections and atopy are associated with attacks of wheezing during childhood. However, information about the relationship between viral infections and atopy among children whose attacks of wheezing lead to hospitalization is unclear. Objective: To evaluate the prevalence of viral respiratory tract pathogens among infants and children hospitalized for wheezing and to analyze the results in relation to the patient's age, atopic characteristics, and season of admission. Methods: This was a case-control study of children (age 2 months to 18 years) admitted for wheezing to the University of Virginia Medical Center over a period of 12 months. Children without wheezing were enrolled as controls. Nasal secretions were evaluated for viral pathogens by using cultures, PCR tests, and antigen detection. Total IgE and specific IgE antibody to common aeroallergens was measured in serum. Results: Seventy percent of children hospitalized for wheezing before age 3 years (n = 79) were admitted between December and March, whereas 46% of children age 3 to 18 years (n = 54) were hospitalized between September and November. Among children younger than 3 years, viral pathogens were detected in 84% (66/79) of wheezing children and 55% (42/77) of controls (P < .001). Respiratory syncytial virus was the dominant pathogen during the winter months, but rhinovirus was more common during other months. Total serum IgE levels were generally low, and values from wheezing and control subjects overlapped considerably. Among children 3 years and older, 61% (33/54) of subjects admitted for wheezing tested positive for virus (predominantly rhinovirus), compared with 21% (12/ 56) of controls (P < .001). The total serum IgE values among wheezing children (geometric mean, 386 IU/mL; 95% CI, 259-573) were substantially elevated compared with those of controls (geometric mean, 38 IU/mL; 95% CI, 26-56; P < .001). A significantly higher percentage of wheezing children compared with controls was sensitized to at least 1 of the inhaled allergens tested: 84% (36/43) compared with 33% (15/ 45; P < .001). The atopic characteristics of wheezing children who tested positive or negative for virus were similar. Conclusions: Viral infections were the dominant risk factor for wheezing among children hospitalized before 3 years of age. By comparison, a large majority of the wheezing children age 3 to 18 years had striking atopic characteristics that may be critical as a risk factor for hospitalization and an adverse response to viral infections, especially infections caused by rhinovirus.",

With the development of more sensitive techniques to test for viral pathogens, especially PCR, it is now possible to examine the prevalence of viral respiratory tract infections among children treated for wheezing in greater detail. 5, 6 Combined with assessments for atopy, the results of these tests may provide information that can be used to improve methods for decreasing the frequency and severity of attacks that require hospital care.",

In contrast, rhinovirus has been detected more frequently in community based studies of wheezing among school-age children. 9 Other population surveys have shown that sensitization to inhaled allergens as well as elevations of total serum IgE were strongly associated with asthma in children and adults. [10] [11] [12] [13] When the prevalence of viral infections and atopy were considered together in a study of asthma in a pediatric emergency department, the strongest odds for wheezing included positive tests for rhinovirus in combination with allergic sensitization. 14 Because similar information is lacking for children who require hospitalization, the current study was designed to examine the prevalence of viral respiratory tract pathogens among infants and children who were hospitalized for wheezing over a 12month period, and to evaluate the results in relation to the patient's age, atopic characteristics, and season of admission.",

Children with chronic lung disease or congenital heart disease and children who were immunosuppressed were excluded. The control group included 133 children with no symptoms of wheezing at the time of admission. Exclusion criteria for the controls included immunosuppression but did not include the presence of other respiratory tract symptoms or a history of previous wheezing, asthma, or allergic disorders. Goals for matching among wheezing and control patients included age and sex. The majority of matched controls were enrolled within a month of each wheezing patient. Patient demographic information was obtained from hospital charts and from questionnaires administered to parents. The study was approved by the Human Investigation Committee at the University of Virginia. Informed consent was obtained from parents, and assent was obtained from children when they were old enough (usually $7 years old).",

Tests of homogeneity with respect to the frequency data were formulated as a difference of 2 group proportions in which the group proportions were assumed equal under the null hypothesis. Nonparametric exact methods were used to have a test and CI with proper coverage probability, even when the contingency cell frequencies were small. 18 Exact 2-sided 95% CIs for the differences of proportion were constructed as described by Agresti and Min. 19 Multivariate analyses related to predicting wheezing as a function of the patients' atopic status and evidence for viral infection were performed by multiple logistic regression. Tests of association were evaluated on the basis of the generalized Wald v 2 statistic, 20 and 95% CI construction for the adjusted odds ratio (OR) was based on the Wald approximation. 21 Total serum IgE data were analyzed on the logarithmic scale by 1way ANOVA. CI construction for the ratio of geometric means (GMs) was based on the Student t distribution. StatXact 5 (Cytel, Cambridge, Mass) was used to compute nonparametric exact tests and the nonparametric exact 95% CIs. The Proc Genmod and the Proc Mixed procedures of SAS version 8.2 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC) were used to conduct the multiple logistic regression and the ANOVA, respectively.",

However, controversies persist regarding the relationship between viral infections and the atopic characteristics of the children who have these attacks. In our current study, viral infections were frequently detected among wheezing patients, and their prevalence declined with age. From age 3 years on, children admitted for wheezing had striking atopic characteristics, and 40% had no evidence of virus infection, despite the comprehensive assessment for viral pathogens that included PCR tests, cultures, and antigen detection for RSV and influenza. Moreover, the wheezing children >3 years old with positive tests for virus had atopic characteristics similar to those of children who had negative tests, and both groups had similar monthly admission patterns, including an increased risk for hospitalization during the fall. Taken together, the data suggest that atopy among the children age 3 to 18 years may be critical as a risk factor for hospital admission and an adverse response to infection, especially infections caused by rhinovirus.",

Prospective studies have shown, however, that increased levels of IgE detected during infancy track with age, and we speculate that the children with values in the upper quartile range may have a higher risk for developing allergic respiratory tract symptoms as they grow older. 27, 28 Exposure to ETS was common among children enrolled in this study, and the frequency of exposure was similar among the wheezing and control groups. This was also observed in our previous pediatric emergency department studies. 29 Among wheezing children, however, especially children whose mothers smoke, there is substantial evidence that passive smoke exposure aggravates airway hyperresponsiveness and the frequency and persistence of symptoms. 30, 31 Nevertheless, it seems doubtful that fluctuations in ETS exposure at home would coincide with or significantly influence the seasonal peaks in wheezing admissions observed in the current study. Consistent with previous reports of racial and ethnic differences in asthma, more African American children age 3 to 18 years were enrolled in the wheezing group. 32 Most of the African American children admitted for wheezing were also from low-income families; however, the frequency of positive tests for allergen specific IgE antibody and for rhinovirus were not significantly different among these children on the basis of race or family income status.",

Rhinovirus was detected in close to half of the wheezing subjects and was the only virus significantly associated with wheezing. This observation is consistent with a recent report showing that infections with rhinovirus, but not metapneumovirus, were significantly associated with wheezing among children hospitalized for asthma. 33 A trend toward lower rates of virus detection was observed among the older children (10-18 years old) in our study. Even lower rates of infection were reported in a study of asthma exacerbations in adults, suggesting that protective immunity may develop despite the existence of approximately 100 rhinovirus serotypes. 34, 35 The evaluation of subjects for infections with mycoplasma and Chlamydia remains a challenge. 36 Nonetheless, recent studies of children and adults who were hospitalized for asthma detected mycoplasma or Chlamydia in less than 5% of patients. 35, 37 The atopic characteristics of the children admitted for wheezing from age 3 years on did not appear to diminish with age. IgE levels were also not significantly different among children with previous hospitalizations for wheezing compared with children who were admitted for the first time. Other surveys of children and adults have shown that asthma and airway hyperresponsiveness are closely linked to the serum IgE level, and that elevations of total IgE may be associated with asthma independent of allergen specific IgE responses. [11] [12] [13] 38 The contribution of IgE to wheezing episodes among children who require hospitalization compared with asthmatic children who do not need hospitalization is difficult to judge from the current study. However, increased levels of IgE have been observed in adults hospitalized for asthma whose values were significantly higher than values from adults with stable asthma. 35 In addition, the odds for wheezing associated with sensitization to aeroallergens was recently shown to be greater among school-age children requiring hospital or emergency department care for their asthma (OR, 16.95) compared with children with stable asthma (OR, 2.09). 39 Collectively, these observations suggest that sensitization and exposure to aeroallergens may be a predisposing risk factor for an augmented response to acute infections with rhinovirus. In keeping with this, young adults with mild asthma and elevated levels of total serum IgE developed increased lower respiratory tract symptoms along with evidence for increased airway inflammation in response to an experimental rhinovirus challenge. 40 In addition, the asthmatics with higher IgE levels had evidence for increased airway inflammation and reduced lung function before viral inoculation. Moreover, in our pediatric emergency department, the strongest odds for wheezing were observed among asthmatic children who were atopic and who tested positive for virus. 14, 41 This observation was even more striking in the current study among wheezing children who were 3 to 18 years old, and it provides further evidence that the interaction between allergen-induced and virus-induced inflammation may be amplified and synergistic rather than additive.",

This has also been observed annually in our pediatric emergency department. 42 Rhinovirus infections, acquired when children return to school, have been thought to contribute to this peak. However, we did not detect a higher prevalence of rhinovirus during the fall months in this study. Moreover, the monthly pattern of admissions, especially peak admissions in the fall, was very similar among wheezing children who tested positive or negative for virus. During the fall, exposure to ragweed allergen and Alternaria increases, and significant elevations in dust mite allergen have been detected in homes of asthmatic subjects living in central Virginia. 43 In the current study, sensitization to dust mite was significantly associated with wheezing even after adjusting for sensitization to other aeroallergens. In conclusion, the children hospitalized for wheezing from the age of 3 years on had striking atopic characteristics, including levels of total serum IgE that could potentially be treated with anti-IgE antibody. Combined with observations from previous studies, 40 the results also suggest that efforts to reduce allergic airway inflammation might help children and young adults with asthma tolerate their infections with rhinovirus better.",
