Guide choices through incentives; for example, offering tax breaks for the purchase of bicycles that are used as a means of travelling to work. Guide choices through changing the default policy; for example, in a restaurant, instead of providing chips as a standard side dish (with healthier options available), menus could be changed to provide a more healthy option as standard (with chips as an option available).

However, this would be extremely difficult to enforce without compromising privacy.
