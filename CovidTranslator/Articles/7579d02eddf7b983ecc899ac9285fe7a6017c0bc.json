The VT2y toxin induced apoptosis in Vero, HeLa, CHO, CEF (primary chicken embryo fibroblast) and PCK (primary chicken kidney) cell lines. Morphological evidence (nuclear shrinkage, chromatin condensation and blebbing of the plasma membrane) of apoptosis could be distinguished in 15 min and was maximal at 1 h after treatment with VT2y. This was confirmed by the terminal dUTP nick-end-labeling (TUNEL) method. \u00df",

This acute respiratory disease observed in domestic poultry is characterized by swelling of the peri-and infra-orbital sinuses, torcicollis, opisthotonus and lack of coordination [16, 23] . Since the syndrome was described in South Africa, in 1984, there has been progressive spread to many other countries.",

VTEC strains produce one or more VTs: VT1, and several variants of VT2. The VT2v is produced by E. coli isolated from pigs with ED [11] . Recently Par-reira and Yano [20] described a novel cytotoxin called VT2y and sequencing of a 1560-bp DNA fragment of VT2y showed that it contained the STx gene of Shigella dysenteriae, but the region 300 bp upstream of the start of the gene for the STxA subunit was identical to the corresponding sequence for E. coli O111:H-, except for 1 nucleotide, suggesting that VT2y is a member of the STx family [22] .",

The most sensitive line to VT2y was Vero cells (Fig. 1) , probably due to receptor speci\u00a2city of the cells, as it is known that variants of VT2 are more cytotoxic to Vero cells than HeLa cells [4] ; the receptor for VT1 and VT2 is globotriosyl ceramide (GB3) [9] , whereas the preferred receptor for VT2v is globotetraosyl ceramide (GB4) [24] . It will be interesting to study the receptor for this toxin on the avian cells PCK and CEF, since VT2y is produced by avian E. coli strains. We also observed the presence of multiple vacuoles in the cytoplasm of these cell lines (Fig. 3C) , that simultaneously showed apoptotic features induced by VT2y cytotoxin. The microscopic nuclear fragmentation and incorporation of nucleotides shown by the TUNEL method occurred following VT-treatment of Vero cells (Fig. 4) . By performing the LDH assay we veri\u00a2ed a similar time-response using 3 CD 50 VT2y; marked apoptosis e\u00a1ects were also observed when cells were assessed using a toluidine blue assay. Based on these data, we suggest that the VT2y-induced cell death occurs by the apoptotic pathway after plasma membrane damage.",
