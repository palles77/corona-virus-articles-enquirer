            "text": "SARS-CoV (the SARS-Associated Coronavirus) was reported as a novel virus member in the coronavirus family, which was the cause of severe acute respiratory syndrome. Coronavirus replication occurs through a unique mechanism employing Leader sequence in the transcripts when initiating transcription from the genome. Therefore, we cloned the Leader sequence from SARS-CoV(BJ01), which is identical to that identified from SARS-CoV(HKU-39849), and constructed specific siRNA targeting the Leader sequence. Using EGFP and RFP reporter genes fused with the cloned SARS-CoV Leader sequence, we demonstrated that the siRNA targeting the Leader sequence decreased the mRNA abundance and protein expression levels of the reporter genes in 293T cells. By stably expressing the siRNA in Vero E6 cells, we provided data that the siRNA could effectively and specifically decrease the mRNA abundance of SARS-CoV genes as analyzed by RT-PCR and Northern blot. Our data indicated that the siRNA targeting the Leader sequence inhibited the replication of SARS-CoV in Vero E6 cells by silencing gene expression. We further demonstrated, via transient transfection experiments, that the siRNA targeting the Leader sequence had a much stronger inhibitory effect on SARS-CoV replication than the siRNAs targeting the Spike gene or the antisense oligodeoxynucleotides did. This report provides evidence that targeting Leader sequence using siRNA could be a powerful tool in inhibiting SARS-CoV replication. Gene Therapy (2005) 12, 751-761.",

            "text": "SARS-CoV (the SARS-Associated Coronavirus), which is the pathogen of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), 1,2 was reported to be a novel member in the coronavirus family. [3] [4] [5] [6] Coronaviruses belong to a family of enveloped viruses containing a single-stranded plussense RNA genome about 30 kb in length with a 5 0 cap structure and a 3 0 polyadenylation tract. 7 In addition to the genomic RNA, virus-infected cells possess subgenomic mRNAs that form a 3 0 coterminal nested set with the genome. The genomic and the subgenomic mRNAs of coronaviruses include an identical 5 0 Leader sequence and common 3 0 -ends, which is a unique characteristic in coronavirus and arterivirus replication. 8 In the process of coronavirus replication, the Leader sequence (from the subgenome) is fused to the mRNA body sequence. The mechanism by which these subgenomic mRNAs are made is not fully understood. However, recent evidence indicates that transcriptionregulating sequences (TRSs) at the 5 0 -end of each gene represent signals that regulate the discontinuous transcription of subgenomic mRNAs. 9, 10 Nevertheless, the Leader sequence and the TRSs play critical roles in the gene expression of coronavirus during its replication. 9, 10 By analysis and comparison of the genome sequences of SARS-CoV [11] [12] [13] [14] and other coronaviruses, authors predicted 11, 12 and confirmed 15 a putative 5 0 Leader sequence with similarity to the conserved coronavirus core Leader sequence, 5 0 -CUAAAC-3 0 , 9,10 at the 5 0 -end of the genome. Putative conserved TRS sequences AAAC GAAAC were determined through manual alignment of sequences upstream of potential initiating methionine codons with the region of the coronavirus genome sequence containing the Leader sequence. These predictions suggested that SARS-CoV possessed a similar genome structure and underwent similar replication processes to those of other typical coronaviruses. 11, 12 Therefore, it is of interest to search for a way to block virus replication based on this common feature of the coronavirus.",

Therefore, choosing a unique sequence in the SARS-CoV genome will be critical for the successful inhibition of the virus. In this report, we propose to target the Leader sequence of SARS-CoV, which is identical in all SARS-CoV and plays a pivotal role in the gene expression of the virus.

To clone the Leader sequence predicted from BJ01 SARS CoV, we performed 5 0 -RACE experiments to confirm the Leader sequence. We then used RT-PCR to obtain the cDNA of the transcripts of different genes of BJ01 SARS-CoV from infected Vero E6 cells. After sequencing, we observed the identical Leader sequence upstream of the ATGs in the different genes ( Figure 1a , GenBank accession numbers AY539954, AY536757, AY536758, AY536759, AY536760), suggesting that the transcripts of different genes in BJ01 SARS-CoV recruited the identical Leader sequence, which is consistent with the report from HKU-39849. 15 The data indicated that the transcript of the S protein contained the Leader sequence directly upstream of the ATG, while the transcripts of other proteins had different nucleotide bases between the ATG and the conserved Leader sequence (eg M protein has 44 more base pairs) ( Figure  1a ). Intriguingly, this Leader sequence was highly conserved between different strains of SARS-CoV, while the other sequences coding for the specific proteins such as S, N, M and E contained various mutations between the different strains (Table 1) . According to this information, the sequence of CCAACCAACCTCGATCTC was selected and designed as the siRNA target for the proper GC/AT ratio and CC structure. To generate the dsRNA based on this sequence, we employed the U6 promoter vector 33 and constructed a 22 bp siRNA through the hairpin (Figure 1b) . The expected hairpin RNA is depicted in Figure 1c .",

We inserted the Leader sequence of SARS-CoV upstream of the first ATG of GFP after the EF-1a promoter (Figure 2a . These data indicate that we can generate GFP or RFP mRNAs with the SARS-CoV Leader sequences from vectors with either the EF-1a or CMV promoter. The RT-PCR results show that the EF-1a or CMV promoter initiated the transcription of mRNA of GFP or RFP with a SARS-CoV Leader sequence (Figure 2b ). We questioned whether these mRNAs could be translated into GFP or RFP proteins. To test this probability, we directly tested the expression of GFP and RFP using a fluorescence microscope in cells transfected with the vectors. The data show that all four vectors could express GFP or RFP properly (Figure 4b) , suggesting that the Leader sequence ahead of the ATG of GFP or RFP did not affect the translation of proteins. Therefore, we directly observed the proteins produced by the mRNA with the Leader sequence. These vectors therefore provided us a model to study degradation of mRNAs using a Leader sequence of SARS-CoV targeting by siRNA. . These data suggest that siRNA targeting the Leader sequence of SARS-CoV specifically led to a decrease in mRNA levels of L-GFP or L-RFP generated by the pEFBos or pDsRed1.1 vectors, implying that siRNA targeting the Leader sequence mediated degradation of mRNA produced by the transfected vectors.",

Therefore, targeting the Leader sequence present in the mRNA of SARS-CoV structural genes, should be a powerful way to control virus replication. Interestingly, we analyzed all the strains of SARS-CoV identified to date and found that the Leader sequence remained almost identical (see Table  1 ). With these advantages, we designed the siRNA to target this Leader sequence of SARS-CoV. Our data show that the siRNA could not only block the expression of a reporter gene fused with the Leader sequence but also inhibited the expressions of SARS-CoV genes in Vero E6 cells, and thereafter inhibited the replication of the SARS-CoV in Vero E6 cells. We proposed that this would be a powerful tool to prevent SARS-CoV infections in vivo.",

[9] [10] [11] [12] 15 In this report, we cloned the transcripts of the four genes from SARS-CoV BJ01 and confirmed the SARS-CoV Leader sequence as CCAGGAAAAGCCAACCAACCTCGA TCTCTTGTAGATCTGTTCTCTAAACGAAC, which is in line with the report on the HKU-39849 strain. 15 Our observations revealed that this Leader sequence was identical and present in the different genes of SARS-CoV. Our data further indicated that the sequence between the identical Leader sequence and ATG in different transcripts was variable. The S gene has no space between the common Leader sequence and ATG, and the M gene has the longest spacer sequence. This implied that the common Leader sequence had different merging sites to the sequence of different genes in SARS-CoV. Importantly, we observed that this Leader sequence was identical in different strains of SARS-CoV identified to date (Table 1) , while the other sequences of SARS-CoV showed variations. 11, 12, 14, 44, 45 To evaluate the efficiency of the siRNA, we used the GFP and RFP reporter genes fused with the Leader sequence of SARS-CoV. We proved that the mRNA fused with the Leader sequence did not affect the translation of the GFP and RFP proteins in the cultured cells. As expected, our data showed that the siRNA could block the expression of the reporter genes with the Leader sequence, while it had no effect on those without the Leader sequence. Consistent results were obtained by direct observation of the GFP and RFP proteins using fluorescence microscopy and Western blot analysis. This simple observation model can be used to show the effects of siRNA on the transcription of genes with Leader sequence in other laboratories.",

Therefore, designing an siRNA targeting several genes should provide better inhibition of virus replication. To this aim, the Leader sequence in SARS-CoV provided a very useful target because it is part of the mRNAs of each gene critical to SARS-CoV replication. Indeed, our experiments showed that siRNA targeting the Leader sequence was more effective than siRNA for the S gene. Also, our data indicated that the siRNA targeting the Leader sequence was powerful compared to antisense oligodeoxynucleotides.

The data show that both GFP driven by pEFBos/L-GFP and RFP driven by pDsRed1.1/RFP were expressed strongly in the cells in the presence of pBS/U6/S-RNAi, a vector generating siRNA targeting the S gene of SARS-CoV 31(Figure 4b), while only RFP was strong but GFP was weak in the cells (transfected with pEFBos/L-GFP and pDsRed1.1/RFP) in the presence of pBS/U6/L-RNAi(Figure 4Ad-f), suggesting that the siRNA targeting the Leader sequence blocked GFP expression from the vector where the GFP gene was linked to the Leader sequence. Parallel to L-GFP, we also investigated L-RFP expression in cells cotransfected with pDsRed1.1/L-RFP and pEFBos/GFP (internal control) with pBS/U6/L-RNAi (Figure 4A) or pBS/U6/S-RNAi (Figure 4B). The data confirmed that RFP was dramatically decreased in the cells transfected with pDsRed1.1/ L-RFP and pEFBos/GFP in the presence of pBS/U6/L-RNAi(Figure 4Ag), while GFP protein was expressed at similar levels in the same cells(Figure 4Ah), suggesting that the siRNA inhibited the expression of RFP from pDsRed1.1/L-RFP plasmid, where the Leader sequence of SARS-CoV was upstream of the RFP, but did not effect the expression of GFP driven by pEFBos/GFP in the same cells. Importantly, pBS/U6/L-RNAi did not have any affect on the expression of either RFP or GFP proteins driven by the constructs without the Leader sequence of SARS-CoV (Figure 4Aa-c). As an additional control, pBS/U6/S-RNAi was shown to have no effect on the expression levels of RFP and GFP proteins (Figure 4b). All the data indicate that the siRNA could specifically and effectively block the expression of the reporter genes fused with the Leader sequence of SARS-CoV.To measure the protein levels of GFP in the cells, we employed Western blot analysis. The results show that GFP protein levels were decreased significantly in the presence of a pBS/U6/L-RNAi vector(Figure 5a, lane 1), while they did not change in the other situations (Figure 5a, lanes 2-6). These data are consistent and supportive of those observed by fluorescence microscopy. Furthermore, to determine whether the inhibition of the siRNA on reporter gene expression is dependent on the amount of the siRNA, we used three different dosages of the pBS/U6/L-RNAi plasmid (0.2, 0.5 and 1.0 mg) cotransfected with 0.5 mg of pEFBos/L-GFP. Western blot analysis suggests that the GFP protein levels decreased gradually with increasing amounts of pBS/U6/L-RNAi plasmid (Figure 5b). Intriguingly, 1.0 mg of pBS/U6/L-RNAi plasmid almost totally inhibited the expression of the reporter gene, indicating that the siRNA effectively silenced the expression of the reporter gene with the Leader sequence from SARS-CoV. Fluorescence microscopy observation of reporter gene expression in transfected cells. 293T cells were cotransfected with the reporter constructs and the pBS/U6/L-RNAi (A) or pBS/U6/S-RNAi (B) vector. The reporter constructs used are a, b and c, and j, k and l: pEFBos/GFP and pDsRed1.1/RFP; d, e and f, and m, n and o: PEFBos/L-GFP and pDsRed1.1/RFP; g, h and i, and p, q and r: pDsRed1.1/L-RFP and PEFBos/GFP. The same field was observed by red color (excitation, 510-560 nm; emission, 590 nm) and green color (excitation, 450-490 nm; emission, 520 nm) and the two color pictures were merged in the right panel. Note that pBS/U6/L-RNAi significantly inhibited reporter gene expression (e and g). Western blot analysis of GFP protein expression in transfected cells. (a) pEFBos/L-GFP or pEFBos/GFP vector was cotransfected with pBS/U6/L-RNAi, pBS/U6 or pBS/U6/S-RNAi in Vero E6 cells as indicated. The cells were lysed and subjected to Western blot using anti-GFP antibody. b-actin was used as internal control to indicate even transfection efficiency and loading. (b) pEFBos/L-GFP (0.5 mg) were cotransfected with the indicated increasing amounts of pBS/U6/L-RNAi in Vero E6 cells. Western blot was employed to show the expression of GFP protein. Note that the GFP protein decreased dramatically with increasing amounts of pBS/U6/L-RNAi used, while the b-actin level remained stable. SARS-CoV inhibits virus replication T Li et al Inhibition of SARS-CoV by pBS/U6/L-RNAi in Vero E6 cells To study the inhibition of SARS-CoV by the designed siRNA (pBS/U6/L-RNAi), we subcloned the U6/L-RNAi cassette into pcDNA3, which contained Neo gene, and selected stable cell clones for constant expression of siRNA by G418 selection. As controls, we selected cell clones with pcDNA3/U6 or pcDNA3/U6/GFP-RNAi. Inhibition of SARS-CoV gene expression by siRNA in Vero E6 cells. (a) Establishment of stable cell lines with the siRNA. Vero E6 cells were transfected with the indicated plasmids. The cells were selected with G418 and the clones were examined by PCR with specific primers described in Materials and methods. The cells were named using the recombinant U6, U6/GFP-RNAi or U6/L-RNAi, respectively. The positive control was from the cells transiently transfected with pBS/U6/L-RNAi. (b) L-RNAi inhibits different gene expression of SARS-CoV in stable cell lines detected by RT-PCR. The PCR reaction condition was cycles (S gene, 30; E gene, 27; M gene, 27; N gene, 25; N-fl, 25) of denaturation (941C, 30 s), annealing (511C, 45 s) and extension (721C: S gene, 1 min; E gene 25 s; M gene 45 s; N gene, 1 min 20 s; N-fl, 1 min 45 s).The indicated stable cell lines in 60 mm dishes were infected with SARS-CoV (BJ01) at 1 \u00c2 10 6 PFU for 2 h and cultured for 24 h. The total RNA of the cell lysates was used for the RT-PCR. b-actin was used as internal control for same PCR cycles and loading. The different gene fragments are labeled as S, E, M, N and N-fl, respectively. Note that the amounts of the PCR products were dramatically decreased in the stable cell line with U6/L-RNAi.
