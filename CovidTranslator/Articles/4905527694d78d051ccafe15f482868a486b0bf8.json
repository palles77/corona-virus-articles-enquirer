Since the resonances of SUD-N were assigned as a group (see text), the NOEs are plotted in the order of increasing values of I rel . Right panel: SUD-M domain, where the data are plotted versus the (a) Overlay of the 2D [ 15 N, 1 H]-HSQC spectra of SUD-MC in the absence (red) and presence (blue) of (GGA) 4 at an RNA:protein ratio of 0.5:1. (b) 2D [ 15 N, 1 H]-HSQC spectrum of SUD-C. This spectrum is shown here as a reference, to facilitate the identification of peaks originating from SUD-C in panel (a). (c) Plot versus the amino acid sequences of chemical shift perturbations, \u0394\u03b4, induced by (GGA) 4binding to SUD-M (red) and SUD-MC (blue) at an RNA:protein ratio of 0.2:1. (d) Spacefilling view of SUD-M visualizing the surface locations of chemical shift perturbations induced by adding 0.2 equivalents of (GGA) 4 to SUD-MC. The residues with \u0394\u03b4 \u2265 0.03 are colored green, and are labeled. (e) Plot versus the amino acid sequence of the decrease of the [ 15 N, 1 H]-HSQC peak intensities, \u0394(S/N), in SUD-MC after addition of 0.5 equivalents of (GGA) 4 . \u0394(S/N) is equal to the difference between the signal:noise ratios of the correlation peaks in the presence and absence of (GGA) 4 , respectively. Since it is unlikely that line broadening due to slow ligand exchange would affect all resonances of the SUD-M domain, the observations in panel (e) appear to indicate formation of higher aggregates mediated by the RNA binding. In these aggregates only the SUD-M domains would appear to be immobilized, whereas the SUD-C domains seem to retain mobility within the aggregate so that they do not experience significant line broadening. Codon-optimized DNA sequences used for the production of the SUD proteins used in this study. Restriction enzyme sites derived from the vectors and used to clone the constructs (5': NdeI, 3': HindIII) are in italics. Protease recognition sites (thrombin in SUD-MC, TEV protease in all other constructs) are underlined. For SUD-C, the additional thrombin cleavage site derived from pET-28b precedes the S7 construct and is not shown. Stop codons were added at the 3'-end of each construct, immediately preceding the HindIII restriction site.",
