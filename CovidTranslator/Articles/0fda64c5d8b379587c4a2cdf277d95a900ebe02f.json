However, established methods for fragment detection do not address the central question in fragment-based ligand discovery: how can a primary ligand be optimally extended by a secondary fragment? Dynamic screening methods solve this issue by using a protein target as a template for ligand assembly, thus yielding high-affinity binders from low-affinity fragments. This review summarizes recent work on dynamic screening methodology, which resulted in the development of several high-affinity binders for various targets. Strengths and limitations of the published approaches are discussed and possible contributions of dynamic screening methodology to the drug discovery process are highlighted.",

However, the actual output of research and development (R&D) has been described as insufficient in proportion to the investment made. For example, in 2006 the overall spending on biopharmaceutical R&D reached a record of $55.2 billion in North America. In the same year the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved only 22 new molecular entities (NMEs) and biologics. In contrast, in 1996 some 53 NMEs were approved for clinical use, although R&D expenditure in 1996 was less than half the amount spent in 2006. 1 This discrepancy has been termed a 'compound crisis' and it has been postulated that it results from inefficient methods in drug discovery summarized as an 'innovation deficit' [2] [3] [4] [5] . Thus, it is apparent that the pharmaceutical industry must improve its R&D productivity by using new technologies for the development of NMEs.",

Therefore, small contributions from molecular fragments can add up to yield a high-affinity protein ligand (Figure 1b) [6] . First, a small molecule fragment that binds to the protein pocket of interest is identified. The starting fragment is then chemically modified to generate a binder of higher affinity, which is subsequently further optimized to a lead structure (Figure 1b) . The concept has become very popular for two main reasons. First, there are much fewer fragments than drug-sized molecules. Rough estimates indicate that approximately 10 7 fragments with up to 12 heavy atoms do exist (excluding 3-and 4-ring-containing structures) [7] , whereas there are 10 63 possible small druglike molecules with up to 30 heavy atoms [8] . For comparison, only approximately 10 8 molecules have been synthesized to date [9] . Thus, initial screening of fragment libraries is expected to sample the chemical space much more efficiently than traditional approaches ever could.",

            "text": "The second reason is that fragment-derived lead structures have significantly higher ligand efficiency (free binding energy per non-hydrogen atom of the ligand) than molecules discovered by screening of large compound libraries. An investigation of 150 known natural and synthetic ligands revealed that the free binding energy increased in proportion to ligand size up to a maximum of 15 atoms [10, 11] . The maximum average free-energy contribution per heavy atom was -1.5 kcal/mol. For molecules larger than this, no further increase in ligand efficiency was observed [12] . These observations confirm how crucial limiting the molecular size is for the efficiency of protein ligands, thereby supporting the preference of fragment hits (<12 heavy atoms per molecule) over typical HTS hits. These results also indicate easier optimization and hit-to-lead development of fragment hits relative to that of HTS hits. [13] . Weakly binding ligands are difficult to detect. In general, four main biophysical techniques have been used for this task: NMR spectroscopy [14, 15] , X-ray crystallography [16, 17] , surface plasmon resonance [18] and isothermal titration calorimetry [19, 20] . Major bottlenecks of these biophysical techniques are their high protein consumption, the need for expensive detection equipment and their limited throughput. Moreover, the methods do not solve the other challenging question in fragment-based discovery, i.e. how can two low-affinity binders be linked optimally to yield a high-affinity binder [21] ? Biophysical methods do not provide information regarding the optimal bioactive combination of fragments.",

            "text": "There are significant differences in dynamic templateassisted strategies, which largely determine their practical use in drug discovery. One major criterion is the amount of protein required for fragment detection. Some of the strategies, such as DCC [23, 24] , pDCC [32] , and TGS [40] , require near-stoichiometric or stoichiometric protein quantities, whereas more recently developed strategies, such as DCR [29] , SAS [41] and DLS [44] , use the protein template in only catalytic amounts. A second relevant criterion is the detection technology required. In DCC, tethering, DCR, pDCC, and TGS, fragment identification relies on NMR spectroscopy [29] , chromatography [22, 25, 32, 40, 46] , X-ray crystallography [47] or mass Fragment-based lead discovery. The binding of small molecular fragments to the protein is detected. Low-affinity fragments can be linked to provide high-affinity ligands. However, detection and linkage of these fragments are difficult tasks. The physicochemical basis of fragment-based drug discovery is indicated below. The free binding energy DG8 AB of a protein ligand results from the additive contributions of its molecular components (A and B) [6] . The binding constant K AB is an exponential function of the binding energy. (c) Dynamic strategies in fragment-based drug discovery. Reactive fragments are incubated with the protein and form specific combinations of fragments on the protein template, which facilitates fragment detection and linkage to a new ligand.",

They created an imine library by condensing a diamine ( Figure 2b ) that was derived from Tamiflu -a known inhibitor of neuraminidase, a key influenza virus enzyme -with 41 different ketones. For detection of enzyme activity, the imines formed were reduced to the corresponding amines by addition of NaCNBH 3 and the resulting set of amines was analyzed by HPLC. High-affinity binders of neuraminidase were identified by comparing HPLC chromatograms for reactions containing the template with controls. However, in this particular application of the DCC concept the relative amplification of fragment combinations did not correspond to the binding affinities of the compounds identified ( Figure 2b ) [46, 48] . For example, the compound exhibiting the greatest amplification was not a potent inhibitor, whereas amplification of the strongest inhibitor obtained from this screen was three-fold less. There are a number of possible explanations for this observation. In particular, the final reduction reaction can distort the results in two ways. Amines, which are derived from chemically more stable imines, are expected to be preferentially formed, irrespective of the protein template. Second, reduction of a strongly binding imine can yield an amine product with poorer binding properties.",

Their approach exploits a reversible disulfide exchange reaction on the surface of a protein [25, 49] . For disulfide ligation, native cysteine residues can be used; alternatively, these can be engineered in proximity to the site of interest [26, 28] or added by a cross-linking reaction [27] . Thiol fragments that bind tightly in the screened pocket will form a stable disulfide with the cysteine residue of the protein or the thiol-containing cross-linker. The key advantage of tethering is the ability to focus on a particular region of the template. For example, in the case of caspase-3, the cross-linker, a derivative of aspartate, was bound covalently to the enzyme and the cross-linked capase-3 was incubated with 7000 disulfides. The thiol group of the cross-linker interacted with the disulfides by exchange reaction. Disulfides that fit to capase-3 are preferentially formed. The most stabile disulfide-enzyme complex could be detected by high-resolution mass spectrometry, from which a potent caspase-3 inhibitor could be obtained ( Figure 3) .",

The proof of principle for this approach was provided by a nitroaldol reaction (the socalled Henry reaction), in which b-nitro alcohols were reversibly formed by addition of nitroalkanes to carbonyl compounds. On addition of the selector, in this case the lipase PS-C I from Pseudomonas cepacia, library members that could fit into the active site of the lipase were acylated (Figure 4b ) and subsequently identified by 1 H-NMR [29] . In an example of DCR, a dynamic nitroaldol library was formed by Henry reaction for five aldehydes and one nitroalkane component. Selective recognition of one of the secondary alcohols formed by the selector lipase PS-C I led to enantioselective formation of two ester products [29] . (c) In pDCC, a library of dipeptides was formed from resin-bound active esters (left). All dipeptides could be cleaved by the non-selective peptidase pronase. Only dipeptides binding to the carbonic anhydrase protein template were partially protected against hydrolysis and were amplified in an iterative process [32] .",

However, as above, one major disadvantage is the difficulty in detecting the best fragment combinations by NMR, which limits the possible library size. Another limitation is the restricted applicability, which is confined to chemical libraries for which a cleavage reaction can be established. For example, in the case of DCR, the choice of selector templates is confined to relatively few enzymes such as lipases, preventing broader applicability of this particular approach for drug discovery. However, only catalytic amounts of the selector protein are required, which constitutes a clear advantage over DCC. Similar to DCR, pDCC is also confined to specific chemicals. Dipeptides, as demonstrated here, are ideal for establishing the concept; however, they are not very likely drug leads. Thus, in summary these approaches, although conceptually interesting, are less likely to be widely used in drug lead discovery.",

Here, high substrate turnover indicated high affinity of the respective substrate fragments. In the case of cathepsin S, a non-peptidic substrate could be identified.

The strength of this method is its ability to efficiently identify substrate structures that bind to the active site. The use of protein in only catalytic amounts contributes to its efficiency. However, SAS requires the catalytic function of enzymatic drug targets, such as proteases or protein tyrosine phosphatases, and therefore cannot be applied more generally to other types of drug targets. The approach is further restricted by the limited availability of substrate libraries, which are not commercially available and have to be synthesized on a case-by-case basis. Moreover, the classical rationale of fragment-based drug discovery, i.e. to connect several low-affinity binders for specific pockets, is not applied in SAS. Another drawback is that the substrates discovered have to be converted into useful inhibitors. For example, in the case of cathepsin S, the substrate fluorophore was replaced with an aliphatic aldehyde, which is less suitable in a drug. Similarly, for phosphatase inhibitors, replacement of the phosphate by a mimetic such as isothiazolidine or isoxazole carboxylic acid [53] resulted in adverse effects, such as lower selectivity and cell permeability.",

For site-directed identification of inhibitory fragments, an activity assay for SARS-CoV M pro was first developed using a peptidic substrate ( Figure 6 ). Enzymatic cleavage of the peptidic substrate released a fluorophore, which served as an indicator for protease activity. The chemically reactive protein ligand, a peptide aldehyde [45, 54] , was then incubated with an excess of a nucleophilic fragment in the presence of the enzyme. Following addition of the fluorogenic substrate, rate differences in substrate turnover were quantified to identify active inhibitory fragments. For SARS-CoV M pro , one fragment was identified that showed considerably stronger inhibition in presence of the peptide aldehyde than the peptide aldehyde inhibitor alone. The fragment alone showed no significant activity against the SARS enzyme. To verify the result, the fragment identified was converted by chemical synthesis into an electrophile, which was shown to be an active inhibitor of SARS-CoV M pro and was used as a new chemically reactive protein ligand. Thus, the DLS approach was repeated with the newly identified electrophile to identify a new nucleophile fragment. Covalent linkage of the new electrophile to the fragment identified yielded an active, Figure 5 . Overview of the first applications of substrate activity screening (SAS).
