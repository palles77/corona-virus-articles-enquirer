The radiological manifestations in disease progression they got were that radiological aggravation of initial image was observed in 65.7% (163/248) of patients on day 7 after onset of symptoms, 94.5% (154/163) of patients showed radiological improvement on day 14 (1), which means that the patients had a typical transition from early stage to advanced stage, and then from advanced stage to dissipating stage. We would like to share the progression of computed tomographic (CT) images in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia in our hospital after hospital discharge.",

The average CT follow-up time is 30.5 days (range, 24 to 38 days) after the initial hospital admission and 15.8 days after discharge (range, 7 to 25 days). The CT features were evaluated by two experienced radiologists in consensus, the CT characteristics include ground-glass opacities, interstitial thickening, and consolidation, and fibrosis (parenchymal band, traction bronchiectasis, and irregular interfaces). The demographics, length of stay (LOS) in hospital, and rate of intensive care unit (ICU) were also analyzed to evaluate the progression.",
