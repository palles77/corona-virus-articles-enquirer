(HCT) that have been illustrated in the literature and to explore new fields in which HCT could be used in the future. The use of HCT has been described in broad inflammatory domains, where it has exhibited a variety of activities, including antiviral, antibacterial, antiparasitic and immunostimulant activity, with high efficiency, mild features and definite therapeutic effects. The numerous anti-inflammatory functions of HCT have demonstrated that HCT has wide application prospects. New uses of HCT and the full extent of its utilization await further investigation. The basic pathological change of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is synovial proliferation which leads to joint destruction in the long-term. There are types of drugs that have been used clinically for patients with RA, however, due to their side-effects or high prices their broad usage is limited. A safe and low-cost drug is urgently required to be developed for the clinical usage of patients with RA. Thus, HCT has the potential to be a good candidate in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis.",

            "text": "Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). SARS is a life-threatening type of pneumonia caused by the SARS coronavirus. From late 2002 to mid 2003, the SARS virus infected >8,000 people worldwide. An aqueous extract of HCT demonstrated a significant stimulatory effect on the proliferation of mouse splenic lymphocytes, and this effect was found to be dose-dependent (11) . HCT also showed an inhibitory effect on symptoms such as fever, sore throat and cough presented in the early stage of SARS (12) . Lau et al (11) used flow cytometry to reveal that HCT increased the proportion of CD4 + and CD8 + T cells in mouse splenic lymphocytes. Moreover, it significantly increased the secretion of interleukin (IL)-2 and IL-10. In order to investigate the anti-inflammatory activity of HCT that is purported to underlie its anti-SARS effects, Lu et al (1) examined the effects of HCT injection (HCI) in the rat carrageenan-induced pleurisy model and the mouse xylene-induced ear edema model. In the pleurisy model, the injection of carrageenan into the pleural cavity resulted in protein-rich fluid accumulation and leukocyte infiltration in the pleural cavity, with the peak inflammatory response occurring after 24 h, when the fluid volume, protein concentration, C-reactive protein and cell infiltration were maximal. These parameters were attenuated by HCI at various doses, with the strongest inhibitory effect occurring at a dose of 0.54 ml/100 g. HCI exhibited similar effects in the mice ear edema model, with 50% inhibition at a dose of 80 \u00b5l/20 g. The results clearly indicate that HCI has anti-inflammatory activity against the SARS coronavirus. (13) (14) (15) have demonstrated that NF-\u03baB activation plays a significant role in the replication of HSV-1 and HSV-2. HSV infection is efficiently suppressed by the inhibition of NF-\u03baB activation. Chen et al (16) found that an aqueous extract of HCT (HCWE) had anti-herpetic activity against HSV-2 and HSV-1 infection, and that this activity was associated with an inhibitory effect on NF-\u03baB pathway activation.",

It was observed that the oral administration of HCWE inhibited systemic anaphylaxis in mice as well as the local allergic reaction activated by anti-dinitrophenyl IgE antibody in rats. The authors also found that HCWE dose-dependently inhibited histamine release and calcium uptake by rat peritoneal mast cells. HCWE increased the intracellular level of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) and markedly reduced mast cell activator-induced cAMP expression. These results indicate that HCWE may be useful for the prevention of mast cell-mediated anaphylactic response. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) have been shown to be significantly efficacious in the treatment of various inflammatory disorders. NSAIDs function by binding to cyclooxygenase enzymes to inhibit the production of prostaglandins from the substrate arachidonic acid. A study showed that Houttuynia cordata supercritical extract (HSE) was able to reduce the production of tumor-necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1 and prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) in a carrageenan-air pouch model of inflammation in mice, which indicates that HSE exerts anti-inflammatory effects by inhibiting TNF-\u03b1 and cyclooxygenase II-PGE2 pathways (25, 26) . Therefore, HSE is a potential drug candidate for the relief of various types of inflammation that are responsive to NSAIDs. Thus, it may be useful for reducing the symptoms associated with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), without the marked gastrointestinal side-effects of NSAIDs. Studies have also indicated that HCT is able to efficiently inhibit IL-6, IL-8 and TNF-\u03b1 production (27, 28) .",

            "text": "The continuous ingestion of a probiotic fermented four-herb combination (PFH) including HCT has been found to markedly increase lysozymal activity in the serum and spleen, in addition to increasing peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) proliferation, the CD4 + :CD8 + T-lymphocyte ratio in the spleen, and antibody production levels in broiler chicks (29) . Conversely, PGE2 synthesis in serum and PBMC culture medium was significantly decreased in the PFH-fed chicks in comparison with that in the control group in a dose-dependent manner. When the chicks were experimentally infected with Salmonella gallinarum, feeding with 2% PFH delayed mortality. Furthermore, the survival rate in the 2% PFH-fed group was higher than that in the 1% PFH-fed group and the control group throughout the experimental period. These findings suggest that PFH enhances immune activity in broiler chicks and increases the survival of experimentally infected broiler chicks, possibly by stimulating nonspecific immune responses. Therefore, probiotics and herbs including HCT may provide an alternative to antibiotics and could avoid the development of antibiotic-resistant bacteria by promoting immune activity and preventing disease. Moreover, Lee et al found HCT showed an efficient immunomodulation effect (30) . In one study, the usefulness of HCT fractions as an ethnopharmacological treatment for Th2-mediated inflammation was reported to occur through the downregulation of the production of Th2 cytokines (31) .",
