            "text": "A common route for viral recognition and entry utilizes glycosylated envelope proteins that have affinity for host cell-surface proteins (Dimitrov, 2004) . The evolutionary development of viral glycosylation as a mechanism to both enhance viral uptake and evade host organism defenses has resulted in a co-evolution of lectins specific to non-self carbohydrate structures. The glycosylation of viral envelope glycoproteins is sequence driven, requiring spontaneous mutation and loss of oligosaccharide-attachment sites to avoid lectin recognition ( Fig. 1) (Balzarini et al., 2004a) . Such depletion of the glycocalyx surrounding envelope glycoproteins can have deleterious effects on viral fitness (Kolchinsky et al., 2001) . The continuing challenges in enabling broad spectrum viral suppression support the study of lectins as viral entry inhibitors to A) The crystal structure of glycosylated gp120 monomer from HIV-1 clade G using the coordinates from PDBID: 5FYJ. gp120 is rendered in cartoon with surface in grey. The glycans are rendered in light green and red. The glycan positions rendered in red have been demonstrated to affect antiviral lectin activity of GRFT, CV-N, and SVN. B) Schematic of high-mannose for definition and discussion purposes. GlcNAc and mannose are represented as blue squares and green circles, respectively. The branches of the highmannose structure are referred to as D1 for mannose 2e4, D2 for mannose 6 and 7 and D3 for mannose 8 and 9. provide prophylactic and potentially therapeutic agents against viral infections. Antiviral lectins interact predominantly with high-mannose glycan structures added as post-translational modifications to the envelope proteins of viruses (O'Keefe et al., 2000; Botos and Wlodawer, 2003; Bokesch et al., 2003) . The envelope proteins share sequence homology across enveloped viruses, adopt similar tertiary and quaternary structure, and perform equivalent functions ( Fig. 2B ) (Pancera et al., 2014; Kirchdoerfer et al., 2016; Zhao et al., 2016) . Using HIV as an example, the Env protein complex is composed of a transmembrane trimer of gp41 and extracellular trimer of gp120 ( Fig. 2A ) (Pinter et al., 1989; Earl et al., 1990) . Each of these envelope proteins contain N-linked oligosaccharide attachment sites (defined by the consensus amino acid sequence eNXS/T-) which, when glycosylated, assist in viral evasion of the host immune system (Figs. 1 and 2C) (Stewart-Jones et al., 2016) . The Env protein complex mediates attachment to and entry into target cells first through recognition of CD4 \u00fe initiating a cascade of conformation reorganization of the Env protein complex that ultimately leads to the fusion of the viral envelope with the host cellular membrane and infection ( Fig. 2D ) (Jones et al., 1998; Davenport et al., 2015) . Lectins are considered HIV entry inhibitors as they interact with the glycosylation moieties of the Env protein complex preventing the conformational rearrangements required for viral fusion (Barrientos et al., 2006) . Antiviral lectins generally contain internal repeats within their primary sequences each comprising a carbohydrate recognition domain (CRD). The duplication of binding domains provides a mechanism for increased avidity for branched carbohydrate structures. The sequence identity of lectins ranges from~10 to 100% across genera with the greatest variability localized to the loop regions that contribute to the CRD for some classes. Sequence homology is found predominantly in the core structural components of the lectin. Disulfide bonds are present in some antiviral lectin structures, but are not a prerequisite. Specifically, CV-N, SVN, and AH contain disulfide bonds that are within single domains and/or between domains. The lectins are also known to oligomerize, although it is also not a prerequisite. Some lectins form dimers, trimers or tetramers in solution, while others are seen as monomers (OAA, SVN, AH, and PCL) (Tables 2, 4 and 6). Finally, certain members of the lectins discussed herein utilize strand exchange and domain swapping to stabilize the oligomeric state such as the C-terminal strand exchange seen in the b-prism type I and II folds and domain swap as seen in CV-N.",

Specifically, some antiviral lectins interact only with the high mannose oligosaccharide components Man-9, Man-7 and Man-4, some with entire glycan branches (D1, D2, or D3), and some interact with the core galactose containing chitobiose unit as well as D1 or D3 branches (Figs. 1 and 3; Tables 2, 4 and 6). The differences in CRD orientation can result in lectins demonstrating a A) X-ray crystal structures of trimeric Env are rendered in ribbon with each monomer of gp41/120 shown in orange, grey, or green. B) The HIV (4TVP), SARS (5I08), and Ebola (5JQB) Env proteins are rendered in the same fashion, but viewed orthogonally along the three-fold symmetry axis to highlight structural conservation between viruses.

D) CD4:gp120 were modelled on the Env trimer to demonstrate what the recognition complex would look like (5CAY and 4TVP). substantial decrease in affinity when binding linear vs branched oligomannose structures, suggesting that the position, distance, and orientation of sugar units in space is important for lectin specificity.",

            "text": "Analysis of the various antiviral lectin CRDs covered in this review reveals that many of the interactions are predominantly derived from hydrogen bonding between protein backbone and/or side chain atoms and oxygen atoms within the oligosaccharides. The Jacalin-like antiviral lectins utilize a trio of aromatic residues that provide the interior walls of the CRDs and in some instances the side chains of tyrosine and tryptophan may participate in direct interactions with the oligosaccharide. The lectins belonging to the OAAH family have a conserved consensus CRD sequence with residue side chains and backbone that participate in hydrogen bonding with the glycans. Analysis of the frequency of residues that participate in direct interactions with the oligosaccharides, either through back bone or side chain hydrogen bonding, reveals that aspartate and glutamate are most prevalent at 16.66% and 14.29%, respectively (Fig. 4) . This is consistent with the types of lectin:glycan interactions identified through NMR titration and x-ray cocrystallization experiments. The less prevalent hydrophobic residues provide hydrogen bonding interactions specifically through backbone amide and carbonyl oxygen.",

The 114 residue protein has a molecular weight of~12.5 kDa and contains 3 CRDs defined by internal repeats: R1 1e38, R2 39e77, and R3 78e114. AH is unusual among anti-HIV lectins in that it has a basic isoelectric point of 8.3. The protein is expressed as a proprotein with an N-terminal signal peptide that is subsequently cleaved revealing the mature 114 residue lectin. The lectin is active against HIV-1 and HIV-2 with IC 50 values of 2e110 nM in the MAGI assay and inhibited cell-cell fusion with EC 50 values ranging from 60 to 700 nM (Chiba et al., 2004) . The x-ray crystal structures of AH reveal that the protein is organized into a Ricin B-chain-like b-trefoil with a1,2-mannotriose bound in each CRD located between the second and third b strands of the carbohydrate binding site (Zhang et al., 2014) . Specifically, the side chains of D15, Y23, and N28 hydrogen bond with O3 and O4 of M2 of the trimannose ligand.

This lectin has been the focus of much research as evidenced by more than 200 published papers. The protein contains 101 residues with a molecular weight of 11 kDa with monomeric and dimeric crystal forms and in solution. The protein adopts a unique fold comprised of a tandem repeat, defined by R1 1e50 and R2 51e101 (31.1% sequence identity), adopting a three-stranded b-sheet with b-hairpins and has exhibited a domain-swapped dimer in various crystal and solution structures (Botos and Wlodawer, 2003; Yang et al., 1999) . The structure of CV-N co-crystallized with oligomannose-9 revealed extensive interactions with the outer branches of high-mannose glycan. Specifically, K3 and E101 side chains hydrogen bond to O2 and O3 of M4, M3 interacts with the carbonyl of G2 and K53, the amide of N93, and the hydroxyl of T7, and mannose 2 hydrogen bonding to the carbonyl of N93 (O3 and O2), the carbonyl and side chain of E23 (O4 and O6, respectively), and the amide of D95 (O3).",

CV-N completely inhibited Env-induced, CD4dependent cell-cell fusion at 100 nM and gp120-derived mAb mapping studies indicated that CV-N does not affect the gp120:CD4 interaction (Bewley and Otero-Quintero, 2001 ).",

MVN inhibits syncytium formation as well as DC-SIGN-mediated viral binding to CD4 \u00fe cells (Huskens et al., 2010) .

However, 15 N-HSQC oligosaccharide titration studies identified chemical shift perturbation for SD1 residues W8, N9, F37, C38, and Q39 and SD2 residues W56, D57, E58, F85, C86, and Q87.

Western blot analysis supported that SVN interacts with glycosylated ZEBOV GP1 (Garrison et al., 2014) . Likewise, SVN was also shown to interact specifically with the high-mannose glycans on the envelope glycoproteins E1 and E2 in HCV (Takebe et al., 2013) . These findings support that SVN inhibits viral entry by interacting with the glycans on viral envelop proteins.",

The IC 50 of SVN for ZEBOV and MARV was 41 and 260 nM, respectively. The injected SVN was bioavailable in BALB/c mice showing marked decreases in baseline levels within 4 h of injection, thus requiring the 4 injections per day to maintain effective antiviral serum concentrations, which greatly complicated BSL-4 containment efficacy studies. The survival rate past 20 days was 70e90% for SVN treatments \u00c01 h, \u00fe1 h, and \u00fe1 day after viral challenge indicating the efficacy of systemic treatment in a mammalian system. Despite the short half-life of injected SVN, the potency against a range of sensitive viruses and the absence of reported cytotoxicities earns this particular antiviral lectin a high potential therapeutic status. Though SVN displayed good efficacy in protecting mice against ZEBOV, the challenges associated with its short half-life make further development of this agent dependent on modifications of the protein which could extend its serum halflife (i.e PEGylation-modification with polyethylene glycol).",

The dissociation constant for OAA to a heptasaccharide high-mannose type N-glycan was determined through centrifugal ultrafiltration-HPLC with fluorescently labeled oligosaccharides (4.15 \u00c2 10 \u00c09 M) and revealed that the lectin possesses two carbohydrate binding sites per molecule, which is consistent with the tandem repeat in the primary sequence. OAA also interacts with recombinant glycoprotein gp120 with a K D of 2.54 \u00c2 10 \u00c012 M as determined from surface plasmon resonance. The tremendous affinity for heptasaccharide mannose and glycoprotein with only modest EC 50 against HIV-1 highlights an important aspect of lectin based antiviral mechanism of action e namely that the strong interaction with the substrate glycan does not necessarily correlate with the effectiveness of viral inhibition (at least in the case of OAA).",

The lectin exists as a homotetramer in solution with a monomeric molecular weight of 16.5 kDa. The most important contribution of this lectin to the antiviral lectins discussed in this review is the wealth of structural information published to date (Bourne et al., 2002; Sankaranarayanan et al., 1996; Jeyaprakash et al., 2003) . Twelve PDB entries represent some of the first structures that described the type I b-prism fold, commonly referred to as the Jacalin-like lectin fold. The type I b-prism fold has three-fold symmetry with each domain comprised of a four-stranded Greek key motif. The protein is post-translationally modified through proteolytic cleavage of the first 18 residues in the N-terminus resulting in the heavy a Jacalin chain and the light 18 residue peptide b chain. In the 1JAC crystal structure, Gly1 of the a-chain forms a portion of the CRD with G1 carbonyl H-bonding with the O3 and O4 hydroxyls of methyl-a-galactose (Sankaranarayanan et al., 1996) . The CRD is largely comprised of hydrophobic aromatic residues: F47, Y78, Y122, and W123 exhibiting hydrogen bonding interactions between galactose and Y122, W123, and G1 amides and D125 carboxylate.",

It was initially thought that Jacalin specifically bound Galb(1,3)GalNAc, but subsequent SPR and crystallographic studies revealed that Jacalin is promiscuous in saccharide binding with a CRD that accommodates GalNAc, GlcNAc, Neu5Ac, MurNAc, and 1-O-methyl derivatives of glucose, mannose, and galactose (albeit at a much higher concentration) (Bourne et al., 2002; Corbeau et al., 1994 Corbeau et al., , 1995 . Furthermore, a 14 residue peptide derived from Jacalin is homologous with a portion of gp120 sequence exhibiting mild inhibitory effects on HIV (at~318 mM) (Favero et al., 1993) .

Because the lectin exhibited a strong T-cell mitogenic response, research was conducted to mutate the protein to reduce mitogenicity while preserving the virucidal activity (Swanson et al., 2015) . In effect, the mutation H84T resulted in a substantial decrease in mitogencity while maintaining the antiviral effects (Swanson et al., 2015) . Interestingly, the mutation is positioned near the CRD yet had little effect on the virucidal activity and did not substantially alter the mannose poses in crystallo (4PIT). Alignment of the WT and H84T BanLec structures results in a root-mean-squared deviation of 0.442 \u00c5 over 138 C-a positions with only slight perturbations in the backbone for residue 84 indicating strong structural conservation for the remaining protein backbone (Fig. 5) . The repositioned loop results in residue 84 C-a 1.4 \u00c5 closer and C-b 2.1 \u00c5 closer to the CRD in the mutant structure allowing an additional hydrogen bond between 84T and dimannose hydroxyl. This methodology, which reduces mitogenicity and retains structural integrity, provides a route for the potential development of antiviral lectin-based therapeutics. Due to the potency against HIV and the low mitogenicity of the recombinant H84T mutant, BanLec is of potential therapeutic importance with respect to many of the antiviral lectins discussed in this review.",

GRFT adopts a Jacalinlike b-prism type I fold with an RMSD of 1.53 \u00c5 over 57 a-carbons and contains a N-terminal 2 b-strand exchange to form a stable dimer (using PDBIDs: 2GTY unliganded GRFT and 1JAC Jacalin) ( Fig. 6) (Ziolkowska et al., 2006) . Like other type I b-prism fold lectins, the griffithsin CRD contains three aromatic residues: tyrosine residues 27, 68, and 110, which form the interior of the binding site while the side chains of D112, Y110, and the amides of G12, D109, G108, Y110 hydrogen bond with mannose oxygens as seen in the crystal structure in complex with a(1,6)-mannobiose. More extensive interactions are seen in the co-crystal structure of monomeric GRFT and nonamannoside terminal mannose units (M4, M7, and M9) across all three binding sites of the CRD (3LL2) defined by residues (11e12 and 108e110), (89e90 and 66e68), and (44 and 26e28) (Fig. 6) . The third binding site mannose was donated from a symmetry related molecule in the crystal (Moulaei et al., 2010) .",

Minimal toxicity was observed by a range of single and repeat s.c. daily doses of GRFT in two rodent species and rGRFT (plant recombinant) was not inflammatory or irritating in the rabbit vaginal irritation model, supporting the therapeutic potential of the lectin (O'Keefe et al., 2009) .

GRFT was well tolerated by systemically treated mice at daily doses of 5 and 20 mg/kg.

Research efforts to generate monomeric forms of GRFT (mGRFT) resulted in decrease in antiviral potency (up to 323 nM) suggesting the oligomeric state and distance between CRDs strongly influence virucidal activity (Fig. 6) (Moulaei et al., 2010) . The monomeric form of the lectin does not participate in the domain swap of the first two b-strands and was engineered through the insertion of Gly-Ser at position 17 localized to the random coil between strand 1 and 2 (Fig. 6) . Engineering of tandemeric mGRFT with 2, 3, and 4 mGRFT linked with variable length linkers resulted in 3mGRFT and 4mGRFT with anti-HIV activities with an EC 50 of 1 and 1.2 pM, respectively (Moulaei et al., 2015) . Examination of anti-HIV activities against various subtype A, B, and C strains with the mGRFT tandemers revealed better global anti-HIV activities with median IC 50 values of 0.396, 0.298, and 0.181 nM, respectively as compared to both mGRFT and wtGRFT. Isothermal Titration Calorimetry binding studies revealed the 2mGRFT3 and 3mGRFT tandemers bind glycosylated gp120 (from HIV-1) with 3 nM affinity, which was slightly better than GRFT and almost 2 orders of magnitude better than mGRFT alone.

The lectin consists of 109 residues with a monomeric molecular weight of 12 kDa and in solution was reported to form dimeric, trimeric, and tetrameric oligomers with crystallographic and SAXS structures, while size-exclusion experiments supported the tetrameric assembly (Sauerborn et al., 1999) . NPL monomers have 3 CRD (and a fourth, low affinity CRD) and adopt the monocot consensus fold with residues 102e109 participating in strand exchange [same ref as above]. Mannose binds the CRD of NPL through interaction with the side chains of Q26, D28, N30, and Y34, which are conserved across the three CRDs. The lectin is reported to have anti-HIV-1 and 2 and anti-SIV activities with EC 50 s 0.7e7.3 mg/ml (~50e500 nM) and, to a lesser extent, anti-HSV, anti-Rabies, and anti-Rubella activity with MIC 50 s of 11, 8.2, and 2.9 mM, respectively (Marchetti et al., 1995; Balzarini et al., 1991; Weiler et al., 1990) . Literature supports that the antiviral activities derive from the specific interaction with a1,3 or a1,6 linked mannoses which is consistent with this lectin family (Marchetti et al., 1995; Balzarini et al., 1991; Weiler et al., 1990) .",

Whether or not any of the lectins described above will eventually be useful clinically will depend on a number of physiological factors we discuss below. At this point in their development, antiviral lectins are only being pursued clinically as anti-STD (primarily HIV) microbicides via mucosal administration. Additional systemic efficacy for acute infections has been demonstrated for subcutaneous administration but much less pre-clinical data has been generated about the use of antiviral lectins in this manner. Some of the factors described below relate specifically to systemic use (e.g. bioavailability) while others are important for all administration routes (e.g. toxicity/immunogenicity and affordability).",

As proteins, it is assumed that lectins will not be able to be orally administered as they would not survive digestive enzymes. Few studies have assessed the systemic bioavailability of lectins. Two lectins that have been assessed are CV-N and GRFT. CV-N was found to be biologically available following subcutaneous injection into mice (Barrientos et al., 2003) with dosing up to 5.6 mg/kg/day tolerated. The bioavailability of CV-N was assessed in the context of studies evaluating its systemic efficacy against Ebola Zaire (EBOZ) where CV-N was shown to delay the mean time to death for treated animals by several days. As the animals were challenged by intraperitoneal injection with EBOZ, the combined results indicated that CV-N was bioavailable and retained activity following subcutaneous injection.",

Most of the viruses for which these lectins have been put forward as potential clinical agents are either emerging infectious agents such as Ebola, SARS CoV, and Japanese encephalitis or as microbicidal agents acting against sexually transmitted viruses such as HIV and HSV. The economic realities of these particular utilities require that these antiviral proteins be produced at a reasonable cost. When one considers that the societies most impacted by the current HIV epidemic are predominantly those with minimal health resources for their patient population the need for low cost production strategies is clear. To address this need, proteins such as GRFT and CV-N have been produced in genetically engineered plants including tobacco (O'Keefe et al., 2009; Sexton et al., 2006) , soy (O'Keefe et al., 2015) and rice (Vamvaka et al., 2016a; Vamvaka et al., 2016b) .

The structural information now available for these proteins has enabled rational design of mutant proteins with improved capabilities. In some cases this has been the design of more potent analogs as demonstrated by GRFT tandemers, which were engineered to allow more conformational freedom between CRDs and resulted in a 5e10 fold improvement in anti-HIV activity and enhanced activity against GRFT-resistant strains of HIV (Moulaei et al., 2015) . These GRFT tandemers were able to show similar activity against HIV strains lacking oligosaccharides at positions N234 and N295 on the HIV-1 subtype C Env glycoproteins which renders the virus resistant to the monomeric and WT GRFT forms ( Fig. 1) (Alexandre et al., 2010) .",

The H84T mutation in Ban-Lec is thought to mediate mitogenicity by imparting decreased affinity for complex sugars. Hybrid lectins have also been produced from PFA and OAA to render a protein OPA with improved activity (Koharudin et al., 2012) . Other modifications in structure have produced obligate monomeric (Moulaei et al., 2010) or dimeric (Takahashi et al., 2011) proteins in an effort to improve clinical potential. Significant research into these potentially useful modifications is necessary to truly develop these agents for human use.",
