Here we report the cloning and characterization of the cDNA and gene encoding porcine DC-SIGN (pDC-SIGN). The full-length pDC-SIGN cDNA encodes a type II transmembrane protein of 240 amino acids. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that pDC-SIGN, together with bovine, canis and equine DC-SIGN, are more closely related to mouse SIGNR7 and SIGNR8 than to human DC-SIGN. pDC-SIGN has the same gene structure as bovine, canis DC-SIGN and mouse SIGNR8 with eight exons. pDC-SIGN mRNA expression was detected in pig spleen, thymus, lymph node, lung, bone marrow and muscles. pDC-SIGN protein was found to express on the surface of monocyte-derived macrophages and dendritic cells, alveolar macrophages, lymph node sinusoidal macrophage-like, dendritic-like and endothelial cells but not of monocytes, peripheral blood lymphocytes or lymph node lymphocytes. A BHK cell line stably expressing pDC-SIGN binds to human ICAM-3 and ICAM-2 immunoadhesins in a calcium-dependent manner, and enhances the transmission of porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) to target cells in trans. The results will help better understand the biological role(s) of DC-SIGN family in innate immunity during the evolutionary process.",

Invading foreign antigens trigger the migration of immature DCs from the blood into tissues where they detect and capture the antigens [1] . Subsequently, activated DCs process captured proteins into immunogenic peptides through MHC molecules and further present to T cells. Recognition of invading pathogens by DCs is mediated by pattern-recognition receptors (PRRs) including Toll-like receptors (TLRs) and lectins [2] [3] [4] . The lectins expressed on the surface of DCs are members of the calciumdependent C-type lectin receptor (CLRs) family and play a key role in the antigen capture and internalization of DCs [4] .

DC-SIGN was also found to interact with ICAM-2, regulating chemokine-induced trafficking of DCs across both resting and activated endothelium [7] . A second human DC-SIGN (hDC-SIGN) homologue, L-SIGN (CD209L), was subsequently identified and shown to have similar function to DC-SIGN [8] . DC-SIGN is expressed mainly on monocyte-derived human DCs in vitro and on immature and mature DCs in the normal human lymph node, dermis, mucosa and spleen and on macrophages in alveoli of the lung in vivo [5, 6, 9, 10] , whereas L-SIGN is highly expressed in sinusoidal endothelial cells of the liver and lymph node [8] . Recently, a third DC-SIGN-related lectin, liver and lymph node sinusoidal endothelial cell (LSECs) Ctype lectin (LSECtin) which is coexpressed with L-SIGN on LSECs, was identified with similar property of pathogen recognition and antigen capture [11] . DC-SIGN, L-SIGN and LSECtin form a tight gene cluster at human chromosome 19p13.3 and have analogous genomic structures [12] .",

Another DC-SIGN member, CD209L2 was identified in OWM and apes but not in humans [17] . The study indicated that the DC-SIGN gene family in primates has undergone duplications and deletions during recent evolutionary processes [17] . For non-primate species, five mouse homologues of hDC-SIGN, designated as SIGN1 to SIGN4 and mouse DC-SIGN (also called SIGNR5) were initially identified based on similarity searches in database and partially characterized [18] [19] [20] . SIGNR1 was found to activate the classical complement pathway on the surface of marginal-zone macrophage, leading to resistance to pneumococcal infection, which plays a different physiological role in mouse compared to its human counterpart [21] . Later, a detailed screening of the mouse genome revealed a pseudogene SIGN6 as well as two expressed proteins SIGN7 and SIGNR8, indicating widely divergent biochemical and probably physiological properties of mouse DC-SIGN related proteins [22] . More recently, DC-SIGN homologues from domestic animal species such as dog, cattle and horse have also been predicted from the genome databases.",

Understanding the compatibilities across the human-pig species barrier of the molecular interactions is very critical for the clinical application of pig-to-human xenotransplantation. Interactions of the receptors on porcine hematopoietic cells with ligands on human endothelial cells play a crucial role in the event that porcine hematopoietic cells are used to induce tolerance in the human recipient [24] . In addition, T-cellmediated xenograft rejection, a phenomenon probably caused by induction of stronger human T cell responses against pig antigen than that against alloantigens, also involved potential interactions of adhesion molecules between porcine APCs such as DCs and human T cells [25] . Considering that DC-SIGN has been shown as the endogenous adhesion receptor for ICAM-2 and ICAM-3 [5, 7, 26] , it will be interesting to see whether the DC-SIGN homologue in pig potentially participates in those events by cross-interacting with human ICAM-2 and ICAM-3.",

PRRSV isolates identified thus far worldwide are divided into two distinct genotypes, European (type 1) and North American (type 2) genotypes, which cause the same disease symptoms but are antigenically different. Like other enveloped virus such as HIV and HCV, the entry of PRRSV into the host cells, porcine alveolar macrophages, is a complex multistep process that involves the presence of several entry factors including sialoadhesin, CD163 and heparan sulphate [27] . However, the potential interaction between PRRSV and porcine PRRs on APCs has not been reported. Since human L-SIGN was shown to be associated with SARScoronavirus entry in lung, we hypothesize that the porcine DC-SIGN/L-SIGN homologue may play a similar role during PRRSV infection in pig lung since PRRSV and coronavirus both belong to the Nidovirales order.",

Unlike the computer-based screening of DC-SIGN homologues in genome databases of mouse and other species, DC-SIGN-related porcine gene sequences have not been available in pig genome database thus far. Therefore, by using degenerate RT-PCR primers based upon the human, nonhuman primates and mouse DC-SIGN genes, we first amplified a short fragment with sequence homologous to hDC-SIGN from in vitro cultured porcine monocyte-derived dendritic cells. Based upon the initial resulting sequence, both of the complete cDNA and the gene of porcine DC-SIGN (pDC-SIGN) were determined. Subsequently, a pDC-SIGN-specific antibody was generated and a stable cell line expressing pDC-SIGN was developed. The gene structure, tissue and cellular distributions and in vitro binding property of pDC-SIGN to human ICAM-3 and ICAM-2 immunoadhesins as well as the potential interaction between pDC-SIGN and PRRSV were characterized.",

Generation of porcine MDDCs has been reported by several groups [29] [30] [31] . Using similar procedure, we observed single and aggregated veiled-shaped cells after three days of culture of adherent porcine CD14 positive monocytes in the presence of rpGM-CSF and rpIL-4. The characteristic dendritic morphology of the cells that had almost transformed from monocytes in the cultured dish was more significant after seven day (Fig. 1a) . Phenotyping of the cells resulted in MHC II + CD1 + CD11b/ c + CD80/86 + which was consistent with other reports (data not shown) and thus recognized as MDDCs [29] [30] [31] . A sequence similarity search from the database of the Swine Genome Sequencing Project (SGSP, http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sites/entrez?Db=gen-omeprj&cmd=ShowDetailView&TermToSearch=13421) in NCBI did not yield any sequences of DC-SIGN homologues. In addition, other predicted DC-SIGN homologues from domestic animal species had not been released from the genome databases when we started this project. Therefore, to identify a novel pDC-SIGN gene, we first designed a series of degenerate primers based on the conserved sequences from multiple alignments of the known human, nonhuman primates and mouse DC-SIGN related cDNAs [5, 16, 17, 19 ]. An approximately 210-bp product was first amplified by RT-PCR from the total RNA of MDDCs with the primers NF-05 and NR-05 (Fig. 1b) . A nested-PCR using the gel-purified fragment as the template with the same forward primer NF-05 and a new reverse primer NR-06 upstream to primer NR-05 also amplified a fragment with smaller but expected size (data not shown), indicating the specificity of the PCR. Sequence analysis showed that the sequence of this initial PCR fragment shares 62.6%, 61.2%, and 57.6% sequence identity, respectively, to the corresponding region of hDC-SIGN, L-SIGN and mouse DC-SIGN (SIGNR5) cDNA sequences, which represents a region in the CRD of DC-SIGN.",

The resulting two PCR products, each with approximately 600 bp from the respective RACE PCR (Fig. 1c) , were assembled into a full-length cDNA sequence. A BLAST search with this cDNA did not yield any homologues sequence in Sus scrofa, indicting it's a novel porcine equivalent of the hDC-SIGN. We hence designated it as porcine DC-SIGN (pDC-SIGN).",

Like other C-type lectins, the deduced pDC-SIGN protein product is predicted to be a type II transmembrane protein beginning from a putative 39-aa cytoplasmic tail (CT) followed by a putative 31-aa transmembrane domain (TMD). The extracellular domain consisted of a 38-aa neck region followed by a 132-aa CRD (Fig. 2a ). An internalization motif, dileucine-based motif at aa position 27-28, was found within the CT. Since internalization motifs in the CT of the transmembrane receptors are important for the internalization of the ligand-receptor complex, it seems that the pDC-SIGN is likely able to mediate endocytosis and transfer the potential bound pathogen into the cytoplasm of the DCs. Human DC-SIGN, L-SIGN, nonhuman primate DC-SIGN and mouse SIGNR1 contains variable repeated sequence within the neck region whereas the remaining mouse SIGNR members, except SIGNR2 and SIGNR6, do not have repeated sequence [5, 8, 16, 19, 22, 32] . The sequence in the neck region of pDC-SIGN was non-repeated and the length was closer to SIGNRs 3-5 but was highly related to mouse SIGNR7 and SIGNR8 (data not shown). When the pDC-SIGN sequence was being analyzed, other computer-predicted DC-SIGN homologues from cattle, dog, equine and opossum were recently released.

The CRD of hDC-SIGN has been shown to bind two calcium ions using two close but distinct sites [15] . The Ca 2+ site 1 contains amino acid residues Asp176, Glu180, Asn203 and Asp208 that are essential for the interaction of DC-SIGN with its ligands. All four of these residues were conserved in pDC-SIGN. pDC-SIGN also had the common Glu-Pro-Asn sequence (EPN sequences, aa position 200-202) and Glu207 as well as Asn218 involved in the Ca 2+ site 2 that are critical for binding mannose-, fucose-or galactose-containing oligosaccharides. In addition, eight conserved cysteines predicted to form disulfide bonds were found in the CRD (Fig. 2b) .

Since the computer-predicted bovine, canis, equine and opossum DC-SIGNs had been recently released in the respective genome database, we included their putative complete amino acid sequences, together with those from primates and mouse DC-SIGN related proteins, in the phylogenetic analysis. In addition, we used porcine LSECtin (Huang et al., unpublished data), a C-type lectin closely related to but distinct from DC-SIGN as shown by recent studies of human LSECtin [11, 12] , as an outgroup to construct a neighbor-joining phylogenetic tree. The result showed that the porcine and bovine proteins are most closely related to each other than to others (Fig. 3) . A surprising finding was that mouse SIGNR7, SIGNR8, canis and equine DC-SIGNs were clustered together with porcine and bovine proteins, forming an individual clade different from the clade containing other mouse and primates homologues (Fig. 3) . Both clades were supported by bootstrap values of 100%. Opossum SIGNR8-1 and 8-2 formed another separate clade with bootstrap value of 57%. Considering opossum (Monodelphis domestica) is the common ancestor of other mammalian species selected for comparison here, the phylogenetic data indicated that opossum SIGNR8-1 and 8-2 are probably the ancestral mammalian gene in the DC-SIGN family. The tree also suggested that the later evolution of mammalian DC-SIGN family was likely originated from the mouse homologues, leading to two divergent pathways. The first pathway radiated mouse SIGNRs 1-5 and generated the lineage of primate proteins that underwent duplications (from DC-SIGN to L-SIGN2 to L-SIGN1) and deletions (L-SIGN2) during recent evolutionary processes [17] , whereas the second pathway included the ancestor of SIGNRs 6-8 (SIGN6 is a pseudogene and thus was not shown here) and the homologues from the other species, including pDC-SIGN. There is no detectable orthologous relationship between the genes in these two clades. Phylogenetic analysis of the CRD sequences had the similar results with two separate clades observed in Fig. 3 , except that the primate DC-SIGN is more closely related to L-SIGN2 than either is to L-SIGN1 (data not shown). Pairwise sequence comparison of the complete pDC-SIGN protein with the DC-SIGN homologues from other species revealed that pDC-SIGN was more homologous to bovine, canis and equine proteins as well as to SIGNR7 and SIGNR8 (over 50%) than to other DC-SIGN homologues (less than 50%), which was consistent with the phylogenetic analysis (data not shown).",

The full-length coding region of pDC-SIGN with 720 bp was amplified by PCR from RNA extracts of porcine MDDCs, and was subsequently subcloned into a eukaryotic expression vector pCI-neo, to obtain plasmid pCI-PDCS. BHK-21 cells were transfected with this construct or vector alone. The expression of pDC-SIGN protein was detected by IFA using a pDC-SIGN-specific anti-peptide antibody raised against two peptides in the CRD. The IFA results showed that most cells expressing pDC-SIGN had a spreading cytoplasmic and membrane staining (Fig. 4a) . Some cells showed the fluorescent signals only localizing on the cell membrane (Fig. 4b) . In contrast, cells transfected with pCI-neo vector did not have any positive IFA signals (Fig. 4c) . We concluded from these results that the cDNA encoding pDC-SIGN is effectively translated in vitro and that the resulting product is indeed a type II transmembrane protein. The anti-pDC-SIGN antibody also detected a specific band of $48 kDa in the lysate of cells transfected with pCI-PDCS but not in cells transfected with the empty vector control (Fig. 4d) . The molecular size was larger than that predicted from the deduced amino acids sequence (28 kDa) probably due to glycosylation, as pDC-SIGN contains a putative Nlinked glycosylation site (aa 102) in the neck region. This glycosylation site is conserved in the bovine, canis and equine DC-SIGNs as well as mouse SIGNR7 and SIGNR8. A recent study showed that the expression of bovine DC-SIGN also resulted in a product of similar size in the range of 46-48 kDa [33] .",

We hence performed flow cytometry analysis to detect the surface expression of pDC-SIGN protein on PBL, monocytes, MDDCs, MDMFs and PAM (Fig. 6b) . Scatter profile of porcine PBMC clearly indicated two cell populations, PBL and monocytes according to their morphology. Since CD14 molecule is the surface marker for porcine monocytes [34] , these two cell populations could be separated by immunomagnetic labeling MACS system using antiporcine CD14 monoclonal antibody (data not shown). CD14 + monocytes were further used to develop MDDCs with the addition of rpGM-CSF and rpIL-4 or MDMFs in the absence of the cytokines, respectively. PBL and the monocytes did not show any pDC-SIGN expression, which was expected since hDC-SIGN or L-SIGN is not expressed on lymphocytes or monocytes. Accordingly, there was no detectable pDC-SIGN expression on a porcine monocytic cell line 3D4/31 (Fig. 6b, bottom-middle panel) . Upon differentiation of the monocytes into MDDCs in culture, the pDC-SIGN expression was up-regulated with an approximately eight-fold increase of median fluorescence intensity from days 3 to 7. pDC-SIGN expression was also found on MDMFs. Compared to MDDCs, the majority of MDMFs gave a pDC-SIGN phenotype. PAM's were also dominated by a pDC-SIGN phenotype, but the expression level was lower than that on MDMFs. In accordance with undetectable expression of pDC-SIGN mRNA in pig kidney, the protein was not expressed in an epithelial cell line PK15 derived from pig kidney (Fig. 6b) .",

Binding of hICAM-3-Fc to BHK-PDCS cells had a higher affinity than binding of hICAM-2-Fc to BHK-PDCS cells. The binding was specific since binding of hFc alone to BHK-PDCS or 3T3-HDCS was negative. Furthermore, the addition of mannan blocked the binding of both hICAM-3-Fc and hICAM-2-Fc, so did the presence of EGTA. Inhibition by EGTA was more efficient than that by mannan in both of the DC-SIGNpositive cells (Fig. 8b) . The results indicated that pDC-SIGN is able to cross-react with human ICAM-3 or ICAM-2 and the interaction is dependent on Ca 2+ and is mediated by the CRD of pDC-SIGN.",

Since pDC-SIGN was expressed on PAM, the susceptible host cells for PRRSV which contains highly glycosylated envelope viral proteins, it was important to see if pDC-SIGN expressed on the cell surface was involved in PRRSV attachment and entry. Transfection of BHK-PDCS cells with a genotype 1 PRRSV infectious cDNA clone could recover the virus with GFP expression that subsequently propagated in target MARC-145 cells (Fig. 9a) . However, the virus (PGXG) released into the cell culture medium was unable to infect the untransfected BHK-PDCS cells (data not shown), demonstrating that pDC-SIGN is not involved in PRRSV entry. Since BHK-21 cell line was also known to be susceptible for PRRSV binding [38] , we subsequently performed a PRRSV specific binding assay to compare the virus attachment on the cell surface between BHK-PDCS and BHK-21 cells. We found that PRRSV indeed bound to both cell lines, although it was difficult to quantify the difference (Fig. 9b) . To determine whether the attachment of PRRSV on BHK-PDCS cells could interfere with the pDC-SIGN-hICAM-3 interaction, cells were pretreated with either genotype 1 PRSV strain PGXG or genotype 2 PRRSV strain VR2385 before the hICAM-3-Fc binding. The results showed that both PRRSV strains blocked the hICAM-3 binding, suggesting a correlation between PRRSV attachment and the expression of pDC-SIGN on the BHK cell surface (Fig. 9c) .",

BHK-PDCS and BHK-21 cells were used as donor cells whereas the susceptible MARC-145 cells were used as the target cells (or donor cells in the control) in the PRRSV capture and transmission assay. The donor cells were incubated with culture medium (as a mock-incubation control), PRRSV PGXG strain and PRRSV VR2385 strain, respectively. Compared to the virus titers obtained from direct infection of MARC-145 cells with PRRSV at the same M.O.I. of 0.5 FFU/cell that could reach up to 1 \u00c2 10 7 FFU/ml (data not shown), the virus titers of PRRSV grown in MARC-145 cells transmitted by three types of donor cells were much lower, ranging from 2.9 \u00c2 10 2 to 2.5 \u00c2 10 4 FFU/ml (Fig. 9d) , indicating that the transmission of PRRSV could be quantified in spite of the low efficiency. PRRSV transmitted by MARC-145 cells was more efficient than that by the two BHK cells due to the presence of more cells (donor cells were also used as target cells). PRRSV transmission by BHK-PDCS was enhance by 52% (p = 0.07) for PRRSV PGXG strain and by 72% (p = 0.02) for PRRSV VR2385 strain compared to that by BHK-21 cells, respectively (Fig. 9d) , suggesting that pDC-SIGN is probably associated with PRRSV transmission in trans under these conditions.",

Human DC-SIGN and related homologues have become attractive targets for their important roles in various immune responses including mediating DCs adhesion, migration, inflammation, activating primary T cell, and for their interactions with various pathogens as well as involvement in immune escape of the pathogens [5] [6] [7] 13, 14, 26, 32] . To establish a small animal model for DC-SIGN research, mouse DC-SIGN homologues, from SIGNR1 to SIGNR8, were screened from the available mouse genome or expressed sequence tag (EST) databases and subsequently cloned by RT-PCR [19, 22] . Most recently, a bovine homologue to DC-SIGN was identified using the same strategy [33] . However, since there is no relevant sequence available in the SGSP database, we used an entire different strategy to clone the pDC-SIGN gene compared to that used for mouse SIGNR molecules. By using degenerate primers based upon human and mouse DC-SIGN sequences, we firstly amplified a 210-bp fragment with sequence homologous to the hDC-SIGN and mouse SIGNRs by RT-PCR. Based upon this initial sequence, the complete cDNA sequence of the pDC-SIGN was subsequently obtained in two overlapping fragments by 5 0 -and 3 0 -RACE-PCR, respectively. In addition, the complete pDC-SIGN gene was cloned based upon the cDNA sequence by one-step genomic PCR. The cloning strategy used in this study should be very useful for the identification of the DC-SIGN homologues in other animal species with no available sequence information.",

            "text": "A surprising finding from this study was that pDC-SIGN and the putative bovine, canis and equine DC-SIGNs as well as mouse SIGNR7 and SIGNR8 form a distinct evolutionary pathway from primates DC-SIGNs and others mouse SIGNR members according to the phylogenetic analysis (Fig. 3) , which should shed a new light [12] . It was reported that the current L-SIGN gene, presented in apes and human but not in OWM, was newly duplicated from the ancestral DC-SIGN, whereas the older duplicator, L-SIGN2, was lost in human but still retained in OWM and apes [17] . The promoter polymorphisms of DC-SIGN and variable tandem-neck repeats of L-SIGN among multi-ethnic groups are also found [39] . For non-primate species, mouse DC-SIGN homologues were identified as eight members in which SIGNRs 7 and 8 form an individual lineage [22] . However, it was impossible to analyze the overall outline of evolution of the mammalian DC-SIGN species until DC-SIGN members from other species are identified. The experimental identification and characterization of pDC-SIGN in this study as well as the functional characterization of bovine DC-SIGN [33] are the necessary first step to towards understanding the evolution of the DC-SIGN family. Since no other DC-SIGN sequences were detected in the bovine, canis and equine genomes (data not shown), the pDC-SIGN is likely to exist as a single gene analogously, although the relevant porcine genomic region has not been filled. Interestingly, we found thirteen rat SIGNR genes related to mouse SIGNRs 1-8 on the rat chromosome 12p12 (data not shown), suggesting that DC-SIGN homologues are more widely presented in rodents than in other mammalian species. The discovery of eight mouse DC-SIGN homologues indicated that they had widely divergent biochemical and physiological properties [22] . However, none of them was experimentally verified to be the functional orthologue to hDC-SIGN. This is partly due to the fact that mouse does not have the ICAM-3 homologue in its genome [40] . Moreover, mouse SIGNRs 1, 3 and 5 do not interact with mouse ICAM-2 and do not support ICAM-2 mediated transmigration of immature DCs across resting endothelium [41] . SIGNR5 plays no role in T cell-DCs interactions and did not bind to pathogens known to interact with hDC-SIGN [42] . SIGNR1 was able to function as an adhesion receptor and recently was found to activate the classical complement pathway on the surface of marginal-zone macrophage, leading to resistance to pneumococcal infection [21] . SIGNR 3 shared the ability with hDC-SIGN to bind both high mannose and fucose-containing glycans and also mediated endocytosis of glycoprotein ligands but the exact function is still unknown [22] . The physiological role of SIGNR7 and SIGNR8 in mouse has not been determined. While the mouse DC-SIGN proteins have not been found to share functions with the human proteins, bovine DC-SIGN was recently shown to express on bovine MDDCs, bind and internalize HIV-1 gp120 as well as Mycobacterium bovis bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG), suggesting that it is functionally related to hDC-SIGN [33] , even though they are classified into two different evolutionary pathway. This conclusion is also supported by the evidence of tissue and cellular distribution and binding characteristics of pDC-SIGN with human ICAM ligands in this study.",

Bovine DC-SIGN protein was found to express on bovine MDDCs but not on CD14 + monocytes, B cells or T cells [33] . In this study, we showed that pDC-SIGN mRNA expression is mainly distributed in various lymphoid organs and the protein expression is not detected on the surface of CD14 + monocytes or PBL. Porcine DC-SIGN is not only expressed on MDDCs but also on MDMFs and PAM, suggesting that it is activated during the development of porcine DCs and macrophages. By using IHC analysis, we further confirmed that pDC-SIGN was indeed expressed on lymph node sinusoidal APCs including macrophage-like and dendritic-like cells but not on B or T lymphocytes (Fig. 7) . pDC-SIGN expression was also detected on lymph node endothelial cells, which shares an analogous pattern with that of hDC-SIGN expression [35] . However, neither pDC-SIGN mRNA nor protein was detectable in pig liver tissues using RT-PCR and IHC analysis, respectively.",

The L-SIGN genes emerged from a duplication event in the common DC-SIGN ancestor of anthropoids and probably does not exist in nonprimate mammalian species as shown on the bovine, canis and equine genomic regions where the C-type lectins arrange as a three gene cluster CD23/LSECtin/DC-SIGN instead of a four gene cluster CD23/LSECtin/DC-SIGN/L-SIGN on human chromosome 19p13.3. The evolutionary pathway of DC-SIGN homologues in these nonprimate mammalian species is distinct from that in primates resulting in the existence of DC-SIGN as a single gene. Phylogenetic analysis and comparison of gene organization indicated that porcine DC-SIGN is highly related to these non-primate mammalian species and thus should share the same characteristics. Furthermore, the absence of pDC-SIGN expression in pig livers by IHC and RT-PCR also supports this conclusion, since, if the cloned pDC-SIGN is the porcine L-SIGN homologue, its RNA and protein expression should have been detected in liver tissues by RT-PCR and IHC, respectively.",

Crystal structures of hDC-SIGN and L-SIGN fragments, determined in complex with a variety of carbohydrate ligands, showed that the CRD has the characteristic C-type lectin fold and revealed the oligosaccharides recognized by them [48] [49] [50] . Both DC-SIGN and L-SIGN recognize high-mannose glycans. For the mouse SIGNR members, SIGNR3 shares the ability with hDC-SIGN to bind both high-mannose and fucose-containing glycans [22] . SIGNR2 binds almost exclusively to GlcNAc-terminated glycans, and SIGNR7 binds preferentially to the 6-sulfo-sialyl Lewis x glycan [22] . The structural basis for the specific recognition has not been determined in these SIGNR members. Although the sequence alignment results suggest that pDC-SIGN and bovine DC-SIGN may have distinct carbohydrate binding specificity from hDC-SIGN and L-SIGN because of the lower sequence homology compared to other DC-SIGN-related proteins, they do share the analogous ligand-binding capacity with hDC-SIGN. This is mainly because both of the porcine and bovine DC-SIGN proteins have all structural conserved residues facilitating in the proper folding of the CRD and involved in calcium-dependent carbohydrate binding (Fig. 2b) . On the other hand, these interactions may involve protein-protein interaction in addition to protein-carbohydrate interaction, which has been implicated by the scanning-mutagenesis analysis of hDC-SIGN binding to hICAM-2 and hICAM-3 [47] . Furthermore, it was shown that hDC-SIGN has a distinct but overlapping binding fashion for gp120 and ICAM-3 [15, 47] . A single mutation from valine to glycine at aa position 351 in hDC-SIGN abrogated ICAM-3 binding but not HIV-1 gp120 interaction [15] . However, the binding to either ICAM-3 or ICAM-2 was unaffected when valine was mutated to alanine [47] . The pDC-SIGN protein has the histidine residue at this position that is uniquely shared by the bovine, canis and equine DC-SIGN proteins. The change from valine to histidine likely has minimal effect on pDC-SIGN-hICAM-3/ hICAM-2 interaction.",

            "text": "The carbohydrate binding specificity of hDC-SIGN is also determined by its multimerization and clustering on the cell surface [32] . DC-SIGN is a functional receptor as a tetramer on DCs formed by the neck region repeats [46, 51] . It has been shown that recognition of small carbohydrate compounds by individual CRD alone is not sufficient to achieve the high-affinity interactions of DC-SIGN and L-SIGN with pathogens like HIV-1 gp120. Biochemical studies with repeat domain deletion mutants in the neck region also showed that a minimum of three repeats are required to form tetramers, and that additional repeats would stabilize the tetramer [50] . Neither mouse SIGNR1 nor SIGNR3 bound to the polysaccharide dextran, whereas cellular-expressed SIGNR1 interacted with dextran [52] , further indicating the importance of the multivalent nature of mouse SIGNR1. The pDC-SIGN along with the bovine, canis and equine DC-SIGN proteins did not have repeat sequences in the neck region, suggesting that they may be unable to form a tetramer. However, this is not directly associated with the binding capacity of these proteins since we showed that pDC-SIGN is capable of effectively interacting with the potential ligands like hICAM-3 and hICAM-2, capture and transmit PRRSV to the target cells. Similarly, bovine DC-SIGN without repeat sequences in the neck region also has the ability to bind and internalize HIV-1 gp120 as well as Mycobacterium bovis BCG [33] . Another example is the hDC-SIGN-related lectin LSECtin, which is devoid of repeat sequences in the neck region, and yet it is still able to mediate antigen capture and pathogen binding by human myeloid cells [11] . Although pDC-SIGN is not involved in PRRSV entry, we showed that it can enhance the virus transmission from the engineered BHK donor cells to target MARC-145 cells. Since these two cell lines are not of pig origin, further experiments using porcine primary cells, which is beyond the scope of this study, are warranted to determine whether this in trans transmission occurs in pigs with enhanced PRRSV infectivity. It will also be interesting to see whether pDC-SIGN has the ability to capture and internalize other swine pathogens similar to bovine DC-SIGN.",

            "text": "(a) Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) is replication-competent in BHK-PDCS cells by transfection with a modified PRRSV infectious cDNA clone expressing GFP (upper panel) and the released virus is able to infect target MARC-145 cells (lower panel). GFP signal was directly monitored at 48 h post-transfection in BHK-PDCS cells or at 72 h post infection in MARC-145 cells (magnification = 100\u00c2). (b) Comparison of PRRSV binding on BHK-PDCS and BHK-21 cell lines. Dotted open histograms represent control cells incubated without PRRSV inoculation but stained with anti-PRRSV mAb SDOW17-A and FITC-labeled goat anti-mouse IgG. Cells inoculated with the virus and incubated with the two antibodies are indicated by solid grey histograms. (c) Both PRRSV strain PGXG and strain VR2385 blocked hICAM-3 binding to the BHK-PDCS cell line. BHK-PDCS cells were incubated with either PGXG or VR2385 (M.O.I. = 10 FFU/cell) for 60 min at 4 8C before the addition of hICAM-3-Fc. The stained cells were analyzed using FACS as described for Fig. 8b. Data are presented as the mean fluorescence intensity normalized to the untreated control (addition of a hICAM-3-Fc and a FITC labeled anti-human IgG Fc antibody only) AE S.D. Asterisks indicated statistical difference compared with the untreated control (p < 0.05). (d) PRRSV transmission mediated by BHK cells was enhanced by pDC-SIGN. Transmission of either PRRSV PGXG or PRRSV VR2385 using BHK-PDCS, BHK-21 and MARC-145 cells as donor cells and MARC-145 cells as target cells and titration of PRRSV were performed as described in materials and methods section. Donor cells co-cultured with MARC-145 target cells not exposed to PRRSV were used as mock-transmission control and the results were not shown in the figure (no virus detected). Asterisk indicated statistical difference for PRRSV VR2385 strain between BHK-PDCS and BHK-21 cells (p < 0.05). binding of human ICAM-3 and ICAM-2 immunoadhesins to BHK-PDCS and 3T3-HDCS cells. Dashed open histograms represent cells staining only with a FITC labeled antihuman IgG Fc antibody. Results are representative of three independent experiments. Data are expressed as histogram analysis of 10,000 cells.",
