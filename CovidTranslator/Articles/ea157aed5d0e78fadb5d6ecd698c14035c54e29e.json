More recently, our view of the roles of lipids in viral infection has greatly expanded. We now recognize that lipids organize the subcellular localization of key events in the viral life cycle. Viruses encode proteins that co-opt lipid signaling and synthesis machinery to remodel the host cell in order to establish protected sites of replication and generate excess lipids for envelopment. Furthermore, there are numerous mechanisms for how viruses modulate host cell lipid metabolism to promote efficient viral replication.",

            "text": "Cellular lipid membranes are the first barrier to viral infection of the host cell and an important initial point of interaction for viruses. In some cases, viruses can exploit lipids to use them as viral receptors (Figure 1a ). For non-enveloped viruses, the viral capsid can interact directly with specific components of host cell membranes, usually glycosphingolipids, as receptors to initiate infection (reviewed in [1] ). Polyomaviruses, for example, bind glycosphingolipids upon association with a host cell and the specific bound ganglioside will determine the internalization pathway used [2, 3] . Alternatively, lipid trafficking receptors can function as indirect viral receptors (Figure 1b) . Members of the Flaviviridae, including hepatitis C virus (HCV) and bovine viral diarrheal virus (BVDV), have been shown to require functional low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDL-R) for viral entry [4, 5] . Although there are additional high-affinity receptors known to be required for HCV entry, the requirement for an early, low-affinity, LDL-R interaction is likely a reflection of virion association with apolipoproteins which serves to bring the virus in proximity to other entry cofactors (reviewed in [6] ) (Figure 1b) . Similarly, the scavenger receptor class B type I (SR-BI) is an HCV receptor that is known to interact with the highdensity lipoprotein HDL [7] . Although the viral glycoproteins directly interact with SR-BI, there is evidence that HDL/HCV/SR-B1 interactions can also influence the infectivity of HCV (reviewed in [8] ).",

Human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) fails to enter host cells that have been depleted for cholesterol via treatment with \u03b2-cyclodextran [9] , implicating a lipid as a required cofactor for HIV-1 entry. Further mechanistic work showed that cholesterol is essential to bring the viral receptors into proximity and initiate the entry complex formation [10] . Cellular lipid microdomains are similarly required for murine coronavirus entry [11] and pseudorabies virus entry [12] . In addition, some viruses require cholesterol in the viral envelope for efficient viral entry. This has been reported for influenza A virus [13] and human herpes virus 6 [11] , however, the exact role for viral envelope cholesterol remains unclear.",

Following internalization, virions can be sorted into appropriate endosomal compartments from which they eventually fuse out. Specific lipids can influence the compartment of virion uncoating (Figure 1d ). Recent work on dengue virus (DENV) has shown that virus fusion with late endosomes is specifically induced by the presence of a late endosome-specific lipid species bis(monoacylglycero)phosphate [15] . Interestingly, low pH alone is ineffective in stimulating viral fusion in the absence of bis(monoacylglycero)phosphate. Similarly, alphaviruses require cholesterol and sphingolipids for optimal viral endosomal fusion, [reviewed in 16] . Thus, specific lipid species appear to influence the ability of viruses to initiate infection at multiple stages of the viral entry process.",

Positivestranded RNA viruses can form replication complexes from different cytosolic membrane sources including the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), Golgi, endosomes and/or lysosomes, and mitochondria; and their mechanism of formation likely differs [reviewed in 17, 18] . The importance of the source of membrane is unclear. At least in the case of Flock House virus (FHV), replication is not perturbed by targeting replication complex formation to an abnormal sub-cellular location [19] . Advances in electron tomography have allowed the first appreciation of the three-dimensional structure of viral replication factories [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] .

Initially, the question of how membranes were reorganized was addressed by identifying the viral requirements for the formation of these membrane structures. Individual viral proteins were overexpressed in cells, which were then examined by electron microscopy to identify membrane structures that resemble those found in infected cells. This approach has identified HCV NS4B [26, 27] , flavivirus NS4A [28, 29] and enterovirus non-structural protein 2BC, possibly along with the 3A protein [30] [31] [32] [33] as being capable of inducing membrane alterations. The exact mechanism by which these viral proteins alter membrane organization however, is generally unclear. Further complexities have been revealed by work on brome mosaic virus (BMV), which has shown that not only the viral proteins but their interactions and relative expression levels can lead to different membrane morphologies [34] .",

Specifically, much work has been done on cellular cofactors that have functions in host lipid-membrane metabolism. Both enteroviruses and HCV appear to co-opt lipid signaling to influence the formation of these structures (Figure 2a) . It has been shown by several groups that host genes involved in phosphatidylinositol (PI) signaling influence HCV and enterovirus replication [35] [36] [37] [38] [39] [40] . These reports have lead to a model wherein the modulation of these lipid signaling molecules directs cellular membrane trafficking to coalesce with viral proteins to generate replication complex (RC) formation [41] . HCV infection or NS5A expression stimulates cellular PI4P production by the PI4-kinase III-alpha [42] . This activity is required for the formation of appropriate membrane RCs. Enteroviruses require the related PI4-kinase IIIbeta. Further, the enteroviral RNA polymerase 3D pol physically binds PI4P, which could influence both its association with cellular membranes and its ability to synthesize RNA ( Figure 2a ) [40] .",

In West Nile virus (WNV) infection, the cholesterol synthesizing enzyme 3-hydroxy-methyglutaryl-CoA reductase as well as cellular cholesterol are redistributed to viral RCs during replication [46] . The related DENV also depends on cholesterol biosynthesis [47] . In addition to the importance of cholesterol, DENV NS3 recruits the cellular enzyme fatty acid synthase to sites of viral replication and stimulates its activity to synthesize fatty acids [48] . A major theme of these studies is that simply inducing membrane curvature is likely insufficient to create the functional replication complexes seen in viral replication. There are additional requirements for altering both the total membrane content and specific lipid composition that impact membrane fluidity. A second emerging theme is that the formation of these structures might not simply be the function of one viral protein. Although HCV NS4B expression drives membrane remodeling, NS5A modulation of PI4-kinase activity clearly influences the process [42] . Similarly, DENV NS3 modulation of fatty acid synthesis likely influences the ability of NS4A to drive formation of RC structures.",

Using HCV as an example, it has been shown that the viral protein NS4B is palmitoylated in an overexpression system [50] and this palmitoylation is required for viral replicase formation. Additionally, palmitoylation of the HCV core protein is required for viral particle formation [51] . Geranylageranylation of the host cofactor FBL2 is also required for HCV replication [52] .

There were also specific lipid metabolism changes; in particular, there was an increase in the flux of metabolites channeled into fatty acid biosynthesis pathway [56] . The authors further showed that inhibiting fatty acid biosynthesis inhibited CMV infection and thus identified a possible antiviral target. James Alwine and colleagues discuss the metabolic changes in CMV infection in much greater detail in another review in this themed issue [57] . Another herpesvirus, Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpes virus, provokes similar changes in cellular metabolism that resemble the Warburg effect, which is an increase in aerobic glycolysis and a decrease in oxidative phosphorylation, as part of its latent infection [58] .",

For example, the proteins involved in fatty acid oxidation have increased abundance in HCV infected cells but show no differential regulation in microarray studies. Complementary lipidomic analysis of HCV infected cells also revealed that there were changes in select lipid species (e.g. phospholipids and sphingomyelins), which are predicted to play roles in viral replication as well as assembly and secretion events [60] . The authors of this study propose a model in which the infected cell is reprogrammed to maintain homeostasis and cell viability by modulating cellular metabolism to deal with the elevated energy demands during viral replication (Figure 3 ).",

HCV core localizes to lipid droplets that are in proximity to ER-associated viral structural proteins. A current model is that HCV replication occurs at the membranous web discussed earlier and then nascent RNA is transported to lipid droplets by the viral replicase proteins NS3 and NS5A. Assembly of viral RNA into capsids is thought to occur at lipid droplets and require the viral NS2 and p7 proteins [66] . It is thought that assembly at lipid droplets might influence lipid-associated secretion of HCV (discussed later). Interestingly, HCV core protein expression enhances the accumulation of lipid droplets in the peri-nuclear region. This phenomenon appears to be genotype specific and linked to assembly efficiency [67] . One possible mechanism for core and lipid droplet association is an interaction of HCV core with DGAT-1, which promotes lipid droplet formation [68] .",

Lipid signaling also helps organize HIV budding sites by recruiting the major HIV structural protein, Gag. The localization of Gag to lipid rafts at the plasma membrane is dependent on the interactions of the Gag protein with the lipid signaling molecule PI-(4,5)-bisphosphate, which is enriched at the plasma membrane [71] [72] [73] .

HIV secretion is a well-characterized example of an ESCRT-dependent pathway. HIV encodes proteins which contain 'L' or 'late' domains [reviewed in 75] which interact with ESCRT machinery leading to release of the virus [reviewed in 76]. The ESCRT pathway normally functions to generate endosomal vesiculation, which leads to the formation of multi-vesicular bodies.

Recently, the lipidomic profile of HCV virions was determined, which closely resembles that of low and very-low density lipoproteins [81] . HCV that was isolated from infected patients contained components of the VLDL machinery, including apolipoproteins (Apo) B and E [82] . Further, knockdown of ApoB and ApoE decreased the amount of intracellular as well as secreted infectious virus indicating that apolipoproteins play a role in both secretion and infectivity [83, 84] .

            "text": "Much work remains to be done to better appreciate viral-lipid interactions. Many of the studies have relied heavily on drug or RNA interference inhibition of a lipid metabolic process to determine whether or not it is required during viral infection. However, only rarely have the essential lipid or lipid species been identified. Additionally, even in cases where we can identify distinct lipid species that are modified during viral infection, the proposed mechanism for how they contribute to viral replication is often left to speculation. Questions remain as to why specific lipid species are required, in addition to their physical orientation and biochemical function within these complexes. Finally, most of the studies described here have focused on the virus-cell interaction. Much remains to be determined how alterations in cellular metabolism influence the host response to viral infection on an organismal level, from hormone production to immune responses. With increased research in this area, our understanding of how and why lipids are manipulated in the host cell continues to expand. This not only increases our basic understanding of virology and cell biology, but could also have practical implications for novel antiviral agents.",

            "text": "(a) Lipids as direct viral receptors. The viral protein coat of non-enveloped viruses, such as polyomaviruses, can associate with lipids on the cell surface [1] . In many cases these lipids display a carbohydrate moiety (brown) that directly interacts with the viral protein coat (yellow). This interaction leads to internalization of the virus and the initiation of infection. (b) Lipid receptors as indirect viral receptors. Viruses (yellow) such as HCV and BVDV, which associate with LDL in the blood, can be brought into proximity of a target cells via the association between LDL and its receptor (LDL-R) [4, 5] . Subsequently, interaction with high-affinity cell surface viral receptors (orange) facilitates infection. (c) Lipids as entry cofactors. Lipids can modulate the ability of a virus to enter the cell post-receptor interactions. Many viruses (yellow) such as influenza, HIV, and Ebola virus enter cells at lipid microdomains (orange) or require lipid microdomains for some step of viral entry (reviewed in [86] ). (d) Lipids as viral fusion cofactors. Some viruses (yellow), such as DENV utilize specific lipids (green) in order to stimulate viral envelope fusion with the target membranes [15] . (a) Phosphoinositide signaling. Phosphoinositides (PIs) are negatively charged lipids with a specific head-group that can be phosphorylated at different positions to generate PIphosphates (PIPs). PIPs can direct cellular signaling in a pro-viral manner or directly bind viral proteins during HCV and enterovirus infection [40, 42] . (b) Membrane curvature. There are several ways in which viruses can induce membrane curvature. First, the virus can cause the accumulation of cone shaped lipids (such as lysophosphatidylcholine, LPC) in one leaflet of the membrane bilayer, which can lead to membrane bending (top). Second, the virus can encode a membrane-associated protein that induces membrane curvature (e.g. HCV NS4B and flavivirus NS4A, middle) [26, 28] . Third, the virus can utilize host membrane proteins that induce membrane curvature, such as reticulons (RTNs, bottom) [43] , which have been shown to be required for BMV membrane re-arrangements. It is important to note that these are not mutually exclusive and a virus could use several strategies to accomplish membrane bending. (c) Membrane expansion. WNV and DENV actively recruit lipid biosynthetic machinery to generate lipids at sites of replication [46, 48] . This helps form the replication complexes. Further, membrane expansion might be important in generating lipids for the viral envelope. (d) Membrane dynamics. Viruses, such as DENV or WNV which recruit lipid biosynthetic machinery to RCs can modulate membrane fluidity and plasticity of replication complex membranes by de-saturating lipid tails or leading to the accumulation of cholesterol as has been seen during BMV infection (a) Lipids in HIV assembly and release. HIV assembly and release requires specific lipids at multiple stages. Initially, the structural protein Gag is recruited to pre-budding sites by its association with the lipid phosphatidylinositol-(4,5)-bisphosphate (PIP 2 ) [72] . In addition, the membrane composition of these sites is specific, containing high amounts of sphingolipids and cholesterol [69] . As the virus begins to bud, there is significant membrane curvature that needs to be induced and then resolved, a process known as membrane scission. In the case of HIV, membrane scission is accomplished by co-opting cellular machinery known as the ESCRT machinery. The ESCRT complex facilitates membrane scission and the release of the virus [76] . (b) Lipids in influenza virus assembly and release. Influenza A similarly associates with specific lipid microdomains during the budding process, however, the mechanism of membrane scission is significantly different. Instead of utilizing the ESCRT complex, the virus genome encodes the M2 protein, which serves an analogous function to the ESCRT complex and facilitates viral budding without the requirement for host machinery [77] .",

Lipids and lipid stores represent vast pools of energy that are exploited during viral replication. Some viruses, such as HCV, appear to induce lipid metabolism both transcriptionally [59] and post-transcriptionally [60] that facilitate lipid oxidation and ATP generation. In addition, some viruses, such as DENV, can induce cytosolic processes, such as autophagy, which can lead to the degradation of lipid droplets (LDs) [63] . The lipids released from LDs are oxidized at the mitochondria, leading to the oxidative phosphorylation of ADP to generate ATP.",
