            "text": "During the last decade of the 20th century, diagnostic advancements dramatically reduced the transmission of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis C virus (HCV), and hepatitis B virus (HBV) by transfusion. However, simultaneously, the emergence of additional pathogens as potential blood contaminants gained attention. Some of these agents represented newly discovered entities (e.g., severe acute respiratory syndrome [SARS-CoA]). Others were known sources of transfusion complications that expanded into the United States (e.g., Chagas disease). Additionally, some agents demonstrated species jumping from animal hosts to humans (e.g., variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease [VCJD] , Asian influenza, and West Nile virus). Increasing globalization through commerce, travel, and social interaction requires that many infectious agents, once thought exotic or of remote significance, must be considered as potential blood-component contaminants. 1, 2 Alternatively, new information may reduce some concerns. For example, porcine endogenous retrovirus (PERV), previously linked to humans undergoing xenotransplantation, currently appears less threatening. 3 This chapter addresses agents endemic to the United States and those emerging in other parts of the world that have been transmitted or are theoretically capable of transmission by transfusion, and approaches to reduce the associated risks.",

            "text": "Babesiosis, a zoonosis caused by the rodent-borne piroplasm protozoan, Babesia microti, is transmitted by Ixodes scapularis, the deer or black-legged tick. I. scapularis also transmits the agents of Lyme disease and human granulocyte ehrlichiosis (discussed later). [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] The white-footed mouse (Peromyscus leucopus) is the natural reservoir for B. microti; once infected, a mouse remains parasitemic indefinitely. I. scapularis transmits the piroplasm most frequently during the nymphal stage when the tick is 1.5 mm long. Tick bites, at this stage, often go unnoticed despite the 48-to 72-hour feeding time during which infection occurs. 11 B. microti is the agent most frequently associated with clinical illness; MO1-type, WA1-type, and CA1-type also cause clinical disease. 12, 13 Endemic areas include coastal and island areas of New England and New York as well as parts of California, Washington, Missouri, Wisconsin, and Minnesota. 6, 7, 9, 12, 13 Ticks coinfected with B. microti and Borrelia burgdorferi (the agent of Lyme disease) transmit B. microti less frequently than B. burgdorferi because the tick is a less competent host for B. microti. The intraerythrocytic localization of B. microti, however, favors transfusion transmission of this agent over that of B. burgdorferi. 6 In humans, circulating B. microti DNA persists, on average, for 82 days in asymptomatic patients and in those not given specific treatment. Co-infection with Lyme disease does not alter the duration of parasitemia. Parasites circulate for only 16 days in persons who are treated with clindamycin and quinine; alternative antibiotic regimens include atovaquone and azithromycin. 13 Silent Babesia infections occur commonly. Some infected individuals develop a chronic carrier state lasing months to years. In others, recrudescence occurs spontaneously or after splenectomy or immunosuppression. 11, 14 The parasite retains infectivity in red blood cell (RBC) components at refrigerated or frozen temperatures and in the residual RBCs contained in platelet concentrates stored at room temperature. 5, 8 To date, more than 50 post-transfusion cases involving B. microti and other Babesia species have been reported. 5, 6, 9, 12, 15 Several reports involve donors who transmitted infections through multiple donations given up to 6 months apart. 11, 16 The overall risk of acquiring transfusion-associated babesiosis is low, but varies regionally. In Connecticut, 1.9% of seronegative donors became seropositive on a subsequent donation. In another study, 0.9% of donors in endemic and nonendemic areas of Connecticut had confirmatory indirect immunofluorescence assay (IFA)-positive test results for Babesia infection; the prevalence rates peaked in July when 1.2% of donors were seropositive. 15 This represents a relatively high potential threat in an endemic area because 8 of 51 recipients became seropositive after receiving blood from IFA-positive blood donors. 17 Asplenia, older age, immunodeficiency, organ transplantation, and liver disease increase the risk of severe Babesia illness. In acute symptomatic cases, fatigue, malaise, weakness, and fever occur in more than 90% of the patients. Shaking chills, diaphoresis, nausea, anorexia, headaches, and myalgia occur frequently. Heart murmurs, hepatomegaly, and splenomegaly are found in 10% to 20% of patients; jaundice occurs less frequently. Renal failure, disseminated intravascular coagulation, and adult respiratory distress syndrome have been reported. 13 The average hemoglobin concentration was 11.3 g/dL in a review of hospitalized patients with community-acquired babesiosis. 4 Examination of blood smears for intraerythrocytic ring forms and maltese cross-like tetrads (including more than two parasites per cell, contorted shapes, vacuoles, and budding), 18 antibabesial antibody assays, and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays for babesial DNA provide laboratory evidence of infection. 4, Most transfusion-associated babesia cases involve RBC transfusions, although frozen-deglycerolized RBC and platelet units have been implemented. 5, 8, 13 Transfusion-acquired cases have an incubation period of 2 to 6.5 weeks. 4, 6, 8, 13, 15 Blood-collection agencies ask all prospective donors whether they have ever had babesiosis. Those answering affirmatively are deferred. However, donors are not asked about a recent history of tick bites or geographic residence because of the low predictive value associated with these questions. For example, 0.4% of donors in Connecticut reporting tick bites were seropositive for babesiosis antibodies compared with 0.3% in those not reporting tick bites. 9 Serologic or PCR testing is impractical at this time. The absence of specific interventions to interdict donors capable of transmitting Babesia infections relegates clinical awareness and prompt antibiotic therapy as the primary modality for treating this infrequent complication of transfusion therapy.",

Endemic areas include the northeastern, mid-Atlantic, and upper north-central regions of the United States. 10, 19 Ixodes scapularis, the black legged deer tick, transmits B. burgdorferi in the northeastern and north-central parts of the United States. I. pacificus, the western black-legged tick, transmits the infection along the Pacific Coast. The ticks feed predominantly in the late spring and early summer during their nymphal stage, and Lyme disease usually results from bites of infected nymphs. Deer do not become infected but rather transport and maintain the ticks. 10 Patients with Lyme disease typically present with a characteristic erythema migrans rash accompanied by fever, malaise, headaches, myalgia, arthralgia, or Bell's palsy. The rash occurs 3 to 30 days after a tick bite. B. burgdorferi spirochetes disseminate from the entry site via cutaneous, lymphatic, and blood-borne routes. In one study, spirochetes were isolated from the blood of 44% of patients with symptomatic Lyme disease. 20 B. burgdorferi has also been isolated from erythema migrans lesions.",

After this initial replication in the liver (exo-erythrocytic schizogony), the parasites undergo asexual multiplication in the erythrocytes (erythrocytic schizogony). Merozoites infect red blood cells. The ring-stage trophozoites mature into schizonts, which rupture, releasing merozoites. Some parasites differentiate into sexual erythrocytic stages (gametocytes). Blood-stage parasites are responsible for the clinical manifestations of the disease. The gametocytes, male (microgametocytes) and female (macrogametocytes), are ingested by an Anopheles mosquito during a blood meal. The parasites' multiplication in the mosquito is known as the sporogonic cycle. While in the mosquito's stomach, the microgametes penetrate the macrogametes, generating zygotes. The zygotes in turn become motile and elongated (ookinetes) and invade the midgut wall of the mosquito where they develop into oocysts. The oocysts grow, rupture, and release sporozoites, which make their way to the mosquito's salivary glands. Inoculation of the sporozoites into a new human host perpetuates the malaria life cycle.

P. vivax and P. ovale, species that give rise to relapsing infections, rarely persist longer than 3 years. 42 However, some infections do persist, and individuals with these prolonged infections will transmit malaria if their blood is transfused. Likewise, disease caused by P. falciparum, a nonrelapsing species, manifests within 1 year after departure from a malarious area 99% of the time, but a report of falciparum malaria occurring 13 years after departure from a malarious area has been published. 41 The well-known ability of P. malariae to persist asymptomatically for decades in some individuals further highlights the difficulty of eradicating the risk of post-transfusion malaria through questioning of donors. 42 The AABB has advocated the use of uniform donor screening questions to elicit malaria risk from prospective donors, including questions that inquire about a history of malaria and about the prospective donor's travel history within the past 3 years.

T. cruzi infects humans when triatomid (reduviid) or kissing bugs ingest a blood meal from the host and deposit infected feces into the wound or when contaminated feces contact the mucosal surface of the eye or mouth. Hematogenous spread occurs subsequently. In addition, T. cruzi crosses the placenta and can cause congenital disease [47] [48] [49] [50] [51] (Fig. 48-3 ).",

Symptomatic myocarditis and meningioencephalitis can occur, and fulminant illness can develop in immunologically immature children or immunocompromised adults. However, in more than 95% of patients, the illness is mild and symptoms resolve in 4 to 6 weeks. If untreated, hosts then enter an indeterminate phase. Ten percent to 30% of patients progress from the indeterminate asymptomatic phase to a chronic symptomatic phase associated with cardiac enlargement, apical aneurysms, mural thrombi, megaesophagus, or megacolon, appearing years to decades after infection.

            "text": "Estimates of risk for transfusion-associated Chagas disease are related to immigration patterns from endemic regions. During the mid-1980s, 4.9% of 205 Nicaraguan and Salvadorian immigrants living in Washington, D.C., had serologic evidence of T. cruzi infection. Parasites were isolated from half. 54 In the early 1990s, 0.11% of a selected blood-donor population in California and the U.S. southwest was seropositive for T. cruzi antibodies. At least 50% of these donors were of Hispanic origin. 55 During the mid-1990s, 39.5% of donors at a hospital in Los Angeles responded affirmatively to questions inquiring about birth in Chagas disease-endemic areas or residing in dwellings constructed of palm leaf-thatched roofs or walls made of mud, 56 and 0.5% tested positive for T. cruzi antibodies. In a study conducted in the mid-to-late 1990s involving more than 1.1 million blood donors, 1 in 7500 in Los Angeles and 1 in 9000 in Miami were T. cruzi seropositive. 52 Although a correlation exists between the percentage of immigrants from endemic areas and the percentage of blood donors with serologic evidence of T. cruzi infection, investigators have also identified seropositive blood donors who were born in the United States. 57 Congenital transmission may explain infection in these individuals. In addition, autochthonous transmission has been reported in the United States, 58 and an infestation of triatomines has been reported in Texas. 59 Since 1989, seven cases of transfusion-associated Chagas disease have occurred in the United States and Canada. [61] [62] [63] [64] [65] Symptoms developed approximately 2 to 3 months after transfusion. In at least six of the cases, platelets were the implicated blood component; however, in the seventh case, the implicated unit was not identified. 63 Centrifugation may sediment T. cruzi into the platelet layer during component preparation, accounting for the association with platelet transfusions. Whereas room-temperature storage of platelets may favor parasite survival, T. cruzi has been shown to survive in refrigerated RBCs and whole blood for at least 18 to 21 days. 51 In six of the North American transfusion-associated cases, a donor emigrating from a T. cruzi-endemic region (Bolivia, Mexico, Paraguay, Chile) was identified. Four of the donors emigrated between 16 and 33 years before the implicated donation. Given this small number of cases, transfusion transmission of Chagas disease may be inefficient. In a study of 18 patients receiving blood from blood donors subsequently found to be T. cruzi seropositive, none of the recipients became seropositive after transfusion. However, only two received platelet transfusions. 52 A report of Chagas disease also has been reported after transplantation involving an organ donor who emigrated from Central America appeared in 2002. 60 The recipient of a kidney and pancreas died of acute Chagas myocarditis 5 months after transplant. The recipients of the other kidney and the liver were both also infected with T. cruzi.",

No cases of transfusion-associated syphilis have occurred in the United States since 1966. 69 Multiple factors-improved donor selection, uniform serologic testing, lack of spirochete viability in blood stored at refrigerated temperatures, and widespread antibiotic use-apparently contribute to the current absence of transfusion-transmitted syphilis cases. [69] [70] [71] In 1978, the AABB Standards Committee deleted the requirement for syphilis testing, and an FDA advisory panel proposed eliminating the requirement for serologic syphilis testing in 1985. However, these changes were not made because of the belief that such testing might identify those at risk of transmitting the HIV. Subsequently, observational data did not support this assumption. Nonetheless, a National Institutes of Health Consensus Statement, issued in January 1995, recommended continuation of syphilis testing because its role in preventing transfusion-transmitted syphilis was not \"understood.\" 70 A lack of complete laboratory data also supports test retention. Although spirochetes survive 96 to 120 hours at refrigerated temperatures, 72,73 viability at room temperature (e.g., in platelet concentrates) has not been studied. Furthermore, loss of viability during storage is an incomplete protection mechanism.",

The infectious agent, Treponema pallidum, is an anaerobic organism that cannot be cultured in vitro. 73 During treponema infection, nontreponemal and treponemal antibodies are produced. The nontreponemal antibodies (reagin antibodies) react against phospholipid isolated from beef heart or cardiolipin. These antibodies are detected by the Venereal Disease Research Laboratory (VDRL), rapid plasma reagin (RPR), and other tests in response to the interaction of infected host tissue with T. pallidum. They parallel the pathologic course but have no relation to immunity. Treponema-specific antibodies have a higher serologic sensitivity in the early stages of syphilis but are less effective indicators of disease activity. During the first 3 weeks after primary infection, the VDRL is positive in 30% of cases, and the fluorescent treponemal antibodyabsorption (FTA-ABS) test is positive in 50%. Other treponemal antibody tests, often used to confirm nontreponemal tests, include T. pallidum particle aggregation (TP-PA) and recombinant antigen tests. An automated test for treponemal antibodies, PK (TM) treponema pallidum (PK-TP), performed on the Olympus PK 7200, is widely used. [74] [75] [76] Reaction patterns characterized by positive RPR or PK-TP tests and negative FTA-ABS reactions (socalled false-positive reactions) may be caused by hepatitis, mononucleosis, viral pneumonia, chickenpox, measles, immunizations, pregnancy, or laboratory error. Persistent false-positive reactions have been reported in patients with rheumatoid arthritis, cirrhosis, ulcerative colitis, vasculitis, and older age. [74] [75] [76] Among PK-TP-and FTA-ABS-positive blood donors, approximately half give a prior history of a treated syphilis infection. 75 A history of lupus, rheumatoid arthritis, and diabetes did not provide an explanation for nonconfirmed PK-TP results.",

Not surprisingly, in plasma derivatives prepared from large-scale plasma pools, PCR testing detects parvovirus B19 in most lots. In observational studies, recipients of solvent/detergent-treated plasma seroconverted after infusion of products with high-titer parvovirus DNA, 10 7.5 to 10 8.5 genome copies per milliliter, suggesting that the presence of anti-B19 antibodies was not protective against large viral loads. Seroconversion did not occur among recipients of lots with viral titers between 10 0.5 and 10 3.5 genome copies per milliliter. 78 The virus is resistant to viral-inactivation steps such as solvent/detergent treatment and heat after lyophilization or in the vapor stage. Heat may reduce infectivity if applied in the liquid state. Children receiving plasma-derived factor VIII concentrates were at least 1.9-to 7.6-fold more likely to be B19 seropositive than were those receiving no product or recombinant-derived anti-hemophilic factor. 87 Parvovirus seemingly becomes concentrated in the plasma fraction used in factor VIII preparations. Despite the high frequency of parvovirus exposure, long-term sequelae appear subtle. 82, 87 For example, parvovirus B19-seropositive hemophilic children had an 8-degree loss in joint range of motion, a 0.48% difference, compared with seronegative children. Unlike factors VIII and IX, albumin has not transmitted parvovirus B19.

TSEs occurring in animals include scrapie (sheep and goats), wasting disease of deer and elk, transmissible mink encephalopathy, and bovine spongiform encephalopathy. [91] [92] [93] The TSE infectious agents are classified as prions, or proteinaceous infectious particles that lack nucleic acid. TSEs resist inactivating agents such as alcohol, formalin, ionizing and ultraviolet irradiation, proteases, and nucleases but are disrupted by autoclaving, phenols, detergents, and extremes in pH that affect proteins. The normal host membrane prion protein PrP (designated PrP c ), whose function is unknown, is protease sensitive, soluble, and has a high \u03b1-helix content. All prion diseases appear to involve conformational modification of PrP c to a protease-resistant altered isoform that forms amyloid fibrils (designated PrP sc ). The conversion of PrP c to PrP sc results in refolding of a portion of the \u03b1-helical and coil structure of PrP c into \u03b2-sheets. Neuronal loss and vacuolization leads to a spongioform appearance in the brain cortex and deep nuclei.",

            "text": "CJD occurs at an incidence of 0.5 to 1.5 cases per 1 million population worldwide. This rate has increased slightly over the past decade presumably on the basis of improved diagnostic accuracy and greater numbers of older individuals. 92, 94 Fewer than 300 cases per year are reported in the United States. Sporadic CJD, causing approximately 85% of CJD cases, occurs in persons 40 to 80 years of age (average age at onset is 60 years) and is manifested by disordered sleep and decreased appetite, behavioral or cognitive changes or focal signs such as visual loss, cerebellar ataxia, asplasia, and motor deficits. 91 The mean survival time is 5 months. The mode of infection for sporadic CJD is uncertain. Approximately 10% to 15% of CJD cases occur in patients with a family history of CJD, suggesting an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern and mutations in the PRMP gene that codes for the prion protein. More than 50 mutations in this gene, located on the short arm of chromosome 20, have been identified, but 4 point mutations at codons 102, 178, 200, and 210 occur in 95% of familial cases. 91 Approximately 1% of CJD cases involve iatrogenic transmission. For example, CJD was transmitted by a corneal transplant from a patient with undiagnosed CJD, whereas stereotactic electroencephalographic silver electrodes previously implanted in a patient with CJD subsequently resulted in two iatrogenic CJD cases. 91, 92 More than 130 young adults have died 5 to 30 years after receiving intramuscular human growth hormone injections prepared from cadaveric pituitary glands from donors with unsuspected CJD. 91, 95 Cadaveric dura mater grafting with a commercial product prepared by batch processing resulted in at least 100 CJD cases worldwide, some occurring 18 years after graft placement. 91, 96 In sporadic and iatrogenic cases of CJD, a polymorphism involving codon 129 in the PrP gene appears to affect susceptibility. Normally 37% of the population are methionine/methionine homozygous, and 11% are valine/valine homozygous at codon 129. The remaining 52% are heterozygous. Homozygous individuals represent almost 90% of sporadic and iatrogenic CJD cases. 96, 100 Those homozygous for methionine are at risk for fatal familial insomnia, whereas those homozygous for valine are at risk of clinical CJD. 91 In experiments involving mice infected with a strain of Gerstmann-Str\u00e4ussler-Scheinker disease, blood-component infection was demonstrated. 97 In contrast, no evidence of transfusion-associated CJD was documented in case-control studies involving more than 600 patients with CJD or in recipients of blood from persons who subsequently developed CJD. [98] [99] [100] Examination of brain tissue from deceased hemophilia patients showed no evidence of CJD. 91, 101, 102 No transfusion-associated CJD cases have been reported to date. Nonetheless, the occurrence of iatrogenic cases and the theoretical risk of CJD transmission by blood led the FDA to issue a recommendation to defer donors if they have one or more blood relatives with CJD or if they have received human pituitary-derived growth hormone injections or a dura mater transplant. All in-date products from donors with these risk factors must be quarantined and destroyed, and the previous recipients of blood from implicated donors, with the exception of those who have only one family member with CJD, must be notified. 92",

            "text": "In the spring of 1985, several dairy cows in the United Kingdom displayed aggressive behavior, ataxia, and falling. These \"mad cows\" were found to have spongiform lesions in brain tissue resembling scrapie that was subsequently termed bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE). More than 180,000 cattle succumbed to BSE, but almost 1 million may have been infected. Because the mean incubation period for BSE is 5 years and most cows were slaughtered between 2 and 3 years of age, most cattle did not manifest disease. [91] [92] [93] Approximately 50,000 BSE-infected cattle entered the food chain before the first BSE case was recognized in 1986. Subsequently, the onset of the BSE epidemic was traced to a meat-and-bone cattle feed made from sheep, cattle, and pig offal. The rendering process presumably resulted in the feeding of scrapie-infected material to cows. Use of sheep offal or other tissues from ruminant animals as feed for other ruminant animals was banned in 1989. The annual incidence of clinical cases in cattle peaked in 1992. After March 1996, only animals younger than 30 months were eligible for food preparation. 93 Surveillance for human CJD cases heightened in the United Kingdom after recognition of the BSE epidemic. Ten of 207 CJD patients in 1994 and 1995 had unusual neuropathologic changes. 103, 104 They had predominantly psychiatric and sensory symptoms, ataxia, dementia, and myoclonus. All were younger than 45 years, a distinctly unusual characteristic for CJD. Electroencephalographic features were not typical of CJD, and florid PrP plaques were seen on neuropathologic examination. Median survival time was 14 months, in contrast to 4 months for CJD. These cases were considered a new variant of CJD (vCJD). The median incubation period for food-borne vCJD is 13 years. 105 Extensive investigations using animal models provided evidence that the same prion strain causes BSE and vCJD. 106 Ingestion of British beef, therefore, was identified as a risk factor for BSE. 107 As of June 2006, 159 cases of vCJD have been reported in the United Kingdom, 17 in France, 4 in Ireland, 1 each in Portugal, Spain, Italy, the Netherlands, Saudi Arabia, Japan, and Canada, and 2 in the United States. The latter three plus one Irish patient were thought to result from exposure in the United Kingdom. The Japanese patient spent only 24 days in the United Kingdom. All patients tested were homozygous for methionine at PrP codon 129. By 2000, the incidence of human vCJD cases peaked, suggesting that clinical manifestations among methionine/methionine homozygotes may be less than anticipated after extensive exposure to cattle with subclinical disease. 105, 108, 109 Concern about transfusion transmission of vCJD increased because PrP sc is found consistently in the lymphoreticular system of vCJD patients, the possibility that circulating prions transfer the infection from the gut to the brain, and eventually because of animal studies. 105, 108, 109 In animal model experiments, sheep were fed aliquots of brain obtained from BSE-infected cattle. Subsequently, the sheep underwent phlebotomy at periodic intervals. Among 24 sheep receiving blood from iatrogenically infected donor sheep, 2 given blood from donors in the preclinical BSE phase developed BSE, and 2 receiving blood from clinically affected sheep showed clinical signs of BSE. Among 21 sheep transfused with blood from natural scrapie-infected animals, 4 demonstrated clinical signs of scrapie. 110, 111 An active investigation to determine whether transfusion associated-vCJD transmission occurs in humans began in the United Kingdom in 1997 by identifying vCJD patients who donated blood before illness. Eventually, 48 recipients of blood from 15 donors with vCJD were identified. Three of the 48 recipients, to date, have evidence of vCJD. One, at age 62 years, received non-leukocyte-reduced RBCs from a 24year-old donor who developed vCJD 3.5 years after the blood donation. The transfusion recipient developed vCJD 6.5 years after transfusion. 112 The second patient received a transfusion of non-leukocyte-reduced RBCs in 1999. 113 The donor developed vCJD 18 months later. The asymptomatic recipient died of a ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm 5 years after transfusion. At autopsy, protease-resistant prions were present in the spleen and cervical lymph nodes. Prions were not detected in the brain. The recipient, found to be heterozygous (methionine/valine at codon 129), did not have clinical vCJD, raising concern that the incubation period may be longer in codon 129 heterozygotes. In animal studies, a primary challenge with vCJD prions resulted in a significantly reduced transmission rate in mice with valine at codon 129 compared with that in animals homozygous for methionine. 114 Additional data are needed to confirm whether the incubation period varies among methionine homozygous and heterozygous individuals. The third case developed vCJD approximately 8 years after receiving non-leukocyte-reduced red cells from a person who developed vCJD 20 months postdonation. 114a The U.K. National Blood Service also determined that approximately 100 people donated blood to four patients who subsequently showed clinical signs of vCJD. These donors were notified that they may be at higher risk of developing vCJD despite the uncertainty of whether the patients contracted vCJD through food or blood transfusion. In addition, UK authorities notified recipients of factor XI concentrates that donors of these components developed vCJD after donation on the ethical tenet of transparency. The United Kingdom currently imports plasma from the United States for patients younger than 16 years and uses apheresis-derived platelets in these patients to reduce donor exposures. 94, 116 The identification of presumed transfusion-associated vCJD cases appears to validate the steps taken in response to the precautionary principle to decrease the risk of transmitting vCJD by transfusion. 92 Donors who visited or resided in the United Kingdom for a cumulative period of 3 months or longer between 1980 and 1996 are deferred indefinitely. Donors who spent 5 years or more in Europe before 1980 and the present are also deferred. In addition, donors are indefinitely deferred if they injected bovine insulin after 1980, received transfusions in the United Kingdom and France between 1980 and the present, or served in the military on bases in Europe for 6 months or more between 1980 and 1996. This geography-based donor-deferral protocol evolved in various phases beginning in 1999. Approximately 3.5% of potential donors in the United States have been deferred as a result of this policy. 117 The impact was higher in Canada. 118 In-date blood components and plasma intended for derivative production from these donors must be recalled, quarantined, and destroyed. Ongoing surveillance of vCJD cases, which increased after identification of a Texas cow with BSE, is currently being conducted, including a recommendation to notify the CDC about all patients younger than 55 years who are diagnosed with CJD. 115 In addition to geographic exclusion policies, other strategies for preventing vCJD transmission include removal of the infectious agent and testing. In the United Kingdom, all blood components undergo leukocyte reduction by filtration, based on observations that prions associate with leukocytes. Leukocyte reduction, however, is only partially effective, removing only 42% of total prion infectivity. 120 Filters that specifically remove prions and laboratory tests that detect infectious prions are currently being developed and evaluated. The latter, if implemented, will be accompanied by significant ethical concerns. 119",

            "text": "Visceral forms of leishmaniasis result from infection with Leishmania donovani or Leishmania infantum. Cutaneous lesions occur in persons infected with Leishmania braziliensis or Leishmania tropica, the cause of Old World cutaneous leishmaniasis. However, at least eight soldiers returning from eastern Saudi Arabia after Operation Desert Storm developed visceral leishmaniasis that was attributed to L. tropica. 121, 122 The leishmania organisms, transmitted primarily by bites from infected sand flies, are endemic in the tropical and subtropical regions of the Sudan, Eastern India, Bangladesh, Nepal, Brazil, and the Mediterranean. 123 After transmission by sand fly bite, parasites reside intracellularly in monocytes, which circulate before taking up residence in internal organs. In the most severe manifestation of visceral leishmaniasis, kala-azar, patients have marked hepatosplenomegaly, pancytopenia, hypergammaglobulinemia, and cachexia. The incubation period is approximately 6 months. 123 Anti-L. donovani antibodies form shortly after infection. In studies conducted in Brazil, 21 seropositive asymptomatic blood donors were found to have positive PCR results for L. donovani, demonstrating the ongoing potential of transfusion transmission in endemic areas. 124 At least 10 transfusion-associated cases of leishmaniasis attributed to L. donovani have been reported in endemic regions. Most of those infected were young children or neonates. A probable case of platelet transfusion-transmitted Leishmania was reported recently. 125 Transfusion-transmission also appears to occur in dogs receiving transfusions of RBCs from seropositive dog-blood donors. 126 Veterans of Operation Desert Storm who served in the Persian Gulf region between August 1990 and December 1992 were deferred from blood donation for 1 year, after the report of L. tropica-related viscerotropic leishmaniasis. The patients had nonspecific clinical manifestations, including prolonged fever, malaise, abdominal pain, and intermittent diarrhea, which occurred up to 7 months after they returned to the United States. 121 L. tropica was found in the bone marrow of seven patients and in a lymph node in one patient. Intracellular amastigotes were seen in the peripheral blood of the one patient in whom this was studied. 127 After reports of hundreds of cases of cutaneous leishmaniasis and two cases of visceral leishmaniasis in troops involved in the Iraq war, a similar 1-year deferral after departure from Iraq was instituted in October 2003. 127 L. tropica within human monocytes survives in blood stored at 1\u00b0 C to 6\u00b0 C, in frozen RBCs, and in platelet concentrates stored at room temperature. However, L. tropica has not been detected in relatively cell-free fresh frozen plasma. Animal studies demonstrate transmission by contaminated blood. 126 No cases of transfusion-transmitted leishmaniasis have been reported in the United States to date. For this reason, surveillance and targeted donor deferral appear to be appropriate. Use of leukocyte filters to reduce Leishmania transmission is under investigation. 128",

In high WNV endemic areas, 1 in approximately 150 donors was WNV viremic. In 2003, six transfusion-associated WNV cases were reported. 158 All of the implicated donors had extremely low-level viremia that escaped detection by routine testing in minipools containing aliquots from 6 to 16 donations. Testing of individual samples in high-incidence areas increases test sensitivity by approximately 7% and was introduced in 2004 when incident cases exceeded preestablished thresholds (approximately 1 WNV-positive donor per 1000 donations). Only one confirmed transmission occurred in 2004. Among the 30 confirmed transfusion cases, all implicated donations were WNV IgM antibody negative. 164, 165 A second transplant-associated incident involving three of four organ recipients who developed WNV infection after transplant was reported in 2005. 166 Of note, the organ donor (infected through mosquito bites) was WNV RNA positive and IgM antibody positive. This report raises concern that organ-transplant recipients and other heavily immunosuppressed patients are at extremely high risk for severe WNV complications and that the virus remains viable in organ/ tissue reservoirs despite a humoral immune response.",
