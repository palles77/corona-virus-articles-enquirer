Four of the mAbs assayed were specific for the viral protein M and two of them gave plasma membrane immunofluorescence and mediated cytolysis in the presence of complement. The viral nucleoprotein N could not be demonstrated on the surface of infected cells either by iodination or employing 3 mAbs against this protein. Finally, a time course infection experiment demonstrated that S and M proteins were expressed on the surface of infected cells at 4 h after infection, before infective virus was released from infected cells.",

Immunoprecipitates of labeled cell extracts, with serum from a sow immunized with the virulent TGEV strain MAD 88 (Laviada et al., 1988; Sanchez et al., 1989) , were analyzed by SDS-PAGE electrophoresis (Escribano and Tabarts, 1987) .

Charley and Laude (1988) were able to induce high alpha interferon production using epithelial cells infected with the TGEV and fixed by glutaraldehyde. Two mAbs directed against the M protein inhibited the interferon-inducing capacity of both TGEV-infected cells and viral particles. The authors suggested that interferon induction by TGEV resulted from interactions between an outer membrane domain of the M protein and the peripheral blood mononuclear cell membranes. Some of the identified protein epitopes, as exposed on the surface of infected cells, could play a key role in the induction of alpha interferon. According to its predicted amino acid sequence, the TGEV M glycoprotein is mainly buried in the viral lipid membrane (Laude et al., 1987) . However, the amino terminus of the TGEV M protein extends 54 amino acids from the virion envelope which compares with only 28 for bovine coronavirus (BCV), 26 for MHV, and 21 for avian infectious bronchitis coronavirus (IBV) (Kapke et al., 1988) . Eleven of the sixteen amino-terminal amino acids are hydrophobic and the positions of charged amino acids around this sequence suggest that the first 16 amino acids comprise a potentially cleavable signal peptide for membrane insertion. A similar sequence is not found in the M proteins of BCV, MHV, or IBV. Because of this modification in the amino-terminal hydrophobic sequence of the TGEV M protein it has been suggested that this protein may behave differently from its MHV, BCV or IBV counterparts with regard to intracellular trafficking (Kapke et al., 1988) . These findings could explain the insertion of TGEV M protein into the plasma membrane of infected cells, in contrast to the M protein of MHV that migrates to the Golgi apparatus, but is not transported to the plasma membrane (Sturman and Holmes, 1983) . Further experiments in morphogenesis and M protein migration of TGEV must be done to clarify this phenomenon.
