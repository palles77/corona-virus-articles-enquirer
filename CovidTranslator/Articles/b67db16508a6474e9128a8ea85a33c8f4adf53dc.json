            "text": "Keywords: Feline infectious peritonitis; diethylcarbamazine; immunomodulator drugs Diethylcarbamazine (DEC) has long been used in the treatment of filariasis in humans. The anti-infective action of DEC in filarial infections has been attributed to immunomodulation 12. Previous investigators have suggested that one possible mode of action of DEC is to 'opsonize' microfilariae 1. Other studies showed that DEC increased adherence of microfilariae to peripheral white blood cells in vitro in the presence of human serum containing high titres of antibody to microfilarial sheaths 3. Although recent research indicates that killing of microfilariae results from DEC-induced plateletderived free radicals 4, there is also evidence that an 'opsonic' activity of DEC may promote peripheral white blood cell/antigen interactions, and that this may in part account for the immune responses to filarial antigens noted after successful DEC treatment of human filariasis 2.",

In the present report, seven diethylcarbamazineotreated cats developed higher serum antibody awes to feline infectious peritonitis more frequently than did seven untreated controls. Since feline infectious peritonitis is caused by a coronavirus, these results suggest that diethylcarbamazine treatment could be exploited for vaccination and treatment strategies for non-retroviral in addition to retroviral infections."

            "text": "That DEC treatment resulted in development of serum antibodies to feline oncornavirus-associated cell membrane antigen (FOCMA) in nine FeLV-infected cats previously giving negative results for this antibody suggested that DEC might increase antibody titres to a wide variety of infectious agents. Antibody to FOCMA in FeLV-infected cats has been associated with resistance to FeLV-related neoplasias 5. DEC treatment given with FeLV vaccine has resulted in increased titres and duration of antibody to FOCMA in two FeLV-naive cats in comparison to two FeLV-naive cats given vaccine without DEC. In addition, DEC treatment of cats with household exposure to FeLV giving negative results for FeLV antigens in peripheral blood leucocytes resulted in increased titres of antibody to FOCMA in such cats 6'7. The present report examines the effect of DEC treatment on serum antibodies to feline infectious peritonitis (FIP). FIP, caused by a coronavirus, is a common and often fatal opportunistic infection in FeLVinfected cats. Approximately 50% of clinically evident FIP infections occur in FeLV-infected cats 9. The effect of DEC treatment on serum antibodies to toxoplasmosis, which rarely causes clinical disease in FeLV cats, was also investigated.",

            "text": "Fourteen cats were studied; seven of these 14 were treated with DEC and seven were untreated. Each group of seven consisted of three FeLV leucocyte antigen negative cats given 1 ml Leukocell FeLV vaccine i.m. (Norden Laboratories, Lincoln, NE, USA) and four FeLV-infected cats. All four FeLV-infected cats gave positive results for FeLV antigens in peripheral blood leucocytes (determined by Dr W.D. Hardy, Jr and coworkers, Laboratory of Veterinary Oncology, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY, USA). All 14 cats were tested for FeLV leucocyte antigens twice, at 0 and 8 weeks, when serum samples were drawn for FIP antibody titres. Details regarding the mode of infection of the FeLVinfected cats are given in Table 1 . Results of studies regarding the effect of DEC on FeLV infection in these cats have been described 6'1\u00b0. DEC was given orally at 10 mg kg -1 day -1 as a single daily dose for courses ranging from 2 weeks to continuous treatment, as stated in Table 1 . All 14 cats were housed at the Harvard School of Public Health. Serum samples were drawn before DEC treatment and 8 weeks later. Titres of serum antibody to feline infectious peritonitis and toxoplasmosis were determined under code via indirect Dahlberg strain of FIP and the RH strain of toxoplasmosis were used for these studies. All 14 cats remained healthy throughout the study period.",

In the treated group, three cats showed significant rises in serum antibody titres to FIP. Such titres increased fourfold in two treated cats. Of these, one cat was FeLV-infected and one was FeLV-vaccinated/previously FeLV-naive. Serum antibodies to FIP increased 16-fold (repeated to ensure accuracy) in an additional DEC-treated FeLV-infected cat. Furthermore, some increases in serum antibody titres to FIP were noted in both DEC-treated, FeLV-vaccinated cats that were previously FeLV-naive, whereas no titre increases were observed in the DEC-untreated vaccinated controls (see Table 1 ). Thirteen of the 14 observed cats gave negative results (<1:16 titre) for serum antibody to toxoplasmosis. The one cat giving positive results (1:64 titre) for toxoplasmosis antibody was treated with DEC; the titre did not change after treatment. These data may reflect lack of evidence for active toxoplasmosis infection in the 14 cats.",
