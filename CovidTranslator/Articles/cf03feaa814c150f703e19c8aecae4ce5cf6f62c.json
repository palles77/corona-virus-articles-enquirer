[5] [6] [7] [8] [9] In particular, accumulating evidence has shown that SARS-CoV-2 exhibits effective human-to-human transmission, causing an exponential growth of new cases. 6, [10] [11] [12] The strong transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 and a substantial number of patients who are either asymptomatic or have only mild symptoms 2,3,12 present great challenges for anesthesiologists to perform anesthetic management and successful infection prevention and control. Even though studies have been published for SARS-CoV-2\u00c0related infection prevention and control during anesthesia in emergency surgery, 13 unfortunately, there are no guidelines on the anesthetic management for patients with suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection undergoing long, complicated cardiac surgeries.",

In addition, COVID-19 patients may present with mild symptoms or nonspecific signs in the early stage of disease but still are infectious. 12, 16 Therefore, all perioperative healthcare providers need to adopt third-level medical protection measures, including medical-degree eyeprotective goggles, medical-degree mask, face shield, gloves, disposable protective clothing, and disposable outer shoe covers. 13 Training personnel on the correct use of these precautions is important because incorrect use may cause potential nosocomial infections and exponential spread of SARS-CoV-2.",

Moderate hypothermia and decreased humidity in the operating room can make staff more comfortable, reduce sweating, and reduce the risk of infection. Applying anti-fog agents on protective goggles in advance can effectively reduce the fogging and water accumulation from breath and sweat evaporation. Long procedures increase the risk of perioperative aerosol infections; therefore, the authors recommend the use of medical adhesive tape to strengthen the connection between the goggles and mask, between the goggles and the protective clothing cap, and between the mouth and nose of the protective clothing to effectively prevent an insufficient seal. In addition, protective equipment should be replaced frequently to maintain the best protective function.",
