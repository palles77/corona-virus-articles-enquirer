ACE2 150 staining is rarely seen in esophageal mucosa probably because esophageal epithelium 151 is mainly composed of squamous epithelial cells, while gastrointestinal epithelium 152 below esophagus has abundant ACE2-expressed glandular epithelial cells. 153 Coronavirus genome encodes the spike protein, nucleocapsid protein, membrane 154 protein and envelop protein to form a complete viral particle 7 . Beyond binding to viral 155 genome to make up nucleocapsid, the nucleocapsid protein (NP) localizes to 156 endoplasmic reticulum-Golgi region to facilitate viral assembly and budding 8 . Our 157 results of viral RNA detection and intracellular staining of NP in gastric, duodenal and 158 rectal epithelia demonstrate that SARS-CoV-2 infects these gastrointestinal glandular 159 epithelial cells. Although viral RNA was also detected in esophageal mucous tissue, 160 absence of NP staining in esophageal mucosa indicates low viral infection in 161 esophageal mucosa probably due to lack of ACE2 protein expression. The data of 162 viral protein staining are in line with the data of ACE2 staining, confirming the 163 importance of ACE2 protein expression for SARS-CoV-2 infection. 164 After viral entry, virus-specific RNA and proteins are synthesized in the cytoplasm to 165 assembly new virions 9 , which can be released to gastrointestinal tract. Recently, we 166 and others have isolated infectious SARS-CoV-2 from stool (Manuscript under the release of the infectious virions to the gastrointestinal tract. 168 Therefore, fecal-oral transmission could be an additional route for SARS-CoV-2 169 spread. Prevention of viral fecal-oral transmission should be taken into consideration 170 to control the spread the virus. 171 The immune response to the viral infection of gastrointestinal tract needs to be further 172 investigated. In this report, we observed infiltration of plasma cells and lymphocytes 173 without obvious damage in gastrointestinal mucosa. The lesion and bleeding of the 174 esophageal mucosa from a case of SARS-CoV-2 infection was probably 175 stress-associated. 176 Our results highlight the clinical significance of testing viral RNA in feces by 177 real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) since infectious 178 virions released from gastrointestinal tract can be monitored by the test. According to 179 the current CDC guidance for disposition of patients with SARS-CoV-2, the decision 180 to discontinue Transmission-Based Precautions for hospitalized SARS-CoV-2 patients 181 is based on negative results of rRT-PCR testing for SARS-CoV-2 from at least two 182 sequential respiratory tract specimens collected \u226524 hours apart 10 . However, we 183 observed in more than 20% of SARS-CoV-2 patients that the viral RNA remained 184 positive in feces even after negative conversion of the viral RNA in respiratory tract, 185 indicating that viral fecal-oral transmission can occur even after viral clearance in 186 respiratory tract. Therefore, we strongly recommend that rRT-PCR testing for 187 SARS-CoV-2 from feces should be performed routinely in SARS-CoV-2-infected 188 patients, and Transmission-Based Precautions for hospitalized SARS-CoV-2-infected 189 .",
