            "text": "Hand, foot and mouth disease (HFMD) is a common condition, especially in children <5 years of age. 1 A seroprevalence study in Singapore showed that half of children aged 5 years had antibody to enterovirus (EV) 71, which is a commonly identified virus causing HFMD. 1 Although most patients present with mild illness including fever, skin vesicles or rash, some children may suffer from severe complications such as meningitis, encephalitis, acute flaccid paralysis, myocariditis, pulmonary oedema or even death. 2e7 Since the 1970s, HFMD epidemics have been reported in Bulgaria, Hungary, the UK, the USA, Australia and India, with significant numbers of cases of aseptic meningitis, brain stem encephalitis and death. 8e11 From 1997 to 2000, areas in South East Asia including Malaysia, Taiwan, Singapore and Japan also experienced HFMD epidemics. 1,12e15 The largest reported outbreak occurred in Taiwan in 1998, accounting for >100,000 cases of HFMD, 400 severe illnesses and 78 deaths. 13 The potential public health impact of HFMD in Hong Kong has captured much attention. In 2008, another epidemic affected South East Asia, including Mainland China, Taiwan, Singapore and Hong Kong. 16e19 Apart from mortality and morbidity, outbreaks occurring in school settings caused significant social disturbance to children, their families and teachers. In large school outbreaks of HFMD or outbreaks associated with EV71 in Hong Kong and Singapore, the Health Authority may have to suspend classes or close schools in order to prevent disease transmission. 18, 20 Unfortunately, there is currently no effective vaccination or chemoprophylaxis for the prevention of HFMD. When large community outbreaks occur, public health actions including increasing public awareness, vigilance of personal and environmental hygiene, and social distancing may be necessary to stop disease transmission. A sensitive surveillance system is therefore essential for early detection of community outbreaks in order to guide public health actions. In Hong Kong, HFMD was added to the sentinel surveillance system (SSS) in 1998. The main objectives were to monitor HFMD trends in Hong Kong and to enable early detection of community epidemics, which in turn helps to initiate timely preventive measures. The SSS includes over 100 sentinel clinics, including approximately 40 general practitioners (GPs) and 60 general outpatient clinics (GOPCs). GPs are doctors who practice in the private sector while GOPCs are public outpatient clinics. They are all distributed throughout the territory.",

The positive viral culture rate was calculated by dividing the weekly number of specimens positive for enterovirus by the weekly total number of specimens performed. The enteroviruses included Coxsackie A and B, EV71, EV68, echovirus and some untyped enterovirus. Coxsackie A24 was excluded because it was associated with acute conjunctivitis instead of HFMD. The Pearson correlation coefficient of the weekly consultation rate with the positive viral culture rate was calculated. The HFMD consultation rate from the SSS was plotted on a monthly basis to document seasonal trends. HFMD cases were broken down by age group to determine the most susceptible group.",

When the consultation rate or viral culture rate was above the threshold in a particular week, it was considered to be an epidemic week. Conversely, when the consultation rate or viral culture rate was below the threshold in a particular week, it was considered to be a nonepidemic week. Using the control chart method, the threshold level was calculated as two standard deviations (SD) above the 'baseline level'. The 'baseline level' was the mean consultation rate or viral culture rate of the study period, after excluding extreme values above the 80th percentile. The respective epidemic and non-epidemic weeks for the consultation rate and viral culture rate were then determined, and sensitivity, specificity and PPV were calculated. Sensitivity analysis was conducted by varying the 'baseline level' and threshold level.",

The collection of simple data by GPs enables disease activity to be monitored at an early phase, compared with other data such as laboratory tests or hospital discharge diagnoses. In Taiwan, Japan and Malaysia, SSSs have been implemented to monitor HFMD in the community in order to allow the health authorities to issue early warning of seasonal activity, detect abnormal outbreaks and assess the impact of public health control measures. Surveillance is an ongoing activity and programme evaluation is prudent for health authorities to demonstrate accountability and identify room for improvement. This is the first comprehensive evaluation of the HFMD SSS in Hong Kong since its establishment. The overall performance of this system was considered to be reasonably good. It has fulfilled its main objectives to monitor HFMD trends and to assist with the detection of community epidemics. Few evaluation reports from other countries were found in the literature for comparison. However, one published report from Japan 29 reported sensitivity, specificity and PVP of the Japanese SSS of 59.7%, 98.9% and 40.1%, respectively.

The sensitivity analysis performed showed that this evaluation has obtained relatively balanced values for sensitivity, specificity and PPV. The participation rate among GOPCs was consistently higher than that among GPs. However, in the acceptability survey, GOPCs were less satisfied with all aspects than GPs.
