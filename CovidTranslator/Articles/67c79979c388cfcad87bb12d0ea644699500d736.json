Inhaled zanamivir shortened the duration of major influenza symptoms by 3 days compared with placebo in individuals who were febrile at enrollment and received zanamivir within 30 h (3) .

Of course, these values vary depending on the prevalence of influenza in the community relative to other respiratory infections.

Other respiratory viruses, including but not limited to: respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), adenovirus, parainfluenza, rhinovirus, coronavirus or human metapneumovirus infection, may account for those with non-influenza infection.

Oseltamivir is available in 30 mg, 45 mg, and 75 mg capsules, and as a powder for oral suspension that is reconstituted to provide a final concentration of either 6 mg/mL or 12 mg/mL. If the commercially manufactured oral suspension is not available, the capsules may be opened and the contents mixed with a sweetened liquid to mask the bitter taste or a suspension can be compounded by retail pharmacies (final concentration 15 mg/mL). When dispensing commercially manufactured Oseltamivir (TAMIFLU) Powder for Oral Suspension (6 mg/mL or 12 mg/mL), pharmacists should ensure the units of measure on the prescription instructions match the dosing device. 2. The above dosage provides oseltamivir exposure in children similar to that achieved by the approved dose of 75 mg orally twice daily for adults(13)(14)(15). It is strongly suggested that an infectious disease physician or clinical pharmacist be consulted in the case of premature infants for whom treatment with oseltamivir is being considered. The current weight-based dosing recommendations are not appropriate for premature infants as they might have slower clearance of oral oseltamivir because of immature renal function. The following dosing is recommendations from the CDC and the AAP[14] and is based on data from the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases Collaborative Antiviral Study Group using the infants' Zanamivir is administered by inhalation using a proprietary \"Diskhaler\" device distributed together with the medication. Zanamivir is a dry powder, not an aerosol, and should not be administered using nebulizers, ventilators, or other devices typically used for administering medications in aerosolized solutions. Zanamivir is not recommended for persons with chronic respiratory diseases such as asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease that increase the risk of bronchospasm.",
