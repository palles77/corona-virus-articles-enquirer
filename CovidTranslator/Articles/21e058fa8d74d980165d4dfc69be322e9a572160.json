The predictions obtained -for a time horizon of 10 days starting from March 29th -will be provided at a national as well as at a more disaggregate levels, following a criterion based on the magnitude of the phenomenon. While the Regions which have been hit the most by the pandemic have been kept separated, the less affected ones have been aggregated into homogeneous macro-areas. Results show that -within the forecast period considered (March 29 th -April 7 th )all of the Italian regions will show a decreasing number of CoViD-19 positive people. Same for the number of people who will need to be hospitalized in a Intensive Care Unit (ICU). These estimates are valid under constancy of the Government's current containment policies. In this scenario, Northern Regions will remain the most affected ones and no significant outbreak are foreseen in the southern regions.",

In particular, predicting the number of people currently tested positive for CoViD-19 (thereafter \"positive cases\") could be useful to draw the epidemiological curve of the infection and therefore to predict its peak. Other than for this variable, the forecasting procedure presented in this paper is used to predict the future values of another crucial variable, i.e. the number of people needing hospitalization in a Intensive Care Unit (ICU). The Italian ICUs system is at the moment severely stressed due to the spread of the disease, therefore predictions of future ICUs demand could be fruitfully considered in the design and the implementation of operational schemes. The forecast horizon for both the variables is of 10-day starting from March 29th.",

In fact, the typical lab-workflow is governed by a set of rigid protocols which might be critically affected by factors such as the availability of manpower, swabs, reagents and other laboratory materials. In emergency situations, such a workflow can be disrupted and temporal inconsistency might appear as a result. For example, a set of samples might be delivered to a laboratory with longer than usual delays with respect to the time of collection or a given lab can only complete a screening process for a certain number of samples. In both the cases, one day (or more) shift in the release of the lab results can be reasonably expected. A further source of anomalies is represented by the data entry and data editing processes, carried out in working environment necessarily affected by the risk of contagious and under rigid deadlines.",

Among the several resampling methods for dependent data available -many of which freely and publicly available in the form of powerful routines working under software packages such as Python \u00ae or R \u00ae -the adopted resampling method is of the type Maximum Entropy Bootstrap (MEB). Proposed by Vinod (2006) and subsequently improved (see, e.g., Vinod (2016) ), it is based on basic assumptions which are different from those usually followed by standard schemes. In more details, while in the classic bootstrap an ensemble \u2126 represents the population of reference the observed time series is drawn from, in MEB a large number of ensembles (subsets), say {\u03c9 1 , . . . , \u03c9 N } becomes the elements belonging to \u2126, each of them containing a large number of replicates {x 1 , . . . , x J }.",
