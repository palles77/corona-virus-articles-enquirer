Focusing on hydrophobic interactions at the S 2 site, the decahydroisoquinolin scaffold was designed by connecting the P 2 site cyclohexyl group of the substrate-based inhibitor to the main-chain at the a-nitrogen atom of the P 2 position via a methylene linker. Starting from a cyclohexene enantiomer obtained by salt resolution, transdecahydroisoquinolin derivatives were synthesized. All decahydroisoquinolin inhibitors synthesized showed moderate but clear inhibitory activities for SARS 3CL pro , which confirmed the fused ring structure of the decahydroisoquinolin functions as a novel scaffold for SARS 3CL pro inhibitor. X-ray crystallographic analyses of the SARS 3CL pro in a complex with the decahydroisoquinolin inhibitor revealed the expected interactions at the S 1 and S 2 sites, as well as additional interactions at the N-substituent of the inhibitor.",

            "text": "SARS is a positive-sense, single-stranded RNA virus featuring the largest known viral RNA which produces two large proteins with overlapping sequences, polyproteins 1a ($450 kDa) and 1ab ($750 kDa). 8-10 SARS 3CL (chymotrypsin like) protease (3CL pro ) is a key enzyme to cleave the polyproteins to yield functional polypeptides. 11, 12 The 3CL pro is a cysteine protease containing a Cys-His catalytic dyad and it exists as a homodimer; each monomer contains the catalytic dyad at each active site. Due to its functional importance in the viral life cycle, 3CL pro is considered an attractive target for the structure-based design of drugs against SARS. Thus, numerous inhibitors of 3CL pro have been reported including peptide-mimics [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] and small molecules derived from natural products, [18] [19] [20] anti-viral agents, 21, 22 anti-malaria agents, 23 or high throughput screening. [24] [25] [26] [27] In the course of our own studies on the SARS 3CL pro and its inhibitors, 28 we found that the addition of an extra sequence to the N-or C-terminus of the mature SARS 3CL pro lowered the catalytic activity and that the mature SARS 3CL pro is sensitive to degradation at the 188Arg/189Gln site, which causes a loss of catalytic activity. The stability of 3CL pro is dramatically increased by mutating the Arg at the 188 position to Ile. The enzymatic efficiency of the R188I mutant was increased by a factor of more than 1 \u00c2 10 6 . The potency of the mutant protease makes it possible to quantitatively evaluate substrate-based peptide-mimetic inhibitors easily by conventional HPLC using a substrate peptide containing no fluorescence derivatives. The evaluations revealed that a peptide aldehyde covering the P-site sequence of substrate, Ac-Ser-Ala-Val-Leu-NHCH(CH 2 CH 2 CON(CH 3 ) 2 )-CHO, inhibits the SARS 3CL pro with an IC 50 value of 37 lM. Systematic modification guided by the X-ray crystal structure of a series of peptide-mimics in a complex with R188I SARS 3CL pro resulted in 1 with an IC 50 value of 98 nM (Fig. 1) . 13 All of the side-chain structures of 1 differed from the substrate sequence except at the P 3 site, where the side-chain was directed outward. Kinetic inhibition data for 1 obtained from Lineweaver-Burk plots suggested that inhibitors containing an aldehyde at the C-terminus can be expected to function as competitive inhibitors.",

Among the key interactions clarified by X-ray crystallographic study, we focused on hydrophobic interactions at the cyclohexyl side-chain to design a novel inhibitor scaffold. Thus, the cyclohexyl ring is connected to the main-chain at an a-nitrogen atom of the P 2 position Cha (cyclohexylalanine) via a methylene linker to yield compound 2 (Fig. 1) . The resulting decahydroisoquinolin scaffold of 2 is expected to keep the hydrophobic interactions at the cyclohexyl ring of the substrate-based inhibitor at the S 2 pocket. In addition, the resulting decahydroisoquinolin scaffold arranges the P 1 site imidazole and active site functional aldehyde at each required position, giving the fused-ring structure of decahydroisoquinolin as a scaffold for a novel inhibitor. The acyl substituent on the nitrogen in the decahydroisoquinolin scaffold may add an extra position for the interactions with the 3CL pro .",

The known ester 6 was first reacted with butadiene to construct the six-membered ring structure to yield 7 as an enantiomer mixture of 1,6-trans-substituted cyclohexene. The product was reduced with LAH and the resulting alcohol was then protected as tert-butyldiphenylsilyl ether to give 8. The benzyl group was removed by catalytic hydrogenation, which reduced the cyclohexene to cyclohexane at the same time. The resulting hydroxyl group was then oxidized with PCC and the resulting aldehyde was then reacted with (EtO) 2 P(O)CH 2 COOEt to yield 9. The ethyl ester of 9 was reduced with DIBALH and the resulting alcohol was protected as acetyl ester to give 10. After treatment with TBAF, the resulting alcohol was converted to the azide derivative 11 by a Mitsunobu reaction. Since the product 11 was rather unstable, 11 was immediately reduced to the corresponding amine. Without further purification, the amine derivative was coupled with p-phenylbenzoic acid using HBTU to yield 12 as an enantiomer mixture. Coupling with p-bromobenzoic acid was similarly conducted to yield a related derivative 13.",

The product was an enantiomer mixture which was thought to have the relative configuration of 14/15 due to the cyclization through a less hindered Pd-chelated intermediate. Thus, the vinyl substituent of the product 14/15 was thought to be axial, which was clearly confirmed by X-ray crystallographic studies of the inhibitor in a complex with the R188I mutant SARS 3CL pro as discussed below. The olefin bond of 14/15 was oxidatively cleaved by the treatment with K 2 O s O 2 (OH) 4 followed by NaIO 4 to yield aldehyde 16/17. Reductive amination by H-His(Trt)-N(OCH 3 )-CH 3 gave the coupling products 18 and 20 or 19 and 21 as a 1:1 diastereomer mixture which was separable on a reversed-phase column (YMC Pack ODS) by analytical HPLC (Fig. S1 ). The diastereomers could also be separated by conventional silica-gel column chromatography to yield diastereomers 18 and 20 or 19 and 21, each having single peak on the above reversed-phase column.

The aldehyde group and imidazole ring of His-al, as well as the decahydroisoquinolin structure of 41, had an almost identical conformation with 1 and similarly interacted with 3CL pro . In contrast, the direction of the p-bromobenzoyl group was outward from 3CL pro and opposite to the P 3 to P 4 sites of 1. The N-p-bromobenzoyl group, however, was at the surface of 3CL pro , where additional hydrophobic interaction with Met of the 3CL pro may be possible (Fig. S7 ). The carbonyl carbon of the aldehyde group in 41 was detected at a distance of 2.43 \u00c5 from the active center thiol of Cys-145, and its electron density could be fitted to an sp 2 carbonyl carbon as in 1 (Fig. 3i) . The results suggest that the decahydroisoquinolin inhibitor would function as a competitive inhibitor as do the peptide-aldehyde inhibitor 1. 13 It was clearly confirmed that the decahydroisoquinolin scaffold of 41 took a trans-fused (4aR,8aS) configuration, as expected from the salt-resolution of enantiomixture 29. It was also confirmed that the P 1 His-al substituent on the decahydroisoquinolin scaffold took an axial-configuration, as expected from the Pd(II)-mediated cyclization. The decahydroiso-quinolin scaffold of 41 was inserted into a large S 2 pocket created by His-41, Met-49, Met-165, and Asp-187, as in the case of a parent peptide aldehyde inhibitor, and most of the S 2 pocket was occupied by the fused-ring structure of decahydroisoquinolin (Fig. 3i) . The nitrogen atom of the P 1 site imidazole of 41 formed a hydrogen bond with the imidazole nitrogen of His-163, resulting in close fitting at the other side of the S 1 pocket formed from the Phe-140, Leu-141, and Glu-166 side chains of the protease (Fig. 3ii ). These interactions, especially of the decahydroisoquinolin scaffold in the S 2 pocket, function to hold the P 1 site imidazole and terminal aldehyde tightly inside the active site cleft, which resulted in the compact fitting of the novel scaffold to the 3CL pro .",

This conformation change of the decahydroisoquinolin scaffold transferred to the direction of the N-substituent. Thus, the substituent of (4aR,8aS) decahydroisoquinolin 40 took nearly the same conformation as the N-p-bromobenzoyl inhibitor 41 located on the surface of the 3CL pro , whereas the substituent of (4aS,8aR) decahydroisoquinolin directed outside from the protease surface.

By X-ray crystallographic studies, it was confirmed that the decahydroisoquinolin inhibitors were at the active site cleft of 3CL pro , as observed in the highly potent peptide-aldehyde inhibitor. The decahydroisoquinolin scaffold was inserted into a large S 2 pocket and occupied most of the pocket. The P 1 site imidazole was inserted into the S 1 pocket as expected. These interactions were effective to hold the terminal aldehyde tightly inside the active site cleft, which resulted in the compact fitting of the novel scaffold to 3CL pro . The acyl substituent on the nitrogen in the decahydroisoquinolin scaffold was at the surface of the 3CL pro , where additional interactions with the 3CL pro may be possible. Evaluations on the analogs focusing on the interactions at the N-substituent are now underway.",

All commercial reagents were of the highest purity available. Analytical TLC was performed on silica gel (60 F-254, 0.25 mm Plates). Column chromatography was carried out on Wakogel C-200E (particle size, 75-150 lm) or Wakogel FC-40 (particle size, 20-40 lm). 1 H NMR spectra were recorded in CDCl 3 (unless otherwise stated) on agilent UNITY INOVA 400 NB, JEOL JNM-ECS 400, Bruker AM-300, or JEOL JNM-LA 500 spectrometers. Chemical shifts are expressed in ppm relative to tetramethylsilane (0 ppm) or CHCl 3 (7.28 ppm). The coupling constants are given in Hz. 13 C NMR spectra were recorded on the same spectrometers at 100 or 125 MHz, using the central resonance of CDCl 3 (d C 77.0 ppm) as the internal reference unless otherwise stated. High-resolution mass spectra (HRMS) were obtained on a JMS-HX-110A (FAB), and Shimadzu LCMS-IT-TOF (ESI). Low-resolution mass spectra (LRMS) were obtained on a Shimadzu LCMS-2010EV (ESI). Optical rotations were determined with a HORIBA SEPA-300 polarimeter. Preparative HPLC was performed using a COSMOSIL 5C18-ARII column (20 \u00c2 250 mm) with a linear gradient of CH 3 CN in 0.1% aqueous TFA at a flow rate of 5.0 mL/min on a HITACHI LaChrom system (OD, 254 nm). For analytical HPLC, unless otherwise noted, a COS-MOSIL 5C18-ARII column (4.6 \u00c2 150 mm) was employed with a linear gradient of CH 3 CN in 0.1% aqueous TFA at a flow rate of 0.9 mL/min on a HITACHI LaChrom system (OD, 254 nm). The purity of the test compounds was determined by analytical HPLC. All test compounds showed P95% purity.",

[ To a solution of above di-protected alcohol (9.81 g, 17.4 mmol) in CH 3 OH/EtOAc/saturated aqueous NaHCO 3 (5:5:1, 110 mL), Pd-C (3.8 g) was added, and the mixture was stirred under a hydrogen gas atmosphere at room temperature for 6 h. The mixture was filtered through Celite and a silica gel layer, and the filtrate was dried over Na 2 SO 4 , filtered, and concentrated. The residue was purified by silica gel column chromatography (hexane/AcOEt = 6:1) to give 32 ( Tris-HCl buffer pH 7.5 containing 7 mM DTT) was incubated with the R188I SARS 3CL pro28 (56 nM) at 37\u00b0C for 60 min in the presence of various inhibitor concentrations at 37\u00b0C for 60 min. The cleavage reaction was monitored by analytical HPLC [Cosmosil 5C18 column (4.6 \u00c2 150 mm), a linear gradient of CH 3 CN (10-20%) in an aq0.1% TFA over 30 min], and the cleavage rates were calculated from the reduction in the substrate peak area. Each IC 50 value was obtained from the sigmoidal dose-response curve (see Fig. S1 for a typical sigmoidal curve). Each experiment was repeated 3 times and the results were averaged.",
