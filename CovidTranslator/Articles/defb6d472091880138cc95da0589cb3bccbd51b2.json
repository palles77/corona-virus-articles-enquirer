In this study the intracellular site of targeting of RV envelope E2 and E1 glycoproteins has been investigated in three different cell types (CHO, BHK-21 and Vero cells) transfected with a cDNA encoding the two glycoproteins. By indirect immunofluorescence, E2 and E1 were localized to the Golgi region of all three cell types, and their distribution was disrupted by treatment with BFA or nocodazole. Immunogold labeling demonstrated that E2 and E1 were localized to Golgi cisternae and indicated that the glycoproteins were distributed across the Golgi stack. Analysis of immunoprecipitates obtained from stably transfected CHO cells revealed that E2 and E1 become endo H resistant and undergo sialylation without being transported to the cell surface. Transport of RV glycoproteins to the Golgi complex was relatively slow (tta = 60-90 min). Coprecipitation experiments indicated that E2 and E1 form a heterodimer in the RER. E1 was found to fold much more slowly than E2, suggesting that the delay in transport of the heterodimer to the Golgi may be due to the slow maturation of E1 in the ER. These results indicate that RV glycoproteins behave as integral membrane proteins of the Golgi complex and thus provide a useful model to study targeting and turnover of type I membrane proteins in this organdie.",

While most viruses mature at the plasma membrane, a limited number of viruses acquire their envelopes by budding into intracellular compartments. Viral assembly may take place on the inner nuclear membrane (herpesvirus), ER membranes (coronavirus, flavivirus, and rotavirus), intermediate compartment (coronavirus), and Golgi complex (coronavirus, bunyavirus, and pox virus) (43) . The site of budding of a particular virus is likely determined by the targeting of one or more viral glycoproteins to the budding site. For this reason, viral glycoproteins have been useful tools for the study of protein targeting.",

            "text": "Rubella virus (RV) t is a Togavirus which has been reported to bud from intracellular membranes in some cell types (4, 51) . RV contains two envelope glycoproteins, E2 and El, both of which are type I membrane proteins, and a capsid protein which associates with the positive-strand genomic RNA in the virion interior (40) . The subgenomic RNA which encodes these proteins (41) has been cloned and sequenced (10, 13, 14) . Expression of the cDNAs encoding E2 and E1 together or E1 alone in transfected COS cells resuited in their accumulation in a juxtanuclear location suggestive of the Golgi (18) . We have recently demonstrated that E1 expressed in the absence of E2 accumulates in a post-ER, pre-Golgi compartment composed of a network of tubular smooth membranes (20) . In this paper, we have studied the fate of E2 and E1 and have found that when expressed together they are targeted to the Golgi cisternae in several cell types. Results obtained with agents that perturb the organization of the Golgi, e.g., nocodazole and brefeldin A (BFA), indicate that E2 and E1 behave as integral membrane proteins of the Golgi. The results suggest that E2 and E1 are transported as a complex and retained in the Golgi apparatus. Thus, one or both of these membrane proteins must contain a Golgi retention signal. dards, and goat anti-rabbit IgG-gold conjugate (5 nm) were purchased from Amersham Corp. (Arlington Heights, IL).

In stably transfected BHK-21 cells, both E2 and E1 colocalized with the resident Golgi glycoprotein cx-mannosidase II (man II) by indirect immunofluorescence (Fig. I, A-D) . Similar results were obtained in transiently transfected cells (not shown). Next we examined transiently transfected Vero cells and found, surprisingly, that E2 and E1 glycoproteins also appear to be retained in the Golgi complex ( Fig. 1 E) . It should be noted, however, that we used a cDNA from a different strain of RV than that used in the previous study (4) . Our results suggest that RV E2 and E1 are targeted to the Golgi of both BI-IK-21 and Vero cells.

The large shift in size of processed E2 seen by SDS-PAGE is at least in part due to the presence of O-linked oligosaecharides (32) . The fact that Golgi processing of N-linked glycans on E2 and E1 proceeded at similar rates suggests that these proteins may be transported to the Golgi as a complex. Endo D sensitive forms of E2 and E1 were not detected at any time point (not shown) suggesting that transport is not delayed in the cis Golgi.",

Neuraminidase digestion affected only the endo H-resistant forms (>60 min chase) of RV glycoproteins indicating that some but not all of their electrophoretic heterogeneity was due to sialic acid. The neuraminidase-sensitivity of E2 was more difficult to discern (Fig. 6 ) due to the heterogeneous nature of neuraminidase-digested E2. It has been recently reported that sialylation of O-linked oligosaccharides may occur in the medial Golgi (30), whereas sialylation of N-linked glycans occurs in the TGN. The finding that El, which contains only N-linked glycans, was partially sensitive to neuraminidase suggests that a significant proportion of these glycoproteins reach trans Golgi eisternae.",

To confirm by an alternative approach that the majority of these proteins do not reach the plasma membrane, we utilized a commercially available reagent (sulfo-NHS-biotin) that has been used to selectively biotinylate primary amines of cell surface proteins (27) . The biotinylated proteins subsequently can be isolated using streptavidin-agarose and thus, easily distinguished from the intracellular pool. When radiolabeled CHOE2E1 cells were treated with sulfo-NHS-biotin to biotinylate cell surface proteins, <10% of either glycoprotein was detected at the cell surface after 180-min chase even though they had clearly entered the Golgi as evidenced by their increased molecular weight (Fig. 7) . CHOE1 cells which contain large amounts of E1 arrested in a pre-Golgi compartment (20) were used as a negative control. E1 was not detected at the surface of CHOE1 cells using the biotinylation protocol (Fig. 7) . As a positive control, when CHOE2E1 cells were infected with VSV ts045, G protein was transported to the cell surface at 32\u00b0C where it could be biotinylated and subsequently isolated using streptavidinagarose (data not shown).

Biotinylated cell surface proteins were recovered from one half using streptavidin agarose, and the remaining half constituted the intracellular sample. Samples were then subjected to SDS-PAGE and fluorography. The protein marked by the asterisk is believed to be a degradation product of El. Very little (<10%) of the E2 or E1 reaches the cell surface in cells expressing both proteins. As a negative control, E1 is not detected at the cell surface in cells expressing E1 alone.

            "text": "The data presented here and in previously published work (5, 6, 18) are consistent with the assumption that E2 and E1 form a heterodimer in the ER that is transported as such to the Golgi complex. Furthermore, the fact that the tla for acquisition ofendo H resistance is 1-1.5 h indicates that transport to the medial/trans Golgi is slow. The simplest explanation for this delay in exiting the ER is that considerable time is required for folding and acquisition of correct tertiary and quaternary structures by RV glycoproteins in the ER. The folding of glycoproteins and formation of intramolecular disulfide bonds in the ER can be monitored by SDS-PAGE of the proteins under nonreducing conditions. Proteins that have not yet completed the formation of their intrachain disulfide bonds typically migrate with a slower electrophoretic mobility, presumably because they are in an extended conformation (8, 35) . To compare the folding rates of E2 and El, CHOE2E1 cells were pulse labeled for 2.5 min, chased for various times with excess unlabeled cysteine, and treated with NEM before lysis (8, 35) . Immunoprecipitates were subjected to SDS-PAGE under non-reducing (Fig. 8 A) and reducing (Fig. 8 B) conditions. Immediately after the pulse, one prominent El species and two faint bands were evident when samples were separated under nonreducing conditions. However, very little E2 was recognized by the polyclonal anti-RV serum at this time point (Fig. 8 A) . After a 2 min chase, a faint homogeneous E2 band was detected, whereas E1 still migrated as at least two distinct species in the absence of reducing agent. In contrast, under reducing conditions E1 did not display electrophoretic heterogeneity (Fig. 8 B) . With increasing chase time, the mobility of nonreduced E2 did not change, whereas the mobility of El increased (Fig. 8 A) . The two slower migrating forms of E1 present at early time points likely represent forms of the protein that have not attained their full complement ofintrachain disulfide bonds. After 60-min chase, most of the E1 was present as the faster migrating compact form, Using a human anti-RV serum that recognizes only mature forms of E1 and E2, we also found that maximal expression of epitopes on E2 occurred between 5 and 15 min whereas E1 required up to 60 min (not shown). These results suggest that formation of intramolecular disulfide bonds and folding of E1 (which has 24 cysteine residues), occurs much more slowly than E2 which has only 13 cysteine residues (10) .",

Prewarmed chase medium (2.5 ml) containing 100X excess unlabeled cysteine was added after the pulse, and the cells were incubated for the indicated time periods (in minutes). Cells were washed in ice cold PBS containing 20 mM NEM before lysis and radioimmunoprecipitation with rabbit anti-RV serum. Immunopreeipitates were separated under nonreducing (A) and reducing (B) conditions by SDS-PAGE. Disulfide formation in E2 appears to be completed by 5 min whereas folding of E1 requires up to 60 min. CHOE2E1 cells were solubilized under mild conditions (1% NP-40 in isotonic Tris-saline) to preserve protein-protein interactions between E2 and El. A mAb to E2 was used to prepare immunoprecipitates from CHOE2E1 cells at various chase times after a short (5 rain) pulse. Immediately after the pulse, a faint E2 band was seen in addition to a protein of ,'~95 kD which likely represents the uncleaved E2E1 precur-sor polyprotein (Fig. 9 ). E1 coprecipitated with E2 as early as 5 min postpulse, and the amount of E1 increased up to 30-60 min (Fig. 9, right) . In contrast, the amount of E2 precipitated reached a maximum between 5 and 15 rain (Fig.  9) . Half of the cell lysates were also immunoprecipitated with a polyclonal anti-RV serum to demonstrate that E1 was present in the samples at all the time points (Fig. 9, left) . The Figure 9 .

E1 is coprecipitated by mouse monoclonal anti-E2 (c~E2) beginning at 5 rain postpulse (right) indicating that E2 and El form a heterodimer in the ER. Results obtained with polyclonal anti-RV serum (polyclonal c~RV) indicate that the amount of El does not increase during the chase period (after 5 mill), whereas the amount of El that coprecipitates with E2 increases up to 30-60 rain. The large protein marked by an asterisk likely represents the 95 kD E2-EI polyprotein precursor before cleavage by signal peptidase. The intensity of the E2 (39 kD) and El (57 kD) bands decreases after 60 rain due to processing by Golgi enzymes and conversion to the larger endo H-resistant species.",

This conclusion is based on the findings that: (a) E2 and E1 colocalized with the Golgi marker man 1/by immunofluorescence in a number of cell types; (b) their Golgi localization was sensitive to agents that disrupt the Golgi such as nocodazole and BFA; (c) they were localized to the stacked Golgi cisternae by immunogold labeling; and (d) they became largely resistant to endo H and were at least partially sialylated but were not detected (<10%) on the plasma membrane, indicating that for the most part they were retained in the Golgi, We found that the time required for E2 and E1 to mature, leave the RER and become endo H resistant was relatively long (tu2 = 1-1.5 h). This presumably was due to the time required for folding of these proteins and maturation of the heterodimeric complex. Biosynthetic labeling experiments indicated that E1 glycoprotein folded much more slowly than E2. Coincidentally, processing of RV glycoproteins by Golgi enzymes (detected after 30-rain chase) was not observed until heterodimer formation (as detected by coprecipitation of E1 with anti-E2 monoclonal) reached a maximum (30-60 min). These results suggest that the maturation of E1 is the limiting factor in transport of the RV spike complex to the Golgi.",

The fact that the majority of the E2 and E1 glycoprotein became resistant to endo H and partially sialylated suggests that these glycoproteins were transported to the medial and trans regions of the Golgi complex where the enzymes responsible for trimming (man II) and addition of sialic acid (sialyltransferases) to N-linked oligosaccharides are assumed to reside. Unlike glycoproteins which traverse the Golgi completely, only a fraction of E2 and E1 appear to be modified by the addition of sialic acid. The fact that after BFA washout, increased levels of E2 and E1 were observed on the cell surface of nonpermeabilized cells could be explained if a fraction of the E2 and E1 complex reaches the \"I'GN which has been reported to fuse with the endosomal network after BFA treatment (28, 52) . Thus, the structures observed during BFA washout that did not contain man II may represent trans Golgi/endosomal elements which recycle to the cell surface. Moreover, in favorable sections, immunogold labeling revealed a polarized distribution or gradient of E2 and E1 across the Golgi cisternae in CHOE2E1 cells. Although it is difficult to determine the cis-trans polarity of the Golgi in CHO cells by morphology alone, the fact that the majority of the E2 and E1 glycoproteins become endo H resistant and at least some of the N-linked glycans on E1 are sialylated support the conclusion that these proteins have a predominantly medial/trans Golgi localization.",

            "text": "Generally, only properly assembled oligomeric complexes are able to be efficiently transported from the ER (21, 47) whereas unassembled subunits are frequently retained and ultimately degraded (7, 24) . In the case ofRV glycoproteins, expression of E1 in the absence of E2 results in transport from the RER to a tubular pre-Golgi compartment which is physically connected to the RER (20) . When E2 was expressed alone in CHO cells, the majority of the protein was retained in the ER and to a lesser extent in the Golgi. Only trace amounts of E2 were detected on the cell surface by indirect immunofluorescence. These observations suggest that E2 and E1 must be expressed together to exit the ER and to be efficiently transported to the Golgi. Indeed, coprecipitation experiments indicated that E2 and E1 assemble into a heterodimeric complex in the ER. Because E2 and E1 associate shortly after synthesis (within 5 min) it is possible that the glycoproteins attain their tertiary structures by using each other as a scaffold. The rate limiting step in heterodimer maturation is likely the folding rate of E1 which is much slower than that of E2. The situation appears to be similar in the case of the Uukuniemi virus G1 and G2 spike glycoproteins which also form a heterodimer in the ER and are targeted to the Golgi (42).",

Bunyavirus glycoproteins, like RV glycoproteins, are type I membrane proteins, whereas the integral Golgi membrane proteins that have been cloned and sequenced are type II membrane proteins (34) . The only exception to date is TGN38 which is found in the TGN (33) . When the avian and mouse coronavirus E1 glycoproteins are expressed using vaccinia virus recombinants, they have different intraGolgi sites of residence, i.e., they are localized to the cis Golgi (36) and TGN (30) , respectively. In the case of the avian E1 glycoprotein, retention signals responsible for targeting to the Golgi have been localized to its first membrane spanning domain (37) , whereas in the mouse hepatitis virus E1 glycoprotein, the cytoplasmic tail appears to be important but not sufficient for Golgi retention (3). Therefore, it is possible that the mechanism of retention of the two coronavirus E1 glycoproteins may be different. Golgi retention signals for type II Golgi membrane proteins are invariably located in the signal/ anchor domains and flanking sequences (34).",

E2 and E1 were immunoprecipitated from cell lysates with human anti-RV serum (precipitates both E2 and El) and digested with (+) or without (-) endo H. Samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE and fluorography. 14C-labeled protein standards (kD) were included for reference. Immediately postpulse E2 and E1 have apparent molecular weights of 39 and 57 kD, respectively (arrows), and are endo H sensitive. By 30 min chase endo H resistant forms, 45 and 60 kD, are detected, and by 180 min >90% of the E2 and E1 become endo H resistant.
