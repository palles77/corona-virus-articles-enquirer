X-ray Diffraction (XRD) patterns of the CQDs powders were recorded in the range of 10-90\u00b0 on a BrukerAXS D8-advance X-ray diffractometer using Cu K\u03b1 radiation (\uf06c = 1.54 \u00c5) at 40 kV and 40 mA. Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) images were recorded on a JEOL JEM-2800 electron microscope operated at an accelerating voltage of 200 kV. The average hydrodynamic diameter, the polydispersity index (PDI), and the zeta-potential were recorded on a Zetasizer\u00ae Nano ZS (Malvern Instruments S.A., Worcestershire, UK). All the batches were diluted to 100 \u00b5g mL -1 in water and analyzed in triplicate at 37 \u00b0C. Emission Fluorescence Spectra were recorded between 340-800 nm using a Cary Eclipse spectrometer (Agilent, France). Solutions were excited at 350 nm and at different wavelengths (excitation and emission slit: 10 nm, scan rate: 600 nm/min). Fluorescence measurements were performed with diluted phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) aqueous solution of nanomaterials at 5 \u00b5g mL -1 . The quantum yields (\u03a6) of the CQDs were calculated by comparing their fluorescence intensities (excitation at 350 nm) and absorbance values at 350 nm with those of quinine sulfate using the following equation: \u03a6=\u03a6REF(I/IREF)(AREF/A)(\u03b7\u00b2/\u03b7\u00b2REF) where \u03a6 is the quantum yield, A is the optical density, I is the measured integrated emission fluorescence intensity and \u03b7 is the refractive index. Quinine sulfate (quantum yield of 0.54 at 350 nm) was chosen as standard and dissolved in 0.1 M H2SO4 (refractive index: 1.33) and the C-dots were dissolved in water (refractive index: 1.33). Absorbance values of the C-dots solutions were kept under 0.05 at the excitation wavelength in order to minimize re(A) XRD diffractograms of CQDs 1-4; (B) UV-Vis absorption spectra of 5 \u03bcg mL -1 suspensions of CQDs 1-4; (C) Fluorescence spectra of CQDs 1-4 upon excitation at 350 nm; (D) Wavelength-dependent fluorescence emission properties of the different CQDs.
