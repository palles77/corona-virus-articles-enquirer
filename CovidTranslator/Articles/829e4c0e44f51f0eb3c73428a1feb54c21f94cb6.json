Familiarity with common clinical conditions such as chronic obstructive lung disease (COPD) and asthma is presumed. In this chapter we present a comprehensive review of less common pulmonary conditions, organized in an anatomic manner, and discuss, in order, the pulmonary vasculature, conditions that obstruct the airways, the pulmonary interstitium, and conditions extrinsic to the lungs that affect pulmonary function, such as severe arthritic disorders. We then move to a discussion of drug-induced lung injury and conclude by discussing rare infectious pulmonary diseases, including severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS).",

            "text": "Many of the conditions discussed in this chapter are severe, and some are difficult to diagnose. Patients with pulmonary disease may present with varied symptoms, including productive or nonproductive cough, fever, shortness of breath, chest pain, and decreased exercise tolerance. In most circumstances, patients who have these conditions will already be under the care of an internist or pulmonary specialist. In many cases, the evaluation necessary to arrive at an accurate diagnosis will be comprehensive and includes a detailed history and physical examination, a chest radiograph, and pulmonary function tests (PFTs), including spirometry, diffusing capacity, and lung volume determination, and perhaps even arterial blood gas (ABG) analysis. For some conditions bronchoscopy and biopsy will have been performed, and others require echocardiography or cardiac catheterization for diagnostic certainty. For urgent or emergent surgery, the gravity of the clinical situation often precludes additional diagnostic assessment. For elective surgery, preoperative evaluation should include a review of these diagnostic studies and a determination as to whether the clinical condition of the patient has changed in a substantial way. If a diagnosis has already been established, there is no evidence to suggest that repetition of a test such as spirometry and lung volume determination, which is the gold standard for the presence or absence of pulmonary disease but a poor predictor of who will go on to develop a pulmonary complication after surgery, is indicated before proceeding to surgery. 1 If a diagnosis has not been established in a patient who has symptoms consistent with one of the diseases discussed in this chapter, pulmonary consultation should be obtained preoperatively, because the patient's pulmonary disorder may well be a more pressing concern than an elective surgical procedure.",

            "text": "Surgical intervention in the management of pulmonary AV fistulas becomes necessary when cardiac symptoms are more pronounced, significant respiratory symptoms are present, room air desaturation develops, or complications such as emboli with central nervous system (CNS) manifestations have occurred. Surgical preoperative evaluation requires chest computed tomography (CT) and pulmonary arteriography to localize the lesion. Pulmonary lobectomy, segmentectomy, or wedge resection via thoracotomy or video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) are the most commonly performed surgical procedures. Embolization procedures are gaining wider acceptance and can be utilized preoperatively in the event of hemorrhage or as standalone therapy. 9 Anesthetic evaluation focuses on the degree of shunt and hypoxemia. Analysis of an arterial blood gas sample will provide much of this information. Review of the pulmonary angiogram will reveal the size of the lesion and whether multiple fistulas are present. A significant fistula in the nonoperative lung may compromise arterial oxygenation if one-lung ventilation is required for surgical exposure. Efforts to minimize flow through a pulmonary AV fistula will revolve around avoiding increased pulmonary vascular resistance and elevated levels of positive endexpiratory pressure (PEEP). Intraoperative management frequently requires onelung ventilation to optimize surgical exposure. A doublelumen endotracheal tube (ETT) provides the added benefit of isolating the nonoperative lung and airways from any bleeding, which may occur during a potentially bloody resection. The risk of significant bleeding is decreased if the lesion has been embolized before resection. Large-bore intravenous access is recommended in the event significant hemorrhage occurs. An arterial catheter is also indicated to monitor oxygenation and guide resuscitative efforts. An important anesthetic goal is to minimize flow through the pulmonary AV fistula. AV fistulas do not have capillary beds and have lower resistance to blood flow than normal pulmonary vasculature. It is important to avoid a general increase in pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR), because this will increase flow through the AV fistula. Similarly, minimizing the use of PEEP will minimize increases in PVR and help minimize blood flow through the pulmonary AV fistula. Because of the risk of paradoxical emboli passing through the fistula, extra caution must be taken to avoid injection of any air or particulate debris into the venous system, because such debris may bypass the pulmonary capillary bed and gain access into systemic arteries where end-organ embolization can occur. Preoperative evaluation should include assessment of neurologic function to rule out prior embolic stroke, and postoperative evaluation should include a neurologic check as well, to look for perioperative CNS embolization.",

Respiratory compromise increases the risk of hypoxia under general anesthesia or if the patient hypoventilates secondary to sedating medications used for premedication or for monitored anesthesia care.

            "text": "Primary pulmonary hypertension (PPH) is an idiopathic disease and is a diagnosis of exclusion (Table 4 -7). The prevalence of PPH is thought to be approximately 1:1 million, with women being twice as likely as men to present with the disease. Some cases appear to be genetically linked. 14 Overall, PPH is more severe and aggressive than secondary pulmonary hypertension. Vascular remodeling, an alteration in pulmonary vascular tone, and a loss of cross-sectional pulmonary arterial area are responsible for the increase in pulmonary vascular resistance seen in this disease. Dyspnea is the most common presenting symptom, and syncope is a particularly poor prognostic sign. Right-to-left shunting may occur in the 30% of patients with a patent foramen ovale (PFO). Death typically results from hypoxia, a further increase in pulmonary artery pressures (PAP), and eventually right ventricular failure. 15 Historically, treatment for PPH relied on oxygen and calcium channel blockers in an effort to decrease pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) ( Table 4-8 ). In addition, warfarin (Coumadin) is used to reduce the risk of thromboembolism resulting from the enhanced platelet activity seen in PPH. Pulmonary embolism or primary pulmonary vascular thrombosis is poorly tolerated in this patient population. Diuretics and digoxin are also employed when right Peripheral edema and other signs of right-sided heart failure Cyanosis ventricular failure ensues. More recently, promising results have been achieved with prostaglandins (PGI 2 , PGE 1 ; alprostadil) and nitric oxide to induce pulmonary vasodilation with minimal systemic effects. These may be used separately or in combination. 14 Currently, prostacyclins must be delivered by continuous intravenous infusion owing to their short half-life. Nitric oxide is delivered by inhalation and requires a tank and delivery system. Phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitors such as sildenafil and dipyridamole potentiate the pulmonary vasodilation resulting from nitric oxide and can be used separately or in a combined fashion. 14 Unfortunately, cost and unwieldy delivery systems have limited the use of these therapies to the short term or the most severe of cases. New approaches to delivering PGI 2 are under development, including the inhaled, subcutaneous, and oral routes. Another new agent is bosentan, an oral endothelin receptor antagonist that is thought to inhibit smooth muscle vasoconstriction and proliferation and has been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to treat PPH. 14 Preoperative studies focus on the severity of the patient's pulmonary hypertension, the degree of hypoxia, and the effects of these on the heart (Table 4-9). ABG analysis will elucidate the level of hypoxia and acidemia, both of which exacerbate pulmonary hypertension. A chest radiograph may reveal enlarged main pulmonary arteries or an enlarged heart due to right ventricular hypertrophy or right atrial dilation. An electrocardiogram may also reveal changes consistent with pulmonary hypertension (e.g., right atrial enlargement), as well as the presence of abnormal cardiac rhythm (e.g., atrial fibrillation). Sinus rhythm is essential to adequate right ventricular filling. Preoperative echocardiography is helpful in determining the extent of right ventricular hypertrophy and function, right atrial enlargement, pulmonic or tricuspid valve dysfunction, and patency of the foramen ovale. Pulmonary systolic A more reliable method of measuring pulmonary pressures, gauging response to therapies, and detecting a patent foramen orale is right-sided heart catheterization. This procedure should only be considered if other studies have not provided an adequate assessment of disease severity and is not typically needed for preanesthetic evaluation. If the patient is being treated with digoxin, serum potassium and digoxin levels should be measured. It is essential to keep the high morbidity and mortality of this disease in mind when preparing to deliver an anesthetic to a PPH patient and not assume the risk of perioperative complications is low even if the patient is undergoing a \"minor\" procedure. Regional anesthetic techniques do not preclude the need for invasive monitoring and vasoactive therapy. Each patient's needs should be considered individually. All medications being used to treat the patient's PPH and resulting right-sided heart failure should be continued in the perioperative period. Warfarin will need to be discontinued and replaced with a heparin infusion preoperatively. The risk of a thromboembolic event and the possibility of a right-to-left shunt justify a preoperative hospital admission to administer heparin. Sedation must be carefully titrated; oversedation may lead to hypoxia, whereas not adequately addressing a patient's anxiety may also cause a rise in PVR.",

The etiology of pneumothorax is unknown but presumably involves rupture of subpleural blebs through the visceral pleura. This becomes more likely in advanced disease. Over a lifetime, the incidence of pneumothorax may be as high as 20% in adult CF patients. Application of positive-pressure ventilation can increase the risk of spontaneous pneumothorax. In the event of pneumothorax, surgical pleurodesis is the treatment of choice for CF patients who have a low anesthetic risk; higher-risk patients frequently receive talc pleurodesis as a safer, yet less effective, alternative. 18 The chronic hypoxia seen in this population causes an increase in pulmonary vascular resistance and pulmonary hypertension. Ventilation-perfusion inequality results in hypoxemia. Loss of pulmonary arteriole cross-sectional area causes increased pulmonary vascular resistance and pulmonary hypertension, which is exacerbated by chronic hypoxemia. The severity of pulmonary hypertension correlates with the severity of CF. Chronic pulmonary vasoconstriction (from hypoxia) results in a muscularization of the pulmonary arterial vascular tree, which results in cor pulmonale, although the initial enlargement of the right ventricle is considered a beneficial adaptation to the increased resistance to pulmonary blood flow. The only therapy effective in treating pulmonary hypertension and improving right ventricular performance in this population is oxygen. 19 The primary gastrointestinal manifestation of CF is malabsorption and steatorrhea due to pancreatic dysfunction from obstruction of pancreatic ducts with viscous exocrine secretions. Malnutrition and deficiencies of fat-soluble vitamins such as vitamin K can increase the patient's risk of bleeding if this issue is not addressed. Glucose intolerance due to pancreatic dysfunction (impaired endocrine function) is also common and may require insulin therapy.

Thus, chest radiography is essential in these patients. 18 Coagulation studies such as prothrombin time and partial thromboplastin time can provide information regarding coagulopathy resulting from vitamin K deficiency or general malnutrition. Sedating premedications should be given only if absolutely necessary, owing to the risk of exacerbating the preexisting respiratory compromise, and then under close observation with administration of supplemental oxygen to minimize the risk of desaturation.

Although the long-term efficacy of corticosteroid therapy for IPH is unclear, it is still the best option currently available. Long-term, if not lifelong, therapy is usually required, and complications arising from corticosteroid therapy are a concern, which leads physicians to minimize doses. This increases the risk of recurrence. Treatments with plasmapheresis, azathioprine, and cyclophosphamide have been attempted with some success, but these therapies are generally reserved for patients refractory to corticosteroid therapy. Definitive therapy is offered by double-lung transplantation, although there is a case report of recurrence of IPH 40 months after transplantation. 22 Evaluation of ongoing alveolar hemorrhage and quantification of the extent of any fibrotic changes is essential to preoperative assessment. The presence of dyspnea or hemoptysis provides a starting point. Gas exchange is impaired by ongoing alveolar hemorrhage, and there is an increased need for transfusion in the perioperative period owing to the acute and chronic loss of red blood cells. It is prudent to postpone elective surgery until active alveolar hemorrhage resolves. Evaluating recent chest radiographs for bilateral alveolar infiltrates or new or changing infiltrates will help identify ongoing alveolar hemorrhage. These infiltrates usually resolve 1 to 2 weeks after the bleeding has stopped. Honeycombing may be observed if pulmonary fibrosis has developed.

There appear to be three distinct forms of PAP. Congenital PAP, which presents in infancy, is caused by mutations in the genes coding for surfactant proteins. There is a defect in surfactant-associated protein B (SP-B), which results in accumulation of surfactant-like material in alveoli. 28 The secondary form involves decreased alveolar macrophage activity, either functional impairment or decreased number, which may be related to immunosuppression, myeloid disorders, and hematologic malignancies, infection, or inhalation of noxious fumes. There is also an idiopathic categorization, which does not fit into either of the above categories and accounts for 90% of the cases. 29 Idiopathic PAP is thought to be due to reduced clearance of surfactant. The proteinaceous material found in the lungs of patients with PAP is surfactant. Patients typically present with gradual onset of cough and worsening dyspnea with exertion. Chest pain, fever, and hemoptysis may also be present. Patients may also Chest radiographs typically have bilateral perihilar infiltrates extending into the periphery in a \"butterfly\" or \"bat wing\" distribution suggestive of pulmonary edema. 30 The appearance of the chest radiograph may be out of proportion to the severity of the symptoms the patient is experiencing. High-resolution CT findings tend to more closely correlate with the clinical picture. PFTs frequently reveal a mild restrictive pattern with a severe reduction in diffusing capacity. ABG analysis demonstrates hypoxemia and an increased alveolar-arterial gradient due to interpulmonary shunting. 29 Therapy for congenital PAP is supportive, with lung transplantation being the only definitive therapy currently available. Secondary PAP will typically resolve with treatment of the underlying disorder. Whole-lung lavage, also known as bronchopulmonary lavage (BPL), has been used in the treatment of acquired PAP for 40 years and is still the current standard of care. More recently there have been reports of lobar lavage through fiberoptic bronchoscopes in the treatment of PAP. 31 This latter approach is very time consuming and uncomfortable for the patient and may be most useful in patients who cannot tolerate whole-lung lavage or the required general anesthetic.",

A rapid decrease in oxygen saturation on induction is common, making excellent preoxygenation and expedient placement of the double-lumen ETT critical. An intra-arterial catheter is useful in monitoring the patient's oxygenation and hemodynamic response to the procedure. Confirmation of correct positioning of the ETT by fiberoptic visualization is appropriate. Testing for leaks that would allow contamination of the ventilated lung by spillage of lavage fluid is essential. Then the nonventilated lung is lavaged repeatedly with saline while the ipsilateral chest wall is mechanically percussed. The procedure is repeated until the drained saline is nearly clear, indicating removal of the majority of the lipoproteinaceous material. The fluid used for the lavage should be warmed to decrease the risk of hypothermia; additionally, the volume of the drainage as well as the presence of bubbles should be closely monitored to ensure isolation of the contralateral lung. Oxygenation may improve during the instillation of fluid as alveolar pressure increases. This results in decreased perfusion to the lavaged lung (which is not being ventilated) and thus improves overall ventilation-perfusion matching. Hypoxia is most likely to occur during the drainage phases of the procedure, when an increase in intrapulmonary shunting occurs due to the dramatic drop in alveolar pressure. Significant hemodynamic changes can also occur during the infusion of the saline into the lung. Hypotension, as well as an increase in central venous pressure and pulmonary capillary wedge pressure, is not unusual. Use of transesophageal echocardiography has suggested that these changes were due to impaired venous return to the left side of the heart. 32 Presumably, saline infusion compresses alveolar capillaries, increasing pulmonary vascular resistance and resulting in an increase in central venous pressure, while also causing decreased left-sided heart output owing to decreased blood flow to the left ventricle. In some cases the contralateral lung can be lavaged during the same anesthetic, although it is not uncommon to wait several days between treatments. BPL may result in improvement lasting 12 to 18 months before it is again required.",

Radiographic abnormalities progress from bilateral hilar adenopathy to diffuse pulmonary infiltration, and, in severe cases, pulmonary fibrosis. PFTs frequently demonstrate restrictive disease with decreased volumes and diffusion capacity. In some cases an obstructive pattern may also be present owing to airway narrowing. In more advanced cases ABG analysis reveals hypoxemia and an increased alveolar-arterial gradient. Cardiac symptoms occur in a significant number of sarcoid patients. Some are the result of myocardial granulomas, and others are secondary to respiratory system disease. Possible findings include conduction abnormalities (complete heart block, bundle branch block, or first-degree AV block), ventricular arrhythmias, congestive heart failure, pericarditis, supraventricular tachycardia, ventricular aneurysms, and sudden death. 33 Neurologic findings in sarcoid are uncommon, although all of the nervous system is at risk. Possible manifestations of neurologic involvement include seizures, progressive dementia, diabetes insipidus, hydrocephalus, and acute mononeuropathy. Facial nerve neuropathy is the most common of the neurologic lesions and usually has a benign course. 34 There is also the potential for airway involvement. This occurs in approximately 5% of patients with sarcoidosis. 35 Symptoms may include dyspnea, dysphagia, throat pain, hoarseness, a weak voice, or stridor. Most lesions are supraglottic and involve the epiglottis, aryepiglottic folds, and arytenoids. 36 These lesions may result in airway compromise and, rarely, the need for tracheostomy. Vocal cord paralysis has also been reported and is due to recurrent laryngeal neuropathy caused by sarcoid mediastinal lymphadenopathy. 37 Encountering a pregnant patient with a history of sarcoid is not unusual, because sarcoid occurs with an increased frequency in women of childbearing age. However, in general, pregnancy tends to improve sarcoidrelated symptoms. This is presumably owing to increased cortisol levels during pregnancy. 38 Corticosteroids are often required to treat sarcoid. Systemic corticosteroids appear to improve or shorten the length of most symptoms related to sarcoidosis. Owing to the relapsing and remitting nature of the disease it is difficult to verify the efficacy of this treatment. As is often the case, early diagnosis and treatment appears to improve the likelihood of successful treatment. Radiation therapy and immunosuppressants such as cyclophosphamide and azathioprine may also be used as treatment. Serial chest radiographs, PFTs, and serum angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) levels can be used to follow the progress of a patient. Serum ACE appears to be synthesized within sarcoid granulomas. High levels are associated with more severe pulmonary infiltration, and lower levels are seen with disease inactivity. Trends within a given patient are more important than the absolute level of ACE. Cardiac rhythm abnormalities can occur as a result of sarcoid heart disease and may necessitate placement of a pacemaker or implantable cardiac defibrillator, as well as other treatment for arrhythmias, cardiomyopathy, and heart failure.",

Other preoperative testing is guided by the patient's history and may include electrocardiography and echocardiography if cardiac involvement or advanced pulmonary fibrosis is present. All ongoing cardiac therapy should be continued perioperatively. Because of the sporadic nature of neurologic symptoms, a thorough neurologic examination is advisable during preoperative evaluation to help differentiate between existing deficits and those resulting from anesthetic interventions, surgery, or positioning for surgery. Renal involvement also occurs, making review of recent electrolyte and renal function data advisable.",

The presence of significant restrictive lung disease will require altered ventilator management and consideration of the need for postoperative ventilatory support. An intra-arterial catheter will be helpful in managing oxygenation and ventilation and allows close observation and early detection of any hemodynamic instability. In caring for patients with significant pulmonary fibrosis, placement of a pulmonary artery catheter or use of transesophageal echocardiography may help guide resuscitation and hemodynamic management. Sarcoid patients with an implantable cardiac defibrillator may need to have these devices inactivated for fear of interference from electrocautery units, although modern units are less susceptible to this issue. In this event, defibrillator pads should be placed during the period of inactivation to allow for external pacing and defibrillation, if needed. Airway management will be dictated by the preoperative evaluation; awake fiberoptic intubation or elective tracheostomy may occasionally be necessary. Continuation of corticosteroid therapy with consideration of stress-dosing is encouraged.",

These conditions are the direct result of autoantibody reactions in the lung vasculature, lung parenchyma, and pleura. Histopathologic findings include alveolar wall damage, inflammatory cell infiltration, hemorrhage, and hyaline membranes. Some of these manifestations are thought to occur primarily in SLE patients with antiphospholipid antibodies. The presence of these antibodies is referred to as antiphospholipid syndrome (APS), with 50% of cases of APS being in patients with SLE although only a minority of SLE patients have APS. 40 The primary defect in APS is recurrent arterial and venous thrombosis, 41 although there is an association with pulmonary hypertension and diffuse alveolar hemorrhage. Alveolar hemorrhage and pulmonary hypertension are particularly dire manifestations and predict a higher mortality. 42 Preoperative testing should be directed toward the affected organ systems. Many SLE patients have mild disease and require little deviation from the routine perioperative evaluation and care required for a given operation. A review of serum creatinine and blood urea nitrogen levels is reasonable to rule out any occult renal involvement. Pulmonary evaluation may include chest radiography, ABG analysis, and PFTs if current symptoms and history suggest pleuropulmonary involvement. A restrictive pattern is frequently seen on PFTs, although if bronchiolitis is present there will be obstruction as well. The diffusing capacity is reduced when interstitial disease is present. Diffusing capacity is normal when corrected for diminished lung volumes if respiratory muscle dysfunction is the sole cause of underlying restrictive lung disease. 43 Patients with significant pulmonary involvement may require postoperative ventilation. Ventilator management should be tailored to their specific disease process: diaphragmatic weakness or interstitial fibrosis. During the perioperative period it must be kept in mind that patients with APS are at increased risk of thrombosis, and appropriate precautions must be taken.

It is a progressive illness with a median survival time of 3 to 4 years. This rare condition has a prevalence rate of about 5 per 100,000 and is more common in current or former smokers. A typical patient is a middleaged man. Diagnosis is based on the presence of the histologic pattern of usual interstitial pneumonia and exclusion of other causes of this histologic pattern. Extrapulmonary involvement does not occur. The presentation is insidious and typically involves dyspnea and a nonproductive cough. Physical examination frequently reveals fine crackles at the lung bases, expanding upward as the disease progresses. Clubbing, cyanosis, peripheral edema, and cor pulmonale are later findings. There must be a restrictive pattern on spirometry and radiologic changes on chest radiograph or high-resolution CT consistent with the diagnosis. 44 There is also an increased incidence of pulmonary malignancy in IPF patients. Unfortunately, it is unclear if resection of these lesions adds to life expectancy in this population. 45 There is no effective treatment currently available, although therapy with corticosteroid and cytotoxic agents is frequently attempted. There are currently many novel therapies in development intended to block fibrogenic pathways that may be of benefit (Table 4- 14) . 46 Lung transplantation is the only therapeutic option available for IPF. Although thought to be effective, there is still only a 49% survival rate 5 years post transplantation. 47 IPF patients presenting for surgery will typically be tachypneic and cyanotic and will appear to be in poor health. Preoperative evaluation should include a review of recent spirometry and other PFTs. A decrease in lung volumes with a reduction in diffusion capacity is expected. Ventilation-perfusion inequality and impaired diffusion result in hypoxemia. In patients with advanced disease, echocardiography may reveal pulmonary hypertension and cor pulmonale. There appears to be a very high incidence of GERD in IPF patients. 48 It is appropriate to consider premedicants to reduce gastric volume and acidity, as well as an anesthetic technique to minimize the risk of pulmonary aspiration of gastric contents. An aspiration event in such a patient could easily be fatal. Placement of an intra-arterial catheter is advised for all but the most vigorous of these patients undergoing minor surgery.",

It may occur in as many as 10 to 20 per 100,000 individuals. 49 Several disorders have been implicated as risk factors for developing ARDS, some through direct lung injury, others by a systemic inflammatory response (Table 4- 15) . The underlying lesion is injury to the alveolar-capillary membrane and increased alveolar-capillary permeability. Proteinaceous edema fluid accumulates in the alveoli, resulting in impaired oxygenation and poorly compliant (stiff) lungs. ARDS develops acutely over a 1-to 2-day period. If a patient is alert and spontaneously ventilating, anxiety and dyspnea will be the earliest signs. As inflammatory changes occur, tachypnea and increased work of breathing will be noted. Mechanical ventilation is required to maintain oxygenation. Chest radiographs typically reveal diffuse bilateral alveolar infiltrates very similar to the findings of pulmonary edema. There is no laboratory test to diagnose ARDS. As a clinical diagnosis, criteria for diagnosing ARDS are acute onset of respiratory distress requiring intubation and mechanical ventilation; a PaO 2 /FIO 2 ratio of less than 200, a chest radiograph with bilateral infiltrates suggestive of pulmonary edema, and no evidence of CHF or, if measured, a pulmonary artery wedge pressure less than 18 mm Hg. 50 ARDS has a high mortality rate, which is in the range of 35% to 40%. Patients who do survive generally return to a pulmonary function near their baseline. If a defect does remain it is likely to be a restrictive defect or decreased diffusion capacity, and more disabling sequelae are possible. 51 Intraoperative management of ARDS is an extension of the care the patient is receiving in the intensive care unit. Many patients will have a severe underlying injury or illness, which will also require significant attention in the perioperative period. The approach to ventilator management plays a significant role in the mortality rate from ARDS. Instituting low tidal volume ventilation on the order of 4 to 6 mL/kg (predicted body weight) and maintaining plateau pressures of less than 30 cm H 2 O were found to reduce the mortality from ARDS by almost 20%. 52 This approach may result in hypercapnia and respiratory acidosis, which can be treated with sodium bicarbonate. There are currently no data to suggest a particular level of respiratory acidosis, which is dangerous. 53 There is no clear evidence to support that pressure-cycled ventilation is superior to volume-cycled ventilation. Administration of PEEP is necessary and results in recruitment of alveoli and better ventilation-perfusion matching. There is no set level of PEEP that has been shown to be superior. 54 Other maneuvers such as sigh breaths and periodic rotation of the patient to the prone position may result in improved oxygenation but are not associated with an improvement in outcomes. Invasive monitors will frequently be in place when the patient arrives in the operating room; if not, an intra-arterial catheter should be inserted. For procedures involving major fluid shifts, placement of a pulmonary artery catheter or use of transesophageal echocardiography may be helpful in guiding resuscitation and avoiding overzealous fluid administration, which might adversely impact the patient's respiratory status. Colloids such as albumin and hetastarch offer no advantage over crystalloid solutions because impaired alveolar-capillary membranes allow both classes of fluid to reach the extravascular space.",

Improvement or complete remission may occur spontaneously or as the result of smoking cessation. A minority of patients progress to pulmonary fibrosis. Age (older than 26 years), an FEV 1 /FVC ratio less than 0.66, and a right ventricular/ total lung capacity ratio greater than 0.33 have been suggested as predictors of advanced disease and increased mortality. 56 Corticosteroids and chemotherapeutic agents are utilized in attempts to treat PHX, but the disease is frequently refractory to treatment. Lung transplantation has been performed with success, although there are reports of recurrence of PHX in the transplanted lungs of patients who had extrapulmonary involvement and resumed smoking. 57 Patients who are in remission or have only mild symptoms do not require special preoperative evaluation or intraoperative management beyond that warranted by the scheduled procedure. In cases in which more advanced disease is present, a review of results of PFTs and ABG analysis and an evaluation of pulmonary pressures by echocardiography or direct measurement are advisable. Based on these results, intraoperative management should be tailored to avoid increases in pulmonary artery pressure. Placement of a pulmonary artery catheter may be necessary to help achieve this goal. The risk of pneumothorax in this population warrants an effort to minimize peak airway pressures. If diabetes insipidus is present, treatment with desmopressin should be continued in the perioperative period. The potential for pathologic fractures due to cystic bone lesions requires special attention to positioning and padding of the patient. As in all cases where pulmonary disability exists preoperatively, the potential for postoperative ventilatory support should be factored into the anesthetic plan and discussed in advance with the patient.

            "text": "Lymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM) is a rare progressive interstitial lung disease of unknown origin that frequently leads to deteriorating lung function and death secondary to respiratory failure. The disease occurs in women of reproductive age and is exacerbated by pregnancy. It also occurs in males and females with tuberous sclerosis. The condition results from the proliferation of interstitial smooth muscle and formation of cysts, which obliterate the airways. Complaints of dyspnea are the typical presenting symptom. Individuals with LAM develop hyperinflated lungs with an increased total lung capacity. They also develop an obstructive pattern on spirometry. Spontaneous pneumothorax due to cyst rupture is common. Obstruction and eventual rupture of the thoracic duct, resulting in chylothorax, is another manifestation of the disease. Hemoptysis may occur but is uncommon. Chest radiographs are normal appearing early in the disease but resemble those of end-stage emphysema in advanced disease. Reticulonodular opacities may also be seen. An obstructive or occasionally a mixed pattern is present on spirometry, along with a significant decrease in diffusion capacity. Exercise capacity will be severely decreased owing to ventilation-perfusion inequality and increased work of breathing. 58 ABG analysis typically reveals a decrease in PO 2 and PCO 2 although pH is normal. 59 Estrogen is suspected of playing a role in the development of LAM. This notion arises from the almost exclusive occurrence of the disease in women of childbearing age, its exacerbation by pregnancy, and the presence of estrogen receptors on biopsy tissue. Effective treatment of LAM is difficult. Corticosteroids are ineffective. Modalities aimed at blocking the effects of estrogen have been somewhat more successful. These approaches include oophorectomy, progesterone, and tamoxifen. Lung transplantation is offered to patients with advanced disease, although this is frequently complicated by disease-associated problems such as pleural adhesions, postoperative chylothorax, pneumothorax, and recurrent LAM. 60 Preoperative evaluation should include a review of recent PFTs and chest radiographs, as well as ABG analysis in advanced cases. Elective surgery should be postponed until after significant chylothorax, if present, can be drained and chest tubes inserted to resolve existing pneumothoraces. Recurrent leakage of lymph results in an impaired immune response and nutritional wasting, which increase the patient's risk of perioperative complications and should be addressed before surgery by enteral or parenteral nutritional support. For patients with advanced disease, ventilator management should be similar to that used for a patient with severe emphysema, including prolonged expiratory times and avoidance of high inspiratory pressures. Postoperative ventilatory support may be required if the patient has severe underlying disease and is undergoing major or extensive surgery.",

Preoperative evaluation should include radiographs of the lower and cervical spine to assess the extent of fusion. Caution should be exercised when instrumenting the airway because of involvement of the cervical spine. Decreased range of motion and poor mouth opening can make direct laryngoscopy difficult, and excess force applied to the neck can result in cervical fracture. Atlantoaxial subluxation is also present in a subset of these patients. 64 If advanced disease is present, an alternative approach to airway management, such as LMA placement or awake fiberoptic intubation, is recommended. Neuraxial anesthesia is very challenging in AkS patients. The ossification of spinal ligaments significantly narrows or closes altogether the intervertebral space and prevents optimal positioning. Alternatives that have been reported to be successful include a lateral approach to spinal placement 65 and placement of caudal catheters. 66 Intraoperative management must include special attention to positioning owing to the inflexibility of the patient's spine. Diaphragmatic function should be optimized during spontaneous ventilation because of the presence of a restrictive thoracic cage. This can be accomplished by avoiding the Trendelenburg position and using large ETTs when possible. Interscalene blocks, which can result in short-term ipsilateral diaphragmatic paralysis, should be avoided. Higher peak pressures may occur with positive-pressure ventilation and are expected. Adequate ventilation during laparoscopic surgery may not be possible and hypercarbia may develop. If not excessive, it can be tolerated until the end of the procedure. Strictest extubation criteria should be observed in this population, because their heavy reliance on diaphragmatic function increases their risk of postoperative respiratory insufficiency and emergent reintubation carries a significant risk of morbidity and failure.",

Kyphosis is an exaggerated anterior flexion of the spine resulting in a rounded or hunchbacked appearance. These disorders are frequently seen together and are referred to as kyphoscoliosis. The vast majority of cases can be classified as idiopathic, congenital, or neuromuscular. The idiopathic form is the most common and is more likely to occur in women than men. Corrective surgery is performed for scoliosis when spine angulation, also known as the Cobb angle, exceeds 50% in the thoracic or 40% in the lumbar spine. 67 Preoperative assessment should focus on any cardiovascular, respiratory, or neurologic impairment related to the deformity. The frequent presence of restrictive lung disease is the result of a narrowed chest cavity. Although patient history will provide significant insight into the level of disability, PFTs and ABG analysis are crucial in evaluating the extent of restriction and hypoxemia. This information will guide decisions regarding postoperative ventilatory support. PFTs are likely to demonstrate a reduced vital capacity and total lung capacity, as well as a normal residual volume. Hypoxemia results from ventilation-perfusion inequality. Patients may also hypoventilate. Cor pulmonale resulting from chronic hypoxemia and pulmonary hypertension may be present in advanced cases. These concerns make electrocardiography, echocardiography, and, in some situations, an exercise stress test reasonable components of preoperative testing. A history and physical examination is sufficient to evaluate the patient's neurologic status. It is important to document any preexisting neurologic deficits so as to differentiate between baseline deficits and those resulting from surgery. This is also helpful in minimizing further injury secondary to positioning or airway management. Corrective spine surgery is the procedure that is most likely to bring these patients to the operating room. There are many variations to such procedures, including anterior, posterior, and combined approaches, as well as lumbar and/or thoracic level repairs. A combined anterior and posterior approach under a single anesthetic has a higher rate of major complications when compared with a staged procedure and is best avoided if at all possible. 68 Many elements of the anesthetic plan, such as positioning and the need for one-lung ventilation, will be dictated by the specific procedure.",

These procedures frequently involve significant blood loss, possible onelung ventilation, and the need for deliberate hypotension. The patients have underlying pulmonary restrictive disease. All of these factors make arterial line placement and ABG analysis critical to effective perioperative management. The presence of restrictive lung disease combined with prone or lateral positioning can make oxygenation and ventilation with acceptable peak airway pressures challenging. The use of an anesthesia machine or ventilator capable of pressure control ventilation may be helpful. Based on the level of preoperative disability, the need for postoperative ventilation should be discussed with the patient and family. Of note, adequate oxygenation during one-lung ventilation for anterior thoracic approaches may be difficult. Placement of a double-lumen ETT instead of a bronchial blocker offers the advantage of delivering passive oxygenation to the nonventilated lung. However, such tubes have a disadvantage, which is the need to switch to a single-lumen ETT at the end of the procedure if postoperative ventilation is required. Improvement in the patient's pulmonary function does not occur immediately after surgery, and if any improvement does occur it may take a few months to several years depending on the procedure. 69 Large-bore venous access, central or otherwise, is needed to ensure rapid replacement of intraoperative blood loss. Central venous pressure monitoring is of limited usefulness in these procedures owing to the effects of positioning on the values obtained and to the possible presence of pulmonary hypertension and cor pulmonale, which reduces the value of central venous pressure monitoring in determining the adequacy of intravascular volume. Transesophageal echocardiography is a reasonable choice to monitor intravascular volume status and cardiac contractility if the patient's position allows and if it is available.",

The appeal of utilizing bleomycin in combination chemotherapy protocols is that it does not have a myelosuppressive effect. This avoids adding to the bone marrow toxicity common to other antineoplastic agents. Unfortunately, bleomycin carries the risk of inducing pulmonary toxicity, which can result in pulmonary fibrosis and can be life threatening. The risk of a patient developing pulmonary toxicity due to bleomycin therapy appears to be related to several factors. Total dose received has been shown to relate to the extent of pulmonary toxicity in animals, but this relationship is less clear in humans and there is no consensus on a cumulative dose that acts as a threshold for increased risk, although more than 300,000 IU has been suggested. 71 Some studies have suggested intravascular administration as a risk factor when compared with intramuscular dosing. 72 Chest irradiation in conjunction with bleomycin therapy appears to increase the risk of bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis, as does advanced age, a history of smoking, and treatment with other chemotherapeutic agents that have pulmonary toxicities, such as busulfan, carmustine, semustine, and lomustine.

The one exception to this is during preoxygenation, which is relatively brief, before induction of general anesthesia. 72 In cases in which adequate oxygenation does require an FIO 2 greater than 30%, the use of PEEP is advisable, because it may facilitate oxygen action without necessitating higher levels of FIO 2 .

Diagnosis is based on clinical and epidemiologic data, because there is no laboratory test available to reliably detect infection early in the clinical course. 74 Treatment of infected patients is primarily supportive and similar to that of any other atypical pneumonia. None of the currently available antiviral drugs has been shown to be effective against SARS-CoV.",

Because the anesthesiologist will be in close proximity to the patient's upper airway, there is a high risk of exposure to the virus. Full contact precautions, including wearing disposable fluid-resistant gowns, goggles, face shields, double gloving, hand washing, and use of N95 (or equivalent) masks that have been fit tested, are advised. 75 Standard surgical face masks and gowns are completely inadequate. It is just as important to wear correct protective equipment as it is to remove and dispose of it in a way that will not contaminate the wearer or others. Some institutions have taken the added precaution of using personal protection systems (PPS) for personnel involved in high-risk procedures with SARS patients. These PPS units consist of belt-mounted powered air purifiers with HEPA filters and a lightweight headpiece. Use of this equipment requires training as well as adequate time to put it on. The noise generated by the system makes communication difficult. 75, 76 Attention must also be directed to avoiding contamination of anesthesia workstations and equipment. This includes placing highefficiency filters on the inspiratory and expiratory limbs of ventilators and anesthesia machines. Providers must be mindful of everything they touch or that comes into contact with the patient and have these materials appropriately cleaned or disposed of. Maintaining a separate clean and a separate dirty work area may be helpful in this regard. 76",

The eggs of the worm are passed in the feces of infested dogs. Humans acquire the infection by unintentionally ingesting the eggs. Larvae then migrate to the liver, with some eventually arriving in the lungs and other tissues. The parasites then mature to form hydatid cysts. The lung forms a protective granulomatous layer around the cyst, which over time becomes fibrotic. It is estimated that hydatid cysts grow 1 to 2 cm a year. 77 Due to the fecaloral transmission, this disease is more common in children than adults. Overall it is rare in North America but common in other parts of the world. These cysts are frequently asymptomatic, and pulmonary cysts are often detected on routine chest radiographs. The most likely symptoms are cough, dyspnea, or chest pain. Rupture of a cyst can occur spontaneously or on surgical manipulation. This may result in an anaphylactic reaction or spread the disease to other organs. For this reason transthoracic needle aspiration should never be attempted. Chest radiographs will reveal a cystic lesion, which may be rather large, accompanied by an area of pneumonitis or atelectasis. There is no effective medical treatment for hydatid cyst of the lung, and surgical removal is the preferred therapeutic option.",

Larger cysts may result in respiratory compromise, typically presenting as dyspnea. Spirometry may reveal decreased volumes due to the space-occupying lesion. Respiratory acidosis and hypoxemia may also be present. In advanced disease, there is the possibility that the patient may not tolerate surgery and anesthesia. In these very rare circumstances, removal of the cyst has been performed under thoracic epidural anesthesia with success. 78 For patients considered reasonable candidates for general anesthesia, one-lung ventilation may be requested to optimize surgical exposure for resection of the cyst. Isolation of the contralateral lung field has the added benefit of decreasing the risk of contamination should the cyst rupture during surgery. In cases in which there is only unilateral disease, there is little reason for the patient to have difficulty tolerating one-lung ventilation, as the unaffected side is primarily responsible for gas exchange if the cyst is clinically significant. An arterial catheter is appropriate when one-lung ventilation is planned. Close communication between surgeon and anesthesiologist during drainage and delivery of the cyst is essential to avoid spillage. In the event of contamination, anaphylaxis may occur and the anesthesiologist should be prepared for this by having large-bore intravenous access, as well as immediate availability of epinephrine, diphenhydramine, and corticosteroids.",

Clinical interactions with patients with these disorders may range from a simple excisional biopsy in a patient with asymptomatic pulmonary sarcoid, to a hip replacement in a patient with ankylosing spondylitis, to a double-lung transplant for a patient with end-stage cystic fibrosis. The spectrum of possible procedures therefore extends from the routine to the extraordinarily complicated. Successful management of patients with these disorders is often challenging in both the conceptual and technical realms. An understanding of the pathophysiology and treatment of the uncommon pulmonary disorder will allow the anesthesiologist to anticipate likely clinical problems and tailor anesthetic management to minimize the chance of intraoperative and postoperative complications.",
