This pilot was conducted evaluation comparing performance characteristics of the RT-PCR and Electrospray Ionization Mass Spectrometry (RT-PCR/ESI-MS) platform to conventional virological methods for identifying multiple clinically relevant respiratory viruses in nasopharyngeal aspirates. The RT-PCR/ESI-MS respiratory virus surveillance kit was designed to detect respiratory syncytial virus, influenza A and B, parainfluenza types 1-4, adenoviridae types A-F, coronaviridae, human bocavirus, and human metapneumovirus. Patients (N=192) attending an emergency department during the 2007-8 respiratory season consented, and \"excess\" frozen archived nasopharyngeal aspirates were analysed; 46 were positive by conventional virology and 69 by RT-PCR/ESI-MS, among which there were six samples with multiple viral pathogens detected. The sensitivity and specificity of the assay were 89.1% and 80.3%, respectively. Additional viruses that were not identified by conventional virology assays were detected (4 human bocaviruses and 7 coronaviruses). Samples in which the RT-PCR/ESI-MS results disagreed with conventional virology were sent for analysis by a third method using a commercial RT-PCR-based assay, which can identify viruses not detectable by conventional virologic procedures. Time to first result of RT-PCR/ESI-MS was 8 hours. RT-PCR/ESI-MS demonstrated capacity to detect respiratory viruses identifiable and unidentifiable by conventional methods rapidly.",

Eligible patients were identified by dedicated study coordinators by the daily review of nasopharyngeal aspirate testing order lists from the emergency department, and sought informed consent (in person, for those who were still in the hospital, or by telephone, from those who were already discharged either from the emergency department or the inpatient setting). There were at least three separate attempts in different periods of different days to attempt contact and informed consent for potentially eligible subjects, which resulted in 30% participation rate. Clinical information was obtained by chart review to derive patient demographic variables, hospitalization related to the respiratory tract infection episode, and length of stay in the hospital in days if admitted.

Accurate mass (61ppm), high-resolution (M/dM.100,000 FWHM) mass spectra were acquired for each sample using high-throughput ESI-MS protocols (Sampath et al., 2007) . For each sample, approximately 1.5uL of analyte solution was consumed during the 74second spectral acquisition. Raw mass spectra were post-calibrated with an internal mass standard and deconvolved to monoisotopic molecular masses. Unambiguous base compositions were derived from the exact mass measurements of the complementary singlestranded oligonucleotides. The detailed information of the software used to interrogate amplicon mass and viruses identification was described elsewhere . A calibrant consists of a specially designed nucleic acid sequence that similar to but distinguishable from any potential sequence were amplified in each well as the internal positive control. A negative control was implemented in each batch of processing with sterile viral transport media.",

Although some rapid antigen tests offer faster detection times for individual pathogen, clinical utility is limited, as the pathogenic agent is usually not known a priori, and these tests have suboptimal sensitivity and specificity (Ginocchio, 2007) . As demonstrated in this study that the rapid antigen tests detected only small proportions of influenza and RSV in clinical specimens, the sub-optimal sensitivity restricts the wider utilization of these rapid tests in clinical settings.

Although the optimal design to determine whether the candidate assay performs potentially better than the \"gold standard\" is to have a third confirmatory test done for every sample, the limited volume of the excess nasopharyngeal aspirate samples, precluded this type of detailed evaluation. Accordingly, readers should be cautioned to interpret results of the secondary analysis carefully, since they could be overestimating performance of the assay (Hadgu, Dendukuri, and Hilden, 2005) . Because of the same reason, specimens with bocavirus detected by RT-PCR/ESI-MS could not be confirmed. Another limitation is that RT-PCR/ESI-MS testing on excess nasopharyngeal aspirate samples was performed several months after initial clinical samples were obtained and tested by clinical virology. Although the effect of length of storage of nasopharyngeal aspirates has been shown to be minimal within 2 months (Ward et al., 2004) , another study suggests nucleic acid degradation may be associated the -70\u00b0C storage (Frisbie et al., 2004) , and the impact of longer periods of storage remains unknown. Furthermore, the majority of the study population was comprised of paediatric patients (< 18 years of age), which limits generalizability of the findings to the adult population. Future validation of the performance of the RT-PCR/ESI-MS platform on adult population is necessary. Lastly, this Ibis T5000 Respiratory Virus Surveillance II kit was not designed to detect rhinovirus, one of the most prevalent respiratory viruses. However, a modified respiratory virus surveillance kit is under development to include rhinovirus, the accuracy and reliability of this type of platform merits further studies using prospective clinical respiratory specimens.",

Detection of conventional viruses missed by the clinical virology algorithm, and unconventional viruses required additional confirmatory testing to further evaluate performance characteristics of this assay. The RT-PCR/ESI-MS method is a promising diagnostic platform for rapid identification of conventional and unconventional viruses and merits further prospective evaluation.",

Diagnostic algorithm used in clinical virology laboratory to detect respiratory viruses mainly divided into respiratory season or non-respiratory season. Respiratory season defined as October to the following January (October to November for RSV, December to January for influenza). Immunochromatographic assays were used in respiratory season as the sole screening test for RSV and influenza, which will stop the testing algorithm if results are positive. Respiratory panel cocktail DFA tests serve for adenovirus, influenza A and B, parainfluenza type 1-3 and RSV, which will stop the testing algorithm if results are positive in non-respiratory season or for those screened negative by immunochromatographic assays in respiratory season as well. RSV: Respiratory Syncytial Virus, PIV: Parainfluenza virus, HSV: Herpes simplex virus, CMV: cytomegalovirus, hMPV: human metapneumovirus, DFA: Direct fluorescent antibody test, CPE: Cytopathic effect, RBC: red blood cells Bocavirus that were not detectable in both clinical virology laboratory and secondary RT-PCR based platform were excluded (2 subjects with bocavirus only detection and 2 bocavirus detection). After excluding bocavirus and coronavirus detections that clinical virology laboratory had no protocol to detect, 188 were included in the primary performance analysis as in table 3a. Six coronavirus and 31 samples for which clinical virology laboratory and RT-PCR/ESI-MS did not agree with sufficient volume left were sent to secondary RT-PCR based assay for secondary analysis. NA: not available * One coronavirus isolation that detected by conventional virology reference test as adenovirus. ** Excludes one Coronavirus detection with insufficient volume to send to the secondary PCR method",
