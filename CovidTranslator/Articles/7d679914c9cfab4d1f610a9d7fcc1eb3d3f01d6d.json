            "text": "Human erythrocytes infected with the malarialparasite Plasmodium falciparum contain flattened membrane lamellae. It has been suggested that the lamellae may be involved in the sorting of malarial proteins to the cytoplasm and the cell membrane of the host erythrocyte. We have previously shown that the lamellae accumulate sphingolipids by virtue of their lipid composition in a manner similar to the trans-Golgi and the trans-Golgi network in mammalian cells. In this paper, we show by immunofluorescence microscopy that a monoclonal antibody to the lamellae labeled a perinuclear organetle that colocalized with WGA and the mannose-6-phosphate receptor in cultured mammalian cells. Immunoelectron microscopy experiments revealed that LWLI labels cisternae of the trans-face and the trans-Golgi network. Western blot analysis of subcellular fractions using LWLI detected a 170 kD protein which is associated with the luminal side of Golgi membranes of rat liver and is conserved in all cell lines studied. Our results indicate that (i) the 170 kD protein is a novel marker of the mammalian trans-Golgi and the trans-Golgi network and (ii) in addition to similarities in their morphological and lipid characteristics, the lamellae induced by P. falciparum in erythrocytes share proteinaceous determinants with the Golgi apparatus of mammalian cells.",

            "text": "The Golgi apparatus plays a pivotal role in the biosynthetic processing and sorting of newly synthesized proteins and lipids (reviewed by Pfeffer and Rothman, 1987; Mellman and Simons, 1992) . In animal cells, the Golgi apparatus is a polarized organelle composed of membrane cisternae which are functionally divided into several distinct, juxtaposed and biochemically heterogeneous subcompartments (cis, medial, trans, and many of the resident Golgi enzymes that catalyze steps in the synthesis of macromolecules have been identified, characterized and used as markers to distinguish the different subcompartments of the Golgi apparatus (Goldberg and Kornfeld, 1983; Roth et al., 1985; Niehrs and Huttner, 1990; Futerman et al., 1990; Jeckel et al., 1990) . The mature mammalian erythrocyte is devoid of subcellular organelles and lacks biosynthetic activities. However, when human erythrocytes are infected by the malarial parasite P. falciparurn, the transport activities in the human erythrocyte are dramatically altered. Membranous structures, including flattened membrane lamellae, membrane circles and electron-dense structures are induced by the parasite in the cytoplasm of infected erythrocytes. Electron microscopy analysis shows that these structures morphologically resemble the organelles of the mammalian secretory pathway (Aikawa et al., 1986; Atkinson et al., 1987) . Little is known of the biogenesis of these structures or the mechanisms by which proteins synthesized in the parasite are sorted and transported to the cytoplasm and the cell membrane of the infected erythrocytes. However, :since the u!trastructural appearance of the intraerythocytic iamel!a (originally referred to as Maurer's cleft) resembles a Single Golgi cisterna of mammalian stacks' (Langteth ~ti~all, 1978) , it has been proposed that lamellae may function as a transport apparatus for membrane and protein traffic between the parasite and the host cell (reviewed by Barnwell, 1990) . Additional evidence that the lammellae may play a role corresponding to that of the Golgi apparatus in mammalian cells may be foundif~h~fact that a fluorescent derivative of C6-NBD-ceramide that accumulates in the trans-Golgi apparatus of mammalian cells (Lipsy and Pagano, 1985) also accumulates in the lamellae .",

We previously raised a battery of monoclonal antibodies against malarial proteins and identified a monoclonal antibody (LWLI) which specifically binds to the flattened lamellae in P. falciparum-infected erythrocytes . The antibody recognized a 45/50 kD doublet in Western blots and immunoprecipitation of P. falciparum lysates of infected erythrocytes. Cell fractionation studies indicate that LWLI reacts exclusively with parasite-induced structures localized in the erythrocyte cytoplasm and not with the parasite itself (Das et al., 1994) . We now extend these results to show that LWLI also reacts with the Golgi apparatus in a variety of mammalian cell types. LWLI recognizes a conserved 170 kD protein which is localized on the luminal side of Golgi membranes in immunoblot experiments. We also determined by immunoelectron microscopy that the 170 kD protein is located exclusively in the trans-Golgi cisternae and the TGN.",

            "text": "Our previous work demonstrated that the monoclonal antibody LWLI recognized proteins in intraerythrocyte cisternae in P. Falciparum-infected erythrocytes. Because the intraerythrocyte lamella morphologically resembles an individual cisterna of the eucaryotic Golgi apparatus, it was of interest to determine whether LWLI would also react with this organelle in mammalian cells. Madin-Darby bovine kidney (MDBK), a human gastric cell line (MKN7), CHO, human foreskin fibroblasts (HFF) and Madin-darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells were immunolabeled with LWLI. Figure 1A is a low magnification of MKN7 cells that represents the characteristic immunolabeling pattern obtained with LWLI antibody. The immunofluorescence was concentrated in the perinuclear region where Golgi complexes are located. At higher magnifications, the fluorescence was visualized as an anastomic network of tubules in MDBK and HFF cells ( Fig. 1 B, C) , whereas in CHO and MDCK LWLI appeared to label a more compact structure ( Fig. 1 D, E) . To determine unambiguously that the organelle labeled by LWLI was the Golgi apparatus, we simultaneously labeled cells with LWLI and wheat germ agglutinin (WGA), a lectin that preferentially labels the Golgi apparatus (Virtanen et al., 1980) . Figure 2 A and B shows that the labeling pattern for LWLI and for WGA was superimposable and clearly co-localized within the same organelle, although subtle discrepancies could be observed. In addition, both the immunofluorescence patterns for LWLI and WGA were disrupted and dispersed throughout the cytoplasm in cells treated with monensin, a drug that perturbs the Golgi structure (Tartakoff, 1983 ), (Fig. 2 C, D, vs A, B respectively). Two hours after removal of monensin, both the LWLI and WGA resumed their original perinuclear fluorescence patterns (not shown). In most cell types, the 215kD mannose-6-phosphate receptors (MPRs) are localized primarily in the TGN, and in the endosomal compartment (Geuze et al., 1985; Griffiths et al., 1988) . We therefore simultaneously immunolabeled MDBK cells with LWLI and with a rabbit antibody against the MPR. The labeling pattern obtained with LWLI clearly matched the localization of the MPRs although it was not totally superimposable and additional staining for MPRs could be detected in vesicles close to the Golgi apparatus that probably correspond to endosomes (Fig. 3A, B) . However, some segments of the network labeled by LWLI were superimposable with the immunolabeling pattern for MPR. In a series of control experiments (not shown), the pattern obtained with LWLI was unequivocally distinct from that obtained with antibodies to coated vesicles (o~ adaptin or clathrin; Robinson, 1987; Brodsky, 1985) , and different from the patterns observed after incubating cells with a compound that binds the endoplasmic reticulum (3, 3'-dihexyloxacarbocyanine iodide, DioC6; Teresaki et al., 1984) , or that of one pinocytic ma~.ker (lucifer yellow-dextran) which concentrates in the endolysosomal compartment (Ferris et al., 1987; Storrie et al., 1984) . Taken together with the co-localization studies shown in Figure 2 and Figure 3 , these results indicate that LWLI recognized an antigen(s) that was present in the elements of the Golgi apparatus in mammalian cells.",

Preliminary gold immunolabeling experiments established that LWLI had only limited access to the antigen on thin cryosections. This steric hindrance resulted in very low immunolabeling density. Consequently, MDBK, MKN7, and pituitary cells were fixed and processed for immunoperoxidase cytochemistry. This technique is highly sensitive because the immunocytochemical signal is enzymatically amplified by the DAB reaction. Although the morphological preservation of the organelles was not always optimal due to the weak fixation regimen (glutaraldehyde as low concentration as 0.02% totally abolished immunoreactivity), the DAB reaction product was observed only in the Golgi apparatus with the exception of all other organelles. The reaction product was consistently localized in cisternae situated at one side of the Golgi stacks, and most often, was observed over the luminal side of short membrane segments (Fig. 4B , C, D, and 5). However, in a few instances, LWLI labeled the membranes of an entire cisterna (Fig. 5D ). In addition to the labeling of the luminal side of the membranes (Fig. 4 B, C, D) , electron opaque reaction product could be seen inside the cisternae (Figs 4, 5) . We believe that this labeling is not specific and represents an artifact caused by the diffusion of oxidized DAB reaction product from the membrane (Courtoy et al., 1983) rather than the localization of an antigen of the cisternal content. Occasionally, the reaction product was observed in the lumen of the cisternae but still seemed closely apposed to the membranes of the cisternae (Fig. 4B) .",

As shown in Figures 4 and 5 , LWLI immunolabeled the membranes of one or two cisternae situated at the trans-face of the organelle (Fig. 4C , D) and the TGN (Fig. 5) . We were unable to detect reaction product in cis-and medial cisternae of the Golgi apparatus or in the other cellular compartments.

The results presented in Figure 6A lane 1 indicate that LWLI recognized one protein band that corresponded to a 170 kD protein in molecular weight in rat liver Golgi fraction. Densitometry analysis showed that more than 85% of the amount of the 170 kD protein was enriched in the Golgi fraction. The distribution of this protein closely coincided with the peak of the galactosyMransferase activity (Fig. 7) . It should be noted that the 170 kD protein was not detected or below the level of detection in all other non-Golgi fractions, including PNS (Fig. 6A lane 2) . Surprisingly, LWLI also recognized a protein band corresponding to 38 kD MW in non-Golgi fractions. This 38 kD protein was recovered in the supernatant after 100 000 x g centrifugation of the PNS (Fig. 6A lane 3) . Therefore, the 170 kD protein appears to be the only Golgi protein recognized by LWLI in rat liver. Two lines of evidence strongly suggest that the 170 kD protein is associated with the Golgi cisternae and may be a transmembrane protein that protrudes into the lumen of the cisternae. Firstly, the 170 kD protein remained with the pellet after carbonate wash which yields Golgi membrane sheets (Fig. 6B ) (Fujiki et al., 1982) . Secondly, the 170 kD protein was resistant to degradation when the Golgi fractions were subjected to exogenous trypsin (Fig. 6C) , Since LWLI immunolabeled the Golgi apparatus of various cell lines, we examined whether the 170 kD protein was also present in CHO cells by treating Golgi fractions of these cells with proteinase K (Fig. 8) .",

            "text": "The intraerythrocyte lamellae (also known as the clefts or cisternae) contained in the cytoplasm of erythrocytes infected with P. faliciparum have been proposed to play a role similar to that of the Golgi apparatus in processing or sorting of parasitic proteins to the cytoplasm and the membrane of the host cells (Howard et al., 1987) . It has now been shown that the lamellae are part of a network of tubulo-vesicular membranes (TVM) to which the parasite export the Golgi marker, sphingomyelin synthase Elmendorf and Haldar, 1994) . Considering that organelle structure, biochemical activities as well as fundamental functions may have been conserved among evolutionary divergent organisms, we reasoned that antibodies to the lamella could cross react with components of the mammalian Golgi apparatus. We first established by immunofluorescence that the antibody to the lamellae, LWLI labels a perinuclear organelle that co-localizes with WGA and the MPRs. LWLI does neither react with any marker enzymes of the Golgi apparatus such as mannosidase I! (124kD) nor with any other proteins known to be involved in protein transport, such as clathrin (180 kD). Secondly, we determined by immunoelectron microscopy that the antigen is not homogeneously distributed within the different Golgi subcompartments but is localized in the trans-cisternae and the TGN. Thirdly, we demonstrated by Western blot analysis of enriched Golgi fractions that the antibody consistently recognized a single luminal protein of 170 kD in molecular weight. Golgi proteins of molecular weight close to 170 kD have been characterized. For example, one of them, cz-COP is a membrane protein thought to be involved in the formation and budding of coated vesicles from the Golgi apparatus (Serafini et al., 1991; Rothman and Orci, 1992) . The 170 kD protein recognized by LWLi is likely not to be :z-COP as proteinase K digestion and immunoelectron microscopy have shown that 0~-COP is localized on the external surface of vesicles isolated from Golgi fractions. A protein with a molecular weight of 170 kD is associated with the membranes enriched in MPR isolated from calf liver (Messner et al., 1989) . This protein is also probably not the 170 kD protein identified by LWLI because MPR membranes, which are not enriched in galactosyl-transferase and sialyl-transferase, are unlikely to be derived from the Golgi apparatus. Taken together, the 170 kD protein recognized by LWLI appears to be a novel resident protein of the mammalian Golgi apparatus. The immunolabeling pattern for the 170 kD protein overlaps with those of several Golgi markers. The TGN harbors carbohydrate-modifying enzymes, such as :z2,6-sialyltransferase which are, in addition, localized to the Golgi stacks (Roth et al., 1985) . The TGN also contains integral membrane proteins that can transit to distant compartments of the secretory pathway. At (Bosshart et al., 1994) but also in endosomal vesicles and the plasma membrane (Ladinsky and Howell, 1992). As we have been unable to localize the 170 kD protein to any other organelles, the 170 kD protein appears to be a trans-cisternae and TGN resident protein. The trans-Golgi and the TGN are now considered as two different entities that are morphologically and functionally distinct. Recent studies have determined that at least one group of signals involved in the retention of integral Golgi proteins in the cisand medial-Golgi are localized in the membrane spanning domains (Swift and Machamer, 1991) . Since the spanning domains of different proteins that are retained in these Golgi subcompartments have shown no obvious homology, it is believed that the retention process probably depends on physical properties. The retention of membrane proteins to the TGN is mediated by a recognition signal as a segment of 11 amino acids in the cytoplasmic tail of TGN38/41 can confer TGN localization to an otherwise plasma membrane protein (Humphrey et al., 1993) . Similarly, the retention of furin in the TGN is also mediated by a signal within its cytoplasmic domain (Bosshart et al., 1994) . The sequence or the configuration that localizes the 170 kD protein to the transcisternae and the TGN will have to await sequencing of the protein. Our data suggest, however, that the mechanisms that target proteins to the membranes of trans-Golgi may also act to sort proteins to the TGN. Clearly, our understanding of the compartmentalization and the interactions between the different elements of the Golgi complex are still evolving. Further investigations using the 170 kD protein as a marker may help clarify some aspects of the organization of the trans-Golgi apparatus and the TGN.",

There are several conceivable explanations for this apparent discrepancy. It can be also argued that the bands seen in the immunoblots of the cytosolic fractions correspond to authentic cytosolic proteins. Our inability to detect them in the immunofluorescence and electron microscopy preparations may be due to the fact that they were released and lost during the permeabilization. Alternatively, it is well documented that proteins or protein fragment can leak from membrane compartments during homogenization and sediment in other cell fractions (Leighton et al., 1968; Alexon et al., 1985) . An example of this is HMG CoA reductase, a 97 kD transmembrane glycoprotein of the endoplasmic reticulum (Liscum et al., 1983) . The COOH-terminus of the protein is hydrophilic and protrudes in the cytoplasm. The latter domain is readily released from the cytoplasmic face of the microsomes and yields a soluble fragment of about 55 kD upon purification while the spanning domains remain inserted in the membrane. Similarly, the low molecular weight bands may be fragments of the 170 kD membrane protein released from the Golgi membranes during fractionation and purification.",

Most plasmodial proteins that have been transported into the erythrocyte cytoplasm are contained in the intraerythrocytic membranes (Aikawa et al., 1986; Stanley et al., 1989) . Models for vesicular transport in malaria-infected erythrocytes have been proposed. They postulate that the transport of polypeptides from the parasite to the erythrocyte cytoplasm and plasma membrane is carried out via vesicles in budding and fusing events similar to those described in eucaryotic cells (Barnwell 1990; Gunther et al. 1991; Elmendorf and Haldar, 1993) . Some characteristic features of the mammalian secretory pathway have also been identified in P. falciparurn. For example, the transport of newly synthesized proteins can be disrupted by Brefeldin A or by reducing the temperature to 15 or 20\u00b0C (Crary and Haldar, 1992; Elmendorf et al., 1992; Elmendorf and Haldar, 1993A) ; the sequencing of proteins that are exported by Plasmodium indicates the presence of the cleavable N-terminal hydrophobic signal sequence required for recognition and the translocation of secretory protein into the endoplasmic reticulum (Ragge et al., 1990) ; and a plasmodial BiP homologue ending in SDEL has been identified (Kumar et al., 1991; Kumar and Zheng, 1992) . Furthermore, the presence of a parasite homologue of ERD2 (Elmendorf and Haldar, 1993B) as well as the activity of sphingomyelin synthase , and thiamine pyrophosphatase (Haldar, in preparation) , enzymes of the cis-and trans-Golgi respectively, have been demonstrated in infected erythrocytes. Interestingly, ERD2 is concentrated within the parasite while the sphingomyelin synthase and the thiamin pyrophosphatase are associated, at least in part, with the intraerythrocytic membranes Haldar, 1993B and . These observations indicate that some of the Golgi activities can be exported from the parasite into its host cell. While the significance of this remains unclear, our results provide evidence that plasmodium-induced lamellae share some compositional features with the mammalian Golgi apparatus and support the hypothesis that the lamellae may play a role similar to the Golgi elements in the infected erythrocytes.",
