Most viral infections evoke a strong type 1 T helper (Th1) and/or cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) responses that are required for efficient eradication of the organism, however a number of respiratory viruses, including HRVs, has been associated with comparatively weak Th1 immunity and more robust Th2-biased allergic inflammation 7, 8 . Th1-biased immunity has previously been linked to the immunopathology of COPD and emphysema, but whether respiratory viral infections exacerbate Th1 immunity or evoke an aberrant systemic or lungspecific Th2 response remains unclear.",

Acute worsening in airway obstruction in patients with advanced COPD is clearly linked to an increase in the work of breathing that is reminiscent of acute exacerbations of asthma. We and others have shown that the presence of active proteinases in environmentally relevant allergens is critical for the development of the allergic response and for inducing symptoms of airway obstruction in humans and in experimental asthma [9] [10] [11] . Indeed, neutralization of proteinases renders allergens inactive because in the absence of proteolytic activity, allergens fail to induce requisite lung Th2 responses 12 . Previously, we demonstrated that dendritic cells are activated by allergenic proteinases to induce Th2 cell differentiation 13 .",

Rhinoviral proteinase 2A further induced allergic disease in mice when administered to the upper respiratory tract. Together, our findings support a mechanism for AE-COPD in which proteinases derived from rhinovirus and potentially other viruses could create an allergic lung immune environment that leads to airway obstruction induced by Th1, and Th2 cell-derived cytokines.",

Respiratory viral infections were identified using a high throughput, multiplex-based assay that simultaneously identifies up to 17 respiratory viruses and subtypes (MultiCode-Plx, Eragen biosciences Madison, WI). A total of 45 illness episodes in a 24-month period (including a few during which the subject was not seen during acute illness) were identified. We found that, consistent with others and our prior observations 4 , a majority of exacerbations occurred in those with more advanced COPD (GOLD criteria III-IV; 29 cases) as compared to subjects with mild (COPD I-II; 10 cases) or no disease (control; 6 cases). Samples from volunteers at baseline (at the time of entry into LES COPD) failed to yield PCR evidence of viral infection. In contrast, thirteen of 45 (29 %) samples collected during the return visit for AE-COPD were PCR-positive for viruses, the majority of which (10/13; 77%) were rhinovirus (Online Repository Table E2 ). In addition, 3 out of 8 (37%) of bronchoalveolar (BAL) fluids samples from intubated subjects with AE-COPD were positive for respiratory virus infection (Online Repository Table E2 ).

Similarly, no differences in the concentration of BAL fluid IL-13 were found (Fig. 1B) . However, we detected significantly higher concentrations of IL-4, the canonical Th2 cytokine, in the BAL fluid of subjects with AE-COPD while very few subjects in the other groups produced this cytokine (Fig. 1C) .",

In order to determine the CD4 T cell immune response at the time of respiratory infection, we compared cytokines at baseline and during upper or lower respiratory infection (URI/LRI) in control (no COPD), or exacerbation in mild to moderate (COPD I-II), and in advanced disease (COPD III-IV) groups as defined by the revised GOLD criteria 22 . Cultured CD4 T cell at baseline and at the time of URI/LRI in subjects with no (Control) or during AE-COPD in mild to moderate COPD (I-II) showed no significant change in the production of IFN-\u03b3, IL-13 (Fig 2A, B) , while IL-10 production was significantly increased at the time of respiratory infection in those with mild to moderate disease (Fig 2B; p=0.04 ). Despite the lack of detectable IFN-\u03b3 in the BAL fluid of AE-COPD subjects, PBMC-derived CD4 T cells from those with advanced lung disease (COPD III-IV) secreted significantly higher amounts of IFN-\u03b3 and IL-10 when compared to stable conditions (Fig 2C; p=0 .04, and p=0.02 respectively). In agreement with the Th2 cytokine findings from BAL fluid analyses of AE-COPD subjects, PBMC-derived CD4 T cells during AE-COPD in COPD III-IV, secreted significantly higher amounts of IL-13 when compared to the same group during stable periods ( Fig. 2C; p=0 .04). We could not detect expression of IL-4 in any of our in vitro co-culture conditions, indicating the extremely low concentration of this cyokine under physiological conditions. These findings indicate that two Th2-specific cytokines, namely IL-4 and IL-13, and Th1 cyttokine (IFN-\u03b3) are associated with local and systemic immune responses in those with advanced COPD that present with upper or lower respiratory tract infection.",

Therefore, to confirm that HRV 2A and 3C proteinases could induce Th1 and or Th2 immune responses in vivo, we administered ovalbumin (OVA) PBS, OVA vehicle, or proteinases and OVA (OVA was used to ensure detection of antigen specific IgG1, a marker of Th2 immunity) to mice over a three-week period using a well-established model of active proteinase induced allergic lung disease 11 . Proteinases were delivered intranasally to mimic conditions likely to be present during active human rhinovirus upper respiratory tract infection (Fig 5A) . Compared to OVA or vehicle challenge, intranasal challenge with 2A and 3C resulted in airway hyperreactivity (AHR) as assessed by both an increase in respiratory system resistance (R RS ), in response to multiple acetylcholine (Ach) doses and a decrease in the provocative concentration of Ach that was required to elicit a 200% increase in R RS from baseline (PC 200 ) (Fig. 5B-D and data not shown) . Rhinovirus 2A proteinase further induced more robust lung inflammation as assessed by both enhanced eosinophila and neutrophilia. Whole lung single cell analysis by ELISpot technique also showed predominant spontaneous IL-4 production from mice challenged with rhinovirus 2A proteinase when compared to the other treatment groups (Fig. 5C-D) . Interestingly, despite the more robust Th2 response to 2A proteinase, B cell response, as determined by detection of OVA-specific IgG1, was present in mice treated with 2A and 3C (Fig. 5E) . Analysis of the lung lavage fluid in the same group of mice revealed increase glycoprotein secretion in mice treated with 2A proteinase (Fig. 5F ).",

Using a well-characterized cohort of former, current or never smokers with and without advanced lung disease, we have previously shown that AE-COPD occurs in smokers with severe and very severe COPD (% FEV1 <50) and that HRVs are among the most common viral isolates linked to respiratory infection [25] [26] [27] . In this work, we show that BAL fluid from subjects with COPD and respiratory failure show significantly higher concentrations of the Th1 associated chemokines CXCL10 and CXCL9. However the unexpected detection of IL-4, albeit low levels of the canonical Th2 cytokine 28 , provided initial evidence that mixed Th1 and Th2 responses elicited by viruses might be contributing to respiratory failure seen in these patients. Rhinoviral proteinase 2A, further induced Th1 and Th2 cell development from na\u00efve human CD4 T cells through effects on moDC and powerfully induced Th1 and Th2 cytokines, increase in neutrophil and esosinophil in the lung, and increase airway resistance in mice, confirming the highly immune altering nature of this proteinase. Together, these findings suggest that proteinases produced by HRVs elicit Th1 and Th2 responses that may exacerbate chronic airway obstruction that is characteristic of advanced COPD and potentially trigger respiratory failure.",

            "text": "Our finding that rhinoviral proteinases could powerfully induce Th1 and Th2 inflammation thus provides potentially critical insight into the pathogenesis of both COPD exacerbation and rhinovirus infections. It is interesting to note that while we found an increase in IL-13 production during AE-COPD specifically in subjects with severe and very severe COPD (III-IV GOLD classification), we found that IL-10, a cytokine that is generally inhibitory to both Th1 and Th2 immune responses is also up regulated in those with AE-COPD irrespective of disease severity. The increase in IL-10 during the acute inflammation/infection might represent a natural regulatory response to limit T cell activation following the initial viral infection. Nonetheless, by inducing lower respiratory tract type 2 immune responses, rhinoviral proteinases likely induce a second component of airway obstruction mediated not through loss of lung structural integrity, but through the pro-obstructive effects of IL-4 and/or IL-13, i.e., airway hyperresponsiveness and airway mucus hypersecretion 35, 36 . Moreover, HRVs likely gain from the immune deviation catalyzed by their proteinases. As in asthma, the type 2 immunity induced by viral proteinases may impair otherwise efficient type 1 immune clearance mechanisms, leading to prolonged infection and enhanced spread of the micro-organism. While this point is speculative, we propose that accelerated production of proteinase 2A may have evolved as a strategy not to enhance the processing of polyproteins, since interference leads to a decrease in viral titer 37 , however modulation of the host immune response that may be maximal at much lower levels of proteinase production, may promote disease dissemination. While this putative viral-adaptive mechanism is of little consequence to hosts with normal respiratory function, it can, unfortunately, be perilous to those with severe COPD with respiratory compromise.",

These findings are consistent with our observations suggesting that an aberrant Th2 immune response superimposed on the chronic type 1 immunity of COPD is responsible for further respiratory compromise. Specifically, systemic or topical corticosteroids may suppress production of IL-4 and IL-13, thereby alleviating airway hyperresponsiveness and mucus hyperproduction that are induced by these cytokines 35 . Although further studies are required, corticosteroids may potentially promote elimination of respiratory viruses by inhibiting the aberrant allergic immune response to secreted viral proteinases.",

This is perhaps best exemplified by rhinoviral proteinase 3C, which relative to proteinase 2A demonstrated only weak allergenic activity. Nonetheless, our findings further support the contention that proteinases are crucial virulence factors for allergic disease elicited by diverse organisms 39, 41 . Superimposition of allergic inflammation on pre-existing Th1-based disease might be expected to compound airway obstruction through multiple non-redundant mechanisms, thereby leading to clinical deterioration. In this regard, our findings of mixed Th1 and Th2 immunity in AE-COPD, may indicate the role of host antigen presenting cells in sensing the viral proteinases that can skew the immune response toward Th2. The exact mechanism involved in conditioning antigen presenting cells toward Th2 responses is currently unknown and remains an intense area of investigation.",
