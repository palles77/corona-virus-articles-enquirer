This article examines the evolution of the concept of global health and describes the driving forces that have accelerated interest in the field. It traces the development of global health programs in academic health centers in the United States. It presents a blueprint for a new schoolwide global health program at Mount Sinai School of Medicine. The mission of that program, Mount Sinai Global Health, is to enhance global health as an academic field of study within the Mount Sinai community and to improve the health of people around the world. Mount Sinai Global Health is uniting and building synergies among strong, existing global health programs within Mount Sinai; it is training the next generation of physicians and health scientists to be leaders in global health; it is making novel discoveries that translate into blueprints for improving health worldwide; and it builds on Mount Sinai's long and proud tradition of providing medical and surgical care in places where need is great and resources few.",

In the past decade, academic global health programs have grown dramatically in size and number. 1 Many of these new programs are interdepartmental and university-wide in scope. Some are generously endowed. These programs have become increasingly interdisciplinary, and today they involve schools of medicine and public health as well as schools of engineering, business, law, the social sciences, theology, and international relations. In medical schools, these programs support educational offerings in global health for medical students as well as master's-level, doctoral, and postdoctoral training. A number of North American academic global health programs have developed formal partnerships with medical schools and healthcare institutions in low-and middle-income countries (LMICs) and are engaged in joint efforts to build professional capacity in their partner countries as well as in student exchanges, provision of medical care, and collaborative research. Global health has also become a focus of intense interest at the US National Institutes of Health (NIH), and NIH Director Francis Collins has named improvement of global health one of his top priorities. 2 This sharp expansion in academically based global health reflects a convergence of 3 factors:",

Just 8 days after the quake, the institution mobilized a team of 27 health professionals to deliver care as part of a service mission coordinated by Partners in Health. 32 After this initial response, there was strong and ongoing interest in continuing service opportunities to relieve the suffering of the Haitian people. Recognizing the need to provide meaningful and effective service in a way commensurate with the specific skills and abilities of volunteer personnel, faculty from the Mount Sinai GHTC took on a leadership role in coordinating continuing relief efforts. Rather than developing a new service-delivery model in a chaotic and unfamiliar environment, Global Health faculty sought a partner with longterm experience on the ground that could accept volunteers and integrate them into a system of care. This partner was found in Project Medishare, 33 an organization based at the University of Miami that has been delivering service to Haiti since 1995. Because of its connection with the Haitian people and its proximity to the country, Project Medishare were able to open a tent hospital the day after the earthquake. They have operated this facility in one form or another ever since. Mount Sinai has already sent 2 large teams of volunteers to help staff Medishare's hospital and plans to continue recruiting volunteers for future missions. \u2022 The Recovery Act Supplement to the ITREOH program is funded by the Fogarty International Center and is intended to provide support for developing distancelearning tools and materials that enhance Mount Sinai's current programs in global health.",

They are a training program in occupational and environmental health based in the Division of International Health of the Department of Preventive Medicine, and a training program in HIV/AIDS based in the departments of Medicine and Preventive Medicine. Both have focused for many years on forging bidirectional collaborations with international research partners and are therefore guided by the principle that international collaborators are equal partners in research endeavors. Mount Sinai programs are viewed here as facilitators, rather than providing a \"top-down\" unidirectional form of aid. International Training Program in Occupational and Environmental Health: This program has 4 components, each supported by a grant from the Fogarty International Center: \u2022 The International Training in Environmental and Occupational Health (ITREOH) program has been funded continuously by the Fogarty International Center since 1995. Its goal is to build a leadership cadre in environmental and occupational medicine in Latin America and at the same time combat the brain drain of talented professionals from those countries to developed nations. The program has established formal institutional alliances in 3 countries: (1) Brazil at the Oswaldo Cruz Foundation, (2) Chile with the Department of Labor of the Ministry of Health and with the Chilean Association of Health and Safety, and (3) Mexico with the Institute of Public Health in Cuernavaca and with the Institute of Social Security in Mexico City. These collaborations have provided training to 52 fellows in environmental and occupational health, have led to the completion of 47 research projects resulting in approximately 25 research grants awarded in-country, and have supported >30 courses, symposia, and conferences and >100 peer-reviewed research publications.\u2022 The International Exchange Program for Minority Students is supported through Fogarty by the National Institute of Minority Health and Health Disparities; this program was established in 2004 at Mount Sinai. The program selects 10 bachelor's, master's, and doctoral students from among nearly 200 applicants annually to participate in 3-month research-intensive experiences at predesignated sites around the world. All students are required to complete a mentored research project at their international sites and are encouraged to continue collaborating with their research mentors after program completion. Countries in which sites for exchange students have been established include Mexico, Brazil, Chile, South Africa, Spain, and Ireland. To date, 58 students have completed the program, with 7 of them presenting at international conferences and 8 authoring peer-reviewed research articles.",

The program is developing an online course in pediatric environmental health based on a partnership with the WHO Programme on Children's Health and the Environment. Additionally, the program has established a summer certificate course in pediatric environmental health to be held at the National Institute of Public Health in Cuernavaca, Mexico. When first announced, this course attracted 51 applicants from 9 countries in Latin America, 16 of whom were selected for the training. In its second announcement, the number of applicants has doubled. Most recently, the program has established the Dr. Jenny Pronczuk Fellowship Program for Latin American physicians in honor of the former director of the WHO Programme on Children's Health and the Environment, who passed away in 2010. Pronczuk Fellows will train in research methods to address children's environmental health in their home countries. International partnerships for this program have been established in Colombia, Uruguay, Costa Rica, Mexico, and Spain.InternationalTraining Programs in HIV/AIDS: The Mount Sinai Fogarty AIDS International Training and Research Program (AITRP) is designed to build research capacity in the developing world through partnership between MSSM and partner institutions in Argentina and Cameroon that will enable these countries to combat the global epidemic of HIV/AIDS: \u2022 Through our interdisciplinary work in Argentina, Mount Sinai Global Health has had 10 highly successful years of building HIV/AIDS-related research capacity in collaboration with a wide array of Argentine partners. These efforts have focused on infrastructure development and multidisciplinary network building in clinical and research institutions. This work began with a bottom-up approach at the grassroots level. More recently, this bottom-up approach has been linked with a top-down strategy that involves major research institutions in Buenos Aires and the national Ministry of Health. This combined approach, which engages an extraordinarily broad range of Argentine partners and combines medicine and the social sciences, has provided myriad insights into the nature of the HIV/AIDS epidemic and thus helped to understand the gaps that exist across the continuum of prevention and treatment. The success of Mount Sinai Global Health in Argentina is evidenced by the large number of trainees Mount Sinai has graduated at many levels; by institutional changes resulting from trainees' work; by the rapidly increasing numbers of publications jointly authored by Argentine and Mount Sinai scientists; by the successful joint submission to NIH of a funded research proposal and the development of a second; by the joint development of an MPH program at the University of Buenos Aires (through Huesped Foundation) with HIV as the specialty track; and by the establishment of formalized linkages between MSSM and the University of Buenos Aires' Medical School and Graduate School to support a PhD research track for specialists in infectious diseases.",

To meet these rapidly evolving needs, Mount Sinai's Brookdale Department of Geriatric and Palliative Medicine is directing training programs in the care of older persons for health professionals from Europe, Asia, Africa, the Middle East, and South America. The Certificate Program in Geriatric Medicine, established in 2003 under the auspices of the Department of Geriatrics and the Office of Graduate Medical Education, has trained 20 international scholars at Mount Sinai for an average of 3 months each. This program is now involved in on-site training of physicians, nurses, and other healthcare professionals in a number of countries including Bulgaria, China, Costa Rica, India, Lebanon, Malaysia, Malta, Mexico, Singapore, South Africa, Taiwan, and Turkey. CONCLUSION Mount Sinai School of Medicine is uniquely positioned to become a world leader in global health and to be one of the premier global health programs in the United States. Mount Sinai Global Health's great strengths include its base in a school of medicine; its foundation in Mount Sinai's traditions of medical excellence and social responsibility; and its location in New York City, the nation's largest, most diverse, and most intensely global city. The formation of Mount Sinai Global Health reflects Mount Sinai's deep commitment to the health of people around the world, beginning with the people of our own community of East Harlem in New York City. It places Mount Sinai in the company of the nation's leading academic health centers. It provides an opportunity to unify, focus, and create synergies among the array of global health programs that have arisen at Mount Sinai and to build on the extraordinary enthusiasm of our students and faculty.",
