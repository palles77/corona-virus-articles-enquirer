Due to the segmented RNA genome structure, the viruses frequently and constantly alter their antigenic characteristics, and consequently change their infectivity and pathogenicity. To cope with these diverse strains or subtypes, influenza vaccines need to induce cross-reactive immune responses capable of covering a wide range of subtypes. The use of adjuvants, such as alum and MF59, improves the potency of the vaccine in terms of breadth and the magnitude of immune responses to the vaccine antigens [1, 2] . Therefore, efficacious adjuvants could be a breakthrough for the development of a 'universal' influenza vaccine.",

Among diverse mucosal routes, intranasal delivery is particularly advantageous in eliciting the strongest respiratory immune response, which plays a critical role in the protection against respiratory infections such as influenza [5] . Two intranasal influenza vaccines, FluMist and NASOVAC, are currently available and both consist of attenuated-live viruses. In addition to these licensed vaccines, many studies have revealed the possibility of protein-based intranasal vaccination against respiratory pathogens such as Streptococcus pneumoniae and respiratory syncytial virus [6, 7] . However, no approved intranasal adjuvant, capable of enhancing the immunogenicity of protein-based or killed-virus vaccine antigens, has been developed to date.",

In agreement with this in vitro result, fmOMV showed significantly lower endotoxicity than nOMV following delivery into mice. While nOMV resulted in significant weight loss and red consolidation in the lung tissue 2 or 3 days after intranasal administration, fmOMV caused milder weight loss and inflammation in the lungs ( Fig. 1D and E) .

The dose of fmOMV was fixed to 1 lg because this amount of fmOMV was sufficient to increase the levels of antibody and T cell responses without resulting in toxicity in vivo (Figs. 1B-D and 2) . Consistent with serum IgG levels ( Fig. 2A) , fmOMV significantly increased antigenspecific IgG levels in the BALF (p = 0.0105, vs. vaccine alone, Fig. 3A , left panel). In addition, secretory IgA in the BALF, which plays an important role in the protection against mucosal infection [20] , dramatically increased in the fmOMV-injected group compared with that of the vaccine-alone immunized group (Fig. 3A, right  panel) . fmOMV co-administration also significantly enhanced influenza-specific T cell responses in the lungs (p = 0.0015, Fig. 3B ). Since fmOMVs contain diverse TLR ligands such as LPS and lipoproteins, which can stimulate antigen-presenting cells (APCs) [8] , we examined the change in DCs in mLNs after treatment with fmOMV and DQ-OVA model antigen. The DC population in the mLNs dramatically increased after intranasal administration of DQ-OVA + fmOMV as compared to that of DQ-OVA treatment alone (3.21 vs. 0.72%, Fig. 3C, left panel) . This indicates active migration of DCs from the tissue to the draining LNs by fmOMV administration. In addition to the increase in number, the DCs in the mLNs exhibited high levels of DQ-OVA signal or antigen uptake and up-regulation of CD80 (Fig. 3C, left panel) . CD103 + DCs are critical for the induction of immune responses in the respiratory tract [21, 22] . The CD103 + population in CD11b lo/int CD11c hi lung cells increased more than 2-fold through fmOMV administration (53% and 22% in fmOMV-co-injected and DQ-OVA alone-injected groups, respectively, Fig. 3C, left panel) .

When a 10LD 50 dose of pH1N1 virus was intranasally administered, the fmOMV-co-immunized mice did not lose body weight and demonstrated a 90-100% survival rate for all three groups (p = 0.0001 and 0.0008, Fig. 4A ). Lung virus titer was also significantly reduced by vaccination with fmOMV (p = 0.07084 and 0.00037 on DPI 4 and 7, respectively, Fig. 4B ). To verify that fmOMV-co-immunization conferred crossprotective immunity, a requirement for influenza vaccines, we challenged the mice with PR8 and H5N2 viruses and monitored the body weight loss and survival rate. Although the body weight decreased by about 15% up to day 7 after the challenge with PR8 virus, the mice showed a gradual recovery in body weight and exhibited a 87.5% survival rate (p = 0.0055, Fig. 4C) . Similarly, when the mice were challenged with H5N2 virus, the fmOMV-coimmunized group exhibited a significant increase in the survival rate (87.5%, p = 0.0008, Fig. 4D ). Even though fmOMV significantly enhanced influenza-specific adaptive immune responses and protective immunity against viral infection, it is possible that fmOMV contributed to the protective efficacy of the vaccine by inducing innate immune responses in the respiratory tract [23] [24] [25] [26] . To verify if innate immunity contributed to the observed protective efficacy, mice were injected with different doses of fmOMV alone (ranging from 1 to 10 lg) in the absence of an influenza vaccine antigen and challenged 2 weeks later with 10 LD 50 of pH1N1 virus. From day 3 post infection, all mice began to lose body weight irrespective of the fmOMV dose, which resulted in most of them dying between day 7 and 8 post infection (Fig. 4E) . Survivors were only detected in the group given 10 lg of fmOMV for which a 50% survival rate was observed. However, the survival rate of this group was not statistically significant when compared with that of the PBS group (p = 0.2363), indicating that innate immunity is not involved in the protective efficacy observed after co-administration of fmOMV as an adjuvant. Therefore, these data, together with the previous results showing enhanced adaptive immune responses (Figs. 2  and 3) , demonstrate that vaccination with fmOMV provided broad protective efficacy against homologous and heterologous influenza viruses based on adaptive immune responses.",

For the control of these highly infectious variants or prevention of mass infection, influenza vaccines need to provide immediate protective immunity and long-term memory immune responses. To check whether the fmOMV-adjuvanted vaccine meets these requirements, we first vaccinated the mice once, and challenged them with a lethal dose of pH1N1 virus 2 weeks later. Vaccination with fmOMV significantly increased the survival rate, whereas vaccine alone failed to protect the mice (p = 0.0004, Fig. 5A ). In terms of long-term efficacy, the mice were challenged with a lethal dose of influenza virus (10LD 50 ), 20 weeks after the booster immunization. The fmOMV-co-immunized group exhibited a similar survival rate compared to that of the CT-co-immunized group (Fig. 5B) ; indicating that co-administration of fmOMV conferred prolonged protective immunity. These data show that intranasal vaccination with fmOMV induces both immediate and prolonged protective immunity, suggesting that fmOMV could be a useful vaccine adjuvant in a pandemic situation.",

Owing to its efficacy and feasibility, intranasal administration is an attractive method to deliver vaccines against respiratory viruses as exemplified by influenza vaccine. [5, 29, 30] . Therefore, it is a promising approach to develop a novel mucosal adjuvant that can potentiate the vaccine-induced immunity in the respiratory tract. In this study, we demonstrated the effect of fmOMV as an intranasal vaccine adjuvant using the influenza vaccine system. OMVs show potential as vaccine adjuvants because of their immunostimulatory activity. In terms of safety, however, native OMVs cannot be applied for vaccination because they contain fully endotoxic LPS, which induces excessive immune activation and inflammation [31] . The endotoxicity of LPS is closely related to the degree of acylation of the lipid A moiety [15, 16, 32] . Therefore, in this study, we generated an msbB-and pagP-deletion strain (Fig. 1A) lacking the acyltransferase and palmitoyltransferase required for the maximum acylation of lipid A. In addition, we introduced the lpxF gene, which encodes lipid A 4 0 -phosphatase, to further attenuate the endotoxicity of LPS by generating monophosphoryl lipid A (Fig. 1A ) [17] . As expected, fmOMV produced from the genetically engineered E. coli showed much greater attenuation than nOMV in terms of TLR4-stimulating activity in vitro and toxicity in vivo (Fig. 1C-E) . This approach agrees well with the development of the mono-phosphoryl lipid A adjuvant for wide range of human vaccines [33] .",

Many adjuvants or vaccines targeting T cell responses have been shown to induce cross-reactive T cell responses and provide protective immunity to heterologous influenza infection [36] [37] [38] [39] . In addition to T cell responses, broadspecific neutralizing antibodies are known to be cross-protective [40, 41] . Serum samples from fmOMV-co-immunized mice weakly bound to HA-stalk antigens in ELISA, suggesting that fmOMV did not efficiently induce an HA stalk-specific antibody response (data not shown). Because the IFN-c response was significantly increased in the fmOMV-infected group (Figs. 2D and 3B), it appears that the enhanced T cell response mainly contributed to the increased survival rate in the fmOMV-co-immunized group. Even though the differences in survival rates between the groups challenged with heterologous viruses (PR8 and H5N2) and the one challenged with homologous virus (pH1N1) were not statistically significant (87.5% vs. 100%, respectively; p = 0.3173), body weight in the groups receiving a heterologous virus challenge tended to decline more during the early phase of infection when compared with the group receiving a homologous virus challenge ( Fig. 4C and D, upper panels vs. Fig. 4A, left panel) . These observations suggest that a crossreactive T cell response, rather than a cross-reactive neutralizing antibody response, contributed to the clearance of virus presumably by removing infected cells during the late phase of infection.",

            "text": "The CT-injected group clearly showed a reverse correlation between IgG1 and IgG2c titers (Fig. 2B) , and this observation agrees well with the fact that CT is a potent Th2-biased adjuvant [42] [43] [44] . fmOMV simultaneously increased IgG2c and decreased IgG1 titers, indicating that fmOMV promotes Th1-dominant immune responses (Fig. 2B) . This observation can be further supported by the fact that fmOMV has strong Th1-stimulating components such as LPS, flagellin, and bacterial DNA fragments containing CpG motifs [8, 9] . Nevertheless, it was unexpected that increasing the dose of fmOMV down-regulated the antigenspecific IFN-c response (Fig. 2D) . One possible explanation for this is that over-activation of APCs, especially DCs, may negatively regulate antigen-specific T cell responses by secreting IFN-c and, in Co-administration of fmOMV provides both immediate and long-lasting protective immunity. Two weeks after the prime immunization (n = 8, A) or 20 weeks after the booster immunization (n = 8, B), the mice were challenged with pH1N1 virus and body weight changes and survival rates were monitored for 2 weeks. Data are representative of two independent experiments with similar results. \u2044\u2044\u2044 p < 0.001, \u2044\u2044 p < 0.01. turn, induce the expression of indoleamine-2,3-dioxygenase (IDO). Although IDO is well known to suppress T cell responses by depleting tryptophan [45, 46] , B cell responses appear not to be as sensitive to this mechanism as T cell responses. Rather, IDO has shown an activating role during Th2-mediated inflammatory responses [47] , which correlates well with our observation that T cell responses decreased with increasing fmOMV doses whereas antibody responses remained high ( Fig. 2A and D) . Further study is required to assess the underlying mechanism of this dosedependent inverse correlation between fmOMV dose and T cell response.",

These results show the potential of fmOMV as an intranasal vaccine adjuvant for the preparedness against an influenza pandemic.",
