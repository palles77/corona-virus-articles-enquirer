            "text": "Soon after the first isolation of an influenza C virus from a patient (Taylor, 19491 , it became obvious that this virus differs from other myxoviruses in several aspects. Pronounced differences have been observed in the interactions between the virus and cell surfaces, suggesting that influenza C virus attaches to receptors different from those recognized by other myxoviruses. While influenza A and B viruses agglutinate erythrocytes from many species, including humans, the spectrum of erythrocytes agglutinated by influenza C virus is much more restricted. Erythrocytes from rats, mice, and adult chickens are suitable for hemagglutination and hemadsorption tests; cells from other species, however, react not at all or only poorly with influenza C virus (Hirst, 1950; Minuse et al., 1954; Chakraverty, 1974; Ohuchi et al., 1978) . Differences are also observed so far as hemagglutination inhibitors are concerned. A variety of glycoproteins have been shown to prevent influenza A and B viruses from agglutinating erythrocytes. In the case of influenza C virus, rat serum was for a long time the only known hemagglutination inhibitor (Styk, 1955; O'Callaghan et al., 1980) . A difference in the receptors for influenza C virus and other myxoviruses was also suggested by studies on the receptor-destroying enzyme. The ability of influenza C virus to inactivate its own receptors was reported soon after the first isolation of this virus from a patient (Hirst, 1950) . However, the influenza C enzyme did not affect the receptors of other myxoviruses and, conversely, the receptor-destroying enzyme of either of the latter viruses was unable to inactivate the receptors for influenza C virus on erythrocytes. While the enzyme of influenza A and B virus was characterized as a neuraminidase in the 1950s (Klenk et al., 1955) , even with refined methodology no such activity was detectable with influenza C virus (Kendal, 1975; Nerome, et al., 1976) .",

            "text": "For two strains of influenza C virus, the RNA segment containing the genetic information for HEF has been cloned and sequenced (Nakada et al., 1984; Pfeifer and Compans, 1984) . Sequence data for several strains have been obtained by direct sequencing of the viral RNA (Buonagurio et al., 1985; Adachi et al., 1989) . The gene is 2070-2075 nucleotides in length and can code for a polypeptide of 654-655 amino acids (Fig. 1) . The predicted polypeptide has a molecular weight of about 72,000. At the amino terminus there is a stretch of 12 hydrophobic amino acids, which may represent the signal sequence. Cleavage of this sequence results in a polypeptide with a molecular weight of about 70,500. Two additional hydrophobic sequences are located at positions 447-463 and 627-652. The former is probably involved in the fusion activity, as discussed in Section II1,C. The hydrophobic amino acid sequence at the carboxy-terminal end is assumed to function as a membrane anchor, which is followed by a cytoplasmic tail of only three amino acids. While a homology of 30% has been observed between the hemagglutinins of influenza A and B viruses (Krystal et al., 19821 , no significant values of homology were found when these glycoproteins were compared with the HEF protein of influenza C virus. The similarity between the HEF sequence and the HA sequence is restricted to the presence of the three hydrophobic domains mentioned above. Using this criterion, sequence alignments have been reported, with six to nine cysteines being conserved in the glycoproteins of the three types of influenza virus (Nakada et al., 1984; Heifer and Compans, 1984) . Comparison of the other influenza C proteins with their influenza A and B counterparts also revealed only a very low degree of sequence similarity (Yamashita et al., 1989) . Together, the sequence data suggest that influenza A and B viruses are more closely related to one another than they are to influenza C virus.",

This finding indicates that the native glycoprotein only contains N-linked oligosaccharides, while 0linked carbohydrate structures are absent. As indicated in Fig. 1 , the amino acid sequence contains eight consensus sequences Asn-X-Ser/Thr suitable for the attachment of N-linked oligosaccharides (Nakada et al., 1984; Pfeifer and Compans, 1984) .

Oligosaccharides corresponding to the two smaller size classes (i.e., G2 and G,) have also been observed in influenza A virus, while GI is restricted to influenza C virus. G, appears to represent the mannose-rich type of oligosaccharides. The oligosaccharides of size classes GI and G, have both been shown to contain N-acetylneuraminic acid, indicating that they are of the complex type. Because of the presence of sialic acid on the viral surface, influenza C virus is able to inhibit the hemagglutinating activity of influenza A viruses (Nerome et al., 1976; Meier-Ewert et al., 1978) . The structure of the different oligosaccharides has not been determined. It has been suggested that some HEF polypeptides contain predominantly oligosaccharides of the larger size classes, while others are glycosylated with the smaller size classes (Nagele, 1983) . This would provide an explanation as to why, after sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE), HEF is detected as a doublet band (Herrler et al., 1979; Sugawara et al., 1981) .",

Such a labile thioester-type linkage has been found on many acylated glycoproteins of both viral and cellular origin. In all cases tested palmitic acid was the predominant fatty acid. The HEF glycoprotein was unique in this respect, because stearic acid was detected as the prevailing fatty acid. The reason for this difference in the acylation is unknown. Cysteine residues in the cytoplasmic tail have been identified as fatty acid attachment sites for several glycoproteins. The cytoplasmic domain of HEF is very short.

The surface projections are usually arranged in a reticular structure consisting mainly of hexagons (Flewett and Apostolov, 19671, which can be seen on both filamentous and spherical particles (Fig. 2) . A single spike protein is observed on each of the six vertices of the hexagons (Herrler et al., 1981) . Values for the length of individual spikes are in the range of 8-15 nm. The low-resolution structure of the spikes determined by electron microscopy indicated that the influenza C glycoprotein is a trimer (Hewat et al., 1984) . The trimeric structure was confirmed when the sedimentation of the glycoprotein in sucrose gradients was analyzed (Formanowski and Meier-Ewert, 1988; Formanowski et d., 1989) . Glycoprotein, which has been released from the viral surface by bromelain treatment, is still found as a trimer, indicating that the membrane anchor and the cytoplasmic tail are not essential for maintaining this structure. Calcium ions, however, appear to play an important role. On sucrose gradient centrifugation of bromelain-released HEF, trimers were detected only in the presence of calcium ions. When calcium-deficient buffers were used, the glycoprotein dissociated into monomers (Formanowski and Meier-Ewert, 1988; Formanowski et al., 1989) .",

This is suggested by the finding that the reticular arrangement is sometimes maintained after removal of the spikes from the viral membrane by either protease treatment or spontaneous release (Herrler et al., 1981) . Lateral interactions are also suggested by electron micrographs of detergent-isolated spikes. On removal of the detergent, membrane glycoproteins (e.g., the influenza A hemagglutinin) form rosettes, where the proteins are connected at a central point via their hydrophobic membrane anchor. In contrast, the influenza C glycoproteins are arranged in an elongated beetlelike structure with individual spikes standing side by side (Formanowski et al., 1989 (Formanowski et al., , 1990 . The lateral interactions are not dependent on the proteolytic cleavage of the glycoprotein. The hexagonal array is observed with virus containing predominantly HEF, as well as with virus containing HEF,,2. Glycoprotein in the uncleaved form also maintains the reticular pattern at pH 5.0. Cleaved glycoprotein, however, undergoes a major conformational change at low pH, resulting in the loss of the regular hexagonal arrangement of the spikes (Hewat et al., 1984; Formanowski et al., 1990) .",

Group A antibodies inhibited the hemagglutinating and hemolytic activities and neutralized the infectivity of influenza C virus, whereas group B antibodies lacked any of these reactivities . Analysis of antigenic variants selected for resistance against either of these monoclonal antibodies suggested the presence of four antigenic epitopes: A-1, A-2, B-1, and B-2 . Competitive binding assays indicated that sites A-1 and A-2 may be located close to one another . Both A epitopes were shown to be sensitive to denaturing conditions (e.g., treatment with SDS). Therefore, on Western blots, HEF was detected only by group B antibodies. These results indicate that sites B-1 and B-2 are sequence-dependent epitopes, whereas sites A-1 and A-2 are conformation-dependent epitopes. The conformation of both A epitopes was found to be dependent on the glycosylation of HEF. The nonglycosylated form of the protein synthesized in the presence of tunicamycin was recognized by group B antibodies, while group A antibodies reacted only poorly or not at all (Hongo et al., 198613; Sugawara et al., 1988) . The antigenic sites are presumably different from the functional epitopes of the receptor-binding and receptor-destroying activities. The ability of several monoclonal antibodies to inhibit the hemagglutinating activity of influenza C virus Vlasak et al., 1987; Herrler et al., 1988a) may be due to steric hindrance. Some of the antibodies caused partial inhibition of the receptor-destroying enzyme, when the esterase activity was determined with large substrates, but no inhibitory effect was observed when small substrates were used (Vlasak et al., 1987; Herrler et al., 1988a; Hachinohe et al., 1989) .",

Using monoclonal antibodies, it was possible, however, to demonstrate antigenic variation Adachi et al., 1989) . The low extent of variation is not due to a low capacity to produce antigenic variants. Escape mutants resistant against monoclonal antibodies have been obtained with a frequency similar to values reported for influenza A virus . Maybe the immune selection is less pronounced in the case of influenza C virus. This may also explain why no antigenic drift has been observed with this group of viruses. Among the antigenic variants arising within influenza A viruses, one usually becomes dominant and replaces the older ones. In contrast, analyses of different influenza C strains indicate that several antigenic variants cocirculate (Adachi et al., 1989) . This conclusion is supported by studies on the genetic variation in the HEF as well as the NS gene of influenza C virus (Buonagurio et al., 1985 (Buonagurio et al., ,1986 Kawamura et al., 1986; Adachi et al., 1989) .",

Identification of the enzyme activity was accomplished by analyzing its effect on hemagglutination inhibitors. Rat serum has long been known for its inhibitory activity (Styk, 1955; O'Callaghan et al., 1980) . Two components of rat serum have been shown to account for most of the hemagglutination inhibition activity: murinoglobulin and a,-macroglobulin (Herrler et al., 1985b; . The carbohydrate portion of the latter compound was found to consist primarily of N-linked biantennary oligosaccharides (Herrler et al., 1985b) . The only effect of the influenza C enzyme on these oligosaccharides was a change in the terminal sialic acid residue. While the native macroglobulin contained 40% of its sialic acid as Nacetyl-9-O-acetylneuraminic acid, this amount was reduced to 10% after treatment with the receptor-destroying enzyme.",

            "text": "Concomitant with the decrease of the 9-O-acetylated sialic acid, an increase of N-acetylneuraminic acid was observed (Herrler et al., 1985~) . The same effect was obtained with bovine submandibulary mucin, another hemagglutination inhibitor. In both cases the change in the sialic acid was paralleled by loss of the inhibitory activity, indicating that the receptor-destroying enzyme of influenza C virus is a sialate 9-O-acetylesterase (Fig. 3) . The enzyme has been shown to be a function of HEF by several approaches: expression of the cloned HEF gene in vertebrate cells (Vlasak et al., 1987) and analysis of the purified protein after isolation by detergent (Herrler et al., 1988a) or protease treatment (Formanowski and Meier-Ewert, 1988) . The influenza C esterase belongs to the class of serine hydrolases which are inhibited by diisopropyl fluorophosphate (DFP). The inhibitor abolishes the enzyme activity without affecting the hemagglutinating activity (Muchmore and Varki, 1987) . This finding suggests that the active site of the esterase and the receptor-binding site are different epitopes on the influenza C glycoprotein. There is some information on the amino acids which are crucial for the formation of the active site of the esterase. From the knowledge about other serine hydrolases (e.g., trypsin and chymotrypsin), it is expected that the enzyme mechanism involves a charge relay system, which is accomplished by a catalytic triad composed of the amino acids serine, histidine, and aspartic acid (Kraut, 1977) . Taking advantage of the fact that DFP binds covalently to the serine in the active site of serine hydrolases, amino acid 71 of HEF has been identified as active-site serine (Herrler et al., 1988b; Vlasak et al., 1989) . This amino acid is part of the sequence Phe-Gly-Asp-Ser-Arg (Fig. 1 ). While the motif Gly-Asp-Ser is found in the active site of many serine hydrolases, including trypsin and chymotrypsin, the following arginine residue has been detected so far only in the active site of the acetylesterases of influenza C virus and coronaviruses (see Section IV and Fig. 5) . From inhibition studies with arginine-specific modifying reagents, it has been suggested that this arginine residue may be important for substrate recognition, possibly interacting with the carboxyl group of Nacetyl-9-O-acetylneuraminic acid (Neu5,9Ac2) (Hayes and Varki, 1989) .",

Direct evidence for the role of Neu5,9Ac2 as a receptor determinant was provided by studies with erythrocytes which had been modified to contain only a single type of sialic acid. Influenza C virus was able to agglutinate erythrocytes which had been sialylated with Neu5,9Ac2, but not cells containing N-acetyl-or N-glycolylneuraminic acid (Rogers et al., 1986) (see Table 11 ). On the basis of these results, it was possible to explain previous observations which seemed to argue against an involvement of sialic acid in the attachment of influenza C virus to cells. The resistance of the erythrocyte receptors to periodate treatment (Ohuchi et al., 1978) is due to a greatly reduced oxidation of Neu5,9Ac2 by periodate compared to Neu5Ac (Haverkamp et al., 1975) . The difficulty in inactivating the influenza C receptors with viral and bacterial neuraminidases (Hirst, 1950; Kendal, 1975; Herrler et al., 1985a) is explained by the relative resistance of Neu5,9Ac2 to the action of these enzymes (Corfield et al., 1981) . The importance of Neu5,9Ac2 as a receptor determinant is not restricted to erythrocytes. 9-O-Acetylated sialic acid is also required for influenza C virus to initiate the infection of cultured cells (Herrler and Klenk, 1987a) . In fact, lack of this type of sialic acid is a major reason for the resistance of many cell lines to influenza C virus.",

Moreover, an increase in the yield of virus was observed with cells which usually produce only low amounts of virus (Herrler and Klenk, 1987a) . The presence of 9-O-acetylated sialic acid appears to be the major factor in determining whether a glycoconjugate can serve as a receptor for influenza C virus. Erythrocytes which have been resialylated to contain Neu5,9Ac2 were agglutinated by influenza C virus regardless of whether the sialic acid molecule was attached to galactose via an w2,3 or a-2,6 linkage (Rogers et al., 1986) (see Table 11 ). The sialyltransferase specific for the latter linkage type only acts on glycoproteins. Therefore, receptors generated by this enzyme are glycoproteins. On the other hand, it has been shown that bovine brain gangliosides can also serve as receptors for influenza C virus, although the active species among the mixture of gangliosides has not been determined (Herrler and Klenk, 1987a,b) . Thus, both glycoproteins and glycolipids can be used as receptors by influenza C virus, provided they contain Neu5,9Ac2. A larger number of glycoconjugates must be analyzed, however, in order to know whether factors other than the presence of Neu5,9Ac2 are important for the receptor function of a glycoconjugate.",

Valuable information should be obtained by the analysis of mutants with a change in the receptor-binding activity. A mutant has been described which has an expanded cell tropism due to a more efficient recognition of Neu5,9Ac2-containing receptors compared to the parent virus (Szepanski et al., 1989) . Sequence analysis of this mutant indicated that a single point mutation (Thr 284 to isoleucine; see Fig. 1 ) is responsible for the change in the receptor-binding activity (Szepanski et al., 1991) . Interestingly, the mutation site is located next to a sequence (Gly-Asn-Ser-Gly) which, in similar form (Gly-Gln-Ser-Gly), is also found in several subtypes of influenza A hemagglutinins (Fig. 1) . The homologous sequence in the H3 subtype composing amino acids 225-228 has been shown to be part of the receptor-binding pocket (Weis et al., 1988) . These data suggest that the amino acids Gly 279 to Thr 284 may be constituents of the receptorbinding site of HEF and that the mutant is altered at this site. The observation that these amino acids are located on the unfolded polypeptide at a distance far from Ser 71 at the catalytic center of the esterase, together with the DFP effects (Section III,A), supports the notion that receptor binding and receptor inactivation are exerted by different structural domains of HEF.",

Recently, the fusion between virus membranes and ar-tificial membranes has been monitored using a resonance energy assay (Formanowski et al., 1990) . In contrast to the hemagglutinating (Herrler et al., 1979; Sugawara et al., 1981) and esterase activities of HEF (Herrler et al., 1988a) , the fusion activity requires the proteolytic cleavage of HEF, into polypeptides HEF, and HEF, (Ohuchi et al., 1982; Kitame et al., 19821, described in Section 11,B . The dependence of the influenza C virus-induced fusion on the cleavage of HEF indicated that this activity is a function of the surface glycoprotein. Virus with uncleaved glycoprotein can be rendered fusiogenic by in uitro cleavage of HEF. Both trypsin and elastase have been shown to be effective in this respect, whereas other proteases (e.g., chymotrypsin and thermolysin) were unable to activate the glycoprotein (Kitame et al., 1982; Ohuchi et al., 1982; Formanowski et al., 1990 ).",

The enzyme turned out to be a sialate 9-O-acetylesterase similar to the receptor-destroying enzyme of influenza C virus.

            "text": "It is interesting to note that, on the other hand, the putative constituent sequence of the HEF receptor-binding site (Gly 279-Thr 284) does not have a homologous counterpart in the HE sequence. This observation may be related to the recent finding that HE is not very efficient in agglutinating erythrocytes (Schultze et al., 1991a) and that the major hemagglutinin of BCV is the peplomer glycoprotein S (Schultze et al., 1991b) . It has been argued that the extent of identity between HE and HEF, is high enough to rule out convergent evolution, and, therefore, it has been speculated that coronaviruses acquired the HE gene from influenza C virus by nonhomologous recombination between ancestors of both viruses . However, acetylesterases are also found in cells. If coronaviruses actually acquired the esterase gene by a recombination event, the gene might as well be derived from a cellular gene. More information about the viral and cellular esterases is required to distinguish between these possibilities.",
