These in silico methods include databases, quantitative structure-activity relationships, similarity searching, pharmacophores, homology models and other molecular modeling, machine learning, data mining, network analysis tools and data analysis tools that use a computer. Such methods have seen frequent use in the discovery and optimization of novel molecules with affinity to a target, the clarification of absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion and toxicity properties as well as physicochemical characterization. The first part of this review discussed the methods that have been used for virtual ligand and target-based screening and profiling to predict biological activity. The aim of this second part of the review is to illustrate some of the varied applications of in silico methods for pharmacology in terms of the targets addressed. We will also discuss some of the advantages and disadvantages of in silico methods with respect to in vitro and in vivo methods for pharmacology research. Our conclusion is that the in silico pharmacology paradigm is ongoing and presents a rich array of opportunities that will assist in expediating the discovery of new targets, and ultimately lead to compounds with predicted biological activity for these novel targets.",

We have also previously introduced how some of these methods can be used for virtual ligand-and target-based screening and virtual affinity profiling. In this second part of the review, we will greatly expand on the applications of these methods to many different target proteins and complex properties, and discuss the pharmacological space covered by some of these in silico efforts. In the process, we will detail the success of in silico methods at identifying new pharmacologically active molecules for many targets and highlight the resulting enrichment factors when screening active druglike databases. We will finally discuss some of the advantages and disadvantages of in silico methods with respect to in vitro and in vivo methods for pharmacology research.",

However, there have been several attempts to establish relationships between molecular structure and broad biological activity and effects that should be considered (see also section 2.3.1 in Ekins et al. (2007) ) (Kauvar et al., 1995 (Kauvar et al., , 1998b Kauvar and Laborde, 1998a) . For example, the work of Fliri et al. (2005b) presented the biological spectra for a cross-section of the proteome. Using hierarchical clustering of the spectra similarity enabled a relationship between structure and bioactivity to be constructed. This work was extended to identify agonist and antagonist profiles at various receptors, correctly classifying similar functional activity in the absence of drug target information (Fliri et al., 2005c) . Interestingly, using IC 50 data as affinity fingerprints did not identify functional activity similarities between molecules as this approach was suggested to introduce a pharmacophoric bias (Fliri et al., 2005c) . A similar probabilistic approach has also been applied by the same authors to link adverse effects for drugs (obtained from the drug labelling information) with biological spectra. For instance, clustering molecules by side effect profile showed that similar molecules had overlapping profiles, in the same way that they had similar biological spectra, linking preclinical with clinical effects (Fliri et al., 2005a) . This work offers the intriguing possibility of predicting a biospectra profile, possible functional activity and a side effect profile for a new molecule based on similarity alone. However, confidence in this approach would be greatly enhanced by further prospective testing with a large test set of drug-like molecules not used to generate the underlying signature database.",

            "text": "A second group also from Pfizer presented a global mapping of pharmacological space and in particular focused on a polypharmacology network of molecules with activity against multiple proteins (Paolini et al., 2006) . They have additionally generated Bayesian binary models (for molecules active at o10 mM or inactive) for 698 targets using over 200 000 molecules with biological data (from their in-house collection and the literature), suggesting that they would be useful for predicting primary pharmacology. Assessment of 617 approved oral drugs in two-dimensional (2D) molecular property space (molecular weight versus cLogP) showed that many of them had cLogP 45 and MW 4500. In spite of this, their associated targets were potentially druggable but had yet to realize their potential (Paolini et al., 2006) . Perhaps this work needs to be combined with that of Fliri and others for its true potential to be realized, to enable simultaneous understanding and prediction of target, proteomic, functional activity and side effects. A recent analysis using 48 molecular 2D descriptors followed by principal component (PCA) of over 12 000 anticancer molecules representing cancer medicinal chemistry space, showed that they populated a different space broader than hit-like space and orally available drug-like space. This would indicate that in order to find molecules for anticancer targets in commercially available databases, different rules are required other than those widely used for drug-likeness, as they may unfortunately filter out possible clinical candidates (Lloyd et al., 2006) .",

            "text": "Methods to predict the potential biological targets for molecules from just chemical structure have been attempted by using different approaches to those already described above. For example, one study used probabilistic neural networks with 24 atom-type descriptors to classify 799 molecules from the MDL Drug Data Reports (MDDR) database with activity against one of the seven targets (G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), kinases, enzymes, nuclear hormone receptors and zinc peptidases) with excellent training, testing and prediction statistics (Niwa, 2004) . Twenty-one targets related to depression were selected and molecules from the MDDR database were used to create support vector machine (SVM) classification models from atom-type descriptors (Lepp et al., 2006) . These models had satisfactory predictions and recall values between 45 and 90%, the molecules recovered being on average of low molecular weight (o300) and some were active against more than one model. It was suggested that general SVM filters would be useful for virtual screening owing to their speed. Others have used similarity searching of the MDDR database against small numbers of reference inhibitors for several different targets and were able to show variable enrichment factors that were greater than random (Hert et al., 2004) . The structure-based alternative to understanding small molecule-protein interactions is to flexibly dock molecules into multiple proteins. A representative of this inverse docking approach is INVDOCK, which was recently applied for identifying potential adverse reactions using a database of 147 proteins related to toxicities (DART). This method has been recently demonstrated with 11 marketed anti-HIV drugs resulting in reasonable accuracy against the DNA polymerase beta and DNA topoisomerase I (Ji et al., 2006) .",

Novel non-peptidic inhibitors of the protease ubiquitin isopeptidase, which not only de-ubiquitinates p53 but other general ubiquitinated proteins as well, were discovered recently using a simple pharmacophore-based search of the National Cancer Institute (NCI) database (Mullally et al., 2001; Mullally and Fitzpatrick, 2002) . These inhibitors had IC 50 values in the low micromolar range and caused cell death independent of the tumour suppressor p53, which is mutated in greater than 50% of all cancers (hence, p53 inhibition per se may not represent an optimal target for modulation). The ubiquitin isopeptidase inhibitors shikoccin, dibenzylideneacetone, curcumin and the more recently described punaglandins from coral indicate that a sterically accessible a,b-unsaturated ketone is essential for bioactivity (Verbitski et al., 2004) .

            "text": "More than 30 years of research on renin have not been enough to deliver a marketed drug that inhibits this enzyme. In spite of this, renin remains an attractive yet elusive target for hypertension (Fisher and Hollenberg, 2001; Stanton, 2003) . In this respect, application of structure-based design leads to the identification of new non-peptidic inhibitors of human renin. These molecules include aliskiren (Rahuel et al., 2000; Torres et al., 2003) , piperidines, including Ro-0661168 Oefner et al., 1999; Vieira et al., 1999) , and related 3,4-disubstituted piperidines (Marki et al., 2001) . Interestingly, these piperidines bind to and stabilize a different conformer of the protein termed 'open renin' (Bursavich and Rich, 2002) , whereas aliskiren binds to 'closed renin'. Since these latter structure-based design efforts, there have been remarkably very few published attempts at computer-aided design of novel renin inhibitors. A single early QSAR was derived for a series of chainmodified peptide analogues of angiotensinogen. The activity of these molecules was found to correlate with Kier's firstorder molecular connectivity index descriptor and molecular weight but not with lipophilicity as measured by logP (Khadikar et al., 2005) . Another computational method for renin drug discovery used the de novo design software GrowMol, which could apparently regenerate 3,4-disubstituted piperidines in 1% of the grown structures (Bursavich and Rich, 2002 ). An attempt to use a Catalyst pharmacophore to discover new renin inhibitors was described in the early 1990s (Van Drie, 1993) . Several novel molecules from the Pomona database (an early three-dimensional (3D) molecule database) were found that mapped to a renin pharmacophore but apparently were not tested in vitro. More recently, a LigandFit docking study with a crystal structure of the 'open renin' form was able to detect 10 known inhibitors seeded in a library of 1000 compounds within the top 8.4% when using a consensus scoring function. Four examples of high-scoring compounds that were not tested as inhibitors fulfilled the pharmacophore derived from the X-ray data, consisting of four hydrophobes, a hydrogen bond donor or positive ionizable feature as well as excluded volumes (Krovat and Langer, 2004) . Another study has used similarity searching of the MDDR database (for over 100 000 compounds) using 10 renin inhibitors and was able to produce enrichment factors that were 17-fold greater than random (Hert et al., 2004) . Genetic algorithms have also been used for class discrimination between renin inhibitors and noninhibitors in a subset of the MDDR using a small number of interpretable descriptors. Among them, amide bond count, molecular weight and hydrogen bond donor counts were found to be much higher in renin inhibitors (Ganguly et al., 2006) . The recent publications on novel renin inhibitors represent a considerable amount of new information that could be used for further QSAR model development and database searching efforts in order to derive novel starting scaffolds for optimization.",

Cathepsin D may also be elevated in breast cancer and ovarian cancer hence a means to modulate this activity could be beneficial in these diseases. There has been a brief overview of Cathepsin D in a comprehensive review of protease inhibitors (Leung et al., 2000) . A combination of a structure-based design algorithm and combinatorial chemistry has been successfully applied to finding novel molecules for Cathepsin D in the nanomolar range (Kick et al., 1997) . Structures based on pepstatin (a 3.8 pM inhibitor (Baldwin et al., 1993) ) yielded a 6-7% hit rate. These molecules were tested in vitro using hippocampal slices and were shown to block the formation of hyperphosphorylated Tau fragments (Bi et al., 2000) . There have been relatively few computational studies to date on Cathepsin D and other related aspartic proteases such as renin and b-secretase. One study has used molecular dynamics and free energy analyses (MM-PBSA) of Cathepsin D inhibitor interactions to suggest new substitutions that may improve binding (Huo et al., 2002) . A genetic algorithmbased de novo design tool, ADAPT has also been used to rediscover active Cathepsin D molecules, by placing key fragments in the correct positions (Pegg et al., 2001) . Computational models may aid in the selection of novel ligands for protease inhibition that are non-peptidic and selective. Using the structural features of eight published inhibitors for Cathepsin D (Huo et al., 2002) , a five-feature pharmacophore was derived consisting of three hydrophobes and two hydrogen bond acceptors (r \u00bc 0.98). This pharmacophore was used to search a molecule database and selected 10 molecules out of 11 441 present. In contrast, a similarity search at the 95% level using ChemFinder (CambridgeSoft, Cambridge, MA, USA) suggested 16 different molecules. All of these were selected for testing in vitro. The pharmacophore produced four hits (40% hit rate) and the similarity search generated five hits (31% hit rate), where at least one replicate showed greater than 40% inhibition (Ekins et al., 2004a) . In silico evaluation of the ADME properties for all active compounds estimated that the molecules would be well absorbed, although some were predicted to have solubility and CYP2D6 inhibition problems. Pharmacophore-and structure-based approaches have been used to optimize an acyl urea hit for human glycogen phosphorylase. A Catalyst HypoGen five-feature pharmacophore was developed and used to guide further analogue synthesis. These compounds showed a good correlation with prediction (r \u00bc 0.71). An X-ray structure for one molecule was used to confirm the predicted binding conformation. Ultimately, a comparative molecular field analysis (CoMFA) model was generated with all molecules synthesized and was found to be complementary to the X-ray structure. The outcome of this study was a molecule with good cellular activity that could inhibit blood glucose levels in vivo in rat (Klabunde et al., 2005) .",

MacroModel was used to energy minimize molecules in the ATP pocket and visual inspection suggested points for molecular modification on the ligand. Very quickly, design efforts guided ligand optimization to improve activity from 4.5 mM to 25 nM (Furet et al., 2000) . A more recent CDK1/cyclin B homology model was also used to manually dock ligands, which enabled progression from alsterpaullone with an IC 50 of 35 nM to a derivative with an IC 50 of 0.23 nM (Kunick et al., 2005) .",

(1968) using small sets of similar molecules and a few molecular descriptors. Later, Lewis and co-workers provided many QSAR and homology models for the individual human CYPs (Lewis, 2000) . As more sophisticated computational modelling tools became available, we have seen a growth in the number of available models (de Groot and Ekins, 2002b; de Graaf et al., 2005; de Groot, 2006) and the size of the data sets they encompass. Some more recent methods are also incorporating water molecules into the binding sites when docking molecules into these enzymes and these may be important as hydrogen bond mediators with the binding site amino acids (Lill et al., 2006) . Docking methods can also be useful for suggesting novel metabolites for drugs. A recent example used a homology model of CYP2D6 and docked metoclopramide as well as 19 other drugs to show a good correlation between IC 50 and docking score r 2 \u00bc 0.61 . A novel aromatic N-hydroxy metabolite was suggested as the major metabolite and confirmed in vitro. Now that several crystal structures of the mammalian CYPs are available, they have been found to compare quite favourably to the prior computational models (Rowland et al., 2006) . However, for some enzymes like CYP3A4, where there is both ligand and protein promiscuity, there may be difficulty in making reliable predictions with some computational approaches such as docking with the available crystal structures (Ekroos and Sjogren, 2006) . Hence, multiple pharmacophores or models may be necessary for this and other enzymes (Ekins et al., 1999a, b) , as it has been indicated by others more recently (Mao et al., 2006) .",

There have been numerous QSAR and pharmacophore models that have been generated with relatively small data sets for rat and human enzymes. The pharmacophores for the human UGT1A1, UGT1A4 and UGT1A9 all have in common two hydrophobes and a glucuronidation feature, while UGT1A9 has an additional hydrogen bond acceptor feature Sorich et al., 2004) . Sulfotransferases, a second class of conjugating enzymes, have been crystallized (Dajani et al., 1999; Gamage et al., 2003) and a QSAR method has also been used to predict substrate affinity to SULT1A3 (Dajani et al., 1999) . To the best of our knowledge, computational models for other isozymes have not been developed. In general, conjugating enzymes have generally been infrequently targeted for in silico models. Perhaps because of a paucity of in vitro data and limited diversity of molecules tested, they have been less widely applied in industry.",

However, it should be noted that to date we have only characterized and found agonists and antagonists for a small percentage of the receptorome.

There is currently no 3D structure information and therefore a four-point Catalyst HIPHOP pharmacophore was developed with 14 antagonists.

            "text": "Serotonin plays a role in many physiological systems, from the CNS to the intestinal wall. Along with its many receptors, it has a major developmental function regulating cardiovascular morphogenesis. The 5-HT 2 receptor family are G protein-coupled 7-transmembrane spanning receptors with 5-HT 2B expressed in cardiovascular, gut, brain tissues, as well as human carcinoid tumors (Nebigil et al., 2000) . In recent years, this receptor has been implicated in the valvular heart disease defects caused by the now banned 'fen-phen' treatment of patients. The primary metabolite, norfenfluramine, potently stimulates 5-HT 2B (Fitzgerald et al., 2000; Rothman et al., 2000) . Computational modelling of this receptor has been limited to date. A traditional QSAR study used a small number of tetrahydro-b-carboline derivatives as antagonists of the rat 5-HT 2B contractile receptor in the rat stomach fundus (Singh and Kumar, 2001) . A 3D-QSAR with GRID-GOLPE using 38 (aminoalkyl)benzo and heterocycloalkanones as antagonists of the human receptor resulted in very poor model statistics, possibly owing to the limited range of activity measured and the fact that the data corresponded to a functional response that is likely more complex (Brea et al., 2002) . Neither of these models was validated with external predictions. On the basis of bacteriorhodopsin and rhodopsin, homology models for the mouse and human 5-HT 2B receptor have been combined with site-directed mutagenesis. The bacteriorhodopsin structure provided more reliable models, which confirmed an aromatic box hypothesis for ligand interaction along transmembrane domains 3, 6, 7 with serotonin (Manivet et al., 2002) . A more recent 5-HT 2B homology model based on the rhodopsin-based model of the rat 5-HT 2A was used to determine the sites of interaction for norfenfluramine following molecular dynamics simulations. Site-directed mutagenesis showed that Val 2.53 was implicated in highaffinity binding through van der Waals interactions and the ligand methyl groups (Setola et al., 2005) . There is certainly an opportunity to develop further QSAR models for this receptor in order to rapidly screen libraries of molecules to identify undesirable potent inhibitors.",

For example, a conformational study of four ligands defined a pharmacophore of the antagonist site using SYBYL (Hibert et al., 1988) . The model resulting from such an active analogue approach was used in molecule design and predicted molecule stereospecificity. More recently, a series of over 700 homology models were iteratively created based on the crystal structure of the bovine rhodopsin that were in turn tuned by FlexX docking of known ligands. The final model was used in a virtual screening simulation that was enriched with inhibitors, compared with random selection and from this the authors suggested its utility for a real virtual screen (Nowak et al., 2006) . A homology model of the 5-HT 1A receptor has also been used with DOCK to screen a library of 10 000 compounds seeded with 34 5-HT 1A ligands. Ninety percent of these active compounds were ranked in the top 1000 compounds (Becker et al., 2006) , representing a significant enrichment. The same model was used to screen a library of 40 000 vendor compounds and select 78 for testing, of which 16 had activities below 5 mM, one possessing 1 nM affinity. Structure-based in silico optimization was then performed to improve selectivity with other GPCRs and optimize the pharmacokinetic (PK) profile. However, as this proceeded, the molecules were found to have affinity for the human ether a-go-go-related gene (hERG), and this was subsequently computationally assessed using a homology model that pointed to adjusting the hydrophobicity. The resulting clinical candidate had good target and antitarget selectivity and backup compounds were selected in the same way (Becker et al., 2006) .",

On the one hand, because of their important regulatory role in a variety of biological processes, mutations in nuclear receptors are associated with many common human diseases such as cancer, diabetes and osteoporosis and thus, they are also considered highly relevant therapeutic targets. On the other hand, nuclear receptors act also as regulators of some the CYP enzymes responsible for the metabolism of pharmaceutically relevant molecules, as well as transporters that can mediate drug efflux, and thus they are also regarded as potential therapeutic antitargets (off-targets).",

Using the available structure of the oestrogen receptor subtype a (ERa) in its antagonist conformation, a homology model of the retinoic acid receptor a (RARa) was constructed (Schapira et al., 2000) . Using this homology model, virtual screening of a compound library lead to the identification of two novel RARa antagonists in the micromolar range. The same approach was later applied to discover 14 novel and diverse micromolar antagonists of the thyroid hormone receptor (Schapira et al., 2000) . By means of a procedure designed particularly to select compounds fitting onto the LxxLL peptide-binding surface of the oestrogen receptor, novel ERa antagonists were identified (Shao et al., 2004) . Since poor displacement of 17b-estradiol was observed in the ER-ligand competition assay, these compounds may represent new classes of ERa antagonists, with the potential to provide an alternative to current anti-oestrogen therapies. The discovery of three low micromolar hits for ERb displaying over 100-fold binding selectivity with respect to ERa was also recently reported using database screening (Zhao and Brinton, 2005) . A final example reports the identification and optimization of a novel family of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors-g partial agonists based upon pyrazol-4-ylbenzenesulfonamide after employing structure-based virtual screening, with good selectivity profile against the other subtypes of the same nuclear receptor group .",

The Sammon mapping technique outperformed the Kohonen maps in classification of compounds from the external test set.

Human rhinovirus coat protein is another target for antirhinitis. A combined pharmacophore, docking approach and PCA-based clustering was used. A pharmacophore was generated from the structure and shape of a known inhibitor and tested for its ability to find known inhibitors in a database. Ultimately, after screening the Maybridge database, 10 compounds were suggested that were then docked and scored. Six compounds were tested and found to inhibit viral growth. However, the majority of them were found to be cytotoxic or had poor solubility (Steindl et al., 2005b) .

However, there are many complex properties that have been modelled in silico and these will be briefly discussed here. It should also be pointed out that while several physicochemical properties such as ClogP and water solubility have been extensively studied, the training sets for these models are in the 1000s or tens of thousands of molecules, while other complex properties have generally used much smaller training sets in the range of hundreds of molecules.",

The intrinsic clearance has therefore been used as a measure of the enzyme activity toward a compound and this may involve multiple enzymes. Some of the earliest models for this property includes a CoMFA model of the CYP-mediated metabolism of chlorinated volatile organic compounds, likely representative of CYP2E1 (Waller et al., 1996) . A more generic set of molecules with clearance data derived from human hepatocytes has been used to predict human in vivo clearance using multiple linear regression, PCA, PLS, Neural Networks with leave-oneout cross-validation (Schneider et al., 1999) . Microsomal and hepatocyte clearance data sets have also been used separately to generate Catalyst pharmacophores, which were then tested by predicting the opposing data set. This method assumes there are some pharmacophore features intrinsic to the molecules that dictate intrinsic clearance (Ekins and Obach, 2000) .",

Recently, a Kernel partial least squares (K-PLSs) QSAR approach has been used along with a genetic algorithm feature selection method for the distance-dependent atom pair descriptors from the 61 or 105 small molecule training sets with binding affinity data and the proteins they bind to. Bootstrapping, scrambling the data and external test sets were used to test the models (Deng et al., 2004) . In essence, such K-PLS QSAR models across many proteins perhaps isolate the key molecular descriptors that relate to the highest affinity interactions. It will be interesting to see whether such models can continue to be generated with the much larger binding affinity data sets that are now available.",

These models were also used to predict small sets of molecules not included in training. Ultimately, many other reactions and the evaluation of other enzymes will be necessary.

This demonstrates some of the key roles of the computational technologies that can assist pharmacology. These roles include finding new antagonists or agonists for a target using an array of methods either in the absence or presence of a structure for the target. Computational methods may also aid in understanding the underlying biology using network/pathways based on annotated data (signalling cascades), determining the connectivity of drug as a network with targets to understand selectivity, integration with other models for PK/PD (pharmacodynamic) and ultimately the emergence of systems in silico pharmacology. Obviously, we have taken more of a pharmaceutical bias in this review but we would argue these methods are equally amenable and should be considered to discover new chemical probes for the academic pharmacologist as opposed to lead molecules for optimization to become drugs. Some of the advantages of in silico pharmacology and in silico methods in general are the reduction in the number of molecules made and tested through database searching to find inhibitors or substrates, increased speed of experiments through reliable prediction of most pharmaceutical properties from molecule structure alone and ultimately reductions in animal and reagent use. We must however consider the multiple optimization of numerous predicted properties, possibly either weighting in silico pharmacology models by importance (or confidence in the model and or data), as well as data set size and diversity. Similarly, we should consider the disadvantages of in silico pharmacology methods as protein flexibility, molecule conformation and promiscuity all hinder accurate predictions. For example, even with the recent availability of crystal structures for several mammalian drug-metabolizing enzymes, there is still considerable difficulty in reliable metabolism predictions. Our focus thus far has been on the creation of many in silico pharmacology models for human properties, yet as pharmacology uses animals for much in vivo testing and subcellular preparations from several species for in vitro experiments, we need models from other species both to understand differences as well as enable better scaling between them. A widely discussed disadvantage of in silico methods is the applicability of the model, which will now be discussed further.",

For example, models may be generated with a narrow homologous series of pharmacologically relevant molecules (local model) or a structurally diverse range of molecules (global model). These two approaches have their pros and cons, respectively. The applicability domain of the local model may be much narrower than for the global model such that changing to a new chemical series will result in prediction failure. However, global models may also fail if the predicted molecule falls far enough away from representative molecules in the training set. These limitations are particularly specific to QSAR models. From many of the in silico pharmacology model examples described above, the QSAR models are generally local in nature and this will limit lead hopping to new structural series, whereas global models may be more useful for this feature. Several papers have described the applicability domain of models and methods in considerable detail (Dimitrov et al., 2005; Tetko et al., 2006) to calculate this property. Molecular similarity to training set compounds may be a reliable measure for prediction quality (Sheridan et al., 2004) as demonstrated for a hERG model . To our knowledge, there has not been a specific analysis of the applicability domain specifically for in silico pharmacology models (other than for those examples described above) to the same degree as there has been for physicochemical properties like solubility and logP. The applicability domain of pharmacophore models have not been addressed either as the focus has primarily been on statistical QSAR methods.",

This is an interesting observation as for many years computational studies were generally performed after synthesis of molecules, and essentially provided illustrative pictures and explanation of the data. Now it appears we are seeing a shift in the other direction as predictions are published for pharmacological activity without apparently requiring in vitro or in vivo experimental verification, as long as the models themselves are validated in some manner. As the models may only have a limited prediction domain so perhaps in future we will see some discussion of the predicted molecules and their distance from the training set or some other measure of how far the predictions can be extended.",

A preliminary computational model was developed to help identify these potential promiscuous inhibitors (Seidler et al., 2003) . From reviewing the literature, we suggest it would be worth researchers either implementing filters for 'promiscuous inhibitors' or performing rigorous experimental verification of their predicted bioactive molecules to rule out this possibility. . It would certainly be very useful to know the existence of difficult targets for modelling with different methods, as this apparently is a process of trial and error for each investigator currently.",

While we have not explicitly discussed PK/PD, whole organ, cell or disease simulations in this review, we recognize they too are an important component of the computer-aided drug design approach (Noble and Colatsky, 2000; Gomeni et al., 2001; Kansal, 2004) and may be more widely integrated with other in silico pharmacology methods described previously .",

Many of the examples we have presented have demonstrated significant enrichments over random selection of molecules and so far these have been the most plentiful types of metrics that are routinely used to validate in silico models. The future of in silico pharmacology may be somewhat difficult to predict. While we are seeing a closer interaction between computational and in vitro approaches to date, will we see a similar relationship with in vivo studies in the future? More broadly, will in silico pharmacology ever be able to replace entirely experimental approaches in vitro and even in vivo, as some animal rights activists want us to believe? The answer here can only be a clear and resounding 'no' (at least in the near future), for two irrefutable reasons. First, biological entities are nonlinear systems showing 'chaotic behaviour'. As such, there is no relation between the magnitude of the input and the magnitude of the output, with even the most minuscule differences between initial conditions rapidly translating into major differences in the output. And second, no computer programme, however 'complex and systemslike', will ever be able to fully model the complexity of biological systems. Indeed, and in the formulation of the mathematician Gregory Chaitin, biological systems are algorithmically incompressible, meaning that they cannot be modelled fully by an algorithm shorter than themselves.",
