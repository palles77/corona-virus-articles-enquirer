Canadian residents aged 18 and over who spoke fluent English and who had no relationship with study investigators were recruited from the general public using local newspaper advertisements and social networking websites. In addition, study collaborators (i.e., local contacts who assisted in organizing town halls) used snowball sampling to recruit participants in their local areas. A total of 17 participants attended: 5 in Vancouver, 6 in Winnipeg, and 6 in Saint John.",

At each town hall meeting, participants were randomly divided into groups of five to eight people and asked to deliberate on the ethical issues concerning an assigned scenario (see Appendix), in this case restrictive measures. Groups met in the morning and afternoon (for a total of approximately eight hours) and were both given new details on the case and asked a new set of questions as deliberations progressed. At the end of the day, the four scenario groups met to debrief and share the key issues raised and discussed in their small groups. This paper reports only the results from the restrictive measures group. Group discussions were facilitated by a member of the team while another member took notes. Town halls were audio recorded, transcribed verbatim, and verified by team members.",

Participants strongly favoured the use of rewards -the \"carrot\" -or suasion -the \"sermon\" -rather than punishments -the \"stick\" -in order to create an environment for compliance. It was thought to be more acceptable to use reciprocal arrangements and effective risk communication as reinforcement tools rather than using threat of punishment to compel compliance. This finding supports results from a recent qualitative study on individuals who had been quarantined during SARS, where effective risk communication was found to help individuals understand the precursors and consequences of diseases, which was ultimately linked to participants' reported compliance. 14 This is an interesting finding that collides with the compulsive and coercive authority that public health has traditionally used in law to justify intervention, particularly in infectious disease cases, like quarantine and border control. 15, 16 Indeed, the method of compelling individuals to comply is largely based on the \"stick\", stemming from the theoretical and largely traditional view that infectious disease control measures must be compulsory in order to be effective. 17 Our data suggest, however, that while participants recognize a need for a decision-making authority and even a necessary mechanism for enforcement, a more tractable approach is one that enables individuals to voluntarily comply. This finding supports the conceptual and empirical claims that public health must rely on persuasion rather than force when considering the use of restrictive measures. 8, 18 Our data also go so far as to suggest how this approach can be achieved. This approach requires restrictive measures to be a) proportional to the threat, b) implemented along with reciprocal arrangements provided to those affected, and c) accompanied by open and transparent communication throughout all stages so that citizens can both understand and participate in decision-making.",

This consideration challenges the common dichotomy made in public health between the individual and the greater good. This suggests that important substantive nuances exist between what is deemed to be the greater good and what is deemed to be a community good, which has largely been viewed as one and the same by public health. Indeed, attention must be paid to the role that community clusters play, particularly during a public health emergency, where measures such as the cancellation of social gatherings may benefit the greater good but may actually be detrimental to what participants understood to be community goods. These findings contrast, for instance, with the responsibilities outlined in the American Model State Emergency Health Powers Act, which makes explicit distinctions between the common good and individual rights, but does not consider the good of the community as described in our findings. 19 We recognize that the views expressed by study participants may or may not be generalizable and that study participation was unevenly distributed across Canada. However, this is consistent with standards of sampling in qualitative research, which aims to evaluate the theoretical representativeness of participants by describing the range of views, rather than quantitative or demographic representativeness.",

Our analysis contributes a better understanding of public views on the acceptability of using restrictive measures as a means to stem the tide of influenza. Prior studies utilizing public engagement demonstrate that the public can make coherent and sophisticated recommendations about regulatory issues pertaining to health and can provide invaluable \"local knowledge\" relevant to the policy-making process. [20] [21] [22] Public engagement enhances accountability, especially in government decision-making, [23] [24] [25] and as has been argued extensively, improves the legitimacy of decisions taken. [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] With this in mind, what participants deemed to be the requirements for using restrictive measures, e.g., proportionality, reciprocity, and consideration of community goods, can further inform and give legitimacy to policy development efforts on pandemic planning and response.",

Toutefois, le recours \u00e0 ces mesures est controvers\u00e9, car il n'y a pas de seuil commun\u00e9ment accept\u00e9 qui indique quand et comment s'en pr\u00e9valoir. Les objectifs de notre \u00e9tude \u00e9taient de sonder l'opinion des Canadiens sur les consid\u00e9rations \u00e9thiques qui soustendent l'emploi de mesures restrictives en r\u00e9action aux pand\u00e9mies d'influenza, et en retour, d'utiliser les r\u00e9sultats de ce sondage pour mieux comprendre ce qui justifie le recours \u00e0 des mesures restrictives aux yeux du public.M\u00e9thode : Nous avons organis\u00e9 une s\u00e9rie de discussions publiques avec des r\u00e9sidents canadiens entre juin 2008 et mai 2009 dans trois r\u00e9gions du Canada pour obtenir une vaste mobilisation populaire (n=3 groupes de 17 participants en tout).R\u00e9sultats : Deux grands th\u00e8mes se sont d\u00e9gag\u00e9s des discussions publiques; il faudrait : 1) cr\u00e9er un climat de conformit\u00e9 par la communication plut\u00f4t que par des mesures coercitives et 2) d\u00e9limiter les fronti\u00e8res entre les droits individuels, les valeurs collectives et le bien commun.",
