Whilst the majority of effort is aimed at infection, there is also need for clinical research on how to best manage seriously ill patients with COVID-19 [1] . Current available therapies -including non-specific anti-virals, antibiotics to treat secondary bacterial infections and sepsis, and corticosteroids to reduce inflammation -fail in severe disease where the hallmark is the cytokine storm induced by COVID-19 in the lung, visible as inflammatory lesions with ground-glass opacity on CT scan. Virally-triggered acute cytokine release of IL-2, IL-6, IL-7, GSCF, IP10, MCP1, MIP1A and TNF\uf061 induces pulmonary oedema, dysfunction of air-exchange, acute respiratory distress syndrome, acute cardiac injury, and often secondary infection, leading to death.",

In-hospital death is associated with age and notably IL-6 is a significant correlate. For COVID-19, the case fatality rate (CFR) remains unknown until the number infected is determined, but WHO estimates 0.3-1%, which is higher than 0.1% for influenza A. The accruing epidemiological analyses, linked with country-based mitigation strategies, and with estimates that about 80% COVID-19 patients have mild or asymptomatic disease, 14% severe disease, and 6% critically ill, underpin a continuing need for treatment of COVID-19 pneumonia in the long term.",

            "text": "improve the outcome of 7 enrolled patients with clinical COVID-19 pneumonia, with one critically severe, four severe, and 2 non-severe. Before transplantation, all had high fever, shortness of breath, and low oxygen saturation. Treatment was a single intravenous dose of clinical grade MSCs, 1\uf0b410 6 cells per kilogram of weight. Detailed follow-up over 14 days post-transplantation showed no adverse effects, and within 2 days, all patients had significantly improved pulmonary function, including the one severe COVID-19 pneumonia case who was well enough for discharge by day 10. With full details presented, overall, after treatment the peripheral lymphocytes increased with a shift towards the regulatory phenotype for both CD4+ T cells and dendritic cells; and inflammatory cytokines significantly decreased whilst IL-10 increased. The clinical MSC trial also asked if hCoV-19 infected the therapeutic MSC cells. hCoV-19 enters cells through the ACE2 receptor widely distributed on human cells including alveolar source to meet numerical need. Using nanotechnology synthetic stem cells are available as \"LIFNano\" with 1000 times increase in potency. [7] In a preclinical model of Multiple Sclerosis (MS), the time lines of reversal of paralysis (4 days) are in accord with those reported for COVID-19 pneumonia using MSC therapy (Movies). As an emerging alternative to cell-based therapy, nanomedicinals meet the need for a high volume and offthe-shelf therapeutic agent able to rejuvenate damaged tissues and suppress cytokine storm in pneumonia. Global distribution is simple using low volume vials. Delivery can be inhalation or intravenous or both. 4. SUMMARY AND URGENCY Whilst new vaccines to reduce infection rate of COVID-19 are being developed and scaled up, there is need to treat the significant number of patients who develop pneumonia. The remarkable new data using MSC demonstrate successful harnessing of natural endogenous pathways with powerful protective properties. With age, growth factors associated with stemness decline in favour of more inflammatory cytokines including IL-6a correlate with in-hospital death resulting from COVID-19.",
