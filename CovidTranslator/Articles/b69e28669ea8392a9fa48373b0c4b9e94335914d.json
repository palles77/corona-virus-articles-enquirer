In order to observe possible external factors in the sensitization process, a prospective study of 13 such children was done, in which serial clinical and immunologic observations were made at 3-to 6-month intervals over a period of 1 to 4 yr. Eleven of these children are now clinically allergic; 5 have asthma. Immunologic evidence for allergic sensitization was observed in these 1 I children by RAST, antigen-induced leukocyte histamine release, lymphoblastogenesis, and rise in serum IgE. Upper respiratory infections (URl) occurred in these II allergic children 1 to 2 months prior to the onset of allergic sensitization. In IO of these II URI children, complement-fixing antibodies to viruses (parainfluenza, RSV, CMV) increased in the same blood samples in which immunologic allergic sensitization was first evidenced. This coincidence suggests that certain viruses may contribute to the allergic sensitization process.",

This is the time during which effective optimal preventive or therapeutic measures can minimize any permanent damage from atopy. Therefore, if external events can trigger allergy in children, then preventing or overcoming the effects of such events might prevent allergic onset. That allergy, e.g., asthma, is hereditary was known even by such ancients as Maimonides. l Later, Cooke and Vander Veer,* in the first extensive study of heredity in allergy, found that 48% of 504 allergic patients had an immediate family history of allergy, while only 12% of a comparable nonallergic group had such a family history. In individuals whose parents were both allergic, 68% developed allergy before the age of 10; with one allergic parent, 5 1% developed allergy; and 38% had no family history of allergy. This suggested a simple mendelian inheritance. However, in subsequent genetic studies the inheritance of allergy was complex and polygenic,3 probably involving the immune response genes of the histocompatibility region. 4 We here report our prospective study of 13 chil- dren, who had a biparental allergic history, for the onset of symptoms and immunologic evidence of allergy. In this study we focused on the possible external events associated with the onset of allergy, such as infections, immunizations, or new foods.",

Therefore, we made clinical observations on the development of allergic symptoms in a group of 28 infants with nonallergic parents from our Well-Baby Clinic. These 28 children were followed at 3-month intervals for 1 year or more for signs of allergy.

His brother transmitted two respiratory infections to him at 1 and 2 months of age, but cultures from the nasopharynx were negative for bacterial pathogens. At 3 months, he presented with moderately severe eczema and mild nasal congestion. CMV titer was 64 and parainfluenza 3 titer was 8. Total IgE was less than 5 U/ml. Cow's milk RAST while breast feeding was borderline (E/C = I .7). Cat and mite RAST were negative. At 6 months, he had another URI, although rhinitis had been constant for the preceding 3 months, but eczema was somewhat improved. There was a 4-fold rise in parainfluenza 3 antibody titer to 1: 32. Total IgE rose 1 O-fold to 5 1 U/ml. Results of RAST and LTT to cow's milk were positive (E/C = 2.3 and 2.5, respectively) and they were positive to mite (E/C = 1.5 borderline and 4.1, respectively). At 7 months, he developed another URI; parainfluenza 3 was recovered from a nasopharyngeal swab; moderate wheezing was relieved with theophylline. At 9 months, in addition, RAST to cat was positive (E/C = 2.6). Although there was no cat in his home, 5 days per week the children were at a baby sitter's home where there was a cat. By 12 months, he had continuous 'rhinitis with nasal eosinophilia, moderate eczema, wheezing with respiratory infections, and was considered to be asthmatic. RAST was positive for cat, cow's milk, and mite (E/C = 3.0, 2.7, 2.1, respectively). In this child, onset of allergic sensitization to 3 or 4 allergens coincided with respiratory infections associated with positive nasopharyngeal cultures and rising antibody titer for parainfluenza 3.",

At 3 months, cat RAST (1.8) and HR (10%) were borderline-positive; she had mild nasal congestion and coughing.

At 2 years, cat and mite HR remain positive (38% and 25%, respectively) while mite RAST (1.8) is borderline.
