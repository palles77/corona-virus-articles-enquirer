However, during the infection time, few viral particles can be observed intracellularly. Analyzing the dynamics of the A-MLV infection process by using total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy, we show that the majority of viruses are extracellular and bound to the fibronectin matrix. Moreover, the amounts of bound virus and of fibronectin correlated. Using confocal microscopy, nanoparticles targeted to fibronectin by a III1C-fibronectin fragment or anti-fibronectin antibody were detected intracellularly in NIH 3T3 cells; unconjugated nanoparticles neither bound to cells nor were detectable intracellularly. Furthermore, A-MLV colocalized intracellularly with the fibronectin-targeted nanoparticles, suggesting that they were taken up by the same cellular pathway. Both A-MLV entry and fibronectin turnover depend on caveolar endocytosis, and we found that inhibiting viral binding to the extracellular NIH 3T3 fibronectin-matrix dramatically reduced A-MLV infection, indeed, showing an active role of fibronectin in infection. We suggest that binding to the cellular fibronectin matrix provides a new mechanism by which viruses can enter cells.",

            "text": "Knowledge of the role of cellular factors in retroviral entry increases our understanding of how viruses can exploit cellular features to enter host cells. Gammaretroviruses, like other enveloped viruses, are dependent on specific cellular receptors for fusion of the viral membrane with the cellular membrane; e.g., amphotropic murine leukemia virus (A-MLV) depends on the presence of the ubiquitously expressed sodium-dependent phosphate transporter Pit2 (17, 29, 48, 50) . MLV-based retroviral vectors including vectors carrying A-MLV envelope proteins are widely used in gene therapy protocols, and although retroviruses and retroviral vectors can infect a variety of dividing cell types, the efficiencies vary greatly among different cell types despite the fact that these cells all express Pit2 (48) . Specifically, efficient transduction of hematopoietic cells can only be achieved when infection occurs in the presence of chymotryptic fibronectin (FN) fragments like 30/35 FN, recombinant chimeric FN fragments like CH-296 (RetroNectin) (13, 32) , or shed FN (sFN) derived from NIH 3T3-based packaging cell lines (21 and C. S. S\u00f8ndergaard, C. Haldrup, C. Beer, D. B. Kohn, and L. Pedersen, submitted for publication). It has been suggested that increased infection is due to concomitant binding of vectors and cells to the fibronectin fragments and that this increases the likelihood that a vector and a cell will interact compared to the situation where both vectors and cells would be in suspension (13, 31) . In agreement with this hypothesis, we could recently show that gammaretroviral vectors bind to sFN from NIH 3T3 cultures (S\u00f8ndergaard et al., submitted).",

Cell surface FN has been found on various cell lines including fibroblasts (56) , astroglial cells (49) , and certain cultured epithelial cells (7, 9) .

Thus, impairing caveolar function severely impaired A-MLV infection of NIH 3T3 cells, and viral particles could be detected intracellularly colocalized with caveolin-1 (5). However, interestingly, compared to the multiplicity of infection employed during these studies, only a few viral particles could be detected intracellularly (5) . This observation, together with the fact that gammaretroviruses can bind to FN fragments, led us to investigate the role of ECM FN in the gammaretroviral infection of cells with an FN matrix.",

            "text": "The majority of A-MLV virions are immobilized extracellularly after their addition to NIH 3T3 cells. A major entry route for the gammaretrovirus A-MLV into NIH 3T3 mouse fibroblasts is via caveola-dependent endocytosis; however, compared to the multiplicities of infection employed, few viral particles were observed intracellularly (5) . To analyze the dy-namics of the A-MLV infection process, we used TIRF microscopy, which allows for the investigation of viral particles and caveolae at or near the cell surface. The A-MLV particles used were produced by transient transfection of 293T cells and carried a viral nucleocapsid protein fused to YFP (GagYFP A-MLV), which renders the vectors fluorescent and fusion defective (4) . Fluorescent A-MLVs were added to NIH 3T3 cells stably transfected with cav-1 mRed, and the cultures were incubated at 37\u00b0C for 1 h before unbound viral particles were removed and cells were analyzed by TIRF microscopy. Only a small amount of the viral particles was found associated or colocalized with caveolin-1 (5), in agreement with our previous studies; however, the noncolocalized viruses remained at the cell surface, with only minimal or without any movement ( Fig.  1 and see Video S1 in the supplemental material). The disappearance of the viral particles was most likely due to bleaching and not the result of uptake by the cells. Studying vectors produced by NIH 3T3-derived packaging cell cultures, we recently found that gammaretroviral vectors can bind to sFN fragments (S\u00f8ndergaard et al., submitted), and we therefore speculated that the A-MLV particles, after addition to NIH FIG. 1. Live-cell imaging of cav-1 mRed-expressing NIH 3T3 cells exposed to GagYFP A-MLV, using live-cell TIRF microscopy. The left panel shows the first frame taken. The panels on the right are enlarged images of the area indicated by the square, taken from the video sequence (180 frames, time is shown in min:s). Caveolin-1 mRed is shown in red, and GagYFP A-MLV is shown in green. See Video S1 in the supplemental material. To visualize the structure of the ECM FN of NIH 3T3 cells, cells were seeded in chamber slides, fixed, stained for FN using an anti-FN antibody, and examined by fluorescence microscopy. For comparison, Mus dunni tail fibroblasts (MDTF), baby hamster kidney fibroblasts (BHK21), and human embryonic kidney cells (293T) were analyzed in parallel. As expected, FN fibrils were present in cultures of the fibroblastic lines NIH 3T3, MDTF, and BHK21. The FN fibrils of MDTF cells were noticeably shorter than those of NIH 3T3 and BHK21 cells ( Fig. 2A) . In comparison, 293T cells showed only minimal staining for FN, and no FN fibrils were observed ( Fig. 2A) . The microscopy data shown in Fig. 2A were confirmed by flow cytometry (Fig. 2B) . Thus, NIH 3T3 cells possess extensive ECM FN, and using immunocytochemical staining, we investigated whether A-MLV did bind to this matrix. For comparison, fluorescent GagYFP no-env viral particles were included; these were made as described for the GagYFP A-MLV particles, except that no A-MLV envelope-encoding plasmid was included in the transient transfection (Fig. 3C) . NIH 3T3 cells were seeded into chamber slides and incubated with GagYFP A-MLV or GagYFP no-env particles, fixed, and stained for ECM FN (Fig. 3A) . Large amounts of fluorescent GagYFP A-MLV particles were found to bind to FN fibrils in the ECM (Fig. 3A) , which can explain why the majority of the viruses shown in Fig. 1 remained immobilized. Interestingly, GagYFP no-env particles also partially colocalized with FN (Fig. 3A) and bound to NIH 3T3 cells (Fig. 3B) . The smaller amount of envelope-protein-free particles bound to FN and NIH 3T3 cells compared to that of GagYFP A-MLV particles ( Fig. 3A and B ) is most likely due to a lower concentration of envelope-protein-free vector particles (Fig. 3C) . Therefore, we suggest that the A-MLV envelope protein is not essential for the attachment of A-MLV particles to NIH 3T3 cells and ECM FN. (Fig. 4) . Small amounts of FN corresponded to lower binding of GagYFP A-MLV and vice versa (Fig. 4) , indicating that there is a correlation between the amount of FN associated with the cells and the binding of A-MLV. NIH 3T3-derived sFN is built into the ECM of fibroblasts. As mentioned above, we recently found that NIH 3T3-derived gammaretroviral vector packaging cells produce sFN of various sizes and that vector particles were bound to the sFN fragments (S\u00f8ndergaard et al., submitted) . The sFN-bound vectors can infect NIH 3T3 and MDTF cells, which we found intriguing since both cell types have extensive FN matrices. We therefore investigated the fate of the packaging cell-derived sFN after its addition to NIH 3T3 and MDTF cells. For that purpose, we used supernatant produced by the PT67 packaging cell, which we found to be the highest sFN producer among the packaging cell lines previously analyzed, amounting to approximately 0.1 g/ml sFN (S\u00f8ndergaard et al., submitted). NIH 3T3 and MDTF cells and 293T cells as control were incubated with PT67 supernatant and stained for FN (Fig. 5A) . As soon as 1 h after incubation with PT67 supernatant, the FN fibrils in the NIH 3T3 and MDTF cultures became longer and even more pronounced. Moreover, flow cytometry analyses showed increased amounts of FN associated with cells which had been exposed to PT67 supernatant (Fig. 5B) . Thus, the PT67-derived sFN was built into the ECM FN of the two fibroblastic lines. Interestingly, 293T cells used sFN from PT67 cells to build up short FN fibrils (Fig. 5A) , thus gaining an ECM of FN. The increase in 293T-associated FN after the addition of PT67 supernatant was confirmed by flow cytometry (Fig. 5B) . Flow cytometric analysis of the human T-cell line Jurkat showed results similar to those of 293T (Fig. 5C ).",

Subsequently, the cells were incubated with GagYFP A-MLV, fixed, and stained for FN (Fig. 5D) . Incubation with PT67 supernatant led to increased FN matrix staining, as shown in Fig. 5A , whereas incubation with plasma FN or CH-296 had no effect (Fig. 5D) , even though 10-fold higher concentrations were applied in the latter two cases. Moreover, the presence of sFN from PT67 cells did increase the level of cell-bound GagYFP A-MLV, while plasma FN or CH-296 had no effect. Using a higher magnification, Fig. 5E shows that GagYFP A-MLV particles bound to FN fibrils present on NIH 3T3 cells after incubation with PT67 supernatant. The correlation between the increased FN amounts and the numbers of bound viruses is in agreement with the observations shown in Fig. 4 .",

However, in 2005, Sottile and Chandler reported that FN turnover also occurs via caveo- (19) . To investigate whether III1C-Qdots are taken up by NIH 3T3 cells, cells were seeded in chamber slides and incubated with III1C-Qdots for 24 h. Three-dimensional (3D) confocal microscopy revealed a mainly dot-like staining of the cells (Fig.  6A) , while FN fibrils were only negligibly stained. Moreover, intracellular III1C-Qdots were detected (Fig. 6B) , indicating that III1C-Qdots were taken up by NIH 3T3 cells. Unconjugated Qdots neither bound in significant amounts to NIH 3T3 cells nor could they be detected intracellularly (data not shown). Thus, the 10-nm Qdots conjugated with III1C can be taken up by NIH 3T3 cells.",

            "text": "While this is the first time gammaretroviral binding to ECM FN has been shown, other studies have shown that precoating culture plates with the fibronectin fragment CH-296 or other FN fragments leads to increased retroviral infection and that retroviral vectors can bind to these FN fragments (6, 13, 23, 32 and S\u00f8ndergaard et al., submitted). Specifically, it was shown that A-MLV can bind to plates coated with FN fragment CH-296 via virus-associated heparan sulfate (23); moreover, A-MLV binding to NIH 3T3 cultures was found to be impaired by preincubating the cells with heparin (52) . Thus, it is likely that A-MLV binds to ECM FN in the same manner. It cannot be excluded, however, that the virus also can bind via other mechanisms. Such an alternative indirect manner of virus binding to ECM FN indeed seems to exist for viruses associated with FN shed by some virus producer cells. We have thus found that gammaretroviral vectors produced by cultures of the NIH 3T3based packaging cell line PT67 bind to sFN fragments shed by these cells and that other NIH 3T3-derived packaging cells also produce sFN (S\u00f8ndergaard et al., submitted). Based on the observation in the present study that sFN produced by PT67 cell cultures can be incorporated into the existing FN matrix of NIH 3T3 and MDTF cells, we suggest an uptake mechanism similar to that of vectors directly associated with the ECM FN. It should be noticed that since vectors without envelope protein also attached to ECM FN, at least one virus-associated molecule involved in binding to the FN matrix is not the envelope protein or envelope protein associated.",

Indeed, viral particles could be found intracellularly colocalized with anti-FN antibodies. FN matrix turnover occurs via a caveola-dependent process (45) , and given that caveola-dependent endocytosis is the major entry route for A-MLV into NIH 3T3 cells and therefore an efficient infection route for the virus in these cells (5) , we suggest that A-MLV can be endocytosed in caveolae while sitting on FN. Based on the efficient down-regulation of A-MLV entry with preincubation with anti-FN antibodies, we moreover suggest that FN-assisted entry is a major entry route into NIH 3T3 cells. Indeed, this entry mechanism can explain how the viruses can overcome the extensive ECM of the fibroblastic cells.",

According to this model, binding of A-MLV to ECM FN occurs through virus-associated heparan sulfate or virusassociated sFN. After this first attachment, the viral particles are transported to caveolae. This could occur while the virus is still associated with FN and the FN matrix undergoes its natural turnover process via caveolae. Alternatively, the virus binds to its receptor Pit2 at the cell surface and is transported to caveolae. Presently, we have no results that can directly suggest which route, if any, is favored. But since we previously have found that Pit2 is partly localized in caveolae as well as directly associated with caveolin-1 (5), we suggest that the virus-receptor interaction does not necessarily have to occur at the cell surface; rather, the direction of an FN-bound virus toward caveolae and its uptake into caveolae would be sufficient to provide a microenvironment allowing for an interaction with its receptor.",

Remarkably, when incubating cells with FN fragment CH-296 or commercially available plasma FN, no obvious difference in the appearance of the FN fibrils could be noticed by immunocytochemical staining, although a slight increase in cell-bound FN was found by flow cytometry (Fig. 5C and D and data not shown). As CH-296 is known to allow binding of cells to culture plates (13), its low incorporation into the FN matrix was unexpected. But it is possible that the sFN produced by NIH 3T3 cells but not CH-296 exists in a form allowing for a fast and effective incorporation into the existing ECM FN. However, results by us and others strongly suggest that, like CH-296, sFN can increase gene transfer to different cell types (21 and S\u00f8ndergaard et al., submitted) . Thus, the present observations suggest that the mechanisms behind the abilities of CH-296 and NIH 3T3derived sFN to increase retroviral gene transfer indeed might differ.",

            "text": "In our studies of A-MLV binding to FN, we included characterization of the ECM FN of different cell lines including the fibroblast lines NIH 3T3, MDTF, and BHK21, as well as the embryonic kidney cell line 293T. As expected, the fibroblast cell lines exhibited a pronounced FN matrix, whereas no FN matrix could be observed with 293T cultures. The data presented here suggest that characterization of the FN matrix is of importance when interpreting virus-cell binding studies and in particular when creating retroviral vectors targeting specific cell types for gene therapy applications. Binding of viruses to cells that do not possess an FN matrix is expected to differ from binding to cells possessing an FN matrix, in that in the latter on March 20, 2020 by guest http://jvi.asm.org/ situation, our data strongly suggest that viruses able to bind to FN most likely will be immobilized at the ECM FN, which would not only affect their movement at the cell surface but probably also their entry kinetics and infectious half-lives. For human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1), it has been shown that incubation with superfibronectin, an in vitro synthesized multimeric form of FN (33) , significantly prolonged the infectivity of HIV-1 at 37\u00b0C (12) . Also for HIV-1, the ECM of cells has therefore been suggested to have a great impact on infections by trapping and stabilizing the viral particles (12) . The same may indeed be true for other viruses that are able to bind to FN. In addition, as suggested above, binding of retroviruses to ECM FN might be an important mechanism by which they can overcome the ECM and infect cells. Moreover, as the inhibition of binding to FN significantly reduced A-MLV infection of NIH 3T3 cells, our data also suggest that the FN matrix could protect cells against efficient infection with viruses that are not able to bind to FN. Binding to FN is not a phenomenon restricted to retroviruses. It has been shown that the envelope protein of influenza A binds to FN (16) . Interestingly, Nunes-Correia et al. reported that entry via caveolae is an additional entry route for influenza virus (35) . Therefore, our proposed model for A-MLV entry into cells possessing an FN matrix could be applicable to other FN-binding viruses, which may also exploit FN turnover to be taken up by cells. Moreover, FN binding has been shown to play an important role in bacterial infections, e.g., for Staphylococcus aureus (22, 39) and Streptococcus pyogenes (8) . Interestingly, entry of S. pyogenes has been related to caveola-dependent endocytosis; indeed, it seems to be the major entry route for S. pyogenes (41) . In addition, it has been shown that beads coated with the FN-binding protein Sfbl of S. pyogenes are efficiently taken up by cells (30, 41) . Therefore, we suggest that binding to FN might be a general mechanism for transport of FN-bound viruses, bacteria, and other ligands into cells.",

NIH 3T3 cells were incubated for 12 h with anti-FN-Qdots (red) and GagYFP A-MLV (green). Fixed cells were examined for the presence of intracellular colocalization of GagYFP A-MLV and anti-FN-Qdots (yellow) using 3D laser scanning confocal microscopy (30 slices; 0.39-m spacing). Shown are the Y-Z (left) and X-Z (top) sections with the corresponding X-Y section. (B) Inhibition of A-MLV binding to FN decreases viral infection. NIH 3T3 cells were treated with the indicated amounts of anti-FN antibody for 1 h and thereafter were infected with A-MLV (multiplicity of infection, approximately 0.07) in the presence of anti-FN antibody. The numbers of infected cells are normalized to the mock values. Shown are the means \u03ee standard deviations of one experiment done in duplicate. Similar results were obtained with two other independent experiments. (C) Investigation of the effect of anti-FN antibody treatment on the growth of NIH 3T3 cells. NIH 3T3 cells (\u03f35 to 10% \u2424-Gal-positive) were treated with anti-FN antibody or mock treated for 24 h, and \u2424-Gal-positive cells were counted. The numbers of \u2424-Gal-positive cells are normalized to the mock values. Shown are the means \u03ee standard deviations of one experiment done in sextuple.",
