Regarding the (3). We speculated from these two cases that infection routes, disease progression status (specimen collection timing and methods), and coinfection with other viruses might influence the rRT-PCR test accuracy, which should be further studied with more cases. False-negative rRT-PCR results were seen in many hospitals. By monitoring data collected at our hospital from January 21 to 31, 2020, two out of ten negative cases shown by the rRT-PCR test were finally confirmed to be positive for COVID-19, yielding an approximately 20% false-negative rate of rRT-PCR. Although the false-negative estimate would not be accurate until we expand the observational time span and number of monitored cases, the drawback of rRT-PCR was revealed. Clinical manifestations, laboratory examination results, and chest CT features of patients with COVID-19 were also of great value in helping the detection and diagnosis. Thus, an integrated criterion should be established for the diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection. In addition to the epidemiological information, we focused on two aspects of information: chest CT features and laboratory examination results.",

The National Health Commission of China revised the diagnostic criteria in the Hubei province, where a severe epidemic occurred (5) . A new diagnostic type called \"Clinical diagnosis\" was set according to the presence of pneumonia on chest CT, regardless of rRT-PCR results. To some extent, CT features and rRT-PCR results were complimentary in the diagnosis of COVID-19. From a clinical perspective, CT features could be utilized as the first and immediate reference for doctors to screen the highly suspected cases and to take necessary actions while rRT-PCR serves as a confirmation tool, the results of which could be utilized later to decide the subsequent action of continuing isolated treatment or discharge. Notably, our hospital was facilitated with a DL-based computer-aided diagnostic system (InferRead CT Pneumonia, Infervision, Beijing, China) for pneumonia, which greatly improved the detection efficiency for patients highly suspected with COVID-19 by alarming the technician within 2 minutes when any suspected cases was found after CT examination. The automatic lesion segmentation on CT was also helpful to evaluate the progression of COVID-19 quantitatively. With an integrated approach of DL, CT features, and rRT-PCR results, the screening and treatment of COVID-19 would be more effective.",
