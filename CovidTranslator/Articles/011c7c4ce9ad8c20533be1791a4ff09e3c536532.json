TB is an infectious disease caused by mycobacteria, usually M. tuberculosis (MTB) in humans. 2 HPV has been shown to be a major cause of cervical cancer. 3 Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) has recently emerged as an infectious disease with a high fatality rate in humans. 4 Diagnostic methods developed for these infectious diseases include reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for MERS-CoV, 5 sputum smear microscopy, culture of bacilli, and molecular species diagnostics for MTB 6\u221211 and Digene Hybrid Capture assay (HC2) and Pap smear test for HPV. 12, 13 While these techniques have been used for successful detection, they are difficult to implement in point-of-care clinical diagnostics particularly in developing countries lacking specialized medical facilities and skilled personnel. Therefore, simple, rapid, low-cost, and highly accurate on-site diagnostic platforms amenable to nucleic acid detection remain a challenge for early detection of infectious diseases for better patient management and infection control. Although DNA amplification is still needed with the current method to provide high sensitivity, we seek to further improve selectivity and assay simplicity to give immediate and quantitative responses in resource limited settings.",

When the hybridization of probe and target DNA occurs, the AgNPs aggregate and change color. 33, 34 The assay principal has been further adopted using charge-neutral peptide nucleic acids (PNA) 40,41 as the hybridization agent. PNA causes aggregation of metal nanoparticles in solution without immobilization, thus, simplifying the assay. 42, 43 Finally, PNAbased nanoparticle aggregation assays also provide a high hybridization efficiency of PNA-DNA duplexes leading to a rapid color change. 43 Recently, Vilaivan's group proposed a new conformationally constrained pyrrolidinyl PNA system which possesses an \u03b1,\u03b2-peptide backbone derived from D-proline/2-aminocyclopentanecarboxylic acid (known as acpcPNA). 44, 45 Compared to Nielsen's PNA, 40 acpcPNA exhibits a stronger affinity and higher sequence specificity binding to DNA. acpcPNA exhibits the characteristic selectivity of antiparallel binding to the target DNA and low tendency to self-hybridize. Moreover, the nucleobases and backbone of acpcPNA can be modified to increase molecular functionality. These combined properties make acpcPNA an attractive candidate as a probe for biological applications. 46\u221248 Here, the multiplex colorimetric PAD for DNA detection based on the aggregation of AgNPs induced by acpcPNA is reported. acpcPNA bearing a positively charged lysine modification at C-terminus was designed as the probe. The cationic PNA probe can interact with the negatively charged AgNPs leading to nanoparticle aggregation and a significant color change. This proposed sensor was used for simultaneous detection of MERS-CoV, MTB, and HPV. The developed paperbased DNA sensor has potential as an alternative diagnostic device for simple, rapid, sensitive, and selective DNA/RNA detection.",

First, the sample reservoir of the top layer was punched to provide a solution connection directly from the top to the bottom layer, and then the device was assembled by folding the top layer over the base layer to create the three-dimension origami paper-based device. A polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) lid was used for holding the two layers together.

According to the concept of PNA-induced AgNPs aggregation, 42, 43 acpcPNA was designed as a specific probe for quantitative detection of synthetic MERS-CoV, MTB, and HPV DNA targets. For colorimetric detection, the detection zone was prepared by adding 10 \u03bcL of AgNPs in 0.1 M phosphate buffer saline (PBS) pH 7.4 in a ratio of 5:1 (AgNPs: PBS), followed by 1 \u03bcL of specific acpcPNA probe. Control zones were prepared using the same conditions as the colorimetric Image Processing. The detection images were recorded using a scanner (XEROX DocuMate 3220) and saved in JPEG format at 600 dpi. ImageJ software (National Institutes of Health) was used to analyze the mean intensity of the color for each colorimetric reaction zone by applying a color threshold window for removing the blue background. Images were then inverted, and the mean intensity was measured. 20, 53 \u25a0 RESULTS AND DISCUSSION acpcPNA-Induced AgNPs Aggregation. The process of acpcPNA-induced AgNPs aggregation is shown in Scheme 2. The anionic AgNPs are initially well dispersed due to electrostatic repulsion. On addition of the cationic acpcPNA, the electrostatic repulsion is shielded, resulting in nanoparticle aggregation. When complementary DNA (DNA com ) is present, the specific PNA\u2212DNA interaction outcompetes the less specific PNA\u2212AgNPs interaction, resulting in a negatively charged PNA\u2212DNA com duplex and deaggregation of the anionic nanoparticles. Upon addition of noncomplementary DNA (DNA nc ), the acpcPNA should remain bound to the AgNPs and no color change occurs. To prove the concept, we designed and synthesized acpcPNA probes to detect synthetic oligonucleotide targets with sequences corresponding to MERS-CoV, MTB, and HPV type 16. The photographs of the results are shown in Figure 1 . The yellow AgNPs turned red when the acpcPNA was added. When the solution contained of the acpcPNA and DNA nc , the color also changed to red due to aggregation of the AgNPs. On the other hand, the color changed from red (aggregated) to yellow (nonaggregated) in the presence of DNA com , with the intensity dependent on the DNA concentration. Next, the sequence of adding the PNA probe and DNA target was investigated. As shown in Figure S3 , when equimolar DNA com was added either before or after the addition of acpcPNA probe into the AgNPs, the same color intensities were obtained indicating that the sequence of adding acpcPNA and DNA com did not impact the final signal.",

The intensity and, therefore, the degree of aggregation, increased with the concentration of NaCl, indicating that increasing ionic strength led to enhanced aggregation. 55 We believe that the ionic strength can decrease the electrostatic repulsion of citrate-stabilized AgNPs as a result of shielding, accelerating the AgNPs aggregation. The CCC was obtained when the degree of aggregation reached a maximum and became independent of NaCl concentration. In this experiment, the CCC of citrate-stabilized AgNPs was found to be 30 mM.

For a colorimetric assay based on acpcPNA-induced AgNPs aggregation, assay parameters including 0.1 M PBS (pH 7.4) ratio and acpcPNA concentration were optimized using a simple paper-based design. The degree of AgNPs aggregation was determined by measuring the color intensity of the resulting solution in the presence of acpcPNA without target DNA. First, the impact of the PBS concentration on AgNPs aggregation was measured. The differential color intensity (\u0394 intensity, \u0394I) obtained before and after addition of acpcPNA as a function of AgNPs to PBS ratio is shown in Figure 2A . \u0394I increased until the ratio of AgNPs/ PBS reached 5:1 and then decreased until it plateaued at 5:2. Thus, the ratio of 5:1 AgNPs/PBS was selected as the optimal condition because it gave the largest \u0394I. Another important aspect for the DNA assay is probe concentration. The influence of acpcPNA probe concentration on absolute intensity was studied. As shown in Figure 2B , the acpcPNA concentration was varied within a range of 0\u22122.5 \u03bcM, and the highest aggregation was obtained at the concentration of 1.0 \u03bcM. At this concentration, the aggregation became independent of acpcPNA concentration, which was desirable for simplifying the assay. Higher concentrations of AgNPs were not tested in order to minimize reagent consumption. As a result, the optimal conditions consisting of AgNPs/PBS ratio of 5:1 and acpcPNA concentration of 1.0 \u03bcM were selected for further experiments.",

            "text": "Selectivity of MERS-CoV, MTB, and HPV Detection. To investigate the selectivity of this system, the color intensity obtained from the DNA com of MERS-CoV, MTB, and HPV was compared to that of single-base mismatch (DNA m1 ), two-base mismatch (DNA m2 ), and DNA nc sequences. The color intensity decreased significantly in the presence of DNA com ; whereas, the intensity did not change for the mismatched and noncomplementary targets (Figure 3) . We believe the affinity of PNA\u2212DNA hybridization was reduced due to the contribution of one-and two-base mismatches, leaving free PNA to aggregate the nanoparticles. PNA\u2212DNA com complex can retard the ability of PNA to induce AgNPs aggregation as discussed above and result in different color intensities. These results suggest that the fully complementary DNA selectively hybridized the acpcPNA probe and yielded measurable signals. In addition, bovine serum albumin (BSA), which is commonly used in cell culture protocols, was used to investigate the protein interference of the proposed system. The DNA target was prepared in the presence of 3% BSA solution. It was observed that the color intensities of the DNA targets for MERS-CoV, MTB, and HPV in 3% BSA solution were statistically identical to the ones without BSA ( Figure S5) . Hence, common proteins should not negatively affect the analysis of this system. Analytical Performance. To assess the sensitivity of the proposed method for DNA quantification, the intensity as a function of the target DNA concentration was determined. The color intensity decreases with the target DNA concentration. The calibration curves for each species are shown in Figure 4A , B, and C for MERS-CoV, MTB, and HPV, respectively. The linear range for each DNA target using a logarithmic DNA concentration and color intensity (Figure 4 , inset) was also obtained. The analytical performances for all three DNA targets are summarized in Table 2 . It can be seen that a sufficiently low detection limit could be obtained for MERS-CoV, MTB, and HPV detection without the need for multiple PCR cycles. Moreover, this multiplex system can provide sensitive and selective detection for simultaneous analysis of multiple DNA targets in a single device, which simplifies the analysis compared to traditional diagnostics. 9,56\u221259 Device Design. Next, a multiplex device (Scheme 1) was designed for simultaneous detection of MERS-CoV, MTB, and HPV. The top layer contained four detection zones and four control zones. Each zone contained AgNPs with a single acpcPNA probe to provide selectivity for DNA. The base layer contained four wax-defined channels extending outward from a sample inlet. After the device was folded and stacked together, the channels of the base layer were connected to four detection zones of the top layer. Upon sample addition, the solution moved outward through the channels of the base layer to wet the colorimetric detection zones of the top layer and lead to color change. Figure 5 illustrates the ability of the proposed sensor for detection of 100 nM MERS-CoV, MTB, and HPV. Only the colorimetric detection zones that contained the selective probes changed color compared to their control zones. This result indicated that the multiplex paper-based colorimetric sensor is promising for simultaneous determination of MERS-CoV, MTB, and HPV.",

AgNPs were used as a colorimetric reagent for DNA detection based on acpcPNA-induced nanoparticle aggregation. This colorimetric DNA sensor exhibited high selectivity against single-base mismatch, two-base mismatch and noncomplementary target DNA. Under the optimized condition, the limit of detection for MERS-CoV, MTB, and HPV were found to be 1.53, 1.27, and 1.03 nM, respectively. As a result, this developed multiplex colorimetric PAD could be a low-cost and disposable alternative tool for rapid screening and detecting in infectious diagnostics. ",
