In this study we characterized the inhibition of PRRS virus (PRRSV) replication by antisense phosphorodiamidate morpholino oligomers (PMO). Of 12 peptide-conjugated PMO (PPMO), four were found to be highly effective at inhibiting PRRSV replication in cell culture in a dose-dependant and sequence-specific manner. PPMO 5UP2 and 5HP are complementary to sequence in the 5 end of the PRRSV genome, and 6P1 and 7P1 to sequence in the translation initiation regions of ORF6 and ORF7, respectively. Treatment of cells with 5UP2 or 5HP caused a 4.5 log 10 reduction in PRRSV yield, compared to a control PPMO. Combination of 6P1 and 7P1 led to higher level reduction than 6P1 or 7P1 alone. 5UP2, 5HP, and a combination of 6P1 and 7P1 inhibited PRRSV replication in porcine alveolar macrophages and protected the cells from PRRSV-induced cytopathic effect. Northern blot and real-time RT-PCR results demonstrated that the effective PPMO led to a reduction of PRRSV RNA level. 5UP2 and 5HP inhibited virus replication of 10 other strains of PRRSV. Results from this study suggest potential applications of PPMO for PRRS control.",

The clinical manifestations of PRRS includes severe reproductive failure, post-weaning pneumonia, growth reduction, and increased mortality (Keffaber, 1989; Loula, 1991) . The causative agent of this disease is PRRSV, an enveloped, single-stranded and positivesense RNA virus (J.J. . PRRSV is a member of the family Arteriviridae, which includes equine arteritis virus (EAV), lactate dehydrogenase-elevating virus for years; however, there is evidence of reversion to virulence of at least one of the current vaccine strains following use in pigs (Opriessnig et al., 2002) . Therefore, alternative strategies are needed for effective PRRS control. This study explored the inhibition of PRRSV propagation in cell cultures by peptideconjugated phosphorodiamidate morpholino oligomers (PPMO) specific for PRRSV sequences.",

            "text": "PMO are structurally similar to single-stranded DNA in that each subunit includes a purine or pyramidine base. In PMO each base is joined to a novel backbone consisting of one morpholine ring and phosphorodiamidate linkage per subunit (Summerton, 1999; Summerton and Weller, 1997) . PMO are uncharged, water-soluble, and highly resistant to nuclease degradation (Hudziak et al., 1996) . PMO bind to target mRNA by Watson-Crick base pairing and exert an antisense effect by preventing access to critical segments of RNA sequence, such as a translation initiation site, through steric blockade. This is a distinctly different process from the RNase H-dependent mechanism induced by the often-used antisense structural type phosphorothioate DNA (Summerton, 1999) . A number of studies have shown that PMO can effectively and specifically block translation of target mRNA in vitro and in vivo via intravenous, intraperitoneal, subcutaneous, transdermal or oral administration (Arora et al., 2002a,b; Brent and Drapeau, 2002; Hudziak et al., 2000; Qin et al., 2000; Stein et al., 2001; Taylor et al., 1996) . It has been shown that PMO conjugated to short arginine-rich cell penetrating peptides have a significantly higher efficiency of delivery into cultured cells than do non-conjugated PMO (Moulton et al., 2004; Deas et al., 2005) . PPMO were found to be fairly stable in cells and human serum for at least 24 h (Youngblood et al., 2007) . Sequence-specific antiviral efficacy of PPMO in cell cultures has been documented against SARS coronavirus (Neumann et al., 2005) , EAV (van den Born et al., 2005) , flaviviruses (Deas et al., 2005; Kinney et al., 2005) , Influenza A virus (Ge et al., 2006) , and Kaposi's sarcomaassociated herpesvirus (Zhang et al., 2007) . Recently PPMO were also applied in vivo and protected animals from challenge with Ebola Virus (Enterlein et al., 2006) , Coxsackievirus B3 (Yuan et al., 2006) , and murine coronaviruses (Burrer et al., 2007) .",

            "text": "PRRSV has an RNA genome approximately 15-kb in size, which consists of 5 untranslated region (UTR), nine open reading frames (ORF1a, ORF1b, ORF2a, ORF2b, and ORFs 3 through 7) and 3 UTR (Meng et al., 1994; J.J. Meulenberg et al., 1993) . Two large ORFs, la and lb, together occupy over 11 kb and encode 13 non-structural proteins, which are likely involved in genome replication and transcription (J.J. . The remaining ORFs, 2a through 7 encode six membraneassociated proteins (GP2, E, GP3, GP4, GP5, and M) and nucleocapsid (N) protein (Meulenberg et al., 1995) . In PRRSVinfected cells, a set of six or seven nested viral subgenomic RNA is formed (Conzelmann et al., 1993 ; J.J.M. . All of the subgenomic RNA have an identical 5 -leader sequence derived from the 5 end of genomic RNA, as well as an identical 3 terminal sequence preceding poly-(A) tails of variable length. The generation of co-terminal mRNA species is believed to be accomplished through a process known as dis-continuous subgenomic mRNA synthesis (Sawicki and Sawicki, 1995; van Marle et al., 1999) . The 5 end of each subgenomic mRNA of North American strains contains a common leader sequence of 190 bases (Nelsen et al., 1999) , whereas in Lelystad virus, the prototype strain of the European PRRSV genotype, the leader is 221 bases (J.J. . The 3 UTR of North American and European PRRSV strains are 150 and 120 bases, respectively, excluding the poly-(A) tail, and is common to all of their subgenomic mRNA. PRRSV subgenomic RNAs are polycistronic in structure, but it is believed that only the first open reading frame (ORF) of each subgenomic RNA is translated into a viral protein (Meng et al., 1996b) .",

Considering the lengthy genome and sequence heterogeneity of PRRSV strains, we sought to evaluate PPMO that target other sites of the genome and that have broad reactivity against different strains of PRRSV, and also to further refine our evaluation of efficacy and PPMO mechanism of action, in the hopes of defining a potential strategy for addressing PRRSV with PPMO technology.",

A fragment of 860 bases from the 5 end of the PRRSV genome was cloned into pcDNA3 vector, and used as template to generate standard curves for the real-time PCR, which was conducted in Chromo 4 TM Four-Color Real-Time System (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA) with iQ SYBR Green Supermix (Bio-Rad). Transcripts of \u2424-actin were also amplified from the same samples in order to assure normalized quantitative RT-PCR detection of PRRSV RNA from the cells.",

Parallel sequence alignments of PRRSV strains from each of the two major genotypes show that the 5 and 3 UTRs, and the translation initiation regions of all ORFs, within each genotype, are highly conserved. These regions likely participate in essential events of the viral life cycle (Tan et al., 2001; Verheije et al., 2002) , making them rational sites for antisense PPMO targeting. For this study, 12 PPMO were designed against PRRSV VR2385, a virulent strain of the North American genotype. PPMO sequences and target site locations in the PRRSV genome are specified in Table 1 and depicted schematically in Fig. 1B . The 5 terminal region has proven to be a productive PPMO target region in a number of positive-strand RNA viruses (Burrer et al., 2007; Deas et al., 2005; van den Born et al., 2005; Zhang et al., 2006) . PPMO 5UP2 and 5HP were designed to basepair to the 5 end region of PRRSV RNA genome, in an attempt to interfere with translation of viral RNA replicases. 5HP is complementary to the hairpin loop region, which was predicted from secondary structure analysis (41). PPMO complementary to negative-sense EAV RNA inhibited EAV replication in cell culture (van den Born et al., 2005) . NSP2 is complementary to the 3 end of negative-sense PRRSV RNA, and was designed to interfere with the production of positivesense viral RNA. NSP3 is complementary to negative-sense PRRSV RNA in the transcription regulatory sequence (TRS) region, in an attempt to interfere with synthesis and/or transla- tion of the viral subgenomic RNA. 3UP2 is complementary to the 3 end of PRRSV RNA genome, in an attempt to interfere with negative-strand RNA synthesis. PPMO 1bP1, 2P1, 3P1, 4P1, 5P1, 6P1, and 7P1 are complementary to the translation initiation regions of ORFs 1b, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7, respectively, to attempt blocking the translation of these ORFs. PPMO 5UP1, which is complementary to nucleotide 3-23 of PRRSV 5' terminal sequence and was previously shown to be highly effective (Zhang et al., 2006) and CP1 were included as positive and negative controls, respectively.",

IFA confirmed the PPMO inhibition of virus replication. These results indicate that PPMO may indeed have potential to control, or reduce the severity of, PRRSV infection in pigs. It was unexpected that PPMO-mediated reduction of virus yield in PAM was less than that observed in CRL11171 cells. This difference but may be because PRRSV has a higher replication rate in PAM than it does in CRL11171 cells, and the PPMO were unable to significantly interfere with the more rapid viral replication. Alternatively, differential uptake of PPMO by CRL11171 and PAM cultures may have had an effect. However, virus replication in PAM after treatment with 5UP2 did not result in cytopathic effect, and the cells were healthy for at least 1 week after virus inoculation. Further study is being undertaken to further investigate PPMO-mediated protection of primary cells.",

Sequence alignment (Fig. 7B) showed that the region targeted by these PPMO contains highly conserved sequences. In addition, analysis of PRRSV sequences from the GenBank indicates that the complementary sequence of 5UP2 and 5HP are highly conserved across North American PRRSV strains. Thus, these two antisense PPMO may be suitable for application against most North American PRRSV strains. The broad inhibition by 5UP2 and 5HP also further confirms that the 5 UTR of PRRSV is a highly productive target region for PPMO, and that this region likely plays an important role in arterivirus replication. A one base mismatch between 6P1 or 7P1 PPMO and their respective target sites in ten North American PRRSV strains may explain the low activity observed. (Fig. 7A and B) . It is noteworthy that all 10 strains had identical sequences in both the 6P1 and 7P1 target sites. Thus, a minor sequence modification of PPMO targeting these regions may lead to improved efficacy.",
