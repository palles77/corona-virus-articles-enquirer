SARSeCoV S-RBD has a 71-amino-acid (aa)(residues 424e494) extended loop, including two anti-parallel b-sheets (b5eb6) 2 . Its receptor-binding motif (RBM) is located in this extended loop, which is responsible for directly contacting the residues in the virus-binding site in the SARSeCoV's receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) on the target cell. 2, 3 The hCoV-EMC S-RBD contains a much longer (143-aa: residues 440e582) extended loop, consisting of two anti-parallel b-sheets (b5-b6) as well as three a-helices. The first two a-helices form a V-shaped structure. 1 Since the sequence length and conformation of the extended loop in the predicted hCoV-EMC S-RBD significantly differ from those in SARSeCoV S-RBD, we have predicted that hCoV-EMC must have a receptor different from that of SARSeCoV.",

To identify the RBM in the hCoV-EMC S-RBD, we performed a proteineprotein docking simulation analysis using our predicted hCoV-ECM S-RBD 1,5 as the ligand and DPP4 as the receptor. Since the native DPP4 is presented in a dimeric form on the cell surface, we used the X-ray structure of the DPP4 dimer (pdb: 1PFQ) 6,7 and the fully automated web server ClusPro 2.0 (http://cluspro.bu.edu) for rigid body docking. The ClusPro 2.0 server uses the newly developed docking program PIPER, 8 which performs a rigid body docking using the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) approach with pairwise interaction potential. About 1000 conformations with lowest scores are retained and clustered. We have selected one of the lowest scored docking poses from the 10 best clusters where the RBD of hCoV-EMC docked on the dimer interface of DPP4.",

Opinions differ regarding the efficacy of contact tracing. 3,4 UK guidance further recommends that healthcare workers \"inform and advise\" TB contacts with a negative screen during contact tracing to seek medical care if they develop symptoms suggestive of TB disease at a later date. Whilst sensible, there are little data to support this approach. In one of the few published studies, it compared favourably with chest radiograph-based follow-up for contacts of adults with smear positive pulmonary TB. 5 The lack of other relevant data makes further information on whether \"inform and advise\" results in improved TB detection helpful.",

This approach enables healthcare workers to give general information on TB, although requires buy-in from both the medical team (as the educational component can be time-consuming when delivered in a busy clinical setting) and the person exposed to tuberculosis, who may be from a culture where TB remains stigmatising, and hence information about it may be resisted. 10 We believe it is important to communicate with patients using empowering language rather than coercive terms that may lead to disengagement from healthcare services. 11 Information given during TB screening should be clear, relevant and easy to understand.",
