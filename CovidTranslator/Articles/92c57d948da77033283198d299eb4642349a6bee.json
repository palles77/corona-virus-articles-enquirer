Among other domains, it contains three sequentially arranged macrodomains: the X domain and subdomains SUD-N as well as SUD-M within the \"SARS-unique domain\". The X domain was proposed to be an ADP-ribose-1\"-phosphatase or a poly(ADP-ribose)-binding protein, whereas SUD-NM binds oligo(G)-nucleotides capable of forming G-quadruplexes. Here, we describe the application of a reverse genetic approach to assess the importance of these macrodomains for the activity of the SARS-CoV RTC. To this end, Renilla luciferase-encoding SARS-CoV replicons with selectively deleted macrodomains were constructed and their ability to modulate the RTC activity was examined. While the SUD-N and the X domains were found to be dispensable, the SUD-M domain was crucial for viral genome replication/transcription. Moreover, alanine replacement of charged amino-acid residues of the SUD-M domain, which are likely involved in G-quadruplex-binding, caused abrogation of RTC activity.",

            "text": "The Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) belongs to lineage b of the genus Betacoronavirus. During the SARS outbreak of 2003 (see Hilgenfeld and Peiris (2013) , for a recent review), the genome of SARS-CoV was sequenced within three weeks of the discovery of the virus (Marra et al., 2003; Rota et al., 2003) and subjected to detailed annotation shortly thereafter (Snijder et al., 2003) . At the same time and in subsequent years, leads for antiviral therapy were described (Anand et al., 2003; Yang et al., 2005; see Hilgenfeld (2014) , for a recent review). However, the detailed molecular characterization of viral genome replication and the assembly of viral particles was initially restricted to specialized high-safety laboratories. This limitation was overcome by the finding that SARS-CoV replicons are able to replicate autonomously in transfected host cells (Almaz\u00e1n et al., 2006; Ge et al., 2007; Eriksson et al., 2008; Pan et al., 2008; Wang et al., 2008; reviewed in Almaz\u00e1n et al., 2014) . Replicons, in particular those encoding a reporter gene, considerably facilitate the functional analysis of molecular determinants that control the replication and transcription of the SARS-CoV genome. SARS-CoV replicons consist of the genomic 5 0 and 3 0 untranslated regions and an open reading frame (ORF) encoding the two polyproteins (pp1a and, via a (-1) frame-shift, pp1ab) that are processed into 16 non-structural proteins (Nsp1 to Nsp16) to form the replication/transcription complex (RTC, Fig. 1A ). Among the Nsps, Nsp3 is a multi-domain polypeptide comprising the following structurally organized domains (Serrano et al., 2009; Johnson et al., 2010) : the ubiquitinlike domain 1 (UB1), the partially disordered acidic domain (Ac), the X domain, and the SARS-unique domain (SUD). This is followed by the second ubiquitin-like domain (UB2), which is usually considered part of the next domain, the papain-like protease (PL pro ). Cterminal to these, there is the nucleic-acid-binding domain (NAB), followed by a longer stretch of amino-acid residues apparently lacking secondary structure (occasionally called \"coronavirus group 2 marker (G2M)\"; Neuman et al., 2014) and the first transmembrane region (TM1). The zinc-finger (ZF) is the only domain on the luminal side of the membrane; the second transmembrane region (TM2) and, finally, the uncharacterized Y domain are localized near the C-terminus of Nsp3 (Fig. 1B , see Neuman et al. (2014) ).",

To this end, we have introduced in-frame deletions into the X and SUD regions of the SARS-CoV replicon, into which a reporter gene (Renilla luciferase, RLuc) was introduced under the control of the transcription regulatory sequence (TRS) for SARS-CoV structural protein M (Fig. 1A ). In addition, the functional role of the SUD C-terminal region (SUD-C, a frataxin-like domain with as yet unknown function (Johnson et al., 2010) ), was assessed in a similar way. The reporter gene-containing replicons were tested for their ability to support the activity of the RTC in the synthesis of subgenomic replicon RNA and to assess whether the deleted functions could be rescued in trans. The data presented indicate a crucial role for the SUD-M macrodomain for viral RTC activity, thus lending support to the significance of the previously observed binding of SUD to oligo(G)-containing nucleic acids (Tan et al., 2007 (Tan et al., , 2009 ). This observation was additionally reinforced by the analysis of replicons in which amino-acid mutations have been introduced in subdomains presumably involved in the interaction with G-quadruplexes (Tan et al., 2009) .",

These data encouraged us to introduce a luciferase reporter gene into the replicon pBAC-REP to enable the quantitative detection of viral genome replication simply by measuring the luciferase activity. The Renilla luciferase was chosen as a reporter protein because of its longer half-life as compared to that of the firefly luciferase (see Materials and methods and Tanaka et al., 2012) . However, the constructed full-length SARS-CoV replicon DNA, pBAC-REP-RLuc, was too large (approximately 33 kb) to ensure the correctness of desired deletions and/or mutations. Therefore, the engineered mutants lacking different genome fragments (complete SUD, or subdomains SUD-N, SUD-M, SUD-NM, and, finally, SUD-C, Fig. 1C ) were first introduced by sitedirected mutagenesis into the shorter plasmid pBAC-SfoI-MluI (approx. 15 kb, Supplementary Fig. 1B , Almaz\u00e1n et al., 2006) . The fragments containing the deletions were then excised from these pBAC-SfoI-MluI-derived plasmids and transferred back into plasmid pBAC-REP-RLuc. To recover the replication/transcription activity, the correctly oriented MluI-MluI fragment was inserted into the final plasmids. Supplementary Fig. 1 depicts our main strategy exemplified by the construction of the SUD-deleted SARS-CoV replicon encoding Renilla luciferase as reporter protein (pBAC-",

The replicon containing the mutations K476A and K477A (the mut2 set of mutations) located near the C-terminus of the SUD-N domain was also prepared for comparison, since these mutations had a weaker effect on SUD-oligo(G) binding according to zone-interference gel electrophoresis (Tan et al., 2009) .

There was a direct correlation of Renilla luciferase expression with the amount of viral RNA synthesis in mammalian cells transfected with the SARS-CoV replicon pBAC-REP-RLuc ( Fig. 2A and B, columns \"REP\"). Due to the specificity of the forward and reverse primers, the qRT-PCR system gave a nonsignificant background (Fig. 2B , column \"mock\").

In addition, the ADRP of Nsp3b, i.e. the X domain of human coronavirus 229E (HCoV 229E) can be inactivated by mutation without significantly affecting viral replication in cell culture (Putics et al., 2005) . To find out whether the X domain may display another, as yet uncharacterized activity involved in viral replication or transcription, we removed the coding sequence for the complete domain from the SARS-CoV replicon and found that the resulting replicon, pBAC-\u0394X-REP-RLuc, was replicationcompetent. Approximately 70-75% of the parental replicon (pBAC-REP-RLuc) activity (Fig. 2E , column \"REP\") was observed for the expression of the X domain-deleted replicon (Fig. 2E , column \"\u0394X\"). To ensure that the reporter-gene expression correlated with viral genome synthesis, Renilla luciferase activity expressed by constructs lacking individual domains (in this case the X domain) was directly compared with RNA synthesis. A high level of viral RNA synthesis was observed for the X-domaindeleted construct (Fig. 2F , column \"\u0394X\"). Thus, not only is the ADRP activity of the X domain not required for coronavirus replication in tissue culture, as shown for HCoV 229E (Putics et al., 2005) , but the entire X domain is dispensable in case of SARS-CoV (our data).",

Renilla luciferase activity and viral RNA synthesis were also measured after transfection of a replication-deficient SARS-CoV replicon (NR) and in mock-transfected cells (Cells). Data shown are from quadruplicate experiments, expressed as the mean value of RNA copies 7 standard deviation (SD). The difference in expression of the full-length SARS-CoV replicon and its various mutants was found to be significant, implying that values among them are greater than would be expected by chance (0.014 p4 0.001). Note that in the replication-deficient SARS-CoV replicon (NR), the sequence of the MluI-MluI fragment is reversed, thus preventing the formation of the replicase complex. RLUrelative light units. Hattermann et al., 2005) . However, the reporter gene activity did not exceed background level (Fig. 3, panel A) . None of the constructs expressing SUD or SUD-NM (columns 2 and 3, respectively) was able to considerably enhance the extremely low reporter gene activity of the SUD-lacking replicon co-transfected with vector alone (column 1). Intriguingly, the co-expression of SUD or SUD-NM with the replication-competent SARS-CoV replicon (REP-RLuc, columns 5 and 6, respectively) slightly inhibited the Renilla luciferase activity expressed by the replicon cotransfected with the vector pIVEX used as a control (column 4). Assuming that the inability to complement the SUD-deleted replicon by providing SUD or SUD-NM in trans was due to low levels of protein production, we increased the amount of expression using vaccinia virus (VV) MVA-T7 as a helper virus. Previously, we have successfully used MVA-T7 to efficiently express hepatitis A virus genes (Kusov et al., 2002) . Indeed, the transfection of constructs expressing SUD or SUD-NM followed by infection with the helper virus MVA-T7 (a procedure known as transinfection, Kusov et al., 2002) allowed immunological detection of SUD and SUD-NM using either polyclonal SARS-CoV anti-Nsp3 (Rockland; result not shown) or monoclonal anti-His 4 (Qiagen) (Fig. 3C) . Note that the level of Renilla luciferase expression by the SUD-deleted replicon was also increased, probably because of more efficient mRNA transcription from a cryptic promoter or due to a helper effect of VV for replicon RNA synthesis, as we and others have noticed previously (Sutter et al., 1995; Kusov et al., Fig. 3 . Impact of SUD and SUD-NM proteins, provided in trans, on the activity of the full-length and SUD-deleted SARS-CoV replicons. Indicated DNAs were co-transfected in Huh-T7 cells (A) or additionally infected with vaccinia virus MVA-T7 as a helper virus (see Materials and methods) (B). The infection and/or co-transfection mixtures were replaced with growth medium and incubated for an additional 48 h. The cell lysates were analyzed for Renilla luciferase (A and B, p o0.01) and anti-His immunological activity in mixtures 2 and 3 shown in panel B (C). All experiments were run in triplicate and the average was employed for analysis. Error bars represent standard deviations of the mean values.

To double-check these results, we have tried to supplement the parental SARS-CoV replicon pBAC-REP-RLuc. In line with the data presented in Fig. 3A , the co-expression of SUD or SUD-NM rather partially inhibited the Renilla luciferase activity of the replication-competent replicon (Fig. 3 , cf. columns 4 and 5 in panels A and B), implying that possibly a fine balance of the proteins is crucial for the formation of the active SARS-CoV replicase complex. Taken together, the functional activity of SUD in cis could not be supplemented in trans, neither by the full-length SUD nor by its more stable version SUD-NM consisting of the two macrodomains, SUD-N and SUD-M.",

We compared the activities of the replicons lacking individual SUD subdomains to that of the parental SARS-CoV replicon, pBAC-REP-RLuc. The SARS-CoV replicon lacking the SUD-N domain expressed 30 to 35% of the Renilla luciferase activity of the parental replicon (Fig. 2E , column \"\u0394N\"). Accordingly, its RNA level was well detectable in contrast to other SUD subdomain-deleted replicons (Fig. 2F , compare the column \"\u0394N\" with those for \u0394M and \u0394C). These data indicate that the SUD-N macrodomain may also be considered dispensable for SARS-CoV replication, similar to the X domain (see above), although their effects on replication may be considered \"minor\" (X domain) and \"moderate\" (SUD-N domain), respectively. In sharp contrast, the Renilla luciferase activity expressed by the replicon with the SUD-M domain deleted (Fig. 2E , column \"\u0394M\") did not exceed the level of the activity expressed by the replicationdeficient replicon pBAC-REP(NR)-RLuc (Fig. 2E , column \"NR\"). This activity was similar to the background level detected in mocktransfected cells (Fig. 2E , column \"Cells\"). The lack of replication of the SUD-M domain-deleted replicon, deduced from the negligible level of Renilla luciferase activity, was confirmed by quantification of the viral genome (Fig. 2F , column \"\u0394M\"). The pBAC-SUD\u0394C-REP-RLuc replicon was able to replicate only to a significantly lower extent than the construct lacking the SUD-N domain (Fig. 2 , E and F, cf. columns \"\u0394C\" and \"\u0394N\"). Nevertheless, its Renilla luciferase expression and the synthesis of viral RNA were always at detectable levels (Fig. 2 , E and F, columns \"\u0394C\"), in contrast to the activity of the SUD-M-lacking replicon (column \"\u0394M\") or to that of the replicon with the SUD-NM domains deleted (not shown). The RTC activity of the latter replicons was either at background level (columns \"Cells\") or at the level of the replication-deficient construct (columns \"NR\"). In summary, among all tested SARS-CoV replicons with the above-mentioned deletions, the replication ability was mostly affected by the deletion of the SUD-M macrodomain.",

Probably, this difference is connected with the reduced activity of the SARS-CoV replicon lacking the X domain (see Fig. 2E and F). In contrast to the effect of mut2 variants, the Renilla luciferase activity of replicons containing the mut4 set of mutations was negligible, thereby emphasizing the crucial role of the residues altered in the mut4 set of mutations for genome replication (Fig. 4A and B, -SUDmut4-and -\u0394X-SUDmut4-).

To this end, we have created various SARS-CoV replicons with deleted and/or mutated macrodomains. First, the X domain-encoding sequence was deleted from the Renilla luciferase-containing SARS-CoV replicon and the resulting replicon was tested for its ability to express the reporter gene. The X domain has been shown to exhibit a weak ADRP activity in most coronaviruses examined, but we have previously shown that this activity is not completely conserved across the family; thus, the X domain of the Beaudette strain of Infectious Bronchitis Virus (IBV) is unable to bind ADP-ribose due to replacement of a Gly-Gly-Gly triplet in the binding site by Gly-Ser-Gly (Piotrowski et al., 2009 ). Furthermore, Putics et al. (2005) reported that the ADRP activity of HCoV 229E is not essential for genome replication of this virus in cell culture. In this study, we find that the replicon pBAC-\u0394X-REP-RLuc expressed a high level of Renilla luciferase and was able to synthesize viral RNA after transfection into mammalian cells (Vero E6 or Huh-T7, a derivative of SARS-CoV-susceptible Huh-7 cells (Gillim-Ross et al., 2004; Hattermann et al., 2005) ). This indicates that the X domain does apparently not carry another, as yet unidentified, activity that would be essential for SARS-CoV replication/transcription. In sharp contrast to results with the deleted X domain, the SUD-lacking replicon, pBAC-\u0394SUD-REP-RLuc, abrogated reporter gene expression and the synthesis of viral RNA ( Fig. 2D and not shown, respectively). To our knowledge, this is the first description of the indispensability of SUD for SARS-CoV genome replication. The most plausible explanation for this observation is an essential role of the SUD-M macrodomain for viral RNA synthesis (see below).",

            "text": "Interestingly, all our attempts to complement in trans the SUD function by co-expression of the full-length SUD or SUD-NM failed, albeit the expression was evidenced by immunological detection of the proteins (see Fig. 3 ). Also, the replication of the complete SARS-CoV replicon was not enhanced when a full-length SUD or SUD-NM were provided in trans (Fig. 3) . The inability to supply SUD activity in trans rules out a hypothetical enzymatic activity of SUD. Taken together, these results indicate that the functionally active SUD is required only in cis or, alternatively, a fine balance of the proteins is essential for the formation of the active SARS-CoV replicase complex. These observations may substantiate the previously published data on enhancement of SARS-CoV reporter activity by the co-expression of Nsp3.1, which comprises domains X and SUD (Pan et al., 2008) . Now we can assume that this enhancement was mainly due to the presence of the X domain within Nsp3.1. Alternatively, the three sequentially positioned macrodomains, i.e. X, SUD-N, and SUD-M, may have (an) as yet unidentified function(s) enhancing SARS-CoV genome replication. Since full-length SUD was found to be crucial for SARS-CoV genome replication (Fig. 2D) and not able to complement in trans (Fig. 3) , we decided to gain further insight into the role of each SUD macrodomain for RTC activity. In addition, the Cterminal SUD subdomain (SUD-C) was also investigated by removal of the SUD-C-coding sequence from the SARS-CoV replicon. The deletion of the SUD-M domain completely abolished both replicon activities, thus indicating that the SUD-M domain is indispensable for SARS-CoV genome replication. In contrast, the SUD-N domain was revealed to be non-essential for RTC activity since its removal abolished neither Renilla luciferase expression nor viral RNA synthesis (Fig. 2 , E and F, columns \"\u0394N\"). The same is true for the SUD-C subdomain, although the RTC activity of the SUD-C-lacking replicon was always at a low level (Fig. 2 , E and F, columns \"\u0394C\"). Intriguingly, three amino-acid residues (K565, K568, and E571) located in the loop following the second \u03b1helix of SUD-M and responsible for the interaction of SUD with oligo(G)-nucleotides have previously been identified (Tan et al., 2009) . We propose that the SUD-oligo(G) interaction is required for SARS-CoV genome replication. The SARS-CoV genome contains a number of conserved G 4 stretches (Johnson et al., 2010 ) that could be binding-partners for SUD. Oligo(G) sequences are capable of forming G-quadruplexes, even if they comprise a few nonguanines; thus, the NMR structure of the prototype G-quadruplex that we used for docking into the SUD-NM cavity contains 8 nonguanines among 23 nucleotides (Dai et al., 2006) . Therefore, oligo (G) regions such as, e.g., 5 0 -GGGAGGUAGG-3 0 , which is found conserved in the Nsp2-and Nsp12-coding regions in the genomes of different SARS-CoV strains (Johnson et al., 2010) , are candidates for interaction with SUD.",

Such a modulation of PL pro activity by flanking regions has been reported for SARS-CoV PL pro (Harcourt et al., 2004; Han et al., 2005) and alphacoronavirus PL2 pro (Ziebuhr et al., 2001 (Ziebuhr et al., , 2007 . Therefore, to demonstrate a direct correlation between the G-quadruplex interaction and the replication ability of SARS-CoV replicons and to exclude a possible modulating effect of domains preceding the PL pro , we reasoned to leave the SUD intact but mutate the aminoacid residues putatively involved in SUD-binding to Gquadruplexes. The replacement of charged amino-acid residues by alanine (K565A, K568A, and E571A, mut4 set of mutations) on the surface of the SUD-M domain that is oriented towards the SUD-N domain and remote from the PL pro (Tan et al., 2009) , completely abrogated the Renilla luciferase expression (Fig. 4 ) and the synthesis of viral RNA (not shown), both in the context of the SARS-CoV replicon and its X-lacking version. In contrast, and consistent with the previously described marginal effect of the lysine residues at positions 476 and 477 of the SUD-N domain on G-quadruplex-binding in vitro (Tan et al., 2009) , the introduction of the mut2 set of mutations (K476A and K477A) into the abovementioned replicons had only a minor effect on expression of Renilla luciferase (Fig. 4 ) and viral RNA synthesis (not shown).

            "text": "Taken together, these data suggest SUD amino-acid residues that are strictly required for SARS-CoV genome replication. These residues (lysine residues 565, 568, and glutamate 571) are located in the loop connecting the second \u03b1-helix with the third \u03b2-strand of the SUD-M macrodomain; interestingly, the two lysine residues belong to a region shown to be involved in G 10 -binding by NMRshift perturbation analysis (Johnson et al., 2010) and are involved in interactions with a G-quadruplex according to our docking model ( Fig. 4C and D) . Considering their electrostatic potential, the replacement of these amino-acid residues by alanine will affect the charge distribution within the binding site for G-quadruplexes or other nucleic acids ( Supplementary Fig. 2 and Supplementary text B). Such a modification of the binding site's electrostatic potential results in abrogation of the SUDnucleic-acid interaction (Tan et al., 2009 ) that is required for SARS-CoV genome replication in a cell-based assay ( Supplementary Fig. 2) . On the other hand, the replacement of lysine by alanine at positions 476 and 477 did not significantly affect either the electrostatic potential of the binding site ( Supplementary Fig. 2) or the direct interaction with the G-quadruplex (Fig. 4C ). Although we did not construct the replicon containing arginine to alanine replacement at position 562, we speculate that this highly conserved arginine residue is also involved in G-quadruplex binding, since it is located in close proximity to the binding cavity ( Supplementary Fig. 3 and Fig. 4D ; R562, green label) and has also been identified as part of the nucleic-acid binding site in the NMR-shift perturbation experiments reported by Johnson et al. (2010) . In contrast, the lysine residue at position 563 seems to be oriented away from the binding pocket ( Fig. 4D; K563 , red label), thereby preventing its participation in oligo(G) interaction. The participation of the strictly conserved E571, which is located close to the binding site but negatively charged (Fig. 4D , orange label, and Supplementary  Fig. 3 ) needs to be further investigated. In summary, we have identified amino-acid residues essential for SARS-CoV genome replication, which requires SUD-oligo(G) interaction. Interestingly, this cluster of charged amino-acid residues located in the second \u03b1-helix of the SUD-M domain, or in the loop following it ( Fig. 4D; R562, K565, K568, and E571, green, blue, magenta, and orange labels, respectively), is conserved among established human SARS-CoV strains (Urbani, Frankfurt, Tor2, GZ02, and BJ01) and SARS-CoV-related bat and civet isolates (RsSHC014, RS3367, Rs672/2006, HKU3-1, Rf1, Rm1, Rp3, SZ3, SZ16, Bat273, Bat 279, and BM48) ( Supplementary Fig. 3) .",

Nevertheless, supporting a crucial role for oligo(G)binding in viral genome replication, a similar, but not identical, stretch of charged amino-acid residues was also found to be conserved in the genome of the newly emerging human Middle-East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and in the genomes of the closely related bat CoVs, HKU4 and HKU5, as well as in the genome of CoVs isolated from dromedars, which are supposed to be a primary animal reservoir of MERS-CoV (Memish et al., 2014 ) (see Supplementary Fig. 3) . Intriguingly, as seen for the SUD-M macrodomain, we found the putative M domain of MERS-CoV to bind exclusively oligo(G) (and not oligo(A), oligo(C), or oligo (U)) nucleotides (Lei et al., personal communication) . It is highly probable that this property is attributable to the stretch of conserved charged residues on the surface of the M domain of MERS-CoV (see Supplementary Fig. 3) . Further studies will be required to elucidate the impact of the deletions and mutations described here at the level of the full-length SARS-CoV genome and, in particular, to answer the question whether any second-site mutation(s) can rescue the mutated virus.",

The transcription regulatory sequence for the SARS-CoV M protein (TRS M) and a Kozak sequence enhancing expression in eukaryotic cells were included in the forward RLuc primer (Almaz\u00e1n et al., 2004; Kozak, 1989) . The PCR amplicon was treated with AscI and BamHI and introduced between the same restriction sites of the SARS-CoV replicon pBAC-REP-URB (Almaz\u00e1n et al., 2006) producing the reporter gene (RLuc)-containing SARS-CoV replicon, referred to as pBAC-REP-RLuc ( Supplementary  Fig. 1 ). To exactly conform to the Kozak sequence, the second amino-acid residue of Rluc (tyrosine) was replaced by alanine. This replacement was successfully employed in the RLuc expression vector pBS-35S-Rluc-Ala (acc. number AY189983).",

However, to simplify the cloning procedure, we used as template for site-directed mutagenesis the shorter plasmid pBAC-SfoI-MluI encoding only the N-terminal half of polyprotein 1a (Nsp1-Nsp3) of SARS-CoV (Almaz\u00e1n et al., 2006) . In brief, a Phusion Hot Start DNA polymerase (Phusion Site-Directed Mutagenesis Kit, Finnzymes), which ensures high fidelity for the amplification of large plasmids, was employed to extend perfectly matched 5 0 -phosphorylated forward and reverse primers (Supplementary Table 1) that border the deleted area as schematically exemplified in Supplementary Fig. 1B for deletion of the complete SUD sequence. The amplification mixture was treated with DpnI to destroy the original template DNA and the amplicon was circularized with Quick T4 DNA ligase (Finnzymes). An aliquot of the ligation mixture was transformed by electroporation (2.5 kV, 200 \u03a9, 25 mF) into electrocompetent E. coli cells (DH10B, NEB 10-beta, New England Biolabs) or HST02 (Takara) that are suitable for transformation of long-size plasmids. Positive clones were initially identified by restriction analysis and then confirmed by sequencing. An agarose gel-purified SfoI-\u0394SUD-MluI fragment was transferred into dephosphorylated pBAC-REP-RLuc ( Supplementary Fig. 1A ) that was restricted with SfoI and MluI. For this procedure, the DNA ligase \u2329long\u232a optimized for cloning large DNA fragments was used as recommended by the manufacturer (Takara). The efficiency of transformation was tremendously increased after removing components of the ligation buffer by sodium acetate/ethanol precipitation. The resulting SUD-lacking plasmid (\u0394SUD), which encoded the Renilla luciferase reporter gene, was still replication-deficient because of the absence of the MluI-MluI fragment. To restore all replicase components, this fragment was re-introduced at the MluI recognition site according to the procedure for cloning long DNA fragments (see above). The correct orientation of the MluI-MluI fragment was proven by StuI digestion prior to sequencing. The plasmid with reverse orientation of the MluI-MluI fragment was used as negative, nonreplicating (NR) control.",

The cell pellet was washed with PBS and cells were suspended in 100 ml PBS before dividing into two aliquots. A 20-ml aliquot of cell suspension was used for the evaluation of Renilla luciferase activity after lysis of pelleted cells in 50 ml Passive lysis buffer as described (see above). The total RNA was isolated from 80 ml of cell suspension using the RNeasy extraction kit and DNaseI treatment as recommended by the supplier (Qiagen). Trace amounts of DNA were removed from RNA preparations (20 ml) by additional treatment (37 1C, 30 min) with 1 unit of RNase-free DNase I in DNase buffer containing MgCl 2 . The DNase was inactivated by adding 1 ml of 25 mM EDTA solution and heating at 65 1C for 10 min. The yield of total RNA was quantified by using a NanoDrop 1000 UV/Vis spectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher). An equal amount (500 ng) of RNA samples extracted from cells transfected with deleted SARS-CoV replicons was directly used as template for the first-strand cDNA synthesis. The reaction mixture (25 ml) additionally containing a reverse \u0394X primer (200 nM, see Supplementary Table 1 ) and all four standard dNTPs (800 mM each) was pre-incubated at 65 1C for 5 min, chilled on ice to destroy any secondary structure of viral RNA and, after addition of RNase inhibitor (1 ml, Ribolock, Thermo Scientific) and reverse transcriptase (40 units, Thermo Scientific), further incubated at 45 1C for 60 min. The reverse transcriptase was inactivated by incubation at 70 1C for 5 min. A similar mixture without reverse transcriptase was used as a control. A 5-ml aliquot of the mixture was used for Real-Time PCR after addition of forward and reverse primers (0.3 mM each, see Supplementary  Table 1 ; note that these primers represent a sequence of Nsp1 allowing to determine genome replication, but not transcription), a fluorescence-quenching primer (6FAM-ACCATCAAGTATGGTGA-CAGCTGCTCT-BBQ, 0.2 mM; TIB MolBiol), and a Maxima Probe qPCR Master Mix (Fermentas, MBI) in a total volume of 20 ml.
