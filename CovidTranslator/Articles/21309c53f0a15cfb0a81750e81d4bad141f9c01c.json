            "text": "Background: Influenza causes a significant annual disease burden, with characterization of the infecting virus important in clinical and public health settings. Rapid immunoassays are fast but insensitive, whereas real-time RT-PCR is sensitive but susceptible to genetic mutations and often requires multiple serial assays. The FluChip-8G Influenza A+B Assay provides type and subtype/lineage identification of influenza A and B, including nonseasonal A viruses, in a single microarray-based assay with same day turnaround time. Objective: To evaluate key analytical performance characteristics of the FluChip-8G Influenza A+B Assay. Study design: Analytical sensitivity, cross-reactivity, and multi-site reproducibility were evaluated. Results: The limit of detection (LOD) for the FluChip-8G influenza A+B Assay ranged from 5.8 \u00d7 10 2 -1.5 \u00d7 10 5 genome copies/mL, with most samples \u223c2 \u00d7 10 3 genome copies/mL (\u223c160 genome copies/reaction). Fifty two (52) additional strains were correctly identified near the LOD, demonstrating robust reactivity. Two variant viruses (H1N1v and H3N2v) resulted in dual identification as both \"non-seasonal influenza A\" and A/ H1N1pdm09. No reproducible cross-reactivity was observed for the 34 organisms tested, however, challenges with internal control inhibition due to crude growth matrix were observed. Lastly, samples tested near the LOD showed high reproducibility (97.0% (95% CI 94.7-98.7)) regardless of operator, site, reagent lot, or testing day. Conclusion: The FluChip-8G Influenza A+B Assay is an effective new method for detecting and identifying both seasonal and non-seasonal influenza viruses, as revealed by good sensitivity and robust reactivity to 52 unique strains of influenza virus. In addition, the lack of cross-reactivity to non-influenza pathogens and high lab-to-lab reproducibility highlight the analytical performance of the assay as an alternative to real-time RT-PCR and sequencing-based assays. Clinical validation of the technology in a multi-site clinical study is the subject of a separate investigation.",

While detection is important clinically to enable efficient administration of antivirals and curb unnecessary administration of antibiotics, influenza requires robust ongoing annual surveillance of circulating strains to both monitor for antigenic drift and shift and guide annual vaccine strain selection (Jester et al., 2018) .",

Molecular assays based on real-time RT-PCR are typically performed by clinical and public health laboratories and provide excellent sensitivity. However, real-time RT-PCR-based tests typically amplify short portions of an internal gene segment for typing, and hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) gene segments for subtyping. Mutations in these targeted regions due to antigenic drift have caused decreased assay performance or failure (Stellrecht, 2018; Huzly et al., 2016; Yang et al., 2014) . In addition, many real-time RT-PCR assays require numerous singleplex assays run serially to characterize a specimen, increasing complexity and time to result for HA and NA subtyping. Planar substrate and bead-based microarray-based assays for influenza are also commercially available to type and often subtype influenza A as part of a multi-pathogen respiratory panel. These assays typically rely on a single amplified target as an indicator of the presence of a pathogen. While numerous microarray-based assays utilizing multiple probes per target for the detection of human and animal-origin influenza have appeared (Mukherjee and Chakrabarti, 2012; Heydarov et al., 2017; Paulin et al., 2014; Shi et al., 2014; Ryabinin et al., 2011; Gall et al., 2009; Li et al., 2009) , none are broadly commercially available. Next generation sequencing of influenza viruses provides the ability for complete characterization and is now routine in the three National Influenza Surveillance Reference Centers and at the CDC. However, next generation sequencing is not yet common for broader influenza surveillance or clinical use in part due to limited availability, cost, and complexity of data analysis (Jester et al., 2018; Balloux et al., 2018; Hampson et al., 2017) .",

This translates to a detection sensitivity of \u223c160 genome copies/reaction. While the H1N1v virus tested (A/ swine/Illinois/4L013/2015) was consistently identified correctly as influenza A, it was often identified as both A/non-seasonal and misidentified as an A/H1N1pdm09 virus. The LOD for this strain was therefore based on the concentration above which the results included the correct call of A/non-seasonal. Below the LOD, the H1N1v samples were misidentified as A/H1N1pdm09 without the corresponding A/ non-seasonal result. The H3N2v virus strain (A/Indiana/08/2011) resulted in correct identification as non-seasonal influenza A above the LOD, but was misidentified at lower concentrations as an A/ H1N1pdm09. These misidentifications are likely due to the genetic similarity of H1N1v and H3N2v strains to the seasonally circulating H1N1pdm09 virus. The H1N1pdm09 virus has continually reassorted with swine influenza A viruses, generating diverse reassortant genotypes (Nelson et al., 2016) . Specifically, the H1N1v for which the LOD was determined, A/swine/Illinois/4L013/2015, shares the M and NP gene segments with H1N1pdm09 strains, and the HA and NS gene segments have > 90% sequence homology. The H3N2v strain (A/Indiana/08/2011) shares the M gene with H1N1pdm09 strains, and the NP and NS gene segments also have > 90% sequence homology. Given that HA, NA, M, NP, and NS are the gene segments targeted by the FluChip-8G assay, it is not surprising that these viruses are mis-identified at low concentrations. In the event of an H1N1v or H3N2v infection, we note that the specimen would still be identified as influenza positive, enabling appropriate treatment. In addition, specimens with high enough H1N1v or H3N2v titer would produce a dual infection result that would prompt reanalysis and still enable appropriate followup by public health authorities.",

The accurate detection of these subtypes indicates the broad detectability of non-seasonal influenza A viruses by the assay. We also note that additional H1N1v and H3N2v strains included in analytical reactivity testing were correctly identified at the No consistent cross-reactivity with any of the non-influenza pathogens tested was observed (Table 3) . As mentioned, six (6) of the thirtyfour (34) tested bacteria and viruses did result in at least one internal control failure at the initial concentration analyzed. As these microorganisms were not purified, it was hypothesized that the complex crude bacterial growth medium they were supplied in caused assay inhibition resulting in internal control failures. To further investigate whether the internal control failures were due to the growth medium or to the organism itself, the microorganisms were subsequently diluted and reanalyzed. In four (4) cases (M. catarrhalis, S. pyogenes, S. salivarius, and P. aeruginosa (strain Shr42)) the cross-reactivity was resolved, indicating the growth medium was the likely cause. Internal control failures recurred in samples containing M. pneumoniae and N. meningitidis even after dilution.

The expected assay results were obtained for 98.5% (95% CI of 97.1-99.2) of samples run at or above the LOD regardless of operator, site, testing day, and reagent lot. Below the LOD, a positive influenza result was obtained in only 22.6% (95% CI of 18.0-27.9) of samples run below the LOD. This increased variability is expected for concentrations below the assay LOD due to the stochastic nature of PCR-based amplification at low input copy number.",

The ability to detect and positively identify a wide variety of novel or emerging influenza viruses as \"non-seasonal\" influenza A in the same assay in which seasonally circulating influenza viruses are characterized is therefore unique compared to other available influenza molecular diagnostic assays. In addition, the full gene segment amplification approach combined with pattern-recognition based data analysis allows for rapid updates to the software algorithm as new viruses emerge, without requiring changes to the assay procedure. We hope the availability of this same day result will better enable rapid and appropriate notification of public health authorities in the case of identification of a potentially pandemic virus to enhance pandemic preparedness efforts.
