            "text": "Background: Several studies have been published regarding the epidemiology and clinical significance of the different rhinovirus (RV) species (-A, -B and -C). However, data on RV types and the associations with clinical outcome in young children are limited. Here, we investigated the clinical, virological and epidemiological characteristics of RV infections in young children with mild or asymptomatic infection (non-hospitalised children) and in symptomatic young children admitted to the hospital. Objectives: The aim of this study was to evaluate associations between different characteristics of RV infections and clinical outcome in young children. Study design: RV-infected children were retrospectively selected from a Dutch birth cohort (EUROPAstudy) and from hospitalised children admitted to the hospital because of respiratory symptoms. In total 120 RV-typed samples could be selected from 65 non-hospitalised and 49 hospitalised children between November 2009 and December 2012. Results: RV-A was the predominant species in both study populations, followed closely by RV-C. RV-B was observed only sporadically. The distribution of the RV species was comparable in non-hospitalised and hospitalised children. In children with respiratory distress who required ICU-admission the distribution of RV species did not differ significantly from the non-hospitalised children. No predominant RV type was present in non-hospitalised nor hospitalised children. However, hospitalised children were younger, had more often an underlying illness, a higher RV load and more frequently a bacterial co-infection. Conclusions: Clinical outcome of RV infected young children was not related to RV species or types, but may more likely be influenced by multiple (host-specific) factors.",

Together with host susceptibility, the RV type and the cellular tropism, as partly determined by the virus receptor used, may be important factors contributing to disease and clinical outcome in young children [9] . Up to date, data on the relation between RV types and clinical symptoms combined with the occurrence of RV types during various seasons in one year and circulation patterns are limited and often available either for hospitalised or asymptomatic children.",

The population of hospitalised children consisted of retrospectively selected samples from children admitted to the Academic Medical Center (AMC), Amsterdam, because of respiratory tract disease (defined as a combination of one or more of the following symptoms: fever, rhinitis, cough, dyspnoea, tachypnoea, and/or wheezing).

The complete protocol for RV typing is provided as supplementary data (see Supplementary file). All RVs were divided in (i) the major group (which bind to the intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1)), (ii) the minor group (which use the low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDL-R) as a receptor), and (iii) the RV-C group which most probably uses the human cadherin-related family member 3 (CDHR3) receptor [13, 14] .

When evaluating the patient characteristics we found a high percentage of the hospitalised children having an underlying illness. Prematurity was the most common and a probable risk factor for more serious RV disease. Secondly, the median age in the hospitalised children was significantly lower than the median age at sampling for non-hospitalised children. As younger children are more vulnerable for hospitalisation this was not an unexpected finding. However, as our study is not a matched casecontrol study we cannot exclude an age-specific distribution of RV species and types. Ct-values differed significantly between nonhospitalised and hospitalised children. We found a higher viral load (indicated by lower Ct values) in hospitalised children, suggesting that a higher viral load might lead to more severe disease [15, 23] . This has been described in other studies as well [24] . Another influencing factor might be infection with co-pathogens. The frequency of viral co-infections was comparable in both groups, but a bacterial co-infection was detected more often in severely ill children. Our study indicates that bacterial co-infection, and especially coinfection with respiratory pathogens such as M. catarrhalis and H. influenzae, might be an important contribution to disease severity.",
