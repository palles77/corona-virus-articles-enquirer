Immunocrossreaction of these mAbs with JHM and/or MHV-S suggest that antigenic epitopes of HE of DVIM are similar to those of JHM and/or MHV-S. Four mAbs (1b4, 3a28, 4c19, 10b7), designated as group A mAbs, strongly inhibited both HA and AE activities. On the other hand, three mAbs (5a3, 6a6, 13a4), referred to as group B, had a comparatively weak HA inhibition activity. These results indicate that the antigenic epitopes of this glycoprotein can be classified into at least two groups and that the functional sites of HA and AE activities are similar but not identical. Neutralizing activity was shown in group A mAbs exclusively, suggesting that the ratio of HA and/or AE activities may play important roles in the cell fusion activity of DVIM-infected cells.",

Murine coronavirus MHV-DVIM is an enteropathogenic coronavirus causing severe diarrhea in newborn mice [6] [7] [8] . As described in a previous report [8] , by treatment of DVIM with the non-ionic detergent NP-40 we isolated the HE protein, which carries the functional sites for both acetylesterase (AE) and the haemagglutination (HA) activities. The contribution of these activities to infection by MHV-DVIM is not yet known, nor is their relation to the antigenic epitopes. To know the antigenic properties of HE, several monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) raised against the purified protein were established and used to characterize the HE protein. In the present report, we provide evidence that the functional sites for AE and HA activities have separate locations on the HE protein. Furthermore, mAbs that inhibit AE activity also suppress the ability of DVIM to cause cell fusion from within.",

As shown in Table 1 , five mAbs (4c19, 10b7, 3a28, 1b4 and 5a3) showed high AEI titers (55-86%). Two mAbs (6a6 and 13a4) were found to have low levels (10-12%) of AEI titer. High hemagglutination inhibition (HAI) titers (> 512) were measured with three mAbs (10b7 and 4c19). With two mAbs (1b4 and 3a28), intermediate values (32-64) were obtained. The mAbs (6a6, 5a3 and 13a4) had low HAI titers (<4 \u223c 8) (Table 1) . These data suggest that these mAbs were classifiable into at least two groups: group A (4c19, 10b7 and 1b4) that has a high titer to both activities and an intermediate titer to the HA activity, and group B (5a3, 6a6 and 13a4) that has low titers to both activities ( Fig. 5 and Table 1 ). To determine the correlations between AE and HA active sites, the inhibitory effects against HA and AE activities by DFP were also tested. Inhibitory effects were shown only in the AE activity and not in the HA activity (data not shown).

For some viruses, such as bovine coronavirus and human coronavirus OC43, this protein appears to be essential, because no variants or mutants that lack this protein have been found [3, 5] . The esterase activity of HE has been suggested to play a role either in virus entry or in virus release [3] [4] [5] . Though MHV is serologically related, it differs from the other viruses of this serogroup in several aspects. While the bovine and human counterparts use 9-O-acetylated sialic acid on the plasma membrane for binding to cells, biliary glycoprotein serves as a receptor for MHV [1, 9, 10] . In addition only some strains of MHV contain an HE-protein, while others lack such a protein [3, 5] . Even strains like DVIM that contain an HE-protein and thus are able to release the O-acetyl groups from N-acetyl-9-O-acetylneuraminid acid use biliary glycoprotein as a receptor [2] . Thus, the importance of the HE-protein for MHV is not known.",

With respect to inhibition of hemagglutination activity and acetylesterase activity, there were antibodies that had a high titer to both activities or a high titer to one activity and an intermediate titer to the other activity. Two antibodies had low titers to both activities. From these results, we conclude that there are several epitopes present on the HE protein. The data also indicate that the functional sites of the hemagglutination and acetylesterase activities are similar but not identical. None of the antibodies completely neutralized DVIM. However, some of the antibodies delayed the onset of syncytium formation and the cytopathic affect. All these antibodies had high AEI activities and high or intermediate HAI activities. The antibodies that had low titers to both activities did not delay the fusion of infected cells. Therefore, a functional acetylesterase activity and/or hemagglutination activity appear to be necessary for optimal infection by DVIM. Further investigation is needed to determine the exact role of the HE protein. The antibodies described here should be helpful in this respect.",
