Areas of research range from the potentially lucrative markets for outpatient, 'office'-based and patient self-testing, through to in-hospital diagnostics, which include both rapid access analysis of traditionally laboratory bound diagnostics and direct patient imaging. Both aspects are particularly relevant to critical care clinicians, who rely on time sensitive diagnosis and treatment in a hyper-acute setting. An example of bedside imaging in cardiac assessment has already been cited in the first article of the present series [2] . Sample analysis, meanwhile, is rapidly developing to encompass bedside biochemical markers, physiological homeostasis monitoring, and novel ultra-rapid forms of infectious disease diagnosis.",

The first major prospective study of tight glucose control in sepsis introduced a novel algorithm requiring frequent measurements [6] , which raised concerns over patient safety and resource utilization in general ICUs. Point-of-care 'stick' glucose testing is already prevalent, but technology now exists for continuous in vivo glucose monitoring, which, although intended for ambulatory use, could improve accuracy in the acute setting. A subcutaneous interstitial glucose sensor system (Continuous Glucose Monitoring System; Medtronic MiniMed, Inc., Northridge, CA, USA) was tested against clamp controlled hypoglycaemic and hyperglycaemic excursions in volunteers [7] ; it was shown to be closely correlated with reference analyzer results (r 2 = 0.91; P < 0.001) and highly responsive (half-time 4.0 \u00b1 1.0 min). Similarly, another device (Glucoday; A. Menarini Diagnostics, Florence, Italy), utilizing a 15-100 \u00b5l micropump and a biosensor coupled with microdialysis to give a claimed response time of 2 min, will reach European markets this year. Such devices may be incorporated into manual algorithms, or they may potentially open the way to automated closed-loop glucose control.",

In the light of recent North American power outages and destructive computer failures in the UK social service and tax systems, emergent behavour must now be considered a clear and present threat to our increasingly networked health services and their supporting infrastructure. Levels of concern are such that the UK Government is funding a \u00a310 million research programme into IT complexity and catastrophic failures.",

They therefore require the successful convergence of multiple hospital systems, which makes them uniquely vulnerable to the consequences of system failures, whether in diagnostics, supplies, information flow, or indeed electrical power. Second, the currently stated UK NPfIT vision is that all ICU subsystems, including networked monitoring, telemetry and audit systems, will eventually be integrated into NPfIT, with control over equipment selection and data collection handed to the regional private sector consortia and to national audit bodies. Clinician engagement and choice may not feature highly on the agenda, and there are clear concerns over the future of independent research and audit. Finally, clinicians from other countries would be well advised to follow such developments because the UK is not unique in its desire to radically modernize and standardize health IT, starting with a drive toward electronic patient records. In April 2004, President Bush issued an executive order calling for US national implementation of electronic medical records within 10 years, from a current baseline of 19% implementation. In a series of presidential speeches he went on to further define health care objectives substantially similar to the UK NPfIT agenda [22] .",
