            "text": "JHM virus, when inoculated into neonatal rats, can cause either a rapidly fatal acute encephalomyelitis or, after longer incubation periods, a paralytic disease. The cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and serum anti-JHM virus IgG concentrations present in rats prior to onset of clinical symptoms or during the acute and paralytic phases of disease were compared. High CSF/serum ratios, indicative of local antibody production in the CNS, were noted only where disease was demonstrable suggesting that local antibody production accompanied the infection but did not prevent the neurological disease. Among animals in which neurologic symptoms had not become manifest, only those with elevated CSF/serum ratios were found to have histological CNS lesions. Immunofluorescent microscopy indicated that viral antigens were present in both glia and neurons. Antigen-positive cells were frequently present in histologically normal CNS tissue, while regions of necrosis were antigen negative. Testing for the presence of viral RNA with JHM cDNA probes revealed that the virus was rapidly disseminated throughout the CNS, presumably establishing centers of infection prior to the development of recognizable tissue damage. Viral RNA was also detected in the CNS following recovery from paralysis and as late as 5 months postinfection, where no disease occurred. These findings indicate that, although infection by JHM virus can spread rapidly throughout the CNS, formation of lesions during chronic disease is a slower process. The current data and previous observations suggest that JHM virus can remain in a latent state for periods of at least several months in rats without apparent neurologic disease despite the absence of any known provirus phase in the replicative strategy of coronaviruses.",

Although it is clear that the rat may exercise profound control over the outcome of the infectious process initiated by JHMV, since susceptibility to disease is both age related and genetically controlled (Sorensen et al, 1982) , it remains to be established whether the onset of resistance is connected with the appearance of intracerebral immune responses. It is also uncertain whether such responses offer protection, in view of previous observations that neutralizing antibodies in the serum do not appear to influence the disease process (Sorensen et ak, 1982) . However, the presence of antibodies against OC43 and 2293, human coronaviruses serologitally related to the murine strains, in the sera of a high proportion of the human population (Macnaughton, 1982) and intrathecal antibodies in some MS patients (Salmi et ak, 1982; Hovanec and Flanagan, 1983) give the rat/coronavirus model particular relevance in attempts to elucidate the etiology of the human disease.",

These ratios were comparable to those evident in animals undergoing acute disease.

A smaller group of rats, distinguished by intermediate CSF/serum ratios (data not shown), was also identified. This group may be comprised of animals in which demyelinating lesions would have eventually developed. The RIA method as used here detected those subclasses of IgG able to bind any JHMV antigen including those capable of neutralizing the virus.

Examination of sections adjacent to those stained with HE for the presence of antigen, by means of indirect immunofluorescence, revealed that the distribution of viral proteins in the CNS differed from that of the lesions. A few cells near necrotic lesions were positive (Fig. 2) , but cells containing JHMV antigen were more abundant in areas which appeared to be histologically normal (Fig. 3) and those characterized by lymphocytic infiltrates. Neurons of the cerebrum and cerebellum were more frequently infected than previously realized. Positive cerebral neurons (Fig. 3) were detected in some rats 21 dpi and even later, despite the fact that those lesions recognizable by HE staining were exclusively of the demyelinating type, suggesting oligodendrocyte involvement. JHMV antigen-positive cells were evident in both neurons and glia of the spinal cord although paralyzed rats with histological lesions confined to myelinated tracts of the rhombencephalon and spinal cord also displayed antigen in both neu- The detection of antigen-positive cells in the CNS by immunofluorescent microscopy enabled us to pinpoint sites where JHMV proteins were being expressed but provided no direct evidence about viral latency. To address the question of latency, CNS tissues were surveyed for the presence of JHMV RNA with a cDNA probe. The CNS regions which were examined, described diagrammatically in Fig. 1 , included the telencephalon, diencephalon/ mesencephalon, cerebellum, pons/myelencephalon, cervical and lumbar segments of the spinal cord and, whenever possible, the optic nerves. Using =P-labeled cDNA in the dot-blot procedure it was found that RNA extracted from uninoculated rats did not hybridize with the probe (Fig.  4D ). In contrast, after infection, JHMV RNA became widely distributed in the CNS of animals displaying clinical and histological signs of disease. High concentrations of JHMV RNA were detected in extracts from the CNS of rats with a generalized encephalomyelitis (Fig. 4A ). Viral RNA could be detected throughout the CNS as early as 6 dpi. The distribution of JHMV RNA was more extensive than that of histological lesions associated with the neurological disease process. Although both the pons/myelencephalon and cervical spinal cord contained viral RNA sequences at 6 dpi, the histological lesions were found to be concentrated in rostra1 regions of the CNS (Fig. 5) .",

In the present analysis, however, viral antigen was frequently detected in cells with neuron morphology, although it has not been established whether the cells involved were producing infectious JHMV particles or only viral protein. These and previous observations (Sorensen et d, 1980) imply that JHMV can persist and replicate within neurons and oligodendrocytes without causing cell degeneration and death or eliciting an immune attack which might lead to tissue necrosis and suppression of the infection. In mice Knobler et aL(l98lb) have similarly shown that neurons of SJL mice are a primary target for JHMV infection. Furthermore, as in the rat, SJL mice exhibit an age-dependent resistance to CNS infection following an ic challenge with JHMV. Specific tropisms of JHMV for primary CNS cultures enriched in oligodendrocytes and of MHV-3 for cultures of astrocytes (Sorensen et aL, 1983, Beushausen and Dales, in preparation) have also been found.

Despite the usual absence of histological lesions in the cervical spinal cord of acutely diseased animals (Sorensen et aL, 1980) the presence of JHMV RNA in this tissue again implies that viral replication precedes the development of lesions. When the disease process resulted in demyelination, the distribution of viral RNA within the CNS was more restricted, so that the more rostra1 tissues had either little or no detectable JHMV RNA while in the rhombencephalon and, to a lesser extent, the cervical spinal cord, viral RNA was readily detectable.",
