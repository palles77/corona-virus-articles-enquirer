Methods: In this exploratory, qualitative study, 10 emergency nurses from a regional hospital in Hong Kong were recruited using purposive sampling. Semi-structured, face-to-face individual interviews were conducted. Qualitative content analysis was utilized to analyze the transcripts. Results: The three following categories emerged from the interview data: concerns about health, comments on the administration, and attitudes of professionalism. Nurses viewed the human swine influenza as a threat to their personal and families' health. However, nurses perceived that the severity of the disease was exaggerated by the public. Improvements in planning the circulation of information, allocation of manpower, and utilization of personal protective equipment were indicated. The emergency nurses demonstrated a sense of commitment and professional morale in promoting a high quality of nursing care. Discussion: Various factors affecting the perceptions of emergency nurses toward their professional duties during the influenza pandemic were identified. By understanding these perceptions, appropriate planning, policies, and guidelines can be formulated to meet the healthcare needs of patients during future pandemic outbreaks.",

The latest influenza pandemic event started with the detection of a rapidly circulating new influenza strain called the human swine influenza (HSI) (WHO, 2010) . The high frequency and intensity of procedures that involve close physical patient contact present occupational hazards for emergency nurses (Tam et al., 2007) . In addition, uncertainties about patients' infectious condition are extremely alarming for emergency nurses providing nursing care (Ovens et al., 2003) . However, available studies about nurses' pandemic experiences during the HSI pandemic are limited, lacking in both quantitative and qualitative research (Corley et al., 2010) . This study gathered insight from emergency nurses in Hong Kong (HK) regarding their experience and perceptions toward work during HSI outbreak. The results of this study will contribute to developing preparedness at healthcare institutions in response to future pandemics.",

The findings of this study also provide information that selfquarantine is one strategy that participants employ to minimize the transmission hazard to their family. Self-quarantine is deemed effective in limiting the spread of pathogens (Rao et al., 2009 ). However, because of the generally congested living environment in HK, household isolation measures could be unintentionally violated, thus influencing the efficacy of protecting family members against germs (Huang, 2009) .

This phenomenon could be explained by the disparity in perceptions of the severity of HSI. Frontline nurses based their judgments on HSI's lethality because of the life-saving nature of their jobs. As a result, the danger of HSI having an insignificantly high mortality rate would be viewed as unimportant. The literature also supports the view that the attention of nurses is frequently confined to their own personal health, with oversight regarding public health issues and disease prevalence (Goodwin et al., 2009 ).",

More than a tenth of the healthcare manpower was also estimated to decrease in an epidemic event because of absenteeism among healthcare professionals (Tam et al., 2007) .

Although the researcher recognized the importance of recruiting both male and female participants to ensure diversity and richness of data, there were no male nurses matching the recruitment criteria that were available for participation. The lack of male nurses in the study limits the extent to which the results can fully reveal the perceptions of the participants and achieve data saturation.",

Surges in the demand for emergency medical services during a pandemic, which can pose challenges to the availability of manpower, should be anticipated. To address increased staffing needs with limited human resources, the deployment of manpower should be decisively considered and implemented. Non-urgent healthcare services, such as elective investigations and surgeries, can be temporary curtailed or suspended. The reserved manpower can be reallocated to the emergency department to match the available supply of personnel with the public demand for emergency healthcare services.",

This study provides a rich description of the perceptions of emergency nurses in HK toward work during the HSI pandemic. The experiences of the nurses were explored, and their views were validated via critical examination and comparisons with previous research. The results of this study provide insights into enhancing the preparedness of healthcare facilities for future pandemics and facilitate evaluation of the quality of care delivered by emergency nurses. Additional research should be undertaken to expand the understanding of factors that influence the perception of nurses and the quality of nursing during pandemics.",
