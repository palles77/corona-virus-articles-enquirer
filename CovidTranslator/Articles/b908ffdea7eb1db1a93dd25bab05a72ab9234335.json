One herald strain of them, B/Shizuoka/1/ 98 was internationally registered by National Institute of Infectious Disease (NIID, Japan), Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC, USA) and World Health Organization (WHO) as a vaccine-recommended strain [1 -3]. (3) A/H3N2 subtype strains which were isolated from patients with influenzaassociated encephalopathy were detected in 78% (7/9) of the suspected patients in 1998/1999 season, and 55% (6/11) of those patients in 1999/2000 season in Shizuoka Prefecture, by using MDCK cell culture and RT-PCR methods, and rapid viral diagnostic kits (Directigen Flu A and Influenza OIA) [1-3]. Furthermore, it has been reported by national survey of influenza-associated encephalopathy in January-March, 1998-2000 that A/H3N2 and B subtype viruses were also highly detected in 90% (217/238) of the suspected patients in 1998/1999 season, and 77% (109/142) of those patients in 1999/2000 season in all Japan [1-3].",
