            "text": "The goal of this project was to better define the relationship between the endoribonuclease activity of murine hepatitis virus (MHV) Nsp15 (mNsp15) and its role in virus infection. Molecular modeling demonstrated that the catalytic residues of mNsp15 are superimposable with its severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus ortholog. Alanine substitutions at three key residues in the mNsp15 catalytic pocket (H262, H277, and G275) and a double-mutant version (H262P and H277A) generated proteins with greatly reduced but detectable endoribonuclease activities. Furthermore, these mutant proteins demonstrated lower cleavage specificities for uridylate than wild-type (WT) mNsp15. These mutations were successfully incorporated into viruses named vH262A, vH277A, vG275A, and vH262P\u0609H277A. All four mutant viruses formed plaques with diameters similar to that of MHV-A59 1000 (WT virus) on several different cell lines. Interestingly, viruses with a mutation at a noncatalytic residue, D324A, could not be recovered despite repeated attempts, and expression of mNsp15 containing the D324A mutation in Escherichia coli resulted in an insoluble protein. Plaques derived from vH262A produced approximately 6-to 13-fold fewer PFU than those from WT virus. Cells infected with mNsp15 mutant viruses accumulated lesser amounts of plus-and minus-sense subgenomic RNAs and spike protein than WT virus. The expression of mNsp15 in trans by transient transfection partially restored RNA synthesis by vH262A. These results demonstrate that mNsp15 is required for optimal infection by MHV.",

In addition, the viral genome encodes a number of proteins that are not typically found in the positive-strand RNA viruses, including a potential RNA primase and several RNA-processing enzymes such as ExoN, XendoU, and cap methyltransferases (20, (24) (25) (26) 32) .",

A thorough analysis of mutations in the ortholog of NendoU in the arterivirus equine arteritis virus (EAV) revealed that the endoribonuclease exerts significant and pleiotropic effects on EAV replication (19) . Several mutations, including mutations in the putative active site (H2693 and H2978), reduced viral plaque formation significantly but did not abolish EAV infection in cultured cells. Other mutations, including D3014A, which corresponds to the D6408A mutation in HCoV-229E Nsp15, were lethal to EAV replication and abolished EAV infection. The complex phenotypes conferred by the mutant viruses suggest that Nsp15 may have more than one role in the replicative cycles of coronaviruses and their relatives.",

Moreover, the RNA cis-acting elements, such as the 3\u0408 untranslated region (3\u0408 UTR) and stem-loops in the 5\u0408 UTR, of SARS-CoV can functionally substitute for their counterparts in MHV-A59, confirming a close phylogenetic relationship between SARS-CoV and MHV (8, 13, 14) .

To gain insight into the mechanism of RNA cleavage used by the MHV protein (mNsp15), we modeled the active site of mNsp15 complexed with 3\u0408-UMP by using the coordinates from the crystal structure of mNsp15 (PDB ID 2H85) and the molecular docking program Dock 6.0 (17) . The best model has UMP oriented so that the hydrogen-bonding face of uracil is contacted by T321 of mNsp15 (Fig. 1A) . The putative catalytic histidine, H262 in mNsp15, is positioned to interact with the phosphate of the UMP (corresponding to the cognate phosphodiester in the substrate RNA), and H277 would interact with the ribose 2\u0408 hydroxyl moiety (Fig. 1A, left) . These results are consistent with the recognition of uridine by the active-site residues of sNsp15 (Fig. 1A, center) well as with the proposed cleavage mechanism that results in the formation of a 2\u0408-3\u0408 cyclic phosphodiester on the RNA product (2) . In fact, despite some differences between the amino acid residues in the two catalytic pockets, the two active sites are virtually superimposable (Fig. 1A, right) .",

To allow functional comparison of sNsp15 and mNsp15, mutants with alterations of residues H262, H277, and G275 in mNsp15 were constructed (Fig. 1B) . WT mNsp15 and the three mutant proteins with single amino acid substitutions in the catalytic pocket (H262A, G275A, H277A) were tested for their abilities to cleave an RNA substrate containing the SARS-CoV TRS for sgmRNA3 by a gel-based endoribonuclease assay. The 13-nt TRS substrate contains uridylate at the fifth position from the 5\u0408 terminus. Consistent with our previous report (10), both sNsp15 and mNsp15 were able to generate the 5-nt product expected from preferential cleavage at this uridylate, indicating specificity for uridylates (Fig. 1C) . Quantification of cleared products from several gel-based assays showed that the G275A and H277A proteins retained endoribonuclease activity at 2% and 10% (Fig. 1C) , respectively, of WT mNsp15 enzymatic activity, while cleavage by the H262A protein was at background for this assay (Fig. 1C and data not shown) . Mutations of the comparable catalytic histidines (H249A and H234A) in sNsp15 significantly reduced endoribonuclease activity (10). These results indicated that, in agreement with the modeling studies, the catalytic residues comparable to those in sNsp15 are also required for efficient endoribonuclease activity of mNsp15.",

(2) (Fig. 2A) . This assay uses one of four nucleic acid substrates, each of which contains a 5\u0408 fluorophore paired with a 3\u0408 quencher and one ribonucleotide; the remaining three nucleotides have deoxyriboses and cannot be cleaved by RNases. When cleavage takes place, the dissociation of the quenching group from the fluorophore results in fluorescence intensity that can be measured in real time. For brevity, each substrate is named by the cleavable ribonucleotide (e.g., rU denotes the substrate with a uridylate). In our standard assay performed with 0.04 M Nsp15, neither sNsp15, WT mNsp15, nor any of the mNsp15 mutant proteins could cleave rA or rG substrates (data not shown). As expected, however, both sNsp15 and mNsp15 actively cleaved rU, at rates of 44.5 and 29.6 M s \u03ea1 , respectively. With the rC substrate, the rates of hydrolysis were lower for both sNsp15 and mNsp15, although the rate was higher for mNsp15 than for sNsp15 (5.8 versus 1.8 M s \u03ea1 , respectively). The ratio of rU to rC cleavage was calculated to determine the specificity factor (SF). sNsp15 had an SF of \u03f325, while mNsp15 had an SF of \u03f33.7 (mean from six trials; range, 5 to 3). Therefore, while both enzymes preferentially cleaved uridylates, sNsp15 had higher specificity for uridylate than did mNsp15.",

The lack of cleavage by the H262A mutant in this assay could reflect an issue with the background level in the gel-based assay. To determine whether the mutations in the catalytic pocket completely abolished mNsp15 activity, we incubated twice the normal concentration of WT mNsp15 and the H262A mutant (each at 0.08 M) for the fluorescence-based assay and monitored their activities over a 400-s period. We note that Nsp15 is enzymatically active only as a hexamer (2, 10), and a change in protein concentration will affect hexamer formation. As a control, the hepatitis C virus Ns5B protein was added at 0.24 M with the rU substrate, and no increase in fluorescence was observed (data not shown). The H262A mutant did indeed release fluorescence from the rU substrate (Fig. 2B) . Further increases in the concentration of the H262A mutant resulted in even more obvious rU cleavage (data not shown). Along with the results for the G275A and H277A mutants from the gelbased assay, our data suggest that none of the three mutations in the mNsp15 catalytic pocket completely abolished the endoribonuclease activity of mNsp15.",

For this analysis, the MHV or SARS-CoV Nsp15 WT coding sequence was cloned into pCDNA3.1 under the control of the strong immediate-early cytomegalovirus promoter. We also expressed an N-terminal fusion of GFP and sNsp15 cloned into pCDNA3.1. The GFP-sNsp15 plasmid was transfected into DBT cells, and expression was detected by fluorescence microscopy (Fig. 5A) . DBT cells were transfected with either pCDNA3.1 or one of the two plasmids that express MHV or SARS-CoV Nsp15. At 30 h posttransfection, the cells were infected with either WT virus or vH262A. MHV-specific RNAs were then detected by metabolic radiolabeling of cells with 32 P i in the presence of actinomycin D (Fig. 5B) . Consis- shown represent data from three independent experiments.

As a control, expression levels of GAPDH in DBT cells were determined using mouse anti-mouse GAPDH antibodies and HRP-conjugated anti-mouse IgG antibodies. To confirm the complementation of vH262A with the mNsp15 protein in trans, titers of vH262A and WT virus were determined in DBT cells that had been transfected with vector only or with vector expressing mNsp15 or sNsp15 protein and then infected with vH262A or WT virus (Table 5) . At 24 hpi, the cells were frozen at \u03ea80\u00b0C, thawed, sonicated, and clarified; then the resultant supernatants containing either vH262A or WT virus were titered.

            "text": "Biochemical properties of MHV Nsp15. The catalytic pocket of the MHV Nsp15 protein differed in several residues from that of SARS-CoV. However, when a UMP substrate was docked into the mNsp15 active site, the similarities between mNsp15 and sNsp15 were obvious. For mNsp15, residues H262, H277, and K317 form a catalytic triad that is superimposable with the comparable residues in sNsp15. The modeling generated results that are consistent both with the substrate interaction model proposed by Ricagno et al. (21) for sNsp15, based on the well-studied RNase A catalytic triad, and with the mechanism of RNA cleavage by Nsp15 (2) . In addition, modeling with UMP shows that G275, H277, K317, T321, and T368 of mNsp15 are in close proximity. Some notable differences exist in the other side of the catalytic cleft of mNsp15 and sNsp15. First, in sNsp15, residue S293 is likely responsible for specific recognition of the uracil. In mNsp15, residue T321 would serve as the specificity-determining residue (Fig. 1A) . Second, the side chain oxygen atom of T368 in mNsp15 forms a hydrogen bond with the C-4 keto group of the UMP, while the comparable residue in sNsp15 is Leu345. Third, a ribose ring in UMP can make two additional hydrogen bond interactions with the side chain oxygen atoms of E362 in mNsp15 (at 2.5 and 2.6 \u00c5) compared to T340 in sNsp15. The close positioning of the E362 side chain to the ribose in UMP should impose some restriction on the binding orientation. Fourth, the role of the C-terminal tail appears to differ between sNsp15 and mNsp15. Residues Y342 and P343 of sNsp15 appear to form hydrophobic stacks with the uracil and should stabilize UMP binding, while K365 and V366 would take their place in mNsp15. K365 can engage in hydrophobic interactions with the substrate through its side chain carbon atoms.",

This observation was not made with the orthologs from other nidoviruses (19, 21) . At this point, we do not understand the molecular basis for this difference.

(2) and was demonstrated to possess significantly lower endoribonuclease activity than the corresponding enzymes from SARS-CoV and infectious bronchitis virus. The mNsp15 protein used in this study is more biochemically active than the previous preparations (2) . A basis for this difference is that the mNsp15 made previously contained His 6 tags at both the N and C termini, while the version in this work contained only an N-terminal His 6 tag. In the fluorescent real-time assay, we observed that the doubly tagged protein cleaved substrates at uridylates and cytidylates approximately equally well, with a specificity ratio of \u03f31 rather than the ratio of 3 found for the N-terminally tagged mNsp15 (data not shown). Since the C termini of sNsp15 and mNsp15 contribute to the formation of the active sites, we now appreciate that additional residues at the C terminus of Nsp15 could significantly affect Nsp15 endoribonuclease activity and specificity.",

Recombinant MHVs harboring either the single substitution H262A, G275A, or H277A or two mutations (H277A and H262P) in mNsp15 were infectious and produced plaques in L2, DBT, and 17CL-1 cells with a mean diameter of approximately 80% of that for MHV-A59. We had expected a greater effect of mutations in mNsp15 on MHV infectivity. However, it should be noted that reduced enzymatic activity was retained with all the mNsp15 mutant proteins ( Fig.  2C and data not shown) . Furthermore, mNsp15 with two mutations in the catalytic pocket had the least endoribonuclease activity, and vH262P\u03e9H277A produced less infectious virus than the mutants with single amino acid substitutions. We posit that the reduced endoribonuclease activity of mutant versions of Nsp15 is responsible for the reduced virus production. The observation that genomes containing the D324A substitution were nonviable further supports a claim for an essential role of Nsp15 in MHV infection; molecular modeling predicts that D324 is critical for maintaining a network of ionic bonds, and the change to alanine resulted in an insoluble protein (data not shown). In any case, the fact that mutations in Nsp15 reduced the level of infection by as much as 2 log units clearly shows that the Nsp15 endoribonuclease is needed for optimal MHV replication.",

For example, the EAV mutant virus containing a mutation (H2963A) comparable to H262A in mNsp15 produced plaques with only 20% of the diameter of WT virus plaques (19) . We note that in our experiments with MHV, similar results were observed with all of the cells tested (L2, DBT, and 17CL-1). In particular, 17CL-1 cells have been reported to produce interferon (1, 29) . Thus, mutations in mNsp15 cannot be easily distinguished by plaque morphology alone, and the reduction of mNsp15 activity did not abolish plaque formation in interferon-positive cells. Nonetheless, the widespread defect in MHV gene expression caused by mutations in mNsp15 did not allow us to determine whether mNsp15 acts on one particular process required for viral infection.",

Thus, mNsp15 forms another complementation group in MHV-A59 open reading frame 1b (23) . Based on these results, future assessments of the correlation between activities of Nsp15 could be performed by expression of Nsp15 in trans rather than by the more laborious method of making recombinant viruses. It is also of interest that sNsp15 could not complement the mNsp15 mutation in trans. We cannot completely rule out the possibility that the failure of sNsp15 to complement mNsp15 mutations is due to lower levels of expression of sNsp15 than of mNsp15. However, the higher enzymatic activity of sNsp15 relative to mNsp15 makes it unlikely that our trans-complementation results are due to lower levels of enzymatic activity in cells transfected with the sNsp15 expression plasmid. Rather, we suggest that mNsp15 may need to specifically interact with other MHV-specific molecules.",

(B) DBT cells were first transfected either with vector only or with a plasmid driving the expression of Nsp15 derived from MHV-A59 or SARS-CoV (pcD-mNsp15 or pcD-sNsp15) and then infected with vH262A or WT virus 30 h later. At 6 hpi, viral RNAs were metabolically labeled as described in Materials and Methods. The labeled viral RNAs were resolved by formaldehyde agarose gel electrophoresis and visualized by autoradiography. The identities of the MHV RNAs are given on the right.",
