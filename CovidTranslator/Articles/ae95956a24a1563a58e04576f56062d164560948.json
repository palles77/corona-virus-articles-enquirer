            "text": "Epidemiology looks at the association between adverse effects seen in humans and a selected potential 'cause' of interest, such as the use of or exposure to a chemical, disease agent, radiation, drug, or a medical device. Epidemiology is sometimes simply defined as the study of patterns of health in groups of people. Behind this deceptively simple definition lies a surprisingly diverse science, rich in concepts and methodology. For instance, the group of people might consist of only two people, such as the case of a father suffering from rheumatoid arthritis and his daughter with vertigo. In both father and daughter, the pattern of affected areas was remarkably similar, which might suggest that the distribution of joint lesions in rheumatoid arthritis is genetically determined. At the opposite extreme, studies of the geographic distribution of diseases using national mortality and cancer incidence rates have provided clues about the etiology of several diseases, such as cardiovascular disease and stomach cancer. The patterns of health studied are also wide-ranging and may include the distribution, course, and spread of disease. The term disease also has a loose definition in the context of epidemiology and might include illdefined conditions, such as organic solvent syndrome and sickbuilding syndrome, or consist of an indirect measure of impairment, such as biochemical and hematological parameters or lung function measurements.",

The epidemiologist often has to make do with historical data that have been collected for reasons that have nothing to do with epidemiology. Nevertheless, the availability of personnel records, such as lists of new employees and former employees, payrolls and work rosters, and exposure monitoring data collected for compliance purposes has enabled many epidemiological studies to be conducted in the occupational setting. Thus, the epidemiologist has no control over who is exposed to an agent, the levels at which they are exposed to the agent of interest, or the other agents to which they may be exposed. The epidemiologist has great difficulty in ascertaining what exposure has taken place and certainly has no control over lifestyle variables, such as diet and smoking.",

An epidemiological study documents the actual health experiences of human beings subjected to real-life exposures in an occupational or environmental setting. The view has been expressed that uncertainty in epidemiology studies resulting from exposure estimation may be equal to or less than the uncertainty associated with extrapolation from animals to humans. Regulatory bodies, such as the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) are starting to change their attitudes toward epidemiology and recognize that it has a role to play in the process of risk assessment. However, there is also a complementary need for epidemiologists to introduce more rigor into the conduct of their studies and introduce standards akin to the Good Laboratory Practices standards under which animal experiments are performed.",

They claim that this is because most epidemiologists have been trained as physicians and are consequently more oriented toward measuring health outcomes. It is certainly true that a modern textbook of epidemiology says very little about what the epidemiologist should do with exposure assessments. However, this is probably as much a reflection of the historical paucity of quantitative exposure information as a reflection on the background of epidemiologists. Nevertheless, it is surprising how many epidemiological studies do not contain even a basic qualitative assessment of exposure. The contrast between epidemiology and toxicology is never more marked than in the area of estimation of dose response. The toxicologist can carefully control the conditions of exposure to the agent of interest. Moreover, the toxicologist can be sure that the test animals have not come into contact with any other toxic agents. An industrial epidemiologist conducting a study of workers exposed to a hepatotoxin certainly has to control for alcohol intake and possibly for exposure to other hepatotoxins in the work and home environments. Nevertheless, it can be argued that epidemiological studies more accurately measure the effect on human health of 'real-life' exposures.",
