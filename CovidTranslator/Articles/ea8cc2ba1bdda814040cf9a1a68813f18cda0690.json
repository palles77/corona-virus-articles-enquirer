Conditions that impair disaccharide or monosaccharide absorption cause osmotic diarrhea through secretion induced by intraluminal hyperosmolarity. Disturbances associated with rapid intestinal transit simply do not allow enough time for adequate water reabsorption and thus cause diarrhea.

We were secure in treating disease after a specific pathogenic organism had been isolated. Now it is well recognized that E. coli organisms can cause diarrhea by either direct mucosal invasion or by the production of toxins. Many and perhaps most of the early enteropathogenic strains have now been shown neither to be invasive nor to produce toxin. Pathogenicity of other strains, which are untypable, is demonstrated by laboratory evidence. Sensitive laboratory techniques are now used to determine pathogenicity but are yet too expensive and time-consuming to assume a place in routine screening procedures. Invasiveness is determined by the ability of the organism to induce keratoconjunctivitis in guinea pigs or to invade cultured cells; toxigenicity, by the organism's ability to stimulate secretion in isolated rabbit ileal loops.",

It is common in the tropics and Far East and also endemic in the South (United States). The cycle begins with a rhabditiform larva discharged from the bowel into the soil, where it changes into a free-living adult, infective for man. It penetrates the skin, passes through the bloodstream into the lungs, where the adolescent female is fertilized, and then deposits eggs into the bronchial epithelium. Some larvae pass up the trachea into the pharynx and are swallowed. Females then are fertilized in the gastrointestinal tract and lay their eggs in the intestinal mucosa. Some tissue 15 hemorrhage occurs during migration and pseudotubercles and granulomas form locally. Pneumonitis develops and persists for 2-3 weeks as the larvae migrate through the lungs. As the parasites invade the bowel, they cause abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting. Later they cause a malabsorption syndrome and a protein-losing enteropathy. Marked mucosal edema may cause intestinal obstruction. The diagnosis is made extremely difficult by the small numbers of larvae that are excreted. Radiographic findings vary from normal to nonspecific inflammation of the proximal bowel. In more advanced cases there are nodular intramural defects from granulomas or effacement of the mucosal pattern due to fibrosis.

Although disaccharides are absorbed slowly in a jejunoileal gradient, the component monosaccharides glucose and galactose are rapidly transported through the cell by a sodium-activated transport system. Fructose is transported separately, probably by a nonactivated sodium system. All disaccharides can be found in the 3-month embryo except maltose 1; they reach their maximal development during fetal life. 23 Lactases develop later than the others and, therefore, the very small premature infant may enter life with a physiologic lactose intolerance. When, for some reason, a disaccharide is not absorbed and hydrolyzed within the small bowel, it remains intact within the lumen and causes an osmotic diarrhea with influx of water and electrolytes and increased intestinal transit. 24 Sugar entering the colon is fermented, as noted earlier. The low molecular weight organic acids change the stool pH from a normal of 7 or 8 in the older infant to a value of 5 or 6. A simple screening test for the presence of reducing substances uses the Clinitest tablet. One part of stool mixed with 2 parts of water is centrifuged. The tablet is added to 15 drops of supernatant and the color reaction is graded as for glucose. Values over 1 + in infants older than several weeks of age suggest sugar malabsorption. TM 2G Sucrose, however, is not a reducing sugar, therefore, the stool must be hydrolyzed with acid before testing for sucrose. Specific disaccharide tolerance tests are administered in doses of 2 gm/kg (maximum 100 gm) to the fasting child and blood samples'are drawn at'0, 15, 30, 45, 60, 90 and 120 minutes. A normal response is a rise in blood sugar of 20 mg/100 ml or more over baseline levels. An abnormal test must be followed by separate monosaccharide tests (usually glucose) to rule out glucose-galactose malabsorption. A breath test, measuring hydrogen excretion after an oral disaccharide load, is positive if hydrogen excretion increases to greater than 10 parts per million above baseline. These tests are usually adequate to diagnose disaccharidase deficiencies but in some centers disaccharidase activities are routinely assayed in small bowel biopsy specimens. Although enzyme concentrations vary within the intestine, there are rather constant ratios between the enzymes. Mattase is the predominant enzyme, with activities 3 or 4 times higher than those of sucrase and isomaltase. Lactase, the most variable enzyme, is in least concentration, measuring 1-4 times less than sucrase and isomaltase. In cases of mucosal injury, lactase is the first enzyme affected. 22 ",

In view of the increased incidence of lymphoma in adult patients who have not maintained restricted diets, it is essential that the diagnosis not be overlooked and that proper life-time dietary therapy be initiated. Most estimates cite the incidence of celiac disease at about 1:3,000. Inheritance is likely effected through a dominant gene of low penetrance; parents, siblings and even twins have been affected. Eleven percent of ~'normal\" relatives of patients have had abnormal small bowel biopsy specimens. Celiac disease has been more often associated with blood types O and A and now is found to coexist in a number of patients with cystic fibrosis. It is clear that the offending agent is the gliadin fraction of gluten. Although no one enzyme deficiency has been isolated as causative, it is likely that one or more enzymes responsible for digestion of gluten are deficient and cause an accumulation of undigested toxic peptides. That the defect is genetically determined is further supported by the finding that 80-90% of adult celiac patients are positive for the histocompatibility antigen HL-A8. Local hypersensitivity is believed to be also involved in the etiology for 2 reasons: \"gliadin shock\" develops in some celiac infants when refed gluten and the disease is favorably affected by steroids.

Diarrhea and poor growth are the most frequent complaints, but occasionally constipation with the passage of infrequent, large stools is the first suggestion of disease. Regardless of the type of presentation these children develop abdominal distention and loss of subcutaneous fat. Gluteal skin hangs in folds and only the buccal fat pads give some semblance of a once well-nourished child. Characteristically, these children are irritable and anorectic. Clubbing of the terminal phalanges is present in those with long-standing disease. Of older children, 86% have fingerprint changes consisting of ridge atrophy. Criteria for diagnosis are presence of steatorrhea, a conclusive small bowel biopsy during gluten ingestion and clinical and laboratory response to a gluten-free diet. Since abnormal morphologic appearance can also be noted in milk and gluten allergy, purists demand that the disease be further documented by reversion to normal of the biopsy during dietary restriction and later rebiopsy after gluten challenge. The degree of steatorrhea is variable and, because of anorexia, it is essential that fat intake be measured during the quantitative fat studies. Fecal fat levels in children with celiac disease range between 4 and 26 gm/day, as compared to 3.5 gm/day or less in the child under 2 years of age and 5 gm/day in older children and adults. Serum carotene and folate levels are decreased and xylose absorption is impaired. Nearly one third of the patients are hypoproteinemic and many have low calcium, magnesium and iron levels.",

Onset of diarrhea is typically between 8 months and 3 years of age, when the child passes 3-10 loose, mucoid stools per day. Sigmoidoscopic examination shows a pale, edematous rectal mucosa; an increase in goblet cells is noted in the rectal biopsy sample. 74 Adult members of the family often have irritable bowel and there may be an early history of colic. There is no associated malabsorption and growth and development are unaffected by diarrhea. Improvement sometimes followed treatment with diiodohydroxyquin but this drug is now disapproved for use in children because of the complication of optic atrophy.",

During evaluation of absorption and with administration of a 50-gm fat diet, diarrhea subsided. The authors conclude that this diarrhea is often iatrogenically produced (particularly by the use of low-fat diets for the prevention of atherosclerosis) and atribute it to a lack of dietary fat which plays a role in delaying gastric emptying and slowing intestinal transit. Although many of their patients had been drinking hyperosmolar carbohydrate beverages, restriction of these alone did not control the diarrhea.",

Most diarrheas in infants and young children are due to the postgastroenteritis syndrome, chronic infection or infestation, and/or gastrointestinal allergy. More unusual are celiac disease, cystic fibrosis, immune deficiency and irritable bowel. In older children, chronic diarrhea is far less common; in these cases, inflammatory bowel disease, late-onset lactose intolerance and irritable bowel syndrome must be considered as the most common causes of diarrhea. Endocrine abnormalities, celiac disease and occasionally parasitic infestation are less frequent causes.A number of screening tests may be easily obtained to provide direction for other diagnostic studies.1. Visual examination of the stool. This is paramount in the order of tests because, often, what appears like diarrhea to a 47 mother is in fact a perfectly normal stool. Stool consistency, degree of mucus and color are helpful. Certainly, once examined, steatorrheal stools are well-remembered and unmistakable. The pale, putty-like stools of biliary atresia are similarly unique. Mucoid stools suggest colonic irritation from infection or allergy whereas those which are frothy suggest a disaccharide intolerance and watery stools indicate a secretory problem. Blood in the stools suggests infection, allergy or inflammatory bowel disease. Oil droplets occur primarily in cases of pancreatic insufficiency.",

If there is any question, the test should be repeated after the patient has been on a meat-free diet for several days.5. Urinalysis and culture. The name of this test is self-explanatory: a number of infants have chronic diarrhea in association with urinary tract infections that have to be identified.6. Blood studies. Fat malabsorption is evaluated by serum carotene and cholesterol levels; protein malabsorption is assessed by serum albumin and globulin levels; and small bowel absorption, by serum folate. Complete blood count test with erythrocyte sedimentation rate is performed. Serum quantitative immunoglobulin studies are performed in all patients with diarrhea.7. Growth curves. An integral part of the initial visit is the determination of the child's height and weight from birth, in order to detect a sudden deviation from normal that can indicate the onset of malabsorptive disease.8. Sweat chloride determination. All patients with chronic diarrhea for which no definite cause has been determined should have this test.At the end of this evaluation we should at least have some direction if a diagnosis has not been made. Low serum carotene and folate levels suggest intestinal disease, whereas low carotene and normal folate values point to the pancreas or biliary tract as sites of disturbance.If absorptive studies are normal and examination of the stools has been nonrevelatory but there is a strong suggestion of allergy, we prefer to place the patient on a restricted diet and reevaluate the response after 2 weeks. If there is no improvement, patients are hospitalized for further studies consisting of small 43 bowel biopsy and aspirate of jejunal secretions for anaerobic culture, immunoglobulin levels, bile acids and parasite examination. Endocrine studies are also obtained at this point, as well as quantitative stool fat and nitrogen.If there are indications of malabsorption, a similar approach is undertaken. If small bowel studies are normal, pancreatic function is examined by a secretin-pancreozymin test.Children with a secretory type of diarrhea are examined for catecholamine and VIP production and tests of ileal function (Schilling test and bile acid measurements in the stool) are carried out.At some point in the diagnostic evaluation of patients with persistent diarrhea, radiologic examination of the colon and of the upper gastrointestinal tract and small bowel is performed to rule out partial obstructive lesions as well as to identify patterns of malabsorption. Sigmoidoscopy and rectal biopsy studies are performed early in those with evidence of occult or gross blood in the stool but later in those in whom no lesion has been identified.",
