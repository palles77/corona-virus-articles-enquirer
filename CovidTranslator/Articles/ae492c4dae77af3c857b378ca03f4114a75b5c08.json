Further, their association with enteric disease has in many cases yet to be clearly established.

However, recently it, was shown that in Australia serum antibody levels to one of the types of uncharacterised human enteric CVLP appeared to follow the observed excretion rates of the particles in the different populations tested.

Other differences have been apparent in the usuaIly larger size and much greater pleomorphism of the CVLPs [14] , and our results are also in keeping with this. Members of the recently proposed torovirus group [3, 23] appear to differ from the CVLPs in these morphological properties as well.",

The use of such a sensitive detection system as silver staining and the fact that a direct or total staining method was used could also have contributed to the multiplicity of polypeptide bands observed. This being particularly pertinent if the CVLPs were enveloped viruses, as many such viruses are known to pick up small amounts of host polypeptides during assembly, and extra bands may be visible on their polypeptide profiles if a sensitive direct staining method was used. Proteolysis, in conjunction with the use of the sensitive silver stain, and the use of sensitive direct staining rather than radiolabelting, could also at least partly account for the larger than expected number of bands on the HRCV 229E polypeptide profile. In the case of the CVLPs the use of Western blotting and immunotabelling should be of assistance in sorting out at least some of the many polypeptide components.",
