The multi-type branching process has been used previously to describe biological phenomena, such as the evolution of polynucleotides 2 , cell proliferation 3 , the dynamics of viral quasispecies 4 , and the evolution of drug resistance and immune escape 5,6 . The advantage of the multi-type branching formulation is that the an expression for the probability of emergence can be easily derived.",
