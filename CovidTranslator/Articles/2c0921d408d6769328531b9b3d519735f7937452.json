From the perspective of case detection, the reasons for the inconsistency between the case fatality ratio reported in our Article 1 and data that have become available since publication of our Article 1 were clearly clarified in advance in the comment by Chen Wang and colleagues. 2 Patients with the most severe symptoms were paid attention to during the early stages of the outbreak because of limited resources to detect severe acute respiratory syndrome corona virus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. From the perspective of treatment, even the most up-to-date case fatality ratio is expected to decrease as diagnosis and treatment procedure for patients with pneumonia who are infected with SARS-CoV-2 is improving, 3 potential drugs to treat COVID-19 are being evaluated for efficacy and safety in ongoing clinical trials, 4, 5 and management is becoming more intense, not only for patients with severe infection but also for those with moderate, mild, or even asymptomatic infection.",
