No cerebellum atrophy was disclosed on necropsy. General cerebellar anatomy was normal, including the thickness of the cortical layers, myelination, and neurons of the deep cerebellar nuclei. In the ataxic cat vermis, Purkinje cells were lacking along broad parasagittal bands symmetrically disposed relative to the midline. Many Purkinje cells were also lacking in the hemispheres. The nodulus and the flocculus were normal. Surviving Purkinje cells had frequent main dendrite swellings visible with anti-calbindin and anti-microtubule associated protein. In affected regions, calbindin and phosphorylated neurofilaments immunesera stained numerous axonal torpedoes located in the granular layer and the folial white matter. They were also present in processes of the deep cerebellar nuclei and lateral vestibular nucleus. Loss of synaptic endings onto the neurons of these nuclei was evident. Hypertrophied Purkinje cell recurrent axons and enhanced retrograde synaptic endings were present in the granular layer. Bergmann glia was strongly labeled by anti-GFAP, but no abnormal supplementary fibers were seen. None of these alterations were present in the normal sister. However, abnormal vacuolation of the Purkinje cell main dendrites was evident in all three cats, but not in six unrelated control cats that were 3-6 months old. The inferior olive and pontine nuclei were also normal. The two ataxic cats had a primary Purkinje cell degeneration that shared many common features with the abnormal Purkinje cells of the nervous mutant mouse.",

            "text": "Congenital ataxia in cats, characterized by early and stable cerebellar symptoms, has been related to fetal or neonatal infection by the feline panleukopenia virus [4, 7] . Recently, two early-onset cortical cerebellar degenerations (CCD) have been described in cats; they were characterized by prominent Purkinje cell degeneration, moderate granule cell number decrease, moderate inferior olive degeneration, and normal pontine nuclei. One of these entities was autosomic recessive [1, 6] , and the other [22] was of unknown origin. Prominent Purkinje cell decay was reported in three kittens from the United Kingdom [24] . In the latter cases, changes in the medullary nuclei were also noted. A neuroaxonal dystrophy that involved lateral cuneate and olivary nuclei, as well as the dorsal tegmentum beside the cerebellar cortex, has also been reported in kittens [3, 25] . This paper reports on pure cortical cerebellar degeneration involving the Purkinje cells only, occurring in two of three kittens from the same litter. Ataxia was visible as soon as they began to walk. The third cat of the litter, albeit clinically normal, displayed mild Purkinje cell modifications as compared with controls. The pathological features in these cats were original as they involved the Purkinje cell only. They share many similarities with the pathological features of the nervous mouse.",

General examination was unremarkable, and blood tests for feline coronavirus antibodies and feline leukemia virus antigen were negative. Cat 1 had a normal gait, whereas cats 2 and 3 exhibited mild cerebellar signs characterized by intention tremors and limb hypermetria. Signs were more obvious in cat 3. Cat 3 underwent head MRI imaging that was normal. Notably, the size of the cerebellum was similar to that of a healthy, age-matched control. At the owners' request, the three kittens were euthanized, and partial necropsy was allowed. Cat 1 was used as a control, as well as six other kittens, 3-6 months of age, which were euthanized for untreatable neurological signs.

In the two mutants, the number of calbindin-positive fibers running between the neurons in these nuclei was ex- tremely decreased, and many spheroids were visualized by calbindin (Fig. 2f) and RT97 immunesera. Almost no calbindin-positive synapses were visible on the neuron surface (Fig. 2f) . The drop in this synaptic covering was much more dramatic than expected from the Purkinje cell loss.",

Purkinje cells of these mutants acquire normal synapses with afferent and efferent neurons but fail to survive, leaving empty baskets as a track of their previous presence [20] . Among these mice, the \"nervous\" mutant [17] shares many features with our cats from a neuropathological point of view. Indeed, in the young nervous mice, preferential death of vermis Purkinje cells occurs along longitudinal strips, symmetrical relative to the midline [23] . Degeneration is more prominent in the hemispheres [17] , and affected Purkinje cells have axonal torpedoes [16, 20] . Regions of preferentially surviving Purkinje cells include the nodulus and the flocculus [23] . Dendritic modifications are also mild, with swellings and slight abnormalities at the branching points [2, 16] . Recurrent collaterals are only occasionally encountered in nervous mice [16] , and increased density and staining of basket cells terminals are present [2] . In cats as in mice, symmetrical parasagittal stripes of Purkinje cells are characterized by differential protein expressions [18] . A resulting difference of sensitivity to abiotrophic processes has been proposed in mice [23] and could similarly exist in cats.",
