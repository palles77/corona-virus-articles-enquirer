            "text": "The Mad1-Mad2 heterodimer is the catalytic hub of the spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC), which controls mitosis through assembly of a multi-subunit anaphase inhibitor, the mitotic checkpoint complex (MCC) [1, 2] . Mad1-Mad2 first catalyzes MCC assembly at interphase nuclear pores [3] , then migrates to kinetochores at nuclear envelope breakdown (NEBD) and resumes MCC assembly until bipolar spindle attachment is complete [1, 2] . There is significant debate about the factor(s) involved in targeting Mad1-Mad2 to kinetochores in higher eukaryotes [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] . Through gene editing and livecell imaging, we found that the human Rod-Zw10-Zwilch (RZZ) complex is dispensable for cell viability and initial recruitment of Mad1-Mad2 to kinetochores at NEBD, but then becomes necessary to tether Mad1-Mad2 at kinetochores and sustain SAC arrest in cells challenged with spindle poisons. We also show that RZZ forms the mesh-like fibrous corona, a structural expansion of the outer kinetochore important for timely chromosome congression [10-13] once Mps1 phosphorylates the N-terminus of Rod.",

To interrogate RZZ function with maximum penetrance, we used AAV (adeno-associated virus)-and CRISPR-mediated gene editing to target the KNTC1 (Rod) locus in HCT116 cells, a diploid colorectal cell line ( Fig. S1A-C) . The resulting KNTC1 HF/-(hypomorph-flox) cells expressed Rod at ~20% of the wildtype level ( Fig. 1A -B and S1D) and exited mitosis prematurely when microtubule polymerization (nocodazole, 99 \u00b1 6 min s.e.m.) or Eg5-dependent spindle bipolarity (S-trityl-L-cysteine (STLC), 193 \u00b1 9 min s.e.m.) were inhibited, whereas wildtype cells never exited mitosis during the 16-hour timelapse (Fig. 1A-B) . To determine if complete loss of the RZZ complex is compatible with clonogenic survival, KNTC1 HF/cells were transduced with an adenovirus expressing Cre recombinase (AdCre) and subjected to limiting dilution.",

Consistently, KNTC1-null cells rapidly exited mitosis when the SAC kinase Mps1 was inhibited with reversine ( Fig. 2A) . To monitor mitotic chromosome dynamics and SAC signaling, we expressed and imaged H2B-mCherry and FLAP-Mad1 using spinning disk confocal microscopy. At NEBD Mad1 immediately localized at nascent kinetochores, then dissociated as chromosomes congressed at the metaphase plate ( Fig. 2B ; n=10 cells). Congression was less efficient in KNTC-null cells, consistent with the lack of Spindly and dynein at kinetochores ( [17] and Fig. S2 ), with small numbers of Mad1positive chromosomes temporarily at the spindle poles ( Fig. 2C; n=14 cells) .

Kinetochore expansion is thought to accelerate mitotic 'search and capture' by promoting lateral microtubule attachment [10] and to enhance SAC signaling [11] . RZZ is closely related to endomembrane coatomers that form oligomeric lattices [18, 19] and has been suggested as a \"building block\" of the corona itself [17, 20] . Consistently two other corona-associated proteins (CENP-E [21] and CENP-F [22] ) also failed to form crescents in KNTC1 -/cells (Fig. 3A) . To obtain definitive evidence, we performed correlative light-electron microscopy in cells that also express CENP-A-GFP as a centromere marker. Serial sectioning revealed circumferential expansion of trilaminar plates and fibrous material in wildtype cells (n=14 kinetochores), whereas the kinetochores of KNTC1 -/cells appeared as compact discs (n=15; Fig. 3B and Fig. S3 ).",

Thus far the only post-translational modification known to be required for crescent formation is Cterminal farnesylation of Spindly, which enables its kinetochore recruitment via interaction with Rod's beta-propeller domain [17, 20, 24] . In contrast Rod 2A recruited Spindly normally (Fig. 3E) . Despite recruiting less Mad1 to kinetochores, Rod 2A sustained mitotic arrest in nocodazole as effectively as Rod WT (Fig. 3F ).

To address this issue we expressed mCherry-Mis12-Mad1 [26, 27] from a doxycycline-inducible promoter in cells undergoing acute deletion of KNTC1 (Fig. 4A) , so that Mad1-Mad2 was tethered to kinetochores in an RZZ-independent manner (Fig. 4B ). This caused a longer arrest in KNTC1-null cells (1138 \u00b1 428 min) than wildtype cells (791 \u00b1 285 min; Fig. 4C ), potentially due to the lack of dynein-mediated stripping of SAC mediators from metaphase kinetochores [28] [29] [30] . To eliminate this effect and evaluate the SAC response to unattached kinetochores, we repeated these experiments in the presence of nocodazole and found no significant difference between KNTC1-null and wildtype cells (Fig. 4C) . Thus, Mad1-Mad2 tethering is sufficient to explain how RZZ extends the timeframe of SAC surveillance and mitotic arrest by a factor of 10.",

Thereafter end-on microtubule attachments reverse this phosphorylation, in part through counteracting PP2A-B56 phosphatases [23] , thus reinhibiting Spindly-RZZ and facilitating kinetochore compaction.

For transient expression, sequences were ordered as overlapping 60-nt oligonucleotides, annealed and extended into a 100-bp duplex using Pfusion DNA polymerase, and cloned into an AflII-digested gRNA expression vector (Addgene 41824) by Gibson assembly. Equal amounts of human codon-optimized Cas9 (Addgene 41815) and sgRNA vectors were transfected into HCT116 cells using FuGene 6 and into RPE cells using a Nucleofector 2b device (Lonza). For stable expression, target sequences were ordered as 24-nt oligonucleotides with asymmetric 5' overhangs, phosphorylated with T4 polynucleotide kinase, then annealed and cloned into BsmBIdigested lentiGuide-puro (Addgene 52963) or pLenti-sgRNA (Addgene 71409) using T4 DNA ligase. Lentiviral transduction was performed as described above. Gene deletion was initiated by inducing a doxycycline-regulated Cas9 transgene present in the host cell line",
