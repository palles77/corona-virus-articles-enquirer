The cell surface membrane serves as the selective permeability barrier which supports the nonequilibrium distribution of solutes necessary for the maintenance of homeostasis. The plasmalemma also possesses the elements which endow a cell with the capacity to converse with its environment. It is now widely accepted that the membrane's protein components deserve most of the credit for these manifold capabilities. As is discussed throughout this volume, it is channel, pump, and cotransport proteins embedded in the cell surface lipid bilayer which control the composition of the intracellular milieu. Plasma-lemma1 receptor and transducer proteins allow the cell to recognize and respond to various external influences. Membrane-associated proteins anchor cells to their substrata and mediate their integration into tissues. These examples suggest that many of the properties of a given cell type may be attributed to the protein composition of its plasma membrane (Guidotti, 1986) . It is not surprising, therefore, that most cells go to great lengths to control the nature and distribution of polypeptides which populate their plasmalemmas.",

As is true for almost any polypeptide, cells carefully regulate the expression of genes encoding plasma membrane proteins (Darnell, 1982) . Transcriptional regulation probably accounts for most of the individuality associated with the cell surface membrane. The extent to which the plasmalemmal constituents of two cells differ from one another probably reflects the idiosyncracies of their respective genetic programs more than any other single influence. Posttranscriptional control of synthesis may also play a role in defining the composition of the plasma membrane. Recent evidence from a number of systems suggests that the cell may not diligently apply itself to translating each and every mRNA as soon as it is transcribed. Mechanisms exist through which messenger RNAs (especially those specifying secretory and membrane proteins) can be warehoused in the cytosol until the proteins which they encode are called for (Walter and Blobel, 1981b; Walter, 1988, 1989) .",

Autoradiographic experiments at the electron microscopic level revealed that, on completion of their synthesis, the zymogens of pancreatic exocrine cells are first associated with the rough endoplasmic reticulum (RER). Several minutes later, the newly synthesized polypeptides are transported, via vesicular carriers, to the Golgi complex. The newly synthesized proteins are delivered to the cis-most (i.e., ER-facing) stack of the Golgi and subsequently progress through each stack to the terminal or trans-most cisterna. Condensation of the secretory proteins begins in the trans Golgi stack and continues as the zymogens pass through condensing vacuoles to secretory granules, where they remain until they are discharged from the cell in response to a secretagogue. Although aspects of this pathway reflect specializations unique to endocrine and exocrine secretory cells, in general outline it has proved applicable to virtually any type of animal cell. Furthermore (and most importantly for this discussion), the pathway delineated in these studies is also pursued by newly synthesized membrane proteins (Bergmann and Singer, 1983) .",

Thus, the postsynthetic maturation of secretory and membrane proteins is temporally and spatially compartmentalized. The reactions which occur in each organelle build on those which were carried out at the previous station. Furthermore, the processing steps associated with a given locus are frequently absolute prerequisites for the further processing events which will occur in subsequent locations. With regard to these features, the posttranslational course pursued by membrane and secretory proteins is analogous to an assembly line. Like an assembly line, the process is carried out vectorially and in strict series. There is no evidence for skipping or repeating steps under normal circumstances. The flux of proteins from the ER to the cell surface is, for the most part, unidirectional (Palade, 1975;  Rothman, 1987) . Each step of the process is also endowed with some capacity for quality control. The cell can monitor the degree to which processing steps have been successfully completed and, if it is not satisfied, it can activate mechanisms to detain or destroy those proteins which it judges to be imperfect (Lippincott-Schwartz, 1988) .",

            "text": "It is now generally accepted that the vast majority of animal cell membrane and secretory proteins are inserted into or across the membrane of the RER cotranslationally (Walter and Lingappa, 1986) . Ribosomes translating secretory or membrane proteins become bound to the cytoplasmic surface of the ER. The polypeptide emerging from the bound ribosome enters and traverses the ER membrane as it is elongated (Blobel and Dobberstein, 1975) . When translation is complete, the protein is released from the ribosome and the ribosome is released from the RER membrane. In the case of secretory proteins, release from the ribosome results in the discharge of the polypeptide across the membrane and into the lumen of the RER. Transmembrane proteins are released in what will presumably be their final topology, with endodomains facing the cytosol, ectodomains exposed at the lumenal face of the RER, and membrane-spanning domains embedded in the lipid bilayer (Blobel, 1980) . Proteins destined for cotranslational insertion into or across the RER generally carry within their primary structure a contiguous stretch of -15 amino acids which is required to initiate the membrane interaction. These \"signal sequences\" tend to be fairly hydrophobic and are most commonly located at a protein's amino terminus (von Heijne, 1985) . Upon emerging from the ribosome, the signal sequence interacts specifically with a cytosolic complex of proteins and RNA called signal recognition particle (SRP) (Walter and Blobel, 1981a,b; Walter et al., 1981) . The interaction with SRP serves two purposes. Evidence from in uitro studies indicates that association with SRP often causes a temporary translation arrest (Walter and Blobel, 1981b; Wolin and Walter, 1989) . The nascent polypeptide remains bound to the polysome, but elongation ceases. The bound SRP also acts as a guide which directs a polysome to the membrane of the RER. Targeting of the SRP-polysome complex to the RER requires the intercession of the SRP receptor or docking protein, a heterodimeric transmembrane component of the RER which acts as a receptor for SRT-bearing polysomes (Meyer et al., 1982; Gilmore et al., 1982a,b) . Interestingly, one of the polypeptides of the SRP receptor shares a region of homology with one of the protein components of SRP itself, prompting the speculation that this domain corresponds to a signal sequence binding site (Bernstein er al., 1989; Romisch er al., 1989) .",

Another transmembrane component of the RER appears to bind the signal sequence after its release from SRP (Weidmann et al., 1987) . Discharge of SRP from the ribosome requires GTP, which appears to interact with the docking protein (Connolly and Gilmore, 1989; Hoffman and Gilmore, 1988) and perhaps with the 54-kDa subunit of SRP itself (Bernstein et al., 1989; Romisch et al., 1989) . On release of SRP, the translation block is relieved and synthesis of the nascent polypeptide continues in association with the (as yet poorly understood) machinery responsible for actually translocating elongating polypeptides across the ER membrane (Krieg et al., 1989) . This translocation is not driven by translation and seems to require energy in the form of hydrolyzable nucleotides (Perara et al., 1986; Chen and Tai, 1987; Hoffman and Gilmore, 1988) . By halting translation until a free docking protein site on the RER is encountered, SRP may prevent secretory and membrane proteins from being completely synthesized and discharged into the cytosol. If no translocation sites on the RER are available, SRP may serve to route the translation complex into what might be characterized as a holding pattern. Resumption of active translation is predicated upon the translocation machinery signaling its readiness to process one of those waiting in line.",

            "text": "It must be pointed out that the pathway described above, although elegant, is not all encompassing. A large number of deviations from this model have been documented. Most dramatic of these, perhaps, is the situation which prevails for proteins inserted into the membranes of mitochondria and chloroplasts. It is now clear that these polypeptides are synthesized in their entirety in the cytosol (Attardi and Schatz, 1988 ; Schmidt and Mishkind, 1986) . Following completion of their translation, they undergo signal sequence-mediated import into or across the relevant membrane. Posttranslational membrane insertion has also been demonstrated in yeast and bacteria (Hansen et al., 1986; Waters and Blobel, 1986; Rothblatt and Meyer, 1986; Wickner, 1988) . The situation in yeast is especially interesting, since these organisms possess an endomembranous system which is extremely similar to that found in higher eukaryotes. Yeast secretory and membrane proteins can be synthesized on free, cytoplasmic ribosomes and discharged into the cytoplasm as soluble proteins. In order to retain the ability to be inserted into or across the membrane of the ER, however, these newly synthesized polypeptides must associate with members of a class of cytosolic proteins which serve to prevent them from folding into their final conformations. In bacteria the GroEL family of proteins serves this purpose (Hemingson et al., 1988) , whereas in yeast the hsc70 complex mediates this function (Deshaies et al., 1988; Chirico et al., 1988) . These \"chaperonins,\" which are related to the heat-shock family, serve a function somewhat analogous to that of SRP. Their associations with newly synthesized proteins maintain the competence of these polypeptides for membrane insertion until this opera-tion can be accomplished. Dissociation of the unfolded protein from the chaperonin is energy dependent (Rothman, 1989) .",

It is now apparent that the hydrophobic membrane-spanning sequences which anchor proteins in the bilayer can also serve as their \"start\" or \"stop\" transfer sequences (Yost et al., 1983; Rothman et al., 1988) . A large number (perhaps even the majority) of membrane proteins have no amino-terminal signal peptide. This is especially true of polytopic proteins, that is, those which span the bilayer several times.

The component parts of the translocation machinery are just beginning to be identified (Krieg et al., 1989) and the biophysical parameters governing the insertion of a protein into or through a lipid bilayer remain mysterious (Engelman and Steitz, 1981) . Furthermore, exceptions to this general rule continue to surface. Of special relevance to the topics discussed in this volume is the case of the erythrocyte glucose transporter. Recent evidence from in vitro translation experiments indicates that this protein, which spans the bilayer as many as 12 times, can be synthesized in its entirety on free cytosolic ribosomes and inserted into microsomes derived from the RER posttranslationally (Mueckler and Lodish, 1986) . This behavior, although apparently commonplace in yeast and bacteria, is unprecedented among the plasmalem-ma1 proteins of higher eukaryotes. It is not yet clear whether the glucose transporter is actually intercalated posttranslationally in vivo. The degree to which a chaperonin (related to the bacterial GroEL or yeast hsc70 class of proteins) might participate in this posttranslational insertion has also not been investigated. This is at least a possibility, since members of the chaperonin family have been shown to be present in the cytoplasm of mammalian cells. For instance, hsc70 is present in the cytoplasm of animal cells, where it is known to mediate the uncoating of clathrin-coated vesicles (Chappell et al., 1986) . The prevalence of the glucose transporter's renegade conduct-among other transporters or other membrane proteins in general-needs to be further investigated. Independent of its applicability, however, the example of the glucose transporter echoes a theme which has recurred several times during the preceding discussion: that the initial step in the biosynthesis of a plasma membrane protein is complex and offers the cell several options for variation and regulation.",

Although the purposes served by the addition of sugar groups to proteins remain rather mysterious, the mechanics of their addition are well worked out. The sugar structure characteristic of Nlinked glycosylation is a branched tree containing (among other sugar types) nine mannose residues and an N-acetylglucosamine at its stem (Lennarz, 1987) . While it is being preassembled in the ER, the sugar structure is attached to the membrane through a linkage between its initial N-acetylglucosamine residue and a molecule of dolichol phosphate lipid. The completed sugar tree is transfered en bloc from the dolichol lipid to lumenally disposed asparagine acceptor sites on nascent polypeptides. Addition of the sugar occurs while the proteins are still in the process of being cotranslationally inserted into and across the bilayer. Sugars are added only to those asparagine residues which appear in the appropriate context, that is, as part of the sequence Asn-X-Ser or Asn-X-Thr. In many proteins, only a subset of those asparagines appearing in this configuration actually get glycosylated. The basis for this selectivity is not fully understood.",

As was suggested above, an interaction with BiP may facilitate the folding of ER inserted proteins. BiP binding is apparently reversible and, at least in uitro, can be terminated through an interaction with ATP. The BiP polypeptide is itself retained in the ER by virtue of its four carboxy-terminal amino acids, whose sequence is KDEL (Munro and Pelham, 1987) . It has been shown that proteins bearing this sequence at their carboxy termini are retained in the ER through an interaction with a recently identified lumenally disposed receptor (Vaux et al., 1990) .

Studies in which the subunit polypeptides are expressed individually in fibroblasts (Takeyasu et al., 1987 (Takeyasu et al., , 1988 or in Xenopus oocytes (Geering et af., 1989; Caplan, 1990) suggest that the a-subunit cannot leave the ER unless it is appropriately complexed with a p-subunit. These observations are especially interesting in light of the potential mechanism they offer the cell for regulating cell surface Na/K+-ATPase levels. It has recently been shown, for example, that in chick myocytes the a-subunit is produced in excess of the p polypeptide (Taormino and Fambrough, 1990) . Those a-subunits unable to assemble remain in the ER and are probably degraded through mechanisms similar to those discussed above. Conditions which induce the cell to increase its complement of cell surface sodium pump result in an increase in the transcription of only the mRNA encoding the p-subunit. The resultant increase in the quantity of newly synthesized p-subunit polypeptide in the membrane of the RER allows more heterodimer to assemble and more Na+/K+-ATPase to be delivered to the cell surface.",

Recent evidence suggests that at least some aspects of the sodium pump's catalytic activity may be initiated during this early postsynthetic period (Caplan et af., 1990; Geering et af., 1987) . Ouabain is a specific inhibitor of the Na+/K+-ATPase, which achieves its inhibition by binding to the sodium pump's a-subunit. Ouabain binds with greatest affinity to only one of the conformations through which the Na+/K+-ATPase passes during the course of its enzymatic cycle (Forbush, 1983) . In uitro, the sodium pump can be driven into this conformation in two ways, one of which requires enzymatic hydrolysis of ATP and one of which does not. Experiments employing the photoactivatible NAB derivative of ouabain and anti-ouabain antibodies were performed on cultured kidney cells which had been briefly pulse labeled with (\"S]methionine (Caplan et af., 1990) . It was found that, immediately upon completion of the pulse period, newly synthesized radiolabeled Na+/K+-ATPase was capable of binding ouabain under the ATP-independent conditions. Ouabain binding requiring ATP hydrolysis, however, was not observed until the newly synthesized sodium pumps were at least 10 min old. Results from other studies suggest that the newly synthesized sodium pump still resides in the ER at this early time point (Tamkun and Fam-brough, 1986 ). These observations suggest that the sodium pump may undergo some form of activation or conformational maturation during its passage through the ER. Similar conclusions have been generated in studies using controlled proteolysis to examine the conformational repertoire of the newly synthesized sodium pump (Geering et al., 1987) . The nature of this putative activation step remains to be elucidated. It is also not clear whether other ion pumps or, more generally, other plasma membrane enzymes undergo some manner of activation during the course of their postsynthetic processing in the ER. It is interesting to speculate, however, that intracellular activation might play a role in regulating the cell's plasmalemmal levels of functional Na+/K+-ATPase.",

Morphological evidence suggests that budding occurs from the transitional elements, specialized smooth subdomains of the RER which are closely apposed to the cis-most cisterna of a Golgi complex (Jamieson and Palade, 1967a) . The vesicles appear to be coated with some matrix which is morphologically and immunologically distinct from clathrin (Orci et al., 1986; Pfeffer and Rothman, 1987) . Delivery of proteins to the Golgi can be reversibly blocked by incubating cells at 16\u00b0C (Saraste et al., 1986) . The formation of the vesicles and their subsequent targeting to the Golgi appears to be a complex, multistage process which has recently become susceptible to in uitro analysis. By examining the processing of newly synthesized membrane proteins in permeabilized cells, investigators have been able to define some of the soluble, cytosolic components which are necessary for the maintenance of ER to Golgi vesicular traffic. Once the vesicles have budded, GTP is required to activate them for the fusion step with the Golgi acceptor (Beckers and Balch, 1989; Beckers et al., 1989) . A cytosolic protein called NSF (N-ethylmaleimide sensitive factor) is also required at this stage. A cytosolic calcium concentration in the range of 0.1 pM appears to be critically required for fusion of the vesicular camer with the cis Golgi stack.",

It is interesting to note, however, that GTP and NSF may be common elements in all of the subsequent vesicular transport events involved in carrying proteins to the plasmalemma. NSF has been isolated and found to be identical with an NEM-sensitive protein necessary for the movement of vesicles between succesive Golgi stacks (Beckers et al., 1989; Malhorta et al., 1988) . GTP and small, ras-like GTP-binding proteins appear to be involved in each stage of the secretory pathway (Bourne, 1988) , as is discussed below. It is rather aesthetically pleasing to consider that the cell might exploit similar mechanisms to accomplish the transport of vesicular carriers between the numerous organelles in the secretory pathway. The mechanical aspects of budding and fusing vesicles are probably quite similar whether these operations are occurring in the ER or in the Golgi. It would not be surprising, therefore, if a considerable amount of the cellular machinery which has evolved to solve these problems in one setting were to be brought to bear in another. The extent to which this generalized machinery exists remains to established, as do the identities of components which could endow specificity to each pathway served by this putative general scheme.",

The idea that membrane delivered from the ER to Golgi must be retrieved arises from steady-state considerations and from the observation that the biochemical compositions of the ER and Golgi are discrete (Palade, 1975; Pfeffer and Rothman, 1987) . Although it has long been postulated, evidence for this return traffic has only recently been gathered in experiments employing brefeldin A. This drug results in a dissolution of the Golgi complex and the redistribution of its membrane protein markers to the ER (Lippincott- Doms et al., 1989) . In order to understand these observations, it has been suggested that a flux of vesicles normally carries membrane from the Golgi to the ER and that this flux is able to exclude, via some sorting process, polypeptides native to the Golgi cisternae. It is thought that brefeldin A may disturb this putative sorting process, thus allowing proteins normally associated exclusively with the Golgi membranes to enter the back-flux and thus become associated with the ER. According to this interpretation, the Golgi proteins which arrive in the ER are simply allowed to enter a pathway which normally exists in the cell and from which they are normally excluded. The validity of this assertion remains to be established. Some manifestation of the sorting mechanism which it postulates must exist, however, since newly synthesized membrane proteins pass from ER to Golgi to the cell surface, while the resident proteins of these compartments are not swept along in this flow.",

The loss of these mannose residues is accompanied by a loss of sensitivity to endoglycosidase H (Kornfeld and Kornfeld, 1985) .

Transport of proteins among Golgi stacks is accomplished by vesicles bearing a non-clathrin coat, which is presumably identical to that associated with the vesicles which mediate ER to Golgi traffic (Orci et al., 1986) . Sugar transferases add N-acetylglucosamine, galactose, and sialic acid residues in strict series, with the action of each transferase being rigorously dependent on the biosynthetic history of the oligosaccharide structure up to that point (Kornfeld and Kornfeld, 1985) . While all N-linked sugars begin with the same dolichol intermediate, the final complex oligosaccharide produced by the actions of the Golgi enzymes varies from protein to protein. Apparently, different proteins have different affinities for or susceptibilities to the individual subsets of lumenally disposed sugar transferases which they encounter as they transit the Golgi complex. Since each stage of the modification is in part determined by its predecessor, small variations in the degree of processing can produce large compositional and structural alterations in the final constellation of sugars sculpted by the Golgi processing enzymes. Once again, the function of these sugars and the role that this compositional variation plays in dictating the various properties of membrane proteins remain largely unknown.",

The enzymes responsible for the individual steps in the modification are compartmentalized, that is, restricted in their distribution to only a subset of the Golgi cisternae. Thus, the action of each enzyme occurs in a spatial and temporal sequence.

Studies on the trimeric hemagglutinin (HA) protein of the influenza virus indicate that it undergoes a \"stabilization\" of its tertiary structure during or soon after its residence in the Golgi. Copeland er al. (1986) found that influenza HA protein forms its characteristic homotrimers while still in the membranes of the RER. Biochemical analysis, however, reveals that these early trimers are not bound together as tightly as those which populate the cell surface membrane. Solubilization of the newly synthesized trimers under fairly gentle detergent conditions can lead to the dissolution of the complex, whereas the mature plasmalemmal trimers are resistant to this treatment. These investigators found that the transition from the unstable to the stable conformer occurs while the protein is passing through or out of the Golgi complex. The nature of the modification (if any) which brings about this stabilization remains unknown. It is interesting to note, however, that Skibbens er al. (1989) have found that an intramolecular disulfide bond in the HA protein is lost at roughly the same point in this protein's posttranslational processing that stabilization is achieved. It seems likely, therefore, that during its time in the Golgi (or not long thereafter) the protein modifies its folding pattern in a manner which affects both its own tertiary structure and its affinity for oligomerization.",

For example, addition of sialic acid appears to occur entirely within the confines of the TGN . Furthermore, newly synthesized proteins accumulate within the TGN when their progress to the cell surface is impeded by lowering the temperature to 20\u00b0C ( M a t h and Griffiths et al., 1985; Saraste and Kuismanen, 1984) . Most importantly for the purposes of this review, the TGN appears to be the site at which proteins bound for different subcellular compartments become segregated from one another. Biochemical and immunocytochemical experiments performed on a number of systems have revealed that polypeptides destined for different subcellular locales remain together as far as the TGN and become separated from one another within its confines Rindler et al., 1984; Orci et al., 1987; Tooze et al., 1987) .

It can be fairly well encompassed by the observation that a newly synthesized membrane protein's progress to the cell surface is marked by its saltatory passage through distinct subcellular processing stations (see Fig. 1 ). While essentially correct, however, this summation does not appropriately emphasize a critically important theme which is common to each step in this pathway. During each phase in a membrane protein's processing, it must be examined by some mechanism capable of determining whether the organelle it currently occupies is in fact its site of ultimate functional residence. Those proteins which are identified by this mechanism as belonging to the organelle in which they reside must be retained, while those deemed inappropriate must be allowed to travel to the next processing locus. In other words, the RER must be able to hold on to newly synthesized components of the RER membrane while allowing proteins destined for the Golgi and the cell surface to proceed. Similarly, each subcompartment of the Golgi must be able to recognize and retain its constituent proteins from among the traffic of newly synthesized membrane proteins which passes through them.",

The ability of transporting epithelia to mediate vectorial transport is explained by the asymmetric distribution of transport proteins among their two plasmalemmal surfaces (Schultz, 1986). Movement of a substance from one compartment to the other requires the participation of both apical and basolateral transporters working in series. The differential placement of pumps, cotransporters, and channels in the apical and basolateral plasma membranes bestows on epithelia their ability to carry out unidirectional and uphill transport. The value of this asymmetry is nicely illustrated by the principal cell of the renal collecting duct (O'Neil, 1987; Koeppen and Giebisch, 1985) . The basolateral plasma membrane of the principal cell is extremely rich in Na+/K+-ATPase. This complement of sodium pump functions to keep the cytosolic concentration of sodium low. A sodium channel in the apical membrane allows sodium to flow down its concentration gradient from the tubule lumen into the cytoplasm. Apically entering sodium is expelled from the cytoplasm via the basolateral Na+/K+-ATPase and is thus transported from the lumenal to the extracellular fluid compartment. The energy of the sodium gradient generated by the Na+/K+-ATPase is exploited to drive the energetically unfavorable resorption of sodium from the renal tubule. This scheme is critically dependent on its geometry. It only works if the sodium pump and the sodium channel are present in different membrane surfaces which are separated by relatively sodium-impermeable tight junctions. Clearly, the cell must possess some mechanisms which are capable of organizing and maintaining this geometry.",

In immunoelectron microscopic studies, Rodriguez-Boulan and Sabatini found that, prior to viral budding, the viral spike glycoproteins synthesized by infected cells accumulate in the plasma membrane domain from which budding will occur. Thus, influenza HA protein is targeted to the apical plasma membrane, where it awaits incorporation into virions. Similarly, the VSV G protein behaves as a basolateral plasma membrane protein until it becomes associated with the departing viral envelope. This observation was immensely important in that it provided investigators in the field of epithelial polarity with the first model system for membrane protein sorting whose components could be readily manipulated to suit an experimental design.",

Three experimentally distinguishable alternatives were proposed to describe the route taken by newly synthesized plasmalemmal polypeptides on their way to the cell surface (Evans, 1980) . These models can be identified as vectorial sorting, random sorting, and obligate missorting. The vectorial sorting paradigm predicts that all of the operations required to target a protein to the appropriate cell surface domain occur prior to that protein's arrival at the cell surface. According to this scheme, sorting is an intracellular process and transport of newly synthesized plasmalemmal proteins to the cell surface is vectorial in the sense that a polypeptide's first appearance at the cell surface is coincident with its arrival at the membrane domain in which it rightly belongs.",

Obligate missorting is something of a compromise between the mutally exclusive vectorial and random proposals. This model predicts that apically and basolaterally directed proteins depart the TGN together, perhaps in the same vesicular carrier, and are delivered together to one of the two plasmalemmal surfaces. The subset of proteins for which this delivery process is correct, i.e., those which arrive directly at their proper destination, are allowed to remain in place. The polypeptides which find themselves in the incorrect membrane domain as a result of the initial delivery step are retrieved by endocytosis and shuttled transcytotically to the opposite surface. In theory, the obligate misdelivery model is equally compatible with the initial membrane insertion step occurring at either the apical or the basolateral pole of the cell.

As can be seen in the figure, NABouabain had access to the newly synthesized Na+/K+-ATPase when it was added to the basolateral (B) but not the apical (A) medium compartment. Rupturing intercellular tight junctions through calcium chelation allowed apically added NAB-ouabain to interact with the newly synthesized sodium pump (EDTA +). These experiments indicate that the sodium pump does not appear, even briefly, on the apical surface prior to its amval at the basolateral plasmalemma. (From Caplan et al., 1986.) the newly synthesized Na+/K+-ATPase was assessed using a protocol similar to that described above in the experiments relating to intracellular activation of the sodium pump (Caplan et al., 1986 ) (see Fig. 3) . MDCK cells were grown on permeable filter supports in order to allow for simultaneous and independent access to both membrane surface domains. Following a brief pulse labeling with [3'S]methionine, the photo-activatable NAB derivative of ouabain was added to the apical or basolateral medium compartment. After a 90-min chase incubation in the presence of this photoaffinity reagent, bound NAB-ouabain was covalently incorporated into the Na+/K+-ATPase a-subunit through exposure to UV light. Membranes prepared from these cells were subjected to immunoprecipitation with an anti-ouabain antibody and immunoprecipitates were analyzed by gel electrophoresis followed by fluorography. If newly synthesized sodium pump appeared, even briefly, on the apical surface, then radiolabeled a-subunit would have been present in immunoprecipitates from cells exposed to apical NAB-ouabain during the chase. Analysis of the fluorographs, however, revealed that newly synthesized Na+/K+-ATPase was only accessible to NAB-ouabain when this compound was added to the basolateral medium. It was possible to conclude from these experiments that less than 5% of the newly synthesized sodium pump appeared, stably or transiently, in the apical plasma membrane.",

Their experiment took advantage of the fact that, in addition to the HA protein, the influenza viral genome encodes a transmembrane neuraminidase which is incorporated into the apical plasma membrane and subsequently into viral envelopes. As was mentioned in the previous section, sialic acid is added in the TGN Griffiths and Simons, 1986) . Furthermore, it must be noted that incubation of cells at 20\u00b0C allows newly synthesized proteins to progress only as far as the TGN ( M a t h and Saraste and Kuismanen, 1984; Griffiths et al., 1985) . Warming the cells to 37\u00b0C relieves the temperature block and allows the accumulated polypeptides to exit the TGN and proceed to the cell surface. Fuller et al., found that when VSV-infected cells were incubated at 20\"C, the G protein, which is normally multiply sialated, became hypersialated. This is not surprising, since the 20\u00b0C block traps the G protein in the compartment containing the sialyl transferase. Interestingly, however, when MDCK cells doubly infected with VSV and influenza virus were incubated at 20\u00b0C, the G protein was found to be markedly hyposialated. This observation was taken as an indication that the VSV G protein and the influenza neuraminidase had physical access to one another during their temperature-induced confinement in the TGN. This conclusion fit well with Rindler et al.'s (1984) morphological assessment that apically and basolaterally directed proteins were still intermingled at the TGN stage of their processing.",

It was noted that, in the TGN, proteins destined for packaging into regulated secretory granules were physically segregated from membrane and secretory proteins as well as from intraluminal viral particles, all of which depart the Golgi for the cell surface via the constitutive route (Orci et al., 1987; Tooze et al., 1987) . Taken together with the results discussed above, these observations suggest that sorting begins in the TGN and is completed by the time (or certainly not long after) newly synthesized polypeptides depart this final recognizable locus of the intracellular processing pathway. While the vectorial model almost certainly applies to MDCK cells, it must be noted that other epithelial cell types appear to target membrane proteins to their cell surfaces via a different sorting pathway. In cell fractionation studies, Bartles et al., (1987) followed the postsynthetic route pursued by two apical proteins in hepatocytes. They concluded that both proteins appeared in a fraction derived principally from the basolateral plasma membrane prior to being detectable in membranes cosedimenting with the apical plasmalemma. This observation suggested that these polypeptides might be targeted from the Golgi first to the basolateral surface and subsequently transcytosed to the apical side. This mode of cell surface delivery would conform to the obligate missorting model presented above. Interestingly, this route also mirrors the course followed by the polymeric immunoglobulin receptor of hepatocytes (Geuze et al., 1984; Hoppe et al., 1985) . This transmembrane protein is delivered from the Golgi to the basolateral cell surface, where it binds IgA circulating in the blood. The IgA-receptor complex is endocytosed and transported to the apical membrane, at which point the receptor's ectodomain is cleaved from its transmembrane anchor. The ectodomain fragment, referred to as secretory component, is released into the bile in association with the bound IgA.",

Analysis of immunoprecipitates from the various membrane fractions suggested that this protein complex was associated with the basolateral plasma membrane prior to arriving at the apical surface. While all of these results are extremely interesting, cell fractionation studies are always open to the criticism that difficult-to-control-for and difficult-to-measure cross-contamination may artifactually skew the results. Similar experiments in other laboratories suggest that microvillar proteins are vectorially sorted in intestinal cells (Danielsen and Cowell, 1985) .",

These experiments revealed that, while basolateral proteins were targeted vectorially in both cell systems, the behavior of apical proteins was somewhat more complicated. Apical proteins were vectorially targeted in the SK-CO-15 cells, whereas in the Caco-2 cells only a portion of the newly synthesized apical proteins were vectorially sorted and made their initial plasmalemmal appearance at the apical cell surface. The remainder were initially accessible to basolaterally added NHS-biotin and were subsequently transcytosed to the apical plasma membrane.

While a huge volume of secretory proteins is released at the basolateral membrane into the hepatic sinusoids, no proteins have been identified which are secreted directly at the apical surface into the bile canaliculi. Furthermore, studies on the default pathway associated with Caco-2 cells indicated. that the bulk of unsorted polypeptides are released basolaterally by this cell line (Hughson et al., 1989; Rindler and Traber, 1988) . Taken together, these observations suggest that the membrane protein sorting model associated with a given cell type may reflect the relative activities of its apical and basolateral secretory pathways. In hepatocytes, for example, the absence of an apical secretory pathway might reflect, or be responsible for, an absence of membranous traffic from the Golgi to the apical cell surface. Thus, apically bound proteins in hepatocytes may have no choice but to depart the TGN in basolaterally bound vesicles. The same could be said for Caco-2 cells, in which the basolaterally directed default pathway may reflect a paucity of apically directed vesicular carriers.",

Conversely, is there no direct apical secretory cargo in certain epithelial cell types precisely because there is no direct route to the apical surface? In those cells which employ obligate misdelivery of apical proteins to the basolateral surface, do the apical and basolateral proteins occupy the same vesicular carriers, or are they sorted from one another in the TGN and carried to the basolateral surface in separate, segregated shuttles? What is the endocytic sorting mechanism that allows these cells to recognize apical proteins in the basolateral surface and remove them for transort to their appropriate destination?

Experiments by a number of groups had also shown that blocking the addition of N-linked sugars to the viral spike glycoproteins [either through the action of the glycosylatin inhibitor tunicamycin (Green et al., 1981; Roth et al., 1979) or by infecting strains of MDCK cells defective in glycosylation (Green et al., 1981) ] had no effect on the sorting of these polypeptides. In light of these observations, it seems certain that the information required to specify sorting is encoded in the amino acid sequence of a polypeptide, either directly or by virtue of the tertiary structure this sequence effects. A large body of literature has now developed out of the attempts to identify, or at least narrow, the search for these sorting signals. As of this writing, it is safe to say that nothing even remotely approximating an answer is yet available, although a few general rules may be emerging. The most popular approaches in the hunt for sorting signals have involved the construction of chimeric or truncated versions of the viral spike glycoproteins, whose sorting could be analyzed in transfected cells. These experiments have produced very complex and frequently contradictory results. Since this field is rather tangled and has been reviewed fairly recently (Caplan and M a t h , 1989) , it is simply summarized here.",

The members of this fascinating class of membrane proteins, which includes within its roster alkaline phosphatase, 5'-nucleotidase, and trypanosomal surface antigens, are intially synthesized on bound polysomes as transmembrane proteins (Cross, 1987) . While still in the membrane of the RER they are cleaved from their transmembrane portion and transferred covalently to a lumenally facing glycosyl-phosphatidylinositol molecule (GPI). Two groups have tested the possibility that attachment to a GPI anchor is in itself a sufficient signal to ensure apical targeting. Brown et al. (1989) engineered a construct in which the VSV G ectodomain was joined with the lipid acceptor site of Thy-1 , a GPI-coupled lymphocyte antigen. When expressed in MDCK cells, the resultant lipid-linked G protein was sorted to the apical plasmalemma. When placental alkaline phosphatase (PLAP) was expressed in MDCK cells, this GPI-linked protein was delivered to the apical membrane. An anchor-minus form of PLAP, which lacks the lipid association, was secreted both apically and basolaterally in a roughly 2 : 1 ratio. Attachment of PLAP to the VSV G transmembrane domain and cytosolic tail resulted in a chimeric protein that was targeted basolaterally. Similar results were gathered by Lisanti et al. (1989a) . These investigators coupled the GPI-linked tail of decay-accelerating factor (DAF) to the ectodomain of herpes simplex glycoprotein D (a basolateral protein) and to human growth hormone (normally targeted for regulated secretion). Both constructs were delivered to the apical surface of transfected MDCK cells. These observations seem to support the notion that lipid attachment might serve to convey an apical sorting signal; however, it is difficult to synthesize all of these experiments into a single coherent picture.",

Remarkably, this protein retraces in these cultured kidney cells the complicted course it follows in hepatocytes . The receptor first appears at the basolateral surface, from which it is endocytosed and transported to the apical membrane. Immediately before or after its arrival at the apical surface the receptor undergoes a proteolytic cleavage which releases the secretory component into the apical media. The fact that this protein follows its rather indirect course in a cell type which normally manifests vectorial sorting has prompted the suggestion that the polymeric immunoglobulin receptor might possess hierarchical sorting signals, that is, two sorting signals whose expression is temporally or spatially determined. According to this line of thought, a basolateral sorting signal predominates during the protein's initial voyage from the TGN to the basolateral cell surface. After basolateral delivery, however, an apical signal somehow gains sway and the protein is transcytosed. Interestingly, the receptor undergoes phosphorylation on a serine residue at approximately the time that it is delivered to the basolateral surface (Larkin er al., 1986 ).",

It is certainly not immediately obvious that any single thread might unify this rather disparate collection of experimental results. There are, however, theories which can explain many, if not all, of these observations and which are, therefore, worth considering. Perhaps the most aesthetically pleasing of these invokes the concept of a default pathway for membrane proteins. As was discussed above, the default, or unsorted, pathway need not necessarily lead to both cell surfaces. One can imagine, for example, a scenario in which only incorporation into an apically directed vesicle required a special sorting interaction for membrane proteins. According to this model, any protein not specifically pulled out of the stream of newly synthesized membrane proteins flowing through the TGN would be carried by bulk flow to the basolateral surface. Were this the case, the absence of a sorting signal would in itself serve as a sorting signal, directing basolateral localization. It should be noted that a cell which manifest a basolateral default pathway for membrane proteins could still possess an apical and basolateral default pathway for secreted proteins, since soluble polypeptides might be able to gain access to the lumenal space of apically directed carriers without need of a special signal.",

Furthermore, an HA ectodomain-VSV G tail chimera would carry only an apical signal and be delivered to the apical surface, whereas a G ectodomain-HA tail chimera would bear no sorting signal and would follow the membrane protein default pathway to the basolateral plasmalemma.

Phosphorylation of a serine residue on the tail would remove that inhibition and permit expression of the apical targeting information. According to this formulation, an intact and unphosphorylated receptor would display no recognizable signal and would thus be shuttled by default to the basolateral surface. Removal of the inhibitory tail, in either a tail-minus or anchor-minus truncation, would result in the apical targeting of the remainder of the polypeptide. Altering the phosphorylation site would prevent the tail's inhibitory influence from being reversed and would condemn the mutant protein to permanent residence in the basolateral plasmalemma. It should be noted, however, that the results of experiments (described above) in which the phosphorylated serine residue is converted to an aspartate (which may preserve the negative charge) are difficult to reconcile with this model. It may be that the signals and mechanisms involved in biosynthetic sorting differ from those associated with postendocytic sorting.

A number of very elegant experiments have demonstrated that a family of receptors exists which recognize a mannose 6-phosphate residue added to the sugar structure of newly synthesized hydrolases during their passage through the Golgi (for review see Kornfeld, 1987) . On binding these enzymes, the receptors transport them from the Golgi to a prelysosomal compartment whose acidic pH induces the dissolution of the receptor-hydrolase complex. Receptors unburdened of their ligand are free to return to the Golgi and to participate in another round of sorting. Weak bases such as NH4CI elevate the pH of the prelyso-soma1 compartment and thus prevent release of the delivered enzyme. Since the complexed receptors cannot participate in further sorting, the cell's complement of available receptors is quickly exhausted and the newly synthesized hydrolases pass through the Golgi without being diverted to the lysosomal pathway. Thus, in the presence of this drug, newly synthesized lysosomal enzymes are secreted from the cell.",

Furthermore, the sorting of secretory proteins between the regulated and constitutive pathways in endocrine cells has been shown to require the participation of intracellular low-pH compartments (Kelly, 1985) . Elevation of the pH of such compartments through the addition of weak bases such as NH&I prevents sorting to the regulated pathway and results in the constitutive release of proteins which are normally stored intracellularly.

In contrast, the targeting of the newly synthesized Na+/K+-ATPase (assessed according to the protocol outlined in the text and Fig. 3) is unaffected by the presence of weak bases (b).

MDCK cells plated on a substrate but prevented from forming cell-cell contacts are unable to generate fully polarized plasmalemmal domains (Gonzalez-Mariscal et al., 1985; Nelson and Veshnock, 1987a; Vega-Salas et al., 1987a) . Conversely, MDCK cells grown in suspension but allowed to form cell-cell contacts are able to organize at least partially polarized plasma-lemma1 domains (Rodriguez-Boulan et al., 1983; Wang et al., 1990) . In MDCK cells, the initiation of cell-cell contact has been shown to induce at least two effects. The first effect is the insertion into the plasma membrane of an intracellular structure called VAC, or vacuolar apical compartment. Vega-Salas et al. (1987b) have found that in MDCK cells denied cell-cell contact, apical membrane proteins accumulate in an intracellular compartment which is morphologically distinct from the organelles of the processing pathway. These fairly large vacuolar structures are frequently endowed with microvilli, which protrude into their lumena. The formation of cell-cell contacts induces the exocytosis of these structures, resulting in the insertion of pre-formed apical membrane at the cell surface. These observations suggest that, prior to the formation of an epithelium, the uniquely epithelial apical membrane cannot be expressed at the cell surface. Membrane traffic within the individual cells of a developing epithelium, therefore, appears to be directly responsive to influences from neighboring cells.",

            "text": "The second effect which has been recognized is the assembly of the cytoskeleton. The cytosolic surface of the basolateral plasma membrane of many epithelial cells (including MDCK) is covered by a cytoskeletal meshwork whose composition is remarkably similar to that of the erythrocyte cytoskeleton (Nelson, 1989) . This web of ankyrin and fodrin (nonerythroid spectrin) appears to be bound to the membrane through interactions with trans-membrane proteins. The Na+/K+-ATPase has been shown to be one of the membrane anchors for this complex (Nelson and Veshnock, 1987b; Nelson and Hammerton, 1989; Morrow et al., 1989) , as has the cell adhesion molecule uvomorulin . In isolated MDCK cells denied cell-cell contact, the protein components of the cytoskeleton are disorganized and unassembled (Nelson and Veshnock, 1987a) . Very quickly after the initiation of cell-cell contact, however, the basolateral cytoskeleton is formed. Nelson et al. (1990) have suggested that uvomorulin, which is involved in establishing cell-cell contact, communicates this event to the cytoplasm through its interaction with the cytoskeleton. According to this model, uvomorulin aggregates at sites of cell-cell contact, which in turn leads to the assembly of the cytoskeleton in these regions. The forming cytoskeleton essentially traps those proteins, such as the sodium pump, which are capable of interacting with it, leading to the generation of a biochemically differentiated membrane domain (McNeill et al., 1990) . Evidence from detergent extraction experiments (Salas et al., 1988) suggests that interactions with an assembled, insoluble cytoskeleton may exist for both apical and basolateral proteins. While as yet unproven, this scheme offers an interesting and potentially testable explanation for the epithelial cell's capacity to generate or regenerate a polarized state on interaction with its neighbors.",

The most important mechanism for preventing this intermixing is almost certainly the tight junction. Tight junctions have been shown to serve as barriers to the two-dimensional diffusion of both lipids and proteins (Cereijido et al., 1989; van Meer, 1989; Dragsten et al., 1981) . Furthermore, disruption of tight junctions has been shown to allow randomization of epithelial plasmalemmal domains. The cytoskeleton may also play a role in preserving biochemical polarity. The involvement of the sodium pump with the cytoskeleton, for example, almost certainly curtails its mobility in the plane of the membrane (Jesaitis and Yguerabide, 1986) .",

(1983) found that basolateral proteins inserted into the apical surface (by fusing the VSV into the apical membrane) were efficiently removed and transcytosed to the basolateral plasmalemma. It seems clear, therefore, that the cell possesses mechanisms for continuously monitoring the compositions of its cell surface domains and for undertaking corrections should they be required.",

Cells go to great trouble to regulate the compositions of their plasma membranes and to organize those membranes into subdomains capable of specialized functions. The processes through which this control and organization are created are the subjects of extremely active investigation. As promised in the introduction, this review has been long on description and speculation and short on the presentation of definitive mechanisms.
