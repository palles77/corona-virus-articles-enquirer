The assay consisted of TOBVinfected epithelial cells expressing viral antigens on the cell surface and producing low amounts of interferon (IFN). Non-immune PBL were found to limit virus replication at an effector-to-target ratio of 100/1 even when effector cells were depleted of phagocytic cells. Neutralizing anti-IFN antibodies did not abrogate the effect. PBL from newborn animals were as effective as adult cells, whereas fibroepithelial cells, human and mouse lymphoid cells did not exert antiviral effects. Under similar conditions, PBL from adult animals could lyse TOEV -infected cells even in the presence of anti-IFN antibodies. However , newborn PBL were not cytotoxic . Moreover, depletion of NK cells by monoclonal antibodies plus complement did not alter the inhibitory effect. These latter observations suggest that virus multiplication-inhibition effects and cytotoxic (or NK) activities are unrelated .",

In kinetic experiments, the inhibitory effect was observed when PBL were incubated for at least 9 h with infected RPTG cells: about 45 to 55 % inhibition was observed after 9 h, as compared to 85-90 070 following 22 h of incubation (2 experiments) . The requirement of a minimal duration of incubation suggested that the decrease in virus tit res was not due to adsorption of virus particles on PBL. In fact, control experiments showed that virus titres were identical when cell-free virus suspensions were incubated in medium alone or with PBL. Since IFNa is present in supernatants of infected cells incubated with PBL (table I and fig. 1 ), and since TOBV is susceptible to IFN [18] , the viral multiplication inhibition could well be due to the IFN antiviral effect. In fact, in the presence of a dilution (11300) of anti-If'N\u00ab antiserum which neutralized more than 98 070 endogenous porcine IFN, PBL still inhibited virus multiplication (table I, expo n? 2 and 3), which implies that this inhibition was mostly independent of extracellular IFN.",

Firstly, NK cells could lyse infected cells before virus progeny was produced and therefore limit viral replication: this mechanism was proposed for herpesviruses [11, 34] . In the present report as well as in previous studies [5] , non-immune porcine PBL are shown to be cytotoxic to TOBV-infected target cells. This cytotoxicity differs from ADCC in that it requires a longer period of incubation [5, 7] . However, PBL obtained from newborn piglets have no spontaneous cytotoxicity, either against tumour target cells [8, 15] or against TOEV-infected cells ( [5] ; our present results). Since PBL from young piglets do inhibit virus multiplication in vitro, it is unlikely that TOEV multiplication inhibition could be due to NK lysis of infected cells. This assumption is further strengthened by the fact that complement-mediated lysis of PBL by MoAb 76-2-11, which abolished the porcine NK activity against K562 cells, did not alter the inhibitory effect. However, with the MoAb used, we could not characterize the precise nature of the effector cells involved in the inhibition phenomenon.",

Cell-mediated inhibition of virus replication, which could act early in the course of the infection (within 9 h of incubation) might serve to limit TOEV replication in adult animals. In newborn piglets, although mononuclear cells are active in vitro, the reduced number of circulating mononuclear cells [25] and the very low number of intestinal intraepithelial lymphocytes [9] observed during the first 3 weeks of life, along with the inability of piglet-derived PBL to lyse virusinfected cells, could account for the great susceptibility of young animals to TOEV infection.",

Des lymphocytes non immuns, mis en presence de cellules infectees, sont en mesure de limiter la multiplication virale quand ils sont utilises a un rapport effecteur sur cibles de 100 et cela, meme quand les cellules effectrices sont appauvries en cellules phagocytaires. Des anticorps anti-IFN neutralisants n'empechent pas cet effet. Les lymphocytes d'animaux nouveaux-nes sont aussi actifs que ceux des adultes, alors que des cellules fibroepitheliales et des cellules lymphoides humaines ou murines n'ont aucun effet antiviral. Dans les memes conditions, des lymphocytes provenant d'animaux adultes detruisent des cellules infectees par le virus GET, meme en presence d'anticorps anti-IFN. Cependant, puisque les lymphocytes de nouveaux-nes ne sont pas cytotoxiques et que la destruction des cellules NK par anticorps monoclonal plus complement ne modifie pas l'effet inhibiteur, il apparait que cet effet antiviral n'est pas dli aux fonctions cytotoxiques (NK) des lymphocytes.
