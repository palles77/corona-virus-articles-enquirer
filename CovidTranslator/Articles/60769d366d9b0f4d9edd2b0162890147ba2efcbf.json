Australian subgroup 2 IBVs contain sequence insertions and multiple gene deletions that have resulted in a substantial genomic divergence from international IBVs. The genomic variations present in Australian IBVs were investigated and compared to those of another group III coronavirus, turkey coronavirus (TCoV). Open reading frames (ORFs) found throughout the genome of Australian IBVs were analogous in sequence and position to TCoV ORFs, except for ORF 4b, which appeared to be translocated to a different position in the subgroup 2 strains. Subgroup 2 strains were previously reported to lack genes 3a, 3b and 5a, with some also lacking 5b. Of these, however, genes 3b and 5b were found to be present but contained various mutations that may affect transcription. In this study, it was found that subgroup 2 IBVs have undergone a more substantial genomic rearrangements than previously thought.",

Mutations and recombination at various locations throughout the IBV genome are believed to modify tissue tropism and antigenicity [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] and are the main mechanisms responsible for the evolution of new coronaviruses that infect the same, or new, host [13, 14] .",

            "text": "Historically, Australian IBV strains were typed into 9 distinct groups based on cross-neutralisation assays [15] . Australian IBV strains detected prior to the 1980's, including Australian vaccine strains, were termed 'classical' IBV strains. These strains share common features, including tropism for both kidney and respiratory tract tissue, along with limited antigenic and S1 amino acid sequence variation (between 1 and 25%) (the IBV S1 gene forms the epitope on the surface of a mature virion particle and is transcribed as part of gene S). Between 1988 and 1994, Ignjatovic et al. [16] discovered a group of IBVs that were substantially different to 'classical' IBVs. These IBVs showed tropism for the respiratory tract only, no antigenic similarity with 'classical' strains and S1 sequence variation of greater that 44% [16, 17] . These new viruses were subsequently termed 'novel' IBV strains. In 2002, another group of antigenically different IBV strains was identified in Australia [18] . These viruses evolved through recombination between 'classical' and 'novel' strains [20] . Therefore, a new naming system was adopted for Australian IBVs to accommodate these established antigenically diverse groups while at the same time allowing for future isolation of new subgroups of IBVs. This naming system defines 'classical', 'novel' and 2002 strains as Australian IBV subgroup strains 1, 2 and 3, respectively [18] .",

Gene 3 also encodes 3c, which has been identified as the structural envelope protein, E [21, 23, 24] . This typical organisation of coronavirus structural genes is also found in turkey coronaviruses (TCoVs) which are also group III coronaviruses that are genetically closely related to IBV. However, the genomic organisation of Australian subgroup 2 IBVs have been found to vary substantially from this typical gene organisation, and have been shown to be either S-X1-E-M-5b-N or S-X1-E-M-5b-N [25] , where X1 represents a section of sequence that shows no homology to sequences from previously characterised IBVs.

When present, this region is referred to as an 'intergenic region' [27, 28] and has been suggested as a site for recombination in IBV [27] . Recently, the whole genome of TCoV was sequenced for the first time in two separate studies using three different strains of TCoV [29, 30] , and two open reading frames (ORFs) (designated ORFs 4b and 4c) were discovered in this 'intergenic region' of TCoV [29] . Another ORF was also described, located between the N gene and 3'UTR, and designated '6b'. Both of these TCoV investigations compared the nucleotide sequence and location of the 4b, 4c and 6b ORFs (as designated in ref. [29] ) with those of common international IBV strains, such as Beaudette and M41, and reported similar ORFs in analogous positions in the genomes of these IBV strains, but noted functional ORFs have not yet been reported in these regions of IBV. The presence of these ORFs has not been reported in Australian IBV strains, and only one investigation has examined differences present in the 3' UTR of Australian strains [31] .",

A previous study analysing this region in subgroup 2 In this study, analysis of the genomic region between the M and N genes in strain V18/91 resulted in detection of an ORF of 105 bp, with the initiation codon 30 bp downstream of the M gene termination codon.

The identity scores between the 4b ORF of TCoV and the 4b-like ORFs in Australian IBV strains (including subgroup 2 strains) suggested a genomic similarity between these ORFs, and these results, coupled with the similarity between the hydropathicity plots of their respective predicted proteins, suggest that their products would fold similarly and therefore retain similar properties. The presence of this complete ORF in many international and most Australian IBV strains, as well as the presence of a highly conserved region within this ORF, suggests an important functional role in IBVs. Although, to date, no confirmed functional ORF has been found between the M and 5a genes in IBV or TCoV, the findings of this study, combined with the conclusions drawn by Cao et al.
