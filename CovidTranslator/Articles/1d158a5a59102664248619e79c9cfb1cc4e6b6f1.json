Major cellular sources of PGE2 and LTB4 are macrophages and neutrophils (Parker, 1984; Gerrard, 1985b) , cell-types which predominate in FIP lesions (Weiss & Scott, 1981b) . The findings in this study and in a previous study (Weiss & Scott, 1981~) of perivascular edema and infiltrating PMN and FIPVinfected macrophages around blood vessels, suggest that local mediator release plays a role in the pathogenesis of FIP lesions. Synthesis by and release of PGE2 or LTB4 (or both) by perivascular and migrating macrophages and neutrophils could (1) mediate vascular permeability changes, resulting in edema and peritoneal or pleural effusions; and (2) provide additional chemotactic stimuli for neutrophils and monocytes. Seemingly, a vicious cycle might ensue, in which these inflammatory mediators are released from infected or other cells and attract more PMN and viral target cells (viz macrophages). The migrating cells may themselves release additional mediators and also cell-damaging lysosomal enzymes and toxic metabolites of oxygen (free radicals), includ- Figure 4 Scattergram of plasma PGE2 levels and rectal temperatures in FIPV challengeexposed kittens.

The immune system, certainly, could amplify initial pathophysiologic responses to FIPV by generating circulating C-activating immune complexes (Jacobse-Geels et al., 1982) or by promoting local cell-mediated reactions and release of lymphokines and other enzymatically-active factors (Pedersen, 1985) . The release of certain C fragments, particularly C3a and C5a, can be associated with several vascular effects related previously to AA metabolitas, ie increased vascular permeability, granule enzyme release and PMN ehnatmis (Parker, 1984) . Indeed, C tiapiments can aiso he synthesized ia mrrerephages (Koj, 19@; Caltan, 19%) . Other investigators have r&c? reported early increases in serum C levels aft.er expeerimaatal FIPV infection (Jac~bse~Gwls df aL 1482). Some af the pathologic changes daseribed in this study may in fact be due to C-activation. It is likely, however, that early vascular disturbances retIect the release of multiple acute phase (AP) proteins, including AA metabolites, C fragments IL-1 and enzymes from infected macrophages or other cells. Thus, local production of AP proteins by macrophages could provide the initial host response to virus invasion.",

            "text": "A positive correlation was found in the present study between plasma LTB4 levels and temperature responses in FIPV-infected kittens. Although PGE2 or monocyte-derived IL-l has been associated with the general febrile response (Wolfe & Coceani, 1979; Cebula et al., 1979) , there are presently no reports of LTB4 involvement in the pathogenesis of fever. Apparently, the initial step in the pathogenesis of infectious fever is interaction of the pathogen with monocytes or macrophages and, subsequently, elaboration and release of endogenous pyrogen, believed to be IL-l (Cebula ef al., 1979) . Indeed, stimulated peritoneal exudate cells from cats with spontaneous FIP produce significant amounts of IL-l (Goitsuka et al., 1987) . Although IL-l may stimulate PGE2 secretion by macrophage-like cells situated in or near hypothalmic thermoregulatory centers (Stitt, 1986) ) it is not presently known whether endogenous or exogenous LTB4 is capable of mediating fever. To show this, the LTB4 might have to be inoculated directly into the cerebral vasculature, since blood levels of other molecules such as PGE2 may not reach the hypothalamus in sufficient quantities to produce fever directly (Gerrard, 198%) . The early fever in FIP could also be mediated by interferon (IFN) which, like PGE2, LTB4 or C fragments, may be released by macrophages (Stewart, 1981) . FIPV induces increased levels of circulating IFN in kittens within days after experimental infection (Weiss, unpublished data, 1987) . Apparently, the synthesis of PGE2 is enhanced by IFN, particularly during virus infections which induce IFN (Stringfellow & Brideau, 1984) . Possibly, local IFN-stimulated synthesis and release of PGE2 from brain macrophages could stimulate hypothalamic cells to generate febrile responses (Stitt, 1986) . In addition to the proinflammatory effects of PGE2, the latter may directly enhance the replication of certain viruses and also suppress in vitro cytotoxic, suppressor and natural killer cell activities (Parker, 1984; Gerrard, 1985~) . Some authors suggest that endogenous macrophage-derived PGE2 may block critical immunoregulatory and antiviral actions mediated by IFN (Stringfellow & Brideau, 1984) . If this indeed occurs, viruses like FIPV which infect and damage macrophages may enhance their survival by promoting release of biochemically-active molecules which suppress early host antiviral and protective immune responses. Future studies are needed to define the roles (and interactions) of AA metabolites, IFN and the C-system in FIP pathogenesis and immunity.",
