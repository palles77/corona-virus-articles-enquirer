The detection of MERS-CoV sub-genomic mRNAs indicates that the virus is replicative. This study examined the duration for detecting MERS-CoV sub-genomic mRNA compared with genomic RNA in diverse respiratory specimens. Methods: Upper and lower respiratory samples were obtained from 17 MERS-CoV-infected patients. MERS-CoV sub-genomic mRNA was detected by reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR) and MERS-CoV genomic RNA by real-time RT-PCR. Results: In sputum and transtracheal aspirate, sub-genomic mRNA was detected for up to 4 weeks after symptoms developed, which correlated with the detection of genomic RNA. In oropharyngeal and nasopharyngeal swab specimens, the detection of sub-genomic mRNA and genomic RNA did not correlate. Conclusions: These findings suggest that MERS-CoV does not replicate well in the upper respiratory tract.",

However, the detection of MERS-CoV RNA may overestimate the duration of shedding of replicative virus. Coronaviruses have a unique mechanism of discontinuous transcription with the synthesis of sub-genomic mRNAs (Sawicki et al., 2007) . The MERS-CoV has at least seven distinct sub-genomic mRNA species and the detection of these indicates that the virus is replicative (Woo et al., 2016) . The objectives of this study were to examine the duration for detecting MERS-CoV sub-genomic mRNA vs. genomic RNA in different respiratory specimens.",

Several studies have demonstrated that the viral titer of MERS-CoV RNA in upper respiratory tract specimens is lower than that in lower respiratory tract specimens (Oh et al., 2016; Corman et al., 2016) . In the present study, subgenomic mRNA was not detected in any of the nasopharyngeal specimens. The current guidelines recommend that isolation should continue until two consecutive upper respiratory tract specimens taken at least 24 h apart test negative by RT-PCR (WHO, 2018) . However, the present study suggests that, if possible, lower respiratory tract specimens should be used to determine the duration of isolation and that nasopharyngeal swab specimens should be avoided. This study has a few limitations. First, differences in sensitivity between the real-time RT-PCR used to detect genomic RNA and the conventional RT-PCR for sub-genomic mRNA may have affected the results. Second, RT-PCR methods for sub-genomic mRNA have not been validated elsewhere. Other methods, such as detecting live virus, should be performed to validate the methods used in this study.",
