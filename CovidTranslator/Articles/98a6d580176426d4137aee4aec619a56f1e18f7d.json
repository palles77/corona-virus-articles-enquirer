            "text": "Mannheimia haemolytica is the most important bacterial agent associated with the bovine respiratory disease complex (BRDC), which causes worldwide economic losses to the cattle industry. M. haemolytica cells initially colonize the tonsillar crypts in the upper respiratory tract of cattle, from where they can subsequently descend into the lungs to cause disease. Many bacteria exist as biofilms inside their hosts. We hypothesize that M. haemolytica colonization of cattle during its commensal state may include biofilm formation. To begin to assess this possibility, we developed an in vitro system to study biofilm formation directly on bovine respiratory epithelial cells. Using fixed primary bovine bronchial epithelial cells, we observed M. haemolytica biofilm formation after a 48 h incubation period at 37 C. Addition of mucin, the main component of mucus present in the upper respiratory tract, decreased M. haemolytica biofilm formation on bovine epithelial cells. We investigated the effects of prior viral infection of the epithelial cells on subsequent biofilm formation by M. haemolytica and found negligible effects. Utilization of this model system will provide new insights into the potential role of biofilm formation by M. haemolytica in the pathogenesis of BRDC.",

            "text": "Bovine Respiratory Disease Complex (BRDC) causes hundreds of millions of dollars per year in losses to the cattle industry (Bowland and Shewen, 2000) . The disease is associated with multiple bacterial and viral pathogens including Pasteurella multocida, Histophilus somni, Mycoplasma bovis, bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV), bovine respiratory syncytial virus (BRSV), and bovine herpes virus (BHV) (Caswell, 2014; Moore et al., 2015) . The most important bacterial species associated with BRDC is Mannheimia haemolytica, a member of the family Pasteurellaceae. M. haemolytica exists as a commensal in the upper respiratory tract of healthy cattle, from where it can descend into the lungs to cause pneumonia (Frank and Smith, 1983; Frank et al., 1993) . Previous studies have shown the ability of M. haemolytica to colonize bovine tonsils for extended periods (Frank et al., 1993) . Severe BRDC is often preceded by infection of the respiratory epithelium with viruses like BVDV-1, BRSV, BHV-1, or bovine coronavirus (Frank et al., 1993) . The mechanisms by which these viral infections predispose the host to M. haemolytica are unclear. One possibility is that viral infections alter the respiratory epithelial lining to favor bacterial colonization (Selinger et al., 1981) .",

For example, the closely related porcine respiratory pathogen Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae forms biofilms within 4 h, under static growth conditions in vitro (Tremblay et al., 2013) . The bovine respiratory pathogen H. somni can form biofilms that are thought to allow this commensal to persist on the bovine mucosa (Sandal et al., 2011; Elswaifi et al., 2012) . The EPS in H. somni biofilms was found to consist largely of polysaccharides, which contribute to persistence of the bacteria in its biofilm state during systemic infection (Elswaifi et al., 2012) . In a previous study, we showed that M. haemolytica will form biofilm on plastic in vitro, and that protein is the major constituent in the EPS (Boukahil and Czuprynski, 2015) .",

            "text": "Our model system was driven by a desire to investigate the ability of M. haemolytica to form biofilms on respiratory epithelial cells. As with other bacterial species, M. haemolytica requires 48 h to form a biofilm in vitro. This incubation period poses technical challenges associated with controlling numbers of planktonic bacterial cells and maintaining the integrity of the underlying epithelial cells. One group of investigators used a transwell membrane barrier between the biofilm being formed and the underlying epithelial cells (Tran et al., 2014) . Although this approach allowed the epithelial cells to survive, the lack of direct contact between the biofilm cells and epithelial cells offers limited insights into the likely process of biofilm formation in vivo. Other investigators have reported model systems that allow for direct contact between the bacterial and epithelial cells, however these studies used bacterial species that rapidly formed biofilms (i.e. 9 h) (Anderson et al., 2008) . Incubation beyond 12 h resulted in detachment of the underlying eukaryotic cells due to the toxicity of bacterial products in the culture system. Our model is the first to report biofilm formation directly on host cells during incubation periods of up to 72 h (See Supplementary Fig. S3 in the online version at DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vetmic.2016.11.012). To allow the underlying epithelial cells to support the growing biofilm, we gently fixed the epithelial cells with glutaraldehyde, which is reported to have limited effects on the tertiary structures of proteins (Chui and Wan, 1997) . Indeed, others have shown that the protein trypsin retains catalytic activity after being similarly treated with glutaraldehyde (Chui and Wan, 1997) . We confirmed fixation had limited effects on the epithelial cells by showing equivalent adhesion of M. haemolytica cells to fixed and living epithelial cells (Fig. 2) .",

            "text": "Our finding that mucin decreases biofilm formation is consistent with studies, which showed that mucin significantly decreased biofilm formation by Streptococcus mutans and P. aeruginosa (Haley et al., 2014; Frenkel and Ribbeck, 2015) . It has been proposed that mucin, the main glycoprotein of mucus, acts as an anti-biofouling agent that impairs pathogen colonization of epithelial cells lining the respiratory tract (Hollingsworth and Swanson, 2004; Linden et al., 2008) . We found that at mucin concentrations similar to those reported in vivo, biofilm formation was nearly eliminated (Fig. 3) . There are several possible mechanisms by which mucin protects the epithelium from bacterial colonization. Bergstrom et al. showed that mucindeficient mice had a greater commensal bacterial load in the intestinal epithelium when infected with the pathogen Citrobacter rodentium than did wildtype mice (Bergstrom et al., 2010) . Mucin prevented over-colonization of commensal and pathogenic organisms alike, by enabling cilia to sweep away the bacterial cells (Bergstrom et al., 2010) . A similar mechanism of bacterial clearance is believed to occur in the upper respiratory tract Fig. 3 . Mucin decreases M. haemolytica biofilm formation on fixed bovine respiratory epithelial cells. 10 5 CFU M. haemolytica were incubated with either mucin (0-1000 mg/ ml) or methyl cellulose (1000 mg/ml) and then added to fixed bovine respiratory epithelial cells. The plates were incubated at 37 C with 5% CO 2 for 48 h with washing every 12 h to remove planktonic cells. The resultant biofilms were stained with crystal violet and absorbance read at 595 nm. Data are the mean AE SEM from three independent experiments.*, P < 0.05 compared to control (0 mg/ml). Fig. 2 . Similar numbers of M. haemolytica bind to live and glutaraldehyde fixed epithelial cells. Bovine respiratory epithelial cells were seeded into wells of a 24 well plate and grown to confluence. One group was fixed with 0.1% glutaraldehyde for 10 min at room temperature and the other group remained unfixed. M. haemolytica (10 5 CFU/ml) in RPMI were then added to both groups and incubated at 37 C with 5% CO 2 for 2 h. Wells were washed with PBS, the adherent bacteria disrupted by vigorous scraping and pipetting, and the bacterial cells resuspended in 1 ml PBS. Bacteria were enumerated by serial dilution and plating onto blood agar plates. Data are the mean AE SEM from three independent experiments. (Thornton et al., 2008) . In humans, chronic oral disease leads to increased mucin levels, which in turn are thought to contribute to inflammation during infection (Hollingsworth and Swanson, 2004) . As infection proceeds, the resulting inflammation stimulates overproduction of mucin (Thornton et al., 2008) . Consistent with this finding, one of the characteristic signs of severe M. haemolytica respiratory infection is excess mucus emanating from the nostrils of cattle (Poulsen and McGuirk, Fig. 4 . Viral infection of BBEC does not affect M. haemolytica biofilm formation. (A) Bovine respiratory epithelial cells were first infected with either BVDV-1, BRSV, or BHV-1 and incubated until the first signs of cytopathic effects were observed. A control was included that contained uninfected epithelial cells. Images were taken at 40\u00c2 magnification. BBEC infected with BVDV (B), BRSV (C), or BHV-1 (D), were fixed and M. haemolytica suspended in RPMI added to the monolayers. The cells were incubated for 48 h at 37 C with 5% CO 2 and the resultant biofilms quantified by crystal violet staining. Data are the mean AE SEM of triplicate wells from three independent experiments. 2009). If mucin has antimicrobial properties, then the question remains as to why commensal bacteria can colonize the respiratory tract in humans and animals. This apparent paradox may be explained by evidence that mucin helps to maintain consistent levels of commensal bacteria while suppressing colonization by pathogenic bacteria (Frenkel and Ribbeck, 2015) . Because M. haemolytica is regarded as part of the microflora in the upper respiratory tract of healthy cattle, perhaps mucin allows M. haemolytica to colonize at low levels, as a commensal biofilm.",

Standard antibiotic susceptibility assays may not reflect the susceptibility of bacterial cells enmeshed in a biofilm (Olson et al., 2002) . Furthermore, bacterial cells in biofilms may have an increased mutation rate, and the close proximity of bacterial cells can facilitate transfer of antibiotic resistance, allowing resistant cells to emerge (Driffield et al., 2008) . Some research laboratories have investigated antibiotic resistance by biofilms formed on abiotic surfaces to predict antibiotic doses that are effective in vivo (Hengzhuang et al., 2011) . Here we showed that biofilm formation by M. haemolytica on epithelial cells enhanced antibiotic resistance relative to biofilm formation on polystyrene. One simple explanation for the enhanced resistance is that M. haemolytica cells in the extracellular matrix exuded by both biofilm cells and BBEC are physically shielded from the antibiotic. Hence, a greater amount of antibiotic is needed to kill these embedded bacterial cells.",

We confirm that adhesion of the bacteria cells to living and fixed epithelial cells was similar. Addition of mucin (0.5 to 1.0 mg/ml), the main glycoprotein of mucus, significantly reduced biofilm formation. Prior viral infection of the epithelial cells did not alter subsequent biofilm levels, suggesting that BRDC viruses enhance bacterial infection by other mechanisms. Finally, M. haemolytica biofilms formed on epithelial cells had greater resistance to several antibiotics than biofilms formed on polystyrene. Taken together, this model system provides a new tool for understanding the relationship of M. haemolytica with its host. ",

(A) Bovine respiratory epithelial cells grown in the wells of a 24 well plate were fixed with 0.1% glutaraldehyde, washed, and 10 5 CFU M. haemolytica (MH) in RPMI medium added to each well. Wells that contained fixed bovine respiratory epithelial cells but did not receive bacteria were used to determine background staining. The wells were then incubated at 37 C with 5% CO 2 for 48 h. Biofilm was stained with crystal violet and absorbance at 595 nm was determined. Data are the mean AE SEM of triplicate wells from three independent experiments. *, P < 0.05 compared to epithelial cells alone. (B) Fixed bovine respiratory epithelial cells without (left panel) and with (right panel) M. haemolytica biofilm were stained with Diff-Quik 1 and viewed by light microscopy (40\u00c2). Images are representative of three independent experiments. (C) Fixed epithelial cells alone (left panel) and cells supporting M. haemolytica biofilm (right panel) were imaged by scanning electron microscopy (2000\u00c2). Images are representative of those from three independent experiments that were performed.",
