If there are sufficient individual-level or cohort data, these probabilities can be further stratified according to patient age, gender, health condition, etc. [10] . The mortality ratio or probability of death should be an intrinsic property of the virus and the infected individual, depending on age, health, access to health care, etc. This intrinsic probability ought not to be directly dependent on the population-level dynamics of infected and recovered individuals. Thus, it can in principle be framed by a model for the survival probability of a single infected individual. Whether this individual infects others does not directly affect his probability of eventually dying. In section II A, we derive a model describing the probability M 1 (t) that an infected individual dies or recovers before time t. Importantly, these models incorporate the duration of infection (including an incubation period) before a patient tests positive at time t = 0.",

We also first assume that the susceptible population does not change appreciably before quarantine and set S(t) = S(0). Thus, we only need to solve for I(\u03c4, t) in Eqs. (9) and (10). We solve Eqs. (9) and (10) numerically (see the Methods section for further details) and use these numerical solutions to compute D 0,1 (t), R 0,1 (t), and N 0,1 (t) (see Fig. 3(a) and (b) ), which are then used in Eqs. (14) and CFR d (t \u2212 \u03c4 res ). To determine a realistic value of the time lag \u03c4 res , we use data on death/recovery periods of 36 tracked patients [16] and find that patients recover/die, on average, \u03c4 res = 16.5 days after first symptoms occurred. We show in Figs. 3(c) and (d) that M 1 p (t) approaches the individual mortality ratioM 1 (\u221e) \u2248 0.1 of section II A. This occurs because the model for P (\u03c4, t) and I(\u03c4, t) are equivalent and we assumed that the initial distribution of \u03c4 for both quantities are given by \u03c1(\u03c4 ; 8, 1.25). However, the population-level mortality ratios CFR d (t, \u03c4 res ) and M 0 p (t) also take into account recently infected individuals who may recover before symptoms. This difference yields different mortality ratios because newly infecteds are implicitly assumed to be detected immediately and all have \u03c4 1 = 0. Thus, the underlying infection-time distribution is not the same as that used to computeM 1 p (t) (see SI for further details). The mortality ratios CFR d (t, \u03c4 res ) and M 0 p (t) should not be used to quantify the individual mortality probability of individuals who tested positive after their incubation period.

To model quarantine effects, we set \u03b21 = 0 for t > 50. We show the mortality-ratio estimates M 0 p (t) and M 1 p (t) (see Eq. (14)) and CFR d (t, \u03c4res) (see Eqs.

However, the newly infecteds that contribute to CFR and M 0 p (t) at later times may not all be tested or may be tested at different times after they were infected. A reported/tested fraction f < 1 would not directly affect the CFRs or mortality ratios if the unreported/untested individuals die and recover in the same proportion as the tested infecteds. Undertesting will overestimate true CFR or mortality rates if the untested infecteds are less likely to die than the tested infecteds. In other words, if the untested (presumably because they were mildly or asymptomatic) population predominantly recovers instead of dying, the actual CFR and mortality ratios would be significantly lower than those based on tested individuals. If untested infecteds do not die, the asymptotic mortality of all infected individuals M 0,1 p (\u221e) \u2248 M 0,1 p (\u221e) (see the SI).

Although we have assumed that transmission occurs only after the incubation period when symptoms arise, there is evidence of asymptomatic transmission of coronavirus [26, 27] . Asymptomatic transmission can be modeled by setting \u03b2(\u03c4 ) > 0 even for \u03c4 < \u03c4 inc . An undelayed transmission in a nonquarantine scenario causes relatively more new infecteds who have not had the chance to die yet, leading to a smaller mortality ratio M 0 p (t). Within our SIR model, delaying transmission reduces the number of infected individuals and deaths at any given time but increases the measured mortality ratio M 0 p (t). Without quarantine, the asymptotic values M 0 p (\u221e) and CFR(\u221e) will also change as a result of changing the transmission latency period, as shown in the SI. With perfect quarantining, the asymptote M 0 p (\u221e) is eventually determined by a cohort that does not include new infections and is thus independent of the transmission delay.",

By rigorously defining these metrics, we are able to reveal the inherent assumptions and factors that affect their estimation. Within survival probability and SIR-type models, we explicitly illustrate how physiologically important parameters such as incubation time, death rate, cure rate, and transmissibility influence the metrics. We also discussed how statistical factors such as time of testing after infection (\u03c4 1 ) and testing ratio (f ) affect our estimates. Given the uncertainty in the testing fraction, we conclude that M 1 (t) and M 1 p (t) is best interpreted as approximately the mortality probability conditioned on being tested positive. In practice, these are probably also good estimates of mortality of patients conditioned on showing symptoms. In addition to our metrics and mathematical models, we emphasize the importance of curating individual cohort data. These data are more directly related to the probability of death M 1 (t) and are subject to the fewest confounding factors and statistical uncertainty.",

In Fig. S3(b) , we set \u03b2 1 S = 0 for t > t q to model strict quarantining after t q = 50 days. We observe no new infections after the onset of strict quarantine measures. In both cases (quarantine and no quarantine), we use \u03c1(\u03c4 ; n = 8, \u03b3 = 1.25) (see Eq. (7) in the main text) to describe the initial distribution of infection times \u03c4 . As time progresses, more of the distribution of \u03c4 moves towards smaller values until quarantine measures take effect (see Fig. S3 (c) and (d)).",

If the number of new infections decreases (e.g., due to quarantine measures), M 0 p (t) starts growing until it reaches its asymptotic value M 0 p (\u221e). Interestingly, the pre-asymptotic values of M 0 p (t) are smaller for larger infection rates \u03b2 1 (see Fig. S5(a) ). This counter-intuitive effect arises because larger values of \u03b2 1 generate relatively larger numbers of new infected which have a lower chance of dying before \u03c4 inc (see Eq. (4) in the main text). A similar effect occurs for non-delayed transmission (i.e., \u03c4 \u03b2 \u2248 0). We observe a similar effect for non-delayed transmissions (i.e., \u03c4 \u03b2 \u2248 0).
