Emerging technologies, including information and communication technologies, genomics, microelectromechanical systems, robotics, sensors, and nanotechnologies, provide enormous opportunities for population health improvement. Population health technology refers to the application of an emerging technology to improve the health of populations. Emerging technologies present an opportunity for addressing global health challenges-in both developed and developing countries. Health issues ripe for the application of new technologies include disease surveillance and control, environmental monitoring and pollution prevention, food safety, health behavior change, self-care, population screening, and chronic disease and injury prevention and control. If appropriately applied, population health technologies may greatly enhance existing health intervention models. However, potential adverse consequences could arise related to privacy, confidentiality, and security; quality and effectiveness; sustainability; and the technology divide. To ensure the optimal development and diffusion of population health technologies will require balancing these risks and benefits while simultaneously adopting new mechanisms of public and private support for research and development in this potentially important new domain of public health.

In the previous century, many technologic advances have contributed substantially to the health of individuals and communities. For example, childhood immunizations have reduced prevaccine morbidity from nine vaccine-preventable diseases in the United States by an average of 99% between 1900 and 1998, and they have virtually eliminated previously common diseases, such as diphtheria, tetanus, poliomyelitis, and smallpox. 1, 2 The incidence of many foodborne diseases, including typhoid fever, tuberculosis, and botulism, have dramatically declined primarily as a result of health-related innovations, such as pasteurization, sanitation, and home refrigeration. 3 Diseases caused by nutritional deficiencies have been virtually eliminated in many developed countries through the use of food fortification. In addition, advances in vehicle and highway design, such as energy-absorbing steering wheels, safety belts, and highway barriers, helped reduce the U.S. death rate per vehicle miles traveled by more than threefold from 1966 to 1999. 4, 5 At the beginning of the 21st century, we are at the dawn of a possibly unprecedented era of scientific discovery and promise. Emerging information and communication technologies, genomics, microelectromechanical systems, robotics, sensors, and nanotechnologies are some of the many emerging technologies that provide new opportunities for population health improvement. 6, 7 Further exploration of how such technologies can contribute to population health purposes is needed.",

The entire Encyclopaedia Britannica can be transmitted over the Internet across the United States in less than 1 second, but it could take weeks to months before a reportable disease is communicated to public health officials (estimated transmission time based on size of the Encyclopaedia Britannica being about 1 gigabyte and transmission over a 10 gigabit/second Internet2 network, such as Abilene). At a time when prototype nanotechnologies can detect the presence of diagnostic proteins and genetic material in molecular-scale quantities, most countries continue to rely on an antiquated system of crude organoleptic inspections to ensure the safety of our food supply. 8, 9 As SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) and other recent disease outbreaks illustrate, current global disease surveillance systems and the public health infrastructure are grossly inadequate in monitoring and containing public health threats. 10 In fact, technologies used by the U.S. trucking industry to monitor vehicles, optimize routing, and communicate with drivers are much more advanced than that used by public health professionals to track health problems, optimize services, and communicate. 11, 12 How Technology Can Improve Population Health Population health focuses on the multiple factorsbiological, behavioral, environmental, and social-that influence the health of groups of people. 13 A population health approach develops and implements interventions to improve the health of the entire population, not just individuals. Such interventions can be environmental, educational, organizational, social, or technologic in nature. Population health technology (PHT) is defined as the application of an emerging technology to improve the health of populations. Clearly, this definition could overlap with other concepts, but, for the purposes of this paper, public health is considered a subset of population health, and PHT as a subset of eHealth technologies. 14 Population health technology focuses on technologies that improve health on a population level rather than in an individually focused, medical care context. Thus, PHTs typically emphasize preventive, behavioral, environmental, social, and systems-oriented interventions rather than medically oriented ones. Although related terms, such as \"consumer health informatics\" and \"public health informatics\" might encompass some aspects of PHT, these terms focus primarily on information technology (IT) and, in many cases, solely on software applications (Table 1) . [15] [16] [17] Population health technology is proposed as a broader concept that includes non-ITemerging technologies. This paper highlights the opportunities and challenges posed by PHTs, and it describes a path to promote and accelerate their development and diffusion.",

Several companies have developed networked sensors that can detect acoustic signatures of gunshots. 18 Mounted on rooftops or other structures, not only can these sensors distinguish a gunshot from ambient noise (e.g., backfire from car), but they can also discern the make of the firearm. Networked together, they can triangulate the position of the firearm and the trajectory of the bullets. Within seconds, they can send emergency alerts to police and emergency services and to local residents. This type of technology could help prevent gun-related violence in distressed neighborhoods, and it also could provide essential data about the gunshot incidence that can be used by local residents to advocate for improved public safety programs and additional resources. In the near future, such networked sensor technology need not be limited to the monitoring of gunshots, fires, air pollution, or other events that might be obvious or abrupt in nature. For example, future sensor technologies could be able to detect subtle deterioration of neighborhood infrastructure, such as damage to streets, sidewalks, parks and trees, and neglected buildings.

Appropriate roles for public health professionals in the context of these emerging technologies include helping consumers elucidate their needs and priorities, translating those needs to technology developers, working with developers to pilot PHTs, evaluating the effectiveness of the technology, and engaging in policymaking processes about appropriate funding and uses of PHTs. Some technologies have already demonstrated their utility for population health. For example, geographic information systems (GIS), which integrate, analyze, and visualize data related to physical location and time, have been successfully applied in a range of population health issues, including disease surveillance and emergency planning and management, monitoring of crime and at-risk neighborhoods, and tracking environmental exposures. 19 Benefits include increased ability to link exposures to outcomes, improved program decision making and planning, and greater support for community advocacy.",

Product developers and policymakers will need to proactively balance public concerns about privacy protections with the information-sharing needs of some business models and public health programs. Policies, regulatory and otherwise, will need to keep pace with technologic innovation. For example, the rules recently promulgated under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) fail to address the substantial volume of data generated by most eHealth applications. 23 Failing a comprehensive approach, the impending proliferation of sensitive health data-and associated potential abuses-might dwarf many benefits of PHT. In addition to appropriate policies, more work is needed on methods for data collection and management to ensure that such data are used in the best interests of individuals and public health.

In these instances, the potential for unintended errors is magnified. Minimizing this risk can be achieved by integrating quality improvement and evaluation processes throughout the product development life cycle. 26 Existing approaches and tools for quality assurance of health websites could be applied to PHTs, but more robust and dynamic mechanisms also are needed. 27, 28 Research and evaluation tools for PHTs will likely be refined in the context of real-life trials. Given that many PHTs have origins in disparate scientific disciplines, research and evaluation of these technologies likely will require research teams across multiple fields. In addition, emerging technologies will stretch the limits of existing research methods that historically have been applied to more static and less robust interventions. 29 The ultimate question to be considered is \"What is the health and social impact of the intervention on the population level?\" The challenge will be to develop consensus methods and metrics around this fundamental question.",

Technology innovations typically diffuse from \"early adopters\" and others before they are widely adopted in the population. 36 The diffusion process could help refine the technology and sustainable business models. 37 Looking back, the personal computer was largely irrelevant and unaffordable to the general U.S. population in the 1980s.
