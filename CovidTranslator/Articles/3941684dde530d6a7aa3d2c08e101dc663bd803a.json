Methods: We conducted a longitudinal serological follow-up study in patients who were hospitalized with A(H7N9) virus infection, during 2013-2018. A(H7N9) virus-specific antibody responses were assessed by hemagglutination inhibition (HAI) and neutralization (NT) assays. A random intercept model was used to fit a curve to HAI antibody responses over time. HAI antibody responses were compared by clinical severity. Results: Of 67 patients with A(H7N9) virus infection, HAI antibody titers reached 40 on average 11 days after illness onset and peaked at a titer of 290 after three months, and average titers of \u226580 and \u226540 were present until 11 months and 22 months respectively. HAI antibody responses were significantly higher in patients who experienced severe disease, including respiratory failure and acute respiratory distress syndrome, compared with patients who experienced less severe illness. Conclusions: Patients with A(H7N9) virus infection who survived severe disease mounted higher antibody responses that persisted for longer periods compared with those that experienced moderate disease. Studies of convalescent plasma treatment for A(H7N9) patients should consider collection of donor plasma from survivors of severe disease between 1 and 11 months after illness onset.",

In the study by Ma et al., 2 of 25 patients did not have an HAI antibody titer \u226540 during hospitalization or after recovery. 20 Therefore, most, but not all patients with A(H7N9) virus infection who survive severe disease are able to mount detectable HAI antibody levels. The differences in peak time of HAI antibody titers between analyses of GMTs and model analysis might be due to inadequate sampling. The contacts of these virologically-confirmed cases were not investigated by serology in this study. No patient had serologic evidence of A(H7N9) virus re-infection after recovery. Epidemiological investigations of patients who survived A(H7N9) virus infections across five epidemics by our group also found no reoccurrence of A(H7N9) related-illness 1 ; re-infection of A(H7N9) virus has not been reported in other longitudinal sero-epidemiology studies. 35 , 36 Our analysis estimated that mean HAI antibody titers remained \u226540 until 22 months after illness onset. Ma et al. reported that HAI GMTs declined to lower than 40 at 10 months after illness onset. 20 However, they used a 2013 human A(H7N9) virus isolate to test serum samples from patients from the 2016-2017 epidemic, which might result in an underestimate of antibody titers. In another cross-sectional study, Ma et al. reported that HAI GMT was near 40 at about 26 months after illness onset, which was similar to our findings. 21 For the pooled analyses of antibody kinetics, data for antigens that were antigenically-matched to circulating strains are preferred. However, there might be antigen-specific differences in HAI titers, which could affect the results. We adopted two statistical approaches to investigate this question: (1) we evaluated the main effect and interactive effect of each antigen in the model and found that the effects were not statistically significant; (2) we constructed the model with the HAI results for A/Anhui/1/2013 virus only, with the same formula and knots as the model for pooled analysis (Supplementary Fig. 7 ). Before 7 months after illness onset, the trend of the average curve of the A/Anhui/1/2013 virusonly model was similar to that of the model with pooled results, and subsequently the former curve decreased slower than the later one. However, due to the lack of sera available between 14 months and 65 months after illness onset for testing in the A/Anhui/1/2013 virus-only model, we viewed the model with pooled data to be more reliable. We did not find that antigen-specific differences in HAI responses affected the model significantly, but this could be due to small sample size and additional investigations are needed when more data are available for the different antigens.",

            "text": "HPAI A(H7N9) viruses are antigenically distinct from other LPAI A(H7N9) viruses, including A/Hunan/2650/2016 and A/Anhui/1/2013, as determined by using post-infection ferret antisera. 7 Lu et al. reported that sera collected 2-3 weeks after illness onset from patients with LPAI A(H7N9) clade C1 virus infection reacted with HPAI A(H7N9) human isolates, although at lower titers than those against homologous virus. 26 Since we lacked virological data to identify the specific virus strains infecting the patients, we tested serum samples from patients from the 2016-2017 epidemic against three distinct A(H7N9) virus strains. Those patients with positive serological responses were likely infected by LPAI A(H7N9) viruses. Convalescent sera from these patients collected at 16-20 months after illness did not react with Development of neutralizing antibody responses was delayed compared to HAI antibody responses, and neutralizing antibody titers continue to increase for longer periods after recovery. Zhang et al. reported increase of neutralizing antibody response within 2 weeks from illness onset by using a pseudovirus-based neutralization assay. 34 However, results of pseudovirus-based neutralization assay might not correlate well with results of an authentic virus-based neutralization test. 41 In the study by Guo et al., no neutralizing antibodies were detected in samples collected before day 28 after illness onset, which is consistent with our findings. 31 Ma et al. also observed delayed neutralizing antibody response after infection, with GMTs increasing overtime, peaking on day 200. 20 We observed discordance in H7N9 virus HAI and neutralizing antibody responses with the HAI antibody response decreasing after a peak at 3 months while the neutralizing antibody response increased long after clinical recovery. The correlation of HAI and neutralizing antibody responses varied by A(H7N9) virus antigen, with greater correlation for the more recent A/Hong Kong/125/2017 virus compared with the older antigenically distinct A/Anhui/1/2013 virus. A(H7N9) vaccines induce comparable levels of HA-reactive IgG antibody as seasonal influenza vaccines in mice, but neutralizing titers are low, suggesting a large component of the induced antibody response is non-neutralizing 42 ; this phenomenon might be attributed to the internal genes of A(H7N9) virus. 32 Nevertheless, both neutralizing and non-neutralizing antibodies induced by A(H7N9) vaccination of humans protected mice in vivo against a stringent lethal challenge. 43 Therefore, neutralizing antibody titers may underestimate the protective effect of antibody responses following A(H7N9) virus infection. Convalescent plasma therapy has shown promise for the treatment of a variety of emerging infectious diseases, 44 including 1918 H1N1 pandemic influenza, 14 influenza A(H5N1), 17 , 18 influenza A(H1N1)pdm09, 45 and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). 46 Timely treatment of patients with severe A(H1N1)pdm09 illness with hyperimmune IV immunoglobulin (H-IVIG) reduced mortality. 47 The time-to-treatment effect requires timely availability of virus specific convalescent plasma with high antibody titers. It has been shown that implementation of a passive-immunotherapy program is logistically feasible during an influenza pandemic. 48 Kreil et al. demonstrated the feasibility of producing H-IVIG preparation at large scale relatively rapidly, which could be further improved by reducing low-titer donations. 49 , 50 To be used for convalescent plasma transfusion or H-IVIG production, a HAI antibody titer of \u226580 in donor plasma is needed, 15 and a dose of 0.5 g/kg would be needed for H-IVIG treatment. 49 Up to three plasmapheresis donations with donation of 500 ml plasma each time could produce enough plasma for the treatment of two to three patients. 15 , 51 The median duration of A(H7N9) viral shedding was 15.5 days from illness onset, 52 and nonfatal A(H7N9) patients recovered at a median of 26 days, 53 which indicates that convalescent plasma could be collected a month after illness onset. Collecting blood from survivors of severe illness from A(H7N9) virus infection at 1 to 11 months after illness onset should yield convalescent plasma with HAI antibody titer above 80, suitable for convalescent plasma therapy and H-IVIG production. Among the patients enrolled in this study, 64% (18/28) of the severely ill survivors were aged 18-65 years old, making them suitable potential blood donors for plasma therapy. 54 Another potential source of convalescent plasma is from participants in clinical trials of A(H7N9) vaccines. 55 However, since A(H7N9) viruses continue to evolve into antigenically distinct strains, regardless of the source of the plasma, it will be important to determine the levels of cross-reactive antibodies in the convalescent plasma against a patient's virus infection to understand whether treatment is likely to be beneficial. Furthermore, administration of convalescent plasma treatment for patients with A(H7N9) virus infection should ideally be done through a controlled clinical trial.",

The magnitude and kinetics of the antibody responses in patients with milder illness or asymptomatic infections might be different. Second, clinical data were not available for all patients during their hospitalization, which might impact some analyses. Third, we were not able to collect serial serum specimens from patients during hospitalization and were limited to testing remaining available sera. Survivors were not all followed up at the same designated time points. Fourth, we did not have respiratory specimens to characterize the A(H7N9) viruses that infected the patients, or to determine viral load, duration of shedding and associations with disease severity and antibody responses. Finally, the A(H7N9) patients followed up in this study may not be representative of all survivors of A(H7N9) virus infection in China; however, we included patients from 6 provinces and from 3 epidemics since 2013.",
