At the start of the 21 st century, the international community experienced a similarly frightening public health emergency, on a global scale, with the spread of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS). SARS was an unusual corona virus-based pneumonia that spread rapidly [1] . The SARS epidemic demonstrated that one effect of globalization has been to make it possible for an infectious disease to travel from one continent to another in a matter of hours, and highlighted the importance of international coordination of efforts to respond to novel outbreaks of infectious disease. It was first detected in November 2002 in China's Guangdong province, and eventually affected more than 25 countries. China was one of the most severely affected countries, and Beijing among the world's most heavily affected cities, according to the World Health Organization's summary report [2, 3] .",

The doctor and nurse groups were further stratified by level of work exposure to the SARS outbreak, according to the types of hospital units in which they had worked during the outbreak. Those who had worked in units where contact with SARS patients had been frequent and intense, such as SARS wards, fever clinics, the Department of Infectious Diseases, or the Emergency Room, were classified as having had \"high work exposure\". Doctors and nurses falling into the high work exposure category were oversampled. Hospital employees aged 35 to 55 were also oversampled. The survey's participants completed a self-report questionnaire. The response rate was 83%. Further details of its sampling and study procedures are available elsewhere [18, 21] .",

Nine of these items addressed respondents' during-outbreak perceptions of SARS-related threat: I believed that my job was putting me at great risk; I felt extra stress at work; I was afraid of falling ill with SARS; I felt I had little control over whether I would get infected or not; I thought I would be unlikely to survive if I were to get SARS; I thought about resigning because of SARS; I was afraid I would pass SARS on to others; My family and friends were worried that they might get infected through me; People avoided my family because of my work [4] .

Approximately 25% reported having worked in locations where contact with SARS patients was common, while 19% had been quarantined either at work or at home during the SARS outbreak. Nine percent of respondents reported that a friend or close relative had contracted SARS. Of the 549 hospital employees, about 77.2% had CES-D scores lower than 16, and so were considered to have a low level of depressive symptoms. About 14.0% of the hospital employees had CES-D scores between 16 and 24 and were thus considered to have moderate levels of depressive symptoms. The remaining 8.8% had CES-D scores of 25 or higher. The members of this group were considered to have high levels of depressive symptoms. Table 1 shows the characteristics of the three groups of hospital employees -those with low, moderate and high current levels of depressive symptoms. The results of the bivariate analysis (Table 1) indicate that, among the sociodemographic factors, younger age and being single were associated with higher levels of depressive symptoms in this sample. About 60% of those having high depressive symptom levels were 35 or younger, while 31% of those with CES-D scores lower than 16 were in this age range. About one third of those with high depressive symptoms were single, while only 10% of those with low CES-D score were single. With regard to the event exposure variables, both work exposure and any quarantining during the outbreak were strongly associated with current level of depressive symptoms. For example, among the group with the highest CES-D scores, 56% had worked in locations where staff had high levels of exposure to SARS patients; and nearly 60% had been quarantined; while less than a quarter of those with low CES-D scores (21.3%) had worked in high exposure locations, and only 14.9% of the low depressive symptoms group had been quarantined. Having had a relative or friend contract SARS, on the other hand, was not significantly associated with level of depressive symptoms. Exposure to other traumatic events before the SARS outbreak was significantly associated with higher levels of depressive symptoms. The respondents' perceived levels of SARS-related risk during the outbreak were also significantly and positively associated with their current levels of depressive symptoms, while altruistic acceptance of SARS-related risk was negatively associated with depressive symptom levels. Having experienced high levels of posttraumatic stress symptoms during and after the outbreak was strongly associated with current depressive symptom levels. Finally, the results also indicate that subjects who were currently working at relatively high-stress jobs also tended to report more current depressive symptoms.",

Table 2 , Part A, reports the findings from the analysis comparing those having high depressive symptom levels (CES-D scores of 25 or higher) to those having low depressive symptom levels (CES-D scores of less than 16). In Model 1, controlling for age, gender, marital status, family income, and prior exposure to other traumatic events, the effect of any quarantining remained statistically significant, with an adjusted odds ratio of 4.90 (95% CI = (2.19, 10.99), p=0.0001); high work exposure, however, had a smaller effect size here (AOR=2.22, 95% CI=(1.00, 4.92), p=0.05). Single respondents were more likely than married respondents to have high depressive symptom levels (AOR=4.35, 95% CI = (1.65, 11.42), p=0.0029). Having been exposed to other traumatic events prior to SARS was significantly associated with high depressive symptom levels (AOR=3.39, 95% CI = (1.47, 7.84), p=0.004). In Model 2, perceived risk level during the SARS outbreak and altruistic acceptance of risk were added into the regression equation. Both of these variables were found to be significantly associated, though in opposite directions, with high depressive symptom levels. Specifically, higher during-outbreak perceived SARS-related risk levels appeared to increase the odds of having a high current level of depressive symptoms (AOR=1.54, 95% CI = (1.27, 1.86), p<0.0001), while altruistic acceptance of SARS-related risk appeared to decrease those odds (AOR=0.26, 95% CI = (0.12, 0.56), p=0.0005). In the third and final model, a high PTSD symptom level was found to be significantly associated with a high depressive symptom level (AOR=7.44, 95% CI = (2.83, 19.58), p<0.0001). With regard to the other factors that had been previously identified as significant predictors, their associations with high depressive symptom levels remained essentially the same, except that the effect of high work exposure became nonsignificant in Model 2, when perceived risk and altruistic acceptance of risk were included in the equation, and remained nonsignificant in Model 3, when PTSD symptom level and the current high-stress job indicator were also included. Table 2 compares those with moderate levels of depressive symptoms (CES-D score between 16 and 24) to those with low levels of depressive symptoms (CES-D score less than 16). As expected, fewer factors were found, in this analysis, to be significantly predictive of group membership. The results from Model 1 indicate that, with the sociodemographic factors controlled for, no significant differences were found between the two groups with regard to their SARS outbreak exposures. The two perception measures, i.e., during-outbreak perceived levels of SARS-related risk and altruistic acceptance of risk, added in Model 2, each emerged as significantly predictive of group membership. The pattern of the associations found here is similar to that of the comparison between the high and low depressive symptoms groups, but the effect sizes are smaller. In Model 3, when the PTSD symptom level and current high-stress job variables were entered into the equation, PTSD symptom level was also found to be significantly associated with level of depressive symptoms (AOR = 3.58, 95 CI = (1.62, 7.92), p=0.0017). The effect of during-outbreak perceived risk remained significant in Model 3 (AOR = 1.16, 95 CI = (1.03, 1.31), p=0.0183), while the effect of altruistic acceptance of risk was slightly attenuated and of only marginal significance (p=0.0583).",

Employees' own fears of dying from the disease, and of losing family members to it, would, thus, have tended to be especially strong at the time when they were quarantined.",

Unlike in Canada, quarantining in China was often a group affair. Healthy hospital staff could be selected to be quarantined together with hospital patients, and were often required to continue working, caring for those patients, while quarantined [39] . These quarantined health care staff would have known that, even if they had not already been infected with SARS, they would, as a result of being placed in these situations, remain at high risk of eventually becoming infected, because of their continued contact with SARS patients. However, those who continued working in these settings may also have experienced the satisfaction of knowing that they continued to play an important role in society that would have been valued by many of the patients they worked with. Again unlike their Canadian counterparts, however, most of the quarantined hospital employees in our sample experienced a period of at least ten days of being unable to see or be with their families at all. (The median length of the quarantine periods was 14 days). This aspect of their quarantining may have led to especially severe distress, but its effects are difficult to measure with any precision.",

This is somewhat in contrast to the finding of our previous study of the same hospital employee population [18] , which focused on postoutbreak symptoms of PTSD. In that study, pre-SARS traumatic experience was not found to be predictive of later SARS-related PTSD symptom levels. On the surface of it, the direction of this contrast seems surprising, as traumatic experiences have frequently found to be more strongly predictive of PTSD than of depression [41] [42] [43] [44] . It must be noted, however, that the IES-R, the instrument that we used to measure PTSD symptoms, was, like most such instruments, designed to measure only PTSD symptoms associated with memories of a single specific event or set of events -in this case, the SARS outbreak. The respondents were not asked about PTSD symptoms they might currently be suffering from as a result of sudden or violent traumas experienced prior to the SARS outbreak. It should also be noted that while the SARS outbreak was indeed a highly stressful, often traumatic, and lifethreatening experience for those affected by it, the types of stressful events it engendered were somewhat different in nature from those mentioned in the instrument that was used to measure traumas suffered prior to SARS. The instrument had been adapted from one used in previous disaster research [23, 45] . The events described in the prior trauma instrument are generally sudden, noisy, and violent ones, unlike SARS, which caused harm to its victims in ways that were chronic rather than short-term, and comparatively subtle, slow, and quiet. In this sense, the stresses caused by the SARS epidemic would not be expected to be evocative of the types of stresses mentioned in the prior trauma. Thus, perhaps it is not really surprising to find that the prior trauma items were, in our sample, predictive of respondents' later depressive symptoms, but unrelated to their later symptoms of SARS-related PTSD. Some of our respondents may, unbeknownst to us, have been suffering from either clinicallevel, or subthreshold, PTSD syndromes linked to their memories of events that occurred prior to the SARS outbreak, which in turn may have been contributing to their relatively high levels of depressive symptoms. Future studies examining the psychological effects of both recent and less recent traumatic experiences should consider the similarities and differences found between various types of traumatic experiences, in designing their survey instruments.",
