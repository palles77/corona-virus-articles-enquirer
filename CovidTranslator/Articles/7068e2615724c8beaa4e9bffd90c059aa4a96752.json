The MRSA and VRE rates of the present study are in line with the nosocomial MRSA and VRE rates reported for large Canadian teaching hospitals. 16, 17 We did not find national or regional increases in nosocomial CDAD between 1999 and 2005. This may have been due to infection control efforts directed toward CDAD that resulted from the numerous deaths associated with outbreaks of the hypervirulent NAP1 strain in Quebec between 2002 and 2004. 10 Nevertheless, CDAD rates were higher in Quebec than the rest of Canada in 1999 (t 5 3.4, P 5 .001) and 2005 (t 5 4.7, P , .0001). Surveillance scores increased roughly 6%, and control scores trended up from 1999 to 2005. Despite the minor increases in surveillance and control intensity, 15% of hospitals in our 2005 sample scored less than 50 on the surveillance index, indicating that they conducted less than half of the recommended surveillance activities. Only 27% of infection control programs conducted greater than 80% of recommended surveillance activities. The findings are similar for control activities; 10% of infection control programs scored less than 50 on the control index, and only 11% scored greater than 80%.",

Physician, doctoral professionals, and secretarial support to infection control programs changed little from 1999 to 2005, whereas ICP FTEs per 100 beds increased 60% overall. However, even with increased ICP staffing, less than one quarter (22.6%) of hospitals had the recommended 1 FTE ICP per 100 beds in 2005. 18 The proportion of ICPs with CBIC certification actually decreased from 1999 to 2005. This decrease in certification levels may be due to the requirement for recently hired ICPs to practice in infection control for 2 years with a minimum of 800 hours experience before being eligible to write the CBIC certification examination (www.cbic.org). On average, ICPs had almost 2 years less experience in infection control in 2005 when compared with ICPs in 1999, reflecting recent entrants into the field.",

Increases in ICP staffing and the intensity of control activities in Quebec coincided with the CDAD outbreak in Quebec. Similarly, increases in ICP staffing and the intensity of surveillance activities in Ontario coincided with the SARS outbreak of 2003. Despite these crises-motivated influxes of resources, Canadian infection control programs in 2005 continue to fall short of expert recommendations with respect to the intensity of surveillance and control activities and infection control program human resources. [18] [19] [20] Taking into account hypervirulent C difficile strains, the predicted influenza pandemic, and increasing rates of MRSA and VRE, there continues to be great need for ongoing investment in infection control programs. [3] [4] [5] 21 If Canada is to achieve widespread control of infections in acute care hospitals, increased investments in infection control human resources are required in the form of more infection control professionals, their training, and certification with CBIC. Infection control programs also require physicians trained in infection control, surveillance tools, and support staff to mount effective control programs and to report on nosocomial infection rates. The size and scope of the ARO problem is increasing, yet there is accumulating evidence that properly designed and executed infection control programs are highly effective and cost beneficial. 21 To not continue to make these investments now is very shortsighted and suggests that we may have already forgotten the lessons we were to have learned from the outbreaks of SARS and hypervirulent C difficile.",
