A novel carbon tax attractor is achieved through the discussion of the dynamic behavior of the new system. Based on the genetic algorithm-back propagation neural network, the quantitative coefficients of the actual system are identified. The scenario analysis results show that, under the same tax rate and constraint conditions, the ESER system in YRD urban agglomerations is superior to the average case in China, in which the impacts on economic growth are almost the same. The former's energy intensity is lower and the shock resistance is stronger. It is found that economic property of YRD urban agglomerations is the main cause for the ESER system of YRD urban agglomerations being superior. In the current YRD urban agglomerations' ESER system, energy intensity cannot be adjusted to an ideal level by commercialization management and government control; however, it is under effective control of carbon tax incentives. Therefore, strengthening the economic property of YRD urban agglomerations and effective utilization of carbon tax incentives could perfectly control energy intensity, without obvious potential negative impact on economic growth.",

Carbon trading [30] and low carbon city [31] had been applied with a series of pilot projects. Finland, Sweden, on behalf of Nordic country had levied carbon tax earlier; Boulder (American state of Colorado) and Quebec (Canada) had made a good attempt at carbon tax pilot. Their experiences are worthwhile. China will fully implement carbon trading in 2017 (In China, Shenzhen launched the first carbon trading platform on 18 June 2013. Since then, Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, Guangdong, Hubei and Chongqing had carried out trials for carbon trading. The carbon trading market rules in the above provinces and cities are being in gradually perfect process). By contrast, European carbon emissions trading system (EUETS), as the largest carbon trading market in the world, no longer enjoy the past glory after the hard hit in 2013 [32] . Which will have a better effect in ESER system, carbon tax or carbon trading? The key is to find suitable measures to reduce carbon emissions according to the actual situation of the corresponding district (city) [33] . For some districts (cities), carbon tax is better suited for the development of ESER to a certain degree. In the practice process, carbon tax is bound to have an effect on economy, employment and social welfare [34] [35] [36] ; thus we need to know how much the economic areas are influenced by carbon tax, and how to cope with these conundrums. Only through spotting problems and solving them in the carbon tax pilot projects, can we avoid the failures of Australia and European (On July 2012, carbon tax implemented officially in Australia, the levy amount of carbon tax was 24 $A/co 2 . Two years later, Australia abolished carbon tax on July 2014, which aimed to lighten the burden of families and small businesses. The resolution of abolishing carbon tax aroused widespread controversy and criticism. In November 2012, European Union had to declare suspension of levying aviation carbon tax on the airlines outside the EU after the widespread objection).",

This research, based on the previous study, is to establish a Yangtze River Delta (YRD) urban agglomerations ESER system with carbon tax constraints. The novel system demonstrates the economic property of YRD urban agglomerations. Meanwhile, the commercialization management, government control and carbon tax incentives are introduced as constrained variables. The carbon tax pilot in YRD urban agglomerations and consequent influence of carbon tax are discussed. The Yangtze River Delta (YRD) urban agglomerations carbon tax pilot system is put forward for the first time from the perspective of nonlinear dynamics.

Meanwhile, they are the most promising economic blocks with the fastest developing speed and the biggest economic gross. Smooth development of the ESER system in the area will ensure better development (YRD urban agglomerations' energy is seriously inadequate and relies on the import for a long period. At present, energy shortages, PM 2.5 and the large scope haze weather have become the new normal, environmental and resource issues have become neck bottle of development in YRD urban agglomerations. ESER is pivotal to solve the problem of environmental emission and resources depletion problem, which could ensure the sustainable development of the socio-economic and ecology). Which one is more suitable for ESER, Carbon tax or carbon trading? There have been different ideas on this problem in the academic field [42, 43] . In YRD urban agglomerations, the enterprises are mainly small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs), the private economy being very active. Judging from the present condition in China, carbon trading is more effective for large The development speed of carbon emissions and economic growth may be influenced by carbon tax to a certain extent in the given period of time; but carbon tax will eventually promote the development of ESER. ESER system will be further optimized by taking the advantage of the following measures, such as applying commercialization management to the ESER system, rationally using government control and giving full play of the economic property of YRD urban agglomerations, as well as establishing proper carbon tax incentives. Carbon tax could fulfill its function in the ESER system, forming a virtuous circle. The ESER system could better develop. Based on the four-dimensional ESER system in [41] and the characteristics of YRD urban agglomerations, it is assumed that ESER, carbon emissions, economic growth and carbon tax are restrained by commercialization management, government control, the economic property of YRD urban agglomerations and carbon tax incentives respectively. The corresponding restriction conditions are assumed to be F 1 x; y; z; w; t \u00f0 \u00de ; F 2 x; y; z; w; t \u00f0 \u00de ; F 3 x; y; z; w; t \u00f0 \u00deand F 4 x; y; z; w; t \u00f0 \u00de .

The energy intensity is always smaller than that of the red curve. The energy intensity starts with a precipitous decline after the turning point. The above analyses indicate that the 4D ESER system with carbon tax constraints is superior to the 3D ESER system, in that it is easier to con-trol, and the final stable value is far smaller than the former one in 3D ESER system. The green curve has a slighter fluctuation than the blue curve, with smaller stable value. It is clear that, with the same carbon tax rate and constraint conditions, the energy intensity in YRD urban agglomerations' ESER system with carbon tax constraints has a more gentle decline than the one in the 4D ESER system with carbon tax constraints [41] . The descent speed is faster, and the stable value is smaller.

Moreover, carbon tax will take an inhibitory action on economic growth (the impact on economic growth shows inhibition in the early implementation of carbon tax) [41] . Fig. 7 shows the comparison diagram of error value of economic growth under the same carbon tax rate and constraint conditions. The diagrams in Fig. 7 are not very acute, thus the method in Fig. 6 is not adopted. Case 1 (the difference of z t \u00f0 \u00de between the 4D ESER system presented in [41] and the 3D ESER system presented in [37] ) shows the evolution diagram of economic growth's error value when the levy amount of carbon tax is 15CNY/ton-co 2 in the case of China; Case 2 (the difference of z t \u00f0 \u00de between the YRD urban agglomerations' ESER system presented in Eq. (2) and the 3D ESER system presented in [37] ) shows the corresponding diagram in YRD urban agglomerations' ESER system with carbon tax constraints under F 3 x; y; z; w; t \u00f0 \u00de . From Fig. 7 , it can be observed that levying of carbon tax has inhibitory impact on economic growth. Both the two curves are all below the zone line (red line). There is a vast difference between the blue curve and the green one in the initial stage. During this stage, because of the economic property of YRD urban agglomerations, economic growth of the green curve keeps grow, but the value drops quickly after the apex. The diagram in the rectangular area is the drawing of partial enlargement. In the elliptic region, the absolute value of slope in the second half is remarkably larger than that in the first half. The curve tends to be stable after a shortterm fluctuation, with the fluctuation time being shorter than case 1. Between elliptic region and the crossover point, the inhibitory impact on economic growth in case 2 is bigger than that in case 1. After the crossover point, the green curve is stabilized, while the blue curve still declines. The stable value of the blue curve is much smaller than that of the green curve. The above analyses indicate that YRD urban agglomerations have shown greater resilience to carbon tax than the average case of China, which has a shorter time to reach the stable value of energy intensity and error value of economic growth; and there is smaller inhibitory impact on economic growth. This also reveals the reason we choose YRD urban agglomerations to carry out carbon tax pilot in some respects.",

Fig. 8 shows the evolution curve of energy intensity when c 5 growing (see Appendix A). The red curve (Stable value 1) corresponds to the curve when c 5 \u00bc 0:2368.

(2), when the effect of F 3 x; y; z; w; t \u00f0 \u00de gets bigger, it will exert influence on z t \u00f0 \u00de. z t \u00f0 \u00de then exerts influence on x t \u00f0 \u00de; y t \u00f0 \u00de and w t \u00f0 \u00de; and reduce U t \u00f0 \u00de finally. Fig. 9 interprets the reason why the bigger F 3 x; y; z; w; t \u00f0 \u00de (c 5 ) makes smaller U t \u00f0 \u00de. It shows the error value of carbon emissions and economic growth when c 5 changing from 0.2368 to 0.2568. The blue curve is the error value of carbon emissions; the green curve is the error value of economic growth. As c 5 grows, the blue curve is lower than the red line (zone line) after a short fluctuation, with the error value of carbon emissions being negative, i.e. it has hampered the carbon emissions' growth. The green curve is higher than the red line except for a short curve below the red line in the early stage. The bigger c 5 is, the more evident the trend is, i.e. growing c 5 causes further development of the economy. In the time-dependent energy intensity formula U t \u00f0 \u00de, the numerator gets u 1 small, while the denominator u 2 gets big, and U t \u00f0 \u00de gets small. Along with the development of carbon tax, further maturation of the ESER system, transformation of development patterns and economic structure, carbon abatement cost will reach its inflection point at a certain moment. When the carbon abatement cost declines, the impact of z t \u00f0 \u00de on y t \u00f0 \u00de gets bigger, which reflects in Eq. (2) that the coefficient b 3 gets bigger. If the policy measures remain unchanged, the effect of ESER will be neutralized, even bringing a fatal shock to the ESER system. Fig. 10 shows the evolution diagram of YRD urban agglomerations and the whole China when the systems crash. The blue curve shows the energy intensity of the 4D China's ESER system in [41] when b 3 \u00bc 0:4296; the ESER system will be broken fall when b 3 P 0:4296. In the YRD urban agglomerations' ESER system, the system will be broken fall after a brief fluctuation when b 3 P 0:7515. To make it more clearly, let b 3 \u00bc 0:7815, the green curve shows its energy intensity when b 3 \u00bc 0:7815. Comparative observations of the two curves indicate that collapse point 2 is later than collapse point 1, i.e. the collapse time of the green curve is later than that of the blue curve. The value of b 3 in YRD urban agglomerations' ESER system is actually bigger than b 3 in the whole China's ESER system in [41] (0:7815 > 0:4296). The foregoing analyses show that, compared with the 4D China's ESER system, the YRD urban agglomerations' ESER system is more stable, with stronger capacity to resist concussion.",

            "text": "Comparative observations confirm that the fluctuation of energy intensity becomes lighter when a 5 gets bigger (the time of reaching stable value gets shorter; the space between the peak value and stable value gets smaller), the stable value showing a slightly rise. Results demonstrate that, in the current YRD urban agglomerations ESER system with carbon tax constraints, commercialization management can control energy intensity to the stable value quickly; but it cannot fully meet the requirement of reducing energy intensity. The reason could be explained commendably by Fig. 12. Fig. 12 describes the error value of carbon emissions and economic growth when a 5 changing from 0.001 to 0.0015 (the error is very small, but it can still reflect the evolution trend). The blue curve is the error value of carbon emissions; the green curve is the error value of economic growth. Commercialization management checks the trend of over-rapid carbon emissions growth (the blue curve is slightly higher than the red line after stabilization), which has the inhibition effect on economic growth at the same time. The effect is greater than the one on carbon emissions, i.e. the green curve is always under the red line after an infinitesimal fluctuation at the primary stage. The economic property of YRD urban agglomerations, market maturity and civilization degree are among the causes. Therefore, commercialization management does not suit the current YRD urban agglomerations ESER system. Government control can often control energy intensity quickly, which is demonstrated in the late ''12th Five-Year plan\". However, government control has inhibition effect on economic growth during the progress of reducing energy intensity. F 2 x; y; z; w; t \u00f0 \u00derepresents government control in the system presented in Eq. (2) . When the strength of government control gets bigger, a very interesting phenomenon arises as shown in Fig. 13 , the evolution diagram of energy intensity when b 5 gets bigger (in the system presented in Eq. (2), a 5 \u00bc 0; d 2 \u00bc 0). The red curve (Stable value 1) is the same as the red curve in Fig. 11 ; the blue curve (Stable value 2) corresponds to the curve when b 5 \u00bc 0:0213 and the green curve (Stable value 3) b 5 \u00bc 0:0413. Energy intensity could be better controlled with government's control work. The peak value decreases rapidly and the fluctuation gets slighter. The blue and green curve are all lower than the red curve before the junction point; while the green curve is bigger than the red curve after the junction point. It is identified that government control could stabilize energy intensity, and an appropriate strength of government control will bring lower energy intensity. Nevertheless, when the strength is above a critical value, the final control effect would be counterproductive, i.e. the green curve has exceeded the value of the case without government control at junction point. Why the stable value of energy intensity increases as the control strength getting bigger? This is due to the inhibition effect on economic growth surpassing the effect of reducing energy intensity. Fig. 14 presents the error value diagram of carbon emissions and economic growth when b 5 changing from 0.0213 to 0.0413. The blue curve is the error value diagram of carbon emissions; the green curve is the error value diagram of economic growth. The blue curve is always under the red line (zone line) when b 5 changing, which indicates that government control could reduce energy intensity effectively. The blue curve is also under the red line (except for a slight fluctuation in the enlarged diagram). The distance between them is bigger. Take the stable values of two errors as an example, it may be observed that ratio between the two stable values (the distance between the curves and the red line) is smaller than the stable value of energy intensity when b 5 \u00bc 0:0213 (there is a more detailed explanation in the contrastive analysis of Figs. 14 and 16). With the increasing of b 5 (over a critical value), the inhibition effect on economic growth will surpass the control effect on energy intensity; thus energy intensity does not reduce but increase, which suggests that government control should be sensibly used in some way. In conclusion, the energy intensity of YRD urban agglomerations cannot be controlled efficiently by simple government control. Although the energy intensity could be controlled to the stable state quickly by single government control, through which the value of energy intensity in YRD urban agglomerations has not declined finally, other constraint condition engagement is also needed to better control energy intensity.",

When the incentive coefficient gets bigger, i.e. the development of carbon tax gets faster, these changes will have some effect on the system in the early stage. The peak value of energy intensity gets bigger (Peak value 3 > Peak value 2 > Peak value 1) with the fluctuation intensifying. Nevertheless, energy intensity will be better controlled finally. The green curve is lower than the red curve at junction point 2, where carbon tax incentives are having an effect. The green curve is lower than the blue curve at junction point 3.

In summary, the development of carbon tax will speed up when carbon tax incentives getting large. There are short term fluctuations in the initial stage; but energy intensity could be reduced rapidly and better controlled eventually. Carbon tax incentives work well in promoting the development of YRD urban agglomerations carbon tax system. Fig. 16 shows the error value of carbon emissions and economic growth when d 2 changing from 0.0779 to 0.0879, where the blue curve is the error value of carbon emissions, and the green curve is the error value of economic growth.

In YRD urban agglomerations, private economy is active, small and medium enterprises accounting for the majority of enterprises. When levy carbon tax, these enterprises will actively seek method to reduce their own carbon emissions. With the development of economy, the carbon emissions descend after brief fluctuation, and the energy intensity gets lower, as shown in Fig. 9 . The development of economy doesn't necessarily go with more carbon emissions. The levying of carbon tax in YRD urban agglomerations plays a major role in controlling carbon emissions.

The carbon tax attractor of YRD urban agglomerations is obtained, followed by the analysis of the nonlinear dynamics behavior of the system. The quantitative coefficients of the actual system are achieved based on the GA-BP network. We take the time-dependent energy intensity calculation formula and the evolution tendency of economic growth as measurements to compare the differences between YRD urban agglomerations' carbon tax system and that of the whole China, putting forward the effect of commercialization management, economic property of YRD urban agglomerations, government control and carbon tax incentives on energy intensity. Energy intensity changes during the varying of constraint conditions. The deep reason is revealed by analyzing the error value of carbon emissions and economic growth. The plan of using carbon tax to properly control energy intensity is presented.",

Government control could control energy intensity quickly, while the measure has inhibition effect on economic growth. Energy intensity increases when the strength of government control is too large. Hence, a sophisticated warning control system is required, and government control should be used with an appropriate strength at the proper time. The economic property of YRD urban agglomerations is the main reason for its superiority in China's carbon tax system. The healthy and sustained development of YRD urban agglomerations' economy is the precondition of carrying out carbon tax pilot in that area. The development of ESER will be promoted under combined carbon tax and the economic property of YRD urban agglomerations. Designing reasonable carbon tax rate and making good use of carbon tax incentives are helpful to promote the development of carbon tax and ESER.",

The research contents are multifarious, while there is little literature on carbon tax pilot. Based on the 4D ESER system [41] , this paper initiates the exploration of carbon tax pilot in YRD urban agglomerations, with a potential attempt of levying carbon tax in YRD urban agglomerations. The conclusion presents a view on the focus of the current debate, that carbon tax is superior to carbon trading and other commercialization management in YRD urban agglomerations. The effect of government control on controlling carbon emissions is displayed by evolution diagrams. The importance of appropriate government control is suggested at the same time. The economic property of YRD urban agglomerations and carbon tax incentives are the key factors to the control of energy intensity. The dynamic method is an innovation research method for carbon tax pilot. Compared with the previous researches, evolution analysis and theoretical basis in this paper are more persuasive. The findings of this study are more consistent with the reality of YRD urban agglomerations.",

However, more variables should be included in the actual YRD urban agglomerations' ESER system, such as public acceptance, low carbon awareness and so on. Further research on the dynamic behavior of the system is necessary. In addition, the lack of statistical data might have some influence on the output parameters in parameter identification. Furthermore, the data of carbon tax is mainly based on hypothesis, surrogate data could be sought out by some more scientific methods. Besides, the effect of carbon tax is characterized by the evolution trend of energy intensity, carbon emissions and economic growth. Other measurable indicators will be analyzed in the future research. Appendix A Fig. 17 shows the evolution curve of energy intensity. The evolution curve is oscillatory. The red curve (Stable value 1) is the energy intensity evolution diagram of 3D ESER system in [37] , the blue curve (Stable value 2) is the curve of turning point 3 in Fig. 6 in [41] , and the green curve (Stable value 3) is the energy intensity evolution diagram of YRD urban agglomerations with carbon tax constraints. In order to reflect the evolution tendency of energy intensity more articulately, a optimization method is adopted as follows: the time axis t of evolution curve is divided equally; the maximum of evolution curve in every small range is singled out, and these maximum values are connected by a curve which is as smooth as possible; repeat the previous steps until the evolution curve is monotonic. Using above mentioned method, the monotonic curve is depicted as Fig. 6 shows. With the same method, Figs. 8, 11, 13 and 15 are obtained too.",

From the red curve to the green one, the time of reaching stable value gets shorter, and the space between the peak value and stable value gets smaller. The fluctuation of energy intensity becomes lighter. Fig. 6 is the monotonic curve of Fig. 17, Fig. 6 still has the same evolvement trend as Fig. 17 . When the initial value and the corresponding constrained conditions are given, the system will keep on developing until the emergence of stable value, and then the system continues to develop with this stable value. In fact, the energy intensity of the system in Fig. 17 (Fig. 6) is constantly changing. During the development of the system, the results of former time point are the initial values of the next time point. In this paper, the evolution trends of the ESER system with different constrained conditions are analyzed. Through comparative analyses, the results for the guidance to practice are carried out. Based on this, initial value and the corresponding constrained conditions are fixed. ",
