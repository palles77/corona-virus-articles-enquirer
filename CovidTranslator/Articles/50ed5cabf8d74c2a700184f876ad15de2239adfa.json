            "text": "Severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome (SFTS) is an emerging infectious 24 disease localized to China, Japan, and Korea that is characterized by severe hemorrhage and a 25 high fatality rate. Currently, no specific vaccine or treatment has been approved for this 26 disease. To develop a therapeutic agent for SFTS, we isolated antibodies from a phage-27 displayed antibody library that was constructed from a patient who recovered from SFTS 28 virus (SFTSV) infection. One antibody, designated as Ab10, was reactive to the Gn envelope 29 glycoprotein of SFTSV and protected host cells and A129 mice from infection in both in 30 vitro and in vivo experiments. Notably, Ab10 protected 80% of mice, even when injected 5 31 days after inoculation with a lethal dose of SFTSV. Using cross-linker assisted mass 32 spectrometry and alanine scanning, we located the non-linear epitope of Ab10 on the Gn 33 glycoprotein domain II and an unstructured stem region, suggesting that Ab10 may inhibit a 34 conformational alteration that is critical for cell membrane fusion between the virus and host 35 cell. Ab10 reacted to recombinant Gn glycoprotein in Gangwon/Korea/2012, HB28, and SD4 36 strains. Additionally, based on its epitope, we predict that Ab10 binds the Gn glycoprotein in 37 247 of 272 reported SFTSV isolates previously reported. Together, these data suggest that 38 Ab10 has potential to be developed into a therapeutic agent that could protect against more 39 than 90% of reported SFTSV isolates. 40 41",

For the no infection control group, no virus was added to cells. In 377 contrast, for the infection control group, no antibody was incubated with virus. After 378 removing the virus-antibody mixture, cells were cultured for 2 days. For the IFA, cultured 379 cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 1 h at room temperature. Slides were 380 blocked and permeabilized with PBS containing 0.1% Triton X-100 and 1% bovine serum381 albumin, followed by incubation with 5 \u03bcg/ml of anti-SFTSV Gn glycoprotein antibody[66] 382 at 4\u02daC overnight. After washing, cells were incubated for 1 h at room temperature with 1:100 383 diluted fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG Fc antibody (111-095-384 046, Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Grove, PA, USA). To stain the nucleus, 4',6-vivo efficacy test 390 For animal experiments, the titer of SFTSV was measured by plaque forming 391 assay[67]. Either 2 or 20 plaque forming units (PFU) of Gangwon/Korea/2012 strain SFTSV 392 in 200 \u03bcl of PBS were inoculated in 8-to 10-week-old male or female A129 mice by a 393 subcutaneous (s.c.) injection route. After an hour of infection, mice were administered with 394 Ab10 IgG 1 antibody or a PBS vehicle control through an intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection route, 395 at 30 mg/kg of body weight for every 24 h for a consecutive 4 days. Palivizumab 396 (MedImmune, Gaithersburg, MD, USA) or Mab4-5 IgG 1 was used as an isotype control or a 397 positive control antibody, respectively. In the delayed treatment model, the infected mice 398 were treated with antibodies at 1, 3, 4, or 5 days post infection (d.p.i.) for 4 days 399 consecutively. Body weight and survival of mice were monitored until 10 days post infection. 400 401 Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays 402 In order to measure the binding activities of the Ab10 and MAb4-5 IgG 1 antibodies, 403 96-well half-area microplates (3690, Corning, Corning, NY, USA) were coated with Gn-Fc 404 fusion protein and incubated at 4\u02daC overnight. Plates were blocked with 3% skim milk in 405 PBS for 1 h at room temperature. The plates were then washed with PBS and received 406 antibodies that were 10-fold serially diluted from 1 \u03bcM to 10 \u03bcM in blocking buffer. The 407 plates were then incubated for 2 h at room temperature and washed three times with 0.05% 408 Tween20 in PBS solution. Then, 50 \u03bcl of HRP-conjugated anti-human Ig kappa light chain 409 antibody (AP502P, Chemicon, Temecula, CA, USA) diluted in blocking buffer (1:5000) was Scientific). The coloring reaction was stopped by adding 50 \u03bcl of 2 413 M sulfuric acid. The absorbance of each well was measured at 450 nm using a microplate 414 spectrophotometer (Multiskan GO, Thermo Scientific). 415 416 Surface plasmon resonance analysis of Ab10 417 The kinetics of Ab10 and Gn glycoprotein binding were measured by surface plasmon 418 resonance analysis, using a Biacore T200 instrument with sensor chip CM5, amine coupling 419 kit, and his capture kit (28975001, 29149603, BR100050, 28995056, GE Healthcare). We 420 followed the recommended manufacturer's protocol for the procedures and conditions of 421 reaction buffers, flow times, flow rates, and concentration of analytes. Briefly, anti-histidine 422 antibody was immobilized on an activated CM5 chip, followed by a deactivation step. Then, 423 histidine tagged Gn-C\u03ba was injected over the flow cells prior to antibody injection. For the 424 association step, all of the Ab10 IgG 1 antibody in PBS at concentrations of two-fold 425 increments ranging from 1.25 nM to 80 nM was injected for 3 min. For the dissociation step, 426 PBS containing 0.005% of Tween20 was injected for 5 min. After each dissociation step, 427 chip regeneration was performed. 428 429 Conformational epitope mapping by crosslinking coupled mass spectrometry 430 The epitope of Ab10 antibody was first determined by analyzing the complex of Ab10 431 antibody and SFTSV Gn-C\u03ba antigen linked with deuterated cross-linkers, as previously 432 described[30]. Briefly, antibody, antigen, and antibody/antigen complex were characterized 433 by the high mass matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI) mass spectrometry N-hydroxysuccinimide esters, followed by reduction alkylation using 438 dithiothreitol, iodoacetamide, and urea. To digest the reduced complex, a proteolytic buffer 439 composed of trypsin, chymotrypsin, endoproteinase Asp-N, elastase, and thermolysin was 440 used. The sample was then analyzed by nano-liquid chromatography (Ultimate 3000, Dionex, 441 Sunnyvale, CA, USA) and Orbitrap mass spectrometry (Q Exactive Hybrid Quadrupole-442 Orbitrap, Thermo Scientific). 443 444 ELISA for epitope mapping 445 To measure the binding activities of Ab10 to mutated Gn, Ab10 scFv-C\u03ba antibody 446 and an anti-influenza virus hemagglutinin antibody (clone 12CA5, Bio X Cell, Lebanon, NH, 447 USA) were coated on a microplate in parallel. Then, plates were blocked with 3% skim milk 448 in PBS for 1 h at room temperature. Transiently transfected supernatant containing 449 recombinant Gn-Fc-HA proteins with alanine substitution was added to each well. After 450 incubation for 2 h at room temperature, the microplate was washed three times with 0.05% 451 Tween20 in PBS solution. Then, HRP-conjugated anti-human IgG Fc antibody (31423, 452 Invitrogen) diluted in blocking buffer was added to each well. The plate was incubated for 1 453 h at room temperature. After washing, each well received 50 \u00b5l of 3,3',5,5'-454 Tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) substrate solution (34028, Thermo Scientific). The coloring 455 reaction was stopped by adding 50 \u00b5l of 2 M sulfuric acid. The absorbance of each well was 456 measured at 450 nm using a microplate spectrophotometer (Multiskan GO, Thermo 457 Scientific). Relative reactivity was calculated using absorbance values (Abs) as follows: % 458 Relative reactivity = [100 x {(Abs of mutant captured by Ab10) / (Abs of mutant captured by and IFA data, including statistical comparisons, were analyzed and graphed 464 using GraphPad Prism software. Fluorescent signal measured by confocal microscope was 465 quantified using Leica Application Suite Advanced Fluorescence software. Mass 466 spectrometry data were analyzed using XQuest and Stavrox software. Plasmon surface 467 resonance data were analyzed using BIAevaluation software. Visualization, alignment, and 468 phylogenic analysis of amino acid sequences were performed with Geneious software. 469 470 484 4.

Because Gn glycoproteins from 247 isolates have conserved sequences for 220 these 25 amino acid residues, we expect that Ab10 can react with 90.8% (247 out of 272 221 isolates) of SFTSV isolates currently reported (S6 Fig).262 receptor, thereby blocking the interaction between the virus and the host cell[52]. Another 263 group of antibodies was reported to bind the stem region of influenza hemagglutinin that is 264 critical for conformational rearrangements that occur during membrane fusion[53-55]. This 265 mechanism has more potential to be utilized for clinical development, because the stem 266 region has fewer mutations than the receptor binding site. Additionally, several groups, 267 including ours, have elucidated unconventional virus neutralizing mechanisms that affect the 268 infection steps that occur after membrane fusion[56,57]. 272 recent report showed a cryo-electron microscopy map of RVFV, and depicted the crystal 273 structure of the RVFV Gn glycoprotein head region without a stem region[58]. The report 274 also describes the membrane fusion mechanism of RVFV that is mediated by a low pH 275 induced exposure of the hydrophobic Gc fusion loop. At a neutral pH, the Gn domain II (\u03b2-276 ribbon domain) shields the Gc fusion loop in the pre-fusion state and prevents premature 277 fusion. Based on this report, we hypothesize that Ab10 simultaneously binds to domain II and 278 the stem region of the Gn glycoprotein and prevents un-shielding of the Gc fusion loop.",
