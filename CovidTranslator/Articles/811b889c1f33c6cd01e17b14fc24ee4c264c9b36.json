However, the exact pathogenesis of the disease is not well understood, although there is some evidence to suggest it may be immune-mediated (Horzinek and Osterhaus, 1979; Pedersen and Boyle, 1980) . The natural route of infection is unknown, but both the respiratory and oral routes have been suggested. Experimentally, most workers have used intraperitoneal inoculation to reproduce the disease, though a variety of other routes have also been used (Hardy and Hurvitz, 1971; Weiss and Scott, 1981a,b; Hayashi et al., 1982 ) . Two studies have examined possible sites of early viral replication following infection with FIPV. Weiss and Scott (1981a,b) used an aerosol to administer the inoculum, and demonstrated initial replication in tracheobronchial lymph nodes, followed by generalised dissemination of the virus. Hayashi et al. (1982) showed that oral inoculation of the virus led to viral replication and lesions in the small intestinal mucosa.",

In addition, FIPV shedding was recorded in oro-pharyngeal secretions. Evidence of viral replication or pathological changes were found only infrequently in the tonsils by Weiss and Scott (1981b) , but they used an aerosol rather than the oral route for infection, which may have infuenced initial site of virus localisation.

However in both TGEV and CCV infections, histological changes are usually apparent within a few days of infection whereas in this experiment the changes were not apparent until Day 14. It is possible that despite the presence of virus in enterocytes, demonstrated by EM and IFT, viral damage was insufficient to cause recognisable histological changes. It is also possible that the pathology of the viral infection in the intestine was immune-mediated, since it was not seen until Day 14 when high serum neutralising antibody levels had developed.",
