Recent advances in techniques for isolation of human antibodies and antibody secreting cell lines have facilitated a rapid expansion in the number of antibodies available for study. Early analysis of these repertoires reveals interesting features of the HIV-specific antibody response. HIV-specific repertoires exhibit a high level of clonality in circulating cells, and high levels of somatic mutations within the antibody variable gene segments. It appears that many if not most antibodies in circulation bind to virus envelope conformations that are found only in complex oligomeric structures on virion particles or virus-like particles. The rapid isolation of large panels of novel human neutralizing antibodies promises to reveal new insights into the fundamental principles underlying antibodymediated neutralization of HIV.",

Despite a large body of research on HIV immunity, relatively little is understood about the fundamental principles underlying inhibition of HIV by human Abs.

Genotypic and phenotypic variation in virus populations exists in any one person at all times, and accumulates within individuals over time. In a population of infected individuals, the potential virus variation is enormous. The reagents that are in common use for immune studies typically were derived from representative individuals in the past and have been collected into panels of virus strains that represent only a portion of the spectrum of variation known to exist in field strains. These reagents, such as the envelope (Env) proteins from the NIH AIDS Reagent Repository, may or may not be appropriate for the study of the repertoire in any one individual. It is crucial and more biologically relevant to study the repertoire of response to an individual's native circulating viral quasi-species.",

Nevertheless, we still do not have a crystal clear appreciation of the structure of Env trimers in the virion membrane. There are suggestions that these protein trimers exhibit features that contribute to variation in structure, due to lack of a high level of stability of the trimeric head, high levels of glycosylation that may be variable, and the frequent occurrence of defective or shed trimers. The very reasons that this trimer is difficult to resolve structurally may correspond to features that contribute to the difficulty in developing broadly neutralizing antibodies.",

The molecular basis for these interactions is still under study. First, a number of host proteins incorporate into virion particles as they bud from the cell, therefore it is expected that host proteins on the surface of virions might bind to autoreactive B cells or antibodies. Second, it appears that in some cases autoreactive antibodies acquire additional specificity for HIV proteins, resulting in antibodies that bind both host and viral proteins, although typically with differing affinities. The physiologic role of such crossreactivity or polyspecificity is not clear at this time. However, interpretation of HIV-specific B cell repertoires ultimately must account for these complex specificities.",

            "text": "A large number of new or improved techniques for isolation of human antibodies has emerged in the last decade, and these techniques are being focused rapidly on the HIV antibody problem. Phage display of single chain or Fabs in large libraries has been used to isolate important and interesting antibodies from mRNAs from human B cells [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] . Such antibodies contain randomly associated heavy and light chains, so the isolated antibodies may or may not have existed in the donor. More recently, techniques that maintain the natural pairing of heavy and light chains have been developed. EBV transformation has long been used in the field, but was recently greatly improved with the finding that EBV transformation in the presence of CpG, through activation of survival and proliferation signals via Toll-like receptor 9, is much more efficient [10, 11] . This technique yields polyclonal collections of transformed lines that can be screened for antigen specificity, however cloning stable EBV lines can be challenging. We have combined this method with electrofusion to myeloma partners to yield stable human hybridomas in some cases [12, 13] . Isolation of antibody genes from single antigen-selected cells that are expanded in culture [14, 15] or cloned directly [16, 17] has yielded large panels of antibody sequences that are virus-specific, including HIV-specific repertoires. Typically most of the cloned cells are memory cells, but other subsets of cells can be selected with the appropriate markers. An important challenge to these studies is the fact that most recombinant antigens do not fully recapitulate the native antigenic structure of the Env protein on the virion, so that antibody repertoires obtained from selection of B cells with altered antigens may be misleading. A variation of this technique is to isolate plasmablasts that are reacting to a recent immunization or acute infection, with the presumption that blasting cells are mostly specific for the antigen present in the recent immunization [18] . It is not yet clear if the specificity of plasmablasts will be high enough for the antigens of chronic infections like HIV. Simple analysis of the antibody gene repertoire without Ab expression is of interest, but without expression of the antibodies and confirmation of binding to virions these studies are difficult to interpret.",

This suggests that while physical sorting of single antigen-specific cells enriches their frequency, not every sorted cell produces antibodies able to bind HIV. Care is needed when drawing conclusions from studies on repertoire usage since the physical sorting process results in potentially a high level of non-specific binding. The way to overcome this concern is to express the antibody genes and produce antibody proteins for in vitro studies from the isolated genes.",

There have been reports of a broad neutralizing response following vaccination of oligomeric forms of gp140. Unfortunately, the reported breadth of activity consisted of mostly low serum titers, often with titers of <1:100, and not all gp140 trimeric Env preparations induce significant titers of neutralizing Abs able to recognize conformational epitopes [21] . Additionally, virus-like particles (VLPs) bearing disulfide-stabilized functional trimers (SOS-VLPs) and cleavage-site mutated Env VLPs predominantly induced Ab responses against nonfunctional forms of Env and not against the trimeric Env [22] .",

The anti-gp41 Abs in this study exhibited improved binding in the context of the trimerized gp140 versus the monomeric gp140. These data imply that there is a conformational change upon trimerization with this construct in the gp41 region. However, this effect was not noted for the Abs that mapped to gp120 epitopes. The trimer in this study contains a mutation in the protease cleavage site between gp120 and gp41 [24] , and such mutations may interfere with formation of the native epitope conformation during trimerization. The association of gp120 and gp41 is unstable in mature native virions [25, 26] . Many groups have utilized proteolytic cleavage site mutations to stabilize this interaction in their oligomeric or lipid-associated Env trimers [20, 22, 27, 28] . Similarly, immunization with HIV-1 Env gp140 trimerized constructs created by the addition of the trimerization motif of the T4 bacteriophage fibritin did not induce significant amounts of Abs to conformational epitopes [21] .",

When gag and env genes are expressed together, VLPs are created in which Env protein self assembles in the lipid outer-membrane and forms trimeric Env (herein referred to as HIV-VLP), thus mimicking a natural HIV virion [25, 31] . A Vpr-GFP gene fusion construct that incorporates into the VLP was created in order to track the VLPs by fluorescence emission.

Minimal non-specific interaction was detected with the Gag-only VLPs in the flow cytometric sorting experiments In order to study the Ab repertoire of HIV positive patients, GFP-labeled HIV-VLP reactive B cells were isolated from infected patient peripheral blood samples. These HIV-VLPs bound HIV-positive subject B cells but not those from HIV-negative controls ( Figure 2 ). Generally, between 0.1% and 1% of circulating B cells from an HIV-positive subject bound HIV-VLP in the subjects we have studied to date, which were obtained from long-term non-progressors [30] . As part of the original characterization of these individuals, neutralization assays were performed to confirm the presence of BaL neutralizing circulating Abs, which is the parent strain of our HIV-VLP. Individual B cells were subjected to flow cytometric sorting into wells of a 96-well plate onto a feeder cell line. After culturing and expansion to small clones containing a few hundreds of cells, supernatants were screened for immunoglobulin production and antigen specificity by utilizing three distinct ELISAs (gp120 protein, HIV-VLP, or Gagonly VLP). Both the gp120 used in ELISA and the VLP Env used for sorting and in ELISA were from the clade B HIV virus isolate BaL.",

Interestingly, comparing the optical densities of the three different ELISA screens revealed that the pattern of reactivity for a particular antigen (monomer, HIV-VLP or Gag-only VLP) also was shared within each clonotype ( Figure 3D ). Once again, most of the Abs bound the trimeric Env presented on the VLP (shown in green), but did not bind monomeric gp120 (shown in red).

Clonotype B bound both gp120 monomer on ELISA and the HIV-VLP, which should have gp120/gp41 heterodimers presented on the surface, indicating the epitope of this antibody is likely a relatively linear epitope that does not change significantly upon trimeric conformation of the Env spike.

Comparison of the CDR3 regions of mAbs 47e, 2C6 and 6B8 reveal a shared DY*SDPFY motif.

            "text": "Emerging techniques for the study if human HIV-specific B cell repertoires promise to greatly expand our understanding of the molecular basis for antibody-mediated inhibition of HIV. Large panels of HIV-specific antibodies are being isolated, with a focus on isolating neutralizing antibodies. Care must be taken to use the most authentic antigen possible in order to recapitulate important native neutralizing epitopes. We and others increasingly find that most HIV-specific antibodies in humans bind to epitopes present only on complex oligomeric Env antigens, perhaps best represented currently by VLPs. Ultimately, knowledge of the fundamental principles underlying antibody-mediated neutralization of HIV will contribute to the rational design of immunogens to induce neutralizing responses. Binding of HIV-specific B cell culture supernates in enzyme linked immunosorbent assay to (A) HIV-VLPs containing Env protein, (B) monomeric gp120, or (C) VLPs containing Gag but not Env protein. Panels A through C show photographs of the colorimetric readout of the reactivity in plates tested with the same supernates arrayed in the same pattern. In (D) is shown the optical density (OD at 450 nm) of the same samples color-coded for reactivity as in the title of the ELISAs above (A=green, B=red, C=blue). In D, the wells are grouped by genetic clonotypes, determined by subsequent sequence analysis of the antibody genes of B cells from corresponding wells. The data in D show that cells within a clonotype (i.e., B cells sharing antibody genes) exhibit similar binding specificity for monomeric (red) or oligomeric (green) forms of Env. Interestingly, two clonotypes (designated G and H) exhibit binding to VLPs that do not contain Env.",

B cells then are labeled with the resulting fluorescent HIV-VLPs and are shown here specifically labeling a subset of HIV-specific B cells from a HIV+ subject. These VLP-labeled B cells then are sorted into individual culture wells of a 96-well plate containing a stimulator cell line and cytokine mixture (shown in bottom portion of figure). ELISAs are used to identify clonal B cell populations HIV-specific immunoglobulins. Cells are collected from wells of interest, RNA isolation is performed and RT-PCR is used to clone the corresponding antibody variable gene segments of the heavy and light chains. Antibody genes of interest are sequenced and cloned into a plasmid based antibody expression system.",
