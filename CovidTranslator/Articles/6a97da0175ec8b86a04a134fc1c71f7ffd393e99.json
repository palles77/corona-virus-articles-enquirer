Lehmann et al. demonstrated that ssRNA40 causes neuronal cell death in mice through binding to TLR7 activating subsequently MyD88 and caspase-3 in a cellautonomous manner exacerbated by microglial inflammatory ssRNA40/TLR7 dependent signaling, while TLR7\u00c0/\u00c0 mice are entirely protected against ssRNA40 induced neuronal death [6] .",

Thus, an interesting question is how widespread the feature of owning GU-rich ssRNAs to drive immune cells crazy is. Obviously it is not restricted to a specific viral genus: HIV-1 is a lentivrus, SARS-CoV a coronavirus and a certain flavivirus, the Langat virus (LGTV), looks like another good candidate based on data in press provided by Baker et al. linking TLR7 to the regulation of the neuroinflammatory response to LGTV infection in the CNS [7] . However, the newcomer and outsider among its own genus SARS-CoV, whose overall level of similarity with other coronaviruses is reduced, might have put the finishing touches to this useful tool made of ssRNAs.",

Given that both receptors are localized in the endosome, it is rather likely that ssRNA ends up there after receptor-mediated endocytosis of the virus or fusion of the viral particle and the infected cell. The strict compartmentalization is a must, as ssRNA with GU-motives is not an exclusive brand of the viral genome and several autoimmune diseases like systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) or reumathoid arthritis correlate with CpG DNAs and RNA in extracellular compartments as well as the production of autoantibodies against endogenous RNA [5, 7] . Host-released extracellular RNA is also frequently detected in brains of neurodegenerative disorder patients like Alzheimer's disease, where it contributes in spreading damage of the central nervous system (CNS) through TLR signaling [6] .",

Indeed, hexadimethrine bromide (HDMBr) and 1,4-diaminobutane core-PAMAM-G3 (PAMAM-G3) are able to counter the immune stimulatory effect of all nucleic-acid TLR ligands in multiple inflammatory cell types in vitro and in vivo, acting as molecular scavengers both neutralizing the free nucleic acids and altering their intracellular distribution.",
