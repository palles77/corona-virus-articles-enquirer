The European Centre for Disease Control has also recommended and promoted the use of standard precautions, but has not specified what is included in the term. 7 Some of the content variation of these documents can be explained by different national organizations having different jurisdictions, and by variation in mandates given to the authors; this has to be a problem that can be overcome. To the present author's knowledge, no standard precautions include actions that should be omitted; they all need to be done, all of the time.",

To decide if a person requires transmission-based precautions, there has to be an infection risk assessment at every patient admission. This infection risk assessment is, therefore, a critical standard precautions action. This assessment is where patients with diarrhoea, vomiting, infected wounds, symptoms suggestive of tuberculosis or at high-risk of carrying a multi-drug-resistant organism are identified as presenting an infection risk to others; as a consequence, transmission-based precautions commence in addition to standard precautions.",

Emphasizing the importance of standard precautions with adjectives such as 'strict', 'effective', 'good', 'excellent' or 'robust' is unhelpful because it implies that one only needs to practice safely if an infection risk is recognized, or it is acceptable not to undertake standard precautions all the time.

Basics for the safe care of people (i.e that which is done by and with people). For example, hand hygiene, use of personal protective equipment, respiratory hygiene, assessment pre-patient placement and effective BBF exposure response. Basics for the safe care of people who require high-infectionrisk procedures. Any procedure that involves an invasive device or access to a sterile body area presents a high risk of infection and should be avoided wherever possible. Where the procedures cannot be avoided, they should be practised in such a way as to minimize risks. Such procedures include safe invasive device procedures (including endoscopy) and safe injection practices (including intravenous drug preparation and lumbar puncture). This is a novel summary but it presents a simple division of what needs to be done to inanimate objects in the healthcare setting and people to prevent infection. It also allows new actions to be slotted in on the basis of meeting the criteria for needing to be done for everyone, every time. By separating the invasive procedures into the third category, they can be named as what they present to patients: a high risk of infection. The first and second categories are uncluttered with instructions for procedures which may never be performed in some care settings.",

At present, a common language is not spoken with regard to standard precautions. National and international guidelines should not extol standard precautions unless and until they make explicit what they mean by the term. A case is made for gathering relevant experts, including clinicians and human factors experts, to agree what is and what is not meant by standard precautions.
