We find two equilibrium points, disease free equilibrium and endemic equilibrium. Global stability analysis of the equilibria was conducted using Lyapunov function which depends on the basic reproduction ratio R 0 . If R 0 \\ 1, the disease free equilibrium point is globally asymptotically stable, and if R 0 C 1 the endemic equilibrium point is globally asymptotically stable. We computed and predicted the basic reproduction ratios across all the years. It was found out that there were flaws in the exact values of R 0 which is related to the poor registration system of HIV/AIDS in Turkey. Hence, there is need for the government to improve the system in order to cover the actual cases of the disease. The increase of the basic reproduction ratio over the years also shows the need for the relevant authorities to adopt appropriate control measures in combating the disease.",

This new infection occurs because the infected persons do not take necessary precaution measures or because of poor protective services. This can be possible if patients are not being well educated on their responsibility to prevent the spread of the disease and/or are not being included in protective service studies (Morin et al. 2004) . In general, HIV diagnosis is a traumatic experience that changes HIV? person's life. This is why patients don't reveal their diagnosis at all or only reveal it to a limited number of people. It is among the strategic goal of HIV prevention to understand how and why patients hide their diagnosis and to determine possible solution to it (Miller and Rubin 2007; Anderson et al. 2009; Wolf et al. 2004) . Previous studies indicated that the most common reason patients hide their diagnosis is fear of stigma and exclusion (Anderson and Walker 2010) . It has also been indicated that having a family member diagnosed with HIV can affect family members in different ways (Vithayachockitikhun 2006) .",

Many more studies carried out in different countries and in different cultures and religions have reported the same threat faced by the patients and their families as those in Turkey (Ramchandani et al. 2007 ). Due to these problems HIV/AIDS positive people normally do not register themselves in the various registration centers. However, there is need for government and other relevant authorities to know the exact cases of HIV in the country in order to know the exact threat posed by the disease and consequently adopt possible measures in combating it.",

Primary purpose of any mathematical model of HIV transmission lies in using individual level inputs to project population level outcomes. Some of the important outcomes that can be examined with a model are; the incidence of infection, the prevalence of infection, or the doubling time of the epidemic. More important than these however, is simply the likelihood of an epidemic to occur that is whether there is sufficient transmission potential for a chain of infection to be sustained. This outcome is termed by a simple summary statistic: the reproduction number of the infectious process, R 0 . In a susceptible population, R 0 represents the expected number of secondary infections generated by the first infected individual. If R 0 is equal or greater than 1 an epidemic is expected. If R 0 is less than 1, the infection is expected to die out.",

Conditions of stability of both the equilibrium points were shown to depend on a threshold quantity, the basic reproduction ratio (R 0 ). It was shown that if the basic reproduction ratio is less than one, the disease free equilibrium is globally asymptotically stable and the disease dies out. Also, if the basic reproduction ratio is greater than one, the endemic equilibrium point is globally asymptotically stable, and epidemics occur.",

Starting from 1994 the predicted cases continue to increase rapidly and are far greater than the exact cases. This can be attributed to poor registration exercise in the country. From Table 3 , it can be seen that from 1985 to 1995 the exact values for the basic reproduction ratios are less than one, hence no epidemics. It is also less than one in 1999.

In the exact values of R 0 , we noticed a fluctuation from 1985 up to 2005 and then a steady increase from 2006 to 2016. This can also be attributed to poor registration system to cover the exact HIV/AIDS cases in Turkey. However, there is stable increase in the predicted values of R 0 over the years. Hence our model shows the To show the significance of the data obtained by the model in predicting HIV epidemics in Turkey over the official data obtained from the Ministry of Health Turkey, we obtained HIV drug data from intercontinental marketing service (IMS). Comparing these three sets of data, which can be seen from Fig. 3 , shows the flaws in the official data. The result of the analysis in this paper shows the urgent need of intervention by the relevant authorities in controlling the spread of the disease. Since in recent years, the education sector has come to play an increasingly important role in preventing HIV. Our proposal here is the use of interventions through the education sector to curtail the spread of the disease in Turkey. This is particularly because many studies in literature show that the school-based HIV/AIDS education programs provide significant changes in knowledge and attitudes that affect sexual behavior of young people. This leads to significant progress in the use of condoms and decrease in most of the sexual health problems. (Thomson et al. 1999; Kinsler 2004; Fawole et al. 1999; Kirby et al. 2007; James-Traore et al. 2004) . Two element are covered by effective school-based education: training of teachers and curriculum development. A review by Kirki et al. evaluates multiple studies of such interventions and found that successful curriculum-based programs have 17 characteristics (Thomson et al. 1999) . Some of these characteristics were about development of the curriculum; Some were about the curriculum itself; and the remaining were about the implementation of the curriculum (Thomson et al. 1999) . After developing a curriculum, there is need for teachers to be well trained to enable them to improve students' knowledge about HIV prevention and transmission, attitudes toward HIV prevention, and behaviours relating to HIV/AIDS.",
