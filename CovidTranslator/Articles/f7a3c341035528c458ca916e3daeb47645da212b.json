            "text": "Next generation sequencing (NGS) technologies have revolutionized the genomics field and are becoming more commonplace for identification of human infectious diseases. However, due to the low abundance of viral nucleic acids (NAs) in relation to host, viral identification using direct NGS technologies often lacks sufficient sensitivity. Here, we describe an approach based on two complementary enrichment strategies that significantly improves the sensitivity of NGS-based virus identification. To start, we developed two sets of DNA probes to enrich virus NAs associated with respiratory diseases. The first set of probes spans the genomes, allowing for identification of known viruses and full genome sequencing, while the second set targets regions conserved among viral families or genera, providing the ability to detect both known and potentially novel members of those virus groups. Efficiency of enrichment was assessed by NGS testing reference virus and clinical samples with known infection. We show significant improvement in viral identification using enriched NGS compared to unenriched NGS. Without enrichment, we observed an average of 0.3% targeted viral reads per sample. However, after enrichment, 50%-99% of the reads per sample were the targeted viral reads for both the reference isolates and clinical specimens using both probe sets. Importantly, dramatic improvements on genome coverage were also observed following virus-specific probe enrichment. The methods described here provide improved sensitivity for virus identification by NGS, allowing for a more comprehensive analysis of disease etiology.",

Failures in detection may result from the limited repertoire of routine diagnostics or the inability of commonly used PCR methods to pick up variants of known pathogens or unknown and previously unrecognized pathogens. Using next generation sequencing (NGS) for viral detection and discovery provides significant advantages to traditional viral diagnostic assays-full genome sequences may be obtained and targets are not limited by pre-existing knowledge of the pathogen. However, one of the greatest challenges to NGS as a routine, affordable, diagnostic tool is the relative paucity of viral nucleic acids (NAs) present in clinical samples.",

Additionally, host genomic DNA depletion by DNase treatment or ribosomal RNA depletion have been used to reduce levels of host NAs in a sample (Allander et al. 2001) .

We used two complementary panels of oligonucleotide probes targeted against representative common respiratory viruses as a proof of concept. They are (1) virus-specific probes that span the full genome of common respiratory viruses, and (2) conserved viral group probes that target against conserved regions from each of nine viral families or subfamilies that are associated with respiratory diseases. The virus-specific probes allow for full genome sequencing, which contributes to a more complete and confident identification and characterization of target viruses. The conserved viral group probes enable detection of divergent viruses with the potential to recognize novel viruses within these known viral families. The combination of these two enrichment approaches is expected to increase the number of usable reads per sample and per sequencing run, significantly improving the sensitivity and value of NGS for viral detection, discovery, and sequence characterization.",

We determined the endpoint of detection as the highest sample C t with positive targeted viral reads. Endpoints were assessed both prior to and after enrichment, and improvement in endpoint detection was described as the log difference between the two. For OC43, using virus-specific probes, we could detect the virus from pre-enrichment samples at C t 24.1, while from post-enrichment samples, we detected the virus at C t 36, a >3-log improvement in endpoint detection compared to the unenriched sample ( Fig. 3A ; Supplemental A B C Figure 3 .

In this study, we show greatly improved NGS-based virus detection following enrichment of viral NAs using two complementary sets of probes, testing both viral reference and clinical samples. Our virus-specific probes also improve linear genome coverage with greater depth. The information gained by increased or full genome sequencing allows for detection of viral mutations or minor variants which may prove useful in viral transmission and evolution studies. Notably, we observe that our virus-specific probes are effective when they share 90% or more nucleotide similarity with the probe sequences. This is consistent with other observations for hybridization-based capture performance (Briese et al. 2015) . This high level of hybridization stringency likely contributes to the inability to enrich related viruses with insufficient sequence homology, including members of the picornavirus family. For example, HRV A62 and HRV C6 in clinical samples do not enrich (Fig.  4D) -there is only a 70% match in nucleotide identity between the genome sequences of HRV A89 (NC_001617.1), the virus strain used for probe design, and HRV A62, the virus tested. Similarly, there is only an average of 70% match in nucleotide identity between HRV C (NC_009996.1), the species used for probe design, and HRV C6, the species tested, based on the partial sequences available for HRV C6. As expected, we observed that HMPV83, which was used for the HMPV probe design, was enriched more efficiently than HMPV75 virus. In addition, viruses 229E, mammalian orthoreovirus type 1, epizootic hemorrhagic disease virus, and Great Island virus were not enriched by the conserved viral group probe set. The enrichment failure for these viruses could be due to the probe sequence issues, and thus the conserved probe set for coronaviruses and reoviruses may need to be further optimized.",

In this study, we demonstrate that virus-specific probe enrichment significantly improves linear genome coverage as well as sequencing depth in viruses with C t values in the high 20s into the 30s (Supplemental Tables S4, S6 ). The increased depth of coverage over a full or nearly full genome makes virus classification more accurate, as we can be more confident at every base.

For example, the recently discovered viruses MERS-CoV, camel coronavirus HKU23, Colorado tick fever virus, and Bunyip Creek virus were enriched using the conserved viral group probe set. Another benefit of the conserved viral group probe pool is that it requires only a modest number of oligonucleotide probes to be synthesized, compared to the millions of probes that would be required for enriching a broad range of viruses.

The complementary pair of respiratory probe panels are able to enrich full genomes of commonly known respiratory viruses and enrich key signatures of divergent or novel viruses simultaneously, so that each sequencing run is more likely to give useful information. The use of commercially available reagents and an easy-to-follow protocol makes this method easily adaptable in a variety of laboratory settings, and it may be easily automated for a high-throughput setting. Further, we are able to enrich viruses from nine families or subfamilies associated with common respiratory infection using the smaller conserved viral group probe pool which contains just 346 probes. We observe that the addition of more probes (increasing the conserved viral group probe pool from 138 to 346 probes) does not decrease the efficiency of enrichment. The work presented here is a pilot study based on a selection of representative respiratory viruses. We will update the virus-specific probe set to include probes against additional respiratory viruses and update the probes that did not work as well as expected. This adaptability also paves the way for larger panels, including the development of a pan viral probe set for pan viral genome enrichment. Taken together, the approaches described here offer an efficient and comprehensive method to harness the power of NGS in routine laboratory and clinical virus detection and discovery. The enriched NGS coupled with the rapid diagnosis methods by real-time PCR will provide a powerful and comprehensive tool for outbreak investigation of both known and unknown infectious etiologies.",

Reference viruses that match the viruses used for virus-specific probe design (Supplemental Table S8 ) were selected, including coronaviruses 229E, NL63, OC43, and HKU1; AdV C2 and AdV E4; pneumoviruses RSVA, RSVB, and HMPV 83; paramyxoviruses HPIV1, HPIV2, HPIV3; bocaviruses HBoV1 and HBoV3; influenza A virus A/Chicken/ HongKong (H9N2); picornaviruses HPeV1, HPeV6, and rhinovirus HRV B14. In some cases a match was unavailable; therefore, we selected the closest available viruses. For example, we used AdV B11 in place of the adenovirus B1 that the probes were based on. For influenza A virus, we selected the same serotype: A/New Caledonia/ 20/99 and A/California/07/2009 (pandemic) for H1N1; A/Sydney/ 05/97 (H3N2) and A/Avian Turkey/England for H3N2; and A/Avian Duck/Hong Kong for H5N1. For influenza B virus, we included both B/Yamagata and B/Victoria lineages, while the probes were only based on B/Lee/40. NAs were extracted using the QIAamp MinElute Virus Spin Kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. NAs eluted in nuclease-free water were aliquoted and stored at \u221280\u00b0C. RNA was extracted from the human lung carcinoma cell line A549 (ATCC CCL-185) using TRIzol LS (Thermo Fisher Scientific) according to the manufacturer's instructions, and stored at \u221280\u00b0C.",

            "text": "Libraries generated from parallel hybridized and nonhybridized samples were normalized and combined at equimolar quantities to denature. The final loading concentration was 9 pM, with 1%-5% PhiX added. Samples were run on an Illumina MiSeq according to the manufacturer's instructions, yielding a median of \u223c500,000 sequencing reads per sample.Data analysis and bioinformatics pipeline FASTQ files were analyzed by k-mer matching and read mapping using the following steps. Reads were trimmed for adapters and for quality using Cutadapt 1.8.1 (Martin 2011) . Trimmed reads were then classified as human, bacterial, archaeal, viral, and PhiX using Kraken 0.10.5 (Wood and Salzberg 2014) and a database consisting of the human genome (GCF_000001405.26, 12/ 17/2013) and bacteria and virus genomes from RefSeq (Release 67, 9/8/2014). In parallel, trimmed reads were mapped to chosen references using Bowtie 2 2.2.9 (Langmead and Salzberg 2012) or BWA-MEM (Li and Durbin 2009) . Resulting read numbers were used to generate charts as well as fold enrichment, where possible. For simplicity, targeted viral reads and total nontarget reads are depicted in results. We used a relative read count threshold (0.01%) to exclude low targeted viral reads because of potential barcode contamination. The samples with targeted viral reads <0.01% of the highest number of reads obtained for any sample of the same virus in the same MiSeq run were called negative.",
