Most disease is caused by a small number of meningococcal genotypes known as hyperinvasive lineages. As these are also carried asymptomatically, acquisition of them alone cannot explain why only some hosts develop meningococcal disease. Our aim was to determine whether genetic diversity in CEACAM is associated with susceptibility to meningococcal disease. Frequency distributions of alleles, genotypes and haplotypes were compared in four CEACAM genes in 384 case samples and 190 controls. Linkage disequilibrium among polymorphic sites, haplotype structures and relationships were also analysed. A number of polymorphisms were observed in CEACAM genes but the diversity of CEACAM1, to which most Opa proteins bind, was lower, and a small number of high-frequency haplotypes were detected. Dose-dependent associations of three CEACAM haplotypes with meningococcal disease were observed, with the effect of carrying these haplotypes amplified in homozygous individuals. Two haplotypes were protective while one haplotype in CEACAM6 was associated with a twofold increase in disease susceptibility. These data imply that human CEACAM may be one determinant of human susceptibility to meningococcal disease.",

            "text": "Adhesion of Neisseria meningitidis to the human nasopharyngeal epithelium is critical for establishment of invasive meningococcal disease, 1 a globally important infection that cannot be effectively controlled due to the lack of a comprehensive vaccine. 2 In Europe 1-6/100 000 people contract the disease annually, with a case fatality rate of approximately 8%. 3 Asymptomatic carriage is more frequent however, with meningococci present in approximately 10% of the general population and up to 40% in 15-24 year olds. 4 Both colonization and invasion require the specific interaction of Opacity-associated adhesin (Opa) proteins on the meningococcal surface with the carcino-embryonic antigen cell adhesion molecule (CEACAM) family of cell surface proteins on the human nasopharyngeal epithelium. 5 Most individuals are colonized asymptomatically but, for incompletely understood reasons, adhesion in some hosts is followed by invasion of the mucosa, entry of meningococci into the blood stream and meningococcal disease. Most global meningococcal disease over the past half century has been caused by less than ten genotypes, known as the hyperinvasive lineages, as defined by multilocus sequence typing. 6, 7 As these genotypes are also carried asymptomatically, their acquisition alone cannot explain all cases of invasive disease. CEACAM proteins are encoded by 7 members of a 29member gene family (the remainder being pseudogenes), in the q13.2 region of chromosome 19. 8 Their usual biological functions range from cell adhesion, facilitation and regulation of signal transduction to a possible role in innate immunity. [9] [10] [11] Structurally, these proteins belong to the immunoglobulin superfamily of surface proteins, consisting of an IgV-like N-terminal domain followed by a number of IgC-like conserved domains. In some members of the CEACAM family, dependent on variation in splicing, these are linked to the cell surface by a GPI anchor whereas in others, a transmembrane region and a cytosolic signalling domain are present. The extramembranous loop regions of Opa proteins, which exhibit high levels of diversity 12 interact with the nonglycosylated face of a b-pleated-sheet in the Nterminal domain of CEACAM proteins. 5, 13, 14 Meningococcal Opa proteins have been shown to bind to HeLa cells expressing CEACAM1 (formerly known as BGPa or CD66a), CEACAM3 (formerly known as CGM1a or CD66d), CEACAM5 (formerly known as CEA or CD66e) and CEACAM6 (formerly known as NCA or CD66c) and to soluble chimaeric CEACAM1 N-terminal domains. 14, 15 Despite their diversity, the majority of meningococcal Opa proteins maintain the ability to bind to at least one member of the CEACAM family and in some receptorligand pairs, this interaction leads only to attachment, whereas uptake into the host cells ensues in others. 5, [13] [14] [15] [16] Upregulation of CEACAM expression in vitro leads to increased uptake of meningococci, even when encapsulated, 17 further indicating the importance of CEACAM proteins to the meningococcal life cycle and pathogenesis of meningococcal disease.",

Three haplotypes in two CEACAM genes were found to affect susceptibility, which may exert their effects through two mechanisms. However, our data suggest that diversity in CEACAM is unlikely to drive the high diversity of the Opa proteins, adhesins that are important in mediating meningococcal pathogenesis. Genotyping of the CEACAM genes revealed differences in the extent of their diversity relative to each other, each with a limited number of high-frequency haplotypes circulating in the Caucasian population. Based on the SNPs typed in this study, CEACAM1 was less polymorphic than CEACAM3, 5 and 6. This could reflect a necessity to maintain the structure and function of the CEACAM1 protein, and explain why the majority of Opa proteins tested bind to CEACAM1, whilst varying in their abilities to bind to those of other CEACAM proteins. Meningococcal Opa proteins have been shown to bind to HeLa cells expressing CEACAM1, CEACAM3, CEACAM5 and CEACAM6 and to soluble chimaeric CEACAM1 N-terminal domains. 5,14-16 Further-more, the comparatively lower level of polymorphism in CEACAM1 may also have led to its targeting by the adhesins of other bacterial pathogens including other Neisseria species (which also express Opa proteins), UspA1 of Moraxella catarrhalis, 20 the P5 proteins of Haemophilus influenzae 21 and the Afa/Dr adhesins of Escherichia coli 22 during adhesion to human hosts.",

CEACAM proteins on the nasopharyngeal epithelium and on cells of the immune system are recognized as receptors for meningococcal Opa proteins, 5 so susceptibility may be influenced by the effects of CEACAM diversity on meningococcal adhesion. Since CEACAM is also expressed on endothelia, 15 it may play a role in mediating meningococcal entry into the meninges. In this study, there was no evidence of polymorphism in the Opa binding site, encoded by the first and second exons of each CEACAM gene, affecting disease susceptibility. Polymorphisms in the 5 0 extragenic regions upstream of CEACAM6 may, however, be associated with effects on the regulation of gene expression but further functional analyses would be required to test this hypothesis. There is clear evidence, however, that increased surface density of CEACAM proteins leads to increased Opa-mediated uptake of even encapsulated meningococci and expression levels of different CEACAMs on the same cells may also be important in differential mediation of cell signalling. 17, 25 An alternative means by which CEACAM-mediated disease susceptibility may arise involves subversion of the human immune response. Interaction of gonococcal Opa proteins with CEACAM1 switches off and prevents proliferation of CD4 \u00fe T cells. 26 The effect of CEACAM diversity on immunity may not reflect a role in binding Opa, but may indicate an underlying immunological defect, perhaps involving intercellular communication or contact. CEACAM3 and CEACAM6, along with other CEACAM proteins are thought to play a role in innate immunity. 10, 27 CEACAM3, which consists only of an amino-terminal IgV-like domain, is exclusively expressed on granulocytes and is involved in opsoninindependent phagocytosis and oxidative killing of human-specific bacterial pathogens. 11, 28 Taken in conjunction with our data, this may indicate that individuals with protective haplotypes in CEACAM3 and CEACAM6 have improved innate immunity against the meningococcus, whereas the disease-associated haplotype in CEACAM6 may indicate a defect in innate immunity. The underlying molecular mechanisms are unclear however, and would require further analysis of CEACAM polymorphism and function. Different expression levels of alternatively spliced CEACAM isoforms or alternatively posttranslationally processed CEACAM proteins may also play a role in mediating different signalling pathways and in innate immunity 29 and it may be useful in the future to investigate levels of CEACAM3 expression on granulocytes and CEACAM6 on other cells of the immune system.",

In the developing world, hyperinvasive lineages are responsible for periodic, large-scale epidemics and pandemics. It is tempting to speculate that genetic polymorphisms, perhaps including those detected in this study, contribute to the observed epidemiological differences by increasing the risk of meningococcal disease in particular populations.",

Confirmation of diagnosis was made by positive meningococcal culture from blood or cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), detection of increased meningococcal antibodies, or by PCR detection of meningococcal DNA in the blood or in CSF. In patients with no microbiological confirmation, meningococcal disease was diagnosed clinically upon presentation with petechial or purpuric rash and fever and features of systemic sepsis or meningitis where no other pathogen could be isolated. A further 56 samples from survivors of meningococcal disease were enrolled via the Meningitis Research Foundation (MRF) charity between 1996 and 1999. The patients' general physician or hospital consultant confirmed the diagnosis. There was no overlap between the three sources of patient recruitment, which together yielded 443 samples. Reliable statistical analysis of the influence of individual polymorphisms and haplotypes on the clinical severity of meningococcal disease was prohibited by the low number of samples from cases for which clinical disease severity scores were known.",

The SNPs appeared only once in the human genome sequence and first round PCR products gave only single bands when analysed by agarose electrophoresis (data not shown). SNPs in CEACAM4, 7 and 8 were not included due to the lack of evidence of their interaction with meningococcal Opa proteins at the time the study was designed. The possibility that some Opa proteins interact with these cannot however be discounted completely since the number of Opa proteins investigated is relatively low. CEACAM1 SNPs were located on average once every 1409 bp. CEACAM3 SNPs were located on average once every 1507 bp. CEACAM5 SNPs were located on average once every 1880 bp. CEACAM6 SNPs were located on average every once every 1353 bp. A full list of SNPs analysed in this study is available upon request from the authors.",
