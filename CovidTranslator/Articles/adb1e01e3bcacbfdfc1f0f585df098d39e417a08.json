Examples of allhazards components of the plan include addressing liability issues for home health personnel, providing mental health support for disaster victims and home health staff, and establishing funding to cover uncompensated costs during an MCE. Although these issues are very important to emergency management and may have an indirect impact on infection transmission during an MCE, ensuring that these topics are addressed in a plan does not fall within the scope of duties of a home health agency's IP point of contact. Most IPs will act as a consultant to the home health emergency management planning committee and will be responsible for assessing the plan in terms of preventing infection transmission during MCEs. 7 IP involvement will be most important in developing and assessing the plan's biological annex.",

A plan needs to have an appendix or annex that addresses biological threats. In addition, certain infection prevention issues need to be addressed in the main body of the plan, such as having infection prevention policies and procedures in place during any type of MCE. This article addresses all components of the plan of interest to IPs who will be assessing home health agency emergency management plans, including the biological annex as well as the infection prevention issues that should be addressed in the main body of the plan. Home health agencies can use this article as a resource to guide the development or assessment of their emergency management plan for infection prevention issues. There is no perfect plan; the best plans are constantly under review and revision; thus, this article does not provide information on best practices related to all aspects of infection prevention during emergency management. In addition, procedures that work in one home health agency or region might not be applicable to all agencies. This article also can be consulted to identify gaps in emergency management plans. Guidance on how to implement specific interventions, such as developing a policy on sick leave during a disaster, or how to allocate limited amounts of respiratory protection is provided elsewehere. 20, 21 METHODS A literature review was conducted in July 2010 using the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, Healthstar, Psych Info, and MEDLINE databases for the years 1966-2010. The following terms were used as keyword searches: infection control, infection prevention, home health, readiness, disaster plan, mass casualties, bioterrorism, pandemic, and emergency management. Only English-language articles in peer-reviewed journals were considered. An Internet search was also conducted in July 2010 using the same search terms as above to identify existing book chapters, reports from response agencies, published standards and guidelines, and other relevant materials related to the development of home health emergency management plans to address biological MCEs that were outside the peer-reviewed literature. Inclusion criteria included articles, planning documents, and published reports that addressed infection prevention issues that need to be included in a plan. Articles that addressed hospital, community, public health, or personal preparedness were excluded. Also excluded were articles that only addressed non-infection prevention emergency management issues, such as developing policies and procedures for incorporating the incident command structure into the home health emergency management plan. Both US-based and non-US-based articles and documents/reports were included in the analysis.",

Table 1 presents the complete list of the infection prevention issues that should be addressed in a plan categorized by themes, or domains. Home health agency disaster planners can use this table as an assessment tool for evaluating their plans and developing policies and procedures aimed at decreasing the risk of infection transmission during an MCE. It is important to note that the information provided in this article consists of compiled published recommendations that are not considered mandates or regulations, except for the Joint Commission standards for accredited home health agencies. 30 Domain 1: Home health agency emergency management plan and biological annex A home health agency emergency management plan needs to address all biological threats, including bioterrorism, outbreaks of emerging infectious diseases, and pandemics. The plan must be updated regularly based on lessons learned from disaster exercises, actual events, and published evidence of best practices. The plan needs to be coordinated with local, state, and federal plans, and contact names and information for key response agencies need to be included. Lists of contact names and information should be evaluated and updated regularly to ensure accuracy. The plan's biological annex needs to define how biological events are different from other types of MCEs, how interventions will be stratified by pandemic stage/phase or nature of the biological attack, and the epidemiologic clues of a potential biological event.",

estimates regarding the quantities of essential patient care materials/equipment and PPE with local, regional, state, and tribal planning groups to better plan stockpiling agreements. 6,7 Describes procedures for obtaining and communicating infection prevention information when phone lines are not available. 34, 36 Includes pre-event messages and materials about the most likely biological agents to be involved in an MCE that can be communicated to staff, patients, and patients' household members/families during an MCE. 6 Surge capacity issues Has a plan for surge capacity to handle an influx of potentially contagious patients. 4, 6, 7, 12, 13, 17, 18, 23, 24, [29] [30] [31] 40 Estimates the quantities of essential patient care materials/equipment and PPE that would be needed for an 8-week period (ie, the estimated wave of a pandemic). Examples of patient care materials/equipment and PPE include intravenous pumps, ventilators, anti-infective therapy, vaccination, respiratory protection, gowns, gloves, eye protection, and hand hygiene products. 6, 7, 15, 17 Estimates the current staff shortages and staffing levels during an MCE. 4, 6, 7, 12, 15, 17, 23 Has a protocol for assessing and finding/supplying essential patient care materials/equipment and PPE stocks during an MCE. 3, 4, 6, 7, 12, 14, 15, [17] [18] [19] 24, 25, 29, 32, 34, 37, 39, 43, 45 Includes protocols for health care worker surge capacity that acknowledges that staff may be less willing or able to work during a biological event (due to health care worker illness or quarantine, family obligations, or fear leading to reluctance or refusal to work) and that more staff will be needed due to worker fatigue from wearing PPE for extended periods and has contingency plans for these types of situations. 4, 6, 7, 18, 19, 22, 24, 31, 33 Includes a protocol for maximizing staff's ability and willingness to work during an MCE, such as offering worker incentives and encouraging staff to have a personal disaster plan. 4, 6, 17, 28, 29 Anti-infective therapy, chemoprophylaxis, and vaccination Outlines procedures for establishing and/or maintaining a medication and vaccine stockpile, when applicable, and includes a protocol for coordinating with regional health care facilities or vendors to obtain additional anti-infective therapy supplies during an MCE. 4,17,18,32 Includes a prioritization plan for staff and their family members regarding who would be the first priority for anti-infective therapy, chemoprophylaxis, and vaccine during times of limited resources. 4,6,7,16-19,32 Has a protocol for identifying the most current recommendations and guidance on the use of anti-infective therapy and chemoprophylaxis needed for a biological event. 6,7,17,28 Has a protocol for expediting administration of anti-infective therapy, chemoprophylaxis, or vaccine to patients, staff, and/or staff's family as recommended by public health officials. 4, 6, 7, 14, [16] [17] [18] [19] 22, 29, 30, 32 Defines the role, if any, of the facility in a large-scale program to distribute anti-infective therapy, chemoprophylaxis, or vaccine to the general population, including patients' household members/families. 6, 7, 17, 18, 29, 30 Includes a protocol for performing follow-up monitoring and treatment of staff, patients, and/or patients' household members/families who received antiinfective therapy, chemoprophylaxis, or vaccine. 17, 29, 30 Includes security procedures as needed for control and administration of anti-infective therapy, chemoprophylaxis, or vaccine during MCEs or part of maintaining a stockpile. 17 ",

One aspect of surge capacity is assessing on-hand resources and calculating amounts that might be needed during an MCE. For biological MCEs, this could include the need for equipment and supplies that would last up to 8 weeks (the estimated wave of a pandemic). These estimates also should take into account that other health care agencies will be placing strains on the supply system during this period, and thus normal supply needs might not be met. Examples of resources that need to be assessed include antiinfective medications, vaccines, respiratory protection, gowns, gloves, eye protection, and hand hygiene products. The need for extra home health personnel will likely be greater during a biological MCE compared with other disasters, because staff may be less willing or able to work during a biological event. 4, 6, 24, 29, 31, 32 Factors that may influence health care workers' willingness and ability to work during a biological MCE include personal or family illness, family obligations, and fear of exposure or illness. 29 Whenever possible, home health agencies should provide incentives for staff to encourage them to work during an MCE; examples of incentives Table 1 .

Domain 8: Anti-infective therapy, chemoprophylaxis, and vaccination Medications will be needed for all types of MCEs, but biological events will require a disproportionate need for anti-infective medication and vaccines. The home health emergency management plan should include calculations for determining the amounts that will be needed during a biological event. Home health agencies should be aware of community resources and specify procedures for accessing local, state, or federal stockpiles during an MCE. 17 Agencies also should consider developing and maintaining a stockpile of anti-infective agents and vaccines. The plan also should define a prioritization plan for staff regarding who would be the first priority for anti-infective therapy, chemoprophylaxis, and vaccine during periods of limited resources. A procedure is needed for identifying the most current recommendations and guidance on the use of anti-infective therapy and chemoprophylaxis required for a biological event, given that these guidelines quickly become outdated. 7 The home health agency emergency management plan should outline procedures for administering antiinfective therapy, chemoprophylaxis, or vaccine to staff, patients, and patients' household members/ families, along with protocols for follow-up monitoring as needed.",
