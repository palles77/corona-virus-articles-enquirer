The North, therefore, serves as a sentinel and a complementary window, relative to temperate and tropical environments, for assessing the cascading ecologic effects of global climate change. Within relatively simple northern ecosystems, it is possible to differentiate signals of climate change from those associated with nonclimatologic drivers. Consequently, the North is a vital frontier for the exploration of biotic, abiotic, and historical determinants that infl uence the distribution, host associations, and evolution of pathogens in wildlife and human populations (4, 6, 9, 10) .",

            "text": "Host-parasite systems are particularly sensitive indicators of climate change and other causes of ecologic perturbation (3, 11) . Many macroparasites (e.g., helminths and arthropods) undergo life cycles with free-living stages whose development and survival are infl uenced by temperature, among other abiotic factors (2, 6) . For example, small changes in absolute temperatures can have substantial effects on the transmission dynamics of protostrongylid lungworms and muscleworms (species of Parelaphostrongylus, Protostrongylus, and Umingmakstrongylus), which cycle among the environment, gastropod (slug and snail) intermediate hosts, and ungulate (caribou, muskoxen, thinhorn sheep, moose) defi nitive hosts ( Figure 1 ). These parasites are pathogenic in wildlife important to northern communities for cultural, economic, and spiritual reasons (4) . The importance of keystone wildlife (those critical for the function and continuity of ecosystems and northern peoples), the potential sensitivity of host-pathogen assemblages to environmental disturbance, and the present and predicted scale of accelerated climate change and cascading ecologic (although offi cially  designated International Polar Year 2007-2008) , offers a unique opportunity to develop a baseline, or snapshot, of the North and to explore the patterns and processes for infectious disease emergence in northern ecosystems that are globally relevant. As a contribution to this baseline, we outline approaches, protocols, and empirical models derived from a decade of exploration of pathogen biodiversity and disease in northern ecosystems (Table 1) , illustrated with examples of drivers for emerging parasitic disease in northern wildlife ( Table 2) . Categories of emergence explored in our studies include 1) geographic expansion, 2) host switching, 3) resurgence due to climate change, 4) new introduction, and 5) new recognition of pathogens. This approach can be viewed as a broadly applicable framework for defi ning pathogen diversity, including distinguishing what is truly emerging from what is newly discovered, and the historical and contemporary drivers associated with emerging infectious diseases in the North and elsewhere in the world. This ecologic approach to understanding disease emergence in wildlife complements a growing recognition of the need for long-term epidemiologic datasets to detect the effects of climate change on human health (8) . Collectively, these constitute a critical sentinel for the interaction of climate and infectious disease in the global arena.",

Further complications arose from the absence of properly preserved and documented parasite specimens and the specialized knowledge needed to identify such specimens to the species level. To identify parasite species in wildlife across extensive geographic ranges in remote northern locations, we developed molecular probes for the identifi cation of larval parasites in feces. We used these techniques to redefi ne the distribution of a parasite (Parelaphostrongylus odocoilei) in multiple host species across northwestern North America (15) and to detect at least 1 new protostrongylid species in moose, muskoxen, and caribou in northern North America (20; Figure  2 ); these fell within the category of emergence of new recognition of a pathogen. In addition, by using a combination of morphologic and molecular methods of identifi cation, we detected a host switch of a lungworm (Protostrongylus stilesi) from Dall sheep to sympatric muskoxen (21) (category of emergence: host switching).",

Adult nematodes (for U. pallikuukensis, located in the lungs) lay eggs, which hatch to fi rst-stage larvae (L1). L1 move up the airways, are swallowed, and pass in the feces, where they must invade the foot of gastropod intermediate hosts for further development to the infective third-stage larvae (L3). Development to L3 requires a minimum amount of heating and does not occur below a critical threshold; these development parameters vary among different protostrongylid species (6, 7, 13) . Defi nitive hosts become infected by ingesting a gastropod containing L3 or, for some protostrongylids such as U. pallikuukensis, by ingesting L3 that have emerged from the gastropods and are free in the environment.",

            "text": "A broader understanding of the drivers for infectious disease emergence is in part dependent on appreciating why pathogens occur in particular regional settings and host groups, which is in turn determined by evolutionary and ecologic constraints that have structured pathogen diversity in space and time (11,22,23; Table 2 ). Our interpretations of current host and geographic distributions of northern parasites have been guided by a strong foundation in historical processes, both recent and deep (10 thousand years before present [KYBP] to 5 million years before present [MYBP]) (9, 18, 22) . For example, the current focal distribution of the Arctic-adapted lungworm U. pallikuukensis in a circumscribed population of muskoxen ( Figure 2 ) is attributed to recent host extirpation and reduction to a remnant population in the early 1900s, primarily as a result of hunting (12, 14) . In contrast, deeper historical processes (600-300 KYBP) account for widespread distribution of the lungworm P. stilesi in wild sheep, which entered North America across Beringia, the land mass that historically joined North America and Siberia (10, 24) . The muscleworm P. odocoilei has a more heterogeneous distribution in wild sheep because these hosts were colonized relatively recently (late Pleistocene) in a host-switching event from deer (Odocoileus hemionus), probably when the 2 species were concentrated in glacial refugia, and later expanded northwards following deglaciation (categories of emergence: host switching and geographic expansion) (15,24; I. Asmundsson, E.P. Hoberg, E.J. Jenkins, unpub. data). Table 1 . Approaches and tools for exploring diversity and changes in complex host-parasite systems Definition of pathogen diversity 1) Geographically extensive and site intensive survey and inventory 2) Determination of faunal diversity for species present, for which systematics is the foundation 3) Patterns of association for hosts 4) Geographic range for hosts and parasites 5) Numerical, abundance/ intensity data 6) Seasonal data for distribution and patterns of transmission 7) Survey linking parasite species diversity to population structure requiring integrated morphologic and molecular approaches for accurate and rapid diagnostics 8) Molecular prospecting for diversity 9) Distribution of parasites versus distribution of disease Development of historical baselines 1) Archival museum collections 2) Host-parasite phylogenetic frameworks 3) Historical ecology and biogeography/phylogeography to clarify past abiotic and biotic determinants of distribution 4) Geographic information system applications 5) Analogue approaches to be applied where historical processes that have structured faunas are used to inform or predict the responses of contemporary systems under a regime of dynamic climate change Exploration of environmental effects 1) Define thresholds and rates for development 2) Define tolerances for environmental parameters, e.g., temperature, humidity, precipitation 3) Define environmental limitations on distribution Characterization of disease conditions 1) Laboratory-based experimental infections in parasite na\u00efve hosts 2) Pathology and histology 3) Evaluations of natural mortality and associations with parasites Establishment of surveillance networks and monitoring 1) Targeted strategic survey and inventory 2) Opportunistic networks linking wildlife managers and communities Development and testing of predictive models 1) Integrative frameworks incorporating data from survey, parasite diversity, historical analogues, environmental thresholds, tolerances and constraints 2) Responses under scenarios for climatologic/environmental change 3) Validation through long-term monitoring Knowledge of phylogeny of pathogens and co-evolutionary processes for parasites and hosts provides powerful insights about life cycles, host specifi city, and site specifi city within the host and the potential for emergence (3, 11, 22, 23) . For example, knowledge of the relationship and behavior of related parasites provided immediate information on the likely life history of U. pallikuukensis (12, 14) and site specifi city and potential hosts for P. odocoilei (17) and is now guiding our search for adults of a previously undescribed protostrongylid (20) . Finally, we have a unique window into the past to examine historical diversity and phylogeny as pathogens in frozen feces of caribou and other northern wildlife species (both extant and extinct) emerge from receding ice packs-a natural cryoarchive. Whether these ancient pathogens represent a risk for reemergence of disease remains undetermined (25) .",

This is especially true in the North, where the sheer size and diversity of the geographic areas, low densities and isolation of human communities, and remote study areas hamper year-round observation of illness and death in wildlife. Therefore, we recruited local community members and hunters to create a network of \"wildlife health monitors,\" who are trained to collect standardized samples and data to develop baselines for wildlife health over time (http://wildlife1.usask.ca/ sahtu/monitors.php). Even if a decline in a wildlife population is detected and documented, the role of disease can be diffi cult to tease from an array of complex ecologic relationships. Therefore, to isolate the effects of single pathogens and evaluate subclinical disease, we experimentally infected captive wildlife and monitored them by using a variety of veterinary clinical techniques (24, 26) .",

Infected animals exhibit epistaxis and may be more susceptible to predation (12, 14) . In wild sheep, P. odocoilei causes diffuse, pulmonary granulomas that can lead to respiratory failure in heavily infected or otherwise compromised animals. Experimentally infected sheep exhibited marked weight loss and transient neurologic signs, which, together with decreased respiratory function, would compromise their ability to escape predation at high altitudes and over rough terrain (24, 26) . Also, respiratory pathology may result from synergy of P. odocoilei with the lungworm P. stilesi because both parasites are present in almost all wild sheep in some regions (24, 26) .

For step 2, fi eld and laboratory experiments showed specifi c tolerances and thresholds and a direct relationship between temperature and development of U. pallikuukensis and P. odocoilei in intermediate hosts (7, 12) . For step 3, historical temperature data demonstrated that the core region for our studies (the Mackenzie District of the Northwest Territories) had the highest rate of warming in Canada (60-year warming trend of 2.2\u00b0C in annual temperature; www.msc-smc.ec.gc.ca/ccrm/bulletin/ annual06/regional_e.cfm), and that warming available for parasite development had already increased at multiple sites in the Canadian Arctic (4,6,7). For step 4, a model for temperature and rates of larval development in gastropod intermediate hosts was validated for these protostrongylids and applied to climate warming scenarios (6, 7) . Based on these projections, we determined that climate warming led to substantial amplifi cation of parasite populations in disease-endemic areas through reduction in generation times and broadened seasonal windows for transmission, contributing to heightened intensity of infection among individual hosts (4, 6, 7) . Climate change also may result in release of some \"generalist\" parasites (e.g., P. odocoilei) from environmental constraints, which, in combination with a breakdown in mechanisms for ecologic isolation, could facilitate range expansion and colonization of na\u00efve hosts (2 categories of emerging infectious disease) (7).",

Following the warmest recorded annual temperature for this region 14 Emerging Infectious Diseases \u2022 www.cdc.gov/eid \u2022 Vol. 14, No. 1, January 2008 (19, 20) ; P. odocoilei in wild thinhorn sheep, mountain goat, woodland caribou, black-tailed deer, and mule deer (15, 17) ; Umingmakstrongylus pallikuukensis in muskoxen (12, 14) ; and a putative new species of Protostrongylidae in moose, caribou, and muskoxen (20) . The range for P. andersoni in the North is presumed to coincide with caribou, although records substantiated by survey are few (19, 20) . Protostrongylids have not been detected in ungulates from the Arctic islands and Greenland and may be excluded from these high latitudes under current climate conditions. in 1998 (www.msc-smc.ec.gc.ca/ccrm/bulletin/annual06/ rsummarytable_e.html?table=temperature&season=annual &date=2006&nyears=59), fatal pneumonia associated with P. odocoilei was fi rst detected in wild sheep in the Mackenzie Mountains in 1999, although this may refl ect increased vigilance rather than true emergence. Emergence of disease may follow climate change, but for macroparasites in particular, there are likely to be lag times determined by a period of development in the host population (30) . Cascading and cumulative long-term effects of climate change, including shifts in host-pathogen relationships, may be among the factors contributing to large-scale changes in abundance and distribution observed in keystone wildlife (e.g., boreal woodland and barren-ground caribou) in northern North America.",

Climate change will affect northern ecosystems by altering host range (i.e., expansions, shifts, increased or decreased overlap), abundance, and resilience, in addition to availability of environmental contaminants, free-living stages of pathogens, and intermediate hosts/vectors (Table 2) . Climate change may also interact with other drivers for infectious disease emergence in northern North America. These include 1) development of new ecotones related to expansion of southern animal species, such as deer, red fox, and domestic livestock; 2) altered routes and timing of migration for wild birds and caribou herds; 3) habitat alteration and fragmentation due to resource extraction and development; and 4) historical and ongoing translocation of hosts and pathogens (e.g., historical introductions of reindeer and muskoxen, natural expansion of existing wood bison populations, proposed reestablishment of wood bison in Alaska, and increasing interest in livestock production in the North). The cumulative implications for health of wildlife that are culturally and economically important for northern communities are unlikely to be positive (37) . In addition, environmental change is predicted to drive increased dissemination of zoonotic pathogens in water-and foodborne pathways (e.g., Giardia, Cryptosporidium, Toxoplasma, Trichinella, and Echinococcus spp.), posing a direct threat to human health in communities that rely on local water sources and country foods; environmental change may also lead to emergence of disease resulting from \"spillover\" of pathogens between persons and wildlife (8, 16, (37) (38) (39) .",

Long-term cumulative processes may be the drivers for changing dynamics between hosts and pathogens (e.g., generation time, developmental rates, amplifi cation, shifts in seasonal transmission) and create subtle effects that will be challenging to demonstrate in the absence of extensive baselines (4,6,7). Incremental and gradual increases in temperature may drive thresholds or tipping points infl uencing the interface for hosts and parasites (6) . In contrast, extreme weather events of temperature and humidity, as an outcome of climate change, are predicted to result in a mosaic of ephemeral or explosive emergence of disease against this broader background. Signals for these patterns have already been demonstrated in the Arctic (30, 40) .",

These drivers are not unique to the North; they are in action in scenarios all over the world (8) . Wildlife pathogens, or diseases originating in wildlife, are emerging as a considerable threat to human health worldwide (e.g., severe acute respiratory syndrome, HIV/AIDS, Ebola, Hendra, Nipah, and avian infl uenza viruses) (2,23; www.cws-scf.ec.gc.ca/cnwds/intro_ e.cfm). While our work focused on a nonzoonotic group of pathogenic nematodes, our integrated, multidisciplinary approach can be extrapolated to investigate a broader diversity of pathogens in the North and anywhere else where the animal-human interface is intact or expanding ( Table  1) . The North has emerged as a region of great interest because of the historical interaction between people and wildlife, the current impact of climate change on northern ecosystems, and the future importance of the natural resources (both renewable and nonrenewable) in this region.",
