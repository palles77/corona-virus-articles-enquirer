As a higher sensitivity and specificity method than reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), the RT-LAMP method only used a turbidimeter, exhibited a detection limit corresponding to a 10 -4 dilution of template RNA extracted from 250 \u00b5L of 10 5 of the 50% tissue culture infective dose (TCID 50 ) of PRRSV-containing cells, and no cross-reactivity was observed with other related viruses including porcine circovirus type 2, swine influenza virus, porcine rotavirus and classical swine fever virus. From forty-two field samples, 33 samples in the RT-LAMP assay was detected positive, whereas three of which were not detected by RT-PCR. Furthermore, in 33 strains of PRRSV, an identical detection rate was observed with the RT-LAMP assay to what were isolated using porcine alveolar macrophages.These findings demonstrated that the RT-LAMP assay has potential clinical applications for the detection of highly pathogenic PRRSV isolates, especially in developing countries.",

It is characterized by reproductive failure, respiratory disease and various clinical signs including loss of appetite, fever, dyspnea and mild neurological symptoms [5, 17] . There are two major PRRSV genotypes [10] , referred to as North American and European, and the North American genotype is predominant in China. Previous studies have shown that the non-structural protein 2 (nsp2) coding gene, in particular the central region of this gene, may contribute largely to the genetic variation in PRRSV genomes, while high conservation is exhibited in the N-terminal putative protease domain and the C-terminal predicted transmembrane region [18] . In addition, the Nsp2 protein of PRRSV possesses potential enzymatic function, although this was shown to be highly heterogeneous and variable 253 [15] . Since the first widespread outbreak of PRRS in China in 2006, atypical PRRS, caused by variations in PRRSV strain VR2332, has been reported in more than 10 Chinese provinces and regions [9] .",

This method offers the advantages of simplicity and sensitivity, which can be performed in one step, in real time. Reverse transcription (RT)-LAMP relies on an auto-cycling strand displacement DNA synthesis reaction performed using the Bst DNA polymerase large fragment under isothermal conditions at a temperature of between 60\u00b0C and 65\u00b0C, which enables the amplification reaction to be performed in a heating block without the need for precise centralized laboratory facilities [3] . This technique is high specificity because the target sequence is recognized by six independent sequences in the initial stage and by four independent sequences during the later stages of the RT-LAMP reaction. This method generates ascendant turbidity in positive samples, allowing detection by the naked eye or real-time monitoring.",

Although reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) is a highly sensitive and specific method, the dependence on specialized equipment limits its use in the field or in basic laboratories [2, 6] . The development of molecular detection methods to simplify the diagnosis procedure is of great importance. RT-LAMP is a one-step assay that does not require a cDNA synthesis step, simplifying the method and decreasing the risk of contamination [18] . The use of three primer pairs corresponding to six target sequences in the RT-LAMP assay was conferred high specificity but can also make primer design a challenge in viruses The PRRSV RT-LAMP assay described in this study showed greater specificity than conventional RT-PCR. There was no cross-reactivity between PRRSV and other related viruses, such as CSFV strain CHLV, PCV2, PRV and SIV, which suggeated that the method was highly specific. In addition, RT-LAMP is a simple and rapid procedure, providing results within 1 h, which is significantly quicker than conventional RT-PCR. Of the 33 positive samples detected by RT-LAMP, three were missed by RT-PCR. Furthermore, restriction analysis allowed for the specific detection of highly pathogenic PRRSV strains. In summary, we have constructed a rapid, sensitive RT-LAMP assay for PRRSV detection that has the potential to be applied to on-the-spot detection in the field.",

The gel was then stained with ethidium bromide and visualized on a UV transilluminator at 302 nm. To further differentiate highly pathogenic North American PRRSV strains from the prototypic VR-2332 strain, RT-LAMP amplification products were digested with SupI at 37\u00b0C for 1 h and then analyzed by 1.5% agarose gel electrophoresis. For real-time monitoring of the RT-LAMP assay, the reaction mixture was incubated at 63.5\u00b0C for 60 min in a Loopamp real-time turbidimeter LA-320 (Eiken, Japan). Detection was performed via spectrophotometric analysis by recording the optical density (OD) at 650 nm every 6 s using the Loopamp real-time turbidimeter. PRRSV strains VR-2332, GD, BJ and JX, and water as a negative control, were used as templates and were analyzed by the RT-LAMP assay. Turbidity was assessed, and samples that exhibited an increase in OD of over 0.05 and an OD of greater than 0.25 within 50 min were considered positive. None of the negative controls had a turbidity signal of greater than 0.05 within 50 min. Sensitivity and Specificity of the RT-LAMP assay for the detection of PRRSV To assess the specificity of the RT-LAMP assay for the detection of PRRSV, DNA of PCV2 and PRV and RNA of PRRSV, swine influenza virus (SIV) and CSFV strain CHLV was extracted and used as the template for the PRRSV RT-LAMP assay. Following DNA and RNA extraction, cross-reactions of PRRSV RT-LAMP with PCV2, PRV and SIV were performed. The reactions were then analyzed with the Loopamp real-time turbidimeter, incubated at 63.5\u00b0C for 60 min.
