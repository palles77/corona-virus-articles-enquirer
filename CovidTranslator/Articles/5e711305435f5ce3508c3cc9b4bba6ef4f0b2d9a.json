Practice often makes perfect, builds confidence and comradery among players and streamlines the incident management response process. Drill scenario testing on a frequent basis cannot be overemphasized enough. Firesafety (discussed in Chapter 12, Fire Prevention and Protection), and emergency (contingency) planning is designed to anticipate what might happen to endanger people, physical assets, and information (thus causing damage and interruption to normal business) and to take the necessary preventive measures and make provision-through the use of appropriate hardware and/or personnel response-for prompt and effective action when an emergency does occur. While the emphasis in this chapter (as in most actual practice) is on physical safeguards, it is important to emphasize the human aspect. Disastrous losses often occur not from the failure or absence of physical safeguards, but from human error-the failure to close a fire door, to maintain existing protection systems in good working condition, to inspect or to report hazards, and, at the management level, to ensure through continuous employee education and training that the organization remains prepared at any time for any emergency. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), National Fire Protection Association (NFPA), and Life Safety Codes dictate certain safety requirements for all businesses.",

Essentially, contingency planners work to prepare their business, organization, or institution to be better able to mitigate any disruption to normal business activities. As an example, if a natural occurrence (e.g., hurricane, fire, or earthquake) disrupts normal business activities, having plans in place for responding to and recovering from such an occurrence will allow for a faster resumption of business, thus reducing the amount of time the business is disrupted.",

Contingencies interrupt normal business activities. In some cases the disruption is minor, while in other situations the disruption can be catastrophic. \u2022 Contingency planning: The process of planning for response, recovery and resumption activities for the infrastructure, critical processes, and other elements of an organization based upon encountering different contingencies. \u2022 Crisis and incident management: The process of managing events of a crisis to a condition of stability and ultimate recovery. This is proactively accomplished by local, regional, corporate, and executive incident management response teams working hand in hand to successfully manage the incident. The \"step up\" or \"step down\" process is a key element of the incident response process. Let us take, for example, local flooding in a foreign country where the infrastructure cannot handle large amounts of rain from a typhoon. When conditions deteriorate \"locally,\" one would \"step up\", and C3 the incident from the \"regional\" level. However, this does not preclude the local, regional, corporate, and executive incident management teams from activing simultaneously. \u2022 Critical processes: Activities performed by functions, departments, or elements within a business or organization that, if significantly disrupted due to an incident, emergency, or disaster, would have an adverse impact on organizational operations, revenue generation ability, production, and/or distribution schedules, contractual commitments, or legal obligations. \u2022 Emergency response: The act of reporting and responding to any emergency or major disruption of the business organization's operations. \u2022 The Situation Watch Protocol: Chasing not pacing the world of incidents is not an optimal strategy for a company. Hence the birth of the Situation Watch protocol. This protocol demands that incidents are proactively monitored and communicated to key business partners when there is a potential-tangential or direct impact on a company that may need to be incident managed. In fact, most incidents are predictable. For example, if a company is housed within the pacific ring of fire it is easy to understand that there will be earthquakes followed by a potential tsunami. Take, for example, Superstorm Sandy in 2012 which caused severe flooding along the eastern seaboard of the United States. It first began as a tropical wave in the Caribbean then formed into a tropical storm easily monitored and easily communicated. That in a nutshell is the Situation Watch protocol in action. More specifically, proactively monitoring and communicating a potential incident from its inception. In this case, monitoring, tracking, communicating, and then proactively responding to Superstorm Sandy before it is at a Company's door step.",

            "text": "\u2022 Assumptions: Basic assumptions need to be developed in order to establish contingency planning ground rules. As a baseline for planning, it is best to use several possible \"worstcase\" scenarios relative to time of event, type of event, available resources, building/ facility occupancy, evacuation of personnel, personnel stranded on site, and environmental factors such as weather conditions and temperature. Furthermore, consideration should be given to establishing response parameters for emergency events. Define (for your enterprise) what constitutes a minor emergency, a major emergency, and a disaster. \u2022 Risk assessment and vulnerability analysis: Identify known and apparent vulnerabilities and risks associated with the type of business and geographic location of the enterprise. An assessment of risk and vulnerabilities should be made prior to developing or upgrading contingency plans. All planning will be accomplished in accordance with a thorough understanding of actual and potential risks and vulnerabilities. For example, in a petroleum refining facility, contingency plans for petroleum spillage, contamination, and fires must be considered. Furthermore, if located in an earthquake zone, planning must address associated hazards. The risk assessment and vulnerability analysis must also include an assessment of enterprise\u00c0critical relationships. That means involving suppliers and customers in the contingency planning process. If a critical supplier or many key suppliers are not also prepared for various potential contingencies, their inability to recover will adversely impact your enterprise. \u2022 Types of hazards: Planning for each and every type of hazard is not practical, nor desirable. Grouping them into similar or like categories will allow for planning to address categories of hazards which can easily be categorized as natural occurrences, health/ pandemic, infrastructure, and social, civil or political disruption. Since many hazards have similar consequences and result in like damages, it is best to plan for them in categories. Tornados. \u2022 Critical process identification: Critical processes must be ranked in accordance of criticality and importance to the productivity and survivability of the enterprise. Process of recovery must be focused on those critical processes that, when resumed, will restore operations to a minimal acceptable level. In essence, these processes are identified to be the first processes restored in the event of a major interruption to business operations. Failure to restore them presents the greatest possibility of damage or loss to the enterprise and could lead to the loss of a competitive edge, market share, or even the viability of the enterprise. \u2022 Business impact analysis: A business impact analysis must be accomplished to accurately determine the financial and operational impact that could result from an interruption of enterprise operations. Moreover, all critical interdependencies, those processes or activities critical processes are dependent upon, must be assessed to determine the extent to which they must be part of the contingency planning process. \u2022 Emergency response: All participants in the emergency response process, particularly emergency responders, must understand their role. Expectations and responsibilities of emergency response personnel must be well defined and documented. Guidance for all employees on how to react in the event of an emergency and what their individual and collective responsibilities are must be documented and shared. Organizational responsibilities must also be established, to include the development of department-level emergency plans, generally for mid-size and large organizations. Events such as building evacuation and roll-call assembly need to be well defined so, in the event of an actual emergency, there is no confusion or uncertainty as to what must be accomplished. \u2022 Incident management or crisis management: As an incident escalates, a crisis management team (CMT) should assume responsibility for managing the crisis. If the crisis is international or global in nature, it is important that the incident response process is fluid to address it. For example, activing a local or regional team and stepping up or stepping down as necessary as was discussed in a prior section of this chapter. How this process works and who has what responsibilities must be clearly stated in the contingency plans. In the event of an actual emergency, some unqualified people will attempt to manage the incident or participate in crisis management; however, they should not have any role in this process unless they were previously identified and trained as part of the CMT. Without established and well-defined incident management protocols and procedures, confusion is likely to erupt. It must be clear at all times who is the designated incident commander and his or her back up if necessary with C3 for the incident. Essentially, incident management, and crisis management personnel must be trained and must understand their responsibilities including decision-making authority in the teeth of a crisis real time. Without this authority, the timely response to an incident gets booged down in the bureaucratic quagmire which could jeopardize employee safety and well-being. Lastly and where here practical, back-up supporting personnel should be identified and trained in the event that primary personnel are not available. \u2022 Incident/event analysis: After an event occurs and the situation is stable, an analysis of what occurred and why should be conducted to determine the immediate extent of damage and the potential for subsequent additional damage. \u2022 Business resumption planning: The process of planning to facilitate recovery of designated critical processes and the resumption of business in the event of an interruption to the business should be performed in two parts. The first part focuses on business recovery in the short term while the other part focuses on business restoration in the long term. This process will also include establishment of priorities for restoration of critical processes, infrastructure, and information systems. \u2022 Post-event evaluation: An assessment of preceding events to determine what went well, what did not go so well, and what improvements to existing plans need to be made must also be part of the process. Learning from real events is an unfortunate opportunity.",

From a medical emergency in which an employee becomes injured or sick, to a natural or person-made disaster causing extensive damage to buildings and equipment, being prepared to respond will usually lessen the damage or impact of the event. Preparedness takes many forms. Being prepared to respond to a medical emergency is different from being prepared to respond to a natural disaster. The medical emergency may only require applying first aid to a victim or it may require the assistance and services of medical professionals. A natural disaster may require support from emergency medical services along with law enforcement, fire departments, search and rescue operations, and hazardous material crews. When planning for emergencies, types of emergencies should be grouped into like categories so that planning is accomplished for only categories of emergencies, as opposed to each and every possible emergency occurrence.

Public address systems are particularly useful during emergencies when a building or facility evacuation is just the opposite of what is needed. For example, in the event of a chemical discharge or other environmental hazard, it may be necessary to keep people inside the facility and shut down all air movement systems, thus preventing employees from exposure to hazardous airborne substances. Since employees are conditioned to evacuate a building or facility when a fire alarm is sounded, they can be conditioned to wait and listen for specific instructions provided over a public address system. New to the market in 2017 are Internet Protocol (IP)-based public address systems. Public not in the traditional sense but rather internet sense in that the address protocol works integrally with your desk phone and smartphone and will \"chase you down\" by communicating to multiple devices. \u2022 Emergency Response Team (ERT) Leads: The use of employees to augment the emergency notification system has much value. Specially selected and trained employees can be given responsibility to act during an emergency to spread the word to evacuate a building or facility during an emergency. Assigning each a specific area of responsibility, the ERT Leads ensures complete coverage of the building or facility. Communications between floor ERT Leads and emergency response personnel or a security emergency operations center can be easily established. ERT Leads can be alerted by IP technology solutions radio, smartphone, or other means in the event of an emergency and be instructed to react to the specific situation. ERT Leads can and should be empowered and trained to react on their own in the event they recognize danger. Authority should be provided to ERT Leads to evacuate a building or facility based upon their judgment and assessment of an emergency situation. In the event of a complete communications failure, it may be necessary to empower them to dispatch people to a safe environment. \u2022 Response to emergencies: Since security officers are located throughout the facility and operate on different shifts, they are usually the first to respond as often times they are the eyes and ears to an event unfolding or one that just occurred. Being on the front lines, the security officer can assess the situation and make a determination if additional assistance is necessary. In some cases, they may not be able to make an assessment and may require support from others. For example, in the event of a hazardous chemical spill, it will be necessary to have an expert in environmental and safety issues on the scene to make the assessment. It may even be necessary for a hazardous materials (HAZMAT) crew to respond to handle the event. Clean up of a chemical spill should only be done by skilled and certified personnel. Another example may be the unfortunate death of an employee in the workplace. This will require the security officer to make immediate notification to OSHA as well as cordoning off the scene and directing law enforcement to the scene. In rare cases, it may require the preservation of evidence and stand by for the corner to clear to the body. Clearly, defining who has what response capabilities and responsibilities will impact the effectiveness of any response. Without a doubt, capable and training security officers are a key ingredient to the efficient handling of the incident management response process. \u2022 Department-specific emergency plans: It is best to have one emergency response plan for each company facility. These plans should be incorporated into a master plan and provide a common framework. A key subelement of an emergency plan is the individual departments' emergency plans.

If the incident escalates to a crisis, a company CMT should be convened to manage the crisis. The senior emergency response person, when at the scene, should manage the incident with the assistance of specialists as appropriate. \u2022 Evacuation and assembly: A critical objective during any emergency is employee safety. In the event it is necessary to evacuate a building or facility, having an established and orderly process is essential. Once a warning system sounds the notice to evacuate, employees must be aware of preestablished procedures for quick evacuation, including primary and alternate evacuation routes and where they should assemble. Maps or diagrams with this information should be included in the plan and posted throughout the work area. A floor warden or an employee with the assignment to facilitate evacuation should make a sweep of the area prior to their own evacuation to ensure all personnel have exited the building or facility. Once in the predetermined assembly area, a roll call must be taken. Primary, secondary, and tertiary responsibilities should be assigned to ensure someone is available to take roll call and report the results to security. If someone did not evacuate the facility, a search-and-rescue team or other emergency personnel may be required to reenter the facility and provide assistance. \u2022 Emergency evacuation drills: The efficient and complete evacuation of personnel from a building or facility in the event of an emergency is such an important event that periodic drills should be conducted to reinforce the process and its importance. At least annually, each building or facility should undergo an evacuation drill where employees respond to a warning and completely evacuate the building or facility. This may be required by law in some states or jurisdictions. Lastly, a roll call should be conducted and results reported to security and senior management. \u2022 Search and rescue: In the event of serious damage such as a fire or collapse of building, it may be necessary to search and account for employees. Search and rescue is the responsibility of responding emergency personnel who have proper protective equipment such as the fire department persons not trained in search-and-rescue techniques or who do not have proper equipment should not enter hazardous areas and conduct searches. Heavy lifting should always be left to the professionals such as properly trained search and rescue teams and fire department personnel. Heavy lifting in this context means security personnel should not supplant the proven experience of responding agencies and do it themselves without the proper training. This can cause critical delays in response and could even jeopardize lives. At its core, the job of the security officer is to observe and report. \u2022 Return to work: The process for returning to work after a crisis should also be included in the emergency plan. After any incident where employees are required to leave their work area and evacuate a building or facility, a process for having them return to work is necessary. For example, in the event of a false fire alarm where employees have evacuated a building, a means of communicating to them an all-clear, safe to return to work signal, is needed. This can be accomplished in many ways. Public address announcements can be made or security personnel can go to assembly areas, directing employees to return to work the good old fashion way by use of a bull horn. As appropriate, other methods may also be employed such as IP-based communication systems. In the event there is actual damage and employees cannot return to work, a process should be established identifying who makes the decision to send employees home-most likely Human Resources-as well as how that is communicated to them and how they are kept apprised of event updates. For example, if a building was severely damaged due to fire and cannot be occupied for several days, posting daily direction and guidance for employees on the company website or on an emergency toll-free phone line will allow employees to call each day for specific instructions. For this to be effective, employees must know this process, must know the phone number to call or website to access and, as with all other processes, this one must be updated regularly. Extended remote work authorization can also be of great assistance to a company keeping it operating efficiently while longer term infrastructure needs are addressed. This type of remote work authorization especially works well where natural occurrences most happen such as severe snow storms, hurricanes (when evacuation is not necessary), and typhoons. In some instances, keeping employees at home working remote while there is civil, social, and political unrest can save lives by keeping employees off the roads or away from the office. \u2022 After action: When any incident occurs that necessitates evacuation or results in injuries, major damage, or presents the possibility of major business interruption, an after action report must be prepared. The primary focus is twofold:",

Emergency response personnel at the scene of an incident manage the incident. If the incident escalates, becoming a crisis, it is then necessary to have a different group take charge.

            "text": "When an incident escalates into a crisis, the situation becomes more complex, affecting different aspects of the business if not the entire business and requiring different skills to manage it. Employees with a broad understanding of the enterprise and its mission, goals, and objectives are much better suited to manage a crisis than those with a more narrow perspective of the business. Ideally, a CMT is like an integrated process team. Skilled professionals representing different disciplines come together on a short-term basis to work on a specific issue or tasking. In the case of CMTs, the task is to serve as a deliberative body to plan and prepare for a crisis and, when a crisis occurs, manage that crisis so as to mitigate damage or its impact. CMTs should include members with expertise in the following areas: security, human resources, site management, safety and environmental and safety services, business management and communications. \u2022 Disaster operations: In the event of a crisis or disaster, it is to be expected that some personnel may not be able to immediately leave the site. For example, following an earthquake the surrounding area may not be safe for travel. Employees may have no choice but to seek shelter at the workplace for hours or days. Furthermore, emergency personnel may be needed on site for an extended period to assist in recovery operations. Being prepared to deal with this or similar scenarios is essential. Preparation will include ensuring sufficient supplies are on hand to meet the needs of a reasonable number of stranded or support personnel. It is necessary to ensure that sufficient food, water, medical supplies and emergency sanitation, and shelter facilities are available. All of these items can be acquired and placed in a long-term storage condition, providing they are regularly checked for serviceability, spoilage, and maintained within the expected shelf life. During a crisis, much uncertainty exists. Consequently, it will be necessary to communicate to employees, keeping them as up to date as possible about the situation and events and providing guidance concerning their safety and work expectations. During a crisis, employees are naturally anxious. Prompt and clear communications can help reduce this anxiety and keep employees informed. Communication may need to extend beyond the duration of a crisis into an undefined subsequent period. Using the previously referred to emergency contact and notification number, or company Web site, can be very effective. Messages can be updated regularly as needed so the information is current. Also, information broadcast on local news radio stations can reach a large population of employees. At the point in time where an incident escalates into a crisis, the CMTs become involved, managing the crisis to closure. At some point during a crisis, a deescalation of events will occur and eventually the crisis will terminate. If the impact or damage from the crisis is significant, the CMT will commence with restoration activities. These activities may be led by the CMT or passed on to a business continuity team. How this can work will be discussed further in the next section. \u2022 Media relations: During a crisis, it is possible that the local, national, or even international media will become interested in events. For example, large industrial fires always draw the attention of local media. Natural disasters also draw much media attention. Even isolated events such as incidents of workplace violence can draw significant media attention. It is therefore important to have a media relations plan. The company media representative should be part of the company CMT. Since there is always a degree of unpredictability during a crisis, it is best that all CMT members understand how to deal with the media and be prepared should they be thrust into such a situation. \u2022 Damage assessment: During a crisis, emergency personnel will make ongoing damage assessments, reporting status back to the CMT. These assessments are useful in determining actions to be taken next. However, these assessments are situational and due to the circumstances and nature of a crisis, do not have the luxury of thoroughness. The true extent of damage is not determined until after the crisis has terminated and a complete building, facility or site assessment can be made. Immediately following a crisis, a damage assessment for infrastructure safety and functionality must be made. Without this, a return-to-work decision cannot be made. The damage assessment is also the starting point for all restoration and resumption activities. \u2022 Business continuity team: Earlier reference was made to the transition of responsibility from a CMT to a business continuity team. This is an important step in the effort to resume business. While the CMT's focus is on managing through the crisis, the business continuity team's focus is recovery and resumption. The role of a business continuity team will be discussed further in the next section.",

Preparation to deal with contingencies is a critical component of keeping the business going and maintaining the viability of the enterprise. Business continuity is a two-stage process. Business recovery is the first stage. Business resumption is the second. The recovery effort is the process of getting the business up and running again but only in a minimal acceptable condition.

Failure to properly identify critical processes may lead to wasted time, effort, and money. Even worse, noncritical processes may be given priority over critical processes, leading to further delays in recovery and causing the unnecessary expenditure of resources. It is not uncommon for organizations to identify their processes as critical, where upon further examination they are determined not to be critical. Process owners have a tendency to believe all of their processes are critical. This is precisely why it is necessary to have the business continuity team make this assessment. When developing recovery and resumption plans, the following areas must be considered and addressed:",

            "text": "\u2022 Define critical processes: Each major business area, function and discipline should provide to the business continuity team a listing of all critical processes. The business continuity team should then review these processes for criticality and prioritize them, creating an official critical process list. Planning for recovery of the critical processes is the primary concern. Noncritical processes should be recovered and resumed after the critical processes. Resource and time limitations do not allow for resumption of all processes at the same time. Processes critical to the business must have top priority. Any processes determined not to be critical should be planned for during the later stages of the resumption effort. \u2022 Critical process interdependencies: As part of the critical process assessment, particular emphasis must be placed on information systems and process interdependencies. For example, an information system in and of itself may not be determined by its process owner to be critical. However, if it supports a critical process and that critical process can't be completely restored without the information system, then that information system itself becomes critical. Examining processes as part of a system is essential in the assessment of criticality. Interdependencies need to be identified in order to properly assess criticality to the business. Other interdependencies may exist in the form of relationships with organizations outside of the enterprise. These too must be considered. Different methodologies can be used to estimate potential impact a contingency or disaster may have on a critical process. When considering the criticality of a process, the financial effect, operational effect and any less tangible or quantifiable concerns, such as customer satisfaction, must be addressed. \u2022 Resources: Critical process recovery requires an assessment of resources. Planning for process restoration means considering what resources may no longer be available and will need to be acquired or obtained to get the critical process up and functional again. What type of facilities will be needed and where? Will additional hardware, software, or equipment be required? Will people capable of managing and working the processes be available? Will there be effective means of communications? If not, what must be done to provide a minimum capability of communications until full communications can be restored? These are some of the resource issues and questions the team must grapple with. \u2022 Mitigation strategies: For those processes identified as critical, preevent actions can be taken to help mitigate the impact, both operationally and financially, of interruptions to the business. When developing contingency plans for critical processes, strategies will become apparent that may be implemented prior to an event that will lessen the impact of an event if and when it occurs. A cost/benefit analysis may be required to assess the feasibility of implementing a preevent action and if the analysis shows it to be an effective action, it should be taken. For example, an old building not built to current building codes may be vulnerable to damage from an earthquake. If that building supports a critical process, it may be more cost effective to retrofit the building with the necessary structural supports and bring it into compliance with current standards than to risk severe damage in the event of an earthquake, rendering a critical process inoperative. \u2022 Vital records: The ability to recover vital records is critical to the recovery and restoration process. Having a vital records protection and management program will enable the recovery of essential information during a contingency. \u2022 Customers and suppliers: The importance of considering input, participation, and impact to customers and suppliers cannot be overstated. Any business continuity planning must take into consideration customer and supplier relationships. Moreover, it is important to work with your suppliers and providers of goods and services to ensure they too have contingency plans in place. In the event a supplier supports one or more of your critical processes, a disruption to their business will impact your business operations. \u2022 Communications: Communicating during the recovery and resumption process can be just as important as communications during other phases of a contingency. Employees who may have been affected by the events of a crisis or disaster need to be kept abreast of developments affecting them and their employment. Customers and suppliers need to understand the progress made toward resumption of business, as it may have a serious impact on their operations. Even the external worlds of stakeholders and shareholders have an interest in these events. \u2022 Lessons learned: There is an old adage that lightning doesn't strike twice in the same place. If only that were certain and true, and applicable to the critical processes of a business. However, it is not. Therefore, much can be learned from each phase of managing and recovering from a contingency. Documenting the process of recovery and restoration will help in identifying the things learned, both good and bad, and will go a long way toward helping to deal with other crises when they occur.",

As difficult as it may be, people need to be part of this equation. For example, should a natural disaster occur, causing severe damage to a building or facility, there is a good chance that some key employees may have experienced something similar. Some may be preoccupied with their own issues of recovery and restoration and may not be able to support the company.

However, contingencies can be grouped into categories and planned for accordingly. This allows for consistency in preparedness and best utilization of resources. Types of contingencies develop and change over time as societies and organizations change and progress. Prior to the 20th century, nuclear contamination was not a concern, but today countries with nuclear power generation capabilities have in place extensive contingency plans that are regularly tested. More common hazards such as severe weather and other natural events have caused enough damage to drive organizations to better preparedness. State and local governments along with private enterprises in states like California and Mississippi spend large sums of money to prepare to mitigate the effects of earthquakes and flooding. Contingency planning may not have been a traditional security process, but in today's global business environment the security organization is assuming a much greater role and responsibility for its implementation.
