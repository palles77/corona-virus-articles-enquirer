The term torus (Latin) refers to the circular convex molding in the form of a doughnut that some columns or pilaster have at their bases; indeed, it was the unique biconcave disk and C-shape of the virion in the extracellular environment that suggested this naming. Since 1992, the genus Torovirus has been included with the genus Coronavirus and the newly recognized genus Bafinivirus in the family Coronaviridae, based on similarities in genomic organization and replication strategies. Toro-and coronaviruses are also ancestrally related: their polymerase and envelope genes diverged from those of a common predecessor. Because of their inclusion in the family Coronaviridae, the nomenclature for coronavirus genes, mRNAs, and structural proteins have also been applied to toroviruses. However, the lack of sequence homology in the structural genes and the absence of antigenic relatedness with coronaviruses justify their taxonomic position as a separate genus. The International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV) presently recognizes four species in the genus Torovirus: Equine torovirus, Bovine torovirus, Porcine torovirus, and Human torovirus.",

The large product of these ORFs is apparently involved in the synthesis of a negative-strand RNA and the onset of genomic and subgenomic RNA synthesis. The other four ORFs correspond to structural protein genes and are expressed by the production of a 3 0 is the second most abundant protein ($13%) and is probably associated with the envelope. Computer analysis has revealed characteristics of a class III membrane protein lacking a cleaved signal sequence, but containing three successive transmembrane a-helices in the N-terminal half. The M protein accumulates in intracellular membranes, predominantly those of the endoplasmic reticulum and is believed to play a role in assembly, maturation, and nucleocapsid recognition during the budding process. The heterogeneous, N-glycosylated, 80-100 kDa protein is recognized by both neutralizing and hemagglutinationinhibiting monoclonal antibodies and is therefore identified as the spike (S) protein projecting from the virion surface. The spike (S) gene encodes an apoprotein (1581 aa) with a molecular weight of about 178 kDa. The deduced amino acid sequence contains domains typical of type I membrane glycoproteins: an N-terminal signal sequence, a putative C-terminal transmembrane anchor, and a cytoplasmic tail. The HE is a class I membrane N-glycosylated protein (416-417 aa) of 65 kDa that is also located in the BToV envelope. It has an N-terminal signal sequence, a C-terminal transmembrane domain, several N-glycosylation sites, and a putative 'FGDS' motif which displays acetylesterase activity specific for N-acetyl-9-O-acetylneuraminic acid. The HE protein could be an additional receptorbinding protein (next to the spike protein) but without a function in viral entry.

EToV is remarkably stable in the environment, and relatively resistant to phospholipase C, trypsin, chymotrypsin, and even deoxycholate; however, Triton X-100 and organic solvents destroy its infectivity. EToV is stable within a wide range of pH, being inactivated only below pH 2.5 or above pH 10.3. BToV1 appears to be less stable than both EToV and BToV2 as changes in its sedimentation behavior and density have been observed after prolonged storage at -70 C. The infectivity of a fecal preparation containing BToV1 has been reported to be lost completely after 3 weeks at 4 C, whereas EToV in cell-free supernatant remained stable for 92 days. Storage of toroviruses at -20 to -70 C helps to preserve infectivity. However, even at these temperatures the viruses will deteriorate, though at a slower rate.

EToV RNAs 1-3 are transcribed independently, as has been shown by UV transcription mapping.

It is unknown whether the accumulation of nucleocapsids in the nucleus reflects a nuclear phase in the replication of EToV or some sort of defective assembly. Viruses predominantly bud into the lumen of Golgi cisternae. The preformed nucleocapsid tubules approach the Golgi membrane with one of the rounded ends oriented toward the membrane and attach to it laterally. During budding, the nucleocapsid is apparently stabilized, leading to a higher electron density and a constant diameter (23 nm). Release into the intestinal lumen is probably through reverse pinocytosis. Virus maturation apparently occurs intracellularly during the egress process, where the virus nucleocapsid appearance changes from a straight rod (intracellular) into a torus shape (extracellular).

Oral inoculation of calves with BToV has been shown to induce diarrhea with virus shed in feces under experimental conditions. The nasal route is another possible pathway for entry as BToV antigen and viral RNA have been detected in the nasal secretions of feedlot calves. Additionally, diarrhea has been induced after intranasal inoculation in Gn and CD calves. For bovine coronavirus (BCoV), respiratory tract infections have been reported to occur prior to enteric infections, indicating the possible importance of this route of transmission in the spread and pathogenesis of this distantly related group of enteric nidoviruses. It is possible that BToV, like BCoV, could initially replicate in nasal epithelial cells, and thereby amplify before being swallowed and infecting the intestinal tract. This hypothesis for BToV pathogenesis should be further studied.",

Twenty-four to seventy-two hours post exposure, the first clinical signs are observed (mild fever, depression, weakness, and anorexia), followed by a greenish-yellow to bright yellow watery diarrhea that lasts for 3-5 days. Calves may develop severe dehydration and die. Fecal virus shedding begins 24-72 h post infection, coinciding with the onset of diarrhea, and lasts for 2-6 days. Shedding peaks around 3-4 days post infection. Mixed infections with other enteric viruses, such as rotaviruses or astroviruses, result in a more severe watery diarrhea than is induced by either virus alone. In CD calves with a normal intestinal flora, diarrhea is generally more severe than in Gn calves. Sporadic and recurrent shedding of BToV can last for up to 4 months. BToV has also been detected in nasal samples. Further studies are needed to analyze BToV replication and shedding in the respiratory tract as well as its role in respiratory pathologies.",

As shown by IF, both crypt and villus epithelial cells contain antigen. The watery diarrhea is probably a result of the loss of reabsorptive capacity of the colonic mucosa, combined with malabsorption in the small intestine. The germinal centers of Peyer's patches are depleted of lymphocytes and may occasionally show fresh hemorrhage. The dome epithelial cells, including the M-cells, display the same cytopathic changes as seen in the absorptive cells of the villi.

This taxon of plant viruses was categorized as a monotypic virus group consisting of a single virus (TSWV) until the report of impatiens necrotic spot virus (INSV) in 1991. Thus, most of the characteristics which define the genus Tospovirus were obtained through investigation of TSWV even after the discovery of additional viruses in the genus ( Table 1 ) . Biolog ical investigations beginni ng in the 1940s revealed a virus that had an unusually large host range and occurred in nature as a complex mixture of phenotypic isolates. However, it was one of the least stable viruses and most difficult plant viruses to mechanically transmit. Although the enveloped virions were observed in the 1960s, molecular characterization and elucidation of the genome organization were not completed until the early 1990s. The virus was shown to be vectored by thrips in the 1930s and later transmitted in a persistent manner. Thrips were demonstrated to be a host for replication of the virus and that replication was required for transmission in the early 1990s. Later it was recognized that limited, localized replication may occur in thrips that does not result in the thrips becoming viruliferous. Advances in gene function and cellular biology have been limited due to the absence of a robust in vitro plant or thrips cell culture system, and lack of an efficient reverse genetics system. However, limited progress has been made utilizing gene expression systems and classical viral genetics.",
