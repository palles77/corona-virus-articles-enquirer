            "text": "Since the emergence of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) in 2012, there have been a number of clusters of human-to-human transmission. These cases of human-tohuman transmission involve close contact and have occurred primarily in healthcare settings, and they are suspected to result from repeated zoonotic introductions. In this study, we sequenced whole MERS-CoV genomes directly from respiratory samples collected from 23 confirmed MERS cases in the United Arab Emirates (UAE). These samples included cases from three nosocomial and three household clusters. The sequences were analysed for changes and relatedness with regard to the collected epidemiological data and other available MERS-CoV genomic data. Sequence analysis supports the epidemiological data within the clusters, and further, suggests that these clusters emerged independently. To understand how and when these clusters emerged, respiratory samples were taken from dromedary camels, a known host of MERS-CoV, in This is an open access article under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial License, which permits use, distribution and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited and is not used for commercial purposes. the same geographic regions as the human clusters. Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus genomes from six virus-positive animals were sequenced, and these genomes were nearly identical to those found in human patients from corresponding regions. These data demonstrate a genetic link for each of these clusters to a camel and support the hypothesis that human MERS-CoV diversity results from multiple zoonotic introductions.",

            "text": "Like SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV is thought to be of animal origin. Investigations of bats and other animals have found near identical sequences, including MERS-CoV in camels Corman et al., 2014; Hemida et al., 2014; Raj et al., 2014; Reusken, Messadi, et al., 2014) . Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus can replicate efficiently in the upper respiratory tract of dromedary camels (referred to hereafter as \"camels\") (Adney et al., 2014) . Further studies identified that the MERS-CoV receptor, dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4), is relatively conserved among mammals, suggesting a likelihood of cross-species transmission . However, only camels and alpacas have been found seropositive (Reusken, Ababneh, et al., 2013; Reusken et al., 2016) , and the virus has only been isolated from camels (Hemida et al., 2014; Raj et al., 2014; Reusken, Ababneh, et al., 2013) . The evidence suggests that MERS-CoV may jump between other mammals and camels, and that camels play a role as an intermediate host that transmits MERS-CoV directly to humans (Al Hammadi et al., 2015; Anthony et al., 2017; Azhar et al., 2014; Drosten, Kellam, & Memish, 2014; Memish et al., 2014; Nowotny & Kolodziejek, 2014; Sabir et al., 2016) .",

SARS-CoV acquired characteristic genetic changes as the virus was sampled from humans during the early epidemic, suggesting that these mutations may play a role in either replication fitness or transmissibility (Bolles, Donaldson, & Baric, 2011; Chinese Sars Molecular Epidemiology Consortium, 2004; Song et al., 2005; Wong, Li, Moore, Choe, & Farzan, 2004) .

We obtained S and N gene sequences for an additional four samples that failed full genome sequencing ( Figure 2 , Table 1 ). Alignment of these sequences with the other known MERS-CoV sequences showed >99% genetic identity. Single nucleotide polymorphism analysis of the aligned full genome sequences from this study against the HCoV-EMC/2012 sequence showed a range of 98 to 113 nucleotide (nt) variations scattered along the genome ( Figure 3a ). Comparison of the spike genes to the HCoV-EMC/2012 strain showed a total of 31 SNPs (Figure 3b ), causing nine amino acid (AA) changes, but none of these mutations appear to be distinct to these clusters.

For the analysis, we ran CLC's quality-based variant detection algorithm using 5% as a conservative cut-off. We observed mixed bases distributed throughout the genome in each sample without noting obvious hot spots. This analysis shows that at position 11775 in index patient 2014_008, bases T and C are present at almost an equal number of reads, coding for amino acids as isoleucine (base T) or threonine (base C). However, in the HCA cluster III and HH cluster C, only one nucleotide or the other is present in the contact cases. Of the nine direct contact cases sequenced, five harbour the C variant and four harbour the T variant exclusively. Another notable observation was that secondary cases 2014_011 and 2014_017 contain the nonsynonymous mutation A12891C (ORF1ab E4208A). In the index case 2014_008, 30.6% of the bases sequenced at that position are C. This suggests multiple possibilities for founder viruses upon transmission.",

We sequenced MERS-CoV genomes recovered from three camels (1B-A, 2B-E and 1H-F) near the KSA border, two camels (3B-C and 1H-D) from a farm near Al Ain and one camel (1H-B) from a farm in the Western Region, also linked with a known human case ( Table 2 ). The sequences recovered from these camels were very similar to the human MERS-CoV sequences in this study, differing by 3-8 nt, compared to the nearest UAE human MERS-CoV sequence (Table 2) . Further, we constructed maximum likelihood trees on the full genomes and S genes (Figure 4 , Figure S1 ). The majority of human and camel MERS-CoVs sequenced in this study belongs to lineage 2 as defined by Sabir et al., (2016) . Sequences for which we only have the S/N sequence (2013_007, 2013_008, 2013_003 and 2014_045) also cluster within lineage 2 ( Figure S1 ). Healthcare-associated cluster III and HH cluster C form a monophyletic group and are closely related to two camel sequences 3B-C and 1H-D. The rest of the clusters are scattered at different positions within the lineage. Among them, HCA cluster I from 2013 defines an isolated cluster within lineage 2. HH clusters A and B are closely related to each other and to one of the Oman cases from around the same time period (Figure 4) . The sequences from HH clusters A and B also cluster with a MERS-CoV genome recovered from a camel in the UAE earlier that year (GenBank KP719927). The sequence from the HCA cluster II index case (2014_002) is closely related to the camel sequence 1H-B, which comes from a farm in the Western Region. They differ by three nt which is consistent with their potential epidemiologic link (the patient was from the Western Region and had contact with camels). While there may be no direct linkage among the different small UAE clusters (HCA I, HH A, HH B and HCA II), HCA cluster III or HH cluster C, the phylogenetic closeness implies a temporal and geographic constraint. The close connection between geographic and phylogenetic relatedness is also apparent in the context of the other known MERS-CoV sequences (Figure 4) .",

Furthermore, the divergence date of the genome at Node A, the common ancestor of human and camel viruses associated with UAE cluster HCA III and HH C, is estimated to be early January 2014 (Node A). Node C represents a separate divergence of human 2014_XXX and camel CoVs which occurred around the same time.

These studies may also lead to improved understanding of the underlying genotypic mutations that drive phenotypic changes. Larger transmission events, like those in Al Hasa, Jeddah and Korea Oboho et al., 2015; Park et al., 2015) provide opportunities for molecular epidemiological analysis to understand whether changes in the virus genome lead to increased transmission, better fitness or adaptation to treatment. In spring of 2014, there was a steep increase in the number of MERS-CoV cases reported to WHO. This study demonstrates that these outbreaks in the UAE are likely due to independent zoonotic transmission events followed by nosocomial amplification which is consistent with the epidemiological investigations (Al Hunter et al., 2016) .",

Further, we did not identify any signature amino acid changes in the spike genes associated with the larger transmission clusters. Thus, there is no compelling genetic evidence for a more transmissible virus, rather, the high rate of transmission was likely due to the close contact of the patients with MERS.",

It is now clear that dromedary camels are a major reservoir of MERS-CoV and an important species in transmitting the virus to humans (Alagaili et al., 2014; Azhar et al., 2014; Ferguson & Van Kerkhove, 2014) . We know that several of the index cases in this study had close contact with camels from different regions of the UAE (Al Hunter et al., 2016) . Here, we show genomic evidence linking the MERS-CoV genome from camel 1H-B (Western Region) to case 2014_002, a person who visited the farm where this animal was kept-the genomes were a distance of three nt. Although the camels from KSA/UAE border (1B-A, 2B-E, and 1H-F) were not directly associated with any known human cases, the genome sequence clustered with human case 2014_XXX at a distance of eight nucleotides. This suggests a zoonotic link to case 2014_XXX. In HCA cluster III, although there was no recorded camel contact with the index patient, sequences collected from the Al Ain-area camels 3B-C and 1H-C just before the outbreak (February 2014) show close similarity at the nucleotide level (seven nt) to the human index case 2014_008 (Figure 3 , Table 2 ). Additionally, the 2013_002 case, who lived near the KSA border and had frequent contact with camels, harboured a MERS-CoV sequence closely linked to a camel-derived sequence from KSA already published in GenBank (Muhairi et al., 2016) . The fact that the camel from Dubai (KP719927) is closely related to HH A cases suggests that MERS-CoV may have been imported to an Abu Dhabi camel market from Dubai.",

This suggests repeated independent introductions or cocirculation between camels and humans, as has been concluded in other cases Drosten, Kellam, et al., 2014; Memish et al., 2014) . Taken together with the molecular clock data showing different human/camel virus divergence dates for different human MERS outbreaks, we conclude that the human and camel viruses are not distinct viruses and at least some strains are likely capable of infecting both species. Notably, human-to-human transmission chains have been relatively short, which suggests that MERS-CoV may not be transmitted efficiently from human to human at this time, having a transient and mostly dead-end infection. Further study of MERS-CoV in camel populations may lead to an understanding of the viral genes that are important in tropism and replication fitness in camel versus human hosts.",

We demonstrated some limited usefulness in linking epidemiological cases, where a minority population converts to the predominant population in the transmission partner. This complicates simple phylogenetic relationships between cases, as there may be appreciable diversity in an infected host to transmit different viruses to two different contacts. Briese et al. demonstrated this phenomenon in linking a camel MERS-CoV minor population genome directly to a human MERS case . A newer study examining camel MERS-CoV isolates observed that although there were only a handful of differences between strains at the consensus level, there were hundreds of intrahost variants (Borucki et al., 2016) . Appreciating this phenomenon will help in more accurately and robustly identifying and dating transmission pairs and in understanding variants associated with fitness.",

These data will be important in determining what molecular changes in the virus may lead to increased transmission between humans. Exposure to camels is a risk factor for human MERS-CoV infection, and undoubtedly, new cases will continue to emerge. Surveillance of camels on the Arabian Peninsula and in eastern Africa has shown a high rate of seropositivity as well as some MERS-CoV shedding (Alagaili et al., 2014; Corman et al., 2014; Haagmans et al., 2014; M\u00fcller et al., 2014; Reusken, Haagmans, et al., 2013) . There is a camel MERS-CoV vaccine in development (Haagmans et al., 2015; Song et al., 2013) , but in the near term, it is critical that individuals exposed directly to camels take precautions to minimize the risk of MERS-CoV transmission.
