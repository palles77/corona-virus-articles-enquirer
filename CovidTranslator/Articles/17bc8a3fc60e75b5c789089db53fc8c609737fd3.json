The National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) previously made available a tool for validating and annotating influenza virus sequences that is used to check submissions to GenBank. Before this project, there was no analogous tool in use for non-influenza viral sequence submissions. Results: We developed a system called VADR (Viral Annotation DefineR) that validates and annotates viral sequences in GenBank submissions. The annotation system is based on the analysis of the input nucleotide sequence using models built from curated RefSeqs. Hidden Markov models are used to classify sequences by determining the RefSeq they are most similar to, and feature annotation from the RefSeq is mapped based on a nucleotide alignment of the full sequence to a covariance model. Predicted proteins encoded by the sequence are validated with nucleotide-to-protein alignments using BLAST. The system identifies 43 types of \"alerts\" that (unlike the previous BLAST-based system) provide deterministic and rigorous feedback to researchers who submit sequences with unexpected characteristics",

More than 250,000 of these sequences were submitted in 2018. All sequence submissions are validated prior to deposition in GenBank. Automated validation and annotation methods become increasingly important as sequence submission numbers grow. Table 1 shows the number of sequences for the 16 virus species with the most sequences in GenBank. Influenza sequences are the second most abundant and the National Center of Biotechnology Information (NCBI), where GenBank is housed, has expended considerable effort to organize flu sequences and streamline the submission of new influenza virus sequences, including a tool to validate and annotate flu submissions called FLAN [2] . The influenza virus sequence submission tool (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/ genome/viruses/variation/help/flu-help-center/submitflu-sequences/) is implemented specifically for influenza with many hard-coded features. It has proven [3] (https:// www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genome/viruses/variation) includes specialized components that attempt to normalize annotation of previously submitted sequences for rotaviruses, dengue virus, West Nile virus, ebolaviruses, Zika virus, and MERS coronavirus. The resulting standardized annotation supports virus-specific searches using gene and protein names. However, the Virus Variation Resource does not support the submission of new sequences, and its tools are not generalizable, such that creating components for additional virus species is laborious.",

At NCBI, sequence submissions have been checked by indexers since NCBI began operating GenBank, but over the years, limitations to this arrangment have become apparent. First, the number and size of sequence submissions has grown much faster than the NCBI budget and the capability to hire more indexers. Second, although GenBank indexers are trained rigorously and homogeneously and use the same software, there is no formal mechanism to enforce \"inter-observer agreement\", meaning that all GenBank indexers would be guaranteed to give the same evaluation of the same submission. Third, researchers who wish to submit their sequences cannot reproduce all the checks that GenBank indexers do. Consequently, problematic sequences cause delays and e-mail interactions between submitters and indexers that might be avoidable using a more deterministic and open system of checks. The importance of transparency in curatorial analysis was emphasized by Walter Goad, one of the founders of GenBank: \"It is important that we be perceived by the molecular biology community as offering free and open access to the information and programs we will be collecting\" [5] .",

We discuss the use of VADR in evaluating GenBank submissions of norovirus and dengue virus sequences.

Finally, CDS features that encode proteins are validated for protein-coding potential using blastx. Submitted sequences that are confidently aligned and annotated with VADR pass and are cleared for automatic entry into GenBank. In contrast, when a submitted sequence is evaluated by VADR and the comparison to its matching RefSeq reveals the input sequence is divergent in various ways (e.g. early stop codon, regions of low nucleotide similarity), then the sequence fails. Failure means that the sequence is flagged for manual review by an NCBI expert curator, called a \"GenBank indexer\", and the sequence is prevented from automatic entry into GenBank. If all sequences in a submission pass, all sequences will automatically be deposited into GenBank. If at least one sequence fails, a report with sequence-specific errors is generated and reported to the submitter or reviewed by the indexer, who can clear sequences for submission or contact the submitter for further investigation of the apparent problems.",

Additionally, v-build.pl uses the makeblastdb program from BLAST v2.9.0+ [15] to create a BLAST database from amino acid translations of the RefSeq CDS features. v-annotate.pl uses this database with blastx to validate its nucleotide-based predictions of CDS features. This design in which VADR annotates nucleotide sequences, but validates with protein alignments allows us to mitigate the known limitation that the 4-letter nucleic acid alphabet is less sensitive in homology searching than the 20-letter amino acid alphabet [16] , while retaining the capability to annotate ncRNAs and other features that are not translated.",

These 194 RefSeqs comprise 9 norovirus sequences, 4 dengue virus sequences, and an additional 181 RefSeqs from other viruses in the families Caliciviridae and Flaviviridae.

This library is currently used by GenBank indexers on submitted sequences to annotate norovirus and dengue virus sequences and to recognize some taxonomically misclassified sequences.

The false negative rates are 0.009 (8/906) for norovirus and 0.006 (15/2535) for dengue virus.",

Bacterial genomes are typically larger with hundreds of genes, many of which may be uncharacterized. Hence, assembly and gene prediction are two of the difficult problems in bacterial annotation. Virus genomes are typically smaller with only a handful of genes, but the biological phenomena of cleavage of proteins into mature peptides [24] and ribosomal slippage [25, 26, 27] are prominent. Surprisingly, while 97% (31,086 of 32, 190) and 85% (17,900 of 20,973) of non-RefSeq norovirus and dengue virus sequences, respectively, last modified between January 1, 1989 and December 31, 2017, had at least one CDS annotated, only 1.4% (443 of 31,086) and 6.4% (1,157 of 17,900) of those those had any mature peptides annotated, even though mature peptide cleavage occurs in all viruses of the corresponding genera. VADR fixes this omission; all norovirus and dengue virus sequences in GenBank annotated with VADR have mature peptides predicted, where possible.",

We added annotation of an ncRNA feature, a subgenomic flavivirus RNA (sfRNA), and associated stem loop features, to the four dengue virus RefSeqs in preparation of VADR use for dengue sequence submissions. These structural RNA elements are relevant in pathogenicity and evasion of the host immune system in at least some flaviviruses [13, 30, 31] . Incoming dengue virus sequence submissions will now include these RNA annotations because of VADR, which employs covariance models of both the conserved sequence and secondary structure of the RNA elements.

Near-term plans include to expand the usage to many other members of the family Flaviviridae, including Hepacivirus C, West Nile virus and Zika virus. VADR was not designed for viruses with genomes larger than 25Kb such as eukaryotic DNA viruses such as Epstein-Barr virus (\u223c170Kb). For these larger viruses, VADR would require an impractical amount of memory and time due to the high complexity of the CM algorithms. In future work, we hope to develop new methods to alleviate this restriction. Due to the COVID-19 outbreak beginning in December 2019, we have made 55 Coronaviridae models available for download and analysis of coronavirus sequences including SARS-CoV-2, even though VADR was not designed for sequences as large as coronavirus genomes (\u223c30Kb). It is recommended that at least 64Gb of RAM are available when analyzing full length coronavirus genomes. Download and usage instructions for these models can be found on github (https://github.com/nawrockie/vadr/wiki/Available-VADR-model-files).",

Valid sequences that are sufficiently dissimilar from all RefSeq-based models will fail because alerts designed to identify dissimilar sequences will be reported. The failures of some sequences from the test datasets that pass VAPiD and/or VIGOR can be attributed to this, as discussed in the Results section. During testing with incoming norovirus sequence submissions, three additional RefSeqs, included in the nine norovirus RefSeqs used for the tests described herein, were created to address this issue. Stimulated by some recent norovirus submissions with sequences dissimilar from the nine RefSeqs in the VADR 1.0 library and by a newly published norovirus genotyping paradigm [32] that suggested additional candidate RefSeqs more similar to the new sequences, we selected and curated 11 additional norovirus RefSeqs to reach a total of 20. Ten of the additional 11 RefSeqs are being tested on norovirus submissions since early 2020. VADR can be run on such sequences with 19 or 20 models for norovirus instead of nine models. Whichever ones of the additional 11 norovirus RefSeqs prove useful in internal testing will have their models included in a future released version of VADR and be used in automated processing of submissions.",

Profile-based methods are more sensitive at homology detection [33, 34, 35, 36] then single sequence based methods and so this strategy may improve performance. Extending VADR to profiles was envisioned from its design inception and the cmbuild program which creates VADR's CM files can take as input a multiple alignment. All sequences in the alignment the profile is constructed from should include the same set of features with start and end points aligned, which will limit the phylogenetic breadth of some alignments. For example, among noroviruses, eight of the nine RefSeqs encode three proteins, but murine norovirus (represented by NC 08311) encodes four proteins. A similar problem arises among different subtypes of West Nile virus that may or may not encode WARF4 [37] .",
