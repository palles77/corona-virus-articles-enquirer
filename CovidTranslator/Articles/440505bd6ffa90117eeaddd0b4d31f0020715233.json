            "text": "Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) led to a life-threatening form of atypical pneumonia in late 2002. In March 2003, the causative agent was identified and named as SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV). SARS-CoV belongs to the genus Coronaviridae, and is an enveloped, positive-stranded virus with $30,000 nucleotides. 1 Viral genome encodes two polyproteins, pp1a ($490 kDa) and pp1ab ($790 kDa). 3C-like protease (3CL pro ), the main protease, and papain-like protease (PL pro ) cleave these polyproteins to generate non-structural proteins essential for the viral replication. 2, 3 Due to its vital role in replication, 3CL pro is an attractive drug target. Many inhibitors were discovered from high throughput screening and structure-based rational design. [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] Although the SARS-CoV infection died down soon, another human CoV associated with the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS-CoV) has recently emerged, killing about 36% (584 of 1621) of patients infected globally, mainly in Saudi Arabia and South Korea. 11 Due to the similar maturation pathway, MERS-CoV 3CL pro is also regarded as a target for developing anti-viral drug. The previously reported SARS-CoV 3CL pro inhibitors cannot potently inhibit MERS-CoV 3CL pro without modifications, due to the subtle structural differences in their active sites. 12 Though tremendous efforts have been made to develop inhibitors, therapeutic interventions for the continuous outbreaks of these deadly CoVs, are yet to reach the market. 13, 14 While the origin of SARS dates back to early 2003, influenza has a century-old history of affecting humans. Influenza virus is an enveloped RNA virus that belongs to the orthomyxoviridae family. 15 It has caused four major pandemics in the last century, namely, 1918 ('Spanish' flu, H1N1), 1957 ('Asian' flu, H2N2), 1968 ('Hong Kong' flu, H3N2), and 1977 ('Russian' flu, H1N1). 16 Spanish flu pandemic claimed about 50 million lives worldwide. 17 Recent outbreak of H7N9 in China along with A/Shanghai/1/2013 H7N9 virus with R292K mutation is a serious concern. 18, 19 One of the most accessible targets is neuraminidase (NA), which is essential for the release of viral particle from the cell surface and has been the target for the marketed drugs oseltamivir and zanamivir. We recently reported new inhibitors of both N1 and N2 type NAs and also showed their anti-viral activities in the cell-based assay. 20 Due to their structural similarity to our previously discovered SARS-CoV 3CL pro inhibitors, 21 we screened these NA inhibitors on the SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV 3CL pro and synthesized the analogues of hits to establish the structure-activity-relationship (SAR) on these 3CL pro as reported herein (Table 1) .",

Carboxylate moiety seemed to be an essential component as compound 3j without it at R 1 and R 4 was inactive. Removal of R 4 carboxylate from 3d (IC 50 = 44.7 \u00b1 5.1 lM) but retaining it at R 1 resulted in 3f (IC 50 = 16.4 \u00b1 0.7 lM) with improved activity. (IC 50 = 6.4 \u00b1 1.2 lM) with carboxylate only at R 4 was 3-fold and 7-fold more potent compared with 3f and 3m respectively. From these results we conclude that carboxylate moiety is an important pharmacophore and its presence either at R 1 or R 4 is critical for the activity as 3k was as equipotent as 3h and 3i. Chlorine at R 2 slightly changed the activity as we observed 2-fold decrease in the activity of 3m, 3n, 3o and 3p as compared with 3f, 3g, 3h and 3i respectively. Substituent on ring D was also important. While compounds with electron-withdrawing F or CN (3g, 3q) did not show significant difference in activity, electron-donating methoxy group (3r) on ring D caused 2-fold drop in activity as compared with 3f without any substituent.",

Subsite S1 is made of vital catalytic residue Cys145 which forms catalytic dyad with His41 to process the polyproteins at eleven sites comprising of conserved Gln followed by small amino acids like Ser, Ala or Gly. 23 Other vital component of S1 subsite is the oxyanion hole, formed by the interaction of C-terminal carboxylate anion of the conserved Gln with Gly143, Ser144 and Cys145, which stabilizes the transition state during proteolysis. 24, 25 Glu166 at the entrance of the pocket interacts via H-bond with Ne2 of the conserved Gln. 24 The S2 and S4 subsites contain hydrophobic and bulky side chains like Val, Leu or Phe. Subsites S5 and S6 are near the surface of the active site and has little role in the substrate binding.",

At S1 subsite, R 1 carboxylate of 3i, as a representative of 3f-3i and 3o-3p, forms H-bonds with Gly143, Ser144 and Cys145 which are the vital residues forming the oxyanion hole. This prevents efficient cleavage of substrate by obstructing stabilization of the tetrahedral intermediate formed during the transition state. The carboxylate moiety of these compounds makes an additional H-bond with His163 at the S1 subsite which is responsible for the specificity of protease towards conserved Gln residue. The furan ring interacts with the hydrophobic side chain of Leu27 in S1 0 subsite (not shown). Due to the hydrophobic nature of S2 subsite, additional alkyl substitution on ring D of 3h, 3i, 3o and 3p enhances interaction with Met49 and Gln189 through hydrophobic contact. This additional contact seems to be responsible for 3-fold enhanced inhibition of 3h and 3i compared with 3f and 3g. In addition to hydrophobic interaction, carbonyl moiety of pyrazolone core in 3f-3i and 3o-3p interacts with His41 through H-bond to destabilize catalytic dyad. Removal of R 2 chlorine, comparing 3f and 3g with 3m and 3n respectively, unfavorably reorients the molecule to lose H-bonding with His41, Gly143 and Cys145 (Fig. S1 ). This explains the observed 2-fold drop in activity on removal of chlorine.",

Unlike SARS-CoV 3CL pro which accommodates ring A and B of 3k, smaller S2 subsite of MERS-CoV 3CL pro accommodates phenyl moiety at R 3 (Fig. 2) . This smaller size of S2 makes those molecules with the R 3 phenyl group fit snugly into the active site of MERS-CoV 3CL pro and should be the reason behind most of the active compounds being equipotent. In S2 subsite, R 3 interacts with His41 via p-p stacking interaction to perturb the catalytic dyad. At S1 subsite our best inhibitor 3k (Fig. 2) , with its carboxylate moiety at ring D, interacts with Ser147 to destabilize oxyanion hole. Carbonyl moiety in pyrazolone core also interacts with Glu169 at the entrance of S2 subsite. At S2 subsite, its R 3 phenyl formed p-p stacking with His41 to perturb catalytic dyad. Ring A and B which are primarily hydrophobic interact with the side chains of Leu170, Val193 and Gln195 at S4 subsite. Compound 3f with unsubstituted phenyl group at R 3 prefers hydrophobic S2. The ring C forms T-shaped p-p stacking with His41 and destabilizes the oxyanion hole ( Fig. S2a) . Removal of chlorine atom caused 3-fold loss in activity of 3m as compared with 3f due to loss of T-shaped p-p stacking with His41 (Fig. S2b ). In addition, ring D interacts with hydrophobic side chain of Met25. However, when ring D is substituted with bulkier groups, removal of chlorine did not make a significant change in activity as both the molecules maintain similar interactions at S1, S2 and S4 subsites (not shown).",

To the best of our knowledge there is no report regarding common inhibitors of these targets from coronavirus and influenza virus in the literature. While there is still no drug for recently emerged MERS-CoV infection, our report raises a possibility of modifying the known inhibitors of NA to inhibit 3CL pro and vice versa. This approach was tried on MERS by using clinically approved drugs. [26] [27] [28] With the escalating cost of drug discovery, concept of drug repurposing is gaining importance. Developing an anti-viral agent with broad-spectrum activity might be advantageous to overcome financial hurdles in the drug discovery. We shall look into modification of the molecules keeping the pharmacophores intact as it seems to be vital for broad-spectrum activity. Compounds with a pyrazole ring surrounded by three hydrophobic groups were also reported to inhibit 3C proteases of human picornaviruses, such as rhinovirus, enterovirus, and coxsackievirus, in addition to 3CL pro of coronaviruses. 29 Efforts are being made to co-crystallize these compounds with the enzymes.

The protein eluted by lysis buffer with 300 mM imidazole were dialyzed against lysis buffer to removed imidazole and then Factor Xa was added to the fusion proteins to a final concentration of 1% (w/w) and incubated at 16\u00b0C for 24 h to remove the His-tag. Subsequently, the processed MERS-CoV 3CL pro was passed through a Ni-NTA column for purification. The protein concentration was determined by the protein assay kit (BioRad, USA) and BSA was used as standard.",
