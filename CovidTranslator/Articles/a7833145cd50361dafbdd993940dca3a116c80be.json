One died within 24 hours after inoculation, another was devoured by the dam, and a third was killed on p.i. day 23 because of enterocolitis. Two died with pleural and peritoneal effusions on p.i. days 11 and 26, respectively, but in the latter a haemorrhagie intussusception of the colon was also present. No cause of death could be established in the remaining two rabbits dying on p.i. days 9 and 12. Table 1 shows the results of examination of the baby rabbits and their dams during nursing period. PEDV was demonstrated in two dead baby rabbits examined on p.i. days 23 and 26, but not in two others dying on p.i. days 9 and 11. On p.i. day 30 PEDV was demonstrable in blood of all six surviving infected . 1 and 4) . Two of the four dams (Nos. 1 and 3) were found to be protected when challenged with PEDV, indicating that these two dams had become infected during the nursing period. After the nursing period two baby rabbits died on p.i. days 34 and 41 with pleural and peritoneal effusions. The remaining four infected baby rabbits, the five litter-mates, and two additional controls (introduced in cage nos. 2 and 3) appeared clinically normal until sacrifice or challenge. No gross lesions were observed at necropsy of the infected rabbits. This indicates that viraemia was present for six months in all four infected rabbits and that transmission of PEDV infection from these rabbits to their agematched cage-mates did not take place. ",

This response was also seen in two of the four rabbits inoculated with blood from p.i. day 60. Inoculation with blood or serum specimens from p.i. day 90 or later never resulted in clinical disease typical of PED; at most a transient fever was observed. To observe if the virus present in blood would retain inability to provoke clinical disease, serial rabbit passages of infectious serum from p.i. days 90, t20, 150 and 180 were carried out at 7-day intervals. Table 3 shows the number of rabbit passages required before infectious serum regained a capacity to produce disease corresponding to that of t/he early isolates and the miginM virus. Evidently, with continued viraemia ~n increasing number of passages was needed, and with two late isolates from the same rabbit clinical disease was not produced in spite of many passages.",

As seen from Table 4 , rabbits receiving from 5 ml serum to 1 ml of serum dilutions 10 -2 to 10 -4 failed to develop clinical disease typical of PED on challenge. This indicates a virus concentration per ml of serum of 10 ~ to 104 rabbit-infectious doses. The protective effect of the same sera, after infectivity had been destroyed by ether-treatment, was studied by challenge one day after serum injection. Table 4 shows that two of four rabbits, receiving the largest dose of serum, failed to develop clinical disease typical of PED. The table also shows the day of death from PED. Using mortality rather than the full clinical picture as evidence of PED, it would appear that rabbits receiving 1 ml or more of ether-treated serum had a lower mortality (1 out of 8) than rabbits receiving 0.t ml or less (11 out of 14). This suggests a protective effect of all four ether-treated sera.

It may also be argued that the lack of response was due to a low virus concentration in serum. The virus concentration on p.i. day 180 was measured to 102 to 104 rabbit-infectious doses. The same concentrations of the original virus regularly produce clinical disease (Unpubl. observations).

The question whether virus was attached to immunoglobulins, forming circulating infectious virus-antibody complexes, was not examined. In other viral infections associated with circulating infectious virus-antibody complexes, glomerutonephritis and deposits of host immunoglobulins have been demonstrated (11) .

This assumption is in accordance with observations on PED among adult rabbits inoculated with treponemes contaminated with PEDV. PED was present as an intercurrent disease at Statens Seruminstitut from 1961 to 1977. During this period evidence indicating cross-infection to adjacent or other cages was never found and PED remained strictly confined to animals inoculated with contaminated treponemal suspensions.",
