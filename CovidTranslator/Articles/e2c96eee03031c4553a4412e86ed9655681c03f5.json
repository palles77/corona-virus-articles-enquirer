Except for the first outbreak in Malaysia-Singapore, which was related to contact with pigs and the outbreak in Philippines associated with horse slaughter, most other outbreaks have affected the Indo-Bangladesh regions. The Indo-Bangladesh outbreaks were associated with consumption of raw date palm sap contaminated by fruit bats and had a very high secondary attack rate. The patient usually presents with fever, encephalitis and/or respiratory involvement with or without thrombocytopenia, leukopenia and transaminitis. Diagnosis can be confirmed by isolation and nucleic acid amplification in the acute phase or antibody detection during the convalescent phase. Treatment is mostly limited to supportive care and syndromic management of acute encephalitis syndrome. Ribavirin, m102.4 monoclonal antibody and favipiravir are the only anti-virals with some activity against Nipah virus. Standard precautions, hand hygiene and personal protective equipments are the cornerstone of comprehensive infection prevention and control strategy. With the recent outbreaks affecting newer geographical areas, there is a need for physicians to be aware of this disease and keep abreast of its current detection and management strategies.",

The outbreak of Nipah virus (NiV) disease in Malaysia involved more than 250 cases of febrile encephalitis in farm and abattoir workers. This outbreak caused widespread panic and considerable socioeconomic disruption. Although, no further outbreaks were reported from Malaysia the virus has been responsible for outbreaks in other parts of the world, mainly in Bangladesh and India (2) . Recent outbreak of Nipah virus in Kerala in May 2018 brought this emerging-re-emerging virus into the spotlight again.",

NiV has subtle differences in its makeup when compared to a typical paramyxovirus. It has reticular cytoplasmic inclusions close to the endoplasmic reticulum unlike other paramyxoviruses. Also, NiV is on average larger than typical paramyxoviruses. There are only minor ultrastructural differences between Hendra virus (HeV) and NiV and they have significant cross reactivity on serological tests, and are therefore grouped as Henipavirus (3) . Within NiV, two different strains have been identified, the Malaysian (MY) and the Bangladesh (BD) strains. The two strains are approximately 92% identical on sequencing but appear to be significantly different in their pathogenicity and transmissibility (4-7).",

The second outbreak of this disease was in a geographically non-contiguous location, in the Meherpur district of Bangladesh and Siliguri city of West Bengal, India in 2001 (Figures 1 and 2) . The Indo-Bangladesh outbreaks were significantly different from the previous outbreak in Malaysia in terms of modes of transmission, clinical features and case fatality rates. Human to human transmission and nosocomial infections (via droplets and/or fomites) were a prominent feature in this outbreak. Also, the secondary attack rates were higher and the disease was more severe and rapidly progressive compared to the Malaysian outbreak. Apart from the neurological manifestations, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and respiratory failure with multi organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS) were probably the major reason for higher mortality. Since then, there has been an outbreak in Bangladesh almost every year and a total of 17 outbreaks have been reported until 2015. There was another small outbreak in 2007 in the Nadia district of West Bengal, India (Figures 1 and 2 ). In the outbreak in the Philippines in March-May, 2014, both horses and humans were affected with fruit bats being the possible source of infection. Interestingly, this outbreak was significantly associated with horse slaughter and horse meat consumption (Figures 1 and 2 ) (10) . The Indian outbreak of 2018 affected primarily the Kozhikode district and nearby area of Kerala (Figures 1  and 2 ) (11) .",

The Indo-Bangladesh outbreaks, including the recent Kerala outbreak, was remarkable in various aspects, mode of transmission being one of them. A significant association of NiV disease and consumption of raw date palm sap contaminated by fruit bats was found by Luby et al. (14) Another study by Rahman et al. also concluded with similar results (15) . In date palm sap the virus remains stable for at least 7 days at 22\u00b0C and is extremely tolerant to a wide range of pH (from 3 to 11) (16) . Human to human and nosocomial transmission was also documented in the Indo-Bangladesh outbreaks. In the Siliguri outbreak of 2001, a single patient admitted to a private hospital infected 23 hospital staff and 8 visitors (17) . Poor adherence to standard precautions was probably the major reason for this. Also, the difference in strains (BD vs. MY) contributed to the difference in the transmission rates. A study by Clayton et al. showed that ferrets infected with the BD strain had higher RNA levels in the blood as well as increased shedding of the virus in oral secretions, possibly explaining the higher secondary attack rates as well as more severe infection in the Indo-Bangladesh outbreak. It is noteworthy that viral shedding was seen even in the incubation period (18) . The major research findings in different studies are tabulated in Table 1 .",

This finding derived from Malaysian experience during Nipah outbreak needs validation from other occurrences. More experience is required for its validation but this can be a potentially crucial finding to diagnose Nipah encephalitis and decide treatment and post exposure prophylaxis. MRI in acute Nipah encephalitis shows multifocal discrete lesions probably due to areas of micro-infarction. These discrete high-signal-intensity lesions usually measure about 2-7 mm and are disseminated throughout the brain, mainly in the subcortical and deep white matter of the cerebral hemispheres. Mass effect or edema is not usually seen. In relapse or late onset Nipah encephalitis, MRI characteristically shows multiple areas of patchy and confluent cortical involvement (26,27).",

Oral bioavailability of ribavirin is reported to be between 32.6% and 52%, with evidence of first-pass metabolism. Ribavirin is not bound to plasma proteins (34) . Ribavirin was found to cross the blood-brain barrier following oral administration with a mean CSF/plasma ratio of 0.7 (35) . The serious adverse drug reactions with ribavirin are: Neutropenia (8% to 40%), anemia (11% to 35%; children & adolescents: 11%), lymphocytopenia (12% to 14%) and suicidal ideations (36) . Most of the side-effects with ribavirin have been noticed with long term administration. Ribavirin has been found to be teratogenic in animal studies on rodents and rabbits, but no human teratogenic studies are available. Due to the long terminal half-life of elimination of the drug, the minimum interval following treatment with ribavirin before pregnancy can be safely initiated is estimated to be 7 months (36) .",

A patient that meets the criteria for a suspect Nipah case should immediately be isolated and infection control precautions instituted. In general, hospitals in at-risk areas need to be prepared for the management of Nipah cases via hospital screening, admission procedures and triage, and the management of visitor access and movement should be in place to minimize potential exposure.
