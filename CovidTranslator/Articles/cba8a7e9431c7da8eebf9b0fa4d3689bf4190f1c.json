Other common causes of diarrhea in adult camelids were not detected. We conclude that nutritional stress may have predisposed the alpaca to severe ApCoV infection.",

She was 1 of a herd of 42 alpacas that had been purchased approximately 7 weeks earlier. The recently purchased alpacas were added to an established herd of approximately 20 alpacas. This alpaca, as well as a few others, was thin when purchased and, according to owner records, had lost approximately 30 pounds prior to presentation to the BVMTH. The alpacas had recently been switched from a commercial alpaca feed that the original owner had been using to a commercially available no-choke feed (Pac-A-Nutrition Alpaca Crunch). They also were eating free-choice grass hay that had recently been purchased from a new source. A commercial alpaca mineral (Evans Vitamin-Mineral Blend E) was available to all of the animals at all times. The owners had noticed that there were a few animals in the new herd that were not consuming the new feed or the mineral that was accessible to them. These animals, as well as some which were eating the feed, hay, and mineral readily, appeared to be losing weight as well.",

The initial CBC revealed leukopenia (1.4 \u03eb 10 3 ; reference range, 8.3 \u03eb 10 3 to 18.3 \u03eb 10 3 ), marked neutropenia (154/l; reference range, 4,000 to 16,000/l), and nonregenerative anemia (19%; reference range, 29 to 41%). The chemistry panel revealed that the aspartate aminotransferase (AST) (607 IU/liter; reference range, 128 to 450 IU/liter) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) (880 IU/liter; reference range, 10 to 695 IU/liter) levels were both increased. The calcium (6.8 mg/dl; reference range, 7.6 to 10.9 mg/dl), sodium (136 meq/liter; reference range, 148 to 158 meq/liter), potassium (2.1 meq/liter; reference range, 3.6 to 6.2 meq/liter), and magnesium (0.9 meq/liter; reference range, 1.5 to 3.1 meq/liter) levels were extremely low. The total plasma protein (3.2 g/dl; reference range, 4.7 to 7.3 g/dl) and serum albumin (1.0 g/dl; reference range, 2.9 to 5.0) levels were decreased. The clinical nutrition/mineral panel revealed deficiencies in zinc (0.084 ppm; adequate range, 0.33 to 1.57 ppm), selenium (0.07 ppm; adequate range, 0.12 to 0.2 ppm), and magnesium (12.13 ppm; adequate range, 19 to 30 ppm). The mineral panels of herdmates showed that there were numerous animals in the newly acquired herd which were deficient in zinc, selenium, magnesium, and copper. M. avium subsp. paratuberculosis (Johne's disease) antibodies were not detected by agar gel immunodiffusion; lead and arsenic analysis and BVDV PCR were negative as well. While hospitalized, the alpaca was persistently leukopenic and anemic and was consistently neutropenic with a left shift. Colloidal osmotic pressure and albumin and magnesium levels remained consistently decreased despite treatment. LDH and AST levels were elevated for most of the hospitalization period. Fibrinogen remained within the normal limits for the entirety of the hospital stay.",

            "text": "The abnormalities seen on the CBC, including the leukopenia, neutropenia, and left shift, were attributed to inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract with resultant bacterial translocation resulting in toxemia (20) . The nonregenerative anemia was thought to be an anemia of inflammatory and/or chronic disease. Persistent elevation of the AST and LDH levels was most likely due to the hepatic necrosis seen at necropsy. Electrolyte abnormalities seen at presentation, including decreased magnesium, potassium, and sodium levels, were attributable to anorexia and diarrhea. Hypomagnesemia could have further led to renal wasting of potassium, resulting in a more severe hypokalemia than would have been expected. Initially, the alpaca was hypocalcemic, but after correction for the hypoalbumenia, the serum calcium levels were within the normal reference range (9.3 mg/dl; reference range, 7.6 to 10.9 mg/dl). It is likely that the anorexia and cachexia seen, in conjunction with the moderate number of gastrointestinal parasites, were the cause of the hypoalbuminemia and hypoproteinemia with the resultant decrease in colloidal osmotic pressure (20) . The deficiencies seen in the mineral panel, including low serum zinc and selenium levels, can result in skin and fiber abnormalities such as those seen in this animal. Selenium deficiency has also been known to cause diarrhea and a decreased ability to mount an immune response (8) . The increase in the blood urea nitrogen level, without a corresponding increase in creatinine, seen on day 16 was likely due to protein catabolism secondary to the cachexia and emaciation seen at necropsy. The severe copper deficiency found postmortem likely played a role in the anemia, immunosuppression with resultant coronavirus shedding, and excessive fiber loss seen in this alpaca (8) . Many of the postmortem findings, including pathological changes in the lymph nodes, lungs, liver, and kidneys, were attributed to extensive sepsis, most likely due to bacterial translocation secondary to enteritis. Lymphoid atrophy of the spleen, consistent with necropsy findings in this case, is often due to cachexia and wasting diseases (15) .",

            "text": "The primary source of ApCoV in this case is not known. This alpaca originated from a closed herd which may have been na\u00efve to coronavirus. However, commingling with an established herd that was frequently exposed to outside alpacas via the show circuit may have been the source of infection. The severity of disease seen in this alpaca is conceived to be secondary to nutritional stress. This alpaca was thin when purchased and had lost approximately 30 pounds in the months prior to presentation with no other signs of systemic illness prior to presentation. The dentition abnormalities may have played a role in the weight loss, although conceivably this was not the only factor. The fact that other animals in the herd had numerous mineral deficiencies supports the concept that there were nutritional and/or management factors that had a role in the weight loss observed. Additionally, there was a history of several animals from the acquired herd not consuming the newly offered feed and mineral, with resultant weight loss. Moreover, this alpaca was severely copper deficient, as shown by the liver ICP mineral panel at necropsy, which may have played a role in the immunocompromised state in which she was presented at the clinics. Furthermore, the coronavirus infection may have led to malabsorptive diarrhea, leading to further weight loss and mineral deficiencies. Coronavirus infection has been associated with cachexia and weight loss in the mouse and guinea pig (9, 10, 11) . Coronavirus infection has been found to cause weight loss in turkeys and rats (19, 21) . Numerous stressors such as cold weather, warmer seasons, and transportation have been associated with coronavirus infections (3, 6, 16, 18) . However, the presumptive role of nutritional and/or social stress in coronavirus infection has not been described before.",
