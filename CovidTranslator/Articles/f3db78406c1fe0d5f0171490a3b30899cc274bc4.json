The word quarantine implies coercion, restricted movements, isolation from others, loss of property, and loss of liberty. We quarantine that which we seek to avoid or believe to be contaminated. In our use of police power (i.e., regulations, orders, law enforcement, and similar instruments) to restrict the movement of goods and peoples and to require examination, treatment, and confinement, we must also respect civil protections to limit our improper, excessive, or unethical use of this power.",

For the protection of all, there are significant penalties for failure to comply with quarantine orders. These safeguards create a need for adequate records of the decisions made and the evidence used. Physicians should make it a point to know their responsibilities for reporting and controlling infectious diseases in the state in which they practice. Consultation among law enforcement, emergency management, and public health agents is important in setting priorities among competing disaster management and antiterrorism demands.

Leprosy was recognized as contagious, and lepers were separated from the community and isolated from society.As early as 583, authorities restricted the association of lepers with healthy people, building on the biblical sources in Leviticus. 2 In the midfourteenth century, authorities isolated victims of plague in their homes with their families until all had died or recovered.These periods of isolation varied in length, but a 40-day period became fairly standard. 2 History is replete with instances of inequitable application of quarantine measures.The poor and the outcast were more likely to be confined, deprived of their livelihoods, and subjected to inhumane treatment as epidemics swept through. Modern epidemics, such as tuberculosis and HIV, reveal that better understanding of contagion does not always result in equitable responses.

Clear expectations of the length of quarantine and the accompanying disease control steps must be explained to the patent. Maintain trust in the face of insecurity and uncertainty.",
