            "text": "As the world continues to react and respond inefficiently to emerging infectious diseases, such as Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome and the Ebola and Zika viruses, a growing transdisciplinary community has called for a more proactive and holistic approach to prevention and preparedness -One Health. Such an approach presents important opportunities to reduce the impact of disease emergence events and also to mitigate future emergence through improved cross-sectoral coordination. In an attempt to provide proof of concept of the utility of the One Health approach, the US Agency for International Development's PRE-DICT project consortium designed and implemented a targeted, risk-based surveillance strategy based not on humans as sentinels of disease but on detecting viruses early, at their source, where intervention strategies can be implemented before there is opportunity for spillover and spread in people or food animals. Here, we share One Health approaches used by consortium members to illustrate the potential for successful One Health outcomes that can be achieved through collaborative, transdisciplinary partnerships. PREDICT's collaboration with partners around the world on strengthening local capacity to detect hundreds of viruses in wild animals, coupled with a series of cutting-edge virological and analytical activities, have significantly improved our baseline knowledge on the zoonotic pool of viruses and the risk of exposure to people. Further testament to the success of the project's One Health approach and the work of its team of dedicated One Health professionals are the resulting 90 peer-reviewed, scientific publications in under 5 years that improve our understanding of zoonoses and the factors influencing their emergence. The findings are assisting in global health improvements, including surveillance science, diagnostic technologies, understanding of viral evolution, and ecological driver identification. Through its One Health leadership and multi-disciplinary partnerships, PREDICT has forged new networks of professionals from the human, animal, and environmental health sectors to promote global health, improving our understanding of viral disease spillover from wildlife and implementing strategies for preventing and controlling emerging disease threats.",

Recent generations have borne the costs of HIV/AIDS, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), and Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), tallied in lives and livelihoods lost and profound impacts on broader-scale economies. The most recent emergence and spread of the Zika virus and Ebola virus disease (EVD) in West Africa demonstrate how ill prepared the world remains to respond to and control rapidly changing disease dynamics. The global panic resulting in significant financial and social consequences also illustrates the disappearing boundaries between the countries and continents working to protect their citizens. The majority of emerging infectious diseases (EIDs) are zoonotic, or those diseases caused by pathogens that are shared between people and animals (Jones et al., 2008) . These diseases result in tens of thousands of deaths annually, and the economic losses from a single outbreak can amount to tens of billions of dollars (World Bank, 2012) . While prevention and early control of outbreaks could be the key to reducing the impact of epidemics and potential pandemics, especially in less developed countries as demonstrated by the recent EVD epidemic in West Africa, the world still remains positioned only to respond, not to prevent.",

A growing transdisciplinary community, often led by veterinarians and epidemiologists, has responded to this knowledge gap on disease dynamics by advocating for a more holistic or One Health approach that recognizes the need to expand disciplinary expertise in public health. From the beginning of the One Health movement, veterinarians have strongly advocated for an approach that considers all public, animal, and environmental aspects of health as a problem-solving paradigm (Cook et al., 2004) . Notwithstanding the philosophical acceptance of the need for such an approach, the animal and environmental foundations of this three-legged stool often receive only cursory attention when major health problems are addressed in policy and practice.",

In addition to the burden on human and animal health, the economic impacts associated with emerging and pandemic pathogens can be catastrophic, including costs associated with decreased commerce, travel, and tourism, as well as those incurred from treatment and control efforts World Bank, 2012) . As our world becomes increasingly connected through trade and travel, emerging infectious diseases pose a greater threat to the global community, requiring collaboration between ministries of health and institutions involved in health, trade, agriculture, and the environment (Mazet et al., 2014) .

Pioneers of the One Health concept understood the value of comparative medicine and recognized the critical role that environmental factors play in the health of people and animals. Over the past decade, this concept was expanded to be much more inclusive of ecosystem health (Cook et al., 2004) , due in part to the contributions of veterinarians witnessing firsthand the intimate connection among animal, human, and environmental health (Gibbs and Gibbs, 2013) . For example, although veterinarians working in global health recognize the role that wildlife trade and consumption play in human nutrition and livelihoods in many countries around the world, they have expressed concern about the risks these practices pose with regard to spillover of zoonotic pathogens, as well as to conservation (Ahuka-Mundeke et al., 2011; Karesh et al., 2005; Karesh and Noble, 2009; Peeters et al., 2002; Smith et al., 2012; Wolfe et al., 2005) . Human immunodeficiency viruses (HIV) types 1 and 2 are examples of pandemic infections resulting from cross-species transmission of simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) from infected nonhuman primates to humans (Sharp et al., 2010) . The documented spillover and pandemic potential of simian retroviruses illustrate the public health threat associated with close and frequent contact with wild animals, as occurs with wildlife trade and consumption (Switzer et al., 2012) .",

Tuberculosis in nonhuman primates and Asian elephants has long been associated with contact with infected humans (Mikota and Maslow, 2011; Montali et al., 2001) . Investigation into a respiratory outbreak in mountain gorillas in Rwanda by PREDICT veterinarians revealed human metapneumovirus infection in affected individuals (Palacios et al., 2011) . The source of the virus remains unknown; however, the strain was most recently described in human patients in South Africa and likely was transmitted to the gorillas by humans, illustrating the potential for bi-directional spillover of pathogens (Palacios et al., 2011) . The parks where mountain gorillas reside are surrounded by very dense human populations, and research and ecotourism bring thousands of people into direct and indirect contact with the gorillas annually. Veterinarians documented 18 outbreaks of respiratory disease among these gorillas between 1990 and 2010 (Spelman et al., 2013) . It is unclear if the increasing frequency and severity of respiratory disease outbreaks among mountain gorillas in the Virunga Massif (Spelman et al., 2013) are related to the growing human population surrounding the parks. Nevertheless, these findings provided further rationale for implementation of stricter visitation rules in some parts of the mountain gorillas' range in order to minimize the risk of disease transmission between visitors and wild human-habituated gorillas.",

In part because of their One Health leadership and research focused at the animal-human-environmental interface, the agency looked to veterinarians and epidemiologists to build a consortium to implement the surveillance and virus discovery component of the EPT program. The resulting PREDICT project focused on building transdisciplinary collaborations to identify potential zoonotic viral threats at highrisk transmission interfaces where pathogens are most likely to spill over. These interfaces occur in many cultural contexts and regions and usually result from necessary daily activities, such as animal-based food production/acquisition and other incomegenerating activities, like harvesting bat guano for agricultural fertilizer. Through a consortium of global and in-country partners, PREDICT focused on early detection and response to potentially high-consequence animal viruses in regional \"hotspots\" for EIDs, such as central Africa, South and Southeast Asia, and parts of Latin America. The consortium was able to overcome geographic and disciplinary constraints to public health protection by developing multidisciplinary partnerships and establishing networks and platforms for surveillance, diagnostics, and data sharing across stakeholders.",

PREDICT developed a non-invasive sampling technique to obtain saliva samples from primates via a rope soaked in a fruit-based attractant (e.g. jam). The primate was allowed to chew on the rope that was subsequently retrieved for laboratory analysis (Smiley Evans et al., 2015) . PREDICT also helped develop a noninvasive method to detect antibodies against Ebola virus in gorilla feces (Reed et al., 2014) . In coordination with this effort, the consortium determined optimal sampling strategies for detection of fecal samples from great apes in Central Africa (Olson et al., 2012b) . In addition to improving early detection of circulating virus, these methods will aid in identifying immunologically na\u00efve populations of wild apes that are vulnerable to EVD and could benefit from prevention measures (Reed et al., 2014) .",

Because technologies used for viral discovery can be prohibitively expensive and require a high level of expertise, PREDICT virologists compiled a set of relatively simple and inexpensive protocols for the detection of known and novel viruses within viral families that had previously been recognized in animal hosts and known to cause human disease outbreaks, and coupled this cost-effective approach with the selected application of high through-put sequencing (Anthony et al., 2015; Anthony et al., 2013a; Goldstein et al., 2013) . Using this strategy, the team detected hundreds of known and novel viruses. For example, the consortium first isolated and characterized a SARS-like coronavirus from a Chinese horseshoe bat (Rhinolophus sinicus; Ge et al., 2013) . The virus was found to bind to the human ACE-2 cell receptor, suggesting that direct transmission to humans from bats would be possible. During the 2003 SARS outbreak, it was originally thought that bat viruses infected people through civets serving as intermediate hosts. However, this discovery provided compelling evidence that an intermediate host may not be necessary and that mitigation strategies should focus on decreasing human-bat contact (Ge et al., 2013) .",

To investigate the potential pool of zoonotic viruses in target wildlife hosts and the effort required to better understand the diversity of mammalian viruses, the consortium investigated viral diversity in Pteropus giganteus fruit bats and the sampling effort needed to evaluate viral richness. PREDICT and its partners repeatedly sampled the bats and used PCR with consensus viral primers for nine viral families to saturate the discovery of new viruses in the species (Anthony et al., 2013b) . Using statistical techniques similar to those used for estimating vertebrate diversity, the total viral richness within the nine viral families examined in this host was estimated to be 58 viruses. In addition, it was estimated that there is a minimum of 320,000 mammalian viruses that have yet to be discovered in these nine viral families. Sample size targets calculated from this information indicated that while approximately 7000 samples would need to be analyzed to identify 100% of these new viruses, a much more feasible target of 1300 samples would be needed to identify 80% of the novel viruses (Anthony et al., 2013b) .",

Viral communities occurred mostly in non-random patterns between sites and within individuals, suggesting that forecasting changes in viral diversity in wildlife hosts in the face of environmental drivers of disease emergence might be possible (Anthony et al., 2015) .

The consortium also provided technical assistance to governments through pathogen detection and characterization during a number of human-only disease outbreaks. For instance, the team developed and optimized a new, highly sensitive technique to reconstruct the genome of a novel rhabdovirus (Bas-Congo virus, or BASV) associated with three human cases of acute hemorrhagic fever in Democratic Republic of Congo (Grard et al., 2012) . Although the rhabdovirus family had never been documented to cause hemorrhagic fever in people, they are now included in the list of viruses evaluated during hemorrhagic fever outbreaks (Grard et al., 2012) .",

Following a series of HPAI outbreaks in the countries where PREDICT was active, the consortium worked in collaboration with partners to improve our understanding of how and where HPAI strains are emerging. Researchers evaluated data on influenza A viruses reported in the public domain in 32 different countries over a 12-year period (2000 Rejmanek et al., 2015) . Virus evolution was found to be higher in Asian countries, especially in East Asia, relative to North America, providing further evidence of an increased risk of emergence of novel pathogenic strains in East Asia. In addition, large gaps in reporting of influenza A virus activity were identified in Africa and South America. Reporting effort and health care spending (indicator of economic development) were strong predictors of subtype diversity at the country level, emphasizing the need to increase sampling and reporting efforts in under-sampled regions in order to better understand the underlying drivers of influenza A infections around the world (Rejmanek et al., 2015) .",

Successful One Health approaches require cross-sectoral coordination in which partners look beyond their disciplines to function as a team, despite their diverse organizational mandates, funding sources, and standard operating procedures (Mazet et al., 2014) . One Health initiatives often arise from shared threats requiring a multi-agency, cross-sectoral response (Rubin et al., 2014) . For example, the H5N1 HPAI outbreak, which brought together a diverse network of partners from the animal and human health sectors, fostered a number of One Health achievements, including a coordinated tripartite surveillance system, which has enabled improved information and data sharing and joint risk assessment (Rubin et al., 2014) . However, sustaining effective coordination once the threat has diminished presents a significant challenge. Strong collaborations built during these periods of necessary cooperation, can provide a platform for scaling successful approaches into sustainable One Health programs. The One Health Strategic Plan for Rwanda (https://www.google.com/?gws rd=ssl#q=one+health+strategic+plan+rwanda) provides another good example of how a clearly defined strategy and a fundamental understanding of the specific roles and mandates of the partners involved can be an effective approach for scaling and sustaining One Health initiatives.",

            "text": "Through integrated efforts to promote health, effective natural resource management, and economic development, the PREDICT project and its partners have advanced One Health capacity and infrastructure in over 20 countries considered to be hotspots for zoonotic disease emergence. PREDICT worked cooperatively with a wide range of government ministries, scientific institutions, local organizations, and other stakeholders to further local and global One Health initiatives by enabling a structure for effective collaboration across disciplines and geographic boundaries in countries where PREDICT was active. Utilizing a One Health approach, PREDICT focused its efforts on strengthening surveillance and laboratory capacity to detect known zoonotic pathogens and novel viruses at the wildlife-human interface, monitoring humanwildlife interactions for the potential spillover of viral pathogens posing a health threat, and investigating ecological drivers of pathogen spillover into people with the ultimate aim of improved prevention of zoonotic disease emergence. By emphasizing the links among human, animal, and environmental health, PREDICT enabled and supported integrated efforts to promote public health, effective natural resource management, and socio-economic development.",
