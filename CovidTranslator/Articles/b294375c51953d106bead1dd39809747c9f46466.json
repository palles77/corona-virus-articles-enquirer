In this study, we have developed an unbiased modeling approach to identify new pathways and network connections mediating acute lung injury, using severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) as a model pathogen. We utilized a time course of matched virologic, pathological, and transcriptomic data within a novel methodological framework that can detect pathway enrichment among key highly connected network genes. This unbiased approach produced a high-priority list of 4 genes in one pathway out of over 3,500 genes that were differentially expressed following SARS-CoV infection. With these data, we predicted that the urokinase and other wound repair pathways would regulate lethal versus sublethal disease following SARS-CoV infection in mice. We validated the importance of the urokinase pathway for SARS-CoV disease severity using genetically defined knockout mice, proteomic correlates of pathway activation, and pathological disease severity. The results of these studies demonstrate that a fine balance exists between host coagulation and fibrinolysin pathways regulating pathological disease outcomes, including diffuse alveolar damage and acute lung injury, following infection with highly pathogenic respiratory viruses, such as SARS-CoV.",

We identified sets of differentially expressed genes that contribute to ALI and ARDS using lethal and sublethal SARS-CoV infection models. Mathematical prioritization of our gene sets identified the urokinase and extracellular matrix remodeling pathways as the most enriched pathways. By infecting Serpine1-knockout mice, we showed that the urokinase pathway had a significant effect on both lung pathology and overall SARS-CoV pathogenesis. These results demonstrate the effective use of unbiased modeling techniques for identification of high-priority host targets that regulate disease outcomes.

Specifically, they capture complex relationships between host gene expression patterns and emergent correlative behaviors (15) (16) (17) . These approaches posit that genes and protein products are organized into functional modules according to cellular processes and pathways. In this work, we use weighted gene correlation network analysis (WGCNA) methods to interpret the dynamic SARS-CoVmediated transcriptional response. While WGCNA has previously been applied to cancer, mouse, and yeast genetics, we use the approach to enhance systems-based analysis of virus infection (18) (19) (20) . Key to this approach is the ability to discover systemic gene expression patterns based on underlying correlation structures, which is not biased by existing knowledge of pathways or interactions. WGCNA partitions gene expression into groups of transcripts called subnetwork modules with highly correlated behaviors. It has been shown elsewhere that connectivity inferred through WGCNA is a strong predictor of related biological function (21) . A key feature of these subnetwork modules, or eigengenes, is that the most highly connected hub genes within the module provide candidate mediators of disease (16, 17) . We further refined these candidates by modifying the tool to identify enriched pathways associated with candidate lists, allowing us to combine connectivity and predicted network structure with biological functions and known interactions within a hypothesistesting framework.",

The goal was to identify contrasting outcomes for modeling the role of host responses in disease. Groups of 20week-old C56BL6/J (B6) mice were infected with 10 2 to 10 5 PFU of recombinant mouse-adapted SARS-CoV (MA15) or mock infected (phosphate-buffered saline [PBS]). Clinical changes were noted daily, and biological samples were collected at 0, 1, 2, 4, and 7 days postinfection (dpi) to allow for profiling of the different phases of infection. Mice infected with the lowest dose, 10 2 PFU, lost little if any weight and showed few clinical signs of disease (Fig. 1A ). Mice infected with 10 3 or 10 4 PFU experienced transient weight loss and showed minor clinical signs of disease. Infection with 10 5 PFU resulted in continuous weight loss with \u054630% weight loss by day 7; at late time points, these animals showed significant clinical disease, including hunched posture, ruffled fur, decreased locomotion, labored breathing, and death.",

Expanding on the identification of the urokinase pathway, we examined whether conserved RNA expression signatures indicated development of a procoagulant or profibrinolytic state after SARS-CoV infection. Tissue factor, factor VIIa, and Serpine1 are major factors responsible for the development of a procoagulant and antifibrinolytic state in the alveoli (31, 32) . Changes in alveolar hemostatic balance and intra-alveolar fibrin deposition are also stimulated by cytokine expression after ALI. Proinflammatory (interleukin-1\u2424 [IL-1\u2424], tumor necrosis factor alpha [TNF-\u2423], and IL-6) and profibrotic (transforming growth factor \u2424 [TGF-\u2424], connective tissue growth factor [CTGF], and platelet-derived growth factor [PDGF]) cytokine transcripts were significantly elevated, starting by 4 dpi and through the course of the lethal SARS-CoV MA15 infection (see Fig. S5B in the supplemental material). In addition, genes associated with the induction of a procoagulant state (thrombin, factor VIIa, factor Xia, factor XIIa, PLAU, PLAT, tissue factor F2r) (32) and other fibrinolysin pathway components were altered by infection. Both pro-and antifibrinolytic genes in the urokinase pathway showed increased expression in our SARS-CoV infection model, demonstrating the complicated nature of this signaling cascade. Previous reports show that it is rare for one branch of the urokinase pathway to have altered regulation without host feedback loops adjusting the expression of other pathway genes (33) . In general, the transcripts shown in Fig. S5B represent a lung with high levels of inflammatory and fibrinolytic gene expression, and this transcriptional picture is supported by the hemorrhage observed in the lungs of SARS-CoV-infected mice.",

Similarly, surfactant proteins, which typically protect against hyaline membrane formation and lung injury (36) , have reduced expression in both the lethal and sublethal doses of SARS-CoV compared to uninfected controls. However, at late time points, several of these same proteins sharply diverge between the lethal and sublethal doses. Fibrin beta and gamma chain levels are increased in abundance relative to mock infection only at day 7 in the lethal infection. In contrast, fibrin chains continually decrease after 2 dpi in sublethal infection. A similar pattern is observed with keratin 7, with increased protein abundance observed in the lethal dose. To further confirm these findings, we used a Martius scarlet blue (MSB) stain to demonstrate the presence of fibrin deposition in the lungs at day 7. Positive staining was observed in the lungs of lethally infected mice but not in the lungs of mock-infected or sublethally infected animals (Fig. 4B) . Together, the proteomics data are consistent with pathophysiological changes resulting in increased fibrin deposition and hyaline membrane formation in the lungs of lethally infected mice.",

It is important to note that plasminogen and plasmin are indistinguishable using these proteomics methods. Fibronectin, another component downstream of plasmin activation, also demonstrated increased protein expression in the lethal dose compared to the sublethal dose at day 7.

Serpine2 functions similarly to Ser-pine1 in control of PLAT and PLAU activity. IL-1\u2424, Tgfb1, and PLAU all had increased expression in Serpine1 \u03ea/\u03ea lungs at day 4 relative to B6 controls but decreased expression at day 7, while Ptgs2 and Tnf had decreased expression in the Serpine1 \u03ea/\u03ea mice at both time points. These data support the existing evidence of feedback loops within the urokinase pathway as well as confirming the overall dysregulation of the urokinase pathway following SARS-CoV infection. Combined, these transcriptional changes indicate that SARS-CoV-infected Serpine1 \u03ea/\u03ea mice had increased fibrinolytic activity in their lungs and a decreased inflammatory response relative to B6 controls. A simplified schematic of the urokinase pathway in the presence and absence of Serpine1 is shown in Fig. 6A and B, illustrating how the lack of Serpine1 could lead to increased PLAT and PLAU activity and increased hemorrhage and disease.",

This approach was applied to our virus infection data sets containing over 3,500 DE genes. It resulted in the identification and characterization of four highly prioritized genes in the urokinase pathway whose differential expression was significantly associated with increased disease severity. We note that there are a number of enrichment approaches, such as gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) (37) , or hypergeometric test-based approaches, such as GOStat (38) , which can identify genes behaving in coordinated ways to aid in interpreting gene candidates. However, these approaches are often focused on differential expression in the context of functional annotation. With our approach, we focus on de novo-inferred connectivity and the distribution of the most highly connected module members within canonical pathways.

Both histology and proteomic data demonstrated that urokinase activity increased in a dose-dependent manner following SARS-CoV infection. To complete a validation loop, we characterized disease outcomes in Serpine1 \u03ea/\u03ea and PLAT \u03ea/\u03ea mice. The Serpine1 \u03ea/\u03ea mice, deficient in a major protein in the urokinase pathway, were significantly more susceptible to SARS-CoV infection than were WT controls in terms of both weight loss and lung hemorrhage (Fig. 5A and D) , while the PLAT \u03ea/\u03ea mice showed a mixed pathogenic phenotype that suggested improved outcome but significant impairment of lung function (see Fig. S7A and E in the supplemental material). These data confirm predictions that the urokinase pathway and ECM remodeling are important for regulating SARS-CoV pathogenic outcomes and demonstrate the delicate balance between development of hemorrhage and fibrosis following ALI. While previous studies of SARS-CoV pathogenesis showed the presence of fibrin in the lung following infection, the importance of Ser-pine1 and the urokinase pathway in development of disease was unknown. Furthermore, the use of unbiased methods to identify the urokinase pathway as a regulator of SARS-CoV disease represents an important advance in analysis of microarray data.",

Despite significant advances in treatment options, the overall mortality rates remain substantial and range between 30 and 60%, resulting in~75,000 deaths in the United States and over a million deaths globally each year (45) . While the underlying molecular mechanisms governing virus-induced ALI remain to be elucidated, our transcriptomics, proteomics, modeling, and validation approaches using targeted knockout mice have coalesced into a model of altered hemostatic balance defined by the expression of procoagulative and antifibrinolytic factors resulting in the induction of an exudative phase of DAD after infection.

            "text": "Fibrin levels dramatically increased following lethal SARS-CoV MA15 infection ( Fig. 4A and B) . Excess fibrin was likely mediated by Serpine1-driven inhibition of urokinase and tissue type plasminogen activators (PLAU and PLAT) and by blockade of plasmin activity by \u24232-plasmin inhibitor, whose transcripts are elevated following SARS-CoV infection. We suggest that lethal SARS-CoV infection overwhelms the normally protective, profibrinolytic signaling of the urokinase pathway, leading to overall dysregulation, including increased Serpine1 expression, and severe lung disease. While fibrin is required for normal wound healing, persistent and excessive intra-alveolar fibrin levels can contribute to acute inflammatory and chronic interstitial lung disease. Fibrin stimulates the production of profibrotic growth factors (32) , and many profibrotic cytokine transcripts, like TGF-\u2424, CTGF, and PDGF, are elevated following SARS-CoV or influenza virus infection in mice (see Fig. S5 and S6 in the supplemental material) (46, 47) . Pulmonary surfactant protein and transcript signatures are also reduced following acute viral infection (Fig. 4A ) (see also Fig. S5 ) (48) , potentially leading to collapse or closure of alveoli and loss of lung compliance (changes in lung volumes) (49) . In combination, a high-fibrin/low-surfactant intra-alveolar environment provides an ideal environment for fibroblast adherence and growth, resulting in collagen deposition and development of lung fibrosis (50) . Finally, fibrin and fibrin breakdown products increase vascular permeability, stimulate migration and proliferation of inflammatory cells, and promote recruitment of neutrophils to the lung (51, 52) . Although we cannot absolutely ascribe this phenotype to elevation in the levels of fibrin and fibrin breakdown products, fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) analysis shows significant increases in lung neutrophil counts, as a function of increasing SARS-CoV dose (data not shown). More recent studies have also shown that Serpine1 inhibits neutrophil apoptosis (53) , suggesting that neutrophil recruitment and effector function likely contribute to more severe disease outcomes following SARS-CoV MA15 infection. Similar findings have been reported with highly pathogenic influenza viruses, including H5N1 and 1918 influenza viruses (54) .",

The deubiquitinase CYLD provides critical control of Serpine1 expression (58) , and in the absence of CYLD, infected mice develop lung fibrosis. Experiments using the mouse model for pneumonic plague have shown that deletion of the bacterial plasminogen activator, which cleaves plasminogen and also Serpine1, changes the course of disease and protects mice from lethal lung injury (59) .

Mice were anesthetized with a mixture of ketamine and xylazine and intranasally infected with either 50 l of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) alone or MA15 (e.g., 10 2 to 10 5 PFU /animal). Animals were maintained in HEPA-filtered Sealsafe cages (Techniplast, Buguggiate, Italy). All animal housing and care were conducted in accordance with all University of North Carolina (UNC)-Chapel Hill Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee guidelines. Lung tissues from a total of 5 infected mice were harvested at each dose on days 1, 2, 4, and 7 postinfection in the dose-response study. Lung tissues from a total of 4 infected mice were harvested at days 4 and 7 postinfection in the knockout mouse studies. Mock-infected animals were age matched and harvested at each time point. Weight loss significance was determined by Student's t test (Microsoft Excel), and significance in survival data was determined by the Mantel-Cox test (GraphPad). qPCR assays were used to confirm the infection status of all mice. All mouse studies were performed at the University of North Carolina (Animal Welfare Assurance #A3410-01) using protocols approved by the UNC Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC).",

The WGCNA method detects signaling subnetworks or modules consisting of groups of genes that are highly connected according to a neighborhood proximity metric called the topological overlap (TO). TO quantifies the degree of shared network neighbors. Modules are represented as eigengenes by taking the first principal component of each set of module transcripts, which describe most of the variance in the module gene expression. We have adapted WGCNA into a workflow with three key steps: (i) de novo network construction, (ii) consensus network analysis, and (iii) network enrichment (see Fig. S4 in the supplemental material). The de novo network construction and the derivation of signaling modules are described in detail in Text S1 in the supplemental material. In addition to analysis of the individual doses, we utilized a consensus approach to identify modules present across both networks (see Fig. S4 ). Two nodes should be connected in a consensus network only if all of the input networks agree on that connection. We define the consensus network similarity between two nodes as the minimum of the input network similarities. This allows identification of regulatory differences between two networks, even when the resulting topology/modules are conserved.",

We prioritized the statistically validated host response modules to identify signaling events that differed between doses at day 7 based on overall upregulation of the 10 5 -PFU-dose treatment and differential module regulation when comparing treatments. Average log 2 FCs were calculated across modules for each dose. Modules were labeled as upregulated at day 7 if the average log 2 FC was greater than zero. A \u232c average log 2 FC was calculated by subtracting the average log 2 FC for each dose at day 7. Network enrichment was then performed in two stages: functional enrichment using gene ontology (see Text S1 in the supplemental material for details) and connectivity enrichment. To aid in the prioritization of the candidates to be validated within the modules, we examined the connectivity distribution relative to known canonical pathway membership within each module. We first identified canonical pathways that intersected with a given WGCNA module and then took the average TO connectivity between intersecting members. Ten thousand random samplings of sets of genes of the same size were used to derive a null distribution and determine if a given pathway was enriched for TO connectivity. This provides information regarding possible biological relevance to our putative candidates that had been ranked within the module based on their similarity to the eigengene.",
