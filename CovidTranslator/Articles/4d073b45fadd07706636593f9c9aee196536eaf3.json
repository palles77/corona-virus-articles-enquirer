While it is clear the entire Juba population is not at risk for cholera, with the limited data available on population distribution and demographics within the city, it is difficult to estimate the true size of the at risk population. Following Ali et al (1) , we assumed that only those without access to improved sanitation (likely to overlap with those who also have access to safe drinking water) as measured by the UNICEF/WHO Joint Monitoring Program (84%, http://www.wssinfo.org/) were at risk. This resulted in a final at risk population in Juba of 387,512. Thus, we estimated the attack rate to be 10,000 \u00d7 2,071 387,512 = 53.4 per 10,000. It is worth noting that if the entire population of Juba County (minus the camps in this calculation) were assumed to be at risk, the attack rate would then be 10,000 \u00d7 2,071 461,324 = 44.9 per 10,000, which is lower than that estimated in the camps.",

Among those tested with RDTs (Crystal VC, Span Diagnostics), we found that a higher proportion were cholera positive in the camps compared to the community (Technical Appendix Table) , suggesting that the suspected case definition in the camps may have been more specific. We also see that the proportion of RDT-positive cases between under-5s and over-5s did not significantly differ within each setting (using 2-sample test of independent proportions as implemented in R using prop.test). This provides evidence against the hypothesis that another diarrheal pathogen circulated in the camps mostly among children leading to inflated suspected cases in children compared to adults in the camps. While interesting, these results should be interpreted with caution as it is unclear what the criteria were for the use of RDT in the camps and the community, and this likely does not represent a true random sample of the suspected cases in each population.

We then tested the differences between comparison areas with a Wilcoxan Rank Sum test, with a null hypothesis that the number of days with Rt>1 was the same in each population. As we might expect more days in larger populations (like Juba compared to the camps), we also treated each bootstrap as a binomial observation to test whether the proportion of days with Rt>1 differed between the two populations using a simple logistic regression model where the dependent variable was an indicator for Rt>1(one observation for each day in each location) and the dependent variable was location (performed separately for the two comparison groups). As reported in the main text, we found that the probability of any day having a reproductive number greater than unity was significantly larger in unvaccinated camps than vaccinated camps.",
