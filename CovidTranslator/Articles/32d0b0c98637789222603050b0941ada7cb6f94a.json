This reflects not only factors that enable the appearance and globalization of new microbial infections but also improvements in methods for ascertainment. New molecular diagnostic platforms; investments in pathogen surveillance in wildlife, domestic animals and humans; and the advent of social media tools that mine the world wide web for clues to outbreaks of infectious disease are proving invaluable in early recognition of threats to public health. Additionally, models of microbial pathogenesis are becoming more complex, providing insights into the mechanisms by which microorganisms can contribute to chronic illnesses like cancer, peptic ulcer disease and mental illness. Here we review the contributions of each of these elements to infectious disease emergence and strategies for addressing the challenges of pathogen surveillance and discovery.",

            "text": "When the H1N1 influenza virus struck in 1918, little was known about how infectious diseases emerge or their routes of transmission. Indeed, even the identity of the causative agent as a virus (i.e. capable of passing through a filter) rather than the bacterium Hemophilus influenza championed by some leading microbiologists, was in dispute until late in the course of the pandemic 1 . The 1918 virus had a case-fatality rate estimated at 10-20%, spread to 6 continents, infected ~500 million people, and killed approximately 3% of the world's population 2, 3 . The SARS coronavirus pandemic of 2003, the first pandemic of the 21 st century, had case-fatality rate near 10% but infected far fewer people (8, 096) 4 . Transmissibility as estimated by the R0 (the number of cases generated through contact with an infected individual) is similar for influenza (2-3) 5 and SARS (2) (3) (4) (5) 6, 7 . However, the global response to SARS was facilitated by advances in epidemiology and microbiology that enabled rapid containment and identification of the causative agent as a novel coronavirus. The discovery process is faster still today. Whereas two large teams invested several days in characterizing SARS coronavirus genetic material amplified in tissue culture by using classical dideoxy sequencing techniques 8, 9 , high throughput sequencing platforms employed in more recent outbreaks such as LuJo in South Africa have allowed identification of novel agents in clinical materials in 48 to 72 hours 10 .",

Thus, clinicians and public health officials must be prepared to detect and respond to the unexpected. The ongoing development of new antimicrobial drugs, therapeutic antibodies, vaccines and probiotics means that early and accurate diagnosis can have profound implications for medical management and public health. This is particularly true for viral infections where, until recently, opportunities for effective intervention were limited to HIV, hepatitis C virus and herpesvirus infections. Surveillance and discovery efforts are bearing fruit in chronic disorders and in studies of normal physiology as well as in the investigation of acute diseases like pneumonia, diarrhea, meningitis/encephalitis and hemorrhagic fevers. The links between Helicobacter pylori and peptic ulcer 11 , human papillomavirus and cervical cancer 12 and polyomaviruses and Merkel cell carcinoma 13 are prominent examples in which microorganisms contribute to the pathogenesis of disorders that were idiopathic only a few years ago. Insights into the role of the human microbiome in nutrition, allergies and autoimmunity have led to implementation of the same surveillance and discovery platforms employed to investigate classic infectious diseases 14, 15 . Finally, although there have been no recent examples of bioterrorism, the risk has only increased with political instability and the accessibility of synthetic genomics that enable the creation or recreation of virulent pathogens.",

For instance, the number of international airline flights has nearly doubled over the past 15 years from just under 500,000 in 1996 to close to 850,000 in 2011 (U.S. Bureau of Transportation Statistics: www.bts.gov/). John F. Kennedy airport for example, one of two international airports in the greater New York metropolitan area, USA, hosts nonstop flights to 100 international destinations, and serves nearly 12 million international customers annually (http://www.bts.gov/press_releases/2012/bts017_12/html/bts017_12.html). Similar data apply worldwide for airports serving large urban centers. This means that an infected individual or mosquito can rapidly travel around the world in less than 24 hours, making it not surprising that air travel has been implicated in the global dissemination of HIV, SARS coronavirus, West Nile virus, chikungunya virus, influenza virus and M. tuberculosis [16] [17] [18] .",

Recently, with greater appreciation of the importance of pollinators in food production and the recognition of colony collapse disorder, increased attention has been directed towards the potential for emerging infections of honeybees (Apis mellifera) and other pollinators, particularly with regards to viruses, fungi and external parasites 27 . Mariculture (ocean aquaculture) is also at risk of emerging infectious diseases, as demonstrated by recent reports of novel viruses in farmed salmon [28] [29] [30] . Attention has also increasingly focused on the role of land use dynamics in infectious disease emergence 31 . Deforestation and the expansion of agriculture and the extractive industries, particularly in tropical regions with high wildlife biodiversity, has led directly or indirectly to the emergence of HIV/AIDS, Nipah virus and filoviruses 32, 33 .",

However, genetic methods have moved to the forefront in microbial surveillance and diagnostics [40] [41] [42] [43] [44] . The foundation for most of these methods is the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) developed in 1983 by Kary Mullis (See Timeline). PCR requires minimal equipment and operator training, can be completed in minutes rather than days, is less expensive, and has been adapted to portable instruments that can be used in the field in developing countries or near a patient's bedside. Furthermore, like other genetic methods, PCR may succeed in detecting an organism in instances where fastidious requirements confound cultivation. Most PCR assays approved for clinical applications test for the presence of a single type of bacterium or virus. Such assays, described as singleplex, are used to screen for any evidence of infection (e.g., hepatitis B virus in blood products used for transfusion) or to quantitate microorganism levels when assessing response to therapy (e.g. HIV burden in serum or plasma of subjects receiving anti-retroviral medication).",

The emergence of high throughput sequencing over the past decade has enabled the discovery of new microorganisms, rapid resolution of the causes of outbreaks of infectious diseases, and the development of metagenomics, a field wherein investigators inventory the complex microbial communities found in humans, domesticated animals, wildlife, plants and various environments. Although initially confined to specialized laboratories due to high costs for instruments and supplies costs along with requirements for sophisticated personnel, technical improvements have increased access for a broader segment of the research community. One index to the evolution of sequencing technology is the per-base cost which decreased from $5,000 per megabase in 2001 with classical dideoxy methods, to $15 per megabase in 2008 with pyrosequencing (http://www.genome.gov/sequencingcosts), to $0.5 per megabase in 2012 with the Illumina platform 47 . Another is the time required for obtaining sequence data. Whereas the SARS coronavirus genome was sequenced over the course of a week by a large team in 2003 8 a single investigator could sequence that same genome in a few hours in 2012. Recent examples of the power of advancements in methods for genomic sequencing include reports on the evolution of influenza 48 , hepatitis C 49 and human immunodeficiency viruses 50 , the human origin of livestock associated methicillin-resistant Staphyloccocus aureus 51 and the spread of antibiotic resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae between and in health care institutions 52 .",

The challenge now is not in obtaining sequence data but in analyzing it.

Whereas passive surveillance employs data that already exist or are collected routinely, active surveillance implies a new investment in and/or processes for microorganism collection and analysis. A classic example of passive surveillance is the concept of reportable diseases. Most regional and national public health authorities maintain lists of infectious diseases and laboratory tests indicative of infection that must be reported (CDC National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System, http://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/script/ downloads.aspx) These include infections characterized by human-to-human transmission, such as sexually transmissible diseases (e.g., syphilis or gonorrhea) and vaccine-preventable diseases (e.g., measles), as well as those where detection indicates the presence in the environment of an infectious agent that poses a substantial threat to public health, such as hemorrhagic fever viruses or highly pathogenic bacteria like Yersinia pestis, the agent of the bubonic plague. On the non-human side, agricultural authorities monitor infections like foot and mouth disease, which have important economic implications. Passive surveillance is informative and inexpensive, but may underestimate the true frequency of an agent or a disease. Furthermore, by definition it cannot detect risk prior to onset of symptoms.",

Rivers 74 modified them by acknowledging the significance of neutralizing antibodies to an agent as evidence of infection. Fredericks and Relman 75 noted that pathogens may be recognized by molecular methods before they can be cultured, and allowed as evidence the presence of microbial sequences as well as of infectious microorganisms. Thus, although Koch's postulates remain the gold standard, they need not be fulfilled to implicate an agent.

An additional 4 years were required to determine its genomic organization 94, 95 . With specific cloned reagents in hand, I reasoned that it would be straightforward to determine whether BDV was indeed a human pathogen; however, the issue lingered until 2011 when blinded multicenter analyses, molecular and serologic, ultimately revealed no evidence of human infection 96 .",
