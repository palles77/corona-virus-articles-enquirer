Accordingly, the concept of immunomics [5] has been raised, namely exploring the mechanisms of immune responses by using combinational high-throughput approaches including genomics, proteomics and bioinformatics, etc. In the present review, we intend to provide ideas for bridging the advance in immunology with the power of genomic approaches and speculate the future research directions of immunology in the era of genomics and post-genomics.",

            "text": "The inquiry of classical basic immunology covers both the phenotypic and the functional manifestation of immunocytes and immune molecules. Molecules engaged in immune response are mainly characterized as diversity or polymorphism, such as major histocompatibility complex (MHC), cytokines or chemokines in the secreted form, and adhesion molecules in the membrane-exposed form. This, to some extent, may equip the immune system with the pluripotent responses to exterior stimuli. But the diversity or polymorphism of immune molecules makes them more difficult to identify and detect. Feasible and cheap detecting methods derived from genomics research largely fit these studies. One typical example is the determination of polymorphism of Human Leukocyte antigen (HLA) (human MHC molecules) that is called HLA typing. Genes encoding HLA molecules are located on the short arm of chromosome 6 and can be subdivided into three loci. Whereas genes located in MHC Class I and Class II loci encode classic HLA class I (HLA-A, HLA-B and HLA-C) and class II (HLA-DR, DP and DQ) molecules, other genes located in the same regions participate in antigen processing and presentation. A remarkable feature of human MHC genes is the unprecedented and unanticipated extent of their polymorphism ever found in the genome. For some HLA loci, more than 250 alleles have been identified by serological analysis. Molecular sequencing has demonstrated that a single serolocically defined HLA allele may contain multiple variants that differ slightly. Because of their significance in transplantation rejection and disease linkage, an efficient and exact method for HLA typing is required. Both the serological analyses based on complement-dependent cytotoxicity and PCR-based methods like PCR-SSP, PCR-SSO or PCR-RFLP rely on the existing data of HLA typing. Furthermore, the sequencing-based method not only facilitates the HLA typing in a more direct and reliable way, but also makes it possible to detect the new HLA alleles more accurately. Sequencing-based HLA typing thus becomes a pretty substitution for the traditional ones gradually [6] .",

Toll-like receptors (TLRs) were identified in this way. In the 1980s, a group of receptor molecules called Toll were found in drosophila, which were demonstrated to play an important role in fighting against fungal infections [7] . Later on, the structural analogues of this molecule in the mammal which have the same anti-inflammatory effect were discovered in the genome database of the mammals named TLRs [8] . Further studies demonstrate that they belong to the family of pattern recognition receptors involved in the innate immune responses. At present, TLRs and the innate immune responses initiated by these molecules have become the hotspots of immunology research.",

            "text": "One of the important characteristics of immune responses is that molecules and cells involved in the immune responses exert their functions in a network form. This makes it possible that when pathogens invade, immunocytes and immune molecules are activated rapidly for the effective elimination of pathogens. Therefore, the conventional explanation on the structure and function of a single molecule cannot precisely interpret the characteristics of such immune responses. A global strategy applied in the genomics research, on the contrary, is inclined to upgrade the basic immunology to a systematic level. One of the central issues in current immunology research is the exploration of molecular and cellular mechanisms of immune responses at different phases. Gene expression profiling analysis is first adapted to elucidate the molecular characteristics of immunocytes or immune molecules during the activation and differentiation. For instance, na\u00efve CD4 + T cells differentiate into either Th1 or Th2 cells upon different antigen stimulation. These two populations can be characterized as different cytokine secretion patterns: IFN\u03b3 secretion by Th1 cells as well as IL-4 /IL-5/IL-13 by Th2 cells. The cytokines secreted by polarized CD4 + T cells mediate further immune responses and terminal effects. But molecular properties of these two populations and mechanisms of the differentiation processes are still mysterious. Results from genome-wide gene expression analysis of early Th1/Th2 differentiation reveal the certain transcription factor network that is important for the terminal differentiation and the expression of functional groups of genes for the biological properties of Th1/Th2 cells. These data to a large extent enrich our understanding of CD4 + T cell differentiation [9, 10] . Similar strategy has also been applied to dendritic cells [11] research either in the physiological or pathological status [12, 13] , which provides not only the phenotypical information but also molecular mechanisms of immune responses DCs engaged under different situations.",

These high-titer IgGs can be adapted to screen the homologous cDNA expression library derived from tumor patients [16] . Nevertheless, the primary data from library screening is not evident to demonstrate their tumor-specific or tumor-associated property. Therefore, the association study of candidate molecules with tumors needs to be performed first of all. In addition to using traditional sample-based reverse-transcription PCR or immunohistochemistry assay, the global genome or EST data in public database provides a short cut to determine expression patterns of these candidates. The extensive application of Genechips or tissue chips also accelerates the process of property definition. So far, there are more than 2000 tumor antigens determined through CTLs or auto-antibodies responses. Some of them are demonstrated to be good vaccine candidates undergoing clinical trials. Whereas tumor-specific antigens recognized by CTLs evoke effective CTL responses against tumors, the clinical significance of auto-antibodies against tumor antigens is still under investigation, such as the relation between auto-antibodies and pathological behaviors including classification, stages, early diagnosis, recurrence, metastasis, and mortality rate etc. Once there comes the breakthrough of issues mentioned above, these tumorspecific auto-antibodies will facilitate the diagnosis, monitoring and treatment of tumors through intercrossing with genomics technology such as antibody chips technology.",

The concept of immunity to infection refers to a series of immune responses triggered by the immune system to defend the invasive pathogens. The outcome of immune responses thus relies on both pathogens and hosts: If pathogens are able to escape from the attack of the immune system, the hosts suffer from tissue injury even lethality. If the immune system can provoke efficient immune responses, the infection can be controlled and the pathogen be eliminated soon. To explain the immunological mechanisms involved in these contrary outcomes, genomics approaches have been introduced.",

From the side of pathogens, virulence factors and possible pathogenic mechanisms can be deduced according to genome sequences and pathogenic effects through comparative genomics. From the side of hosts, one of the important inquiries associated with genomics is the study on genetic susceptibility/resistance to infection by detecting single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of immune-related molecules. The intact human genome consists of 3 billion nucleotide basepairs, of which 99.9% share similarity at the individual level. Variations occur among the resting 0.1% in which 85% are SNPs. SNPs thus represent the most common hereditable genetic variation in human beings. With the advantage of genomic techniques and public bioinformatics databases, it is accessible to study the SNPs with great convenience. On one hand, re-sequencing technique has unmasked the SNPs in the association study in a more precise way through combining with epidemiological study. On the other hand, more programs have been designed and released for mapping the SNPs haplotype blocks, Tag SNP selection and SNP linkage deequilibrium studies, which motivates the association study of SNPs with infectious diseases. Several reports have described the recent advance in SNPs analysis in association studies. For instance, interferon and its downstream signal transduction are dedicated largely to anti-HCV infection immunity. It has been reported that SNP mutations at four sites of the interferon regulatory factor 1(IRF-1) gene are closely associated with HCV infection [17] . Similarly, SNPs in IL-1 gene loci have been linked with the helicobacter pylori infection [18] , while SNPs in TLR genes are associated with sepsis [19] . Although the present association studies are more focused on the characteristics of SNP mutation patterns, with the development of functional genomics disease-associated SNP studies will shift from phenotypic analysis to functional prediction, including SNPs and the binding capacity of a given gene to transcription factors, SNPs and structure and biological function of immune molecules, SNP mutations and the outcomes of immune responses, etc. These studies will provide direct evidence for the potential of SNPs in prevention, prediction and treatment of infectious diseases.",

Unlike conventional approaches starting from the large scale cultivation of pathogens and purification of proteins from pathogens, reverse vaccinology relies more on the existing genome database to predict the candidate antigens that fit the gold criteria of a potential vaccine through combinational algorithms. The emerging whole genome database of pathogens fulfills the request for vaccine designing in reverse vaccinology. First of all, open reading frames (ORFs) are deduced along the pathogenic genome by using professional ORF finding software. Then subcellular localization of putative proteins deduced from ORFs is analyzed. Those with the secreted or surface-exposed properties and less or no homology to the human genome sequence are more suitable as vaccine candidates for further biological evaluation. By using reverse vaccinology, vaccine designers can greatly minimize the number of vaccine candidates for verification which makes the entire process less time-and money-consuming.",

By using bioinformatics, comparative genomics hybridization and transcriptome analysis, Yang and his co-researchers further have predicted 616 genes encoding surface-exposed proteins, of which 226 genes are considered as potential vaccine candidates after determining their conservation of distribution in certain epidemic serovars and high expression in given serovars [27] .",

            "text": "Following the determination of vaccine antigen candidates, the next step is epitope-mapping of these antigens that can arouse efficient T cell and B cell immune responses. There are several common properties of T cell epitopes. First, T cells recognize an antigen in the form of continuous peptides presented by MHC molecules after being processed by antigen presenting cells. Secondly, the peptides bound to MHC class I molecules with a closed groove are generally nanopeptides while MHC class II molecules bind to a peptide of 12-20 amino acid residues in length due to the open end of the grooves. The two types of peptides interact with MHC molecules with anchor residues at relatively fixed sites. According to the shared structural property and experimentally determined affinity data of MHC binding peptides, professional software has been edited for the prediction of T cell epitopes and their binding capacity to MHC molecules, such as BIMAS [28] , ProPred [29] , SVMHC [30] and MHCpred. The predicted T cell epitopes then undergo in vitro and in vivo experiments to verify their capability of provoking antigen-specific immune responses. Such prediction has already been reported in designing of vaccines to tumor antigens like MAGE1 [31] , HER-2/neu [32] and OVA66 [33] , as listed in Table 1 . Besides, according to the basic principle of MHC binding, some amino acid residues of T cell epitopes can be further replaced or modified with the help of software like QSAR [34] . Such peptides which are called \"supermotifs\" may possess higher binding affinity with similar or stronger capacity to induce immune responses, which play important roles in the vaccine designing against tumors. B cell epitope is defined as a precise surface region of an antigen capable of binding to the variable domain of an antibody. The production of pathogen-specific antibodies can boost host immunity in the resistance to the infection mediated by virus, intracellular or extracellular bacteria. Unlike T cell epitopes, B cell epitopes are either linear (continuous) or conformational (discontinuous), of which amino acid residues are not in a sequence but become spatially juxtaposed in the folded protein. So when B cell epitopes are predicted with bioinformatic methods, the hydrophilic or hydrophobic characteristic of the amino acid residues constituting the intact antigen molecule is one of the most important criteria for consideration. Besides, the three-dimensional structures (either X-ray cystallograph or computatively deduced) of given antigens are also advisory for the accuracy and comprehensibility in the prediction of conformational epitopes. Due to the hypervariability of the antigenbinding region in antibodies (or BCR), algorithm-based prediction of B cell epitopes has lagged far behind that of T cell epitopes. Nevertheless, there are some programs available for B cell epitope prediction, including Bcepred, Discotope [35] , Bcipep [36] . Another strategy to determine B cell epitopes is to screen the peptide phage display library by using antigen-specific mouse monoclonal antibodies generated by the conventional mouse hybridoma technique. With confirmed neutralization activity of these monoclonal antibodies against pathogens, B cell epitope peptides identified are probably able to trigger effective humoral immune responses, which has been demonstrated in the case of helicobacter pylori [37] and SARS virus surface proteins [38] .",
