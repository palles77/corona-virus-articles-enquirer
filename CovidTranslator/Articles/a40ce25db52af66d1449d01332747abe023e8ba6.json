            "text": "THE myelin sheath that enfolds many of the larger axons in the central nervous system (CNS) is formed by oligodendrocytes; one oligodendrocyte myelinates the internodal segment on several neighbouring axons. Selective myelin loss occurs in apparently very different diseases of the human or animal CNS and the mechanisms of demyelination are various. Some leucodystrophies, in which myelin formation is defective, are associated with inborn enzyme deficiencies. I Toxins, including triethyltin, hexachlorophene, lysolecithin, and diphtheria, damage myelin directly whereas oligodendrocytes are affected by cuprizone or ethidium bromide; demyelination occurs in metabolic disorders and in response to mechanical abnormalities, including compression. But in demyelinating diseases of the human CNS viral and immunological mechanisms, acting alone or in combination, are of particular importance. Demyelination in patients with progressive multifocal leucoencephalopathy (which usually affects immunosuppressed individuals) results from oligodendrocyte infection by the papovaviruses SV40 or JC. In subacute sclerosing panencephalitis measles virus infection of oligodendrocytes persists despite an immunological response to the virus;' it is not clear to what extent this response is involved in pathogenesis of the disease and similar difficulties arise in determining the mechanism of demyelination in animals or man infected by canine distemper and herpes simplex, amongst other neurotropic viruses.5 Experimentally, immunologically mediated demyelination is seen in the presence of myelin-basicprotein-reactive lymphocytes and as a result of antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity, or as an innocent bystander caught up in cell-mediated immune responses directed against non-neural antigens introduced into the CNS.6 Immunological factors are predominantly important in the myelin In acute disseminated encephalomyelitis, which complicates occasional cases of measles and other childhood infections or vaccinations, peripheral blood and cerebrospinal fluid lymphocytes are sensitised to myelin basic protein;' morphological appearances suggest that demyelination is due to direct contact between intact myelin and mononuclear cell infiltrates, followed by phagocytosis. In experimental allergic encephalomyelitis, multifocal demyelination is caused by myelin-basic-proteinreactive T lymphocytes and the disease can be adoptively transferred by means of these cells.8",

            "text": "In many of these disorders of the CNS myelin damage is reversible. Remyelination is characterised by inappropriately thin myelin, reduced distance between neighbouring nodes of Ranvier, and a similar relation between the oligodendrocyte and axon to that seen during normal myelin development.9 In the peripheral nervous system myelin is formed by Schwann cells, and their capacity for repair is greater than that of oligodendrocytes in the CNS. Schwann cells can migrate and remyelinate some parts of the CNS but oligodendrocyte and Schwann-cell myelin repair are morphologically distinguishable.\" Mature oligodendrocytes probably cannot regenerate\" and remyelinating cells, appearing in areas of myelin damage, may be derived from a primitive cell that can undergo oligodendrocyte differentiation. In-vitro work with galactocerebroside (GC), glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), and the monoclonal antibody A2B5, as cell surface markers, has shown that a factor present in fetal calf serum determines whether this progenitor cell develops into an oligodendrocyte (GC positive) or type 2 astrocyte (A2B5/GFAP positive). 12 An immunological role for astrocytes, first suggested by the finding that they release interleukin-1 after stimulation by various antigens,'3 is also implicated by the demonstration, with cultured newborn rat GFAP positive cells,' that astrocytes act as antigen-specific, major-histocompatibility-complex-restricted, antigenpresenting cells. In these experiments, GFAP-positive cells adhered to syngeneic myelin-basic-proteinsensitised T lymphocyte lines cultured in the presence of myelin basic protein, and adherent T cells 7. Lisak subsequently underwent blast-cell transformation; allogeneic T cells did not associate with astrocytes or undergo blastogenesis. The density of surface la antigen increased on astrocytes exposed to sensitised syngeneic but not allogeneic T cells and myelin basic protein.",

            "text": "These observations on the role of astrocytes are relevant to the commonest demyelinating disease in man, multiple sclerosis (MS), in which the presence of demyelination must usually be inferred during life from clinical criteria supplemented by laboratory findings. The myelin damage is associated with CNS infiltration by IgG secreting cellsls and T lymphocytes predominantly of the cytotoxic/suppressor subset; the latter are concentrated at the edge of lesions and extend into unaffected tissue. 16 In chronic MS lesions there are reduced numbers of oligodendrocytes but astrocytes are abundant; astrocyte proliferation could represent an unsuccessful attempt at oligodendrocyte regeneration, perhaps due to lack of a critical signal which, if present, would promote appropriate progenitor differentiation. Morphological changes indicative of remyelination are present at the edge of many chronic MS plaques.\" This can be attributed to oligodendrocyte activity but Schwann-cell remyelination is seen in subpial spinal cord plaques. Repaired myelin can restore normal physiological function to previously demyelinated axons18 but the extent to which this contributes to clinical recovery in MS is uncertain. The time-course of myelin repair cannot satisfactorily explain the more rapid clinical improvement in some patients with MS and similar difficulties arise when we try to relate onset of symptoms to rate of myelin breakdown. Synaptic reorganisation, redundancy in the pathway subserving a particular function, and resolution of oedema could in part explain these discrepancies but sera from patients with MS and some other individuals contain a complement-dependent factor that can produce rapid neuroelectric blocking.19 There is indirect evidence suggesting that the complement system itself could be involved in producing reversible non-lytic myelin or oligodendrocyte damage in the CNS of patients with MS,2O which might account for the transient symptoms often observed early in the disease; fixed or slowly progressive symptoms and signs, seen later in the course, can be explained by accumulated myelin damage. Viral of animal models in which viruses initiate immunologically mediated myelin damage should throw light on the pathogenesis of the disease. A relapsing/remitting demyelinating illness can be induced in certain strains of mice by means of Theiler murine encephalomyelitis virus.5 Remyelination by Schwann cells is seen and the myelin damage can be prevented by immunosuppression. The mechanism of tissue damage is not fully understood but preliminary findings indicate that mononuclear cells cause vesicular disruption and strip the myelin sheaths. A non-virulent strain of Semliki Forest virus (SFV) produces demyelination with remyelination in mice; the myelin damage is T-cell dependent and infiltrating lymphocytes show close association with astrocytes2'-appearances similar to the in-vitro adherence between astrocytes and myelin-basicprotein-reactive T-cell lines.14 SFV obtained from murine brain reacts with antibodies against various brain glycolipids, but not myelin itself so it is possible that bystander demyelination has occurred as part of an immune response against virus with host glycolipid incorporated in its coat. The pathogenesis of myelin damage after infection by the murine coronavirus JHM has been evaluated in more detail. Temperaturesensitive viral mutants cause a relapsing subacute demyelinating encephalomyelitis -21 3 circulating lymphocytes and those derived from solid lymphoid organs of affected rats show myelin-basic-protein sensitivity equivalent to that seen in experimental allergic encephalomyelitis. Histological lesions and some clinical signs appear in previously healthy animals after adoptive transfer of myelin-basic-proteinstimulated mononuclear cells from rats with subacute demyelinating encephalomyelitis.24 The induction of these virus-provoked immunologically mediated models of demyelination is also dependent on age and genetic background of recipients ;25 there are similar influences on susceptibility to MS, suggesting that in both circumstances myelin damage is the result of a complex interaction between infective, immunological, and genetic factors, no one of which by itself is necessarily abnormal or capable of damaging myelin. But the investigation of these increasingly precise animal models of human demyelinating disease now provides an opportunity for understanding mechanisms of demyelination and thereby providing a rational basis for treatment in MS.",
