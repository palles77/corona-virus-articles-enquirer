The site of synthesis of most glycoproteins is on membranebound ribosomes of the rough endoplasmic reticulum, where high-mannose-type oligosaccharides are transferred en bloc from dolichol phosphate donors to asparagine residues on nascent chains (Struck and Lennarz, 1980) and small hydrophobic leader sequences are removed (Blobel et al., 1979) . The polypeptides are then transported by unknown mechanisms, perhaps involving clathrin-coated vesicles (Rothman et al., 1980) to the Golgi apparatus, where fatty acid molecules may be attached (Schmidt and Schlesinger, 1980; Dunphy et al., 1981) and highmannose asparagine-linked (N-linked) oligosaccharides are processed to complex-type oligosaccharides (Tabas and Kornfeld, 1979; Bretz et al., 1980; Bennett and O'Shaughnessy, 1981; Roth and Berger, 1982) . From the Golgi apparatus the glycoproteins move to\" the cell surface or are targeted to cellular organelles such as the lysosomes (Neufeld and Ashwell, 1980) .",

The structures of these oligosaccharide chains vary from disaccharides composed of GalNAc and sialic acid to large oligosaccharides of 20 sugar residues containing GalNAc, galactose, N-acetylglucosamine, fucose and sialic acid . Several studies have addressed the question of the stage and location at which O-linked oligosaccharides are attached to glycoproteins during their intracellular transport. Strous (1979) concluded that GalNAc could be added in Oglycosidic linkage to growing polypeptides in the rough endoplasmic reticulum, whereas others (Kim et al., 1971; Ko and Raghupathy, 1972; Hanover et al., 1980) have found that enzymes capable of mediating such reactions are enriched in smooth endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi membranes rather than in rough endoplasmic reticulum membranes. Cells infected with herpes simplex virus provide a useful system for investigating the processes discussed above. Previous studies have shown that glycoproteins specified by herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSVl) contain O-linked oligosaccharides (Oloffson et al., 1981) as well as N-linked oligosaccharides (Pizer et al., 1980; Serafini-Cessi and Campadelli-Fiume, 1981; Person et al., 1982; Wenske et al., 1982) . We have confirmed these findings, further characterized the O-linked oligosaccharides and shown that 3H-palmitate is incorporated into one of the HSVl glycoproteins.",

Using the discrete shifts in electrophoretic mobilities that occur during posttranslational processing of these glycoproteins as a marker for the acquisition of O-linked oligosaccharides, we have investigated the temporal order in which other posttranslational modifications (fatty acid acylation and processing of N-linked oligosaccharides) occur relative to these shifts. These studies were carried out not only under conditions designed to allow normal glycoprotein processing, but also in the presence of monensin, an ionophore known to cause accumulation of secreted and membrane proteins and virions in Golgi-derived vacuoles (Tartakoff and Vassalli, 1978; Uchida et al., 1979; Johnson and Schlesinger, 1980; Johnson and Spear, 1982) , and in ricin-resistant cells defective in the processing of N-linked oligosaccharides.",

Under appropriate conditions this enzyme released oligosaccharides from the mature form of HSVl gC, and the released material had an elution profile very similar to that of the oligosaccharides released by alkaline borohydride (Figure 2A ). The distribution of label in the three peaks was somewhat different in the GalNAc oligosaccharidase digest, perhaps because the larger oligosaccharides were more resistant to release by the enzyme. It has been suggested that this enzyme is less active in removing sialated oligosaccharides than desialated oligosaccharides (N. Pomato, personnal communication). GalNAc oligosaccharidase did not release 14Cglucosamine-labeled oligosaccharides from VSV G protein under these conditions ( Figure 2B ). In addition, treatment of VSV G protein with this enzyme did not affect the mobility of the glycoprotein on SDSpolyacrylamide gels, as might have been observed if oligosaccharides or monosaccharides had been removed ( Figure 3A ).",

In fact, the mobilities of the enzyme-treated, mature glycoproteins resembled closely those of their respective immature forms, suggesting that the shifts in mobility that occur during the maturation of these glycoproteins result primarily from the addition or extension of O-linked oligosaccharide chains as a posttranslational, rather than a cotranslational, modification. The shifts in electrophoretic mobilities of the glycoproteins occur some 20 min to 3 hr after the polypeptides are synthesized and partially glycosylated. It should be noted that the use of GalNAc oligosaccharidase at levels 10 times higher than used in these studies in the absence of ovalbumin produced shifts in the mobilities of VSV G protein and of the immature HSVl glycoproteins, suggesting the presence of contaminating exoglycosidic or endoglycosidic activities.

The results, shown in Figure  5 , demonstrate that there were few if any oligosaccharides or monosaccharides released under these conditions. The second experiment was to determine whether GalNAc oligosaccharidase altered the elec- trophoretic mobilities of gD and gC isolated from monensin-treated cells by immunoprecipitation. The data in Figure 6 illustrate our previous finding that monensin blocks the modifications of the glycoproteins responsible for decreased electrophoretic mobility, and show also that the glycoproteins accumulating in monensin-treated cells were resistant to the enzyme. Taken together, these findings provide evidence that monensin blocks the attachment of O-linked oligosaccharides to herpes simplex virus glycoproteins and that these oligosaccharides are largely responsible for the shifts in electrophoretic mobilities normally observed.

The results of this study suggested that the virion envelope, acquired at the inner nuclear membrane, initially contains immature glycoproteins that are processed to the mature forms as the virions are transported through the Golgi apparatus. It seems unlikely that O-linked oligosaccharides play any role in the targeting of HSVl glycoproteins to the nuclear membrane, but they could conceivably play some role in the transport of viral glycoproteins or virions to the cell surface. Also, addition of oligosaccharides to serine and threonine residues on cellular and viral glycoproteins, already glycosylated at asparagine residues, may lead to increased hydration of the cell or virion surface and increased protection from proteolytic degradation.",
