Is it those who wrote the regulations, those enforcing the regulations, those being regulated or the science underpinning the regulations? In seeking answers to these questions, this paper explores the regulatory process and the contribution of science. It takes as examples the role of the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority (APVMA) in regulating veterinary products, of the Security Sensitive Biological Agents regulations in managing the risks from specific pathogens, the Quarantine Act regulations as applied to containment facilities and the development of welfare standards. By dealing with products, pathogens, places and ''pets'' it provides a broad oversight of how regulations have been developed and applied from different perspectives and highlights the differing roles that science and research play both in developing policy and regulations. What is clear is that in the presence of good science it is usually possible to develop sound and defensible regulations e.g. those managed by APVMA, but when there is a lack of science to underpin the regulations, problems can arise e.g. in the case of animal welfare.",

Headlines such as ''Regulators show no compassion for our farmers'' (Anon 2013) were typical of the types of comments being received. The newly appointed Coalition Government in Australia has vowed to cut regulation and ''red tape'' profoundly in the coming months. This paper explores why we have regulations and examines a number of contrasting examples of the development and application of regulations in different agricultural areas. It then uses these examples to comment on the process and outcomes of our current regulatory environment for agriculture.",

There are many types of regulations including those that protect us from ourselves and the things we use, those that facilitate how we work together and how we trade, those that protect our fauna and our flora and those that protect our natural and built environment. There are many reasons for having such regulations including protecting us, our flora and fauna and our environment, ensuring that the products available to us are safe and that the world we live in is as safe as it can be. We need to ensure that the things we use do what they are meant to and do so in a way that ensures quality and fitness for purpose. We need to make sure that we receive value from our investments and that we are protected from malpractice in industry. In a nutshell, regulations exist to ensure fairness, openness and equality. 1 Science and research should contribute at all stages to the regulatory process. Most government policy has an underpinning basis of good science and in drafting the regulations that underpin the policy, it is crucial to ensure that they themselves are based on sound science, that they inherently make sense and that they have processes for compliance monitoring e.g. are enforceable.",

This scheme works in conjunction with SSBA standards to provide the operational detail and the Act allows for fines and imprisonment for breaches of these regulations.

Notably however, the list of agents was produced behind ''closed doors'' and whilst obviously risk based, the set of criteria remained secret. There is currently a process of review and re-assessment of these two lists but again without reference to the wider scientific community. One underlying feeling was that the regulations and standards were based on ''what would work'' rather than a genuine scientific assessment of risk. The obvious outcome of these new regulations are that considerably less institutes and people now handle Tier One, and to a lesser extent, Tier Two agents and that the whole process of working with SSBAs is costly and time consuming. This is a set of regulations based around reducing the risk of a bioterrorist event in Australia. It has had an enormous impact for those wishing to undertake research or carry out diagnostic work on those pathogens in both Tier One and Two. For the most part this has resulted in a considerable increase in the cost of doing such work and a major reduction in the number of scientists now engaged in such work. But has it quantifiably reduced the likelihood of a bioterrorist attack by restricting access to, and use of potential bio-weapons? It is unlikely that such data would be made available, even if it existed but it does make the impost of these regulations on the science communities somewhat more difficult to accept.",

In fact very little data exists to demonstrate the utility of showering out of such facilities in terms of reducing pathogen escape. There may be value in other terms but for reducing the risk of a pathogen escape, the data does not exist. Yet it is a firm regulation for all such facilities. It should be noted that a similar lack of data supports the use of chemical disinfectants for decontamination of PC4 suits although this would perhaps be a nondebateable requirement. -Discontinuation of the use of formaldehyde. It is now widely accepted that the use of formaldehyde must be discontinued as a room disinfectant even though it has proved safe and effective for this use over many years. The Group of High-Containment Facility Directors pleaded three years ago for the continued use of this disinfectant for room decontamination but to no avail and the regulator has all but banned the use of formaldehyde as it classified by the International Agency for Research on Cancer as a carcinogen and is a known allergen and irritant. There is however no real scientific data on the negative impacts of formaldehyde used for the purpose of room disinfection where adequate health and safety regulations exists to manage the risks to personnel. -Use of fly screens in PC3 and PC4 facilities. In high containment facilities, the input air is normally filtered through a high efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filter to remove any virus (or larger pathogen) from entering such buildings. This process is repeated with the air leaving the building. Current regulations being applied by the Office of Gene Regulator (OGTR) seem to insist that over and above this, a fly screen must be placed inside of the HEPA filter to prevent flies entering such facilities. Placing such a filter on the outside of the HEPA filter might be valuable in protecting such expensive filters but the regulation demands it be on the inside. It seems absurd to consider that a filter designed to prevent a virus entering the facility would allow a fly though.",
