The best predictor of detecting a respiratory virus in these infants was the NICU provider ordering respiratory viral testing, which was performed in 6 (75%) of the 8 PCRpositive infants and was positive in only 2 infants (Tables II and III) . However, at PMH, a direct fluorescent antibody test was performed, which lacks optimal sensitivity and would not detect enterovirus/rhinovirus and coronaviruses.

These results argue for not only more frequent testing of infants but also the use of optimal molecular diagnostic methodologies. [18] [19] [20] [21] 28 Although both multiplex assays that were used in this study, Luminex xTag and GenMark eSensor panels, offer a larger menu of potential viral pathogens compared with traditional virologic methods, not all of the viruses identified in the patients were detected by both test kits. Only 3 infants (1, rhinovirus/enterovirus; 2, parainfluenza-3 virus) were detected by both multiplex PCR panels. This result likely is attributable to the differences in both the composition of their multiplex primer targets for different viruses as well as the lower limit of detection of viral particles by each assay. Our findings support the better sensitivity of Gen-Mark for detection of coronaviruses and rhinovirus. 22 The 2 infants who were positive for enterovirus/rhinovirus by Luminex xTag testing but negative by the GenMark eSensor panel could have been infected with enterovirus rather than rhinovirus because enterovirus is not detected by the GenMark eSensor kit.

On the other hand, all 8 cases represented health care-associated infections that if appropriately diagnosed, could lead to optimal strategies to prevent their occurrence. Another limitation is that detection of nucleic acid from the respiratory tracts of infants in the NICU could represent false-positive results, prolonged shedding from a preceding infection, or even colonization rather than acute infection. 32 A strength of this study was its prospective nature that identified infants with clinical signs of possible sepsis and studied the potential impact of a respiratory viral infection. Nonetheless, the number of respiratory viral infections may have been underestimated if the clinical signs of a viral respiratory infection were confused with other events like frequent desaturation episodes or increasing oxygen requirement and not a bacterial infection that would have made the infant eligible for the study. The question also remains whether the virus was causing the clinical signs or whether it was a previously unidentified infection in which shedding was ongoing. The latter issue may require the inclusion of healthy infants in future studies of respiratory viral testing in the NICU. In addition, future studies involving microarray analysis for studying the gene expression profiles of infected infants may help to resolve this issue by differentiating infection from possible colonization. 33 n for assistance with patient enrollment at WIH; Melody Bush, RPh, Sara Mureeba, PharmD, Sheeba Tharayil, PharmD, and John Gard, PharmD, of the PMH NICU pharmacy for their assistance in patient identification; and Fabio Mosca, MD, for providing Dr Ronchi the opportunity to perform clinical research at UT Southwestern.",
