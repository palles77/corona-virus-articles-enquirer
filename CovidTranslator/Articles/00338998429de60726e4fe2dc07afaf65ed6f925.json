The illness is characterized by signs of anorexia, lethargy, diarrhea, variable fever, and in some cases laminitis, and is responsive to systemic tetracyclines and intensive fluid therapy. Limited serologic testing (immunofluorescence assay, IFA) has provided some evidence that the disease may be linked to Ehrlichia risticii, the agent of Potomac horse fever. 1,a Owing to the remarkably high false-positive rate of the E. risticii IFA, 4 however, as well as an absence of confirmatory findings (e.g., isolation or detection of the causative agent), the etiology of this seasonally-recurring illness has remained unclear.",

In early May 1996, a 10-9 1 2-+- year-old Quarter Horse gelding living along the Shasta River in Weed, California (Siskiyou County), was examined for an illness of 1-2 days' duration. The horse had resided in the county for only a year and had been vaccinated in the spring for E. risticii by its owner. The horse was alert and eating, with audible gut sounds and a profuse, soft-to-watery diarrhea. The rectaltemperature was 99.5~ the heart rate 44 bpm, and the capillary refill time 2 seconds. Hematologic abnormalities included neutrophilia with a left shift, lymphopenia, and elevated fibrinogen. The horse was treated aggressively with over 30 liters of lactated Ringer's solution i.v., along with oral electrolytes, mineral oil, activated charcoal, non-steroidal antiinflammatory agents, and antibiotics (including systemic oxytetracycline). The gelding had been on antibiotics for about 24 hours at the time a blood sample was drawn for PCR. The diarrhea ceased within 48 hours of initiation of therapy and the horse made an uneventful recovery over the next week.",

Clinical findings included a rectal temperature of 101.8~ a pulse rate of 60, and a respiratory rate of 30. Moderate scleral injection was noted. Decreased abdominal sounds and a profuse, watery diarrhea were evident. Digital pulses were normal. A fecal sample was positive for strongyles and protozoans. The horse was treated with intravenous fluids, a nonsteroidal antiinflammatory agent, and oxytetracycline. A blood sample for PCR was obtained prior to oxytetracycline therapy.

Similarly, laminitis is a significant complication in a percentage of cases, s,l~ Interestingly, the gradual spread of SRC farther away from the river as the season progresses is an exact echo of the initial descriptions of Potomac horse fever along the Potomac River. 8 Horses with SRC are indistinguishable clinically from Potomac horse fever cases we have identified in nearby Klamath Falls in southern Oregon, a where the disease is known locally as \"ditch fever\" from its association with pastures bordering irrigation ditches. The Klamath Falls area is contained within a northern excursion of the Siskiyou/ Shasta ecosystem, a combined upper Sonoran and transition zone that sweeps across portions of southern Oregon but is inhabited by vegetation and wildlife that are clearly Californian. 11 Although the vector of E. risticii remains unidentifiedfl ~ it seems reasonable to suspect that if it is present in Klamath Falls, it may be present in Siskiyou and Shasta counties as well. Available data suggest that the vector is not a tick, but is instead an organism closely associated in some way with river and irrigation water. 2,1~",

The genetic differences among these strains are mirrored in their antigenic differences. 5,13 It has been suggested that the degree of divergence shown by the Kentucky and Ohio 081 strains from E. risticii-Illinois may justify their removal from the species risticii and reassignment to separate species status. 5 Thus it is possible that Potomac horse fever (and thus SRC) may be caused by more than a single species of the genus Ehrlichia. Isolation and cultivation of various strains of E. risticii from different areas of the country should improve our understanding of the genetic and antigenic divergence of the organism, and aid in the development of more effective vaccines and serodiagnostic tests.",

This part of California may be one of the few areas of the state where conditions necessary for the propagation and transmission of E. risticii and its reservoir hosts/vectors exist; overall the occurrence of Potomac horse fever in California horses appears to be low. 4 Considering that SRC has been recognized in the region for at least 25 years, its clinical discovery appears to predate that of Potomac horse fever itself, which was first reported only in 1979. 6 It is thus interesting to reflect how, but for the vicissitudes of history, the disease caused by E. risticii might just as easily have been named \"Shasta horse fever.\"",
