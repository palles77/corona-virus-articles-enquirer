Creating a step-by-step approach to suspected or COVID-positive patients from the time they enter the endoscopy unit to the time they leave and ensuring everyone on the team is on the same page was also addressed. Once the team has created this detailed workflow with clear delineation of who is responsible for each step, and who to call for any necessary equipment that may not be readily available in the endoscopy unit such as powered air purifying respirators (PAPRs), mock drills should be conducted with the teams.",

We have classified nonurgent procedures into nonurgent/perform and nonurgent/postpone. Examples of nonurgent cases that may be performed include cancer staging and prosthetic removal. All screening and most surveillance procedures should be delayed. Many diagnostic procedures, including evaluation of chronic GERD, abdominal pain, and diarrhea may be postponed as well. Leveraging information technologies can be helpful in these nonstandard workflows. We created custom-built reports for providers within the electronic health record (EHR) to facilitate triaging and rescheduling patients. The procedure list is reviewed and categorized by a nonphysician healthcare provider, with final review by a physician. The postponed cases are further classified into how long they can wait (1 month, 2 months, 3 months, etc), and by which providers can perform the case. Some cases involving complex situations may need multidisciplinary input and as well as discussion with the patient before making a final decision. As a result, we have cut our daily endoscopy volume by over 80% and closed our ambulatory endoscopy practice.",

As nearly 50% of infected patients report gastrointestinal symptoms including anorexia in over 80% and diarrhea in nearly 30% with 3% having only GI symptoms without respiratory issues, 3, 4 we have added these gastrointestinal symptoms to the list of prescreening questions with importance placed on duration of symptoms. All scheduled patients are called the day before by nurses for screening and the same questions are again asked the day of the procedure in addition to measuring their temperature. Our hospital created screening forms integrated into the EHR to facilitate standardized screening before procedures.

To help meet this requirement, we only allow 1 family member/chaperone per patient who waits in a centralized waiting area, and this visitor cannot enter the pre-or postprocedure areas. Soetikno et al suggested that suspected and COVID-19 positive patients should be given a mask and separated from other patients by at least 6 feet, or alternatively placed in a negative pressure room. We believe the latter should be emphasized with more stringent and immediate isolation precautions being instituted for all these patients, and procedures performed in airborne infection isolation rooms that adhere to Level 3 biosafety requirements. We also agree with the need for a separate toilet as part of the isolation to minimize spread of infection due to bioaerosols from the toilet plume. If these resources are not available in the endoscopy unit, the cases should be performed where the proper facilities are available. These cases should also be preferably performed at the end of the day with patients recovered in the procedure room, or back in their isolation unit.",

This makes all endoscopic procedures high risk from an infectious standpoint, and appropriate PPE is recommended. This is an important point. N95s are recommended for high-risk patients undergoing any endoscopic procedure with a standard surgical mask recommended for low risk patients. However, we believe there is a spectrum of risk-severity that is regional and temporal in nature. In a pandemic where asymptomatic transmission is known to occur, significant undertesting continues, and society is expected to practice extreme physical distancing with closure of all nonessential businesses, are there any truly low-risk patients? Remember that COVID-19 is thought to be at least 3 times as contagious as the flu virus, and the majority of cases are thought to occur by asymptomatic transmission. It makes little sense for healthcare providers to perform aerosolizing procedures, with patients coughing or passing gas on them, while not wearing an N95 mask or better.",

            "text": "We believe it is important to use full PPE for all endoscopic procedures while in a pandemic such as this especially in areas with community spread, because no one is truly low risk given our ongoing difficulties with testing. A study from China showed that no medical staff working in high-risk departments who wore N95s and practiced strict hand hygiene regardless of patient's infection status became infected 5 . Ideally, an N95 and face shield should be used with other standard PPE for all endoscopy cases, and PAPR for known COVID-19 positive cases if the case absolutely cannot be deferred. The suggestion to use PAPRs for COVID-19 positive patients is born from China's anecdotal experience during endoscopic endonasal procedures where infection spread was apparently not controlled with N95 and only possible after use of PAPRs. We fully appreciate that PPEs are currently in tight supply; however, with careful conservation the above may be possible. It starts with only doing procedures that are absolutely necessary. PPE use should be tightly regulated. Our hospital has gathered all masks and face shields and are having every provider sign one out each day as needed. Before this, we had a PPE station in the unit where the provider signed out masks using their ID, employee number, and patient medical record number. The mask can be reused as long as it is functional, not soiled, and not used in a suspected or COVIDpositive patient. It is important to cover the N95 to prevent soiling. We prefer a face shield for this purpose because surgical masks are also running low throughout the country. A guide to proper extended use and reuse is provided at the CDC. 6 Proper donning and doffing practices should also be followed. 7 It is important to remove the face shield and N95 after dirty gloves are removed without touching the front of the shield or mask (with careful hand washing following mask removal). The face shield should be cleaned with disinfectant wipes before storage. UV-C light can be effective at disinfecting masks and should be considered. Each PPE should be stored in its own paper bag labeled with the provider's name; therefore, one bag may be for N95 and another for the face shield. If the use of N95 with all high-risk procedures is not possible, COVID-19 testing to better risk stratify patients before all endoscopy cases may be considered as an alternative. Ultimately, testing all patients before high-risk procedures such as endoscopy is likely the best approach; however, this will depend on significant expansion of testing capabilities. Hopefully, the development of point-of-care testing with rapid results and increasing testing availability will make this a reality soon.",

In addition, providers who are at higher risk due to their age, comorbidities, or immune status have been reassigned to other tasks including virtual visits and triaging.

This information flow includes having reliable (1) top-down information from CDC, state and local DPH, medical societies, and departmental and hospital leadership and (2) accurate assessment of relevant metrics specific to the endoscopy unit. For the latter, a combination of automated means through software and manual workflows can be used to gather important data. Initial considerations may include number of symptomatic staff, number of available reserve staff, number of active procedure rooms, local epidemiology and anticipated case burden (inpatient and outpatient), stocks of PPE, and the case composition of scheduled patients among others. Additionally, what is considered pertinent data may change over time as the pandemic evolves. It is vital to keep monitoring these metrics throughout the COVID-19 period so that any signals of potential problems can be detected early and more proactive strategies deployed.
