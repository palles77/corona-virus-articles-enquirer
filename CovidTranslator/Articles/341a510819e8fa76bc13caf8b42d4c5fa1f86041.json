In this retrospective series, we report outcomes of allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) in patients with hematologic disorders associated with SAMD9/SAMD9L mutations. Twelve patients underwent allogeneic HCT for MDS (n = 10), congenital amegakaryocytic thrombocytopenia (n = 1), and dyskeratosis congenita (n = 1). Exome sequencing revealed heterozygous mutations in SAMD9 (n = 6) or SAMD9L (n = 6) genes. Four SAMD9 patients had features of MIRAGE syndrome. Median age at HCT was 2.8 years (range, 1.2 to 12.8 years). Conditioning was myeloablative in 9 cases and reduced intensity in 3 cases. Syndrome-related comorbidities (diarrhea, infections, adrenal insufficiency, malnutrition, and electrolyte imbalance) were present in MIRAGE syndrome cases. One patient with a familial SAMD9L mutation, MDS, and morbid obesity failed to engraft and died of refractory acute myeloid leukemia. The other 11 patients achieved neutrophil engraftment. Acute post-transplant course was complicated by syndrome-related comorbidities in MIRAGE cases. A patient with SAMD9L-associated MDS died of diffuse alveolar hemorrhage. The other 10 patients had resolution of hematologic disorder and sustained peripheral blood donor chimerism. Ten of 12 patients were alive with a median follow-up of 3.1 years (range, 0.1 to 14.7 years). More data are needed to refine transplant approaches in SAMD9/ SAMD9L patients with significant comorbidities and to develop guidelines for their long-term follow-up.",

Recent studies in children reported a rate of SAMD9 and SAMD9L mutations in 18.6% and 17% cases with suspected inherited bone marrow failure syndromes and those with primary MDS, respectively [7, 8] . Biology of Blood and Marrow Transplantation journal homepage : www.bbmt.org SAMD9 and SAMD9L proteins are involved in endosomal trafficking and negatively regulate cell proliferation [9] . Gain-of-function heterozygous mutations in these genes lead to cellular growth restriction and hypoplasia, resulting in cytopenias, bone marrow failure, and immunodeficiency. Interestingly, in many cases, there is a nonrandom loss of the mutated allele via full or partial deletion of chromosome 7 [4, [10] [11] [12] . The resultant monosomy 7 or deletion 7q can result in the development of MDS and acute myeloid leukemia (AML) [8, 11, 12] . Conversely, other \"genetic correction\" events such as in cis missense, nonsense, or loss of heterozygosity through uniparental disomy can result in normal hematopoiesis.",

We believe this variant is pathogenic based on well-established functional data from two separate experimental studies showing that it has a deleterious effect on cells. The younger sibling of the patients above also carries the variant and had transient neonatal thrombocytopenia requiring transfusion. However, the mother of these patients carries the variant as well and presently lacks an apparent phenotype. Whether she was transiently affected in the past is unknown, but this is possible as somatic revertant mosaicism is a known associated phenomenon with SAMD9/SAMD9L variants. Other potential mechanisms that could account for the lack of phenotypic segregation include monoallelic gene expression, incomplete penetrance, or variable expressivity. We feel this is important to note for clinical reasons in case this variant is observed in another patient.

These patients continue to require ongoing management and multispecialty care for syndromerelated nonhematologic manifestations. More data are needed to define timing of HCT in SAMD9/ SAMD9L patients and further refine conditioning regimens as well as management of patients with significant syndromerelated comorbidities.
