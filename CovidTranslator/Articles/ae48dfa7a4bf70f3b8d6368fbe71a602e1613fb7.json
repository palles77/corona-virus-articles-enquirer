            "text": "The burgeoning field of viral immunology has been heavily influenced by the lifestyle set by infection of mice with lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV). Studies of this virus provided vital clues to the understanding of immunological tolerance (Burnet and Fenner, 1949) . T-cell recognition (Doherty and Zinkernagel, 1974) , the concept of high-dose paralysis (Hotchin, 1971) [now more popularly termed \"immune exhaustion,\" Moskophidis et al. (1993) ], and the notion that tissue injury may result from a n immune response to virus-infected cells (Buchmeier et al., 1980) or to immune complexes composed of viral protein and antibody (Oldstone and Dixon, 1969) . Virus-induced immunopathology likely operates to some degree in many, perhaps even all, animal virus infections. In fact, a degree of immunopathology may be the tariff the body must pay to eliminate infections by most agents, even those which are highly cytopathic. With many noncytolytic viruses it is only because of the immune response against them that any discernable disease occurs. The prime example is set by LCMV, but the mechanism(s) operative in this infection do not repre-sent the full gamut of cellular and molecular events involved in virusinduced immunopathologies. In this brief review, some principal examples of immunopathogenesis are discussed, accompanied by speculations about management. Indeed, the control of such viral infections requires the use of therapeutic vaccines and immune modulators that suppress the development of lesions, since prophylactic vaccines may not always succeed in preventing infection.",

Strains of LCMV differ in tissue tropism and virulence, but all are largely noncytolytic and the virus fails to cause overt tissue damage (Hotchin, 1971) . Such damage only occurs after the development of a n immune response that primarily involves T cells of the CD8' subset (Doherty et al., 1990; Kagi et al., 1995) . Early clues that lesions in LCM are immunopathological came from the observation that the disease only occurred in immunocompetent animals. Accordingly, tolerized as well as immunosuppressed mice failed to exhibit the characteristic choriomeningitis (Burnet and Fenner, 1949; Buchmeier et al., 1980) . Later evidence came from adoptive transfer experiments with T-cell subtypes, the use of monoclonal antibodies to selectively deplete various cell types in uiuo, and very recently the use of gene knockout and transgenic mice (Kagi et al., 1995; Baenziger et al., 1986; Leist et al., 1987) .",

            "text": "The evidence provides a clear-cut conclusion: tissue damage occurring in LCMV infection involves the essential participation of T cells of the CD8+ lineage. However, the exact mechanisms by which CD8' T cells cause the inflammatory tissue damage remains unresolved. For example, in cerebral infections with LCMV, a significant recruitment and extravasation of immunoinflammatory cells to the sites of viral replication occurs in the meninges, ependymal membranes, and choroid plexus of the brain (Buchmeier et al., 1980) . Only a minor proportion of cells in the inflammatory reactions are LCMV antigenspecific CD8' T cells, yet these are essential for the inflammation to proceed (Doherty et al., 1990) . One hypothesis contends that the tissue damage results from direct cytotoxicity by CD8' cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) to virus-infected cells (Kagi et al., 1995) . This idea is supported by the observation that knockout mice unable to generate perforin do not express disease (Kagi et al., 1995) . However, in brains with lesions no evidence of overt cellular pathology is present histologically (Walker et al., 1975) . Alternatively, although the primary step may involve recognition by specific CD8' T cells, the bulk of tissue damage may result from the release of several proinflammatory cytokines from the activated inflammatory cells recruited to the site by factors released from CD8' T cells (Campbell et al., 1994a) .",

Contrary to this hypothesis, however, is the recent evidence that lesions and disease susceptibility occur normally in IFNy knockout mice and that attempts to ablate nitric oxide production do not ameliorate LCM .

With the former two examples, excellent murine animal models are available, and these have helped considerably to depict a role of CD8' T cells in their pathogenesis. Particularly informative have been studies on hepatitis B virus infection using the artificial system of transgenic mice expressing various gene constructs of HBV (Chisari and Ferrari, 1995) . These investigations reveal that CD8' T cells are principally involved as mediators of viral clearance as well as immunopathology, and that a variety of cellular and molecular events are at play (Ando et al., 1993) .

However, they readily develop lesions which resemble human acute viral hepatitis if given adoptive transfers of CD8' MHC class I restricted HBV-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes (Chisari and Ferrari, 1995) . Sequential analysis of the basic system reveals that the lesions progress in a predictable stepwise fashion. The earliest detectable step involves direct attachment of CTL to HBV antigen-positive hepatocytes, with the latter being killed by apoptosis. The widely scattered apoptotic hepatocytes in the transgenic mouse livers are reminiscent of acute viral hepatitis lesions in humans (Ando et aE., 1994a) . Given the nature of apoptosis, death of such hepatocytes is unlikely to release agonists which drive the inflammatory response. However, after the initial apoptotic phase, antigen-nonspecific inflammatory cells such as neutrophils and monocytes are recruited, and these cause far more hepatic cell damage than do CTI, and the damage zone extends way beyond the sites of CTL-mediated apoptosis (Ando et al., 1993) . Such events are presumed to be mediated by cytokines, particularly IFNy, probably released by CTL, which can be directly cytotoxic to hepatocytes that express abundant levels of HBV surface antigen (Guidotti et al., 1995) .",

            "text": "In some transgenics in which hepatocytes retain high levels of HBV surface antigen, necrosis can be massive, and the mice die of hepatitis (Guidotti et al., 1995) . This step can be prevented by prior administration of neutralizing antibody to IFNy or by depletion of macrophages. Consequently, in the HBV transgene model the immunopathology is initiated and likely orchestrated mainly by CD8' T cells, but the principal immunopathological effects appear to be mediated nonspecifically by cytokines and recruited cells such as macrophages. This pattern of events is more commonly found in CD4' T-cell-mediated immunopathology (discussed subsequently). What is of particular interest in the HBV transgene model is that, when the transgene is expressed in tissues such as the kidney or brain, no disease ensues in these organs following the subsequent intravenous adoptive transfer of HBV-specific CTL (Ando et al., 199413) . To cause damage in such organs, which compared to the liver have blood vessels that impede the escape of ' I ' cells, requires that the CTL be placed directly into the organs. Such observations indicate that the induction of immunopathology to a virus infection requires not only that the agent be present but that it be available for recognition by CD8' T cells. In the HBV transgene model, as in LCM, the molecular mechanisms of disease expression await further elucidation. The murine CBV model of immunopathology has received less investigation than LCMV and HBV, and CBV is far more cytolytic than either LCMV or HBV and can alone cause tissue damage (virological pathology) (Woodruff, 1980) . The CBV type 3 strain causes myocardial disease, although the extent of this syndrome is subject to numerous variables of virus and host (Chow et al., 1991) . Recently, knockout mice were used to follow the pathogenesis of CBV-3-induced myocarditis, which occurs in mice that survive the acute disease (Hanke et al., 1995) . A clear role for CD8' T-cell function was observed. Accordingly, myocarditis was severe in CD4' knockout mice but only minimal in animals deficient for a CD8' T-cell response because of p2M knockout (Hanke et al., 1995) . Moreover, the severe disease in CD4' knockout mice was abrogated by in uiuo depletion of CD8' T cells with specific monoclonal antibodies. Such data clearly implicate a major role for CD8' T cells in the immunopathogenesis of CBV-3-induced myocarditis, but the molecular mechanism of tissue damage remains to be established. Some favor the notion that TNFa and IL-lp are involved, since if such cytokines are administered to infected mice the myocarditis is exacerbated (Lane et al., 1992) . Furthermore, TNFa is readily demonstrable in inflammatory cells at the site of cardiac lesions (Hanke et al., 1995) .",

Unfortunately, suitable murine models of HIV pathogenesis are lacking, and so it remains difficult to assess experimentally the viewpoint that HIV pathogenesis involves CD8' T cells (Pantaleo et al., 1993; Zinkernagel and Hengartner, 1994) . Initially, such cells are considered to play a protective role. However, this defense function is imperfect and virus usually persists in numerous cell types without causing their destruction. Conceivably, destruction of antigen-presenting cells as well as CD4' T cells which harbor virus by antigen-specific CD8' T cells may contribute to immunosuppression (Zinkernagel and Hengartner, 1994) . The idea that viruses cause immunosuppression by a CD8' T-cell-mediated immunopathological reaction against infected cells of the immune system is clearly evident in LCMV infection of mice (Mims and Wainwright, 1968; Jacobs and Cole, 1976, Odermatt et al., 1991) . Depending on numerous variables affecting both the virus and infected host, a marked immune suppression and resultant enhanced suscepti-bility to other agents are observed. Indeed, some have strongly advocated that the pathogenesis of immune suppression in HIV infection might best be understood by studying LCMV infection in mice (Zinkernagel and Hengartner, 1994) . In LCMV infection, suppression results from a n antiviral CD8' CTL response against infected antigenpresenting cells such as macrophages and perhaps dendritic cells (Jacobs and Cole, 1976) . For a more complete discussion on the immunopathogenesis of HIV infection, other reviews are recommended (Pantaleo et al., 1993; Zinkernagel and Hengartner, 1994) .",

In part, this reflects the fact that CD4' T cells express different profiles of cytokines and perhaps other signaling molecules such as chemokines (Mossman and Coffman, 1989) . Usually, CD4' T cells are divided into two functional subsets: Thl T cells producing principally IFNy, IL-2, and TNFP, and Th2 cells, which mainly produce IL-4, IL-5, and IL-10 (Mosmann and Coffman, 1989; Paul and Seder, 1994) . The former cell types largely marshal inflammatory responses dominated by mononuclear cells and neutrophils. Th2-mediated inflammatory responses have more eosinophils and basophils; these are uncommon responses to viral infections, although they are likely responsible for the alveolitis which occurs in respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection (Alwan et al., 1994) . The Thl-organized DTH reactions are considered common responses to viruses, and in some situations these are chronic and tissue-damaging. Such reactions occur in response both to cytolytic viruses such as measles (Johnson et al., 1978) and herpes simplex virus (HSV) (Doymaz and Rouse, 1992) and to viruses which are noncytodestructive. Against cytolytic viruses the DTH response may be considered primarily protective unless, as discussed subsequently, the infection causes the exposure of self-derived determinants which in turn perpetuate the response.",

            "text": "In the case of persistent viruses that are minimally cytopathic, the CD4'-mediated DTH reaction to them, with its accompanying tissue damage, must be considered as largely immunopathological. Examples of agents which largely follow this script in the mouse include Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis virus (TMEV) (Miller and Karpus, 1994) , mouse coronavirus (Fleming et al., 1993) , and Semliki Forest virus (SFV) (Mokharian and Swoveland, 1987). These persistent virus infections affect the central nervous system (CNS) of rodents and induce late inflammatory responses that involve the white matter, causing demyelination [reviewed in Fazakerley and Buchmeier (1993) l. Such viruses are of particular interest since the cause of a common demyelinating disease of humans, multiple sclerosis (MS), remains elusive, and involvement of viruses is suspected (Kurtzke, 1993) . Despite several candidates, however, no single agent is currently accepted as a cause of MS (Waksman, 1995) , but the idea that viruses can trigger MS as well as several other autoimmune diseases remains a viable hypothesis (Theofilopoulos, 1995) . The many viruses associated with immunemediated inflammatory diseases in the CNS of rodents include mouse coronavirus, S W , and the picornavirus TMEV. In each instance the outcome of infection is markedly affected by virus strain, host genotype, and the dose and route of infection. As these variables apply to TMEV the topic has been comprehensively reviewed by Brahic et al. (1991) , and for mouse coronavirus by Fazakerly and Buchmeier (1993) . In all three viruses, immune-mediated disease appears associated only with persistent noncytolytic infection, but the actual immune mechanisms at play are still in dispute. In the case of TMEV, maybe the best-understood of these infections, overwhelming evidence points to a crucial role for CD4' T cells of the T h l subtype (Miller and Karpus, 1994) . Such cells are assumed to organize inflammatory responses that consist largely of monocytic phagocytes which mediate bystander demyelination. Accordingly, monocytes were demonstrated to strip neurons of their myelin lamellae in uitro (Dal Canto and Lipton, 1975) , but exactly how this is accomplished biochemically is unclear. Candidate mechanisms likely include oxyradical production, nitric oxide, and TNFa released from IFNy-activated macrophages. Other cytokines such as IL-6 might also play a role, since overexpression of this cytokine as well a s some others in the brain causes neuropathologic consequences (Campbell et al., 1993) . Evidence also exists for direct destruction of oligodendroglial cells, the cellular source of myelin, by the cytokine TNFP generated by CD4' T cells of the T h l subtype (Miller and Karpus, 1994) . In the TMEV system, compelling evidence indicates that CD4' T cells of the T h l subtype act as the essential cell type that organizes the demyelination, at least in the susceptible SeJL mouse (Miller and Karpus, 1994) . Data indicate that disease severity correlates temporally with the development of MHC class I1 restricted DTH reactions and Thl-dependent IgG2a antibody production (Peterson et al., 1992) . In addition, disease development is suppressed by anti-CD4 or anti-Ia treatment (Gerety ct al., 1994) . More persuasive evidence for a vital role of CD4' T h l cells came from experiments which showed that mice exposed to a modified form of TMEV antigens, which resulted in selective Th 1 anergy (tolerance), had delayed and diminished disease . In addition, such mice had reduced T h l cytokine production but elevated levels of Th2 cytokines. The tolerized mice also had minimal DTH reactions, elevated Th2-dependent IgGl antibody responses and reduced numbers of CD4' T cells in the CNS. In TMEV, although virus may persist in oligodendroglial cells, most virus appears to be present in brain macrophages (Clatch et al., 1985) . Such cells express high levels of MHC class I1 in inflamed brains, and these cells likely act as the principal activators of the CD4' virus-specific T cells (Miller ct al., 1995) . Indeed, macrophages isolated from brains with TMEV demyelination readily stimulate CD4' TMEV antigen reactive lines in uitro (Miller, 1995) . Moreover, the disease is potentiated if CD4' class I1 restricted Thl-type TMEV-specific clones are adoptively transferred to infected mice (Gerety et al., 1994) . In conclusion, current results in the TMEV system clearly point to a n immunopathological disease involving principally CD4' T cells of the T h l phenotype. These cells, upon recognition of antigens, drive a bystander demyelinating lesion mediated by cytokine-activated mononuclear phagocytes.",

Several observations are consistent with the notion that the demyelination occurring in the white matter in both diseases results from T-cellmediated immune responses to persistent noncytolytic virus infection of glial cells [reviewed in Fazakerley and Buchmeier (1993) l. Although one suspects that the mechanisms at play in mouse coronavirus and SFV resemble those occurring in TMEV and primarily involve CD4' T h l T-cell-mediated reactions, this idea has yet to be proven. Whether or not any human demyelinating disease involves mechanisms akin to those discussed above for TMEV in the SJL mouse remains moot. Demyelination occurs occasionally as a sequel to measles infection and vaccination (Johnson et al., 1978) , and although an immune-mediated pathogenesis is suspected, viral antigens have not been demonstrated in the demyelinating lesions (Johnson et al., 1984) . However, measles virus might induce a n autoimmune demyelination by a \"hit and run\" mechanism such as is suggested to occur in HSVinduced stromal keratitis, described subsequently. Postinfection demyelination also occurs very occasionally after infections with vaccinia, varicella, rubella, mumps, influenza, and EBV (Fazakerley and Buchmeier, 1993) , but possible immune mechanisms at play have not been elucidated. There is considerable interest in the fact that HIV causes a n inflammatory disease of the CNS (Spencer and Price, 1992) . However, this occurs only in individuals who are markedly immunosuppressed and have very few circulating lymphocytes. The virus affects macrophages and these become MHC class 11' (Kure, 1990 ).",

            "text": "Of the viruses which commonly cause disease in humans, RSV infection provides the best example of a disease that likely has a CD4' T-cell-controlled immune-mediated pathogenesis (Graham et al., 1991) . The virus persists in the body for a short time only and is minimally cytopathic (Herman, 1990) . When disease occurs, it usually manifests as the virus is being eliminated and involves many symptoms which mimic allergic reactions. Indeed, reports of the presence of IgE and eosinophil breakdown products in nasal secretions were consistent with an allergic pathogenesis (Welliver et al., 19Sl) , but such reports seem not to have been confirmed. Recently, several groups have studied RSV in mouse models and have shown a clear role for T cells as mediators of immunopathology (Alwan et al., 1994; Graham et al., 1991; Connors et al., 1992) . Although RSV replicates poorly in most mouse strains, a role for T cells in disease expression is well-established. For instance, lesions are minimal in immunosuppressed mice (Graham et al., 1991) , but become severe in immunocompetent virus-infected mice given adoptive transfers of RSV antigen-specific activated T cells (Alwan et al., 1994) . The most effective disease-producing cell transfers are CD4' T cells that express a Th2 cytokine profile (Alwan et al., 1994) . Interestingly, in the RSV system the different viral proteins appear to induce T cells of different cytokine-producing phenotypes (Alwan et al., 1993) . In fact, whereas the G protein of RSV induces the immunopathologic CD4' T cells with a type 2 cytokine profile, other proteins such as the F protein induce both CD4' and CD8' T cells, but such cells mediate protection rather than pathology (Anderson and Heilman, 1995) . Moreover, these protective cells are largely IFNy-producing and are considered type 1 cells. Exactly how the CD4' Th2 cells mediate the pathological immune reactions in the mouse lung is not known, but the prominence of eosinophils in the lesions indicates that such cells may participate in the tissue damage (Anderson and Herman, 1995) .",

Using a mouse model which mimics this situation, Graham et al. (1993) have demonstrated that CD4' T cells of the type 2 cytokineproducing profile appear responsible for vaccine-augmented reactions. In addition, others showed that inhibition of type 2 cytokines with specific anticytokine antibodies eliminated the enhanced pulmonary pathology (Connors et al., 1992) . Taken together, the observations on murine RSV infections indicate a pathological role for type 2 cytokineproducing CD4' T cells. This makes RSV a n unusual, possibly unique, viral agent whose pathogenesis mimics a pattern of events found more commonly in parasitic infections (Sher and Coffman, 1992) . In the RSV system, it seems likely that shifting the immune response to a type 1 cytokine-producing cell dominance, as occurs by immunization with live virus (Anderson and Heilman, 1995) , or perhaps better still by immunization with minimal vaccines that solely induce T h l responses, would be a beneficial approach to prevent immunopathologic disease following infection. Accordingly, in RSV infection, which commonly infects and causes repeated disease in children, the aim is to exploit T h l memory maximally.",

The disease in mice is clearly immunopathological and primarily involves CD4' T cells of the T h l subset (Niemialtowski and Rouse, 1992; Henricks et al., 1992) . Thus, HSK in the mouse represents a DTH reaction in the corneal stroma. Evidence that CD4' T cells orchestrate the inflammation has come from experiments showing that virus-infected athymic and SCID mice, or mice selectively depleted of CD4' T cells, fail to express HSK (Newel1 et al., 1989; Mercadal et al., 1993) . Moreover, lymphocytes isolated from the inflamed corneas of mice with HSK are predominantly CD4' T cells, and these produce mainly type 1 cytokines except during disease re-mission, when type 2 cytokines become prominent (Niemialtowski and Rouse, 1992; Babu et al., 1995a) .

In their system the difference in HSK susceptibility between two congenic mouse strains is known to be controlled by a n allotypic variation in an immunoglobulin gene (Jayaraman et al., 1993) . Mice expressing the IgHh allele are resistant, whereas congenic animals expressing the lgHd allele are sensitive. By inducing tolerance to IgHbexpressing Ig in susceptible mice, HSK fails to develop. The absence of HSK was interpreted to mean that IgHb-derived peptides provide tolerance to the target autoantigens recognized in the disease (Avery et al., 1995) . This concept was additionally supported by data showing that CD4 Thl-type clones specific to the peptide could transfer HSK to athymic recipients, just as could virus-immune T cells. The observations on HSK pathogenesis collectively indicate that HSV infection may be an example of a viral agent that can cause immune inflammatory disease by triggering an autoreactive response.

However, there are at least two widely accepted examples in which humoral mechanisms account for the immunopathogenesis of viral lesions. These are immune compledcomplementdependent lesions and antibody-dependent enhancement of viral infection. The latter phenomenon probably accounts for the pathogenesis of dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) (Kurane and Ennis, 1994) and coronavirus-induced infectious peritonitis, a common viral disease in the domestic cat (Trautwein, 1992) . In DHF, which only occurs in persons with existing antibody at the time of infection, the syndrome is assumed to be a sequel to the facilitated infection of F, receptor-bearing cells such as macrophages which take up virus-antibody complexes. The infected cells respond by producing a n abundance of proinflammatory cytokines and stimulate CD4' and CD8' T cells to do the same (Kurane and Ennis, 1994) . The resultant \"cytokine storm\" and other chemical mediators released are assumed to trigger the plasma leakage and hemorrhage in DHF. One group contends that vascular damage results from the effects of a novel cytokine produced by stimulated CD4' T cells, termed \"cytotoxic factor\" (Mukerjee and Chaturvedi, 1995) .",

This might occur if agents replicate continuously in sites beyond effective access by protective T cells or if some protective component of the immune response is dysfunctional or exhausted because of overstimulation. Immune exhaustion due to overwhelming antigen exposure has been shown most convincingly to occur in transgenic systems, and involves CD8' T cells (Moskophidis et al., 1993) .

This could be the principal mechanism at play in keratitis caused by HSV, since the avascular cornea can be considered unavailable to surveillance by the immune system. A similar explanation might apply to a common sequel to TMEV-induced demyelination in SJL mice wherein animals often develop a late response to myelin components such a s PLP .",

            "text": "A more sophisticated derivation of the antigen release concept is the unveiling of cryptic determinants. This idea, made popular recently by the excellent reviews of Sercarz (Sercarz et al., 1993; Lehmann et al., 1993) , provides a more compelling explanation for virus-induced autoimmunity occurring in nonsequestered tissues. Examples might include Coxsackie virus-induced myocarditis (Huber and Lodge, 1984) , and may explain why animals previously infected in the brain with persistent agents such as SFV become far more susceptible to the subsequent induction of Experimental Allergic Encephalomyelitis (EAE) when exposed to myelin antigens (Mokharian and Swoveland, 1987) . The essence of the cryptic self-hypothesis is that viral infection leads to the expression and altered presentation of determinants that are molecularly sequestered from the immune system and therefore do not induce tolerance (Lanzavecchia, 1995) . The molecular unmasking and presentation could have a variety of causes. These include the possibility that viruses or induced cytokines, or even complexes between viruses and antibodies (Simitsek et al., 1995) , may modulate the expression or activity of proteases in APC which might result in the generation and presentation of previously cryptic peptides (Elson et al., 1995) . Another possibility is that the induction of abundant cytokines from infected or bystander cells might alter the surface expression of host proteins so that they become autoreactive. Some support for this idea comes from the observation of transgenic mouse models constructed to overexpress certain cytokines. Aberrant inflammatory reactions occur frequently (Campbell et al., 1993; Gieger et al., 1994) . In one example, IFNy overexpression in the mouse retina gave rise to retinitis, which interestingly became more intense following HSV infection of the eye (Gieger et al., 1994) . Such data are consistent with the notion that viruses may trigger autoimmunity in some instances by causing a cytokine storm. There is, however, no well-accepted example of this effect occurring under natural circumstances.",

This hypothesis has its enthusiasts, but currently a well-documented example of a natural autoimmune viral disease that results from infection by viruses that act as molecular mimics is lacking. The hypothesis states that viruses share determinants with self-tissues, and the effective immune response generated to the viral determinant spills over to the host and a n autoreactive response occurs. There are numerous examples of shared peptide sequences between viral and host proteins. For example, several peptides derived from viral sequences were shown to stimulate T-cell clones derived from MS patients (Wucherpfennig and Strominger, 1995) . These data were interpreted to support the notion that viruses are involved in the etiology of MS via a molecular mimicry mechanism. However, as discussed before, no single known virus is currently accepted as a n initiating factor in MS (Waksman, 1995) . For a n enthusiastic viewpoint about molecular mimicry as it relates to virus-induced autoimmunity, the article of Wucherpfennig and Strominger (1995) is recommended. It is also worth noting that the molecular mimicry hypothesis has been advocated to explain aspects of the pathogenesis of HIV infection (Silvestris et al., 1995) .",

Preventing viral infection or manipulating immune processes during the initial phases of infection is far more successful than attempting to counteract pathological events once underway. With virus-induced immunopathologies, we are usually faced with a chronic tissue-damaging response to antigens that are being constantly replenished from a persistent replicat-ing agent. The therapeutic challenge is either to remove or to neutralize the agonists which drive the inflammation or to redirect the symphony of events occurring so that tissue damage is minimized or ablated. Few viruses are subject to inhibition by drugs and some of them have strategies that hide them from the chemical attack. Herpes simplex virus provides the best example of this scenario: the virus is susceptible to several antiviral drugs during the replication phase but to none during latency.",

The experimental induction of immunological tolerance to offending ant,igens is clearly the most desirable way to control any immune-mediated pathogenesis, but even when the culpable antigens are known, success is hard to achieve and maintain. Moreover, conceptually there are several forms of tolerance (Matzinger, 1994) . These include (i) deletion of T cells specific for a particular MHC-peptide combination, (ii) induction of T cells that survive in a form that is hyporesponsive to antigen (anergy), and (iii) T-cell survival in a form that responds strongly to a particular stimulus but in way which differs from the standard response.

Immune deviation is now better understood at a mechanistic level. It has its basis in the fact that subsets of T cells, both CD4' and CDF, exist which have different functional activities and that many of the cytokines they produce crossregulate each subset (Paul and Seder, 1994; Coffman et al., 1991; Croft et al., 1994) . Administration of antigen by various nonsystemic routes, e.g., may induce responses dominated by type 2 cytokine-producing cells which serve to down-regulate the induction of the type 1 cytokine producers that normally appear after systemic exposure (Ridgway et al., 1994; Powrie and Coffman, 1993) . Other means of achieving immune deviation include the use of analogue peptides for induction (Sette et al., 1994) or the use of reagents which influence the microenvironment of antigen-activated T cells (Bluestone, 1995; Linsley, 1995) . Regarding the latter, it is now evident that the cytokine or costimulator microenvironment in tissues during T-cell activation can profoundly influence the outcome in terms of the functional set of T cells that differentiates (Linsley, 1995) . For example, in a n environment dominated by IL-4, the CD4' subset induced from uncommitted precursors is usually of the Th2 phenotype (Paul and Seder, 1994) . Such a n effect operating during induction of the immune response to TMEV would diminish the induction of lesion-inducing CD4' T h l T cells. This result has, in fact, been reported . Thus, exposure of mice to viral antigen coupled to syngeneic spleen cells with ethylcarbodiimide (ECDI) abrogates the normal T h l T-cell response and shifts the response to one dominated by Th2 T cells . This procedure not only prevents the demyelinating disease after subsequent TMEV infection but can suppress lesion severity in infected animals, at least if given not later than 2-3 weeks after infection.",

Thl-enhancing procedures include administering or promoting the production of the cytokine IL-12 (Manetti et al., 1993) as well as manipulating the costimulator environment with agents which block CD28 stimulation, such as CTLA-Ig (Linsley, 1995) . Recently, a surprising observation was reported which achieves a result similar to IL-12 potentiation. Administering the Schiff-base-forming molecule tucaresol along with antigen led to the accentuation of a CD4' T h l response (Rhodes et al., 1995) . The mechanism of action is unknown but probably involves the bypass of a costimulator pathway which normally activates Th2-like responses (Shearer, 1995) . There is some evidence that the costimulator B7-2 on APC is responsible for Th2 activation (Manetti et al., 1993) and that tucaresol may inhibit the B7-2 stimulus in some way (Shearer, 1995) .",

Reversing a given pattern of events by immunomodulators once fulminant lesions are present is a challenging problem. Possibly coming closest to this objective is the success being achieved using the oral tolerance approach to suppress certain experimental autoimmune diseases and perhaps even the human diseases multiple sclerosis and rheumatoid arthritis (Chen et al., 1995) . Thus, by feeding antigen, clinical disease expression is minimized. This effect works best using a low-dose antigen regimen which seemingly induces a bystander suppressor-type effect mediated by TGFP and perhaps other cytokines (Friedman and Weiner, 1994) . At higher oral tolerizing doses, the mechanism of tolerance induction appears to be T-cell deletion or anergy (Friedman and Weiner, 1994) . This situation is probably less desirable than a bystander suppressor effect, since in natural diseases the specific antigens involved are rarely if ever known with certainty. It remains to be seen if oral tolerance or any immune deviation scheme will successfully control an established virus-induced immunopathological lesion.",

These include interfering with the effector function of lymphocytes and nonspecific inflammatory cells. Strategies include the use of cytokine receptor antagonists, particularly against the proinflammatory cytokines IL-1 and TNFa (Klein and Brailly, 1995) . The approach has shown promise in certain model systems, but from a practical viewpoint it is not convenient since a continual administration of the antagonist is required. However, a successful formulation might come from combining proinflammatory cytokine arrest with the simultaneous use of agonists which achieve lymphocyte reeducation. As regards the latter, it is pertinent to note the intriguing observations of the Chisari laboratory showing that immunization of HBV transgenic mice with a DNA vaccine may curtail transgene expression (Chisari, 1995) . In other viral immunopathologies, disease remission may be associated with the expression of the cytokine IL-10 (Babu et al., 1995b; Tumpey et al., 1994) . It seems likely that the use of DNA vaccines, particularly those encoding regulatory cytokines, may prove useful to manipulate the immune inflammatory state. One report already attests to this possibility (Rogy et aZ., 1995) .",

The newest candidate may turn out to be SNV infection in humans. Lesions orchestrated primarily by CD4' T cells can be either acute or long-lasting. Curiously, in the LCMV example, if CD8' T cells are removed from the scene, immunopathological responses may still occur and these involve CD4' T cells (Doherty et al., 1993; Fung-Leung et al., 1991) . Such responses are far more chronic and of lower grade than those mediated by CD8' T lymphocytes. One possible sequel to chronic inflammatory responses to viruses is that autoreactive inflammatory reactions are initiated and a n autoimmune disease occurs. Many mechanisms by which viruses trigger autoimmunity have been conceived but all lack concrete examples, a t least with respect to human autoimmune disease.",
