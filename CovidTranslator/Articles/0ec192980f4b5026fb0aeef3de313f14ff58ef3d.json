The polyclonal antibody labelled 2 major bands in both immune and normal roach sera corresponding to molecular masses of approximately 90 and 65 kDa. One of these bands (65 kDa) was considered to be the heavy chain of fish immunoglobulin whilst the identity of the other remains uncertain. This cross-reaction has been exploited in immunofluorescence and immunogold labelling studies to localize fish host molecules on the tegumental membrane of Ligula intestinails freshly removed from roach fry. Immunogold studies revealed a low level of host molecules to be associated mainly with the microthrix spines of the tegument with less gold labelling being observed on the microthrix shafts.",

In contrast, Sweeting (1977) , using the same technique, failed to demonstrate a worm-reactive precipitin in the serum of naturally ligulosed roach. However, in this latter study electrophoretic analysis did reveal an increase in the ~/-globulin fraction of ligulosed roach serum relative to that of serum from non-ligulosed fish, a result possibly indicative of an antibody response. Williams & Hoole (1992) speculated that the apparent absence of antibody noted by Sweeting (1977) may have been due to the duration of infection and/or environmental temperature. Although our previous studies, using sera from naturally ligulosed roach, corroborated the work of Sweeting (1977) we also showed that when fish received an intraperitoneal injection of crude worm homogenates and were maintained at a temperature of 20\u00b0C a precipitin band could be obtained using the double diffusion technique.",

The role of serum components in the fish host response to ligulosis has been investigated by Hoole & Arme (1986) using an in vitro cell adherence assay in which worms were exposed to fish leucocytes in the presence of various serum components. Both antibody and a complement protein, probably C3, were implicated as ligands in the mediation of cell attachment. In addition, the results of similar assays carried out by Hoole & Arme (1988) , in which sera was treated with phosphorylcholine (PC), suggested that the acute-phase protein, C-reactive protein (CRP), possibly in association with complement, may also be involved in leucocyte adherence to the metacestode.",

Ligulosed roach fry, mean weight 0.65 +-0.01 g, were obtained from Tittesworth Reservoir, Staffordshire, U.K. Fish were maintained in dechlorinated, aerated tapwater at 12 _+ I\u00b0C and fed on commercial fish meal. Worms were removed under teleost Ringer (Lockwood, 1963) using parafilm-covered forceps and washed 3 x in fresh Ringer solution to remove any adherent host cells. The worms were then cut into approximately 3 mm pieces and each section prefixed in 2% paraformaldehyde solution in PBS (pH 7.4) for 4-6 h. After prefixing, worms were washed first in teleost Ringer and then PBS-I%BSA. After blocking in 3% BSA in PBS for 2 h, the tissue was again washed in PBS-I%BSA, and immersed for 2 h in primary antibody (a-clgM) in PBS at dilutions of 1:20, 1:50 and 1:100. Worm material was then washed and blocked as above and then incubated for 2 h in the secondary antibody, FITC conjugated c~-rlgG, at a dilution of either 1:10, 1:20, 1:40 or 1:80 in PBS. After washing, specimens were viewed using a Reichert Zetopan microscope with a twin lamp Binolux II source, set up for epifluorescence. Photographs were taken using Kodak EKTAR 1000/31 \u00b0 film. In addition to the above, four controls were prepared: (a) to check for autofluorescence, worms were incubated in PBS-3%BSA, in the absence of antibodies; (b) to check for non-specific binding of the secondary antibody (FITC a-rlgG) the a-clgM stage was omitted, (c) to check for non-specific binding of components other than antibody in the immune rabbit serum, normal rabbit serum was included at a dilution of 1:50, before applying the secondary antibody; (d) IRS was included before the application of the secondary antibody. This addition would check for and eliminate unbound a-IgM in the assay.",

IgA was shown to be located linearly at the worm vela whereas the C3 complement component displayed a granular fluorescence.

Utilizing an in vitro immunofluorescence technique they demonstrated the presence of specific antibodies on the tegument of two species of Diphyllobothrium from trout when the worms were incubated in pooled immune serum. However, in situ experiments using cryostat sections through intact cysts did not reveal the presence of fish antibodies associated with the worm tegumental surface. Of particular interest were the high levels of fish antibody demonstrated on the inner margins of cysts. Since this site was shown to be composed of detached microtriches in fibrous tissue it was suggested that the passive absorption of antibody in this area may aid in parasite survival. In the roach-Ligula model a layer of host cellular remnants and parasite microthrix fragments has been observed adjacent to worms obtained from roach fry (Hoole & Arme, 1983a) . If a similar mechanism of host antibody absorption, as that suggested for Diphyllobthrium spp. (see Sharp et al., 1989) occurs in the roach-Ligula model, this may account for the paucity of host molecules demonstrated on the tegumental surface of L. intestinalis.",

Indeed, in the gudgeon, Gobio gobio, not only does Ligula survive the duration of the life of its host but, by a mechanism not yet understood, the worm also avoids eliciting a host cellular immune response (Taylor & Hoole, 1989) . In roach, in vivo tegumental damage to Ligula is restricted to phagocytosis of the microtriches by macrophages (Hoole & Arme, 1982) with extensive damage to the parasite being limited possibly due to the physical inability of the fish leucocytes to penetrate the dense microthrix border. Alternatively, serum components, such as antibody or complement, which are capable of opsonization of the worm tegument, may bind to antigens which are themselves restricted in their distribution on the tegumental surface, as would be suggested from the results described in the present paper.",

In addition, the paucity of immune labelling may be the result of a sequestration zone around the parasite, a hypothesis that requires further investigation. The distribution of host molecules that could possibly act as ligands is consistant with the findings of Hoole & Arme (1982; 1983a,b) who infrequently observed leucocyte penetration of the microthrix border. They suggested that the lack of cellular penetration was a physical phenomenon. Based on our observations it is proposed that the distal localization of the cellular response may be a result, at least in part, of the restricted distribution of host ligands and their corresponding parasite immunogens.",
