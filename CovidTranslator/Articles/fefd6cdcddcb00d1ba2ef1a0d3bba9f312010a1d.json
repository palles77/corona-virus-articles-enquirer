The health of the population has been one of the issues most relevant to sustainable development of the economy and society. However, limited availability of health services is unable to meet the enormous health needs. The estimated annual incidence of cancers 1.3%, cardiovascular diseases 50%, infection diseases 2.7% in 2003, whereas only 1.50 clinicians, 1.03 nurses and 2.40 ward beds per thousand are available to provide services in 2004 [1] . With the rapid shift of infectious diseases to chronic diseases in the Chinese population, the health spending is increased dramatically. The national health expenditure in 2003 has been tripled to 658.41 billion Renminbi (RMB) compared to that in 1995 [1] , whereas an increase of national health budget from 38.734 billion in 1995 to 111.694 billion in 2003 [2] cannot cope with the steep climbing of health expenditure. It is a big challenge to utilize the limited health-care capacity to keep all the population healthy.",
