There is a clear association between the frequency of Balkan nephropathy and that of tumours of the renal pelvis, ureters, and bladder. It seems to be confined to localities in Yugoslavia, Romania, and Bulgaria, close to the Danube and its tributaries. Within the rural areas of this region there may be more than 20 000 cases of the disease.",

A tentative claim has been made for arborviruses and, more recently, a coronavirus.8 An attempt by Dimitrov' to incriminate fungi in 1960 gave inconclusive results, but the possible role of mycotoxins in the aetiology of Balkan nephropathy was reappraised by Barnes10 and Akhmeteli.5 Investigation into a possible mycotoxic cause was begun in May, 1971 , and preliminary observations have been published. 6 11 The main finding has been the highly significant correlation between mortality from the disease and the occurrence of excessive rainfall during the harvest periods (August-October) of the previous two years. This is taken to indicate that in such years the environmental conditions at harvest and in the early period of storage of the crops-notably, of grain= would favour the growth of saprophytic fungi such as penicillia, aspergilli, and fusaria, and hence the formation of mycotoxins. Examination of the fungal flora of foodstuffs from the endemic areas revealed a \"normal\" range of species for similar crops grown elsewhere in temperate regions and analytical tests failed to show the presence of aflatoxin, citrinin, or ochratoxin, although zearalenone was found in maize samples. Subsequent studies have shown that, in one endemic village in the Slavonski Brod area of Yugoslavia, some 8-20% of the foodstuffs have ochratoxin A present (Krogh, P., Hald, B., Plestina, R., Ceovic, S. unpublished-a fungal toxin which is known to produce renal changes in pigs and poultry in Scandinavia.12 13 We present here a combined mycological and pathological study which indicates that one strain of Penicillium verrucosum var. cyclopium, isolated from maize grown in the endemic area, induces in rats renal tubular lesions which closely resemble the changes found in patients with Balkan nephropathy. (November, 1972) , and the Oravita and Turnu Severin districts of Romania (June, 1973) . Food samples and other materials were obtained from houses and farms and placed in plastic or paper bags or in sterile universal bottles. When appropriate, air-drying was carried out as quickly as possible, or the samples were kept at 5C. Macroscopical and direct microscopical examinations were carried out under stereo and high-power microscopy to determine the amount and type of fungal growth. Isolations were made from both surface-sterilised and unsterilised materials by plating out on Czapek-Dox agar (containing 0.05 mg chlortetracycline/ml) for fungi, and on halfstrength nutrient agar for actinomycetes. Incubation was at 26 &deg;C for up to three weeks. Stock cultures were kept on Czapek-Dox agar under sterile mineral oil. Details of the isolates tested and their origin are given in table i.",

The 8 isolates finally tested for animal toxicity came from the 73 obtained in pure culture and were selected with a view to covering as wide a range of both suspected foodstuffs and predominant fungi as possible with such a restricted number. Penicillium verrucosum var. cyclopium (a well-known toxin producer) was isolated 34 times and was the commonest species found. P. expansum, which produces patulin, was isolated twice. Various pycnidial fungi related to the Phoma sp. isolated produce the mycotoxin responsible for lupinosis in sheep and cattle, and many Fusarium spp. (20 isolates) produce toxic trichothescenes and zearalenone. Oral administration of culture homogenates from 7 of the 8 fungal isolates listed in table i produced no abnormal effects in the rats during life and no macroscopic or microscopic changes in any of the organs subsequently examined. The cultures giving negative results comprised 5 of the penicillia and 1 each of the Phoma sp, and Fusarium oxysporum.

            "text": "In a series of patients with chronic renal failure managed conservatively, the rise in the plasma-myo-inositol (myoinositol) concentration has been found to be related to depression of sural-nerve conduction velocity. There was no correlation with motor-nerve conduction velocity in the peroneal nerve, or with either of these variables in a series of patients receiving chronic h&aelig;modialysis. Despite the negative correlation with sural-nerve conduction velocity, there was no correlation between the plasma-myoinositol concentration and the presence of peripheral neuropathy as assessed clinically. It is concluded that hypermyoinosit-ol&aelig;mia may depress nerve conduction velocity, but there is no evidence that it is responsible for the development of ur&aelig;mic polyneuropathy. Introduction URAEMIC polyneuropathy is an important consequence of chronic renal failure, being present in about 50% of patients treated conservatively and in 20% of a recently analysed group of cases treated by periodic haemodialysis.2 The cause remains unknown, but the improvement that can be produced by adequate h2emodialySiS,2 3 or more effectively by renal transplantation,4 suggests the action of a retained metabolite or, in view of the variability of the clinical features of the neuropathy, possibly more than one metabolite.5 The occurrence of polyneuropathy is not correlated with the plasma urea or creatinine levels. Various substances including methyl-guanidine6 have been advanced as possible candidates, but none has been convincingly implicated. Claims have been made that substances in the \"middle molecular weight\" range may be involved.7 8 Clements et al. have proposed that hypermyoinositolaemia may be responsible. Plasma-myo-inositol (myoinositol) levels are known to be raised in chronic renal failure. These workers'&deg; found that experimental hypermyoinositolaemia in rats produces a reduction in nerve conduction velocity similar to that observed in human uraernic polyneuropathy.In this study, we have measured the plasmamyoinositol concentration in patients with chronic renal failure and have related this to the results of nerve-conduction studies and to the occurrence of clinically evident neuropathy.Patients and Methods 17 patients with severe chronic renal failure not receiving treatment with periodic peritoneal dialysis or haemodialysis were investigated. Observations were also made on SO cases receiving regular haemodialysis. Both groups were questioned about symptoms of neuropathy and examined neurologically. Cases with other possible causes of neuropathy were excluded.Motor nerve conduction velocity was measured in the peroneal nerve with surface recordings over the extensor digitorum brevis muscle and stimulation of the nerve at the knee and ankle. Sural-nerve conduction was examined antidromically by stimulating the nerve percutaneously at midcalf level and recording from needle electrodes inserted alongside the nerve at the ankle. In both instances, 200 &micro;s stimuli were delivered from a Devices isolated stimulator. The recordings were suitably amplified and displayed on a Telequipment storage oscilloscope. For the recording of the sural nerve action potentials, 150 responses were averaged on a Medelec AVM6 averager. Skin temperature over the lower leg at the time of recording was 32-34&deg;C.In the non-dialysed patients, blood samples were taken in the fasting state for the estimation of myoinositol. In the cases receiving treatment by haemodialysis, a random blood sample was obtained at the time nerve conduction was examined.Myoinositol was assayed by gas-liquid chromatography by a method based on that of Lewin et al.\" To 2.5 ml of plasma was added 250 & m i c r o ; l of 0.02% methyl-K-D-mannopyranoside as internal standard followed by 250 & m i c r o ; l of 60% w/v trichloroacetic acid to remove the proteins. The supernatant was adjusted to pH7 with approximately 0.5 g (Dowex 1-X8) resin in the hydroxide form. Aliquots (1.0 ml) were evaporated to dryness at 60&deg; and stored in a desiccator pending silylation with 0.5 ml of anhydrous pyridine/hexamethyldisilizane/trimethylchlorosilane, 5/2/1 (by volume). The samples were shaken for four hours and stored at 4&deg; overnight before gasliquid chromatography with a 150 cm long, 3 mm inside diameter column of 2% OV1 on (Gas Chrom W) and a Pye-Unicam gas chromatograph with temperature programming.",
