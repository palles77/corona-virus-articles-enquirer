However, this name is prone to confusion 7 with SARS-CoV, which emerged in 2003, and a suggestion for a distinct name was 8 proposed, human coronavirus 2019 (HCoV-19) [2] . This novel virus is potentially 9 more transmissible than SARS-CoV and other coronavirus [3], making early 10 diagnosis of it important for clinical treatment and disease control. However, the 11 current nucleic acid testing approach for HCoV-19 [4] carries a negligible 12 false-negative risk [5] . Serological assays are supposedly a powerful approach for 13 achieving timely diagnosis of COVID-19, as is nucleic acid testing, especially for 14 patients with undetectable viral RNA [6] . The serological assays used for early 15 diagnosis are mainly based on detecting specific antibodies against HCoV-19 in a 16 patient's serum and include the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), the 17 colloidal gold immunochromatography assay (GICA) and the chemiluminescence 18 assay. 19",

Among them, the N-protein is the most abundant, 2 relatively conservative protein in coronaviruses; thus, it is often used as a diagnostic 3 antigen [7] . Our previous study showed that the antigenicity of the COOH terminus is 4 higher than that of the NH 2 terminus in the SARS-CoV N protein, and that the former 5 N protein fragment may have the same antigenicity as that seen with the full-length N 6 protein [8] .
