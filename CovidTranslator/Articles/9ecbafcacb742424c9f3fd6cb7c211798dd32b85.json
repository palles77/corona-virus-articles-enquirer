For the sake of brevity, however, the discussion in this article is restricted to mammals as these are the best investigated organisms in that respect.

Complement activation is achieved by specific receptors recognizing pathogens or immunocomplexes. Three different pathways are being distinguished which are termed the classical pathway (triggered by antigen-antibody complexes), the mannanbinding lectin pathway (triggered by lectin binding of pathogen surfaces), and the alternative pathway (triggered by complement factor C3b-coated pathogen surfaces). They all activate a cascade of reactions involving more than 20 soluble and cell-bound proteins, thus resulting in a rapid and massive response. The complement system is able to (1) tag infected cells and pathogens for destruction by phagocytic cells (opsonization), (2) prime humoral immune responses, and (3) perforate membranes of infected cells by the membrane-attack complex. In response, viruses have evolved effective countermeasures such as incorporation of cellular complement-regulatory proteins into particles or expressing specific inhibitors in infected cells.",

Activated macrophages also synthesize inflammatory cytokines such as interferon (IFN)-g and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-a, thus triggering an adaptive immune response. Granulocytes are also able to remove viral particles and apoptotic bodies by phagocytosis. They are rapidly attracted to inflammatory sites and enter the tissue by transendothelial migration.

The differentiation into efficient antigen-presenting cells (APCs) is achieved by cytokine production which, in turn, is triggered by stimulation of receptors recognizing pathogen-specific molecular patterns (PAMPs). Two main types of DCs are being distinguished: myeloid DCs (mDCs) and plasmacytoid DCs (pDCs). mDCs are an early split-off of the myeloid bone marrow precursors, that is, the stem cells which are also giving birth to macrophages/monocytes and granulocytes, among others. Depending on the location, several subsets of mDCs such as Langerhans cells or interstitial cells are being distinguished. pDCs, which are not segregated into subpopulations, are thought to be derived from lymphatic precursor cells. Both mDCs and pDCs can sense viral infection by several intra-and extracellular PAMP receptors (see below). Depending on the DC type, high levels of interleukins or interferons are being produced which coin the subsequent immune reaction. pDCs are potent producers of the main antiviral cytokines, the type I interferons.",

RNA binding to the helicase domain (not shown). The cooperative action of these factors is required for full activation of the IFN-b promoter. IRF-3 is phosphorylated by the kinases TBK-1 and IKKe which in turn are activated by RIG-I and MDA5 via IPS-1. NF-kB is activated by the PKR pathway as well as by IPS-1. The IFN-induced IRF-7 later enhances IFN gene transcription, but is also essential for immediate early IFN-b transcription. (b) PAMP recognition by endosomal PRRs. IRF-7 is activated by IRAK-1, which in turn is phosphorylated by IRAK-4 in an MyD88-dependent manner. Both TLR7/8 and TLR9 use the MyD88 adaptor, whereas TLR3 activates IRF-3 via TRIF and TBK1. induces a conformational change which liberates the CARD domain to interact with the signaling partner IPS-1 (also called Cardif, MAVS, or VISA). This adaptor mediates RIG-I and MDA-5 signaling and needs to be located at the mitochondrial membrane. IPS-1 has a CARD-like domain which binds to RIG-I and MDA5 and a C-terminal region which activates the kinases IKKe and TBK-1. These kinases are known to phosphorylate the transcription factor IFN regulatory factor (IRF)-3, a member of the IRF family. Phosphorylated IRF-3 homodimerizes and is transported into the nucleus. In addition, the transcription factor nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kB) is recruited in a PKR/TRAFand IPS-1-dependent way. Together, IRF-3 and NF-kB strongly upregulate IFN gene expression. This leads to a 'first wave' of IFN production (IFN-b and IFN-a4 in mice) which triggers the expression of the transcription factor IRF-7. Recent evidence has shown that IRF-7 is a master regulator of IFN gene expression and that IRF-3 seems to cooperate with IRF-7 for full activity. IRF-7 can be activated in the same way as IRF-3 and is responsible for a positive-feedback loop that initiates the synthesis of several IFN-a subtypes as the 'second-wave' IFNs. mDCs can sense dsRNA by the classic intracellular pathway and, in addition, by TLR3 (Figure 2(b) ). dsRNA-induced triggering of endosomal TLR3 proceeds via TRIF and TRAF3 which activate the kinase TBK-1, leading to phosphorylation of IRF-3 and, subsequently, to the activation of IFN-b gene expression.",

            "text": "Type I IFNs activate the expression of several hundred IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) with multiple functions. To date, five antiviral pathways have been studied in great detail, namely the protein kinase R (PKR), the RNA-specific adenosine deaminase 1 (ADAR 1), the 2-5 OAS/RNaseL system, the product of the ISG56 gene (p56), and the Mx proteins. PKR, ADAR1, and 2-5 OAS are constitutively expressed in normal cells in a latent, inactive form. Basal mRNA levels are upregulated by IFN-a/b and these enzymes need to be activated by viral dsRNA. PKR is a serine-threonine kinase that phosphorylates -among other substrates -the a-subunit of the eukaryotic translation initiation factor eIF2. As a consequence, translation of cellular and viral mRNAs is blocked. PKR also plays a role in virus-induced NF-kB activation, as described above. ADAR 1 catalyzes the deamination of adenosine on target dsRNAs to yield inosine. As a result the secondary structure is destabilized due to a change from an AU base pair to the less stable IU base pair and mutations accumulate within the viral genome. The 2-5 OAS catalyzes the synthesis of short 2 0 -5 0 oligoadenylates that activate the latent endoribonuclease RNaseL. RNaseL degrades both viral and cellular RNAs, leading to viral inhibition. P56 binds the eukaryotic initiation factor 3e (eIF3e) subunit of the eukaryotic translation initiation factor eIF3. It functions as an inhibitor of translation initiation at the level of eIF3 ternary complex formation and is likely to suppress viral RNA translation. Mx proteins belong to the superfamily of dynamin-like large GTPases and have been discovered as mediators of genetic resistance against orthomyxoviruses in mice. They most probably act by enwrapping viral nucleocapsids, thus preventing the viral polymerase from elongation of transcription. The antiviral profiles of the IFN effectors listed above are distinct but often overlapping. Mx proteins, for example, mainly inhibit segmented negative-strand RNA viruses and also Semliki Forest virus, whereas the 2-5 OAS/RNaseL system appears more important against positive-strand RNA viruses. Moreover, only rarely the presence of one particular IFN effector determines host resistance. Rather, it is the sum of antiviral factors affecting, for example, genome stability, genetic integrity, transcription, and translation that confers the full antiviral power of IFN.",

Treatment with IFNs is an established therapy against several viral and malignant diseases such as hepatitis B, hepatitis C, Kaposi's sarcoma, papillomas, multiple sclerosis, and several leukemias and myelomas. However, the strong and systemic effects of IFNs do not come without a price. Administration of IFN can locally produce inflammation, and systemically cause fever, fatigue, malaise, myalgia, and anemia. It is no coincidence that these latter are 'flu-like' symptoms, since in many acute infections IFNs play a dominant role. The effects of IFN which are desired and beneficial if restricted to the site of first infection can turn into a life-threatening 'cytokine storm' if it becomes systemic. Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and human infections with H5N1 influenza viruses are examples of such outof-control innate immune responses. Another 'dark side' aspect is that patients with autoimmune diseases have chronically elevated levels of IFNs, and that IFN therapy can aggravate autoimmune disorders. It is thought that pDCs (and in part B cells) are autostimulated by self-DNA via TLR9 and by small nuclear RNA complexes (snRNPs) via TLR7.

            "text": "In 1960, T. Loeb reported finding phages that formed plaques on Escherichia coli carrying the F transfer factor but not on those without it. His finding was confirmed by workers around the world, and publications in 1963 by H. Hoffmann-Berling and D. A. Marvin, by Loeb and N. Zinder and co-workers, and by H. P. Hofschneider established that such plaque formers, independently isolated, were small spherical RNA phages (fr, f2, and M12), and small filamentous DNA phages (fd, f1, and M13), the latter now collectively referred to as Ff phage (Figu re 1 ). The capital F is for the F f actor spec ifying the host, and the small f stands for filamentous. These new DNA viruses had intriguing characteristics. Surprisingly, they did not lyse their hosts in culture yet formed the plaques on bacterial lawns, their filamentous virions contained DNA genomes that were both single stranded and circular, and it was observed, by E. Trenkner, that capsid protein of the infecting phage is incorporated into progeny virions. The fd, f1, and M13 genomes were among the first viral genomes sequenced. They each have either 6407 or 6408 nucleotides encoding the same 11 genes but fewer than 100 nucleotide differences even though the isolates were from different places in the world. This near constancy seemed remarkable, and has become more so in view of the plasticity of the Ff genome made evident in a plethora of subsequent mutagenesis studies.Now over 50 different species of filamentous DNA phages are known, and their bacterial hosts occupy many habitats. Taxonomically the phages comprise the genus Inovirus in the family Inoviridae, the terms coming from the Greek word for filament. Infections by many",
