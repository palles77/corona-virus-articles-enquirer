Tang and Johnston described the delivery of DNA into the skin of mice using a 'gene gun', in an attempt to deliver human growth hormone as a gene therapy 1 . The authors felt that this could be a useful technique to generate antibody responses against specific transgene products. At the same time, three presentations at the annual vaccine meeting at the Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory in 1992 reported the use of DNA vectors to drive both humoral and cellular immune responses against pathogens or tumour antigens in vivo. Margaret Liu and her colleagues at the pharmaceutical company Merck reported injecting 'naked' plasmids intramuscularly to deliver immunogens that would generate immune responses against influenza virus antigens in mice 2 . Similarly, Robinson described the ability of DNA plasmids to drive immune responses against influenza virus antigens 3 . A presentation by Weiner described the ability of plasmids carrying HIV antigens or tumour antigens to produce immune responses and protection from tumour challenge in mice 4 . Although none of these studies used the same delivery method, formulation or plasmid, together they provided evidence to the scientific community that this simple technique could be developed as an immunization platform.",

In particular, DNA vaccines induce killer cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs), suggesting that an important shift had occurred in non-live vaccine platforms. The use of the DNA approach also promised to overcome the safety concerns associated with live vaccines -their reversion risks, as was observed in a subset of primates receiving a live but attenuated simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) vaccine, and their potential spread to unintended individuals 5 . In addition, it avoids the risks linked to the manufacture of killed vaccine, as exemplified by the tainting of a polio vaccine with live polio virus owing to a production error 6 .",

These methods, particularly when combined, cause augmented levels of immune responses in rodents as well as large animal models.

The optimized gene sequence of interest is delivered to the skin (intradermally), subcutaneum or muscle by one of several delivery methods. using the host cellular machinery, the plasmid enters the nucleus of transfected local cells (such as myocytes or keratinocytes), including resident antigen presenting cells (APCs). Here, expression of plasmid-encoded genes is followed by generation of foreign antigens as proteins that have been converted to peptide strings. These host-synthesized antigens can become the subject of immune surveillance in the context of both major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I and class II molecules of APCs in the vaccinated host. Antigen-loaded APCs travel to the draining lymph nodes where they 'present' antigenic peptide-MHC complexes in combination with signalling by co-stimulatory molecules to naive T cells. This interaction provides the necessary secondary signals to initiate an immune response and to activate and expand T cells or, alternatively, to activate b cell and antibody production cascades. Together, both humoral and cellular immune responses are engendered.",

These approaches focused primarily on antibody induction in mice and included important targets, such as herpes simplex virus, hepatitis B virus, HIV, influenza virus and others, including viruses labelled as 'bioterroristic agents' [15] [16] [17] . The DNA platform generated a great deal of excitement preclinically as protective immunity was induced by such vaccines against a broad range of virus families. Some examples of this application include strategies that target the Rabies virus, Filovirus, Flavivirus, Togavirus and bunyanvirus, as well as the bacterial disease agent anthrax and the malaria parasite 18, 19 . In addition, owing to the ability of DNA vaccines to drive cellular immunity, cancer immune therapy agents were targeted, including those relevant to melanoma, lymphoma, and colon, prostate and breast cancers. For viruses and bacteria that have high genetic diversity and require CTLs for defence against infection, DNA platforms have been tested as immune therapy for different chronic viral infections, including human papilloma virus, hepatitis C virus and HIV. Furthermore, the CTL induction engendered by DNA approaches seems to be particularly relevant to such variable pathogens.",

The goals of the various clinical trials were to demonstrate the safety and tolerability of the candidate vaccines, and to and explore the limits of immune potency of specific DNA vaccines in humans (TABLE 1) . The earliest Phase I clinical trial for a DNA vaccine was of an HIV-1 candidate tested in individuals infected by HIV-1, followed by studies in volunteers who were not infected by . other prophylactic and therapeutic DNA vaccine trials followed, including trials that tested DNA vaccines against cancer, influenza, malaria, hepatitis b and other HIV-1 candidates [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] . These trials demonstrated that the DNA vaccine platform is well tolerated and safe, as no adverse events were reported and all studies went to completion. In this section, we focus on the results of two main applications for which prophylactic vaccines have been tested in the clinic. owing to the wealth of studies on infectious disease targets we focus on this class first, including HIV-1, and then we discuss therapeutic vaccines, including those for cancer therapy, which merit attention owing to the relevance of these studies for many diseases that involve cell proliferation.",

APCs have a dominant role in the induction of immunity of DNA vaccines by presenting vaccine-derived endogenous peptides on MHC I molecules. This can follow either direct transfection by the plasmid vaccine (2) or cross-presentation of cell-associated exogenous antigens; for example, owing to APC engulfment of apoptotic transfected cells (3) . In addition, APCs mediate the display of peptides on MHC II molecules after secreted protein antigens that have been shed from transfected cells are captured and processed within the endocytic pathway (4). Antigenloaded APCs travel to the draining lymph node (DLN) via the afferent lymphatic vessel (5) where they present peptide antigens to naive T cells via MHC and the T cell receptor (TCR) in combination with co-stimulatory molecules, providing the necessary secondary signals to initiate an immune response and expansion of T cells (6) . In response to peptide-bound MHC molecules and co-stimulatory secondary signals, activated CD4 T helper cells secrete cytokines during cell-to-cell interaction with B cells and bind to costimulatory molecules that are required for B cell activation (7) . In addition, shed antigen can be captured by specific high affinity immunoglobulins (B cell receptors; BCLs) expressed on the surface of B cells in the DLN; these then present processed antigen to CD4 T helper cells, thereby facilitating the induction of an effective B cell response. In theory, once migrating T cells have been primed in the DLN they could be restimulated and further expanded at the site of immunization by presentation of the peptide-MHC complexes displayed by transfected muscle cells. These processes coordinately elicit specific immunity against plasmid-encoded antigen by activating both T and B cells, which, now they are 'armed', can travel through the efferent lymphatic system (8) and provide a surveillance system. Together, the two arms of the immune system, which are induced specifically following DNA vaccination, can create a powerful defence against most infectious diseases.",

The DNA vaccine contains several HIV antigens as the priming immunogen, which is followed by boosting with a recombinant MVA that also contains HIV antigens; this combination approach is well tolerated and produces detectable and reproducible cellular immunity in humans 26 . A DNA prime followed by an MVA boost was also studied by the McMichael group 27 . This DNA vaccine was composed of a string of DNA epitopes for HIV and a DNA fragment encoding the subtype A HIV gag antigen as the priming immunogens; this was followed by an MVA boost that contained the same vaccine antigens. However, like other epitope vaccines delivered by different DNA approaches, only low-level T cell responses were induced by this vaccine, suggesting that the function of epitope-based vaccines in humans warrants further study.",

These studies clearly support the view that this platform combination can be useful in the clinic for vaccine targets that are CD4 + T cell dependent; however, new approaches that lead to the induction of more potent CTL responses continue to be a focus for HIV-1 studies.",

The viral vector generated using adenovirus serotype 5 (Ad5) is the most potent, although vectors based on new and promising primate serotypes, as well as rare human serotypes, are also being developed. Much of the work on Ad5-based vaccines is being applied to the HIV-1 vaccine arena. Important studies from Merck and the Vaccine Research Center at the National Institutes of Health have directly compared CTL induction generated in humans by plasmid vectors versus the Ad5 recombinant vector. both studies showed that plasmid DNA was at least four times less potent in magnitude and response rate than Ad5 vaccines that contained similar HIV antigen cassettes. However, a recent comparison of the immune responses induced by the Ad5 viral vector approach that was stopped by Merck recently 28 and that of the Vaccine Research Center, which uses a prime-Ad5 boost approach 29,30 , demonstrated little difference in the immune responses elicited by the two vaccination strategies, in contrast to data from preclinical animal model testing. This study by Merck again illustrates the need to improve the immune potency of the DNA approach in priming studies. The lack of translation from animal model to humans further demonstrates the need for continued improvements in delivery technology and other optimizations of the important prime-boost strategy, and underscores the limitation of naked plasmid approaches in this format.",

In one important Phase I clinical trial, plasmid DNA encoding the potent cytokine interleukin-12 was delivered directly into melanoma lesions, followed by electroporation. Clinical remissions of tumours were reported, even for lesions that were distant from the injection site in some patients 31 . The use of helper toxoids linked to T cell epitopes delivered by electroporation to enhance immune responses against prostate cancer is also promising 32, 33 .

It could be argued that the use of DNA in these animal products represents an easy target in the DNA vaccine arena, compared with potential human applications. For example, the antibody titres induced by the West Nile virus vaccine in horses are very low, suggesting a low threshold for immune protection from this specific pathogen, at least in this species. However, the canine melanoma immune therapy, a model system with clear similarity to human disease, and the electroporation delivery of GHRH in pigs, a large species, argue differently. These two clinical veterinary successes suggest that, with some adjustments, both of these products might give rise to human analogues that can be used to alleviate human disease. These product successes bode well for the sustainability and growth of the field as they are probably the tip of the iceberg regarding the practicality of DNA vaccines as formulated products for animal health.",

If integration is detected at all, it typically occurs at rates that are orders of magnitude below the spontaneous mutation frequency 44 . However, vectors that are modified or adjuvanted with the goal of increasing immunogenicity could increase the chances of integration. A further concern is that an integrated vaccine might cause insertional mutagenesis through the activation of oncogenes or the inactivation of tumour suppressor genes. In addition, an integrated plasmid DNA vaccine could, in theory, result in chromosomal instability through the induction of chromosomal breaks or rearrangements.

However, more recently, promoters from non-carcinogenic sources that are equally effective have been used, including one from human cytomegalovirus (CMV) 59 (reviewed in Ref. 60) . For most vaccine plasmids, the human CMV promoter is a common choice because it promotes high-level constitutive expression in a wide range of mammalian cells, and does not suffer from downstream readthrough as might be expected from a strong promoter. Alternatively, the use of host tissuespecific promoters avoids constitutive expression of antigens in inappropriate tissues. For example, the use of the promoter of the muscle creatine kinase gene leads to the induction of antibody and T cell responses, although levels were at least tenfold lower than plasmids that contain the CMV promoter 61, 62 . These data suggest that the use of host-cell promoters limits expression and, ultimately, immunogenicity, which might be an advantage for gene delivery.",

Several other strategies to determine consensus sequence include the analysis of ancestral sequences 87 , as well as more advanced methods for epitope scanning; for example, by using T cell assays to identify reactive epitopes 10 , predictive computer analysis software 88, 89 or phage display 90 . In addition, the use of DNA libraries and protein sequence data for target epitopes that have the ability to be recognized by the human immune system have been used to identify novel epitopes for potential immunotherapy targets, such as viruses, bacteria, parasites, tumour-associated antigens or other self-antigens associated with the pathogenesis of disease [91] [92] [93] . Such constructs can drive improved crossreactive immune responses, particularly at the T cell level and in mouse systems. Primate and human studies of epitope strings as DNA vaccines have not indicated that these approaches are as potent as whole antigen sequences. However, it is hoped that the potency of this strategy will be improved by new approaches to link epitopes, by the inclusion of helper T cell sequences, and by new epitope selection technologies -particularly when coupled with new delivery strategies. In the cancer model, for example, tumour-specific antigen epitopes have been linked to fragments of tetanus toxoid to improve helper T cell responses 94 .

Multiple laboratories have reported that co-injection of plasmids encoding cytokines, chemokines or co-stimulatory molecules can have a substantial effect on the immune response to plasmid-encoded antigen; these include studies in multiple viral and cancer antigen systems. For example, in non-human primates interleukin-12 is a potent DNA vaccine adjuvant for cellular immunity. In addition, many other classes of immune modulatory molecule exist that target death receptors, growth factors, adhesion molecules, other cytokines 120 and chemokines as well as Toll-receptor ligands. The growing number of immune adjuvant formulations described above can be used individually or in combination to maximize effects. In addition, synthetic oligodeoxynucleotides containing unmethylated CpG motifs act as immune adjuvants in mice, as they boost the humoral and cellular response to co-administered antigens 121 . Moreover, the large number of ongoing preclinical studies underscores the importance and usefulness of these adjuvants owing to their pleiotropic effects on the growth, differentiation, maturation, survival and proliferation of many different cell types. DNA vaccination strategies that incorporate immune modulatory formulation adjuvants should improve responses in the clinic, in both prophylactic and therapeutic studies.",

These efforts are expected to accelerate the commercialization of PMeD as an effective approach for vaccination against infectious diseases. Jet-injection mechanical devices aim to deliver protein and DNA vaccines into the viable epidermis, thus providing potentially safer alternatives to needle injection, and this method promises increased efficacy in the prevention and/or therapy of infectious diseases, allergic disorders and cancer [131] [132] [133] [134] [135] [136] . The tattoo perforating needle device has a bundle of fine metal needles that oscillate at a constant high frequency and puncture the skin, leading to DNA transfer to skinassociated cells and the expression of reporter genes in mice 137 , which results in the induction of T cell responses. A recent novel approach that was reported in small animals is to target epitope-based DNA vaccines to DCs using DC-targeting ligands 138 . It will be crucial to determine how these technologies will ultimately translate to the clinic.",

In vivo expression levels improved markedly using this approach -levels increased by several fold over plasmid injection alone. This method might allow for less frequent immunizations with the DNA platform, and can improve both cellular and humoral responses. Again, this has been shown mostly in smaller animal models and, in particular, tumour systems 32, 141, 144, [147] [148] [149] [150] [151] [152] [153] [154] [155] [156] [157] [158] [159] . However, recent studies have moved these delivery strategies to the non-human primate model 142, 149, 153, [160] [161] [162] . Several different strategies of this technology are being pursued, including: those that deliver an electric current at the same time as the DNA injection; devices that use constant voltage or monitored constant current; devices fitted with penetrating probes that target the muscle or the skin; and strategies that use callipers to deliver an electric pulse through the skin. However, too little is currently known about several of these devices and much additional research in this area is warranted.",

Important pressing issues include a comparison of the immune responses induced by these strategies with the best recombinant viral platforms and their tolerability in humans. As DNA vaccines delivered by electrostimulation deliver a higher bolus of antigen produced by a lower dose of plasmid, there are conceptual positive safety aspects of this technology, as well as additional concerns that arise from our unfamiliarity with this technology in humans. The strong results produced by this approach in non-human primates and large animals including pigs, horses and cattle are encouraging.",

During this time DNA vaccine technologies have generated great deal of excitement as well as disappointment. This situation, however, is similar to the development of a different breakthrough technology platform, that of monoclonal antibodies. More than 20 years elapsed between Kohler and Millstein\"s pioneering report of hybridoma technology 163 to the commercialization of the first human therapeutic antibody product. New technologies seem to be simple and straightforward but, as illustrated in this Review, they are deceptively so. An initial idea is transformed into a workable platform only through subtle and gradual improvements. In this regard it is clear that, after several years of frustration, the DNA platform is back on a productive path. In fact, as shown in BOX 2, the DNA platform represents almost one quarter of all gene therapy vector systems under clinical evaluation. This opinion is strengthened by recent licenses in the area of animal health and by the improvements in immune potency reported in the non-human primate model systems.",

Previous clinical disappointments highlight the likelihood that complexity in DNA vaccine design -including better and improved formulations, better delivery technologies, enhanced plasmid and delivery approaches, and more judicious clinical implementation -will be a staple for the continued enhancement of this platform. The further advancement of the DNA platform will continue to be an exciting and highly productive adventure that illustrates the best in academic creativity and translational science. Its success will be built on a high level of cooperation between industry, the regulatory authorities, funding by non-governmental organizations, the public and academicians.",

DNA vaccine technology has been the target of ongoing efforts to optimize the platform to increase antigen expression and vaccine immunogenicity (see main text for a detailed explanation of each step). There are currently several ways in which antigen expression and immunogenicity can be improved for the DNA vaccine platform. These include: optimization of the transcriptional elements on the plasmid backbone (1); strategies to improve protein expression of the gene of interest (2), including factors to avoid (for example, chi-sites, which are sequences that encourage crossing-over to occur at that site); inclusion of formulation adjuvants (3) or immune plasmid adjuvants (4); and the use of nextgeneration delivery methods (5) . Several formulations have been developed and are being testing at all stages of preclinical and clinical development for their ability to enhance antigen expression and immunogenicity. These mechanisms include encapsulation and protection of DNA from extracellular degradation through to particle trapping and highvelocity delivery, with the ultimate goal of introducing the plasmid directly into the cytosol of target cells. In addition, immune adjuvant classes that encode immune modulatory molecules that target death receptors, growth factors, adhesion molecules, cytokines and chemokines as well as Toll receptor ligands exist. It should be noted that many of these plasmid optimization and formulation strategies, as well as the adjuvant systems, are used in combination with novel delivery mechanisms that result in an overall enhanced vaccine platform.
