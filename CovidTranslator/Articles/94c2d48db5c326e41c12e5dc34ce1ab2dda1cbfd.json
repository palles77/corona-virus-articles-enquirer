Of more than 3,600 known viruses, hundreds can infect human cells and most of those are associated with disease. To gain access to the cell interior, animal viruses attach to host-cell receptors. Advances in our understanding of how viral entry proteins interact with their host-cell receptors and undergo conformational changes that lead to entry offer unprecedented opportunities for the development of novel therapeutics and vaccines.",

            "text": "Probably the first observation of specific attachment of a virus to a cell was made at the start of the twentieth century by d'Herelle 1 . He cultured Shigella and observed occasional clear spots -lysed bacteria -in a lawn of bacterial growth on a solid agar medium which he called plaques. The viruses that had lysed Shigella were named bacteriophages. Using co-sedimentation experiments, he showed that the attachment of the virus to the host cell is the first step in infection, and that attachment only occurred when the virus was mixed with bacteria that were susceptible to the virus. This early study showed that the host range of a virus was determined by the attachment step. A century later, we are beginning to understand the details of an increasing number of virus-receptor interactions at the atomic level. All viruses contain nucleic-acid genomes (either RNA or DNA), which are packaged with proteins that are encoded by the viral genome.Viruses can be divided into two main categories; enveloped viruses, which have a lipid membrane (envelope) that is derived from the host cell; and nonenveloped viruses, which lack a membrane.Viruses from 24 different families can cause, or are associated with, diseases in humans (TABLE 1) , so it is crucial to understand how different viruses solve the problem of entry into cells, and how this process can be inhibited. This review summarizes recent advances in our understanding of virus entry mechanisms at the molecular level and options for therapeutic intervention of these processes.",

After binding to receptors -which can be proteins, carbohydrates or lipids -viruses use two main routes to enter the cell -the endocytic and non-endocytic routes. The endocytic route is usually by transport in clathrin-coated vesicles or pits, but nonclathrin-coated pits, macropinocytosis or caveolae are also used 2 . Some viruses can induce internalization by endocytosis -for example, simian virus 40 (SV40), which induces local actin polymerization and dynamin recruitment at the site of entry 3 (FIG. 1) . The non-endocytic route of entry involves directly crossing the plasma membrane at neutral pH (FIG. 1) . Viruses that use the non-endocytic route can also enter cells by the endocytic pathway -for example, human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1). Membrane fusion -a basic cellular process that is essential for phagocytosis, pinocytosis and vesicular trafficking -is a basic mode of entry by enveloped viruses that use the endocytic or non-endocytic routes. The process is regulated and is mediated by membrane proteins once the membranes are in close proximity to each other. For both enveloped and non-enveloped viruses, entry into cells involves important conformational changes of the Surface-exposed nuclear localization signals on the nucleoprotein complex allow targeting to and entry into the nucleus, and infection of non-dividing cells.",

This can occur either by penetration (for non-enveloped viruses) or fusion (for enveloped viruses).

Some viruses, such as adeno-associated virus serotype 2 (AAV-2), SFV and influenza can cross the endosomal membranes very rapidly (within seconds), and the efficiency of entry can be as much, or more than, 50% (which means that 50% of attached viruses enter cells). Single AAV-2 virions can cross membranes in less than a second 11 and individual influenza virions cross membranes in as little as one or more seconds 12, 13 . Other viruses, such as HIV-1, take one or more minutes to enter cells, and the efficiency of entry is poor compared with AAV-2 -often as low as 0.1% (REFS 14, 15) . The kinetics and efficiency of virus entry might be related to the virus structure and it seems that the best kinetics and efficiency of entry are observed for viruses that use low pH as an entry trigger and have flattened structures -such as SFV. Cell-bound SFV can fuse in seconds with an efficiency of 80% (REF. 16 ). Membrane lipid composition and structure also affect the kinetics and efficiency of virus entry.",

Metastable states can exist for a long time if the height of the barrier is high and be undistinguishable from a truly stable state.

The rate of transition is determined by the difference in the energies of the initial and final states, temperature and various parameters including molecular conformations and viscosity. The similarity between the topologies of the nonenveloped reovirus and adenovirus attachment proteins extends to their three-dimensional structures even though the amino-acid sequences of these two proteins share no sequence similarity 25 (FIG. 3a,b) . The similarity between the 3D structures, together with the conservation of function, indicates a common ancestor for these proteins, but does not preclude convergent evolution. The overall similarities between the topologies of the non-enveloped reovirus and adenovirus attachment proteins, and between the topologies of the ENVELOPE GLYCOPROTEINS (Envs) from enveloped viruses, such as influenza HA 26 and the respiratory syncitial virus (RSV) fusion protein (which has been predicted based on sequence similarity with the homologous fusion protein of the Newcastle disease virus (NDV) 27 ) is notable, particularly owing to the lack of amino-acid sequence identity between these proteins (FIG. 3) . However, the stems of the reovirus and adenovirus attachment proteins are stabilized by triple \u03b2-spirals, whereas the stems of influenza HA and respiratory syncitial virus F protein are stabilised by \u03b1-helical coiled-coils, which indicates that these viruses have different ancestors. The structures of the enveloped flavivirus E proteins from TBE 28 and dengue virus 29 and the enveloped alphavirus SFV E1 protein 30 are similar to each other, which, in combination with similar functions, might indicate the existence of a common ancestor for the entry proteins of flaviviruses and alphaviruses 30 . Virus entry proteins have been divided into two classes that are dependent on several criteria, including mechanism of action, whether the entry protein is cleaved and whether the entry protein is complexed with other viral proteins. Envs that contain coiled-coils, such as influenza HA, paramyxovirus fusion protein F and HIV glycoprotein 160 (gp160), have been designated class I FUSION PROTEINS and the Envs of alphaviruses and flaviviruses have been designated class II fusion proteins 30,31 . Viral entry proteins have diverse amino-acid sequences, but many of those for which the structure has been solved contain similar 3D structural motifs -although the overall topology can be different. This is especially notable for non-enveloped viruses; the viral proteins that are exposed to the environment and recognize receptor molecules from several plant, insect and mammalian viruses contain the same basic core structure, which consists of an 8-stranded \u03b2-barrel with a jelly-roll motif 18 . Although only a few Env structures have been solved, it seems that they might use similar types of structural motifs as nonenveloped viruses for the recognition of host cells. The globular head of the best-characterized viral Env that mediates entry -the HA of the orthomyxovirus influenza -contains a \u03b2-barrel-type structure 26 (FIG. 3) . The head of the NDV F protein, comprises an immunoglobulin-type \u03b2-sandwich domain and a highly twisted \u03b2-sheet domain 32 . Fragments of two other Envs -the HSV glycoprotein D 33 and the receptor-binding domain of Friend murine leukaemia virus (Fr-MLV) 34 -also contain \u03b2-barrel structures viruses -for example, SFV 23 (FIG. 2c) and dengue virus 24 -have been published, which have been solved to no more than 9-\u00c5 resolution by cryoelectron microscopy.",

One exception is the high-affinity binding of the adenovirus fibre to the coxsackievirus-adenovirus receptor (CAR), which does not involve significant conformational changes (FIG. 4) .

Virus-receptor function is affected by membrane organization. Lipid rafts have been intensively studied to determine any possible role in virus entry 5 . Although rafts are well characterized, their role in virus entry is controversial. Studies on HIV-1 entry illustrate the controversies that still exist with regard to the role of rafts in virus entry. Together, depletion of cholesterol and inhibition of glycosphingolipid synthesis decrease the efficiency of HIV-1 Env-mediated membrane fusion -typically by about two-foldwhich could indicate effects on membrane fusion owing to the disruption of raft integrity 5 . The raft component glycosphingolipids Gb3 and GM3 seem to interact with gp120 in the presence of CD4, which could also indicate that rafts are involved in HIV-1 entry 49 . However, recent data indicate that HIV-1 infection does not depend on the presence of CD4 and CCR5 in rafts and it has been proposed that cholesterol modulates HIV-1 entry by an independent mechanism, perhaps related to membrane merging or modulation of co-receptor binding 50 . Although the The conformational changes that are induced by interactions with one receptor can be required to expose the binding site for another receptor, for example the interaction between CD4 and gp120 induces the exposure of a high-affinity binding site for a co-receptor (typically CCR5 or CXCR4) on HIV-1 gp120. In this case, CD4 serves as an 'attachment' receptor that ensures specific binding to CD4-expressing cells and the co-receptor serves as a 'fusion' receptor that induces conformational changes that lead to exposure of fusogenic sequences. In some strains of HIV-1, coreceptors can mediate both attachment and fusion in the absence of CD4. Entry can also be initiated by binding to a low-affinity receptor, such as heparin sulphate, followed by higher affinity interactions. The role of many receptors in entry remains unresolved or controversial. Entry into cells through interactions with more than one receptor seems to be widely used by viruses, especially for the infection of specific types of cells in vivo. In the case that a specific cell receptor is absent, ALTERNATIVE VIRUS RECEPTORS have also been identified for some viruses. For example, galactosyl ceramide 40 and its sulphated derivative (sulphatide) can support low level HIV-1 infections in some CD4negative cell lines, although the roles of such alternative receptors in vivo remain unknown.",

According to the metastable-state hypothesis, receptor binding or a pH change (or possibly both events 53, 54 , but this possibility is debated 55 ) can provide the activation energy that is required to overcome energy barriers for the viral entry protein to reach a stable, energetically favourable state. The energy of the transition to this state is used to externalize sequences from internal parts of entry proteins that can destabilize membranes. The structural transition of the virus entry protein and subsequent action of the externalized membranedestabilizing sequence induces the formation of membrane pores and membrane fusion pores.",

            "text": "The prototype class I fusion protein is influenza HA. Perhaps the best-characterized fusion intermediates are the helical coiled-coils that are formed by fragments from fusion proteins of representative orthomyxo-, paramyxo-, retro-, filo-, and coronaviruses 38,56,57 . These structures are thought to represent the lowest energy state, which is reached after a series of conformational changes that are induced by receptor binding or low pH. In addition to the formation of coiled-coils during fusion, the Envs from many of these viruses mature by proteolytic cleavage of precursor proteins to yield membrane-anchored subunits, which contain N-terminal fusion peptides, but some coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV, are not cleaved and remain trimeric throughout the fusion process 30,31 . A similar, but fourstranded, coiled-coil is involved in a number of intracellular fusion processes, which include synaptic vesicle fusion 20 . Although the formation of the coiled-coils is irreversible, it does involve some reversible steps -for example, in the case of influenza HA 58 . The molecular details of the pathway that leads to the formation of these structures are not fully understood, but include several intermediates that can be distinguished by kinetic measurements and structural analysis 56, 59 (FIG. 5) . Molecular dynamics simulations of the conformational transitions of the influenza HA that are induced by a change from a neutral to a low pH might indicate that a complete dissociation of the globular domains of the HA proteins could expose the fusion peptides and reorientate the peptides towards the target membrane, which is consistent with a spring-loaded conformational-change hypothesis 60 . Class II fusion proteins are not proteolytically cleaved and have internal, rather than N-terminal fusion peptides 30,31 . They are synthesized as a complex with a second membrane glycoprotein, and the exact role of rafts in receptor-expressing host cells is controversial, recent experiments have clearly shown the importance of rafts for membrane fusion by clustering sufficient numbers of influenza HA molecules in rafts 200-280 nm in diameter 6 . So, it appears that in both receptor-expressing and Env-expressing cells the function of rafts is mainly to increase the local concentrations of molecules that are involved in entry. Glycosphingolipids might not only provide the structural basis for raft formation, but could also interact directly with viral entry proteins and cellular receptor molecules. Influenza virus, which is internalized into an endosome, is shown as an example. In the native state of the fusion protein -which is a trimer -most of the surface subunit (green) is exposed. Part of the transmembrane subunit, including the fusion peptide, is not exposed. Following fusion-activating conditions, conformational changes occur to 'free' the fusion peptide (red) from its previously unexposed location. In the case of influenza HA, this occurs by a 'spring-loaded' mechanism. The 'pre-hairpin' intermediate spans two that the pH-triggered conformational changes result in insertion of class II protein \u03b2-barrels into the host membrane, which, in turn, leads to fusion-pore formation 24 . It seems that once the viral protein conformational changes have provided sufficient energy to enable close membrane apposition (less than 1 nm) and destabilization, formation of the fusion pore can proceed through intermediates, stalks and hemifusion diaphragms, which might be common to all known viral membrane fusion processes 70, 71 . Data obtained for baculovirus gp64 are consistent with this hypothesis 72 .",

It is a dynamic process and small pores can open and close reversibly. Models of fusion-pore formation are mainly based on fusion mediated by influenza HA, but might prove generally valid.

Fusion of the more complex enveloped viruses is better understood owing to the similarities between enveloped viruses and cells -both are surrounded by membranes and their fusion does not necessarily require a significant reorganization of the viral nucleoprotein complex. By contrast, either the whole non-enveloped virus must cross the membrane, or it must undergo important conformational changes and transfer the genome through the membrane. In the latter case, the energy of the metastable state must be used not only to destabilize the cell membrane, but also to reorganize the nucleoprotein complex so that the genome can be released through the destabilized membrane either through pores or other structures. Although the structures of several key intermediates in the conformational changes of viral entry proteins have now been solved to atomic resolution, it is clear that there is a great deal left to learn owing to the difficulties that are associated with studying the rapid conformational changes of only a few molecules of each virion against a background of large numbers of surface molecules on the virion that undergo no structural changes.",

For class I fusion proteins it was recently found that the formation of six-helix bundles stabilizes fusion-pore formation 67 . A spring-loaded conformational change 68 (FIG. 5) is required, but might not be sufficient, for HA-mediated fusion, and the transition to the membrane fusion pore could depend, in part, on the subsequent action of the HA fusion peptide and transmembrane domain 69 . For class II fusion proteins it was proposed toxic side effects. Although these problems are common to the development of other antiviral (and cancer) drugs and limit their efficacy, the development of entry inhibitors might also face specific challenges. Viruses have evolved to recognize cellular receptors and enter cells despite the presence of the host immune system. Antibodies that exhibit inhibitory effects on virus entry must bind viruses that have already developed a number of strategies for immune evasion, including the use of immunodominant variable loops and incomplete complementary binding surfaces, oligomeric occlusion, glycosylation 81 , conformational masking 82 and multivalent interactions. Some problems that are inherent to the design of any inhibitor are especially challenging for those targeted to virus entry, such as the inhibition of high-affinity protein-protein interactions by small molecules. Another strategy used by viruses to counteract the action of antibodies and other entry inhibitors is the direct cell-to-cell transmission of viruses, which avoids or reduces the exposure of the virus to inhibitors that are not designed to penetrate through membranes or other barriers. This could be one important reason for the low efficacy that is observed in vivo of otherwise potent in vitro inhibitors. Low inhibitor potency combined with a high virus mutation rate is perhaps the most challenging problem in the development of entry inhibitors.",

A related example is a class of peptides that could have broad applications to acidic Golgi vesicles. It seems that viruses have developed strategies to cope with this problem. For example, the G protein of rhabdoviruses, such as rabies and VSV, can exist in native, activated and inactive conformations. It was proposed that the inactive state helps to avoid membrane fusion during the transport of the G protein 73 . However, the HIV-1 Env can induce cell lysis after interaction with receptors -probably through disruption of important intracellular membranes -so methods to cope with destabilization of cell functions are not universal 74 . The significance of membrane fusion effects in human pathogenesis is unclear. Perhaps viruses that are well adapted to their hosts do not induce significant pathogenic effects that could lead to a reduction of virus production. However, viruses that infect a new host, such as HIV and SARS, might not be well adapted to this host and their entry proteins could cause CYTOPATHIC EFFECTS. Cell fusion -perhaps mediated by Envs -by endogenous retroviruses could contribute to cancer 75 .",

Only T-20 (which is marketed as enfuvirtide) is used for the treatment of ongoing viral (HIV-1) infection. The humanized monoclonal antibody Synagis (which is also known as palivizumab) is used for the prevention of RSV infections in neonates and immunocompromised individuals. T-20 is not a small molecule -regarded as the 'gold standard' for a drug -but is a peptide that cannot be taken orally. A small organic molecule entry inhibitor (pleconaril) showed promising results for the treatment of infections caused by the picornaviruses that cause the common cold 80 , but was not approved by the FDA owing to concerns about potential interactions with other drugs -although different formulations are presently being evaluated for use in life-threatening disease.

It seems that the efficacy of Synagis in vivo is correlated with the high affinity of binding and potency of this antibody in vitro 94 .

It was initially hypothesized that the conserved amino acid residues of the canyon are not accessible by antibodies; however, it was later shown that a strongly neutralizing antibody, Fab17, can penetrate deep within the receptor-binding canyon by undergoing a large conformational change without inducing conformational changes in the virus 90, 93 . Unusually, not only the hypervariable residues but also residues from the framework region of Fab17 contact the canyon. Yet another remarkable mechanism of immune recognition of viruses is the recently discovered receptor mimicry by post-translational modification (tyrosine sulphation) of antibodies (REF. 94 ; Huang, C. et al., manuscript in preparation). It seems that any accessible viral surface can be recognized by antibodies. Rapidly mutating viruses can escape neutralizing antibodies even if they bind to structures that are essential for virus replication, such as receptor-binding sites, unless they bind with energetically identical profiles 95 .Whether a virus will escape neutralization by antibodies depends on the interplay between the antibody affinity (avidity) and kinetics of binding, generation rate, concentration and the viral mutation rate and fitness. Mutations of immunodominant structural loops that form antibody-binding sites and mutations leading to changes in oligosaccharide attachment to viral entry proteins are common mechanisms by which viruses avoid neutralization 90, 96 .",

The peptides are derived from regions of fusion proteins (heptad repeats) that have a propensity to form coiledcoils and which serve as fusion intermediates and enable oligomerization of proteins.

Similar peptides from other viruses, including HTLV-1, RSV, measles virus, Nipah virus, Hendra virus, Ebola virus and SARS-CoV, are also promising entry inhibitor candidates. However, Ebola virus is inhibited only at very high concentrations, influenza HA-mediated fusion is not inhibited and SARS-CoV infection might not be inhibited either (K. Bossart and C.

In a related approach, viral entry proteins are used to produce drug and gene delivery vehicles, for example, the F protein of Sendai virus has been incorporated into liposomes to form virosomes 101 and the L protein of hepatitis B has been incorporated into yeast-derived lipid vesicles 102 . Retargeting of retroviruses, adenoviruses and AAVs has been achieved by conjugation of entry proteins with molecular adaptors, such as bi-specific antibodies that have particular receptor-binding properties. Modification of the entry proteins so that the normal receptor-binding property is abolished, or a ligand for alternative receptor binding is incorporated has also been successful at redirecting adenovirus tropism in cell culture, but is unlikely to work for the entry of viruses that require receptorinduced conformational changes, such as retroviruses, unless detailed molecular mechanisms of those conformational changes are better understood. A related approach is based on screening libraries of chimaeric Envs from different strains of MLV 103 , or randomized peptides inserted at tolerant sites in viral proteins, such as VP3 of AAV 104 . This approach seems promising for the selection of specific retargeting vectors. Understanding the structure of AAV 105 and other viruses could help to further improve the specificity and efficiency of retargeting.

It requires the development of new approaches to study the rapid conformational changes of a small number of membraneinteracting protein molecules that are surrounded by many more non-interacting molecules. A more realistic goal is the determination of the structures of proteins that mediate the entry of all human viruses and the identification of the cognate cellular receptors. If research continues at the present pace, this goal could be accomplished within the next decade. Identification of all the cellular receptors for human viruses would be an important contribution to our understanding of virus tropism and pathogenesis. The various, and in many cases unexpected, ways that entry proteins can affect pathogenesis could offer new opportunities for intervention. Rational structure/mechanism-based design of entry inhibitors and vaccine immunogens that are capable of eliciting potent, broadly neutralizing antibodies of known epitopes is expected to contribute towards the development of clinically useful therapeutics and vaccines. The development of panels of human monoclonal antibodies against every entry-related protein of all pathogenic human viruses could accelerate our understanding of entry mechanisms and help to fight viral diseases. Recent progress in virus retargeting also raises hopes for the possibility of designing entry machines that can deliver genes and other molecules to any cell of choice.",

Identification of broadly neutralizing antibodies and the characterization of their epitopes could help to design vaccine immunogens that would be able to elicit these neutralizing antibodies in vivo -so-called retrovaccinology 89 .
