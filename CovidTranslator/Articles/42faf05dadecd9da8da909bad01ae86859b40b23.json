As the role of amino acids for immune function of cats has not been evaluated in detail so far, the present study aimed at investigating the effects of eight different amino acids (arginine, leucine, isoleucine, valine, glutamine, lysine, threonine and tryptophan) in six concentrations each (0, 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2 and 8x the cat blood level) on cytokine secretion and proliferative activity of feline T cells (MYA-1) in vitro. The results demonstrated that high doses of arginine increased IL-4, IL-10 and TNF-a secretion of T cells, while increasing concentrations of lysine increased IL-10 secretion and proliferative activity of the T cells. High doses of leucine enhanced GM-CSF and IL-10 secretion, while concentrations of threonine in the cell culture media greater than blood concentration also increased GM-CSF and additionally TNF-a secretion of the cells. The effects of glutamine and isoleucine on T cell function were only small. In conclusion, the present in vitro study could evaluate the immunomodulating potential of specific amino acids for feline T cell function. High doses of arginine, lysine, leucine and threonine had a significant impact on cytokine secretion and proliferative activity of the T cells. Targeted in vivo studies should investigate the clinical relevance of dietary supplementation of those amino acids in healthy and diseased cats as a next step.",

Since in vivo measurement of immunological parameters implies considerable time and restraints in animal welfare, alternatives to animal trials are required and have also become an important objective in the European Legislation (''reduction, replacement and refinement''). Investigations with feline cell cultures may be particularly interesting as a screening method for immunological effects of dietary factors prior to the conduction of selected in vivo studies.

The modes of action include an activation of immune cells, an effect on lymphocyte proliferation, gene expression and the redox state in cells, and a regulation of the secretion of antibodies and bioactive substances such as cytokines (Li et al. 2007 ).

Cells were cultivated in these cell culture media for 2 days prior to the following measurements of cytokine secretion and for 3 days prior to the measurement of proliferative activity. Different cell culture batches were used for the cytokine measurements and measurements of the proliferative activity of the T cells as well as for the replicates.

However, in vitro studies might also be interesting as screening method for immunonutritional effects in cats. In this study, the effects of eight different amino acids with six doses each were evaluated concerning stimulating or inhibiting effects on cytokine secretion and proliferative activity of feline T cells. The realization of a similar in vivo study would require 48 different experimental diets. Moreover, immunological responses to dietetic treatments might only be detectable when considering a sufficiently long feeding period.

            "text": "The effects of the amino acids arginine, leucine, isoleucine, valine, glutamine, lysine, threonine and tryptophan on feline T cells were evaluated. Among these amino acids, most immunological effects were observed for arginine and lysine. High concentrations of arginine increased IL-4, IL-10 and TNF-a secretion of T cells, while highest GM-CSF secretion and proliferative activity of the cells were observed when arginine was added to the cell culture medium in a concentration which can be found in cat blood. Increasing concentrations of lysine increased IL-10 secretion and proliferative activity of the T cells, while highest GM-CSF and IFN-c, but lowest IL-4 secretion was observed when lysine concentrations in the media were similar to blood concentrations. Both IL-4 and IL-10 are mainly produced by T cells (Turner et al. 2014) . While IL-4 increases proliferative activity of cytotoxic T cells and B cells, and immunoglobulin (Ig) E and IgG production, IL-10 shows anti-inflammatory effects, decreases cytokine production and inhibits function of mononuclear cells (Turner et al. 2014 ). The observed increase in IL-10 secretion by increasing concentrations of arginine and lysine in the cell culture media may indicate beneficial effects of these amino acids in inflammatory disorders. However, differences in IL-10 levels were only small among the selected doses of arginine and lysine. The observed increase of IL-4 secretion with increasing arginine concentrations in the cell culture media was more pronounced and may have practical relevance in pathogen defense. In addition, higher concentrations of arginine also increased TNF-a secretion of the T cells. As arginine is metabolized by nitric oxide synthases (Raber et al. 2012) , an increased production of nitric acid might explain the enhanced TNF-a secretion of the feline T cells observed in the present study. Nitric acid has been demonstrated to regulate the secretion of several cytokines, including TNF (Bogdan 2001) . Since TNF-a particularly stimulates phagocytic activity of macrophages (Turner et al. 2014) , the observed effects of high doses of arginine may be interesting to strengthen immune function in disease. The results are supported by data of Rutherfurd- Markwick et al. (2013) who could demonstrate an enhanced phagocytic activity of blood leukocytes by dietary supplementation of arginine in healthy cats. In this study, 1.9 % arginine was added to a low-protein diet (22.7 % crude protein in dry matter), and fed for 5 weeks. Phagocytic activity of blood leukocytes was increased after dietary arginine supplementation when compared to feeding a low-(22.7 % crude protein) or high-protein diet (53.0 % crude protein) without additional arginine supplementation (P \\ 0.05). The results of the present study on cytokine secretion of T cells may help to explain the mechanism of the immunostimulating effect of arginine. Future studies should investigate its clinical relevance, particularly in diseased cats.",

Stiles et al. (2002) could demonstrate some beneficial effects of dietary lysine supplementation in cats with feline herpesvirus conjunctivitis, whereas the study of Maggs et al.

Nevertheless, the observed increase in IL-10 secretion and proliferative activity of T cells by increasing levels of lysine in the cell culture media of the present investigation indicate an immunomodulating potential of lysine. Further studies may not focus on antiviral effects of this amino acid, but on its potential to support immune function in healthy and diseased cats.",
