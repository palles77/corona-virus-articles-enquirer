One of the nearest stars to Earth, Alpha Centauri shimmers some 4.4 light-years away. Put another way, if the distance from the earth to the sun were fixed at 1 inch, then one of Earth's closest neighbors would be 4.4 miles (7 km) distant. The Milky Way, our home galaxy, comprises something in the range of 200-300 billion stars. It is nestled among the other 2 trillion or so galaxies estimated to populate the observable universe, postulated to have a radius of 13.8 billion light-years.",

That means there are potentially 5-10 million times more viruses on Earth than stars thought to exist in the observable universe. Science writer Carl Zimmer offers this perspective: \"If you were to stack one virus on top of another, you'd create a tower that would stretch beyond the moon, beyond the sun, beyond Alpha Centauri, out past the edge of the Milky Way, past neighboring galaxies, to reach a height of 200 million light years.\"",

Debate lingers about whether viruses are alive. Virologists Marc H.V. van Regenmortel and Brian W.J. Mahy explain that \"A virus becomes part of a living system only after it has infected a host cell and its genome becomes integrated with that of the cell. Viruses are replicated only through the metabolic activities of infected cells, and they occupy a unique position in biology. They are nonliving infectious entities that can be said, at best, to lead a kind of borrowed life.\"",

Its creator, Charles Burchfield, may not be the most recognized name in the canon of 20th century artists but is considered by some a classic example of the \"artist's artist.\" (See Military Magic or Nature's Fool, the cover essay for the April 2012 EID, for more details about Burchfield.) He favored watercolors, often combined with gouache, pencil, charcoal, or pastels. Art scholar Paloma Alarc\u00f3 notes that \"Burchfield, who was well versed in astronomy, felt a special attraction for the sky and heavenly bodies-not only the sun and moon but also the Pleiades and certain constellations of stars, particularly Orion, which appears in winter.\" Indeed, the artist featured Orion, one most prominent and recognizable constellations visible from almost everywhere on earth, in 3 other paintings.",

The constellation fills the winter sky and dips into the trees, cinching together earth and sky. Burchfield links the points of lights within Orion using thick, hazy lines, ensuring viewers cannot miss the overall form. The spire-shaped trees stand like rockets poised to launch into the night sky. In the foreground, the underbrush, heavy with frost and ice, reaches skyward and seems to crackle like pale flames lapping at the tree trunks.",
