However, later that summer, a special WHO panel muted such sentiments by indicating that MERS did not yet constitute a \"public health emergency of international concern\" [1]. As of May 23, 2014, 635 laboratoryconfirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection, including 193 deaths, had been reported to WHO from seven countries in the Middle East, two countries in Africa, six countries in Europe, two countries in Asia, and one country in North America [2] .",

Such concerns prompted efforts to develop a more restricted receptor binding domain (RBD) of the S protein as a recombinant vaccine [9, 10] , which elicits highly effective cross-neutralizing antibody responses in the vaccinated animals [11] . An equivalent RBD molecule has now been identified from MERS-CoV spike protein (Fig. 2) [12e14], potentially making it feasible to co-develop this molecule as a recombinant MERS vaccine, alongside an RBD-based SARS vaccine. To date, however, the level of interest from scientific funding agencies to develop MERS vaccines has been modest. When considering the time and expense of developing a safe and effective vaccine against uncertain risk factors, global health policymakers have so far hesitated in prioritizing MERS-CoV vaccines for the purpose of creating a stockpile in the event of a public health emergency.",
