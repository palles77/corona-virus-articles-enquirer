Infectious agents that require living host cells for replication can only be isolated in cell culture. With the advent of molecular diagnostic assays based on nucleic acid detection, cell culture is being used less often for routine clinical diagnostic purposes, because of the long turnaround times (days to weeks), cost, and requirement for significant technical expertise to perform cell culture and interpret results (Table 1-1) . Nevertheless, isolation of viral and intracellular bacterial and protozoal pathogens in cell culture remains an important technique for the discovery of new pathogens, identification of organisms involved in disease when the results of molecular testing or serology are unavailable or equivocal, the propagation of isolates for research purposes, the generation of organisms for vaccination purposes, and the establishment of the efficacy of novel antimicrobial drugs. Vaccines for dogs and cats that are propagated in cell culture include those for canine distemper, canine adenovirus infections, parvovirus infections, rabies, and feline viral and chlamydial respiratory tract disease. Veterinary clinicians should remain aware of situations where cell culture may be the best technique to identify the presence of an infectious agent and the optimum methods for collection and submission of specimens. Knowledge of cell culture methods can help veterinary clinicians to submit the optimum specimens and to understand laboratory turnaround times, potential complications, and how to interpret results.",

Active communication between the clinician and the laboratory that performs viral isolation is recommended. Successful detection of viruses is highly dependent on (a) collecting the appropriate specimens, (b) the timing of specimen collection, and (c) rapid and proper specimen transport and processing. Thus the actions of the veterinary clinician play a critical role in ensuring positive test results when a virus is present. The clinician should discuss with the laboratory what types of viruses are suspected in light of the animal's clinical presentation. The patient signalment, history, clinical signs, immune status, travel history, and number of animals affected should be discussed to generate conclusions regarding the nature of the suspected infection (Box 1-1). Some viruses, such as feline coronavirus (FCoV), are difficult to isolate in cell culture or grow slowly, whereas others, such as feline calicivirus (FCV), replicate readily and rapidly in cell culture, and the sensitivity of cell culture is high. Viruses differ in respect to the cell type they prefer to replicate within. As a result, specimens should be sent to the laboratory with information on the specific viruses that are suspected.",

If freezing is unavoidable, freezing at \u221270\u00b0 C is preferable to freezing at \u221220\u00b0 C, and shipping on dry ice is preferable, if possible.

Specimens should be labeled with the patient data, the site(s) from which the specimen(s) was collected, specific organisms suspected, and the time and date of specimen collection. Contained specimens should be placed inside leakproof triple packaging and transported on wet ice or cold packs to the laboratory, especially if transport is expected to take longer than 1 hour.

Category A infectious substances are those capable of causing permanent disability or life-threatening or fatal disease in otherwise healthy animals and humans. 2 Most specimens submitted by veterinarians fall under Category B, which are those that do not fall under the criteria for inclusion in Category A.

The cells in the monolayer can be derived directly from an animal (primary cell culture), which tend to have a limited life span, or they may be immortalized (continuous cell lines). Primary cell cultures are needed for the isolation of some viruses, because the cells more closely resemble those present in vivo, and the replication of these viruses occurs more efficiently in primary cell lines than in continuous cell lines. Further subculture of primary cell lines often reduces their sensitivity to viral infection. Primary cell cultures are generated by placing tissues in cell culture media, often after treatment of the tissue with an enzyme such as trypsin or collagenase. Primary white blood cell cultures (such as peripheral blood mononuclear cell cultures) are generated by separation of the white cells from the other cellular elements using density gradient centrifugation, and adding them to a culture medium. Ficoll, a highly branched polysaccharide, is an example of a medium used commonly for density gradient centrifugation. Primary cell cultures have been used widely for the isolation of intracellular pathogens of dogs and cats. [3] [4] [5] [6] Low-passage cell lines remain viable and sensitive to viral infections for 20 to 50 passages. Continuous cell lines are the type of cell line used most commonly for diagnostic, research, and commercial purposes. These are derived from cancer cells (such as the widely used HeLa cell line, derived from human cervical cancer cells of a patient named Henrietta Lacks), 7 or they result from experimental induction of cellular mutations (for example, using a carcinogen). Continuous cell lines representing a wide variety of cell types are available from commercial suppliers (Table 1-3) . Laboratories that perform virus isolation for disease diagnosis may need to simultaneously inoculate multiple cell lines, because different viruses prefer to replicate in differing cell types. Mixed cell cultures are also now available commercially to simultaneously facilitate isolation of multiple different viral pathogens.",

The cells are thawed, dispersed in cell culture medium, and allowed to settle on the bottom of a plastic flask (Figure 1-1) . The cell culture medium keeps the cells moist and provides the cells with nutrients. Minimum essential medium (MEM), also known as Eagle's minimum essential medium, and Dulbecco's medium are examples of widely used synthetic cell culture media. The cell culture medium contains a balanced salt solution, essential amino acids, glucose, vitamins, and a bicarbonate buffering system. Variations of MEM are available, some of which contain nonessential amino acids, the pH indicator phenol red, and the pH buffering agent HEPES (4-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1-piperazineethanesulfonic acid), which helps to maintain a physiologic pH despite an increasing concentration of CO 2 that is produced as a result of cellular respiration. The medium often requires supplementation with animal serum, most commonly fetal calf serum, which helps the cells to attach to and spread on the plate, although serum-free medium has also been used successfully for culture of canine and feline viruses. 8 Media for cell culture growth differ from media for maintenance of cells in culture, the former generally containing a higher concentration of animal serum (10% versus 2% for maintenance medium). To prevent bacterial or fungal contamination when viral pathogens are cultured, careful attention to sterile technique is required. Manipulation of cells in the flask is performed in a laminar flow hood, and the culture medium is sometimes supplemented with antibiotics (generally ampicillin or an aminoglycoside), with or without an antifungal agent (amphotericin B or nystatin).

Loss of viral viability is more likely to occur with enveloped viruses such as canine distemper virus than with non-enveloped, hardy viruses such as canine parvovirus or FCV.",

Lowpassage cells may also lose their infectivity for viral infection if they have undergone multiple serial passages. False negatives can also occur if the plates are overgrown by bacteria or fungi. Although treatment of the viral transport and culture media with antimicrobials can help prevent this, resistant bacteria or fungi may still be present. Sometimes, multiple viruses are present within a specimen, and one virus overgrows another. For example, this can occur with mixed infections with FCV and feline herpesvirus-1 (FHV-1) in cats with upper respiratory tract disease. FCV rapidly infects Crandell-Reese feline kidney cells and produces CPE, which obscures the concurrent presence of FHV-1.",

This is especially true for specimens collected from the respiratory or gastrointestinal tracts, where multiple infectious agents may be present concurrently, and in many cases, viruses can replicate in these locations without causing clinical signs of illness. In some animals, the development of severe clinical signs is more likely when there is simultaneous presence of multiple infectious agents. As noted previously for specimens that test negative, the presence of one agent may also obscure the presence of another, more significant organism (such as with FCV and FHV-1 co-infections), which could result in the incorrect assumption that only one organism is the cause of an animal's disease.
