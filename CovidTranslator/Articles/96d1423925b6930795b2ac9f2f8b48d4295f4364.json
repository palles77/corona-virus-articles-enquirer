Adenovirus transcription and splicing is especially complex. We used long-read direct RNA sequencing to study adenovirus transcription and splicing during infection. This revealed a previously unappreciated complexity of alternative splicing and potential for secondary initiating codon usage. Moreover, we find that most viral transcripts tend to shorten polyadenylation lengths as infection progresses. Development of an open reading frame centric bioinformatics analysis pipeline provided a deeper quantitative and qualitative understanding of adenovirus's genetic potential. Across the viral genome adenovirus makes multiple distinctly spliced transcripts that code for the same protein. Over 11,000 different splicing patterns were recorded across the viral genome, most occurring at low levels. This low-level use of alternative splicing patterns potentially enables the virus to maximise its coding potential over evolutionary timescales.",

            "text": "The viral linear double-stranded DNA genome of~36,000 bp, is delivered to the host cell nucleus rapidly after virus entry, where mRNA is transcribed from both DNA strands using host cell RNA pol II. Transcription from ten different transcription units proceeds in early, intermediate or late temporal classes, as defined relative to the onset of viral DNA replication 3 . There are early (E1a, E1b, E2, E3 and E4) and intermediate (IVa2, pIX and L4) transcription units, as well as the major late transcription unit (MLTU) driven by the major late promoter (MLP) that produces transcripts for most of the virus's structural proteins. Except for pIX mRNA, all adenovirus transcripts are spliced. The MLTU itself has over 20 distinct alternative splice sites and five distinct polyadenylation sites giving rise to five different classes of mRNA L1-L5. There are three noncoding exons at the 5\u2032 of all known late mRNA (known collectively as the tripartite leader, TPL) as well as three non-coding exons present in varying amounts on a subset of MLTU mRNA (known as the x-, y-and z-leaders) 4, 5 . Finally, there is the i-leader exon, which is infrequently included between the second and third TPL exons, and codes for the i-leader protein 6 . Thus, the MLTU produces a complex array of mRNA with diverse 5\u2032-UTRs 5 , some of which are known to influence mRNA stability, spliced onto different 3\u2032 coding exons grouped into five different 3\u2032-end classes.",

            "text": "Short-read deep sequencing has created a high-resolution image of the adenovirus transcriptional landscape 7, 8 . However, there are difficulties determining how multiple splicing events are linked on a particular mRNA. For example, when i-leader exon is included in an MLTU mRNA, it is unclear which of the possible MLTU 3\u2032 exons it has been added to. Secondly, in short-read sequencing the mRNA is fragmented, reverse transcribed into cDNA, then amplified by PCR before sequencing using a second PCR-based method. These steps could introduce bias confounding qualitative and quantitative analysis. Nanopore-based direct RNA sequencing (dRNA-seq) avoids these issues because individual mRNA molecules are introduced, poly-A tail first, into the nanopore with their sequences read as they pass through the pore. This provides a direct and complete record of the exons present in any given mRNA without reverse transcription or amplification steps. dRNA-seq has recently been used to examine the transcriptome of human cells 9,10 , coronavirus 11 and herpes simplex virus 12 , revealing greater complexity than previously appreciated and underlining the power of this approach to improve our understanding of transcriptomes, even in well-studied systems.",

Key to this deeper understanding was the development of an ORF-centric approach to classification of the data.

Our analysis was confined only to transcripts, which had confirmed polyA tails at least 20 nt long on the 3\u2032-end, hence it can be excluded that these variant 3\u2032-ends represented fragmentations prior to sequencing of molecules that were actually correctly polyadenylated at the known sites.",

Soft clipping is a standard feature of sequence alignment software and refers to the practice of effectively ignoring a short number of nucleotides at the 5\u2032-or 3\u2032-end of a sequence read to allow the rest of the sequence to be aligned to the target genome. We observed that soft clipping of transcript ends was widespread only at the TTS (Supplementary  Table 2 ). Most transcripts were not soft clipped at the 5\u2032 TSS and when they were, the average soft clip size was typically <10 for 5\u2032 TSS assignments with a typical modal of one or two nucleotides.

Understanding the protein-coding potential of the detected E1b mRNAs is complicated by two factors: the initiating AUG for the 5\u2032 proximal ORF in this region (E1b19k) is very close to the published E1b TSS, and there is a second protein (E1b55k) whose expression arises from a downstream initiating AUG (ref. 20 ; Fig. 3 ). Very few transcripts that could code for E1b19k were detected in our data before programmatic extension of the 5\u2032-end (above), after which the vast majority of detected E1b transcripts coded for this protein. This intervention therefore converted apparently E1b55k mRNAs into E1b19k mRNAs. It is generally understood that translation initiation at the E1b19k AUG is inefficient, leading to the significant expression of E1b55k from these mRNAs as a group but it cannot be excluded, given the presence in our data of mapped 5\u2032-ends lying downstream of the E1b19k AUG, that some of these RNAs genuinely initiate at these locations and encode E1b55k as the 5\u2032 proximal ORF.",

However, the next ORF in these RNAs encodes preVIII-the precursor to a structural component of the capsid. Similar to other major late proteins, we would expect preVIII expression from transcripts that splice the TPL onto a splice site just upstream of the preVIII ORF. However, there were four times as many '33K 2nd exon' transcripts compared to pVIII-proximal coding transcripts, suggesting that (as in the E1b and E3 regions) there may be an expanded role for non-canonical ribosomal scanning/initiation in controlling adenovirus major late protein expression beyond the ribosome shunting process already reported 36 .

Inclusion of i-leader followed by TPL3 forms an ORF that terminates in TPL3 and encodes the ileader protein regardless of downstream splicing events. However, previously undescribed splicing arrangements following the i-leader exon were readily detected, especially TPL3 exon skipping, which links the i-leader exon and its incomplete ORF with a variety of 3\u2032 exons from L1-L5. We found over 3000 distinct transcripts of this type belonging to 900 different transcript groups creating 60 distinct ORFs, with the ileader protein N terminus fused to different C termini.

Also, the x, y-and z-leader exons have intron-exon boundaries that are integral to expression of some E3 proteins, meaning they are established components of some E3 mRNAs. To assess leader inclusion in fibre transcripts, we focused on transcripts that derived from MLP and contained one or more of the x-, y-or z-leader exons.

Conversely, many splicing events produced transcripts containing unknown ORFs-between 11% and 16% of detected transcripts did not code for any known adenovirus proteins (Supplementary Data 5). Whether these proteins are made and are functional is beyond the scope of this manuscript, but the large number of alternative transcripts is striking. For example, focusing on fibre-coding transcripts and considering only those that started and terminated at the dominant TSS (nucleotide 6051) and TTS (nucleotide 32,790) sites to exclude transcript groups that likely arose from truncated transcripts, 123 different groups were found (covering 59,005 independent sequence reads). Even considering only transcript groups with ten or more supporting reads, there were 17 distinct transcript groups with fibre protein as the 5\u2032 proximal ORF (Fig. 10a) ; similar observations were made for most of the known ORFs (e.g., Figs. 4 and 6). Most notably among fibre-coding transcripts, the TPL was not always intact, with TPL exon 2 being sometimes spliced directly to the y-leader exon or to the fibre ORF; low-frequency omission of TPL exon 3 was also seen in transcripts encoding other late proteins. Previously, the TPL (sometimes with the further inclusion of the i-leader exon, above), has been viewed as an invariant feature of MLP-derived transcripts. Also, none of the most abundant transcript groups contained the x-or z-leader exons, which were previously reported to be found in a proportion of L5 mRNAs (ref. 4 ); instead an apparently novel exon was found >50 times in two transcript groups, positioned 3\u2032 to the yleader exon. Finally, the sizes of TPL exons 2 and 3, as well as the y-leader exon, varied among the groups as a result of usage of splice donor and/or acceptor sites which have not been reported previously.",

[39] [40] [41] ). However, the roles of the other portions of preX that are liberated by this cleavage and any additional roles of the precursor relative to the mature protein are not understood. Although the excess of preX transcripts over those of pV and preVII may be needed to compensate for differences in translation rates and stability of these proteins, we believe it also suggests additional role(s) for preX. Indeed, there are many cases where our observations raise interesting questions in relation to the large body of previously published work on adenoviruses.

Adenoviral TSSs have been mapped previously with high precision which, coupled with the very high abundance of viral transcripts, allows rigorous assessment of the accuracy of 5\u2032-end position determined from the nanopore data. The 5\u2032-end position inferred by dRNA-seq was 11-16 nt downstream of the previously mapped 5\u2032-end for all the adenovirus promoters-a number that agrees with human dRNA-seq datasets 14 . The precise peak count position at each promoter was reproducible between different time point samples, indicating that differences in the sequence near the 5\u2032-end affect how close to the end of an RNA molecule dRNA-seq can read. At the 3\u2032-end there are distinct issues too; even though we could both detect and measure the length of poly-A tail, there was a notable lack of precision over the TTS. That the mapping software usually clipped the 3\u2032end of a sequence when aligning it to the genome suggested different possibilities. Potentially, mapping accurately within what is typically an A/U rich region poses problems for mapping algorithms. Alternatively, as the raw nanopore signal transitions from poly-A tail to the mixed nucleotide sequence of the RNA, there may be additional difficulties with accurate base calling. The shortening of the viral poly-A tail for viral late transcripts is intriguing; a similar observation has been reported for coronaviruses and this was associated with reduced translation efficiency 43 . Further work will be needed to see if this is the case for adenovirus. We propose that adenovirus is a useful testbed for dRNA-seq experiments aimed at improving the capture of 5\u2032-and 3\u2032-end sequence information.",

DNA viruses are traditionally perceived as relatively static in evolutionary terms compared to RNA viruses. Our analysis shows that human adenovirus type 5 produces, at low frequency compared to the wellestablished repertoire of RNAs, transcripts with an astonishing array of exon combinations, just over 11,000 across all three time points. To provide confidence that these thousands of splice events were genuine, we independently validated them by comparison of splice sites inferred by the nanopore data and by Illumina data. We also validated four of these previously unreported splice events by targeted RT-PCR analysis. groups having at least ten observed transcripts, in which the fibre ORF was the first ORF are represented as lines with exons as black boxes. The numbers of transcripts belonging to the three most abundant transcript groups and the transcripts selected for targeted RT-PCR validation is shown to the right; the remaining transcripts were observed between 10 and 72 times. The exon structure and splicing pattern of the two most abundant transcript groups is shown schematically at the top. The locations of the tripartite leader exons and the y-leader exon are also shown. Note that in many cases the transcripts have truncated y-leader exons and in some cases, there is a novel exon downstream of the y-leader exon (i.e., it is not the x-leader exon). In order to validate by targeted PCR, we designed four primers that span two uniquely connected exons. Which exon pairs are spanned by each primer are numbered and indicated in the diagram by connecting double-headed red arrows. We also designed a universal reverse primer for the fibre ORF some 180 nt upstream of the fibre start codon and indicated by a black arrow at the bottom of the figure in a. b shows the results of RT-PCR (with and without reverse transcription) using the universal reverse primer and the numbered forward primers indicated in a-the expected size of the PCR product is indicated for each primer pair.

This script produces tables indicating where on the genome and how often in the data each TSS, TTS or splice site occurs. Subsequently, these events are grouped for simplicity of analysis. For example, the most frequently used polyadenylation site is established and all other polyadenylation sites within a user defined window (in our case 15 nucleotides either side) are presumed to be grouped with that location. Once this is done the next most abundant site outside this 15-nucleotide window is selected and so on until all the polyadenylation sites are accounted for. In this analysis, splice acceptor and donor sites are not grouped.

The user can specify how many nucleotides upstream of the transcript start site for the group should be included in each pseudo transcript, in order to compensate for any observed failure to fully sequence the 5\u2032 ends of the RNA (see Results section). The script then examines each pseudo transcript to determine what features it has, using a user-specified list of canonical features or ORFs on the viral genome (Supplementary Data 9). For example, it will define the 5\u2032 most ORF and if that ORF is not canonical, search for a canonical ORF coded by the next available start codon. Finally, the software produces tables that indicate how many transcripts in total, from all the transcript groups, code for each ORF listed in the features table. The tables also include additional data, such as average polyA length for each transcript group, and the sequences of the splice donor and splice acceptor sites for all exons detected. It also produces GFF files that allow the user to visualise the dominant transcript coding for each ORF, as well as GFF files that describe the whole range of transcripts coding for any given ORF (Supplementary Data 10-13).
