This has not been reported in Campylobacter jejuni infections. METHODS: A healthy patient with fever, rigors, and an acute diarrheal illness was noted to have a white blood cell count of 2.65 \u00c2 10 9 /L and platelet level of 125 \u00c2 10 9 /L. Retrospective chart review of all adult C. jejuni stool-positive cases admitted over 1 year revealed leukopenia in 6 of 20 (30%), thrombocytopenia in 5 of 20 (25%), and both in 1 of 20 (5%). RESULTS: Cytopenias were mild, transient, and not associated with prolonged hospital stay or complications. CONCLUSIONS: Acute C. jejuni infections should be added to the differential diagnosis of acute febrile illnesses that may be associated with leukopenia or thrombocytopenia. Cytopenias can be an important diagnostic clue in febrile illnesses, and their differential is presented.",
