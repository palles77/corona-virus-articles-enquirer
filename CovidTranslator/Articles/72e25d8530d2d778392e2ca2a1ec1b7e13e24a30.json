            "text": "Titanium dioxide nanoparticles (TiO 2 NPs) induce lung inflammation in experimental animals. In this study, we conducted a comprehensive toxicogenomic analysis of lung responses in mice exposed to six individual TiO 2 NPs exhibiting different sizes (8, 20 and 300 nm), crystalline structure (anatase, rutile or anatase/rutile) and surface modifications (hydrophobic or hydrophilic) to investigate whether the mechanisms leading to TiO 2 NP-induced lung inflammation are property specific. A detailed histopathological analysis was conducted to investigate the long-term disease implications of acute exposure to TiO 2 NPs. C57BL/6 mice were exposed to 18, 54, 162 or 486 \u00b5g of TiO 2 NPs/mouse via single intratracheal instillation. Controls were exposed to dispersion medium only. Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) and lung tissue were sampled on 1, 28 and 90 days post-exposure. Although all TiO 2 NPs induced lung inflammation as measured by the neutrophil influx in BALF, rutile-type TiO 2 NPs induced higher inflammation with the hydrophilic rutile TiO 2 NP showing the maximum increase. Accordingly, the rutile TiO 2 NPs induced higher number of differentially expressed genes. Histopathological analysis of lung sections on Day 90 post-exposure showed increased collagen staining and fibrosislike changes following exposure to the rutile TiO 2 NPs at the highest dose tested. Among the anatase, the smallest TiO 2 NP of 8 nm showed the maximum response. The anatase TiO 2 NP of 300 nm was the least responsive of all. The results suggest that the severity of lung inflammation is property specific; however, the underlying mechanisms (genes and pathways perturbed) leading to inflammation were the same for all particle types. While the particle size clearly influenced the overall acute lung responses, a combination of small size, crystalline structure and hydrophilic surface contributed to the long-term pathological effects observed at the highest dose (486 \u00b5g/mouse). Although the dose at which the pathological changes were observed is considered physiologically high, the study highlights the disease potential of certain TiO 2 NPs of specific properties.",

The estimated global annual production of TiO 2 NPs is currently near 12,500 tons (1, 2) . This value is expected to reach 2.5 million metric tons by 2025 (3) . Owing to their unique physico-chemical properties, TiO 2 NPs are used in diverse applications including consumer, industrial and biomedical fields. The extensive synthesis and pervasive use of TiO 2 NPs has resulted in unprecedented avenues for human exposure to these materials in the environment and through the use of consumer products. Exposure to TiO 2 NPs via inhalation leads to pulmonary inflammation, emphysema and lung injury in experimental rodents (4, 5) . Due to their nanosize, TiO 2 NPs penetrate deep into the highly vascularised areas of lungs and persist in lungs for weeks after the last exposure (6) . In addition, TiO 2 NPs deposited in rodent lungs translocate to blood, liver, heart, lymph nodes, spleen and other organs (7) (8) (9) (10) . These results imply that exposure to TiO 2 NPs can negatively impact health of the organisms exposed.",

We have shown that all types of TiO 2 NPs induce pulmonary inflammation via the same mechanisms; however, the severity of response varies with their specific properties (22) . The transcriptomic studies discussed above were limited to few TiO 2 NP types and for now, it is not clear whether the results from those studies can be generalised to all TiO 2 NP variants. In the present study, we conducted a comprehensive investigation of lung toxicogenomic responses in mice exposed individually to six different types of TiO 2 NPs varying in size, crystalline structure and surface coatings to further our understanding of the underlying mechanisms of TiO 2 NP-induced lung responses. Acute, subchronic and chronic post-exposure time points were included along with a range of doses. The TiO 2 NP types included anatase TiO 2 NPs of 8, 20, and 300 nm, mixed anatase/rutile TiO 2 NP of 20 nm and rutile TiO 2 NPs of 20 nm with hydrophilic or hydrophobic surfaces. Mice were exposed via single intratracheal instillation to 18, 54, 162 or 486 \u00b5g/animal doses of individual TiO 2 NPs. Although the 486 \u00b5g/ animal dose is physiologically high, it was included in the study to determine whether exposure to TiO 2 NPs results in lung pathology at higher doses. Samples were collected at 1, 28 and 90 days post-exposure. Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) cellularity, histopathology, particle localization in lungs (by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and Cytoviva nanoscale hyperspectral microscopy) were assessed at all three post-exposure time points. Global gene expression profiles were generated for all doses, at Day 1 and Day 28 post-exposure time points. Pathway tools were employed to characterise the molecular pathways perturbed following exposure to TiO 2 NPs. Disease similarity tools were employed to determine whether the altered gene expression profiles are associated with any known lung disease.",

The a TiO 2 20 and a TiO 2 300 are commercially available as PC105 and tiona, respectively, from Cristal Global (http://www.cristal.com), whereas, ra TiO 2 20 is commercially known as P25 and is available from Evonik Degussa GmbH, Germany. The r TiO 2 20 (HY) and r TiO 2 20 (HP) are known as UV Titan M262 and UV Titan M212, respectively, and are available from Sachtleben Chemie GmbH, Germany. The selected anatase TiO 2 NPs are used in building materials and in air purification systems for their photocatalytic activity. They are also used in selfcleaning fabrics, glass and other products. The ra TiO 2 20 NPs are commonly used as catalyst carriers, active components for photocatalytic reactions and as heat stabilizers in silicone rubber. The two functionalised TiO 2 NPs-r TiO 2 20 (HY) and r TiO 2 20 (HP)-are used in skin and sun care products.

A dose-dependent increase in the alveolar macrophages was observed for some particle types mainly at 162 ( Figure 6B -b-g) or 486 \u00b5g doses ( Figure 6B -n-s); however, this change was less significant compared with the Day 1 post-exposure groups (Supplementary Table 7 -b). Peribronchiolar and perivascular infiltrations of lymphocytes were observed in the 162 \u00b5g and 486 \u00b5g dose groups, except in mice exposed to a TiO 2 300 (Supplementary Table 7 -b). Focal to multifocal granulomatous and pyogranulomatous inflammation were more pronounced in r TiO 2 20 (HY)-and r TiO 2 20 (HP)exposed lungs in the 162 \u00b5g ( Figure 6B-f-g) and 486 \u00b5g dose groups ( Figure 6B-r-s) . Lung sections were stained with Masson's trichrome staining to assess collagen deposition on Day 28 post-exposure in the medium-and high-dose groups. Masson's trichrome staining showed that collagen depositions were minimal in lung sections treated with TiO 2 NPs in the 162 \u00b5g dose groups ( Figure 6B-h-m) . Collagen depositions were higher in r TiO 2 20 (HY)-and r TiO 2 20 (HP)-exposed lungs in the 486 \u00b5g dose groups ( Figure 6B TiO 2 NPs may be more harmful than others. Thus, a series of experiments were conducted at 90-day post-exposure to determine whether differential transcriptomics responses among the TiO 2 NPs eventually translates into disease manifestation for some TiO 2 NPs. TEM analysis of lung sections (Figure 7) showed that an appreciable fraction of TiO 2 NPs deposited via single intratracheal instillation were retained in lung tissues up to 90 days post-exposure regardless of the specific size or surface modifications, in the 162 and 486 \u00b5g dose groups (Figure 7-a-l) . The TiO 2 NPs were mostly found dispersed in the cytoplasm and some were localized to phagocytic vacuoles (Figure 7-e-g) .

However, it is not known whether the underlying mechanisms of pulmonary inflammation are the same for all and it is also not clear whether subtle differences in the severity of acute pulmonary inflammation observed for some TiO 2 NP variants (22) translate into a disease phenotype at a later post-exposure time point. Thus, in the present study, we conducted a detailed assessment of lung responses to six different types of TiO 2 NPs with varying sizes, modifications and crystalline structures. Although the TiO 2 NP types investigated in the study were not synthesised in a controlled manner to vary in only one property at a time, from the results of the comprehensive assessment conducted, it can be concluded that the underlying mechanisms of acute pulmonary inflammation induced by TiO 2 NPs are the same regardless of their properties, which is in alignment with the previous study results published by this research group (22) . Also in alignment were the results showing that while size may be the primary determinant of the toxic potential of TiO 2 NPs, surface modifications influence the severity of the response with hydrophilic surface being more inflammogenic compared with the other types. Halappanavar et al. (22) compared the lung transcriptomic responses in mice exposed to rutile TiO 2 NPs of 10 nm, 38 nm and 10 nm TiO 2 NPs with hydrophilic surface and showed that at the transcriptional level, 10 nm particles were more responsive with highest number of DEGs. However, surface amination of 10 nm TiO 2 NPs resulting in hydrophilic surface increased the severity of the response (larger fold changes in inflammation-associated genes). The extensive transcriptomic profiling and histopathological analysis conducted in the present study confirm these findings. In the present study, the number of DEGs at Day 1 post-exposure to anatase-type TiO 2 NPs was remarkably lower for the a TiO 2 300 with the surface area of 10 m 2 /g (85 genes) and was highest for the a TiO 2 8 exhibiting 229-235 m 2 /g (225 genes). While the primary particle size may have been instrumental in the lung responses induced by the anatase type TiO 2 NPs, for the rutile types [ ra TiO 2 20 , r TiO 2 20 (HY) and r TiO 2 20 (HP)], mixed properties including surface modifications and crystallinity appeared to have influenced the responses. New to the present study was the finding that anatase TiO 2 NPs were less responsive compared with the rutile/anatase and rutile TiO 2 NPs at the transcriptional level. Although a direct comparison of responses induced by the anatase and rutile types was not possible as they vary in their surface properties, the overall biological response of mice exposed to anatase type TiO 2 NPs was less compared with the rutile ones. Previous studies have shown that crystalline structure of TiO 2 NPs plays an important role in toxicity induced by these particles (16, 18) .",

It was observed that the number of DEGs induced by r TiO 2 20 (HY) were similar to the number of DEGs induced by a TiO 2 20 ; however, r TiO 2 20 (HP) induced considerably higher number of genes at all doses and post-exposure time points compared with the other rutile and anatase TiO 2 NP types. These results suggest that the transcriptional responses to rutile type TiO 2 NPs are influenced by their surface modifications and that the hydrophilic surface positively impacts the lung responses. Although all rutile types are similar in size and surface area, mixed rutile/anatase type exhibited significantly larger transcriptomic response at the highest dose tested. The ra TiO 2 20 has been previously shown to exert higher toxicity compared with the other rutile or anatase only TiO 2 NPs (41-43). The higher activity of ra TiO 2 20 compared with that of either pure rutile type can be suggested to be due to the synergistic effects between rutile and anatase crystalline phases (44) ; however, this could not be confirmed since the present study did not include an unmodified rutile TiO 2 type.",

Higher toxicity following exposure to hydrophilic r TiO 2 20 has been shown in rats exposed via inhalation (5). Teubl et al. (45) showed that compared with r TiO 2 20 (HY), the r TiO 2 20 (HP) induces pronounced generation of reactive oxygen species by decreasing the mitochondrial membrane potential in human buccal epithelial TR146 cells (46) . Surfacecoated NMs are shown to exert higher toxicity compared with the pristine types; silica-coated rutile TiO 2 NPs elicit higher pulmonary neutrophilia, in in vivo and in vitro models (5) . Rutile TiO 2 NPs coated with alumina or alumina/silica induce higher inflammation compared with the uncoated TiO 2 NPs in Sprague Dawley rats (47) . In contrast to the above, a study by Warheit et al. showed that the uncoated ra TiO 2 20 are more harmful than the alumina or alumina/silica coated TiO 2 NPs in rats exposed by intratracheal instillation, suggesting that the crystalline structure may also be important (16, 18) .

NMs that are strongly hydrophobic in nature may non-specifically interact with the cell membrane leading to their internalisation. Preferential cellular uptake of positively charged NMs could be occurring due to the strong electrostatic interaction with the negatively charged cellular membrane (48) . Studies also have shown a differential cellular localisation of the hydrophilic TiO 2 NPs compared with the hydrophobic TiO 2 NPs (49) . The poor interactions with the lipid bilayer may also prolong the life of hydrophilic NPs in blood, which will allow them to reach specific sites and cause toxicity.",

However, the magnitude of the observed response was higher and persistent for rutile types and even more pronounced in r TiO 2 20 (HP) group, suggesting that the extent of the response is property specific. Since r TiO 2 20 (HP)-induced expression changes in few of the genes that have known association with lung fibrosis, we compared the gene expression profiles generated from the present study with the gene profiles of lungs of mice exposed to carbon nanotubes that are known to induce lung fibrosis in the same mouse model at similar doses (27, 50) . A direct comparison of the 69 fibrosis-associated genes described in Poulsen et al. and Snyder-Talkington et al. study (27, 50) , with DEGs from the present study revealed a low level of concordance with very few overlapping genes (Table 2) , which included Timp1, Ccl17, Serpine1, Sod2, Plaur1, Ccl2, Il1rn, Il1b, Ctsk and C3. Considering the fact that TiO 2 NPs are generally viewed as inert, the subtle pro-fibrotic gene responses suggest that histopathological observations of fibrotic-like changes at the high doses (162 \u00b5g and 486 \u00b5g/animal) of TiO 2 NPs may still be reflecting the early phase responses to disease development and that a full manifestation of fibrosis may require recurring exposure to TiO 2 NPs at similar dose levels. Alveolar metaplasia has been reported in rat but not in mice following exposure to TiO 2 NPs in previous studies (51, 52) . Retention of TiO 2 NPs in human lung has been reported following cumulative exposures in TiO 2 NP production plants (53, 54) . In some of these human cases, exposure to rutile TiO 2 NPs resulted in mild subpleural fibrosis (6, (55) (56) (57) (58) . However, the specific properties of the TiO 2 NPs that the humans were exposed to are not identified. The results of the present study suggest that the hydrophilic surface may render TiO 2 NPs with pro-fibrotic potential in the long term when exposed to sufficiently high doses.",

There are not many in vivo studies that have investigated the DNA damage potential of TiO 2 NPs. It was shown that a 21-nm anatase/rutile (59) and a 33-nm a TiO 2 NPs (60) induce DNA damage and genetic instability in blood cells of mice exposed orally over a short period of time. Intragastric administration of 75 nm a TiO 2 NPs to male Sprague Dawley rats for 30 days (4) was shown to induce genotoxic effects in the bone marrow. However, positive genotoxic effects have not been observed in rodent lungs exposed to TiO 2 NPs via inhalation (61, 62) . Although many studies have investigated the genotoxic effects of TiO 2 NPs using in vitro models, the results are not consistent. For example, AMES assays showed no increases in the mutagenic potential of a TiO 2 NPs in vitro models. However, DNA damage analysis using comet assays showed that uncoated 20-50 nm a TiO 2 NPs tested at a concentration of 100 \u00b5g/ mL induced DNA breaks in BEAS2B cells, bottlenose dolphin leucocytes, human gastric adenocarcinoma cells, human epidermal cells and human embryonic kidney (HEK293) cells (6, (55) (56) (57) . One other study showed positive DNA damage potential of 33 nm a TiO 2 NPs in bone marrow and liver of CBAB6F1 mice exposed via gavage (60) .

The results confirmed our previous findings that the underlying mechanisms leading to TiO 2 NP-induced lung inflammation acutely after exposure are the same regardless of their properties; however, the results suggested that the long-term pathological effects may be influenced by their specific properties such as crystallinity and surface modifications. Specifically, from the six types tested, a combination of properties such as rutile structure and hydrophilic surface can be deemed as pathologically more active compared to other types. Although TiO 2 NPs are generally regarded as inert, the results from the study suggest that unfavourable and chronic exposures to very high doses of certain TiO 2 NP types may result in tissue injury and initiate pro-fibrotic changes in lungs over a long period of time.",
