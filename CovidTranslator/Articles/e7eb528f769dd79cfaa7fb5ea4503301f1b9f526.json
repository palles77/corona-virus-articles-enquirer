            "text": "This study investigated abomasal luminal parameters in healthy and diarrheic calves by using a wireless ambulatory capsule (WAC). The acetaminophen absorption test (APAT) was used to determine abomasal emptying rate. Four healthy and five diarrheic female Holstein-Friesian calves (age < 14 days) were included in the study. For APAT, calves were fed 2 L of milk replacer containing 50 mg acetaminophen/kg body weight, and blood samples were taken during a 12-h period afterward. Concomitantly, a WAC in the abomasum continuously measured luminal pH, pressure, and temperature. Five hours post suckling, intraluminal temperature was significantly higher in diarrheic calves than in healthy calves. Abomasal pH and pressure were not significantly different, but intraluminal pressure was always numerically lower in diarrheic calves. During APAT no significant differences in maximum acetaminophen concentrations (C max ) and time to reach maximum acetaminophen concentration (T max ) were observed. Nonlinear regression findings revealed a longer acetaminophen half-time (AAP t 1/2 ) in diarrheic calves compared to healthy calves [564 \u00b1 96 min vs. 393 \u00b1 84 min, respectively; P = 0.04] and lower area under the concentration curve values (e.g., 60 min postprandial AUC 60 681 \u00b1 244 (\u00b5g\u2022min)/mL vs. 1064 \u00b1 23 (\u00b5g\u2022min)/mL, respectively; P = 0.04). In conclusion, abomasal luminal conditions were different between diarrheic and healthy calves. Significant differences in APAT reflected a delay in abomasal emptying in diarrheic calves. Impaired abomasal movement may induce enhanced bacterial fermentation processes as indicated by a higher abomasal temperature in diarrheic calves, which should be considered in management of their feeding.",

            "text": "Neonatal diarrhea is the main cause of death during the first 2 weeks of life in calves (Torsein et al., 2014) . Furthermore, diarrhea results in poor growth performance and increases the susceptibility to other infections (Windeyer et al., 2014) . Kirchner et al. (2015) recently reported that neonatal diarrhea affects abomasal motility, which consequently delays the abomasal emptying rate (AER) after milk intake. Impaired abomasal motility may increase bacterial fermentation and the production of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) (Nouri and Constable, 2006) , and luminal temperature may rise as a result of bacterial fermentation. The production of SCFAs contributes to the inhibition of abomasal motility by affecting chemoreceptors in the abomasal epithelium (Leek, 1977; Crichlow and Leek, 1986; Crichlow, 1988) . In addition, growth of gas-producing bacteria such as Clostridium perfringens, Sarcina ventriculi, and Lactobacillus spp. is considered to be a predisposing factor for abomasal tympany (Marshall, 2009) . SCFAs have been found to impair the sodium transport system of the gastric mucosa of equines under in vitro conditions (Nadeau et al., 2003) , leading to an osmotic influx of water into the cells and swelling and degradation of the mucosa (Argenzio, 1999; Carney et al., 1981) . Abomasal conditions can be characterized by several intraluminal parameters such as pH, temperature, and abomasal pressure. As previously described, intraluminal pH is determined by invasive methods such as cannulation or through post-mortem study (Bachmann et al., 2009; Constable et al., 2009) . A noninvasive wireless ambulatory capsule (WAC) for intraluminal pH, pressure, and temperature measurements has been already described in ponies (Stokes et al., 2012) , dogs (Boillat et al., 2010) , and humans (Koziolek et al., 2015) . To our knowledge, noninvasive WAC measurements have not been described in calves. To investigate the AER, a variety of methods have been used, such as the acetaminophen absorption test (APAT, Constable et al., 2009 ), D-xylose absorption test (Wittek et al., 2005a (Wittek et al., , 2005b , scintigraphic evaluation (Marshall et al., 2005) , and ultrasonographic measurements (Sen et al., 2006; Wittek et al., 2005a) . In particular, the APAT has been evaluated as an appropriate nonradioactive method in cows (Wittek et al., 2009 ), heifers (Ehsani-Kheradgerdi et al., 2011 , and healthy calves Marshall et al., 2005; Sen et al., 2006) . Acetaminophen (AAP) is absorbed in the proximal small intestine (Prescott, 1980) , and it serves as an accurate parameter of gastric (Snyder et al., 2014) or abomasal emptying in healthy animals (Marshall et al., 2005; Nouri and Constable, 2006; Sen et al., 2006) . However, to our knowledge data about diarrheic calves and the AER are lacking.",

All capsules (13 mm \u00d7 26 mm) were calibrated with a buffer solution containing citric acid (pH 6.0) and activated by the appropriate software tool (MotiliGI, SmartPill Corp). The pH, temperature and pressure sensors in the WAC send data at 434 MHz and, according to the manufacturer's information, the WAC measures pH from 0.5 to 9.0 pH units with an accuracy of \u00b1 0.5 units; pressure from 0 to 350 mmHg with an accuracy of \u00b1 5 mmHg; and temperature from 25 to 49\u00b0C with accuracy of \u00b1 1\u00b0C. In the case of pressure, the software provided a baseline correction. In our study we used the temperature compensated data as these data considered real values measured in the animal (Koziolek et al., 2015) . The capsule was administered to the calves with a modified pill applicator before feeding them the milk replacer. A data receiver was fixed on the left side of each calf with an elastic bandage (CoFlex Vet, Andover). The successful placement of the capsule into the abomasum was verified by ultrasonographic imaging using a 3.5-Hz sector probe (A6Vet Sonoscape, Sonoring, see Supplementary file 1) 30 min after WAC application and afterwards at 60-min intervals for at least 12 h after milk intake. Approximately every 30 s the integrated antenna of the WAC sent pH, temperature, and pressure sensor information to the receiver. According to the manufacturer's information, the pH sensor took measurements every 5 s in a range of 0.5-9 units with an accuracy of \u00b1 0.5 units. The temperature was measured every 20 s in a range from 25 to 49\u00b0C, with an accuracy of \u00b1 1\u00b0C. Pressure data were taken at a frequency of 2 Hz in a range from 0 to 350 mm Hg ( \u00b1 5 mm Hg). The pressure data are expressed in kilopascals. Artificial pressure peaks due to manipulations of the examiner were marked by pressing the 'Event' button on the data receiver. These data were excluded from the statistics. 90% of the collected data were measured during a lying position of the calf.",

The time to pH < 2 was not significantly different in healthy or diarrheic calves. However, times to pH < 2 have been confirmed by other studies in calves fed milk replacer (Sen et al., 2006) . It must be emphasized that pH variations depend on the location of the WAC in the abomasum. WACs that are close to the abomasal wall are primarily located in whey and probably experience lower pH values than WACs located in the middle of the chyme, particularly in the curd formation. Furthermore, McLauchlan et al. (1989) found pH differences in the gastric body and antrum in humans due to varied buffering effects of the chyme. The WAC presence in the abomasum was always confirmed by ultrasonography, but the exact location of the WAC in each term was not documented in our study. However, the WAC can be speculated to have been close to the abomasal mucosa in the xiphoidal region given the similar pH trends during the observation period in both groups. Related to the location of the WAC, pH measurements may reflect continuous hydrochloric acid production by the parietal cells of the mucosa and the acidification by the whey. In that context, Constable et al. (2005) reported lower pH values after the intake of cow's milk, which was either a result of the clotting process by the extrusion of low whey pH or by a fast AER, among other possibilities. In the present study, AER was delayed in diarrheic calves, and therefore the location of the WAC in the acidifying whey near the abomasal mucosa might be a possible explanation. The low temperatures at the beginning of the observation period were probably related to the low temperature of the milk fed to the calves, but the abomasal temperature increased within the first 3 h after milk intake. Afterward, the mean abomasal temperature was higher than the mean rectal temperature in both groups. However, the abomasal temperature of diarrheic calves steadily increased until a mean maximum temperature of 39.6\u00b0C was reached 9 h postprandial. Higher temperatures were found in diarrheic calves than in healthy calves 7 h after milk replacer intake. One explanation for the higher intraluminal temperatures might be related to fermentation processes in the abomasum. In that context pH-tolerant mucosa-associated Lactobacilli ssp. were recently found by Hund et al. (2014) in the abomasum in calves. One consequence of bacterial fermentation is the production of SCFAs. SCFAs were reported to cause cell edema by interrupting the sodium transport under in vitro conditions in horse gastric tissue (Nadeau et al., 2003) . A similar impairment of the sodium transport might also occur in the abomasum; however, data are lacking in the calf. If cell edema impairs the functionality of the abomasal movement, it may lead to delayed abomasal emptying. In addition, we detected pathogens such as Cryptosporidium parvum, Rota virus, and Corona virus in all diarrheic calves, and these pathogens are known for their mucosainjuring potential (Tzipori, 1983; Tzipori et al., 1983) .",

The AAP half-time was nearly 3 h faster in healthy calves (393 \u00b1 84 min) than in diarrheic calves (564 \u00b1 96 min). However, no significant differences in C max and T max were observed between the two groups of calves. The AUC values of diarrheic calves were about 25% lower compared to those of healthy calves, which could also be explained by malabsorption processes in the small intestine. More severely injured small intestine might alter AAP indices more noticeably. A validation of APAT with other methods of assessment (scintigraphy, ultrasonography) is necessary.",

Based on the second finding that WAC was not transported from the abomasum into the small intestine within 24 days after application, the capsule might offer a new therapy tool in applying drugs with a constant flow of agents (e.g. buffering substances or trace elements such as selenium for calves on pasture) over several days or weeks.",
