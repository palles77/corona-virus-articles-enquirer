Although there are multiple reports of ECoV outbreaks, less is known about the clinical presentation of individual horses during a nonoutbreak situation. The purpose of this study was to describe the clinical presentation of horses diagnosed with ECoV infection that were not associated with an outbreak. Medical records of all horses admitted to Washington State University, Veterinary Teaching Hospital, during an 8year period were reviewed (2010e2018). The five horses included in this study were older than 1 year of age, were diagnosed with colitis, tested positive for ECoV using real-time polymerase chain reaction, and were negative to other enteric pathogens. Interestingly, 4 of 5 horses had moderate to severe diarrhea, 3 had abnormal large colon ultrasonography, 2 had transient ventricular tachycardia and 2 had clinicopathologic evidence of liver dysfunction. ECoV should be included as a differential diagnosis for individual horses presenting with anorexia, fever, lethargy, and colitis. Early identification of ECoV cases is key to implement appropriate biosecurity measures to prevent the potential spread of this disease.",

Lactate measurements were performed using a stall side analyzer (Lactate Plus Nova; Medical Innovation House, Runcorn, Cheshire, UK).

Abnormal ultrasound of the large colon has been previously reported with this infection [4] . Abnormalities of clinical relevance at admission included tachycardia, tachypnea, and hyperlactatemia likely the result of hemoconcentration and/or endotoxemia [2e4, 7, 13, 15] . These changes, associated with the observed leukopenia, characterized by left shift, neutropenia and lymphopenia as well as hyperfibrinogenemia, are consistent with an acute inflammatory disease process and are commonly seen with colitis and have been previously reported in ECoV cases [2e4, 7, 8] . The increase in total serum bilirubin observed in our cases is likely the result of anorexia [16, 17] .",

Secondary complications included transient ventricular tachycardia (2), hepatic lipidosis (1), and hepatobiliary dysfunction (1). Hepatic lipidosis was diagnosed on a Miniature Horse gelding based on increased liver enzymes (SDH 46 U/L, normal range 4e17 U/L; GGT 92 U/L, normal range 14e40 U/L; ALP 722 U/L, normal range 75e245 U/L), increased bile acids (17 mmol/L, normal range 0e10 umnol/L) and increased triglycerides (198 mg/dL, normal range 8e51 mg/dL) during hospitalization. Plasma ammonia in this case remained normal (14 mmol/L, normal range 1e50 mmol/L). Hepatobiliary dysfunction was diagnosed in an Arabian gelding based on increased liver enzymes (GGT 202 U/L, ALP 697 U/L, and SDH 34) and bile acids (15 mmol/L) during hospitalization. Patients",
