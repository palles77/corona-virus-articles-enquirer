            "text": "Viruses are tiny organisms that may cause a number of diseases in eukaryotes. They are quite diverse and different from other biological entities. Some viruses have RNA genomes and some have DNA genomes. Some viruses have single-stranded genomes, whereas others have multiple-stranded genomes. The structures and replication strategies are also quite different. 1, 2 Due to the high diversity of viruses, the corresponding classification problem is complicated. The International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV) defined a universal taxonomic scheme for all the viruses. According to the ICTV scheme, viral classification starts at the highest level of order and continues as follows: order, family, subfamily, genus, and species. Another main scheme used for the classification of viruses is the Baltimore classification system. 3 Based on their nucleic acid, strandedness (single-stranded or double-stranded), and methods of replication, viruses are divided into the following 7 groups: dsDNA, ssDNA, dsRNA, ssRNA-RT, (+)ssRNA, (\u2212) ssRNA, and dsDNA-RT.",

They continually threaten human's life. Nowadays, scientists are able to study the nucleotide sequences of viruses and develop algorithms to classify and predict the characteristics of new viruses. One major approach is to analyze the similarity between the new viruses and known ones. Multiple sequence alignment (MSA) has been widely accepted and used by biologists and virologists now. However, its heavy computational cost causes serious inefficiency, which makes it impossible to analyze the phylogeny of whole genomes. Besides, MSA methods may fail in diverse systems of different families of RNA viruses. Meantime, different evolutionary models can lead to different results, which implies that the models and assumptions are unnatural and unpersuasive. Another popular category of alignment-free methods is based on the statistics of oligomers frequency and associated with a fixed-length segment, known as k-mers. However, it ignores the positional information of nucleotides.",

In 2011, we applied natural vector to cluster H1N1 genomes and reported as significant results in dendrogram, which coincided with biologists' analyses in the work by Deng et al. 9 We also predict that the A(H1N1) genomes are originally from swine flu virus genome lineage, which shows the direction toward how to resist the threat of the new influenza; in 2013, we also proposed 12-dimensional natural vectors for classifying all single-segmented viruses (DNA and RNA genomes) which broadened the range of natural vector. 8 Among the 7 Baltimore classes, the error rates of classifying Baltimore labels were below 0.01% for Baltimore I, II, IV, V, and VII, and the error rates of classifying family labels were 0 for Baltimore II, III, V, VI, and VII. After validating with the published references, we successfully predicted 21 missing labels of viruses. In the work by Huang et al, 10 we extended the natural vector approach to include multiple-segmented viruses by introducing Hausdorff metric in the GenBank at that time. The error rates of the predictions of 2384 viruses were 3.5% for Baltimore labels, 4.6% for family labels, 0.3% for subfamily labels, and 4.4% for genus labels. We also analyzed the influenza A(H7N9) virus whose genome consists of 8 segments and drew the conclusion that the analysis based on whole genomes through Hausdorff distance is more reliable than the classical one based only on 2 segments, which proves that our method performs well in multiple-segmented viruses. In 2015, we applied natural vectors on Ebola viruses of the 2014 outbreak. 11 The accuracy rates on classifying family and genus labels were 100%. Our phylogenetic analysis showed that a protein named VP24 is the most consistent one to the variation of virulence among the 7 proteins related to Ebola viruses, which suggests that VP24 would be a pharmaceutical target for preventing and treating Ebola virus. As natural vector can reflect core information stored in sequences and genomes, we use it to construct the virus classification system introduced in this article.",

Apache http server, the most widely adopted web server, is used to serve both general public and internal administrators. WordPress has been adopted as the presentation layer. PHP is used as the scripting language for the Web application development. ",

The users are inquired to choose either single segment or multiple segments of the viruses. With a little instruction beginning with a symbol \">\" on the first line (which is similar to FASTA file), they can submit a nucleotide sequence with or without the Baltimore and family labels. If no label is chosen, the calculation would be done in the whole database and the prediction of which Baltimore class and family it belongs to would be made. If the sequence and Baltimore class label are submitted, but without a family label, the calculation will be done within the Baltimore class, and then the prediction of whether the query virus is in the Baltimore class or not would be made. If the family label is also submitted, then the system would predict whether it is in the family or not. As soon as the system receives a request with the verification code to ensure human requiring rather than attack from a malicious hacker, it will calculate the corresponding natural vector as well as the distances between the submitted sequence and the viruses in VirusDB. Besides, when we make a prediction, we set up a cutoff rate of 75%, which means that only when the distance between the reference virus and its nearest neighbor is smaller than 75% of the distances in the family, we will make the prediction that this virus belongs to the same class as its nearest neighbor. In this way, the accuracy rate is dramatically improved up to 90% for the predicted ones. 8 Figure 3 displays the screenshots of the procedure of submission and prediction of a single-segmented virus. It shows that the system successfully predicted a Parvoviridae virus. For a multiple-segmented virus, users can choose \"Multiple Segments\" and upload the corresponding FASTA files to get the results.",

This inspires us to add the proteome information into our system, thus in subsequent version, users can input the proteome and get a prediction result based on genomes and proteomes.
