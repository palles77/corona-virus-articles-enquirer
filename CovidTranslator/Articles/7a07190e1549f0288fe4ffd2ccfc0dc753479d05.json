Every year strains of influenza (type A or B) circulate, giving rise to clinical consultations in primary care (age-specific impact varies by season), episodes of hospital treatment (mainly in older persons and young children, but occasionally in working age adults), and deaths (mainly in the elderly). Treatment in primary care and hospital may be required due to the direct effects of influenza virus infection or its possible complications, most commonly secondary bacterial pneumonia. Increases in GP consultations for influenza-like illness and winter bed pressures are frequently associated with periods of known community influenza activity 6 . Pandemic influenza occurs when a new influenza A virus subtype emerges which is markedly different from recently circulating subtypes and strains, and is able to: \u2022 infect humans; \u2022 spread efficiently from person to person; \u2022 cause significant clinical illness in a high proportion of those infected. Because the virus is novel in humans, a high proportion of the population will have little or no immunity, producing a large pool of susceptible persons; accordingly the disease spreads widely and rapidly.",

In adults, the illness typically presents as an abrupt onset of fever accompanied by a range of other symptoms as listed in Box 3.2 [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] . Fever is the paramount symptom and may reach 41\u00baC although more usually it ranges between 38\u00baC and 40\u00baC. The peak occurs within 24 hours of onset and lasts typically for three days (range 1 5 days) [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] . The cough is generally dry although in up to 40% of cases it may be productive. A productive cough together with chest tightness and substernal soreness is more common in patients with underlying chronic lung disease. Myalgia affects mainly the back and limbs. Gastrointestinal symptoms such as vomiting and diarrhoea are uncommon (<10%) in adults. Abdominal pain is rare. Clinical findings include a toxic appearance in the initial stages, hot and moist skin, a flushed face, injected eyes and hyperaemic mucous membranes around the nose and pharynx. Tender cervical lymphadenopathy is found in a minority (~10%) of cases. Wheezing or lung crackles are recognised findings (~10%) more commonly noted in patients with coexisting chronic lung disease. Although the overall clinical picture of uncomplicated influenza in any specific age group is similar for different influenza A subtypes, the frequency of certain symptoms may vary. For instance, during the 'Asian' pandemic of 1957 (H2N2), headache and sore throat were frequent initial symptoms 30 . In uncomplicated infection, the illness usually resolves in seven days although cough, malaise and lassitude may persist for weeks.",

As case numbers rise, possibly to pandemic levels, full or indeed any microbiological investigation will become increasingly difficult. Thus, data on the relative frequency of different bacterial causes of influenza-related pneumonia and their antimicrobial susceptibilities amongst investigated cases gathered earlier in the pandemic should be available to guide and refine empirical antimicrobial therapy choices for cases occurring later in the pandemic. The most likely pathogens implicated in influenzarelated pneumonia are Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, Haemophilus influenzae and to a lesser extent b-haemolytic streptococci (see Section 3.3). In the early phases (UK alert levels 1, 2 and 3 see Appendix 1) of a pandemic, microbiological diagnostic approaches should focus on confirming influenza as the primary illness, defining bacterial causes of influenza-related pneumonia, and optimizing both specific (for individual patients) and general (for populations) antimicrobial treatment recommendations. In later pandemic phases (UK alert level 4) with the much higher caseloads anticipated, microbiological investigation should be focused on patients with severe influenza-related pneumonia unresponsive to empirical antimicrobial therapy. Actual and practical local level transition to less intense microbiological investigation may occur at UK alert level 3 in some regions as the number of local cases is likely to vary between regions. \u00a711.

Staphylococcus aureus is widely resistant to penicillin 109 and an increasing number are now methicillin-resistant (MRSA); when occurring in the community this generally reflects hospitalisation within the recent past or residence within a nursing home 110 . Hence, b-lactamase unstable penicillins (penicillin G, aminopenicillins) and, in the case of MRSA, isoxazolyl penicillins (flucloxacillin, cloxacillin) and cephalosporins, are inappropriate for such infections. The true incidence of resistance among pathogens in the community is difficult to estimate since most laboratory samples come from selected populations. With this limitation in mind, the presence of b-lactamase production among H. influenzae varies geographically but ranges from 2% to 17% 111, 112 in various parts of the UK.

However, it is important that the situation is monitored and in future \u00a714. Use of antibiotics in hospitalised adults Part 2. Clinical management of adults referred to hospital Pandemic flu. Clinical management of patients with an influenza-like illness during an influenza pandemic S37 either ciprofloxacin 400 mg bd IV or piperacillin 4 g tds IV \u00b1 gentamicin or tobramycin (dose monitoring) higher doses of penicillins or alternative regimens may need to be considered. Staphylooccus aureus is an uncommon cause of sporadic community-acquired pneumonia in the UK, but will assume much greater potential importance during a pandemic. Most community isolates are methicillin-sensitive although the recent increase in MRSA in hospitalised patients may result in subsequent readmission with an MRSA infection, secondary to influenza. Options for methicillin-sensitive and -resistant infections are based on parenteral administration in view of the serious nature of staphylococcal pneumonia.",

Its conclusions were therefore the same with respect to median illness duration in healthy children.

Vomiting was significantly more common among oseltamivir recipients than placebo recipients (15% vs. 9%). The review noted that there may be a difference in efficacy according to serotype, with oseltamivir showing a significant reduction in time to resolution for influenza A (34%) but not B (8.5%) 155 . With respect to children with asthma there was a trend to reduction in time to freedom from illness for oseltamivir recipients but this did not reach statistical significance. Oseltamivir appeared to result in a more rapid improvement in pulmonary function, and was well tolerated in children with asthma 155, 156 . The Cochrane review concluded that oseltamivir was the preferred drug as it has shown a benefit with regard to secondary complications.

This is particularly important because during epidemic years, of all children with influenza, it is children under six months of age who are most likely to be hospitalised 159 . The basis for this exclusion appears to be that rat data have shown high mortality in infant rats at seven days of age when given a dose of 1000 mg/kg together with high brain levels of oseltamivir, assumed to reflect the immature blood brain barrier at this age. This is reflected in product literature and an FDA alert although there are no published data. As a result, there are few human data in this age group as it was felt that it would be difficult to monitor CNS toxicity in this age group.

            "text": "The first recorded instance of human infection by avian influenza H5N1 occurred in May 1997 in Hong Kong. The first patient was a 3-year old child who presented initially with symptoms of fever, sore throat and abdominal pain. He later developed Reye's syndrome, ARDS, multi-organ failure and eventually died 166 . A total of 18 persons were subsequently infected before the outbreak ended in December 1997 126, 167 . Half the patients were aged 18 years and below and only two were aged over 50 years. Abdominal symptoms, such as diarrhoea, vomiting and abdominal pain, were described in ten (56%) patients. Eleven (61%) had a severe illness characterised by pneumonia occurring within 14 days of symptom onset, lymphopenia, deranged liver function tests and a high mortality [six (55%) of 11 patients with pneumonia]. Secondary bacterial infections were not identified as the cause of the pneumonias.The most recent human outbreak of influenza A (H5N1) infection began in December 2003. The clinical features of hospitalised patients infected by the re-emergent avian influenza A (H5N1) in 2004 were similar to those described in patients in 1997 (Table A10 .1). Children and young adults were the main groups affected. Gastrointestinal symptoms were common. The presence of lymphopenia and deranged liver function tests was again associated with a poorer prognosis 125 .Since December 2003, over 150 cases had been reported to the WHO 168 . The mortality rate among hospitalised patients has been generally high (>40%). Death has occurred an average of ten days after the onset of illness and most patients have died of progressive respiratory failure.There has been a review of avian influenza A (H5N1) infection in humans up until September 2005 55 .
