            "text": "Background: With advent of molecular diagnostic technologies, studies have reported detection of two or more respiratory viruses in about 30% of children with respiratory infections. However, prognostic role of coinfection remains unclear. Objective: Evaluate relation between respiratory viral confection and illness severity in children. Study design: MEDLINE (through PUBMED), EMBASE, EBSCO, LILACS databases were searched up to March 2015 by two independent reviewers. Studies assessing severity of viral coinfection in patients aged less than 18 years were included. Standardized forms were used for data extraction of population, study design, clinical syndromes, virus combinations compared and severity outcomes. Risk of bias and quality of evidence were assessed through EPHPP and GRADE. Subgroup analysis was performed according to age and viral combinations. Results: Of 5218 records screened, 43 were included in analysis. Viral coinfection did not influence risks of all outcomes assessed: length of stay (mean difference in days in coinfection, \u22120.10 [95% confidence interval: \u22120.51 to 0.31]), length of supplemental oxygen (\u22120.42 [\u22121.05 to 0.20]), need of hospitalization (odds ratio of coinfection, 0.96 [95% confidence interval: 0.61-1.51]), supplemental oxygen (0.94 [0.66 to 1.34]), need of intensive care (0.99 [0.64 to 1.54]), mechanical ventilation (0.81 [0.33 to 2.01]) and death (2.22 [0.83 to 5.95]). Sub-analyses according to age and viral combinations have not shown influence of these factors in outcomes. Conclusions: Respiratory viral coinfection did not increase severity in all outcomes assessed. Further studies are necessary to confirm this finding, especially regarding role of specific viral interactions.",

Viral detection techniques have greatly improved in recent years, as the use of molecular diagnostic tests has importantly increased the ability to identify respiratory viruses in children with ARI [3] . Until recently, infection by two or more viral agents concomitantly, in infants and toddlers, was considered an unusual event. However, as these new diagnostic techniques became more readily available in clinical settings, studies have been showing a much higher prevalence of respiratory coinfection [4] . In most of reports, detection of two or more respiratory virus simultaneously ranges from 10 to 30% in pediatric patients [5] [6] [7] . In reports that analyzed respiratory infections by nucleic acid amplification techniques assessing a large number of viruses, such prevalence is higher than 40% [8] [9] [10] .",

Main aspects considered for classification are selection bias, study design, confounders, blinding, data collection methods and withdrawals and drop-outs. Overall quality of evidence for all outcomes assessed was done according to GRADE guidelines (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation) [22] . As interventional studies to evaluate severity of viral coinfection are not possible, observational studies were considered the highest level of evidence for all outcomes. The overall levels were downgraded according detection of risk of bias, inconsistency, indirectness and imprecision. Inconsistency was considered serious when substantial heterogeneity was detected (I 2 greater than 50% or P < 0.01). Serious indirectness was detected when most of studies compared a specific viral combination rather than all coinfections versus all single infections. Imprecision was considered when optimal information size was not met and/or a wide 95% confidence interval (CI) was detected. Disagreements between the review authors over the quality of evidence and risk of bias were resolved by a third reviewer.",

For studies reporting multiple comparisons of virus combinations, all patients and events were joined if such procedure did not carry risk of including the same patients twice. For situations in which such risk was detected and for continuous outcomes, only combination with the largest number of patients was included in meta-analysis. Statistical heterogeneity was measured using I 2 test. Although serious heterogeneity was regarded as a sign of low quality of evidence, additional sub-groups analysis was considered necessary a priori regardless of heterogeneity. Random effect model were used for pooled OR and MD calculations. If basic required data on results were not presented (e.g.: measures of central tendency) and attempt to contact authors were not successful, the study was excluded from analysis. For articles that presented continuous variable as median, the standard deviation (SD) was calculated from interquartile range (IQ) dividing it by 1.35 if the sample size was considered large and the distribution of the outcome was similar to the normal distribution. In conditions above were not met, study was excluded from meta-analysis [23] . After preliminary analysis considering all included articles, main analysis was performed with studies including minimal set of viruses mentioned above.

First, the use of molecular biology techniques has demonstrated that viruses may be excreted for a prolonged period, with few or no symptoms [54, 55] . Therefore, some patients labeled as having coinfection may actually be subject of co-detection. Studies assessing viral load in attempt to make such distinction have not shown consistent differences between groups for most viruses [6, 30, 56] . On the other hand, some of these viruses, excreted in otherwise asymptomatic hosts, could enhance overall virulence if another viral infection was to occur. Consequently, it is difficult to rule out the role of even a co-detection in disease severity. Second, the limited possibilities of confirming bacterial etiology in lower respiratory tract infections and, consequently, bacterial-virus coinfection, is still an important challenge in clinical practice [57, 58] . Third, the prognosis of respiratory infections may be modified, to better or worse, by specific viral interactions and virus combinations, as some studies have suggested [9] . Nonetheless, sub-analyses with viruses that may have persistent shedding, bocavirus and adenovirus, and attempt to assess role of especific viral combinations did not change our findings. This analysis was particularly difficult not only because report and comparison of several different combinations across studies. As shown in Table 1 , since many combinations are reported as, for example, \"RSV coinfections\", including all different viruses detected with RSV into a single group, evaluation of specific viral interactions was hampered for most outcomes.",

Both included a mixed population of adults and children, included less studies and had a smaller number of outcomes. The first one included 21 studies and subjects from different age groups and included a subgroup analysis in children; risk of hospitalization was not assessed. They found no association between viral coinfection and length of stay, oxygen requirements, admission to PICU and need of mechanical ventilation [59] . They found a higher mortality risk in preschool children, which was not consistent with our results and previous studies [41, 46] . The second systematic review with mixed adult-children population included 19 studies, and reported an overall increase in risk of hospitalization in patients with two or more viruses detected, but there was not a subgroup analysis only with children for this outcome [60] . Besides of a search that ended more than two years later, some methodological reasons seem to account for the differences of those two studies with ours. First, they used less strict criteria for inclusion in meta-analysis and analysis was done including studies with a smaller number of viruses than those we assessed. We pooled studies including at least RSV, influenza, adenovirus, parainfluenza, rhinovirus and metapneumovirus, due to their virulence and prevalence, in an attempt to avoid a measurement bias.",
