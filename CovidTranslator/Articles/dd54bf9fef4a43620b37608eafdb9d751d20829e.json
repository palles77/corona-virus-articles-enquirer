BRV and BEV are antigenically related to each other but no cross-reactivity with antisera against other animal viruses could be detected (2). Although the peplomers on the envelope of the new viruses resembled those of coronaviruses, the unique nucleocapsid morphology and morphogenesis of BRV (3) and BEV (4, 5) justified their classification as representatives of a new group of animal RNA viruses, the toroviruses (6, 7). same basic gene order: 5'-polymerase-spike proteinmembrane protein-nucleocapsid protein-3' (Fig. 2A) . Nucleotide sequence analysis of (parts of) the polymerase genes of the coronaviruses infectious bronchitis virus (IBV; (13)) and mouse hepatitis virus (MHV; (14) ) and the torovirus BEV (15) has revealed that their predicted polymerase proteins contain several homologous domains (15). Furthermore, their polymerase genes consist of two large open reading frames (ORFs) of which the more downstream one (ORFI b) is expressed through ribsomal frameshifting (14-16).",

Moreover, two of the three structural BEV proteins are thought to be related to coronaviral structural proteins. The BEV peplomer (P) and the coronaviral spike (S) protein are post-translationally cleaved, N-glycosylated proteins of similar size. Although no linear protein sequence similarity was detected, their disposition in the viral membrane and their tertiary structure are predicted to be analogous; for both proteins dimerization, probably leading to the formation of the distinctive club-shaped spikes, has been demonstrated (11). The structural characteristics of the BEV envelope (E) and coronaviral membrane (M) proteins are also strikingly similar: they are triple-spanning 25K-30K membrane proteins with comparable membrane topologies (J. A. den Boon et a/., submitted). The small BEV nucleocapsid (N) protein (18.3K; (IO)), on the other hand, seems to have little in common with its much larger (45K-50K; (12)) coronaviral counterpart.

Homologous recombination between highly similar RNA sequences has been found to occur during the multiplication of a number of plant and animal RNA viruses (19) (20) (21) (22) (23) (24) (25) (26) . Nonhomologous RNA recombination events (i.e., the incorporation of heterologous RNA sequences) have been advocated, e.g., to explain the presence of tRNA sequences in alphaviral defective interfering RNAs (27) . Undisputed examples of nonhomologous recombination in infectious (nonretroviral) RNA virus genomes have been described only recently (28) (29) (30) . One of these recombinations (28) involves the gene which encodes the hemagglutinin esterase (HE) protein of influenza virus C (IVC). Proteins with remarkable sequence similarity to the IVC hemagglutinin HE1 subunit are encoded by genes of murine (MHV) and bovine (BCV) coronaviruses (28, 31, 32) . Because such a gene is lacking in the genomes of coronaviruses from other antigenic clusters (e.g., IBV; Fig. 2A ), a heterologous recombination event involving and IVC-like virus and an ancestral coronavirus was postulated to explain the presence of an HE gene in MHV and BCV (28) .",

It is remarkable that, in addition to the evidence for common ancestry presented above, also these recombinations associate toroviruses with coronaviruses. Figure 1 shows the previously unreported nucleotide sequence of BEV ORF 4, which is located between the E and N protein genes ((9); see also Fig. 2A) . The protein encoded by this ORF (Fig. 1) shows sequence similarity to the C-terminal parts of the coronaviral HE protein and the IVC HE1 subunit (Fig. 2B) . However, the ORF 4 product consists of only 142 amino acids (aa), whereas both the coronaviral HE protein and the IVC HE1 subunit are more than 400 aa in length. The sequence of the ORF 4 product shares 30-35% identical amino acid residues with both the IVC and the MHV/ BCV HE sequences. The predicted BEV product contains a hydrophobic C-terminus, but lacks the catalytic center of the acetylesterase which is located in the N-terminal part of the protein (33) . Five cysteine residues in the C-terminus of the HE protein which are conserved between IVC and coronaviruses (34) are also found in the BEV sequence (Fig. 26) . Possibly, the 5' part of BEV ORF 4 has been removed by a recent deletion event which did not inactivate the RNA 4 transcription initiation site (9). The first ORF 4 AUG codon would in this case not be the \"original\" translation initiation codon. This hypothesis is supported by the fact that the similarity with the IVC sequence and, to a lesser extent, the coronaviral sequence continues upstream of the present ORF 4 starting methionine residue (Fig. 28) .",

The IVC HE1 subunit derives from cleavage of a HEl-HE2 precursor at an internal stretch of hydrophobic amino acid residues (35) . Neither the BEV ORF 4 product nor the coronaviral HE protein contains sequences which are homologous to the IVC HE2 subunit. Instead they possess a very hydrophobic C-terminus which may represent the result of an adaptation of the hydrophobic HE2 N-terminus to become a membrane anchor. Though independent recombination events cannot be excluded, the presence of the same C-terminal adaptation in the proteins of both MHV/BCV and BEV lends some credibility to a recombination involving the ancestors of these viruses. Either a coronavirus or a torovirus may have been involved in the initial recombination with IVC.",

Apparently, a sequence related to the 5' two-thirds of this coronaviral ns gene, which is expressed from a separate subgenomic mRNA in MHV-and BCV-infected ceils, has been integrated into BEV ORFl a and is now expressed as a part of the BEV polymerase. The expression of the MHV ns30K protein in infected cells has recently been studied (37) but no information about its role in viral replication has been obtained. The suggestion that the ns3OK protein contains a nucleotide binding motif (28) is opposed by the lack of conservation of this postulated MHV domain in BCV and BEV (Fig. 2C) .",

The ORFl a sequence of IBV has been determined completely (13) but from the C-terminal region of the MHV ORFI a product only about 100 aa are known (14). Also these C-terminal ORFl a polymerase sequences of IBV and MHV are highly similar (Fig. 2D ). In addition, a small domain of sequence similarity with the C-terminal part of the BEV ORFla product was identified ( Figs. 2A and 2D ). This similarity is reminiscent of the homologous polymerase domains which were identified in the ORFlb products of toro-and coronaviruses (15).

Although it is difficult to reconstruct the sequence of events which resulted in the present genome organization of viruses like BEV, IBV, and MHV ( Fig. 2A) , it is clear that nonhomologous RNA recombination has played an important role in their evolution. Apparently, both an ancestor of MHV/BCV and an ancestral torovirus have acquired homologous protein sequences as the result of independent recombination events; the HE and ns30/32K genes are lacking in other coronavi-ruses (which excludes divergent evolution) and the corresponding BEV sequences are located at different positions in the genome ( Fig. 2A) . Considering the fact that several present-day representatives of both virus groups cause enteric infections, direct recombination between toro-and coronaviruses during coinfection of the same cell seems feasible.

Filled boxes indicate homologous domains in the polymerase proteins of toro-and coronaviruses. The hatched (ns) and cross-hatched (ORF 4 / HE) areas indicate the position of \"recombinant\"",
