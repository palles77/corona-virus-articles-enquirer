Prey. Vet. Med., Associations between heifer calf management and mortality were studied on 104 randomly selected Holstein dairy farms in southwestern Ontario between October 1980 and July 1983. At the farm level, data were stratified by season, with two six-month seasons (winter and summer) per year. The odds of farms with particular management strategies having above-median morbidity were calculated. At the individual calf level, the odds of a calf being treated, controlling for farm of origin and month of birth, were calculated for different management practices.",

Most of these studies suffered from one or more serious design or analytical flaws. These were addressed earlier (Waltner-Toews et al., 1986a) . In all fairness, however, it should be pointed out that no practical field study is likely to be ideal, in a statistical or epidemiological sense. Nevertheless the constraints of various studies need to be taken into account when interpreting the results. For dairy farmers in southwestern Ontario, the chief drawback of studies done elsewhere is that it is not known to what extent, if at all, findings from California, or even Michigan, are applicable to the Ontario situation.",

Data were collected from all farms over a two and one-half year period between 1980 and 1983.

Winter 1 was slightly truncated to allow time for all farmers to become accustomed to the record-keeping system. Rates were calculated as (number of heifer calves died) \u00f7 (number of live-born heifer calves) for each time period. The distribution of these mortality rates was shown previously to follow a non-normal (non-Gaussian) pattern (Waltner-Toews et al., 1986a) . In each time period, the median mortality rate was zero, while the mean was around 6%. It was therefore deemed appropriate, both from a statistical and a practical viewpoint, to divide farms into those experiencing mortality and those not experiencing mortality. Also, all predictor variables considered, except for FARM SIZE, were binary or categorical in nature. Statistical analyses were carried out using stepwise multiple logistic regression to search for management variables which might distinguish the two groups of farms (Kleinbaum et al., 1982) . Some variables, such as those concerned with whether or not hutches were moved between calves, or whether or not indoor calf pens were in an air space separate from the adult cows, only applied to particular subsets of farms. These were analyzed by means of two-way tables, stratified by year, with differences tested by chi-square or Fisher's Exact test.",

These differences have been attributed to various factors, including housing factors, general management practices, and owner age and experience. A FARM SIZE effect, independent of other management factors (such as seen in this study), suggests that some other factors, perhaps related to crowding or contamination, have not been measured. Also, effects predicted by various herd immunity models could be expected to contribute to a farm size effect, namely, the larger the pool of susceptible animals, the longer potentially pathogenic organisms can perpetuate themselves and the more likely they are to spread (Yorke et al., 1979) . Finally, the possbility that this effect is, at least in part, an artifact of the analytical methods used cannot be ruled out. Given a constant probability of dying, larger farms would have been more likely to experience some mortality, and hence would have been classified above the median. Bowman et al. (1977) reported no difference in calf mortality on farms where calves had extra teats removed before first lactation versus those where they were removed later. The increased odds of experiencing abovemedian summer mortality on farms in this study that removed extra teats at four weeks to weaning (Table I) is consistent with similar patterns seen for calf morbidity (Waltner-Toews et al., 1986b) . It is possible that farmers who waited until the calves were more than four weeks old to remove extra teats were simply neglectful managers. Combined with the manipulative stress itself, this neglectful management may have resulted in the higher calf mortality seen in the four-weeks-to-weaning group. Those farmers who removed teats early and those who removed them later (perhaps after selecting replacements?) would, according to this hypothesis, be better managers. This practice was not evaluated at an individual calf level and hence the above interpretation remains highly speculative.",

The SIRE effect seen in this study supports the hypothesis that there is a genetic component, related to the sire, of calf livability, which is over and above the effect mediated through calving ease, and which extends beyond the immediate perinatal period.

Certainly no effect on mortality has been reported. In this study, farms where farmers had a practice of routinely assisting calves to be suckled, or of supplementing the free-choice suckle, had decreased odds of losing calves (winter mortality) compared with farms where newborn calves were routinely left to suckle on their own. At the individual calf level, however, supplemented or assisted first colostrum feeding was only beneficial to the calf if that calf had required assistance at birth. (This is relative to calves that were assisted at birth but were not supplemented/assisted to receive first colostrum.) 'Naturally' born calves that received assistance or supplementation in first colostrum feeding were more likely to die than calves left on their own. The beneficial effect of assisted feeding after assisted calving, and the beneficial effect of a general farm policy of assisted/supplemented first colostrum feeding, appear biologically plausible. It is possible that the general detrimental effect of supplemented/assisted first colostrum feeding at the individual calf level reflects a situation where calves which receive this assistance are already weak and physically compromised and therefore not only require assistance, but are also more likely to die than strong calves which do not require such assistance. Also, since it is not known whether or not assisted/supplemented calves were fed colostrum in the presence of the dam, a 'dam effect', as described by both Selman et al. (1971) and Stott et al. (1979) , cannot be ruled out. If hand fed (supplemented) calves were usually removed from the presence of the dam for first colostrum feeding, or between feedings, then they might be expected to have achieved lower serum immunoglobulin levels than calves which were left to be suckled.",

In this case, the sparing effect of assisted first colostrum feeding at the farm level reflects the effect of a policy of ensuring that all calves receive first colostrum. This is demonstrated by the fact that the calves which were not assisted (suckle only) on the 'Assist Policy' farms had a higher survival rate than the 'suckle only' calves born to farms where farmers were not so vigilant about first colostrum feeding (No Assist Policy).

Climatic conditions of southwestern Ontario involve heavy snows and below-freezing temperatures for several months in the winter, as well as high humidity and near 30\u00b0C temperatures in the summer. It may therefore be important that the significant decrease in odds of mortality associated with outdoor hutches, and increase associated with group pens, was seen for the summer months only.",

At least two of these studies (Speicher and Hepp, Ferris and Thomas) suggested that farms where the farm-wife cared for the calves had lower mortality than where the farm-husband cared for the calves. While calf rearing personnel did not enter as a significant factor in the final models (i.e. including interaction terms) of mortality on these farms, this variable did appear as significant, for both summer and winter mortality rates, in models which included only main effects. During the summer, farms on which family members other than the owner cared for the calves had significantly greater odds of experiencing mortality than farms where the owner did this work himself (OR=2.8). Farms which used hired help did not differ significantly in odds from those where the owner cared for the calves.",
