Here, we review the full range of antiviral functions of CD4 + T cells, discussing the activities of these cells in helping other lymphocytes and in inducing innate immune responses, as well as their direct antiviral roles.

The differentiation of polarized effector T cells is controlled by unique sets of transcription factors, the expression of which is determined by multiple signals but particularly by soluble factors that act on responding CD4 + T cells during their activation.

Moreover, certain cytokines (for example, IL-10) can be produced by subpopulations of cells within multiple effector subsets. Finally, the successful clearance of viral pathogens in particular often depends on complex CD4 + T cell responses that encompass multiple T H cell subsets. Together, these T cell subsets are capable of mediating direct antiviral functions, of providing help for B cells, of regulating immunopathology and of mediating cytotoxic killing of virus-infected cells. CD4 + T cells with cytotoxic activity have been described in several models of viral disease as well as in the clinic. Following re-stimulation, memory CD4 + T cells retain their previous effector functions and rapidly produce effector cytokines.

Thus, the predominance of T H 1 cells over T H 2 cells during viral infection was somewhat surprising, given the important role of neutralizing antibodies in viral clearance and in providing long-term immunity to re-infection. However, adoptive transfer of either T H 1 cells or T H 2 cells was shown to provide efficient help for the generation of neutralizing antiviral IgG responses 17, 18 . The signature T H 1-type cytokine, IFN\u03b3, enhances IgG2a class switching, and this explains why IgG2a is usually the dominant isotype in IgG responses generated against viruses 19 . In fact, several studies have found that, far from promoting antiviral responses, T H 2 cell-associated mediators (and IL-4 in particular) have a strong negative impact on immune protection and drive immuno pathology during infection with many viruses, including influenza virus 20,21 , respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) 22 , herpes simplex virus (HSV) 23 and vaccinia virus 24 .

The generation of polarized T H 17 cells during viral infection has been correlated with high levels of IL-6 and may also be influenced by transforming growth factor-\u03b2 (TGF\u03b2) 28 . T H 17 cells are implicated in driving harmful inflammation during autoimmunity, and IL-17 may contribute to immunopathology during responses against viruses, as demonstrated in studies using influenza virus or vaccinia virus 27, 29 . However, in some cases, T H 17 cells contribute to host protection against viruses 16 . One protective mechanism mediated by T H 17 cells might be the promotion of enhanced neutrophil responses at sites of infection. IL-17 upregulates CXC-chemokines that promote neutrophil recruitment 30 , and neutrophils can contribute to protection against certain viruses, including influenza virus 31 . We expect that other roles for T H 17 cells will be identified in future studies, as T H 17 cells often produce significant levels of IL-21 and IL-22 in addition to IL-17 (REF. 16 ). Although not extensively studied in viral systems, IL-22 production by T H 17 cells could be involved in regulating the expression of defensins, and could also play an important part in tissue repair (reviewed in REF. 32 ). IL-21 production may also regulate aspects of the innate immune response during viral infection. Moreover, IL-21 is involved in sustaining CD8 + T cell responses during chronic viral infection, as discussed below. ",

Thus, it is crucial to understand the mechanisms by which CD4 + T cells help B cells during viral infection in order to define what is required for effective vaccination (FIG. 2a) . CD4 + T cells that enter B cell follicles and provide help to B cells, resulting in germinal centre formation, are now referred to as T FH cells.

Thus, T FH cells are likely to be important for generating longlived antibody responses and protective immunity to most, if not all, viruses. Indeed, CD4 + T cells have been shown to be required for the generation of optimal antibody responses following infection with coronavirus 39 , vaccinia virus 40 , yellow fever virus 41 or vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) 42 . It is not yet clear how distinct cytokine-polarized CD4 + T cell subsets influence the B cell response during primary viral infection. One possibility is that distinct T H cell subsets, such as T H 1, T H 2 and T H 17 cells, can each develop into T FH cells and provide efficient help for B cells. This hypothesis is supported by a recent study demonstrating that such polarized subsets can be reprogrammed to express T FH cell characteristics in vitro 43 . As different T H cell subsets have been associated with distinct antibody classswitching responses, the broad range of protective antibody isotypes that is often found in individuals with immunity to a virus favours such a model. Several co-stimulatory ligands expressed by CD4 + T cells contribute to the promotion of B cell activation and antibody production. One notable ligand is CD40 ligand (CD40L). Interactions between CD40 (which is expressed on B cells) and CD40L (which is expressed on activated CD4 + T cells) are crucial for generating optimal humoral responses against several viral pathogens, including LCMV, Pichinde virus, VSV, HSV and influenza virus [44] [45] [46] . The expression of inducible T cell costimulator (ICOS) by T FH cells has also been shown to be important for germinal centre formation 34 , and ICOS expression is required for optimal induction of humoral responses against LCMV, VSV and influenza virus 47 . The roles during viral infection of other co-stimulatory molecules expressed by T FH cells are less clear. For example, OX40-deficient mice generate normal levels of class-switched antibodies during infection with LCMV, VSV or influenza virus 48 . Further studies are required to determine the importance of additional signals that pass between T FH cells and B cells in generating protective antibody responses during viral infection.",

As in B cell help, CD40L-CD40 interactions between CD4 + T cells and APCs are crucial (FIG. 2) . One possible mechanism -the 'licensing' of APCs by CD4 + T cells -may be of only minor importance during viral infection, as APCs can be activated effectively by viruses through PRRs 49,50 , thus obviating the need for this process [50] [51] [52] . However, it is unclear whether APCs that are activated directly through PRRs are functionally similar to those licensed by CD4 + T cells 53 . An absence of CD4 + T cells has been shown to compromise the generation of primary cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) responses against vaccinia virus 54 and HSV 55 (and influenza virus in some, but not all, studies [56] [57] [58] ), suggesting that the two modes of APC activation are distinct. Whether CD4 + T cell-mediated help is required for the generation of optimal antiviral CD8 + T cell responses probably depends on which elements of the innate immune response are triggered following infection by a virus and to what extent. For example, the strong type I IFN response that is induced by administration of polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid (polyI:C) can bypass the otherwise obligate requirement for CD4 + T cellmediated help in the generation of CD8 + T cell responses following vaccinia virus infection 59 .",

For example, chemokines produced following antigen-specific interactions between APCs and CD4 + T cells can actively attract CD8 + T cells to the activated APCs 60 , and CD40L-CD40 interactions between CD4 + T cells and APCs can protect APCs from CTL-mediated death 61 , perhaps leading to more-efficient CD8 + T cell priming.",

It is thought that CD8 + T cells that are helped by CD4 + T cells downregulate TRAIL expression and become less susceptible 64 , or have delayed susceptibility 65 , to TRAIL-mediated apoptosis. By contrast, CD8 + T cells that have not been helped undergo enhanced TRAIL-mediated apoptosis following antigen re-exposure. CD4 + T cell-mediated help also controls the expression of other molecules.

Paracrine IL-2 produced by CD4 + T cells during the initial priming of CD8 + T cells in LCMV infection dramatically improves the CD8 + T cell recall response potential 70 . Furthermore, CD4 + T cells have been shown to upregulate the expression of CD25 (also known as IL-2R\u03b1) on CD8 + T cells during infection with vaccinia virus or VSV 71 . At later stages of the response, CD4 + T cells produce additional cytokines, such as IL-21, which appears to be a crucial signal for downregulating TRAIL expression on CD8 + T cells responding to vaccinia virus 72 . Finally, evidence suggests that direct ligation of CD40 on naive CD8 + T cells by CD40L on CD4 + T cells can enhance the generation of memory CD8 + T cells 73 (FIG. 2) .",

A subset of T H 1 cells has been found to transiently produce both IFN\u03b3 and IL-10 at the peak of the effector CD4 + T cell response in many models of infectious disease 99 . Several signals have been found to stimulate the generation of IL-10-producing effector CD4 + T cells, including high levels of antigen, soluble factors such as IL-12 and IL-27, and co-stimulatory signals such as ICOS (reviewed in REF. 99 ). IL-10 is a pleiotropic cytokine that is most often associated with antiinflammatory or inhibitory functions (FIG. 3) . The impact of IL-10 production by effector CD4 + T cells is complicated and can be variable, especially in situations in which strong immune responses (which are capable of serious immunopathology) are required to eliminate a rapidly replicating pathogen. For instance, the absence of IL-10 during influenza virus infection can lead, on the one hand, to improved host survival, owing to enhanced T cell 16 and antibody 100 responses, but also, on the other hand, to exacerbated inflammation and immunopathology, which result in increased mortality 101 . Similarly, ablating Il10 has been found to enhance protection against WNV 102 and vaccinia virus 103 , but to cause increased pathology following infection with RSV 104 and death following infection with mouse hepatitis virus 105 or coronavirus 106 . Finally, as well as producing IL-10 themselves, effector CD4 + T cells can also promote IL-10 production by effector CD8 + T cells during viral infection 107 . ",

Most studies that have assessed the impact of T Reg cells during viral infection have concentrated on models of chronic infection. In such settings, T Reg cells have been found, depending on the particular pathogen, to have both beneficial roles, such as limiting collateral tissue damage, and detrimental roles, including diminishing the overall magnitude of antiviral immune responses 108 . The antigen specificity of T Reg cells in the context of infectious disease has not been addressed often, but it is likely that T Reg cell populations contain at least some virus-specific cells and that these populations are generated in concert with antiviral effector T cell responses. Indeed, this has recently been shown in a coronavirus infection model 109 . The accumulation of virus-specific FOXP3 + T Reg cells during viral infection could be due to the expansion of pre-existing populations of thymus-derived 'natural' T Reg cells that are specific for viral antigens, or could also reflect the de novo generation of 'induced' T Reg cells from naive virus-specific CD4 + T cells. An important factor in the generation of induced T Reg cells appears to be TGF\u03b2 110,111 , although how induced T Reg cells affect viral infection is not yet well understood. For example, some viral pathogens may promote the development of T Reg cell populations to limit the host antiviral response. Evidence for this hypothesis has been found in several models, mainly of chronic viral infection 112, 113 . In acute viral infection, which has not been studied as fully as chronic infection, T Reg cells have been shown to limit pathology during infection with WNV 114 or RSV 115, 116 ",

Tissue-resident memory cells may facilitate more-rapid recruitment and activation of innate cell populations that are capable of controlling initial viral titres. Moreover, these memory cells may simultaneously accelerate the development of pathogen-specific effector populations of B and T cells by promoting the earlier activation of antigen-presenting cells. Elucidating the important cues that drive the development of long-lived tissue-resident memory cells is likely to become an important area of research, especially as this understanding may lead to the design of improved vaccination strategies.",

Also, a recent study by Fahey et al. found that during chronic LCMV infection responding CD4 + T cells progressively adopt a functional T FH cell pheno type 125 . That CD4 + T cells may retain specific functions during chronic infection helps to explain earlier observations that persistent LCMV infection is eventually cleared through mechanisms that are dependent on CD4 + T cells (BOX 2) . For instance, interactions between exhausted CD8 + T cells and CD4 + T cells may restore CD8 + T cell function during chronic infection with LCMV 126 . These findings and others (reviewed in REFS 127, 128) have important implications for the design of vaccines against viruses that cause chronic infection in humans (such as HIV, hepatitis B and hepatitis C).",

The population of CD4 + memory T cells diminishes with time and may require boosting.

In infected tissues, transferred T H 1-type and T H 17-type memory cells, as well as memory CD4 + T cells generated by previous infections, upregulate the expression of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines, including . Activated APCs upregulate their expression of MHC molecules and co-stimulatory molecules, which are important for the priming of naive virus-specific T cells. Triggering of PRRs at the site of infection induces local inflammation, which involves the activation of several populations of innate immune cells that can control viral titres and establish chemokine gradients to attract further antiviral effector cells. The efficiency of PRR triggering can determine whether viral replication or protective immunity gains the upper hand. b | Virus-specific memory CD4 + T cells can directly activate DCs through the recognition of antigens presented by MHC class II molecules, even in the absence of co-stimulation delivered via PRR-mediated signalling. The crucial signals delivered by memory CD4 + T cells to DCs in this process are unclear and could involve both cell-surface interactions and cytokine signals. The outcome of DC activation and the initiation of inflammatory responses are similar whether triggered through PRRs or memory CD4 + T cells but, in situations of infection with a rapidly replicating virus (such as influenza virus), memory CD4 + T cell-mediated enhancement of innate immunity is substantially quicker and more effective than that provided by PRR triggering.

By contrast, T H 2-type and non-polarized (T H 0) memory T cells have a minimal impact on pulmonary inflammation following influenza virus challenge. To induce innate inflammatory responses, memory CD4 + T cells must recognize antigens on CD11c + APCs. These APCs become activated during interactions with memory CD4 + T cells, and this results in the upregulation of MHC class II and co-stimulatory molecule expression by the APCs. Activated APCs contribute to the subsequent innate inflammatory response through the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-6 and IL-1\u03b2. By contrast, the naive CD4 + T cell response in vivo does not have an appreciable impact on the tissue inflammatory response at 48 hours post-infection 132 . In other studies, naive CD4 + T cells could actually downregulate tissue inflammation following mouse hepatitis virus infection 133 . The ability of T H 1-type and T H 17-type memory CD4 + T cells, but not T H 2-type or non-polarized memory T cells, to promote an early inflammatory response may help to explain why transfer of virus-specific T H 1 and T H 17 effector cells, but not transfer of T H 2 or non-polarized T cells, promotes early control of viral loads in mice infected with influenza virus 16, 86, 132 . A similar impact of memory CD4 + T cells on early viral control during secondary influenza infection was recently reported by Chapman et al. 134 , and this also correlated with a dramatic enhancement of innate immune responses against the virus.

Memory CD4 + T cells contain preformed stores of CD40L, an important signal in CD4 + T cellmediated help for antibody production 142 . The location of memory CD4 + T cells may also be an advantage. For example, antigen-specific memory CD4 + T cells with a T FH cell phenotype are retained in the draining lymph nodes of mice for over 6 months following immunization 143 . The increased levels and polarized profile of cytokines produced by memory CD4 + T cells, as compared with those of naive T cells, is likely to promote a more-robust B cell antibody response and to dictate the antibody isotype, which has a key role in the efficacy of antibodies specific for viruses such Ebola virus 144 , WNV 145 and influenza virus 146 . Recent observations suggest that IL-4 and IFN\u03b3 produced by T FH cells have a central role in driving not only immunoglobulin class switching in the germinal centre, but also B cell affinity maturation 147 .",

However, the features of memory cells described here suggest that memory CD4 + T cells could promote an accelerated response by naive CD8 + T cells, both through more-rapid licensing of APCs and through faster and more-robust production of IL-2 and possibly other cytokines; these possibilities need to be explored. In support of this concept, a study using Listeria monocytogenes found that T H 1-type but not T H 2-type memory CD4 + T cells enhanced primary CD8 + T cell responses in terms of both magnitude and cytokine production, although the mechanism of memory CD4 + T cell-mediated help was not determined 148 . Whatever the pathways involved, the fact that memory CD4 + T cells enhance the generation of CD8 + T cell memory and that this process has a greater dependence on CD4 + T cell-mediated help when PRR stimulation is limited suggests that CD4 + T cell-mediated help will be of particular importance in achieving optimal CD8 + T cell memory responses with vaccines that do not contain live, replication-competent viruses.",

In HSV-2 infection, IFN\u03b3 expression by CD4 + T cells is required to induce chemokines that recruit effector CD8 + T cells to the infected vaginal tissue 150 . Similar roles for CD4 + T cells in promoting CD8 + T cell recruitment may occur during infections with other viruses, although it is often difficult to separate the roles of CD4 + T cells in generating effector CD8 + T cells from their roles in modifying CD8 + T cell trafficking 39, 85, 151 .",

            "text": "The presence of memory CD4 + T cells that are capable of producing multiple cytokines has been correlated with superior protective capacity in numerous studies 152 , but how such cells achieve enhanced protection has not been addressed. One possibility is that 'secondary' effector CD4 + T cells that arise from memory precursors may be much more efficient in directly combating pathogens than primary effector CD4 + T cells that arise from naive cells. Our recent experiments that directly compared such primary and secondary effectors during influenza virus infection support such a view (T.M.S., K.K.M., L. M. Bradley and S.L.S., unpublished observations). We found that following adoptive transfer of either antigen-specific memory CD4 + T cells or an equal number of antigen-specific naive CD4 + T cell pre cursors, the secondary effector populations that developed from the memory CD4 + T cells showed greater expansion and contained higher frequencies of T cells that secrete multiple cytokines. Furthermore, although high levels of IL-10 were produced by primary effector CD4 + T cells during influenza virus infection, secondary effector cells produced much less IL-10. Thus, memory CD4 + T cells seem to give rise to secondary effector T cells that are distinct from and superior to the primary effectors derived from naive CD4 + T cells. We suggest that this results in more-protective recall responses, and we predict that further functions of secondary effectors will be discovered as additional comparative analyses are carried out.",

Key among these roles is the provision of help to B cells, but CD4 + T cells also contribute to the antiviral response by producing cytokines and chemokines, by enhancing CD8 + T cells responses and through direct cytotoxic effects on virus-infected cells.",

Depending on the particular pathogen and the level of infection, these mechanisms may often be redundant, but they are likely to each make key contributions following exposure to high doses of rapidly replicating viruses or to viruses that have evolved mechanisms to evade specific immune pathways. We point out that the study of the immune response to viral infections has revealed new mechanisms by which CD4 + T cells function to protect against pathogens, and we predict that additional mechanisms will be identified in the future. Thus, this area of study will lead to a better understanding of how vaccines can be designed to harness the power of CD4 + T cell memory.",

The crucial initial steps in generating primary antiviral T cell responses are the uptake of viral antigens by antigen-presenting cells (APCs) in infected tissue, the activation of APCs by patternrecognition receptor (PRR) ligation, and the migration of these cells to draining lymph nodes. The nature of the viral infection, as well as PRR ligation, can influence the activation status of antigen-bearing APCs and the T helper (T H ) cell-polarizing environment. The recognition of antigens on activated APCs by naive T cells during viral infection predominately results in the generation of T H 1 cells owing to the presence of type I interferons (IFNs) and interleukin-12 (IL-12). However, T H 17, T H 2 and regulatory T (T Reg ) cell populations are also generated to some degree in certain viral infections.

Follicular helper T (T FH ) cells are a specialized subset of CD4 + T cells that provide help to B cells through both cell-cell interactions (most notably CD40L-CD40 interactions) and the release of cytokines. The generation of neutralizing antibodies is a crucial component of protection against many viral pathogens and the goal of most vaccine strategies. b | The best-characterized pathway of CD4 + T cell-mediated help in the generation of CD8 + T cell effectors involves the provision of interleukin-2 (IL-2) and the activation, known as 'licensing', of antigen-presenting cells (APCs) via CD40L-CD40 interactions. It is often unclear whether CD4 + T cell-mediated help has a role in the initial generation of antiviral CD8 + T cell effector responses, presumably because viruses can trigger pattern-recognition receptors and independently activate APCs. However, a clear role for CD4 + T cell-mediated help in the generation of functional memory CD8 + T cells has been demonstrated during viral infection. Downregulation of TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) expression on CD8 + T cells is a prominent feature of CD8 + T cells that have been helped and at least in part facilitates their robust recall response during secondary infection.
