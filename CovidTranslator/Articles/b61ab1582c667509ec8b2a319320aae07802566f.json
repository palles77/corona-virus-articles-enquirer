Below are specific lessons that were considered vital to the business continuity operations of a cancer center during an outbreak: a. Staff need to be protected from infection risk and burnout due to manpower shortage from quarantine, necessitating drastic workflow changes b. Limited resources and facilities for oncological care and infection control, including blood products, isolation rooms and PPE will be depleted during outbreaks, necessitating careful allocation or re-designation c. The difficulty in identifying viral infection in cancer patients poses unique challenges to screening and in-hospital transmission; requiring distinct surveillance protocols from non-cancer patients d. Workflows and policies evolve rapidly during an outbreak, requiring an adaptable framework for clinical care and therapeutic trials, that can be escalated or de-escalated quickly in coordination with the hospital/ nation.",

For patients undergoing radiation therapy, hypo-fractionated treatments were favored, while specialized procedures such as stereotactic body radiotherapy, radiosurgery and brachytherapy were limited. In the inpatient setting, cancer surgeries were allowed to proceed as planned but all non-cancer surgeries were postponed by three months. Hospital negative-pressure isolation rooms were reassigned to the pandemic team for COVID-19 suspected and confirmed cases. Due to an anticipated shortage of these rooms hospital-wide and the nursing complexity of hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) patients, low-risk suspected COVID-19 HSCT patients were kept in the HSCT unit high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA)filtered single rooms with an antechamber. Non-HSCT hematology patients who were lowrisk suspected cases for COVID-19 were admitted to neutral pressure isolation rooms, rather than negative pressure rooms, thereby preventing them from being exposed to other nosocomial infection sources. A nationwide blood product shortage resulted from social distancing practices, cancellation of mobile blood drives and stringent donor screening. For cancer patients, blood stocks were conserved for emergency surgeries, active bleeding, and semi-elective cancer surgeries. Red cell and platelet transfusion were limited per patient and lower hemoglobin thresholds were accepted for asymptomatic patients.",

Clear communication was also recognized to be key to minimizing uncertainty among staff. From the outset of the COVID-19 outbreak, senior hospital management gave daily email updates on the status of cases nationwide, modifications to workflow and suspect case definition. NCIS staff were issued personal thermometers for twice-daily temperature recording. The threshold for COVID-19 testing in healthcare workers was low, and staff with respiratory symptoms or fever were given at least five days of medical leave.

We show that despite COVID-19 community transmission, the segregated team model allowed the continuation of cancer care and clinical trials, and may be replicable in other similar centers globally.
