Serologic testing for Mycoplasma, Legionella, and Chlamydia and nasopharyngeal aspirate for common viral antigens were not performed, as clinical suspicion was low. She was subsequently transferred to the geriatric unit. Her condition improved, and she was placed in the general ward on March 28. No protective equipment was used by staff attending her in the general ward. It was ascertained that she was previously admitted to a non-SARS ward in Tan Tock Seng Hospital.

Pneumonia developed in the patient's daughter-in-law, who had visited her in the hospital, and two grandsons living in the same household as the daugh-ter-in-law. Another son-in-law, who met this daughter-inlaw during the funeral, also contracted a respiratory illness. A healthcare worker, who was unprotected while caring for the patient, was also admitted to Changi General Hospital for severe pneumonia. He was later transferred to Tan Tock Seng Hospital where he was diagnosed with SARS. He required prolonged mechanical ventilation and eventually died of the illness. A female hospital cleaner in Changi General Hospital, who cleaned the room and tidied the patient's bed in the general ward, became symptomatic 3 days after the patient died. She was admitted to Changi General Hospital 10 days later and was transferred to Tan Tock Seng Hospital the next day. Her husband was subsequently admitted to Tan Tock Seng Hospital with SARS. All cases in the cluster had fever as a presenting complaint. On the basis of epidemiologic data (contact tracing linking her to one of the three original index cases in Singapore) (12) , the index patient's cause of death was determined to be SARS (Figure 3 ). Serologic testing for SARS-CoV by using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) techniques on various specimens during admission for febrile illness were positive at titers of 400 to 6,400 for all patients within the cluster except the patient's daughter-in-law and the healthcare worker from the nursing home.",

The patient had a fever, which responded to a course of broad-spectrum antimicrobial drugs, thus behaving in a manner not much different from a typical community-acquired pneumonia. The absence of fever during the final course of the patient's hospitalization could have been caused by an altered immune response in the geriatric age group, with a resulting normal leukocyte count. Furthermore, prior usage of antimicrobial drugs and possible aspiration from dysphagia may further complicate detection of the disease. The suspicion of SARS in this case was thus low before eventual epidemiologic links were established retrospectively. Dyspnea is a common symptom reported previously, ranging from 60% to 80% of patients. Cough has also been noted in 80% to 100% of cases in previous studies (6, 8) . However the absence of cough, especially in the elderly, could be due to an underlying weak cough reflex. Vomiting, though present in our patient, was only accounted for in 10% of cases in the Canadian series (8) . In a frail older person, this could also be caused by a number of circumstances.",

We wish to draw attention to clinicians, so that a high level of suspicion is present as the SARS-CoV is highly contagious and can cause severe disease. We observed that despite being cared for in the general ward by staff without full personal protective equipment, only one healthcare worker in Changi General Hospital was infected. This observation supports the hypothesis that the virus may not transmit effectively under certain conditions. Nevertheless, late diagnosis may lead to large clusters, as delayed isolation of suspect cases increases the risk of onward transmission in the community (15) . A positive contact history may not be obvious, particularly in patients with cognitive impairment, until retrospective analysis is done. There is thus a need for continued surveillance of fever and clusters of pneumonia cases to improve the chances of early detection. Nonetheless, with the imminent availability of accurate and rapid diagnostic tests, there is hope that the diagnosis of SARS can be made with more certainty. This could be further enhanced by a revised case definition.",
