To better understand the impacts of ecological interactions, individual movement and disease on global change ecology, including wildlife management and conservation, it is important to have simulators that will provide demographic, movement, and epidemiology null models against which to compare patterns observed in empirical systems. Such models may then be used to develop quantitative narratives that enhance our intuition and understanding of the relationship between population structure and generative processes: in essence, along with empirical and experimental narratives, quantitative narratives are used to advance ecological epistemology. Here we describe a simulator that accounts for the influence of consumer-resource interactions, existence of social groups anchored around a central location, territoriality, group-switching behavior, and disease dynamics on population size. We use this simulator to develop new and reinforce existing quantitative narratives and point out areas for future study.",

Population models are central to our efforts to assess the numerical and ecological status of species and threats posed by climate change. Models, however, are crude caricatures of complex ecological systems. So how do we construct reliable assessment models able to capture processes essential to predicating the impacts of global change on population viability without getting tied up in their vast complexities? We broach this question and demonstrate how models focusing at the level of the individual (i.e., agent-based models) are tools for developing robust, narratives to augment narratives arising purely from empirical data sources and experimental outcomes. We do this in the context of nesting social groups, foraging for food, while exhibiting territoriality and group-switching behavior; and, we evaluate the impact of disease on the viability of such populations. 7 laboratory at the microcosm scale [7], but for populations of most vertebrates such 8 microcosm studies are not applicable, and we need to resort to the mesocosm level [8] or 9 use alternative methods to obtain insights. One of these methods is to build simulation 10 models that incorporate demographic, spatial, movement, and other relevant behavioral 11 and community processes, and then compare simulations of these models across various 12 scenarios [9] or outcomes with and without epidemiological processes added to the mix. 13 We take this latter approach and our primary aim is to develop a tool that can be used 14 to study the impact of disease on colonial populations and metapopulations [10] . This 15 tool must be comprehensive enough to include critical processes needed to address 16 questions that will extend our current knowledge in significant ways. Its application, of 17 course, is limited by the structure of the model. Thus, in building the model, we are 18 guided by principles related to concepts of \"appropriate complexity modeling\" [11, 12] .",

            "text": "At this point, a few brief remarks on quantitative narratives in disease ecology are in 60 order. Unlike the canonical theories of physics-with kinematics, electromagnetism, 61 general relativity, and quantum mechanics providing prime examples, ecology has no 62 fundamental theories and associated mathematical formulations that can be used to 63 develop an ecological epistemology. Rather, the complexity of the field induced by the 64 plethora of processes involved requires that we focus only on a limited number of these 65 processes when building models, where the selection of process depends on the questions 66 at hand [11]. Our understanding of these processes requires an analysis of associated 67 quantitative formulations, but the soundness of the arguments cannot be adjudicated by 68 comparing, say, the accuracy of Mercury's orbit as predicted by Newtonian versus 69 Einsteinian physics. Rather, ecological epistemology is woven from a collection of 70 quantitative narratives that provide current best explanations for, or fits to, observed 71 empirical and experimental data. While statistical null models are use to develop 72 consilient empirical and experimental narratives, dynamic null models are used to 73 develop quantitative narratives that are consilient with empirical and experimental 74 narratives (Fig. 1). Such dynamic null models have a Goldilocks quality in the sense of 75 containing just the right amount of biological process detail [42]: too little and model 76 simulations are rejected as providing adequate descriptions of observed data; too much 77 process detail and the null-model-parsimony principle, as discussed by Gotteli and 78 Graves ( [42], p. 6), is violated. 79 Fig 1.

This narrative 81 begins with insights into competitive exclusion [44, 45], supported by additional 82 quantitative ideas relating to niche breadth and overlap [46, 47]. In epidemiology, 83 quantitative narratives, derived from analyses of SEIR epidemic models (S: susceptible; 84 E: exposed but not yet infectious; I: infections; R: removed-that is, recovered with 85 immunity or dead) [13] , have been used to identify critical differences in the emergence 86 of outbreak thresholds depending on whether pathogen transmission is dependent on quantitative narratives in epidemiology that incorporate aspects of the movement of 89 individuals [50] or particular ecological processes have been used to develop canonical 90 theories [51][52][53][54][55]; however, these are limited in scope and generality by the analytical 91 difficulties of studying dynamical systems, as well as networks that include more than 92 one ecological or behavioral process.

These equations were 187 used to code the model using the Numerus Model Builder (NMB) platform that greatly 188 facilitated rapid, accurate construction of the model through NMB's hierarchical 189 architecture and chip design. More specifically, cell equations and agent equations were 190 first constructed as individual modules, which were then used to populate a \"world\" 191 with an open-ended number of agents moving over an 18\u00d718 hexagonal cellular array 192 that contained 9 regularly spaced nest cells (Fig. 1) . A toroidal topology was used to 3.1 Base-line scenario: no disease, no colony switching 218 We ran two instances of the baseline scenario and obtained similar results with some 219 stochastic variation across runs.

No subclass of a population (e.g., infectious individuals or even the 371 population as a whole) can persist forever-both are bounded stochastic population 372 processes that are known to go extinct in a finite amount of time [74, 75] . This is amply 373 demonstrated in our simulations that consider the impacts of increasing pathogen 374 transmission rates.

Indeed, for \u03b2 = 0.05, once an outbreak occurs, it generally lasts 378 longer then 1000 time steps, as illustrated in Fig. 7 . This remains true as the virulence 379 of the pathogen increases from \u00b5 I = 0 (blue plots in Fig. 7 ) through \u00b5 I = 0.03 (orange 380 plots in Fig. 7 ) and \u00b5 ID = 0.1 (grey plots in Fig. 7 ) to \u00b5 I = 0.2 (yellow plots in Fig. 7 ). 381 What is clear from these simulations is that as virulence increases, the number of more precise than the level of the errors associated with the fit of models to data.",

An 142 agent belonging to a particular colony marks each cell that it moves through with 143 a colony-specific marker. The accumulation of such markers (with fading effects144 over time) facilitates the emergence of territorial movement behavior.145 Consumer-resource ecology. When individuals move they loose biomass, but if they 146 remain in a cell they gain biomass. Changes in biomass are computed using 147 dynamic consumer-resource interaction processes that incorporate stress 148 components as well [63, 64]. These dynamics account for resource growth, 149 saturation, storage processes, and agent resource-extraction rates (which depend 150 on the efficiency of extraction as a function of resource density, as well as the 151 impacts of interference competition from other agents: i.e., so-called mutual 152 interference [65, 66]). 153 Territoriality. Cells have a fading memory of the accumulated visits of all individuals 154 from a particular colony (through the deposit of a scent-like marker each time an 155 agent enters the cell) [67]. 156 Movement. At each time-step-except when moving back to the colony at regular 157 intervals of time-individuals move to cells, selected with given probabilities based 158 on their relative attractiveness. This attractiveness increases with resource 159 richness and decreases with distance, as well as with the strength of the markings 160 of agents from foreign colonies. 161 Births and deaths.

Notably, the NMB platform has two independent components. The first is a set 198 of coding tools accessed through a graphical user interface (GUI) that is used to 199 generate a NovaScript, which is an enriched JavaScript language. This script can then 200 be run in any suitable run-time environment, where NMB currently provides a Java 201 runtime engine implementable in Windows, MacOS, and Linux environments. An 202 example of a script created for our model is provided in our SOF, together with a table 203 that facilitates moving between the code and the mathematical description in Section 6. 204 Finally, our model is available online (see our SOF) and interested readers can run the 205 model after downloading a free version of the NMB platform at the Numerus website 206 (numerusinc.com). experience with the consumer-resource component of the model [69, 70] and some 209 experimentation led us to select a set of resource and consumer growth and interaction 210 process rate parameters, as well as consumer stress and mortality process rate 211 parameters (Tables 2 & 3) that were used to generate a baseline set of simulation results 212 against which we could compare the agent and colony population dynamics under 213 different movement and disease scenarios. We set up our NMB dashboard so that we 214 could observe plots of information in real time and create a visual record of all 215 parameter values used to produce the results of interest. An example of this output 216 obtained during one of our simulations is provided in Fig. 2.",
