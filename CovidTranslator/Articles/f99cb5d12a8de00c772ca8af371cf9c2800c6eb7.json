The SARS-CoV-2 was found to be closely related to the SARS-CoV, based on the genomic analysis. The Angiotensin converting enzyme 2 protein (ACE2) utilized by the SARS-CoV as a receptor was found to facilitate the infection of SARS-CoV-2, initiated by the binding of the spike protein to the human ACE2. Using homology modeling and molecular dynamics (MD) simulation methods, we report here the detailed structure of the ACE2 in complex with the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. The predicted model is highly consistent with the experimentally determined complex structures. Besides the binding interface reported in the crystal structures, new plausible binding poses were revealed from all-atom MD simulations. The simulation data helped identify critical residues at the complex interface and provided more details about the interactions between the SARS-CoV-2 RBD and human ACE2. Two mutants mimicking rat ACE2 were modeled to study the mutation effects on RBD binding to ACE2.",

Furthermore, the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein has a protein sequence identity of 73% for the receptor binding domain (RBD) with the SARS-CoV RBD (denoted as SARS-RBD in the following). The SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 both utilize the human Angiotensin converting enzyme 2 protein (ACE2) to initiate the spike protein binding and facilitate the fusion to host cells [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] . The 193-residue RBD of the SARS-CoV spike protein has been found to be sufficient to bind the human ACE2 6 . Based on this fact, the RBD of SARS-CoV-2 becomes a critical protein target for drug development to treat the COVID-19. When this study was started, neither the crystal structure of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein nor the RBD segment were determined, so the homology modeling approach was applied to construct the model of the SARS-CoV-2 spike RBD in complex with the human ACE2 binding domain (denoted as CoV2-RBD/ACE2 in the following).",

In both predicted and the crystal structures of the CoV2-RBD/ACE2 complex, the L 67 does not form close contacts with the ACE2. The analysis of the crystal packing revealed that this loop participated in the interaction with another asymmetric unit (see Figure S3 ). Interestingly, the simulation data suggested that the L 67 could move towards the ACE2 and form contacts with the helix-1. This can potentially enhance the binding, as reflected in the change of interaction energies. In the crystal structure, the C480 and C488 of the RBD are crosslinked via a disulfide bond that reduces the flexibility of the L 67 region, limiting its access to the ACE2. On the other hand, it has been reported that the binding of SARS-RBD to ACE2 is insensitive to the redox states of the cysteines to a high extend 26 . Based on the simulation results, we hypothesize that the reduced form of C480 and C488 can also exist during the virus invasion to host cells, and the reduced cysteines can potentially enhance the binding to ACE2.

For ACE2 residues near the binding interface (within 4.0 \u00c5 of the RBD), the RMSD is smaller than 0.43 \u00c5 compared to the SARS-RBD/ACE2 complex. The superposed structures revealed that the RBD/ACE2 interfaces are almost identical in two complexes(Figure 1c).In a retrospective comparison, the homology model was superposed to a newly resolved crystal structure (PDB ID: 6LZG; seeFigure 2dfor a detailed comparison at the interface).",

The RMSD with respect to the starting model indicated that the sampled structures were mostly 2.5 \u00c5 to 5.0 \u00c5 compared to the starting model (Figure 3a). The largest contribution to the conformational changes in CoV2-RBD is from the loop regions, indicated by the peaks shown in the fluctuation plots (Figure 3b). The residues with welldefined secondary structures (mainly \u03b2 -strands) exhibited very small conformational changes (the RMSD is about 1.0 \u00c5 including side chain atoms), while the loop regions have RMSD values between 3.7 \u00c5 to 5.4 \u00c5. This is consistent with the residue fluctuations measured with the RMSF (root-mean-square-fluctuation) for the RBD subunit (Figure 3b). For the ACE2 receptor domain, the major conformational change is the opening/closing of the enzymatic active site, which is remote from the RBD binding interface (see Video 1). The CoV2-RBD remained bound to human ACE2, even though substantial conformational changes occurred to the ACE2 and the loop region of the RBD. This observation implies that the binding of CoV2-RBD to the ACE2 is very stable, similar with the case of the SARS-RBD that binds to both open and closed forms of human ACE2 7,25 .Based on the structural similarity, a clustering analysis was carried out to identify the most populated structures, from which the representative model for each trajectory was selected (Figure 3). The CoV2-RBD/ACE2 interfaces were highlighted using blue/red colors with stick representations. The RMSD of structures in the simulations were calculated with respect to the these representative models, in order to assess the model convergence and coverage of the simulated conformations(Figure 3a, right panels).
