At a histopathological level, the disease is identified by the presence of large eosinophilic cytoplasmic inclusions in multiple tissues. To date, no virus or other pathogen has been definitively characterized or associated with the disease. Using a metagenomic approach to search for candidate etiologic agents in snakes with confirmed IBD, we identified and de novo assembled the complete genomic sequences of two viruses related to arenaviruses, and a third arenavirus-like sequence was discovered by screening an additional set of samples. A continuous boa constrictor cell line was established and used to propagate and isolate one of the viruses in culture. Viral nucleoprotein was localized and concentrated within large cytoplasmic inclusions in infected cells in culture and tissues from diseased snakes. In total, viral RNA was detected in 6/8 confirmed IBD cases and 0/18 controls. These viruses have a typical arenavirus genome organization but are highly divergent, belonging to a lineage separate from that of the Old and New World arenaviruses. Furthermore, these viruses encode envelope glycoproteins that are more similar to those of filoviruses than to those of other arenaviruses. These findings implicate these viruses as candidate etiologic agents of IBD. The presence of arenaviruses outside mammals reveals that these viruses infect an unexpectedly broad range of species and represent a new reservoir of potential human pathogens.",

Now, high-throughput sequencing, such as the Illumina technology, is being increasingly used as its price decreases and throughput increases.

RNA was extracted from frozen brain, lung, liver, kidney, heart, and gastrointestinal (GI) tissue from the animals for which multiple tissues were available (CAS02 to CAS07; Table 1 ), and libraries were prepared for deep sequencing (see Materials and Methods). Of these six animals, five had been diagnosed as IBD positive, and one (CAS04) was negative. Sequencing on the Illumina HiSeq platform generated approximately 1 \u03eb 10 8 pairs of 100-nucleotide (nt) sequences, on average~6 million sequences for each of the 35 samples (no sample was available from the heart of snake CAS07). The complete data set for all samples is available from the NCBI Short Read Archive (accession no. SRA053624). To facilitate the search for viral sequences, we first removed low-quality, lowcomplexity, and host-derived sequences. To remove host sequences, including those deriving from possibly confounding endogenous retroviruses, we removed reads matching the recently sequenced boa constrictor genome (assembly no. 1 [16] ). These operations reduced the size of the data sets by an average of 93%. Identification of two distinct arenavirus-like genomes. With the remaining sequences, we performed BLASTX searches against a database of viral protein sequences (17) . This search revealed the presence of substantial numbers of sequences with similarity to arenavirus protein sequences in all of the IBD-diagnosed samples. We used these BLAST hits to nucleate complete genome assemblies using the PRICE de novo genome assembler (G. Ruby, freely available at http://derisilab.ucsf.edu/software/price/index.html). This analysis revealed that there were actually two distinct (59% pairwise nucleotide identity) but related viruses in the snakes from the aquarium: one from the IBD-positive annulated tree boas and one from the IBD-positive boa constrictors (Table 1 ; Fig. 2 ",

Retrospective mapping of the sequences revealed that the individual IBDpositive tissue data sets contained between 8,422 and 227,134 viral sequences (between 0.13% and 3.8% of the total reads). Overall genome coverage ranged from 825-fold to 3,335-fold (the average number of sequences covering each base). The complete genomes for both viral species are available from GenBank (accession numbers JQ717261 to JQ717264). The data sets from IBD-negative CAS04 contained very low frequencies of sequences mapping to the two viruses (\u03fd5 \u03eb 10 \u03ea5 ), a phenomenon that was also observed for the boa constrictor virus in the annulated tree boa samples and vice versa. These low-copy-number sequences likely resulted from intersample cross-contamination or bar code misregistration during sequencing (18) . This explanation was corroborated by quantitative reverse transcription-PCR (qRT-PCR), which demonstrated that all tissues of snake CAS04 were negative for viral RNA (there was no amplification) (Fig. 2 ). This analysis also confirmed that the two viruses segregated perfectly with the two snake species. By sequencing and by quantitative PCR (qPCR), viral RNA was detected in every tissue examined, a pattern reminiscent of the histopathological detection of inclusions in all of these tissues (Fig. 2) .",

Each bar represents one tissue: from left to right, brain, GI tissue, heart, kidney, liver, lung, serum, and blood cells. The snakes' histopathology-based IBD diagnoses are indicated. Snake designations are given in Table 1 . A sample was unavailable for CAS07 heart tissue, and data were unavailable for the CAS06 kidney. snake suggested that the viruses might play a role in disease pathogenesis (Fig. 2) . To investigate this possibility, we obtained and screened 21 additional samples from IBD-positive and -negative snakes of various species for viral RNA (Table 1) . We performed RT-PCR with multiple sets of primers, including consensus primers designed to amplify sequence from both novel viruses, and by additional deep sequencing in some cases. A third related virus was detected by RT-PCR in a boa constrictor from Collierville, TN, diagnosed with IBD in 2008. Although the complete genome of this third virus has not yet been fully determined, alignments of the recovered sequences reveal that this third virus is more closely related (~80% nucleotide identity) to the virus recovered from the CAS boa constrictors (see Fig. S1 in the supplemental material). Viral RNA was not detected in the other three confirmed IBD cases. Thus, 6/8 IBD-positive samples were positive for one of these divergent but related viruses. We did not detect viral RNA in any of 18 control samples (Table 1 ). These results show that multiple related arenavirus-like viruses are associated with geographically and temporally widespread IBD cases and also reveal a high degree of diversity in this clade. Until all available samples can be analyzed by deep sequencing, we cannot rule out the presence of additional divergent species in the samples that have tested negative by RT-PCR.",

However, like Z, these proteins did not contain detectable homology to arenavirus glycoproteins as measured by BLAST (versus nr) or HHPred. Instead, by BLASTP analysis the snake virus proteins were related to the glycoproteins of filoviruses (e.g., Ebola and Marburg viruses) and avian retroviruses (e.g., avian leukosis virus) and the cellular syncytin, a repurposed endogenous retroviral gene (Fig. 3D) (35, 36) . The predicted GPs of CASV and GGV are 393 and 427 amino acids long and, like other class 1 viral fusion proteins, may be proteolytically cleaved into two functional domains: the GP1 receptor binding and the GP2 transmembrane/ fusion domains (37, 38) . Amino acids 222 to 393 of CASV GP and 256 to 427 of GGV GP are 82% identical. This relatively conserved domain likely corresponds to the GP2 domain and was the region with detectable similarity by BLAST. Using HHPred, the top hit for this domain of both CASV and GGV was to the Sudan Ebola virus GP2 (PDB accession no. 3S88; probability of homologous relationships, 99.98%). Like filovirus GP2s, the CASV and GGV domains are predicted to form C-terminal transmembrane do-mains that anchor the protein in the viral membrane. In contrast to the relatively conserved GP2 domain, the predicted N-terminal GP1 domains of CASV and GGV glycoproteins are only 31% identical, and neither domain contains detectable homology to known proteins (by BLASTP versus nr with an E value of \u03fd1). Analysis of the predicted GP1/GP2 boundaries did not reveal obvious candidate protease cleavage sites present in both the GGV and CASV sequences. In vitro virus culture. To enable further characterization of these viruses, we developed in vitro cell culture growth conditions that permitted virus propagation. We first attempted to infect reptile cell lines available from the ATCC (viper heart VH-2 and iguana heart IGH-2). Inoculum was prepared from the kidney and liver of the boa constrictors CAS06 and CAS07, the samples from which sufficient frozen tissue remained. Viral RNA levels in culture supernatant were monitored by qRT-PCR. Viral RNA was initially detectable in the supernatant but rapidly disappeared as culture medium was replaced and was undetectable by 7 days postinoculation and over the course of 18 days. We observed similar negative results with an African green monkey-derived Vero cell line, known to be permissive for the replication of many arenaviruses. This suggested that these lines or the culture conditions were not permissive for replication or that the inoculum that we used lacked replication-competent virus.",

Many eosinophilic inclusions stained brightly with NP while others appeared to be ringed by NP fluorescence (closed and open arrowheads in Fig. 6 ). This could be explained by differential cross-sectioning of the inclusions during tissue sectioning, for instance, if the inclusions were roughly spherical and coated with NP protein. In this scenario, in equatorial cross sections the NP fluorescence would ring the inclusions. And if the section captured the top or bottom surface of the inclusion, then the fluorescence would appear as filled circles. Alternatively, there may be multiple, structurally distinct types of inclusions, or inclusions may be differentially accessible to antibody during staining.",

These viruses were detected in 6/8 snakes with confirmed IBD diagnoses and 0/18 IBD-negative animals. In infected animals, viral RNA and protein were detected in tissues with cytoplasmic inclusions, and indeed, viral nucleoprotein was found to localize to the same eosinophilic inclusions that give the disease its name.

There are several possible models to explain the configurations of the extant arenavirus species. One possibility is that the GPC gene of the arenavirus common ancestor was more similar to the GPC gene of CASV and GGV and therefore to those of filoviruses and avian retroviruses (Fig. 7A) . In this scenario, recombination or significant divergence occurred on the lineage leading to the Old World (OW) and New World (NW) arenaviruses. An alternate model is that the GP gene of the ancestral arenavirus was similar to that of the present-day rodent arenaviruses and may itself have derived from an ancestor common with the filoviruses (Fig. 7B) . Then, along the lineage leading to snake arenaviruses, recombination with a filovirus or retrovirus introduced a new GP gene. Intrasegmental recombination between arenaviruses leading to speciation has been documented, so a precedent for these models exists (46) .",

It is possible that-as is often the case in rodents-arenavirus infection of snakes is chronic and subclinical. Indeed, the CAS snakes diagnosed as IBD and virus positive (Table 1) were not showing any of the typical signs of regurgitation, anorexia, or central ner-vous system abnormalities at the time of sample collection, though it could have been relatively early in the course of infection. In contrast, the snake from Tennessee that was diagnosed as IBD and arenavirus positive (Table 1) was diagnosed in a postmortem exam. This snake had produced a clutch of infertile eggs (slugs), developed dysecdysis (incomplete shedding), continued to decline, and ultimately died. It is clear that arenavirus infection does result in large viral protein-containing inclusions, a diagnostic finding believed to be prognostic of a fatal outcome, although disease progression has proven variable, with animals surviving for weeks to months after first clinical manifestation, and with the caveat that \"IBD\" in different snake species may ultimately prove attributable to different causes.",

Likewise, it is unclear how the virus is transmitted. One possibility is that virus is transmitted from snake to snake by blood-feeding mites, infestations of which have anecdotally been associated with IBD outbreaks (1). Snakes eat rodents; thus, another possibility is that these viruses are transmitted when snakes eat infected mice or rats. This possibility is not unprecedented: \"callitrichid hepatitis virus\" was originally identified as the agent responsible for outbreaks of fatal hepatitis in captive marmosets and tamarins in zoos (47) . This virus was subsequently shown to be identical to LCMV, which was being transmitted to the zoo animals via infected mice that they were fed (48) (49) (50) . In contrast, the viruses identified here are highly divergent from Old and New World arenaviruses. Additional experiments to test the viruses' host range in cell lines and animals will help answer these questions.",

There are a number of other possible causes of the pathology observed in these cases. One obvious alternative is infection by other viruses not detected by our methods, including additional divergent arenaviruses. A precedent for this possibility is the case of avian proventricular dilatation disease, where follow-up studies identified numerous additional genogroups of avian bornavirus, the causative agent (15, (51) (52) (53) (54) . Deep sequencing of additional IBDpositive samples will help resolve this question. Alternatively, infection by nonviral pathogens may be responsible in some cases, though we did not detect any obvious such organisms in our metagenomic analyses. Alternatively, the cytoplasmic inclusions may be a by-product of some other disease state or cellular stress, although the localization of viral nucleoprotein to these inclusions that we observed would appear to contradict this alternate hypothesis. Expanded association studies will more firmly determine the proportion of IBD cases attributable to arenavirus infection and may identify etiologic agents responsible for nonarenavirus IBD diagnoses.",

The sequences of all oligonucleotides are listed in Table S1 in the supplemental material. Reaction mixtures were incubated for 60 min at 42\u00b0C and then 15 min at 70\u00b0C. Then, 10 U APE1 and 1 U UDG (NEB) diluted in 5 l 1\u03eb Sequenase buffer (Affymetrix) were added to reaction mixtures to remove the oligo(dU/dT) RT primer. Reaction mixtures were incubated for 30 min at 37\u00b0C and then 94\u00b0C for 2 min. To generate end-tagged molecules, primer MDS-4 and 2 U of Sequenase DNA polymerase (Affymetrix) in 5 l of 1\u03eb buffer were added to samples, which were ramped from 10\u00b0C to 37\u00b0C over 8 min and then incubated at 37\u00b0C for 8 min. These primer extension reactions were performed twice to generate doubly end-tagged molecules, which were subsequently amplified by PCR. PCR mixtures contained 1\u03eb reaction buffer, 2 M primer MDS-189, 0.25 mM dNTPs, 2 U KlenTaq DNA polymerase (Sigma), and 2 l library template. Thermocycling conditions were 95\u00b0C for 2 min; 2 cycles of 95\u00b0C for 30 s, 40\u00b0C for 30 s, and 72\u00b0C for 1 min; and then 15 cycles with a 55\u00b0C annealing temperature. PCR mixtures were cleaned using the Ampure XP reagent (Agencourt) according to the manufacturer's protocol but using a 1.4:1 ratio of beads to sample. Ten nanograms of library template was then added to PCR mixtures containing 1\u03eb reaction buffer, 0.25 mM dNTPs, 0.01 M (each) primers MDS-9 and MDS-10 (bar code), and 12.5 U KlenTaq DNA polymerase. Thermocycling conditions were 95\u00b0C for 2 min and 2 cycles of 95\u00b0C for 30 s, 40\u00b0C for 30 s, and 72\u00b0C for 1 min. Then, primers MDS-200 and -201 were added to reaction mixtures to a final concentration of 0.2 M, and 6 more cycles with a 58\u00b0C annealing temperature were performed. Reaction mixtures were cleaned again with Ampure XP reagent, and their relative concentrations were quantified in qPCR mixtures containing 1\u03eb LC480 Sybr Green master mix (Roche) and 0. Sequence analysis. In addition to the default Illumina quality filtering, low-quality sequences containing any N's were removed from further analysis. Low-complexity sequences with an LZW ratio less than 0.45 (the ratio of the length of the Lempel-Ziv-Welch compressed sequence to the uncompressed length) were additionally removed (60, 61) . The first 6 bases of each sequence, corresponding to the random hexamer used to tag library molecules, were trimmed from sequences. Snake sequences were then filtered using the BLASTN alignment tool (version 2.2.21 [17] ) to query a database composed of a draft (assembly 1) of the boa constrictor genome (16) . Sequences aligning with an expect value of less than 10 \u03ea8 were filtered. Similarly, sequences that aligned with the Illumina adapter sequences (see Table S1 in the supplemental material) or to X174 control sequence were removed. This filtering removed between 90 and 97% of sequences. The remaining sequences were searched against databases of viral protein sequences using the BLASTX algorithm, and sequences matching any viral protein sequence with an expect value of less than 2 were further examined. False positives were eliminated by using BLAST to align putative viral sequences to the NCBI nonredundant nucleotide (nt) and protein (nr) databases. Only sequences whose best hit and whose pair's best hit were to viral sequences were further considered. The PRICE de novo targeted genome assembler was used to generate initial contiguous virus sequences (G. Ruby; freely available at: http://derisilab.ucsf.edu /software/price/index.html).
