In order to understand their transmission dynamics, it is crucial, even from a 9 human health perspective, to investigate how host traits influence their prevalence. Bats are 10 important reservoirs for Adenoviruses, and here we use the results of recent screenings in 11 Western Europe to evaluate the association between characteristic traits of bat species and their 12 probability of hosting Adenoviruses, taking into account their phylogenetic relationships. Across 13 species, we found an important phylogenetic component in the presence of Adenoviruses and 14 mating strategy as the most determinant factor conditioning the prevalence of Adenoviruses 15 across bat species. Contrary to other more stable mating strategies (e.g. harems), swarming could 16 hinder transmission of Adenoviruses since this strategy implies that contacts between individuals 17 are too short. Alternatively, bat species with more promiscuous behavior may develop a stronger 18 immune system. Outstandingly high prevalence of Adenoviruses was reported for the Iberian 19",

The GLMM analysis revealed a significantly 170 higher AdVs presence for males (z= 2.067, p=0.039) in N. lasiopterus (Fig 3A) , and a trend 171 towards higher AdVs prevalence for individuals with smaller forearm (Fig 3B) When analyzing the effect on the AdVs presence of within-species variance in traits, we 229 found that the site of capture explains an important part of the variance of all models suggesting 230 an underlying general pattern across species and supporting the contact-rate hypothesis. This 231 trend is particularly clear for Pipistrellus pygmaeus, whose sampling localities are more 232 widespread along the Iberian Peninsula than those for Nyctalus lasiopterus and P. kuhlii (Fig 4) . Species with fewer than 10 samples were eliminated from the matrix and from the phylogeny.",

Such 188 mechanisms are key in the process of host switching that cause the appearance of emerging 189 diseases and therefore its understanding is important to improve disease managements [35]. Our 190 results show that Adenoviruses seem to be quite common in European bats since they were 191 found across all the studied tribes and in most genera (except for Barbastella and Miniopterus) 192 but their prevalence varied considerably among species [16].

In their study, Webber et al. [32] had a wider perspective and focused on overall viral 207 richness in bats, whereas this study is centered exclusively on AdVs and so our differing results that Adenoviruses use different transmission pathways than other viruses. 209Transmission of respiratory AdVs in humans requires close contact although it can possibly 210 occur through droplet spray (such as those produced by coughing or sneezing) and/or aerosols, 211 but data are still limited[27][28][29]. In general, little is known about transmission mechanisms of 212 Adenoviruses and to our knowledge, no study has focused on this particular aspect across bats,213    although the host species specificity found for most of the Adenoviruses in bats[16] points to 214 cross-species contacts as rare events.215 Counterintuitively, species engaging in swarming behavior were found to have 216 significantly lower prevalence of Adenoviruses than other bats despite having theoretically 217 greater chances of contact. Swarming related to mating is shown mainly by forest species and is 218 described as the gathering of bats, commonly in caves and underground sites, during a few hours 219 after dusk and for a few days [36]. Two hypotheses could explain this finding. Firstly, bat 220 species engaging in swarming seem to be in contact for only a short time, which would imply a 221 lower chance of transmission compared to bats with polygynous mating systems, like harems, 222 which stay in contact for longer periods of time, sometimes all year around [37]. A second 223 plausible hypothesis is based on the fact that mammals with high infection risk, especially those 224 with promiscuous behavior, develop a stronger immune system compared to species with low 225 infection risk [38,39]. Thus, it seems reasonable that bats with swarming behavior may show 226 stronger immune response protecting them from infections, despite being very costly and even 227 represent a trade-off with other life-history traits [39].",

This result is particularly interesting 240 since it could affect the general dynamics of the virus given the generally predominant role 241 played by males in dispersal [43]. The possibility of a sex byes infection as a general pattern 242 should be explored further in other bat species and could be related to the trade-off between 243 immune function and reproduction, making males more susceptible to virus infections during 244 reproductive season due to the immune-suppressant effect of testosterone production [44]. 245 Our results show that, individuals with smaller forearm are more likely to be infected by 246 Adenoviruses for Pipistrellus kuhlii. Subadult bats usually have slightly longer forearms [34] and 247 the lower prevalence in bats with larger measures could be explained by the influence of the 248 antibody loads transferred to them through their mother's milk in still developing bats, making 249 them less suitable to Adenoviruses prevalence [45]. This is just a possibility and further studies 250 should help understand the relationships between Adenoviruses presence and age. 251 In sum, our findings highlight a common occurrence of Adenoviruses in European bats 252 and provide evidence of the importance of mating behavior in the prevalence of Adenoviruses, 253 contrary to what has been suggested generally for viruses. Besides, the three European bats 254 species that had higher Adenovirus prevalence do not show any common pattern, pointing to 255 Adenoviruses transmission as a complex process. Our study highlights the importance of 256 combining behavioral with ecological traits in explaining viral richness and transmission.",

Bats were 271 mist-netted near roosts or over water and released in the same collecting point after sampling. 272 Each animal was identified, sexed, measured and weighed. Sampling consisted of obtaining a 273 membrane wing-punch, saliva with oropharyngeal swabs and stool samples (when this was 274 possible). Swabs were stored in 1.5 mL tubes filled with lysis buffer. All samples were aliquoted 275 and stored at -80 \u00b0C prior to analysis. Samples were screened for AdVs following published 276 protocols [16,47,48]. Our own database was completed with the published data of AdVs 277 presence in bats from Germany and Hungary [25,26]. The identification of bats belonging to 278 species complexes was confirmed through PCR amplification of a diagnostic mtDNA fragment 279 following Iba\u00f1ez et al., [49] and Ka\u0148uch et al. resolved phylogeny containing all the study species was not available from the 282 literature and is notoriously difficult to reconstruct for this group, [51] and so a hybrid approach 283 was taken whereby, published trees were grafted to obtain a full-solved topology whereas branch 284 lengths were estimated using molecular sequence data. The published phylogenetic studies for 285 the four families existing in Europe, used to manually construct a topology of all species in this 286 study were Guill\u00e9n-Servent et al., [52] for relationship in the family Rhinolophidae; Ruedi et al., 287 [53] and Stadelmann et al. [54] for the subfamily Myotinae within Vespertilionidae; and Hoofer 288 and Bussche [55] for the rest of this last family and for the family Miniopteridae. Complete 289 sequences of the mitochondrial genes cytochrome b (CYTB) and NADH dehydrogenase 1 (ND1) 290 were obtained from GenBank for all available European species and were used to estimate 291 branch length in the constructed topology. This dataset needed to generate sequences de novo for 292 the species Miniopterus schreibersii for which these markers were not available. The new 293 sequences are deposited in GenBank under the accession numbers MK737740 and MK737741. 294 For each locus sequences were aligned with the software 'ALTER' from 295 http://darwin.uvigo.es/software/ [56] and MEGA [57], and partitionfinder v2.1.1 [58] was run on 296 the concatenated alignment (1805 base pairs in length) to obtain the optimal partitioning scheme 297 and substitution models. Partitionfinder was set to use unlinked branch lengths, search only 298 BEAST models with the 'greedy' algorithm and AICc as the model selection criterion. A 299 maximum of six possible partitions were allowed; the three codon positions of the two loci. 300 BEAST v2.4.7 [59] was then fed the alignment and the fixed topology, and using a relaxed clock 301 log normal model with exponential priors on the mean (mean=10) and standard deviation 302 (mean=0.33), was allowed to estimate the branch lengths over 20 million MCMC iterations, 303 storing every 1000th. Chain diagnostics was performed using Tracer v1.7 [60] to ensure 304 sufficient mixing and parameter convergence and a maximum clade credibility tree was 305 generated using TreeAnnotator v.2.4.7 (part of BEAST package) using a 10% burn-in and 306 median node heights. s D, Pagel's \u03bb and Blomberg's K parameters were used to estimate the strength of 308 the phylogenetic signal affecting the pattern of AdVs presence across European bats. Fritz's D 309 was used for binary data (presence/absence) so that values close to one indicate that the 310 distribution of the binary trait is random with respect to the given phylogeny and values close to 311 zero indicate the trait is distributed as expected under a Brownian motion model of evolution 312 [61]. When the variable estimated was the proportion of infected bats in each species, Pagel's \u03bb 313 and Blomberg's K parameters were used. Values of \u03bb range from zero to one where \u03bb = 0 314 indicates that related species do not share similar values for the trait (percentage of infection) and 315 \u03bb = 1 indicates a pattern fully explained by the phylogenetic relationships under Brownian 316 motion, with related species showing similar values for the given trait. Finally, K is scaled so that 317 zero indicates no phylogenetic signal, K=1 is the expected value for trait evolution under 318 Brownian motion and values higher than one suggest stronger phylogenetic signal than predicted 319 by Brownian motion [62,63].",

            "text": "mammals [17]. In fact, bats occupy all kinds of habitats throughout all continents except Antarctica, showing a surprising ecological breadth that implies large variation in trait characteristics either in their morphology: e.g. size variation across species [18]; social behavior: 73 e.g. differences in mating system [19]; or habitat requirements: e.g. roosts preferences from trees to caves [18]. For all these reasons, bats provide a good model to inspect the correlation of host trait characteristics with the prevalence of viruses. Adenoviruses (AdVs) are non-enveloped dsDNA viruses with a broad range of vertebrate hosts, including humans. These viruses have been grouped into five genera [20]: Mastadenovirus Atadenovirus (mammals, birds and reptiles), Aviadenovirus (birds), Siadenovirus 79 (poultry and amphibians) and Ichtadenovirus (fish). Symptoms in humans include respiratory, eye infections and intestinal or digestive illness and seldom lead to mortality [21,22]. Since the first detection of an AdV in a fruit bat from Japan [23], a high diversity of AdVs has been isolated from bats from America, Africa and Asia, all grouped within the genus Mastadenovirus 83 [24]. The first AdV in a European bat was isolated from a common pipistrelle (Pipistrellus pipistrellus) in Germany [25]. Later, Vidovszky et al. [26] obtained partial sequences from as many as 28 presumably new AdVs hosted by 12 different bat species in Germany and Hungary.Iglesias-Caballero et al.[16] conducted a country-wide survey in Spain constituting the largest screening for AdVs in bats to date, checking >1,000 individuals belonging to 28 species and",

Fritz's D, Pagel's \u03bb and Blomberg's K parameters were estimated with the packages 'Caper' [66] and 'Phytools'[67]. Phylogenetic linear regressions were carried out with the package 'Phylolm' [68] that respects the shared evolutionary histories of species [69]. Models of trait evolution were compared assuming correlation structures under either Brownian motion, Ornstein-Uhlenbeck or Pagel models [70] and the best model was selected based on the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) 349 [71]. As a threshold value for model selection, a model showing \u2206AIC > 3 was taken as having greater support [72]. Complementary, a binary phylogenetic generalized linear model was run for each species, with presence of AdVs as the dependent variable and using the 'Ape' package 352 [73]. Within species, we used general linear mixed models implemented in the 'Lme4' package 354[74] to test for associations between traits and presence of AdVs, and considering AdVs presence as a binary dependent variable. In order to account for uncontrolled spatial variation, LOCALITY was included in the models as a random variable. The best linear mixed model was. CC-BY 4.0 International license author/funder.

As a confirmatory analysis for the models, the variance explained by only the fixed variables was compared to the variance obtained including the random variables using the package 'Mumin' [75] At both among-species and within-species levels, inter-correlation was were checked using a Pearson's correlation test for continuous variables and an ANOVA for categorical variables. The spatial distribution of the AdVs positive bats was inspected by performing a Mantel test between the matrix of geographic distances and the matrix of differences in proportion of infection between sites with the package 'Ade4' [76,77].
