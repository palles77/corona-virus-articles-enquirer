            "text": "Background: Infection prevention and control education for hospital-based health care personnel has differed across organizations because of a lack of identified practice competencies. This gap also has resulted in variation of the educational curriculum in the academic setting and a lack of consistent preparation for emergency responses. The purpose of this study was to develop a list of competencies and measurable activities, or terminal objectives, for hospital-based health care personnel applicable for use during routine patient care activities as well as during natural and man-made disasters. Methods: Competencies and terminal objectives related to infection prevention and control were developed using an evidencebased approach comprising the following steps: (a) review of the literature, (b) review of existing competencies and published curricula/training objectives, (c) synthesis of new competencies and terminal objectives, (d) expert panel review and competency refinement using the Delphi survey process, and (e) delineation of competencies by occupation. The 8 disciplines addressed were nurses (RNs and LPNs), nursing assistants, physicians, respiratory therapists, physical and occupational therapists, environmental services, laboratory professionals, and ancillary staff. Results: An initial list of competency statements and terminal objectives were compiled and then vetted by a Delphi panel of experts in infection prevention and control until . 80% agreement was achieved on all competency statements and terminal objectives. Conclusion: The final matrix of competencies and terminal objectives developed through this process may be used as a content framework for educational curricula and training materials for hospital-based health care personnel. The process also may be of use in determining the core competencies and terminal objectives regarding infection prevention and control for health care personnel in other settings. Validation of these results is an important next step. (Am J Infect Control",

            "text": "The spread of infectious organisms within health care environments affects patients, health care personnel, and the community. Ongoing transmission of multidrug-resistant organisms (MDROs), such as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), Clostridium difficile, and multidrug-resistant gramnegative organisms; documented episodes of influenza transmission between patients and health care personnel; and the historical record of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) transmission all demonstrate the effects and risk of infection transmission during day-to-day patient care activities as well as during emergency responses. Klevens et al 1 stressed the impact of health care-associated infection (HAI) as a major public health challenge by noting that in 2002, HAI was the number-one reportable disease. Despite the broad impact of infection transmission, there remains no clearly articulated comprehensive plan of action for the education and training of health care personnel regarding infection prevention. Various guiding documents outline strategies for preventing various types of HAIs, but fundamental infection prevention core competencies that each health care worker must master as part of routine and emergent care situations have not yet been identified. As US hospitals continue to work toward pandemic preparedness, there is an increased sense of urgency in identifying ways to improve infection prevention and control practices in all health care environments. A fundamental change in the process is needed. To effect this change, infection prevention core competencies for hospital workers must be identified and used as the framework for training and education of health care personnel.",

            "text": "The issue of health care workers' competence has been raised in both the public and private health care sectors. Several research teams have worked to define competence in the area of emergency preparedness. Gebbie and Merrill 2 defined a competency as a combination of knowledge, attitude, and skills demonstrated by the health care worker. Hsu et al 3 asserted that competency statements are broad and that activities associated with the statements are needed; as a result, they used the term ''terminal objective'' and defined it as the measurable performance after completion of a set of instructions. Gebbie and Merrill 2 emphasized the importance of competencies involving emergency response and public health workers. Hsu et al 3 expanded on this area of research and described competencies for health care workers during disasters. The need for workforce competence has been addressed by the National Public Health Performance Standards Program, a collaborative effort among 7 national public health organizations. This group outlined essential functions for public health systems, with function 8 having a stated goal of ensuring a competent workforce. 4 In the private health care industry, accreditation standards outlined by such organizations as the Joint Commission focus on the need for health care facilities to ensure workforce competence as a means of ensuring patient safety. 5 In 2006, Henderson 6 surveyed Canadian infection control professionals regarding their opinion of the necessary infection prevention competencies of Canadian health care workers. Her work is of particular importance in light of the impact of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) on the Canadian health care workforce. The work of these research teams highlights the importance of identifying core competencies for US health care personnel and the existing gap regarding the definition of those core competencies related to infection prevention practices for routine care as well as during a naturally occurring or man-made emergency.",

Quality improvement efforts have led to closer examination of how health care workers are trained. To be successful, health care workers must be able to transfer new knowledge and consistently apply it across the continuum of care and care settings. Identification of specific elements of practice that have the force of evidence behind them has not been delineated as the basis for comprehensive infection prevention training in either practice or academic settings. Health care facilities struggle to provide orientation and subsequent skill validation for new and experienced health care worker employees, often in an abbreviated format lacking standard elements, then lament that the new employees have not received sufficient training in their academic programs to allow them to practice infection prevention at the desired (albeit undefined) level.",

The online survey was developed using Zoomerang (MarketTools, San Francisco, CA). Each competency and terminal objective was measured on a 4-point Likert scale (1 5 agree/important; 2 5 disagree/not important; 3 5 neutral/no opinion; 4 5 undecided). There was also space for panel members to edit wording and provide comments on the various statements; for example, a panelist could note that in his or her opinion, a specific terminal objective was best matched to another competency statement or note that multiple competency statements were redundant. The scores for each competency and terminal objective were averaged, and narrative comments were evaluated. Agreement of $ 80% was required to keep a competency or terminal objective; narrative comments were incorporated into the competency or terminal objective when applicable. New draft competencies and terminal objectives were developed based on findings from the Delphi process. In this step, a summary document containing all comments from the previous iteration and a revised version of the competency statements and terminal objectives were sent to each panelist. This provided them with the opportunity to see comments and assess changes in the new version in preparation for completing the next survey. A link to an updated survey was sent to each panelist the following week. This process was repeated in July and again in September 2007, for a total of 3 iterations. To support the questions or comments of any panelist, optional teleconferences were scheduled to facilitate discussion. The investigators remained in e-mail contact with all panelists as a means of capturing any comments tht a panel member wished to relay in a confidential manner and to maintain cohesion.",

This project resulted in a set of IPC competencies that await testing in real-world settings and for hospital-based health care worker education. Overall, the competencies identified in this study are very similar to those identified for Canadian health care workers. 6 Two advantages to the competencies identified through this study are the delineation of competencies by health care worker groups and the identification of terminal objectives that can be used to measure health care worker performance. Another unique finding in this study was the need for a competency that addresses health care preparedness for natural or man-made infectious disease disasters. Bioterrorism and pandemic preparedness efforts tend to focus on facility or community readiness, but often fail to identify the individual health care worker's role in preparing for such an event. Given the impact of SARS, the 2001 anthrax bioterrorism incident, and extensive influenza pandemic planning in the United States, it is obvious that this competency must be incorporated into hospital-based health care worker training programs if we expect hospitals to be prepared for an infectious disease disaster.",

Translation and dissemination of these competencies into educational programs across all settings and disciplines are also needed. Subsequent steps also should involve communicating these competencies to policy leaders and professional organizations in each of the hospital-based health care worker disciplines and developing discipline-specific curricula. Each discipline will require modified educational content specific to their job function as outlined by the study. A competency-based approach to health care worker training provides the framework on which this flexible training can be based. The terminal objectives identified in this project also could be used to assess health care worker performance and ensure that training has been successful and that proper infection prevention strategies are being implemented. A combination of individual and peer monitoring may be used to maximize the assessment of perceived and actual behavior. As the IPC competencies are translated and disseminated into educational programs and curricula, these training materials must be validated through a structured evaluation process that includes measurement of the behavioral change in the practice setting. In this way, educational content can be standardized to ensure maximum effectiveness.",

To accomplish this necessary validation, future work should include developing curricula designed to address the necessary knowledge and skill elements, identifying metrics specific to the health care discipline, and evaluating the health care worker's ability to apply the knowledge in his or her specific field and environment. Ensuring that every hospital-based health care worker is competent to prevent infection transmission is an essential element for daily practice as well as during times of emergency.
