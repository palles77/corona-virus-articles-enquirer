Since a live attenuated or inactivated HIV vaccine is not likely to be approved for clinical application due to safety concerns, HIV virus like particles (VLPs) offer an attractive alternative because they are considered safer since they lack viral genome. We got a stable eukaryotic cell line by G418 resistance selection, engineered to express the HIV-1 structure protein Gag and Env efficiently and stably. We confirmed the presence of Gag and Env proteins in the cell culture supernatant and that they could self-assemble into VLPs. These VLPs were found to be able to elicit specific humoral and cellular immune response after immunization without any adjuvant.",

At present, there is no vaccine against HIV approved for clinical use. There are three obstacles that hinder creation of an HIV-1 vaccine: viral diversity, immune system evasion, and the lack of appropriate animal models for vaccine evaluation [1] . A major approach used to overcome viral immune evasion is to exploit the conserved regions of HIV-1 proteins, for example, the conserved sites of envelope glycoprotein gp120 critical for binding to CD4 as well as co-receptors, or the envelope (transmembrane) protein gp41 co-receptor binding site [2] [3] [4] [5] . Inducing production of broadly reactive Mabs could potentially counteract HIV-1 diversity. These two potential solutions of HIV-1 vaccine development could potentially be realized by exploiting prophylactic HIV-1 virus-like particle (VLP) vaccines [6] .",

As non-infectious, replication-deficient particles, VLPs are much safer compared to traditional vaccines made by chemically inactivated or attenuated live viruses. The different forms of VLPs have distinct properties [7] [8] [9] [10] . Only enveloped VLPs display full-length proteins with proper folding on their surface and closely mimic native envelope trimeric structures [7, 11, 12] . The immune system responds well to particular antigens that are similar to immature HIV-1 viruses [13] . VLPs antigens are processed and present antigens through the major histocompatibility (MHC) class II pathway as well as the MHC class I endogenous pathway, inducing both CD4-and CD8-T-cell-mediated immune responses [14] [15] [16] . Therefore, VLPs can effectively induce both humoral and cellular immune reactions. It is also widely accepted that a rational vaccine design should have the potential to block the initial step of infection. In this respect, VLP-based vaccines are a promising type of recombinant protein vaccine.",

The main structural proteins Gag, pol and Env of a common China HIV-1 strain were cloned into this expression vector, with Gag fused to the N terminal of Pol as described [23] . All plasmid cloning was consistent with USA FDA clinical trial safety controls. Briefly, HEK293 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified minimal essential medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (HyClone Laboratories, Logan, UT, USA). D-GPEi and pcDNA3.1(\uf02d) plasmids were cotransfected into 293 cells using Lipofectamine-2000.

These two proteins could be packaged into virus particles wherein the particle also contained luciferase. Such a particle is referred to as a pseudotype virus since it cannot replicate, but can infect HOS-CD4-CCR5 cells and the infection level could be detected by quantifying luciferase activity. The neutralization level could be evaluated by co-incubating blood samples and cotransfected supernatants and observing the change in luciferase. Our results showed that 0.5 \uf06dg of VLPs could induce neutralizing antibody and that antibody levels increased as the immunizing dose increased. These antibodies could also counteract the infectivity of the pseudotype virus. The epitopes of the neutralizing antibodies resided mainly in Pr55gag and gp120.

VLPs have the potential for activating both endogenous and exogenous antigen processing pathways, leading to presentation of viral peptides by MHC class I and class II molecules. These multi-epitope vaccines are more likely than their single component counterparts to generate a broad-based immune response capable of clearing HIV-1 immune evasion mutants. VLPs may be more cost efficient than co-inoculating multiple single gene vaccines for future Phase I clinical trials. Another advantage of VLPs compared to single recombinant protein vaccines is the ability of VLPs to bind and enter cells expressing appropriate receptors. HIV-1 VLPs are able to bind to CD4 and chemokine receptors via gp120, and to enter into professional antigen presenting cells such as macrophages and dendritic cells (both cell types express CD4 and CCR5). After infection, viral proteins can be processed and presented on MHC class I molecules, therefore promoting presentation to T cells by APCs. In addition, cell-free VLPs bound with antibodies can be taken up by phagocytic cells via Fc receptors, thus increasing MHC class II presentation. VLPs have been expressed in Baculovirus expression systems [25] and Saccharomyces cerevisiae [26, 27] . These systems produce large amounts of particles from eukaryotic cells. However, they are usually limited to expressing only one gene, and therefore are not easily used to produce multigene VLPs. In addition, in order for particles to bud from yeast, the outer membrane needs to be removed.",

We took advantage of gag self-assembly and co-expressed gag and env to produce VLPs. Our approach demonstrated that this cell line could not only produce stable VLPs, but also secrete significant quantities of VLPs into the supernatant. The VLPs produced by our method without viral nucleic acid are not only safer, but also induce a strong humoral and cellular immune response, and provide a foundation for improving HIV vaccination.
