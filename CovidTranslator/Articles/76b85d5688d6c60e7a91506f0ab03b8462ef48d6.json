The viral papain-like proteases (PLPs) are critical for processing the amino-terminal end of the replicase and are attractive targets for antiviral therapies. With the analysis of the papain-like protease of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), came the realization of the multifunctional nature of these enzymes. Structural and enzymatic studies revealed that SARS-CoV PLpro can act as both a protease to cleave peptide bonds and also as a deubiquitinating (DUB) enzyme to cleave the isopeptide bonds found in polyubiquitin chains. Furthermore, viral DUBs can also remove the protective effect of conjugated ubiquitin-like molecules such as interferon stimulated gene 15 (ISG15). Extension of these studies to other coronaviruses and arteriviruses led to the realization that viral protease/DUB activity is conserved in many family members. Overexpression studies revealed that viral protease/DUB activity can modulate or block activation of the innate immune response pathway. Importantly, mutations that alter DUB activity but not viral protease activity have been identified and arteriviruses expressing DUB mutants stimulated higher levels of acute inflammatory cytokines after infection. Further understanding of the multifunctional nature of the Nidovirus PLP/DUBs may facilitate vaccine development. Here, we review studies describing the PLPs' enzymatic activity and their role in virus pathogenesis.",

            "text": "How do you pack a lot of information into a small space? This is the challenge for all microbes and analysis of viral genomes reveals interesting strategies of genetic economy. Positive strand RNA viruses employ genetic economy by encoding polyproteins that are processed by viral proteases during replication. This strategy minimizes genome size by allowing for the expression of multiple protein products from a single open reading frame. An additional twist to this genetic economy is that the viral protease itself may be multifunctional, i.e. the protease may act on both viral and host cell proteins. Hepatitis C virus encodes a polyprotein that is processed by a viral protease, NS3/4a, that also cleaves host cell mitochondrial associated viral sensor (MAVS), thus inactivating the innate immune response to viral infection (1) . Poliovirus 2A protease processes the viral polyprotein and host cell factor eIF4G, which shifts the ribosomes from cap-dependent to cap-independent translation, whereas 3C protease cleaves poly(A)-binding protein to facilitate the complete host translation shutoff (2, 3) . Here, we focus on coronaviruses and arteriviruses, two families of positive strand RNA viruses in the order Nidovirales, and review recent findings illuminating the mutifuctionality of the papain-like proteases (PLPs) encoded in the replicase polyproteins. For these viruses, PLPs play a critical role in processing the aminoterminal portion of the replicase polyprotein and are attractive targets for antiviral drug development. In addition, structural studies have revealed a striking similarity of the viral PLPs to cellular deubiquitinating enzymes (DUBs), which are involved in regulation of the innate immune response to viral infection. This raises the question of the multifunctional potential of Nidovirus PLPs and their role in antagonism of the innate immune response to viral replication. In this review we discuss current knowledge on the multifunctionality of PLPs encoded within coronaviruses and arteriviruses genomes and their potential role in viral pathogenesis (summarized in table 1).",

            "text": "The Coronaviridae is a family of enveloped, positive strand RNA viruses with very large genomes ranging in size from 28 to 32 kilobases. Coronaviruses were identified as etiologic agents of respiratory, gastrointestinal and neurologic diseases in humans and other animals. Coronaviruses are now notorious for emerging from animal reservoirs into the human population, sometimes with pandemic potential. In 2002, the coronavirus responsible for the pandemic of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) emerged from Chinese horseshoe bats, and through an intermediate host (likely civet cats), into humans. This resulted in over 8000 infections with 10% mortality (4). The SARS pandemic was controlled by public health measures of isolating infected individuals and their contacts which disrupted the chain of human to human transmission. Since 2012, a coronavirus designated Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) has been detected in 178 patients with a reported mortality of 43% (5). MERS-CoV-like sequences have been detected in bats suggesting bats as a potential reservoir of the virus (6). In addition, camels have been implicated as a potential intermediate host since the discovery of MERS-CoV neutralizing antibodies and infectious virus in dromedary camels (7) (8) (9) . Additional endemic human coronaviruses that cause respiratory tract disease include: HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43, which cause common colds; HCoV-NL63, which has been associated with croup in children; and HCoV-HKU1, associated with lower respiratory tract infection and pneumonia in the elderly. Coronaviruses are also important pathogens of livestock and pets including transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) (pigs), porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) (pigs); bovine coronavirus (cows); infectious bronchitis virus (chickens); feline coronavirus (cats); and canine coronavirus (dogs). Interestingly, we now recognize that bats harbor diverse strains of coronaviruses, and these bat viruses may be the ancestors of the \"species specific\" viruses (10) . The identification of a common therapeutic target in the genomes of coronaviruses may allow for the development of a broad spectrum antiviral therapy to existing and potentially emerging coronaviruses.",

            "text": "All coronaviruses replicate in the cytoplasm of infected cells through the action of the viral replicase complex. The coronavirus replicase is produced upon translation of the incoming RNA genome. The replicase gene contains two open reading frames, ORF1a and ORF1b, which are connected by a frame shift region allowing for translation of the ORF1ab polyprotein. The replicase polyproteins, designated pp1a and pp1ab, are processed into 16 non-structural proteins (nsps) by two or three, depending on the coronavirus, viral proteases. The PLPs are responsible for the cleavage of the amino-terminal portion of the polyprotein. Coronavirus PLP activity was identified by in vitro transcription/translation studies of genomic RNA and the recognition that the polyprotein product was processed by an encoded protease domain (11) . Site-directed mutagenesis and deletion studies reveal that for the model coronavirus, mouse hepatitis virus (MHV), there are two PLP domains with PLP1 processing the polyprotein between nsp1/nsp2 and nsp2/nsp3 (12) (13) (14) (15) . Further expression studies of MHV ORF1a revealed that the PLP2 domain processes the polyprotein at the nsp3/nsp4 site using a recognition site of LXGG (16) . Similar studies of other coronaviruses revealed the existence of either one or two PLP domains that were required for processing the amino-terminal region of the replicase polyprotein ( Fig. 1) . SARS-CoV encodes only one PLP domain termed PLpro within nsp3 which cleaves the replicase polyprotein at the junctions between nsp1/nsp2, nsp2/nsp3, and nsp3/nsp4 through recognition of a LXGG motif (17) . For the recently emerged MERS-CoV the cleavage sites recognized by the PLpro are predicted and await experimental validation (18) . However, Kilianski and co-workers showed that MERS-CoV PLpro can recognize an LXGG motif similarly to SARS-CoV PLpro (19) . It has been shown that when two PLP domains are encoded within the coronavirus replicase polyprotein, the PLP2 has similar characteristics to SARS-CoV PLpro and recognizes the LXGG motif ( Fig. 1 ). Coronavirus PLP2 domains are known to or predicted to cleave between nsp3 and nsp4, whereas the cleavage between nsp1/nsp2 and nsp2/nsp3 is usually mediated by the PLP1 domain. Interestingly, gamma-and deltacoronaviruses encode one PLpro domain within nsp2 that is predicted to cleave between nsp1/nsp2 and nsp2/nsp3.",

Ubiquitination is a post translational modification of proteins that allows for the addition of ubiquitin molecules to a specific lysine residue within the target protein in an ATP-dependent reaction. This system is mediated by three enzymes: an E1 ubiquitin-activating enzyme, an E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme, and an E3 ubiquitin ligase. These enzymes might add one (monoubiquitination) or several (polyubiquitination) ubiquitin moieties to a target protein. The ubiquitin molecules in the polyubiquitin chain can be covalently linked via any of the seven lysine residues present within ubiquitin. Several types of polyubiquitination have been characterized [reviewed in (21) ]. The form of ubiquitin linkage determines the fate of the modified protein and influences its function. Three types of polyubiquitination are known to be involved in the regulation of the innate immune signaling pathways: Lys48-linked Ub (K-48-Ub), Lys63-linked Ub (K-63-Ub), and linear polyubiquitination. K-63 linked ubiquitin and linear ubiquitin modifications are associated with activation of proteins in certain innate immune signaling cascades. In contrast, K-48 linked polyubiquitination is a signal that directs proteins for proteosomal degradation. Removal of ubiquitin from cellular targets is mediated by cellular enzymes called deubiquitinases (DUBs) (22) . DUBs recognize the RLRGG motif that links ubiquitin chains and remove ubiquitin conjugates from cellular proteins.",

The structure of SARS-CoV PLpro displays a thumb-palm-fingers architecture resembling cellular ubiquitin specific proteases (USPs) ( Fig. 2A) (26) . Structural superposition of SARS-CoV PLpro with USP14 resulted in a pairwise root-mean-square-deviation (RMSD) of 3.6 \u00c5 over 198 aligned backbone C\u03b1, although the sequence identity between these two proteins is only around 10%. The active site of SARS-CoV PLpro consists of a canonical Cys-His-Asp catalytic triad, which is in a similar position to that of USP14 ( Fig. 2A) . In contrast to some USPs, including USP14 and HAUSP, whose fingers domains consist of a Cys4-type-like zinc ribbon without zinc (27, 28) , the fingers domain of SARS-CoV PLpro contains a zinc finger with four cysteines tetrahedrally coordinating a zinc atom (26) . Moreover, the zinc-binding ability seems to be essential for SARS-CoV PLpro activity, as supported by mutagenesis studies (24) . Such dependence on zinc seems to be conserved among coronaviral PLPs as zinc binding has also been observed for other PLPs, including TGEV PLP1 and HCoV-229E PLP1 (29, 30) .",

ISG15 is an interferon stimulated di-ubiquitin-like molecule that can be linked to cellular targets via a mechanism termed ISGylation (39). Similar to ubiquitination, ISGylation requires the activity of E1, E2, and E3 enzymes, and the process is reversible (deISGylation). Several screens have identified cellular targets of ISGylation including molecules important for the activation of innate immune response, particularly RIG-I, JAK1, STAT1, PKR, and MxA [reviewed in (40) ]. The exact mechanism of how modification with ISG15 influences these proteins' activity is not well characterized; however, ISGylation is important for protection and clearance of viral infections. It has been shown that ISG15 knock-out mice are more susceptible to infection with influenza, herpes and Sindbis viruses, than are wild-type mice (41, 42) . Coronavirus encoded PLPs, in addition to DUB activity, have also been shown to be able to remove IGS15 conjugates from cellular targets, an activity which might also contribute to virus pathogenesis.",

Co-expression of PLpro with stimulators of interferon (IFN) activation such as RIG-I, MAVS, TRIF, TBK1 or IKK\u03b5 reduced IFN\u03b2 induction. In contrast, PLpro was not able to inhibit IFN\u03b2 induced by expression of a dominant active form of IRF3. The authors showed that PLpro can downregulate phosphorylation of IRF3 and prevent IRF3 dimer formation. Furthermore, the authors were able to co-immunoprecipitate IRF3 with transiently expressed PLpro, and colocalization of IRF3 and nsp3/PLpro during SARS-CoV infection (44) . Subsequently, Frieman and co-workers also showed that PLpro inhibits the IFN response. In addition, the authors showed that PLpro can inhibit NF-\u03baB-luciferase activity by stabilizing I\u03ba B\u03b1, a molecule that has to be degraded in order to release the transcription factor NF-\u03baB, which activates proinflammatory responses (34) . Later studies showed that PLpro can block TNF\u03b1-induced NF-\u03baB activation, and further that this block can be removed when the cells are treated with a PLpro inhibitor, revealing a possible antiviral strategy (32) . Furthermore, a recent analysis showed that expression of SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV PLpro decreases endogenous RNA levels of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines in activated cells (37) .",

The amino-terminal region of the ORF1 is processed by two or three PLP domains. The PLP encoded within the amino-terminal region of nsp2, termed PLP2 or P2, has a similar function as SARS-CoV PLpro [ (45) and reviewed in (46) ]. The sequence recognized by this protease domain is only partially conserved across the Arterivirus species. For example, EAV PLP2 recognizes the sequence LIGG, whereas PRRSV P2 can recognize cleavage sites containing either TTGG or PSGG. The partial conservation of the site cleaved by the arterivirus PLP2s, and its similarity to motifs recognized by cellular DUBs and deISGylating enzymes, led to the hypothesis that arterivirus P2s might be multifunctional enzymes.",

To address the possible role for nsp2 (N) DUB activity in the inhibition of innate immunity, the authors determined the ubiquitination status of RIG-I which requires K-63-linked polyubiquitination for activation. Studies have shown that DUB activity of nsp2 (N) from EAV can block RIG-I ubiquitination in a catalytic dependent manner (48) . This led to the hypothesis that EAV DUB activity might be important for blocking the innate immune response to viral infection. To test this hypothesis, it was critically important to obtain structural information on how the enzyme interacts with ubiquitin. With this information in hand, researchers can attempt to generate PLP2 mutants that retain protease activity but are impaired for interaction with ubiquitin.",

Structural overlay of EAV PLP2 with yeast OTU1 resulted in a RMSD of 3.3 A over 81 aligned C\u03b1 with only around 9% sequence identity. The Cys-His-Asn catalytic triad of EAV PLP2 resides in a structurally conserved region of OTU DUBs (Fig. 2B) . What is unique about the structure of EAV PLP2 is the presence of a zinc finger as a part of the OTU domain. This zinc finger is critical for the structural integrity and catalytic activity of EAV PLP2. The presence of a zinc finger has not been observed in other known OTU-like proteases. Thus, it has been proposed that EAV PLP2 may represent the first member of a new class of zinc-dependent OTUs (49) .",

Mutation of the ubiquitin-interacting residues of EAV PLP2 had no evident effect on protease activity but significantly reduced DUB activity in overexpression studies. To study the effect of the DUB mutant on virus replication and innate immunity, the authors used reverse genetics to recover two replication competent mutant viruses (a single mutant I353R and a triple mutant T312A/I313V/I353R in the EAV PLP2 domain) and showed that replication kinetics of these viruses were essentially identical to the wild-type virus. However, the viruses with the mutant PLP2 domain had lost the ability to deconjugate ubiquitin from cellular targets in virus-infected cells. In addition, cells infected with the EAV DUB mutant viruses generated an elevated innate immune response, particularly expression of IFN\u03b2, IL8, and MX1, suggesting that DUB activity is important for inhibition of the innate immune response (49) . The EAV DUB mutant study was the first study to demonstrate that viral protease and deubiquitinase functions can be separated. This is an important contribution because it opens the door for the study of viral DUB activity in vaccines and as a target for antiviral therapeutics.",

The proteolytic activity of PRRSV P2 has been well-studied (50, 51) and P2 has the ability to cleave ubiquitin conjugates from cellular targets (47) . Sun and co-workers showed that P2 had deubiquitinating activity in vitro and in cell culture. The authors showed that PRRSV P2 can block Sendai virus induced IFN\u03b2 and inhibit NF-\u03baB by preventing I\u03ba B\u03b1 degradation by its deubiquitination in cell culture. In addition, they generated several mutant versions of P2 that had reduced ability to inhibit NF-\u03baB-activation. To test if P2 can block NF-\u03baB activation in the context of the virus, the authors introduced these mutations into PRRSV. Although some of the mutations that altered P2 activity in vitro could not be recovered as viable virus, the authors did report two single amino acid P2 mutant viruses that showed decreased ability to inhibit NF-\u03baB-reporter activity and a decrease in the level of I\u03ba B\u03b1 in infected cells (52) . However, the authors did not address whether protease or DUB activity was responsible for the effect they observed in infected cells. The authors noticed that the mutant viruses had severe replication defects suggesting that P2 protease activity, as well as DUB activity, may have been impaired (52) .",

Furthermore, a report by Sun and co-workers showed that PRRSV P2 decreases endogenous ISG15 protein levels upon Sendai virus stimulation, and that it has deISGylating activity in cells culture (53) . Furthermore, the authors generated PRRSV P2 mutants that had reduced deISGylating activity. The first mutant had a 23 aa deletion in nsp2 (aa 402-424), the second mutant had a 19 aa deletion in nsp2 (aa 402-420), and the third mutant had the 19 aa deletion and additional point mutation (S462A). When cells were transfected with those mutants the endogenous levels of IGS15 was increased compared to cells transfected with wild-type version of P2. Interestingly, the processing of nsp2/nsp3 was not affected by the deletion or deletion/point mutations in the P2 domain of the virus. The authors were able to recover two viruses (19 aa deletion, and 19 aa deletion/S462A). The growth kinetics analysis showed that those two viruses do not replicate as efficiently as wild-type virus, which may be due to the inability to efficiently process the nsp2/nsp3 site in the replicase polyprotien (53) .

One of them is the papain-like protease, a multifunctional enzyme that can act as a potent protease, DUB, deISGylating enzyme, and antagonist of the innate immune response. Separating protease and DUB activities is needed to fully understand the role of these proteins during virus replication.
