            "text": "The recent innovations in sequencing technology have greatly advanced our knowledge of virus diversity [1, 2] . The systematic analysis of samples collected in our environment, including specimens from stool, saliva, respiratory tract, urine, blood and organs of wild animals has led to the realization that we are surrounded by an abundance of viruses. These include human, animal, and plant pathogens, viruses that keep bacterial populations in check, and multiple newly identified viruses for which the role in the ecosystem has yet to be discovered. With this, our notion of the virus world has fundamentally changed, certainly from the anthropomorphic perspective: there are vast numbers of viruses on our planet, and occasionally humans get ill when they are exposed. A huge challenge for the public health perspective is if and how we can predict which are the most serious concerns, and what drives emergence of viruses -that may have cohabited with their animal hosts for centuries -into the human population [2] . There are some examples from 2012 that illustrate this need: an outbreak of hantavirus in Yosemite that resulted in the death of 3 visitors who stayed at a specific area triggered a public health response in the US and in 39 other countries, following notification of all overnight visitors (>200 000) that had stayed in the park during the summer months [3, 4] . A total of 10 cases were identified. Similarly, a novel coronavirus causing a severe acute respiratory disease in humans in Saudi Arabia and neighboring countries triggered a full public health response because of the parallels with the emergence of SARS (most probably from bats), and the observation that a broad range of cells could be infected with this virus [5, 6] . These examples trigger the questions: what makes them jump species, what can we do to prevent that, and the million dollar question: how can we predict the zoonotic risk? How do we therefore assess the risks of finding viruses in our environment? [2, 7] .",

This field has dealt with the problems of contamination of food and water as a source of human illness for many years. Most research emphasis here lies on known human pathogens, particularly viruses that are shed in stools and through sewage discharge make it into the environment and back into the food chain. Knowledge of the risk assessment framework that is used to control the safety of our food may help identify research gaps for emerging diseases that potentially could transmit by the same routes. This notion was explored in great detail in a public workshop hosted by the Forum on Microbial Threats of the Institute of Medicine, US in 2011 [8] . This issue of Current Opinion in Virology focuses on a seemingly wide range of topics, all addressing viruses and viral diseases in which environmental transmission is crucial for their epidemiology and impact.",

Periodic overflows of sewage treatment plants, a situation that occurs regularly after heavy rain, may lead to contamination of environmental waters harboring shellfish production sites, for instance, but this contamination is not constant, and concentrations may be low. In addition, given the abundance of viruses in our environment, detecting mere presence of a virus or viral RNA or DNA is considered to be insufficient evidence for their potential public health impact, as viral genetic material may persist even when particles are no longer infectious. They describe the challenges (particularly at the level of sample preparation), and some interesting developments aiming at addressing the infectivity question.",

Again, this deals with mostly human pathogenic viruses, where the increasing awareness of their potential health risks has led to a push for testing of food items that are most often associated with viral disease outbreaks, such as shellfish, soft fruits, among others. The overwhelming presence of viral RNA in such products (the authors quote recent studies finding up about onethird of soft red fruits PCR positive, and even more of the leafy greens and shellfish samples tested) has triggered studies that try to improve the ability to predict if this presence will lead to human illness.",

This sector is one of the fastest growing food production industries, and a review of emerging infectious disease events has highlighted such changes as important risk factors for disease emergence. This is no different for the aquaculture business, which has been plagued with major disease outbreaks. Alexander Murray discusses the major viral diseases affecting salmon (alphaviruses, birnaviruses, and orthomyxoviruses) and reviews the factors that are known to contribute to viral transmission and spread. He also describes the approaches that have been developed to reduce the risk of disease emergence, and that have had some success in the control of bacterial diseases in the same environment.",

These hypotheses are not mutually exclusive, and it is conceivable that the evidence for either one may differ for different diseases. The perturbation hypothesis assumes that changes in the environment may disturb an equilibrium that is associated with lower risks of transmission of viruses from wildlife to humans. What exactly that equilibrium is may differ for each ecosystem and its components, including the animals and pathogens in there. The second hypothesis, the pathogen pool hypothesis, assumes that disease emergence related to change of land use is explained by increased exposure of humans (or animals, as intermediate hosts) to a rich pool of pathogens from which they were separated before the change occurred. Understanding the complex processes that drive disease emergence can inform risk-based surveillance strategies and might eventually lead to interventions.",

Bats rank at the top of the list, because the bat virome is highly complex and includes many viruses that are lethal to humans and other mammals. This unique balance of pathogens and hosts, and the specific questions raised on the functioning of the bat immune system are a hot area of research. In their contribution, Ina Smith and Linfa Wang focus on the public health implications of bat derived zoonoses, and review evidence on drivers for disease emergence from recent outbreaks. The example of Nipah virus further illustrates how important it is to understand disease ecology in detail: although originating initially from the same host, drivers for Nipah virus outbreaks in Malaysia differ fundamentally from those in Bangladesh, with respect to the mode of transmission of the virus from bats to humans (with pigs as an intermediate host in the Malaysia situation), and subsequent person to person transmission, observed in Bangladesh only, and linked to specific cultural practices. With that, recommendations for surveillance and control measures differ.",

Investigations following the recent increases in the incidence of hantavirus infections in parts of Europe have given some insights in factors that contribute to emergence, including some that could be used for early warning purposes.

The authors have listed important data gaps, for which research is needed before we can move from response to outbreaks to prediction and prevention.
