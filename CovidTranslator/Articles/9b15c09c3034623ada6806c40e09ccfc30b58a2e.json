            "text": "Respiratory monitoring Measurement of lung volume has always been a concern in patients receiving mechanical ventilation (MV), and complex methods have been proposed for clinical investigation. Patroniti et al. [1] described a simplified helium dilution technique to measure end-expiratory lung volume and compared it to computed tomography (CT) in 21 MV patients. The authors specifically studied the accuracy and precision of the method. A simple rebreathing gas was used to deliver at least ten usual tidal volumes. The agreement between the two methods was found very acceptable for clinical purposes. It was noted, however, that the higher the amount of hyperinflated tissue, the greater was the underestimation of lung volume by the helium dilution method. It has been well demonstrated that a frequent cause of repeated lung volume loss is endotracheal suctioning. This can induce derecruitment in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The effects of such maneuver were tested in ten patients with only mild to moderate lung failure by Fernandez et al. [2] . Three techniques were compared with or without preoxygenation. The authors found that reduction in lung volume during suctioning was similar with the quasiclosed and closed systems but significantly higher with the open system. They also observed that in these patients without severe lung disease these changes were transient and rapidly reversible within 10 min.",

[4] divided tidal expiration in different phases based on the analysis of expiratory flow-volume curves in ten patients with acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). They showed that the end of expiration is characterized by a lengthening of time constants, and that the addition of external positive endexpiratory pressure decreases resistance at the end of expiration and shortens time constants, thus facilitating equilibration between the external pressure and the alve-olar pressure. Although we already knew the effects of external positive end-expiratory pressure in such patients, this new method of exploration sheds new light on its mechanisms. A part of expiratory resistances can be caused by the endotracheal tube itself. In many cases its contribution is not huge. However, more and more studies suggest that over the course of MV the inner diameter of the tube may progressively decrease due to the permanent deposits of secretions. Using the acoustic reflectometry method Boqu\u00d8 et al. [5] prospectively assessed the inner volume reduction of 94 endotracheal tubes, used in 80 patients, and found this reduction to be extremely frequent. In almost one-fourth of the patients the real diameter of the tube was smaller than 7 mm. The clinical implications of such findings may be important, and further studies are needed on this topic.",

This variability depends on definitions, subpopulations included in studies, comorbidities, and the severity of the disease per se. Brun-Buisson and coworkers [9] studied the current occurrence and causes of ALI and ARDS, the relationships and respective outcome of mild ALI (PaO 2 2/FIO 2 between 200 and 300 mmHg) and ARDS (PaO 2 /FIO 2 equal to or below 200 mmHg), and the factors associated with survival. A 2-month inception cohort (February-March 1999) of 463 individuals with ALI among 6,522 patients who were admitted for at least 4 h in an intensive care unit (ICU) was scrutinized. Data pertain to ten European countries and 78 ICUs. Among 136 patients initially having mild ALI 74 (55%) went on to ARDS. There were 62 with mild ALI while 401 had ARDS. Crude ICU and hospital mortality rates were 22.6% and 32.7% (p<0.001) for mild ALI and 49.4% and 57.9% (p=0.0005) for ARDS. Initial mean tidal volume and positive end-expiratory pressure were 8.3\u20ac1.9 ml/kg and 7.7\u20ac3.6 cmH 2 O in ARDS patients. Air leaks were detected in 15.9% of subjects. In multivariate analysis mortality was associated with age, immunoincompetence, Simplified Acute Physiology Score (SAPS) II, logistic organ dysfunction score, and early air leak. The authors concluded that ALI is frequent, that there is a continuum between ALI and ARDS, and that there is a substantial difference in mortality, being much higher in ARDS.

These settings were pressure control ventilation to achieve a tidal volume 7-8 ml/kg predicted body weight ensuring peak inspiratory pressures below 35 cmH 2 O, FIO 2 1 and positive end-expiratory pressure 10 cmH 2 O. Forty-one consecutive patients were included. After institution of standard settings, in 17 patients (41%) the PaO 2 /FIO 2 was persistently below 200 mmHg and the remainder (24 patients, 59%) had a PaO 2 /FIO 2 above 200 mmHg 30 min after the changes were implemented. The change in FIO 2 was the main reason for these changes in PaO 2 /FIO 2 . The ICU mortality rate was significantly greater in those with persistent ARDS than in those with the transient form, 52.9% vs. 12.5% respectively (p=0.01).

Their median Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) II score was 11 (interquartile range 8-13).

Traditional weaning indices are poor predictors of extubation outcomes.

Salam and coworkers [15] objectively assessed the impact of neurological status, cough strength, and volume of endotracheal secretions on extubation outcomes. In 88 patients who had passed a spontaneous breathing trial they measured cough peak flow, endotracheal secretions and ability to complete four simple tasks (open eyes, follow with eyes, grasp hand, and stick out tongue). Fourteen patients (15.9%) failed the first extubation. Patients with a cough peak flow equal to or below 60 l/min were more likely to fail extubation than those with a cough peak flow higher than 60 l/min [risk ratio (RR) 4.8, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.4-16.2]. Patients with secretions of more than 2.5 ml/h were more likely to fail than those with fewer secretions (RR 3, 95% CI 1-8.8). Patients unable to complete the tasks were more likely to fail than those who completed the commands (RR 4.3, 95% CI 1. 8-10.4) . The presence of any two of those risk factors had a sensitivity of 71% and specificity of 81% in predicting extubation failure.

Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) has been considered a very effective treatment of acute respiratory failure (ARF) due to cardiogenic pulmonary edema (CPE). L'Her et al. [20] compared the physiological and clinical effects of CPAP and those of standard medical therapy in a subset of very old patients (>75 years) in whom the application of any form of MV is sometimes denied. Within 1 h CPAP led to decreased respiratory rate and improved oxygenation compared to baseline, whereas no differences were observed in the medical treatment group. Seventeen patients of this latter group developed severe complications vs. only four of the CPAP group. Early 48-h mortality was significantly lower in the ventilated patients, but overall hospital mortality not. The authors concluded that CPAP promotes early clinical and physiological improvement in elderly patients during episodes of ARF due to CPE, without affecting overall mortality.",

In a matched case control study performed in 128 COPD patients with very severe ARF (pH 7.18, PaCO 2 104 mmHg) Squadrone et al. [21] , evaluated the efficacy of noninvasive (case) vs. invasive MV (control). Mortality rate, duration of MV, and length of ICU and hospital stay did not differ between the two groups, but the NIV group had fewer complications and a tendency to be weaned earlier from ventilation. Intubation rate in the case group was 62%, but this subset of patients had similar outcomes as those of the control group. Those with successful NIV had lower mortality rate and shorter ICU and hospital stay than the patients who received intubation. In COPD patients with very advanced hypercapnic ARF NIV thus has a high rate of failure but nevertheless provides some advantages compared to invasive ventilation. Indeed a subgroup analysis suggested that the delay in intubation was not deleterious in the subset of patients who failed NIV.",

The authors concluded that UTI and CVC-related infections can be reduced through a continuous quality-improvement program based on surveillance of nosocomial infections.",

Penicillins plus b-lactamase inhibitor (AD 338.3) and quinolones (155.5) were the antimicrobials most used. Length of stay was an independent risk factor for an AD above the 75% percentile of the total amount of antimicrobials used (OR 1.96 per day) as well as for higher use of carbapenems (OR 1.90 per day) and extended-spectrum penicillins (OR 2.01 per day).

Of 3,738 patients admitted 546 (14.6%) had severe sepsis or shock, 30% of which cases were ICU acquired. The median SAPS II and Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) at onset of severe sepsis were 48 and 9, respectively. Mortality was 35% and 41.9% at 30 and 60 days after sepsis, and 11.4% of patients remained hospitalized at 2 months. Chronic liver and heart failure, acute renal failure and shock, SAPS II at onset of severe sepsis and 24-h total SOFA scores were the independent risk factors most strongly associated with death. The authors concluded that whereas the attack rate of severe sepsis has increased in French ICUs over the past decade, its mortality appears to have decreased, suggesting improved management of patients.",

Dupont et al.

In clinical practice the time of direct examination of pulmonary secretions is a very important issue since it corresponds to the time of the differentiation between infected and noninfected patients, the decision to treat or not, and the choice of initial antimicrobial therapy. The authors confirmed a strong relationship between the percentage of infected cells and the results of quantitative cultures of BAL. They also found two factors negatively associated with the percentage of infected cells: the duration of MV before the onset of VAP (12.2\u20ac12.1% before the 7th day, 7.4\u20ac9.2% between the 7th and the 14th day; and 4.8\u20ac6.4% after 15 days of MV; p=0.0002) and the ongoing use of antibiotics.

            "text": "For more than 20 years clinical evaluation including temperature, macroscopic aspect of tracheal secretions, leukocytosis, and chest radiography has been repeatedly identified as at least a nonoptimal way to diagnose pneumonia in patients treated with MV [51] . CPIS, which is no more than the quantification of a clinical evaluation, does indeed constitute significant progress, particularly when it is included in a management algorithm [47] . As indicated by Yu and Singh [46] in their editorial, the use of such an algorithm based on CPIS resulted in limiting the number and duration of antibiotics, reducing incidence of infections due to multiresistant bacteria, shortening duration of stay, and lowering 30-day mortality rate. It is therefore possible to reduce antibiotic use without deleterious consequences for MV-treated patients treated with clinical signs suggesting the development of VAP. Furthermore the authors clearly stated that excessive broad-spectrum therapy leads to greater emergence of multiply-resistant organisms and increases mortality and morbidity. Limiting the use of antibiotics in patients with CPIS lower than 6 is a very important first step of a \"revisited\" strategy. Yu and Singh reported important data concerning this strategy. During the 3 years following the implementation of the Singh protocol they had not experienced \"a single case of a patient with an invasive infection leading to death in a patient with CPIS <6 receiving 3 day monotherapy.\" Thus the relevant questions are: Is this patient developing VAP? Does the patient require antibiotics? To answer to these questions, it is possible to propose at least two new randomized trials: first, according to the authors, a comparison of a shortcourse monotherapy vs. no antibiotics in patients with low (<6) CPIS and, second, a comparison of the Singh protocol with a bacteriological strategy already evidenced as superior to the \"classic\" clinical strategy [55] .",

However, in 70 patients (49%) with low severity level (defined by a logistic organ dysfunction score 4), inadequate therapy was clearly associated with higher ICU mortality (37%, vs. 7% in patients appropriately treated, p=0.006). Pending confirmatory studies these results potentially have major impact on the management of patients suspected of having VAP: the appropriate choice of antibiotic(s) is of particular importance in the group of patients with low severity level at the time of the onset of clinical signs of infection.

However, linezolidresistant strains of S. aureus have already been reported in the United States and United Kingdom. As a conclusion, the authors recommended that (a) linezolid be used with caution and (b) parallel strategies such as antibiotic rotations, restricted use of antibiotics, hygiene measures and cohorting be adapted to diminish antibiotic-selective pressure and to decrease infections by resistant S. aureus.",

The threshold values of the indices that best discriminated between successful weaning and extubation failure were determined in onehalf of the patients while the accuracy of each index was then assessed in the other one-half. Breathing pattern and P0.1 were recorded during a 30 min spontaneous breathing trial. Of 114 patients who tolerated the trial and were extubated 21 required reintubation within 48 h. The area under the receiving operating characteristic curve for P0.1, P0.1 f/VT, and f/VT for diagnosing extubation failure was rather low and not statistically significant; P0.1 f/VT higher than 100 detected extubation failure with a low specificity. The authors concluded that bedside P0.1 and derived indices are of little help, if any, in predicting extubation failure.",
