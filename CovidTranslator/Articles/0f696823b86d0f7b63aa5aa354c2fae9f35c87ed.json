In Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis virus (TMEV) infection, during the first week (acute stage), mice develop polioencephalomyelitis. After 3 weeks (chronic stage), mice develop immune-mediated demyelination with virus persistence, which has been used as a viral model for MS. Regulatory T cells (Tregs) can suppress inflammation, and have been suggested to be protective in immunemediated diseases, including MS. However, in virus-induced inflammatory demyelination, although Tregs can suppress inflammation, preventing immune-mediated pathology, Tregs may also suppress anti-viral immune responses, leading to more active viral replication and/or persistence. To determine the role and potential translational usage of Tregs in MS, we treated TMEV-infected mice with ex vivo-generated induced Tregs (iTregs) on day 0 (early) or during the chronic stage (therapeutic). Early treatment worsened clinical signs during acute disease. The exacerbation of acute disease was associated with increased virus titers and decreased immune cell recruitment in the CNS. Therapeutic iTreg treatment reduced inflammatory demyelination during chronic disease. Immunologically, iTreg treatment increased interleukin-10 production from B cells, CD4 + T cells, and dendritic cells, which may contribute to the decreased CNS inflammation.",

Autoreactive antibody and T cell responses can be found in MS patients, which supports an autoimmune etiology (45) . Experimentally, experimental autoimmune (or allergic) encephalomyelitis (EAE), an animal model that resembles MS histologically, can be induced by sensitization with CNS antigens. On the other hand, an infectious etiology for MS has been considered since its initial descriptions (32) . Direct virus infection of oligodendrocytes can result in demyelination (9) . In addition a viral infection can result in development of autoimmunity either through molecular mimicry between a virus and myelin or through determinant (or epitope) spreading following the destruction of myelin and release of autoantigen (30, 65) . Clinically, the viral etiology of MS has been supported by detection of virus itself or anti-viral immune responses from MS patients (55) . Experimentally, a demyelinating disease can be induced by infection with several viruses, including Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis virus (TMEV) (47) .",

During the chronic stage, more than 3 weeks p.i., TMEV infects macrophages and glial cells, causing inflammatory demyelinating lesions similar to the neuropathology found in MS. TMEV-induced demyelinating disease (TMEV-IDD) in susceptible mouse strains, such as SJL/J mice, has been used as a viral model for MS (28) . Moreover, resistant mouse strains, such as C57BL/6 and BALB/c, develop only acute disease without viral persistence or demyelination. Although the precise pathomechanism in TMEV-IDD is unclear, both direct viral infection and immune-mediated pathology (immunopathology) can contribute to demyelination. While TMEV can directly infect and lyse myelin-forming oligodendrocytes, there is also evidence of the involvement of CD4 + T helper (Th1) and Th17 cells, CD8 + cytotoxic T cells, and antibodies in the pathogenesis of TMEV-IDD (8, 15, 18, 35, 42, 43, 56) .",

Although Tregs may play a protective role by preventing immunopathology, Tregs can also play a detrimental role by suppressing anti-viral immune responses, which leads to more active viral replication and/or viral persistence. For example, in West Nile virus infection, since the tissue damage is caused by immunopathology, suppression of anti-viral immune responses reduced pathology (26) . In contrast, in Friend virus infection, since the tissue damage is caused by viral replication, suppression of antiviral immune responses by Tregs was detrimental (12) . Thus, we hypothesized that Tregs can be a double-edged sword in TMEV-IDD, since both immunopathology and direct virus infection can contribute to the pathogenesis.",

These results suggest that a differential induction of Tregs between mouse strains may be responsible for susceptibility to TMEV-IDD, where Tregs play a detrimental role in susceptible SJL/J mice. On the other hand, in the mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) model of virus-induced demyelinating disease using the neurotropic strain of MHV, adoptive transfer of Tregs was found to decrease immune-mediated demyelination and mortality (1, 54) .

Any quadrant containing meningitis, perivascular cuffing, or demyelination was given a score of 1 in that pathological class. The total number of positive quadrants for each pathological class was determined and then divided by the total number of quadrants present on the slide and multiplied by 100 to give the percent involvement for each pathological class. An overall pathological score was also determined by giving a positive score if any pathology was present in the quadrant. This was also presented as the percent involvement.

At a 1 to 1 ratio of iTregs to responder cells, the amount of suppression was nearly 100%, and at a 1 to 50 ratio, the amount of suppression was approximately 25% ( Figure 1D ). The amount of suppression by iTregs from SJL/J mice depended on the ratio of iTregs versus responder cells and was similar to the amount from iTregs from C57BL/6 mice that was described previously (21) .

During the acute stage of TMEV infection, 1-2 weeks p.i., TMEV has been shown to induce only mild or no disease clinically, but induce inflammation mainly in the brain, histologically. Interestingly, iTreg-early mice developed obvious clinical signs during the acute stage. Although no control TMEV-infected mice developed an impaired righting reflex, the iTregearly mice had a significantly impaired righting reflex during the acute stage of disease (mean righting reflex scores \u00b1 SEM on day 8: iTreg-early 0.9 \u00b1 0.2; control 0, P < 0.05, ttest). In addition, iTreg-early mice had more weight loss compared with control mice, which had a weight increase during the acute stage (mean weight change (g) \u00b1SEM on day 8: iTreg-early, \u22120.8 g \u00b1 0.3; control, 0.8 g \u00b1 0.3, P < 0.05, t-test). By 2 weeks p.i., iTreg-early mice recovered from acute disease and both iTreg-early and control mice showed no clinical signs between 2-3 weeks p.i. During the chronic stage, the iTreg-early mice had slightly lower clinical scores than control mice; although this difference was not significant.",

In control TMEV-infected mice, layers of cell infiltrates were observed around the perivascular area, while in iTreg-early mice only dilation of venules with few or no infiltrating cells was observed (Figure 8 ). Immunohistochemistry against CD3 showed substantial CD3 + cell infiltration in the brains of control mice, while very little CD3 + T cells were observed in the brains of iTreg-early mice (Figures 8C and D) .

This raised the question whether early iTreg treatment of TMEV-resistant C57BL/6 mice could render them susceptible to TMEV-IDD, where TMEV infection may result in more active virus replication and virus persistence in the CNS, leading to TMEV-IDD in C57BL/6 mice.

Expression of CD49d on iTregs suggests that they can migrate into to the CNS by binding to vascular cell adhesion molecule (VCAM)-1.

We also demonstrated that both the cellular and humoral anti-TMEV immune responses were similar between the iTreg-late and the control mice ( Figure 3 ). Then, we compared the cytokine profiles between the two groups of mice. The iTreg-late mice produced significantly more IL-10 in response to TMEV than the control mice, but similar amounts of other cytokines ( Figure 5 ). The amount of IL-10 produced in response to TMEV was even higher than what was produced in response to a T cell mitogen, ConA (39) . This was the only cytokine that was produced in higher levels in response to TMEV than ConA.

While only a small percentage of the cells were IL-10 + , there were more IL-10 + cells in the iTreg-late mice after stimulating the cells with TMEV, compared with control mice (Figure 6 ). There were higher percentages of CD4 + and B220 + (a B cell marker) cells among the IL-10 + cells, which was somewhat expected, since these cell types have been associated with IL-10 production (13) . Interestingly, the IL-10 MFI was also higher in all the cell types investigated in the iTreg-late mice compared with the control mice, except CD4 + cells ( Figure 6D ). The higher MFI was not due to an increase in autofluorescence or nonspecific antibody binding, since the MFIs of samples incubated with isotype control antibody were similar between control and iTreg groups (data not shown). Overall, the higher MFI suggests that these cell types are producing more IL-10 (51). Since most cell types, except CD4 + cells, have a higher IL-10 MFI, the iTregs may change the immune response systemically to a more regulatory phenotype. Although IL-10 production was seen in very low percentages in all cell subsets, there was a higher percentage of IL-10 + cells and a higher MFI in the iTreg-late mice compared with the control mice, combined these increases could explain the significant increase in IL-10 production in response to TMEV seen by ELISA. This systemic change to a more regulatory phenotype may explain how the iTreg-late mice have similar anti-TMEV immune responses and viral load, and less inflammation compared with control mice.",

Here, it appears that iTregs are influencing the immune response to TMEV in other immune cell types, mostly in the lymphoid organs, and altering them to a more anti-inflammatory response via IL-10 production. Consistent with this theory, Karlsson et al, whose method for generating iTregs in C57BL/6 mice was applied to SJL/J mice, found substantial numbers of iTregs in the peripheral lymphoid organs after iTreg transfer. Anghelina et al also reported a systemic distribution of transferred Tregs in MHV-infected mice. Although this does not deny the possibility that iTregs influence the immune system in the target organ (i.e., CNS) in our current experiments, we were not able to precisely determine the localization of transferred iTregs by distinguishing between iTregs and nTregs in the recipient mice, due to a lack of GFP-FOXP3 or DEREG mice on the SJL/J genetic background.",

We are investigating how the iTregs affected the other cell types to enhance their IL-10 production. Kearley et al. observed a similar effect of Tregs in a mouse model of airway inflammation, where transferred Tregs were able to suppress inflammation by inducing IL-10 expression in CD4 + T cells in recipient mice (22) . In their model, the transfer of IL-10-deficient Tregs could induce IL-10 production in CD4 + T cells. Anghelina et al. also demonstrated that in MHV infection, another viral model for MS, transfer of IL-10-deficient Tregs was able to suppress disease, while transferring Tregs to IL-10-deficient recipient mice did not suppress virus-induced demyelination (1) . Although the authors were unable to determine the source of IL-10, their data suggests that IL-10 was essential for disease suppression and that its production was induced in recipient cells by transferred Tregs. These experiments demonstrated that Tregs can influence the amount of IL-10 production without necessarily producing it by themselves. Interestingly, the iTreg-early mice killed 1 week after iTreg injection (in contrast to the iTreg-late mice that were killed over a month after iTreg injection) also had increased IL-10 responses to TMEV, compared with control mice, although their IL-10 response to ConA was greater than the response to TMEV (Figure 6 ). This suggests a change from a non-specific to a virus specific IL-10 response during the course of TMEV infection; which may need to be addressed to determine how IL-10 contributes to the immunomodulatory effects of iTregs in TMEV and other virus infections, in general. The long-term effects of the iTregs were similar to what was seen in a mouse model of IBD, where injection of iTregs suppressed disease 8 weeks after injection (21) .",

In theory, a small number of TMEV-specific iTregs that were present in the inoculum could have expanded and altered the cytokine milieu to a more favorable environment for the expansion of resident TMEV-specific Tregs (52) .

SJL/J mice spontaneously develop reticulum cell sarcomas, typically around 5-6 months of age (37) . Despite the changes in the immune response to TMEV the iTreg-late mice did not have a higher incidence of developing reticulum cell sarcomas or other tumors than the control mice, which were identified by macroscopic swelling of the lymph nodes and spleen and confirmed microscopically. However, these experiments typically lasted until the mice were less than 3 months old; thus a longer term experiment would be required to determine longer term effects of iTreg injection on the development of reticulum cell sarcoma and other malignancies in these mice.",

In TMEV infection, SJL/J mice generally do not develop obvious clinical disease during the acute stage; infected mice sometimes show mild weight loss without impairment of righting reflex. Interestingly, control mice had a higher level of cell infiltration, including T cells, in the brain. On the other hand, we detected higher infectious virus and viral RNA in the brains of iTreg-early mice, compared with control mice. Thus, viral pathology (replication), but not inflammation (immunopathology), seemed to contribute to exacerbation of acute disease in iTreg-early mice. We first suspected that the iTregs inhibited the immune response to TMEV, which reduced the amount of CNS inflammation. However, both the cellular and humoral immune responses to TMEV were similar between iTreg-early and control mice. Although the mice had similar overall antiviral immune responses, the iTreg-early mice produced four-fold more IL-10 and three-fold less IFN-\u03b3 in response to TMEV compared with the control mice ( Figure 11 ). This suggests that modulation of the immune response to TMEV could prevent CNS recruitment of antiviral immune cells and allow for more viral replication. This is similar to what has been previously demonstrated with CNS infections with GDVII versus DA strains of TMEV, where the neurovirulent GDVII strain caused mice to die due to more severe viral replication (viral pathology) with significantly reduced T cell recruitment in the CNS (59) . In herpes simplex virus (HSV) infection, Lund et al. found that Tregs were essential for prolonging the lifespan of infected mice by coordinating the migration (recruitment) of effector T cells to the site of infection, where in the absence of Tregs the effector cells accumulated in the draining lymph nodes and were less prevalent at the site of infection (27) . The authors concluded that Tregs were orchestrating timely immune cell recruitment to the site of infection to aid the immune response to HSV. In TMEV infection, Tregs may also affect the recruitment of effector cells to the CNS and preventing them from entering the site of infection in a deleterious manner, which is in contrast to what occurs in HSV infection.",

Using anti-CD25 antibody, Richards et al. inactivated Tregs in SJL/J mice during the acute stage of TMEV infection and found a reduced viral burden during the acute stage of disease and a delay in the onset of TMEV-IDD and a reduction in the severity of disease (40) . The results from our study are in agreement with their results, where depletion of Tregs reduced viral loads, while addition of iTregs increased viral loads in our study. Richards et al. also found that depletion of Tregs enhanced CD4 + and CD8 + T cell as well as antibody responses to TMEV. In contrast, we demonstrated that the addition of iTregs did not reduce the anti-TMEV immune response, either cellular or humoral, but altered the cytokine balance to a more anti-inflammatory bias. These differences between the two studies could be due to the different mechanistic approaches and the characteristics of the in vivo inactivated Tregs and the ex vivo generated iTregs. Richards et al. inactivated Tregs in vivo ('loss of function' approach), while we gave the mice ex vivo generated iTregs ('gain of function' approach). In addition, since CD25 is expressed on activated T cells and during T cell development, and on B cells and other cell types, inactivation or depletion of these cell populations could create additional effects other than Treg inactivation, which may account for the discrepancies (23, 64) . Furthermore, Karlsson et al. demonstrated that iTregs from C57BL/6 mice were more potent at suppressing colitis and had different expression patterns of homing molecules and cytokines compared with natural Tregs (nTregs) (20) . Thus, the differences between ex vivo generated iTregs and in vivo generated nTregs may also explain the discrepancies between the experiments by Richards et al. and ours.",

We have conducted iTreg transfer experiments with TMEV-infected C57BL/6 mice and found that they did not become susceptible to TMEV-IDD or virus persistence (Supplemental Figures 3 and 4) . There was no difference in the immune response to TMEV during the acute stage of TMEV infection between the control C57BL/6 mice and the C57BL/6 mice given iTregs. This is consistent with the findings by Richards et al. that there was no enhancement of anti-TMEV immune responses when they depleted Tregs in C57BL/6 mice.

During the chronic stage of TMEV infection where immunopathology is the dominant pathomechanism, iTreg treatment reduced CNS inflammation without increasing the viral burden suppressing TMEV-IDD. On the other hand, during the acute stage of TMEV infection where viral replication causes most of the pathology, iTreg treatment enhanced viral replication leading to more severe disease. These two contrasting effects of Tregs have been observed individually in several viral infections (1, 12, 26, 50, 66) . To our knowledge, however, this is the first study to demonstrate that iTregs could have both detrimental and beneficial effects in the different stages of a single virus infection. Since Tregs have been proposed as a potential therapeutic target for many diseases that may have a viral component or occur in parallel with viral infections, the present data suggest that Tregs may be a double-edged sword. The type and stage of virus infection must be carefully considered before using Tregs for a personalized medicine approach.",

Quantification of inflammation in the spinal cord of mice infected with TMEV, mice were killed on day 48. iTreg-late mice (hatched bars) had lower pathology scores in all pathological classes, particularly perivascular cuffing (*P < 0.05), compared with control mice (closed bars). Spinal cord sections were divided into four quadrants consisting of the anterior funiculus, the posterior funiculus and each lateral funiculus. The total number of positive quadrants for each pathologic class was determined, then divided by the total number of quadrants present on the slide and multiplied by 100 to give the percent involvement for each pathologic class. The overall pathology was determined by counting the number of quadrants containing any lesions. Six mice per group were used. These results are representative of three independent experiments.

Note no dilatation of vessels in uninfected mice (E inset, no infection). A, B, and E. Luxol fast blue staining of the hippocampus of representative mice killed during the acute stage. C and D. Consecutive sections immunostained using CD3 antibody showed that iTreg-early mice had few T cells around vessels, while control infected mice had a substantial T cell infiltration around vessels as well as in the parenchyma. F. Quantification of inflammation in the brain of TMEV-infected mice showed that iTreg-early mice (open bars) had significantly lower perivascular and overall inflammatory scores than control mice (closed bars) (*P < 0.05). The results are representative of two independent experiments. Magnifications \u00d7 24; insets \u00d7 99. Viral titration in the brain during the acute stage of TMEV infection. We detected higher levels of infectious virus (A) and viral RNA (B) from the brains of iTreg-early mice (open bars) compared with control mice (closed bars). The amount of infectious virus correlated with the amount of weight loss in iTreg-early mice (r = 0.84, P < 0.05) (C). A. Infectious virus was quantified by plaque assays (P = 0.10). B. \u0394Ct values of VP2 compared with cellular levels of the house keeping gene, PGK 1, by RT-PCR (P = 0.17). \u0394Ct was calculated by subtracting the PGK1 Ct from the TMEV Ct . C. Correlation of virus titers in the brain with weight loss in iTreg-early mice. Five brains per group were harvested on the peak of the acute stage. Cytokine responses to TMEV during the acute stage of infection. MNCs from the iTregearly mice (open bars) produced more anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 (A) and IL-4 (B) and less inflammatory cytokine IFN-\u03b3 (C) and IL-17 (D) in response to ConA or TMEV compared with control mice (closed bars). MNCs were isolated from the spleens of iTregearly or control mice and stimulated with ConA or TMEV for 48 hours. The levels of cytokine production in the culture supernatants were measured by ELISA. Results are representative of mean + SEM from two to three pools of spleens with two spleens per pool from four experiments. ND: Not detectable.",
