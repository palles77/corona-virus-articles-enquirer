The observation of paramyxovirus-like intranuclear filaments in brain lesions of MS patients (Prineas 1972 ) has received much attention, but skepticism about the viral nature of these structures has been expressed because: (1) they looked quite different from paramyxoviruses (Dubois-Dalcq, Schumacher and Sever 1973); (2) they were found in a variety of diseases other than MS (Shaw and Sumi 1975) , and (3) there was no immunocytological evidence of their viral origin. So far there have been no reports of complete virus structures in MS brain tissue.",
