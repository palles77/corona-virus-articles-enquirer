Sphingosine 1-phosphate and its analogues cause internalization and degradation of S1P 1 receptors, preventing the auto reactivity of immune cells in the target tissues. It has been shown that S1P 1 receptor agonists such as fingolimod can be suitable candidates for treatment of autoimmune diseases. The current study aimed to generate GRIND-based 3D-QSAR predictive models for agonistic activities of 2-imino-thiazolidin-4-one derivatives on S1P 1 to be used in virtual screening of chemical libraries. The developed model for the S1P 1 receptor agonists showed appropriate power of predictivity in internal (r 2 acc 0.93 and SDEC 0.18) and external (r 2 0.75 and MAE (95% data), 0.28) validations. The generated model revealed the importance of variables DRY-N1 and DRY-O in the potency and selectivity of these compounds towards S1P 1 receptor. To propose potential chemical entities with S1P 1 agonistic activity, PubChem chemicals database was searched and the selected compounds were virtually tested for S1P 1 receptor agonistic activity using the generated models, which resulted in four potential compounds with high potency and selectivity towards S1P 1 receptor. Moreover, the affinities of the identified compounds towards S1P 1 receptor were evaluated using molecular dynamics simulations. The results indicated that the binding energies of the compounds were in the range of \u00c039.31 to \u00c046.18 and \u00c03.20 to \u00c09.75 kcal mol \u00c01 , calculated by MM-GBSA and MM-PBSA algorithms, respectively. The findings in the current work may be useful for the identification of potent and selective S1P 1 receptor agonists with potential use in diseases such as multiple sclerosis.",

S1P is a lipid with a particular aminoalcohol structure, known as sphingosine which binds to S1P 1-5 receptors [2] . These receptors are G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), in which the N-terminal of the proteins forms an amphipathic binding pocket by crafting a helical cap hindering ligands to access the binding pocket [3] . However, it is believed that LPLs attain their binding sites through the cell membrane instead of extracellular region [4] . S1P 1 receptors are expressed on lymphocytes, regulating immune cells (i.e.B-and T-cells) trafficking. The gradient concentration of S1P in blood, interstitial fluid, and lymph controls the egress of lymphocytes [5] .

After conversion to the phosphate form, fingolimod activates S1P 1 , S1P 3 , S1P 4 and S1P 5 receptors. Although the exact roles for S1P4 and S1P 5 receptors remain unclear, the adverse effects of fingolimod are attributed to the activation of S1P 3 receptor [11] . Therefore, in different studies several selective S1P 1 receptor agonists have been synthesized in order to retain the therapeutic properties of S1P 1 receptor agonists with the minimum side effects [5, 12, 13] .",

The Grid-INdependent Descriptors (GRIND) offered an alternative approach in 3D-QSAR analyses in which the alignment of ligands is not required. Instead, the products of interaction energies for each pair of MIFs are used to build the models [15] .

The quality and geometrical features of the obtained model was checked using PROCHECK and MolProbity programs [23e25]. Then, the 3D coordinates of the antagonist in complex with S1P 1 receptor were used to dock the studied ligands into the S1P 1 receptor crystal structure using GOLD program (version 5.0, CCDC, Cambridge, UK) running under LINUX operating system [26, 27] .To determine the ligand binding site on S1P 3 , the modeled S1P 3 receptor structure was aligned on S1P 1 receptor-antagonist complex and a new merged complex was built consisting S1P 3 receptor and the antagonist. Finally, the position of the antagonist in the new complex was used as the guide for determining the binding site in docking calculations. ChemPLP scoring function in GOLD program was used for the docking calculations. Docking of the experimentally co-crystallized antagonist into the binding site of S1P 1 receptor resulted in a solution with 0.51 \u00c5 RMSD to its experimentally observed position. Therefore, for all other dockings the same scoring function was used. The best active conformations for the most active compounds in data set (i.e. compounds 61 and 14 for S1P 1 and S1P 3 receptors, respectively) were selected based on their docking scores. The best conformers for the rest of compounds were selected based on the maximum shape similarity to the most active compound (i.e. compounds 61 and 14 for S1P 1 and S1P 3 receptors, respectively) using Tanimoto algorithm implemented in Shape-it program [28] .",

The obtained results could be used for identifying new ligands active on S1P 1 receptors in database search and drug design studies. In the current study, the crystal structure of S1P 1 receptor in complex with an antagonist was used for virtual screening to identify S1P 1 agonists. It has been elucidated that GPCRs adopt active or inactive structure upon binding to either an agonist or an antagonist, respectively. Up to now, the structure of S1P 1 with an agonist has not been solved experimentally, therefore, the antagonist-bound S1P 1 structure was used in the current study. To examine how different might be the active and inactive forms of S1P 1 receptor, the active and inactive structures of closely related GPCR was investigated. The basic local alignment tool (BLAST) was employed to search protein data bank for structurally known homologous GPCRs. The search identified adenosine A2A receptor bound to an antagonist (PDB code: 3PWH) as one of the closest homologues of S1P 1 receptor (28.67% identity, 85% coverage, and 2 \u00c2 10 \u00c023 E-value). As a matter of fact, the structure of adenosine A2A receptor could have been used as the template for homology modeling of S1P 1 receptor if there was no experimental structure for S1P 1 itself. There are two other structures for adenosine A2A receptor co-crystallized with agonist ligands (PDB IDs: 3QAK and 2YDO). Assuming agonist and antagonist bound structures of receptor representing the active and inactive forms, calculation of the Ca RMSDs between the adenosine A2A active and inactive forms revealed that they are very similar (RMSD values of 3QAK and 2YDO active structures against 3PWH inactive structure are 1.37 and 1.33 \u00c5), which is comparable to the difference between two active structures (RMSD value of 0.82 \u00c5). The structures of adenosine A2A receptor in active and inactive forms are compared in Fig. 2 . These observations for the most identical GPCR with known structure to the S1P 1 receptor indicate the viability of using antagonist-bound S1P 1 receptor structure for the purpose of current study, and it may not be feasible to distinguish fine structural differences between the active and inactive forms of the receptor by MD simulations. Moreover, in this study, semi-flexible docking procedure was utilized for the docking of ligands retrieved from the database structure similarity search.",

The train compounds were subjected to Pentacle program and the generated GRIND-based descriptors were used to build 3D-QSAR models. FFD variable selection was performed for several times on the generated models until no significant changes in statistical indices (squared correlation coefficient r 2 , cross validated correlation coefficient q 2 and SDEP) were observed. The internal predictivity of the models was evaluated by LOO and LTO methods and the obtained statistics are shown in Table 4 . As seen in Table 4 , the r 2 acc values and standard deviation of error in calculation (SDEC) for S1P 1 and S1P 3 models have been improved by increasing the number of latent variables and reached to the optimum values with five latent variables (5LVs). Although LOO and LTO q 2 values (i.e., 0.39 and 0.42, respectively) for S1P 1 model with 5LVs are lower than that with 2, 3 and 4 LVs, the overall assessment of internal validation and prediction errors suggested the model with 5LVs as the best model for activity prediction. However, in the case of S1P 3 model, the model generated with 5LVs was validated as the best predictive model from both predictivity (i.e., q2 LOO, 0.48 and q2 LTO 0.49) and level of errors (SDEC, 0.19) points of view. Fig. 3 illustrates the distance dependent plot of PLS coefficients for the selected variables analyzed with 5LVs during 3D-QSAR model development. The most important variables for the 3D-QSAR models are summarized in Table 5 . As it can be seen in Table 5 and Fig. 3 , the S1P 1 and S1P 3 models share DRY-DRY (14e14.4 \u00c5), N1eN1 (11.2e11.6 \u00c5), TIP-TIP (17.6e18 \u00c5) and N1-TIP (4.4e4.8 and 8e8.4 \u00c5) variables with almost equal probe-probe distances; while, DRY-N1 (10.4e10.8 \u00c5) and DRY-O (12.4e12.8 \u00c5) variables were unique MIF pairs which were selected just in S1P 1 model with positive and negative impacts on biological activities, respectively. As seen in Fig. 4 DRY-N1 (10.4e10.8 \u00c5) variable connects thiazolidine ring to hydroxyl moiety at the most end of the structure indicating that the presence of an hydrophobic region (for example thiazolidine ring in compound 61) at the distance of 10.4e10.8 \u00c5 from a hydrogen acceptor group (i.e., hydroxyl group in compound 61) positively influences the biological activities as well as the selectivity of the studied compounds towards S1P 1 receptor. On the other hand, analyzing the PLS coefficients revealed that the positive impact of DRY-N1 variable is higher for the compounds 02, 04, 21, 23, 25, 25, 26, 28, 29, 59 and 62 whose selectivity towards S1P 1 is higher compared to the compounds 44, 45, 46, 56 and 58 as the least selective compounds towards S1P 1 over S1P 3 receptor. Another selectivity inducing variable, DRY-O (12.4e12.8 \u00c5), connects a hydrophobic region (i.e., thiazolidine ring in compound 61) to a hydrogen donor group (i.e., etheric oxygen in compound 61), far apart 10.4e10.8 \u00c5 from each other which adversely affects the S1P 1 receptor agonistic activity. The impact of this variable is lower for the S1P 1 selective compounds such as compounds 22, 25, 42, 60 and 62 which are the S1P 1 selective compounds rather than S1P 3 receptor. Taking into account all these explanations, it seems that DRY-N1 and DRY-O variables can be considered as the S1P 1 receptor selectivity-introducing factors for the studied compounds.",

The agonistic activities for the best docking poses of the identified molecules were predicted based on the developed 3D-QSAR models. The results demonstrated that compounds 400 (PubChem ID: 136647497), 452 (PubChem ID: 72785505), 798 (PubChem ID: 18758433) and 799 (PubChem ID: 18758427) could bind to S1P 1 receptor with predicted EC 50 values of 0.65, 3.63, 1.35 and 0.68 nM, respectively, while their predicted affinities towards S1P 3 receptor were estimated to be considerably low (Table 7) . Comparing the predicted affinities towards S1P 1 and S1P 3 receptors showed excellent selectivity for compound 452 (S1P 3 EC 50 /S1P 1 EC 50 : 13489). This level of predicted selectivity is comparable with the selectivities reported for S1P 1 agonists in clinical trials such as ozanimod [19] and siponimod [40] and much greater than that of compound 61, indicating that compound 452 is noteworthy to be evaluated in experiments for development of a potent and selective S1P 1 agonist. Moreover, among the selected compounds, compound 799 showed high predicted EC 50 value (0.68 nM) with acceptable S1P 1 over S1P 3 selectivity (5888 times), demonstrating its feasibility to be explored as a potent and selective S1P 1 agonist.

As seen in Fig. 6 , compound 61 from the data set interacts differently with the receptor compared to S1P 1 receptor co-crystallized antagonist and the compounds identified from PubChem search. However, the latter compounds bind the same site as the antagonist, which may indicate their capability of S1P 1 receptor recognition. Analyzing the chemical structures of the selected compounds reveals some important details about the observed results in terms of predicted potency and selectivity of these structures. Table 8 summarizes the physic-chemical properties of the selected compounds in comparison to compound 61, S1P, ozanimod, and siponimod. The analysis shows that those compounds more hydrophobic than compound 61 have higher predicted activities, which may be attributed to the easy penetration of more lipophilic compounds into the innermost binding site of S1P 1 receptor (Fig. 7) . In an effort to identify the interaction modes of agonists with the receptor, the 2D illustrations of the bindings were generated using Discovery Studio Visualization (version 17.2.0) program (Fig. 8) .

These observations are in agreement with the selective agonistic S1P 1 activities predicted for the identified compounds obtained from database search [43, 44] .

The validity of the developed models was evaluated by the internal and external cross validation methods, in which the generated models showed adequate statistical parameters for their predictive abilities. The results showed that interactions such as DRY-N1 and DRY-O promote the agonistic activity towards S1P 1 receptor. Furthermore, structural variables associated with hydrophobic moieties are the important features influencing the S1P 1 receptor selectivity of the studied compounds.",

Docking of the most potent compound (i.e., compound 61) in the data set and those identified by database similarity search showed that they interact differently with S1P 1 receptor which may be attributed to the higher lipophilicity of the identified compounds compared to compound 61 from the data set. The identified most selective compound from the similarity search bind to E protein from Human coronavirus which may share commonality with S1P 1 receptor in terms of binding site, providing further evidence in agreement with the results obtained from 3D-QSAR model. Moreover, S1P 1 receptor binding energies were calculated using molecular dynamics simulations for the agonists identified from PubChem database search. The results were indicative of their appropriate receptor affinities due to the negative binding energies, which are also in close agreement with the predicted EC 50 values. Fig. 7 . 3D-represantation of S1P 1 receptor in complex with its ligands. As seen, compounds 61 (shown as green sticks) is interacting differently with S1P 1 receptor compared to S1P 1 receptor co-crystallized antagonist (yellow) and compounds 400 (pink), 452 (orange), 798 (cyan), and 799 (purple). PyMol program (version 1.7.0.0) was used to generate the images. (For interpretation of the references to color in this figure legend, the reader is referred to the Web version of this article.) Fig. 9 . The alignment between profiles prepared for S1P 1 receptor and E protein using the known secondary structural information. The profiles were generated using their closely related sequences extracted from NCBI. As seen, E protein can be aligned with the 5th transmembrane helix of S1P 1 receptor. The alignment was performed using ClustalW program implemented in ClustalX (version 2.0).",

This protein plays a central role in virus morphogenesis and assembly and acts as a viroporin and selfassembles in host membranes forming pentameric protein-lipid pores that allow ion transport. The experimental studies have shown that compound 452 binds to the transmembrane helical segments of E protein. Although, there is no apparent similarity between E protein and S1P 1 receptor sequences, both of them are helical transmembrane proteins. The docking studies conducted in this work identified the core of the helical bundle of S1P 1 receptor (a member of 7 transmembrane GPCR superfamily) as the binding site for 452, which is in agreement to the experimentally identified binding site of this compound formed by transmembrane helical bundle of pentameric E protein. The alignment between profiles prepared for S1P 1 receptor and E protein using their closely related sequences and the known secondary structural information revealed that E protein can be aligned with the 5th transmembrane helix of S1P 1 receptor as demonstrated in",
