The acute renal impairment reflected the different prerenal and renal factors that exerted renal insult occurring in the context of multiorgan failure. Eventually, 33 SARS patients (91.7%) with acute renal impairment died. The mortality rate was significantly higher among patients with SARS and acute renal impairment compared with those with SARS and no renal impairment (91.7% vs. 8.8%) (P < 0.0001). Renal tissues revealed predominantly acute tubular necrosis with no evidence of glomerular pathology. The adjusted relative risk of mortality associated with the development of acute renal impairment was 4.057 (P < 0.001).

The median time from the onset of viral infection to the development of ARF in these 36 patients was 20 days (range, 5 to 48 days). The peak plasma creatinine levels ranged from 136 to 1083 lmol/L, with a median value of 274 lmol/L. Fourteen of these 36 patients (39%) had plasma bicarbonate lower than 24 mmol/L (normal 24 to 26 mmol/L) prior to or at the time of detection of ARF.

Comorbidity factors included hypertension (10 patients), diabetes mellitus (5 patients), ischemic heart disease (2 patients), hepatitis Bassociated chronic hepatitis (one patient), bronchiectasis (one patient), stroke (one patient), hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy (one patient), and sinoatrial node dysfunction (one patient).

It should be clarified that identical antibiotic regimes were given to our two groups of SARS patients (with and without ARF). Eosinophilia was not detected in patients with ARF. Despite the fact that ribavirin is predominantly excreted by the kidneys, nephrotoxicity has not been previously reported. In our seven postmortem subjects, we detected no distinct renal pathology and did not find CoV ultrastructurally. However, the ultrastructural interpretation was limited by autolysis of the tissues and a direct involvement of the kidneys by the CoV could not be entirely ruled out. The detection of PCR fragments of CoV in urine from 21% to 50% of SARS patients between the second and third week of the viral infection [16] still highlights a possibility of kidney tropism of the CoV. Nevertheless, the normal glomerular histology with absence of electron-dense deposits, mild proteinuria, and absence of active cellular cast all tend to negate the existence of an active immune-mediated glomerulonephritis. Moreover, the in situ hybridization study also failed to detect SARS-CoV in kidney tissues and suggested that persistent infection in these fatal cases was less likely. On the other hand, refractory hypotension occurred commonly in those patients who developed multiorgan failures. Inotropic support in forms of adrenaline/noradrenaline infusion was administered to half of these patients. Bacterial sepsis, not uncommon in these patients on prolonged ventilatory support and multiorgan failure, could also contribute to the development of ARF. The fall in glomerular filtration secondary to hypotension, vasoconstriction and sepsis plausibly contributed to the development of acute tubular necrosis, evidenced by the histologic finding of the renal tissues in our study.",

However, this cohort of patients with ARF demonstrated an extremely poor prognosis. The mortality was in excess of 90% and higher than those who developed ARDS requiring ventilatory support. The ARF reflects that the renal insult occurred in the context of multiorgan failure. As our clinical findings suggest the relative importance of prerenal factors in the development of ARF in these SARS patients, strict precautions should be exercised to ensure that these patients receive adequate hemodynamic support. Hypotension and sepsis must be treated aggressively as the complicating renal impairment is always associated with high mortality. In our multivariate analysis, ARDS is the most significant independent risk factors predicting the development of ARF in SARS despite other parameters (systolic blood pressure, low nadir leukocyte count, low nadir lymphocyte count, low plasma albumin on admission, and the peak serum creatinine kinase phosphatase) are implicated in the development of ARF by univariate analysis.",
