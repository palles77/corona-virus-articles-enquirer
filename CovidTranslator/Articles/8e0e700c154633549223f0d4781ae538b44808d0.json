The Association of American Medical Colleges in their 2005 report Achieving Accountability (http://www.aamc.org/publications) outlines 2 levels or kinds of accountability. 2 Level I accountability refers to institutional requirements, for example, legal requirements, fi nancial audits, and accreditation. Level II accountability refers to institutional choices, that is, how an individual academic medical center carries out its mission. The Washington/WWAMI case study fi ts more closely with the latter than with the former, but fi ts most closely with the vision for social accountability developed by the Canadian medical schools. 3 ",

A commissioned report published in 1991, Toward Integrated Medical Resource Policies for Canada, projected an oversupply of physicians in the coming decade. 5 Based in part on this projection, the government offi ces that controlled provincial medical student enrollment numbers cut back medical school enrollment by 10% for the nation. The subsequent reduction in physician numbers turned out to be an enormous mistake: the predicted oversupply turned into a severe shortage in the decade after the report as the health care system and patient care needs evolved. Medical schools have now responded to this societal need (with increased government funding) by increasing enrollment (Figure 1 ).",

This experience illustrates how incredibly diffi cult it is to plan physician workforce needs. Changes in health technology, physician practice patterns, community needs, and funding for health care are all diffi cult to assess and act on now, let alone to use as the basis for recommendations for the future. In this regard, governments and health organizations and the Association of Faculties of Medicine of Canada have partnered in Task Force I and II to develop a new physi-cian human resource strategy for Canada and published a major analysis in 2005 and recommendations in 2006. 4, 8 Where and how the new physicians will practice is vitally important, and much of the expansion of medical schools is rural and regionally based. In Canada, as in the United States, the physician shortage is worse in rural communities, especially in frontier regions, such as the provinces of Newfoundland and Labrador, New Brunswick, and Saskatchewan, and the 3 northern territories. 4, 9 Also as in the United States, the research on medical education shows that both rural background and rural medical education are important factors that contribute to the recruitment and retention of rural physicians. [10] [11] [12] [13] Similarly, mirroring the situation in the United States, rural residents are underrepresented in Canadian medical schools, making up 10.8% of medical students but fully 22.4% of the population. 14,15 With 30% to 40% of its students from rural areas, Memorial University of Newfoundland (MUN) is the exception.",

In 2001, Health Canada published Social Accountability: A Vision for Canadian Medical Schools, a report developed by a task force of multiple stakeholders, including strong involvement of Canada's medical schools. 3 This social accountability vision begins with the 1995 World Health Organization (WHO) defi nition of social accountability of medical schools as \"the obligation to direct their education, research and service of activities towards addressing the priority health concerns of the community, region and/or nation that they have a mandate to serve. The priority health concerns are to be identifi ed jointly by governments, health care organizations, health professionals and public.\" 20 By identifying and responding to the needs of the community, Canadian medical schools along with their partners have a major role to play in infl uencing the changes in the health care system that are necessary to ensure an effective, effi cient, accessible, equitable, and sustainable system in the 21st century.

The latter project was initiated by a public health threat.

More information on these projects is available online (http://www. afmc.ca/pages/articles_social_accountability.html).",
