            "text": "The presence of Giardia and Cryptosporidium was investigated in 274 faecal samples of alpacas (Vicugna pacos) from 12 herds from Peru by immunofluorescence microscopy and PCR amplification and sequencing of fragments of the ssu-rRNA and \u2424-giardin genes from Giardia spp., as well as the ssu-rRNA gene from Cryptosporidium spp. A total of 137 samples (50.0%) were positive for Giardia spp., and 12 samples (4.4%) for Cryptosporidium spp. In ten samples (3.6%), co-infection by both pathogens was found. Herd prevalence was found to be 91.7% (11/12 herds) for Giardia and 58.3% (7/12 herds) for Cryptosporidium. Regarding the age of the animals, although Giardia was detected in animals as young as 1 week, the prevalence increased with age, reaching 80% by 8 weeks. Similarly, the highest percentage of Cryptosporidium detection (20%) was also found in the 8 week-old group. By PCR, 92 of the 274 analysed samples were positive for Giardia. Sequencing of the amplicons showed the existence of Giardia duodenalis assemblage A in 67 samples; G. duodenalis assemblage E in 24 samples; and inconsistent results between the two molecular markers used in a further sample. Cryptosporidium was only detected by PCR in 3 of the 274 samples; Cryptosporidium parvum was identified in two samples and Cryptosporidium ubiquitum in one sample. This study is the first performing molecular characterisation of both parasites in Peruvian alpacas, and the first report of C. ubiquitum in this host. The identification of G. duodenalis assemblage A, C. parvum and C. ubiquitum, suggests that zoonotic transmission of these enteropathogens between alpacas and humans is possible.",

            "text": "In SAC, the first case of Giardia infection was described in 1987 in an asymptomatic young llama in Wisconsin (Kiorpes et al., 1987) . Subsequently, Giardia was identified as the enteropathogen involved in 18% of diarrhoea cases in unweaned llama and alpaca crias in Oregon (Cebra et al., 2003) . In addition, data collected between the years 1999 and 2004 from 58 clinical cases of diarrhoea in alpacas less than 4 months of age at Ohio State University revealed that 32.8% of the crias were positive for Giardia spp. (Whitehead and Anderson, 2006) . Recently, Trout et al. (2008) reported the detection of Giardia by PCR analysis in 4.9% of the faecal samples from 61 adult alpacas and crias from two farms in Maryland. The 3 positive samples were obtained from 14 and 27 month old females and from a 13 week old male. In our study, immunofluorescence microscopy and PCR analysis of faecal samples from 274 alpacas originating from 12 herds has revealed a global prevalence of 50.0%, reaching 75.0% in some herds, and highlighting the elevated prevalence of Giardia in these domestic animals. Overall, high percentages (14.3-80.0%) of positive animals were found in all age groups, except 9 weeks in which the 2 samples analysed were negative. Infection rates over 50% were observed in animals of ages 5-10 weeks, and were also elevated in animals as young as 1 week old (42.9%) as well as in older animals, >10 weeks (20.0%). These results are in agreement with data reported in a previous alpaca study for the same age group, 32.8% in animals <8-9 weeks of age (Whitehead and Anderson, 2006) , as well as with the 15.6% found in llamas and alpacas between 4 and 17 weeks of age (Cebra et al., 2003) , although the percentages found here are superior. However, in llamas detection of Giardia was higher in animals 0-2 months of age (25.0%), followed by groups of 2-4 (12.5%), 4-12 (5.3%) and 13-24 (3.2%) months, not detecting the parasite in animals 25 to >96 months of age (Rulofson et al., 2001) .",

            "text": "Cryptosporidium, as Giardia, has been reported in alpacas in the few clinical reports or epidemiological studies performed outside South America. A prevalence of 8.8% was reported by the Veterinary Laboratory Agency Service in England and Wales in samples from alpaca and llama crias submitted for a diagnosis of diarrhoea between 1999 and 2005 (Twomey et al., 2008) . In addition, prevalences of 6.7% and 25.9% were observed in llama and alpaca crias with diarrhoea aged between 1-2 and 1-14 weeks, respectively, from USA (Cebra et al., 2003; Whitehead and Anderson, 2006) . In the present study, the total prevalence for Cryptosporidium was 4.4%, being present in 58.3% of the herds analysed although at very low intensity of infection. The low number of oocysts observed in the faecal samples (<1 oocyst per microscopic field at 400\u00d7 magnification) and the small amount of faecal sample available could account for the differences in detection observed in the present study between immunofluorescence microscopy and PCR. Cryptosporidium spp. oocysts were detected by microscopy in 12 faecal samples, whereas molecular characterisation could only be achieved in 3 of these samples. The highest intraherd prevalence was 13.6%. In contrast to other studies, positive animals were found in age groups 5 (9.1%), 6 (6.6%), 8 (20%) and >10 (5.7%) weeks old. However, Cryptosporidium was not detected in any of the 61 alpaca samples from two Maryland farms (Trout et al., 2008) . This may be due to the age of the animals examined, since in this study, the age range was 10 weeks to 10 years of age.",

In the present work, it was not possible to establish this association although the prevalence for both Giardia and Cryptosporidium detected in diarrhoeic samples was slightly higher. The average intensity of infection observed in diarrhoeic samples, however, was equal to or lower than that observed in nondiarrhoeic samples. This may be due to the age of the animals (>5 weeks in the case of Cryptosporidium) or to the dilution of the diarrhoeic faecal samples. Subclinical infection with Giardia and Cryptosporidium has been previously reported in alpacas (Trout et al., 2008; Twomey et al., 2008) . In addition, G. duodenalis was reported in 3.4% of 354 asymptomatic llamas (Rulofson et al., 2001) . Trout et al. (2008) suggested that the absence of clinical signs could indicate that Giardia might not necessarily be pathogenic in alpacas. However, shedding of the resistant forms of these parasites can extend beyond the period of diarrhoea and excretion is intermittent (Buret et al., 1990; Thompson et al., 2008) , therefore the time at which samples are collected and the number of samples analysed per animal are critical to establish any association with diarrhoea. Nevertheless, subclinical shedding of cysts or oocysts has important implications at herd management level, since apparently healthy animals can be a source of infection to other animals in their vicinity.",

In the present study, DNA sequence analysis revealed that amongst the 92 samples positive by PCR, 67 samples contained G. duodenalis assemblage A; 24 samples G. duodenalis assemblage E; and in the remaining sample there was an inconsistency between the two molecular markers used.

Later, this result was confirmed using several isolates from alpaca crias with and without diarrhoea in USA and UK (Starkey et al., 2007; Twomey et al., 2008) . Similarly, in the present study, C. parvum was identified in two animals. In addition, we describe here the presence, for the first time in this host, of C. ubiquitum in a female alpaca older than 10 weeks of age. This recently named Cryptosporidium species was previously identified as Cryptosporidium cervine genotype and occasionally as the cervid, W4 or genotype 3 genotype, and has been shown by molecular testing to infect the greatest number of host species of any species of Cryptosporidium, being found in domestic and wild ruminants, rodents and primates. C. ubiquitum has also been involved in human infections worldwide, including Peru .",

We also report for the first time the presence of C. ubiquitum in these populations. Because humans can be infected by G. duodenalis assemblage A, the high prevalence of Giardia detected, together with the identification of C. parvum and C. ubiquitum in these samples, suggests that zoonotic transmission of giardiosis and cryptosporidiosis between alpaca and humans can occur, and therefore these animals should be considered as potential sources of infection for humans. In fact, an outbreak of human cryptosporidiosis caused by C. parvum attributable to an alpaca source has been reported (Starkey et al., 2007) . Moreover, and due to the high prevalence of these two protozoan infections in humans in Peru (Checkley et al., 1997; P\u00e9rez Cord\u00f3n et al., 2008) , the inverse situation may also occur. Further studies are therefore needed to investigate the epidemiology of these diseases in Peruvian alpacas.",
