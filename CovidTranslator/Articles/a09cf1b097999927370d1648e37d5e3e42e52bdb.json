Synthetic 21-23 nucleotide (nt) small interfering RNA (siRNA) with 2 nt 3' overhangs was recently found to mediate efficient sequence-specific mRNA degradation in mammalian cells. Here, we studied the effects of synthetic siRNA duplexes targeted to SARS coronavirus structural proteins E, M, and N in a cell culture system. Among total 26 siRNA duplexes, we obtained 3 siRNA duplexes which could sequence-specifically reduce target genes expression over 80% at the concentration of 60 nM in Vero E6 cells. The downregulation effect was in correlation with the concentrations of the siRNA duplexes in a range of 0~60 nM. Our results also showed that many inactive siRNA duplexes may be brought to life simply by unpairing the 5' end of the antisense strands. Results suggest that siRNA is capable of inhibiting SARS coronavirus genes expression and thus may be a new therapeutic strategy for treatment of SARS.",

Specific inhibition of cellular mRNA by RNAi can be triggered in mammalian cells by the introduction of synthetic 21-to 23-nucleotide duplexes of RNA N genes of SARS-CoV and evaluated their effects on viral genes expression in Vero E6 cells. We conclude that the synthetic siRNAs could effectively and sequence-specifically downregulate SARS-CoV genes expression in a dosedependent manner.

These mutated siRNA duplexes were transfected into Vero E6 cells together with the expression vectors of the target genes and the expression levels were measured 48 h posttransfection by RT-PCR. The results showed that the mutated siRNA could reduce target genes expression more effectively (Fig. 4B, 4C) .

In plants, it serves as an antiviral defence mechanism [27] [28] [29] . Recently, the mammalian RNAi machinery has been successfully programmed with siRNAs targeting viral sequences to induce an effective antiviral response. This prompted us to evaluate the effect of siRNA on SARS-CoV. Viruses, especially RNA viruses, are variable due to high mutation rates during replication. The mutated viral proteins can help the viruses to escape immune-system defence mechanisms [30] . These mutations may also escape attack by siRNAs. However, the emergence of escape variants resistant to siRNA can be minimized by using siRNA directed against multiple conserved RNA target sequences. The genome of SARS-CoV encoded 23 putative proteins, including four major structural proteins; nucleocapsid (N), spike (S), membrane (M), and small envelope (E) which played essential roles in host cell entry, viral morphogenesis and release [21, 22] . These structural proteins were attractive targets for anti-SARS agent development. Among these proteins, we selected E, M, and N as the targets of RNAi. The spike protein, a glycoprotein projection on the viral surface, was crucial for viral attachment and entry into the host cell. In addition, variations of S protein among strains of coronavirus are responsible for host range and tissue tropism [31] . The results of genetic sequencing of samples from the latest patient with SARS show variation of S gene in this SARS-CoV strain [32] . Since the S1 subunit of the spike protein is the major antigenic moiety for coronaviruses and is not an essential structural protein, it is prone to have high mutation rates as the virus evolves in host populations [33] . Therefore we don't chose S protein as a target. In this work, we have evaluated the down-regulation effects of 26 siRNA duplexes targeting different sites along the open reading frames of E, M, and N proteins. As shown in Fig.  1 , three siRNA duplexes exhibit over 70% inhibition efficiency, 11 siRNA duplexes showed 40~70% inhibition efficiency, and 12 siRNA duplexes reduced target genes less than 40% at the concentration of 30 nM. By modifying the sense strand of siRNA duplex as shown in Fig. 4 , the inhibition efficiency of many siRNA duplexes may be improved. The combined use of siRNA duplexes targeting different regions of the virus may increase the efficiency of the treatment and, in turn, will prevent the appearance of viral revertants resistant to the treatment.",

Direct cytopathic effects of SARS-CoV could be demonstrated on inoculating the viral isolates into Vero E6 cells [3, 19, 34] , which make Vero E6 cells a suitable model for the study of the effect of siRNA duplex. Because SARS is dangerous for its high morbidity and mortality rates, it is more safe and convenient to study anti-SARS agent by using Vero E6 cells transfected with SARS-CoV genes expression vectors. In this cell model, we obtained sequence-specific downregulation of SARS-CoV genes expression by synthetic siRNA as seen from the results of RT-PCR (Fig. 1) and from a reduced fluorescence intensity of EGFP to which the SARS-CoV protein E, M, or N was fused (Fig. 3) . Inhibition was dose dependent in the range of 0~60 nM and was sustained for 3 d after administration of the siRNA (Fig. 2) . In addition, this model system can be exploited to further study the pathological functions of SARS-CoV genes.",

            "text": "At present, several potential SARS therapies are under development, such as vaccines [35, 36] and interferons [37, 38] . The use of RNAi in the therapy of SARS would be advantageous in its specificity for the target gene with minimized side effects. However, the interference of SARS-CoV genes expression induced by the use of siRNA duplexes is transient. It will be essential to prolong the expression of siRNA and to ensure its delivery. Current methods for prolonging siRNA expression include the use of plasmids that express endogenously the siRNAs. An alternative approach is to express the siRNA from an integrating viral vector to achieve continuous and prolonged expression. A recent article [39] published during the preparation of our work for report on the anti-SARS activity of a short hairpin RNA (shRNA) targeting the S gene expressed from a U6 promoter suggest that RNAi has potential to inhibit the replication of SARS-CoV from the infected Vero E6 cells. In some cases there may be an advantage to using siRNA because of safety issues regarding the administration of foreign DNA into a patient.",
