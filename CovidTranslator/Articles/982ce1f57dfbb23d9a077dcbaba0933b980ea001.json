IgY technology (the use of chicken egg yolk immunoglobulins) is an economic and practical alternative to prevent BRV diarrhea in dairy calves. The aim of this study was to evaluate the protection and immunomodulation induced by the oral administration of egg yolk enriched in BRV specific IgY to experimentally BRV infected calves. All calves in groups Gp 1, 2 and 3 received control colostrum (CC; BRV virus neutralization Ab titer -VN-=65,536; ELISA BRV IgG 1 =16,384) prior to gut closure. After gut closure, calves received milk supplemented with 6% BRV-immune egg yolk [(Gp1) VN=2048; ELISA IgY Ab titer =4096] or non-immune control egg yolk [(Gp2) VN <4; ELISA IgY Ab titer <4) twice a day, for 14 days. Calves receiving CC only or colostrum deprived calves (CD) fed antibody (Ab) free milk served as controls (Gp 3 and 4, respectively). Calves were inoculated with 10 5.85 focus forming units (FFU) of virulent BRV IND at 2 days of age. Control calves (Gp 3 and 4) and calves fed control IgY (Gp 2) were infected and developed severe diarrhea. Around 80% calves in Gp 1 (IgY 4096) were infected, but they showed 80% (4/5) protection against BRV diarrhea. Bovine RV-specific IgY Ab were detected in the feces of calves in Gp 1, indicating that avian antibodies (Abs) remained intact after passage through the gastrointestinal tract. At post infection day 21, the duodenum was the major site of BRV specific antibody secreting cells (ASC) in all experimental groups. Mucosal ASC responses of all isotypes were significantly higher in the IgY treated groups, independently of the specificity of the treatment, indicating that egg yolk components modulated the immune response against BRV infection at the mucosal level. These results indicate that supplementing newborn calves' diets for the first 14 days of life with egg yolk enriched in BRV-specific IgY represents a promising strategy to prevent BRV diarrhea. Moreover a strong active ASC immune response is induced in the intestinal mucosa following BRV infection after the administration of egg yolk, regardless the specificity of the treatment.",

            "text": "Rotaviruses (RV) are responsible for globally significant gastrointestinal disease, primarily in children <5 years of age and the young of other mammalian and avian species, including calves, pigs and South American camelids (Parreno et al., 2001; Ramig, 2004; Saif LJ, 1994) . Diarrhea is the most commonly reported newborn calf disease and the main cause of mortality (Bendali et al., 1999) . Bovine rotavirus (BRV) is the most common pathogen involved in neonatal diarrhea in both dairy and beef herds (da Costa Mendes et al., 1993; Garaicoechea et al., 2006) . Calves are susceptible to BRV diarrhea up to 8 weeks of age and by the third week of life the susceptibility decreases as the age increases (Bridger, 1994; Dhama et al., 2009) . In Argentina, BRV is the main cause of neonatal diarrhea in calves and it was detected in 62.5% (250/400) of calf diarrhea cases in beef and dairy herds during a ten-year-survey from 1994 to 2003 (Garaicoechea et al., 2006) . The BRV diarrhea results in greater financial loss to cattle producers than any other infectious disease, particularly due to reduction of weight gain in affected animals and treatment expenses (Aich et al., 2007; Bellinzoni et al., 1990; Bendali et al., 1999) . There is no specific treatment for BRV diarrhea. Affected animals recieve therapies to replace lost fluids and electrolytes and antibiotics for secondary bacterial infection. The current strategy for the control of the disease is based on vaccination of the mother to protect the offspring by transference of passive Abs (Bellinzoni et al., 1990; Fernandez et al., 1998; Saif et al., 1987) . This strategy reduces severe diarrhea but it does not prevent virus infection or the appearence of clinical signs (Bendali et al., 1999; Parreno et al., 2004; Parre\u00f1o et al., 2010) . A thorough understanding of the mechanisms of intestinal immunity and their correlation with protection of neonates is critical to develop effective vaccines and complementary or alternative passive immunity strategies. Passive immunization by oral administration of specific Abs from different sources such as immune colostrum or chicken egg yolk IgY could represent effective and economic strategies to prevent gastrointestinal infections in food animals.",

            "text": "Rotavirus preferentially infects the mature enterocytes of the upper small intestine, near the tips of the villi. The severity and localization of intestinal infection vary among animal species and between studies; however, the pathological changes are primarily limited to the proximal small intestine (Candy, 2007; Dhama et al., 2009; Estes, 2001; Varshney et al., 1995) . Considering the early susceptibility to the infection, the presence of maternal Abs -IgG 1 and IgA-, derived from unabsorbed colostrum and milk in the gut lumen plays an important role in the protection against BRV infection and disease (Fernandez et al., 1998) . To boost maternal Ab titers, cows are immunized parenterally with BRV vaccines 60 and 30 days before calving (Dhama et al., 2009; Saif and Fernandez, 1996) . High titers of passive circulating Abs in newborn calves play a complementary role in protection against BRV induced diarrhea, because IgG 1 acquired from colostrum is also transferred from serum to the intestine of neonatal calves (Besser et al., 1988) . Virus neutralizing (VN) Ab titers against BRV in newborn calf serum may also be an indicator of protection against BRV diarrhea. However, it has been observed that newborn calves frequently developed BRV diarrhea despite moderately high levels of circulating BRV Abs derived from colostrum and, by the third week of life, most of them have been exposed to BRV in the field (Estes, 2001; Kohara and Tsunemitsu, 2000; Parreno et al., 2004) . Although serum Abs are essential in dairy calves, which are usually separated from their dams after colostrum intake and subsequently fed with milk replacers lacking Abs, we previously demonstrated that BRV specific circulating Abs derived from colostrum intake suppress the development of BRVspecific Abs secreting cell (ASC) responses of neonatal calves in a dose dependent manner at both systemic and mucosal levels (Parreno et al., 2004) . Following the same line of research, in a second study we also demonstrated that the administration of milk supplemented with BRV immune colostrum for the first 14 days of life induced high protection rates against BRV diarrhea in calves and a positive modulation of the neonatal immune responses toward higher numbers of BRV-specific IgA ASC and greater ASC isotype diversity in the intestinal mucosa. It was also shown that this active immune response protected against BRV challenge after the cessation of the passive Ab supplementation (Parre\u00f1o et al., 2010) .",

Bovine RV is highly immunogenic in poultry and IgY technology offers several advantages over the classical ways of Abs production. It is a non-invasive technology, since the Abs can be obtained by collecting eggs, thus animals do not need to be bled. The IgY technology is in alignment with the 3R principles of animal welfare: Reduction, Refinement and Replacement of laboratory animals . The only Ab isotype present in chicken egg yolks is IgY. The isolation of IgY Abs is simple and approximately 1500 mg of IgY can be harvested each month from each laying hen (5-25 mg/egg yolk), with between 2 and 10 % being antigen specific IgY, representing a faster and cheaper way of polyclonal Ab production than other sources. Regarding the function, there are four important differences between avian IgY and mammalian IgG: IgY does not bind protein A or G, nor rheumathoid factor; chicken egg yolk immunoglobulins do not interfere with mammalian IgG in serological tests and they do not activate mammalian complement. These differences are advantageous for the application of IgY technology in many areas, from diagnostics to alternatives to antibiotic therapy (Carlander et al., 2000; Schade et al., 1994; Tini et al., 2002) .",

It has been demonstrated previously that treatment of BRV diarrhea using avian egg yolk enriched in BRV specific IgY Abs during the first 2 weeks of life enhanced body weight gain and markedly reduced BRV infection (virus titer in stools as well as the number of calves shedding virus) (Heckert et al., 1999; Kuroki et al., 1997; Touchette et al., 2003) . This indicates that egg yolk Abs can be a potential tool against BRV infection when administered daily immediately after birth, when BRV incidence is higher. However, there is no information about how these heterologous Abs and egg yolk itself may modulate the mucosal and systemic immune responses of newborn calves against BRV, which are critical for the development of active immunity to future viral exposures.",

In this study, newborn calves received 1L of pooled colostrum from non-immunized dams (control colostrum, CC) previous to gut closure within the first 6 hours of life. To study the protective and modulatory effects of chicken egg yolk Abs, calves were fed after gut closure (24 h of life) for 14 days with commercial Ab-free milk supplemented with crude egg yolk from hens hyperimmunized with BRV. A better understanding of the modulatory effects of local passive heterologous Abs on induction of active systemic and mucosal immune responses against BRV infection will improve the application of this strategy to prevent BRV diarrhea in dairy calves and other animals, including human infants.",

Colostrum feeding and calf inoculation-Twenty-eight newborn Holstein male calves procured from the same dairy farm were removed from their mothers at birth prior to suckling and moved into isolation facilities within the first 4 hours of life. The animals were housed in individual isolation rooms under a strict management protocol as previously described (Parreno et al., 2004) . The protocol for animal management and euthanasia met the requirements of The Institutional Animal Care Committee (IACC) of the Veterinary College (University of Buenos Aires) and the Office of Laboratory Animal Welfare (OLAW, NIH). Calves in Groups (Gp) 1, 2 and 3 received 1 L of control colostrum (CC) within the first 6 hours of life (previous to gut closure). This colostrum had a virus neutralization Ab (VN) titer to BRV of 65,536 and a BRV IgG 1 Ab titer of 16,384 (determined by ELISA) ( Table 1 ). All the animals in these groups reached a circulating BRV IgG 1 Ab titer of ~1024 in serum. Calves in Gp 4 (colostrum deprived -CD-) received 1 L of Ab free milk at this time point. Thereafter, for the first 24 h of life, Ab free milk was given to all the animals (no more than 3 L during this period of time). Animals assigned to passive treament groups (Gp 1 and 2) started the treatment after this period of time, to assure that the administration of heterologous Abs started after gut closure (Stott and Fellah, 1983) . Calves were randomly assigned to one of the following feeding groups: Gp 1: CC + milk supplemented with BRV-specific egg yolk with a final BRV IgY Ab titer of 4096 (n=5); Gp 2: CC + milk supplemented with normal egg yolk with a final BRV IgY Ab titer of <4 (n=6). IgY Ab titers in milk were determined by ELISA. Two groups of calves were negative controls; one received one dose of CC (Gp 3; n=9) and the others were colostrum deprived (CD) calves (Gp 4; n=8) and thereafter were fed milk without BRV Abs (Gonzalez et al., 2010) . Calves in Gp 1 and 2 were fed twice a day with 2 L of each supplemented milk. From day 15 onwards, all calves in these groups were fed with milk without supplemental Abs. The milk used in the experiment was commercial sterilized bovine milk for human consumption (Mastellone Hnos., Bs. As., Argentina) ( Table 1 ). All animals were orally inoculated with 10 5.85 Focus Forming Units (FFU) of virulent INDIANA (IND P[5]G6) BRV between the third and fourth feeding [approximately 36 hours after colostrum intake; 0 post-inoculation day (PID)]. This viral dose was previously confirmed to cause diarrhea and virus shedding in 100% of inoculated CD calves (Parreno et al., 2004) . All the calves were euthanized at 21 PID to study the primary Ab responses to BRV infection.",

Two immune milks containing final IgY Ab titers to BRV of 1024 and 4096 (determined by ELISA) were initially tested in a pilot study. Calves fed milk with a final IgY Ab titer of 1024 were not protected against diarrhea and virus shedding (data not shown), but the supplementation of milk with a final IgY Ab titer of 4096 prevented BRV induced diarrhea in calves. Hence, for the present study, and specifically to address the potential interference effect of the local passive heterologous Ab treatments, we tested a supplemented milk that induced a high protection against diarrhea but not against virus shedding (BRV IgY final Ab titer of 4096) and a milk supplemented with control egg yolk (BRV IgY final Ab titer <4). We compared these with colostrum deprived calves (CD) or calves receiving control colostrum (CC), and fed milk without Abs.",

The results indicate that the treatment caused a significant reduction in the percentage of affected animals, the duration and severity of illness and BRV-associated high temperatures wich also coincided with the presence of BRV IgY Abs in feces. The detection of BRV IgY Abs in feces of Gp 1 treated animals clearly demonstrates that IgY Abs passed through the intestinal tract and remained biologically active. The IgY Abs in feces showed a similar kinetic pattern for all the calves, whereas a decrease in BRV IgY Ab titer was associated with virus shedding. This binding of BRV IgY Abs with infectious virions may explain the absence of diarrhea after this treatment, although the virus replicated in the gut of the newborn calves. In contrast, the supplementation of milk with non-specific crude egg yolk (Gp 2, CONTROL IgY milk), failed to protect calves against diarrhea. The onset, duration and severity of the illness were not reduced in Gp 2 compared to CC or CD calves (Gp 3 and 4, respectively). Eventhough the differences were not statistically significant, the mean BRV titer in feces of control IgY treated calves was higher than in Gp 1 calves (IgY 4096).",

Consequently, no IgY Abs were detected in serum samples from any of the animals from Gp 1 or 2 (BRV IgY 4096 and CONTROL IgY, respectively); thus, no systemic effects were expected or observed after oral administration of egg yolk.",

Typical nutrient analysis of liquid eggs shows 55 % protein, 40 % fat and 4 % ash, and also they are a valuable source of iron, phosphorous, trace minerals and vitamins. For this reason, egg yolk and whole eggs have been studied extensively as an alternative protein source for animal feeding, with promising results. Most of the authors conclude that when egg is included at levels up to 10 % of the diet (around 30 % of the total protein), growth performance of the calves is improved or similar to that observed when they receive only Ab free milk diets (Touchette et al., 2003) . In our work, we supplemented the milk diet of newborn calves with 6.25 % of crude egg yolk (Gp 1 and Gp 2). Calves fed milk supplemented with egg yolk enriched in IgY Abs to BRV (Gp 1), showed significantly increased mean body weights compared with calves fed milk supplemented with control egg yolk (Gp 2) (p=0.0182) post-BRV challenge. Similar results have been reported by Kuroki et al. in calves under field conditions (Kuroki et al., 1997) . These results indicate that the effect of crude egg yolk itself on body weight gain is improved by the presence of BRV specific IgY Abs, which induced high protection rates against BRV diarrhea.",

It is unclear whether this immunomodulation is due to the Abs themselves or to the presence of other bioactive factors, when colostrum is the source of BRV IgG 1 Abs. When the milk diet was supplemented with crude chicken egg yolk, a significant diversification and enhancement of the local immune responses against BRV was observed. Duodenum, jejunum lamina propria and ileocecal MLN were the primary tissues involved and IgA was the dominant ASC isotype, followed by IgG 2 instead of IgG 1 . Interestingly, this effect was independent of the specificity of the treatment and was significantly more pronounced than the one observed previously in calves receiving milk supplemented with the same titer of homologous bovine IgG 1 Abs from colostrum (Parre\u00f1o et al., 2010) . These results are in agreement with the presence of immunomodulating molecules in egg yolk, that promote B cell clonal expansion and IgA switching related to anti-inflammatory responses to dietary antigens (Nelson, 2007) .",

            "text": "It is unclear which component of crude egg yolk is responsible for the observed increase numbers of ASC to BRV in calves from Groups 1 and 2. There are many possible explanations for the immunomodulatory properties of crude egg yolk. Bioactive molecules (hormones and cytokines) are present in egg yolk. Xu et al. described the immunomodulatory properties of Tranfer factor (TF) found in the egg yolk of immunized hens. The TF increases the thymus-spleen index and stimulates proliferation of lymphocytes in mice. This factor seems to have not only specific immune activity against Hepatitis B virus but also non-specific immune activity, making it a potential immunoregulator in egg yolk for enhancing treatments for this viral infection (Xu et al., 2006) . Nelson et al. also found that egg yolk protein digests from non-immunized hens have immunomodulatory activities in the gut in vivo. They may act directly to block pathogen entry or indirectly by the activation of the immune system to prevent the infection. These authors further demonstrated that an egg yolk low lipid peptide digest induced IgA ASC in the gut which prevent or limit adherence and colonization by enteropathogens. Also the egg yolk compound orchestrated Th1/Th2 responses, inducing the secretion of IL-4 and IL-10, potent activators of B cells and anti-inflamatory agents in the gut (Nelson, 2007) . It is also well known that egg lysophosphatidylcholines (LPCs) possess adjuvant properties, promoting dendritic cell maturation and a Th1-oriented response in vitro and inducing a Th2 Ab response against specific viral antigens, when administered systemically in mice (Bach et al., ; Perrin-Cocon et al., 2006) .",
