Although of pivotal importance, comparative genomic procedures that rely on homology inference are obviously not applicable if no homologous regions are detectable. This fact excludes a considerable portion of \"genomic dark matter\" with no significant similarityand, consequently, no inferred homology to any other known sequencefrom several downstream comparative genomic methods. In this review we compile several sequence metrics that do not rely on homology inference and can be used to compare nucleotide sequences and extract biologically meaningful information from them. These metrics comprise several compositional parameters calculated from sequence data alone, such as GC content, dinucleotide odds ratio, and several codon bias metrics. They also share other interesting properties, such as pervasiveness (patterns persist on smaller scales) and phylogenetic signal. We also cite examples where these homologyindependent metrics have been successfully applied to support several bioinformatics challenges, such as taxonomic classification of biological sequences without homology inference. They where also used to detect higher-order patterns of interactions in biological systems, ranging from detecting coevolutionary trends between the genomes of viruses and their hosts to characterization of gene pools of entire microbial communities. We argue that, if correctly understood and applied, homology-independent metrics can add important layers of biological information in comparative genomic studies without prior homology inference.",

The failure to detect such regions prevents the application of virtually any HD method and excludes several interesting classes of DNA sequences from further analysis.

Such metrics, from now on referred as homology-independent (HI) metrics, can be easily calculated for virtually any fragment of any genome that fulfills a few criteria, such as minimum length and complexity. These metrics usually detect biases by comparing the observed frequencies of nucleotide words, especially dinucleotide and codons, with expected frequencies for the same words. The dinucleotide usage patterns in a given genome are commonly referred in the scientific literature as genomic signatures, since they are also taxon-specific and highly conserved in a given genome [12] [13] [14] .

In fact, several nucleotide motifs (such as the \"TATA box\") interact with the transcription/ translation machinery and are classic examples of conservation of nucleotide words in genomic sequences due to selection pressure [18] . Another classic cause of variation in nucleotide words (codons) induced by selection pressure is the more-than-expected usage of synonymous codons that corresponds to the more abundant aminoacyl-tRNAs in cell cytoplasm in order to increase translation speed/efficiency, a selection pressure particularly strong in single-celled organisms [19] and in highly-expressed genes [20] . A final broad class of factors known to influence the use of nucleotide words in genomes is the occurrence of neutral processes such as genetic drift during the course of evolution [21] . Therefore, if properly modeled and interpreted, the results obtained through HI metrics in comparative genomic studies can highlight broad patterns of mutational and selective forces as well as random variations acting in the genomes under analysis.",

Different HI metrics consider factors such as GC content, observed frequencies of smaller words that compose the word under analysis, degeneracy of the genetic code and amino acid usage, among others, when calculating null models. Therefore, any bias detected using HI metrics with proper null models is not explainable by factors already taken into account when computing null models, and represent biological phenomena that require further explanation/investigation. Also, several HI metrics are pervasive in the sense that values for whole genomes should persist at smaller scales. Some HI metrics remain reasonably constant for fragments with as few as 125 base pairs when compared with values calculated for entire genomes, or even when comparing coding and non-coding regions of genomes, making HI metrics a robust option to develop procedures to classify nucleotide sequences to taxonomic units, as in the case of genomic signatures [13] .",

For instance, several pipelines for classification of sequences from environmental genomics to taxonomic space (binning procedures in metagenomics studies) rely on HI metrics [41] [42] [43] . Additionally, other classification methods to detect subsequences with biased distribution of HI metrics within longer genomic sequences could be used to detect several cases of exogenous DNA in a given genome. Several tools already make use of HI metrics for this purpose aiming at detecting important classes of evolutionary events, such as general cases of horizontal gene transfer (HGT) [44] [45] [46] and the detection of particular cases of HGT, such as genomic/pathogenicity islands [47] and phage integration sites [48] . For some groups of organisms such as large DNA viruses, HI metrics are sometimes the only class of tools available to study how these genomes evolved such large repertories of ORFans and to demonstrate that they arrived through multiple HGT events [11] .",

Such metrics were recently used to detect community-specific signatures of synonymous codon usage biases in metagenomic samples from different ecological niches. Such biased codons correlate with expression levels and occur regardless of individual phylogeny of organisms [49] . Additionally, such community-specific codon usage biases also predict lifestyle-specific genes, detecting coding sequences relevant for adaptation of organisms to specific ecological niches. These studies revealed a higher level of organization of metagenomic samples, where entire microbial communities share gene pools optimized for cross-genome translation and behave as a single meta-genome. Codon usage biases alone are also capable to predict other features for single microorganisms and/or microbial communities such as growth speed [50] and can be used to infer gene function based solely on the evolutionary changes for translation efficiency [51] .",

The Flaviviridae family is composed of monophyletic viruses that infect vertebrate (mammals and birds) and/or invertebrate (ticks and mosquitoes) organisms. This work assumes that Flaviviridae that infect a single host lineage would be subjected to specific host-induced pressures and, therefore, selected by them. The authors observed that the two host groups possess very distinctive dinucleotide and codon usage patterns. A pronounced CpG under-representation was found in the vertebrate group, possibly induced by the methylationdeamination process, exclusive of vertebrate genomes, as well as a prominent TpA decrease. The invertebrate group displayed only a TpA frequency reduction bias, with no CpG bias. Flaviviridae viruses mimicked host nucleotide motif usage in a host-specific manner. Vertebrate-infecting viruses possessed under-representation of CpG and TpA, and insect-only viruses displayed only a TpA underrepresentation bias. Especially, single-host Flaviviridae members which persistently infect mammals or insect hosts (Hepacivirus and insect-only Flavivirus, respectively) were found to possess a codon usage profile more similar to that of their hosts than to phylogenetically related Flaviviridae. Vertebrates and mosquito genomes are under very distinct lineage-specific constraints, and Flaviviridae viruses which specifically infect these lineages appear to be subject to the same evolutionary pressures that shaped their host coding regions, evidencing lineage-specific coevolutionary processes between viral and host genomes that could not be surveyed using HD metrics.",

In common, all these metrics are: 1) calculated from genomic sequence data alone; 2) do not rely on homology inference and 3) add a new layer of biologically meaningful data to the genomes under analysis, such as taxonomic information in the case of genomic signatures, but also other information such as putative gene expression profiles and convergent coevolutionary patterns.",

Genomic sequences from disparate groups that contain some niche superposition, such distinct species of microorganisms belonging to the same ecological community or viruses and their respective hosts coexisting in the same environment, were found to possess surprising patterns of coevolutionary events not known before HI metrics were applied to investigate them.
