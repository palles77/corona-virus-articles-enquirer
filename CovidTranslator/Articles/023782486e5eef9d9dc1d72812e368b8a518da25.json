Painstaking measurements of the rise and fall of antibodies against the supposed agent in many patients will do it, Hall suggested. \"Loads of samples are being taken from patients, and if we can see IgM antibodies to one of these agents rise and then fall, and then IgG antibodies starting to appear, and nothing else happening, and if these antibodies are specific to the agent, that's the next stage.\" DNA studies will also contribute. Although paramyxoviruses and coronaviruses are common, if a particular sequence variant of a virus were found to be common among patients with the disease, but rare in the general population, that would be a further indicator.",
