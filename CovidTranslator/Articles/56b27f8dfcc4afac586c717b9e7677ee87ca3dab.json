The sporadic occurrence of this disease and the fact that as yet no pathogenetic factor has been singled out as playing a decisive role might indicate that in a particular patient a number of unfortunate circumstances concurr. Of relevance to the pathogenesis could be predisposing factors in the patient himself, the virus dose, or the site of replication at primary infection, as well as neurovirulent properties of the virus. Data have been presented in support of HSV-1 strain variability of neurovirulence in mouse models (4-7) and in rabbits (8). Attempts have been made to pinpoint the HSV-1 genes regulating neurovirulence by the use of recombinant strains (9-12) or deletion mutants (13) volved. However, whether the pathogenesis in HSV-1 encephalitis in man is influenced by the neurovirulence of HSV-1 strains is still not known. Herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2) is a rare cause of encephalitis in man (2) , and in most cases reported the patients have been immunocompromised (14, 15) . Instead, HSV-2 may sometimes induce a serous meningitis when HSV-2 infection spreads from the genital tract to the CNS (16, 17) . Symptoms of meningitis are far more common in primary HSV-2 infection, where the surface area of involvement is larger and the duration of virus shedding longer, as compared with secondary HSV-2 infection (i.e. the first episode of HSV-2 infection preceded by an HSV-1 infection) (18) . These findings indicate possible relevance of virus load from the periphery in the development of HSV-2 meningitis, but the potential virulence properties of HSV-2 strains causing meningitis have not yet been described.",

Eight of these strains were derived from biopsies (patients no. 1-8, Table  1 ) performed during a trial of antiviral treatment of HSV encephalitis (3). All biopsies were taken before the commencement of antiviral treatment. In three of these patients (no. 1, 2 and 3), serological data were consistent with a probable primary HSV-1 infection (low level or absence of HSV-1 IgG antibodies and presence of HSV lgM antibodies in the first serum sample) at the time of the encephalitis, while four had serologic evidence of reactivated HSV-1 infection. In one patient, serological data were missing. Two HSV-1 strains were isolated from brain material obtained at autopsy of two patients who died of encephalitis before receiving antiviral treatment (patients no. 8 and 10, Table I ) and in whom serologic data (high levels of HSV-1 IgG antibodies at onset) indicated reactivation. As controls, we used ten HSV-1 strains isolated from oral lesions in patients without neurological symptoms seen at the Department of Dermatology, University of GOteborg, These strains are referred to as HSV-1 REF strains. Also included is an HSV-1 strain which we isolated from the CSF of a patient during the first bout of multiple sclerosis. The isolate was designated HSV-1 BAN and was recently described in more detail (23) . Laboratory reference strains (HSV-1 LABREF) used were F (B. Roizman, Chicago), Mclntyre (A. Nahmias, Atlanta) and our own strain KJ 502 (24) . In fourteen patients with meningitis, HSV-2 was isolated from CSF (HSV-2 MEN) at either the Department of Virology, University of G0teborg (six strains) or at the Department of Virology, Stockholm County Central Microbiological Laboratory (eight strains). HSV-2 clinical reference strains (HSV-2 REF) were isolated from genital lesions in ten patients with HSV-2 infection without neurological symptoms seen at the Department of Dermatology, University of G6teborg.

Seven of the Data from i.c. and nose inoculation in mice were combined to classify all HSV-1 strains into three classes of neurovirulence ( Table 2 ). The nature of this difference was further investigated by monitoring virus replication at three levels (skin, trigeminal ganglia and brainstem) after nose inoculation with these two strains and the Class III (a0) HSV-1 LABREF strain F. As shown in Figure 2 , HSV-1 replication reached its maximum after 2 to 4 days in the periphery, after 3 to 5 days in ganglia, and after 4 to 7 days in the brainstem with all three strains.

When the infectious dose was lowered, although KJ 502 replicated better at all levels, strain McIntyre barely replicated in the brainstem, while the highly neuroinvasive strain KJ 502 readily progressed to the brainstem level. In Figure 3 , results from the assessment of virulence after i.e. or nose inoculation of HSV-2 strains are depicted. Generally, log PFU/LDs0 values were lower for the HSV-2 strains than for the HSV-1 strains. After i.c. inoculation, HSV-2 meningitis strains were significantly (p < 0.01) more virulent as compared with the HSV-2 reference strains, but no difference was found after nose inoculation.",

            "text": "The pathogenesis of encephalitis caused by HSV-1 is largely unknown. The sporadic occurrence and scarcity of underlying immunocompromising conditions found in patients (26) may suggest pathogenetic relevance of viral alteration by recombination (27) or mutation. Although the existence and genomic locations of HSV neurovirulence have been well documented in experimental studies (5, 10, 12, 13), the link between neurovirulence in humans in the form of encephalitis and neurovirulence in animal models has hitherto not been established. The HSV-1 brain isolates used in this study were all proven to be neuropathogenic to man by causing encephalitis with either a fatal outcome or sequelae in spite of antivirat treatment. The peripheral route of nose infection, where virus particles reach the brain via the trigeminal pathway by neuron to neuron transmission (28) , was chosen to imitate the probable route that HSV-1 travels when this virus causes encephalitis in humans (29) . The virulence to mice displayed by encephalitits-inducing HSV-1 strains by this route of infection suggests that invasiveness is a property of relevance for HSV-1 neurovirulence. Furthermore, we have shown that the same encephalitis-inducing strains also were significantly more invasive as compared with the HSV-1 REF strains in an in vitro model using cultured rat sensory neurons in a dual-chamber system permitting infection of neuritic extensions only (30) . In experimentally infected animals, spread along sensory neurons has been found to be the main route by which HSV enters the CNS (31, 32) . HSV strain variability in capacity to invade the CNS has been described (4, 6), and non-neuroinvasive strains have been found to be unable to progress from sensory ganglia to the CNS (33, 34) . In our study, results of viral replication at peripheral, ganglionic and brainstem levels after nose inoculation of mice indicate that the neuroinvasive HSV-1 LABREF strain KJ502 differs from the non-neuroinvasive strains Mc-Intyre and F by its greater ability to reach and to replicate in the brainstem. One of the HSV-2 isolates in this study was derived from a patient who was part of an epidemiotogicat chain of three subjects who all suffered from meningitis after genital herpes infection. This might suggest the existence of HSV-2 strains that are more prone to induce meningitis, but studies on virulence characteristics of isolates from patients with meningitis are lacking. The finding in this study that CNS-derived meningitis-inducing HSV-2 strains showed enhanced neurovirulence after i.c. inoculation in mice might indicate the existence of such a strain characteristic. This characteristic was not revealed by the peripheral route of nose inoculation used here. The clinical picture of HSV-2 induced meningitis described earlier (16, 17) with local neurological signs in the lumbosacral region but without spread to the brain or higher regions of the spinal cord may suggest that HSV-2 is a weakly neuroinvasive virus in adults. However, studies on HSV-2 invasiveness after genital inoculation in animals with meningitis-inducing strains are needed to further address this question, since a difference exists in tropism between HSV-1 and HSV-2 (1).",

            "text": "A connection between HSV-1 neurovirUlence in vivo and replicative capacity has been suggested (11), but conflicting data have been presented. In later studies, neither an avirulent strain (34) nor a virulent strain (t0) showed any correlation between virulence and replication in different cell lines. The indications of HSV-1 and HSV-2 neurovirulence properties of CNS-derived isolates found in vivo in our study were not paratlelled by higher replication yields in either a highly permissive non-neuronal (GMK-AH-1) or a mouse neuroblastoma (C1300) cell line giving low replication yields. On the other hand, a tendency towards lower replication yields in C1300 cells was seen for the Class III nonneurovirulent strains in comparison with the Class I strains (t = 2.15, Student's t-test). Likewise, the strain HSV-1 BAN from a patient with multiple sclerosis, which displayed weak neurovirulence in vivo, gave a markedly low replication yield in both cell types. Restricted viral replication as a pathogenetic factor in demyelination was found in a study of mice infected with mutants of the coronavirus mouse hepatitis virus (35) , and has earlier been suggested for HSV in humans in a hypothesis on multiple sclerosis (36) . However, we have not been able to test this hypothesis properly, due to the lack of additional viral isolates from the CNS of patients with multiple sclerosis. In man, HSV-1 induced CNS infections such as encephalitis are rare events although this virus is neurotropic and commonly recovered from sensory ganglia at autopsy (37) . The suggestion derived from our data that the HSV-1 strain characteristic of neuroinvasiveness is linked to encephalitis indicates the usefulness of welldefined clinical isolates in the further study of HSV neuropathogenesis.",
