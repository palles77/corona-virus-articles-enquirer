            "text": "Although severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) has wreaked havoc in Southeast Asia and other parts of the world, it appears to be a disease that predominantly affects adults. Less than 10% of the infected population were children. Among these infected children, only 5% required intensive care unit admission, and less than 1% required mechanical ventilation. In contrast to its adult counterpart, the clinical course of affected children is usually milder, the time to resolution is shorter, and the potential of children to infect others is low. These very different features in children have led some to create the acronym \"MARS\" (mild acute respiratory syndrome). This chapter will discuss the clinical features, radiologic presentation, management, and outcome of children suffering from SARS based on our institutional experience.",

It has been estimated that at least 12 guests and visitors to this hotel became infected through contact with this medical doctor directly or indirectly. The disease then spread from Hong Kong rapidly to Hanoi, Singapore, and Toronto when infected visitors and guests returned to their home countries. One of the infected visitors, the index case of Hong Kong's first outbreak, was admitted to the Prince of Wales Hospital in early March with pneumonia, and he subsequently infected 138 hospital staff, patients, and visitors. 1 The use of nebulized medications in the index case is believed to have caused this very extensive hospital outbreak, since nebulization could have generated a large amount of infective droplets. The first few pediatric cases were household contacts of the initial cohort of adult patients from the hospital outbreak. At that time, SARS had not yet been recognized as a highly infectious disease. The disease involving health care workers spread rapidly to the community by visitors to the hospital wards.",

Whether such coinfections contribute to enhancing the pathogenesis or transmission of the disease is still unclear.

Viruses closely related to SARS-CoV have recently been isolated from animals such as civet cats. 11 It is postulated that SARS-CoV was an animal virus that had overcome the species barrier and adapted to human-to-human transmission. The presence of this animal reservoir may imply possible future animal-to-human transmission and the initiation of further disease outbreaks.",

[13] [14] [15] The predominant and most consistent symptom is fever, which is present in most of the patients (>90%) so far diagnosed to have SARS. Other symptoms include coryza and cough. Chills, rigor, myalgia, and malaise, which are common in adult patients, may also be present in older children and adolescents, but are rare in young children. Some patients, adults and children alike, may present with diarrhea. Young children appear to have milder disease with shorter time period to resolution, while the course of disease in older children is more similar to that of the adults. It is unclear why children, especially those under the age of 12 years, would be less severely affected, but it might be because they have been exposed to many other respiratory viruses, which could make their immune systems more resilient. Others have proposed that young children are not able to mount a \"heightened\" mature immune response as seen in adult patients during the immune dysregulation phase of SARS and thus suffer less organ damage with its associated morbidity and mortality. Besides, children in general present with fewer comorbidities than adults. Physical examination is normal in most if not all young children, whereas inspiratory crackles over the lung bases are present in some adolescent and adult patients.",

These laboratory parameters, together with the presenting clinical features, may help in the clinical diagnosis of the disease. We have also studied the inflammatory cytokine profile in SARS patients. They have markedly raised concentrations of circulating interleukin-1\u03b2, which may suggest the selective activation of the caspase-1-dependent pathway. Other key proinflammatory cytokines (interleukin-6 and tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1) were only mildly elevated; this is in sharp contrast to H5N1 influenza infection, in which these cytokines are significantly elevated. 16 ",

Ground-glass opacification and consolidation are the two predominant features on high-resolution CT. It is common to find a combination of both findings. There is, however, no specific preference of distribution of the disease in children; approximately equal involvement of subpleural and peribronchial regions has been observed. In patients with multifocal disease, a mosaic pattern of lung attenuation with ground-glass and airspace infiltrates is observed, simulating the appearance of bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia. Again, the aforementioned radiologic appearances are nonspecific.

            "text": "The treatment of children with SARS is largely based on adult experience and has not been subject to controlled trials. The actual pathogenesis is poorly understood. SARS predominantly presents radiologically with ground-glass opacification and pathologically as revealed from autopsy results of fatal adult cases, diffuse alveolar damage, hyaline membrane formation, and scanty interstitial inflammatory-cell infiltrates. 22 Treatment during the outbreak therefore include agents against SARS-CoV as well as anti-inflammatory therapy to prevent viral replicationinduced pneumonitis and subsequent pulmonary fibrosis. 23 Our initial practice is to treat children with suspect SARS with antibiotics covering organisms associated with both common bacterial and atypical pneumonia (e.g., Streptococcus pneumoniae and Mycoplasma). We would add oral ribavirin 40 to 60 mg/kg/day in three 8-hourly doses if a definite contact history makes SARS very likely. If the symptoms, especially fever and general well-being, do not respond to the treatment within 48 hours, corticosteroid will be commenced in the form of oral prednisolone 1 to 2 mg/kg/day in two divided doses or IV hydrocortisone 1 to 2 mg/kg/dose every 6 hours. If fever persists or when there is clinical deterioration or progressive chest radiograph change, pulse methylprednisolone 10 mg/kg/dose will be given every 24 hours for up to three doses, depending on clinical response. Oral ribavirin will at the same time be changed to 20 to 60 mg/kg/day intravenously given every 8 hours. Steroid will be continued for a total of 2 weeks in the form of prednisolone 1 to 2 mg/kg/ day or hydrocortisone 1 to 2 mg/kg/dose every 6 hours after methylprednisolone. If the child's condition improves, the steroid will then be reduced to half the dose and gradually tapered off over a week. However, if the chest radiograph is still abnormal by day 21, low-dose steroid will be continued for a longer time and slowly tapered off according to clinical and radiologic assessment. In the younger children in whom the infection appears to run a milder course, an obvious question is whether treatment with either medication, either alone or in combination, is of any benefit. This question can only be answered by properly conducted randomized controlled trial.",

The efficacy of other possible agents against SARS-CoV such as Kaletra (ritonavir 400 mg and lopinavir 100 mg) has been assessed. The combination when used with concomitant ribavirin yielded significantly better clinical outcome in adult patients. 26 There are also strong advocates for not using corticosteroids at all, for fear of secondary sepsis and other complications (such as avascular necrosis). Not only is the efficacy of steroid therapy unproven in SARS, its timing and dosage regimens are also controversial. The general consensus is now to consider steroid therapy as second-line treatment to be reserved for those with severe or worsening disease.",

Persistent radiologic abnormalities in the form of air trapping and ground-glass opacification were found in 34% of the study group. Need for oxygen supplementation and lymphopenia during the course of illness were found to be risk factors predisposing an individual to such abnormal radiology. Those with persistent radiologic abnormality had lung function similar to those with normal CT thorax. However, their oxygen consumption at peak exercise was significantly reduced compared with those with normal radiographs. We will continue to see the effects of SARS on children long after the epidemic is over. Many children have experienced quarantine-imposed separation from their families and are not yet mature enough to understand the rationale. Some have lost many family members within a relatively short time period and have had their normal routines destroyed. In addition, they are bombarded daily with images of the disease in the form of the ubiquitous surgical masks, unprecedented media coverage, and community upheaval. The psychologic impact of this epidemic may become the major long-term sequelae as time goes by.",

Nosocomial transmission of the disease can effectively be stopped by enforcement of routine standard, contact, and droplet precautions in all clinical areas, and additional airborne precautions in all high-risk areas. During the SARS period, we adopted the policy of having a dedicated team of doctors and nurses providing care to all patients admitted to the designated SARS areas. We also have separate wards for patient triage, confirmed SARS cases, and step-down of patients in whom SARS has been ruled out. Designated changing rooms and areas for gowning and ungowning are also identified. We have summarized our experience in isolation procedures and the use of personal protection equipment in a recently published article. 29 An important lesson that we learned from this SARS epidemic relates to the need to enhance infection control programs in hospitals. A reliable alert mechanism, good communication among hospital staff members, efficient surveillance infrastructure, and continuing education to promote importance of appropriate patient care practices (especially hand washing) are vital ingredients for a successful infection control program. There are still many unanswered questions about the virus; its other possible modes of transmission, its infectivity during the incubation period and after clinical recovery, and whether it will become an endemic disease will have to be established.",
