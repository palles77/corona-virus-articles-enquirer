            "text": "The powerful protective capability of innate immune defenses has not always been fully appreciated, likely because of its very success in shielding the body from an enormous array of potential infections. Backed by much new information on the molecular and cellular makeup of our inborn defenses, innate immunity is now seen as the major mechanism to prevent footholds by invading microbes, slowing and containing them until adaptive immune T and B cells can respond and clear the infection. Analyses of the human genome continue to identify new genes serving innate immune functions. 1 The fundamental role of innate immunity in host defense is well reflected by the presence in bacterial, viral, and parasitic pathogens of elaborate mechanisms for the evasion of innate immunity (reviews in Nature Immunology volume 3, November, 2002) . Microarray analyses reveal numerous and highly significant changes in gene transcription in cells of the innate immune system after exposure to pathogens, 2 but at the same time, mutations in single genes of innate immune receptors might greatly increase the risk of infection or sepsis. 3, 4 The needs of biodefense to protect against a broad and largely unforeseen spectrum of pathogens has provided impetus to develop rational methods to call into play innate immune defenses (discussed below). 5, 6 Unlike the adaptive immune system, on which current vaccination and immunotherapeutic approaches are based, the innate immune system has evolved over millennia to function within moments of encountering either ancient or newly emerging pathogens. Although constitutively in place, the innate immune system is activated by the presence of microbes or certain of their products, providing a rationale for a potential biodefense strategy. Both prophylactic and postexposure strategies involving innate immune stimulation have been shown to be plausible to prevent or ameliorate infections in animal models. [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] Furthermore, many of the microbial compounds that activate innate immunity can be synthesized and optimized as artificial molecules. Examples include LPS, double-stranded RNA, DNA oligonucleotides containing unmethylated CpG motifs, [13] [14] [15] or even analogs of the essential amino acid isoleucine, 16 suggesting that compounds more akin to drugs than vaccines might constitute the next generation of immune system activators (Fig 1) .",

            "text": "Although the innate immune system functions in all tissues and organs, its role is especially prominent in those areas that are highly exposed to the external environment: the skin, digestive and genitourinary tracts, and airways. Not only are these regions of the body precisely those that are most vulnerable to attack by bioterrorist weapons, but they are also relatively accessible for potential interventions. Innate immune defenses are based on both the cells permanently located within tissues and on the migration of additional cells to the site of infection as needed. The innate immune system cellular network includes Langerhans cells of the skin, tissue dendritic cells and macrophages, and tissue-associated lymphocytes, such as natural killer (NK) cells and \u03b3 \u03b4 receptor T cells, which trigger these early responses to infection. Furthermore, many epithelial cells can sense and take action against microbes, including by means of secretion of antimicrobial peptides that directly act on the invaders, as well as upregulation of cytokines and chemokines that call additional cells into action, including signaling T and B cells that an infection is present. The key to rapid innate responses is the expression of highly specialized receptors, including the family of toll-like receptors (TLRs), which trigger cellular activation to molecules that constitute recurrent patterns of microbial structures. These targets include LPS, teichoic acid, flagellin, cell-wall lipoproteins, highly mannosylated polymers, and nucleic acids. 17 Furthermore, the immediate defensive steps triggered by innate immune activation also attack targets widespread among pathogens: antimicrobial peptide formation of pores in bacterial cell walls, IFN-\u03b1 and IFN-\u03b2 action against viral replication, and activation of the alternate complement pathway. 18 Innate immune activation also triggers and paves the way for an adaptive immune response by antigen-specific T and B lymphocytes. Immature dendritic cells activated through their TLRs undergo a maturation process that includes migration to the local lymph node, expression of costimulatory molecules needed for lymphocyte activation, and processing and presentation of engulfed antigens (ie, protein antigens in the context of MHC class I and class II molecules and lipid materials by CD1 proteins). Thus innate immunity sounds the alarm that infection has occurred, summons defenses, and initiates antigen-specific T-and B-cell responses. For many years, FIG 1. Comparison of proposed innate immune stimulation strategies with conventional vaccination. Vaccination uses whole pathogens or their subunits to expand antigen-specific B and T cells, leading to the development of specific and highly effective long-term protection over several weeks. Innate immune stimulants will likely be chemically synthesized compounds, possibly delivered by means of aerosol, that activate dendritic cells, macrophages, and other cells in a nonclonal manner aimed to provide rapid, broad, but impermanent protection against many potential pathogens.",

[7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] The recent finding of immune protective effects in primates administered CpG before and shortly after infection suggests that human subjects might also benefit. 19 Importantly, the same study showed that macaques infected with simian immunodeficiency virus also exhibited reduced parasite lesions, supporting the notion that stimulation of innate immunity can have protective effects despite an infection that affects adaptive immunity. Protective effects correlated in some cases with the release of IFN-\u03b3 and IL-12, 12 but overall, the precise mechanisms of protection are not well understood.",

For example, synthetic immunostimulants that signal through TLR4 induced protective responses in mice against the influenza virus and Listeria species. 13 In a natural infection many distinct innate immune receptors contribute together to the innate immune response. [20] [21] [22] Current data indicate that stimulation of multiple TLR receptors leads to synergistic cytokine production. 23 This variety of signaling might lead to a highly effective protection that would be beneficial to mimic with immunotherapeutic approaches; one method might be to test the combination of differently targeted agonists, such as using TLR4 and TLR9 ligands together to more closely mimic the innate immune responses observed in natural infections. Therefore innate immune stimulation strategies have the potential to tap into complex and effective responses by using rationally designed molecules. Whether innate immune stimulation strategies would be effective depends on a number of factors: How do microbes activate innate immunity, and can that be effectively mimicked? Will innate immune defenses elicited by pure compounds elicit the full range of innate immune defenses? Will pathogen immune system evasion strategies negate attempts to use this approach? Will heterogeneity in health, age, and genes for innate immune system function in the human population prevent the use of innate immune system stimulation approaches?",

Antimicrobial peptides can be present in high concentrations locally and destroy many bacteria by mechanisms distinct from those of antibiotics in current use. 26 Reactive oxygen and nitrogen radicals constitute major lethal defenses against intracellular bacteria. Bacteria coated with innate immune surfactants or mannose-binding protein, often including complement activated by the alternate (innate immune) pathway, are opsonized and more readily phagocytosed. It seems reasonable that at least the extracellular mediators of the innate immune system, such as innate opsonins, complement components, and certain antimicrobial peptides, could be effective antibacterial agents. For example, antimicrobial peptides have shown positive clinical results and can be synthetically modified to reduce toxicity to human cells while maintaining antibacterial activity. 27 With over 700 antimicrobial peptides from various species listed in a central database (http://www.bbcm.univ.trieste.it/~tossi/pag1.html), development of certain peptides into broad-spectrum treatments that would be at least partially effective against unknown or poorly defined bioterrorist agents seems possible and highly attractive. The question of selection of bacteria resistant to antimicrobial peptides needs to be taken into account. Multiple mechanisms of resistance to microbial peptides are known, including constitutive insensitivity and inducible modifications of the bacterial cell (reviewed in Yeaman and Yount 28 ).

The outer membrane protein Omp25 of Brucella suis inhibits TNF-\u03b1, a major innate and adaptive immune cytokine that combats B suis infection. 32 Bordetella pertussis possesses at least 6 known virulence factors the major effects of which are on macrophages, monocytes, and neutrophils, including the inhibition of cytokine release, oxidative responses, intracellular killing, chemotaxis, and phagocytic function. 33 Thus pathogenic bacteria possess multiple and highly effective means of counteracting innate immune activation and defensive functions. Indeed, certain bacteria might even take advantage of the local inflammation and cellular activation induced by innate responses to further their own survival and spread. For example, innate immune induction of TNF expression in human alveolar macrophages stimulates the intracellular replication of virulent Mycobacterium tuberculosis, even though overall the cytokine appears to have a protective effect. 34 Therefore although the innate immune system possesses a wide array of microbial detection and host defense mechanisms, pathogen evasion is the norm. Protection by means of innate immune stimulation is likely to be of varying degrees of effectiveness depending on the specific agent, and highly virulent bacteria might well be those with the best innate immune evasion mechanisms. Stimulation of a specific innate immune countermeasure as a biodefense strategy needs to take into account whether it might be preferable to aim for a pathway other than that targeted by a particular microbe's evasion mechanism or whether that pathway might be precisely the one to overactivate because it is undeniably implicated in the pathogen's survival.",

Evasion of the effects of IFN-\u03b1 and IFN-\u03b2 is highly developed in many viruses and, in some smaller viruses, might be linked mainly to the function of single or a few viral genes. Genes functioning in IFN evasion include the NS1 protein of influenza A and B viruses; gp35 of Ebola; NSs of Rift Valley fever virus; the V, W, and C proteins of Nipah virus; and Newcastle disease virus V protein. [55] [56] [57] [58] The poxvirus vaccinia has at least 4 gene products that counteract IFN-\u03b1 and IFN-\u03b2, including a soluble receptor that soaks up the cytokine, a protein that inhibits IFN induction, and 2 gene products that affect the downstream pathway. 59 In addition, vaccinia also have the capability to thwart the effects on IFN-\u03b3 produced by cells, including NK cells, in innate immune responses. 60 Recently, the retrovirus mouse mammary tumor virus was reported to make use of stimulation through TLR molecules to evade the immune system. Mouse mammary tumor virus persistence in certain mouse strains depends on production of the immunosuppressive cytokine IL-10 resulting from TLR4 stimulation, 61 which is reminiscent of the innate immune activation of IL-10 secretion by the Yersinia LcrV to further its infectivity by suppressing host immunity. 31 Therapeutic approaches to activate innate immunity need to overcome viral evasion mechanisms. Questions about the potential effectiveness of the approaches include the following: can viral defenses be overcome if innate defenses, for example, IFN, are induced early in infection or in high amounts? If certain viruses typically induce a certain cytokine and yet have defenses against it, are different cytokines potentially more effective? Could the induction of strong antiviral responses predispose tissues for bacterial infections or autoimmune reactions?",

The molecule suppressor of cytokine signaling 1 is induced by LPS and CpG treatment and acts on the intracellular signaling pathways of TLR4 and TLR9 to negatively regulate their activating functions. 69, 70 The macrophage-and monocyteexpressed molecule IRAK-M prevents the dissociation of signaling kinases from TLRs, thereby effectively blocking TLR signaling. 71 Another protein, tollip, associates directly with TLR2 and TLR4 and inhibits signaling by blocking phosphorylation of other associated signaling molecules. 72, 73 Additionally, an alternate and shortened form of the TLR signaling adaptor molecule MyD88 with inhibitory function arises after continuous innate immune stimulation, resulting in a transcriptionally controlled negative regulation of innate immune responses. 74 These molecules and additional mechanisms control responses to innate receptor activation and also contribute to the temporary tolerance of innate immune responses that appears to result from exposure to potent stimulants. 75 However, as demonstrated by Aderem et al, macrophages exhibit a sustained and continued activation during exposure to TLR agonists, although this is accompanied by a downmodulation of receptors 76 that makes the sustained response different from the initial response. 77 Symbiosis with normal flora might also require the establishment of a form of innate immune tolerance. Continuous innate immune inflammatory stimulation must be avoided to coexist with normal microbial flora in the gastrointestinal tract. This accommodation might reflect at least in part that human intestinal epithelial cells are generally nonresponsive to bacterial ligands that stimulate TLR2. 7 Nevertheless, it is clear that innate immune responses to bacterial components in intestinal tissues are required for normal function, as evidenced by the association of Crohn's disease with a loss of function mutation in the molecule NOD2. 78, 79 The presence of T cells with highly similar \u03b3 \u03b4 receptors situated throughout the lining of the gut might serve a counterinflammatory function to contribute to the establishment and maintenance of normal flora. 80 Any approaches designed to induce heightened innate immunity in the gut or other mucosal tissues will need to take into account the tolerance state involving normal flora and analyze the effect of the proposed strategy. Moreover, innate immune stimulation induced by treatment strategies must remain under the body's regulatory controls to avoid potential runaway responses that could lead to systemic shock. Potentially, along with the development of innate immune stimulants, there should also be measures available to counter innate inflammatory responses. It might be possible to develop potential controllers on the basis of innate immune receptors that are known. For example, inhibitory-suppressive motifs are known for DNA structures that can act dominantly over CpG stimulation, providing a potential antidote if immunostimulation by CpG sequences dangerously overresponded. 81, 82 ",
