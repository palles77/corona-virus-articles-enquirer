Then, it is difficult to understand why a fraction of the normal translocations (25%) occur and another fraction of the \"uncoupled\" translocations (75%) occur. Moreover, as the \"uncoupled\" translocation involves no reverse intersubunit rotation, then how the \"uncoupled\" translocation occurs is unclear.",

Thus, when the 30S P site is occupying GCA 21 codon of the wild-type mRNA used in the experiments of Chen et al. (2014) , the G 34 :C base pair is just outside the mRNA entry site (see Fig. S2b ); and when the 30S P site is occupying AAA 24 codon, three G:C base pairs in the mRNA stem loop are unwound (see Fig. S2c ). Moreover, it is considered that when the 30S P site is occupying GCA 21 codon, the anti-Shine-Dalgarno (anti-SD) of 16S rRNA is in the same position of the Shine-Dalgarno (SD) sequence of the mRNA along the translation direction (see Fig. S2b ). Under this consideration, we study the probability of the effective translocation during translation of each codon on the mRNA.",

During the translation of codon GAU 33 , only three isolated G:C base pairs exist, which can be easily opened by the thermal noise. Thus, the translocation issimilar to that of translation through the single-stranded mRNA, giving the probability of the effective translocation, ). After the translation of codon GAU 33 , no mRNA base pair is present. Thus, during the translation of the remaining codons the probability of Schematic representation of the branchpoint of pathways and mechanism of dnaX -1 frameshifting proposed by Chen et al. (2014). The figure is redrawn from Chen et al. (2014). The first branchpoint during frameshifting is probably due to the stochastic interaction of the ribosome with the hairpin in an open or closed state, and/or formation of the Shine-Dalgarno and anti-Shine-Dalgarno pairing, that represent the shunt to either pausing or normal translation. If the hairpin is in open state, the translocation of the ribosomes with normal translation is coupled with the reverse intersubunit rotation, leading to +3 translocation. If the hairpin is in closed state, the translocation of the paused ribosomes is uncoupled with the reverse intersubunit rotation (called \"uncoupled\" translocation), leading also to +3 translocation and creating a non-canonical intermediate in translation (denoted Rotated*). The \"uncoupled\" translocation exposes the A site, to which tRNA Lys and EF-G sample. tRNA Lys sampling and accommodation to the AAG codon and EF-G action stimulates the ribosome to slip into the -1 frame. Finally, EF-G catalyses the final reverse intersubunit rotation, after which the ribosome resumes normal translation.",
