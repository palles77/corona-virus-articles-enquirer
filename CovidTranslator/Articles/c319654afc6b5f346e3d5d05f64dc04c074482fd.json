            "text": "Objectives: Conducting manual surveillance of non-ventilator-associated hospital-acquired pneumonia (nvHAP) using ECDC (European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control) surveillance criteria is very resource intensive. We developed and validated a semi-automated surveillance system for nvHAP, and describe nvHAP incidence and aetiology at our hospital. Methods: We applied an automated classification algorithm mirroring ECDC definition criteria to distinguish patients 'not at risk' from patients 'at risk' for suffering from nvHAP. 'At risk'-patients were manually screened for nvHAP. For validation, we applied the reference standard of full manual evaluation to three validation samples comprising 2091 patients. Results: Among the 39 519 University Hospital Zurich inpatient discharges in 2017, the algorithm identified 2454 'at-risk' patients, reducing the number of medical records to be manually screened by 93.8%. From this subset, nvHAP was identified in 251 patients (0.64%, 95%CI: 0.57e0.73). Sensitivity, negative predictive value, and accuracy of semi-automated surveillance versus full manual surveillance were lowest in the validation sample consisting of patients with HAP according to the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-10) discharge diagnostic codes, with 97.5% (CI: 93.7e99.3%), 99.2% (CI: 97.9 e99.8%), and 99.4% (CI: 98.4e99.8%), respectively. The overall incidence rate of nvHAP was 0.83/1000 patient days (95%CI: 0.73e0.94), with highest rates in haematology/oncology, cardiac and thoracic surgery, and internal medicine including subspecialties. Conclusions: The semi-automated surveillance demonstrated a very high sensitivity, negative predictive value, and accuracy. This approach significantly reduces manual surveillance workload, thus making continuous nvHAP surveillance feasible as a pivotal element for successful prevention efforts.",

HAP and lower respiratory tract infections were shown to be the most common hospital-acquired infections (HAIs), constituting a proportion of 26% [1, 2] . Almost two thirds of HAPs are nvHAPs [1, 2] . Although nvHAP is more frequent, and has been shown to be comparable in mortality and costs to VAP [3] , current research, prevention guidelines, and prevention efforts focus almost exclusively on VAP. In 2017, Ewan et al. called nvHAP a 'neglected disease' among HAIs [4] . As a fundamental first step to preventing nvHAP, they argued for obtaining accurate estimates of prevalence and incidence through prospective surveillance [4] .",

Pneumonia is defined as hospital-acquired when symptoms start 48 h after admission. If an invasive respiratory device was present in the 48 h preceding symptom onset, the pneumonia is considered a VAP. For this study, we categorized aetiology in three groups according to microbiological sampling site: first, sputum, tracheal aspirate, or upper respiratory tract specimen; second, bronchoalveolar lavage, endobronchial aspirate, or tissue sample; and third, blood culture or antigen detection in blood or urine. We defined 'good-quality sputum and tracheal aspirate' as sputum or tracheal aspirate with <10 squamous epithelial cells (SECs) per low power field (LPF) in microscopic examination [13] . 'Possible fungal pneumonia' was defined when host factors and clinical criteria were met [14] . 'Place of acquisition' was determined as affiliation to department and ward 48 h before the first symptoms of nvHAP, unless a shorter incubation period was evident from patient history.",

We applied an automated classification algorithm ( Fig. 1) [5] to distinguish patients 'not at risk' from those 'at risk' for nvHAP. Based on the ECDC case definition, patients were defined as 'at risk' if they had undergone at least one radiological procedure (x-ray or CT scan) of the chest fulfilling the following criteria: (a) radiological procedure performed 48 h after admission or at any time during hospitalization for patients readmitted within 28 days; (b) systemic symptoms in temporal relationship to radiological procedure; (c) pneumonia not a-priori excluded in the radiologists' report; (d) no invasive respiratory device constantly present during 48 h preceding radiological procedure. As microbiological criteria are not required for the ECDC nvHAP definition, we refrained from including microbiological criteria in the classification algorithm. The 'at-risk' patients were then manually screened for nvHAP, strictly applying the ECDC case definition [12] . Manual surveillance was performed by two skilled nurses of the IPC team (AM, MF) and double-checked by an experienced infectious disease physician (AW). Investigators manually collected data comprising 'possible fungal pneumonia', date of onset, and 'place of acquisition'.",

Case finding often relies on diagnostic codes, antimicrobial prescription, and/or microbiology. Sensitivity of these algorithms varied from 26% to 95% [5] . For nvHAP, we were not able to identify a study validating a (semi-)automated surveillance system. Instead, two investigations assessed discharge diagnostic codes to substitute conventional nvHAP surveillance with an overall poor sensitivity of 42% and 59% [11, 20] , which declassifies this approach for epidemiological surveillance purposes. By challenging our algorithm by full manual evaluation of the patient population diagnosed and coded to have HAP, we identified four additional patients with nvHAP. Knowing that the sensitivity of ICD-10 coded HAP for HAP according to ECDC definition in our hospital is around 60% [11] , we anticipate having potentially missed another three patients maximumda small number compared to the 251 patients identified by our semi-automated surveillance system. By closely mirroring the ECDC surveillance criteria in our classification algorithm, the sensitivity of our semi-automated surveillance system is close to 100%, higher than the sensitivity of (semi-)automated surveillance systems for various HAIs summarized in the 2013 review by Van Mourik et al.

First, due to limited resources, we were unable to apply our reference standard of manual surveillance to the whole patient population. We aimed to address this limitation by conducting full manual surveillance on three different validation populations, including a validation sample comprising all patients with HAP according to ICD-10 coding data. Second, even careful manual case evaluation is associated with an inherent risk for interrater variability. We addressed this issue by double-checking all borderline cases and all cases with nvHAP by a second observer. Third, both semi-automated and full manual surveillance rely on radiological procedures demonstrating a pneumonic infiltrate. Patients without x-ray (e.g. due to restrictively performed diagnostic procedures) are missed by both surveillance systems, and so are patients who were transferred to another hospital or discharged home. Fourth, due to our selected algorithm criteria, patients with delayed radiological procedure and patients whose pneumonia was diagnosed in a radiological procedure of the abdomen or in a PET scan can be omitted, as shown by our rootcause analysis. Lastly, our surveillance system may require modification before it is apt for implementation in hospitals with differing characteristics of EMRs and data warehouses. Adaptations would also be needed when CDC instead of ECDC nvHAP definitions are to be used, as CDC definitions include special diagnostic criteria for immunocompromised and elderly patients.",

Further, we identified medical specialties with high nvHAP rates, allowing targeting of prevention efforts to the departments concerned. The resulting dataset identified the aetiological spectrum of nvHAP, revealing a surprisingly high percentage of viral infections, which should be considered in future prevention strategies. The continuous application of this semiautomated surveillance system will allow monitoring of the effectiveness of our ongoing nvHAP prevention bundle.",

This made the establishment of a state-of-the-art semi-automated continuous surveillance of nvHAP feasible, facilitating timely feedback of infection rates, identifying departments with high nvHAP rates, and monitoring the effectiveness of nvHAP prevention measures. This surveillance system constitutes a breakthrough and central building block of nvHAP prevention, a previously neglected HAI. Implementation and validation of this semi-automated surveillance system (or adaptations of it) in other hospitals would be of special interest to investigate its overall validity and generalizability.",
