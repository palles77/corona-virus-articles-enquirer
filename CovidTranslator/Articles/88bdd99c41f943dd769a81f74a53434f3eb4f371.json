Using global linelist data on COVID-19 cases reported until 29 th February 2020 and global gridded temperature data, and after adjusting for surveillance capacity and time since first imported case, higher average temperature was strongly associated with lower COVID-19 incidence for temperatures of 1\u00b0C and higher. However, temperature explained a relatively modest amount of the total variation in COVID-19 incidence. These preliminary findings support stringent containment efforts in Europe and elsewhere.",

The number of cases reported in countries in tropical regions, most of which are low-and middle-income countries (LMICs) with weaker detection and response capacity [3] , is lower [2] . There has been much speculation about whether warming temperatures with the onset of spring and summer will contribute to decreased transmission in the northern hemisphere, as is observed for many viral respiratory infections [4] . This would also have implications for the risk of spread in temperate regions in the southern hemisphere at the onset of winter, and for tropical regions where the vast majority of LMICs are located. Higher temperatures were shown to have a protective effect against transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2002-2003 [5] , possibly due to the decreased survival of the SARS-CoV on surfaces at higher temperatures [6] . Decreased aerosol spread at higher temperatures is another possible mechanism, as observed for human influenza viruses [7] . This study aimed to provide preliminary data on whether there may be seasonal variation in COVID-19 incidence, in sub-national regions that have reported at least one confirmed COVID-19 case.",

We modelled the cumulative number of COVID-19 cases classified as local cases in each ADM1 during the observation period. The statistical model was based on the generalized linear regression framework [12] . We used a negative binomial distribution to account for the overdispersion of the number of local cases during the observation period. The primary exposure was the average temperature at the ADM1 centroid during the observation period. Temperature was included in the model both as a linear and a quadratic term to account for the non-linearity of the association observed during initial data exploration.",

The number of presumed locally-transmitted cases ranged from 0 to 1,220 in provinces in China (excluding Hubei), and 0 to 552 in ADM1 outside China (Table 1) . Average temperatures at ADM1 centroids in China (excluding Hubei) ranged from -16.8\u00b0C to 20.4\u00b0C, and from -18.7\u00b0C to 31.9\u00b0C outside China (Table 1) . Average temperature (as a linear and quadratic term combination) was strongly associated with count of local COVID-19 cases (likelihood ratio test = 19.4, df = 2, p=0.00006). Although one observation (Daegu province in South Korea) was identified as an outlier and had high leverage, the model results did not change when this observation was removed from the dataset. The model results indicate that there was a negative correlation in the predicted number of cases with temperature from 1\u00b0C and above ( Figure  2 ). For example, at mean values for the other variables, an increase in average temperature from 1\u00b0C to 9\u00b0C was associated with a decrease in predicted cases at ADM1 level from 24 cases to 19 cases, respectively. Similarly, an increase in average temperature from 10\u00b0C to 19\u00b0C was associated with a decrease from 18 to 7 predicted cases at ADM1 level, respectively. The pseudo R-squared values for the final model with and without temperature were 0.44 and 0.39, respectively, indicating that the inclusion of the temperature effect only provided a relatively modest improvement in model fit. There are several important limitations to this study. These results remain preliminary, as they only include confirmed cases as of February 29 th 2020, at which point reported local transmission outside China was relatively limited. There was no data available on many characteristics that affect rate of spread within a region, especially the interventions initiated in response to the detection of imported or locally transmitted cases. Furthermore, the model could not be fitted with a random intercept for country to account for clustering of ADM1 units within countries, as the uneven distribution of the number of affected provinces by country led to model instability. However, the early detection score likely captures part of the country-level variance. Is it also important to note that the classification of cases as local or imported was based on available information, and in some ADM1 (in particular in China, South Korea and Italy) the first imported case could not be identified. These results need to be confirmed by repeating the analysis as the pandemic progresses, and including data on implemented interventions to contain or mitigate COVID-19 as it becomes available.",
