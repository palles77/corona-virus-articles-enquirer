A yeast two-hybrid screen identified the SUMO-conjugating enzyme UBC9 as a protein interacting with RAP80. The interaction of RAP80 with UBC9 was confirmed by co-immunoprecipitation and GST pull-down analyses. The region between a.a. 122-204 was critical for the interaction of RAP80 with UBC9. In addition, we demonstrate that RAP80 is a target for SUMO-1 modification in intact cells. Expression of UBC9 enhanced RAP80 mono-sumoylation and also induced multisumoylation of RAP80. In addition to SUMO-1, RAP80 was efficiently conjugated to SUMO-3 but was only a weak substrate for SUMO-2 conjugation. These findings suggest that sumoylation plays a role in the regulation of RAP80 functions.",

Polyubiquitination plays a key role in guiding the proteolytic degradation of proteins by the ubiquitin-proteasome system while monoubiquitination has been implicated in several processes, including the regulation of endocytosis, DNA-repair, and transcription [1; 2;7] .",

SUMO-1 shows ~50% amino acid sequence identity to SUMO-2 and SUMO-3 while SUMO-2 and SUMO-3 exhibit ~95% amino acid sequence identity to each other. The pathway of sumoylation is analogous to that of ubiquitination, but involves a different set of enzymes. SUMO is activated by an E1-activating enzyme consisting of an AOS1/UBA2 heterodimer, transferred to the E2-conjugating enzyme, UBC9, and is subsequently (with the aid of various E3 ligases) attached to the \u03b5-amino group of specific lysines in target proteins [2] [3] [4] [5] . Sumoylation can be reversed by SUMO-cleaving enzymes. In some cases, UBC9 can catalyze sumoylation without the help of E3 ligases, but its efficiency and specificity is increased by E3 ligases. Sumoylation is emerging as a critical modifier of the conformation and activity of many, mostly nuclear, proteins with functions in many cellular processes, including transcriptional regulation, DNA damage repair, histone modification, and apoptosis [6;8-11] .",

Recently, we demonstrated these UIMs are able to bind (poly)ubiquitin [12] . In addition, we reported that RAP80 can interact with the estrogen receptor \u03b1 (ER\u03b1) in an agonist-dependent manner and regulate its transcriptional activity. Moreover, RAP80 interacts with the tumor suppressor BRCA1 and is essential for the translocation of BRCA1 to DNA damage foci after irradiation [14] [15] [16] [17] .

            "text": "Our study also demonstrates that RAP80 is a novel target of sumoylation. RAP80 was effectively conjugated to SUMO-1 and SUMO-3 and to a much lesser extent to SUMO-2. This is in agreement with other studies showing that proteins can exhibit different specificities for SUMO-1-3 conjugation [21] . Based on the size of the sumoylated RAP80, it was concluded that RAP80 is mostly monosumoylated. Deletion analysis indicated that the amino-terminus (aa 1-122) of RAP80 can be modified by sumoylation. Although many proteins are sumoylated at the \u03a8KXD/E consensus sequence, several studies have reported that proteins can be sumoylated at sites that do not conform to the \u03a8KXD/E consensus sequence. For example, PML and Smad4 are sumoylated at lysines in AKCP and VKYC, respectively, while Mdm2 and CREB are sumoylated and do not contain a \u03a8KXD/E sequence [4;22;23] . How these sites are recognized has not yet been established. Although the amino-terminus contains 17 lysine residues none of them are part of a high-probability \u03a8KXD/E sumoylation motif. Five lowprobability motifs were identified; however, mutation of all five sites did not have any effect on the sumoylation of RAP80 suggesting that another lysine can be a target for sumoylation. Sumoylation of many proteins involves binding of UBC9 to the consensus \u03a8KXD/E sumoylation motif; however, in the case of other proteins, including the transcription factor AP2, the co-repressor N-COR, and Sovar, UBC9 interacts with a region distant to the sumoylation site [24] [25] [26] . The amino-terminus is sumoylated but does not bind UBC9. Possibly, this sumoylation does not require a direct interaction between RAP80 and UBC9, and sumoylation is mediated by E3 ligases. Deletion analysis showed that the region of RAP80 between Arg 122 and Ser 204 is important for the interaction of RAP80 with UBC9; however, this region does not contain a high probability \u03a8KXD/E sumoylation motif. The binding of UBC9 to this region may involve different interaction motif and be implicated in a different activity of RAP80. Since RAP80 is part of a larger protein complex, it may recruit UBC9 to the complex thereby promoting the sumoylation of other proteins in the complex.",

            "text": "Sumoylation has been reported to be a critical modifier of the conformation and activity of many, mostly nuclear, proteins with functions in a variety of cellular processes [3;6;8-11] . For example, sumoylation plays an important role in the regulation of the NF-\u03baB signaling pathway. After sumoylation NEMO, the regulatory subunit of I\u03baB kinase, is translocated from the cytoplasm to the nucleus [27] . I\u03baB\u03b1 sumoylation targets the same lysines as ubiquitination thereby stabilizing the protein by preventing its ubiquitination and destruction by the proteasome [28] . Recently, we reported that RAP80 interacts with the tumor suppressor BRCA1 and translocates with BRCA1 to DNA damage foci after irradiation suggesting a role for RAP80 in DNA-damage repair signaling [17] . The UIMs play a critical role in the transfer of RAP80 to DNA damage foci, and as a consequence also in the transfer of BRCA1. Interestingly, ubiquitination and sumoylation have multiple functions in DNA damage repair signaling [6;8;9 ] and a number of proteins involved in DNA repair are subject to sumoylation. For example, Lys 164 in proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) is a target for ubiquitination as well as sumoylation [29] . By competing with ubiquitin for attachment to this lysine SUMO can block ubiquitination and inhibit damage-induced DNA repair. Rad51 and Rad52, which play a key role in homologous recombination, interact with UBC9 and are targets of sumoylation [30;31] . The DNA repair factor XPC becomes sumoylated after irradiation [32] . Sumoylation of DNA repair proteins can regulate their stability, protein-protein interactions, localization, and activity. Sumoylation did not affect the stability of RAP80 or its nuclear localization (Yan, J., unpublished observations). We hypothesize that this post-translational modification plays an important role in regulating the activity of RAP80 and its function in DNA damage response and possibly ER\u03b1 signaling.",

C. HEK293T cells were transfected with pLXIN-3\u00d7FLAG-RAP80, pCMV-HA-SUMO-1, or pCMV-HA-Ub as indicated. Forty-eight hours later cells were irradiated (10 Gy) and collected after 3 hours incubation. Cells extracts were immunoprecipitated with anti-HA antibody. Proteins were then examined by Western blot analysis with an anti-FLAG antibody. RAP80 is sumoylated at its amino-terminus. A. HEK293T cells were transfected with pCMV-HA-SUMO-1 and a series of carboxyl-terminal deletion mutants of pLXIN-3\u00d7FLAG-RAP80. Forty-eight hours later sumoylated proteins were immunoprecipitated with an anti-HA antibody and examined by Western blot analysis with an anti-FLAG antibody. (*) indicates the migration of the sumoylated mutant RAP80 proteins. B. Effect of several mutations on RAP80 sumoylation. The amino acid sequence of the N-terminal region of RAP80 (a.a. 1-122) is shown; potential sumoylation sites are underlined. HEK293T cells were transfected with pCMV-HA-SUMO-1, wild type pLXIN-3\u00d7FLAG-RAP80 or its K52A mutant. The cells were collected 48 h later and processed as described under A. C.
