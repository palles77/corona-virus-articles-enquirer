As described in this Review, recent genomic and subgenomic analyses have begun to assign functional properties to novel IFN-inducible effector proteins that restrict bacteria, protozoa and viruses in different subcellular compartments and at different stages of the pathogen life cycle. Several newly described host defence factors also participate in canonical oxidative and autophagic pathways by spatially coordinating their activities to enhance microbial killing. Together, these IFN-induced effector networks help to confer vertebrate host resistance to a vast and complex microbial world.",

Phosphorylated STAT1 homodimers (also known as GAF) translocate to the nucleus to bind to IFN\u03b3-activated site (GAS) promoter elements to promote the IFN-induced expression of antimicrobial effector genes, some of which also require transactivation by IFN-regulatory factor 1 (IRF1) and IRF8.

These gases -collectively termed reactive oxygen species (ROS) and reactive nitrogen species (RNS) -are generated by oxido reductases to confer microbicidal activity and regulate intracellular signalling 7, 26, 28, 30 . The targets of ROS and RNS include bacterial DNA (which is damaged via guanine base oxidation), lipids (which are damaged via peroxidation), and haem groups or ironsulphur clusters within bacterial enzymes 7, 26 7,9 . Given the toxicity of these molecules, it is not surprising that the production of ROS and RNS is tightly controlled and often compartmentalized to limit self-injury. This has the added benefit of maximizing microbicidal activity when production is localized to phagosomes and phagolysosomes that contain bacteria 9 . In mammals, three classes of cytokineinducible oxidoreductases control ROS and RNS production. NADPH oxidases (NOXs) directly catalyse the production of O 2 -, whereas dual oxidases (DUOXs) produce H 2 O 2 (TABLE 1; Supplementary information S1 (figure)). In addition, nitric oxide synthases (NOSs) synthesize NO, and the immunologically inducible isoform NOS2 (also known as iNOS) synthesizes large amounts of NO under infectious conditions. All three classes of oxidoreductases may act simultaneously, sometimes even within the same host cell, depending on the physiological setting and the activating stimuli 7,28 . Non-enzymatic sources of ROS and RNS can also contribute to host defence. For example, O 2 can originate from mitochondrial leakage and NO can be generated by the action of gastric acid on NO 2 that is produced from dietary nitrates (NO 3 -) by the oral microbiota 7, 28, 31, 32 .",

The cytosolic subunits have SH3 domains that mediate intersubunit contacts and PX domains for binding membrane lipids once they translocate to the gp91phox-p22phox complexes at the plasma membrane or on plasma membranederived phagosomes 28 (TABLE 1; Supplementary information S1 (figure)). The assembly and activation of NOX2 holoenzymes also requires several GTPases. RAC1 and RAC2 facilitate this process under basal conditions 28 , whereas the recently described GTPase guanylate-binding protein 7 (GBP7) operates after IFN\u03b3 stimulation 16 . IFN\u03b3-induced GBP7 specifically recruits cytosolic p67phox-p47phox heterodimers to gp91phox-p22phox complexes on bacterial phagosomes containing Listeria monocytogenes or Mycobacterium bovis bacillus Calmette-Gu\u00e9rin (BCG) 16 (FIG. 2) . The proximity of phagosomal NOX2 to intraluminal bacteria may heighten IFN-induced killing, as subsequent fusion with lysosomes favours dismutation of O 2 to the more-damaging oxidant H 2 O 2 (REF. 9 ). In addition to GBP7, the IFN\u03b3-activated GTPase leucinerich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) has recently been reported to promote NOX2 activity against S. Typhimurium 34 . How LRRK2 exerts its effects and whether it works in tandem with GBP7 on phagosomal membranes is currently unknown.",

To date, most work has focused on NOS2 activities in mouse macrophages, as human 39, 41 . Such differences reflect the metabolic pathways and microbial DNA repair processes targeted by ROS and RNS, as well as the detoxifying systems expressed by the bacteria 7 (see TABLE 2) . They may also reflect compartmentalization; for example, L. monocytogenes becomes sensitive to NO when trapped inside phagosomes, owing to synergism with other bactericidal insults or the heightened RNS concentrations that accumulate in a confined volume 44 . Therefore, phagosomal escape of L. monocytogenes before NOS2 recruitment could provide a survival benefit for the pathogen.

IRGs promote cell-autonomous immunity to vacuolar bacteria as diverse as M. tuberculosis, M. bovis, S. Typhimurium, Chlamydia trachomatis, Chlamydia psittaci, Legionella pneumophila and Crohn's disease-associated adherent invasive Escherichia coli (AIEC) 22, 23, [51] [52] [53] [54] [55] [56] [57] [58] [59] [60] [61] . Individual IRGs confer pathogenspecific immunity in vitro and in vivo, indicating that they have non-redundant functions during host defence (TABLE 2) . Such specificity probably arises from the hostderived interacting partners and trafficking pathways used by a given IRG and the type of intracellular niche occupied by a given bacterial species 18, 19, 51 .",

Typhimurium, AIEC or early L. monocytogenes phagosomes as part of the IFN\u03b3 -induced response to these bacteria [21] [22] [23] 51, 54, 57, 59, 60 . The translocation of IRGM1 to mycobacterial phagosomes involves the recognition of specific host phosphoinositide lipids (namely, phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-trisphosphate and, to a lesser extent, phosphatidylinositol-3,4-bisphosphate) on the nascent phagocytic cup 21 (FIG. 2) . Once recruited, IRGM1 interacts with and may regulate the assembly activity or phosphorylation status of snapin, a SNARE adaptor protein that recruits dynein motor complexes to traffic phagosomes and endosomes along microtubules towards Nature Reviews | Immunology 21, 64 . Likewise, different human IRGM splice isoforms bind to the core autophagy proteins ATG5 and LC3B as well as the inner mitochondrial membrane lipid cardiolipin to induce mitochondrial fission and autophagy 59, 65 ; these functions of IRGM may underlie its protective response to mycobacterial, Salmonella spp. and AIEC infections 23, 54, 59, 60, 65, 66 . Thus, a single GMS-containing IRG can act as a hub for coordinating membranolytic, fusogenic and fission events in an individual cell. This accounts in part for why deficiencies in GMS-containing IRGs cause such pronounced infectious phenotypes compared with those of GKS-containing IRGs 18, 20, 52, [56] [57] [58] (TABLE 2) . It may also explain why human IRGM polymorphisms share genetic linkages with susceptibility to tuberculosis and Crohn's disease across so many geographically diverse populations [66] [67] [68] [69] . 19, 52, 53 , and GBP7 (and possibly leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2)) help to assemble NADPH oxidase 2 (NOX2) on bacterial phagosomes, which mediates bacterial killing. Using this pathway, these GTPases can also deliver antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) to the autophagolysosome and, in the case of human IRGM, may instigate mitochondrial fission before autophagy 59 . Other IFN-inducible components, such as natural resistance-associated macrophage protein 1 (NRAMP1), help to exclude Mn 2+ and Fe 2+ from the bacterial phagosome, while importing protons (H + ) into this compartment. Nitric oxide synthase 2 (NOS2), which synthesizes NO, works in concert with NOX2, which produces reactive oxygen species such as superoxide (O 2 -) and hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2 ), to produce compound intermediates like peroxynitrite (not shown) that are highly bactericidal. b | An emerging signature for the recognition of some escaped bacteria in the cytosol is ubiquitylation (either single or multiple modifications with monoubiquitin and/or polyubiquitin chains) (see REF. 47 ). SQSTM1, NDP52 and optineurin bind to ubiquitylated bacteria to initiate innate immune signalling and to recruit the autophagic machinery via LC3 family members. In addition, GBP1 and GBP2 polymerize around cytosolic bacteria in a ubiquitin-independent process that may recruit specific antimicrobial partners, while galectin 3 and galectin 8 bind to exposed glycans on the bacteria and, in the case of galectin 8, recruit NDP52 and downstream autophagic effectors 25 . SQSTM1 also activates a second antibacterial pathway involving diacylglycerol (DAG) and protein kinase C\u03b4 (PKC\u03b4) to induce NOX2 complex assembly.

GBP1 interacts with the ubiquitinbinding protein SQSTM1, which delivers ubiquitylated protein cargo to autolysosomes, resulting in the generation of antimicrobial peptides that kill engulfed M. bovis and L. monocytogenes 16, 77, 78 . GBP7 recruits the autophagy protein ATG4B, which drives the extension of autophagic membranes around bacteria within damaged bacterial compartments and assembles NOX2 on these compartments 16 (FIG. 2) . GBP5, by contrast, binds NLRP3 (NOD-, LRR-and pyrin domain-containing 3) to promote specific inflammasome responses during the infection of IFN\u03b3activated macrophages by Listeria or Salmonella spp., whereas in non-phagocytic cells heterotypic inter actions between GBPs may help to target cytosolic escaped bacteria to autolysosomes (A. R. Shenoy, C. J. Bradfield and J.D.M., unpublished observations). Thus, GBPs act in concert -both temporally and physically -to confer their antibacterial effects. Moreover, they integrate oxidative, lysosomal and possibly inflammasome-related killing as part of their host defence activities.",

NRAMP1 prevents ion sequestration specifically by phagosomal pathogens and competes with bacterial ion transporters for access to these nutritional metals 83 (FIG. 2) . For example, the growth of S. Typhimurium mutants that lack mntH (which encodes an NRAMP1 homologue with a high affinity for Mn 2+ and Fe 2+ ) or sitABCD (which encodes a second Mn 2+ -binding transport system) is attenuated in IFN\u03b3activated macrophages from mice that express the wildtype NRAMP1 efflux pump, but not in macrophages from congenic mice with a non-functional NRAMP1 efflux pump (derived from a defective Nramp1 G169D allele) 88 IFN\u03b3 stimulation also regulates other cation transport mechanisms, for example by inducing the relocation of the P-type ATPase Cu + pump ATP7A to the phagosome, where it can transport Cu + across the membrane to promote the generation of intraluminal hydroxyl radicals 85 . This again leads to intra phagosomal killing of bacteria.

Low lysosomal pH, in turn, accelerates the dismutation of O 2 to the more powerful oxidant H 2 O 2 , converts NO 2 back to the toxic radical NO and drives hydroxyl radical formation with the aid of imported Cu + .

            "text": "Previous studies have highlighted the role of NOS2-mediated killing in cellautonomous defence against a variety of protozoa (reviewed in REF. 7 ). The parasiticidal effects of NO are most evident in IFN\u03b3-activated macrophages infected with Leishmania major amastigotes or T. cruzi trypomastigotes and in human and mouse hepatocytes infected with Plasmodium falciparum and Plasmodium yoelli sporozoites, respectively [91] [92] [93] (FIG. 3) . Furthermore, Nos2 -/mice were highly susceptible to these pathogens [91] [92] [93] (TABLE 2 ). In the case of less virulent type II T. gondii tachyzoites, IFN-inducible NOS2 plays a more limited part, functioning at later time points 94 after the IFN-inducible GTPases have contained parasite growth during the early stages of infection 95 . For virulent type I T. gondii strains, however, NOS2 is essential, because these parasites have evolved mechanisms to escape IRGmediated inhibition in IFN\u03b3-activated macrophages 96 . Here, NO does not appear to eliminate virulent T. gondii but instead imposes static, non-lethal control 96 . How NO inhibits Toxoplasma parasites, along with malaria, Leishmania and Trypanosoma parasites, remains incompletely understood, but haem-containing compounds (such as haemozoin) and protozoal cysteine proteases appear to be likely targets for S-nitrosylation, which can inactivate these enzymes 7 . Nitric oxide synthase 2 (NOS2) exerts potent parasiticidal activity, while GKS-containing immunity-related GTPases (IRGs) appear to be directly involved in parasite vacuole disruption once they reach the parisitophorous compartment. This proceeds via autophagy-independent trafficking after release from IRGM1-IRGM3 or ATG5 and is mediated by cooperative IRG loading 62, 63, 103 . Guanylate-binding proteins (GBPs) -specifically GBP1-GBP2 and GBP1-GBP5 complexes -also traffic to the parasitophorous vacuole, with uncharacterized effects on parasite control 76 . Natural resistance-associated macrophage protein 1 (NRAMP1) is important for restricting the uptake of Mn 2+ and Fe 2+ by this compartment, whereas indoleamine 2,3 -dioxygenase 1 (IDO1) and/or IDO2 limit amino acid acquisition via the depletion of l-tryptophan. Dashed lines indicate possible routes or consequences. Targeting the parasitophorous vacuole. As in the case of bacteria, IFN-inducible IRGs and GBPs defend the interior of the host cell against protozoa. IRGM1, IRGM3 and IRGA6 promote IFN\u03b3-induced control (but not TNF-or CD40-dependent control) of avirulent T. gondii in macrophages and astrocytes [96] [97] [98] [99] [100] [101] . IRGM1 also contributes to macrophage trypanocidal activity 102 (TABLE 2) . Inhibition of avirulent T. gondii appears to rely on several IRGs, with IRGM proteins providing a regulatory function by acting as GDIs that release GKScontaining IRGs to target the parasitophorous vacuole (FIG. 3) . Recent studies invoke a hierarchical model in which IRGB6 and possibly IRGB10 act as forerunners to IRGA6 and then IRGD during their loading onto the parasitophorous vacuole some 90 minutes after parasite entry. The recruitment of these molecules is followed by vesiculation, membrane disruption and sometimes necroptosis 62, 63 . What remains unknown are the structural and biochemical cues for targeting these molecules to the parasitophorous vacuole and whether membrane deformation is directly due to IRG activity or a result of some intermediary protein. These are topics of future investigation.",

Because virulent T. gondii strains (but not avirulent strains) exclude IRGs and GBPs from the parasitophorous vacuole 76, 104, 105 , it is likely that these IFN-inducible GTPases exert a strong selective pressure via their membrane regulatory activities.

IDO1 and IDO2 are both IFN-inducible, haem-containing oxidoreductases that are responsible for the initial ratelimiting step of the kynurenine pathway, in which they degrade l-tryptophan to generate N-formylkynurenine (FIG. 3; TABLE 1 ). Removal of l-tryptophan restricts the growth of Leishmania spp. and T. gondii (as well as that of C. psittaci, Francisella spp., Rickettsia spp., herpes simplex virus 1 and hepatitis B virus) in IFN\u03b3-activated macrophages, dendritic cells, fibroblasts, epithelial cells, astrocytes, endothelial cells and mesenchymal stem cells [107] [108] [109] [110] [111] . IDOs also inhibit T. cruzi via the downstream l-kynurenine catabolites 3-hydroxykynurenine and 3-hydroxyanthranilic acid, which are likely to be toxic for T. cruzi amastigotes and trypomastigotes 112 . Furthermore, in vivo blockade of IDOs using 1-methyltryptophan results in profound host susceptibility to T. gondii 113 . This host-protective role of IDOs against T. gondii, Leishmania spp. and Chlamydia spp. in humans is often superseded by the NOS2 pathway in other species (such as mice and rats), in which NOS2 may represent a more robust front-line defence mechanism 7,108,111 .",

TRIM5\u03b1 can restrict HIV-1 entry by binding to the retroviral capsid to accelerate its cytoplasmic uncoating and, as demonstrated more recently, by activating innate immune signalling through associations with the E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme complex UBC13-UEV1A (also known as UBE2N-UBE2V1), which activates TGF\u03b2activated kinase 1 (TAK1) to induce immune genes 122, 123 . Which of these two mechanisms predominates is as yet unresolved. In addition, TRIM22 combats hepatitis B virus and encephalomyocarditis virus by interfering with pre-genomic RNA synthesis and protease activity, whereas IFN\u03b2-inducible TRIM79\u03b1 restricts tick-borne encephalitis virus by mediating the lysosomal degradation of the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase NS5 .

Human and mouse MX1, as well as mouse MX2, exhibit antiviral activity 128, 129 . Mouse MX1 localizes to promyelocytic leukaemia (PML) nuclear bodies and restricts nuclear viruses, whereas both human MX1 and mouse MX2 are cytosolic proteins that target cytoplasmic viruses 128 .

This fits with its expression in human endothelial cells, hepatocytes, plasma cytoid dendritic cells, peripheral blood mononuclear cells and other myeloid cells. Current mechanistic models propose that GTPasedriven MX protein oligomers form ring-like structures to trap viral nucleocapsids and associated polymerases 128, 130 .

The landmark discoveries of IFN-induced, RNA-activated protein kinase (PKR) and 2\u0374-5\u0374 oligoadenylate synthase 1 (OAS1), OAS2 and OAS3 (and OASL in humans) provided early insights regarding how viral RNA substrates are targeted (reviewed in REF. 8 ). PKR possesses RNA-binding motifs at its N-terminus that engage both double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) and single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) (TABLE 3) ; the viral uncapped RNAs that are recognized by PKR often have limited duplexed regions and 5\u0374 triphosphate moieties, which enable the enzyme to distinguish them from host, capped RNA species 8 . Once activated, PKR phosphorylates eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2\u03b1 (EIF2\u03b1) to block viral and host protein translation, a process that is thought to be under intense positive selection to avoid the emergence of viral mimics of the substrate EIF2\u03b1 133 . Likewise, the recognition of dsRNA by OAS enzymes results in the production of 2\u0374-5\u0374 oligoadenylates, which when polymerized activate the latent endoribonuclease RNase L to degrade viral RNA transcripts. Lastly, the exonuclease ISG20 (IFN-stimulated gene 20 kDa protein) degrades RNA transcripts belonging to VSV, influenza virus and encephalomyocarditis virus 8 .",

APOBEC3 (apolipoprotein B mRNA-editing enzyme, catalytic polypeptide 3) and ADAR1 (adenosine deaminase, RNA-specific 1) are site-specific cytidine and adenosine deaminases, respectively. APOBEC3 converts cytidine to uridine in dsRNA, whereas ADAR1 catalyses the deamination of adenosine to inosine 8, 134 . These incorporations lead to RNA destabilization and hypermutation after reverse transcription to cause lethal genome mutations in retroviruses such as HIV-1 (REF. 135 ). Different APOBEC isoforms (APOBEC3F and APOBEC3G) exhibit distinct mechanisms involving the processing of long terminal repeats, and they may also interact with RNA and/or the Gag protein from HIV-1 to prevent the packaging of these molecules into viral particles 8, 135 (FIG. 4) . For example, interferon-inducible transmembrane proteins (IFITMs) and tripartite motif proteins (TRIMs) act during viral entry and uncoating, and myxoma resistance proteins (MXs) block nucleocapsid transport. Inhibition of RNA reverse transcription, protein translation and stability is mediated by APOBEC3 (apolipoprotein B mRNA-editing enzyme, catalytic polypeptide 3), SAMHD1 (SAM-domain-and HD-domain-containing protein 1), ADAR1 (adenosine deaminase, RNA-specific 1), NOS2 (nitric oxide synthase 2), OASs (2\u0374-5\u0374 oligoadenylate synthases), RNase L, ISG20 (IFN-stimulated gene 20 kDa protein), PKR (IFN-induced, RNA-activated protein kinase) and ISG15. Finally, viperin and tetherin help to prevent viral assembly and release, respectively. Some of the effectors (such as MX proteins) appear to operate in both the nucleus and the cytosol (not shown).",

Such candidates would expand the reach of IFNs beyond toxic gases, lytic peptides, ion transporters, DNases and RNases as the main cell-intrinsic means by which to bring infection under control. They may also reinforce the idea that synergy between IFN-induced genes is more than the sum of their individual parts, one of the founding doctrines of systems biology [154] [155] [156] .",
