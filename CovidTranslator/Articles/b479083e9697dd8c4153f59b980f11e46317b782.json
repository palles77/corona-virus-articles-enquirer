Because processing of the polyprotein is essential for virus replication, norovirus 3CLpro has been targeted for the discovery of anti-norovirus small molecule therapeutics. Thus, we performed functional, structural and inhibition studies of norovirus 3CLpro with fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) assay, X-ray crystallography, and NMR spectroscopy with a synthetic protease inhibitor. Three 3CLpro from Norwalk virus (NV, genogroup I), MD145 (genogroup II) and murine norovirus-1 (MNV-1, genogroup V) were optimized for a FRET assay, and compared for the inhibitory activities of a synthetic protease inhibitor (GC376). The apo 3D structures of NV 3CLpro determined with X-ray crystallography and NMR spectroscopy were further analyzed. In addition, the binding mode of NV 3CLpro-GC376 was compared with X-ray crystallography and NMR spectroscopy. The results of this report provide insight into the interaction of NV 3CLpro with substrate/inhibitor for better understanding of the enzyme and antiviral drug development.",

In the US alone, up to 21 million estimated cases of norovirus-associated gastroenteritis occur each year (2010). Due to its high contagious nature, norovirus outbreaks in cruise ships, army barracks, schools, and hospitals can cause significant morbidity. Furthermore, norovirus infections may lead to fatality in children, the elderly and immuno-compromised patients (Green, 2007) . Therefore, norovirus infection constitutes an important public health problem, as well as a potential bioterrorism threat.",

Recently, outbreaks of extremely virulent norovirus, GII.4 Syndey strain (first discovered in Australia in March 2012) continues to spread globally, including the US (Desai et al., 2012; MMWR, 2013; van Beek et al.) . This emerging norovirus strain is associated with increased rates of hospitalizations and deaths (Desai et al., 2012) . Although norovirus is classified as a Category B bioterrorism agent by CDC, currently there is no norovirus-specific antiviral therapeutics or vaccine partly due to the inability to grow human noroviruses in cell culture (Atmar et al., 2011; Tan and Jiang, 2008) . Thus there is an urgent and unmet need for the discovery and development of antiviral therapeutics for the prevention and treatment of norovirus infection. Our group has focused on the discovery and development of small molecules as anti-norovirus therapeutics with enzyme and /or cell based assay systems (Dou et al., 2011a; Dou et al., 2011b; Dou et al., 2012; Dou et al., 2011c; Kim et al., 2011; Mandadapu et al., 2013a; Mandadapu et al., 2012; Mandadapu et al., 2013b; Pokhrel et al., 2012; Tiew et al., 2011) .",

In addition, the design, synthesis, and evaluation of transition state inhibitors of norovirus 3CLpro, including GC376 (a dipeptidyl compound), was recently reported by our group Mandadapu et al., 2012; Tiew et al., 2011) . In this study, the proteolytic activities of three 3CLpro from Norwalk virus (NV, genogroup I), MD145 (genogroup II) and murine norovirus-1 (MNV-1, genogroup V) were optimized for a fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) assay, and compared for the inhibitory activities of a synthetic protease inhibitor (GC376). The comparative analysis of 3CLpro from different genogroups of noroviruses may provide further basic knowledge of substrate (inhibitor)-protease interactions, as well as finding broadly active inhibitors against diverse noroviruses. In addition, we describe the comparative analysis of the apo NV 3CLpro and NV 3CLpro-GC376 determined by X-ray crystallography and NMR spectroscopy.",

Using similar approach, we investigated the interaction of NV 3CLpro with GC376 which is a specific inhibitor designed to inhibit norovirus 3CLpro from our lab. Briefly, 2D 1 H-15 N HSQC spectra were recorded on 15 N-labeled NV 3CLpro with different concentrations of GC376, and chemical shift perturbation of the 1 H and 15 N backbone resonances of NV 3CLpro were observed during titration with the inhibitor. We have previously reported the backbone and side-chain assignments NV 3CLpro by solution NMR spectroscopy (Takahashi et al., 2013; Takahashi et al., 2012) . NMR experiments were performed at 25 \u00b0C on a Varian 500 MHz VNMR system (Varian Inc., now Agilent Technologies, Palo Alto, CA) equipped with a 5 mm cryogenic triple-resonance inverse detection pulse-field gradient NMR probe. All NMR spectra were processed using NMRPipe (Delaglio et al., 1995) , and analyzed with Sparky (Goddard TD., 2006) and CARA software (http://www.nmr.ch) (Keller, 2004) . A 0.3 mM of 15 N-labeled NV 3CLpro solution dissolved in 50 mM potassium phosphate buffer, pH 6.5, with 200 mM KCl, 5 mM DTT, and 3 mM NaN3 was used to perform the inhibitor titration experiments. Stock solution of GC376 (~50 mM) dissolved in d6-DMSO (Cambridge Isotope Laboratories, Andover, MA) was prepared and added directly into the 15 N-labeled NV 3CLpro sample. 2D 1 H-15 N HSQC spectra of NV 3CLpro were recorded for titration points correspond to GC376/NV 3CLpro molar rations of 0, 0.5, 1.0, 3.0, 5.0. Final concentration of DMSO was 3%, and this concentration has been confirmed to have negligible effect on chemical shift changes of NV 3CL pro in our previous study . All the spectra were acquired with complex points 1024 \u00d7 128 and spectral widths of 14 \u00d7 38 ppm in the 1 H and 15 N dimension. Because chemical shift changes caused by addition of GC376 were relatively large for some residues, additional 15 N-edited NOESY-HSQC spectrum (mixing time 100 ms) was measured and analyzed to confirm assignments of backbone amide chemical shift for those residues. Chemical shift changes by the presence of GC376 were characterized using a weighted chemical shift difference ( \u2122 = [1/2{( H ) 2 +(0.2 N ) 2 }] 1/2 ), where H,N represents chemical shift changes in the proton and nitrogen dimensions on addition of the inhibitor (Grzesiek et al., 1996) .",

NMR chemical shift perturbations of backbone amide ( 1 H and 15 N) resonances in the 1 H-15 N HSQC spectra are sensitive probes for changes in chemical environments surrounding amino acid residues and/or in the relative populations of different conformations in protein structural ensemble (Shuker et al., 1996) . The weighted chemical shift differences of 1 H-15 N resonances for NV 3CLpro in the presence of varying concentrations of GC376 were compared to those observed in the absence of the compound ( Figure 6A ). Significant chemical shift changes were observed in the high concentrations of GC376 ( Figures 6A) , indicating the specific interaction between NV 3CLpro and GC376. In the presence of 5-fold molar excess of GC376, the residues of NV 3CLpro that showed significantly shifts ( d \u2265 0.07) were G15, W16, H30*, V31, V32*, H50*, A52, E54*, F55*, Q57*, E74*, K88, R89, G102, A103*, I104, A105, Q110*, L113, V114, H115, G119, G133, T134, G137*, D138, C139, P142, Y143*, V152, H157, T161, K162* and S163* (amino acids for the triad are underlined). The residues that could not be traced out due to the peak disappearance and/or line broadening are marked with asterisks and the largest positive values ( d \u2265 0.35) in Figure 6B . The line-broadening effects are likely indicative of chemical exchange on the slow time scale (\u00b5s-ms) due to the conformational dynamics of NV 3CLpro interacting with GC376. Figure 6C shows the residues that significantly shifted in the presence GC376 in NV 3CLpro, and the shifted residues include amino acids involved in the hydrogen bonds with the compounds except A158 and A160 ( Figure 5A ), and other amino acids mostly located in the active sites.",

The active site with catalytic residues, C139, H30, and E54 are present in the cleft between the domains. The 3D crystal structures of NV 3CLpro (PDB: 3UR6, 3UR9, 2FYQ, 2FYR) Zeitler et al., 2006) , CV 3CLpro (PDB: 1WQS) (Nakamura et al., 2005) , and Southampton virus (SV) 3CLpro bound with a Michael acceptor peptidyl inhibitor (PDB: 2IPH) (Hussey et al., 2011) have been previously reported. Our multi-alignment of 3CLpro from NV (GI), Southampton (GI), Chiba (GI), MD145 (GII) and MNV-1 (GV) demonstrated that while overall amino acid sequences of all 3CLpro are conserved well, 3CLpro of MNV-1 is more divergent from the other proteases ( Figure 1 ) with especially high divergence in the loop between cI and dI -strands and C-terminal region of MNV-1 3CLpro. Other than those two regions, however, there is a high homology of 3CLpro including the long loop between cII and dII -strands (amino acid residues from 119 to 139), which is known to be the major area for the interaction between the enzyme and substrate. The H30, E54 and C139 in the active site are conserved among the proteases except amino acid E54 was replaced with D54 in the MNV 3CLpro (Figure 1) . The substrate specificity of noroviruses of different genogroups is also well conserved, and the FRET assays with NV, MD145 and MNV-1 3CLpro showed that they are capable of processing the substrate derived from NS2/3 cleavage sites of NV (Figure 2 ). The amino acid identities of different norovirus 3CLpro were found to be approximately 90% within the genogroup and 50-70% among different genogroups (Figure 1) . The FRET assay also revealed that the 3CLpro from different genogroups were similarly inhibited by a dipeptidyl protease inhibitor, GC376, suggesting that a drug may be developed that are broadly active against multiple norovirus genogroups.",

NV 3CLpro expressed in our lab exists as dimers by X-ray crystallography, which is consistent with other reports (Nakamura et al., 2005; Zeitler et al., 2006) . However, the interface between two molecules (monomers) was different from the previous reported NV 3CLpro (PDB:2FYQ) (Zeitler et al., 2006) . It was reported that the regions of bII and cII -strands of NV 3CLpro were in close proximity to the dimeric interface (Zeitler et al., 2006) . However, in our study, the N-terminal end including thehelix region and the region between aII and bII -strands including the loop of C-terminal domain were in closed proximity to the dimeric interface ( Figure 3A) . Interestingly, size exclusion and analytical ultracentrifuge analysis showed that NV 3CLpro exists as a monomer in solution Takahashi et al., 2013) .

The NMR structure of NV 3CLpro in our study also showed minor differences in those regions with overall conserved folds. It was demonstrated that the C-terminal domain of NV 3CLpro is predominantly involved in the interaction with the substrate, in which the binding occurs in the manner of anti-parallel -sheet via hydrogen bond network between the substrate and the protease. Thus, the observed differences are speculated to be originated from high internal dynamics in those regions that are involved in the interaction of substrates. The regions with minor differences in structure encompass the highly disordered loop (L121-G140), most of which have no visible electron densities in the norovirus 3CLpro crystal structure (T123-G133) (Nakamura et al., 2005; Zeitler et al., 2006) . The amino acids in the disordered loop are highly conserved among norovirus proteases, suggesting their crucial role in the interactions with substrates. Our apo NV 3CLpro also demonstrated that the loop had no visible electron densities (Figure 3) .",

We also previously reported the co-crystallization of enzymeinhibitor by X-ray crystallography . The structure of NV 3CLpro-GC376 complex showed that the dipeptidyl compound was covalently bound to Cys residue of the enzyme ( Figure 5A ). Also the structure identified several hydrogen bonds between the inhibitor and amino acid residues including H30, Q110, T134, C139, H157, A158, and A160 in the protease. These amino acids were shown to be also involved in the interaction of SV 3CLpro with Acetyl-EFQLQ-CH=CHCOO-( Figure 5B modified with PDB: 2IPH, Hussey et al., 2011) . Of note, additional two amino acids, R108 and K162 in SV 3CLpro, were shown to interact with Acetyl-EFQLQ-CH=CHCOO-, most likely due to its longer length compared to GC376. In this study, we determined the interaction of NV 3CLpro and GC376 with NMR spectroscopy and compared it to that with X-ray crystallography. In NMR structure of the complex, H30, Q110, T134, C139 and H157 among the amino acids showing hydrogen bonds with GC376 were significantly shifted ( Figure 6 ). Furthermore, additional amino acids adjacent to those directly interacting with the inhibitor were significantly affected as shown in Figure 6C . These findings are consistent with those as determined in the crystal structure using X-ray diffraction. It was reported that NV 3CLpro has the catalytic triad in the active site with a C139 (the nucleophile), H30 (the general base), and G54 (an anion that correctly positions the imidazole ring of the active site H) (Zeitler et al., 2006) . It was also suggested that some norovirus 3CLpro (such as CV 3CLpro) may have the catalytic dyad (Nakamura et al., 2005) . In this study with NV 3CLpro, significant conformational changes were also observed the residues of the catalytic triad in the presence of inhibitor such as GC376 chymostatin .",

Chymostatin is a tetrapetide protease inhibitor with F at P1 and L (V or I) at P2, capreomycidine at P3, and N-alpha-carbonyl at P4 sites. In that study, the chemical shift mapping by the interaction of NV 3CLpro and chymostatin was also investigated using NMR chemical shift perturbation method. Amino acids residues involved in the interaction between NV 3CLpro with chymostatin include E54, Q110, C139 and H157. Overall profiles of amino acids involved (shifted) in the interaction with chymostatin or GC376 were similar, but more amino acids were shifted by chymostatin in compared to those by GC376. The size-differences between chymostatin (tetrapeptidyl) and GC376 (dipeptidyl) may be the reason for why more amino acids were shifted by chymostatin. Nonetheless, GC376 has comparable (or better) activity than chymostatin in inhibiting norovirus 3CLpros in the enzyme assay, which suggests that the dipeptidyl structure has a minimum requirement for the enzyme inhibition. It is also noted that while GC376 is active in the cell culture systems including the replicon-harboring cells and MNV-2, chymostatin did not show any activity in cell-based assay.",
