However diet and the gut microbiota's role in obesity pathogenesis is not simply causative as was initially expected. In fact, a recent observation by Ridaura et al. has showed how co-housing mice with an obese twin's microbiota with mice containing the lean co-twin's microbiota prevented the development of increased body mass and obesity-associated metabolic phenotypes (greater polysaccharides metabolism and proteins degradation) in obese cage mates. More interestingly, an obesogenic diet (high in saturated fats and low in fruits and vegetables) counteracted the protective effect of the lean gut microbiota observed during lean and obese mice co-housing [7] . The role of diet in gut microbiota modulation is strengthened by the recent metagenome-wide association study by Qin et al. in type 2 diabetic patients, with a mainly diet-associated insulin resistance status; the Authors showed that these patients have a peculiar decrease in some butyrate-producing bacteria, an increase in various opportunistic pathogens and an enrichment of other microbial functions conferring sulphate reduction and oxidative stress resistance [8] .",

Using first national, then intercontinental catalogues of reference genes of the human gut microbiome, in the last two decades, researchers used sequence reads and relative gene content to map the profile of the microbial species in biological samples. This is the fundamental principle of metagenomics which, instead of deep genome sequencing after sample culture, collects different sequences from various genetic materials (e.g. from human gut) and is able to use them to mark families, taxa and genera for both microbiome and virome. The knowledge of gene abundance levels can be also associated to different diseases in the attempt to setup a specific genetic marker. Another advantage of metagenomic analysis arises from the possibility to extract genetic material directly from faecal samples without any changes and/or contamination, which may arise during culture [17] .",

Thus, starting from viral genetic sequences, it has been possible to progressively classify the gut virome composition into families. These phage sequences had not been taxonomically classified beyond the family level, therefore microbiologists could not associate and/or correlate this composition to those of intestinal bacterial species. Very recently, Waller et al. used metagenomic viral sequences with a newer sampling procedure for microbial communities characterization at the taxa (about 15 taxa) and genera level. Moreover, these marker genes were found to be absent from 'non-prophage' regions of bacterial chromosomes. The marker genes are used to detect phage sequences in metagenomic samples containing both prokaryotes and phage DNA. Interestingly, Picovirinae and Spounavirinae genomes could be isolated from human-associated bacteria (e.g. Staphlococcus, Streptococcus, Clostridium, Mycoplasma, Listeria, Enterococcus, Bacillus). In particular, among the seven identified viral genera associated to bacterial genera, P22-like genus was found to be connected to genera of the Enterobacteraceae family (Escherichia, Salmonella, Klebsiella), or Spounavirinae with those of the Bacteroidales order. However, over 60% of the metagenomically marked genes could not be used to identify phage genera possibly associated with the respective bacteria, because of the methodological bias of not including lytic genomes [25] .",

In fact, several authors have used the terms \"stability\" and \"variability\" to define phage behaviour. It is interesting to note that these two kinds of characteristics belonging to the bacteriophages in the intestine are linked as in a \"virtuous\" cycle. In fact, the stability of the viral genome is responsible for that of other microorganisms, such as the bacteria of the gut microbiota. This is proven by the fact that gut virome composition mimics the evolution of the infant bacterial microbiota, perhaps remaining stable in adult life [3, 26, 27] , and by 51 hypervariable loci found in virus-like particles (VLPs) purified from human faecal samples. These are common between phages and bacteria, and are implicated in bacterial wall adhesion, immunoglobulin receptor synthesis, contributing to maintaining viral-bacterial immune tolerance in the gut. This allows the persistence of bacterial and viral species in the gut, exerting their effects on enterocytes and, more in general, on the host [3, 28, 29] .",

In this context, these findings are supported by the very recent work by Norman et al. showing how bacteriophages also play a role in the maintenance of mucosal inflammation in IBD with specific ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn disease (CD)-associated phage expansion. In particular, Caudovirales and Microviridae are more abundant in IBD in comparison with household members and controls but with a different Caudovirales genetic sequence distribution. These different bacteriophage increases, in UC and CD, were associated with a lower bacterial diversity, in general, and, more interestingly, with a peculiar disease-specific bacterial strain abundance. This implies a function of bacteriophages in the maintenance of mucosal inflammation in IBD, with a possible function as viral and bacterial antigen \"generators\" (namely PAMPs production) via their lytic state [39] .",

In fact, not only diet, but also the use of probiotics and prebiotics can potentially affect gut virome composition. Finally, if metagenomic knowledge continues to progress, the engineering of viral genomes, and of bacteriophages in particular, could represent a patient-specific treatment \"final destination\".

Panel B: Multiple phage administration can quickly overcome pathogenic bacteria resistance, in a synergistic action with antibiotics. Panel C: Phages could be used for gut microbiota modulation, in general, and for resident bacteria modulation, in particular. Genetically modified phages can be used, alone or in combination with pre-/probiotics, as \"vectors\" for nutrient biosynthesis and degradation, genetic modulation with the gut microbiome, and host beneficial effects (e.g. in obese, dysmetabolic patients) in a more \"stable\" microbiota environment.",
