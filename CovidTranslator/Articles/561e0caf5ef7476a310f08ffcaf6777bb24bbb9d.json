            "text": "Secure and safe food, an increasing human population, an increase of human and animal movement, intensification of animal husbandry, globalizing trade of live animals and/or animal products, bedding and feeds, are all factors that are leading to the increasing threat of emerging and re-emerging animal diseases (including unknown diseases) and those that affect humans. Food security has a high public priority, and the biggest threat is seen as the outbreak of a pandemic event. Despite our best efforts with regards to intensive disease control and progressive vaccination programmes, the implementation of early-warning tools and systems, the use of diagnostic programs and tools, the utilization of marker and tracer vaccines [1, 2] , the unpopular employment of stamping-out policies and the regulation of animal transfer or movements, animal diseases still have a very high impact on animal health and human welfare. Globalization and the opening of borders between countries (e.g., the European continent) have contributed to new and challenging high-risk situations. The recent worldwide incidences of foot-andmouth disease, the extension of bluetongue in the European region and Rift Valley fever into the Arabian Peninsula, as well as the recent reoccurrence and rapid spread of influenza viruses, demonstrates the serious economic and social impact of highly contagious transboundary animal diseases (TADs).",

            "text": "Global climatic changes or variations are predicted to have a direct effect on the occurrence, emergence and spread of viral diseases, especially those that are transmitted by insect vectors. This predicted trend is clearly illustrated by the northward spread of bluetongue virus [3] and African horse sickness virus in Europe -regions of the world where these diseases have previously not been reported. This phenomenon is a consequence of insect vectors (Culicoides) expanding into new territories that were previously unsuitable for their lifecycles. Other vector-borne viral diseases, such as African swine fever, also show S\u00e1ndor Bel\u00e1k \u2020 The early and rapid detection and characterization of specific nucleic acids of medico-veterinary pathogens have proven invaluable for diagnostic purposes. The integration of amplification and signal detection systems, including online real-time devices, have increased speed and sensitivity and greatly facilitated the quantification of target nucleic acids. They have also allowed for sequence characterization using melting or hybridization curves. The newer-generation molecular diagnostic technologies offer, hitherto, unparalleled detection and discrimination methodologies, which are vital for the positive detection and identification of pathogenic agents, as well as the effects of the pathogens on the production of antibodies. The development phase of the novel technologies entails a thorough understanding of accurate diagnosis and discrimination of present and emerging diseases. The development of novel technologies can only be successful if they are transferred and used in the field with a sustainable quality-assured application to allow for the optimal detection and effective control of diseases. The aim of these new tools is to detect the presence of a pathogen agent before the onset of disease. This manuscript focuses mainly on the experiences of two World Organisation for Animal Health collaborating centers in context to molecular diagnosis and molecular epidemiology of transboundary and endemic animal diseases of viral origin, food safety and zoonoses.

In addition to TADs, there is a range of other animal diseases with a 'more restricted' or endemic geographic character, but with an equally high economic and socioeconomic impact. These disease pathogens (e.g., bovine herpesviruses, adenoviruses, bovine viral diarrhea virus [BVDV] , bovine respiratory syncitial virus and bovine coronaviruses) are frequent in cattle populations throughout the world, and their elimination or eradication are important ongoing activities [2, 4, 5] . Similarly, the swine populations of the world suffer from a wide variety of viral diseases -classical swine fever, African swine fever, Aujeszky's disease, foot-andmouth disease and swine vesicular disease. For example, classical swine fever has been eradicated from domestic pig herds in the EU but wild boar populations are still infected in several EU countries, posing a permanent danger of reinfection for the whole continent; in addition, the spreading of African swine fever is complicated by the fact that there is no competent vaccine available and that new variants of the virus have emerged in Africa, while in Sardinia, there is an endemic form of the disease.",

Critical technologic advances for the rapid detection and diagnosis of highthreat diseases are becoming increasingly available in research and industrial laboratories. Much emphasis has been placed on the development of amplification platforms, such as PCR; therefore, the biased focus of this article is toward thermal amplification platforms and their associated amplification and detection chemistries. However, these technologies have not yet been fully exploited and developed into applied tools. Furthermore, efficient, affordable and reliable devices that combine these amplification technologies with sample processing through ana lysis and reporting processes are needed for early warnings against many important livestock diseases. This article aims at providing an overview of some of these technological advances.",

These platforms will increasingly be commercialized as early, rapid, onsite and high-throughput systems. The specification of the real-time PCR platform, such as TaqMan or molecular beacons, is important, considering that the various platforms and chemistries have different strengths and weaknesses, such as detection range, sensitivity, specificity and sensitivity to mismatch, which influence the platforms results. It is important to note that, even within the same platform of real-time PCR or similar real-time PCR chemistries, differences can, and will, occur within and between laboratories [7] . This variation has been highlighted with various TaqMan assays developed for the detection of the same virus that can differ with regards to diagnostic specificity, sensitivity and other important assay parameters [17, 18] . Therefore, it is important to clearly specify the exact real-time PCR platform, chemistry and assay concerned and to provide very exact specifications for the applied method in order to avoid confusion and misunderstanding between results.",

The molecular chemistry used in this assay involves several primer pairs, bipartite primers that contain complementary sequences to those on the microspheres and two rounds of PCR. Technologies different from the probebased methods mentioned exist and are being applied in viral diagnostics; these include surface plasmon resonance and mass spectrometry. One, in particular, that has been applied to viral diagnostics is the IBIS\u2122 system, which uses mass spectrometry on amplified PCR products to derive base compositions [35] [36] [37] [38] [39] . This was used, for example, to detect an unknown contaminant (found by the IBIS system to be bluetongue virus) in a large virus-culture library (Bulte r, Pers. Comm.). Furthermore, low-volume, multiwell, PCR-based systems are reaching the point where automated microfludic platforms and nanovolume reaction mixes offer a variety of systematic options in terms of designing fit-for-purpose molecular detection systems that generate massive amounts of PCR data. The BioTrove OpenArray\u2122 system is an example of such a technology, using a standard PCR cycling protocol designed to function with the system. It can produce 3072 simultaneous PCRs in 33-nl reaction volumes in one plate (approximate dimensions of conventional microarray slide). The plate composition consists of 48 subarrays, each with 64 through-holes or wells (Figure 3 ). To perform the PCR, the OpenArray plate can be constituted in two ways; either the wells can be spotted with primers or the wells can be empty with primers being added as part of the reaction mix. Sample application to the wells can be configured in a variety of ways with the assistance of the AutoLoader equipment. The NT cycler can run three plates simultaneously (9216 individual PCR assays) and monitors the reaction progress in real-time.",

In addition, RNA/DNA extraction could be a real bottleneck when large numbers of samples are processed. The use of nucleic acid-extraction robots is now common in the preparation and purification of the targeted viral nucleic acids that are crucial steps of molecular diagnostic procedures. The use of these extraction robots has accelerated the diagnostic procedures, improved repeatable and increased safety. Realizing the high demand for these equipments, industry is producing a wide range of various types of the nucleic acid-purifying robots. As examples, the Magnatrix 8000\u2122 and the recent Bullet (Nordiag, Norway), the Qiagen Symphony\u2122 and others, utilize magnetic separation of the target molecules and nucleic acid preparations, and the results are more efficient and reliable than manual procedures. The robots simultaneously purify the nucleic acids from 96 samples within 3-4 h, and the products are clean enough to be amplified directly in the PCR. In addition to high speed, robustness and low labor input, robots also can reduce the risk of cross contamination between specimens.",

For example, Smiths Detection's Portable Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory takes the laboratory to the field.

This integrated system provides rapid onsite identification under a wide range of weather conditions. The operators require no technical understanding of the PCR methodologies but the equipment provides an outcome concerning the suspected diagnosis of a viral disease in the field (Figure 4) [104]. Detection is based on advanced PCR chemistry known as LATE PCR. This is an advanced form of asymmetric PCR that efficiently generates single-stranded amplicons under controlled conditions. This technology has also improved sample preparation, suppressed amplification errors, improved probe design for rapid high-resolution ana lysis of the amplified product to make multiplexing easier, which allows for rapid DNA sequencing, and enhance data ana lysis [42, 105] .

Padlock probes have the capacity to detect many different nucleic acid target sequences in a single multiplex-array platform system. Each viral nucleic acid template is a target for a specific and unique padlock probe [49, 50] . The more available specific probes, the more 'different' targets can be detected. The circularized target/probes are then amplified with a single universal primer set. The high-throughput sorting of fluorescently labeled amplicons is then conducted using the tag sequences on a microarray platform. Although the cost for oligonucleotides and array slides is higher than that for conventional PCR assays, it is reduced in proportion to the number of assays in comparison with conventional PCR assay. In this format, multiplex detection using padlock probes and microarrays could have implications in moreeffective screening for viruses causing similar vesicular symptoms and, in turn, facilitate rapid counteractions, especially in case of foot-and-mouth outbreaks [49] .",

The specificity of the assay was determined testing heterologous pathogens. The results indicated that the assay is a useful and robust tool with a high throughput for the rapid detection and typing of AIVs compared with conventional methods. In summary, the padlock probes, adapted to microarray formats, provide a novel means for powerful and very complex novel molecular diagnosis. Compared to real-time PCR assays, the padlock probe-based microarrays are inferior in sensitivity, but they allow for a highly multiplex diagnosis and simultaneous ana lysis of thousands of specimens in the same system.",

Previously, the disease cases were associated with traveling; however, recently zoonotic transmission has also been suspected (i.e., a direct route of infection from animals to humans). Two real-time PCR methods have been developed and compared: a TaqMan and PriProET assay to improve the detection of the virus. These robust, highly sensitive methods provide valuable diagnostic tools to investigate zoonotic transmission and to detect the virus in the food chain. They have also been used in research related to the potential of hepatitis E virus to cross the species barrier. The two novel PCR assays detected a broad range of viruses representing all the four genotypes of hepatitis E virus. The TaqMan assay showed higher fluorescence values for positive samples, while the PriProET assay better tolerated the point mutations in the target nucleic acids and, therefore, is a more powerful tool for the detection of new hepatitis E virus variants. These two real-time PCR assays are useful novel tools for virus detection and molecular epidemiology [51] .",

The PCR product was sequenced and comparative nucleotide sequence ana lysis showed that this virus was closely related to a recently described atypical pestivirus (D32/00 'HoBi') that had been first isolated from a batch of fetal calf serum collected in Brazil ( Figure 6 ). It was also demonstrated that the Thailand virus (known as Th/04_KhonKaen) was circulating in the Thai herd [44] . The study was the first to report a natural infection in cattle with a virus from this group of atypical pestiviruses. The data suggest that these viruses had been spread to cattle populations in various regions of the world. If this global spread has occurred, then atypical bovine pestiviruses will have important implications for bovine viral diarrhea control. This spread also has implications for the biosafety of vaccines and other biological products, produced with fetal calf serum. Virus isolation was not possible since the virus in the serum had been inactivated during processing; thus, reverse genetics methods were applied to 'reconstruct' the inactivated virus until it regained its capacity to grow in cell cultures by using transfection of viral nucleic acids. Full-genome characterization and phylogenetic ana lysis of the new virus were performed after recuperation of the inactivated virus and, based on this, it was demonstrated that the virus was closely related to BVDV, suggesting that Th/04_KhonKaen and other HoBi-like pestiviruses constitute a third genotype of BVDV (i.e., BVDV type 3) [55] .",

In recent metagenomic studies, viral nucleic acids were detected in uncultured environmental and clinical samples by using random amplification of their nucleic acids prior to subcloning and sequencing. Already-known and novel viruses were then identified by comparing their translated sequence to those of viral proteins reported in public sequence databases. A wide range of specimens, such feces, serum, plasma, respiratory secretions and organ suspensions, seawater and near-shore sediments, were tested by viral metagenomic approach. Viral metagenomic approaches provide novel opportunities to generate an unbiased characterization of the viral populations in various organisms and environments. For example, such techniques have led to the detection of new parvoviruses, termed bocaviruses, in lower respiratory tract infections of children [60] . By detecting a range of new viruses recently, viral metagenomics has broadened known viral diversity and opened a very interesting new area in virological research and diagnosis [61] . It is worth mentioning that the aforementioned approaches to determine viral diversity are not completely different and independent of each other as they are frequently used together in a complex assay. For example, full-length amplification and fulllength sequencing of viral genomes is a logical combination for this approach to viral identification.",

Regarding this epidemiological risk, it is extremely important to develop and apply powerful techniques, which are able to detect and identify the variants of the pathogens very rapidly and effectively. During the past several years, numerous developments have taken place in the field, including a variety of advances in the real-time PCR methods, such as PriProET and LATE-PCR. The purpose is to increase the diagnostic robustness of the PCR-based diagnosis and to introduce various simple technical platforms, such as portable PCR machines, which allow the application of PCR under field conditions for 'point-of-care' or onsite detection of the pathogens. The introduction of novel isothermal amplification techniques, such as Invader and LAMP, is further facilitating the adaptation of amplification-based techniques for the front-line diagnosis of infectious diseases. The onsite detection of pathogens is further facilitated by other simple diagnostic tools, such as 'dip-stick' tests, including lateral-flow techniquebased simple devices, which are able to detect and identify the pathogens directly in the disease outbreaks, in human medical and in animal clinics, in animal farms and transport conditions or in the food chain, among others. The introduction of the onsite diagnosis provides novel facilities and strong support to the authorities in prevention and control of infectious diseases, since the rapid, first-line diagnosis is extremely important. However, it has to be considered and accepted that, in general, but especially in case of highly contagious and devastating infectious diseases, such as TADs, the onsite methods have to be confirmed by laboratory-based diagnosis and pathogen identification. The laboratory-based direct or indirect diagnosis is based on a wide range of confirmatory techniques of pathogen detection and pathotype identification.",

Since sample preparation, such as nucleic acid extraction, is another important step of molecular diagnosis, many laboratories purchase nucleic acid-extraction and -pipetting robots. By robotization the nucleic acid-based diagnosis is saving manpower, and the automated processes allow high-throughput diagnosis. Simultaneously, the crosscontamination and carryover risks, which were considered as Achilles' heels of PCR diagnosis for a decade, are minimized.

This allows a very complex diagnosis and provides powerful novel means for the elucidation of the infection biology of various diseases scenarios, such as respiratory or enteric disease complexes, where various viruses and bacteria establish coinfections, influencing and/or aggravating the effects of each other. The microarrays allow a very complex investigation of these scenarios. The further development of microarrays includes improvement of sensitivity (e.g., with combination of amplification processes). Specificity and detection range is further improved by combination of wide-range and highly specific target sequences. The infection-biology investigation is improved so that microarrays will detect not only several pathogens, but, simultaneously, they will measure the immune response capacities of the hosts (e.g., cytokine profiles), antibiotic-resistance values, pathogenicity markers, population kinetics and other important factors of disease prognosis, development and control. Microarrays, especially the liquid-phase approaches, will also allow easy automation and the use of high-throughput, robust diagnostic platforms.",

Rugged portable real-time instruments for field use and robotic devices for processing samples are already available commercially. Various stem-loop DNA probes have been designed to have greater specificity for target recognition during real-time PCR. DNA fingerprinting techniques or postamplification sequencing is used to type pathogenic strains.

Reverse hybridization and, to a greater degree, DNA microarrays (as an example of high-throughput systems), are being used for genotyping related organisms, and can allow for the detection of a large variety of different pathogens simultaneously.
