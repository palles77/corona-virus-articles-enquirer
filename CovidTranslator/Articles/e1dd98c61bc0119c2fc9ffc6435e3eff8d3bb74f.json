A 2.2 kb DNA fragment, encoding for N-terminal domain glycoprotein S of TGEV, was amplified by RT-PCR and cloned into eukaryotic expression vector pVAX1. The recombinant plasmid pVAX-S was transformed by electroporation into attenuated S. typhimurium SL7207, the expression and translation of the pVAX-S delivered by recombinant S. typhimurium SL7207 (pVAX-S) was detected in vitro and in vivo respectively. BALB/c mice were inoculated orally with SL7207 (pVAX-S) at different dosages, the bacterium was safe to mice at dosage of 2 \u00d7 10 9 CFU and eventually eliminated from the spleen and liver at week 4 post-immunization. Mice immunized with different dosages of SL7207 (pVAX-S) elicited specific anti-TGEV local mucosal and humoral responses as measured by indirect ELISA assay. Moreover, the immunogenicity of the DNA vaccine was highly dependent on the dosage of the attenuated bacteria used for oral administration, 10 9 CFU dosage group showed higher antibody response than 10 8 CFU and 10 7 CFU dosages groups during week 4-8 post-immunization. The results indicated that attenuated S. typhimurium could be used as a delivery vector for oral immunization of TGEV DNA vaccine.",

Its causative agent, transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), belonging to the coronavirus, has a positive single-stranded RNA about 28.6 kb and consists of three major structural proteins: a phosphorylated nucleoprotein (N) and two glycoproteins, the membrane (M) and the spike (S) proteins [1] . The envelope S protein is highly glycosylated and mediates the binding of TGEV to its cellular receptor, porcine aminopeptidase N (pAPN) [2, 3] . As the major inducer of TGEV-neutralizing antibodies, the S protein has been used mainly for the induction of protective immunity to TGEV and four major antigenic sites (A, B, C and D) have been defined on the aminoterminal domain [4, 5] . Earlier studies have shown that the intact globular N-terminal half of the S protein is sufficient to achieve a protective immune response equivalent to that induced by the full S protein [6] .",

Protection of the suckling piglets from TGEV infection requires the induction of secretory immunoglobulin A (sIgA) in milk, especially in colostrums. Typically, IgA-producing plasma cells in the mammary gland of pregnant sows originate from the gut-associated lymphoid tissues (GALT) where they were activated by different antigenic components [7, 8] . Thus, new developments have focused on the production and delivery of the S protein through oral immunization. Several systems have been used to express the full-length or truncated TGEV S proteins such as Salmonella [9] [10] [11] , Lactobacillus casei [12] and plants [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] . However, the expression level of antigen protein in transgenic plants is generally low and will lose its bioactivity due to the degradation of stomach acid [13, 18] . Prokaryotic expression antigen protein in bacterial will greatly affect its immunogenicity for lacking of glycosylation and post-translational modification [1, 19] . As fore-mentioned, an easy and effective oral vaccine suitable for protecting against TGEV infection is highly needed in livestock farming.",

Attenuated S. typhimuriu SL7207 with deletion mutations in aroA gene has impaired ability to grow in cultured macrophages and in mammalian tissues. In safety study, neither deaths nor side effects were found in mice post-inoculation with attenuated S. typhimurium SL7207 (pVAX-S) at different dosage (5 \u00d7 l0 8 CFU, 1 \u00d7 10 9 CFU, 2 \u00d7 10 9 CFU). No bacterial were recovered in liver and Fig. 7 . End-point dilution ELISA analysis of the anti-TGEV IgG antibody in murine serum after immunization. Six-week-old BALB/c mice were intragastric immunization three times at two-week intervals with SL7207 (pVAX-S) at dosage of 10 7 (group A), 10 8 (group B) and 10 9 (group C) CFU per mice. Control mice (group D) received 10 9 CFU of SL7207 (pVAX) while group E mice received PBS as negative control. Murine serum, collected at weeks 0, 2, 4, 6, and 8 post-immunization were analyzed by end-point dilution ELISA assay using TGEV as coating antigen. Absorbance was measured at 450 nm in an automated plate reader. Results are expressed as means of the OD450 \u00b1S.D. (n = 3). Numbers on x-axis indicate weeks post-primary immunization. spleen in different dosage group after two weeks of boosting, indicated that attenuated S. typhimurium could be eliminated by immune system after completing the plasmid delivery. At the same time we noticed one week after boosting, bacterial separated from liver and spleen in different dosage groups were significantly lower than one week after first inoculation, which indicated the elimination of immune system to bacterial enhanced with the increasing of inoculation frequency. All the results above indicate that the use of attenuated S. typhimurium is an ideal choice of delivery vector for DNA vaccine orally, concerning safety for livestock.",

They are also able to deliver multiple antigens. Oral delivery increases the safety and ease of administration. In addition, bacteria naturally possess immunostimulatory molecules such as lipopolysaccharide (LPS) that can function as adjuvant to stimulate immune responses [32] , furthermore, live bacterial vectors are able to induce systemic immune response, including humoral, cellular and mucosal immunity against pathogen infection [33] . When comparing the three different dosages of DNA vaccine delivered by the attenuated S. typhimurium SL7207 (pVAX-S), we found that immunogenicity of the TGEV DNA vaccine was highly dependent on the dosage of the attenuated bacteria used for oral administration. Delivery of the DNA vaccine at a low dosage (10 7 CFU) only elicits weak anti-TGEV IgG and IgA antibody through out the experiment. When the vaccination dosage increased to 10 8 CFU, the IgG and IgA antibody level was enhanced, meanwhile the highest antibody response was detected at week 6 post-vaccination when the vaccination dosage was increased to 10 9 CFU.",

The target gene could be expressed not only in vitro but also in vivo to develop a specific humoral and mucosal immune response against TGEV. Although these data are preliminary and an ultimate TGEV vaccine may require incorporation of other TGEV antigens [34] , or together with co-stimulatory molecules or immunomodulatory cytokines [35] , the attenuated S. typhimurium may be an adequate delivery system to be tested in further experiments with the DNA vaccine of TGEV to obtain a maximum immune response.",
