No approved vaccine yet exists for any form of coronavirus. Here we use computational tools from structural biology and machine learning to identify 2019-nCoV T-cell and B-cell epitopes based on viral protein antigen presentation and antibody binding properties. These epitopes can be used to develop more effective vaccines and identify neutralizing antibodies. We identified 405 viral peptides with good antigen presentation scores for both human MHC-I and MHC-II alleles, and two potential neutralizing Bcell epitopes near the 2019-nCoV spike protein receptor binding domain (440-460 and 494-506). Analyzing mutation profiles of 68 viral genomes from four continents, we identified 96 coding-change mutations. These mutations are more likely to occur in regions with good MHC-I presentation scores (p=0.02). No mutations are present near the spike protein receptor binding domain. Based on these findings, the spike protein is likely immunogenic and a potential vaccine candidate. We validated our computational pipeline with SARS-CoV experimental data.",

After our 206 original analysis, two solved co-crystal structures of 2019-nCoV 207 S protein RBD and human ACE2 become available (19, 20). 208 We ran Discotope2 and obtained strikingly similar results 209 (Fig. 6C and D) .

Table 2 . Top potential epitopes for key 2019-nCoV proteins. We ranked epitopes based on their likely coverage of presentation by MHC-I and MHC-II alleles. S protein 494-508 is highly ranked based on MHC presentation and is also one of the predicted top B-cell epitopes, localized near the S protein receptor binding domain (Fig. 5) . MHC-I coverage is calculated by the 9mer with the highest MHC-I coverage for each epitope (highlighted in orange). All candidates are likely to be presented by both MHC-I and MHC-II. \"SARS\" under the antibody column indicates that one or more SARS homolog of this peptide is a known B-cell epitope.

Vaccines for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV have also re-26 sulted in hypersensitivity and immunopathologic responses in 27 mice (7, 9). The diversity among coronavirus strains presents 28 another challenge (1, 9), as there are at least 6 distinct sub-29 groups in the coronavirus genus. And while SARS-CoV and 30 2019-nCoV share the same subgroup (2b), their genomes are 31 only 77% identical (4). Understanding the shared and unique 32 epitopes of 2019-nCoV will help the field design better vaccines 33 or diagnostic tests for patients. 34 Both humoral immunity provided by B-cell antibodies and 35 cellular immunity provided by T-cells are essential for effective 36 vaccines (10, 11). Though humans can usually mount an 37 antibody response against viruses, only neutralizing antibodies 38 can fully block the entry of viruses into human cells (12). 39 The location of antibody binding sites on a viral protein 40 strongly affects the body's ability to produce neutralizing 41 antibodies; for example, HIV has buried surface proteins that 42 protect themselves from human antibodies (13). For this 43 reason, it would be valuable to understand whether 2019-44 nCoV has potential antibody binding sites (B-cell epitopes) 45 near their interacting surface with its known human entry 46 receptor Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme 2 (ACE2).

We obtained the likely 166 3D structure of the full 2019-nCoV's spike protein (SI Ap-167 pendix, Dataset S4 and S5) by homology modeling with SARS-168 CoV's spike protein (31). Given our understanding of SARS 169 (32), the spike protein has two major conformations: up and 170 down. The down position is more stable but less accessible 171 to human entry receptors (e.g. ACE2). The receptor-binding 172 domain (RBD) of the protein undergoes hinge-like conforma-173 tional change to enter the up conformation, which is less stable 174 but more accessible to human receptors (31).

After under-227 standing the landscape of T-cell and B-cell epitopes of 2019-228 nCoV, we summarize our results in Table 2 for promising 229 candidates for 2019-nCoV vaccines. Ideal antigens should be 230 presented by multiple MHC-I and MHC-II alleles in a general 231 population and contain linear B-cell epitopes associated with 232 neutralizing antibodies.

We further search these top candidates 235 with 90% sequence similarity on IEDB (33) to assess whether 236 any candidate has been previously reported for being a B-cell 237 epitope or T-cell epitope. 238 Around 1000 peptide 15mers can be presented by a wide 239 range of MHC-II (>33%), which is consistent with our knowl-240 edge about promiscuity of MHC-II presentation (15, 34). 241 When further requiring a peptide to be presented by more 242 than 33% or 66% of common MHC-I alleles, we narrowed the 243 results to 405 or 44 promising T-cell epitopes, respectively 244 (SI Appendix, Supplementary Tables 5 and 6).

How-271 ever, no mutations are present near the spike protein receptor 272 binding domain, which is critical for viral entrance to cells 273 and neutralizing antibody binding. 274 We observed that significant portions of 2019-nCoV viral 275 protein can be presented by multiple HLA-C alleles. This 276 might be due to relatively conserved HLA-C binding motif on 277 the 9th position (the main anchor residue) where Leucine, Me-278 thionine, Phenylalanine, Tyrosine are commonly favored across 279 alleles (40). HLA-C*07:02, HLA-C*01:02, and HLA-C*06:02 280 all have >10% allele frequency in the Chinese population (41). 281 This suggests the future epitope-based vaccines should include 282 HLA-C related epitopes beyond the common HLA-A*02:01 283 and HLA-B*40:01 approach. 284 Similar to SARS-CoV (1, 8), the 2019-nCoV spike protein is 285 likely to be immunogenic as it carries a number of both T-cell 286 and B-cell epitopes. Recombinant surface protein vaccines have 287 demonstrated strong clinical utilities in hepatitis B and human 288 papillomavirus (HPV) vaccines (11, 42). A recombinant 2019-289 nCoV spike protein vaccine combined with other top epitopes 290 and an appropriate adjuvant could be a reasonable next step 291 for 2019-nCoV vaccine development. Recently, two biotech 292 companies Moderna and Inovio have announced early clinical 293 trials for spike protein based vaccines.",
