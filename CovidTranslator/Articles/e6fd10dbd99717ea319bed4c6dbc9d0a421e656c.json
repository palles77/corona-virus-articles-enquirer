They were characterized by comparison with twenty-six Chinese reference strains and five other IBV strains. Chinese IBVs, which were mainly nephropathogenic, were placed into seven genotypes. Fourteen Chinese IBV isolates were placed in genotype I, having small evolutionary distances from each other. Genotype II included 6 strains that were isolated in the 1990s in China. Genotype III consisted of eight Chinese isolates that showed close relationship with Korean IBV isolates. Another eight IBV isolates clustered in genotype IV and showed larger evolutionary distances. The Massachusetts serotype was present in China in 1990s and was in a separate genotype. Two isolates, HN99 and CK/CH/LHN/00I, which might be a reisolation of vaccine strains, clustered into genotype VI. Four Chinese IBV isolates formed another genotype and showed larger evolutionary distances from other Chinese IBV genotypes (genotype VII). IBVs in same genotypes showed more than 90% amino acid sequence similarities, whereas most of the viruses in different genotypes showed less than 90%. The results showed that IBVs in China came from genetic changes both in IBV populations that existed before the advent of vaccination and in the viruses that were introduced through live vaccines. IBVs showing various genetic differences are cocirculating in China.",

The primary tissue of IBV infection is the respiratory tract, though some isolates replicate in the kidney and oviduct, resulting in nephritis and reduced egg production. Generally, infectious bronchitis (IB) has been controlled with serotype-specific vaccines, but outbreaks of IB still occur, because vaccines offer little cross-protection between serologically distinct viruses [19] . A high mutation frequency and RNA recombination leads to the emergence of new viruses capable of causing disease in vaccinated chickens [31, 41, 35] . Although many countries share some common antigenic types, IBV strains within a geographic region are unique and distinct [1, 4, 15-17, 21, 47] . The identification of the circulating IBV field strains is extremely important for the selection of vaccine strains for the corresponding geographical region.",

The S glycoprotein of IBV, located on the outside of all virions, is responsible for fusion (virus envelope to cell membrane and cell membrane to cell membrane) and is translated as a precursor protein (S 0 ), then cleaved into a carboxy-terminal S2 subunit (approximately 625 amino acid residues), which anchors S in the virus envelope, and an amino-terminal S1 subunit (approximately 520 residues), believed to largely form the distal bulbous part of S [3, 7] .",

The outbreaks of IB have been ongoing, and IB continues to be an economically important disease to the poultry industry, although vaccines based on Massachusetts (Mass) strains such as H120 and H52 have been used for many years. However, the epidemiological analysis of IBV isolates in China has not been thorough except for with a few strains [31, 28, 46] . The relationships between Chinese IBV isolates and foreign IBV isolates, especially Korean, Taiwanese and Japanese IBV isolates, are not known. The focus of this study was to determine the molecular typing of the spike glycoprotein S1 subunit of IBV isolated between the years 1995 and 2004 in China. This will determine the IBV type(s) which are necessary for understanding the epidemiology and evolution of IBVs, as well as isolation of the virus, which is important for improved vaccination.",

The first-strand cDNA was synthesized according the procedures of a previous report [31] using S1Oligo3 [25] and genomic antisense IBV-212 oligonucleotide, 5 -ATACAAAATCTGCCATAA-3 . IBV-212 was designed based on a comparison and alignment of the GenBank sequences of several known Chinese IBV strains and situated in the downstream of S1Oligo3 which had 5 nt overlapped between them. The PCR profiles involved an initial denaturation for 5 min at 95 \u2022 C followed by 30 cycles of denaturation at 94 \u2022 C for 1 min, annealing at 50 \u2022 C for 1 min, and polymerization at 72 \u2022 C for 2 min. The final polymerization step was performed at 72 \u2022 C for 10 min. Owing to genetic variations among IBV isolates, it is difficult to design PCR primers that can be used to detect all IBV isolates. Therefore, three genome-sense oligonucleotides, S1Oligo5 [25] , S1Uni2 [1] , or IBV-87, 5 -TATTGATTAGAGATGTTGGG-3 , which was selected from conserved areas by aligning several known Chinese IBV sequences from GenBank, were used with S1Oligo3 [25] or IBV-212 as antisense primer ( Table 2 ). The PCR products were analyzed on a 1.0% agarose gel and were sequenced directly. In addition, PCR products were also sequenced after cloning into the pMD18-T vector (TaKaRa). Each region was sequenced at least three times from two PCR products from different RT reactions.",

Genotype I consisted of fourteen Chinese strains having small evolutionary distances from each other as shown in the rooted tree (Fig. 2) . Genotype II included 6 strains that were isolated in the 1990s in China. Most of the Chinese IBV isolates included in genotype III were also isolated in the 1990s, except tl/CH/LDT3/03 and CK/CH/LGD/03I, which were both isolated in Guangdong province in 2003 from teal [29] and layer hens, respectively. The Korean IBV isolate, K069-01, which belonged to genotype III of Korean IBV strains [27] , was closely related to those isolates in genotype III. Six of eight IBV isolates displayed in genotype IV were isolated after 2000, and most of them came from southern China. Furthermore, isolates included in genotype IV showed larger evolutionary distances (Fig. 2 ). Ten Chinese IBV isolates formed the genotype V in which H120 was included, and none of our twenty-six isolates were grouped under this genotype. The isolates HN99 and CK/CH/LHN/00I, both isolated in Henan province in 1999 and 2000, respectively, together with a Japanese isolate, JP8127, were grouped into genotype VI. Our three IBV isolates recovered in Dalian, China, between 1997 and 2001, were grouped into genotype VII. A Chinese IBV isolate, J2, which was isolated from the proventricular tissues of infected chickens [46] , was also placed in genotype VII.

Cleavage site motifs of the fifty-seven IBV strains are listed in Table 2 and Table 3 , and twelve different cleavage site sequences were observed. The most common cleavage recognition site observed (24 of 57 viruses) was Arg-Arg-Phe-Arg-Arg. Viruses with this cleavage recognition site are the H120 vaccine strain, one Korean strain, K069-01, Taiwan isolates 3015/ 02 and T07/02, ten Chinese Mass-type isolates, and ten other Chinese isolates included in genotype III (six strains) and IV (four strains). The second most common site was His-Arg-Arg-Arg-Arg. Viruses with this cleavage recognition site include twelve isolates in genotype I and three in genotype II. This recognition site was unique for virus isolates in China. The third most common site was Arg-Arg-Thr-Gly-Arg. Viruses with this cleavage recognition site were placed in genotype VII, which included our three isolates (CK/CH/LDL/97I, CK/CH/LDL/98I, and CK/CH/LDL/01I) and isolate J2. This cleavage recognition site was also unique to viruses in China. The JX/99/01, CK/CH/LAH/99I, and SC021202 viruses had a cleavage recognition site, Arg-Arg-His-Arg-Arg, as did D1466 [22] . Chinese IBV isolates HN99 and CK/CH/LHN/00I, which were grouped in genotype VI, had a cleavage recognition site, Arg-Arg-Ser-Arg-Arg, which was the most common site reported by Jackwood [22] , who had compared the cleavage recognition sites of fifty-five IBV isolates to determine if the site sequence correlates with host cell range, serotype, geographic origin, and pathogenicity. The CK/CH/LSHH/03I and CK/CH/LSHH/03II viruses had a unique cleavage recognition site, His-Arg-His-Arg-Arg, as did isolates BJ and BJY, Arg-Arg-Thr-Arg-Arg, CK/CH/LAH/03I, Arg-Arg-His-Ser-Arg, CK/CH/LDL/04II, Arg-Arg-Tyr-Arg-Arg, CK/CH/LGD/04III, Arg-Arg-Leu-Arg-Arg, BJS, His-Arg-Thr-Lys-Arg, and Japanese Strain, JP8127, Arg-Arg-Phe-Lys-Arg.",

The S1 protein genes, which varied from 0.2 to 26.7% among the strains examined, indicated that point mutations, deletions, and insertions contribute to the evolution of IBV. IBVs in same genotypes showed more than 90% amino acid sequence similarities, whereas most of the viruses in different genotypes showed less than 90%, with the exceptions of isolate BJS (genotype II) and isolates in genotype IV, BJQ (genotype III) and isolates in genotype V, isolates between genotypes I and III, which showed amino acid similarities of 91-94.5%, 90.5-92%, and 93.2-95.6%, respectively. The overall predicted amino acid sequence comparisons of the entire S1 protein of fifty-seven IBV strains reflected that most of the sequence variations were concentrated in three regions. The first included residues 50-87, corresponding to the S1 protein of the H120 vaccine strain, in which the hypervariable region 1 (HVR1) is located [8, 37, 42] .

Since this time, various nephropathogenic strains of IBV have been identified throughout the world [33] . In China, IB with nephritis was first reported in 1982 and several nephropathogenic IBV strains have been isolated in different parts of China since then [31, 32, 44] . Of the twenty-six IBV isolates in this study, one was isolated from atrophic oviduct of a diseased layer hen, six from swollen proventricular tissues of infected chickens, and the rest from swollen kidneys of IB-suspected chickens. Although seven IBV strains were isolated from tissues other than kidney, the gross lesions of kidney in these diseased chickens were also obvious. Based on the fact that these IBV strains were isolated from 1995 to 2004 in China, we considered that IB was prevalent all the while in China, although vaccines based on Mass-type strains such as H120 and H52 have been used for many years on poultry farms, and nephropathogenic IBV was the major type of IBV circulating in China.",

In the present study, phylogenetic analysis of S1 genes showed that Chinese IBV isolates were grouped into seven genotypes (Fig. 2) . IBVs isolated ten years ago were included in the same genotype with the strains isolated recently (for example, CK/CH/LSC/95I and CK/CH/ LGD/03I in genotype III), indicating that this genotype may be indigenous and has been prevalent in China for at least ten years. Serotype differences among the genetically distinct IBVs generally correlated with variations in the HVR of the S1 protein gene [4, 8] and differences of as little as 5% between S1 sequences of IBV could result in poor cross-protection offered by currently used vaccines [19] . The low identities (<83%) of amino acid sequences between Chinese IBV isolates and H120, except for those of the Mass-type IBV, which were included in genotype V in this study, may account for the prevalence of the viruses during the past ten years in spite of the extensive use of Mass-type vaccines in the field in China. Hence, developing vaccines from local strains is necessary for IBV control in China.",

Nine spike glycoprotein cleavage recognition site sequences were found in viruses of genotypes I to IV, in which six were unique to isolates in China, indicating genetically distinct evolution from viruses in other countries by cleavage recognition site analysis. However, a Korean IBV strain, K069-01, shared the same cleavage recognition site sequence, Arg-Arg-Phe-Arg-Arg, with ten Chinese isolates included in subgenotypes III (six strains) and IV (four strains), ten Chinese Mass-type isolates (genotype V), and two Taiwan isolates, 3015/02 and T07/02. Furthermore, K069-01 and Chinese isolates in genotype III shared more than 90% amino acid identities and they were also grouped into the same genotype (Fig. 2) . K069-01 was clustered into genotype III of Korean IBV strains, which was the major type of IBV circulating in Korea, and isolates in this genotype induced 50% mortality in 1-day-old chicks as well as severe renal urate deposition on the kidneys [40] . This was similar to Chinese isolates in genotype I [29, 31] . Based on these facts, IBVs between Chinese genotype III and Korean genotype III had a close relationship, as did NDV [26] , owing to the increased trade of agricultural products including poultry between two countries. Unlike K069-01, isolates 3051/02 and T07/02, which represented TW I and TW II strains, respectively [20] , were clustered into a separate branch that was separated from the Chinese genotypes, indicating that they had different origins.",

As in China, Mass-type IBVs were also present in other Asian countries, such as Korea [27, 40] , Japan [32, 38] , and Taiwan [20, 30] , although Mass-type vaccines were commonly used in these countries or continents. However, Chinese Mass-type strains were all isolated in the 1990s and were not the major IBV type circulating in recent years in China. Molecular studies have shown that a new serotype or variant can emerge as a result of only a few changes in the amino acid composition in the S1 part of the virus spike protein, with the majority of the virus genome remaining unchanged [6] . This could be due to immunologic pressure caused by the widespread use of vaccines, to recombination as a consequence of mixed infections, or to the decrease of dominant serotypes as a result of vaccination, allowing other field strains to emerge. To this study, the Mass-type viruses may have come from the vaccine strains by point mutation, although the possibility that some of them were reisolations of vaccine strains cannot be excluded.",

These two Chinese isolates did not show close similarity to any of the S1 protein sequences of other Chinese IBV isolates available through GenBank or publications. Interestingly, BLAST searches revealed significant similarity (99%) of S1 protein genes between isolate HN99 and a vaccine strain, JAAS (AY839140), which was from Australia and used in China to control IBV. The isolate CK/CH/LHN/00I shared 99% similarity in the S1 protein gene with another IBV vaccine strain, Jilin (AY839144), which was also used in China. When CK/CH/LHN/00I was inoculated experimentally into 15-day-old SPF chickens, no disease signs were apparent (S. Liu et al., unpub. data) . The spreading of a virus from one area or country to another could be due, at least in part, to its improper introduction by the trading of birds or by the use of attenuated vaccines. To our knowledge, no other IBV strains related to HN99 or CK/CH/LHN00I were isolated in recent years in China, and considering the pathogenicity and genetically close relationship between the two isolates and the corresponding vaccine strains, we speculated that the two isolates would be reisolations of vaccine strains.",

In this study, our three isolates (CK/CH/LDL/97I, CK/CH/LDL/98I, and CK/CH/LDL/01I) were clustered into the same group (genotype VII) with J2. Similar to J2, CK/CH/LDL/97I and CK/CH/LDL/98I were isolated in swollen proventriculars tissues of infected chickens, whereas CK/CH/LDL/01I was isolated from atrophic oviduct of a diseased layer hen. It was found that the gross lesions of the kidney in these diseased chickens were also obvious, as with isolate 2992/02 [20] . 2992/02 was isolated in Taiwan and was very similar to the J2 strain by comparison of S1 protein genes [20] . The diversity of the pathogenicity of IBV strains was expected; although the primary tissue of IBV infection is the respiratory tract, some isolates can grow in nonrespiratory organs such as the kidney, the female reproductive tract, intestine, and spleen of chickens [2, 14, 33, 36] .",
