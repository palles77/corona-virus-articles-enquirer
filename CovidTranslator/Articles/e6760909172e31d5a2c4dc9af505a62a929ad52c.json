The model takes into account the known or reported number of infected cases being fewer than the actual number of infected individuals due to insufficient testing. The model integrates intercity travel data to track the movement of exposed and infected individuals among cities, and allows different levels of active intervention to be considered so that realistic prediction of the number of infected individuals can be performed. are used to illustrate the prediction of the pandemic progression in 47 regions of Japan and 50 states (plus a federal district) in the USA. By fitting the model with the data, we reveal that, as of March 19, 2020, the number of infected individuals in Japan and the USA could be twenty-fold and five-fold as many as the number of confirmed cases, respectively. Moreover, the model generates future progression profiles for different levels of intervention by setting the parameters relative to the values found from the data fitting. Results show that without tightening the implementation of active intervention, Japan and the USA will see about 6.55% and 18.2% of the population eventually infected, and with drastic ten-fold elevated active intervention, the number of people eventually infected can be reduced by up to 95% in Japan and 70% in the USA. Finally, an assessment of the relative effectiveness of active intervention and personal protective measures is discussed. With a highly vigilant public maintaining personal hygiene and exercising strict protective measures, the percentage of population infected can be further reduced to 0.23% in Japan and 2.7% in the USA. : medRxiv preprint < 0.0047; 0.0019 < \u03bb j \u2208< 0.0052; \u03ba = 0.1861; k h = 0.6514.",

            "text": "The global spread of the 2019 New Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) has shown no sign of subsiding since its emergence in Wuhan, China, in December 2019 [1] . As of March 21, 2020, a total of 276,472 cases of COVID-19 infection have been confirmed in over 185 countries, with a death toll of 11,417 [2] . Different control strategies at different levels of stringency have been applied to slow the spread of the virus in different countries [3] . While some countries have seen peaks of infected cases and observed significant reduction in the number of new infections in the local communities [2, 4] , the spreading has continued in many countries, and surges in infected cases have been observed in Europe, USA and Australia. Intercity travel has been found to be a contributing factor to the rapid spread of the virus [5, 6] . Thus, effective models for describing the pandemic progression in different cities should take into consideration the volume of intercity travels. Furthermore, the rapid spread of the virus in a population has often been a result of delayed information or unawareness of the real situation in that population, despite the wide dissemination of information related to COVID-19 outbreaks in other parts of the world. The most notable information latency lies in the number of confirmed cases reported, which depends on the ability of the particular country or city to perform tests as well as the possible bureaucracy in the local system of reporting. Thus, the number of confirmed cases is almost certainly not the true number of infected individuals at any given time [7] , and an improved model for predicting the spreading progression should incorporate the latency associated with the reporting system as well as the possible missing cases leading to delay and loss of information. The traditional Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Recovered (SEIR) model [8, 9] thus has obvious shortfalls in describing the spreading dynamics of COVID-19 pandemic. In this work, we attempt to fill the main gap between the number of confirmed cases and the actual number of infected cases. Specifically, in the proposed model, an infected individual may become a confirmed case and then recovered/removed. Moreover, an infected individual may also be recovered/removed without being confirmed as infected. In other words, the basic model proposed here is a Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Confirmed-Recovered (SEICR) model, which has an additional state corresponding to an individual having been confirmed by the authority as being infected.",

Furthermore, the level of intervention in the form of travel restriction, regional lockdown or other active control measures would profoundly influence the rapidity of the spread of the virus and the eventual number of infected cases. The model should therefore allow the level of active intervention to be included as a control parameter and produce the appropriate progression profile. A specific parameter is used to adjust the level of active intervention in the simulation of future progression profiles, which corresponds quantitatively to the increase in the number of individuals eventually infected due to an additional infected individual at any given time.",

Data of confirmed and recovered cases in 47 Japanese prefectures or regions (January 15 to March 20, 2020) and 51 states in the USA including Washington DC (February 20 to March 20, 2020) are used for fitting with the model and retrieval of parameter values. The parameters found are then adjusted to produce future progression trajectories corresponding to the implementation of different levels of active intervention. From the set of best-fit parameters, we reveal that the actual number of infected individuals could be up to 20-fold and 5-fold as many as the confirmed numbers in Japan and the USA, respectively, as of March 19, 2020. Furthermore, if the level of active intervention is kept unchanged, the percentage of population eventually infected in Osaka-fu and Tokyo-to will reach around 12% and 4.2% of the population (around 2,300,000 and 600,000 people), respectively, and in total, Japan will have about 6.55% of its population eventually infected. However, implementing a four-fold elevated active intervention will improve the situation substantially, with the percentage of population infected in Osaka-fu and Tokyo-to reduced to 4.2% and 2.3%, respectively, and over 75% reduction in the overall number of infected cases in Japan. Our results for the USA also show a rather detrimental situation if the level of active intervention remains at the status quo in the coming months, with California and New York state having around 15% and 37.5% of their population (5,800,000 and 7,300,000 people) eventually infected, respectively, and the overall infected population will reach 18.2%. However, by implementing four-fold elevated active intervention, the percentage of infected population in the USA can be reduced to 9.3%. Furthermore, the effectiveness of the public in exercising protective measures can be assessed by varying the infection rates in the model, and it is found that active government intervention is more effective for Japan, while exercising protective measures by the public is more important for the USA. With the public raising its level of vigilance in exercising strict protective measures and the government drastically elevating its active intervention, the percentage of population getting infected can be reduced to 0.23% in Japan and 2.7% in the USA.",

For city or region j, the number of individuals in the five states are S j (t), E j (t), I j (t), C j (t) and R j (t), at time t. The transitions of the five states are illustrated in Figure 1 .

The World Health Organization recommends several specific protective measures to be practiced by the public, including frequent hand washing, maintaining social distancing, avoiding touching one's eyes, nose and mouth, and practicing respiratory hygiene [16] . Recent studies also show that wearing surgical masks also help in some cases [17, 18] . The level of vigilance of the public in exercising personal protective measures can also be incorporated in our model through adjusting infection rates \u03b1 j and \u03b2 j . We can therefore assess the combined effectiveness of active intervention and practicing protective measures in controling the pandemic. Here, we vary \u03b1 j , \u03b2 j and k (c) j from 10% to 100% of the originally identified values in 10 intervals, corresponding 10 different levels of vigilance of the public and active intervention by the authorities. In particular, we assess \u03b1 j and \u03b2 j as one property and k (c) j as another, i.e., varying \u03b1 j and \u03b2 j in synchrony. Specifically, for each candidate parameter set, we perform 100 simulation runs for each combination of \u03b1 j , \u03b2 j and k Our results have highlighted an interesting difference between the effectiveness of government's active intervention and maintaining personal hygiene by the public for Japan and the USA. For Japan, we observe a 27-fold reduction (from 6.55% to 0.24%) in the percentage of individuals eventually infected upon a drastic 10-fold step-up of active intervention, as given in the first column of Figure 6 (a), whereas less than 3-fold reduction (from 6.55% to 2.16%) is observed in the percentage of individuals eventually infected upon the same 10-fold improvement in personal hygiene, as shown in the first row of Figure 6 (a). Thus, government's active intervention seems to be more important for Japan. Moreover, for the USA, we see the opposite. Specifically, only about 4-fold reduction in the percentage of individuals eventually infected is observed upon a drastic 10-fold step-up of active intervention, as shown in the first column of Figure 6 (b), whereas a 6-fold reduction is observed upon a 10-fold improvement in maintaining personal hygiene by the public. Thus, raising the level of vigilance of the public in exercising personal protective measures is comparatively more important for the USA. A plausible reason for the difference between Japan and USA is that the model has captured higher infection rates for the USA compared to Japan. Reducing k j for the US case is thus less effective at such high infection rates, i.e., a fewer eventual infected number per additional infected individual would not help too much. In contrary, the parameter sets for Japan already have relatively lower infection rates, and further improvement by reducing the infection rates would be limited.",

The model thus generally has four dynamical states. From the modeling point of view, the model parameters can be extracted from fitting with historical data consisting of the number of individuals in the infected state and recovered state, which are the usual practically observable data. Outbreaks of the 2019 New Coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic have occurred in over 185 countries since the virus began to spread from China in January 2020 via an active global transportation network. The data of infected and recovered cases reported by different cities and regions have been found unreliable or incomplete, as they are subject to the availability of test facilities as well as other factors related to bureaucracy of reporting and the mode of operation of the medical systems. Nonetheless, figures of \"confirmed\" cases can still be honest figures, though not necessarily the true figures of infected cases.",

            "text": "In this work, we propose a new disease spreading model with consideration of the delayed and missing data of infected cases, intercity travel, and the level of active intervention. Instead of matching the number of confirmed cases obtained from official sources directly with the number of infected cases in the model, we create a new state which is a delayed and contracted version of the original infected state of the SEICR model, leading to a new SEICR model. The model, which estimates the actual number of infected cases after identifying the best parameter sets, is applied to study the COVID-19 pandemic progression in Japan and the USA. Results reveal that the actual number of infected individuals could be up to 20-fold and 10-fold as many as the confirmed numbers in Japan and the USA, respectively, as of March 19, 2020. Our model also allows assessment of varying levels of active intervention implemented by the government, and results show that the current level of control by the Japanese and US governments may be inadequate, and a significant step-up in the level of active intervention is necessary in order to slow the aggressive progression trend in both countries. For Japan, based on the data collected so far and assuming no further tightening of control, our model estimates about 6.55% of the population eventually infected, and a four-fold elevation in control efforts may bring it down to 1.54%. For the USA, our model estimates about 18.2% of population eventually infected if the government does not step up its control, and a four-fold elevation in active intervention may bring it down to 9.32%. Finally, adjusting the infection rates permits assessment of effectiveness of practicing protective measures and maintaining personal hygiene. Simulations of various levels of implementation of combined active intervention and protective measures show that stepping up government's active intervention would be more effective for Japan, while raising the level of vigilance of the public in maintaining personal hygiene and social distancing is comparatively more important for the USA. With the public raising its level of vigilance and the government drastically elevating its active intervention, the percentage of population getting infected can be reduced to 0.23% in Japan and 2.7% in the USA.",

Results are shown in Figures 6(a) and 6(b).The mean percentage of population eventually infected under different combinations of parameter values for Japan and the USA are given in the charts shown in Figures 6(a) and 6(b), respectively. For instance, suppose the level of vigilance of the public has dramatically raised and the level of active intervention has been stepped up, resulting in 90% reduction in the infected rates and 90% reduction in k (c) j , i.e., parameters changed to 0.1\u03b2 j , 0.1\u03b1 j , and 0.1k(c)j . Referring to Figures 6(a) and 6(b), the percentage of population eventually infected can be dramactcially educed to 0.23% for Japan and 2.7% for the USA. Similar interpretations can be taken for any other combination of levels of public vigilance and active intervention.",
