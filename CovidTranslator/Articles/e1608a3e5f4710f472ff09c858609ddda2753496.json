            "text": "A microchip electrophoresis (MCE) method with chemiluminescence (CL) detection was developed for the determination of carnosine-related peptides including carnosine, homocarnosine and anserine in biological samples. A simple integrated MCE-CL system was built to perform the assays. The highly sensitive CL detection was achieved by means of the CL reaction between hydrogen peroxide and N-(4-aminobutyl)-N-ethylisoluminol-tagged peptides in the presence of adenine as a CL enhancer and Co 2+ as a catalyst. Experimental conditions for analyte labeling, MCE separation, and CL detection were studied. MCE separation of the above said three peptides took less than 120 s. Detection limits (S/N=3) of 3.0\u00d710 \u22128 , 2.8\u00d710 \u22128 and 3.4\u00d710 \u22128 M were obtained for carnosine, anserine and homocarnosine, respectively. The present MCE-CL method was applied for the determination of carnosine, anserine and homocarnosine in human cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and canine plasma. Homocarnosine was detected at the \u00b5M level in the CSF samples analyzed while the levels of carnosine and anserine in these samples were below the detection limit of the assay. Interestingly, both carnosine and anserine were detected in the canine plasma samples, but not homocarnosine.",

Over the past years, studies demonstrated that these peptides were involved in important biological roles such as antioxidant action, chelation of heavy metals, and modulation of enzyme activities [3, 4] . It was also shown that the abnormality of their metabolism in the nervous system might be related to certain pathological conditions including Huntingon's disease [5] .",

HPLC methods have good selectivity. However, HPLC has shortcomings including long analysis time and limited column lifetime. A capillary electrophoresis (CE) method with laser induced fluorescence detection was also developed for quantifying these peptides in meat and human cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples [9] . This method had detection limits of 4.7, 4.4, and 3.9 nM for carnosine, anserine, and homocarnosine, respectively. However, the CE-LIF system required sophisticated and expensive instrumentation. Microchip electrophoresis (MCE), as a miniaturized version of classical CE, has recently attracted considerable interest for its potential of miniaturization and integration of an entire chemical or biological analysis process on a single device. MCE has many advantages compared with HPLC and CE, which include higher separation efficiency, shorter run time, lower sample and reagent consumption, and ease of integration and automatization [10] [11] [12] [13] .",

Since a CL detector can be easily miniaturized, CL detection is particularly well suited for coupling with MCE separations to perform sensitive and selective MCE-CL bioassays. Over the past years, several MCE-CL methods were reported. Mangru and Harrison performed an interesting study on CL detection following MCE to monitor horseradish peroxidase (HRP) and fluoresceinconjugated HRP using the luminol CL system [14] . Tsukagoshi et al. developed a MCE system with CL detection for assaying dansyl amino acids, human serum albumin and immunosuppressive acidic protein [15, 16] . However, since the microfluidic channels were extremely small, the sensitivity of these MCE-CL assays fell mostly in the range from 10 \u22125 1 0 \u22127 M (limit of detection, LOD).",

Carnosine-related peptides were taken as the model analytes. To make the peptides CL detectable with high sensitivity, labeling of the peptides with N-(4-Aminobutyl)-N-ethylisoluminol (ABEI) was performed prior to the MCE separation. ABEI is a derivative of isoluminol and highly chemiluminescent upon being oxidized. It has been used to tag biogenic amines for HPLC [17] , and pre-column CL labeling with ABEI has also been used in CL detection following CE separations of arginine, glycine and biogenic amines [18, 19] . We reported recently the development of a MCE-CL method based on pre-column CL labeling with ABEI to determine biogenic amine [20] . An big advantage of using pre-column labeling technique is to avoid adding the CL reagent into the MCE running buffer, further reducing the background noise of CL detection. In addition, a CL enhancer (i.e. adenine) and a catalyst (i.e. Co 2+ ) were used to further improve the MCE-CL assay sensitivity. Use of adenine and Co 2+ as enhancer and catalyst in MCE-CL assays have not been reported before. The MCE-CL method has the advantages of being fast, convenient, sensitive, and reproducible. The use of a microfluidic device coupled with CL detection for peptide analysis with a detection limit at the 10 \u22128 M level was demonstrated for the first time in this work.",

Fabrication of the microchip is described as following. First, the glass substrate with microchannels was fabricated through standard photolithography, wet chemical etching techniques [21, 22] . Sylgard 184 PDMS pre-polymer (Dow Corning, Midland, MI, USA) was mixed thoroughly with its curing agent at 10:1, w/w, and then degassed by vacuum pump. The mixture was cured against the As-Ga mold at 80 \u00b0C for 2 h. After the replica was peeled from the mold, holes were punched as reservoirs. The obtained glass substrate and PDMS cover plate were ultrasonically cleaned with acetone, methanol and water for 25 min, respectively. And then they were dried under an infrared lamp. After being exposed to UV light (6W, mercury lamp) from the distance of 3 cm for 3 h, the PDMS cover was bonded to the glass substrate. Microchannels measured 65 \u00b5m wide by 25 \u00b5m deep for sample introduction, separation and waste delivery, 250 \u00b5m wide by 25 \u00b5m deep for oxidizer introduction and CL detection, respectively. All reservoirs were 4.0 mm in diameter and 1.5 mm deep. The channel between reservoir S and SW was used for sampling, the channel between B and BW was used for the separation and the channel between R and BW was used for the oxidizer introduction. The join-point of the oxidizer introduction channel with the separation channel was used for the collection of CL.",

The tests were carried out by assaying a mixture of peptides at a concentration of 1.0\u00d710 \u22126 M each under varying conditions. H 2 O 2 was used as oxidizer and its concentration affected greatly the CL intensity. Oxidizer solutions containing H 2 O 2 at concentrations ranging from 60 to 120 mM were tested. The results indicated that the CL intensity first increased and then decreased with the increase in H 2 O 2 concentration. The maximal CL signal was obtained at 90 mM H 2 O 2 . It was noticed that the CL reaction between H 2 O 2 and ABEI-tagged peptides was catalyzed by Co 2+ . Effects of Co 2+ concentration on the CL intensity were examined in the range of 0.4 -1.2 mM. The results are illustrated by Fig.2. As can be seen, the CL emission increased with the increase in Co 2+ concentration till it reached a stable CL intensity at a Co 2+ concentration of greater than 1.0 mM. It was also found that the CL emission of ABEI-tagged peptide-H 2 O 2 -Co 2+ system was enhanced in the presence of enhancers. Five different enhancers including adenine, gallic acid, rhodanine, xanthine, and benzothiazole were tested. The results indicated that adenine exhibited the strongest enhancing effect. Thus, adenine was chosen as the enhancer. Effect of adenine concentration on the CL intensity was investigated in the range of 0 -1.2 mM. As shown in Fig. 3 , maximum light emission occurred at 1.0 mM. It is worth noting the CL intensity was nearly 10 times higher than that without adenine.",

Therefore, SDS-mediated MECK was used for the separation. It was found that the introduction of SDS into the separation system significantly improved the resolution (i.e. R s =2(t 2 -t 1 ) /(w 1 +w 2 )). The best separation was obtained with a running buffer at pH 9.8 containing 35 mM SDS. Separation voltage also affected the resolution. It was examined in the range of 2100-3000 V.
