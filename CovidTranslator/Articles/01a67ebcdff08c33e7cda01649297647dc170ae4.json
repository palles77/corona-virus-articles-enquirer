Dutton's special interest was directed to tick-borne relapsing fever of the Central African type. He was able to infect monkeys by the bites of spirochaete-carrying soft ticks, Ornithodorus moubata. What he did not know, Philip Ross and Milne made the same experiment a few weeks before in Uganda. Dutton found also that Borrelia duttoni could pass into the eggs and larvae, and so confer infective potential on the tick of the succeeding generation (Manson-Bahr, 1951) . Robert Koch (1906) , who had no information about these results, found while he was in East Africa in 1905 that this transmission is possible up to the third generation. Christy and Dutton infected themselves with the disease, possibly at the dissection of a patient died of relapsing fever. Christy survived but Dutton died after the fourth relapse on 27th of February 1905 in Kosongo/Congo Free State. He was at the age of 31 years. The news about his death came relatively late to England because ''The journey from Kosongo to the nearest telegraph station takes 2 months'' (Anonymus, 1905) .",

In 1904 he dissected a patient died of Malta Fever and published the pathological findings (Carbone, 1904) . Brucella melitensis was isolated by him and transferred to experimental animals.

The six patients, described by these authors, were horse keepers or horse-bus drivers. Howe and Miller (1947) reported on six cases of glanders occurring within 1 year (1944/45) in Camp Detrick, Frederick, MD. In the small laboratory a research program on glanders was performed. The first two cases occurred 2 weeks after an accident, when a technician dropped a flask containing a virulent suspension of Burkholderia mallei. The technician did not infect himself but two physicians staying in the laboratory fell ill. Two technicians became infected by routine laboratory work and the route of infection of two veterinarians was possibly aerogenic. The patients were cured by sulfadiazine.",

He was born on 14th of May 1860 in Vienna as the third child of Paul Ferdinand Hofmann von Wellenhof and his wife Klothilde, ne\u00b4e Kraus (data from his thesis). He studied medicine in Vienna and Graz (where he was graduated), and was for some years First Assistant at the Institute of Pathology. Then he changed to the Institute of Hygiene, interrupted by some years of assistantship at the Institute of Zoology, all in Graz. As a result of his work in the Institute of Pathological Anatomy he reported on the detection of a ''pseudodiphtheria bacillus'' (later often cited as ''Hofmann-Wellenhof'scher Bacillus''); first on 20th of September 1887 at the 66th Assembly of the ''Gesellschaft Deutscher \u00c4 rzte und Naturforscher'' in Wiesbaden, followed by the detailed publication (von Hofmann-Wellenhof, 1888; Ko\u00a8hler, 2004) . Before 25th of September 1889 (he was since 1888 assistant at the Institute of Hygiene at Vienna) he performed ''infection experiments with the virus of glanders''. Around October 8, his temperature raised and he had pain in his left chest (pleuritic rub). For some days he improved, then he complained about ''rheumatoid discomfort''. Eight days later purulent blisters and abscesses developed, and on 22nd of the month he was hospitalized. The clinical picture was that of acute glanders, and the dissection confirmed the diagnosis. The source of infection was unclear; an aerogenic infection was supposed. Georg von Hofmann-Wellenhof died on 23rd of October 1889, aged 30 years (Anonymus, 1889) .",
