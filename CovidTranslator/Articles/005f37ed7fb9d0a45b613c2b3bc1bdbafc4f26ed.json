However, much is unknown about mechanisms which can give rise to coherent oscillatory behavior, with few exceptions (e.g., explicitly delayed self-repressors and simple models of specific organisms' circadian clocks). We present what may be the simplest possible reliable gene network oscillator, a self-repressing gene. We show that binding cooperativity, which has not been considered in detail in this context, can combine with small numbers of intermediate steps to create coherent oscillation. We also note that noise blurs the line between oscillatory and non-oscillatory behavior.",

A number of mechanisms can be used by organisms to give a reasonably coherent oscillation, including three-gene repressilator systems [1] [2] [3] , self-repressors with maturation times or other explicit, deterministic time delays (as opposed to intermediate steps which would result from a full treatment of chemical intermediates) [4] [5] [6] [7] , more complex negative feedback loops tied to population dynamics [8] combined repression and activation loops [9] , highly non-linear protein degradation [10] , very large numbers (hundreds) of intermediate steps [11] , and self-repressors whose production and gene repression involve diffusion through the nuclear membrane [12, 13] . A self-activator with one stable and one metastable state, and stochastic switching between the two, can cause what may be called incoherent oscillation [14] . Additionally, certain kinds of self-repression can cause behavior which is not coherent oscillation when one considers the deterministic average protein and mRNA concentrations, but which still appear quite oscillatory and reasonably coherent when one considers any given system's stochastic trajectory through protein and mRNA concentration space over time [15] .",

The binding mechanism suggested by the mathematics presented by McKane and Newman in Ref. [15] is in fact a combination of multiple n-mer bindings of regulatory proteins to the gene. In addition, the which n contributes most to the genetic activity here depends on the single parameter which McKane and Newman used to tweak their system and the average number of proteins present in the system. While this in itself may be non-physical, it inherently suggests that the number of bound proteins may be able to change the system from non-oscillatory to oscillatory with noise to (possibly) oscillatory even without noise. We note that the simplest possible version of this last suggestion, a deterministic model with mRNA and with n regulatory proteins binding directly and instantaneously to the gene, cannot be oscillatory. A brief proof of this is included in the section on linear stability analysis (however, the stochastic version of the system can have oscillation-like behavior, and we explore this briefly).",

Even numerical solutions to the linear stability analysis problem alone could have glossed over complex behavior less useful to an organism than regular oscillation (i.e., chaos). However, individual points in different regions identified by the time-series data have been checked numerically using linear stability analysis. In the regime noted as 'oscillatory' via the time-series data, the Jacobian at the equilibrium point has one real negative eigenvalue and two complex eigenvalues with positive real parts, confirming that the point can be oscillatory. Outside that region, all three eigenvalues' real parts are negative, confirming the non-oscillatory classification. We note that the line between the zones labeled 'decaying oscillation' and 'no oscillation' is much less well-defined than the line between those labeled 'oscillation' and 'decaying oscillation', as a system which displays decaying oscillation given one set of initial conditions can have no oscillations with another set of initial conditions.

In the described regime, whose deterministic solutions yield at best decaying oscillation, we now explore the possibility of noise-induced oscillation. We note that the system in this case is between truly oscillatory and simply two-state with reasonably frequent switching. Simple two-state switching would lead to a 'period distribution' (time between maxima) with a normalized standard deviation of that period rt t of 1 ffiffi 2 p . Fig. 1b shows rt t , and Fig. 1a shows the coherence (generalized from the definition used in Ref. [2] ). Coherence is defined as 2 P t H\u00f0d/\u00f0t\u00de\u00de P t jd/\u00f0t\u00dej \u00c0 1 where / is the angle in mRNA-protein space from the average concentration, and d/\u00f0t\u00de \u00bc /\u00f0t\u00de \u00c0 /\u00f0t \u00c0 0:1\u00de. It is, in essence, a measure of how often a system goes forward (clockwise) instead of backward (counterclockwise) in its oscillation. Both the coherence and rt t strongly imply that increased cooperativity yields a steadier oscillatory behavior, but that in the regions explored there is no coherent oscillation (which would require a coherence close to 1 and a value of rt t significantly less than 1). So far, the only pieces of the puzzle considered have been multimer binding of proteins to genes, mRNA, and noise. We now add the final piece, the possibility of proteins binding together before they bind to the gene. The number of steps involved here keeps oscillation from occurring at a cooperativity of 1, but increased n causes oscillatory behavior when combined with the rest of the system.",
