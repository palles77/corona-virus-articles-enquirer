Here, we present a stochastic susceptible-infected-susceptible (SIS) epidemic model incorporating media coverage and environmental fluctuations. By using Feller's test and stochastic comparison principle, we establish the stochastic basic reproduction number R s 0 , which completely determines whether the disease is persistent or not in the population. If R s 0 \u2264 1, the disease will go to extinction; if R s 0 = 1, the disease will also go to extinction in probability, which has not been reported in the known literatures; and if R s 0 > 1, the disease will be stochastically persistent. In addition, the existence of the stationary distribution of the model and its ergodicity are obtained. Numerical simulations based on real examples support the theoretical results. The interesting findings are that (i) the environmental fluctuation may significantly affect the threshold dynamical behavior of the disease and the fluctuations in different size scale population, and (ii) the media coverage plays an important role in affecting the stationary distribution of disease under a low intensity noise environment.",

[12] analyzed a mathematical model on an infectious disease system with a piecewise smooth incidence rate concerning media/psychological effect. In particularly, when media coverage is present, social distancing mechanisms come into effect. The reporting by media can be assumed to be an increasing function of the number of infectious cases present, and consequently, the effective contact rate between susceptible and infectious individuals should be a decreasing function of the number of infectious cases present.

The diffusion term of model (1.2) is not only dependent on S(t) but also on I(t) in a nonlinear form \u03c3 SI S+I dB(t). Moreover, the random noises for the two subpopulations (S(t) and I(t)) are assumed to be correlated, which corresponds to the real situation when the system is suffered from the same environmental factor (such as meteorological conditions etc.). Mathematically, the random perturbations of model (2.4) in [24] are described by two independent standard Brownian motions B i (t), i = 1,2, while model (1.2) uses a degenerate type B(t). Since Fokker-Planck equation corresponding to model (1.2) is of degenerate type, it is difficult to establish the existence of stationary distribution (unless the Markov semigroup theory is used for a two-dimensional system with degenerate type white noise, please see [16, 25] ). Fortunately, there exists an invariant set \u03a0 for stochastic model (1.2), and thus it can be reduced to a one-dimensional system (1.3) with initial value (1.4). Then, using Feller's test we can establish the complete threshold, and applying the Khasminskii's method we can further prove the existence of stationary distribution.",

So we may assume that the average population number in large-scale cites is about N = 13827000, and in middle-scale cites, it is about N = 1382700. Therefore, for model (1.3), we choose two different size scale population N = 13827000 and N = 1382700, which represent respectively two kinds of audience scopes of media coverage. The others parameters are the same as in Table 1 . It can be obviously observed from Fig. 5 that the effect of same intensity environmental fluctuation (\u03c3 ) may result in a more stronger fluctuation of I(t) for the larger size scale population (N = 13827000), that is to say, the smaller size scale of the population is less sensitivity to the environmental fluctuation.

Dynamical modeling of infectious disease has become a powerful tool to improve our understanding of the pattern of epidemic spread and develop better controlling strategies [41] . Meanwhile, in real situation, the environmental fluctuation should not be ignored. In this paper, we investigated a stochastic SIS epidemic model with both media coverage and environmental fluctuation. By using the Feller's test method, we obtained that the dynamical behavior of model (1.3) is completely determined by the stochastic basic reproduction number R s 0 := R d 0 \u2212 \u03c3 2 /2(\u00b5 + \u03b3 ). More precisely, if R s 0 \u2264 1, the disease will go to extinction; if R s 0 > 1, the disease will be stochastically persistent in some ranges and model (1.3) admits a stationary distribution with ergodicity. Our theoretical and numerical simulation results showed that the environmental fluctuation \u03c3 , media coverage \u03b2 2 and population size scale N may exert important influences on an epidemic:",
