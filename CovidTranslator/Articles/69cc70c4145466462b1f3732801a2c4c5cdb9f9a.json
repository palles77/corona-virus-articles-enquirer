The burden of disease is among the lowest in the world even though Canada's ranking, based on health-adjusted life expectancy (HALE), slipped from second place in 1990 to fifth position by 2010 (Murray et al., 2013) . The Canadian health system reflects the inherent complexity and diversity of a country covering the second largest landmass in the world (Figure 1 ). In addition to its original Aboriginal inhabitants and official language communities of French and English, the population is made up of immigrants, many recent, from virtually every part of the globe. Most live in large urban centers that hug the southern border with the United States but vibrant communities, some predating European colonization, are sprinkled throughout the 10 provinces in the south and three territories in the far north.",

The federal government is responsible for certain aspects of health and pharmaceutical regulation and safety, data collection, biomedical, clinical and other research funding, and some health services and coverage for designated First Nation and Inuit populations. The second order of government consists of 10 provincial governments mainly responsible for a broad range of health programs and services including the provision of universal coverage for medically necessary hospital and physician services known as Medicare in Canada. In most provinces, health services are organized and delivered by public bodies known as regional health authorities that have been legislatively delegated to provide hospital, long-term and community care as well as improve population health within defined geographical areas.",

The implicit contrast is with health-care policies, the main focus of which is on treating already ill or injured individuals. Today, public health in Canada is generally identified with six discrete functions: (1) disease and injury control at the population level, (2) health protection at the population level, (3) emergency preparedness and response, (4) surveillance, (5) population health assessment, and (6) health promotion.",

Although health scholars and program decision makers were aware of the impact of living standards, education, employment, and healthy lifestyles on health outcomes, as well as the elimination of financial barriers to Medicare for all necessary treatment and the marginal influence of illness care on the ultimate health of a population, it took considerable time for the full policy implications of this basic insight to be systematically examined.",

Although it attracted little media attention at the time, the four-quadrant health field concept at the center of the Lalonde report would prove to be exceptionally influential not only in Canada but throughout the world, in large part because of its emphasis on the impact of lifestyle and environmental factors as major determinants of health alongside the long-emphasized factors of human biology and health care. The Lalonde report was the product of a group of policy thinkers in the Long Range Health Planning Branch of the federal department of health. For its 8-year existence, the branch operated more like a think tank than a bureaucratic unit within government (McKay, 2000) .",

At the same time, a new Health Promotion Directorate within the federal Department funded and supervised cost-shared projects with citizen groups to pilot the new approach to health determinants. Although the projects at the local, regional, and national level initially focused on encouraging lifestyle changes, they eventually targeted larger societal and structural changes. This work had a profound impact on Health and Welfare Canada's Framework for Health Promotion as well as the major contributions of Canada to the World Health Organization's first international conference on health promotion and the release of the Ottawa Charter for Health Promotion, both of which appeared in 1986 (Epp, 1986; Boyce, 2002) . Despite these advances, Canada's more traditional system of public health remained highly fragmented, poorly coordinated, and poorly funded by federal, provincial, and local governments. As a consequence, it did not fare well when faced with its first major crisis of the twenty-first century.",

Influenced by the coordinating function of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in the United States, the Naylor Committee recommended the establishment of a national public health agency in Canada (Health Canada, 2003) .

Tobacco consumption has fallen by almost 50% since the early 1980s, a result in part of aggressive anti-tobacco initiatives by the federal and provincial governments and fundamental changes in attitudes and lifestyle behaviors by Canadians. Though not as dramatic, alcohol consumption has also fallen over the same period, again in part the result of attitudinal and behavioral changes. However, Canadians have been increasing their intake of calories, apparently the result of greater reliance on prepared foods from both supermarkets and restaurants, which tend to have higher fat content.

During the early to mid-1990s, access to, and the quality of, some health services were impaired as a result of government budget cutbacks. As a consequence, public confidence in the system was eroded although most Canadians remained committed to the solidarity principles underlying Medicare (Romanow, 2002) . Since the late 1990s, both federal and provincial governments have been reinvesting in public health care in an effort to improve quality and reduce waiting time. This public reinvestment in health care has triggered concerns about the fiscal sustainability of Medicare. In reality, most of the cost drivers appear to be in the mixed and private categories of health services rather than Medicare services. In particular, the growth of private and public prescription drug plans has been in excess of double the rate in growth of hospital and physician expenditures. Despite this, most media and think tank commentators continue to focus on Medicare, occasionally suggesting alternatives to the current single-payer model of administration. These arguments were given considerable political support in a recent Supreme Court of Canada judgment. In the now famous Chaoulli case, the court concluded that the Quebec government's prohibition on private insurance for Medicare services violated the province's Charter of Rights in a situation in which a patient waits an unreasonable amount of time for elective surgery. While the decision is not likely to lead to private, multipayer insurance for Medicare services, it has fueled the ongoing debate concerning the appropriate divide between the public and the private sector in financing, administration, and delivery of health care in Canada.",
