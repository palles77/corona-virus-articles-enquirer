Coronavirus S proteins are extensively glycosylated viral fusion proteins, encoding around 69-87 N-linked glycosylation sites per trimeric spike. Using a multifaceted structural approach, we reveal a specific area of high glycan density on MERS S that results in the formation of under-processed oligomannose-type glycan clusters, which was absent on SARS and HKU1 CoVs. We provide a comparison of the global glycan density of coronavirus spikes with other viral proteins including HIV-1 envelope, Lassa virus glycoprotein complex, and influenza hemagglutinin, where glycosylation plays a known role in shielding immunogenic epitopes. Consistent with the ability of the antibody-mediated immune response to effectively target and neutralize coronaviruses, we demonstrate that the glycans of coronavirus spikes are not able to form an efficacious high-density global shield to thwart the humoral immune response. Overall, our data reveal how differential organisation of viral glycosylation across class I viral fusion proteins influence not only individual glycan compositions but also the immunological pressure across the viral protein surface.",

MERS S binds to dipeptidyl-peptidase 4 (DPP4) 18 , whereas SARS S 19 and 2019-nCoV 20 utilize angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as a host cellular receptor. CoV S proteins are the largest class I viral fusion proteins known 15 , and are extensively glycosylated, with SARS and MERS S glycoproteins both encoding 69 N-linked glycan sequons per trimeric spike with 2019-nCoV containing 66 sites. These extensive post-translational modifications often mask immunogenic protein epitopes from the host humoral immune system by occluding them with host-derived glycans 21, 22 . This phenomenon of immune evasion by molecular mimicry and glycan shielding has been observed and well characterised across other viral glycoproteins, such as HIV-1 envelope protein (Env) [23] [24] [25] , influenza hemagglutinin (HA) [26] [27] [28] and Lassa virus glycoprotein complex (LASV GPC) [29] [30] [31] .",

Additionally, we compare the structures of the respective glycan coats of SARS and HIV-1 envelope proteins using cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM) and computational modelling, which delineate a sparse glycan shield exhibited on SARS S compared to other viral glycoproteins. We therefore undertook a comparative analysis of viral glycan shields from characterized class I fusion proteins to highlight how glycosylation density influences oligomannose-type glycan abundance, and the relationship between effective glycan shields and viral evasion ability.

To this end, N-linked glycans were enzymatically released, fluorescently labelled, and subjected to hydrophilic interaction chromatography-ultra-performance liquid chromatography (HILIC-UPLC).

This observation of both complex and oligomannose-type glycans reveals that the majority of N-linked glycans are able to be processed, although there is limited processing at specific sites across the S proteins.

In order to visualize the structure of the respective glycan \"shields\" of HIV-1 and SARS coronavirus, we used single-particle cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM), as recently described 53 . The results for HIV-1 Env were reproduced from Berndsen et al. 53 while the previously published SARS 2P dataset 54 was reprocessed for this study. Although cryo-EM datasets of fully glycosylated MERS S 41 and chimpanzee simian immunodeficiency virus (SIVcpz) 55 are also available, only the HIV and SARS data were of sufficient quality (Fig. 5) . Using combination of low-pass filtering and thresholding, along with 3D variability analysis, we can reveal the previously hidden structure of the SARS glycan shield and compare it with the HIV-1 Env glycan shield 53 (Fig. 5) . We observe the nearly all-encompassing glycan density on HIV-1 Env and evidence for extensive glycan-glycan interactions, especially in the oligomannose patch regions, whereas the glycans on SARS S are more isolated and lack the wide-ranging glycan networks that are the hallmark of an effective glycan shield 56, 57 . The high variability around the S1 receptor binding domains is indicative of their flexibility, which is necessary for the spike to engage its receptor 58 ; however, this intrinsic property complicates the analysis of the signal from glycans in this region.",

However, it is tempting to speculate, for example, that MERS has not evolved a dense shield since it would not offer as much of a protective advantage against camel nanobodies (also known as single-domain antibodies) which could more easily penetrate it. Investigation of the host immune response to viruses in their natural reservoirs may offer a route to understanding why coronavirus glycosylation does not reach the density of other viruses such as HIV-1.

Although dN/dS estimates are comparable within each viral outbreak, they are not directly comparable between viral families as they can only be considered in the environment in which they are measured (i.e. multiple differences in transmission ecology and host-virus interactions disallow meaningful comparisons). For example, differences in the epidemic behaviour and host immune environment of MERS and SARS outbreaks likely contribute to the observed genetic diversity and thus dN/dS. MERS was characterized by repeated spillover events from camels into humans, where it circulated transiently. In contrast, the SARS outbreak corresponded to a single zoonotic event followed by extensive human-to-human transmission. Consequently, inferring the degree of selection acting upon MERS and SARS from dN/dS analysis is extremely difficult. Amino-acid sequence diversification across SARS and MERS spikes.
