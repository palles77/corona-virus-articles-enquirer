A previous study reported a 16-month child who was infected by HBoV1 and also showed presence of HRV, developed severe pneumonia. 5 Here we reported co-infection with HBoV1 and HRV-C in an adult woman with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).",

Blood and respiratory secretions were negative for bacteria, and fungi in cultures, and G-test and GM-test, respectively. HIV, HBV, influenza viruses, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and other coronaviruses were negative by ELISA and/or (RT-)PCR assays. Pulmonary secretions from the first day of hospitalization were further analyzed using metagenomic sequencing as described previously. 6 Of 64,024,857 total reads, 2166 (0.0034%) were of viral origin. Two respiratory viruses, HRV (1309 reads, 60.4%) and HBoV (197 reads, 9.1%) were found with high percentages (Fig. 1B) . The presence of HRV and HBoV were confirmed by specific (RT-)qPCR assays, and HBoV1 RNA was also detected at all sample points. HRV-C and HBoV1 were determined by phylogenetic analyses of HRV VP4/VP2 and HBoV VP1/VP2 fragments, respectively (Fig. 1C) . Specific IgM and IgG responses against HBoV1 and HRV-C were further investigated by ELISA (Feiya BioTech, China). The serum IgG and IgM levels of the patient showed 2.2 to 4.7 fold increases for HRV-C and 5.1 to 2.6 fold increases for HBoV1 from February 4 to February 15, respectively (Fig. 1D) . Above results indicated an acute co-infection with HBoV1 and HRV-C in the patient. We further characterized the dynamics of both viruses using (RT-)qPCR assays (Fig. 1E) . After 2 days of treatment, the viral load of HRV-C and HBoV1 among swabs showed a rapid decrease from 1.3 \u00d7 10 4 copy/ml to below the detection limit, and from 1.2 \u00d7 10 6 copy/ml to 2.7 \u00d7 10 4 copy/ml, respectively. Then, HRV-C viral load remained undetectable among swabs and sera, while HBoV1 viral load started a slowdown from 2.7 \u00d7 10 4 copy/ml to 1.2 \u00d7 10 3 copy/ml during whole treatment, indicating a persistent infection of HBoV1. 5 Accompanied by the antiviral treatment, the patient progressively recovered and bilateral lung opacity improved rapidly, indicating that the treatment was effective. It was difficult to determine which virus was mainly responsible for the case. But the recovery of the patient from the rapid elimination of HRV-C and a persistent presence of HBoV1 among swabs and sera suggested that HRV-C may be the principal causative agent for the severe pneumonia. HRV was often associated as severe respiratory illness in children and adults. [7] [8] [9] As there are still questions about the role of HBoV as a single causative agent, it is possible that the simultaneous HBoV1 infections worsen the illness caused by preceding HRV-C infection.",
