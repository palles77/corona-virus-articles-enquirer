As virus identification may influence admission and treatment decisions, it is important to perform NPA in the emergency department. The test may be uncomfortable and poorly tolerated. This prospective study investigated patients' perceptions of NPA. Patients in the emergency department with upper respiratory tract infection undergoing NPA between 9 March 2005 and 12 August 2005 were included. 86 patients (mean (SD) age 47 (23) years; 49 women) were recruited. 22 (26%) patients complained that NPA was very uncomfortable, 59 (69%) reported that it was mildly uncomfortable and 5 (6%) patients reported no discomfort. On a 10-point scale, the median discomfort score was 4. 29 (34%) patients stated that NPA was more uncomfortable than blood taking, 19 (22%) patients felt that both were similar and 38 (44%) patients felt that NPA was less uncomfortable (p value not significant). NPA performed in the emergency department is well tolerated and should be considered in emergency departments when results may influence patient management. N asopharyngeal aspiration (NPA) is the method of choice for collecting specimens for viral culture in patients with suspected respiratory tract infection. With the impending threat of a global influenza pandemic, early positive identification of viral infection may influence admission and treatment decisions. It is therefore important to perform the test at the earliest possible opportunity, even in the emergency department. However, the test is sometimes perceived as uncomfortable and poorly tolerated.",

The severe acute respiratory syndrome outbreak showed the importance of identifying patients with community acquired pneumonia with highly contagious disease to allow appropriate inpatient infection control. Triage of patients with community acquired pneumonia to general medical wards or infectious diseases isolation wards is a central role of the emergency department. 9 NPA is recognised as the gold standard for collecting specimens for respiratory virus identification. Performing NPA in the emergency department has the potential to improve patient care by shortening the time to definitive diagnosis. Early recognition of varying viral aetiologies is also useful for public health as it allows tracking of viral infection prevalence in all patients in the emergency department who were assessed for potential respiratory tract infections. In the context of influenza testing, enzyme immunoassays are now becoming available as bedside tests, with high sensitivities and very high specificities reported. 10 11 These offer the possibility of point-of-care testing for influenza in the emergency department, which could guide admission, cohorting and therapeutic decision making. NPA is well tolerated by patients in the emergency department and there is minimal post-NPA nasal bleeding. Increased resources will be required to cope with increasing nursing workload as trained nurses in full personal protective equipment are necessary to reduce the risk of cross-contamination and to maximise NPA culture yields.",

Wall suction (2100 mm Hg) is applied to the catheter with an intervening mucus trap and a nasopharyngeal specimen is collected.
