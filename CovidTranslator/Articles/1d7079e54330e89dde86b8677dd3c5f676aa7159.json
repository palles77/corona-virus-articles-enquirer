As a result, an imbalance between high detection rate and low false alarm rate occurs. To solve this problem, this study proposes a novel outbreak detection model based on danger theory; a bio-inspired method that replicates how the human body fights pathogens. We propose a signal formalization approach based on cumulative sum and a cumulative mature antigen contact value to suit the outbreak characteristic and danger theory. Two outbreak diseases, dengue and SARS, are subjected to a danger theory algorithm; namely the dendritic cell algorithm. To evaluate the model, four measurement metrics are applied: detection rate, specificity, false alarm rate, and accuracy. From the experiment, the proposed model outperforms the other detection approaches and shows a significant improvement for both diseases outbreak detection. The findings reveal that the robustness of the proposed immune model increases when dealing with inconsistent outbreak signals. The model is able to detect new unknown outbreak patterns and can discriminate between outbreak and non-outbreak cases with a consistent high detection rate, high sensitivity, and lower false alarm rate even without a training phase.",

An accurate and fast alarm notification system allows healthcare professionals to set up an early prevention plan before an outbreak spreads to a wider geographical area. If an outbreak is uncontrollable, it may lead to high death tolls and worse still; it kills without warning [1] . For example, the spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) [2] , influenza [3, 4] , and the avian virus [5] led to high mortality rates shortly after the first case was detected. Beside those viruses, there are seasonal types of diseases such as malaria, dengue, cholera and many more that can be classified as having the potential to escalate to outbreaks according to the World Health Organization and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention portal. One of the indirect effects of an outbreak is that it has a detrimental economic impact on a country. This is exemplified by the SARS and avian virus outbreaks in 2003, which led to a huge loss of around US$20 million for the tourism industry in most affected Asian countries such China, Hong Kong, Singapore and Vietnam because of an ineffective surveillance system [6] . For this reason, we need to be able to rely on an accurate detection system to monitor for signs of an emerging outbreak. The importance of having such a system has been emphasized in much of the literature, not least because it can help authorities to control the spread of an outbreak and reduce the mortality rate [4, 7] .",

A health surveillance system can monitor the progress of incidences of a disease over time: daily, weekly, or monthly. If there is an extraordinary pattern, this might indicate that an outbreak has started [9] . A sudden increase in the number of suspected cases from previous day is an indicator of a potential outbreak and it changes are viewed as abnormal characteristics; therefore an outbreak detection system is actually looking for anomalies in health data [10, 11] . In outbreak detection studies, an outbreak is a collective anomaly where it requires more than one case to be detected before it can be labelled as an actual outbreak [12, 13] . For example, if a single patient has been detected as having a certain disease, the alert system will not be activated until the number of similar cases has reached a certain default number.",

However, when the spread of an outbreak is slow, the number of cases is not the key indicator and further epidemiological investigation is required [15] . Asthe notification of outbreak is based on collective anomalies that need to be tailored with same locality and time, this makes outbreak detection different from other detection tasks such as intrusion, fraud and fault.",

Those methods can be classified into three main approaches: statistical [1, 9, [16] [17] [18] , artificial intelligence [15, [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] , and a combination of these two approaches into hybrid methods [26] [27] [28] . The statistical approach was applied in early outbreak detection models and to date it remains the preferred approach in many health surveillance systems [29, 30] . One of the key issues that needs to be addressed in existing models is how to obtain a high detection rate while at the same time reducing the false alarm rate. However, due to the weakness of the outbreak signal which always behaves under uncertainties, existing systems produce an inconsistent false alarm rate during detection. Here, uncertainty refers to inconsistent outbreak signals, where the outbreak pattern frequently changes and differs between years. This means that a trained model has less capability in terms of robustness particularly when unseen outbreak patterns vary from the trained model. Robustness is also lost when detection algorithms require a sample from both an outbreak and non-outbreak session for model development. However, in practice, it is a challenging task to define a sample for an outbreak period because most of the data available relate only to non-outbreak periods.",

            "text": "Previously, outbreak detection models were mostly based on the univariate surveillance approach [18, 31] . However, due to the weakness of the outbreak signal, the possibility of these models generating an imbalanced result between detection rate and false alarm rate is high because they rely on a single attribute [28] . As a possible solution to this problem of a weak signal, researchers have been investigating the use of multivariate surveillance by injecting the weak signal with a stronger signal, for instance by combining spatial and temporal data [1, 16, 32] . In addition, efforts have been made to combine multiple syndromic data to boost detection, for instance by combining emergency visit data with weather information, or clinical diagnosis results [33, 34] and by investigating social network status and internet tracking search [22, 35, 36] . Since an outbreak is observed over time, distraction factors such as the seasonal event effect always disturb the detection results [9] . In relation to the data issue, each disease has a different outbreak definition which is determined by its the environment, government policies, outbreak rate and the medium for spread. Information on aspects such as outbreak duration (outbreak period), outbreak magnitude (rate of outbreak cases) and onset date are required and they are different depending on the disease [7] . The above-mentioned factors indirectly influence the effectiveness of an outbreak algorithm. Fig. 1 depicts the general outbreak detection concept. In this conceptual model, an outbreak is defined based on three parameters: similar time, similar place, and huge number of reported cases. The aim of the outbreak detection model is to generate an accurate alarm which has high sensitivity and fast detection time. Since an outbreak is viewed as an abnormal period, anomaly detection analysis is used to detect the point at which data start to abnormally change. The quality of outbreak data and disease characteristic are the two factors that influence detection performance.",

In this paper, an outbreak detection model based on danger theory is proposed. Danger theory is a bio-inspired method that replicates how the human body fights pathogens and the literature has shown that it can solve problems mainly related to the detection process. While not many works that apply danger theory have addressed the outbreak detection problem, danger theory has been successfully applied in intrusion [37, 38] , fraud [39, 40] , and fault detection problems [41] with good detection performance. Since the capability of danger theory as a good detector is proven in other areas, it motivates us to adapt the artificial immune system (AIS) as an outbreak detection model. The robustness of the immune system mostly lies in the ability of the dendrite cell to sense an early death cell (viewed as an outbreak signal), which can be replicated in an outbreak detection model to reduce the high false alarm rate. Moreover, danger theory offers a multivariate detection approach without relying on a training phase, which can improve a model's robustness.",

The key point of danger theory is that the immune system only reacts to the danger signal which will do harm to health.

It relies on the function of dendrite cells, a family of cells known as macrophages. As an antigen presenting cell, the dendrite cell controls the activation state of T-cells in the lymph nodes and it has three different states, namely immature state, semi-mature state and mature state. At the beginning of the detection process, the dendrite cells, which are initially born as immature cells in thymus, observe the progress of the body's cells. At this stage, the dendrite cell collects the body cell protein paired with its three signals; pathogen associated molecular patterns (PAMP), danger, and safe signal in cell tissue as shown in Fig. 2 . Based on the collected input throughout its life span, the dendrite cell will evolve from being immature into one of two maturation states: either a semi-mature (apoptotic death) or a mature state (necrotic death). At this phase, the dendrite cell is migrated from cell tissue to lymph node. Reaching a 'mature' state indicates that the cell has experienced more danger signals throughout its life span that have been caused by a foreign antigen, wound, etc. If this happen, it indicates that the harmful antigen has been detected and a danger zone will be released. From a mature state, T-cells are activated to release antibody. While a 'semi-mature' state indicates that apoptotic death has occurred and this is seen as part of normal cell function. The semi mature dendrite cells cannot activate T-Cells and they are tolerized to the presented antigen.",

In this context, all outbreak datasets are considered as antigens and all of them have a similar chance of being affected by foreign antigens.

This type of algorithm is able to detect network intrusion with better performance compared to negative selection algorithms. Later, a more sensitive version of the DCA was proposed which included new controllable parameters [45] . Following successful trials, danger theory has been applied to address a wide range of computer security network issues such as malicious code detection, misbehaviour in wireless networks, port scanning, spyware, and worm detection [37, 38, [46] [47] [48] [49] [50] [51] [52] [53] [54] . Besides providing accurate detection with a lower false alarm rate, the danger theory framework can be applied as an agent in huge real-time heterogonous networks [55] [56] [57] [58] . In line with this, other recent work demonstrates that the danger theory framework can be implemented in real-time flood detection in a big scalable environment with fast response to pattern changes [54] .

For example in fraud detection, the danger theory approach is hybridized with a negative selection algorithm to detect fraudulent online video-on-demand transactions [39, 60] as well as fraud in runtime malware for Windows processes [40] . Inspired by dendrite cell function, danger theory has also been implemented in the area of fault detection. For example, Ran, et al. [41] adopt the idea of the DCA to diagnose faults in robots and control systems. In line with their work, Prieto, Nino, & Quintana [61] have proved the ability of danger theory as an efficient detector in control systems. They propose the DTAL, which is a goalkeeper strategy in robot soccer. In addition, danger theory has also been successfully applied to detect faults in task scheduling where each job to be scheduled is considered as an antigen and aligned with the cell signal [62] . Other successful applications for fault diagnosis can be seen in Laurentys, Palhares, & Caminhas [63] and Zhou, Fan, & Zhang [64] . As well as acting as an anomaly detector, danger theory has also performed well in other data mining task such as filtering web documents [65] and image classification [66] . Based on the successful results in intrusion, fraud, and fault detection, danger theory seems to have the potential to detect outbreak signals with good results. Since, to the best of our knowledge, there does not appear to be a recent outbreak detection model based on danger theory, we propose an outbreak detection model based on danger theory in the next section.",

However, where the attribute may or may not indicate an anomalous situation but the probability of an anomaly is higher under normal circumstances and is labelled as a danger signal [43] . Categorical data need to be transformed into numerical data since the DCA only functions in numerical form. For transformation, the categorical value of an attribute is replaced with the total reported cases in a day. For example, the reported symptoms attribute in the WSARE dataset [67] has four categories which are none, respiratory, nausea, and rash.

The above section showed that the proposed outbreak detection model based on danger theory generates a consistent result between high DR, SPS and lower FAR. The preference matrix in Table 8 reveals the ability of danger theory to act as a framework for an outbreak detection model when DCA has the lowest weight score after considering all performance metrics. Through the preference matrix [68] , the accumulative score of each of the performance metrics is given based on the priority of each metric; highest (DR, SPS, ACC) or lowest priority (FAR). A score of 1 is given for the best mining and score 6 for the worst result according to the priority metric. The accumulative weight score ( S1, S2) represents the total scores of all priorities. The lowest score indicates the best model. Based on the last column of Table 8 ( S1 + S2), DCA has the lowest score, which indicates the most accurate approach for both outbreaks.",

            "text": "There are several benefits that can be derived from the proposed immune system, as summarized in Table 9 . First, danger theory overcomes the inconsistent outbreak signal problem. This can be seen from how danger theory perceives the input data. In danger theory, all data inputs are considered as antigens where they have a similar chance of becoming infected with a harmful pathogen. Based on the generated MCAV that represents the antigen life experience, it determines whether the antigen has died due to infection (outbreak) or not (non-outbreak). Since outbreak and non-outbreak periods are hard to define in real life, danger theory eliminates the assignment of input data to both of these periods during model development. Therefore, there is no need for a training phase and or a pre-developed model in danger theory. This is in contrast to some other detection approaches such as MLP and NB, where the model must first be trained. As a result, the robustness of these models can decrease when the unseen pattern is not the same as that learned during the training phase. Based on the experiments, danger theory can highly discriminate between outbreaks and non-outbreaks with consistent detection results even though no training phase is involved. Moreover, since no training phase is required, the proposed model is able to process real-time input and has high potential for implementation as a real-time system. Second, danger theory is a multivariate detection approach. In a biological immune system, a dendrite cell processes three input signals (PAMP, danger, safe) into three output signals (CSM, mature, semi-mature). During this process, DCA may accept various inputs in term of cell protein and classify them either into PAMP, danger, or safe. As an outbreak signal is often weak and not consistent, the use of multiple input factors may improve detection performance in comparison to those methods that rely on a single predictive factor Table 8 The preference matrix.",

The dendrite cell process uses multiple input signals Accepts multiple input factors to improve detection performance rather than relying on a single predictive factor [28] . As an example, three attributes for a dengue outbreak (average humidity, average temperature and average rainfall) are taken as inputs for the danger signal while the emergency visit statistic is assigned to either a PAMP or safe signal. From this mixture of multiple input factors, the DCA generates a better result detection performance compared to the univariate approach (CUSUM, EWMA, and MA). Moreover, the experimental result for SARS outbreak detection also indicates a similar performance. Hence, the DCA indirectly improves on the CUSUM result. This can be clearly seen from in the results for both outbreak datasets where DCA and CUSUM generated a comparable DR; however, the DCA performs better than CUSUM in terms of FAR and SPS. This indicates that the multivariate approach offered by danger theory can increase outbreak detection performance.",

In the proposed model, a signal formalization approach based on CUSUM was formalized and a cumulative mature antigen contact value (cMCAV) was employed to suit the outbreak characteristic and danger theory. Based on experiments performed on two outbreak datasets, dengue and SARS, the proposed model was found to be more robust than other available models when dealing with inconsistent outbreak signals. Although there is no training phase involved, the danger theory-based outbreak detection model is able to handle new unknown outbreak patterns and can highly discriminate outbreak and non-outbreak cases with a consistent high DR, high SNS, and lower FAR. This can be seen in the case of the dengue outbreak dataset, where the proposed model produced significantly better results than CUSUM, EWMA, moving average, multilayer perceptron, and na\u00efve Bayes. Also, in the case of the SARS outbreak dataset, the proposed model produced a performance that was comparable to that of EWMA. Since danger theory is a multivariate approach, it offers a new alternative for outbreak detection that can deal with vague and inconsistent outbreak signals for different types of data. To further evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed model, further analysis will be conducted on different outbreak diseases, where the performance of the proposed model will be investigated when dealing with different outbreak shifts. The proposed outbreak detection model will also be extended as a real-time agent-based model.",
