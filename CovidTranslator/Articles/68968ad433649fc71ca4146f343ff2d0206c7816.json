This turn in part reflects the limited effectiveness of Beijing's much-increased hard power and its never-formidable and now-reduced soft power as means to achieve China's ends with the United States. China's political warfare and uses of sharp power pursue both direct influence on U.S. policy and indirect impact through affecting American attitudes toward China and China-related issues. China's efforts range across many sectors-including business, culture, media, education, and more-and they have prompted reactions and countermeasures. In China's view, the United States has long been engaged in something like political warfare or sharp power undertakings targeting China. If, or as, U.S.-China relations continue to become more adversarial, political warfare, uses of sharp power, and measures to counter them are likely to increase.",

            "text": "In the 1990s, China's appreciation of the importance of hard power deepened, with two events being particularly notable: the quick and overwhelming allied victory over Iraq during the first Gulf War; and the mixed outcome of the cross-Strait crisis spawned by missile tests that Beijing had launched to intimidate voters in Taiwan's first fully democratic presidential election and that prompted the dispatch of ships from the U.S. Navy's 7 th Fleet toward the Taiwan Strait. 3 Although the gap in military capacity between the United States and China has remained substantial, it is not the sole, or decisive, measure of U.S.-China hard power competition. The most plausible scenarios for U.S.-China military incidents and conflicts continue to be ones involving areas near China, which give China advantages in a limited conflict. China's military strategy has emphasized \"A2AD\"-anti-access/area denial-to limit the U.S. military's ability to act in areas adjacent to China. 4 At minimum, Washington no longer has a reliable option to intervene at a low cost to protect its own interests in open seas in the western reaches of the Indo-Pacific region, or the interests of U.S. allies and friends in East and Southeast Asia who are increasingly outmatched by China. This limited shift in relative power in China's favor can threaten the long-standing effectiveness of U.S. deterrence. U.S. defense planners increasingly have to reckon with a future in which China will have significant abilities to project force beyond, as well as within, the first island chain (which runs from Japan's home islands to the archipelagos of Southeast Asia, enclosing the South and East China Seas). 5 China's growing hard power has underpinned a more assertive approach to external relations or, at least, perceptions abroad that this is the case. Several decades into China's Reform Era, a much more prosperous and powerful China has come to see itself as resuming its rightful place as the preeminent regional power. General Secretary and President Xi Jinping has emphasized his regime's determination to achieve China's \"great national rejuvenation\" ( ) DELISLE and to make China a leading military and economic power by the middle of the twenty-first century. 6 Achievement of Xi's \"China Dream\" ( ) is significantly frustrated by the problem of China not having \"recovered\" Taiwan. Although Xi has not fundamentally changed Beijing's cross-Strait policy of tolerating the status quo for the time being (but with an ultimate goal of unification), he has insisted that the Taiwan issue will not be left over \"from generation to generation\" and that the formula for Taiwan's unification must be the \"one country, two systems\" model first implemented in Hong Kong. 7 His relatively conventional policy statements became more foreboding in the context of other signals from Beijing concerning hard power, such as: pointed reminders that Beijing has not foresworn the use of force to achieve unification; and stepped-up Chinese military activities near Taiwan (including increased patrols by navy ships and military aircraft to both the mainland and Pacific Ocean sides of Taiwan, and dispatches of fighter jets to the median line of the Strait). 8 Significant in its implications for Taiwan (and, especially, Taiwan's 2020 elections), the shadow of China's hard power loomed more urgently over Hong Kong's protracted protests in 2019, especially when Beijing appeared briefly to contemplate deploying People's Liberation Army (PLA) troops or the paramilitary People's Armed Police to quell the unrest. 9 China has used the increasingly formidable People's Liberation Army Navy (PLAN), and China Maritime Service (a rough analogy to a coast guard), as well as ostensibly civilian fishing boats, to press more forcefully its disputed claims to territorial sovereignty and maritime rights in the South and East China Seas. At the southern reaches of the South China Sea, the PRC undertook a massive project of building islands and military facilities. 10 Faced with a strikingly adverse decision 6 Xi Jinping, \"Secure a Decisive Victory in Building a Moderately Prosperous Society in All Respects and Strive for the Great Success of Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era,\" 19 th National Congress of the Communist Party of China, Oct. 18, 2017; and \"Speech Delivered by Xi Jinping at the First Session of the 13th NPC,\" China Daily, Mar. 21, 2018. 7 Xi Jinping, \"Speech at the Meeting Commemorating the 40 th Anniversary of the Message to Taiwan Compatriots: Working Together to Realize Rejuvenation of the Chinese Nation and Advance China's Peaceful Reunification,\" Jan. 2, 2019. 8 For overviews, see, \"China's Evolving Military Strategy against Taiwan,\" National Bureau of Asian Research, June 4, 2018, https://www.nbr.org/publication/chinasevolving-military-strategy-against-taiwan/; and Ben Blanchard and Yimou Lee, \"China Could Flex Military Muscles to Pressure Taiwan Post-Election,\" Reuters, Jan. 13, 2020, https://www.reuters.com/article/us-taiwan-election-analysis/china-could-flex-militarymuscles-to-pressure-taiwan-post-election-idUSKBN1ZC0LE. 9 Steven Lee Myers, \"China Hints Its Troops Could Be Used to Quell Hong Kong Protests,\" New York Times, July 24, 2019 (quoting Colonel Wu Qian); and \"Videos Show People's Armed Police Assembling in Shenzhen Apparently for Exercises,\" Global Times, Aug. 12, 2019 (tasks and missions of People's Armed Police include dealing with \"serious violent and illegal incidents, terrorist attacks and other social security incidents\"). 10 See, Andrew S. Erickson and Conor M. Kennedy, \"China's Island Builders: The People's War at Sea,\" Foreign Affairs, Apr. 9, 2015. Foreign Policy through Other Means: China's Turn to Political Warfare by an international arbitral tribunal in a case brought by the Philippines over South China Sea claims, Beijing pointedly dismissed the award as a mere \"scrap of paper.\" Despite Washington's general support for Manila's resort to arbitration and the U.S.'s strongly expressed interest in vindicating the liberal law of the sea principles that the tribunal upheld, the Philippines government largely abandoned the panel's sweeping award. This reticence reflected a sober appreciation of China's vastly superior hard power, including its then-recently-demonstrated ability to block Filipino access to disputed areas (although the change of presidents in Manila and China's economic leverage over the Philippines were significant factors as well). 11 China's hard power, and willingness to use it, at least in limited ways, was thus made clear to rival maritime claimants Japan, the Philippines, and Vietnam, and indirectly to others in the region.",

            "text": "Beijing's retrenched but resilient backing for North Korea, and its strident reaction to the U.S. deployment of the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) system in South Korea underscored the impact of China's hard power. South Korea acceded to Beijing's demands not to deploy additional anti-ballistic missile systems, join a U.S. regional defense system, or forge a closer U.S.-Japan-Korea military alliance. In the THAAD incident, as with the Philippines arbitration, China's hard power advantages were magnified by other influences: China's economic leverage over South Korea-as demonstrated by the harm inflicted on the mainland business of Lotte, the South Korean firm that provided land for the THAAD site-and the more accommodationist China and North Korea policy preferences of a new president in Seoul. 12 In addressing the most likely points of conflict or confrontation with the United States, China has sought to enhance its geographic advantages in the possible use of hard power by asserting an asymmetry of interests. In Beijing's framing, China has more vital interests at stake (reclaiming sovereignty over lost territory and protecting Chinese security in its very near-abroad) than does the United States (maintaining alliance structures and less formal partnerships, freedom of navigation, and a rules-based international order). 13 To the extent that 11 Against the backdrop of an inexorably deteriorating cross-Strait military balance, Taiwan perennially, although unevenly, worries that the United States will \"abandon Taiwan\" (a concern sometimes fed by arguments from U.S. policy intellectuals whose assessments reflect China's rising power) or that the United States will treat Taiwan as a \"bargaining chip\" (one that might be traded away to advance U.S. interests in bilateral relations with the PRC). 14 Although participants in the 2019 Hong Kong protests ardently appealed to the United States (as well as Hong Kong's former colonial ruler, the United Kingdom) for political support, there was no prospect that foreign hard power would be transformative, and the more realistic among the movement's participants (and outside observers) recognized that any ability London or Washington once had to influence Beijing on the treatment of Hong Kong had waned severely as China's strength and confidence have grown. 15 In the South China Sea arbitration with the Philippines, China reprised its familiar themes of sovereignty as a core interest (including for places long outside China's control) and applied them to reject the tribunal's authority. According to Beijing's critique, the panel could not decide the case without addressing the question of sovereignty over contested territory-an issue that lay beyond the competence of any United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) proceeding and that could not be the subject of an international dispute because the relevant areas were inalienably part of China's sovereign domain. More narrowly, Beijing declared that the tribunal lacked jurisdiction because the case involved questions of military affairs and policing powers-matters of national security that the PRC's reservations had placed beyond the reach of any UNCLOS dispute resolution process. When South Korea moved to deploy THAAD, China framed the action as a U.S. threat to China's national security and an instrument of Washington's anti-China strategic agenda. In these several ways, China's expanded hard power, and policies partly reflecting that power, have affected U.S. policies toward China and regional issues important to China. East and Southeast Asian states allied or aligned with the United States have become more wary of crossing China, partly because of the relative shift in hard power in China's favor. U.S. policies-some of them longstanding-have become less effective and, in some respects, possibly unviable.",

In a generally contentious relationship or specific regional disputes with the United States, Beijing's hard power still has only limited utility in steering Washington's choices. China's military still significantly lags that of the United States. The risk of escalation in a conflict among nuclear powers remains a potent mutual deterrent, and thus limits either side's ability to coerce. With China's economy still heavily (albeit decreasingly) dependent on trade, the dire economic consequences for China of war, confrontation short of war, or even a highly tense security relationship that spurs economic \"decoupling\" are prospects that constrain Beijing's ability to use its hard power to shape Washington's policies.",

By the 1990s, it had become commonplace to note China's considerable \"soft power\"-the ability to shape another state's policies and actions through attraction and persuasion. 25 Top leaders Hu Jintao and Xi Jinping both prominently identified soft power as a key resource to be developed and deployed in the service of China's foreign policy. 26 And the most important issue in China's foreign policy was relations with the United States-a bilateral relationship the preeminence of which prompted hyperbolic characterizations as the \"G2\" or \"Chimerica.\" 27 In a time of frustration with political and policy dysfunction in Washington, U.S. political commentators sometimes wrote-wistfully, admiringly, and occasionally ominously-of the Chinese regime's ability to make sensible, long-term policy commitments that served the national interest. 28 American and U.S.-based commentators began to talk of a China Model of development (for achieving rapid economic development with remarkable political stability), or a Beijing consensus (defined as a pragmatic and innovative approach to achieve equitable development with social cohesion and national autonomy, in pointed contrast to the widely criticized Washington Consensus that demanded painful Foreign Policy through Other Means: China's Turn to Political Warfare neoliberal reforms in hard-pressed developing countries), or a Chinese model of governance based on political meritocracy. 29 Surveying China's formidable efforts to build its image and influence around the world, one prominent assessment concluded that China was engaged in a potent soft power \"charm offensive\" with global reach, including in countries that had long and close relationships with the United States. 30 In the aftermath of the Global Financial Crisis of 2007-2008, China's international stature rose further with its inclusion as a key member of the G20 group of leading economies (expanded from the former developed-economydominated G8 and G7) that assembled to address the most severe worldwide economic setback since the Great Depression. China seemed to be taking on the hoped-for role of responsible pillar of the status quo international order.",

Prominent examples included Haier in appliances, and Lenovo in personal computers (gaining prominence when it acquired IBM's PC division). Before its image was defined by high-profile charges of intellectual property theft, evading U.S. sanctions on Iran, and potential creation of vulnerabilities in its products that could be used for PRC espionage, Huawei had been gaining a reputation as a highly competitive producer of telecommunications equipment for U.S. and global markets. 31 In other areas associated with soft power-such as culture, sports, and education-China's profile in the United States was broadening and deepening during much of the Reform Era. Movies by Zhang Yimou and other prominent PRC directors attracted unprecedented attention and acclaim for Chinese cinema from U.S. audiences and critics. 32 National Basketball Association (NBA) basketball star Yao Ming became a de facto soft power ambassador for China, 29 starring on the court and in endorsement ads for consumer products. 33 When Beijing won the right to host the 2008 Summer Olympics, it marked a significant recovery from the blow China's reputation had suffered in the United States after the 1989 Tiananmen Incident, which had doomed Beijing's bid to host the 2000 games. Anticipating-ultimately, incorrectly-that the Games would showcase to viewers in the U.S. and elsewhere a modern, impressive China, Chinese authorities tapped director Zhang Yimou to choreograph lavish opening ceremonies, and NBC broadcast the games replete with the coiner of the phrase \"Beijing Consensus.\". 34 Chinese media were expanding and becoming more visible in U.S. markets, presenting a generally positive view of China to, and for, U.S. audiences. Boxes with copies of China Daily began to appear on U.S. street corners. China Central Television's English-language channel began to be included in cable subscription packages of U.S. viewers. State and state-linked entities took out ads-sometimes full supplements-in U.S. newspapers.",

            "text": "Yet, by the middle to late 2010s, the situation had changed dramatically . The decline of China's soft power did not occur all at once or evenly across all dimensions, but its collapse was unmistakable in areas relevant to influencing U.S. policy. In sharp contrast to Clinton-era arguments seeking domestic support for China's World Trade Organization (WTO) accession, when Obama sought congressional and public backing for the TPP, he presented the trade pact in terms that drew a contrast between U.S.-style market liberalism and a rival Chinese paradigm. 39 A few years later, in a speech on the Trump administration's China policy that was much-noted in China, Vice President Mike Pence charged China with building its formidable economy \"at the expense of its competitorsespecially the United States\" and striving to \"win the commanding heights of the 21 st century economy . . . by any means necessary,\" including by targeting the \"foundation of our economic leadership.\" 40 Writings by policy intellectuals influential with presidential administrations, as well as some academics and journalists reflected, and reinforced, an increasingly negative assessment of China and a malign or threatening Chinese agenda. For an overview of the shift in views of China among policy elites, see, Jacques deLisle and Avery Goldstein, \"Rivalry and Security in a New Era for U.S.-China DELISLE China has behaved in ways that have undercut its soft power with the United States. The political component of Chinese soft power had always been weak, especially with audiences in countries that have broadly liberal and democratic values. Indeed, in the early discourse concerning a \"Chinese model,\" Chinese analysts and commentators had been wary of promoting, or even articulating, such a model, in part because they foresaw the limited international appeal of China's paradigm for politics and government. 42 During the Hu Jintao years, senior Chinese officials had rejected purportedly universal liberal and democratic values as unsuited to China. Under Xi Jinping, this argument sharpened and escalated, bringing more pointed and formal rebukes of \"so-called\" universal values and putting forth a more assertive view that a Chinese model held lessons for other countries. 43 In 2019 and early 2020, China's political image with many U.S. audiences took a further turn for the worse. The biggest, most politically salient stories out of China showed the regime at its most antithetical to American values: China's increased pressure and bullying of democratic Taiwan, including moves to isolate it internationally by poaching some of its few remaining diplomatic allies and narrowing access to international organizations, and efforts to influence Taiwan's democratic elections through manipulation of social media; Beijing's hard line policies toward the pro-democracy, pro-rule-of-law protests in Hong Kong, including the fleeting specter in mid-summer of forcible intervention reminiscent of the suppression of the student-led pro-democracy movement at Tiananmen in 1989; the detention of hundreds of thousands Muslim Uyghurs in Xinjiang amid a massive, radical program of forced cultural assimilation; and the apparent mishandling of the coronavirus, due at least in part to the pathologies of an authoritarian bureaucratic system that discouraged reporting, higher-level authorities' suppression of information, China's rejection of offers of foreign assistance, and Beijing's possible pressure on the World Health Organization (WHO) to portray China's response favorably.",

            "text": "In the United States, China's economic success was increasingly perceived as adverse to American interests. This view was acutely manifest in the rhetoric of the Trump campaign's attacks on Chinese economic policy and behavior and in the Trump administration's tariff-backed \"trade war,\" but it was also the focus of a striking bipartisan near-consensus in Washington policy circles that engagement had failed and that a tougher line was needed. In this view, China's gains had come through cheating on the rules of a liberal international economic order (including, most prominently, the WTO), and had been accrued at the expense of American jobs, prosperity, and leadership in technology. With China framed as a serious economic threat-as well as a rising geopolitical rival-Chinese soft power crumbled, and the narrative of a \"whole of society\" and \"whole of government\" conflict came to the fore in the United States. 44 From early on, official U.S. sources and other assessments were skeptical of Chinese assertions that AIIB and the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) were benign efforts to promote economic development internationally and to fill shortfalls left by existing institutions. In critical U.S. accounts, AIIB was a Chinese bid to create a rival institution to established multilateral development banks, but with lower standards on environment, anti-corruption, and other matters, as well as a greater opportunity for Chinese geopolitical influence. From this perspective, the broader BRI was a serious case of low, and corrosive, standards, and a tool for China's gaining political leverage, through debt and investment, over weaker states-a criticism that gained traction when several states canceled or renegotiated BRI deals and Beijing tried to rebrand the BRI in more benevolent terms. 45 The bloom was also off the rose for Chinese companies in the United States. In the most prominent example, Huawei was identified increasingly as a national security problem. The company and its affiliates were accused-including in a federal racketeering indictment-of evading U.S. restrictions on dealing with Iran and North Korea, and widespread and systematic theft of U.S. intellectual property. 46 At Washington's request, the company's chief financial officer-and the daughter of its founder-was arrested in Canada and detained for possible 44 See, for example, \"Confronting the China Threat: Director Wray Says Whole-of-Society Response is Needed to Protect U.S. Economic and National Security,\" Federal Bureau of Investigation, Feb. 6, 2020, https://www.fbi.gov/news/stories/wrayaddresses-china-threat-at-doj-conference-020620; \"Remarks by Vice President Pence on the Administration's Policy toward China\"; and Robert Sutter, \"Pushback: America's New China Strategy,\" The Diplomat, Nov. 2, 2018. 45 The U.S. government banned Huawei products from many government uses, and from the build-out of U.S. 5G networks because of concerns that Huawei might install backdoor means for the Chinese government to access U.S. information and control U.S. equipment, and, more generally, that Huawei would not refuse, or be able to refuse, the Chinese Party-state's demands for cooperation in possible moves to undermine U.S. national security. 47 More broadly, the United States government moved to tighten scrutiny of investment by Chinese companies in national security-sensitive sectors-defined capaciously and extending national economic security interests. Chinese entities faced tougher review by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) and amendments to the CFIUS process undertaken by the Foreign Investment Risk Review Modernization Act (FIRRMA) in 2018. 48 More mundane instances of Chinese firms' acquisitions of U.S. companies also reflected, and reinforced, China's deteriorating image and waning soft power. For example, when the Chinese company Shuanghui acquired Smithfield (a major U.S. pork producer), it spotlighted for American audiences China's chronic problems with food safety, and the sorry reputation at home of Chinese firms in the food sector. The acquisition was reported as a move by a Chinese company, facing worried consumers, to buy the U.S. company's reputation for safety. 49 In cultural matters, despite the promise of some earlier successes, Chinese movies failed to gain popularity with mainstream American audiences, and the soft power potential of Chinese films waned as a chillier political climate and tighter content restrictions took hold in the PRC's movie industry. 50 In the United States, Foreign Policy through Other Means: China's Turn to Political Warfare criticism began to mount that, rather than enriching cinematic offerings for American audiences, China was beginning to have an adverse effect on the content of one of the U.S.'s most distinctive and soft power-salient exports. Concerns grew that U.S. studios' focus on revenue from the PRC market were foregoing more varied and culturally valuable fare in favor of action movie franchises that did not face language or cultural barriers, or blocking by Chinese censors. 51 By the late 2000s and 2010s, the most iconic Chinese cultural figure for many Americans was the dissident and later exiled multi-media artist Ai Weiwei, whose fame abroad grew with his role in investigating the deaths of schoolchildren due to substandard classroom buildings in the 2008 Sichuan earthquake, and his enduring the Chinese regime's abuse, persecution, and suppression (including beatings, destruction of his studio, banning from exhibitions, prosecution on questionable tax charges, and incarceration). 52 Sports, too, was an area where China's soft power fell with U.S. audiences. Coverage of the Chinese women's gymnastics team's Olympic success after 2008 focused on evidence that China was breaking rules, as far back as 2000, for the protection of young athletes that prohibited competitors under the age of 16. 53 In 2019, the principal \"China story\" for the NBA was an ugly political one concerning China's reaction to a tweet supporting the pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong by an official of the Houston Rockets-ironically, Yao Ming's former team.",

At a more structural level, China's soft power failure in the United States surely also reflects-perhaps ironically-the rise of China's hard power. As China has narrowed the gap with the United States in military and economic prowess, the United States predictably has responded to China's new capabilities-all the more so because China also has appeared to embrace a more assertive and adverse international agenda. A negative view of China has resonated with the American public, surely in part because of increasingly critical depictions of China by government officials, politicians, and expert commentators.",

Sharp power or political warfare has offered a different, and in some respects more promising, set of resources. The scope of sharp power or political warfare is imprecise, lying somewhere between hard power and soft power, and between warfare (Clausewitz's continuation of politics with other means) and more ordinary politics among nations (conducted through diplomacy, foreign policy, economic statecraft, and the like). Political warfare and sharp power generally seek to pressure and subvert, rather than coerce 54 Elizabeth Redden, \"Closing Confucius Institutes,\" Inside Higher Ed, Jan. 9, 2019; and Rachel Peterson, \"Confucius Institutes in the US that are Closing,\" National Association of Scholars, June 2019, https://www.nas.org/storage/app/media/Reports/ Outsourced%20to%20China/confucius-institutes-that-closed-updated-june-3-2019.pdf. 55 Foreign Policy through Other Means: China's Turn to Political Warfare or persuade. The methods often-although not always-involve some degree of subterfuge, illicit means, avoidance of attribution, and the like. 56 So defined, political warfare or sharp power would seem to make sense for China in targeting the United States, and not simply because it is better than the flawed alternatives. Although it is usually easy and often misleading to point to approaches and behaviors as part of a cultural or political-cultural repertoire, there is much in political warfare generally, and China's contemporary practice of it, that resonates with long-standing and recent Chinese thinking. Many of the most cited passages from the ancient Chinese military thinker Sun Zi could serve as subheadings for a catalogue (including the abridged one in this article) of recent instances of China's U.S.-targeting acts of political warfare or uses of soft power: the art of war is to subdue the enemy without fighting; in war, avoid what is strong and strike at what is weak; let your plans be dark and impenetrable; all warfare is based on deception; the opportunity to defeat the enemy is provided by the enemy himself; in chaos there is opportunity; and so on. 57 Since its early days, the Chinese Communist Party has emphasized \"united front work,\" which relies heavily on methods that are in the toolkit of what is now called political warfare. 58 Since the early 2000s, the PLA has held as one of its principal doctrines \"the three warfares\" ( ): psychological warfare ( ), public opinion warfare ( ), and legal warfare ( )-at least the first two of which (and arguably all of which) are elements of political warfare and sharp power. 59 Where Hu Jintao and Xi Jinping had spoken of China's need to develop soft power, Xi also has revived the importance of united front work, which he has characterized as a \"magic weapon\" ( ) and which encompasses political warfare DELISLE and sharp power tactics of cultivating political influence with-and overpoliticians, media, educational institutions, and publics abroad. 60 Political warfare also has the advantage of targeting now-evident vulnerabilities in the United States: strong free speech norms and rules in traditional and social media, academia, and public discourse more generally; large and prominent businesses with significant economic interests in China (and elsewhere abroad); and highly partisan and polarized politics.",

When a Houston Rockets official tweeted, \"Fight for freedom. Stand with Hong Kong,\" the league foresaw risks to its lucrative operations and its long-cultivated popularity in China. The fateful tweet was DELISLE followed by: a social media backlash from China's netizens, implicitly supported by the regime; announcements by the China Basketball Association (nominally headed by Yao Ming) that it would no longer cooperate with the NBA and by China Central Television that airing of NBA games would be suspended; statements largely accommodating China's sensibilities from the team (stating that the author of the tweet \"has made it clear that his tweet does not represent the Rockets or the NBA\"), from the league (calling the tweet \"regrettable\" and declaring the NBA's \"great respect for the history and culture of China and hope that . . . the NBA can be used as a unifying force,\" and offering a more solicitous apology on the Chinese version of its website), and from one of the NBA's biggest stars (LeBron James, saying \"I believe [the tweeter] just wasn't educated on the situation\" in which \"so many people could have been harmed, not only financially\"). 65 The reaction from U.S. politicians, critics, and audiences to the NBA's initial succumbing to Chinese pressure was swift, severe, and focused on issues related to political warfare or sharp power. The league faced withering charges of abandoning American values of free speech-the same values for which the Hong Kong protesters were courageously fighting-to curry favor with an authoritarian regime in pursuit of financial gain. In the view of some especially pointed critiques, the NBA incident involved an even more troubling form of Chinese interference in U.S. political discourse. Senator Marco Rubio complained on Twitter, \"Disgusting\u2026They allow #China punish a U.S. citizen for free speech in order to protect NBA's market access in China.\" Senator Charles Schumer added, \"No one should implement a gag rule on Americans speaking out for freedom.\" Media commentary was similarly unsparing. 66 On this reading, pressure or feared consequences from China had moved an iconic American organization to be willing to silence (or at least burden significantly) the political speech of American citizens working for an American entity in the United States. The NBA soon backpedaled, defending its commitment \"as an American-based\" league Foreign Policy through Other Means: China's Turn to Political Warfare \"operating globally\" to freedom of expression values, and indicating its willingness to bear significant financial consequences for doing so. 67 Analogous worries about the impact that Chinese influence and pressure of the content of ideas reaching, and shaping, the American public's views reached into other areas of entertainment and culture. Disquiet about Hollywood's tailoring its offerings to censored Chinese markets expanded to include concerns about how China's political strictures were affecting what U.S. audiences would see on issues that Beijing regards as politically sensitive (and that are issues in the U.S.'s China policy). Reports and rumors grew that studios' hunger for Chinese box office and, increasingly, investment from Chinese sources and opportunities to shoot mainstream U.S. movies in Chinese locations was leading to selfcensorship and the foregoing of content, or actors, that Chinese authorities considered politically unacceptable. China's growing impact portended fewer movies, or movies with more China-favorable or China-flattering content, about such subjects as Tibet (which had been a focus of several films offensive to official PRC views through the 1990s), or Xinjiang (which was becoming an issue of greater concern to the U.S. public), or China more generally. The controversial eleventh-hour switch from Chinese to North Korean forces as fictional invaders and occupiers of the United States in the 2012 remake of Red Dawn, reportedly in deference to PRC concerns, looked to some like an extreme example of wider insidious effects. 68 The rebranded U.S. arm of CCTV, China Global Television Network (CGTN), was required to register as an agent of a foreign government. This dubious honor-shared with the notoriously propagandistic Russia Televisionindicated the extent to which U.S. authorities had re-envisioned China as a potentially hostile rival great power, and state-linked Chinese media as a source of problematic content targeting American audiences.

Much of the impetus behind the wave of CI closures was a growing and deepening view among U.S. universities, their constituencies, the U.S. government, and observers that CIs were shaping (or at least might shape) Americans' views of Chinathrough blocking or creating content-in directions dictated by their overseers at 70 71 The U.S. government has taken or considered steps to restrict participation by universities with CIs in government-funded programming that supports Chinese studies. 72 Pressure in the United States to limit channels for possible Chinese influence on U.S. China policy and U.S. politics through university-centered activities have gone further and spread more widely. Political discourse and policy arguments about the academic sector partly paralleled the controversies concerning U.S. businesses. Reports and calls for action focused on several overlapping issues of Chinese influence on the content of teaching, research, and discussion of China-related issues. Examples included efforts-some purportedly successful-by Confucius Institutes, PRC embassy and consular personnel, and Chinese students on U.S. campuses to prevent events-or to quash content critical of the PRC-on \"sensitive\" issues, such as Tibet, Taiwan, or the Hong Kong protests. Other often-cited concerns were possible acquiescence of university administrations to Chinese demands in the face of imposed or threatened retaliation that would downgrade the extensive collaborative programs with Chinese partners and Chinese branch campuses that many U.S. schools had established, and self-censorship by U.S. scholars specializing in China who feared potentially career-killing loss of access to research opportunities in China. 73 A notable survey of U.S. China scholars found that two-thirds believed that selfcensorship-specifically in the context of making public statements on policy issues-was a problem in the field. 74 A similar concern underlay mounting Foreign Policy through Other Means: China's Turn to Political Warfare sharp power (such as Taiwan's fate, Hong Kong's pro-democracy protests, Uyghurs' subjection to repression in Xinjiang, and so on). 77 But, overall, the academic pushback has been sporadic and muted, partly out of concern that stronger measures would be seen, or portrayed, as tainted by universities' concern with parochial and financial interests in relationships with China, or the result of their being na\u00efve about China, or insufficiently attentive to national security and national economic security concerns. The February 2020 announcement that the Department of Education was investigating Harvard, Yale, and possibly other elite schools over unreported funding from China is likely to chill further university-based challenges to government restrictions. 78 U.S. unease about Chinese businesses' operations has moved beyond long-standing concerns about acquisition of national security-sensitive technology, commercial espionage, or unfair economic competition. The focus has extended to more indirect mechanisms of influence through information and ideas. The U.S. moves to restrict Huawei and calls to investigate or limit TikTok and WeChat in part reflected broader concerns that ostensibly private Chinese firms operating in the United States were in league with the Chinese regime or at least could not, or would not, resist its directives. For critics in the U.S. government and beyond, these companies' perceived links, or subservience, to Chinese authorities raised the prospect that their products and platforms could be used, among other things, to garner information that could be weaponized in political warfare directed at U.S. targets, including social media-based, Russian-style election interference operations. 79 More straightforwardly, Chinese investment in cultural content industries already has faced scrutiny-as in the case of Wanda's acquisition of ownership stakes in U.S. movie theaters and studios. 80 Although such instances remain DELISLE anomalous, and reflect exaggerated or as yet unproven concerns, the suspicion in the United States is telling, and it is not hard to imagine more serious variations on the theme in the context of a generally more mistrustful U.S.-China relationship.",

More recently, these assessments have added an ideational dimension, with the BRI viewed as a means to promote a Chinese model (despite its lack of soft power appeal) and with the U.S.'s BUILD Act framed as a policy response to the BRI that would promote U.S. values of transparency and legality and that is tied to Washington's selfconsciously political-system-type-based \"Free and Open Indo-Pacific\" strategy. 81",

Characterized as using diplomatic, economic, military, political, legal, and cultural means \"to achieve American objectives and to build American influence,\" smart power implied a policy-driven version of using formerly soft power channels of influence to affect Chinese politics and PRC policies. 87 From the PRC's perspective, potential battlefields for political warfare or deployment of sharp power long have been tilted in the U.S.'s favor. Seen from this angle, the Chinese agendas and behaviors that have been prompting so much concern and such strong reaction in the United States are (merely) part of an attempt to level the playing field. Indeed, some Chinese reactions to U.S. measures have seemed to illustrate the maxim that imitation is the sincerest form of flattery. Examples include: adoption of CFIUS-like laws for national security review of inbound investment; 88 policy initiatives, especially in telecommunications and related sectors, to reduce dependence on U.S. technology and the vulnerabilities to both hacking and economic coercion that such dependence creates-an approach that had special resonance as the U.S. moved to ban Huawei and, in China's view, impede China's global rise as a tech power; 89 re-tightening censorship and strengthening other barriers to prevent information critical of the regime from reaching Chinese audiences through traditional foreign media, their online presences, and social media; 90 and increasing visa and access denials for U.S. Foreign Policy through Other Means: China's Turn to Political Warfare scholars (including those directly or indirectly influential with the U.S.'s China policymakers). 91",

In the United States, rapidly rising concerns about Chinese influence efforts have focused more on risks or potential risks, and less on effects thus far demonstrably achieved. But the mechanisms of sharp power and the methods of political warfare surely will be used more aggressively if the deteriorating relationship between the United States and China becomes a new cold war, which some observers foresee or already discern. 92 There have been assertions-mostly fragmentary and polemical-that Beijing already has greatly escalated political warfare and exercises of sharp power against the United States by taking pages from the Russian playbook. For example, President Trump and Vice President Pence have asserted that China was \"attempting to interfere\" in the 2018 midterm elections, even as Trump flippantly invited Chinese hacking to aid his 2020 reelection bid. 93 There is much more substantial evidence that China has made use of such higher-impact political warfare and sharp power in other contexts-principally Hong Kong and Taiwan.",

The Trump administration has greatly increased visa scrutiny, delays, and cancellations for Chinese students and scholars, and reportedly contemplated a full-fledged student visa ban.
