Emerging infections can be defined as ''infections that have newly appeared in a population or have existed previously but are rapidly increasing in incidence or geographic range.'' Several factors like increase in international travel and trade, human encroachment on wild-life habitats, changes in agricultural practices and wild-life trade have contributed to the emergence of pathogens. Emergence/ re-emergence of several viral infections has been reported from India in the past few decades; some of the important emerging viral infections are discussed in this review. They include infection due to Nipah, Hantaviruses, Chikungunya, Human Enterovirus-71, Influenza, Chandipura, Crimean Congo, SARS Coronavirus, Buffalopox, Dengue and Japanese Encephalitis viruses. Creating increased awareness and training of clinical microbiologists/virologists for identification of new/emerging pathogens, and prompt reporting and management of outbreaks is essential to tackle the threat posed by emerging/re-emerging infections.",

This was the remark, made in 1967, by the then US Surgeon General William H. Stewart, buoyed up by the accelerating pace of scientific and technological progress, and the conquest of infectious diseases accomplished by use of ''miracle drugs''-antibiotics, and vaccines. To write about infectious diseases, in 1962, said Macfarlane Burnet, Australian virologist and Nobel laureate ''is almost to write of something that has passed into history.'' This over-optimism was soon shattered by the recognition of a new disease of infectious origin in 1981-AIDS, which remains the global killer today, threatening to outdo the Black Death of the fourteenth century and the Spanish Flu pandemic of 1918 which killed at least 50 million people, each. Indeed, despite an elaborate armamentarium to tackle infectious bugs, the continual evolution of emerging and re-emerging diseases, due to the astonishingly diverse microbial world and its adaptive capacity will remain a crucial global challenge in the twenty-first century.",

[1] Emerging infections can be further classified as 'newly emerging', 're-emerging/resurging' or 'deliberately emerging', since the underlying causes of emergence and preventive strategies differ between these groups. Newly emerging infections are those that have not previously been recognized in man. Re-emerging and resurging infections are those that existed in the past but are now rapidly increasing in incidence or in geographical or human host range. Deliberately emerging infections are infections due to microbes (naturally occurring or bioengineered), deliberately introduced by man, usually for nefarious use [2] .",

Other aspects of modern human behaviour contribute to the emergence of novel infectious diseases, e.g., water shortage, leading to increased usage of open containers for water storage, creates a breeding ground for mosquito vectors (Dengue), social practices like tattooing in tribal areas in India (HBV, HCV and other blood borne viruses), rural urbanization, sexual behaviour (HIV), needle sharing among IV drug abusers (HIV, HCV), use of contaminated blood/tissue products (HIV, HBV, HCV, vCJD), contaminated vaccines (polio vaccines contaminated with SV40-linked to increased risk of non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma). Immune deficiency associated with AIDS, and advanced medical care including cancer chemotherapy and organ transplantation, has contributed to an enormous increase in an immunocompromised population world-wide. 'Opportunistic re-emerging Infections' are frequently seen in such individuals due to reactivation of latent viruses or unrestrained replication of endogenous viruses, leading to enhanced virulence or changes in host or tissue tropism (CMV, EBV, HHV-6, Parvovirus B-19, JC, BK etc.) [2, 7] .",

Emergence of drug-resistant microbes by natural selection confers an added advantage to them. The molecular evolution of Chikungunya virus (CHIKV, A226V mutation in glycoprotein envelope gene) leading to a higher efficiency of replication and dissemination in the vector species Aedes albopictus, is reported to have contributed to resurgence of Chikungunya fever (CHIK) in Kerala state in 2007 [8] .",

[9] Deforestation, expansion of human habitat and mining activities have been suggested as risk factors associated with re-emergence of vampire bat rabies in the Amazon basin [10] . The dramatic increase of human cases of Kyasanur Forest Disease (KFD), a tick-borne flavivirus in south west India in 1983 can be attributed to deforestation and agricultural development, which increased exposure of humans to the virus and the vector (ticks). Usage of cleared areas in the forest for cattle grazing favoured the proliferation of the ticks (Haemaphysalis spinigera) which prefer to feed on bigger animals, including humans [11] .",

A large pig population is conducive for outbreaks of JE, while a large cattle population may support mosquito feeding, but act as dampeners for spread of JE, since viraemia is not present [7] . The worst affected districts in Kerala during the 2007 Chikungunya outbreak, Kottayam and Pathanamthitta, are hilly and heavily forested, with vast rubber plantations.

The rapid economic growth in southern China leading to an increasing demand for animal proteins including those from exotic game food animals such as civets, and many varieties of these wild game mammals in overcrowded cages in wet markets allowed the jumping of the novel SARS coronavirus from animals to human [14] .

Beginning in September 1998 a major outbreak of disease in pigs and human beings appeared in the northern part of peninsular Malaysia, resulting in 265 infected individuals and 105 deaths, most of whom were farmers or abattoir workers who had come in close contact with infected pigs [15] . Surprisingly, while respiratory symptoms predominated in pigs, infected humans presented mostly with encephalitic symptoms. In March 1999, a novel paramyxovirus was isolated from the CSF of an encephalitic patient from Sungai Nipah village. This virus which was later named as the Nipah virus was found to be closely related to Hendra virus, another paramyxovirus, identified in 1994, which caused severe respiratory illness in horses and humans in Australia [15] [16] [17] . These two geographically remote, yet phylogenetically close viruses were classified into a new genus-Henipavirus [18, 19] . Fruit bats belonging to the genus Pteropus were identified as the natural hosts for Nipah virus, while pigs were considered the intermediary hosts. The most likely explanation for introduction of the virus into pigs appears to be related to the practice of growing fruit orchards near piggeries to allow efficient use of pig waste as fertilizer for the trees. With some trees overhanging the pig-pens, it is likely that pigs were exposed to virus laden excreta and masticated fruit pellets dropped from feeding fruit bats also called as flying foxes, who are symptomless carriers of the virus [15] . Pigs infected with the virus showed less mortality; however, due to their predominant respiratory involvement, they spread the infection to humans in close contact.",

A similar outbreak which was retrospectively identified to be due to Nipah virus was reported in 2001 from Siliguri, West Bengal, not far from Bangladesh. All of the patients were residents of Siliguri and the outbreak occurred among hospitalized patients, family contacts of the patients, and medical staff of 4 hospitals. Sixty-six cases of encephalitis were identified, and the case-fatality ratio was 74%. Analysis of the limited sequence data suggested that the Nipah virus strains associated with the outbreak were more closely related to the virus isolated in Bangladesh than to the virus isolated in Malaysia, suggesting that viruses circulating in different areas have unique genetic signatures and may have co-evolved within local natural reservoirs [21] .",

As the population of rodents, especially deer mice (Peromyscus maniculatus) exploded and they sought food and shelter in human dwellings, people were exposed to the aerosolized animal droppings, urine and saliva, which lead to the infection [29] .

Twenty-six suspected cases were investigated for the aetiological agent in another outbreak of encephalitis that affected children in tribal areas of Gujarat state in western India in 2004, with a case fatality rate of 78.3%. Demonstration of Chandipura viral RNA in 9 (45%) of 20 cases, IgM antibodies in 3 (15%), and isolation of the virus from one patient provided strong evidence for Chandipura virus as the aetiologic agent of the encephalitis outbreak. The virus sequences from the outbreak were closely related to prototype strain (1965) and isolates from the Andhra Pradesh, outbreak in 2003 [67] . Outbreaks of encephalitis due to Chandipura virus were reported in 2003 and 2005 from Maharashtra [68, 69] and in an hospital based surveillance of acute encephalitis among children from North Telangana in Andhra Pradesh [70] . Chandipura virus was confirmed as an aetiological agent of an acute encephalitis syndrome (AES) outbreak among children from Nagpur division in 2007, with a case fatality ratio of 43.6% [71] .",

About 10-20% of the patients may develop acute respiratory distress requiring intubation and mechanical ventilation. Laboratory testing requires a biosafety level 3 facility. A positive viral culture from respiratory, faecal, and, occasionally, urine or tissue specimens or a fourfold rise in the neutralizing antibody titer in paired serum samples is the most definitive evidence of infection. Rapid detection by nucleic acid amplification such as RT-PCR or antigen detection by EIA is the alternative [86] .",

Buffalopox virus is a member of the Orthopoxvirus, and is closely related to Vaccinia virus. Human beings, including smallpox-vaccines contract infection upon close contact with infected animals, but the extent of disease is greater in non-immunized individuals. Milking of affected animals is one of the major modes of spread; human to human transmission has not been reported. Milkers develop pox-like lesions on the shin of their fingers, arms, fore-head and face associated with fever and axillary lymphadenitis. Regular monitoring of buffalopox outbreaks in India in animals and humans is essential to curb economic losses as well as to reduce public health impact of the disease [90] .",

The disease has changed its course manifesting in the severe form as DHF and with increasing frequency of outbreaks, with all four Dengue serotypes cocirculating and the predominant serotypes ever changing [96] [97] [98] . These severe complications are thought to occur as a result of evolution of the Dengue virus to escape high population immunity manifesting as increased viral virulence and human immunopathogenesis due to antibodydependent enhancement of viral infection [99] . The resurgence of Dengue can be linked to urbanization and unprecedented population growth, increased density of the mosquito vector, reinfestation with Aedes aegypti of a new geographical area, warm and humid climate, water storage pattern in houses, storage of junk in open spaces, including tyres, coconut shells etc. that trap rain water, introduction of new serotype of the virus, lack of effective mosquito control and to the enormous increase in the international transport of people and commodities [100, 101] . Since vaccines or antiviral drugs are not available for Dengue viruses, the only effective way to prevent epidemic DF/ DHF is to control the mosquito vector, Aedes aegypti and prevent its bite [101] .",

The emergence of new variants/strains of Noroviruses, causative agents of acute gastroenteritis has been described in various studies from India [110, 111] . Human bocavirus, a new human parvovirus identified in children with respiratory tract disease in 2005, has been reported from India as well [112] . Red Baby Syndrome, a new disease characterised by abrupt onset of high fever and generalized erythema involving the entire skin, seen in infants and young children associated with human parvovirus B-19 infection was recently reported from India [113] .",

The Union Ministry of Health and Family Welfare launched an Integrated Disease Surveillance Project (IDSP) in 2004 to connect all district hospitals and state-run medical colleges to facilitate tele-education, training of health professionals and monitoring of disease trends. The project is implemented through the Central Surveillance Unit within the National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) at New Delhi and aims to detect early warning signals of impending disease outbreaks and initiate effective and rapid health actions with the help of information and communication technology at the district, state and national levels. In addition to monitoring diseases like vector borne infections, diarrhoeal diseases, respiratory diseases, and vaccine preventable diseases, the IDSP also has a category called 'unusual clinical syndromes,' which would alert public health professionals to an intentional release of any biological-agent [114] .",

Some laboratories geared their capacity by training manpower to carry out confirmation of index cases and test large number of samples. This activity may have helped build capacity of several state level laboratories to tackle similar emergencies, though, lessons learnt from managing one outbreak may not always suffice for another, as the agent, mode of transmission and susceptible population may differ. Two main factors for containment of an outbreak are isolation and contact tracing [115] . There is a need to move from conventional time consuming laboratory techniques to molecular technologies with rapid and sensitive detection capabilities and increased throughput for responding to the threats posed by emerging and re-emerging viruses in the recent past [115, 116] . There is also a need to create awareness among clinical microbiologists/virologists about existing outbreak reporting systems, laboratories designated for handling and processing samples for outbreak management, and for training and development of skills for testing and identifying new and emerging pathogens [115] .",
