However, cell culture may still have added value in identifying viruses not detected by PCR. Objectives: We aimed to estimate the yield and clinical impact of routine respiratory virus culture among children with a negative PCR result. Study design: A retrospective cohort study was performed from Jan. 2013 to Sept. 2015. Respiratory samples from hospitalized or immunocompromised patients < 18 years old were routinely inoculated on traditional tube cell culture monolayers if they tested negative by a PCR assay for 12 respiratory viruses. We studied patients with a respiratory specimen negative by PCR and positive by culture. Duplicates and samples of sold services were excluded. Data on demographics, clinical history, laboratory findings, and patient management were collected from patients' charts. Descriptive and multivariate statistics were performed. Results: Overall, 4638 PCR-negative samples were inoculated in cell culture. Of those, 196 (4.2%) were cell culture positive, and 144 met study inclusion criteria. Most subjects (81.9%) were hospitalized. Mean age was 2.4 \u00b1 3.4 years. The viruses most frequently isolated were cytomegalovirus (33.3%) and enteroviruses (19.4%). Cell culture results prompted a change in management in 5 patients (3.5%), all of whom had acyclovir initiated for localized HSV-1 infection. Four of these had skin or mucosal lesions that could be sampled to establish a diagnosis. Conclusion: In children, routine viral culture on respiratory specimens that were negative by PCR has low yield and minimal clinical impact.",

The diagnosis is confirmed by identification of a respiratory virus in a respiratory specimen [2] . Traditional diagnostic methods include viral isolation by cell culture and detection of viral antigens by immunofluorescence. The superior sensitivity of molecular methods such as reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) has led to their increased use in clinical laboratories [3, 4] . Still, some authors suggest performing viral culture in a backup role in respiratory specimens from high-risk populations to detect viruses that are not part of the RT-PCR assay or whose genomes have mutations that may lead to false-negative RT-PCR results [5, 6] . However, the implementation of a second diagnostic step, i.e., viral culture after a negative RT-PCR result, is associated with additional costs and unknown effect on clinical management.",

A major drawback of traditional tube cell cultures is the long turnaround time, which can take between 2 days to 2 weeks to produce a result. For this reason, the clinical usefulness of the technique is guarded as the result may arrive too late to impact physician decision making [12] . In our study, only patients with HSV infection had their management changed due to viral culture. This could be explained in part by the shorter time to positivity for HSV and the availability of specific antiviral treatment (acyclovir). Another limitation of viral culture is that some respiratory viruses, e.g., group C rhinovirus, some group A coxackieviruses, coronaviruses, and polyomaviruses KIV and WUV, neither replicate nor produce identifiable cytopathic effect in standard cell culture lines [13] [14] [15] .",

In those three patients without microbiological evidence of bacterial meningitis, one can infer that the likely cause of the aseptic meningitis was enterovirus.",

This single-center study is limited by its retrospective nature; changes in patient management associated with viral culture results may not have been well documented in medical charts. Moreover, our findings may not be applicable to shell vial methods, which have a more rapid turnaround time compared to traditional culture techniques [18] . Nevertheless, over nearly three years, we observed that routine traditional viral cell culture on specimens negative by multiplex PCR had very low yield and minimal clinical impact in the pediatric population. Our findings can aid microbiology labs to optimize the utilization of respiratory virus testing. We have since modified our laboratory practice to restrict cell culture to respiratory specimens from high-risk immunocompromised children or upon special request.",
