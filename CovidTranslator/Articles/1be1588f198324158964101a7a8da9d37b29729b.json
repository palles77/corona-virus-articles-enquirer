On physical examination, the body weight was 6.4 kg (body condition score: 2/5), and visible mucous membranes were slightly pale. A complete blood cell count measured with a multiple automated haematology analyser (pocH-100iV diff; Sysmex, Hyogo, Japan) revealed non-regenerative anaemia and thrombocytopenia (Table 1) . On a peripheral blood smear, plasmacytosis (2% of blood leukocytes) and mild rouleaux were noted. The blood chemical profile measured with an automated biochemical analyser (Dri-Chem 7000 V; FUJIFILM, Tokyo, Japan) indicated hyperproteinaemia, increases in alanine aminotransaminase and alkaline phosphatase activity, and increased blood urea nitrogen (Table 1) . Serum free T 4 level measured by an automatic immunoassay analyser (IMX system; Abbott Diagnostics, North Chicago, IL) was below the reference interval at 0.88 ng/dl; (reference interval 9 1e2.5 ng/dl) which supports the effects of other illness on thyroid levels. Tests for feline leukaemia virus antigen and feline immunodeficiency virus antibody were both negative (Snap FeLV/ FIV Combo Test: Idexx, Westbrook, ME). A test for serum antibody directed to feline coronavirus was also negative (Marupi Lifetec, Osaka, Japan).",

In order to stabilise the patient before general anaesthesia and bone marrow aspiration, a whole blood transfusion was carried out on days 17 and 18. The bone marrow aspirate obtained on day 18 revealed hypercellularity with proliferation of atypical plasma cells (50.4% of all nucleated cells) and a relative decrease in the numbers of erythroid and myeloid cells ( Table 2 , Fig 1C and D) . The plasma cells in the bone marrow showed marked anisocytosis, marked anisokaryosis, and occasional bi-nucleation. These cells were similar in appearance to the plasmablasts described by Mellor et al 12 possessing an eccentric round to pleomorphic nucleus with a fine chromatin pattern, one to several nucleoli, and moderately basophilic cytoplasm containing fine azurophilic granules ( Fig 1D) . Serum protein electrophoresis revealed M-protein in the g-globulin fraction which accounted for 34.8% (3.8 g/ dl) of the total protein concentration (10.8 g/dl) ( Fig  2) . Bence-Jones protein was shown to be present in the urine by a heat precipitation method. From these findings, the cat was diagnosed to have MRD.",

Although the number of circulating plasma cells slightly decreased, there was a progression of pancytopenia; therefore, melphalan was discontinued. Thereafter, the cat was treated with prednisolone and recombinant human granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (Neutrogin; Chugai Pharmaceutical, 5 mg/kg, SC, on days 29 and 38) in addition to the intermittent whole blood transfusions (40e45 ml, nine times, from day 36 to day 65). An increase in the atypical plasma cells in the peripheral blood (1330/ml, 35% of blood leukocytes) ( Table 1 ) was observed on day 36. On day 38, atypical plasma cells with villous cytoplasmic projections were observed in the peripheral blood ( Fig 1B) . On day 52, elevated blood urea nitrogen (284.5 mg/dl) and creatinine (9.9 mg/dl) concentrations were found, and the cat showed appendicular oedema. Chemotherapy with chlorambucil (Leukeran; GlaxoSmithKline, 3 mg/m 2 , PO, q24 h) was started from day 58; however, an increase of large-sized atypical plasma cells was noted in the peripheral blood on day 64 (2340/ml, 30% of blood leukocytes) ( Table 1) . On day 66, in addition to the persistent thrombocytopenia, prolonged activated partial thromboplastin time (61.6 s, reference interval 21e45 s) and elevated concentration of fibrin/fibrinogen degradation product (5 mg/ml, reference interval <2.5 mg/ml) were noted, supporting the development of disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). The cat developed epistaxis and melaena, and died 71 days after the initial presentation. An autopsy revealed generalised subcutaneous oedema with pleural effusion and ascites (approximately 500 ml). The lung was diffusely congested and oedematous. The spleen and liver were diffusely enlarged, and there were multifocal haemorrhagic foci on their surfaces. There was no mass lesion in the spleen. Lymph nodes were grossly unremarkable. An impression smear of the bone marrow showed marked proliferation of atypical plasma cells (79% of all nucleated cells) and decreases in the number of the normal erythroid, myeloid, and megakaryocytic cells ( Table 2) . On the impression smear of the spleen, a large number of atypical plasma cells were also noted.",

In the spleen, the normal structures were almost completely replaced by a diffuse proliferation of plasma cells, accompanied by minimal extramedullary haematopoiesis (Fig 3B) . The neoplastic foci were scattered throughout in the liver. The neoplastic plasma cells infiltrated into the hepatic central vein, sinusoid, and parenchyma, altering the normal architectures. The neoplastic plasma cells were also observed in the vessels of the visceral organs including heart, lung, kidney, intestine, pancreas, urinary bladder, and thyroid gland; however, there was no parenchymal infiltration of the neoplastic plasma cells in these organs. In both kidneys, glomerular mesangial cell proliferation and dilated medullary tubules containing proteinaceous casts were observed.

For detection of Ig light chain, a direct immunochemistry using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antifeline Ig light chain (k and l) (Bethyl Laboratories) was carried out. For the negative control, Trisbuffered saline was applied to the tissue sections instead of primary antibodies for immunohistochemistry. Most of the neoplastic cells in the bone marrow were negative for IgG, IgM, and IgA, but 5e10% of these neoplastic cells were positive for Ig light chain (Fig 3C) .

This is consistent with a previous case report where the cat succumbed within 3.5 months and was also treated with multiple combined chemotherapy regimes. The classification scheme by Mellor et al 12 defines a high proportion of plasmablasts as consistent with poorly differentiated MRD with short survival times (median 14 days). In the case described in this study, most of the neoplastic plasma cells corresponded to plasmablasts, therefore, the cat could be diagnosed with poorly differentiated MRD according to the categorisation system. 12 Moreover, a feline case having MRD with significant plasmacytosis previously reported 13 was treated with prednisolone, melphalan, doxorubicin, Serum protein electrophoretogram on day 18. The narrow spike is noted in the g-globulin region. The total serum protein concentration was 10.8 g/dl.
