At the Hubei Cancer Hospital, the only hospital in Wuhan that specializes in oncology, we organized an emergency infection control team to lead special efforts to combat COVID-19 during this challenging time. Under its lead, the following measures were implemented in the radiation oncology department: the radiotherapy clinic was divided into different infection control zones with varying levels of protection; special staff and patient infection control training sessions were conducted and appropriate measures deployed; daily symptom testing criteria were implemented for patients undergoing treatment; special rotating schedules and infection control methods were implemented for various staff members such as medical physicists/dosimetrists and radiation therapists; modified radiotherapy workflow and specialized treatment area cleaning and disinfection policies and procedures were designed and executed; and special medical waste disposal methods were implemented.",

Current studies have revealed that 2019-nCoV may have originated from wild animals, but the exact origin remains unclear [4] . It is now believed that 2019-nCoV interpersonal transmission occurs mainly via respiratory droplets and close contact [5] . There may be additional risks of fecal-oral transmission, as researchers have identified 2019-nCoV in the stool of patients from the United States [6] . However, whether 2019-nCoV can be spread through aerosols or vertical transmission is yet to be confirmed [7] . The incubation period of COVID-19 has been estimated at 4-7 days on average, but there is evidence that it could be as long as 14 days [8] , which is now the commonly adopted duration for medical observation or quarantining. Although patients with symptomatic COVID-19 have been the main source of transmission, recent observations have suggested that asymptomatic subjects as well as patients within the incubation period are also carriers of 2019-nCoV [9] . This epidemiologic feature of COVID-19 has made its control extremely challenging, as it is difficult to identify and quarantine these patients harboring occult disease, which can result in increasing risks of community transmission of 2019-nCoV.",

Additionally, there is also a great risk of the infection spreading to staff members, owing to the direct interaction with infected patients before they are identified as positive (including suspected carriers, asymptomatic cases, patients with negative results on early nucleic acid tests, and patients with ultra-long incubation periods) [16, 17] . In addition, the closed environment (many radiotherapy centers are situated in basements) of the radiotherapy treatment rooms and the gathering of patients in the waiting area may further increase the risk of infection among patients and staff. Therefore, enhanced requirements are essential for COVID-19 protection and prevention at radiotherapy centers for both cancer patients and the medical staff. This paper details our infection control experience at the radiotherapy center of the Hubei Cancer Hospital, the only oncology-specific hospital in Wuhan, the earliest epicenter of the COVID-19 pandemic. We specifically report on the special measures implemented, the quality assurance investigation conducted, and the infection control outcome over the past 6 weeks. This may assist other radiation oncology departments for COVID-19 protection and prevention during this challenging time period.",

Disinfection could therefore be achieved using 30 minutes at 56 o C, ether, 75% ethanol, chlorine-containing disinfectants, peracetic acid, or chloroform.

For areas other than the treatment rooms, air disinfection was conducted using electric ultra-low capacity sprayers with 3% hydrogen peroxide, 5000mg/L peroxyacetic acid, 500mg/L chlorine dioxide, and other disinfectants. The disinfectants were applied by electric ultra-low capacity sprayers at 20-30 mL/m 3 and enclosed the area before the disinfection process. The sprays were applied in a sequential fashion: top to bottom, left to right, inside to outside, and surface to space. The areas were then fully ventilated after the disinfection was complete (the time of action of hydrogen peroxide and chlorine dioxide is 30-60 minutes, and that of peroxyacetic acid is 1 hour). Air sanitization equipment was used for disinfecting large capital equipment in the treatment vaults due to a possible erosive effect of disinfecting sprays (Fig 4D) .",

The repeat chest CT showed lung inflammation and two additional nucleic acid tests were negative. This patient's blood test showed a substantial procalcitonin elevation to 9.25, a white blood cell count elevation to 1.6x10 10 , and normal lymphocyte counts. The immunoglobulin tests (IgG, IgM) results were also normal. Based on the evaluation by the COVID-19 expert panel of our hospital, the patient was considered to have a bacterial pneumonia causing the fever, and a COVID-19 infection was ruled out at the time. The patient was put on antibacterial treatments and later resumed radiotherapy treatments after her pneumonia was controlled. This was the only patient during this interval who experienced a radiotherapy interruption due to COVID-19 related investigation. Following a 4-day interruption, this patient returned on treatment and had one fraction added to the original prescription at the end of treatment; this was per the general departmental practice guideline of adding one additional fraction for each 3-day interruption.",

Implementation of hypofractionation, or delaying radiation therapy for low-risk cancers, during the outbreak is encouraged whenever possible. We did not specially implement hypofractionation schemes because the vast majority of neoplasms at our center have little established role for hypofractionation (e.g. cranial, head and neck, lung, abdominopelvic). Unlike most Western countries, malignancies such as breast or prostate cancer comprise a very small fraction of our patient population treated during this pandemic. For those patients, there are well-established prospective data for hypofractionation, accelerated fractionation, and/or stereotactic radiotherapy; starting these patients on hormone therapy and delaying radiation therapy is also a feasible option.",

There are advantages and disadvantages to either approach, but the high acute mortality rate from COVID-19 led to the prioritization of infection control over potential incremental losses in local control. Second, no prioritization by cancer site/type was performed, as the time a patient had waited to start radiotherapy was honored, regardless of tumor type. The disadvantage of this approach primarily lies in a further increase in the time interval from diagnosis to initial therapy if radiation treatment is at capacity due to the reduced staffing level. This may impact outcomes of rapidly proliferative neoplasms such as those of the head and neck, lung, and cervix. The main reason that our center did not implement any site-based prioritization was because the patient load during the peak of the outbreak was naturally reduced to one-seventh to one-third of the normal patient load. Therefore, even with the reduced staffing level based on the rotating schedules, the patient load was not close to being at capacity. The drop in patient load was in part due to patient-elected risk-evasion decisions to pause or delay radiotherapy, and also partly due to traffic restrictions during the Wuhan lockdown. Third, and most importantly, the measures taken at our institution may not be directly extrapolated to other institutions, largely because the number of LINACs, employees, as well as PPE and other resources is highly variable between centers and circumstances in various countries. As a result, our experience is not presented for direct emulation purposes, but is rather meant to provide an experience-based summary of the policies and procedures that can be considered by other centers, and modified based on individual circumstances, in order to address the unique challenges of this unprecedented global health crisis.",

If any staff member developed symptoms, they were mandated to notify the hospital at the earliest instance of symptom development and subsequently stop reporting to work. If the staff member became a suspected or positive COVID-19 patient, other staff members in close contact with this employee were required to be quarantined immediately and would not return to work until an infection was ruled out. Between January 30 and February 12, 2020 (the two weeks of peak outbreak), there were over 2000 newly confirmed cases in Wuhan every day. Because of these rapidlydeveloping circumstances, our radiotherapy center treated about 40 patients per day (roughly 1/7 of the regular patient load). Considering the higher risk of infection, for each group of 13 radiation therapists, only 9 were on active duty and the other 4 remained as backups in case any of the 9 became infected during the week. From February 13 to March 1, the outbreak in Wuhan plateaued and appeared increasingly under control with decreasing daily tallies of newly-confirmed cases. As a result, the patient load increased, resulting in placing 2 of the backup therapists back on active duty (i.e., 11 therapists on duty and 2 as backups in each group). On March 2, newlyconfirmed cases in Wuhan dropped under 200 for the first time since the outbreak. On March 16, at the time of writing, the newly-confirmed case count dropped to 1. With lower risks for infection, the patient load then continued to increase to 90-100 patients per day, up to 1/3 of the regular patient load. Therefore, the full group of 13 therapists were put on active duty. Under our appropriate protection zoning arrangement and strict protection and prevention measures, we experienced no known employee or patient infections in the entire interval from January 30 (when the center reopened following the Chinese New Year) and March 16 (the time of writing).",

Each patient's comfort level of wearing a mask was carefully balanced against the immobilization accuracy for cranial and head-and-neck patients immobilized with thermoplastic masks(Figs 2A and 2B).For these patients, semi-open thermoplastic masks with nose and mouth openings could be used if a patient experienced breathing difficulties and could not tolerate the regular thermoplastic mask(Fig 2B). Based on a group of 18 randomly selected patients treated with this surgical mask-thermoplastic mask combination design (2 with the semi-open thermoplastic masks), we investigated its immobilization accuracy by comparing the CBCT 6D shift/rotation results against another group of 14 randomly selected patients with thermoplastic masks alone prior to the outbreak.
