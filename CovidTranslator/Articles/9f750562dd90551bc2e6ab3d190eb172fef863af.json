            "text": "Before the 1980s, intensive management of the compromised neonate was unusual and little was known regarding many of the problems of this special patient population. Although some specific conditions had been described by astute clinician-researchers, most notably the \"dummy\" foal syndrome 1 and respiratory distress syndrome caused by primary surfactant deficiency, 2 little information regarding the diagnosis and management of conditions of the foal during the neonatal period was available, although at least one active group was investigating fetal and neonatal physiology of the horse in Great Britain. [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] When treatment of compromised foals was undertaken, the approach most commonly resembled treating them as small adults with little understanding of the different physiology of the equine neonate. The advent of improved management of reproductive efficiency of mares led naturally to increased interest in preservation of the conceptus to parturition and the foal thereafter. Interested clinicians, taking their lessons from the field of human perinatology/neonatology and sometimes working hand-in-hand with their counterparts in the human field, pioneered investigations into these small patients and created the fields of equine perinatology and equine neonatal intensive care. [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] Because of the foresight and energy of these early investigators, the field of veterinary perinatology/neonatology exploded in the 1980s, leading to the creation of equine neonatal intensive care units throughout the United Sates and the world. From these units information about the normal and abnormal physiology of foals, the medical conditions affecting them, and methods for treatment and management of these problems has been developed through observational, retrospective, and prospective studies. This veritable explosion of information over the last 20 years has improved greatly the ability of all practitioners to provide appropriate care for these patients, whether in the field or at an equine neonatal intensive care unit. The ability not only to save the lives of these patients but also to treat them in such a manner as to allow them to fulfill their purposes, whether as pleasure animals or racing athletes, has improved almost exponentially from those early days. [20] [21] [22] [23] This chapter aims to provide the clinician with some of the most current information regarding the management of these patients, recognizing that much still remains unknown and that advances will continue to be made in this dynamic field. The reader is cautioned that much of this chapter is flavored by the experiences of the author and that variation in approach and treatment of specific problems exists between neonatal intensive care units (NICUs) and between clinicians in the same NICU and that each year results in change. In some cases, information that is presented has been gleaned from human NICU studies, essentially using the critically ill infant as the experimental model.",

Evaluation should include as thorough an evaluation as possible of the reproductive tract, placenta, and fetal fluids.

The first step is to take a thorough history of the mare. Of particular interest is any history of previous abnormal foals, but the history taking should include questions regarding transportation; establishment of an accurate breeding date (sometimes more difficult than one would suspect); any pertinent medical history including any diagnostic testing performed for this pregnancy such as culture, endometrial biopsy, and cytologic results; and any rectal and ultrasound examination results. Additionally, one should obtain information regarding possible ingestion of endophyte-infected fescue or exposure to potential infectious causes of abortion. 29, 30 A complete vaccination and deworming history is requisite, as is a complete history of any medications and supplements administered during pregnancy.",

One should note any abnormalities. The cervix should be tight throughout gestation; the late gestation uterus will be large and distended with fluid and usually pulled craniad in the abdomen. Palpation of the fetus frequently results in some fetal movement; however, one should interpret lack of movement with caution, for some normal fetuses do not respond. Ultrasonographic evaluation of the uterus and conceptus per rectum can provide valuable information, particularly regarding placental thickness if placentitis is a concern. One may evaluate fetal fluids and estimate fetal size from the size of the eye later in gestation. 31 In the author's hospital the practitioners choose not to perform vaginal examinations or speculum examinations because of an association between these examinations and the subsequent development of placentitis. Unless placentitis is recognized with ultrasonograhic evaluation per rectum and culture is desirable, these types of examinations are generally not necessary.",

One can measure fetal ECGs continuously using telemetry or can obtain them using more conventional techniques several times throughout the day. 24, 28, 34 One places electrodes on the skin of the mare in locations aimed at maximizing the magnitude of the fetal ECG. Because the fetus frequently changes position, multiple sites may be needed in any 24-hour period. To begin, one places an electrode dorsally in the area of the sacral prominence with two electrodes placed bilaterally in a transverse plane in the region of the flank. The fetal ECG maximal amplitude is low, usually 0.05 to 0.1 mV, and can be lost in artifact or background noise, so one commonly must move electrodes to new positions to maximize the appearance of the fetal ECG. The normal fetal heart rate during the last months of gestation ranges from 65 to 115 beats/min, a fairly wide distribution. The range of heart rate of an individual fetus can be narrow, however. Bradycardia in the fetus is an adaptation to in utero stress, most commonly thought to be hypoxia. By slowing the heart rate, the fetus prolongs exposure of fetal blood to maternal blood, increasing the time for equilibration of dissolved gas across the placenta and improving the oxygen content of the fetal blood. The fetus also has altered the distribution of its cardiac output in response to hypoxia, centralizing blood distribution. 35, 36 Tachycardia in the fetus can be associated with fetal movement, and brief periods of tachycardia should occur in the fetus in any 24-hour period. Persistent tachycardia is a sign of fetal distress and represents more severe fetal compromise than bradycardia. The author has recognized dysrhythmias in the challenged fetus, most commonly as atrial fibrillation but also apparent runs of ventricular tachycardia.",

One of the difficulties in determining fetal preparedness for birth is that prediction of parturition is difficult in these mares. Many of the parameters used in normal mares are unreliable in the high-risk pregnant mare.

Although pulmonary system maturity in human beings can be assessed with some degree of accuracy using measurement of lecithin/sphingomyelin ratios, this measurement-along with sphingomyelin, cortisol, and creatinine concentrations in the amnionic fluid-has proved to be of no benefit in the horse. [39] [40] [41] Amniocentesis carries a high risk of abortion in the horse, even with ultrasound guidance, and is not a clinically useful technique at this time. 41 Currently, no clear-cut guidelines are available as to when to intervene, but the presence of persistent fetal tachycardia or prolonged absence of fetal movements, including breathing movements, as determined by transabdominal ultrasound evaluation, should initiate discussion regarding the appropriateness of induction of parturition or elective cesarean section. The goal of induction or cesarean section is to remove a pregnancy that is threatening the survival of the dam with no thought to fetal survival or to remove the fetus from a threatening environment to improve its likelihood for survival. Preterm induction is ill advised if fetal survival is desirable because of the limited ability to treat severely immature neonates. Timing of intervention in these circumstances remains an art, not a science.",

Many high-risk mares have placentitis, primarily caused by ascending bacterial or fungal infections originating in the region of the cervix. These infections can cause in utero sepsis or compromise the fetus by local elucidation of inflammatory mediators or altered placental function. 42, 43 Premature udder development and vaginal discharge are common clinical signs. Treatment consists of administration of broad-spectrum antimicrobial agents and nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (Table 19 -1). In the author's clinic, trimethoprim-sulfonamide drugs have been the antimicrobial of choice based on unpublished studies performed at the facility demonstrating increased concentration of these agents in the fetal fluids compared with penicillin and gentamicin. However, if culture and sensitivity results are available, one should institute directed therapy. Nonsteroidal antiinflammatory agents such as flunixin meglumine are useful to combat alterations in prostaglandin balance that may be associated with infection and inflammation. Although the efficacy of these agents is best when administered before the development of clinical signs, to date no detrimental effects have been reported in the fetus or dam when chronically used at low doses in well-hydrated patients. Tocolytic agents and agents that promote uterine quiescence have been used and include altrenogest, isoxuprine, and clenbuterol. [44] [45] [46] [47] [48] Altrenogest usually is administered, although its need in late gestation has been challenged. The efficacy of isoxuprine as a tocolytic in the horse is unproven, and bioavailability of orally administered isoxuprine appears to be highly variable. 48 The long-term use of clenbuterol is inadvisable because of receptor population changes associated with chronic use and its unknown effects on the fetus at this time. Clenbuterol may be indicated during management of dystocia in preparation for assisted delivery or cesarean section. 46 The intravenous form of clenbuterol is not currently available in the United States.",

            "text": "One can use three additional strategies in managing high-risk pregnancy patients. In mares with evidence of placental dysfunction, with or without signs of fetal distress, the author provides intranasal oxygen supplementation in the hope of improving oxygen delivery to the fetus. Intranasal oxygen insufflation of 10 to 15 L/min to the mare significantly increases PaO 2 and percent oxygen saturation of hemoglobin. 49 Because of the placental vessel arrangement of the horse, improvement of these two arterial blood gas parameters should result in improved oxygen delivery to the fetus. Blood gas transport is largely independent of diffusion distance in the equine placenta, particularly in late gestation, and depends more on blood flow. Information from other species cannot be extrapolated to the equine placenta because of its diffuse epitheliochorial nature and the arrangement of the maternal and fetal blood vessels within the microcotyledons. 50,51 Umbilical venous pO 2 is 50 to 54 mm Hg in the horse fetus, compared with 30 to 34 mm Hg in the sheep, whereas the maternal uterine vein to umbilical vein pO 2 difference is near 0. Also unlike the sheep, the umbilical venous pO 2 values decrease 5 to 10 mm Hg in response to maternal hypoxemia and increase in response to maternal hyperoxia. [52] [53] [54] Vitamin E (tocopherol) is administered orally to some high-risk mares as an antioxidant. Administration of large doses of vitamin E before traumatic brain injury improves neurologic outcome in experimental models and has been examined as possible prophylaxis for human neonatal encephalopathy. [55] [56] [57] Extrapolation of that information to the compromised equine fetus suggests that increased antioxidant concentrations in the fetus may mitigate some of the consequences of uterine and birth hypoxia, but no evidence is available to date demonstrating that protection occurs or that vitamin E accumulates in the fetus in response to supplementation of the mare. Finally, many high-risk mares are anorectic or held off feed because of their medical condition. These mares are at particularly great risk for fetal loss because of their lack of feed intake, which alters prostaglandin metabolism. 58 Therefore one should administer 2.5% to 5% dextrose in 0.45% saline or water (5% dextrose) intravenously at maintenance fluid rates to these patients.",

One should observe mares at least hourly for evidence of early-stage labor and should put them under constant video surveillance if possible. Depending on the primary problem, the team managing the mare should develop a plan for handling the parturition once labor begins and for fetal resuscitation following delivery. Any equipment that might be needed should be readily available stallside, and a call sheet, listing contact numbers for all involved, should be posted on or near the stall. The plan should include a decision as to how to handle a complicated dystocia, should it occur, with permission for general anesthesia and cesarean section obtained before the event so that time is not wasted. An important question to be posed to the owner at the outset is which is most important to the owner, the mare or the foal, for the answer may dictate the direction of the decision tree once labor begins. 59",

            "text": "Early recognition of abnormalities is of utmost importance for successful management of critically ill foals. To recognize the abnormal, one must know the normal. Immediately following birth, foals effect several important physiologic and behavioral changes. Chief among these changes is the adaptation of the cardiovascular and respiratory systems to extrauterine life. The normal transition of the respiratory tract involves opening closed 1384 PART II Disorders of Specific Body Systems alveoli and absorption of fluid from the airway, accomplished by a combination of breathing efforts, expiration against a closed glottis (grunting), and a change in sodium flux across the respiratory membrane from net secretion to net absorption. [60] [61] [62] [63] [64] The transition from fetal to neonatal circulatory patterns requires resolution of the pulmonary hypertension present in the fetus, normally shunting blood flow through the lower resistance ductus arteriosus in the fetal state, to direct cardiac output to the pulmonary vasculature for participation in gas exchange. This change is achieved by the opening of alveoli, decreasing airway resistance and providing radial support for pulmonary vessels, functional closure of the ductus arteriosus, and increasing the oxygen tension in the lung, reversing pulmonary vasoconstriction mediated by hypoxia. 65, 66 Pulmonary tree vasodilators (prostacyclin, nitric oxide [NO] ) and vasoconstrictors (endothelin-1, leukotrienes) play apparently well-coordinated, but as yet not fully elucidated, roles. In the normal newborn this change is smooth and rapid. These critical events are undermined by factors such as inadequate lung development, surfactant deficiency (primary or secondary), viral or bacterial infection, placental abnormalities, in utero hypoxia, and meconium aspiration. Spontaneous breathing should begin in the neonate within 1 minute of birth, many foals attempt to breathe as their thorax clears the pelvic canal. During the first hour of life, the respiratory rate of a healthy foal can be as high as 80 breaths per minute but should decrease to 30 to 40 breaths per minute within a few hours. Similarly, the heart rate of a healthy newborn foal has a regular rhythm and should be at least 60 beats/min at the first minute. 67, 68 One usually can auscultate a continuous murmur over the left side of the heart, although its loudness may vary with position. This murmur is thought to be associated with some shunting through the ductus arteriosus. One may auscultate variable systolic murmurs, thought to be flow murmurs, during the first week of life. 69 One should investigate more thoroughly murmurs that persist beyond the first week of life in an otherwise healthy foal, along with any murmur associated with persistent hypoxia. Auscultation of the thorax shortly after birth reveals a cacophony of sounds as airways open and fluid is cleared. End-expiratory crackles are consistently audible in the dependent lung during and following lateral recumbency. For a normal newborn foal to appear slightly cyanotic during this initial adaptation period is not unusual, but this should resolve within minutes of birth. The equine fetus, as do all fetuses, exists in a moderately hypoxic environment, but the equine fetus has a greater partial pressure of oxygen, around 50 mm Hg. 70 Because the fetus is well adapted to low oxygen tensions, cyanosis is rarely present in newborn foals once adaption occurs, even those with low oxygen tensions. Although in many species the fetal blood oxygen affinity is greater than the maternal blood, in the equine fetus the oxygen affinity of its hemoglobin is only about 2 mm Hg greater than the maternal blood because of decreased levels of 2,3-diphosphoglycerate compared with other species. 71 The result is enhanced oxygen unloading in the equine fetus compared with others. 2,3-Diphosphoglycerate concentration increases after birth in the foal and reaches mature levels by 3 to 5 days of age. The major blood adaptation of the equine fetus to chronic hypoxia is an increase in packed cell volume of up to 20%, increasing the oxygen content of the blood as compensation for decreased oxygen delivery at the placenta. 72 A larger than expected packed cell volume in any newborn foal should alert the clinician for possible sequelae from chronic hypoxia. The presence of significant cyanosis that persists should prompt the clinician to evaluate the foal thoroughly for cardiac anomalies resulting in significant right-to-left shunting or separated circulations, such as transposition of the great vessels.",

This compliance requires that the foal actively participate in inspiration and expiration with several potential consequences. First, restriction of the thorax or the abdomen can result in impaired ventilation, which can occur easily when one restrains a foal and may result in spuriously abnormal arterial blood gas values (see the discussion on arterial blood gas evaluation, Respiratory Diseases Associated with Hypoxemia in the Neonate). Second, foals with primary pulmonary parenchymal disease resulting in poorly compliant lungs develop paradoxical chest wall motion, with the thorax moving inward during inspiration. [73] [74] [75] [76] The work of breathing can increase greatly, resulting in respiratory failure because of respiratory muscle fatigue. A foal that appears suddenly to improve a previously abnormal respiratory rate and pattern may in fact be in greater respiratory difficulty because of fatigue. One can observe a reduction in respiratory rate or abnormal breathing pattern in premature/dysmature foals or foals subjected to peripartum hypoxia/asphxia. Although the genesis of these patterns is not understood fully, Cheyne-Stokes (lengthy periods of apnea interrupted by short breaths that wax and wane in depth), cluster (short periods of apnea interspersed with long periods of breathing), and Biot's breathing (periods of apnea and breathing with no discernible pattern) may occur in these cases. Foals attempting to maintain an adequate lung volume expire against a partially closed glottis, called Valsalva's maneuver, producing an audible grunt.",

            "text": "Foals are normally nonresponsive while in the birth canal but should respond to stimulation immediately after birth. 67 The lack of responsiveness while in the birth canal has lead to presumption of fetal death during dystocia. Because of this, one should attempt other tests before determining that a foal is dead intrapartum. One possibly may detect pulses in the tongue, neck, or any presented limbs or palpate the thorax for a heartbeat. In the author's facility, nasotracheal intubation of the foal combined with measurement of CO 2 tensions in the exhaled gas aids practitioners in cases where they can reach the nose. Nasotracheal intubation of foals under these circumstances actually can be performed readily with minimal practice. Having long endotracheal tubes available of several different diameters (7 to 12 mm outer diameter) with an inflatable cuff is important. One can pass the tube blindly using a finger in one nostril for guidance and can check the position frequently by palpation of the throatlatch region. One inflates the cuff and begins manual ventilation with 100% oxygen or room air using an Ambu-bag or equivalent. One can obtain continuous measurement of CO 2 tension using a capnograph or single-use disposable end-tidal CO 2 monitor attached to the Ambu-bag or the nasotracheal tube. In a dead foal the end-tidal CO 2 measurement will be negligible after the first 10 to 20 breaths. One must ensure tube placement and seal integrity and allow for multiple breaths. Some CO 2 will \"wash out\" with the first few breaths and can result in false hope initially. End-tidal CO 2 varies in living intrapartum foals, depending on cardiac output and ventilation frequency, but should be consistently greater than 20 mm Hg and is usually closer to 30 mm Hg. Once one establishes manual ventilation of a living foal, one must continue ventilation until the foal is delivered satisfactorily. The author has resuscitated and maintained many foals successfully in this manner throughout induction of general anesthesia in the mare and cesarean section delivery of the foal. The nasotracheal tube also provides a convenient site for administration of intratracheal medications such as epinephrine used for extrauterine intrapartum resuscitation of the foal. The reader is cautioned that intratracheal epinephrine increases endtidal CO 2 measurements transiently, even in a dead foal, because of local actions on tissues. One should allow a washout period after intratracheal administration of epinephrine.",

Within an hour of birth the normal foal will demonstrate auditory orientation with unilateral pinna control. The normal pupillary angle is ventromedial in the newborn foal; this angle gradually becomes dorsomedial over the first month of life. Foals should begin attempting to stand shortly after birth and should be able to achieve this on their own within 2 hours of birth. 67 The normal newborn foal has a suck reflex shortly after birth and should be searching for an udder even before it stands. The expectation is that a normal foal will be sucking from the dam unaided by 3 hours post partum; many foals are overachievers and will be sucking well before this time. The normal foal may defecate shortly after standing but may not attempt defecation until after it first successfully sucks from the dam. Urination varies more, with filly foals usually urinating before colt foals, but both usually do not urinate for several hours following birth, up to 12 hours for some colts. 67 For colt foals to fail to drop their penises when urinating over the first few days of life is not unusual.",

Extreme hypermetria of the forelimbs, usually bilateral but occasionally unilateral, has been observed in some foals and is associated with perinatal hypoxic/ischemic insults, but this gait abnormality usually resolves without specific therapy within a few days. Spinal reflexes tend to be exaggerated, whereas the crossed extensor reflex may not be fully present until 3 weeks of age. 77 Foals also exhibit an exaggerated response to external stimuli (noise, sudden visual changes, touch) for the first few weeks of life. Foals are not bonded strongly to their mother for the first few weeks of life and will follow any large moving object, including other horses and human beings. Orphan foals bond with surrogate mothers until they are several months of age; their primary motivation appears to be appetite. Conversely, mares strongly bond with their foals shortly after parturition; the process begins once the chorioallantois ruptures and is driven more by olfaction and taste than by vision or hearing. Interference with this process, by medical intervention or excessive owner manipulation of the foal, can disrupt normal bonding and result in foal rejection by the dam. 78",

The lead clinician should control tightly the number of persons attending, and the degree of activity surrounding, the birth.",

The fetus responds to conditions producing more severe in utero hypoxia by strengthening the fetal circulatory pattern, and the neonate responds to hypoxia by reverting to the fetal circulatory pattern. 80 During a normal parturition, mild asphyxia occurs and results in fetal responses that pave the way for a successful transition to extrauterine life. If more than mild transient asphyxia occurs, the fetus is stimulated to breathe in utero; this is known as primary asphyxia. 81 If the initial breathing effort resulting from the primary asphyxia does not correct the asphyxia, a second gasping period occurs in several minutes, known as the secondary asphyxia response. If no improvement in asphyxia occurs during this period, the foal enters secondary apnea, a state that is irreversible except with resuscitation.",

            "text": "Therefore the first priority of neonatal resuscitation is establishing an airway and breathing pattern. One should assume that foals not spontaneously breathing are in secondary apnea and should clear the airway of membranes as soon as the nose is presented. If meconium staining is present, one should suction the airway before delivery of the foal is completed and before the foal breathes spontaneously. One should continue to the trachea if aspiration of the nasopharynx is productive. Overzealous suctioning worsens bradycardia as it worsens hypoxia. One should stop suctioning once the foal begins breathing spontaneously, as hypoxia will worsen with continued suction. If the foal does not breathe or move spontaneously within seconds of birth, one should begin tactile stimulation. If tactile stimulation fails to result in spontaneous breathing, one immediately should intubate the foal and manually ventilate the foal using an Ambu-bag or equivalent. One can use mouth-to-nose ventilation if nasotracheal tubes and an Ambu-bag are not available. The goal of this therapy is to reverse fetal circulation, and hyperventilation with 100% oxygen is the best choice for this purpose. However, recent evidence suggests that no clinical disadvantages are apparent in using room air for ventilation of asphyxiated human neonates rather than 100% oxygen. 82, 83 Human infants resuscitated with room air recovered more quickly than those resuscitated with 100% oxygen in one study as assessed by Apgar scores, time to the first cry, and the sustained pattern of breathing. 84 In addition, neonates resuscitated with 100% oxygen exhibited biochemical findings reflecting prolonged oxidative stress, present even after 4 weeks of postnatal life, which did not appear in the group resuscitated with room air. Thus the current accepted recommendations for using 100% oxygen in the resuscitation of asphyxiated neonates needs further discussion and investigation. 85, 86 Almost 90% of foals requiring resuscitation respond to hyperventilation alone and require no additional therapy. One can initiate nasotracheal intubation while the foal is in the birth canal if the foal will not be delivered rapidly, such as with a difficult dystocia. This technique is \"blind\" and requires some practice but may be beneficial and lifesaving. Once spontaneous breathing is present, one Apgar Score in the Foal should provide humidified oxygen via nasal insufflation at 8 to 10 L/min.",

Unfortunately, ribs 3 to 5 frequently are involved, and their location over the heart can make chest compression a potentially fatal exercise.

            "text": "Because birthing areas are generally cold, one should dry the foal and place it on dry bedding once resuscitation is complete. The fetus has some homeothermic mechanisms, but its size in relation to its mother and its position within her body means that it is in effect a poikilotherm. The body temperature of the foal generally reflects that of its environment, namely its mother, although the human fetal temperature directly measured at cesarean section, induction of labor, or during labor is approximately 0.5\u00b0C higher than the mothers. 91, 92 Adaptation from poikilothermy to homeothermy normally takes place rapidly following birth. The fetus is capable of nonshivering thermogenesis, primarily through the oxidation of brown fat reserves, but this type of thermogenesis is inhibited in utero, probably by placental prostaglandin E 2 and adenosine. 93, 94 Immediately after birth the foal must adapt to independent thermoregulation. Local physical factors, including ambient temperature and humidity, act to induce cold stress, and the newborn must produce heat by metabolic activity. In response to the catecholamine surge associated with birth, uncoupling of oxidative phosphorylation occurs within mitochondria, releasing energy as heat. This nonshivering thermogenesis is impaired in newborns undergoing hypoxia or asphyxiation and in those that are ill at birth. Infants born to mothers sedated with benzodiazepines are affected similarly, a consideration in the choice of sedative and preanesthetic medications in mares suffering dystocia or 1388 PART II Disorders of Specific Body Systems undergoing cesarean section. [95] [96] [97] Heat losses by convection, radiation, and evaporation are high in most areas where foals are delivered, resuscitated ,and managed, and one must take care to minimize cold stress in the newborn and the critically ill foal. Supplementary heat, in the form of radiant heat lamps or warm air circulating blankets, may be required. One should use fluid therapy conservatively during postpartum resuscitation, for the neonate is not volume depleted unless excessive bleeding has occurred. Some compromised newborn foals are actually hypervolemic. Fluid therapy of the neonate is discussed in more detail later in this chapter. Because the renal function of the equine neonate is substantially different from the adult, one cannot simply scale down fluid therapy from adult therapy. [98] [99] [100] If intravenous fluids are required for resuscitation and blood loss is identified, administration of 20 ml/kg of a non-glucose-containing polyionic isotonic fluid over 20 minutes (about 1 L for a 50-kg foal) once intravenous access is established can be effective. The author stresses non-glucose-containing polyionic intravenous fluids because hyperglycemia, but not hypoglycemia, immediately after fetal or neonatal asphyxia interfered with the recovery of brain cell membrane function and energy metabolism in neonatal piglets in one recent study. 101 These findings suggest that post-hypoxic-ischemic hyperglycemia is not beneficial and might even be harmful in neonatal hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy. Indications for this shock bolus therapy include poor mentation, poorly palpable peripheral pulses, and the development of cold distal extremities, compatible with hemorrhagic shock. One should reassess the patient after the initial bolus and administer additional boluses as necessary. Ideally, one should follow up on blood pressures and ECG readings and initiate appropriate pressor therapy if needed. Again, these procedures are discussed in detail later in the chapter.",

However, one should suspect the condition in any neonate with hypercapnic hypoxemia that persists and worsens; these foals are in hypoxemic respiratory failure.

Systolic pulmonary pressures can remain equivalent to systemic pressure for up to 6 hours of age in human infants, although diastolic pulmonary pressures are well below systemic diastolic pressures by 1 hour. 111 Mean pulmonary artery pressures fall gradually over the first 48 hours. 112 The direct effects of lung expansion and increasing alveolar oxygen tension probably provide the initial stimulus for pulmonary arteriolar dilation and partly result from direct physical effects, but vasoactive substances are released in response to physical forces associated with ventilation, for example prostacyclin. 110 Other vasoactive mediators thought to play a role in regulating pulmonary arteriolar tone include NO, prostaglandins D 2 and E 2 , bradykinin, histamine, endothelin-1, angiotensin II, and atrial natriuretic peptide. The increase in alveolar and arterial oxygen tensions at birth is required for completion of resolution of pulmonary hypertension. Much of this increase is thought to be mediated by NO, evidence for this being the parallel increase during gestation of the pulmonary vasodilation response to hyperoxia and the increase in NO synthesis. 113 However, inhibition of NO synthesis does not eliminate the initial decrease in pulmonary artery resistance occurring because of opening of the airways. 114 When these mechanisms fail, one can recognize PPH. Right-to-left shunting within the lungs and through patent fetal conduits occurs and can result from many factors, including asphyxia and meconium aspiration, but in many cases the precipitating trigger is unknown. Inappropriately decreased levels of vasodilators (NO) and inappropriately increased levels of vasoconstrictors (endothelin-1) currently are being examined as potential mechanisms. Chronic in utero hypoxia and acidosis may result in hypertrophy of the pulmonary arteriolar smooth muscle. 115 In these cases, reversal of PPH can be difficult and cannot be achieved rapidly.",

Initial therapy is provision of oxygen intranasally at 8 to 10 L/min. Some foals respond to this therapy and establish neonatal circulatory patterns within a few hours. Failure to improve or worsening of hypoxemic respiratory failure following intranasal oxygen administration should prompt intubation and mechanical ventilation with 100% oxygen. This serves two purposes, one diagnostic and one therapeutic. Ventilation with 100% oxygen may resolve PPH and, if intrapulmonary shunt and altered ventilation-perfusion relationships are causing the hypoxic respiratory failure, arterial oxygen tension (PaO 2 ) should exceed 100 mm Hg under these conditions. Failure to improve PaO 2 suggests PPH or large right-to-left extrapulmonary shunt caused by congenital cardiac anomaly. The vasodilators prostacyclin and telazoline (an \u03b1-blocking vasodilator) cause pulmonary vasodilation in human infants with PPH, but the effects on oxygenation vary and the sideeffects (tachycardia, severe systemic hypotension) are unacceptable. 116 Recognition of NO as a potent dilator of pulmonary vessels has created a significant step forward in the treatment of these patients, for inhaled NO dilates vessels in ventilated portions of the lung while having minimal effects on the systemic circulation. 117 Based on evidence presently available, use of inhaled NO in an initial concentration of about 20 ppm in the ventilatory gas seems reasonable for term and near-term foals with hypoxic respiratory failure and PPH that fails to respond to mechanical ventilation using 100% oxygen alone. 117, 118 The author has used this approach in the clinic, administering a range of 5 to 40 ppm NO with success.",

            "text": "A wide spectrum of clinical signs is associated with HIE and can range from mild depression with loss of the suck reflex to grand mal seizure activity. Typically, affected foals are normal at birth but show signs of central nervous system abnormalities within a few hours after birth. Some foals are obviously abnormal at birth, and some do not show signs until 24 hours of age. Hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy commonly is associated with adverse peripartum events, including dystocia and premature placental separation, but a fair number of foals have no known peripartum period of hypoxia, suggesting that these foals result from unrecognized in utero hypoxia (Box 19-2). Severe maternal illness also may result in foals born with PAS. In human beings, ascending placental infection now is suspected of being a major contributor to neonatal encephalopathy in infants, and the incidence of neonatal encephalopathy increases with the presence of maternal fever, suggesting a role for maternal inflammatory mediators. 120 The underlying pathophysiologic details of HIE in the foal are unknown, and to date accurate experimental models of HIE and PAS in the foal have not been described. However, a great deal of attention has been paid to peripartum hypoxia/asphyxia by human counterparts because the effects of adverse peripartum events in the human neonate have far ranging implications for the affected human neonate and for society. Therefore equine neonatologists have long looked to human studies and models of the human disease for understanding of the syndrome in the equine neonate. Perinatal brain damage in the mature fetus usually results from severe uterine asphyxia caused by an acute reduction of uterine or umbilical circulation. The fetus responds to this challenge by activation of the sympathetic adrenergic nervous system, causing a redistribution of cardiac output that favors the central organs: brain, heart, and adrenal glands. 121, 122 If the hypoxic insult continues, the fetus reaches a point beyond which it cannot maintain this centralization of circulation, cardiac output falls, and cerebral circulation diminishes. 122 The loss of oxygen results in a substantial decrease in oxidative phosphorylation in the brain with concomitant decreased energy production. The Na + /K + pump at the cell membrane cannot maintain the ionic gradients, and the membrane potential is lost in the brain cells. In the absence of the membrane potential, calcium flows down its large extracellular/intracellular concentration gradient through voltage-dependent ion channels into the cell. This calcium overload of the neuron leads to cell damage by activation of calcium-dependent proteases, lipases, and endonucleases. Protein biosynthesis is halted. Calcium also enters the cells by glutamate-regulated ion channels as glutamate, an excitatory neurotransmitter, is released from presynaptic vesicles following anoxic cellular depolarization. Once the anoxic event is over, protein synthesis remains inhibited in specific areas of the brain and returns to normal in less vulnerable areas of the brain. Loss of protein synthesis appears to be an early indicator of cell death caused by the primary hypoxic/anoxic event. 123 A second wave of neuronal cell death occurs during the reperfusion phase and is thought to be similar to classically described postischemic reperfusion injury in that damage is caused by production of and release of oxygen radicals, synthesis of NO, and inflammatory reactions. 124 Additionally, an imbalance between excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmitters occurs. 123 Part of the secondary cell death that occurs is thought to be caused by apoptosis, a type of programmed cell death termed cellular suicide. Secondary cell death also is thought be caused by the neurotoxicity of glutamate and aspartate resulting again from increased intracellular calcium levels. 125, 126 In human infants the distribution of lesions with hypoxic-ischemic brain damage following prenatal, perinatal, or postnatal asphyxia falls into distinct patterns depending on the type of hypoxia-ischemia rather than on postconceptual age at which the asphyxial event occurs. 126 Periventricular leukomalacia was associated with chronic hypoxia-ischemia, whereas the basal ganglia and thalamus were affected primarily in patients experiencing acute profound asphyxia, providing direct evidence that the nature of the event determines the severity and distribution of neurologic damage in human beings. These remarkably selective patterns of injury in children, with differential variability in the damage caused to regions anatomically located within millimeters of each other, resulted in the hypothesis that location within neurotransmitter-specific circuitry loops is important. This hypothesis has important implications in the design of neuroprotective strategies and therapies for neonates experiencing hypoxic-ischemic-asphyxial events. Now the evidence is overwhelming that the excitotoxic cascade that evolves during HIE extends over several days from the time of insult and is modifiable. 125, 126 In brain injury, traumatic or hypoxic, the mechanisms underlying delayed tissue injury still are understood poorly. Many believe that neurochemical changes, including excessive neurotransmitter release, are pivotal in the pathophysiology of secondary neuronal death. Excitatory amino acid neurotransmitters and magnesium are known to play at least a minimal role in secondary cell death following brain injury; a fair body of literature regarding these factors has been generated over the last 10 years. The activation of the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) subtype of glutamate receptors is implicated in the pathophysiology of traumatic brain injury and is suspected to play a role in HIE. [125] [126] [127] Mechanically injured neurons demonstrate a reduction of voltage-dependent Mg 2+ blockade of NMDA current that can be restored partially by increasing extracellular Mg 2+ concentration or by pretreatment with calphostin C, a protein kinase C inhibitor. 128 This finding suggested that administration of Mg 2+ to patients with brain injury could lead to improved outcome. Subsequently, magnesium sulfate solution was shown to improve dramatically the immediate recovery of rats from hypoxia. 129 However, although pretreatment with magnesium sulfate protected against hypoxic ischemic brain injury, postasphyxial treatment worsened brain damage in 7-day-old rats, suggesting an age-related response in the rat. 130 Delayed magnesium treatment of mature rats following severe traumatic axonal brain injury improved motor outcome when administered up to 24 hours after injury, with early treatments providing the most benefit. 131 Maternal seizure in rats is associated with fetal histopathologic changes that are abolished by administration of magnesium sulfate to the mother, and magnesium sulfate has been demonstrated to protect the fetal brain from severe maternal hypoxia. 132 Clinical trials investigating the efficacy of magnesium treatment following hypoxia in infants are under way, with few reports currently in the medical literature. Magnesium sulfate was used to treat nine infants after perinatal asphyxia in one study (no control group), and all children were neurologically normal at 1 year of age. Seizures did not occur in any of these children, nor were any adverse side effects noted. 133 Magnesium sulfate administration failed to delay the global impairment in energy metabolism after hypoxia ischemia, characteristic of severe brain damage, in newborn piglets; at 48 hours after hypoxia ischemia, no difference could be found in the severity of injury in piglets treated with magnesium compared with piglets treated with placebo, suggesting magnesium may not be protective with severe acute injury. 134 In developing countries, birth hypoxia frequently is associated with HIE, and although this finding is attributed most frequently to inadequate obstetric care, poor nutrition also may play a role. Red blood cell magnesium levels were measured in more than 500 women in labor at a teaching hospital in South Africa. 135 Fifty five of the women delivered infants with HIE and had significantly lower levels of magnesium than controls; the infants with HIE also had significantly lower magnesium levels than controls. The large majority (54 of 55) of the women giving birth to HIE infants were from poor social circumstances, suggesting nutrition might play a role in some cases of HIE, with maternal magnesium levels affecting outcome in the infants. The authors suggested an early pregnancy intervention study may help determine the role of magnesium in the pathogenesis of HIE in human infants born to at-risk mothers.",

Control of seizures is important because cerebral oxygen consumption increases fivefold during seizures. One can use diazepam for emergency control of seizures (Table 19 -4). If diazepam does not stop seizures readily or one recognizes more than two seizures, then one should replace diazepam with phenobarbital given to effect. The half-life of phenobarbital can be long in the foal (100 hours), and one should keep this in mind when monitoring neurologic function in these cases after phenobarbital administration (J.E. Palmer, personal communication, 1998). 136 Earlystage, preseizure administration of phenobarbital has been advocated by some investigators for prevention of neonatal encephalopathy. However, one recent study in asphyxiated human infants demonstrated that early phenobarbital treatment was associated with a threefold increase in the incidence of subsequent seizures and consequently a trend toward increased mortality. Seizures per se were associated with almost a twentyfold increase in mortality. Their findings suggest that early phenobarbital administration may produce adverse rather than beneficial effects following asphyxia. Because this was an observational study; the results need to be confirmed by appropriate randomized trials in similar clinical settings. 137 If phenobarbital fails to control seizures, one may attempt phenytoin therapy. In cases of HIE, one should avoid ketamine and xylazine because of their association with increased intracranial pressure. One must protect the foal from injury during a seizure and also ensure the patency of the airway to prevent the onset of negative pressure pulmonary edema 138 or aspiration pneumonia.",

            "text": "Probably the most important therapeutic interventions are aimed at maintaining cerebral perfusion, which is achieved by careful titration of intravenous fluid support, neither too much nor too little (see Fluid Therapy in Neonates) and judicious administration of inotropes and pressors to maintain adequate perfusion pressures (see Pressor and Inotrope Therapy in Neonates). Cerebral interstitial edema is only truly present in the most severe cases 139, 140 ; in most cases the lesion is intracellular edema and most of the classic agents used to treat cerebral interstitial edema (e.g., mannitol) are minimally effective treating cellular edema. Occasionally the author uses thiamine supplementation in the intravenous fluids to support metabolic processes, specifically mitochondrial metabolism and membrane Na + ,K + -ATPases, involved in maintaining cellular fluid balance. 141, 142 This therapy is rational and inexpensive but unproven in efficacy. Only if cellular necrosis and vasogenic edema are present are drugs such as mannitol and dimethyl sulfoxide indicated, and again these cases are usually the most severely affected. In the author's clinic, practitioners rarely have used dimethyl sulfoxide in neonates for the last several years and have recognized no change in outcome by discontinuing its use. When the practitioners use intravenously administered dimethyl sulfoxide, they do so within the first hour after an acute asphyxial insult and use it primarily for its hydroxyl radical scavenging effects and its theoretical modulation of postischemic reperfusion injury. 143 Naloxone has been advocated for treating HIE in human beings and in foals, [144] [145] [146] perhaps based on a study suggesting that postasphyxia blood-brain barrier disruption was related causally to poor neurologic outcome in a lamb model of HIE and that naloxone prevented disruption and neurologic dysfunction among those survivors with an intact blood-brain barrier. 145 However, other studies have demonstrated that naloxone exacerbates hypoxic-ischemic brain injury in 7-day-old rats subjected to unilateral common carotid artery ligation and hypoxia. Moreover, systemic acidosis and cellular edema were no different in naloxone-treated animals compared with animals treated with saline solution. The authors concluded that high doses of naloxone in fact may reduce the resistance of the fetus to hypoxic stress. 146 The use of naloxone in human neonatal resuscitation remains controversial, for whether the contradictory effects are related to a reduction in acute neuronal swelling by osmotic effects or by a more direct receptor-mediated mechanism is currently unknown. 147 Naloxone is most effective in resuscitation of compromised human infants born to mothers addicted to drugs. Some practitioners are using \u03b3-aminobutyric acid adrenergic agonists to manage HIE in foals, based on evidence showing neuroprotection when used in ischemia alone and combined with NMDA antagonists. [148] [149] [150] The author currently has no experience with these compounds and cannot comment regarding their efficacy in foals. Regional hypothermia also is being investigated as a potential therapy for global hypoxia/ischemia; published data are consistent with the theory that cooling must be continued throughout the entire secondary phase of injury (about 3 days) to be effective. 151 Experimentally, this approach has resulted in dramatic decreases in cellular edema and neuronal loss; its practical application remains to be demonstrated. Despite a lack of consensus regarding the use of magnesium to treat infants with HIE, the author has used magnesium sulfate infusion as part of the therapy for selected foals with HIE for the past several years. The rationale is based primarily on the evidence demonstrating protection in some studies and a failure of any one study to demonstrate significant detrimental effects. The clinical impressions of the author to date suggest that the therapy is safe and may decrease the incidence of seizure in patients. The author administers magnesium sulfate as a constant rate infusion over 1 hour after giving a loading dose. The author has continued the infusion for up to 3 days without demonstrable negative effect beyond some possible trembling. Given the current evidence, a 24-hour course of treatment may be effective and all that is necessary. Postasphyxial treatment certainly may be beneficial in foals with HIE, and maternal magnesium therapy may be beneficial in certain high-risk pregnancy patients.",

Although one needs to address these problems, one should not forget the normal period of hypoglycemia that occurs postpartum and should not treat aggressively so as to avoid worsening the neurologic injury. Foals suffering from PAS also have frequent recurrent bouts of hypoxemia and occasional bouts of hypercapnia. Intranasally administered oxygen is generally needed in these cases as a preventative therapy and as direct treatment, for the appearance of the abnormalities can be sporadic and unpredictable. Additional respiratory support, particularly in those foals with centrally mediated hypoventilation and periods of apnea or abnormal breathing patterns, include caffeine (per os or per rectum) and positive pressure ventilation. Caffeine is a central respiratory stimulant and has minimal side effects at the dosages used (10 mg/kg loading dose; 2.5 mg/kg as needed). 152 The author purchases whatever oral form of caffeine is available at the local convenience store or drug store and administers it dissolved in warm water per rectum. Foals treated with caffeine have an increased level of arousal and are more reactive to the environment. Adverse effects generally are limited to restlessness, hyperactivity, and mild to moderate tachycardia. Mechanical ventilation of these patients can be rewarding and generally is required for less than 48 hours. One must monitor and maintain blood pH within the normal range. Metabolic alkalosis can develop in some of these foals and requires clinician tolerance of some degree of hypercapnia. pH is important in evaluation and consideration of alternatives for treatment. If the respiratory acidosis is not so severe as to affect the patient adversely (generally >70 mm Hg), and the pH is within normal limits, the foal may tolerate hypercapnia. 153 The goal is to normalize pH. Foals with respiratory acidosis as compensation for metabolic alkalosis do not respond to caffeine. Metabolic alkalosis in critically ill foals frequently is associated with electrolyte abnormalities, creating differences in strong ion balance. One handles this pH perturbation best by correcting the underlying electrolyte problem.",

One should maintain the oxygen-carrying capacity of the blood; some foals require transfusions to maintain a packed cell volume greater than 20%. Adequate vascular volume is important, but one should take care to avoid fluid overload in the foal. Early evidence of fluid overload is subtle accumulation of ventral edema between the front legs and over the distal limbs. Fluid overload can result in cerebral edema, pulmonary edema, and edema of other tissues, including the gastrointestinal tract. This edema interferes with normal organ function and worsens the condition of the patient. One maintains perfusion by supporting cardiac output and blood pressure by judicious use of intravenous fluid support and inotrope/pressor support. The author does not target therapy to a specific systolic, mean, or diastolic pressure but monitors urine output, mentation, limb perfusion, gastrointestinal function, and respiratory function as indicators that perfusion is acceptable.

            "text": "Overzealous use of diuretics and pressors in these cases can result in diuresis requiring increased intravenous fluid support and can be counterproductive. The author's approach is more conservative. Low doses of dopamine administered as a constant rate infusion of 2 to 5 \u00b5g/kg/min are usually effective in establishing diuresis by natriuresis. One should avoid large doses of dopamine (>20 \u00b5g/kg/min) because high doses can produce systemic and pulmonary vasoconstriction, potentially exacerbating PPH. 157 One can administer a bolus (0.25 to 1.0 mg/kg) or constant rate infusion (0.25 to 2.0 mg/kg/hr) of furosemide, but once furosemide diuresis is established, one must evaluate electrolyte concentrations and blood gas tensions frequently because potassium, chloride, and calcium losses can be considerable and because significant metabolic alkalosis can develop from strong ion imbalances. The author does not aim for urine production rates of 300 ml/hr, as has been presented by other authors as a urine output goal for critically ill equine neonates. 158 Rather the author looks for urine output that is appropriate for fluid intake and does not attempt to drive urine output to an arbitrary goal by excessive fluid administration or pressor use. Although the average urine output for a normal equine neonate is about 6 ml/kg/hr (~300 ml/hr for a 50-kg foal), these values were obtained from normal foals drinking a milk diet with a large free water component. [98] [99] [100] The urine of normal newborn foals is dilute, reflecting the large free water load they incur by their diet. Expecting critically ill foals to produce such large volumes of urine, particularly those on restricted diets or receiving total parenteral nutrition, is an exercise in futility, and manipulating fluid, pressor, or diuretic therapy in attempt to meet an artificial goal is inappropriate. Fluid therapy in the critically ill neonate is discussed later in this chapter.",

The author monitors aminoglycoside concentrations for 30-minute peak and 23-to 24-hour trough values in these cases and adjusts dosage and frequency of drug administration based on these results.

These problems are exacerbated by constant feeding in the face of continued dysfunction and continued hypoxia. Frequently, enteral feeding cannot meet their nutritional requirements, and partial or total parenteral nutrition is required. One must give special attention to passive transfer of immunity (see Failure of Passive Transfer) and glucose homeostasis in these cases. Although some practitioners use prokinetic agents as therapy for ileus in these cases, the author's approach is again more conservative. Appearance of damage to the gastrointestinal tract can be subtle and lag behind other clinical abnormalities for days to weeks. Low-grade colic, decreased gastrointestinal motility, decreased fecal output, and low weight gain are among the most common clinical signs of gastrointestinal dysfunction in these case, but more severe problems, including necrotizing enterocolitis and intussusception, have been associated with these cases. The return to enteral feeding must be slow in many of these cases. A currently debated topic is constant versus pulsed enteral feeding. [160] [161] [162] The author uses pulsed feeding through an indwelling small-gauge feeding tube. In many foals these tubes stay in place for weeks and cause no problems as the foals are returned to their dams for sucking or are trained to drink from a bottle or bucket.",

The now routine, well-validated use of antenatal steroid and artificial surfactant therapies has contributed greatly to the enhanced survival of this patient population, although the use of these particular therapies is not common or frequently indicated in the equine NICU. 163, 164 However, with improved care, outcomes in the equine NICU population have improved also, with survival of premature patients in many NICUs exceeding 80%. 21 In the equine population, gestation length is much more flexible than in the human population; however, the definition of the term prematurity needs reexamination. Traditionally, prematurity is defined as a preterm birth of less than 320 days of gestation in the horse. Given the variability of gestation length in the horse, ranging from 310 days to more than 370 days in some mares, a mare with a usual gestation length of 315 days possibly could have a term foal at 313 days, whereas a mare with a usual gestation length of 365 days may have a premature foal at 340 days, considered the normal gestation length. Foals that are born postterm but are small are termed dysmature; a postmature foal is a postterm foal that has a normal axial skeletal size but is thin to emaciated. Dysmature foals may have been classified in the past as small for gestational age and are thought to have suffered placental insufficiency, whereas postmature foals are usually normal foals that have been retained too long in utero, perhaps because of an abnormal signaling of readiness for birth, and have outgrown their somewhat aged placenta. Postmature foals become more abnormal the longer they are maintained, also may suffer from placental insufficiency, and are represented best by the classic foal born to a mare ingesting endophyteinfested fescue. 165 Box 19-3 compares the characteristics of premature/dysmature foals with those of postmature foals.",

Additional causes include iatrogenic causes such as early elective induction of labor based on inaccurate breeding dates or misinterpretation of late-term colic or uterine bleeding as ineffective labor. Most causes remain in the category of idiopathic, with no discernible precipitating factor. Despite lack of an obvious cause, premature labor and delivery does not just happen, and even if undetermined, the cause may continue to affect the foal in the postparturient period. All body systems may be affected by prematurity, dysmaturity, and postmaturity, and thorough evaluation of all body systems is necessary. Respiratory failure is common in these foals, although the cause usually is not surfactant deficiency. Immaturity of the respiratory tract, poor control of respiratory vessel tone, and weak respiratory muscles combined with poorly compliant lungs and a greatly compliant chest wall contribute to respiratory failure in these cases. Most require oxygen supplementation and positional support for optimal oxygenation and ventilation. One must extend effort to maintain these \"floppy foals\" in sternal recumbency. Some foals may require mechanical ventilation. These foals also require cardiovascular support but are frequently unresponsive to commonly used pressors and inotropes: dopamine, dobutamine, epinephrine, and vasopressin. Careful use of these drugs and judicious intravenous fluid therapy are necessary. The goal should not be one of achieving specific pressure values (e.g., mean arterial pressure of 60 mm Hg) but of adequate perfusion. Renal function, reflected in low urine output, is frequently poor initially in these cases because of delay in making the transition from fetal to neonatal glomerular filtration rates. 166 The delay can result from true failure of transition or from hypoxic/ischemic insult. One should approach fluid therapy cautiously in these cases; initial fluid restriction may be in order to avoid fluid overload. Many premature/dysmature/postmature foals have suffered a hypoxic insult and have all of the disorders associated with PAS, including HIE. Treatment is similar to that of term foals with these problems. These foals also are predisposed to secondary bacterial infection and must be examined frequently for signs consistent with early sepsis or nosocomial infection.",

            "text": "Concensus criteria conferences 1 in the early 1990s defined sepsis and septic shock for human beings. 174, 175 Sepsis was defined as the systemic response to infection manifested by two or more of the following conditions as a result of infection: a) temperature >38\u00b0C or <36\u00b0; b) heart rate >90 beats/min; c) respiratory rate >20 breaths per minute or PaCO 2 <32 torr; and d) white blood cell count >12,000 cell/\u00b5l, <4,000 cell/\u00b5l, or >10% immature (band) forms. Septic shock was defined as sepsis induced hypotension or the requirement for vasopressors/ionotropes to maintain blood pressure despite adequate fluid resuscitation along with the presence of perfusion abnormalities that may include lactic acidosis, oliguria, or acute alteration in mental status. These definitions are broadly acceptable and applicable to neonatal sepsis in foals, and many of the treatment modalities in human medicine have been applied in some manner to the equine neonatal patient. Additional definitions that have come into vogue that are actually useful at times, include the following: SIRS, the systemic inflammatory response system; MODS, multiple organ system dysfuction; and MOFS, multiple organ failure syndrome. (SIRS is sick, MODS is sicker, and MOFS is dying.) The compensatory response syndrome (CARS) ideally balances SIRS and keeps it from becoming detrimental. If balance is achieved, recovery is possible. Imbalance progresses to septic shock, MODS, and MOFS. In horses, MODS is manifested most commonly as renal failure, hepatic failure, central nervous system dysfunction, and disseminated intravascular coagulation. Managing the septic patient involves early recognition of all the potential alphabet combinations and supporting the patient or intervening in the face of multiple clinical consequences, termed CHAOS (Cardiovacular compromise; Homeostasis; Apoptosis; Organ dysfunction; Suppression of the immune system). 176 Inflammatory mediators are involved in all these processes and can be beneficial or detrimental, depending on timing and opposing responses. Neutrophils, platelets, lymphocytes, macrophages, and endothelial cells are involved, and the implicated inflammatory molecules grow daily in numbers.",

For the purposes here, the discussion is limited to bacterial sepsis, but the foal also is susceptible to viral and fungal sepsis, which can appear similar to bacterial sepsis. Failure of passive transfer (FPT) of immunity can contribute to the development of sepsis in a foal at risk. 177, 178 Testing for and treating FPT has received attention in the veterinary literature. It remains true, however, that foals presented to NICUs that have an ultimate diagnosis of sepsis have FPT. 16, 19 The current recommendation is that foals have IgG levels greater than or equal to 800 mg/dl for passive transfer to be considered adequate. Other risk factors for the development of sepsis include any adverse advents at the time of birth, maternal illness, or any abnormalities in the foal. Although the umbilicus frequently is implicated as a major portal of entry for infectious organisms in the foal, the gastrointestinal tract may be the primary site of entry. 179 Other possible portals of entry include the respiratory tract and wounds.",

Intravenously administered amikacin and penicillin are good first-line choices, but one should monitor renal function closely. Other first-line antimicrobial choices might include high-dose ceftiofur sodium or ticarcillin/clavulanic acid. One should treat failure of passive transfer if present. One should provide intranasal oxygen insufflation at 5 to 10 L/min even if hypoxemia is not present to decrease the work of breathing and provide support for the increased oxygen demands associated with sepsis. 183 Should arterial blood gas analysis reveal significant hypoventilation, one may administer caffeine orally or per rectum to increase central respiratory drive. Mechanical ventilation may be necessary in cases of severe respiratory involvement such as with acute lung injury or acute respiratory distress syndrome. If the foal is hypotensive, one may administer pressor agents or inotropes by constant rate infusion (Table 19-6) . Inotrope and pressor therapy generally is restricted to referral centers where these drugs can be given as constant rate infusions and blood pressure can be monitored closely.

The causative organism is Clostridium botulinum, an anaerobic organism. Although affected adults usually acquire the disease by ingestion of preformed toxin elucidated from the organism, in the foal less than 8 months of age the organism can survive and multiply in the gastointestinal tract and produce necrotic foci within the liver, giving the foal constant exposure to newly formed toxin. The horse is exquisitely sensitive to the toxin, and only small quantities of toxin are required to produce clinical signs and death in affected animals. The \u03b5-toxin of C. botulinum binds to the presynaptic membrane of motor neurons and prevents transmission of impulses by blocking the release of acetylcholine from the presynaptic vessicles. This block produces the clinical signs of muscle weakness, manifested in foals as trembling (shaker foals) or acute recumbency. 188 Pupillary dilation, dysphagia, tremors, recumbency, and terminal respiratory distress caused by respiratory muscle paralysis occur. Foals can be found acutely dead. In endemic areas (the Northeast and mid-Atlantic regions of United States), for these foals to be evaluated first as having colic is not unusual.",

Two forms of the disease are described in foals: the fulminant form, in which the foal is found acutely dead, and the subacute form.

The incubation period is short, and the mare is thought to be the carrier. [192] [193] [194] [195] [196] Clinical signs range from acute death to depression, fever, and pronounced icterus. The feces of affected foals may appear white to grey because of the lack of bile. Clinicopathologic abnormalities include leukopenia, hyperfibrinogenemia, metabolic acidosis, and hypoglycemia. 197, 198 Liver lesions at postmortem are characterized microscopically by multiple foci of necrosis. One usually can demonstrate variable numbers of elongated, slender intracytoplasmic bacilli within hepatocytes bordering the necrotic foci. Infiltration of the portal triads with inflammatory cells and biliary duct hyperplasia and degeneration are observable. The bacillus also occurs in association with myocardial lesions. Lesions in the intestine are characterised by mucosal necrosis with inflammatory cell infiltration, increased mucus production, submucosal lymphoid hyperplasia, and submucosal hemorrhage. Necrosis of lymphoid follicles, congestion, and hemorrhage can be present in the spleen and mesenteric lymph nodes. 196 Affected foals may have a profound metabolic acidosis that is unresponsive to treatment. The clinical course is short, and most affected foals die within a few hours of developing neurologic signs.",

            "text": "Causes, diagnosis, and treatment of FPT of immunity are covered in detail elsewhere in this text. Failure of passive transfer occurs when a foal fails to ingest a significant quantity of good-quality colostrum. Failure of passive transfer may occur by several mechanisms: failure of the foal to suck from the dam for any reason and failure of the dam to produce sufficient quantity of quality colostrum. Box 19-4 presents causes of FPT. Several methods are available for measuring IgG concentration in blood; the most reliable are enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and single radial immunodiffusion technology-based tests. [223] [224] [225] [226] [227] [228] [229] Foals usually are tested at 24 hours of age, but one may test the foal earlier if colostrum ingestion has occurred and a concern exists regarding the passive transfer of immunity status of the foal, recognizing that additional increases in IgG concentration may occur with additional time. 230, 231 The concentration of IgG in the blood of the foal has been used as an indicator of the adequacy of passive transfer, but the actual blood concentration at which FPT is diagnosed has been challenged in recent years. [232] [233] [234] Foals with sepsis commonly have a serum IgG concentration of less than 800 mg/dl. 16, 19 Foals with FPT are more likely to die from sepsis. 177, 178, [235] [236] [237] One should consider the IgG concentration only as a marker for adequacy of colostral absorption. All the measured IgG is unlikely to be directed against the specific pathogen affecting any particular neonate, and IgG is not the only immune protection afforded the foal by colostrum. Many factors that confer local and more general immunity to the newborn are present in colostrum; these include growth factors, cytokines, lactoferrins, CD14, leukocytes, and other yet to be described proteins. [240] [241] [242] [243] [244] By considering IgG a marker of adequacy for passive transfer, similar to \u03b3-glutamyltransferase in calves, the clinician can make choices for replacement that are more beneficial to the patient. 245 After one identifies FPT in a foal, treatment depends on the current condition of the foal and its local environment. Foals not presently ill and on well-managed farms with low population density and low prevalence of disease may not require treatment if their IgG concentration is between 400 and 800 mg/dl. Critically ill neonates with FPT in an equine NICU are by definition ill and in an environment with high disease prevalence. These patients require immediate treatment of FPT and frequent reassessment of their passive immunity status. Critically ill foals often fail to demonstrate the expected increase in blood IgG concentration based on grams of IgG administered per kilogram of body mass compared with healthy, colostrum-deprived foals. 235, 246, 247 Sick foals also demonstrate a more rapid decline in IgG concentration than do healthy foals because they use and catabolize available protein.",

[248] [249] [250] Depending on the age of the foal and the maturity and function of the gastrointestinal tract, this treatment may be effective. Many NICUs and large breeding farms maintain colostrum banks for this purpose. One should administer plasma intravenously if the foal is not expected to absorb additional colostrum or if the enteral route is unavailable. Commercially available hyperimmune plasma products designed for use in foals are available and can be stored frozen. Plasma and banked colostrum should be stored in a non-frost-free freezer to minimize protein loss associated with freeze-thaw cycling. 251 One should administer plasma through special tubing with an in-line filter and should monitor patients closely for transfusion reactions. 252 One may use serum and concentrated IgG products, but the practitioner should be aware that many of these products focus on IgG retention and not on other factors associated with passive transfer of immunity. One should measure IgG concentration after transfusion and provide additional plasma as necessary. Administration of plasma to critically ill foals without FPT may be beneficial through provision of other factors present in the plasma. In these situations, fresh frozen plasma or fresh plasma may be best, particularly if transfusion of clotting proteins is desired.",

            "text": "The natural development of neonatal isoerythrolysis has several prerequisites. First, the foal must inherit from the sire and express an erythrocyte antigen (alloantigen) that is not possessed by the mare. Blood group incompatibility between the foal and dam is not particularly uncommon, but most blood group factors are not strongly antigenic under the conditions of exposure through previous parturition or placental leakage. Factor Aa of the A system and factor Qa of the Q system are highly immunogenic, however, and nearly all cases of neonatal isoerythrolysis are caused by antibodies to these alloantigens. The exception is in the case of mule foals in which a specific donkey factor has been implicated. [253] [254] [255] Mares that are negative for Aa or Qa or both are considered to be at risk for producing a foal with neonatal isoerythrolysis. The risk involves approximately 19% and 17% of Thoroughbred and Standardbred mares, respectively. Second, and perhaps most important, the mare must become sensitized to the incompatible alloantigen and produce antibodies to it. The mechanism for this is not known in many instances but generally is believed to result from transplacental hemorrhage during a previous pregnancy involving a foal with the same incompatible blood factor. 255 Sensitization via transplacental contamination with fetal erythrocytes earlier in the current pregnancy is possible, but an anamnestic response is generally necessary to induce a pathogenic quantity of alloantibodies. 256 Ten percent of Thoroughbred mares and 20% of Standardbred mares have antibodies to the Ca blood group antigen without known exposure to erythrocytes. 255 Some common environmental antigen is postulated possibly to lead to production of anti-Ca antibodies. Data suggest that these natural antibodies may suppress an immune response to other blood group antigens because mares negative for Aa that have anti-Ca antibodies often do not produce antibodies to Aa of the erythrocytes in their foals that also contain Ca antigen. This antibodymediated immunosuppression is thought to result from the destruction of fetal cells before the dam mounts an immune response to other cell surface antigens. Natural alloantibodies have not been associated with neonatal isoerythrolysis in horses.",

Unlike the human neonate, which acquires alloantibodies in utero and thus is born with hemolytic disease, the foal is protected from these antibodies before birth by the complex epitheliochorial placentation of the mare. Thus the final criterion for foal development of neonatal isoerythrolysis is ingestion in the first 24 hours of life of colostrumcontaining alloantibodies specific for foal alloantigens. Immunoglobulin-coated foal erythrocytes are removed prematurely from circulation by the mononuclear phagocyte system or are lysed intravascularly via complement. The rapidity of development and severity of clinical signs are determined by the amount of alloantibodies that was absorbed and their innate activity. Alloantibodies against Aa are potent hemolysins and generally are associated with a more severe clinical syndrome than antibodies against Qa or other alloantigens. The highest alloantibody titers are likely to be produced by mares that were sensitized in a previous pregnancy and then subsequently reexposed to the same erythrocyte antigen during the last trimester of the current pregnancy. Prior sensitization of a mare by blood transfusion or other exposure to equine blood products may predispose to neonatal isoerythrolysis. 256",

One must base the definitive diagnosis of neonatal isoerythrolysis on demonstration of alloantibodies in the serum or colostrum of the dam that are directed against foal erythrocytes. The most reliable serodiagnostic test for neonatal isoerythrolysis is the hemolytic cross-match using washed foal erythrocytes, mare serum, and an exogenous source of absorbed complement (usually from rabbits). 5 Although this test is impractical in a practice setting, a number of qualified laboratories routinely perform this diagnostic service. The direct antiglobulin test (Coombs' test) may demonstrate the presence of antibodies on foal erythrocytes; however, false negatives occur frequently. Most human or veterinary hematology laboratories can perform routine saline agglutination cross-match between mare serum and foal cells. Because some equine alloantibodies act only as hemolysins, agglutination tests may be falsely negative.

The minimum necessary amount of milk is 1% of body mass every 2 hours (e.g., a 50-kg foal should receive 500 ml or 1 pint of mare's milk or milk replacer every 2 hours). The udder of the mare should be stripped regularly (at least every 4 hours) and the milk discarded. In most instances, clinical signs are not apparent until after the foal is 24 hours old, when colostral antibodies have been depleted or the absorptive capacity of the foal's intestine for immunoglobulin has diminished. Withholding milk at this point is of minimal benefit.",

One can pellet the erythrocytes of the dam from blood collected in acid-citrate-dextrose solution by centrifugation or gravity and then aseptically draw off the plasma by suction apparatus or syringe and replace it with sterile isotonic (0.9%) saline. One thoroughly mixes the cells with the saline and then repeats the centrifugation or sedimentation, followed by aspiration and discarding of the saline. One should perform this washing process at least three times. One then can suspend the packed erythrocytes in an equal volume of isotonic saline for administration.

Mares negative for Aa and Qa alloantigens are most at risk of producing affected foals, thus they should be identified by blood-typing. Subsequently, breeding of these mares may be restricted to Aa-and Qa-negative stallions, thus eliminating the possibility of producing an affected foal. In breeds with a high prevalence of Aa or Qa alloantigens (e.g., Thoroughbreds and Arabians), a stallion negative for these and suitable based on other criteria may be difficult to identify. If these \"at risk\" mares are bred as desired, their serum should be screened in the last month of pregnancy for the presence of erythrocyte alloantibodies. One must test mares with low or equivocal titers closer to the time of parturition. If one detects alloantibodies, the colostrum of the dam should be withheld and the foal then should be provided with an alternative colostrum source. Maternal alloantibodies to Ca do not appear to mediate neonatal isoerythrolysis in foals and actually may be preventive by removing potentially sensitizing cells from the circulation 56 ; therefore one should not deprive foals of colostrum from mares possessing anti-Ca antibodies, even when Ca is present on their erythrocytes. Rarely, the antigens De, Ua, Pa, and Ab have been associated with neonatal isoerythrolysis in foals; however, to consider mares without these alloantigens to be at risk for neonatal isoerythrolysis is not practical.",

One confirms the diagnosis by appropriate testing for platelet-and neutrophil-associated antibody. 264 One must rule out other causes of neonatal thrombocytopenia and neutropenia, particularly sepsis. Foals born to the mare in the future seem likely to be at risk for developing similar problems, and one should treat future foals as one treats neonatal isoerythrolysis foals: prevent sucking from the dam and provide an alternate source of passive immunity in the form of banked colostrum or intravenous plasma. One should provide an alternative nutritional source, such as foal milk replacer, to the foal for the first 48 hours of life and should muzzle the foal while it is in the company of its dam for that period of time.

            "text": "Five primary means by which hypoxemia may develop are (1) low concentration of oxygen in the inspired air such as in high altitude or in an error mixing ventilator gas; (2) hypoventilation; (3) ventilation/perfusion mismatch; (4) diffusion limitation; and (5) intrapulmonary or intracardiac right-to-left shunting of blood. Hypoxemia is not an uncommon finding in neonates but must be evaluated in terms of the current age of the foal and its position. 15, [273] [274] [275] [276] One also must consider the difficulty encountered in obtaining the sample because severe struggling can affect the arterial blood gas results. Table 19 -8 presents normal arterial blood gas parameters for varying ages of foals. The normal foal has a small shunt fraction (~10%) that persists for the first few days of life and contributes slightly to a blunted response to breathing 100% oxygen compared with the adult. Hypoxemia frequently occurs in foals with prematurity, PAS, and sepsis, although other conditions also result in hypoxemia in the neonate. In the early stage of sepsis associated hypoxemia, PaCO 2 may be within normal limits or decreased if the foal is hyperventilating for any reason. If the lung is involved significantly in the underlying pathologic condition, such as with severe pneumonia, acute lung injury, or acute respiratory distress syndrome, increased PaCO 2 may well be present, representing respiratory failure. 277 Hypoxemia usually is treated with intranasal humidified oxygen insufflation at 4 to 10 L/min. Hypercapnia is not a simple matter to treat. One must try to distinguish between acute and chronic hypercapnia. Acute hypercapnia usually is accompanied by a dramatic decrease in blood pH of 0.008 pH units for each 1 mm Hg increase in PaCO 2 . This acidemia can promote circulatory collapse, particularly in the concurrently hypoxemic and/or hypovolemic patient. The effects of more chronic CO 2 retention are less obvious because the time course allows for adaptation. The pH change is less, about 0.003 pH units per 1 mm Hg increase in PaCO 2 , because it is balanced by enhanced renal absorption of bicarbonate by the proximal renal tubule. Most foals with acute respiratory distress are in the acute stages of respiratory failure, but chronic adaptation begins to occur within 6 to 12 hours and is maximal in 3 to 5 days. One will note an increase in bicarbonate, particularly if the acidemia is primarily respiratory in origin. Intravenous administration of sodium bicarbonate to correct respiratory acidosis/ acidemia should be done cautiously in these foals because CO 2 retention may only be increased. Also, one should remember that 1 mEq of sodium is administered with each mEq of bicarbonate and hypernatremia has been seen in foals treated exuberantly with sodium bicarbonate. Foals with hypercapnia of several days' duration also may develop a blunted respiratory drive to increased CO 2 . In these foals, oxygen administration, although essential to treat hypoxemia, may further depress ventilation and further decrease pH. This effect is caused by a loss of hypoxic drive following oxygen therapy. One should consider these foals candidates for mechanical ventilation if the PaCO 2 is greater than 70 mm Hg or is contributing to the poor condition of the foal, such as causing significant pH changes. If hypercapnia is caused by central depression of ventilation, as frequently occurs in foals with PAS, one can administer caffeine (10 mg/kg loading dose; then 2.5 mg/kg as needed) per rectum or orally in foals with normal gastrointestinal function. Other clinicians may recommend continuous rate infusions of doxapram hydrochoride (Dopram; 400 mg/total dose at 0.05 mg/ kg/min) for these foals. If this therapy fails, one should consider mechanical ventilation. Mechanical ventilation of foals with central respiratory depression is rewarding and may be necessary only for a few hours to days. A special category is the foal with botulism exhibiting respiratory failure caused by respiratory muscle paralysis. These foals do well with mechanical ventilation, although the duration of mechanical ventilation is more prolonged, frequently more than 1 week. Foals with primary metabolic alkalosis usually have compensatory respiratory acidosis. Treatment of hypercapnia is not necessary in these cases because it is in response to the metabolic condition. These foals do not respond to caffeine, and they should not be ventilated mechanically if this is the only disorder present.",

            "text": "In the neonate, bacterial pneumonia usually results from sepsis or aspiration during sucking. Foals with sepsis can develop acute lung injury or acute respiratory distress syndrome as part of the systemic response to sepsis, and this is frequently a contributor to the demise of foals in septic shock. The best way to diagnose bacterial pneumonia is by cytologic examination and culture of a transtracheal aspirate, but blood culture may aid in early identification of the causative organism and allow for early institution of directed antimicrobial therapy. A second frequent cause of bacterial pneumonia in the neonate is aspiration caused by a poor suck reflex or dysphagia associated with PAS, sepsis, or weakness. One must take care to ensure that aspiration is not iatrogenic in foals being bottle fed. Auscultation over the trachea while the foal is sucking helps identify occult aspiration. One should suspect occult aspiration pneumonia in any critically ill neonate that is being bottle fed or is sucking on its own that has unexplained fever, fails to gain weight, or has a persistently increased fibrinogen level. Older foals develop bacterial pneumonia, frequently following an earlier viral infection. 278 Bacterial pneumonia is discussed in depth elsewhere in this text, but a few comments specific to the foal are necessary. One should auscultate and percuss the thorax of the foal, but results may not correlate closely with the severity of disease. The most commonly isolated bacterial organism in foal pneumonia is Streptococcus zooepidemicus, and one may isolate it alone or as a component of a mixed infection. [278] [279] [280] Transtracheal aspirate for culture and cytologic examination is recommended because mixed gram-positive and gram-negative infections are common, and antimicrobial susceptibility patterns can be unpredictable. One should split the obtained aspirate and submit samples for bacterial culture, virus isolation, and cytologic examination. Additional diagnostics include radiography, ultrasonography, and serial determination of white blood cell counts (with differential) and blood fibrinogen concentrations. Treatment includes administration of appropriate antimicrobial therapy. Some foals may benefit from nebulization with saline or other local products. Ascarid larval migration through the lung can mimic bacterial pneumonia. 281 In these cases the foal may not respond to antimicrobial therapy and should be dewormed with ivermectin. Deworming the mare within 1 month of parturition and frequent deworming of the foal prevent ascarid migration pneumonia in most foals.",

This pneumonia of young foals was described first in 1923. 282 The organism originally was known as Corynebacterium equi and is a gram-positive pleomorphic coccobacillus usually less than 1 \u00b5m in diameter and 2 \u00b5m in length. The organisms frequently are associated in L-and V-shaped clusters that have been termed Chinese character formations. R. equi has an acid-fast staining characteristic under some growing circumstances because of the presence of mycolic acid in its cell wall, similar to Mycobacterium and Nocardia species. Mycolic acid promotes granuloma formation. The organism is able to multiply in and destroy macrophages as it prevents phagosome lysosome fusion. 283, 284 Much attention has been paid to this organism in recent years, given its propensity to produce enzootic and epizootic outbreaks of disease. The organism is thought to be primarily an opportunistic pathogen, and it lives in the soil of most geographic areas. Foals are affected most frequently between the ages of 1 and 6 months, when maternally derived immunity has begun to wane. The disease is insidious, and foals may have significant pulmonary involvement before developing noticeable clinical signs.",

Knowledge of the virulence mechanisms of R. equi was speculative until the discovery of the virulence plasmid. 289 As opposed to most environmental R. equi organisms, isolates from clinically affected foals typically contain 85-to 90-kb plasmids encoding an immunogenic virulence-associated protein (VapA) that is expressed on the bacterial surface in a temperature-regulated manner. 290 Plasmid-cured bacteria lose their ability to replicate and survive in macrophages and are cleared from the lungs within 2 weeks of intrabronchial challenge without producing pneumonia. 291 However, expression of VapA alone is not sufficient to restore the virulence phenotype. Six other genes have approximately 40% overall amino acid identity with VapA, and the identification of multiple genes with considerable homology suggests these genes constitute a virulence-associated gene family in R. equi. 292 Other candidates for virulence factors include capsular polysaccharides and cholesterol oxidase, choline phosphohydrolase, and phospholipase C exoenzymes (\"equi factors\"), but their roles have not been defined clearly.",

Neutrophilic leukocytosis (>12,000 cells/\u00b5l), with or without monocytosis, is common. 294 Thoracic radiography is a useful diagnostic aid, frequently revealing a prominent alveolar pattern with poorly defined regional consolidation and/or abscessation. Ultrasonography is a helpful diagnostic tool when the disease involves peripheral lung tissue. Although a number of serologic tests have been described, serologic diagnosis of R. equi infections is controversial and difficult because exposure of foals to this organism at a young age leads to production of antibody without necessarily producing clinical disease. 295, 296 Serologic tests may be more useful at the farm level to detect overall exposure than at the individual level. Bacteriologic culture combined with cytologic examination of a tracheobronchial aspirate remains the most definitive method for accurate diagnosis of R. equi pneumonia. However, foals without clinical disease exposed to contaminated environments may have R. equi in their tracheae from inhalation of contaminated dust; therefore one should interpret culture results in the context of the overall case presentation. 297 Culture results in one study were as sensitive as polymerase chain reaction-based assays and offered the advantage of allowing in vitro antimicrobial susceptibility testing. 298 However, polymerase chain reaction is likely to be a useful tool, and results from a second trial suggest the assay is more sensitive and specific than culture of tracheobronchial aspirates for diagnosis. 299 The combination of erythromycin and rifampin has become the treatment of choice for R. equi infections in foals, and the combination reduces the likelihood of resistance to either drug. The recommended dosage regimen for rifampin is 5 mg/kg every 12 hours or 10 mg/kg every 24 hours orally. The recommended dose of estolate or ethylsuccinate esters of erythromycin is 25 mg/kg every 8 or 12 hours orally. 300 Recently, azithromycin has been recommended for treatment of R. equi infection at a dosage of 10 mg/kg orally every 24 hours for 5 to 7 days and then every other day. 301 Alternatively, clarithromycin at 7.5 mg/kg every 12 hours orally, in combination with rifampin, may be therapeutically effective. Severely affected foals may require intranasal oxygen insufflation, intravenous fluid support, and nutritional support. Treatment generally continues for 4 to 10 weeks until all clinical and laboratory evidence of infection is resolved. Although well tolerated by most foals, erythromycin can result in soft feces. This diarrhea is generally self-limiting and does not require cessation of therapy, but one should monitor affected foals carefully. An idiosyncratic reaction characterized by severe hyperthermia and tachypnea has been described in foals treated with erythromycin during periods of hot weather. 302 Affected foals should be moved to a colder environment and treated with antipyretic drugs and alcohol baths if necessary. Clostridium difficile enterocolitis has been reported in the dams of nursing foals treated with erythromycin given orally. 303 The dam is exposed to active erythromycin by coprophagy or by drinking from a communal water source where the foal has \"rinsed\" its mouth.",

Equine herpesvirus 1 is probably the most clinically important, but outbreaks of EVA in neonates have occurred and are devastating. 27, [313] [314] [315] [316] [317] [318] Adenovirus is reported sporadically and as a problem in Arabian foals with severe combined immunodeficiency. [319] [320] [321] In the neonate, infection with EHV-1 or EVA is almost uniformly fatal and antemortem diagnosis is difficult, even once an outbreak on a particular farm is identified. Several factors appear common to foals with EHV-1, including icterus, leukopenia, neutropenia, and petechial hemorrhage, but these problems also are identified in foals with severe sepsis. 315, 322, 323 The antiviral drug acyclovir (10 to 16 mg/kg orally or per rectum 4 to 5 times per day) has been used in cases of EHV-1 in neonates, with some evidence of efficacy in mildly affected foals or foals affected after birth. 323 If viral pneumonia is a possibility, one should collect blood and tracheal aspirates at presentation for bacterial and virus isolation. The lungs of foals with EHV-1 or EVA are noncompliant, and pulmonary edema may be present. Mechanical ventilation of these cases may prolong life, but death is generally inevitable because of the magnitude of damage to the lungs. Foals suspected of having EHV-1 or EVA should be isolated because they may be shedding large quantities of virus and pose a threat to other neonates and pregnant mares. Foals with EVA generally are born to seronegative mares, and intravenous treatment with plasma with a high titer against EVA may prove beneficial because passive immunity appears to have a large role in protection against this disease in neonates. 318, 324 Older foals and weanlings may be affected by herpesviruses. Disease is usually mild, although a fatal pulmonary vasculotropic form of the disease has been described recently in young horses. 325, 326 The clinical signs of disease are indistinguishable from influenza and include a dry cough, fever, and serous to mucopurulent nasal discharge, particularly if secondary bacterial infection occurs. Rhinitis, pharyngitis, and tracheitis may be present. Treatment of affected foals is primarily supportive. Foals also may become infected with EHV-2. The predominant clinical signs are fever and lymphoid hyperplasia with pharyngitis. 327, 328 Diagnosis is by virus isolation.",

Rib fractures frequently are found during physical examination by palpation of the ribs or by auscultation over the fracture sites. One can confirm the diagnosis by radiographic and ultrasonographic evaluation. Often multiple ribs are affected on one side of the chest. Specific treatment is generally unnecessary, but direct pressure on the thorax should be avoided in all cases. Some specific patients may benefit from surgical stabilization of some fractures, particularly those fractures overlying the heart. Pneumothorax can occur spontaneously or following excessive positive pressure ventilation 329 or following tracheostomy surgery or trauma. Any foal being ventilated mechanically that suddenly has respiratory distress and hypoxemia should be evaluated for pneumothorax. Diagnosis is by auscultation and percussion of the thorax, but one can confirm the diagnosis with radiographic and ultrasonographic evaluation of the thorax. Needle aspiration of air from the pleural space also confirms the diagnosis. Treatment is required in cases in which clinical signs are moderate to severe or progressive and involves closed suction of the pleural space.",

Clinical signs of increased respiratory rate and rectal temperature develop within a few days of birth and may persist for several weeks.

Affected foals have acute respiratory distress with significant tachypnea, dyspnea, nostril flare, and increased inspiratory and expiratory effort. Auscultation reveals a cacophony of abnormal sounds including crackles and polyphonic wheezes in all lung fields. Loud bronchial sounds are audible over central airways, and bronchovesicular sounds are lost peripherally. Affected foals are cyanotic, febrile, and unwilling to move or eat. Foals may be found acutely dead. Laboratory abnormalities include leukocytosis, hyperfibrinogenemia, and hypoxemia with hypercapneic acidosis. Foals can be dehydrated severely and have coagulation changes consistent with disseminated intravascular coagulation. Hypoxic injury to other organs, primarily the kidneys and liver, can occur. Chest radiographs reveal a prominent interstitial pattern overlying a bronchoalveolar pattern that is distributed diffusely throughout the lung. This syndrome is a respiratory emergency. Treatment is broad-based and includes administration of oxygen, nonsteroidal antiinflammatory agents, broad-spectrum antimicrobial therapy, nebulization, judicious intravenous fluid therapy, nutritional support, and corticosteroid therapy. One must manage hyperthermia in the foal. Corticosteroid therapy appears to have been lifesaving in most of the reported surviving foals. Because this syndrome is associated with high environmental temperatures in some areas, prevention involves control of ambient temperatures, not transporting foals during hot weather, and keeping foals out of direct sun on hot days, particularly foals being treated with erythromycin for suspected or confirmed R. equi infection. 332",

The dorsal wall of the bladder has been reported to be a frequent disruption site, with the ventral wall less likely to be involved. 336 The urachus appears to be the next most commonly affected structure. A few cases of ureteral and urethral defects have been reported. 336, 337 Sepsis does not appear to favor one site over the others. 338 The pathophysiology of uroperitoneum is not yet understood fully. The high pressure exerted on a full bladder during parturition once was thought to be the main cause. Full bladder and obstruction caused by a partial umbilical cord at parturition, strenuous exercise, and external trauma have been reported as causes. 339 A few reports describe smooth and noninflamed edges of torn tissue, suggesting the possibility of congenital bladder wall defects. 338, 340, 341 Sepsis leading to urinary tract rupture and uroperitoneum may occur in foals hospitalized for a variety of unrelated problems. The onset of clinical signs of uroperitoneum may be insidious in these foals, and diagnosis may be less obvious. 338 Clinical signs associated with uroperitoneum in the neonatal foal typically include straining to urinate, dribbling urine, and a stretched-out stance. Weakness, tachycardia, tachypnea, and not sucking well are also common. A distended abdomen may be evident, and one may feel a fluid wave on ballottement of the abdomen. Occasionally, urine accumulates in the scrotum and should not be confused with hernia. Foals also may show signs of sepsis, including fever, injected mucous membranes, diarrhea, and disease of other body systems.",

            "text": "Laboratory findings vary depending on the duration of the uroperitoneum and on the presence and severity of sepsis. Classic findings include hyperkalemia, hyponatremia, and hypochloremia arising from equilibration of urine electrolytes and water with blood across the peritoneal membrane. [335] [336] [337] The usual foal diet of milk, which is high in potassium and low in sodium, promotes the electrolyte abnormalities. Foals that develop uroperitoneum while receiving intravenous fluids may not have classic electrolyte imbalances at the time clinical signs are recognized. 338 Increased serum creatinine concentration is often present, whereas blood urea nitrogen concentrations occasionally, but not consistently, are increased. [335] [336] [337] Metabolic acidosis and hypoxemia may be present. Some patients also have serum hypoosmolality. 335 One should test foals for failure of passive transfer. One of the most sensitive laboratory tests for uroperitoneum is the ratio of peritoneal to serum creatinine. A ratio greater than or equal to 2:1 is considered diagnostic of uroperitoneum. One should collect peritoneal fluid and test it for creatinine concentration, as well as for cytologic findings, culture, and sensitivity. Cytologic evaluation of peritoneal fluid is necessary to identify concurrent peritonitis or other gastrointestinal compromise. One should perform an electrocardiogram on initial evaluation of a foal with suspected uroperitoneum because hyperkalemia may result in bradycardia, increased duration of the QRS complex, a shortened Q-T interval, increased P-wave duration, prolonged P-R interval, or atrioventricular conduction disturbances. Other possible cardiac sequelae to hyperkalemia include cardiac arrest, third-degree atrioventricular block, ventricular premature contractions, and ventricular fibrillation. 337, 340 For any foal exhibiting signs of dypsnea, tachypnea, or hypoxemia, one should have thoracic radiographs taken before induction of anesthesia to rule out pleural effusion, pneumonia, or acute respiratory distress syndrome, which could complicate ventilation and oxygenation during anesthesia and the postoperative period. Ultrasonography has become the tool of choice in the diagnosis of uroperitoneum and is a useful tool available to the practitioner. 342 One can image free peritoneal fluid readily, and tears within the bladder are readily visible. The empty bladder with a significant defect, in a fluid-filled abdomen, will collapse on itself and often have a U shape. One also can visualize urachal and urethral lesions. Six of eight foals in one study had urinary tract lesions identified sonographically, and all 31 foals of another study underwent sonographic evaluation, and a significant correlation between ultrasonographic findings and location of the lesion at surgery existed. 336, 338 Initial treatment aims to stabilize the patient and correct any electrolyte and acid-base abnormalities and provide fluid volume replacement. One should use 0.9% or 0.45% saline with 5% dextrose until laboratory data are available. A potassium concentration of greater than 5.5 mEq/L can be life threatening. One can manage hyperkalemia by peritoneal drainage to decrease whole-body potassium stores using teat cannulae, Foley catheters, large-gauge (16 or 14) intravenous catheters, or human peritoneal dialysis catheters. Fluid replacement at least should equal the amount of fluid removed from the abdomen to prevent acute hypotension caused by expansion of previously collapsed capillary beds. Abdominal drainage also helps ventilation and decreases the work of breathing by decreasing pressure on the diaphragm. One may administer calcium gluconate, glucose, sodium bicarbonate, or insulin intravenously to decrease serum potassium concentrations. These maneuvers do not correct the whole-body potassium overload, however, and once therapy is discontinued, hyperkalemia can reappear until the urine is removed from the abdomen. One should correct hyponatremia slowly. Because of the real possibility of concurrent sepsis, one should obtain blood cultures before preoperative administration of antimicrobials. Broad-spectrum coverage (penicillin and amikacin or ceftiofur sodium) is recommended until culture results become available. One should perform therapeutic drug monitoring when using aminoglycoside therapy. However, the peak value may be depressed because of the increased volume of distribution represented by the volume of urine in the abdomen, so one should not make dose adjustment based on a low peak until obtaining a new peak after surgical correction of the uroperitoneum. One should treat foals with failure of passive transfer with adequate volumes of intravenously administered plasma.",

However, the closure of the body wall defect at the umbilicus was studied in relation to the development of umbilical herniae in a large group of normal foals followed from birth until 5 months of age or from birth until 11 months of age. 354 At birth, approximately half of these foals had a defect in the body wall at the umbilicus that was termed a palpable umbilical ring. In 18 foals this defect disappeared within 4 days, but in one foal the ring did not close and a hernial sac with abdominal contents was palpable. This foal was considered to be the only foal to have a truly congenital umbilical hernia. Twelve foals developed an umbilical hernia between 5 and 8 weeks of age. The prevalence of umbilical herniae was much higher than in other studies, possibly because of the prospective nature of the study. Based on this study, the large majority of umbilical herniae would appear not to result from failure of closure but rather to be acquired after birth. One should consider the palpable ring structure within the body wall at the umbilicus a variant of normal in the foal and should not call it a hernia until the foal is at least 1 month of age.",

External signs, such as swelling, heat, pain, ventral edema, or purulent discharge may be present in some foals, but more usually external signs are minimal and one suspects infection because of infection in another site (e.g., an infected joint), fever, or otherwise unexplained increased blood fibrinogen concentration. One confirms the diagnosis by ultrasonographic evaluation of the internal umbilical remnant. Any of the umbilical structures may be involved. A complete description of the evaluation is available within the relevant veterinary literature, but the examination is performed best with the foal standing using a 7.5-MHz probe with a standoff. 353 The usual finding is that the affected structure is larger than expected.

The usual practice for most owners or veterinarians attending the birth of a foal is to administer an enema to aid this process. In the past, phosphate-based commercially available enemata (Fleet) were used frequently, but if used excessively these types of enemata can create problems of their own, including rectal irritation and hyperphosphatemia. The best enema is warm soapy water made with a mild soap such as liquid Ivory soap that can be administered through soft rubber tubing using gravity flow. Foals with significant meconium retention become colicky within the first few hours of life as gas accumulates within their bowel. Frequently, one can palpate the meconium through the abdominal wall. Additional diagnostics can include abdominal ultrasonography and radiography, particularly if one must rule out other, more serious types of colic. These foals assume a classic stance with an arched back. One must differentiate this stance from the stance assumed by foals with uroperitoneum, which is more extended. Foals with meconium retention have had simultaneous ruptured bladder, however, so the clinician must be sure to evaluate the foal fully for both problems. Foals that do not respond rapidly to enema administration need additional treatment, which can include giving mineral oil (2 to 4 ounces) by nasogastric tube. One can treat persistent meconium retention resulting in significant abdominal distention by muzzling the foal to prevent further milk intake and administering intravenous fluids at an appropriate maintenance rate. If continuous rate infusion is possible, 5% to 10% dextrose is the preferred fluid to use to provide calories to the foal. One should not use dextrose as a bolus fluid. More aggressive treatment would include administration of retention enemata made using acetylcysteine, which serves as an irritant and increases secretion. Extreme cases of meconium retention may require surgical intervention, but this is usually not necessary and most cases resolve with medical management alone within 12 to 24 hours. Some foals require pain managment. One should avoid nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs in the neonate because of their effects on renal function and gastric mucosal blood flow (see Gastric Ulcers). Many foals respond well to butorphanol administered intramuscularly at a dose of 3 to 5 mg to an average 50-kg foal. Intranasal oxygen insufflation is beneficial in foals with significant abdominal distention.",

Antemortem diagnosis of atresia, short of abdominal exploratory surgery, is aided by the lack of meconium staining of the rectum or any administered enema fluids. Additional diagnostic tests may include administration of a barium enema for a radiographic study, colonoscopy, and abdominal ultrasonography. Abdominocentesis is usually normal until bowel rupture is imminent or has occurred.

The widespread fear of necrotizing enterocolitis among neonatologists and pediatric surgeons has contributed in large part to the use of the intravenous route rather than the gastrointestinal tract for nourishing these infants for long periods. The pathogenesis of necrotizing enterocolitis is unknown but may result from a disturbance of the delicate balance among gastrointestinal perfusion, enteric organisms, and enteral feeding. Risk factors for necrotizing enterocolitis in human infants include prematurity, hypoxic-ischemic insult, and formula or breast milk feedings. The clinical spectrum of necrotizing enterocolitis is multifactoral and ranges from temperature instability, apnea, lethargy, abdominal distention, bilious residuals, septic shock, disseminated intravascular coagulation, and death. Medical management is usually adequate treatment for necrotizing enterocolitis. In the neonatal foal, necrotizing enterocolitis is probably one of the most underrecognized causes of gastrointestinal dysfunction and in the past has been attributed only to infection with anaerobic organisms including Clostridium perfringens type C and C. difficile. 364 Although a specific form of enteritis is associated with intestinal infection by these organisms, most necrotizing enterocolitis is associated with prematurity or PAS in the infant and the foal.",

            "text": "The pathophysiology of gastric ulcer disease is described most reasonably as an imbalance in protective and aggressive factors. [372] [373] [374] These protective factors are responsible for maintaining a healthy gastrointestinal tract by promoting adequate mucosal blood flow, adequate mucus and bicarbonate production, prostaglandin E 2 production, epithelial growth factor production, gastric afferent innervation, epithelial cell restitution, and gastroduodenal motility. Probably the most important factor is maintenance of mucosal blood flow. Hypoxia, NO, prostaglandins, and gastric afferent innervation influence mucosal blood flow. The aggressive factors include gastric acid, bile salts, pepsin, and enzymes. Few specific causes have been found for gastric ulcer disease in foals. Excessive administration of nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs can result in ulceration of the glandular and squamous epithelium because of an inhibition of prostaglandin production, which leads to a decrease in mucosal blood flow and an increase in acid production. Nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs also can impair the healing of lesions and rarely are indicated in neonatal equine medicine. 372, 373 In the critically ill neonate the suspected cause of gastric ulcers has shifted away from an excessive amount of intraluminal gastric acid toward gastric mucosal ischemia caused by hypoxia, low blood flow conditions, or both. 375 Perforating gastric ulcers are more likely a manifestation of necrotizing enterocolitis than of excessive gastric acid. Shock, sepsis, or trauma can result in gastric mucosal ischemia, allowing for the disruption of epithelial cell integrity and permitting damage by aggressive factors or providing an environment suitable for the establishment of bacteria colonization. 375,376 Impairment of mucosal blood flow also may result in reperfusion injury, allowing the formation of gastric ulcers. In the sick neonatal foal (<7 days of age) a wide variability in the intragastric pH has been documented depending on the type of disease, severity, and milk intake frequency and volume, suggesting that in the critically ill equine neonate, ulcer prophylaxis using histamine antagonists or proton pump inhibitors is not only unnecessary but unlikely to work. 377 Clinically significant gastric ulcers can occur in the squamous, glandular, or both portions of the stomach as a primary problem or resulting from another problem. Clinical signs include diarrhea, abdominal pain, restlessness, rolling, lying in dorsal recumbency, excessive salivation, and bruxism. In the neonatal foal the only clinical signs present may be depression or partial anorexia until a more catastrophic event, such as perforation, occurs. Some lesions in the gastric mucosa extend from the pylorus into the proximal duodenum and can result in stricture of the pylorus and proximal duodenum. These foals are usually older (>1 month of age) and have a greater volume of reflux. Bruxism and ptyalism are also more prominent in these older foals.",

The clinician should not stop simply when ulceration of the stomach is recognized with endoscopy but should examine that patient fully for other potential sources of the clinical signs. Other diagnostic tests may help in determining the severity of the ulcers, including fecal occult blood or gastric blood assessments, contrast radiography, abdominal ultrasound, and abdominocentesis.

            "text": "Traditional therapy for gastric ulceration includes mucosal adherents, histamine type 2 receptor antagonists, proton pump inhibitors, and antacids. 378 The most widely used mucosal adherent is sucralfate, which is a hydroxy aluminum salt of sucrose. The main therapeutic action of sucralfate is to bind to the negatively charged particles in the ulcer crater. 378, 379 At a pH less than 2, sucralfate is converted to a sticky viscous gel, which adheres to the ulcer crater and remains adhered for 6 hours, but at a higher pH, sucralfate remains in a suspension. Sucralfate is still effective because it inhibits pepsin and buffers hydrogen ions. Other important actions of sucralfate include stimulating production of prostaglandin E, which maintains mucosal blood flow; increasing bicarbonate secretion; stimulating mucous secretion; decreasing peptic activity; and binding epidermal growth factor. The histamine type 2 receptor antagonists include cimetidine, ranitidine, and famotidine. These compounds block the interaction of histamine with the histamine type 2 receptor on the parietal cell, resulting in inhibition of gastric acid secretion. Clinically normal neonatal foals have a highly acidic gastric fluid that is influenced by sucking. Intravenous and oral administration of ranitidine increases intragastric pH in normal foals but critically ill neonatal foals have a blunted response to ranitidine administration. 377, 380 One possible conclusion reached from these studies is that in critically ill neonatal foals, gastric ulcers may not be caused by an increased intraluminal gastric acidity.",

This approach may not be appropriate for several reasons. An increased incidence of nosocomial pneumonia and systemic sepsis is associated with high gastric pH in human patients in intensive care. [382] [383] [384] Patients in intensive care units treated prophylactically with histamine type 2 receptor antagonists are more likely to develop pneumonia during ventilation therapy and gastric colonization with potentially pathogenic bacteria or yeast. 382, 385 An acidic environment appears to protect against airway colonization by bacteria of intestinal origin and bacteria translocated across the gastrointestinal tract. Pathogenesis of ulcers in the neonatal foal most likely does not involve increased intraluminal gastric acid but instead may be caused by decreased mucosal perfusion associated with shock, hypoxia, and hypoxic/ischemic insult to the gastric mucosa. A recent report revealed that gastric ulcer disease in equine NICU patients is independent of pharmacologic prophylaxis. 386 In this study, despite decreased treatment, the incidence of gastric ulcers found in these foals at necropsy had decreased significantly. The decrease was attributed to overall improvement in management of these cases. Similarly, in a human intensive care unit, the incidence of stress ulcers decreased independent of the use of prophylaxis. 375, 387 Early treatment of sepsis, sufficient oxygenation, improved monitoring, institution of enteral feedings, and improved nursing care may contribute to the reduction in gastric ulcers in the neonatal patient. Use of histamine type 2 receptor antagonist and proton pump inhibitors apparently may not be necessary; however, in some instances sucralfate may be useful. Sucralfate reduced the rate of bacterial translocation in a rat model during hemorrhagic shock and also may prohibit the generation of acute gastric mucosal injury and progression to ulcer formation induced by ischemia-reperfusion. 388, 389 In a human medical intensive care unit, airway colonization by new pathogens occurred more frequently in patients receiving agents that increased gastric pH than in those receiving sucralfate. 382, 390 In the critically ill neonatal foal, risk factors for gastric ulceration have not been identified clearly, although foals treated routinely with nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs may be at increased risk for gastric lesions. Prophylactic treatment for gastric ulcers in critically ill neonates may not be necessary, and one should consider carefully the pros and cons of their use before their administration.",

            "text": "Viral diarrhea occurs most commonly in large groups of mares and foals that are housed together. Rotavirus is an isolate from the feces of up to 40% of foals with diarrhea worldwide, alone or with another pathogen. 392, 393 The virus infects and denudes the microvilli, resulting in increased secretion combined with decreased absorption. The virus interferes with disaccharidase function and alters the function of the intestinal sodium-glucose cotransport proteins. The initial clinical signs are anorexia and depression, with profuse watery diarrhea occurring shortly thereafter. Severely affected foals may become significantly dehydrated and have electrolyte abnormalities, primarily hyponatremia and hypochloremia with metabolic acidosis. These foals generally require intravenous fluid support, whereas less severely affected foals may require only symptomatic therapy. Definitive diagnosis is by detection of the virus in the feces of foals with diarrhea. However, none of the available tests are particularly sensitive, and the virus also may be found with other intestinal pathogens. Recently, vaccination of pregnant mares has been suggested as a means of prevention, with preliminary results suggesting efficacy. 394,395 Although a definitive role for adenovirus has not been established in the foal, adenovirus is a common co-isolate from foals with rotaviral diarrhea. 396 A specific equine coronavirus recently has been identified from an immunocompetent foal with diarrhea, and a second report of cornavirus diarrhea was published recently. 397,398 One case report suggests a parvovirus caused diarrhea in the foal. 399 Treatment of viral diarrhea in foals is primarily supportive. Intravenous fluid and parenteral nutritional support may be necessary in severe cases. Very young foals may benefit from intravenous plasma administration and broad-spectrum antimicrobial coverage to limit bacterial translocation. One can administer sucralfate orally in these cases as a gastrointestinal protectant and to discourage bacterial translocation. Foals with moderate to severe metabolic acidosis may benefit from sodium bicarbonate administration if their ventilatory function is normal. One administers sodium bicarbonate at half the calculated deficit (0.5 \u00d7 standard base excess \u00d7 body mass in kilograms) as an isotonic solution at the maintenance fluid rate. One should reevaluate sodium and bicarbonate (or standard base excess) concentrations regularly. Nonspecific therapy of diarrhea is discussed elsewhere in this text.",

Fluid management of the ill neonate, particularly over the first few days of life, must take into consideration that the neonate is undergoing a large transition from the fetal to the neonatal state and that important physiologic changes are taking place. 166 These transitions include shifts in renal handling of free water and sodium and increased insensible losses because of evaporation from the body surface area and the respiratory tract. The newborn kidney has a limited ability to excrete excess free water and sodium, and the barrier between the vascular and interstitial space is more porous than that of adults. Water and sodium overload, particularly in the first few days of life, can have disastrous long-term consequences for the neonate. 416, 417 In the equine neonate, excess fluid administration frequently manifests as generalized edema formation and excessive weight gain, frequently equivalent to the volume of excess fluid administered intravenously. In cases in which antidiuretic hormone secretion is inappropriate, as in some foals with PAS, generalized edema may not form, but the excess free water is maintained in the vascular space. This syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion is recognized in the foal that gains excessive weight not manifested as edema generally, with decreased urine output and electrolyte abnormalities such as hyponatremia and hypochloremia. 418 The foal manifests neurologic abnormalities associated with hyponatremia. The serum creatinine concentration varies in these cases, but urine always is concentrated compared with the normally dilute, copious amounts of urine produced by foals more than 24 hours of age on a milk diet. If measured, serum osmolarity is less than urine osmolarity. The treatment for this disorder is fluid restriction until weight loss occurs, electrolyte abnormalities normalize, and urine concentration decreases. If the clinician is unaware of this differential diagnosis, the neonate can be assumed mistakenly to be in renal failure, and the condition can be exacerbated by excessive intravenous fluid administration in an attempt to produce diuresis.",

This translates to an hourly fluid rate of about 94 ml/hr. One should adjust the fluid and sodium requirements for ongoing losses exceeding the maintenance requirements. These losses can take the form of diarrheal losses and excessive urine output, such as those with glucose diuresis and renal damage resulting in an increased fractional excretion of sodium. The normal fractional excretion of sodium in neonatal foals is less than that of adult horses, usually less than 1% (J.E. Palmer, unpublished data). In the critically ill foal the sodium requirement can be met with as little as 140 mEq of sodium per day, about that administered in a single liter of normal equine plasma. One can address sodium deficits by separate infusion of sodium-containing fluids, although this may not be necessary if one considers the sodium being administered in other forms, including drugs administered as sodium salts and any constant rate infusions (pressors, inotropes, etc.) that are being provided as solutions made with 0.9% sodium chloride.",

Few investigations have focused on the equine neonatal musculoskeletal system, 1-6 but a large body of clinical information exists, and one can make cautious extrapolations from work in other species. 7 Neonatal equine bones have accelerated modeling and remodeling processes 5 that result in accelerated fracture healing and an increased susceptibility to deformation caused by excessive loading. Contralateral limb varus deformities of the growth centers (most commonly distal radius and metacarpus/ metatarsus) are common in overloaded limbs. The increased plasticity of the skeletal structure also is mirrored in the soft tissue support system, for these units become flaccid within 2 weeks of immobilization. 4 This laxity is important, because it further compromises the use of the fractured limb and can last as long as the coaptation was in place. Additional divergences from adult physiology include musculoskeletal immaturity (generalized or focal) and immune system differences. Finally, foals are lighter and can tolerate and will assume recumbency more readily than adults. The net results of these differences are that one must consider the use of external coaptation carefully, fractures heal quickly, one must consider damage to the contralateral limb from overstress, reducing weight bearing is possible, and infection is always lurking.",

Appendicular fractures usually do not occur during parturition because of the robust character of the bones of the foal. After birth, foals are susceptible to external trauma from many sources. The dilemma is that younger foals with fractures are more likely to heal but also are more likely to develop contralateral limb problems because of excessive weight bearing and affected limb flexor tendon laxity if the limb is immobilized fully.

One also can use phenylbutazone (4 mg/kg) for a short time when the splints are used. Some analgesia appears to help the foals use the limbs and stretch the soft tissues. One should not use phenylbutazone for long periods of time because of the potential of inducing gastric ulcers.",

However, after the first few days of life, the asymmetric loading of the growth centers does affect limb deviations. Angulation results from a compressive load that is asymmetric in a frontal plane but is uniform in the sagittal plane, and rotation occurs when the compressive load is asymmetric in both planes and the limb develops around an overloaded axis point. Considered this way, valgus and outward rotation deviations in young foals are coupled, as are varus and inward rotation in older foals. The loading asymmetry for valgus/outward rotation foals is accentuated as foals assume a base-wide posture that is more stable side-to-side but promotes a lateralization of the limb load. The specific effects of intermittent versus static loads, strain magnitude versus strain rate, and shear and hydrostatic stress on growing bones is only beginning to be understood.

Environmental influences are many and include the intrauterine environment, the postnatal limb load, nutrition, and bad luck. Suffice to say, the situation is complex, but one must consider biologic and mechanicobiologic influences when evaluating the growth of long bones. 18 Several factors may contribute to the common occurrence of deviations in the carpus. First, the carpus is in the middle of the limb and is subject to the greatest bending forces. Second, the carpal anatomy is complex and perhaps is not understood completely. The carpus has seven cuboidal bones, two long bones, and two epiphyses (distal radial and lateral styloid); and cartilage surrounds all. The ligamentous support includes collateral ligaments, innumerable intracarpal ligaments, and a palmar carpal soft tissue ligament. The distal radial physis is not flat transversely, but undulates in the frontal and sagittal planes. 3 A separate center of ossification for the lateral styloid process is found at its palmar-lateral aspect. Because of this separate center of ossification, more cartilage and less bone are in the lateral aspect of the distal radial growth center, suggesting it may be more susceptible to growth alterations from load.",

Exercise is essential for the robust development of almost every body system for neonates, and fresh air and good ventilation reduce the occurrence of respiratory disease. Appropriate limb loading along with growth and maturity is what straightens limbs, but excessive amounts of loading can be deleterious. For example, one should use exercise cautiously in foals with very asymmetric deviations.

Treatment of tarsal incomplete ossification is important because tarsal crushing results in an unfavorable prognosis for athletic performance. 20, 21 Hindlimbs require a slightly different approach to coaptation than forelimbs because of their anatomy. Foals can rise to stand if their forelimbs are fixed in extension but cannot do so if their hindlimbs are extended. The multiple bony protuberances of the hock make cast sores more likely than in the forelimb, so casts are problematic. Gutter splints are not useful because of the angle of the hock. Severely limiting exercise is part of allowing the tarsus to mature without cartilage crushing, but foals cannot always be recumbent. Extra small articulated anterior cruciate ligament splints for human beings (Playmaker Wraparound, dj Orthopedics, Vista, California) have given the best results. For small foals, a padded bandage is necessary under the splint, which is reversed to conform to the angle of the hock.

Studies indicate an approximately 80% improvement of carpal valgus foals after periosteal transection and elevation, but unfortunately they do not compare foals that had surgery with controls that did not. 22, 23 Recently, some have suggested that most of the correction was unrelated to the surgery, 24 and one experimental study supports that conclusion. 25 As a result, at this time making firm recommendations about the indications for periosteal transection and elevation is difficult. However, periosteal transection and elevation has a low likelihood of complications and may be effective. The procedure is inexpensive and can be done in the field and therefore may be an option for clients with foals with carpal valgus in which a transphyseal bridging is undesirable or unnecessary. One indication is the very young foal born with a notably asymmetric epiphysis that results in a severe carpal valgus. This distal radial appearance is not particularly common, but the lack of ossification in the epiphysis can make a firm hold with a transphyseal bridging difficult to achieve.

The localization of the apparent initial site of infection to the growth center has been suggested to result from \"looping\" metaphyseal vessels with sluggish blood flow that allow pathogens more time to escape the circulation. 29, 30 However, transmission electron microscopy indicates that osteogenic cells and the vascular endothelium are a continuous network in developing embryos, 31 indicating that the relationship between circulation and bone is more intimate than previously suspected.",

One should perform joint puncture in a sterile fashion, and sedation is indicated to get an atraumatic tap. Short-term anesthesia is preferable when joints have effusion because one may perform joint lavage at the same time. Normal joint fluid should be clear to slightly yellow, should be viscous, and should contain less than 2500 nucleated cells per deciliter. The cell ratio should be roughly 50:50 polymorphonuclear and mononuclear. The total protein content should be less than 2.5 mg/dl. One should consider joints to be infected if the nucleated cell count is greater than 10,000 cells/dl. For joints falling between 2500 and 10,000 cells/dl, if the polymorphonuclear cell count is >90%, one should consider the joints infected. Cytologists are often reluctant to diagnose infection when nuclear degeneration or bacteria are not visible. This is overly conservative and results in delay in treating infections because bacteria and nuclear degeneration are rare in early cases of joint infection. Out of an abundance of caution, one should treat lame foals with suspicious joints as infected unless they are clearly normal. One should always culture joint fluid in an attempt to identify the offending organisms, but because of difficulties in culturing pathogens from joint fluid samples, absence of growth does not mean absence of infection. One obtains the best culture results if the foal has not been treated with antimicrobial agents beforehand. One should obtain as much joint fluid as possible for culture and should incubate it overnight in blood culture media before plate inoculation.

If a normal contralateral joint is available, comparison radiographs may be useful.

Intravenous perfusion is preferable because no special equipment is needed, but intraosseous perfusion may be valuable where intravenous access is impossible. The concept behind both procedures is to fill the venous vasculature in the area of the infection with antimicrobials diluted by a sterile balanced electrolyte solution. One isolates the anatomic area of interest using one or two tourniquets. The perfusate diffuses into all tissues and achieves much higher concentrations than are possible using intravenous therapy. This technique has shown excellent results as an adjunct therapy for orthopedic infection. 43 For foals, 12 to 20 ml total of perfusate containing 250 mg amikacin is useful for most single joint sites. Amikacin has given consistently good results without complication and is a good choice based on its concentration-dependent activity. One may use a higher volume for the stifle, but the thigh musculature makes an effective tourniquet difficult to achieve.
