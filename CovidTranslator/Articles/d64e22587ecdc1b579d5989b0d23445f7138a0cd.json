            "text": "A growing body of evidence suggests the non-protein coding human genome is of vital importance for human cell function. Besides small RNAs, the diverse class of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) recently came into focus. however, their relevance for infection, a major evolutionary driving force, remains elusive. Using two commercially available microarray systems, namely Ncode\u2122 and sureprint\u2122 G3, we identified differential expression of 42 ncRNAs during influenza A virus (IAV) infection in human lung epithelial cells. This included several classes of lncRNAs, including large intergenic ncRNAs (lincRNAs). As analyzed by qRT-PcR, expression of one lincRNA, which we termed virus inducible lincRNA (VIN), is induced by several IAV strains (h1N1, h3N2, h7N7) as well as vesicular stomatitis virus. however, we did not observe an induction of VIN by influenza B virus, treatment with RNA mimics, or IFN\u03b2. Thus, VIN expression seems to be a specific response to certain viral infections. RNA fractionation and RNA-FIsh experiments revealed that VIN is localized to the host cell nucleus. Most importantly, we show that abolition of VIN by RNA interference restricts IAV replication and viral protein synthesis, highlighting the relevance of this lincRNA for productive IAV infection. Our observations suggest that viral pathogens interfere with the non-coding portion of the human genome, thereby guaranteeing their successful propagation, and that the expression of VIN correlates with their virulence. consequently, our study provides a novel approach for understanding virus pathogenesis in greater detail, which will enable future design of new antiviral strategies targeting the host's non-protein coding genome.",

            "text": "The surprising observation that only 1.5% of the mammalian genome is protein coding and the identification of vast numbers of non-protein coding transcripts in large-scale transcriptomic studies initiated a debate about the role of ncRNAs in cell biology. 1 It has been speculated that in contrast to protein coding genes, the non-coding portion of a genome correlates with organism complexity and functions in crucial regulatory processes. 2, 3 With a length of ~22 nucleotides, microRNAs (miRNAs) constitute the best-studied class of small regulatory RNAs and have assigned functions in several cellular processes, including development, proliferation, and disease. 4, 5 However, recent identification and characterization of lncRNAs indicate a more complex cell regulatory network than previously anticipated. So far, lncRNAs are categorized as transcripts longer than 200 nucleotides that do not contain a significant open reading frame but are often polyadenylated and spliced. 6 The genomic origin of lncRNAs is manifold, including intergenic, intronic, gene-overlapping, or antisense transcription. Although only a few have been characterized in detail, their functional repertoire is expanding. Several studies have revealed that lncRNAs are important for gene regulation, 7, 8 such as XIST, which regulates dosage compensation of the mammalian X chromosome. 9 Mechanisms of lncRNA action are diverse and they are involved in widespread biological processes like imprinting, pluripotency, cell differentiation, development, apoptosis, and development of disease. 5 However, although infection is considered a major driving force of human genome evolution, little is known about potential roles of lncRNAs in this context. Recently, transcriptome-wide deep sequencing revealed the differential expression of more than a thousand potential lncRNAs during severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) infection in mice, indicative of a function in infection. 10 Several of these mouse lncRNAs were shown to be similarly regulated upon infection with IAV, a highly contagious virus causing annual epidemics and frequent pandemic outbreaks. 11 To understand the process of IAV infection in humans and develop new antiviral strategies, genome-wide studies have aimed to identify host cell proteins necessary for productive IAV replication. 12, 13 Host cell miRNAs are known to be differentially regulated by IAV and implicated in control of infection outcome, 14, 15 whereas the functional significance of lncRNA expression during IAV infection remains elusive.",

To check if other viruses can also alter its expression, two additional IAV strains were selected, one IBV strain and vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV)-a nonsegmented negative-sense single-stranded RNA virus. The levels of VIN expression in cells infected with the IAV strains A/ Panama/2007/99 (H3N2) and A/FPV/Bratislava/79 (H7N7) increased approximately 30-60-fold, compared with 10-fold increased levels in A/WSN/33 (H1N1) virus-infected cells at 6 h p.i.

Infection with all tested viruses yielded a cell infection rate between 50-70%, excluding the possibility that different infectivities adversely affected VIN expression (Fig. S5) . qRT-PCR time course investigations over 8 h suggested that infection-induced expression of VIN increased during late infection [VSV and A/WSN/33 (H1N1); Fig. S6 ]. In line with initial investigations at 6 h p.i. (Fig. 2A) , IBV infection failed to induce VIN expression at all time points investigated (Fig. S6) .",

UCSC genome browser analysis revealed the presence of high methylation levels of lysine 4 of histone H3 (H3K4me) and acetylation of lysine 27 of histone H3 (H3K27ac) upstream of VIN, markers for transcriptional activation 20 (Fig. 3A) . Together with the clustering of several transcription factor binding sites in this region and the presence of a CpG island, this supports the notion that VIN is actively transcribed (Fig. 3A) . Several other databases, including the recently released LNCipedia compendium, also list VIN as non-coding RNA. 21 This database classifies long non-coding transcripts according to Coding Potential Calculator (CPC) analysis. This algorithm takes multiple features such as peptide length, amino acid composition, secondary structure, and protein homology into consideration. 22 Like the majority of identified lncRNAs, 6,23 VIN is encoded by two exons and contains a 3\u2032-polyadenylation signal (AAUAAA).",

RNA fractionation experiments revealed that VIN was more abundant in the nuclear RNA fraction of A549 cells compared with the cytoplasmic fraction (Fig. 4A) . The enrichment of VIN in the nuclear fraction was similar to that for the RNU1-1 nuclear RNA, whereas GAPDH mRNA was distributed approximately equally in both nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions. Western blotting with antibodies specific for the cytoplasmic 14-3-3 proteins and the nuclear protein Lamin A/C confirmed that fractionation was successful (Fig. S7) . RNA fluorescence in situ hybridization (RNA-FISH) was performed to further investigate the subcellular localization of VIN. Mockand A/WSN/33 (H1N1) virus-infected A549 cells were probed with a VIN-specific digoxigenin (DIG)-labeled RNA oligonucleotide. In uninfected A549 cells, a faint diffuse but nuclear DIG signal was observed (Fig. 4B, panel 1) , which increased upon infection with A/WSN/33 (H1N1) virus (Fig. 4B, panel  2) . The specificity of RNA-FISH was determined via hybridization of probes targeting nuclear RNU1-1 and the ubiquitously distributed GAPDH mRNA (Fig. S8A, panels 1 and 2) . A control condition without applying any probe showed that signals detected in the Cy2 channel were not influenced by simultaneous staining of viral nucleoprotein (NP) with Cy3 (Fig. S8A,  panel 3 ). In addition, knockdown of VIN by siRNAs decreased the nuclear DIG signal (Fig. S8B) , confirming the specificity of RNA-FISH probes. The observation that nuclear NP levels were decreased in cells depleted of VIN prompted us to hypothesize that VIN expression affected virus protein expression, potentially supporting viral infectivity.",

Viral titers of the titrated cell supernatants were calculated according to infectivity rates. Notably, knockdown with three different siRNAs individually and in conjunction (approx. 60% knockdown efficiency, Fig. S9A) , reduced viral titers more than 10-fold compared with Allstars siRNA-treated control cells ( Fig. 5A and B) , highlighting the importance of VIN for productive IAV infection.

Cell viability (Fig. S9B) and type I IFN response (Fig. S9C) were unchanged in knockdown cells, and thus, could not have caused decreased virus titers indirectly.

Research into hostpathogen interactions has so far focused mostly on host cell proteins 12, 13, 29 and not yet considered the role of lncRNAs in detail. Given that small ncRNAs such as miRNAs 14, 15, 30, 31 have already been shown to have important functions during the host cell response to infections, it is likely that lncRNAs also play important roles. We identified the lincRNA VIN as an essential player during IAV replication, showing a more than 10-fold decrease of IAV titer upon VIN knockdown. Viruses are known to hijack the host cellular machinery for their own replication and suppress antiviral responses by a variety of mechanisms. The relevance of host cell factors during IAV replication has been previously identified, revealing the involvement of several cellular networks in IAV replication. 12, 29, 32, 33 Since these processes need tight control to ensure successful virus propagation, we propose a role for VIN in gene expression control during IAV infection.",

Gene regulatory functions of lncRNAs have already been proposed during immune responses. 43 The Th1selective lincRNA NeST, by acting as an enhancer RNA, contributes to IFN\u03b3 expression, thereby controlling susceptibility to bacterial and viral pathogens. 44, 45 In contrast, lncRNAs repressing antiviral or enhancing proviral gene expression might aid in supporting viral replication, rendering them interesting targets for the development of new host-directed antiviral strategies.",
