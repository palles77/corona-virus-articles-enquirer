            "text": "Human tRNA Lys3 UUU (htRNA Lys3 UUU ) decodes the lysine codons AAA and AAG during translation, and also plays a crucial role as the primer for HIV-1 reverse transcription. The posttranscriptional modifications 5-methoxycarbonylmethyl-2-thiouridine (mcm 5 s 2 U 34 ), 2-methylthio-N 6 -threonylcarbamoyladenosine (ms 2 t 6 A 37 )and pseudouridine (\u03c8 39 ) in the tRNA'santicodon loop are critical for ribosomal binding and HIV-1 reverse transcription. To understand the importance of modified nucleoside contributions, the structure and function of this tRNA's anticodon stem and loop domain were determined with these modifications at positions 34, 37 and 39, respectively (hASL Lys3 UUU -mcm 5 s 2 U 37 ;ms 2 t 6 A 37 ;\u03c8 39 ). Ribosome binding assays in vitrorevealed that the hASL Lys3 UUU -mcm 5 s 2 U 34 ;ms 2 t 6 A 37 ;\u03c8 39 bound AAA and AAG codons, whereas binding of the unmodified ASL Lys3 UUU was barely detectable. The UV hyperchromicity, the circular dichroism and the structural analyses indicated that \u03c8 39 enhanced the thermodynamic stability of the ASL through base stacking while ms 2 t 6 A 37 restrained the anticodon to adopt an open loop conformation that is required for ribosomal binding. The NMR-restrained molecular dynamics derived solution structure revealed that the modifications provided an open, ordered loop for codon binding. The crystal structures of the hASL Lys3 UUU -mcm 5 s 2 U 34 ;ms 2 t 6 A 37 ;\u03c8 39 bound to the Accession Numbers The coordinates of X-ray and NMR structures including factors and NMR restraints have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank (RCSB) and the BioMagResBank (BMRB). The accession numbers 2L9E (17449) have been assigned to solution structure of the doubly modified ASL Lys3 UUU , and the accession numbers 3T1H and 3T1Y were assigned to the crystal structures bound to AAA and AAG, respectively. A complete listing of resolution and structure factors can be accessed in the Protein Data Bank. 30S ribosomal subunit with each codon in the A site showed that the modified nucleotides mcm 5 s 2 U 34 and ms 2 t 6 A 37 participate in the stability of the anticodon/codon interaction. Importantly, the mcm 5 s 2 U 34 \u2022G 3 wobble base pair is in the Watson-Crick geometry, requiring unusual hydrogen bonding to G in which mcm 5 s 2 U 34 must shift from the keto to enol form. The results unambiguously demonstrate that modifications pre-structurethe anticodonas a key prerequisite for efficient and accurate recognition of cognate and wobble codons.",

            "text": "Accurate ribosome-mediated protein synthesis requires proper recognition of mRNA codons by specific aminoacylatedtRNAisoacceptors. The influence of post-transcriptional tRNA modifications on translational fidelity has been widely investigated. [1] [2] [3] [4] As a result of such studies, 93 different, naturally-occurring modification chemistries have been identified in tRNAs. 5 These modifications, particularly in the anticodon stem and loop domain (ASL), have been shown to significantly impact ribosome binding affinity, 6-8 codon discrimination, thermodynamic stability, 11 speed of translation, 12 recognition by cognate aminoacyl-tRNAsynthetases 13 and reading frame maintenance. [14] [15] [16] [17] Specifically, modifications to the wobble nucleoside at position-34 and the conserved purine residue at position-37, 3'adjacent to the anticodon, are essential for pre-structuring the ASL, permitting proper anticodon conformation and efficient codon recognition. Human tRNA Lys3 UUU (htRNA Lys3 UUU ; Fig. 1a ,b) is of particular interest because of its dual role in promoting proper endogenous translation and acting as the primer selected for initiation of reverse transcription (RT) by human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV-1) and other lentiviruses. 19 Indeed, the ASL modifications present in htRNA Lys3 UUU have been shown to be required for efficient initiation of RT in HIV-1. [20] [21] [22] The anticodon stem and loop (ASL Lys UUU ) domain of the sole E. coli tRNA Lys UUU has been studied extensively as a model due to its modified nucleotides being similar to those of the human tRNA Lys3 UUU and its anticodon loop nucleoside sequence being identical. 23 The ASL loop modifications of the E. colitRNA Lys UUU , 5-methylaminomethyl-2-thiouridine (mnm 5 s 2 U 34 ) and N 6 -threonylcarbamoyladenosine (t 6 A 37 ), pre-structure the loop into the canonical U-turn conformation that is necessary for efficient binding to synonymous codons in the ribosomal A-site. Both studies in vitro [27] [28] [29] and in vivo 30 have shown that a 2thiolation, and not 5-methylaminomethylation, at the wobble position acts as a strong positive identity element for recognition of tRNA Lys UUU and tRNA Glu UUC by their respective cognate aminoacyl-tRNAsynthetases. X-ray crystallography of the ASL domain of E. colitRNA Lys on the 30S ribosomal subunit demonstrated clearly that the t 6 A 37 modification further stabilizes the unusually low enthalpy of binding in the A-U rich codonanticodon interaction by forming a cross-strand stack with the first adenosine residue of the codon. 25 The t 6 A 37 modification and its derivatives are found in the tRNAisoacceptors that decode codons beginning with A in all three Domains of life.",

The anticodon loop of hASL Lys3 UUU has a 5-methoxycarbonylmethyl-2thiouridine at position-34 (mcm 5 s 2 U 34 )and a 2-methylthio-N 6 -threonyl-carbamoyladenosine at position-37 (ms 2 t 6 A 37 ). 35 Apseudouridineis present at position-39 (\u03c8 39 ) in the ASL stem, immediately adjacent to the loop (Fig. 1a,b) . In contrast to the htRNA Lys3 UUU , the ASLs of the isoaccepting htRNA Lys1,2 contain an unmodified C 34 and a more simply modified A 37 (t 6 A 37 ). The htRNA Lys1,2 isoacceptors represent two-thirds of all lysine tRNA in mammalian cells, and are specific for decoding only the dominant AAG codon.In vitro ribosome binding studies using the hASL Lys3 UUU with the E. coli modifications, mnm 5 U 34 and t 6 A 37 , demonstrated that the insertion of the individual modifications in the ASL at positions 34 or 37 respectively, would rescue codon binding to only the cognate AAA.With both modifications present the ASL recognized both AAA and AAG. 8 This highlights the importance of the two-hypermodificationsbeing present for dual codon recognition and specificity.",

The site-selected introduction of the complex modifications mcm 5 s 2 U 34 and ms 2 t 6 A 37 is problematic and required a novel chemical synthesis of the oligonucleotide in which the modified nucleoside functional groups as well as the major bases were transiently protected. The protecting chemistries had to be compatible with each other and with that of the major nucleosides such that all are readily and quantitatively removed when the oligonucleotide synthesis was complete. The cyclic chemistry involves the repeated coupling of a nucleoside phosphoramiditeto the growing sequence and, at each addition, the oxidation of the trivalent phosphate into a pentavalent phosphate. Removal of the oligonucleotide from the solid support and deprotection of the C2'-OH are accomplished under conditions that would normally alter the modified nucleosides. A novel use of protecting agents and an alteration of the deprotection protocol maintained the native integrity of the modifications (Supplementary Fig. S1 ). The presence of the modifications in stoichiometric amounts was quantified by nucleoside composition analysis with HPLC ( Supplementary Fig. S2 ), and observed in NMR and X-ray crystallography. The terminal base pair \u03c8 27 \u2022A 43 was substituted with a G 27 \u2022C 43 pair to enhance stability of the ASL constructs (Fig. 1a) .",

In contrast, the unmodified ASL Lys3 UUU exhibited very poor binding to both lysine codons. The equilibrium binding of the unmodified hASL Lys3 UUU to either of the lysine codons AAA or AAG was nearly undetectable (Fig. 2a,b) . Previously, we had observed that the single atom substitution of sulfur for oxygen at the 2-position of U 34 rescued ASL Lys UUU binding of the cognate and wobble codons, and that the introduction of only t 6 A 37 enabled AAA binding, but not AAG binding or translocation to the P-site. 6, 8, 15, 25, 42 Our experiments with the unmodified and modified hASL Lys3 UUU -mcm 5 s 2 U 34 ;ms 2 t 6 A 37 ;\u03c8 39 revealed that anticodon domain modifications enhanced codon binding, similar to results reported for the variously modified anticodon domain of the bacterial tRNA Lys UUU (ASL Lys UUU -s 2 U 34 , ASL Lys UUU -mnm 5 U 34 , ASL Lys UUU -t 6 A 37 and ASL Lys UUU -mnm 5 U 34 ;t 6 A 37 ). 7, 8 Anticodon loop modifications alter thermal stability A comparison of the thermal stabilities of the differently modified hASL Lys3 UUU constructs by UV-monitored thermal denaturation revealed both similarities and distinct differences in their thermodynamic properties. While the enthalpy (\u0394H), entropy (\u0394S) and standard free energy (\u0394G) did not vary significantly, the introduction of modifications caused a reduction in the melt temperature, T m , at which half of the RNA molecules are denatured.The hASL Lys3 UUU -mcm 5 s 2 U 34 ;ms 2 t 6 A 37 and the hASL Lys3 UUUmcm 5 s 2 U 34 ;ms 2 t 6 A 37 ;\u03c8 39 exhibited a T m of ~53 \u00b0C in comparison toa T m of ~57 \u00b0C for the unmodified hASL Lys3 UUU (Fig. 2c , and Table 1 ).

To study and understand the extent to which these modifications affect the anticodon conformation and dynamics, the three dimensional (3D) solution structure of the doubly modified hASL Lys3 UUU -mcm 5 s 2 U 34 ;ms 2 t 6 A 37 was determined through NMR and restrained molecular dynamics. In addition, the structure of its unmodified counterpart was fully characterized by NMR. In achieving this goal, the identification and sequence-specific assignment of the nucleotide spin systems was completed by using combinations of homo-( 1 H-1 H)-nuclear and natural abundance hetero-( 1 H-13 C; 1 H-31 P)-nuclear 1D and 2D NMR experiments conducted in H 2 O or D 2 O solvent.Well-established protocols were employed for the assignment of nucleic acid resonances in the absence of isotopic labeling. 44, 45 The NMR spectra were recorded in the absence of Mg 2+ because previous experiences revealed that the addition of a physiological amount of Mg 2+ ions (1-5 mM) to the modified ASL samples did not significantly affect the resulting NMR spectra. The addition of larger concentrations of Mg 2+ induced spectral line broadening in some ASLs. 11, 46, 47 Exchangeable protons-The imino and amino protons of the doubly modified hASL Lys3 UUU -mcm 5 s 2 U 34 ;ms 2 t 6 A 37 were identified and assigned using 1 H 1D and 1 H-1 H 2D NOESY NMR spectra that were recorded in H 2 O at 2 \u00b0C.In assigning the exchangeable protons,we used the initial assumption that the stem of the ASL was reasonably close to Atype RNA conformation, as was indicated by CD spectroscopy (Fig. 2d) . Four resonance signals were observed in the low field region (12.50 -14.00 ppm) of the 1 H 1D spectrum of the hASL Lys3 UUU -mcm 5 s 2 U 34 ;ms 2 t 6 A 37 . These NMR signals were characteristic of imino protons that are engaged in Watson-Crick base pairs and were sequentially assigned to the G 27 H1, G 42 H1, U 41 H3 and G 30 H1 (Supplementary Fig. S3 ). The resonance peak of the G 27 H1 displayed a low intensity and broad line width which is expected from the terminal base pair G 27 \u2022C 43 . The resonance signal corresponding to the H1 imino proton of U 39 that is engaged in the A 31 \u2022U 39 base pair adjacent to the loop could not be identified. Therefore, this imino proton was not assigned. The assignment of the imino protons allowed us to fully assign the amino protons of the nucleotides of the stem. Under our NMR experimental conditions (see Methods and Materials) the rapidly exchanging amino and imino protons of the loop nucleosides could not be identified.",

Therefore, the solution structure of the doubly modified ASL was investigated for proton and phosphorus resonances that characterize the U-turn. The canonical U-turn conformation in RNAs is confirmed through a distinctive 1 H-NMR \"fingerprint.\" 48 This fingerprint usually consists of NOE signalsbetween the anomeric H1' proton of the conserved U 33 and its own H5/H6, and between the anomeric H1' proton of U 33 and the U 35 H5/H6. In addition, U 33 H2' has NOE connectivities to H5/H6 of bases U 34 and U 35 . Also, the phosphorus of the dinucleotide U 33 33pU 34 has a strong down-field chemical shift which reflects the fact that the a dihedral angle is trans. In our study, an NOE was observed between U 33 H1' and its own aromatic protons for the doubly modified hASL Lys3 UUUmcm 5 s 2 U 34 ;ms 2 t 6 A 37 . Another NOE connectivity was detected between U 33 H2' and mcm 5 s 2 U 34 H6. Interestingly, C\u03b3H3 of the methylene group of mcm 5 s 2 U 34 gave a medium strength NOE signal to U 33 H1'. The 1 H-31 P HETCOR NMR experiment showed that the chemical shifts of the resonances for the 31 P nucleus were narrowly confined ( Supplementary Fig. S5 ), as commonly observed in the case of A-RNA. 44, 49 Solution structure of the hASL Lys3 UUU -mcm 5 s 2 U 34 ;ms 2 t 6 A 37 -The distance and angle restraints required for the structure calculation were determined following the NMR spectral analyses. 44 A total of 552 NOE-derived distance restraints were used for the structure calculation. These distance restraints were constituted by 392 and 134 NOE distance restraints that were assigned to the stem and the loop, respectively. In addition, 26 hydrogen bond (hb) and five planarity restraints were also used to define the structure of the stem. A total of 126 dihedral angle restraints were also used to determine the entire structure of the ASL. The results of the UV thermal denaturation, the CD experiments and the pattern of the anomeric-aromatic NOE walk strongly suggested that the stem of the doubly modified ASL adopted an A-RNA conformation. Therefore, the NMR torsion-angle and distance restraints from the stem were complemented with distance restraints that yield the conventional A-form helix RNA conformation, as previously described and employed by others. 47, 48 The ten lowest energy structures determined from the torsion angle molecular dynamics calculations that were in agreement with the NMR data were selected to represent the final ensemble (Fig. 4) . The final set of solution structures was chosen on the basis of displaying not a single NOE restraint violation superior to 0.5 \u00c5 and no dihedral angle violations greater than 5\u00b0. In addition to these selection criteria, structures were rejected if their rootmean square deviations (rmsds) of bonds and angles varied from ideal values, i.e. by greater than 0.02 \u00c5 and 2.0\u00b0, respectively. The pairwise rmsd for all atoms is 0.82 \u00b1 0.20 \u00c5.",

This planar structure is used to increase stacking of the ms 2 t 6 A 37 with A 38 , its 3' neighbor ( Fig. 5a) . Finally, the threonyl moiety is too bulky to be incorporated into the helical stack ( Supplementary Fig. S7 ), so it serves to sterically position the pseudo-three cycle base in a very specific location in order to make a cross-strand stack which bridges from the ASL's 3' stack to the codon itself. This crossstrand stack greatly enhances the stability of the codon-anticodon complex.",

It has been shown that placement of a stacking sulfur such that it can interact with an N1 of the stacking partner maximizes the strength of the interaction, 55 and in the current case, it also stacks well with an S 2 -N characteristic, albeit with the N7 rather than the N1 of the codon base A1 (Fig. 5b) . This provides strong evidence that the sulfur of the ms 2 modification acts primarily to enhance the stacking of ms 2 t 6 A 37 with the first base of the codon. The two modifications act in concert to optimize the structure of the anticodon loop in an open conformation prior to codon binding, and to maximize the strength of the codon-anticodon interaction by forming a sulfur-enhanced cross-strand stack by the precisely-positioned pseudo-three cycle base. In the absence of the ms 2 , the t 6 takes the same position in the 3'-stack of the ASL as it does in its presence. This conserved positioning of the t 6 is clearly seen in a superimposition of the crystal of what would be the bacterial ASL Lys UUU -t 6 A 37 and ASL Lys UUU -mnm 5 U 34 ;t 6 A 37 25 with that of the hASL Lys3 UUU -mcm 5 s 2 U 34 ;ms 2 t 6 A 37 ;\u03c8 39 (Fig. 5c ).",

            "text": "The pre-structured and constrained tRNA anticodon is energetically advantageous for a cell's protein synthesis. Every anticodon (other than that of initiator tRNA) must conform to the constraints of the ribosome's A-site, and yet present a physicochemical face that repeatedly reads only the appropriate codons. Repeated use of a conformed and dynamically restricted anticodon negates the need for remodeling the RNA each time an aminoacyl-tRNA is used for the decoding of its synonymous codons. Thus, pre-structuring of the anticodon enhances the accuracy and efficiency of protein synthesis. Though this is true of a great many tRNAs, the tRNA Lys UUU species is of particular interest for two reasons. First, approximately half of all bacteria have one lysine tRNAisoacceptor, the tRNA Lys UUU that has a 5methylaminomethyl-2-thiouridine modification at wobble position 34 and a N 6threonylcarbamoyladenosine, which allows it to respond to both lysine codons AAA and AAG. 23 In contrast, mammalian cells contain three lysine isoacceptingtRNA species for cytoplasmic protein synthesis. The mammalian tRNA Lys1 CUU and tRNA Lys2 CUU constitute the majority of lysine tRNAs in the cell and respond only to AAG, the prominent lysine codon. The tRNA Lys3 UUU is the least abundant of the three isoacceptors in the cell and responds to AAA and AAG. Second, the host cell tRNA Lys3 UUU is selected by HIV as the primer for the initiation of reverse transcription as predicted from the viral RNA sequence. [59] [60] [61] The individual modificationsof mnm 5 U 34 at the wobble position and t 6 A at position-37 enhanced the cognate codon binding of the unmodified ASL Lys3 UUU by approximately seven-fold; however, the modifications in combination increased codon binding to a level equivalent to that of endogenous E. colitRNA Lys UUU . 8 The combination of t 6 A 37 and mnm 5 U 34 or s 2 U 34 also allowed efficient wobble codon recognition, but the s 2 -modification was required for proper translocation to the P-site. 6, 8, 25, 56 The 2-thiolated uridine at the wobble position of many tRNAs, as well as that of htRNA Lys3 UUU , causes a slight enhancement of ribosome binding to A over G at the third position of the codon. 6, 38, 58 Molecular dynamics simulations of the xm 5 s 2 U mononucleoside bound to A or G also showed a marked preference for binding to A. 62 Previous NMR experiments investigating xm 5 s 2 U as a mononucleoside and in short polymers showed a strong steric preference for the modified uridine to adopt an anti, C3'-endo sugar pucker conformation, effecting the same in 3'-neighboring nucleosides. Thus, the thio-moiety causes a more rigid binding geometry that could account for selection against pyrimidines at the third position of the codon. 57, 58, 63, 64 Molecular dynamics simulations also confirmed that the ms 2 t 6 A 37 reduced thermal stability via a stereochemical effect that widened the loop and prevented the A 37 \u2022U 33 cross-loop interaction. 40 In contrast, structural models of the unmodified ASLs of tRNA Lys UUU and those singly modified with \u03c8 39 that had been generated using a subset of NMR distance restraints indicated a thermally stable, closed UUU triloop structure. 41 Consistent with previous in silico models and empirical studies, the addition of ms 2 t 6 A 37 to models of the singly modified ASL Lys UUU -\u03c8 39 also enhanced the stacking interaction of A 37 with U 36 and created a more defined positioning of U 36 . 41 According to the models, neither the mcm 5nor s 2 -moieties of U 34 were sufficient to promote a canonical U-turn conformation. However, the singly modified ASL with mcm 5 s 2 U 34 showed many U-turn NMR indicators. 41 These models suggested a role for the ms 2 t 6 A 37 in negating intraloop interactions, ordering of the anticodon loop conformation and stabilizing the weak U 36 \u2022A1 pair while mcm 5 s 2 U 34 enhanced anticodon base stacking and promoted the canonical U-turn conformation.",

Here we conclusively show that the fully modified solution structure conforms to a structure that shows only minor differences from the stably bound crystal structure in the ribosomal A-site. In fact, our data also supports the notion that the pre-structuring has underlying thermodynamic causes and allows for a novel keto-enol mechanism of exclusively recognizing purines at the third codon position.",

The negative 330 nm and positive 330 nm signals observed in the CD spectrum of the modified ASLs were due to the presence of the 2-thio modification of uridine as previously observed, 43 confirming the presence of this modification in the doubly and triply modified ASLs. The slightly higher value of the positive ellipticityat 264 nm found in the case of the hASL Lys3 UUUmcm 5 s 2 U 34 ;ms 2 t 6 A 37 ;\u03c8 39 indicated that the bases were involved in stacking interactions that exceeded those of both the unmodified hASL Lys3 UUU and the doubly modified hASL Lys3 UUU -mcm 5 s 2 U 34 ;ms 2 t 6 A 37 (Fig. 3d) . These results are not surprising as the introduction of mcm 5 s 2 U 34 and ms 2 t 6 A 37 negated intra-loop hydrogen bonding, reducing the melting temperature and enthalpy of base stacking.Indeed it has been shown that modifications most likely affect codon bias by contributing significantly to the thermodynamic stability and structural characteristics of htRNA Lys3 UUU . Modifications of the Watson-Crick face of the invariant purine 37 decrease the thermal stability of the ASL by negating intra-loop hydrogen bonds and by widening the loop, as was initially found for the m 1 G 37 of yeast tRNA Phe . 11, 65, 67 The modification of A 37 to t 6 A 37 and to ms 2 t 6 A 37 in an otherwise unmodified anticodon stem and loop domain of htRNA Lys3 UUU resulted in decreases in thermal stability of 2-3 and 5 \u00b0C, respectively. 53, 68 {Bajji, 2002 #465}However, by negating the intra-loop hydrogen bonding, the base stacking at the base of the stem is alleviated, which resulted in only minor differences in ellipticity between the constructs. \u03c8 39 is known to stabilize tRNA's anticodon domain, 66,69 but does not appear to effect codon binding. 69 The presence of pseudouridine at position-39 enhanced the interaction with A 31 that constitutes the closing base pair of the stem 40,41,66 and stabilized the canonical U-turn conformation, 41 thereby raising the thermal stability of the ASL and increasing the base stacking of the anticodon residues.",

The invariant chemical shifts were mostly seen for the residues of the stem attesting that the presence of mcm 5 s 2 U 34 and ms 2 t 6 A 37 in the loop did not structurally influence the helical A-RNA conformation of the stem. The greater distance observed between ms 2 t 6 A 37 and U 36 could have been induced by the large atomic radius of the sulfur group trying to accommodate itself between the above residues. The short distances found between the labile proton of the acid group of ms 2 t 6 A 37 and mcm 5 s 2 U 34 /U 35 O4 and between A 36 N6 and C 32 O2 invoked the potential hydrogen bonding that restrained the threonyl group of ms 2 t 6 A 37 to be positioned across the loop region. As a result the loop extension was limited. The NOE observed between C 10 H 3 and s 2 -CH 3 indicated the close spatial proximity (4 -5 \u00c5) of these two groups. As a result, a clear orientation of these methyl groups was obtained during the solution structure determination of the doubly modified ASL Lys3 UUU . The lack of a complete set of the signature NMR resonances for a U-turn indicated that the loop of the modified hASL Lys3 UUU did not have a canonical U-turn, but nonetheless exhibited a backbone turn at U 33 in the NMR-restrained molecular dynamics derived structure.",

This comparison strongly supports the hypothesis that modifications prestructure tRNA`s anticodon domain for codon binding. 1 The crystal structures reported here, bound to AAA/G, are nearly superimposable, with a heavy atom rmsd of 0.45 \u00c5 (Supplementary Fig. S8 ,and Table S3a ). The most notable difference between these two structures and the anticodon domain of the full length, fully modified tRNA Lys3 UUU occurs at the base of the stem. In the crystal structure of tRNA Lys3 UUU , A 31 forms a planar, stable base pair with U 39 , 54 but in the co-crystal structures on the ribosome, the A 38 residue is rotated out of plane indicating a less stable base pair and possibly contributing to the opening of the loop. Interestingly, in the solution structure we observe that the ms 2 t 6 A 37 causes a slight perturbation of the C 32 \u2022A 38 mismatch base pair by enhancing the stacking interaction of A 38 with A 37 and causing a displacement of ~0.4 \u00c5. These data suggest that both \u03c8 39 andms t 6 A 37 cooperatively extend the distance between C 32 and A 38 to abrogate the mismatch pair, forcing the loop into the open conformation necessary for a stable U-turn. Indeed, the distance and geometry between C 32 and A 38 in all three crystal structures would not be amenable to a stable cross-loop interaction.",

            "text": "A lack of significant differences between the ASL of the full length tRNAcrystal structure and the co-crystals of the ASLs bound to the ribosome reveal that the functional binding results associated with using the truncated anticodon domain are a reasonable measure of the decoding capacity of the full length tRNA. It should also be noted that although an NMRderived solution structure of the fully modified ASL was not obtained, it can be assumed that the addition of the \u03c8 at position 39 would further drive the formation of a canonical Uturn in solution. 66, 69 An induced fit model of decoding, in which the ASL would conform to a U-turn upon entering the ribosomal A-site is not consistent with the data due to the clear evidence from the crystal structure of the full length tRNA of a pre-structured, U-turn containing anticodon domain prior to entering the A-site. 54 Curiously, the high degree of structural conservation (rmsd = 0.65 \u2212 0.77 \u00c5, Supplementary Table S3a-c) between the crystal and the solution structures of the hASL Lys3 UUU -mcm 5 s 2 U 34 ;ms 2 t 6 A 37 ;\u03c8 39 bound in the A-site suggests that in comparison, the anticodon domains of the partially modified E. coli ASLs incurred a degree of conformational change during codon recognition. 25 The AAG codon binding of the hASL Lys3 UUU -mcm 5 s 2 U 34 ;ms 2 t 6 A 37 exhibits an mcm 5 s 2 U 34 \u2022G3 pairing that is a Watson-Crick pair with three hydrogen bonds, one of which involves the s 2 -modication. The hydrogen bond between the iminonitrogens of mcm 5 s 2 U 34 and G3 of the codon requires a keto-enoltautomerism similar to the mechanism by which cmo 5 U 34 enables ASL Val3 to respond to all four codons in its degenerate box. 52 While the current mcm 5 s 2 U 34 \u2022G3 base pair structure agrees well with that of cmo 5 U 34 \u2022G3. 52 it stands in stark contrast to the structure of mnm 5 U 34 \u2022G3, 25 in which the modified U makes a threecentered hydrogen bond to G3 and partially stacks on U 35 (Fig. 7c) . The equilibrium shift from the keto to enol tautomer inherent to these two modified nucleosides may suggest either a role of the cmo 5 or the s 2 and mcm 5 modifications in altering the electronic structure of the aromatic base or a local pH change in the environment in the immediate vicinity of the wobble base pair. It is critical to note that the mnm 5 U 34 is missing the naturallyoccurring 2-thio modification, so its stacking potential and electronic structure is not that which occurs in nature. The difference in binding modes could be due to the fact that the previous work is a different modification that does not affect the keto-enol equilibrium and thus does not allow a Watson-Crick base pair as for cmo 5 U 34 and mcm 5 s 2 U 34 and that the observed structure is what will occur for the fully-modified ASL. The partially modified ASL Lys UUU -mnm 5 U 34 binds the cognate AAA, but not the wobble codon AAG, while the unmodified E. coliASL Lys UUU binds neither codon. 8 We find it more likely that the previous, partially modified structure behaves differently from the fully modified mnm 5 s 2 U 34 \u2022G3, and that the fully modified structure would be very similar to the current structure. The thio modifications have been shown to be used to stack with adjacent rings for modifications at position-34 and 37, and were mnm 5 U 34 to be fully thiolated, stacking on U 35 would require moving into Watson-Crick geometry. This is an excellent illustration of how finely tuned codon-anticodon interactions are, with the lack of one sulfur atom and presence of an oxygen disrupting the true structure of the codon-anticodon complex. 6 Differences in modification between the bacterial and eukaryotic tRNA Lys perhaps indicatethe co-evolution of anticodon modifications with codon bias and the use of less common tRNAisoacceptorsfor control of gene expression. Half of all bacteria have but the one tRNA Lys with the UUU anticodon that reads the predominant codon AAA. The same tRNAreads the rarer codon AAG. In contrast, the additional isoacceptors tRNA Lys1&2 in mammalian cells have the anticodon CUU and respond only to AAG, the preferred lysine codon by a factor of two. The amount of tRNA Lys3 is only a third of the total amount of tRNA Lys required for protein synthesis in mammalian cells. This leads one to the concept of codon bias being linked to tRNAisoacceptor abundance in the cell. 15 tRNA abundance, in turn is also correlated to environmental responses. 15 By pre-structuring the nucleoside geometry and backbone conformation, the tRNA Lys3 modifications certainly alter the presentation of anticodon nucleosides for codon recognition. tRNA Lys1,2 do not require t 6 A 37 for binding of the AAG codon, 8 but the anticodon modification t 6 A 37 that is common to all isoacceptors appears to be a recognition determinant for the lysyl-tRNAsynthetases. The difference in modifications between tRNA Lys3 and tRNA Lys1,2 implicate tRNA Lys3 modifications in regulatinggene expression inmammalian cells through codon usage. Since lysine codons share a mixed codon box with the two asparagine codons, the major difference between isoacceptorsis located at the wobble position. Thus, the chemistries, structures and physical volumes of post-transcriptional modifications alter tRNA's anticodon conformation and restrict its dynamics for protein synthesis as had been proposed twenty years previously in a modified wobble hypothesis. 1",

After cooling, the samples were lyophilized using a freeze-dryer (Thermo Savant SPD Speed Vac, Thermo Scientific) and then dissolved in 99.996% 2 H 2 O or a 90% 1 H 2 O+10% 2 H 2 O mixture to give a final volume of 300 \u03bcL. Samples in 2 H 2 O were re-dissolved in 2 H 2 O at least twice more and lyophilized. NMR samples of the ASLs were generally at concentrations of 1.5 mM.",

The 27-nt mRNA oligonucleotide sequences were derived from T4 gp32 mRNA 71 and were purchased from Dharmacon (ThermoFisher, Lafayette, CO). In order to study binding at the ribosomal Asite, the P-site needed to be blocked. Therefore, the mRNA was designed with the Methionine (Met) codon AUG at the P-site. The E. colitRNA fMet was then used to saturate the P-site. Possible secondary structure folding of each mRNA sequence was assessed with the program RNA Structure 4.2 72 and resulted in a low probability of any secondary structure that may obstruct binding of the mRNA to the ribosome.

The assay was performed in ribosomal binding buffer [50 mM HEPES, pH 7.0; 30 mMKCl; 70 mM NH4Cl; 1 mM DTT; 100 \u03bcM EDTA; 20 mM MgCl 2 ). Ribosomes (0.25\u03bcM) were activated by heating to 42\u00b0C, incubating for 10 min and then slowly cooled to 37\u00b0C. The ribosomes were programmed with 2.5 \u03bcM mRNA for 15 min at 37\u00b0C.

After filtration of reaction samples, each well was then washed twice with 100 \u03bcL of cold binding buffer. The nitrocellulose was blotted dry with Kimwipes (Kimberly-Clark), and the radioactivity was measured using a phosphorimager (Molecular Dynamics, GE Healthcare). Data were measured for radioactive intensity using ImageQuant (Amersham). Nonspecific binding was determined by the binding of ASLs to ribosomes without mRNA and subtracted from the experimental data.
