The membranes were then irradiated with UV light for 2-5 min. Hybridisation to appropriate 32p_ !abelled probes (see below) and autoradiography were per-formed according to Wahl et al. (1979) . After hybridisation to one probe and autoradiography, some filters were washed extensively and rehybridised to a second probe. A nonpolyadenylated RNA sample was included in each gel to provide rRNA molecular size markers (5.0 and 2.0 kilobases). In order to visualise the markers and the amount of RNA present in each lane, the gels were stained with ethidium bromide. The ethidium bromide staining indicated that all lanes contained approximately equivalent amounts of RNA. The relative abundance of specific transcripts in the different lanes was determined by densitometric analysis of the autoradiographs employing a Molecular Dynamics 300A computing densitometer (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA). 'Fold induction' in a specific RNA was calculated as the ratio of the mean value (four or six animals/group) of abundance of that RNA in rats fed the BR391 diets to the corresponding value of the same RNA present in age-matched rats fed the basal diets (Govindarajulu, 1988 (Gonda et al., 1982) ; Ha-ras-specific insert, 460-base EcoRI fragment excised from the BS-9 clone (Ellis et al., 1980) ; c-myc, a 1.5kilobase PstI fragment excised from a pBR322 clone (Stanton et al., 1983) ; epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor, a 768-base EcoRI fragment excised from HER64.3 plasmid (Ullrich et al., 1984) ; and ODC, a 2.4-kilobase EcoRI-BamHI fragment excised from pmODC-l plasmid (Kahana & Nathans, 1985) .

Messenger RNA transcripts, about 6.8 kilobases long, homologous to RaLV were detected in all of the liver samples from rats fed either the basal or BR931 diet. The results obtained with 12 representative samples are known in Figure la . There was some interindividual variation in the level of expression of RaLV transcripts between animals in the same treatment group. The BR931 diet led to a slight increase (about 1.7-fold) in the level of RaLV RNA (Table I) , when compared to agematched rats fed the basal diet. The level of these transcripts was found to be increased as early as day 3, which decreased to almost the control level at day 14 after the start of the BR931 diet. Messenger RNA transcripts homologous to RaLV were also detected in the liver tumour samples and in all of the 'normal' tumour-adjacent liver samples ( Figure 2 ). The relative abundance of these transcripts was increased (about 2-fold) in liver tumours induced by BR931, when compared to the results obtained with liver RNA samples obtained from age-matched rats fed the basal diets (Table II) .

The ability of this compound to induce peroxisome proliferation has been implicated in its carcinogenicity, presumably through the production of oxygen radicals by these organelles (Reddy et al., 1980; Fahl et al., 1984) . However, recent studies indicate that the ability of these compounds to induce sustained enhancement of liver cell proliferation, and not the degree of peroxisome proliferation, correlates with the degree of tumour response (Marsman et al., 1988) . Furthermore, unlike hepatomas and their precursor lesions induced by classic hepatocarcinogens,those induced by hypolipidemic peroxisome proliferators do not express the enzymes y-glutamyltranspeptidase and glutathione-S-transferase (Rao et al., 1982; ibid, 1986) . The present studies were, therefore, designed -to investigate certain proliferation-related changes-in gene expression in rats fed a BR931 containing diet for a 8 week period and also in liver tumours eventually produced by this diet.",

Increased levels of these RNAs were also seen in liver tumours induced by the BR931 diet, when compared to normal liver samples from age-matched rats fed the basal diet. The levels of RNA transcripts homologous to 30S retrovirus-like sequences did not, however, change during the first 8 weeks of feeding the BR931 diet. Nor, was their increased expression of 30S-related RNAs in the liver tumours. Previously studies from this laboratory have shown that there is a marked increase in the expression of endogenous retroviral sequences related to both RaLV and 30S in diethylnitrosamine-induced rat hepatocellular adenomas and carcinomas (Hsieh et al., 1987) . We also found a dramatic increase in the level of RaLV-related RNAs but not 30S RNAs during liver regeneration induced by partial hepatectomy . In cell culture studies we have also demonstrated increased expression of RaLVand 30Srelated sequences in log-phase rat fibroblast cells, when compared to quiescent cells (Hsieh-& Weinstein, 1990) . Thus increased expression of these endogenous retrovirus-related genes is often associated with cell proliferation, but the results obtained with the 30S sequence suggest that other factors also control its expression.",

            "text": "We observed a marked increases in the level of c-myc RNA during the first 8 weeks of feeding BR931. Higher levels of c-myc RNA were found in the control rat livers at day 3 than at day 56, which is consistent with the association of c-myc RNA with proliferation. After adjustment of -this age factor, increased expression of c-myc (about 3-fold) was found throughout the 8 week period of feeding BR931. Increased expression of c-myc RNA was also observed in the liver tumour samples induced by BR931 diet, when compared to age-matched rats fed the basal diet. Previous results indicated that during rat liver regeneration there is a marked increase in the level of c-myc RNA, which precedes the peak of DNA synthesis , suggesting that c-myc plays a role in regulating the entry of hepatocytes into the cell cycle. We observed only a slight increase in the level of c-H-ras RNA during the first 8 weeks of feeding the BR931 diet and no significant increase was seen in the liver tumour samples. A slight increase in the level of c-H-ras RNA was seen in regeneration rat liver . Thus, increased expression of the c-H-ras gene does not appear to play an important role in hepatocyte proliferation. ODC is the first and rate-limiting enzyme in the biosynthesis of polyamines in mammalian cells, and increases in ODC enzyme activity are frequently associated with cell proliferation (Pegg & McCann, 1982) . In the present studies we found increased levels of ODC RNA in rat livers during the first 8 weeks of feeding the BR931 diet and also in the liver tumour samples induced by this diet. These results provide further evidence that this drug induces the expression of markers associated with cell proliferation.",

            "text": "We observed about a 3-fold decrease in the abundance of EGF receptor RNA transcripts in rat livers during the first 8 weeks of feeding the BR931 diet, and a similar decrease was seen in the liver tumours induced by this diet. Previous studies showed a marked suppression in EGF receptor binding in liver samples within 3 days after rats were fed the same BR931 diet (Gupta et al., 1988) , and other -investigators (Bartles et al., 1990) have described a decrease in EGF receptor protein and certain other plasma membrane proteins in rat liver after the administration of peroxisome proliferators. These investigators did not, however, examine EGF receptor mRNA levels. It has also been reported that partial hepatectomy and phenobarbital treatment caused a decrease in EGF receptor binding (Earp & O'Keefe, 1981; Eckl et al., 1988) , and in the level of EGF receptor mRNA . Rat liver tumours induced by diethylnitrosamine also display a decrease in EGF receptor binding and EGF receptor mRNA (Hsieh et al., 1987) . A recent study indicates that the feeding of a methy-deficient diet also leads to a decrease in the level of EGF receptor mRNA in the livers of mice, within 7 days of the onset of this diet (Hsieh et al., 1989) . Taken together these findings provide strong evidence that alterations in the function of EGF may play an important role in liver cell proliferation and hepatocarcinogenesis, although the underlying mechanisms are not known at the present time. In summary, the present studies indicate that the feeding of drug BR931, which induces a peroxisome proliferation in rodent livers and is a hepatocarcinogen, induces increased in the expression of several genes related to cell proliferation, including: RaLV-related sequences, c-myc, c-H-ras, and ODC; but decreased expression of the EGF receptor gene. Furthermore, liver tumours induced by the long term feeding of the BR931 diet showed similar changes in the expression of these genes. It is of interest that the increased levels of RNA for RaLV, 30S, c-myc, and ODC; and the decreased levels of RNA for EGF receptor seen in the liver tumours induced by BR931 were also seen in the 'normal' tumouradjacent liver samples obtained from the same animals (Tables I and II ). This suggests that the compound BR931 produces long term alterations in gene expression related to cell proliferation throughout the liver of rats receiving this compound. Further studies are required to determine whether the altered levels of specific mRNAs found in the present study reflect changes at the level of transcription or RNA stabilisation, and whether these changes are due to a primary effect of the drug BR931 or are secondary to the induction of peroxisome proliferation. Since these changes in gene expression occur relatively early (within 3 days) after onset of the feeding of this drug they may provide a useful marker for the mechanisms by which this and related drugs eventually induce liver -tumours in rodents. Our findings on altered gene expression may also be relevant to the mechanisms of action of the peroxisome proliferator class of compounds, in view of the recent cloning of a peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor which is a member of the steroid hormone receptor superfamily. Presumably this protein functions as a transcription factor that is specifically activated by peroxisome proliferators and may, therefore, mediate the numerous effects of this class of agents (Isseman & Green, 1990) .",
