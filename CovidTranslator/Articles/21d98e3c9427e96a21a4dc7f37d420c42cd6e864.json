We assessed the short-term mortality effects of daily loss of visibility. During 1996-2006, we obtained mortality data for non-accidental and cardiorespiratory causes, visibility recorded as visual range in kilometers, temperature, and relative humidity from an urban observatory, and concentrations of four criteria pollutants. A generalized additive Poisson regression model with penalized cubic regression splines was fitted to control for time variant covariates. For non-accidental mortality, an interquartile range (IQR) of 6.5 km decrease in visibility at lag 0-1 days was associated with an excess risk (ER%) [95% CI] of 1.13 [0.49, 1.76] for all ages and 1.37 [0.65, 2.09] for ages 65 years and over; for cardiovascular mortality of 1.31 [0.13, 2.49] for all ages, and 1.72 [0.44, 3.00] for ages 65 years and over; and for respiratory mortality of 1.92 [0.49, 3.35] for all ages and 1. 76 [0.28, 3.25] for ages 65 years and over. The estimated ER% for daily mortality derived from both visibility and air pollutant data were comparable in terms of magnitude, lag pattern, and exposure-response relationships especially when using particulate matter with aerodynamic diameter r 10 mm to predict the mortality associated with visibility. Visibility provides a useful proxy for the assessment of environmental health risks from ambient air pollutants and a valid approach for the assessment of the public health impacts of air pollution and the benefits of air quality improvement measures in developing countries where pollutant monitoring data are scarce.",

Hong Kong is located in the Pearl River Delta region in southern China where increasing fossil fuel consumption has resulted in a rapid growth of anthropogenic emissions and thereby has led to an increase in air pollution and degradation in visibility (Streets and Waldhoff, 2000) . This is attributed to increase in the concentrations of fine particulate matter (PM 2.5 ) and photochemical pollutants, which increase the scattering of light (Sequeira and Lai, 1998a; Ho et al., 2003) .",

Air pollution has been identified as a major cause of increasing community costs due to health care utilization and lost productivity . Previous studies, which assessed the association between fine particulates and mortality used various measures as indicators of air pollution, including coefficient of extinction, coefficient of haze, and airport visibility to estimate PM 2.5 and PM 10 (Ozkaynak et al., 1985; Abbey et al., 1995; Ostro, 1995; Vajanapoom et al., 2001; Jerrett et al., 2004) . However, apart from two studies, one showing that visibility loss was directly associated with sudden infant death syndrome in Taiwan (Knobel et al., 1995) and a second on the relationship between visibility and population mortality in Shanghai (Huang et al., 2009) , no other reports have shown links between visibility and ill health or mortality. We aimed to assess the associations between variations in daily visibility and mortality in Hong Kong for the period 1996-2006 using several sensitivity analyses based on the mean visibility recorded at 10:00, 14:00, and 16:00 h, 24 h maximum visibility, different cut-off limits for humidity, and adjustments for air pollutants.",

The main health outcome of this study comprised all known nonaccidental deaths of Hong Kong residents (ICD-9:1-799; ICD-10: A00-R99), as well as cardiovascular (ICD-9:390-459; ICD-10:I00-I99), respiratory (ICD-9:460-519; ICD-10:J00-J98), and accidental mortalities (ICD-9: 800-999; ICD-10: S00-T98). We chose two age groups for analyses: all ages and a subgroup aged 65 years and over. An assessment of the discrepancy between the classification of causes of deaths using ICD-9 and ICD-10 showed that agreement between the two coding systems was over 90% (Hong Kong Department of Health, 2005).",

Dummy variables were used to control the variations for days of the week, holidays, and influenza epidemics. We added a dummy variable for the 2003 severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) epidemic. We chose 4 degrees of freedom (df) per year for smoothing function of the trends and 3 df for temperature and humidity. The choice of df for each smoothing function in the core models was made on the basis of observed residual autocorrelations using partial autocorrelation function (PACF). For the core models fitted to the mortality data, time variant confounding factors were considered as adequately controlled if absolute values of PACF coefficients were o 0.1 for the first two lag days and there were no systematic patterns in the PACF plots (Wong et al., 2008a) .",

We found that the visibility effect estimates for mortality were comparable to those derived from specific air pollutants with respect to the magnitude, lag pattern, and the shape of exposure-response curves especially compared to the results derived from PM 10 concentrations. The strongest association between visibility and mortality was for respiratory causes. In Hong Kong, fine particulate matter was the main contributor to the reduction in visibility with ammonium sulfate from regional sources being the largest component (51%) (Wang, 2003) and based on our limited data on PM 2.5 for one station from 1998 to 2006, the Spearman correlation between visibility and PM 2.5 was \u00c0 0.78 (data not shown). This high correlation suggests that the use of the visual range as a measure of fine respirable particulates is a good proxy for estimating the effects of combustion particulates on mortality outcomes. The strongest effects on mortality were those associated with NO 2 concentrations (data not shown), consistent with our previous analyses (Wong et al.

            "text": "2008a). It is noteworthy that PM 10 was strongly correlated with other pollutants, particularly with NO 2 , and the strong PM 10 correlation with NO 2 may have contributed to the ability to detect the effects of visibility on mortality. The size of the effects and the cause-specific pattern of mortality indicate that some susceptible groups in the population may benefit more from improvements in the visibility range particularly among individuals with cardiovascular and respiratory diseases. The linear effect seen in all mortality outcomes and age groups suggests that there is no clear threshold value and the effect estimates from this study are consistent with a linear model without threshold for PM 10 demonstrated in studies from Asia, West Europe, and North America (Daniels et al., 2000; Samoli et al., 2006; Pope and Dockery, 2006; Wong et al., 2008a) . Further evidence on linear relationships between daily visibility and daily deaths in vulnerable subgroups, compared to the general population, would be provided by further cohort studies with both short-and long-term outcomes.",

Sequeira and Lai (1998b) suggested a cut-off limit of 80% in humidity for assessing the visibility in Hong Kong, which lies close to the coast. This limit might remove measurements in which high levels of particulate matter were also associated with high humidity conditions; however, sensitivity analyses with these more stringent cut-off limits and excluding periods of fog and precipitation have not significantly affected our estimates of associations between visibility and mortality. They did not alter the conclusion that improved visibility leads to health benefits and that the estimation of low visibility is an effective surrogate for air pollutants in this region.",

They are more representative of regional visibility levels because daytime and nighttime visibilities are often incompatible and early morning fogs and high humidity, which may affect local conditions, are dispersed by midday (Ozkaynak et al., 1985; Abbey et al., 1995) . Sensitivity analyses showed that different measures of visibility such as taking the mean visibility based on the three measurements recorded at 10:00, 14:00, and 16:00 h led to substantial decreases in the estimates by more than 20% compared to those from 24 h mean visibility.

One major problem has been the inadequate data on the ambient mass concentrations of the criteria air pollutants, but good visibility measurements are routinely recorded at most meteorological stations and at airfields, and often available over several years. In the absence of air pollutant data, the use of visibility measures can be deployed quickly by environmental health authorities for estimating the health effects of air pollution including the shape of exposure-response curves for mortality. This locally generated evidence can provide important support for public health through air quality improvement policies, particularly because of its potential to protect the health of susceptible subgroups in the population, including those who are socioeconomically deprived (Ou et al., 2008; Wong et al., 2008b) .",

The analytic method used in this study follows the current standard approach adopted in the assessment the of short-term effects of air pollution on mortality in daily time series studies . An important feature of this method is that the likelihood of confounding effects Table 3 Estimated excess risks (ER%) for daily mortality and associated 95% confidence intervals (CI) per interquartile range decease in visibility (6.5 km) at lag 0-1days for nonaccidental mortality at all ages compared with sensitivity analyses. of visibility is minimized by removing other factors, which may be associated with variations in mortality. Once the core models were determined, visibility was entered to identify associations between visibility and mortality. So all potential observable time variant and unobservable confounding effects would have been reduced. Our data on visibility, air pollutants, mortality, and meteorology are reliable in that they have undergone rigorous quality control procedures performed independently by several government departments. Some limitations were present in our study. First, even though our conclusion has internal consistency, it needs to be replicated in other jurisdictions because of different methodologies, which may be adopted for visibility and air pollutant measurements and the properties of air pollutant mixtures, which, especially for particulates, could be different from Hong Kong. Second, it must include recognition that visibility observations are surrogate measures of pollutants and not a measure of exposure, and that they could be misclassified because of the inherently subjective nature of visibility measurements, but these errors would ultimately bias the outcomes towards the null effect. Finally, as in all time series studies, data on mortality and covariates are collected at the aggregated level and caution should be exercised in drawing a causal association between the underlying effects of poor visibility and mortality.",
