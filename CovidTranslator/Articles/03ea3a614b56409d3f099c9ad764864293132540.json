While frameshifting is generally detrimental to protein fidelity (Belew et al., 2014; Choi et al., 2015) , the process effectively creates two distinct proteins from a single RNA (Clark et al., 2007; Meydan et al., 2017; Yordanova et al., 2015) . Viruses exploit this aspect of frameshifting to minimize their genomes and to successfully replicate in host cells (Brierley and Dos Ramos, 2006; Brierley et al., 1989; Caliskan et al., 2015; Cardno et al., 2015; Mouzakis et al., 2013) .

This leaves many basic questions about frameshifting unresolved. In particular, it is not clear how heterogenous frameshifting is from one RNA to another, nor is it clear if single RNA continuously frameshift in a constitutive fashion or if instead they frameshift in definable bursts, as has been observed for transcription (Lionnet and Singer, 2012) and 0-frame translation (Wu et al., 2016) . Finally, the localization of frameshifting has never been investigated, so it is not clear if frameshifting occurs all throughout the cell or is instead preferentially localized to specific sub-cellular regions. In the case of HIV-1 gag-pol, for example, previous assays have shown that 5-10% of translated protein product is frameshifted (Brierley and Dos Ramos, 2006; Dulude et al., 2002; Grentzmann et al., 1998; Mouzakis et al., 2013) . This is thought to occur when ribosomes translate through a specialized frameshift sequence (FSS) containing a stem loop structure that slows down incoming ribosomes and causes them to slip back one nucleotide on a slippery sequence preceding the stem loop. Whether or not this occurs constitutively and with equal probability on all HIV-1 RNA or if instead it occurs on a specialized subset that are in the right place, at the right time, and with the right factors remains to be determined.",

Using multi-frame repeat epitopes, complementary high-affinity fluorescent probes that selectively bind the epitopes, and multicolor single-molecule microscopy, we are able to simultaneously monitor the translation of single RNA into two unique nascent polypeptide chains encoded in shifted open reading frames. Application to the HIV-1 FSS uncovers unexpected heterogeneity in the production of frameshifted product and implicates a novel bursty frameshifting mechanism. Besides frameshifting, our technology can now be used to examine other translational regulatory dynamics, including upstream open reading frame selection, non-canonical initiation, and ribosomal shunting. We anticipate multi-frame nascent chain tracking will be a powerful new tool to dissect complex translational regulatory dynamics in living cells and organisms.",

In the MF tag, FLAG epitopes in the 0 frame are separated from one another by SunTag epitopes in the -1 frame. With this arrangement, single RNAs with ribosomes translating the 0 frame will produce FLAG epitopes labeled by Fab, while those with ribosomes translating the -1 frame will produce SunTag epitopes labeled by scFv. Thus, depending on the chosen frame(s), polysomes will appear all green (all ribosomes translating the 0 frame), all blue (all ribosomes translating the -1 frame), or some combination of the two (Fig. 1A) .",

In combination with the epitopes, this arrangement has several advantages: 1) epitope densities are maximal since -1 frame epitopes act as linkers for the 0 frame and vice versa; 2) signals are digital, so frameshifted and non-frameshifted species are marked by two distinct probes/colors, and 3) epitopes are placed in nearly equivalent positions, so signals appear at roughly the same time and with similar amplification when translated with similar kinetics.",

Specifically, sites translating the -1 frame had an average RNA intensity that was nearly 30% brighter than RNA only spots ( Fig. 2B and S5A ). In addition, these brighter frameshifting sites were translation-dependent, dissociating upon puromycin treatment (Movie S7). We wondered if this might be an artifact due to the aggregation of probes. Self-aggregation of Fab was unlikely as this would cause 0-frame translation sites to also be brighter, which was not the case (Fig. 2B) . Similarly, it was unlikely to be due to self-aggregation of scFv, as this would cause 0-frame translation sites to be brighter in the reverse MF tag, which was also not the case (Fig. S5B ). This left the possibility that Fab aggregate with scFv. To rule this out, we reimaged the MF tag without Fab. As frameshifting translation sites remained brighter than other sites ( Fig.   S5C ), we conclude the brighter RNA signal is not a tagging artifact, but instead represents a propensity for frameshifting sites to associate with other translating RNA in higher-order complexes reminiscent of \"translation factories\" (Morisaki et al., 2016; Pichon et al., 2016) .",

This led to a significant increase in the fraction of frameshifting sites translating just the -1 frame, from 1.6 to 5.6% when 1 \uf06dg oligo was added, and up to 9.5% when 4 \uf06dg oligo was added (Fig. 3A,B) . The significant increase in the -1 only sites suggests RNA can exist in a state in which all or nearly all ribosomes are frameshifted. Moreover, frameshifting continued to occur preferentially within factories, having RNA signals from 30 to 50% brighter than RNA-only spots (Fig. 3C) , even though the overall fraction of RNA within factories remained unchanged (Fig. S6 ).",

S9 and S10). We observed this trend even at the single-molecule level, where the total number of ribosomes (marked by HA) dropped, but the number of Such a release can be seen in the single-molecule track at the ~1000 s time point, when the frameshift signal gets significantly brighter. Interestingly, this increase in brightness coincided with the association of an additional non-translating +FSS RNA (gray arrows in Fig. 4C ).

We explored if codon usage could also explain the differences in run-off times. However, according to the codon adaptation index (Gorgoni et al., 2016; Sharp and Li, 1987) , which is related to the speed at which each codon is translated in the simulation, there is no notable difference between the 0 and -1 frames ( Fig. S14) .

These traffic jams would continue to build for as long as the RNA remains in the frameshifted state, or approximately 1/ = 770 s on average. This would allow for the accumulation of approximately ( \u2212 * ) / ~ 7 ribosomes (on the HA multi-frame tag, Table 1 ). Occasionally, traffic jams can extend all the way back to the start codon, as seen in a sample simulation (Movie S11). However, because these traffic jams occur upstream of the FSS within the HA epitope repeats, the nascent chain intensity at translation sites is only partially correlated with ribosomal occupancy. As a result, the model predicts frameshifting sites are slightly brighter than non-frameshifting sites ( Fig.   5G ), which we also observe experimentally (Fig. S15 ). Moreover, due to the long time it can take to clear traffic jams, frameshifting can persist for hours following the global shut down of translation initiation (with harringtonine, for example), as can be seen in simulations of the best-fit model (Movie S12) and consistent with what we observed in Figs. 4C and S11. Thus, the final bursty model suggests a mechanism by which frameshifting can persist for long periods in the absence of translation initiation.",

Fifth, DMEM was immediately added back to the cells. Sixth, cells were returned to the incubator for at least an hour to recover from the loading procedure. In most experiments, we also bead-loaded DNA, which we added to the initial 4 \u00b5l mix (so that DNA had a final concentration close to 1 mg/ml). On occasion, DNA was transiently transfected ~2 hours before bead-loading. Around one hour before experiments began, bead-loaded cells were washed with phenol-red-free complete DMEM to remove glass beads, and 200 nM of JF646-HaloTag ligand (a cell permeable fluorogenic ligand (Grimm et al., 2015) ) was added to label MCP-HaloTag protein. After 30 mins of incubation, cells were washed three times using phenol-red-free complete DMEM to remove any unconjugated fluorophores. Cells were then immediately imaged for experiments.",

The average intensity of single RNAs were also calculated using the same procedure ( Fig. 3C , S5, and S6).

(B) Average images of detected spots (33 mature proteins and 35 translation sites) were fit to a Gaussian to determine their intensity ratio, shown in the bar graph on the right. This ratio provides a calibration factor to convert translation site intensites to the number of riboeoms. The error bar represents the propagated 90% confidence interval from the fit. Error bars represent the fitted 90% confidence interval. Aside from the -FSS control, frameshifting sites (-1 TS) have significantly brighter RNA signals compared to canonical translation sites (0 TS). Note the frameshifting observed in the -FSS control represents less than 1% of translating RNA and can be considered background frameshifting. Figure S6 . Upon oligo RNA co-transfection, stimulated frameshifting still occurs at bright RNA sites, even though the fraction of bright RNA sites remains unchanged (A) Average RNA signals from non-translating RNA (no TS), 0-frame only translation sites (0 TS), and frameshifting translation sites (-1 TS) when different concentrations of oligo RNA (0, 1, and 4 mg) encoding the frameshift sequence were co-transfected into cells with the +FSS multi-frame reporter or the control -FSS reporter. The bar graph above shows the Gaussian fit intensity (normalized to non-translating RNA, i.e. 0 TS sites). (B) The distributions of RNA signals from the four experiments normalized to their mean value. In all +FSS experiments, the fraction of bright RNA (defined here as having an intensity greater than or equal to 1.6 times the mean) remained constant. The -FSS experiment had fewer bright RNA, suggesting the FSS sequence facilitates incorporation into multi-RNA sites.",

Data is taken from Fig. 4A . If L2 is the length of the tagged portion of the open reading frame and L1 is the length of the non-tagged portion, then the linear (post-tag) portion of the decay begins from approximately L1/(L1+L2/2). This portion of the curve provides an estimate of the elongation rate during the part of the run-off where no new epitopes are being translated. Therefore, the run-off fit is independent of the frameshifting kinetics that occur upstream of the epitopes. Curves are normalized to their initial values. Figure 4B . The Sun signal comes from frameshifted ribosomes that have run past the frameshift sequence (FSS). Error bars represent S.E.M. Figure S10 . Ribosome run-off from FLAG epitopes in HA multi-frame tag For completeness, an additional experiment was performed to generate the ribosome run-off curve from FLAG epitopes in the HA multi-frame tag. Because we can only image two epitopes at the same time (since RNA is imaged in a third color), we examined FLAG and Sun epitopes (Sun epitopes were required to distinguish frameshifting and non-frameshifting sites). The FLAG run-off from this experiment is on the right (green triangles). This curve is compared to the run-off curve of HA in HA only sites (orange squares) from Figure 4B . Both experiments represent nonframeshifting sites (no Sun signal detected). Error bars represent S.E.M.",
