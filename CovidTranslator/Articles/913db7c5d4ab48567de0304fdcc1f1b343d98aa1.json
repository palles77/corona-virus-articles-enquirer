Standard supportive care was employed. Thirty-one patients with a median age of 43 (23-67) met the criteria for this case review. 30 had B-ALL and 10 were Philadelphia chromosome positive. 24 patients (77%) had high risk disease by standard diagnostic criteria. 27 (87%) were in first complete remission (CR1). Matched sibling donors were used in 13 instances with the remaining being fully matched unrelated donors. 58% of patients had a HCT-CI score of 0, 32% a score of 1 or 2 with 3 patients having a score of 3 or higher.

Background: Although relapse is a major cause of mortality in patients receiving allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) for acute leukemia, limited and conflicting data exist on extramedullary relapse (EMR). We aimed to describe the incidence, risk factors, outcomes and prognosis in relapsed HCT recipients. Methods: We retrospectively reviewed charts of consecutive allogeneic HCT recipients transplanted in our center with the indication of acute leukemia (7/1990-7/ 2018). We recorded: age, gender, disease, previous extramedullary involvement, phase at transplant, type of transplant, donor, conditioning, graft-versus-host-disease (GVHD), infections, treatment-related mortality and relapse mortality. In patients with extramedullary relapses, additional data on clinical manifestations, imaging, cerebrospinal fluid testing, histopathology and management were additionally documented. Incidence of isolated EMR (iEMR) and bone marrow relapse (BMR) was calculated using cumulative incidence (CI) analysis, with each and treatment-related mortality considered a competing risk.",

Furthermore, dasatinib treatment promoted significant upregulation of chemokine receptor CXCR4, on both mRNA and cell surface levels. Elevated CXCR4 expression was accompanied by increased responsiveness of ALL cells to CXCL12 stimulation, resulting in strong and sustained phosphorylation of Erk1/2 and Akt and increased adhesion capacity to BMSCs.

Single-agent treatment with panobinostat demonstrated significant inhibition of Ph-and Ph+ ALL cell growth at low nanomolar concentrations (p< 0.01). Importantly, combination of panobinostat with dasatinib synergized (CI< 0.5), effectively overcoming the protection provided by BMSCs and inducing the apoptosis of Ph-and Ph+ ALL cells, as demonstrated by phosphatidylserine externalization, mitochondrial depolarization and DNA fragmentation. Furthermore, combining panobinostat with dasatinib significantly reduced CXCR4 surface levels in Ph-and Ph+ ALL cells. Accordingly, CXCL12mediated responses, including Erk1/2 and Akt activation and adhesion to BMSCs were significantly reduced upon combined panobinostat/dasatinib treatment.

It was previously found that calcineurin signaling positively regulates CXCR4 expression in T lymphocytes. Additionally, cyclosporin A (CsA) decreased both basal and dasatinib-induced CXCR4 surface levels in ALL cells, overcoming the protection of the BMSCs which result in potentiation of the cytotoxic effect of dasatininb and panobinostat. Combining CsA with panobinostat resulted in deeper suppression of NFATc1-regulated target genes.

We aimed to compare the long-term outcomes of NMA conditioned patients with myeloablative (MA) conditioned patients. Methods: We studied 220 NMA and 218 MA conditioned adult (>15 years) consecutive patients receiving their first allo-HSCT for AML from 2000 to 2017 at Rigshospitalet. NMA conditioning consisted mainly of 2 Gy total body irradiation (TBI) and fludarabine 90 mg/m 2 (95% of cases). MA conditioning consisted mainly of cyclophosphamide 120 mg/ kg and either 12 Gy TBI (86% of cases) or busulfan 12.8 mg/ kg (5% of cases), or fludarabine 150 mg/m 2 and treosulfan 42 mg/m 2 (6% of cases). Five percent and 19% of NMA and MA conditioned patients, respectively, received anti-thymocyte globulin. Patients were followed until death or end-of-followup on October 31 st , 2018. Cumulative incidences with 95% confidence intervals (CI) of acute graft-versus-host disease (aGVHD) grade II-IV, chronic graft-versus-host disease (cGVHD), relapse and non-relapse mortality (NRM) were calculated and compared between NMA and MA conditioned patients using Gray's test with death as a competing risk (or relapse when comparing NRM).

In a developing country like India where patients are not covered under state health insurance, the additional cost of procurement of stem cells in a MUD transplant would add to the financial burden to the patients. Haploidentical transplant is a feasible option in case of non-availability of MSD, due to ease of donor availability and strong motivation from the family donor to donate the stem cells. Background: Allogeneic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) is not indicated as consolidation of first complete remission (CR1) in favorable-risk acute myeloid leukemia (AML) bearing mutations in nucleophosmin (NPM1) in the absence of FLT3 internal tandem duplication (FLT3-ITD). Nevertheless, a substantial proportion of patients eventually proceed to allo-HSCT beyond CR1 or for chemoresistant minimal residual disease (MRD) while in CR1, which might compromise transplantation outcomes. The study aimed at examining the characteristics and results of allo-HSCT in AML cases with mutated NPM1 and wild-type FLT3 (NPM1mut/FLT3wt), with special focus on molecular monitoring of MRD following transplantation. Methods: From 11/2010 until 04/2018, 16 patients (women/men, 9/7) underwent allo-HSCT for NPM1mut/ FLT3wt AML. At transplant, median age of patients was 44.5 years (range, 35-63) , and disease phase was CR1 (n=5), CR2 (n=9), or primary refractory (n=2). Among the 13 patients who were transplanted in CR and had available molecular MRD assessments, 10 had detectable mutant NPM1 transcripts by real-time quantitative PCR (RQ-RCR). Also, 4 patients fulfilled criteria of molecular relapse (increasing levels of NPM1-mutated transcripts in two successive bone marrow samples), with mutant NPM1 load of 386-4,900 transcripts/10,000 ABL transcripts). The conditioning regimen was myeloablative in the majority of cases (n=14) or reduced-intensity (n=2). The type of donor varied, namely HLA-identical sibling (n=6), matched unrelated (n=5), haploidentical relative (n=3), or double umbilical cord blood (n=2).",

Pre-transplant TIM3 levels were significantly higher in AML patients when compared to ALL [1063.7(409.5-3784.4) vs 831.4 (65.8-3254.4 ); p=0.01]. TIM3 levels were significantly lower in patients with abnormal cytogenetics when compared to normal karyotype (p=0.017). Cytogenetic abnormalities, including mainly a complex karyotype or chromosome 8 abnormalities, were more frequent in patients with low TIM3 levels (p=0.053). Pre-transplant TIM3 levels were significantly higher in patients who developed post-transplant viral hemorrhagic cystitis (p=0.034). A positive correlation was demonstrated between TIM3 levels and acute graft versus host disease (GvHD) grade (p=0.013; r=0.299). At a median follow-up of 14.6 (0.2-160.9) months, overall survival (OS) was found to be better in low-TIM3 group when compared to high-TIM3 group, without statistical significance (%35.2 vs % 20.4; p>0.05) ( Figure 1 ). Probability of OS was relatively better in both AML (42.6% vs 26.7%; p>0.05) and ALL patients (29.5% vs 19%; p>0.05) representing low pretransplant TIM3 levels in the subgroup analysis Conclusions: In this study, elevated levels of pretransplant TIM3 levels in AML patients were compatible with the previous reports which had underlined an increased TIM3 expression on AML stem cells. The possible association of TIM3 expression with cytogenetic features should be confirmed with further studies as there is no adequate data except its relationship with FLT3-ITD mutational status. TIM-3 is also expressed on exhausted T cells in patients with viral infections, including human immunodeficiency virus, hepatitis B and hepatitis C virus. It plays an essential role in the regulation of antiviral and antitumor immune responses which may be an explanation for the increased frequency of hemorrhagic cystitis in patients with higher TIM-3 levels. The adverse prognostic impact of TIM3 on GvHD and OS was confirmed without statistical significance which may be related to small sample size. As TIM3 has a wide spectrum of action in the tumor microenvironment including stimulatory and inhibitory activities, further clues are required to define the exact role of this molecule in the clinical course of allogeneic HSCT in order to develop targeted therapeutic strategies Clinical Trial Registry: N/A Disclosure: Nothing to declare P029 Homozygous HLA-C1 is associated with increased risk of relapse after HLA-matched transplantation in recipients with acute lymphoid leukemia: A Japanese national registry study Background: After hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT), the role of natural killer (NK) cells which express killer-cells immunoglobulin-like receptors (KIRs) and recognize HLA-class 1 ligands is important. KIR2DL1 recognizes not HLA-C Asp80 (C1), but HLA-C Lys80 (C2) and has polymorphism based on the 245 th amino acid of the transmembrane domain. Low frequency of C2 and high frequency of strong KIR2DL1 are characteristics observed in Japanese. By using large transplant database, we reported that homozygous HLA-C1 (C1/C1) recipients displayed lower relapse rates than did C1/C2 recipients after HLA-matched HSCT for acute myeloid leukemia (AML; HR = .79, P = .006) or chronic myeloid leukemia (CML; HR = .48, P = .025). This effect seemed to be independent of acute graft-versus-host disease (aGVHD) or cytomegalovirus reactivation occurrence (Arima N et al BBMT 2018) . Methods: Relapse rates of Japanese recipients who first underwent HLA-matched HSCT between 1996 and 2016 for the treatment of acute lymphoid leukemia (ALL) were compared between C1/C1 pairs and C1/C2 pairs, using data from Japanese Data Center for Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation and adjusting for transplant characteristics. Cord blood transplantation was excluded. Multivariable competing risk regression analyses were performed to evaluate relapses and relapse-free survival (RFS) was estimated using Kaplan-Meier method.",

This hypothesis may be explained by the fact that aGVHD was necessary for the recessive relapse in C1/C1 recipients with ALL. Furthermore, Ph-positive ALL cells sometimes mimic AML cells in terms of their frequent myeloid antigen expression and might be directly targeted by NK cells. It would be necessary to further clarify in vitro the character of NK cell-affecting in the transplant immunity against residual leukemia cells.",

This study evaluated whether sequential conditioning approach that is cytoreductive chemotherapy applied shortly prior to the main conditioning followed by HSCT can improve prognosis in such high-risk patients. Methods: We retrospectively analyzed the outcomes of 90 children (median 8, range 0-18 years old) with primary refractory (n = 11) or refractory relapsed (n = 79) acute leukemia (AML n = 43, ALL n = 47) who received HSCT in our department between 1990 and 2016. The stem cell source was related peripheral blood (PB) in 4 patients, related bone marrow in 31, unrelated bone marrow in 40, or unrelated cord blood in 15. The grafts were HLA serologically matched (n = 63) or mismatched (n = 27) with the recipient. In total, 29 patients received the sequential conditioning approach. As cytoreductive chemotherapy, fludarabine/cytarabine/idarubicin/G-CSF (FLAG-IDA) was used in 12 patients, mitoxantrone or daunorubicin/cytarabin in 10, or other regimens in 7, and 6 of them were combined with gemtuzumab ozogamicin. Without waiting for hematological recovery, the patients promptly underwent HSCT; therefore, the median interval between cytoreductive chemotherapy and main conditioning was 11 days. The main conditioning regimens were total body irradiation-based myeloablative (n = 22), busulfan-based myeloablative (n = 4), or reduced intensity (n = 3).",

In multivariate analysis, the use of sequential conditioning was identified as the most favorable factor for LFS (hazard ratio [HR] 0.37; P = 0.001), although there were no differences in the outcomes according to the types of cytoreductive chemotherapy or the main conditioning regimen. HLA-matched donor (HR 0.46; P = 0.005) and PB blasts-negative at the beginning of conditioning (HR 0.49; P = 0.02) were also independently associated with better LFS. With sequential conditioning, leukemia burden prior to the HSCT was significantly reduced; PB blasts became undetectable at the beginning of conditioning in 66% patients given the approach, while in 38% patients without the approach (P = 0.02). Notably, the outcomes in the patients without PB blasts at the beginning of conditioning who received sequential conditioning were promising; the 5-year OS and LFS reached 73% and 62% and the 5-year RI and TRM were 33% and 5%, respectively.",

However, toxicity remains the major concern to a wide application of this approach. Post transplant viral reactivations may induce severe complications and a rigorous monitoring of peripheral blood viral load for a prompt and effective therapy is required.

Methods: We have previously developed a manufacturing protocol for the expansion of Cytomegalovirus (CMV) and EBV-specific T cells by stimulation of G-CSFmobilized stem cell grafts with defined peptide pools (Gary, 2018) . This Advanced Therapeutic Medicinal Product is currently investigated in an ongoing phase I/IIa trial (EudraCT Number: 2012-004240-30) . However, the expansion of virus-specific T cells relies on a pre-existing virusspecific memory compartment in the stem cell donor. In virus-seronegative donors, no expansion can be achieved. We therefore aim to identify EBV peptide-specific T cell receptors (TCRs) that can be translated into off-the-shelf cell products for the treatment and prophylaxis of EBV infection and EBV-associated malignancies.",

The presence of alloreactive T cells in the donor graft, however, leads to a high probability of developing graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) . T-cell depletion minimises the presence of GVHD-causing alloreactive cells, but often results in an increased incidence of infections and disease relapse. Photodepletion treatment (PDT) can specifically deplete activated alloreactive T cells while conserving resting T cells. PDT-treated cells have been utilised after T-cell-depleted haploidentical transplant to help reduce infection and relapse. The efficacy and safety of such PDT-treated cells is currently under clinical investigation in a phase III trial (HATCY, NCT02999854; Kiadis Pharma).",

As invariant natural killer T (iNKT) cells are known to prevent GVHD while promoting beneficial anti-tumor effects, we investigated the role of iNKT cells for successful DLIs. Methods: We analyzed DLI samples by flow cytometry. iNKT cells were identified by staining with PBS57-loaded CD1d tetramers.

We observed that tumor cell lysis correlated with the expression of the MHC-I-like molecule CD1d. Consequently, adding a CD1d antibody to the coculture abrogated the DLI-iNKTmediated kill of tumor cells.

We also examined NKT cell markers to see if NKT cells were activated by IL-15, a cytokine used in the induction of CTLs, and the portion of NKT cells was about 2%. The CTLs showed a decrease in na\u00efve cell (CD62L+CD45RA +) and an increase in effector memory (CD62L+CD45RA-) and central memory (CD62L-CD45RA-) compared with non-stimulated PBMCs. Subsequently, the IFN-\u03b3 ELISPOT (Enzyme-linked immunospot) assay was performed to confirm the response of the induced WT1-specific CTLs to the WT1 antigen. When WT1-specific CTLs encounters a target that does not have a WT1 antigen, it did not produce IFN-\u03b3, but when it encounters a target cells loaded WT1 antigen, it responded to secrete IFN-\u03b3. Killing assays were also performed to determine the immunogenicity of induced CTLs. The induced WT1 CTLs was found to be killing more than 90% when the E:T ratio was 10:1 when the autologous PBMC met the target with WT1 pepmix. In addition, we found that WT1 CTLs has killing activity when it encounters leukemia cell lines that express WT1 and matched HLA-A*0201.",

Moreover, CTLs induced activated B cells had ability to recognize and kill the target cells expressing WT1 correctly. Our results demonstrate that these in vitro expanded WT1-specific CTLs using activated B cells can be a promising candidate for adoptive immunotherapy against cancer.",

Recently, the introduction of post-transplant Cyclophosphamide (ptCy) allowed to significantly reduce GVHD, but disease relapse remains an important issue. Donor-lymphocyte infusion (DLI) is an established adoptive cell therapy for disease relapse after alloHSCT, but, in order to be efficient and safe, patients have to be off immunosuppression treatments and GVDH-free. Here we report our data about efficacy and safety of DLI infusion as treatment for disease relapse in patients who received peripheral blood stem cell transplantation (alloPBSCT) from HLA-matched unrelated/related plus ptCy as GVDH prophylaxis in our clinical trial (NCT 02300571). Methods: We collected data from 13 patients, treated with ptCy (50 mg/kg/die, days +3+4), mofetil mycophenolate (MMF) and tacrolimus (T) as GVHD prophylaxis after allo-PBSCT, who received DLI infusions. They were treated between January 2013 and October 2018. We report data about overall response rate (ORR), disease control rate (DCR), and DLI-related mortality and morbidity. Diagnosis were as follow: 5 had multiple myeloma, 3 had acute myeloid leukemia, 3 had acute lymphoblastic leukemia and 2 had lymphomas.

In some studies, a correlation has been suggested between treated Mononuclear cells (MNC) or lymphocytes and response to ECP. The objective of the study was to analyze the relationship between the infused cellularity and response in chronic GvHD. Methods: 48 patients from 7 different centers with a total of 930 ECP procedures were retrospectively analyzed. ECP procedures were performed from January-2011 to June-2017. All ECP procedures were performed with the off-line system. The response was defined as Responder (Complete and Partial Response) and Non-responder. Infused cell numbers for lymphocytes, monocytes and mononuclear cells (Lym+Mon, MNC) were calculated. For analytic purposes, the median number of cells infused per procedure until response (or until the median number of procedures until response for non-responding patients) and the cumulative number of cells infused until response (or until the median in non-responders) were calculated for all the subgroups. Same procedures were performed with the number cells infused until day 30 of ECP. Finally, the response and survival impact of infusing a number of cells over or below the median and in different tertiles (T1, T2 and T3) was assessed until the median number of procedures needed to achieve a response.",

For the first time we used the MSC infusions as rescue therapy in a pediatric patient with FLNA gene mutation and life-threatening respiratory syndrome. Methods: A child with a new pathogenic variant of the FLNA gene c.7391_7403del; (p.Val2464AlafsTer5) at the age of 18 months, due to the serious and irreversible chronic respiratory failure and dismal prognosis, was treated with 4 intravenous infusions of allogeneic bone marrow (BM)-MSCs at the dose of 1\u00d710 6 MSCs/kg body weight. BM-MSCs were produced at \"Cell Factory\", Fondazione IRCCS Policlinico S. Matteo, Pavia,isolated and expanded ex vivo from healthy donor BM, following a previously reported protocol.

We propose a novel strategy to enhance the antitumor effect of allogeneic transplant through the infusion of NK cells stimulated with IL-15 exvivo in adult high-risk acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients undergoing unmanipulated Haplo-HSCT. The objective of this study was to provide efficiency and productivity data obtained in the manufactured cellular products infused. Methods: Selection criteria included patients with highrisk AML undergoing unmanipulated Haplo-HSCT. Lymphoapheresis of the haploidentical donor was performed using Spectra Optia (Terumo\u00ae BCT) on days +6 and +13 after transplant. From the obtained product a double immunomagnetic cellular selection with Clinimacs system (Miltenyi Biotec\u00ae) was performed in two steps: CD3+ depletion followed by positive CD56+ selection.

Further large-scale clinical studies with long-term follow up is needed in the future to determine the role of MSCs in cGVHD. Background: The majority of pregnant Polish women (84%) have heard of cord blood banking. However, most doctors do not have sufficient knowledge about the possibility of using cord blood in order to respond to their potential concerns. Only 16.5% of healthcare professionals were aware that cord blood could be used to treat haematological diseases. In order to make doctors aware of this issue and provide patients with the information they expect, we would like to present data on the use of cord blood stored in our blood bank for haematological and nonhaematological therapies. Methods: The table presented below has been created using data from the general database of the Polish Stem Cell Bank, Warsaw, Poland. No data regarding umbilical cord blood data have been excluded. All patients were planned to be assessed on day 1, day 28, on discharge, 100 days after transplantation and 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 years after transplantation, but in some cases, patients were lost from follow-up due to a persistent lack of reports from transplantation centres.",

On the other hand, one study indicated that the expectations placed in cord blood banking may be unreasonable. As a private cord blood bank, we support recommendations which underline the importance of patient education. In Poland, cord blood has been approved as standard therapy in approx. 80 diseases; most of them are rare, but Polish law allows the use of cord blood for the siblings, parents and grandparents of a donor. Additionally, 168 active and planned clinical trials throughout the world evaluate the therapeutic efficacy of cord blood in such areas as haematology, neurology, cardiology, diabetology, congenital paediatric disorders, ophthalmology, dermatology, gastroenterology, HIV infection, and the quality of life during aging. Therefore, further indications may be expected in the future. Background: Cytokine release syndrome (CRS) has been identified as a clinically significant, on target, off tumour side effect of the chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-Cell therapies. It is clinically increased in interkeukin 6 and elevations in other cytokines, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), C-reactive protein (CRP), and ferritin. These side effects can include fever, fatigue, headache, encephalopathy, hypertension, tachycardia, coagulopathy, nausea, capillary leak and multi organ dysfunction. CRS symptoms can appear as early as one day after infusion and can resolve quickly or last for weeks. It\u00b4s severity to be related to the disease burden prior to CAR T-Cell therapy.",

Elderly people are mainly affected, limiting the feasibility of intensive myeloablative chemotherapy regimens. The introduction of reduced-intensity conditioning (RIC) made alloSCT feasible and effective for old patients. Nevertheless, the incidence of PMF and SMF is not negligible in young patients, theoretically able to tolerate also high-intensity therapy.

A TP53 mutation could be detected in pt#2 and pt#3. All three patients had symptomatic disease with rapidly increasing hyperleukocytosis and massive splenomegaly. Two of them were treatment-naive and one relapsed after chemoimmunotherapy. All patients were put on ibrutinib 420mg. Despite initial response to treatment, two patients developed progressive disease after 4 (pt#1) and 9 months (pt#2) on ibrutinib, whereas pt#3 remained in partial remission with persisting leukocytosis, precluding consolidating alloSCT as originally intended. In pt#1, ibrutinib was replaced by venetoclax, but without response. In order to control rapid lymphoproliferation, rituximab was added to venetoclax. Grade 4 infusion reaction / tumor lysis syndrome (TLS) (fever, tachycardia and hypotonia requiring intravenous vasopressors) followed each rituximab administration despite fractionating rituximab to small doses. However, continuation of rituximab (100mg/d over 10d) led to complete and durable clearance of hyperleukocytosis (from 250/nl to MRD negativity) despite venetoclax cessation. A similar pattern was observed in pt#2, who received rituximab while showing rapidly increasing leukocytosis upon ibrutinib. Again, complete clearance of B-PLL cells in the peripheral blood (from 148/nl to MRD negativity) occurred after initial grade 4 TLS despite only modest CD20 expression on tumor cells in this patient. Also, pt#3 achieved profound B-PLL cell depletion (from 38/nl to a MRD rate of 1.1%) upon addition of rituximab to ibrutinib (without TLS in this case). Subsequently, all three patients were able to undergo alloSCT after conditioning with fludarabine and total body irradiation with 8 Gy. Pt#1 received stem cells from a HLA-ident sibling donor, whereas Pt#2 and Pt#3 had unrelated donors (HLA-ident and HLA-matched respectively). With follow-up times of 17 and 11 months post-transplant, pt#1 and pt#2 are currently in ongoing MRD-negative remission. Pt#1 developed an acute graft-versus-host disease (GvHD) of the liver (grade 3), nevertheless the clinical course was well controlled by immunosuppression. In pt#2 a chronic GvHD of the skin occurred. Pt#3, who achieved MRD negativity after alloSCT, developed acute and chronic steroidrefractory GvHD of the skin and gastrointestinal tract. Nine months post-transplant, GvHD deteriorated and after further complications the patient died of pneumonia 11 months post-transplant.",

Nevertheless, BCRi offers a possibility of disease control in these patients with poor prognosis. Further studies are needed to confirm these data. Background: Prior to the introduction of tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI), median survival of chronic phase chronic myeloid leukemia (CP-CML) patients was approximately 60 months and the standard treatment with interferon-alpha resulted in complete cytogenetic responses in about 30% of the patients. Autologous stem cell transplantation (auto-SCT) was first attempted for patients in transformation in order to restore a second CP and was introduced secondarily in CP to try to prolong the response. The main rational for autografting in CP resides on the reduction of the tumor burden and the number of leukemic cells at risk of developing blastic transformation. Nevertheless, auto-SCT alone was not able to maintain a long-term remission. Nowadays, TKIs represent the state-of-the-art therapy for CML and the concept of Auto-SCT has only little interest while long-term follow-up and outcome in this setting are currently unknown. The aim of our study is to evaluate at a first time the longterm outcome of CML patients who received auto-SCT in chronic phase, and to evaluate at a second time in a subgroup analysis, the outcome of those who received TKI after having been auto-transplanted, mainly for disease progression/loss of response and/or to enhance disease response.",

However, recurrent disease and non-relapse mortality (NRM) are frequent causes of treatment failure. The optimal conditioning regimen for SCT in this disease has not been defined. Methods: We retrospectively analyzed transplantation outcomes of all adult patients given SCT for myelofibrosis between 2003 and 2018 at a single large academic medical center. Patients (n=59) were treated with several conditioning regimens that were grouped according to conditioning intensity. Myeloablative conditioning (MAC) included busulfan 12.8 mg/kg and cyclophosphamide 120 mg/kg (BuCy, n=10), fludarabine and busulfan 12.8 mg/kg (Flu/ Bu4, n=9) and fludarabine and treosulfan 30-36 g/m 2 (Flu/ Treo, n=6). Reduced-intensity conditioning included fludarabine and busulfan 6.4-8.0 mg/kg (Flu/Bu2, n=22). More recently we adopted the TBF regimen including fludarabine, busulfan 6.4-9.6 mg/kg and thiotepa 5-10 mg/ m2 (n=12). All patients were also given anti-thymocyte globulin during conditioning, irrespective of donor source.",

The majority of patients had documented splenomegaly (81%) and were not previously exposed to ruxolitinib (71%). Donor type was an HLA-matched sibling (41%), 10/10 (51%) or 9/10 (8%) matched unrelated donor. The DIPPS+ score distribution was intermediate-1 (16%), intermediate-2 (45%), or high (n=39%). The median followup was 3.2 years Since the success of tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), transplant-related mortality is considered too high to justify allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (alloHSCT) as first-line treatment for chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) patients in chronic phase (CP). AlloHSCT is currently considered for patients failing to at least 2 TKIs or with disease in advanced phase. Nevertheless, the optimal timing for transplant referral is still not well defined. Methods: We performed a retrospective analysis on 23 consecutive patients with CML in CP receiving first transplants from an HLA-identical sibling donor with partially T-cell depleted grafts from 1998 to 2016 at our center. Partial T-cell depletion (pTD) consisted of in vitro alemtuzumab incubation of a part of the graft for infusion at day 0 while the rest, containing 100x10 6 CD3+ cells/kg was given as a T-cell add-back at day 1. Donor lymphocyte infusions (DLIs) were provided, in the absence of GvHD, in case of disease relapse or mixed chimerism. Molecular monitoring was performed by 3-month BCR-ABL1 RT-qPCR testing in peripheral blood during at least a 5-year period after HSCT. Thereafter, 3-month testing schedule was maintained where possible, or followed by a 6-month one. Kaplan-Meier method was employed to determine the probability of overall survival (OS) and leukemia free survival (LFS) since alloHSCT.",

Novel molecular prognostic systems are likely to identify those best placed to benefit in future but this series currently supports allo-HSCT survival and cure. (range, 105-4624) . Dynamic international prognostic scoring system (DIPSS) score at the time of HCT was intermediate-2 or high risk in 20 patients (95%), intermedate-1 in 1 patient. Molecular evaluation was available in 14 out of 21: JAK2 V617F mutation was detectable in 8 patients, MPL-W515K in 1 patient, CARL in 1 patient. 4 patients were \"triple negative\" for driver mutations. Cytogenetics information was available for 6 out of 21; among which 3 patients had complex karyotype, 1 trisomy 8 and 1 trisomy 9. 3 patients underwent splenectomy before HCT. Ruxolitinib was administered in 4 patients before HCT. 10 (48%) patients received stem cells from an HLA identical sibling, 9 (42%) from a matched unrelated donor and 2 (10%) from an haploidentical sibling.

FB4 has potent antileukemic activity and is associated with low transplantrelated mortality and acute GvHD. However, early after transplantation (days 30-90), a proportion of patients may not convert to a full donor haemopoietic chimerism, particularly if anti-T lymphocyte globulin (ATG) is used as GvHD prophylaxis (Rambaldi A, et al.: The Lancet Oncology 2015) Methods: We retrospective analyzed 104 patients who underwent an allogeneic stem cell transplantation after FB4 conditioning regimen at our hospital, from November 2007 to August 2018. The median age was 51 years (range 22-67) and diagnoses were AML 76%, MDS 18% CML 5% MFI 1%). The disease status at transplantation was: CR1 in 59%, CR2 in 5% and active disease in 36% of patients. The stem cell source was represented by PBSC in more than 95% of cases and anti-T lymphocyte globulin (ATG) was part of the conditioning regimen in more than 95% of cases at a dose of 5 mg/Kg. The donor was a HLA identical sibling (26%), a matched unrelated (65%) or mismatched (one allele or one antigen mismatched) unrelated, 9%. Hematopoietic chimerism was molecularly evaluated by Variable Number of Tandem Repeats (VNTR) on bone marrow (BM) mononuclear cells or peripheral blood (PB) T lymphocytes, purified by immunomagnetic positive selection (Miltenyi, Biotec). The analysis was performed at day 30, 60, 90, 180 and 360 after transplantation Results: After 30, 60 and 90 days from transplantation, the proportion of patients with a full BM chimerism was 94%, 87% and 83%, respectively. At the same time points, the PB T cell chimerism was 47%, 65% and 69%. Before day 100, 10 patients required the infusion of DLI to treat a pending or overt hematologic relapse and 12 patients to convert the lymphoid chimerism from mixed (median 44%, range 0-76), to complete (successfully in 7 cases). After day 100, 13 additional patients required DLI to treat disease relapse or progression and 8 patients to improve the chimeric status or the immune reconstitution. At 5 years, the Overall Survival is 64%, with a relapse and non-relapse mortality of 21 % and 11%, respectively ( Figure 1 ). By uni and multivariable analysis, AML diagnosis and a mixed BM chimerism before day 100 were associated with Relapse and Overall Survival while age > 50 was the only factor significantly associated with NRM. A mixed PB T-lymphoid chimerism before day 100 does not adversely impact on non-relapse mortality, cumulative incidence of relapse, leukemia-free and overall survival.",

We developed a two-compartment model with weight and eGFR as covariates influencing treosulfan PK. Recently we showed a relationship between treosulfan exposure and early toxicity. Patients with an exposure >1650 mg*hr/L have an increased risk of developing grade 2 or higher mucositis and skin toxicity. Another study in 87 pediatric patients with thalassemia major reported an association between treosulfan clearance (< 7.97 L/h/m 2 ) and poor overall survival. Our model, together with the limited sampling strategy, can be used to adjust the dose, prior to or during treosulfan administration. Ongoing studies conducted in different disease settings will determine if treosulfan exposure can influence patient outcome. Subsequently, the optimal target exposure can then be established. Background: Autologous stem cell transplant (ASCT) is an effective treatment method for non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL). Until recently, carmustine, etoposide, cytarabine and melphalan (BEAM) was the most commonly used conditioning regimen. Despite acceptable efficacy with BEAM, carmustine is associated with major pulmonary toxicity.

Defibrotide is approved for treating severe hepatic VOD/SOS post-HSCT in patients aged >1 month in the EU, and for hepatic VOD/SOS with renal or pulmonary dysfunction post-HSCT in the US. This analysis provides an overview of the safety results from 3 studies of patients with VOD/SOS, with or without MOD, who received defibrotide 25 mg/kg/day. Methods: Safety data were pooled from patients with VOD/SOS post-HSCT treated with defibrotide in a phase 3 trial (n=102) and a phase 2, randomized dose-finding trial (n=74 receiving 25 mg/kg/day). Safety data for historical controls (HC) from the phase 3 study (n=32) also are provided. Reported separately, due to differences in patient population and data monitoring protocol, are AEs from the expanded-access program (T-IND) in patients with VOD/ SOS with and without MOD (n=1000 post-HSCT). VOD/ SOS was diagnosed by Baltimore criteria/biopsy for the phase 2/3 studies; diagnosis by Baltimore or modified Seattle criteria was permitted in the T-IND.",

Several studies, prospective or retrospective, have reported outcomes of defibrotide, when used as prophylaxis or treatment, in a mixed population of adult and pediatric patients.

VOD/SOS with multi-organ dysfunction (MOD) may be associated with >80% mortality with supportive care alone. Diagnosis of VOD/SOS was traditionally based on Baltimore or modified Seattle criteria; however, the EBMT recently published separate diagnostic criteria for adults and children. Defibrotide is approved for treating severe hepatic VOD/SOS post-HSCT in patients aged >1 month in the EU, and for hepatic VOD/SOS with renal or pulmonary dysfunction post-HSCT in the USA. The goal of the DEFIFRANCE study, requested by the French health authorities, is to collect real-world data on safety and efficacy in a broader patient population in France, including all indications.

The aim of this study is to analyse the incidence of ARF, its risk factors and its potential impact on TRM after allo-SCT. Methods: 422 patients were included (244 males [58%]; median age 43 years, range 16-67) treated with Allo-SCT consecutively between January 2001 and April 2012 in a single institution. Patient characteristics are detailed in table 1. Median follow-up was 1.8 years (range, 1.0-2.7). Renal function was evaluated using creatinine and data was collected pre-transplant (baseline) and at the point when ARF was developed after allo-SCT. ARF was evaluated using AKIN criteria, being AKIN-1 an increase 1.5-to 1.9-fold from baseline, AKIN-2 an increase 2.0-to 2.0-fold and AKIN-3 an increase \u22653-fold.

ARF AKIN-3 was associated with more intensive strategies received during conditioning, meanwhile AKIN-1/2 were related to development of GvHD. There is an association of ARF (AKIN-1, 2 or 3) with development of chronic renal disease. Background: The introduction of cellular therapies such as CAR-T and modalities of GvHD-prophylaxis with posttransplant/cyclophosphamide (PtCy) that increase the number of admission days have boosted the pressure of available beds in the BM-units. In this sense, our centre started an at-home allogeneic stem cell transplantation (allo-SCT) program to follow aplasia from the D+1 until independent ambulatory patient. To evaluate the feasibility and safety of alloSCT, we compared two groups: alloHSCT/athome (AH-Group) vs. alloHSCT/in-patient (IP-Group). Methods: We included 78 patients receiving alloSCT (January 2014-November 2018) in a single centre: 39 patients, AH-Group and 39, IP-Group. All patients received conditioning at the hospital. GvHD-prophylaxis consisted in tacrolimus (TK) plus mycophenolate (MPM) or methotrexate, or PtCy (D+3, D+4) plus TK (D+5). All patients received prophylaxis with levofloxacin, fluconazole and acyclovir. Besides that, AH-Group patients received prophylaxis with ceftriaxone 1g/24h IV or ertapenem 1g/ 24h IV, and Aspergillus-prophylaxis with inhaled liposomal amphotericin-B or posaconazole during neutropenia. Patients of AH-Group since D+1 or D+6 (in PtCyprophylaxis) received a nurse visit at-home once daily. The visits by the physician were performed at the hospital and only during complication events. First-line therapy of neutropenic fever was meropenem 1 g/8h in both groups, using a portable infusion pump in AH-Group. In this group, the absence of focal infection or signs of severe sepsis allowed returning home after the initiation of antibiotics. The platelets support was performed at-home and the red blood support at hospital.",

Background: Renal complications in sickle cell disease (SCD) include episodes of acute kidney injury (AKI), progressive chronic kidney disease (CKD) and hyperfiltration, defined by abnormally high glomerular filtration rates (GFRs). Hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) from an HLA identical sibling donor is a well-established curative treatment for SCD, but traditional myeloablative conditioning (MAC) regimens pose risks of kidney injury due to intensive use of chemotherapeutic agents, infectious risks, and use of calcineurin inhibitors (CNIs). AKI and subsequent fluid overload (FO) are common in pediatric HSCT with reported AKI incidence of 21%-50% (Kyung-Nam Koh et. Al., 2017). We report renal outcomes in pediatric patients with SCD who received HSCT following a non-myeloablative conditioning (NMA) regimen without CNI exposure. Methods: Retrospective chart review describing renal outcomes in pediatric patients (18 years of age or younger) with SCD (HbSS) who underwent NMA HSCT in Alberta, Canada from July 2013 to February 2018. The NMA regimen is illustrated in Figure 1 . Reported renal outcomes: 1) measured GFR (DTPA) pre-HSCT, 2) AKI (KDIGO definition) post-HSCT by reviewing all serum creatinine levels from pre-HSCT to one month post-HSCT, 3) %FO calculated: (max post HSCT weight -baseline weight)/ baseline weight x 100 for the two first weeks post-HSCT, and 4) estimated GFR (eGFR) using the pediatric Schwartz formula at last follow-up post-HSCT, CKD defined as eGFR < 60 mL/min/1.73 m 2 , mildly reduced GFR: 60-90mL/min/1.73 m 2 , and hyperfiltration: GFR \u2265 150 mL/ min/1.73 m 2 .",

Separation of BAL and prewash microbiota using Bray-Curtiss dissimilarity plots showed that BAL samples were distinguished by sequences assigned to Staphylococcus, Acidovorax, and Bradyrhizobium species, while prewash samples were distinguished mostly by Pseudomonas and Elizabethkingia species, consistent with environmental sources (Figure) . Within BAL samples, Staphylococcus species were the main drivers of separation between IPS cases and the controls (p=0.002, PERMANOVA, Figure) . Consistent with this, a linear discriminant analysis to identify taxa best distinguishing cases and controls identified Staphylococcus, especially S. epidermidis, in IPS cases with Lactobacillus and Streptococcus species in controls. We then compared relative abundances of S. epidermidis between all study groups. IPS case samples were significantly enriched in S. epidermidis compared to control (p< 0.001, two-sided Wilcoxon rank sum test) and prewash samples (p< 0.001). Viruses were classified by category as human pathogens, non-human pathogens, and bacteriophages.

Methods: We retrospectively analyzed 132 Haplo-SCT with PT-Cy consecutively performed between 2011 and 2017 in our centre. PGF was defined as either occurring after initial engraftment: persistent neutropenia (ANC < 500/uL) with the need of at least 3 doses of G-CSF and/or thrombocytopenia (platelets < 20.000/uL) with platelet transfusion dependence, with complete donor chimerism and without concurrent severe GVHD or disease relapse.",

Thirty one patients (27,5%) were diagnosed with PGF. Main characteristics of these patients are summarized in Table 1 . Twenty six patients (84%) presented with neutropenia and were treated with G-CSF, while 5 patients (16%) only developed severe thrombocytopenia without neutropenia, and were treated only with platelet transfusion. Twenty four patients (77,5%) had at least 1 CMV reactivation, 15 patients (48%) had 2 or more CMV reactivations and 21 patients (67%) received valganciclovir for CMV reactivation treatment. Although most patients achieved adequate peripheral blood counts (PBC) with initial salvage therapy, 6 patients (19%) had persistent cytopenias in spite of G-CSF, platelet transfusion, CMV reactivation resolution and myelotoxic drugs withdrawal. Four of them were treated with a boost of CD34+ selected peripheral blood donor cells at a median of 170 days after . Median CD34+ cells infused was 3,42 x10 6 /kg. These 4 patients achieved adequate PBC after salvage therapy and two developed GVHD. The other 2 patients were treated with increasing doses of thrombopoietin (TPO) receptor agonist (TRA) eltrombopag. One patient started treatment 160 days after HSCT with 25mg daily and increased dose to 125mg daily, with complete recovery of PBC 6 months after initiating TRA. The second patient started treatment 110 days after HSCT with 25mg daily and increased dose to 100mg daily, with complete recovery of PBC 2 months after initiating TRA. Twenty one patients (67%) with PGF diagnosis had long term survival. Conclusions: Poor graft function is a frequent complication after Haplo-SCT with Cy-post. CMV reactivation and myelotoxic drugs could be the most relevant factors associated with development of this entity. Although most patients recover PBC without specific therapies beyond G-CSF and platelets transfusion, there is a small group of patients with persistent cytopenias. Boost of CD34+ selected cells is effective in reverting this condition, with GVHD as main complication of this procedure. Use of TRA seems to be an interesting option for these patients, although more experience is needed to draw definitive conclusions.",

This study was conducted to determine if an online, simulation-based continuing medical education (CME) intervention could improve performance of hematologists/oncologists (hem/ onc) and advanced practice providers (nurse practitioners and physician assistants, APPs) in the diagnosis and treatment of patients with VOD. ( Methods: A CME certified virtual patient simulation (VPS) was made available via a website dedicated to continuous professional development. The VPS consisted of 2 cases presented in a platform that allows clinicians to assess the patients and make diagnostic and therapeutic decisions supported by an extensive database of diagnostic and treatment possibilities, matching the scope and depth of actual practice. Clinical decisions were analyzed using a sophisticated decision engine, and tailored clinical guidance (CG) employing up-to-date evidence-based and faculty recommendations was provided after each decision. One case was about VOD and the other case was about acute myeloid leukemia (AML).

Patients (age: 22-58 years) with high-risk or refractory/relapsed diseases were transplanted with mobilized PBSC from related (n=2) and unrelated donors (n=8) after standard conditioning. GvHD prophylaxis was cyclosporine and methotrexate. Plasma samples were frozen and thawed for EV enrichment using a novel acoustofluidic-based technology (acoustic trapping). Acoustic trapping uses ultrasound as a local \u03bb/2 acoustic standing wave produced by a piezoelectric transducer over a capillary. First, 12 \u03bcm polystyrene beads are captured which serve as seeding particles. After washing, target particles (EVs) are then captured (\"trapped\") in the acoustic field. A semi-automatic trapping device (AcouTrap) was used to isolate EVs from diluted plasma (1:2 in PBS). The number of EVs and size distribution were analyzed by nanoparticle tracking analysis. miRNA analysis was performed by qPCR.EVs were enriched in duplicate from 50\u03bcl and 300\u03bcl of diluted plasma for nanoparticle tracking analysis and qPCR analysis, respectively.",

The maximum change in EV numbers in individual patients compared to pretransplantation values ranged from 2-fold to 7-fold. Most patients showed slight increases in EV size after transplantation. Eight of the patients showed signs of infection and received i.v. antibiotics. Increased levels of EVs (> 2-fold) were recorded in three patients during these episodes. Furthermore, increased EV numbers were observed in a patient who required i.v. antiviral therapy for CMV reactivation. Acute grade I GvHD was observed in five patients of which two had increased EV numbers (> 2-fold). One patient developed grade IV GvHD which was accompanied by a 4-fold increase in EV numbers. Interestingly, progressively increasing EV numbers preceded the detection of early relapse in a pre-B ALL patient by three weeks. RNA isolation from trapped EVs yielded sufficient material for miRNA profiling. Here, first miRNA profiling data demonstrated that miRNAs were detected in EV samples (miR-103a, -23a, -30c, -142 and -451a) , and that acoustically enriched EVs were not affected by hemolysis in contrast to the corresponding whole plasma samples (dCq of miR-23a and miR-451a).",

Risk factors for OM and its implications short and long-term outcomes were assessed. Methods: OM was prospectively evaluated on a weekly basis in patients undergoing allogeneic HSCT. The grade of OM was determined based on the National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) scale (v. 4.0). Severe OM was defined as grade II to IV. Conditioning regimens were evaluated individually and according to intensity; myeloablative (MAC), reduced intensity (RIC) or reduced toxicity (RTC). The latter category included only patients receiving Fludarabine and Treosulfan at dose of 30-42 g/m2 (Flu/Treo). Risk factors for the development of severe OM were initially identified by a univariate analysis and then analyzed in a multivariate logistic regression model. Association of OM with peritransplant infectious complications, IV morphine consumption, hospitalization length, neutrophil engraftment, acute and chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), non-relapse mortality (NRM) and overall survival were assessed in a univariate analysis.

In order to provide an estimate of the prevalence of FNH after HSCT, we analysed all the T2*-MRI scans performed during the last 5 years in our Centre and recorded the number of patients with FNH (group A). In addition, data about patients incidentally diagnosed with FNH at abdominal imaging performed for different clinical indications have been collected (group B).",

Severe SOS/VOD rapidly evolves in Multiple Organ Dysfunction Syndrome (MODS), associated with a mortality rate exceding 80%. Precocity of defibrotide (DF) treatment is the leading factor for efficacy. Prophylactic use of DF is recommended in children, but its value has not been validated in the adult population, although factors for individual risk assessment for VOD are debated. We here present a real-world experience of DF prophylaxis in adult patients at very high risk of SOS/VOD receiving allogeneic HSCT. Methods: From 2016 to 2018 we treated with prophylactic Defibrotide and Ursodeoxycholic Acid (UDCA) 11 patients, median age 30 years (range 21-59). Nine patients received allogeneic HSCT for acute lymphoblastic leukemia (8 B-ALL and 1 T-ALL), one patient for Severe Aplastic Anemia, one patient for Primary Myelofibrosis. They were all at high risk for SOS/VOD because of previous hepatotoxicity (3 patients), previous HSCT (6 patients), double alkylating agent (5 patients) or previous treatment with Inotuzomab Ozogamicin (IO; 7 patients). Of the 7 patients treated with IO, 6 received 2 cycles of IO, and 1 received 1 cycle, with the last IO dose administered a median 41.5 days before HSCT (range 34-61 d). Defibrotide was administered in 4 daily doses for a total dose of 25 mg/ kg per day and UDCA at the dose of 300 mg twice per day, starting from day -6 prior transplant. All patients received Treosulfan-Fludarabine based conditioning. In 5 patients Thiotepa was added to the conditioning and in 2 patients a low dose 4Gy TBI. GvHD prophylaxis included posttransplant cyclophosphamide, rapamycin and mycophenolate in all patients, except one patient with Aplastic Anemia receiving ATG, rapamycin and mycophenolate.

In our at home model for multiple myeloma patients, we added primary prophylaxis with ceftriaxone, decreasing the incidence of fever during aplasia phase from 85% to 57.6%. The aim of this study was to analyze the addition of two strategies to reduce the non-infectious NF: withdrawal of G-CSF and the addition of primary prophylaxis for engraftment syndrome with corticosteroids after ASCT. Methods: Between January 2002 and August 2018 111 myeloma patients were managed at-home since day +1 of ASCT. All were conditioned with Mel200. All patients received prophylaxis with quinolone, fluconazole, aerolized pentamidine, low-dose acyclovir (HVS+), and ceftriaxone (since day +4). The patients were classified into 3 groups: group A (n=33; G-CSF since day +7 without corticosteroid), group B (n=32; no G-CSF and no corticosteroid), group C (n=46; no G-CSF with prednisone 0.5 mg/kg/day since day +7 until granulocyte recovery). First-line therapy at home of NF was piperacillin-tazobactam 4.5 g/6h i.v. using a portable intermittent infusion pump. Fever was an indication of immediate medical consultation and those patients presenting signs of focal infection or severe sepsis were admitted. Other indications for readmission were: willingness of the patient or caregiver, uncontrolled nausea, vomiting or diarrhoea, and mucositis requiring total parenteral nutrition or i.v. morphics.",

The duration of neutropenia was longer in those groups that did not receive G-CSF (A: 8 days, B: 11 days, C: 10 days; P< 0.01). Comparing group A with group C, we observed that the incidence of NF and the readmissions rates were lower in group C (NF: 57.6% vs. 23.9%; P=0.002; relative risk reduction: 0.41, and number needed to treat 2.97; readmissions: 12.1% vs. 2.2%; P=0.07, respectively).

It is therefore considered best practice to try to offer HSCT recipients the same level of protection against all vaccine preventable diseases as the general population. Few data in the literature are available concerning vaccine-related problems in HSCT recipients. We performed a farmacovigilance evaluation in a cohort of allotransplanted patients followed in our clinic during a 1 year period. Methods: From October 2017 to November 2018 we administered a list of recommended vaccines to 49 HSCT recipients attending our routine out patient clinic who fulfilled the following criteria: CD4 T cells>200/\u03bcl, CD19 B cells>20/\u03bcl, anti-CD20 antibody infusion>6 months, IVIG therapy>2 months, no active and severe Graft-versus-Host-Disease (GvHD), no chemotherapy or biological therapeutic agents on going. Vaccines suggested were Influenza, Pneumococcal conjugate (PCV13), Polio (inactivated polio vaccine), Diphteria, Tetanus, Acellular pertussis, Hepatitis B, Hepatitis A, Haemophilus influenzae type B, Meningococcal quadrivalent (MCV4), Human papillomavirus, Meningococcal B, Measles-Mumps-Rubella (MMR), Varicella. Live vaccines (MMR and Varicella) were not recommended before 2 years after HSCT and in patients with chronic GvHD. All the patients were asked to take the list to the local health facilities in order to have the vaccines injected and a vaccination table arranged with the doses already received and those to receive. We checked the vaccination tables at each visit and monitored potential side effects and GvHD status at 3, 6, and 12 months after the first vaccine injection.",

Our data shows that in selected AML patients over the age of 60 years with good performance status and low comorbidity index, a favourable outcome can be achieved with good QoL maintained throughout the post transplant period. Background: Advances in alloSCT technology, supportive care, and use of reduced intensity conditioning regimens for older patients have led to significant improvements in longterm survival after transplant. The survivors have an elevated probability of late morbidity and mortality, including abnormalities in phosphocalcic metabolism and bone disease. Rapid and progressive bone loss occurs within the first 6-12 months after transplant, and this is followed by a slow process of recovery, with bone loss persisting for 48 to 120 months. Bone fractures can worsen the quality of life of alloSCT survivors, but the real burden of the disease is unknown.

Optimizing ATG dose due to recipient absolute T-memory cell subsets count before ATG administering may prevent graft failure and improve posttransplant results. Background: Upper gastrointestinal graft-versus-host disease (GI GVHD) has been an increasingly recognised entity following allogeneic stem cell transplantation (SCT). Budesonide, widely used in inflammatory bowel conditions, has also been found beneficial in GI GVHD. The major benefit of Budesonide is attributable to its poor absorption and extensive first-pass metabolism via cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4, which translates to less systemic steroid-related effects. However, transplant patients are often exposed to multiple drugs, among which some agents act as CYP3A4 inhibitors and therefore can increase Budesonide bioavailability and might lead to systemic toxicity. Azole antifungal drugs are probably the most common concomitantly used CYP3A4 inhibitors in transplant recipients. Methods: We reviewed allogeneic SCT records for patients treated with oral Budesonide for GI GVHD at our transplant centre between 2015 and 2018 retrospectively. The aim of the work was to assess the development of adrenal suppression with or without clinical features of iatrogenic Cushing`s syndrome. The standard dose of Budesonide was 3 mg three times a day. Patients receiving Prednisolone or other glucocorticosteroids and those with no available serum cortisol level measurements were excluded.",

To our knowledge the number of cases reported in literature about systemic effects of oral Budesonide in transplant recipients is less than 10.

Although Mexico is considered an upper-middle income country, more than 50% of the population lives in poverty without health care coverage and patients within this social stratum are referred to our Institution. The first hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) in Mexico was performed at our Institution in 1980. From this year until 1997, HSCT were sporadically performed (n=33), showing a poor overall survival (OS) and high non-relapse mortality (NRM). These outcomes resulted from an unstructured HSCT Program, limitedresources, patient low socioeconomic status, and paucity of population-adapted procedures. In 1998, according to these results, a decision to establish a HSCT Program was made. Therefore, in order to set up a successful HSCT Program, implementation of financial and medical strategies were necessary. The objectives of this study were to describe the barriers and implemented strategies for the establishment of a HSCT Program in Mexico along with the outcomes of patients undergoing this procedure throughout the reorganization of the Program.",

In addition, in experiments with sera from patients not developing ES, ICAM-1 expression on cells exposed to sera from day +10 was reduced with respect to the observed with sera from day +5, probably due to the corticosteroid used as a prophylaxis in our centre. This reduction was not observed in ES patients. Regarding phosphorylation of p-38, it was significantly higher in cells exposed to sera from ES patients than in response to sera from patients who did not develop ES.",

The aim of this study was to compare the incidence of ARF in both types of HSCT and to evaluate its impact on overall survival (OS) and non-relapse mortality (NRM). Methods: All alloSCT performed in one center between 2010 and 2018 were included in this study. AlloHSCT from cord blood and from haploidentical donors were excluded. The renal function and the incidence of the main complications after alloSCT from day 0 to day +90 were evaluated.

The median follow-up time was 2.3 years for the NMA group and 3.6 years for the MA group. Patients from the MA group had higher incidence of grade 3-4 mucositis (60% vs. 22%, p< 0.001) and acute GVHD of any grade (70% vs. 53%, p=0.029) than patients from the NMA alloHSCT. The incidence of ARF was similar in both groups (72% in NMA and 71% in MA). In the NMA group arterial hypertension (HR 2.05, p=0.018), obesity (HR 4.16, p< 0.001) and prior pneumonia (HR 3.19, < 0.001) were predisposing factors for ARF by multivariate analysis, whereas any factor was identified in the MA group. ARF had no impact on 2-year OS in both groups (28% vs. 35% p=0.406 for the NMA group and 45% vs. 40% p=0.623 for the MA group). However, worse OS were observed in patients with grade 2-3 ARF in the NMA group (18% vs. 43%, p=0.048) and in patients with grade 3 ARF in the MA group (25% vs. 59%, p=0.011). In turn, ARF had no influence on NRM in the MA group but was associated with a trend for higher NRM in the NMA group (59% vs. 35%, p=0.084).",

Mucositis is characterized by painful gastrointestinal mucosa lesions impairing the solid and liquid foods intake and increased risk of infections, bleeding, and intestinal paresis. Thus, it greatly decreases the quality of life of a transplant recipient. According to WHO recommendations, the moderate pain control in pediatric patient is based on the use of low-dose morphine. However, there are some factors such as genetic polymorphisms causing variable morphine pharmacokinetics in children, side effects, and social factors (caregivers' general unwillingness to use narcotic analgesics), which cause the need for alternative pain relief options in pediatric practice. Tramadol, which has both opioid and non-opioid mechanisms of action, may be a feasible option in mild to moderate pain. It may be delivered via patient-controlled analgesia (PCA), although there is no consensus on its optimal parameters in pediatric practice.",

Some patients maintain serological protection after allogenic SCT. Immunoglobulin levels were normal, suggesting no need for immunoglobulin administration to prevent infections. Flu, pneumococcus and HBV vaccines were the most frequently administered. Pneumococcus vaccination generated a much larger serological response than HBV. This seroconversion occurred in patients under immunosuppressive treatment. The analysis of lymphocyte T, NK, B total and B functional subsets could be useful when programming an early vaccination schedule after SCT. Completion of the vaccination schedule was heterogeneous despite giving specific indications. Therefore a more rigorous supervision of the process may be required. Background: The significant advances that have been achieved in the allogeneic transplantation (alloHCT) field, have resulted in better post-transplant outcome and therefore complications other than the Graft vs. Host disease (GvHD) or disease recurrence become increasingly important.

Calcineurin inhibitors plus either short-term Methotrexate or Mycophenolate Mofetil were given as GvHD prophylaxis. The diagnosis of PT-MS was based on the NCEP-ATPIII criteria; for patients with unknown data for abdominal circumference the body mass index (BMI) \u226525kg/m 2 was consider as a criterion for PT-MS diagnosis.

Seventeen diagnosed after the 1 st trimester post alloSCT and additional 3 patients after 2 nd trimester. Sixteen out of 20 patients had elevated glucose and BMI>25kg/m 2 , 13/20 elevated triglycerides levels, 12/20 low HDL levels and 10/20 hypertension. Four (20%) had already known history of MS before alloSCT (for 10 patients no data were available for MS diagnosis before alloSCT). Interestingly, for 7/20(35%) patients who had diagnosed with PT-MS either in the 1 st or in the 2 nd trimester the syndrome was reversible and did not fulfill the criteria for PT-MS beyond 6 months post alloSCT. Patients' gender, age, BMI, the type of conditioning regimen and GvHD co-existence evaluated as potential predisposing factors for PT-MS diagnosis. In univariate and multivariate analysis only the: BMI>25kg/m 2 and age>35 years were detected as significant risk factors (p< 0.03). The PT-MS did not affected negatively the survival or the NRM incidence post alloSCT Conclusions: In our study, in agreement with other publications, we demonstrated that the PT-MS is not an uncommon complication post in the early post transplant period however, for a significant number of patients the syndrome was a reversible. For patients with high risk features (BMI>25kg/m 2 , age> 35 years, known history of diabetes-mellitus, dyslipidemia, hypertension) apart of close monitoring, specific diet and encouragement for adequate exercise might help to reduce the incidence and the severity of PT-MS. Nevertheless, prospective and well design trials are warranted to determine the accurate incidence, severity and the impact of PT-MS on the alloSCT outcome.",

The duration of hospitalization can be prolonged by several intercurrences, frequently generating anxiety in the patient and their caregiver, which may lead to confinement and reactive depression. Interventions in the hospital environment, in addition to the continuous training of the multidisciplinary team, can have a positive impact in this process with improvement in the process of discharge and quality of life of the patient and his / her family. Methods: The objective of this research was to evaluate the impact of a reformulation in the unit, completed in May 2018, which modified the facilities with availability of hermetic balconies in each room, with a view of an internal garden. There was also the addition of a screen in the corridor of the floor with images -technology known as videoowall, interconnected to motion sensors (kinects) that allow interaction between patients and families, besides facilitating physiotherapy and physical exercise. There was re-training of the multidisciplinary team with emphasis on the practice of humanization. The methodology consisted in the application of questionnaires of satisfaction to patients and their families during the period of hospitalization in a bone marrow transplant unit in the third quarter of 2018. The items evaluated ranged from the quality of the information provided by the medical team and nursing, to the cordiality and agility with which the patient and his patient were treated by the global team. The results were compared with a similar period of the same unit in the previous year and with the indices collected simultaneously in another unit of the same hospital (cardio-intensive).",

Adipose tissue is an attractive source of mesenchymal stromal/stem cells (ASCs) for regenerative therapeutic applications because they can be harvested from autologous donors with minimally invasive methods, can be rapidly expanded ex vivo, show low immunogenicity if allogeneic, and can be used in autologous or heterologous settings. The present study examines the fate and effects of intracerebroventricularly (ICV) transplanted ASCs in a traumatic brain injury (TBI) model. Methods: ASCs were isolated from inguinal fat pad of adult Wistar rats under sterile conditions and cultured according to standard procedures. ASCs at passage 2 (2x10 5 cells) were seeded and transfected with Sleeping Beauty transposase and pT2 Venus-neo R plasmids. Selection with G418 antibiotic resulted in the generation of a homogeneous ASC population which expressed fluorescent Venus protein for several passages, Phenotypic characterization showed that these cells were 99.6% double positive for CD44 and CD90 stem cell markers, verifying their mesenchymal origin. TBI was induced by stereotactic surgery under deep anaesthesia and subsequently ICV transplantation of Venus+ ASCs was performed on adult Wistar rats. Normal ASCs-transplanted and TBI-saline transplanted rats were used as controls. The proliferation, migration, survival and fate of transplanted ASCs and their effect on injury restoration were examined six weeks post transplantation (PT).",

ASCs were found scattered distributed in brain as individual cells, and there were no aggregates of ASCs or mass formation into lateral ventricles. Extensive migration of ASCs was mainly performed through white matter tracks in the corpus callosum and fimbria of hippocampus. Six weeks PT ASCs retained the characteristics of mesenchymal cells and did not differentiate into cells of neural lineage. ASCs exhibited limited long-term survival, which is restricted in perivascular areas probably contributing to vascular formation. Homing of ASCs into peri-injured area was detected in half of the animals and achieved through the corpus callosum, as revealed by the collagen depositions, in this white matter track. Transplanted ASCs reduced the area of TBI cavity and did not enhance the astroglial scarring in peri-injured area.

Our previous work reported that abnormal bone marrow (BM) endothelial cells (ECs) were involved in the pathogenesis of PGF patients after allo-HSCT (BBMT2013; BMT 2016; Blood2016), but the explicit mechanism requires further clarification. Autophagy is a self-degradative process responsible for the elimination of cytosolic components including proteins and damaged organelles. Recent findings demonstrated that stimulation of autophagy could reduce oxidative status and angiogenic potential in ECsafter high-glucose exposure, from diabetic patients.However, little is known regarding the autophagy of BM ECs in PGF patients. Therefore, the current study was performed to evaluate whether autophagy in BM ECs play a role in the pathogenesis of PGF. Moreover, to investigate the effects of autophagic regulation on ECs and thereby regulating hematopoietic stem cell (HSCs). Methods: In the prospective case-control study, the autophagy levels were compared in BM ECs from PGF patients, and their matched good graft function (GGF) patients.The expression levels of autophagy-related markers (LC3, Beclin1, and P62), and intracellular autophagosomes were detected by immunohistochemical staining, flow cytometry, western blot and transmission electron microscopy. Subsequently, rapamycin (the autophagy activators) or hydroxychloroquine (HCQ, the autophagy inhibitor) were administrated tothe 7-day cultivated BM ECs and Human Umbilical Vein Endothelial Cells (HUVECs), respectively.The autophagic vacuoleswere detected by Monodansylcadaverine (MDC) staining assay. The BM ECsand HUVECs were evaluated by cell counting, DiI-Ac-LDL and FITC-lectin-UEA-1 double staining, migration, cell proliferation, and levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS). To explore whether autophagy would affect the ability of BM ECs to support HSCs in vitro, BM CD34+ cells from healthy donors were co-cultured with cultivated BM ECs and HUVECs. Colony-forming unit (CFU) and the apoptosis of co-cultured HSCs were analyzed.",

We introduced recently a novel protocol for AHSCT: combination of ambulatory mobilization with very low doses of Ara-C and G-CSF connected with direct AHSCT with fresh cells. This protocol allowed us to reduce the transplant risk in various patient groups traditionally connected with high risk of complications. In this work we summarize the experience in such high risk patients. Methods: The prospectively collected database of patients after AHSCT was searched for patients who underwent AHSCT after chemomobilization with Ara-C and transplantation with fresh cells and who fulfilled at least one study inclusion criteria: a) dependence on dialysis b) amyloidosis c) systemic sclerosis d) disqualification from transplantation at other centre due to the high risk of complications.

But it has been pointed out that recipient age alone can not be regarded as contraindication for allo HSCT in the literature recently, supported by suitable donor, conditioning regimens and appropriate management of complications. We conducted a retrospective study of elderly patients who had advanced hematologic malignancies to elucidate the outcome of single umbilical cord blood transplantation (sUCBT) in Toranomon Hospital Kajigaya, Japan. Methods: We retrospectively investigated the outcomes of 19 patients aged over 65 who underwent their first UCBT from June 2013 to December 2017 in our medical center.",

Natural killer (NK) cells are cytotoxic lymphocytes that are capable to kill their targets in a non-specific manner and additionally do not cause GvHD. Therefore, using CD19-CAR-NK cells exhibits several advantages, such as safety in clinical use, possible allogenic settings and the potential to also attack heterologous leukemia cells which lost CD19. Previous approaches used CD19-CAR-NK cells pre-stimulated by feeder cells, bearing potential risks.

Relevance to alloSCT has been demonstrated in preclinical models: the depletion of uric acid led to improved survival and reduced GVHD (J Exp Med. 2013 Sep 23;210(10):1899-910). Results of a clinical pilot trial suggested that peri-transplant uric acid depletion reduce acute GVHD incidence (BBMT 2014 May;20(5):730-4).",

Genotype AA was present in 170 donors, AG in 183 donors and 44 donors was homozygous for G allele. Recipients who received graft from G allele carrier donors showed significantly increased cumulative incidence of relapse (at 24 months AA: 20.7%, AG: 23.6% and GG: 34.3%; p=0.04).

Treatment options for cGVHD, particularly its sclerotic forms remain limited. Active Hedgehog (Hh) signaling was shown as a therapeutic target in both mouse and human cGVHD, with limited efficacy and significant toxicities described in a published clinical trial (DeFilipp, 2017). Methods: Adult patients with steroid refractory sclerodermatous cGVHD, defined as requiring >0.5 mg/kg/day of prednisone dose equivalent (PDE), or need for second-or third-line therapy beyond corticosteroids and calcineurin inhibitors or sirolimus were eligible for this open label study of vismodegib, a first generation Hh pathway inhibitor. Primary endpoint was failure free survival, defined as absence of non-relapse mortality, no recurrent malignancy, steroid dose at 6 months =< 0.2 mg/kg/day of PDE, and no addition of new systemic treatment. Vismodegib was administered orally for 6-12 months, with dose reductions at development of toxicities. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were isolated from samples collected at treatment initiation and every three months thereafter. The immune profile of circulating B cells was analyzed by flow cytometry and T helper polarization by qRT-PCR of sortpurified CD4+ T cells.",

We tested the hypothesis that somatic neomutations occurring after SCT from donor and/or recipient DNA may trigger GVHD. Methods: We longitudinally analyzed both constitutive and somatic mutations by whole exome sequencing (WES) in 2 patients who received SCT from a sex-matched HLAidentical sibling for NPM1 mutated acute myeloid leukemia (Pt#1) and JAK2 V617F mutated primary myelofibrosis (Pt#2). Both patients were initially refractory to alloreactivity, i.e. not displaying any signs of GVHD, even after several donor lymphocyte infusions. Acute gut GVHD finally occurred after a further DLI preceded by a lymphodepleting chemotherapy. In Pt#2, GVHD correlated with a graft-versus-tumor effect. WES was performed on DNA from recipient saliva and donor PBMCs (germline samples) and from sequential post-SCT PBMCs samples on a HiSeq2500 Illumina with 2x100bp paired-end reads at a mean depth of coverage of 190-210X. Germline and somatic mutations were determined using in-house bioinformatic pipelines (named Ewok from the Curie Institute and Smaug from the Henri Mondor hospital), using briefly GATK as variant caller for germline samples, and a combination of 3 variant callers for matched normaltumor pairs. We adjusted parameters to detect somatic mutations at a minimal variant allelic frequency (VAF) of 5% compared to recipient and donor germline for all variations (minimal coverage = 8X for germline and 5X for tumor sample).",

Indeed, at this final point, the somatic variant rate dramatically decreased by 80% as compared to previous timepoints. By subtracting variants detected pre-and post-SCT from those identified at the ultimate time-point of GVHD occurrence, we created 2 sets of 5 and 7 variants respectively for each patient (keeping only variants with at least 4 reads of mutated DNA). These variants can be classified in 2 categories: (i) those with only with a slight increase at time of GVHD, i.e. \u2264 2-fold compared to highest previous VAF (LRRC43, OR8U1, OR10G9, ALPP, FRG1, FRG2B and LILRB3 genes), and (ii) those with a significant increase at that time, i.e. > 2-fold compared to highest previous VAF (PHF2, SMPD1, ERCC8 and KRTAP9-1 genes). None of the variants or genes involved was common between the 2 patients. Ontology classification of mutated genes showed the implication of some of them in cell death, regulation of MAP kinase activity, mRNA splicing and immune system process, making them good candidates for further studies.

As an important innate immune cell population, NK cells can temporally bridge the transient period of T-cell deficiency post allo-HSCT, by protection from opportunistic infections and prevention of leukemic relapse by graft-versus-leukemia (GvL) effect. NK cells not only preserve homeostasis through targeted killing of allo-reactive T cells and thereby control GvHD but also enhance inflammation by secretion of TNF-\u03b1 and IFN-\u03b3 and thereby promote GvHD.

Notably, ECP therapy could shift the NK cells from a cytotoxic to a regulatory phenotype within the CD56 bri NK cells. In spite the immunomodulatory effect of ECP on NK cells, NK activity could be kept intact under ECP therapy. The killing activity of NK cells was stable as confirmed by a 51 Cr release assay.

Strategies for keeping alloHSCT more effective and safe are needed in order to reduce morbidity while improving its immunological effect to control disease relapse. Post-transplant Cyclophosphamide (ptCy) has been demonstrated to improve acute GVHD (aGVHD) and chronic GVHD (cGVHD) control in allogeneic bone-marrow HCT from identical and haploidentical donor. The use of ptCy, after peripheral blood stem cell transplantation (alloPBSCT) from HLA-matched unrelated/related donors, has been investigated by our group in a clinical trial (NCT 02300571) and preliminary results were published last year. Here we report updated efficacy and safety data about the expanded cohort of patients treated with ptCy followed by tacrolimus and mycophenolate mofetil (T/MMF).",

From time of diagnosis to maximum aGVHD grade, 52% of patients had new organ involvement or an increase in aGVHD grade. Median time from diagnosis to maximum grade was 5.5 days, and was 2.5 days for patients with lower GI involvement. Systemic corticosteroids were initiated on the day of diagnosis for 73% of patients. Average starting daily dose was 93 mg (1.1 mg/kg) for prednisone and 136 mg (1.6 mg/kg) for methylprednisolone. Steroid dose was increased for 44% of patients during follow-up; 80% were unable to taper below 10 mg/day. Among patients who received additional systemic anti-GVHD therapy (n=32), 41% increased their corticosteroid dose before initiation of additional anti-GVHD therapy. Median time from initiation of corticosteroids to additional therapy was 16.5 days. Frequently used therapies were mycophenyalate mofetil (25%), ATG (16%), extracorporeal photophoresis (13%), tocilizumab (13%), etanercept (9%), and sirolimus (9%). aGVHD recurred in 31% of patients and was managed by increasing corticosteroid dose in 70% of patients. 44% had any infection within first 100 days post-HSCT.

However, there is a lack of studies that compared histological finding of ductopenia between post-autologous HSCT and post-allogenic HSCT. Studying severity of ductopenia following allogenic HSCT, we aimed to demonstrate lack of correlation between ductopenia and clinical signs of liver GVHD. Methods: We retrospectively collected a series of 72 allogeneic HSCT performed from 2005 to 2017 in the Institute Burlo Garofolo. All patients undergo percutaneous liver biopsy in most cases at three months, one year and three or more years after HSCT. Indications for biopsy were alteration noted at 2 weekly follow-up assessments of at least one clinical or laboratory marker of liver impairment or cholestasis. Ductopenia was defined by number of portal tracts with no interlobular bile duct divided by the total number (severe if the ratio was less than 0.2). Clinical GVHD was defined by NIH consensus criteria Results: Our population involved 64% males and 36% females with oncological (70%) and non-oncological underlying disease (30%). Clinical signs of liver GVHD were present in 18% of the patients (n=13), 8% with contextual intestinal involvement, 8% with cutaneous and intestinal involvement. 71 patients underwent biopsy at a mean time of 110 +/-32 days after HSCT, 45 patients underwent a biopsy at 12 months after HSCT and 35 patients after three or more years from HSCT. Results of biopsies are showed in table 1. No difference in incidence of ductopenia were found between liver GVHD group and no GVHD. Table] 1.

It is well known that early concentration level of tacrolimus is correlated with the risk of acute graft versus host disease (aGVHD), however, whether range of standard derivation (SD) of early tacrolimus concentration after allo-HSCT also affect to the risk of aGVHD still remains unknown. Here, we investigate the correlation between the range of SD of early tacrolimus concentration after donor hematopoietic cells engraftment and the development of aGVHD. Methods: We retrospectively assessed 207 patients who underwent allo-HSCT in our hospital from 2010-2017. All patients received standard GVHD prophylaxis by continuous intravenous (iv) TAC with starting dose of 0.02 mg/ kg/day from 1 day before allo-HSCT (day -1) and iv methotrexate on day 1, 3, 6 at dose of 10 mg/m 2 , 7 mg/m 2 , 7 mg/m 2 , respectively.

To evaluate the SD of weekly tacrolimus concentration, the range of SD of tacrolimus concentration at day1-7 (week-1), day8-14(week-2), day15-21(week-3) and day22-28(week-4) were calculated. The difference of the range of SD between the 2 groups that develop or did not develop aGVHD was compared by using Mann-Whitney U test.

One of the most challenging aspects in the diagnosis and management of sclerodermoid cGVHD (scGVHD) is the differentiation between reversible symptoms related to active cGVHD and nonreversible symptoms related to residual permanent damage such as long-standing fibrosis. Although several candidate biomarkers of cGVHD inflammatory activity have been proposed, none of them are currently validated. Therefore, there is a need for the development of more quantifiable and reproducible measurements tools to guide clinical decisions. We report our experience evaluating the usefulness of high-frequency ultrasonography (HFUS) plus Doppler ultrasound (Doppler-US) and serum fibrosis biomarkers to determine the inflammatory activity of scGVHD. Methods: We report 6 patients with scGVHD. HFUS plus Doppler-US were performed at diagnosis of scGVHD and at different time-points after treatment initiation. Serum hyaluronic acid and pro-colagen-III were measured as fibrosis biomarkers simultaneously with HFUS and Doppler-US. NIH cGVHD 2014 Consensus Conference diagnosis criteria, scoring system, and response criteria were used to assess global and organ-specific cGVHD, and to measure overall response to therapy. Abnormal ultrasound findings were defined as the presence of \u2265 1 of the following: hypoechogenic dermis, dermo-epidermal junction effacement, hypoechogenicity of septa and/or hyperechogenicity of lobules in hypodermis, hypoechogenic fascia, or myositis, for HFUS; and, vessels thicker than 1mm in dermis and/or hypodermis, systolic pressure >10 cm/sec, and index of vascular resistance >0.75, for Doppler-US.

So far, there is no approved standard of care for aGVHD second-line treatment. There is an urgent need to identify effective therapy for SR-aGVHD to improve patients' outcomes. Fecal Microbiota Transfer (FMT) might be beneficial to substantially improve the prognosis. Higher gut microbial diversity is strongly associated with increased survival in GvHD patients. Recent studies reported promising results of SR-aGVHD patients treated with FMT. Further evaluation to confirm the efficacy and safety of FMT for aGVHD is warranted. The ongoing phase 2 study (HERACLES) investigates the efficacy of allogeneic FMT in the treatment of patients with SR-aGVHD. HERACLES was launched after the ODYSSEE study showed promising results in the reconstruction of gut microbiota diversity after induction chemotherapy with FMT in Acute Myeloid Leukemia patients.

Interestingly, various fluorescence-activated single cell sorted iNKT-cell subsets were all able to induce apoptosis of host DCs.

Blocking the iNKTcell receptor engagement with a CD1d antibody prevented iNKT-cell degranulation as well as the subsequent induction of host DC apoptosis. Inhibition of cytotoxic factors also abrogated apoptosis of DCs. In turn, sorted apoptotic DCs induced tolerogenic DCs characterized by a high expression of PD-L1 in mixed lymphocyte reactions.

A series of functional assays in vitro were performed to assess the function and stability of Tregs from patients with and without aGVHD.Meanwhile, to assume the affect of Lkb1 on GVHD outcome, we established a murine transplant model,which recipient Balb/c animals were transplanted with the same amount of mixture made by BM, CD4 +CD25-Tcon cells from C57BL/6 and CD4+ Foxp3 YFP+ Tregs from either Foxp3CreLkb1f/f or Foxp3Cre mice.",

The only effective method of preventing taGVHT is irradiation of blood components with ionizing radiation (X-ray or gamma radiation). But the use of ionizing radiation sources has a number of technical and material difficulties. The emergence of pathogen reduction technologies (PRT) in blood components targeted by nucleic acids has opened the possibility of using these technologies as an alternative to irradiating of blood components. Several PRT demonstrated effective inactivation of WBC in platelet concentrates and blood plasma. So, determination of the influence of PRT based on the combined effect of riboflavin (RF) and ultraviolet (UV) on the viability and proliferating potential of lymphocytes in whole blood is important.",

According to Sorror's and EBMT scores he was considered a high-risk transplant. The patient and the CB unit were sex-mismatched, shared the same blood groups and were both CMV+/EBV+. He received a TBF conditioning regimen that was followed by the infusion of 0.54x10 5 /kg CD34+ CB cells. GVHD prophylaxis consisted of rabbit ATG, Cyclosporine A (CsA) and mycophenolate mophetyl (MMF). Neutrophil engraftment occurred on day +28, whereas platelets were never >20.000/\u03bcl. On day +67 a 2 cm bulged area became apparent on the left parietal region of the skull. An echotomography showed that the lesion adhered to the bone without infiltrating it and lacked blood vessels and suggested that it may be either a site of disease relapse or an area of infection. At the same time a bone marrow (BM) aspiration showed morphological CR confirmed by immune-phenotypic studies and X-Y FISH a complete chimera. Since the patient was still febrile no biopsy was performed, but on day +94 the axial diameter of the lesion that on a CT scan showed the same appearance revealed by the previous echo-tomography increased to 4 cm. Thus, the lesion was surgically removed and histological examination showed CD33+, CD14+/-, CD163+/-, CD45/LCA+/-, CD21-, CD23-, CD35-, CD207-, and S100-neoplastic cells whose phenotype suggested a granulocytic sarcoma rather than a histiocytic sarcoma. Immuno-chemistry confirmed this suggestion by showing a nuclear NPM1 positivity. FISH studies demonstrated that these neoplastic cells were of recipient's origin. A novel BM aspiration showed CR confirmed by immune-phenotypic studies and FISH revealed a complete chimera.

Nine pts received a MSD bone marrow graft, 23 pts received 24 T-haplo-HSCT (1 second T-haplo due to graft rejection).

FK506 was administered as a 20-hours continuous infusion, CsA as 4-hours bolus injections; both target level adjusted (CsA: 100-120 ng/ml; FK506: 5-8 ng/ ml).

Continuous infusion of FK506 vs. bolus injections of CsA might have levelled concentration peaks. The NT observed with CsA could be the consequence of predominantly CsArelated vascular toxicity inflicting pre-damaged vessels in SCD.

Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) with a matched sibling donor (MSD) is currently the curative standard of care for SCD patients (pts). However, MSD availability is < 20%. A T-cell depleted haploidentical HSCT (T-haplo-HSCT) from a relative, mostly a parent, expands the donor availability while exhibiting low GvHD rates and thus could offer cure to the remaining 80% of SCD patients. In a pilot study, comparing T-haplo-HSCT with MSD HSCT in advanced stage SCD, using almost identical transplant regimens for both. The overall (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) was 90% vs. 100%, respectively. Methods: These results led to the design of a clinical trial to assess TCD-haplo-HSCT prospectively which aims to demonstrate that a HSCT from a haploidentical relative is not inferior to a MSD HSCT with regard to major outcome parameter. This phase 2, prospective, stratified, open-label study is targeting enrollment of 212 patients aged 1-35 years with homozygous HbS disease or heterozygous HbSC or HbS 0/+ \u00df-Thal suffering from severe or moderate SCD related complications. Inclusion criteria are clinically significant SCD related complications such as stroke, silent crisis, pathological angio-MRI, transcranial doppler (TCD) velocity >200 cm/s, 2 or more episodes of acute chest syndrome (ACS) in a lifetime, chronic transfusion dependency, transfusion-refractory allo-immunization and others. Pts fulfilling inclusion criteria will be stratified according to donor availability. Pts with a MSD will receive a bone marrow graft, pts requiring an alternative donor will be transplanted with an a\u00df/CD19 depleted graft from a haploidentical family donor. The conditioning regimen for both groups will be identical with the exception that antithymoglobulin (ATG-Neovii \u00ae ) is given upfront in Thaplo-HSCT versus day -3 to -1 in MSD. Chemotherapy consists of thiotepa, fludarabine and treosulfan. Posttransplant immunosuppression will consist of mofetil mycophenolate and tacrolimus for a duration >6 months in T-haplo-HSCT and < 6 months in MSD, depending on chimerism.

Since investigations directed towards hemoglobinopathies or membrane defects like hereditary spherocytosis were unremarkable, she was not transfused for 6 years after the age of 3.5-years because hemoglobin level was constant over 7 g/dl. Her BM examination showed erythroid hyperplasia and feature of dyserythropoiesis with a few binucleated erythroblasts. It was decided to follow-up the patient with a diagnosis of CDA II. After the age of 10-years, the need for transfusion started again for every 4 to 5 months which led the parents of our patient to request for bone marrow transplantation, however, the diagnosis was not definite, and because of the insufficient data for the transplantations for CDA II patients, it was decided to go on to follow-up. Nevertheless, after 2 years, the frequency of transfusion gradually increased to every 2-3 weeks, and bone marrow transplantation was brought into question again. At that time, genetic examination was started and SEC23B gene was analyzed by direct sequencing. HSCT decision from her HLA 10/10 matched brother, carrying SEC23B mutation in heterozygous state, was taken. In the preparation regimen, busulfan (Bu) at a myeloablative weight adjusted dose (4 days), 200 mg/kg cyclophosphamide (Cy) (4 days), and 30 mg/kg antithymocyte globulin (ATG fresenius) were used.

However, the engraftment was not obtained in differentiated cells from EB culture system. We obtained and analyzed 301 ESCs, 554 CD34 + cells from EB culture system, 440 CD34 + cells from 3D culture system, and 218 CD34 + cells from mPBMCs. The cells were divided into 11 cluters ( Figure 1A ). In both differentiation systems, the CD34 + cells from day 7 were more heterogeneous than CD34 + cells from day 10 and day 14 ( Figure 1B) . However, CD34 + cells from mPBMCs were more homogeneous, probably because the differentiated CD34 + cells contained several cell lineages, including hematopoietic cells, endothelial cells and mesenchymal cells. There is transcriptional overlap between individual CD34 + cells from EB and 3D culture systems. However, we found that cluster 3, which is composed mainly of CD34 + cells from 3D at day 14 and day 10, expressed similar level of several hematopoietic regulator as HSC, such as TAL1, LMO2, ERG ( Figure 1C ).

However, at 2 years, CD4 and CD8 T-cell levels and sjTRECs levels were lower than those observed in healthy donors. sjTRECs kinetics was associated with the increase in CD4 naive T-cells (overall, p < 0.002). This correlation suggests that most of CD4 naive T-cells derives from thymic re-education of donor precursor stem cells, whereas CD8 naive T-cells undergo peripheral expansion after thymic production. Furthermore, an increase in CD4 revertant memory T-cells was also significantly correlated with sjTRECs kinetic (p 0,041). Central and effector memory T-cells showed a faster thymic-independent expansion in both CD4 and CD8 Tcells. Interestingly, sjTRECs levels and thymic dependent immune-reconstitution were higher in a cohort of 63 patients undergoing HSCT from HLA identical donors (manuscript in preparation). Clinical outcomes and thymic function were correlated starting at 6 months after HSCT. Lower thymic output was significantly associated by multivariate analysis with low pre-transplant TRECs values (p 0,002 and p < 0,001 in CD4 and CD8, respectively), moderate-severe chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD; p < 0,001 in CD8), and age (\u226550 years, p 0,006 in CD8).",

In many cases, there is not sufficient time to search for alternative donors and it is necessary to plan an immunosuppressive strategy to decrease the DSA level, thus reducing the risk of GF. To date, there is no consensus on desensitization standards to manage DSAs in HSCT. The aim of this study was to determine the incidence of anti-HLA Ab and DSAs in hematologic patients candidate to an allogeneic HSCT, and the efficacy of our desensitization protocol. Here, we present an update of the results obtained with our strategy. Methods: Between August 2014 and September 2018, we prospectively screened for DSA 140 consecutive patients candidates to an allogeneic HSCT. Anti-HLA Ab research was carried out using the Luminex bead assay (Lifecode Screen and LSA I/II-Immucor). The results were expressed as mean fluorescence intensity (MFI); MFI >1000 was considered positive. In case of a mismatched related donor, a flow cytometric crossmatch test (FCXM) was performed. If the patient had DSAs and only one available donor, a desensitization strategy was employed, scheduled with Rituximab on day -15, single-volume plasmapheresis procedures (PP), usually on day -9 and -8, intravenous immunoglobulins on day -7, infusion of HLA selected platelets for DSA absorption in case of persistent antibodies directed against class I HLA antigens. The aim of this schedule was to avoid interferences with chemotherapy and anti-T-cell globulins, infused during condition regimen Results: Since August 2014, 140 patients have been prospectively screened. Thirty-three patients (23.6%) showed anti-HLA Ab and 9 of them (6.4%) had DSAs: 6 were treated with the desensitization strategy, applied according to the MFI score and the FCXM result, and all of them obtained an engraftment; in 2 cases, an alternative donor was selected and in 1 case the research for an alternative donor is still underway. DSA detection was performed every 7 days after HSCT for the first month and 60, 180 and 365 days following HSCT. Neither a DSA rebound nor other complications were observed during the follow-up.",

However, CBT has been associated with delayed engraftment and immune reconstitution, especially if in vivo T-cell depletion, such as antithymoglobulin (ATG), is used. Methods: From 2010 to 2018, 20 patients with high-risk diseases received intra-bone infusion of unwashed single CB unit with an ATG-free GvHD prophylaxis; 7 were in active disease at CBT and 8 had received prior allogeneic stem cell transplantation. Median age was 44 y [range (r) . Conditioning regimen was myeloablative, with Treosulfan and Fludarabine in all, intensified with Melphalan in 15 or with 4Gy TBI in 4.

No statistical difference was also encountered for the RBC transfusion need for stem cell source, peripheral blood vs bone marrow. A total of 15 patients were followed up for reticulocyte engraftment. The median time for reticulocyte engraftment was 19 days (range, 15-60) for all patients. Reticulocyte engraftment was tended to be faster in minor ABO-mismatched group (p=0.05) than major or ABO-compatible ones. Nineteen patients achieved independence from RBC support after a median time of 44 days (range, 11-61 days) in ABOcompatible patients, 25 days (range, 7-52 days) in minor ABO-incompatibilityand 34 days (range, 20-57 days) in major ABO-incompatibilitygroup, respectively (p>0.5).

Considering the increase of patients indicated to the HSCT and the lack of knowledge about the costs resulting from this treatment, is important to identify and detail the resources consumed in each phase of HSCT and provide knowledge to the public health brazilian system. We aimed measure the total cost of related HSCT, based on micro-costing study of patients assisted in two hospitals in the South region of Brazil. Methods: HSCT costs were estimated using the timedriven activity based costing method (TDABC), which measured cost of services / products based on actual consumption of resources. We collected data from medical records of 12 patients submitted to allogeneic HSCT in 2017 from public and private (philanthropic) hospitals. We interviewed professionals involved in the TCTH activities, we performed chrono-analysis and, we consulted financial and administrative systems reports of hospitals. In order to compare costs according to clinical complications observed in patients, we grouped into two ranges of complexity: low/ medium and high. The study was divided into stages: HSCT processes mapping; costs measurement; and analysis of results. Finally, the costs were compared: by activity, by resource and by hospital. This study was financed by PSID-UHS, by an agreement signed between Ministry of Health and Moinhos de Vento Hospital, through adjustment term number: 04 / 2014, and approved by Research Ethics Committees.",

The median time to resolution in 18 (85%) who achieved remission after first AIC was 6.5 months (range 1.4-28.6 months). 1 had one relapse and 2 had two relapses. 2 died after development of AIC (1 aspergillus pneumonia; 1 multi-organ failure). Of 19 (91%) surviving patients after AIC, 4 had on-going AIHA at median of follow-up 2.5 years post-HCT (range 0.9-4.8 years). On univariate completing-risk analysis, age at transplant >2.5years (p=0.02) and pre-transplant AIC (p=0.02) were associated with higher incidence of AIC (Figure 1a -Ic). On Fine-and-grey models, only age at transplant (HR 3.08, 95%CI 1.12-8.49, p=0.03) was independently associated with AIC. Of 157 with complete immune reconstitution data, na\u00efve T cells >100cells/mL at 6 months post-HCT was associated lower incidence of AIC (HR 0.36, 95%CI 0.15-0.91, p=0.03) (Figure 1d) Conclusions: Younger age and thymopoiesis were associated lower incidence of AIC in children with PID after HCT Clinical Background: Human heme-oxygenase-1 (HO-1) deficiency has been reported to present with tetrad of anemia, nephritis, inflammation and asplenia and is fatal if not treated. Its an auto-inflammatory disorder. Macrophages/ Monocytes express HO-1 and are engaged in recycling of red cells. Human HO-1 deficiency results in intravascular hemolysis and severe damage to the endothelial system, kidneys, and other organs. Transplantation of either healthy wild type macrophages or new macrophages produced by SCT from healthy donor has been proven to be curative for HO-1 deficiency in mice. In 2018, we had reported first successful allogeneic SCT for human HO-1 deficiency.",

Methods: A 9-yr-old-girl presented with complaints of fever, anemia and severe hypertension. In the past, at the age of 7 years she was admitted for high fever for 1 month and needed blood transfusion for the first time for severe anemia and had high platelets and high ferritin. She was treated as macrophage activation syndrome with prednisolone alone and later cyclosporine was added. She had short stature, abnormal facies but normal development. Hemoglobin 9 g/dl, urine for haemoglobin was positive, platelets 1055, 000/ul, ferritin 2568 mcg/L and urine albumin 4+ and Urine RBC 20-30/hpf. Ultrasound and CT scan abdomen showed asplenia. A diagnosis of HO-1 deficiency was suspected. Mutation analysis showed homozygous missense mutations in exon2 (R44X) on chromosome 22q12, which would result in the absence of the functional HO-1 protein. Both parents were carriers of this mutation. We managed her over next 6-years with prednisolone, hydroxyurea and mycophenolate mofetil (MMF). However she remained steroid dependent. HLA-typing confirmed her healthy unaffected 13-year-old brother to be a fully matched donor. At the age of 16 years she was taken up for MSD SCT after taking informed consent. She weighed just 16 kg. We conditioned her with Alemtuzumab-0.8mg/kg, Fludarabine-160mg/m2, Cyclophospamide-29mg/kg and Total body irradiation 2 Gray. We infused 9 million/kg peripheral blood stem cells from her brother.

Given the elevated mortality risk for IFI, and the apparently safe and well-tolerated application of IFN-\u03b3, an adjuvant immunotherapy might be considered. Further studies are needed to define the indication and duration of this kind of adjunctive immunotherapy.

We detected 29 CMV, 35 EBV and 18 BKV infections/reactivations in 20, 32 and 17 patients respectively, with a mean of 2\u00b10.4 infection per patient from all three viruses (1-7/patient). Of note, 22/38 patients experienced reactivations from more than one virus, requiring repeated treatments with antiviral agents and/or rituximab. The cost of antiviral agents for all CMV, EBV and BKV reactivations/infections was 78,656\u20ac, 58,504\u20ac and 11,331\u20ac respectively (3,146\u20ac, 2,089\u20ac and 1,416 \u20ac/patient, respectively).

The actual cost is undoubtedly higher as the hospitalization fee for transplant recipients is largely underestimated in Greece. Considering not only the hematopoietic but also the solid organ transplant recipients, the financial burden of antiviral treatment for national economies is enormous. Given that antiviral pharmacotherapy is often associated with suboptimal efficacy, toxicity, development of drug resistance, reactivation recurrences and repeated hospitalizations, it is expected that a one-time treatment with multi-virus-specific T cells, able to expand in vivo and provide a long-lasting protection without significant toxicity, will serve as a powerful and costeffective treatment over conventional pharmacotherapy.",

The median time after transplantation (790 vs 565 days), T-cell counts (349 vs 296/ \u03bcl), Bcell counts (162 vs 135/ \u03bcl), IgG-level (8,3 vs 7,6 g/ l), proportion of immunosuppressed pts (75% vs 63%), male/ female ratio was not significantly different between groups 1 and 2. Within group 1 influenza subtypes were similarly distributed in vaccinated and not vaccinated pts (A 11% vs 16%, B 67% vs 63%, A (H1N1) 22% vs 21%). Pts. with subtype B infection had higher levels of T-(482 vs 274/ \u03bcl) and B-cells (232 vs 108/ \u03bcl) and a longer follow up from SCT (1610 vs 470 days) compared to subtype A / A (H1N1) infection but differences were not significant.",

However, recovery of adaptive immunity is impaired in these patients. Thus, in order to accelerate immune reconstitution, we developed a novel approach based on post-transplant infusion of a titrated number of donor T cells, transduced with the suicide gene inducible-Caspase-9, iC9 (BPX-501 cells, Sponsor Bellicum Pharmaceuticals\u00ae; NCT02065869). We previously reported on immune recovery of 108 children transplanted at our institution, showing that BPX-501 cells infused after \u03b1\u03b2 T-cell-depleted haplo-HSCT expand in-vivo and persist over time, contributing to fasten adaptive immunity recovery (Merli, ASH2017). Here, we report the results of lymphoproliferation assay to viral-encoded antigens to assess Tcell function in patients transplanted with this approach. Methods: We evaluated 142 children, 78 male and 64 female. Median age at transplant was 5.7 years (range 0. [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] . Patients had either malignant (69 children) and nonmalignant (73) disorders. No patient was given any posttransplant graft-versus-host disease prophylaxis. Nine children were enrolled in the phase I portion of the trial consisting of 3 cohorts receiving escalating doses of BPX-501 cells. The remaining 133 patients (phase II portion) received the recommended dose of 1x10 6 BPX-501 cells/kg identified in phase I. BPX-501 cells were infused at a median of 17 days post-HSCT (range 10-82). Antigendriven activation of peripheral mononuclear cells was evaluated by lymphoproliferation assay with 3 H-thymidine pulsing at d+4 and harvesting at d+5. Stimuli included PHA or CMV, EBV and AdV whole viral lysate. Results are given as stimulation indexes (SI, cpm stimulated sample/cpm unstimulated control). Thresholds for positive response were arbitrarily set at SI>3 for viral-encoded antigens and at SI>5 for mitogenic stimulation with PHA. Fractions of responders are indicated in the figure.",

PET use has reduced the risk of CMV end-organ disease (EOD) and associated mortality; However, PET use may lead to substantial antiviral use and healthcare resource utilization. Limited real-world data are available on the outcomes of PET. Therefore, we aimed to examine CMV outcomes (EOD, resistance), CMV-related mortality by Day (D)180 and healthcare resource utilization between PET and No-PET groups among CMV R+ recipients undergoing first HCT.",

Data was extracted from electronic medical records and HCT databases. CMV+ recipients were monitored weekly by quantitative PCR assay starting on D14 through D180 post HCT. Use of antiviral therapy for CMV viremia defined PET. High CMV risk (HR) comprised T-cell depleted (TCD) HCT by CD34+-selection regardless of donor HLA match or conventional HCT from mismatched or haploidentical donors; Low risk (LR) included conventional HCT from matched related donors. CMV EOD was scored by standard criteria. CMV resistance mutations were confirmed by sequencing (Viracor-Eurofins). Length of stay (LOS) for HCT admissions and readmissions were identified through D180. Stratified analyses were performed to examine outcomes by PET use and CMV risk. Background: In a Phase III randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of CMV-seropositive post-HSCT recipients, letermovir prophylaxis significantly reduced the incidence of clinically significant CMV infection through week 24. The objective of this research was to assess the impact of CMV prophylaxis on rates of rehospitalization in adult CMV seropositive allogeneic HSCT recipients from the letermovir phase 3 clinical trial.",

Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infects more than 90% of Chinese population, and its reactivation after HSCT is one of the major concerns due to the increased risk of EBV diseases and post-transplant lymphoproliferative disease. With the development of infection prophylaxis and supportive care after HSCT, demographic data on EBV reactivation post-HSCT needs to be updated. Methods: We retrospectively analyzed the data of patients who received allo-HSCT between July 2011 and July 2014 in the First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University. Quantitative PCR (Q-PCR) was used to monitor EBV-DNA load in peripheral blood dynamically. Ganciclovir (pre-HSCT) followed by acyclovir was given as viral prophylaxis. The treatment protocol for EBV reactivation consisted of tapering of immunosuppressive agents, antiviral agents (including ganciclovir and sodium phosphonatel), and rituximab for persistent positive patients. Results: Totally 890 cases from most of the provinces in China were enrolled (characterized in Table 1 ), among whom EBV reactivation developed in 175 recipients. Most reactivation events (95.4%) occurred in the first year post-HSCT, with a peak of 113.8 incidence rates per 100 personyears at the second month. Besides, more episodes of lateonset reactivation occurred in patients receiving grafts from haploidientical donors ( Figure 1A ) . Multivariate analyses revealed that the major impactors of EBV reactivation included ATG as GVHD prophylaxis (p< 0.001), HLAmismatched donor (p=0.001) and the appearance of chornic GVHD (p=0.042). Cumulative incidence of EBV reactivation was low (2.9%) among 890 patients with no major risk factors, but increased to 11.7%, 27.3% or 41.9% with 1, 2, and 3 major risk factors, respectively ( Figure 1B) . There was no statistical difference of overall survival between people with or without EBV reactivation (p=0.871).",

The association between BKV viruria and a higher mortality is in contrast with previous observations, and the lack for association with GvHD and relapse could suggest BKV is a surrogate for poor immune recovery and therefore other causes of non-relapse mortality.

Background: Infectious complications caused by endogenous adenovirus (AdV) are common and associated with morbidity and mortality rates in patients after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). AdV infections occur in about 3% to 20% of HSCT recipients, with significantly higher rates in pediatric patients. A better understanding of adenoviral-specific T-cells (AdvT) response in donors can serve as a basis to develop more effective strategies for antiviral therapy.",

All donors were divided into 3 groups according to the number of spots per well (SPW) as follows: high responders (HR) (\u226550 spots; n=32), low responders (LR) (>10 and < 50 spots; n=39), nonresponders (NR) (\u226410 spots; n=9). The average spot area of AdV-and CMV-specific lymphocytes was calculated by ImmunoSpot\u00ae MultiPlate AutoCount\u2122. CD45RA+ and CD45RO+ T-cells were generated by immunomagnetic negative selection. HLA typing for class I and II was performed by Sequence Specific Oligonucleotides technology.

Antiviral activity may depend not only on the amount of AdvT but also on their ability to produce IFN\u03b3. The average spot area for AdvT did not differ between HR, LR and NR groups and were 22,4, 23,1 and 19,1 mm 2 respectively. The median of the average spot area for anti-CMV T-lymphocytes was equal to 13,5 mm 2 . Thus, the frequency of AdvT was lower than CMV-specific T-cells, but AdvT have the ability to produce more IFN\u03b3 per cell (p< 0.0001). In order to evaluate the distribution of the AdvT between naive and memory T cell compartments, we evaluated response to AdV in preselected CD45RA+ and CD45RO+ fractions of T-cells in a group of 17 donors. The median frequency of AdvT in unfractionated MNC was 87; the median frequency of AdvT in CD45RA and CD45RO fractions were 2 and 73, respectively. The amounts of CD45RA and CD45RO Tcells were normalized to their amounts in MNC. We evaluated the impact of HLA-alleles on the anti-AdV response of T-cells in different groups and found 2 association: HLA-A*1 with HR group (P-value=0,0043; RR=1,954; 95% CI: 1,285 to 2,604) and HLA-A*31 with LR group 0251; RR=1, 889; 95% CI: 1, 135 to 4, 426) .",

We previously reported that the incidences of total and refractory CMV reactivation reached approximately 90% and 50% after haploidentical HSCT. While majority of studies in the literatures focused on the adaptive CD8 + \u03b1\u03b2 T cellsand NK cells in anti-CMV immunity, increasing evidences highlighted the important role of \u03b3\u03b4T cells in this context. A progressive and prolonged expansion of V\u03b41 + T cells in response to CMV reactivation was observed after alloHSCT. The effect of V\u03b41 + T cells associated with CMV clearance has been reported in vitro and in vivo.

The gold standard for diagnosis and the main criterion for SIBO is the detection in the jejunum aspirate >10 5 /ml bacteria and/or the appearance of colonlike microbiota in small intestine. It is also acceptable to use an alternative non-invasive technique -hydrogen breath test, which could be especially important in patients with severe mucositis, grade III-IV and thrombocytopenia grade IV. SIBO diagnosis in the setting of the gastrointestinal tract damage and dysfunction in patients treated with allo-HSCT is insufficiently studied. Methods: The study included 7 patients with acute myeloid leukemia (n=3), acute lymphoblastic leukemia (n=1), myelodysplastic syndrome (n=1), non-Hodgkin\u00b4s lymphoma (n=1), Hurler syndrome (n=1), who underwent allo-HSCT from an unrelated (n=4) and haploidentical donor (n=3) , and which were complicated by enteropathy development. In 2 cases, the enteropathy reason was a combination of intestinal GvHD and viral colitis (HHV-6), in 5 cases -viral colitis (HHV-6).

Cumulative incidence of relapse or progression of IA after allo-HSCT was 18,2% with the median 49 day after HSCT, which were successfully treated with voriconazole in post HSCT period. Incidence of IFD after allo-HSCT for na\u00efve patients was 17,6% (n=13/74). Etiology of IFD after allo-HSCT was IA -69%, invasive candidiasis (IC) -15%, mucormycosis -8% and 8% combined IFD caused by Aspergillus fumigatus + Rhizopus stolonifer. The median day of onset of IFD after allo-HSCT was day+ 114 and was associated with post-HSCT relapse of HL (p=0,04). The main site of infection were lungs (88%), the main clinical symptom -febrile fever (100%). Antifungal therapy was used in all patients: voriconazole -59%, micafungin -17%, posaconazole -8%, lipid amphotericin B -8% and combination lipid amphotericin B with caspofungin -8%. Overall survival (OS) at 12 weeks from the diagnosis of IFD after allo-HSCT was 80%. The 2-year OS in children and adult with HL after allo-HSCT was 73,3%. Development of IFD after allo-HSCT do not decrease the 2-year OS rate (69,2% vs 74%, p=0,77). The impact of prior IFD on 2-year OS in allo-HSCT recipients was not statistically significant in all group (63,6% vs 74,7%, p=0,47) , and separately in children and adults.",

Our data suggest that donor-recipient CMV positive serostatus, haploidentical Donor, and use of TBI based conditioning necessitate close attention and surveillance. Background: Toxoplasmosis is a rare and underestimated complication following allogeneic stem cell transplantation (allo-SCT) with an often fatal course. This is in part due to limited diagnostics relying mainly on imaging and detection of parasite DNA by PCR. We present here eleven cases of Toxoplasma disease following allo-SCT. Methods: We retrospectively analyzed 534 consecutive adult patients who received an allo-SCT in our Bone Marrow Transplant Unit between July 2008 and July 2018. Eleven (2%) of these patients were diagnosed of Toxoplasma disease. The main characteristics of the patients are shown in table 1. All patients, except two cord blood, have received peripheral blood stem cells. Fludarabine-based conditioning regimes were used in all patients. Only the two cord blood patients received Thymoglobulin in the conditioning. Graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis consisted on tacrolimus plus mycophenolate mofetil in 5 (46%) patients and post-transplant cyclophosphamide followed by tacrolimus in 4 (36%). Before the allo-SCT was performed the IgG/IgM Toxoplasma serology of the recipient and donor. We reviewed the absolute lymphocyte count (ALC) and CD4 + lymphocyte count within four weeks prior to the diagnosis of toxoplasmosis, and if the patients took effective primary prophylaxis for this parasite. Toxoplasma disease was defined as the presence of Toxoplasma infection plus clinical, radiological or pathological evidence. Toxoplasma disease was considered the main cause of death when no other major life-threatening infection or other potential fatal complication occurred immediately before death.",

Toxoplasma serology pretransplant was positive (IgG+/IgM-) in ten of the eleven patients. All donors were seronegative (IgG-/IgM-) except two. Toxoplasmosis was diagnosed a median (range) of 85 days (35-330) post allo-STC.

The median follow-up period for survivors was 3.2 years (range: 0.8-9.6 years). There were 128 patients with acute myeloid leukemia, 64 with acute lymphoblastic leukemia, 32 with myelodysplastic syndromes, and 22 with other diseases. At transplantation, 166 patients were standard risk and 80 were high risk. Myeloablative conditioning and reduced-intensity conditioning were employed in 99 and 147 patients, respectively. Bone marrow transplantation, peripheral blood stem cell transplantation, and cord blood transplantation was performed in 98, 36, and 112 patients, respectively. CMV reactivation occurred in 141 patients (57%) at a median of 45 days (range: 15-93 days) after SCT. Grade II-IV acute GVHD and chronic GVHD affected 89 patients (36%) and 80 patients (33%), respectively. Among all patients, 5-year overall survival (OS), cumulative nonrelapse mortality (NRM), and cumulative relapse (CIR) rates were 66%, 10%, and 33%, respectively. In patients without CMV reactivation (CMVR-) versus patients with CMV reactivation (CMVR+), 5-year OS, NRM, and CIR were 79% vs. 55% (p < 0.001), 3% vs. 16% (p = 0.005), and 27% vs. 38% (p = 0.142), respectively. Among all patients, the median level of CD3-CD56+ cells, CD16 +CD57cells, and CD16+CD57+ cells on day 100 was 236/\u03bcl (range: 19-2150/\u03bcl), 275/\u03bcl (9-2660/\u03bcl), and 98/\u03bcl (3-1767/\u03bcl), respectively. NK cell subsets showed no significant differences between CMVR-and CMVR+ patients. When patients were divided into low and high groups at the median level of each NK cell subset, CMVR+ patients with high CD3-CD56+, CD16+CD57-, or CD16+CD57+ cells showed significantly better 5-year OS than those with low cells (72% vs. 35%, p < 0.001; 69% vs. 40%, p < 0.001; 66% vs. 45%, p = 0.001, respectively). High CD3-CD56+ cells were significantly associated with lower NRM (7% vs. 26%, p = 0.002), while high CD16+CD57-cells were significantly associated with lower CIR (26% vs. 50%, p = 0.007).

All 7 patients with invasive S. maltophilia infection before pathogen identification demonstrated persistent fever despite of the use of broadspectrum antibiotics (carbapenems, glycopeptides, aminoglycosides, colistin), prophylactic antifungals and antivirals.

Cidofovir was diluted in 100 mL of normal saline and installed via a Foley catheter which was blocked for 1 hour. Not knowing the level of absorption of the drug we decided to give probenecid prophylaxis in all patients. ICI was repeated weekly according to severity of symptoms. Urine and plasma BKV viral loads were quantified by RQ-PCR Results: Six patients (median 38 years, 29-51) received ICI after allo-HCT. Patients had haematological malignancies (AML 2, ALL 3, MDS 1), received busilfex-based myeloablative conditioning and a graft (PBSC 5, BM 1) from a 7/8 HLA-matched (4pts), 8/8 (1pt) or haploidentical (1pt) donor. Median time for the onset of BKV-HC after allo-HCT were 53.5 days (range 32-117). All patients were under standard cyclosporine prophylaxis and none of the patients had any signs of acute GvHD at the time of onset of HC. The median PCR-BKV viral load at the onset of BKV-HC in urine and plasma were 5.75x10 8 (range 0.15x10 8 -59x10 8 ) and 141.5 (range 0-255), respectively. The median maximum PCR-BKV viral load in urine and plasma were 37.5x10 8 (range 4.7x10 8 -450x10 8 ) and 1.100 (range 0-400.000), respectively. Five patients had impaired renal function (median eGFR 49 ml/min, range 33-53) at first ICI which was probably multifactorial. The median dose of intravesical cidofovir was 5 mg/kg (range 2.5-5 mg/kg) and a median number of 3.5 instillations (range 2-7) were given. In 5/6 cases symptoms of cystitis improved dramatically and hematuria resolved. Virological response (at least 1 log reduction) was observed in all 5 cases. Two patients experienced relapse of hemorrhagic cystitis and were retreated with ICI which resulted in resolution of the symptoms and the hematuria. No deterioration of renal function of other systemic adverse effects were observed. After a median follow up of 190.5 days after transplantation (range 105-360), 3/6 patients are alive without cystitis symptomatology and 3 died (1 due to relapse and 2 due to TRM).",

However, resolution of adenoviraemia is influenced by many other factors, including the adequacy of immune reconstitution, the degree of induced immune suppression and the presence of comorbidities such as GVHD. Due to the small sample size it was difficult to assess the relative importance of these factors in this cohort. Brincidofovir was well tolerated however its effectiveness may have been limited by poor gastrointestinal function in one patient (Patient 3) and could not be used after a viral reactivation in another for the same reason. Further studies of the use of brincidofovir in this specific cohort are needed to clarify the role and effectiveness of this treatment. Background: There is a high prevalence of CMV seropositivity in Algerian population. Because of high morbidity and mortality in pts who underwent allo SCT with CMV reactivation, effective surveillance and timely treatment using anti-viral therapy s required. The risk of CMV reactivation depends on the type of stem cell source, immunosuppression (IS) and serological status of the donor/ recipient pair. Methods: over a 24 months period (from 01/01/2016 to 31/12/2017), 254 pts underwent allo-HSCT for malignant or non-malignant hematology diseases of which 246 pts are evaluated for this study. CMV reactivation was observed in 66 pts (26.82%) (AML: 33 pts, ALL: 8 pts, CML: 4 pts, multiple Myeloma: 2 pt, NHL skin: 1 pt, primary myelofibrosis: 1 pt, Aplastic anemia: 14 pts, Fanconi anemia: 2 pts, \u03b2-thalassemia: 1 pt), with a median age of 30 years (4-54), sex ratio (M/F) of 1.75. Allo-HSCT done with sibling donors: 51 pts, Haplo-identical donors: 14 pts and Pheno-identical donor: 1 pt. All pts were treated by chemotherapy alone with my\u00e9loablative conditioning (MAC) in 41 pts and reduced intensity (RIC) in 25 pts. All pts received peripheral blood stem cells with an average rate of CD34 + cells: 7, 8.10 6 /kg (3.4-12.7). Additional bone marrow graft was used in 7 pts that received a haploidentical graft without PT-cy. GVH prophylaxis associated cyclosporine (cSA) and methotrexate (sibling and phenoidentical); cSA-MTX-MMF or cSA-MTX-Cyclophosphamid (haplo-identical). Before transplantation, donor/recipient pair is at high risk reactivation in 65 pts (98.4%). Detection of CMV reactivation done by Antigenaemia pp65 or by quantitative PCR weekly for the first 3 months and during an IS treatment for acute or chronic GVHD. Pre-emptive therapy is initiated by Ganciclovir as soon as positivity of antigenaemia or increased viral load in PCR.",

Its pathogenicity is relatively low in the general population, usually resulting in a selflimiting viral illness. In an immunosuppressed host, infection can lead to life threatening illness. Disseminated CMV infection can manifest in a number of organs and is diagnosed using internationally accepted criteria. In the post solid organ and stem cell transplant (SCT) setting, it is postulated that it is viral reactivation, rather than primary reinfection that leads to CMV viraemia. Prevention of reactivation requires the presence of a competent immune system, mediated by T-cells. This accounts for the increased incidence in intensive and T-cell depleting SCT conditioning regimens. Despite improved outcomes following the introduction of CMV monitoring by PCR and pre-emptive treatments (current UK guidance), CMV pneumonitis still carries a high mortality. The use of CMV specific immunoglobulins (CMVIG) for the treatment of this complication is generally not recommended post chemotherapy or SCT in haematological cancers due to lack of evidence. However, CMVIGs are widely used in the setting of CMV reactivation post solid organ transplants. We report the use of CMVIG in patients with suspected CMV pneumonitis at a single UK centre. The aims of this retrospective study were to establish safety and review efficacy in this highly immunocompromised group of patients.",

Initial treatment was with liposomal amphotericin B 5mg/kg/day followed by dose escalation to 10mg/kg/day due to the development of new skin lesions. The patient had been taking posaconazole (tablet) prophylaxis since his first allogeneic transplant and peripheral blood drug levels checked at the time of admission were therapeutic confirming that this was a breakthrough fungal infection. Consequently posaconazole was stopped and isavuconazole added to the treatment regimen. Surgical assessment was undertaken but surgery was deferred on the basis of high risk due to the extent of the infection and the patient\u00b4s profound pancytopenia.",

Isavuconazole was therefore stopped and the patient was managed with liposomal amphotericin B along with daily granulocyte infusions. He underwent a third allogeneic transplant using a different unrelated donor and stable engraftment was achieved. Post transplant there was initially an increase in the size of the para-stomal lesion, but no new skin lesions developed. Following engraftment he underwent resection of the stomal lesion, with primary closure and re-siting of his stoma. Amphotericin B was replaced by isavuconazole prophylaxis on discharge and he continues to make an excellent recovery.",

            "text": "Conclusions: Whilst Aspergillus species remain the most common cause of invasive fungal infections in allogeneic transplant patients, other species including the Mucorales are seen, and generally associated with poorer outcomes. Whilst there are standardised methodologies for susceptibility testing, fungi specific cut offs based on clinical outcomes are only available for a limited number of species/ antifungal agents. In this case, susceptibility testing demonstrated resistance to posaconazole which was consistent with the clinical presentation of invasive infection despite therapeutic levels of posaconazole. It is also worth noting that an estimated 45% of R. oryzae isolates in the UK are resistant to posaconazole. Treatment with high dose Amphotericin B resulted in improvement in small skin lesions with stabilisation of the larger stomal lesion until count recovery allowed surgical resection. Background: Total depletion of innate and adaptive immune cell populations occurs after intensive chemotherapy and hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). Both T and B lymphocyte pools are restored slower that myelomonocytic populations. HSCT patients are at high risk for bacterial and viral infections at early terms (< 100 days) post-transplant. The reconstitution of the immune system depends on the time required for stem cell recruitment, differentiation, expansion, maturation and release into the bloodstream. Restoration terms for myeloid cells after HSCT are usually defined as the 1st day with neutrophil count of \u2265 0.5 x 10^9/L with mean recovery terms of 12 to 20 days. High occurrence of cytomegalovirus (CMV) in HSCT patients mostly result from reactivation of a latent virus acquired in early childhood. However, delayed immune reconstitution and subsequent infections such as CMV, adenovirus (ADV) or Herpes 6 (HHV-6) diseases are not unusual and still constitute a major cause of death in Peru.",

Moreover, almost all patients have now available donor, better graft-versus-host disease prophylaxis will decrease TRM and morbidity, and new therapies will make more patients in sensitive disease before allo-SCT.

G-CSF administration after ASCT is a common practice, performed to reduce the duration of neutropenia and its complications. In a previous work in patients with multiple myeloma managed at home after ASCT, we did not observe a deleterious clinical impact in those patients that did not receive G-CSF post-transplant (Martinez-Cibrian N. et al, BMT 2016) . Despite the fact that lymphoma patients receive a more intensive conditioning regimen that multiple myeloma patients, we hypothesized that the use of G-CSF in lymphoma patients managed at home during the aplasia phase of ASCT does not provide a significant clinical benefit. Methods: 93 lymphoma patients were managed at-home since day +1 of ASCT. Between February 2010 and July 2016, 68 patients received at-home G-CSF 5 \u03bcg/kg per day since day +7 until their ANC reached 1x10 9 /L (G-CSF group) and, since August 2016, 25 patients did not receive G-CSF (non-G-CSF group). All patients were conditioned with BEAM and received prophylaxis with a quinolone, fluconazole, aerosolized pentamidine and low-dose acyclovir (HVS+). In all cases we added primary prophylaxis with piperacillin-tazobactam 4.5 g/8h i.v., using a portable intermittent infusion pump (IIP), from an absolute neutrophil count (ANC) < 0.5x10 9 /L until the first day of fever or until attaining an ANC of 1x10 9 /L. First-line therapy at home of neutropenic fever (NF) was refrigerated meropenem 1 g/8h i.v using a portable IIP. Fever was an indication of immediate visit to the hospital, and those patients presenting with focal infection or signs of severe sepsis were admitted. Other indications for readmission were: willingness of the patient or caregiver; uncontrolled nausea, vomiting or diarrhea and mucositis requiring total parenteral nutrition or i.v. morphics.",

While our center and others utilize routine surveillance imaging post-transplant, the utility in this setting is unclear. Imaging is costly and exposes patients to radiation. Novel interventions are now available for patients relapsing after auto-HCT making early disease recognition crucial to intervene prior to clinical progression. Hence, we studied impact of post-auto-HCT surveillance (18)F-FDG-PET CT at day 100 on transplant outcomes. Methods: We analyzed a cohort of 131 consecutive auto-HCT recipients with relapsed/refractory DLBCL who then underwent pre-transplant PET/CT and surveillance PET CT at day 100 (Interquartile range (IQR): 97-103 days) post-HCT at the University of Minnesota Medical Center. Univariate analysis was performed to analyze PET parameters including Deauville score (D), standardized uptake values (SUV), total lesion glycolysis (TLG) and total metabolic tumor volume (TMTV) as predictors of relapse and survival after auto-HCT.

The median age was 49 years (range 18-75). Out of these, 2078 (78%) were patients with non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL), 569 (21%) with Hodgkin lymphoma (HL). The NHL group comprised of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL, 36%), follicular lymphoma (FL, 18%), mantle cell lymphoma (MCL, 16%) and T-NHL (9%). The frequency of ASCT in lymphomas increased from 1993 to 2000 and has been constant since 2000 (120-130 transplants per year). Differences in frequency of ASCT were observed among lymphoma subtypes -decreasing numbers of DLBCL and FL and increasing numbers of T-NHL and MCL, with ASCT as part of the induction therapy. Between 1996 and 2016 a total of 329 allogeneic HSCT (alloSCT) were performed in 319 patients (200 men, 63%). Median age was 46 years (range 19-66). Out of these 257 (81%) were patients with NHL, 61 (18%) HL. The most common NHL subtypes were FL (27%), MCL (22%), T-NHL (22%) and DLBCL (16%). In the last 10 years the number of alloSCT for lymphoma is fluctuating around 20 per year. The median age at ASCT was significantly higher in the years 2010-2016 vs 1993-2000 [54.5 (18.1-74.8) vs. 40.9 (18.6-72.5), p < 0.0001, fig 1] , while the increase at alloSCT [46.5 (21.3-65.5) vs 41.6(20.3-64.5)] did not reach statistical significance (p=0.07). With median follow up for alloSCT, 5 y probability OS for patient transplanted in the later period 2010-2016 was in relapsed DLBCL 25.7%, in FL 77.4%, in HL 51.0% and in MCL 45.7%, 5 y OS for ASCT as part of first line therapy in the same period was in MCL 78.1 % and in T-NHL 48.2%. OS was significantly better in all patients who underwent ASCT in the years 2010-2016 vs 1993-2000 (70.% vs. 57 .5%, p < 0.0001) and there was a trend towards better OS in patients after alloSCT (with 44.7% vs 23.5%, p=0.1084) (fig 2) .",

However, the proper time for irradiation treatment remains controversial. Adjuvant IFRT (adj-IFRT) in pre-ASCT period could cause undesirable toxicity which might delays or even cancel the ASCT resulting in increased risk of relapse, or could affect the marrow environmental and marrow niche resulting thus in impaired engraftment. On the other hand, the ajd-IFTR in the early post-ASCT period, upon marrow recovery, offers a potential advantage by delivering irradiation after sufficient disease response, without affecting the engraftment. In this retrospective study we evaluated the safety and efficacy of the IFRT as adjuvant treatment in patients who had previously treated with ASCT for relapsed or refractory lymphomas. Methods: Twenty-three patients (Hodgkin=14, Non-Hodgkin=9), aged of 34(16-76) years, underwent ASCT, for primary refractory (n=15) or relapsed (n=8) disease. Patients who had bulky disease at the time of relapse or those with residual mass post salvage treatment, were considered as candidates for adj-IFRT, early (within 2-3 months) after documentation of autologous stem cells engraftment. All patients proceeded to ASCT with chemosensitive disease after a median of 2 lines of salvage therapy. At the time of ASCT 20 patients (80%) had residual disease while 4(20%) evaluated to be in complete remission. The preparative regimens were: single-agent Melphalan (n=9), Busulfan-Etoposide-Melphalan (n=7), BEAM (n=5) and Bendamustin-Etoposide-Cytarabine-Melphalan (n=3). Filgrastim was given till neutrophills recovery, while prophylaxis against bacteria, fungus, viruses and PCP were administered till the completion of adj-IFRT.",

Ten patients received radiotherapy in the mediastinum, 9 in the abdomen/pelvis/ inguinal area 3 in the neck, and 1 in the left leg. The adj-IFRT was well tolerated. No patient experienced toxicity grade >3 and none required hospitalization.

Post-transplant treatment occurred in the context of relapsed/refractory disease in 27 patients; 12 (40%) had an allogeneic stem cell transplant. Among them, 6 had additional chemotherapy and 2 nivolumab, gaining a complete metabolic response. In the 15 rest of patients, change of treatment due to eventual BV failure occurred. BV was administered as a maintenance treatment in 10 patients. In six of them BV had already been administered pre-transplant as well. Out of maintenance treatment patients, 2 relapsed and subsequently received nivolumab. Two patients died due to prior chemotherapy complications, whereas 13 are currently on nivolumab treatment. PET-based response was available in 6 patients, 4 having a complete metabolic response (CMR) and 2 a partial metabolic response. Stable disease was achieved by CTbased response in the rest patients. No major toxicities were observed. One patient presented with grade 2 asymptomatic hypothyroidism and one with grade 3 anemia attributed to non-inflammatory upper gastrointestinal blood loss.",

Compared with the Western variant, where skin involvement was common, the Asian variant was reported to involve more frequently the liver, spleen and bone marrow, and hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis is more common in Asian variant. Diagnosis of IVLBL is still difficult because of the lack of overt lymphadenopathy and peripheral blood involvement. Thus, timely diagnosis and immediate treatment remain as a challenge to improve outcomes for patients with the Asian variant. Therefore, we analyzed the clinical features and treatment outcomes of patients with the Asian variant of IVLBCL.

At the end of treatment, 31 patients achieved a complete response (CR), whereas eight patients showed progression. Six patients died after the first or second cycle of R-CHOP, and the causes of death were treatment-related adverse events including cytopenia, infectious complications, and pulmonary hemorrhage. Upfront ASCT was done for two patients including one patient with CNS involvement at diagnosis, and these patients were still alive at the time of analysis without evidence of relapse. On the other hand, the outcome of six patients undergoing salvage ASCT after relapse was poor; thus, only one patient was alive. Likewise, patients with disease progression at the end of treatment with R-CHOP showed dismal prognoses even after salvage chemotherapy except for one.

In this study, we aimed to compare the survival rates of lymphoma patients older than 60 years of age and patients aged 50-60 who had undergone allogeneic transplantation in our center. Methods: We collected the data of lymphoma patients older than 50 years of age who had undergone allogeneic transplantation in our center and analyzed the results by grouping them into 2, namely the ones between 50-60 years of age and the ones over 60 years of age.",

The characteristics of the patients are summarized in Table  1 . Patients' comorbidity indexes were calculated with Augmented HCT-CI which includes patients' pretransplant ferritin, alb\u00fcmin and thrombocyte counts as a variable. No difference could be found between groups regarding neutrophil and platelet engraftment times and comorbidity indexes. However, acute graft versus rate and documented bacterial infection rate during the hospitalization period were higher in the 50-60 years age group (p=0,01). 100 day mortality rate and non-relapse mortality rate were not different between groups. More importantly, Progression free survival(PFS) and overall survival(OS) of patients in the 50-60 years age group and over 60 years of age group were not different (p=0,45) (Figure 1) Conclusions: In the present study, although the number of patients is low, we showed that lymphoma patients over 60 years of age have similar outcomes and transplant related toxicity as the patients between 50 to 60 years of age. PFS and OS were very close in this study. We think that this may be due to low relapse rate in the patients and high mortality rate in relapsing patients. In conclusion, allogeneic stem cell transplantation which has a curative potential may be employed in transplant eligible elderly lymphoma patients Disclosure: Nothing to declare Background: Follicular Lymphoma (FL) histologic transformation consist on the development of an aggressive lymphoma, usually a diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL). Histological transformation has been considered to have poor prognosis. In pre-rituximab era median OS ranged between 1 and 2 years, however, in recent series of patients treated with chemotherapy plus rituximab, the outcome of transformed FL has improved, especially in those that receive Autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT), who reach 5-year OS up to 75% in some series. Methods: We have retrospectively studied 19 consecutive patients undergoing ASCT for transformed FL between 2006 and 2015 in a tertiary center in the Basque Country, Spain. Patients were considered to have a transformed FL if they were diagnosed of a DLBCL and they have previous history of FL or histological evidence of a FL in another location.",

Relapse was observed in 31 pts (22.6%) and it was earlier relapse in a period of 24 months in 15 pts (48%). Deaths were among 39/150 pts (26%). Persistent CR was achieved in 112/137 pts (81,8%) including 23/30 (76,6%) MLCL and 89/107 (83,1%) others DLBCL. The overall survival (OS) and event free survival (EFS) at 10 years are respectively 68% and 64%. The OS and EFS are better in patients who received Rituximab in initial therapy : OS (79% vs 54%; p< 0,001) et EFS (79% vs 46%; p< 0,001). Herein, we present one patient with refractory MCL, who were insensitive to chemotherapy and then experienced a dramatic improvement with ibrutinib mono-therapy but later developed ibrutinib resistance,ultimately resulting in the deterioration of disease and death. Methods: We give the patient several examinations including Ultrasound, bone marrow biopsy, lymph node biopsy, Exome Sequencing, Sanger sequencing, and so on. For the treatment of lymphoma, the patient received chemotherapy, including 1 course of CHOP(cyclophosphamide 1.3g day 1, doxorubicin 40mg day 1,Vinorelbine 40mg day 1, and dexamethasone 15mg from day 1 to 5) and 1 course of R-DHAP (rituximab 600mg day0, cytarabine 2g q12 day 1, Cisplatin 100mg day 1,dexamethasone 20mg from day 1 to 5)in succession.Because of the failure to control disease progression, ibrutinib 560mg qd was used until the patient died.",

Then he received ibrutinib mono-therapy, and experienced a dramatic improvement as his body temperature was controlled, his hemogram became normal and his spleen and lymph node tapered.After about 6 months response of ibrutinib, the disease deteriorated rapidly and he died very soon. Exome sequencing from the patient peripheral blood at this time detected one missense mutation in exon 5 of TP53 at nucleotide 524G>A, resulting in an Argnine to Histidine change at amino acid 175 (p.Arg175His).

Background: An adequate immune reconstitution (IR) is crucial to reduce transplant toxicity, relapse rate and mortality after allogeneic stem cell transplantation (alloHSCT). The aim of this, single center retrospective study was to investigate the correlation between the recovery of different lymphocyte subpopulations with the main transplant outcomes, including overall survival (OS), disease free survival (DFS) and non-relapse mortality (NRM).",

When analysing cfDNA from transplanted patients and in the control group we could not detect DNA fragments larger than 400 bp and the size range of the analysed fragments was between 80 and 200 bp. In 41 out of 110 patients a mixture of donor and recipient cfDNA (MC) was detected. With the exception of three patients relapsing after transplant in which MC was detected both in peripheral blood and plasma in the rest of the patients (n=38) MC was detected only in plasma. The mean percentage of recipient cfDNA in the plasma samples was 18% (range: 1-81%). All the patients with acute GvHD (aGvHD) (grade: I-IV) (n=15) showed MC in plasma at least in one of the time-point tested. No significant difference was found in the mean recipient cfDNA percentage in patients with aGvHD grade I-II when compared with grade III-IV. Meanwhile in the group of patients with chronic GvHD (n=42) MC in plasma was detected in 13 patients.

Through this it may lead to delayed reconstitution of adaptive immunity after TCR \u03b1\u03b2-depletion compared to using PT-Cy. Clinical relevance of the quantitative characteristics of immune recovery in the context of different approaches to GVHD prevention remains to be established. Background: Immune effector cells, belonging to either innate or acquired immunity, play a key role on preventing disease relapse after allogeneic Haematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation (HSCT). Most of known immune effector are CD3 + CD8 + T-cells and CD3 -CD56 + Natural Killer lymphocytes, while CD3 + CD4 + cells act as modulatory and regulatory cells. The early post-HSCT ratio between these cellular subsets may be an indicator of Graft vs-Tumor (GVT) effect. Methods: We retrospectively revised the immune recovery of 117 allogeneic HSCT performed at our Institution from 2013 to 2017, analysed on peripheral blood by multiparametric flow cytometry lymphocyte subpopulations panel. DIagnosis were Acute Leukemias (69%), Chronic Myeloproliferative Neoplasms (10%), Lymphomas (10%), Myelodysplastic Syndromes (5%), Multiple Myeloma (3%) and Severe Aplastic Anemia (3%). We established 2 early time-points of evaluation, 30 and 60 days from the graft infusion, to analyse the differences in disease free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) between patients according to the CD3 + CD8 + x CD3 -CD56 + / CD3 + CD4 + ratio. Results: Median ratio at +60 days was of 0,5667. At this time point, patients who showed the ratio higher than the median had both a better DFS (median DFS time not reached vs 12 months; p = 0,018) ( Figure 1 ) and OS (median OS time not reached vs 13 months; p = 0,014). Likewise, ratio at +30 showed an advantage on DFS (p = 0,027), and not on OS (p = 0,06). Other factors possibly affecting both DFS and OS were analysed in univariate analysis, such as the use of antithymocyte globulin (ATG), conditioning regimen intensity, graft source, HLA-matching and disease status at HSCT, the latter being the only variable with a significantly detrimental impact on both OS and DFS. Disease status was confirmed an independent valriable associated with both DFS and OS as well as +60 ratio both on DFS (Hazard Ratio [HR] -2,721; p = 0,015) and OS (HR 2,627; p = 0,022).",

Impaired recovery of CD4 T-cells may increase the risk of opportunistic infections, decrease the response to vaccination and lead to ineffective anti-tumor response.

We observed lower survival in patients with MRD by MFC pre-transplant (2y OS: 61% (41-81%) vs. 92% (82-100%), p=0.018) due to increased relapse incidence (35% (17-53%) vs. 8% (0-18%), p=0.009). In multivariate analysis, MRD pos prior to allo-SCT has strong significant impact on OS (HR 6.5 (1.5 -30) , p=0.015). Of 55 patients, a sample both before and on day +100 after transplantation was available in 33 patients. Of those 33 patients, 15 (46%) were MRD negative prior to transplant and on day +100 (MRD neg/neg ); 14 (42%) patients were MRD positive prior to transplant and negative at day +100 (MRD pos/neg ); and 4 (12%) patients were MRD positive at both timepoints (MRD pos/pos ). DFS and OS for these three groups were as follow: 2y DFS: MRD neg/neg : 93% (80-100%), MRD pos/neg : 78% (56-100%); MRD pos/pos : 25% (0-75%, p=0.006); 2y OS: MRD neg/neg : 100%; MRD pos/neg : 93% (79-100%); MRD pos/pos : 25% (0-75%, p< 0.001). Upon multivariate analysis, the MRD status prior to transplant and on day +100 showed strong significant impact on DFS (HR 3.6 (1.3 -9.9), p=0.01) and OS ), p=0.017). We did not observe any significant impact of other factors included in the multivariate analysis (patient's age, patient's sex, and recipient/ donor sex constellation).",

It is approved as second line therapy either as single agent therapy or in combination with lenalidomide or bortezomib for the treatment of patients with relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma. Despite the curative potential of an allo-SCT, the high relapse rate remains a clinical problem. Data addressing the choice of an optimal salvage therapy regime for these heavily pre-treated patients is missing. Methods: From April 2016 till November 2018 a total of 22 patients (male, n=10) with the median age of 64 years (40-72) received daratumumab as a salvage therapy for relapse of multiple myeloma after allo-SCT at the University of Hamburg.

The median number of salvage lines post-transplant and prior to first daratumumab infusion was 2 (0-4). These salvage regimens included cyclophosphamide, etoposide, bortezomib, lenalidomide, pomalidomide and carfilzomib. Daratumumab was started at a median of 19 months (0-43) after relapse/ progress and initiated as single agent therapy in all patients. Concomitantly, 14 patients received either an immunomodulatory drug (lenalidomid, n=10; pomalidomid, n=1) or a proteasome inhibitor (bortezomib, n=3) during a later course of daratumumab infusions.

In contrast, FN was observed more frequently in patients with HCT-CI > 2 (38% vs 12%, p=0.05). Grade 1-2 infections were more frequent in older patients (35% vs 5%, p= 0.005), but no difference was found in grade 3-4 infections incidence rate such as pneumonia, uroinfections and neutropenic enterocolitis (25% vs 35%, p=0.52), nor grade 1-2 and 3-4 noninfectious toxicities (50% vs 38%, p=0.31, and 4% vs 21%, p=0.06, respectively) . The median time to granulocyte engraftment was 11 days (range, 9-19 days) in elderly and was comparable with younger patients. The time to platelet recovery was also similar. After the median follow-up of 12 months for survivors, OS at 18 months was 94% in both groups. PFS at 18 moths was 65% for younger patients, and 55% for elderly (p=0.86).However, the association between PFS and the dose of melphalan used in conditioning was observed. PFS probability at 18 months for patients conditioned with the dose of 200 mg/m 2 , 140 mg/m 2 and 100 mg/m 2 was 71%, 58% and 21%, respectively (p=0.012).",

The authors believe that large scale randomized clinical trials are needed for optimal treatment of relapsing multiple myeloma after first auto-SCT.",

One of the key indicators is the content of CD34+ cells in the autograft, which depends on many factors. Some of them are due to previous treatment, others are directly related to the patient: age, stage of the disease, features of the hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) microenvironment. The aim of the study was to assess the influence of the immune response genes on the autograft cellularity in patients with MM. Methods: \u0410 retrospective analysis of the genotyping results was performed.

The second group consisted of 13 patients examined with the number of CD34 + cells in the autograft \u22642\u00d710 6 /kg of the patient's body weight. Comparing the identified haplotypes of the immune response genes with the cellularity of the transplantation material, it was found that the presence of the mutant allele in the homo-and heterozygous haplotypes of the IL1\u03b2 gene (T-511C) increased the chances of harvesting cellular material with a higher content of CD34+ cells in 4 times (\u03c72=5.04, p=0.02), and the carriage of the wild type allele in the homo-and heterozygous state of the TLR2 (Arg753Gln) gene is more than in 15 times (\u03c72=5.06, p=0.02). Currently, it has been shown that single nucleotide or amino acid substitutions in genes can lead to changes in the expression pattern of their final products: increased secretion of interleukin 1\u03b2 (IL-1\u03b2) or changes in the spatial configuration and functionality of the receptors (TLR2). Thus, in the presence of mutations in the IL1\u03b2 gene, the enhanced synthesis of IL-1\u03b2 influences on fibroblasts, immunocompetent, endothelial, epithelial and other cells, by activating hemopoiesis. In turn, the mutational status of the Arg753Gln locus located within the TIR domain of the TLR2 receptor in the cytosol, determines the spatial configuration of the TLR2 acting as a co-stimulatory receptor of CD4+ cells, which ensure the engraftment of the graft.",

Nearly all are performed with peripheral blood progenitor cells (PBPC), and Melphalan 200 mg/m2 is considered the gold standard conditioning regimen. The standard procedure consists in obtaining progenitors, cryopreserved with Dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and stored and subsequently thawed and re-infused in the patient on day 0. The procedure of cryopreservation is expensive and has some inherent toxicities (DMSO) and loss of cells during the procedure. Several groups have used non-cryopreserved progenitors showing some benefits compared with cryopreserved transplants, mainly a faster engraftment and a shorter length of hospitalization. Objective: To compare noncryopreserved vs cryopreserved auto-HSCT in MM Methods: We perform an unicentric, retrospective study on 23 consecutive first auto-HSCT MM patients transplanted with PBPC between Nov-2011 and Oct-2018, and conditioned with high dose melphalan (200 mg/m2). The median follow-up was 1620 days (range: 44-2413). 9 patients received non-cryopreserved and 14 cryopreserved auto-HSCT. Patients characteristics, without differences between non-cryopreserved vs cryopreserved: women/men (15/8); median age was 65 years (range 49-72); in the majority auto-HSCT was done as consolidation after first line therapy (78%); year of transplant \u22642014 (61%), \u22652015 (39%). The number of infused CD34 cells were not different: median 3.5 x10 /kg (range 1.7-11.5) in noncryopreserved patients and 3.75 x10 /kg (range 2.1-17) in cryopreserved patients.",

It is toxic to both cells and patients at temperatures above 0 o C. Reduction of this effect is achieved by either washing of cells after thawing or by reduction of DMSO during freezing and storage. The latter requires addition of extracellular cryoprotectants to the freezing media. We assessed the effect of low DMSO concentration and different hematocrits of the frozen cells on cell viability and hematologic recovery in patients, transplanted for multiple myeloma. Methods: Cells were non-programmed frozen and stored at -80 o C in a cryoprotectant solution achieving final concentrations of 5% DMSO, 3.6% of hydroxyethyl starch (HES, Weight average molecular weight 450 000 Da) and 3% of human serum albumin. The cell concentration in the frozen product for the first 77 patients (84 transplantations) varied between 100x10 6 and 250x10 6 cells/ml. In an attempt to reduce the amount of DMSO infused, for the rest of the patients (n=172; 192 transplantations) we further decreased the volume of the freezing suspension by removal of the entire plasma.",

While aiming to reduce disease burden in order to lower the risk of relapse after transplant cytoreductive therapy is associated with several drawbacks. Besides a considerable risk for toxicity and mortality preventing patients to proceed to transplant cytoreductive therapy may also favour the selection of resistant clones which may be difficult to treat at relapse. Methods: To address this hypothesis we retrospectively analysed the response and survival following salvage therapy in 73 patients with MDS and sAML who had relapsed in median 5.6 months (1 to 110 months) after allo-SCT according to their pre-transplant strategy (upfront transplantation n=32 44%; induction chemotherapy [CTX] n=26 36%; hypomethylating agents [HMA] n=15 20%).",

When focussing on those patients treated with HMA and DLI it became apparent that a significantly higher proportion of patients in the upfront group (58%) achieved CR after salvage therapy in comparison to pre-treated patients (10% CR, p=0.0005; CTX group 5% CR; HMA group 18% CR). Accordingly, overall survival (OS) calculated from the time of relapse was significantly longer in patients in the upfront group than in the group of pre-treated patients (2-year OS 59% vs. 19%, p=0.0001).",

We present the case of a 69-year-old woman who was admitted into hospital because of insecure walking. Paresis of both legs, hypaesthesia of the inner thighs, increased effort at urinating, reduced sphincter tonus, central paresis of the right arm and discreet paresis of the right facial nerve were documented at neurological exam. MRI showed a large tumour of the dorsal thorax that immured the adjacent ribs and spine, affected the processus transversus of T9-10 and invaded the spinal canal. The patient had undergone RIC allogeneic stem cell transplantation five years ago for MDS-EB 2 with complex aberrant karyotype. Following an uneventful course and no signs of GvHD, she had been off immunosuppression since 4,5 years. At the time of the admission the patient had slightly lowered WBC (2,9 Gpt/l) and PLT (111 Gpt/l) and clearly increased LDH (793 U/l).",

Unfortunately, the use of T cells redirected against tumor antigens, is severely limited by 1) the difficulty in identifying appropriate cell surface antigens, that could be targeted by CAR T cells and 2) the paucity of tumor-specific T cell receptors (TCRs) against shared, oncogenic antigens. Methods: Focusing on Wilms\u00b4Tumor 1 (WT1), a tumorassociated antigen overexpressed by acute myeloid leukemia and several solid tumors, we designed and implemented an innovative protocol for the rapid isolation of WT1-specific T cells and for the generation and characterization of a library of WT1-specific TCRs displaying different human leukocyte antigen (HLA) restrictions, to be exploited by TCR gene transfer and TCR gene editing. To this aim, we repetitively stimulated T cells with autologous antigen-presenting cells, including immortalized B cells, pulsed with overlapping peptides spanning the entire WT1 protein. T cell recognition was assessed by flow cytometry in terms of CD107a expression and IFN\u03b3 production. Recognized peptides were mapped by a deconvoluting grid and T cell clonotypes were longitudinally tracked by TCR\u03b1\u03b2 sequencing.",

The ability of WT1specific T cells to recognize naturally processed epitopes and their on-target specificity was demonstrated upon coculture with antigen-expressing targets including primary leukemic blasts. Tracking of the TCR\u03b1\u03b2 repertoire during culture led to the identification of 20 clonotypes that recognize several tumor-associated peptides and are restricted by more than 5 HLA alleles, including HLA-A*02:01. TCRs were then expressed via genome editing. Briefly, simultaneous editing of endogenous TCR \u03b1 and \u03b2 chain genes was achieved using CRISPR/Cas9 technology (efficiency >90%), followed by transduction of T cells with lentiviral vectors encoding WT1-specific TCRs (efficiency >95% of CD8 + T cells). Phenotypic characterization of edited T lymphocytes showed a major enrichment of cells harboring T stem cell memory properties. Functional validation of the edited T cells is currently ongoing. Preliminary results of a 6 hours coculture experiment show that TCR edited T cells kill fresh WT1 + leukemic blasts, harvested from HLA-matched patients, with an efficiency up to 70% at an effector to target ratio of 5 to 1, while no killing of controls is observed.",

Standard chemotherapy is a successful treatment in 80% of patients, only about 20% develop a relapse, however these patients have a dismal prognosis. Prevention of relapse after firstline chemotherapy or stem cell transplantation (SCT) is therefore an urgent clinical need. We established a platform for the design of patient-individual peptide vaccination cocktails by combination of whole exome sequencing of tumor and normal tissue with in silico epitope prediction algorithms for individual patient HLA types. We started clinical translation of this approach by starting a phase I/II clinical trial in 2016 (NCT03559413). Besides feasibility and toxicity assessments, we aim to assess the capability of the peptide vaccination to induce neoantigen-specific T cell responses in high-risk ALL patients to target residual tumor cells and prevent leukemic relapses. Methods: Key inclusion criteria are: pediatric patients with ALL who suffered from second relapse after standard therapy or first relapse after SCT. Hematological remission has to be reached prior to vaccination. Nonsynonymous mutations are identified by whole exome and transcriptome sequencing of patient leukemic blasts and healthy reference tissue. HLA binding peptides harboring the altered amino acids are subsequently predicted in silico by algorithms SYFPEITHI, NetMHC and NetMHCpan for the patients' individual HLA type. Vaccine cocktails consisting of 3-5 individual peptides are produced and formulated under GMP conditions. The vaccination schedule is 16 vaccinations over 33 weeks using GM-CSF and Imiquimod as adjuvants. Response to the vaccination is monitored by detection of T cells recognizing the vaccinated peptides occurring over time in peripheral blood of patients by prestimulation and intracellular cytokine staining.",

An average expression of 34.4% of mutations was assessed by RNA sequencing. In all cases validated mutations could be identified and cocktail design was feasible. Until now, 4 patients received vaccinations. The vaccine was generally well tolerated and no or only mild side effects were observed. Immune monitoring was performed for 2 patients until now. In the first patient, we observed a transient CD4+ response against one vaccinated MHC Class II ligand and a sustained CD4+ response against the included wildtype control peptide derived from the antigen Survivin.

Although quantitative real-time PCR-based (qPCR) analysis has been used for this purpose, no standardized procedure to minimize systematic errors and enable comparability has been established yet. Here, we report on a single copy genebased (SCG) duplex (DP) PCR (SCG-DP-PCR) for the determination of the vector copy number (VCN) in CART products as well as patient samples following CART administration. SCG-DP-PCR was validated and compared to the broadly used absolute copy number qPCR (ACN) approach within the framework of a clinical trial treating patients with good manufacturing practice (GMP)-grade CARTs (HD-CAR-1). Methods: For conventional ACN, primers and probe targeting the CAR vector RV-SFG.CD19.CD28.4-1BBzeta were designed. Standard curves were established via serial dilutions of the SFG.CAR plasmid.

VCNs applying method A and B to the same target sample were compared. SP-CAR PCR reaction displayed efficiency of 103.5 \u00b1 7.1%; 104.2% \u00b1 2.1% and 99.3 \u00b1 1.6% efficiencies were achieved for DP-CAR and DP-RNAse PCR reaction, respectively (Table 1) .

Conclusions: In terms of efficiency and linearity by linear regression qPCR reactions were comparable. Validation of SCG-DP-PCR was achieved and represents an exact and less error-prone method to fulfil regulatory safety release criteria of CART products. Besides of accurately assessing VCN of transduced cells, SCG-DP-PCR is also a highly robust method to follow-up CARTs in treated patients.

According to the Central Brain Tumor Registry of the United States, central nervous system (CNS) tumors in pediatric patients (ages between 0-14 years old) are the second most common malignancies after blood-born malignancies, and the first amongst solid tumors, and known the most common cause of cancer-related deaths. Although hematopoietic stem cell transplantation has been exploited to treat many kinds of malignancies, currently its success rate in GBM is limited. Therefore, the GBM treatment paradigm needs shifting towards more effective treatments such as immune cell therapy. Natural killer (NK) cells have been recognized as potential anti-cancer effector cells, as they can recognize and target tumor cells. Since a small percentage of blood cells are differentiated as NK cells, the number of this group of cells is hardly enough to fight tumors, and so their multiplication and activation would be a potential effective cancer treatment.",

It is an oral thrombopoietin mimetic licensed in chronic immune thrombocytopenic purpura that induces platelet maturation and release by binding to c-MPL receptors on megakaryocytes. In a recent study; for patients with refractory SAA, eltrombopag induced a response (at 12 weeks) in at least one hematologic lineage in 44% patients and 36% no longer required platelet transfusions. And also 24% patients became RBC transfusion independent and 36% had a neutrophil response. Trilineage responses were seen in 24% of patients; although surprising, this might indicate stimulation of c-MPL receptors on remaining stem cells. Delayed recovery from thrombocytopenia is common after stem cell transplantation. In a study including 12 adult patients, Eltrombopag was used to enhance platelet recovery for post-HSCT thrombocytopenia. It is well tolerated and efficacious offering transfusion independence.",

Neutrophils protect the host from microorganisms via multiple processes including phagocytosis and formation of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs). Although reactive oxygen species (ROS) production seems to be essential for NETs formation, the key enzymes of the process are neutrophil elastase (NE) and myeloperoxidase (MPO). Methods: NE and MPO activity as well as NETs formation were investigated following HSCT in 11 patients at week 1 to 6 and 30 after neutrophil engraftment. Neutrophils were isolated using EasySep Direct Human Neutrophil isolation kit (StemCell Technologies Inc.) by immunomagnetic negative selection. Enzymatic activity of NE and MPO were measured using colorimetric assays. NETs formation of phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA)activated neutrophils was investigated by confocal fluorescence microscopy. All results were compared to those of healthy volunteers. Statistical significance was calculated using one way-ANOVA with Bonferroni post hoc test.",

All patients experienced fever and neutropenia. At engraftment, average NE activity was significantly decreased compared to the average value of 50 healthy individuals. NE activity improved week by week in patients, reached the lower reference range at 4 weeks following transplantation (Fig. 1A) and continued to increase. The enzymatic activity of MPO was comparable to the average value of 50 healthy individuals (Fig. 1B) and showed no significant difference between the distinct time points. At neutrophil engraftment, NETs formation was absent and comparable to those of non-activated neutrophils (Fig. 1C) . Although NETs formation increased week by week, it did not reach the average of 7 normal controls during the monitored time period. Also linear correlation between NE activity and NETs formation (R 2 =0.978) was demonstrated.",

There can be a spectrum to the disease and patients may also present with non-haematological features including prominent chest veins, cardiac, endocrine or urogenital abnormalities. We describe in our patient cohort a response to GCSF but an inflammatory, incapacitating, biopsyproven colitis associated with that G-CSF response. We have transplanted 3 children with such colitis, and describe a similar colitis with intestinal failure in a fourth. Methods: We investigate the biology of the neutropenic colitis, and demonstrate necrosis of the stimulated neutrophils. In vitro studies demonstrated that unstimulated neutrophils from patients with G6PC3D exhibited significantly increased production of IL8, reactive oxygen species (ROS) and neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) alongside significantly higher expression of CD11b, CD66b and CD14. In contrast, neutrophils from patients with G6PC3D produced significantly less ROS, MMP-9, neutrophil elastase and NETs upon stimulation.

At the end of induction therapy according to the current LAL/SHOP protocol 10% leukemic cells were detectable in the bone marrow. Treatment was changed to fludarabine, cytarabine and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (FLAG) in combination with liposomal doxorubicin. After this re-induction still 5% leukemic cells were detected in bone marrow, so the bispecific T-cell engager antibody blinatumomab was given. Due to an increasing portion of leukemic cells during the continuous infusion, antibody therapy was stopped and a cycle of clofarabine, cyclophosphamide and etoposide was administered. Unfortunately, still 31% leukemic cells were detectable afterwards. Because of chemotherapy-refractory leukemia a palliative oral treatment with mercaptopurine was started. However, the parents did not accept the palliative situation and searched for alternative therapeutic options in other university hospitals in Europe. After plenty of refusals the infant was admitted to our hospital five months after diagnosis. Methods: For molecular characterization genomic DNA was isolated from leukemic cells. A MLL-MLLT3/AF9 rearrangement as a consequence of the translocation t(9;11) (p22;q23) was detected and used as a marker for minimal residual disease. For further molecular characterization targeted deep next-generation sequencing was performed for a panel of 54 leukemia-associated genes. Interestingly, no mutation was found. To allow precise immunophenotyping of the leukemic cells treatment with mercaptopurine was stopped.",

Because of the detection of CD38+ leukemic cells after infusion of gemtuzumab ozogamicin, the anti-CD38 antibody daratumumab was given alternating twice within two weeks. Unfortunately afterwards, leukemic cells reappeared being negative for CD33 und CD38, but positive for CD22. Therefore, we administered the third antibody, the anti-CD22 monoclonal antibody inotuzumab ozogamicin, whereupon our patient developed a tumor lysis syndrome and a severe bone marrow aplasia. Shortly after, allogeneic bone marrow transplantation from an unrelated donor using a special conditioning regimen consisting of thymoglobulin, busulfan, fludarabine and clofarabine was conducted. Clofarabine was added because an additional antileukemic effect especially in infant ALL with MLL rearrangement was described. After transplantation the patient suffered from a severe hepatic sinusoidal obstruction syndrome with massive ascites, renal and pulmonary dysfunction, but finally the patient recovered completely. The first bone marrow examination 30 days after transplantation revealed a donor chimerism of 100% and a complete molecular remission using the MLL-MLLT3/AF9 rearrangement as marker for minimal residual disease. In all follow-up bone marrow samples we observed a complete donor chimerism and a complete molecular remission. Currently, eight months after transplantation the patient is in a very good physical condition with normal development according to the age. Background: Paediatric chronic graft versus host disease (cGVHD) is a debilitating condition associated with substantial morbidity and mortality. To date, there are no approved therapies for paediatric patients with cGVHD, and current treatments often lack sufficient efficacy or lead to severe/life-threatening toxicities that limit their effectiveness. Ibrutinib, a first-in-class, once-daily inhibitor of Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK), is approved in the US for the treatment of adult patients with cGVHD after failure of \u22651 lines of systemic therapy. This phase 1/2 study will evaluate the use of ibrutinib in paediatric patients with moderate or severe cGVHD.",

However, there are few reports of the relationship between skin reaction such as pigmentation and the other complications. Pigmentation of the skin is thought to be the result of melanin stagnating in the dermic layer due to increased synthesis of melanin and destruction of the basement membrane due to inflammation induced chemoradiotherapy. Melanin pigments are classified into two types: brown to black eumelanin and yellow to reddishbrown pheomelanin. 5-S Cysteinyldopa (5SCD) is precursors of pheomelanin, and its serum level has been used specific biochemical marker for malignant melanoma. Here, we examined serially 5SCD during the course of SCT to determine association with SCT related complications, because visual evaluation of skin color is difficult, and there have been no reports about 5SCD as SCT related biomarker. Methods: We prospectively analyzed 41(27 males, 14 females) patients who received SCT between May 2011 and March 2015 in Hokkaido University Hospital. The median age at transplantation of the patients was 7.9 years (range, 0-22). Indication for SCT were acute myelogenous leukemia in 10 patients, acute lymphoblastic leukemia in 9 patients, and other disease in 22 patients; juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia(2), malignant solid tumor(11), immunodeficiency(6), anaplastic anemia(2), and Diamond Blackfan anemia (1) . 34 patients received allogeneic SCT and 7 received autologous SCT. Myeloablative conditioning (MAC) was used for 30 patients and reduced intensity conditioning (RIC) was used for 11 patients. Sera were obtained from patients before conditioning therapy, on day 0, +5, +10, +15, +25 and +40. All blood samples were centrifuged at 3,000 rpm for 15 min, and stored at -80\u02daC until used. We also examined SCT related complications such as graft-Versus-host disease (GVHD), viral infection, and pre-engraft syndrome (PES). Statistical analyses were completed using the Mann-Whitney U test for unpaired samples, and Kruskal-Wallis test for three samples. Each test was performed with a 5% level of significance.",

SCN is a rare group of disorders resulting from intrinsic defects in myeloid cell proliferation and maturation caused by mutations in several genes; ELANE, HAX1, GFI1, WAS, and G6PC3 are among the most common ones. Almost 10% of patients are refractory to G-CSF, and the only definitive curative approach for such patients is allogeneic HSCT. The current absolute indications for HSCT is failure to respond to G-CSF treatment, or the development of MDS/leukemia in patients with SCN. Here, we present the result of 10 children with SCN who received allogeneic HSCT . Methods: We retrospectively assessed 10 allogeneic HSCT in children with severe congenital neutropenia. All patients received busulphan (BU) based myeloablative conditioning regimen. Busulphan was used according to weight adjusted dose. In addition, all patients received fludarabine 150 mg/m2 in five days or cyclophosphamide 200 mg/kg in 4 days and ATG 30 mg/kg in 3 days.

Diagnosis was established one month after birth from peripheral blood and CSF tap showed CNS involvement. Primary chemotherapy was commenced according to the Interfant-06 protocol. However, MRD remained positive two months under treatment, leading to an indication for allogeneic stem cell transplantation. In the Interfant-06 protocol, we opted for a conditioning regimen comprised of fludarabine (1.2 mg/kg for 5 days), busulfan and thiotepa (2x5 mg/kg). In our institution, busulfan is applied once daily with a target AUC of 85-95 h*mg/l in this very high risk situation. According to body weight, busulfan was given with 5.1 mg/ kg as a three-hour infusion on the first day.

The role of systemic inflammation is being evaluated in the animal model. It is known that systemic inflammation plays a role in traumatic brain injury (TBI) and is an independent risk factor for poor outcome in isolated TBI patients. On the other hand, M2-phenotype microglia inhibit inflammation and protect neurons from secondary damage and death.

All auto-HSCT recipients were characterized by one or several high-risk features: age of more than 18 months at disease (onset n=56), primary disseminated disease (n=59), unfavorable biologic variant (n=29), poor 1 st -line therapy response (n=16) or systemic relapse (n=9). Most patients (n=75) received Bu-Mel HDCT (in younger patients oral busulfan was replaced by Busilvex), in 3 primary resistant cases a 5D/5D regimen was used. A total of 20 patients with 1st (n=11) or 2nd (n=2) chemosensitive relapse, resistant relapse (n=4) or poor mobilizers with locally advanced resistant tumor (n=3) received allo-HSCT from haploidentical donor with fludarabine-based RIC. In 12 cases the transplant was modified via immunomagnetic positive or negative selection, 8 patients received post-transplant cyclophosphamide (post-CY)-based GVHD prophylaxis. GVHD prophylaxis also consisted of calceneurin inhibitors and sirolimus. Thirteen of 20 allo-HSCT recipients received posttransplant immunoadoptive (n=6) or targeted (n=7) therapy.",

Four patients dies due to infection (n=2), CNS hemorrhage (n=1), and secondary leukemia (n=1). According to multivariate analysis the most important prognostic factors were response to 1 st line therapy and post auto-HSCT MIBG scan results. The prognosis in initially resistant patients with good response to 2 nd or 3 rd -line therapy was still very poor (all patients relapsed with the median EFS of 12 months). All patients receiving a second auto-HSCT after relapse died due to disease progression. With a median follow up of 6 (1-80) months 9 allo-HSCT recipients are alive, 6 of them with no signs of disease progression. All long-term responders received post-transplant therapy. One patient died due to transplant complications, other deaths were caused by disease progression. There was no obvious difference between outcomes in post-CY based and transplant modification-based transplantations. aGVHD more often developed in modified transplant recipients (8 patients vs 2 in post-CY group, 4 of these cases Gr III-IV), 3 patients in post-CY group had Grade III-IV hemorrhagic cystitis.

Previous studies have demonstrated that donor age is vital for older patients by affecting TRM and survival. Accordingly a relevant question is whether outcomes can be improved with a younger HLA-haploidentical offspring donor rather than an older HLA-matched sibling (MSD). In our previous multi-center report under ATG+G-CSF based protocol for haplo HCT, offspring donor is correlated with lower TRM and higher leukemia free survival (LFS) as compared with older MSD in subgroup analysis for recipients >50years although it did not reach statistical significance. On the contrary, in a recent report from EBMT and CIBMTR under PTCY modality for haplo HCT, among patients aged 55 to 76 years, despite lower chronic graft-versus-host-disease (GVHD), graft failure, TRM, and overall mortality were higher after transplant from offspring compared with an MSD although there were differences in transplant platforms between the 2 groups. Methods: We extended our multi-center dataset and a matched pair analysis was performed. Outcomes of 142 acute leukemia patients (>=50 years) transplanted in CR1/ CR2 who received HCT from offspring (n=57) or MSD (n=85) between Jan, 2013 and June, 2017 present in the multi-center database were analyzed. Because the patient population was small, a 1:1 ratio matched pair analysis was implemented with the following matching factors: underlying disease (acute myeloid leukemia, acute lymphoblastic leukemia), disease status (CR1/CR2), age and sex of patients, year of transplant, blood group incompatibilities, and sex of donor.",

It's use in mismatched unrelated donor transplant (MMUD HCT) is less well established.

Background: Mothers displaying a persistent fetal microchimerism (FM) proved to be the most suitable donor in T cell-depleted haploidentical stem cell transplantation (hHSCT) in children. We presumed that fetal cells leave an imprint in the mothers' immune system which positively affects recognition and elimination of malignant cells in the child by maternal effector cells. Distinct killer cell immunoglobulin-like receptors (KIR)/HLA constellations are not only associated with reduced relapse rates after HSCT in children, but also supposedly influence the establishment of an FM.",

The median (range) age at HSCT was 6 (1-11) years and the majority of patients were boys (31/51, 60.8%).

Moreover since 2017, in accordance with this protocol, the Competent Authority (AIFA) has extended the registration of Plerixafor (Law no.648/96), also for the mobilization in \"poor mobilizer\" healthy donors. Finally, in 2018 the protocol was extended to \"poor mobilizer\" family donors, making management equivalent in related and unrelated donors. At the time of the donor\u00b4s informed consent for the donation of HPC, the hypothesis of the lack of mobilization or inadequate collection was illustrated and the possible actions proposed as \"back-up donation\" were anticipated. Failed mobilization of CSE has been defined as the presence of one of the two criteria: a number of CD34+ circulating on peripheral blood lower than 20/\u03bcL on the 5th day of stimulation (5D), or the collection of CD34+ < 1.0x106/kg weight of the recipient at first apheresis. In these cases, a single dose of Plerixafor is administered subcutaneously by health professionals under medical supervision, 0.24mg/kg of body weight, 6-11 hours before the start of apheresis.",

            "text": "Disclosure: Nothing to declare Background: Autologous stem cells transplantation (ASCT) is an effective treatment option for young patients with multiple myeloma (MM). A minority of patients may still experience untoward toxicity due to delayed engraftment. Thus, the current policy in many centers is aimed to increase the target dose of collected CD34 + cells up to an \"optimal\" level of 4x10 6 /Kg per procedure. Therefore, an ideal mobilization, aimed to collect 4 to 8 CD34 + cells/kg in one apheresis, should achieve a number of circulating CD34 + cells >40/mcL (very good mobilizers). Plerixafor may help to maximize the CD34 + collection but its use is limited by high cost. We carried out a retrospective analysis aimed to predict the quality of mobilization and develop an algorithm to optimize both timing of collection and use of Plerixafor. Methods: We retrospectively collected data from 91 mobilization procedure performed in our center between 2006 and 2016 for MM. All received the same mobilization protocol with cyclophosphamide (range 3-4 gr/sqm) and G-CSF 10mcg/kg from +5. CD34 + cell count was started when White Blood Cells (WBC) count exceeded 1x10 9 /L. Patients were excluded from this analysis if 1) showed a CD34+ count >40/mcL (target achieved at first day count) and/or 2) CD34 + count on second day was missing and/or 3) Plerixafor was administered on first day according to previous policies. Sixty-eight patients were evaluable for the study. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analysis to study cCD34 + kinetics and assess predictors impact on mobilization was carried out. Ratio CD34 +/WBC in first day count, gender, disease category and time from mobilization chemotherapy were also included Results: Among the 68 patients included in the analysis, the threshold of 40 CD34+/mcL cells on the second day was reached by 35 (51,47%) of patients (GroupA) whilst the remaining 33 (24,7%) failed the target (GroupB). Median (range) WBC x10 9 /L and CD34 + /mcL counts in group A and B were 2,01 (1-5,01) and 21,33 (7,56 -39,91), 1,08 (1) (2) (3) (4) (5) (6) 46 ) and 3,31 (0,06-31,14) respectively, with a statistically significant differences among group (Mann-Whitney p= 0,01 and p=0,02 respectively). Only CD34 + /WBC ratio and CD34 + /mcL on first day count had an impact on kinetics and optimal mobilization. Logistic regression model highlight CD34+/mcL (OR=1,270; 95% CI: 1,060 -1,522) on first count as an independent predictor of second day optimal mobilizer, with AUC of 0.9% (0, 99) in ROC analysis. Two CD34 + thresholds were then calculated: < 7,56/mcl (PPV 0,81; NPV 1,0) that identified poor mobilizer, and \u2265 24,06/mcl (PPV 1,0; NPV0,59) that exclude probability to fail on second day. For those with a CD34 + count between 7,56-24,06 the CD34+/WBC ratio (OR=1,768, 95% CI: 1,307-2,391) was a predictor of optimal mobilization (AUC 0,94; 0,885-0,996); cut-off value was 5,63 (sensibility 94,28; specificity 84,84)",

We have developed an algorithm aimed to the use of Plerixafor to both rescue poor mobilizers and boost CD34 + count in intermediate mobilizers. Background: Successful autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT) requires the infusion of a sufficient number of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). Peripheral blood (PB) is the most commonly used source of HSCs, therefore, it is important to optimize methods used to mobilize the HSCs. The most clinically used chemotherapeutic agents for effective mobilization are cyclophosphamide and etoposide. Recent published studies suggest that etoposide has a better mobilization effect than cyclophosphamide even at lower doses, but it is not clear why this difference occurs. In this study, we tried to determine whether there is a difference in the mechanism of mobilization between cyclophosphamide and etoposide. Methods: First, in order to confirm the clinical data for efficacy and toxicity of mobilization, we retrospectively analyzed the data of patients who were diagnosed with lymphoma and performed mobilization using cyclophosphamide or etoposide from January 2011 to December 2018. Second, mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) were primarily cultured from the healthy controls, then treated cyclophosphamide or etoposide at a concentration of 10% inhibition of cell growth, and cytokine analysis was performed to identify cytokines known to be associated with mobilization. Third, mobilization mouse model using cyclophosphamide or etoposide was generated, total blood was collected at the time of HSCs collection, and cytokine and network analysis (using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis) was performed.",

In the analysis of toxicity during mobilization, the incidence of neutropenic fever was higher in the cyclophosphamide group (P = 0.007). During mobilization, cyclophosphamide maintained lower WBC counts than etoposide and showed a large increase in WBC counts at the start of collection ( Figure 1 ).

Nevertheless, due to the introduction of promising new transplant regimens, especially in the haploidentical transplantation setting bone marrow (BM) donations are regaining importance. Although for both donation methods severe side effects are rarely described, BM collection is associated with considerable blood loss and hence symptoms of acute blood loss are commonly observed. Therefore autologous blood are collected routinely in some institutions before donation. Since the collected bone marrow amount depends on the target dose, the WBC yield in the product influences the required bone marrow volume. Therefore we sought to investigate the relationship between collection volume, RBC volume removal, drop in Hb and indications for blood transfusion. Furthermore, we assessed WBC and CD34+yields in relationship to various donor parameters and to product volume, in order to find prediction tools for collection volumes. Methods: 489 allogeneic bone marrow harvests from adult donors were performed at our institution and retrospectively analyzed. Complete blood counts, serum iron and ferritin were assessed at work-up and 4 weeks after donation. The bone marrow product quality including WBC, hematocrit (Hct) and CD34+ cells were assessed by automatic hemocytometry and single-platform flow cytometry with ISHAGE gating.",

No donor presented symptoms with indication for blood transfusion. The median WBC concentration of the BM product was 26.5/nl (5-95% percentile:16.77-38.75/ nl) the CD34+cell concentration 186.5/\u03bcl (5-95% percentile: 73.92-346.9/\u03bcl). In the linear regression analysis leukocyte counts of the donor before donation correlated significantly with WBC concentration in the product. Thus in order to collect with 90% certainty the 300 Mio WBC which are a typical per-kg dose for an allogeneic recipient, 16.24 ml of bone marrow must be collected.

To obtain a sufficient amount of HSCs, hematopoiesis is stimulated with granulocyte-macrophage factors (GM-CSF) both in mono mode and after the administration of cytostatics followed by cytapheresis sessions (alone or after the cytostatics followed by cytapheresis sessions) . Cryopreservation protocols are used to preserve cells in a viable state, followed by long-term storage of transplants in liquid nitrogen. However, in some patients it is not possible to obtain the necessary amount of HSCs. The inclusion of plerixafor in standard mobilization schemes allows you to prepare the sufficient quantity of HSCs in most patients with MM. Methods: The study included 18 samples of autografts from 18 patients with MM from 2015 to 2017 (Median 2.1 \u00b1 0.3). HSCs mobilization was performed on the background of unstable blood formation after high doses of cyclophosphamide 6 g/m 2 with the subsequent administration of G-CSF at a dose of 12-24 \u03bcg / kg (9 samples from 9 patients) and with the addition of plerixaphor at a dose of 0.24 \u03bcg / kg (9 samples from 9 patients). Immunophenotype viability of HSCs in autotransplants after cryopreservation were determined by flow cytometry using the ISHAGE protocol on a flow cytometer (FACS CantoII, Becton Dickinson) by expressing surface markers of antibodies against CD34, CD45, CD90, CD38 and staining with 7aminoactinomycin (7-AAD). The colony-forming activity of HSCs (CFU-CFU-mix, CFU-GM, CFU-G, CFU-M) was evaluated in methylcellulose (MethoCult H4435, Stemcell Technologies, Canada) for 1x10 5 transplanted cells for 14 days.",

Plerixafor+G-CSF can be a salvage strategy in poor mobilizers. Some series describe the use of plerixafor to collect greater doses of CD34+ cells in hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) with Tcell depletion. Plerixafor use in the mobilization protocol could help collecting higher CD34+ dose in indirect T-cell depletion (CD34+ selection) for ex-vivo manipulated haploidentical transplantation, with less number of apheresis and a rapid engraftment. Methods: Data of fourteen healthy peripheral-blood donors was retrospectively collected. They received 4 days 10 mcg/Kg/day G-CSF and 0,24 mg/Kg/day Plerixafor on 4\u00ba day as mobilization treatment. Fourteen pediatric patients (median age 13 years, range 8-15) diagnosed with malignant and no malignant hematological diseases received haploidentical HSCT with CD34+ selection and CD45RA+ depletion between February 2015 and July 2017 .",

Background: Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are selfrenewing multipotent progenitor cells with wide differentiation potential. Their ease of isolation and expansion in vitro as well as their unique regenerative therapeutic properties suggest the use of MSC as an approach for treating several disorders. Extra-embryonic tissues as placenta have been proposed as potential sources of MSCs due to the absence of ethical problems neither risks for the patients. Furthermore, only protocols using fresh placental tissue have been described so far. A protocol for isolating MSCs from delayed-manipulated tissue was designed and tested in order to optimize the use of placental MSCs (MSCs-P) in an advanced therapies context.",

Notwithstanding such progress, MM remains incurable. Results from allogeneic stem cell transplantation (SCT), including haploidentical transplantation, in MM has shown clinical results. However, these responses are only observed in a minority of patients.

In murine models of acute GVHD lymph node homing capacity via CD62L (L-selectin) proved to be essential for disease prevention. Yet, Treg recruitment from lymph nodes to peripheral sites of ongoing GVHD also seems necessary to achieve maximum protective as well as therapeutic effects. The chemokine receptor CCR4 directs activated T cells to sites of inflammation, thus high CCR4 expression should facilitate Treg homing to affected GVHD target organs. With this project we lay the foundation for future in vivo studies of Treg therapy for GVHD by upregulation of CCR4 expression.",

Distinguishing patient and donor hematopoiesis is usually performed by STR-PCR, a powerful method developed for forensic purposes. However, this method shows restrictions with respect to detection limit, preciseness, and the possibility of automated read out. Digital PCR could circumvent some of these limitations. Methods: Recently, validated for the Bio-Rad droplet digital platforms, the Biotype Mentype DigitalQuant Assay was released. The assay uses INDEL polymorphisms on chromosomal DNA to distinguish patient and donor hematopoiesis on a FRET hydrolysis assay basis (\"TaqMan assays\"). Thus the assay in principle is applicable on the chamber based 3 D digital PCR system (Thermo Fisher). Due to different reaction chemistry and physical properties of thermal transfer between the digital PCR platforms protocols are reasonably not fully compatible which would lead to lower fluorescence intensities and poor signal resolution on the solid chip based Thermo Fisher 3D platform. An adjusted PCR protocol was established and optimized using representative markers, followed by determination of tolerable and optimal amount of input DNA.

The frequency of acute and chronic GVHD was acceptable, 10-years GRFS rate of 35,3% in 1 st -2 nd CR represents good quality of life following unmanipulated Haplo-HSCT and therefore may be recommended as option for use in children and adolescents with high-risk AL. Disclosure: Nothing to declare Background: B7-H3 (CD276) is thought to act as an immune checkpoint and regulates T and NK cell responses. It is highly overexpressed on many solid tumors while on healthy tissue protein expression is limited. This makes B7-H3 an interesting target for cancer immunotherapy. In highrisk neuroblastoma patients, targeting disialoganglioside GD2 with the recently approved monoclonal antibody (mAb) CH14.18 after autologous or allogeneic SCT, significantly improves survival. However, GD2 expression is heterogeneous and CH14.18 causes severe adverse effects. Thus, we evaluated B7-H3 as an alternative or additional target antigen. We investigated different anti-B7-H3 mAb constructs and mAb-cytokine fusions (immunocytokines) for their ability to elicit antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC)",

In a univariate analysis, conditioning type was strongly associated with OS; at 1-year, the probability of OS was highest with TBF (92% [77-100]) compared with Bu/Cy (80% [59-100]), FB4 (68% [51-91%]), Flu/Treo (33% [11-100]), and FB2 (68% [51-91]), P=0.001. TBF benefit was maintained in a multivariable Cox model when compared to MAC (hazard ratio [HR] 0.10 [0.01-0.93], P=0.043). Relapse rates at 1-year were lowest with TBF (8% [1-54], P=0.33)with a trend to a lower risk in the multivariable analysis (HR 0.14 [0.01-1.41], P=0.096). In a univariate and multivariable analysis, NRM risk was not increased with TBF (P=0.234 and P=0.642, respectively). Other variables associated with inferior 1-year OS included hypoalbuminemia at SCT (p=0.05), a high DIPSS+ score (p=0.01), and an HLA mismatched unrelated donors (p=0.001). Age, the degree of splenomegaly and prior ruxolitinib were not significant prognostic factors.Conclusions: Outcomes following Allogeneic SCT are strongly dependent on the conditioning regimen.

Cytokines including transforming growth factor \u03b21 (TGFB1) play a pivotal role in immune reconstruction, and the development of graft versus host disease (GvHD) or infections. Methods: The role of TGFB1 gene -1347C>T variant was investigated in a cohort of 409 adult recipient-donor pairs [178 female and 231 male, median age: 43 years (range 19-73)]. The majority of the patients suffered from acute myeloid leukaemia (155/409, 38%) and 254 patients from other malignant hematopoietic disorders. During transplantation 210 (52%) patients received graft from their siblings, 199 (48%) from matched unrelated donors (MUD).Myeloablative conditioning (MAC) was applied in 261 (64%) and reduced intensity conditioning (RIC) in 148 (36%) cases. For GvHD prevention tacrolimus plus sirolimus (TAC&SIR) were most commonly applied in 238 (58%), cyclosporine (CSA) in 95 (23%) and TAC as single agent in 76 (19%) cases. TGFB1 variant was analysed from genomic DNA with LightCycler hybridisation probe method.Results: We did not find any association of recipient TGFB1 -1347C>T with HSCT outcome parameters (acute and chronic GvHD, cytomegalovirus infection [CMV], transplant associated thrombotic microangiopathy [TA-TMA]) and survival (transplant related mortality,[TRM]; overall survival,[OS]) neither in the whole HSCT cohort nor in any subgroups. In the whole cohort donor -1347C>T genotype did not impair survival (p= 0.4). Diagnosis, donor type, conditioning and GvHD prophylaxis were tested for interaction with donor TGFB1 genotype. Although donor TGFB1 -1347C> genotype influenced OS in the subgroups of patients with acute leukaemia, or treated with MAC conditioning or with TAC-based GvHD prophylaxis in multivariate analyses, test for interaction indicated the differential effect of TGFB1 genotypes in MAC versus RIC subgroups (p=0.035). In the MAC cohort, patients transplanted with -1347TT genotype donor had unfavourable outcome (60-month OS CC: 62.1%\u00b14.8%, TC: 46.8% \u00b14.8% and TT: 35.6%\u00b19.3%, p=0.032; which was independent from age, donor type and GvHD prophylaxis, p= 0.003, HR: 2.35, 95% CI: 1.35-4.10). In case of myeloablative conditioning, relapse rate (CC: 18% vs. CT 28% vs. TT 18%) was not different in subgroups stratified by donor TGFB1 genotype.",

Functional single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within the thrombomodulin gene (THBD) might contribute to endothelial dysfunction, thereby abnormal reactivity during graft versus host disease (GvHD) after allogenic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). Methods: We analyzed the impact of THBD SNPs (rs1962, rs1042579 and rs1042580) after HSCT [n=400; 207 sibling/ 193 HLA-matched donor; 256 myeloablative (MAC)/ 144 reduced intensity conditioning (RIC)]. DNA samples for SNP analyses were collected before allo HSCT at the center Department of Hematology and Stem Cell Transplantation, Central Hospital of Southern Pest in Hungary between January 2007 and December 2013. Clinical data were analyzed retrospectively. SNPs were genotyped from genomic DNA by melting curve analysis (LightCycler 480 II, Roche Diagnostics). [[P245 Image] 1. Figure 1 A) Transplant related mortality (TRM) and B) overall survival (OS) stratified according to THBD homozygosity.] Results: Homozygosity for either THBD SNP influenced acute GvHD grades III-IV [8.4% (8/95) in homozygotes vs. 16.7% (51/305) in non-homozygotes, p=0.048] and cumulative incidence of transplant related mortality (TRM) [at 24 months 15.9% (9.4-24.1%) vs. 33.6% (28.3-38.9%), p=0.0004, Figure 1A]. Transplantassociated thrombotic microangiopathy occurred at similar frequency in both genotype groups [14.7% (14/95) in homozygotes vs. 19.3% (59/305) in non-homozygotes, p=0.36]. Relapse rate was not different [26.3% (25/95) vs. 26.2% (80/305), p=1.0]. In homozygous patients, favorable overall survival was observed (OS at 60 months: 58.5\u00b15.4% vs. 42.8\u00b13.1%, p=0.017,Figure 1B). The prognostic effect of THBD homozygosity was independent from other favorable factors like younger age at HSCT or sibling donor (p=0.025, HR: 0.66, 95%CI: 0.46-0.95). The impact of the combination of homozygous variants was pronounced in MAC, but not in RIC (test for interaction: p=0.054, MAC: p=0.009, HR: 0.49, 95%CI: 0.29-0.84; RIC: p=0.89, HR: 0.97, 95%CI: 0.58-1.61).Conclusions: Our results suggest that recipient homozygosity for THBD rs1962, rs1042579 or rs1042580 play protective role after HSCT. THDB homozygosity may propitiously influence the development of acute GvHD, transplant related mortality and the overall survival in case of myeloablative conditioning.Disclosure: No relevant conflicts of interest.

Severe manifestations of acute GVHD of the gut portends a poor prognosis in patients after Allo-HCT.Methods: We conducted a chart review of the patients who underwent Allogeneic HCT at our center between November 2011 and October 2018. The clinical profile of the patients experiencing Acute GVHD of the gastrointestinal system, including treatment received and outcomes were analysed by standard statistical methods to determine baseline-clinical as well as treatment related predictors for the development of Acute Gut GVHD.Results: 228 patients underwent Allo-HCT for different indications, of whom 63 (27.63%) patients developed acute GVHD. 42 (18.42%) patients had Acute GVHD of the gastro-intestinal system. The median age was 26.5 years (range: 2-57). Of the 42, 30 (71.4%) patients were male and 12 (28.6%) were females. 13 (31%) patients underwent Allo-HCT for benign haematological diseases (Transfusiondependant Thalassemia: 9, Severe Aplastic Anaemia: 3, Inherited Bone Marrow Failure Syndromes: 1). 29 (69%) patients had malignant haematological disorders (AML: 13, ALL: 7, CML:5, Myelofibrosis:1, Relapsed Refractory Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma: 1). Of the patients with GVHD, 24 (57.1%) underwent Matched Related Donor Allo-HCT, 6 (14.3%) underwent Matched unrelated donor Allo-HCT while 12 (28.6 %) patients had Haploidentical Donor Allo-HCT. 31 (73.8%) received Myeloablative conditioning regimen, while 11 (26.2%) patients were conditioned with Reduced-Intensity Conditioning regimens. 37 (88.1%) patients received Peripheral Blood stem cell grafts while 5 (11.9%) received Bone marrow grafts. Graft Vs Host Disease Prophylaxis used was Cyclosporine and injectable short-course Methotrexate in 30 (71.4%) patients, Tacrolimus and Methotrexate in 1 (2.4%) patient, and Post-Transplant Cyclophosphamide along with Tacrolimus and Mycophenolate Mofetil in 11 patients (26.2%). Grade 1/2 Gut GVHD occurred in 18 patients (Grade1: 7 (16.7%), Grade 2: 11 (26.2%)), while Severe (Grade 3/4) Gut GVHD occurred in 24 patients (Grade 3: 15 (35.7%), Grade 4: 9",

In the new 2014 NIH criteria for diagnosis of cGVHD (Jagasia et al, BBMT), phimosis or urethral scarring or stenosis are listed as diagnostic signs to establish cGVHD diagnosis. Thus, reported incidence of male genital cGVHD likely underestimates magnitude of the problem. Patients commonly under-report symptoms or signs and sexual function issues and clinicians often underdiagnose male genital cGVHD. So far only twelve publications, mostly case reports, and one original paper than included 155 patients (cross-sectional study), reported on male cGVHD. Symptoms and manifestations included inflammatory balanoposthitis, phimosis, lichen sclerosis, Peyronie's disease or urethral stenosis and strictures. In this study case series of male genital cGVHD manifestations and treatment were presented, including treatment of urethral stricture with buccal mucosa autograft.Methods: From 2013-2017, 317 patients received allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant at University Hospital Centre Zagreb; 81 (41 female, 40 male) were diagnosed with cGVHD.

Overall cumulative incidence of MDRO-infection at 30 days was 11% (95%CI 3.4-16.8)Conclusions: Weekly screening for MDRO identified a high number of MDRO colonizations, with first detection beyond baseline in 50% of the cases, allowing to apply early strategies of infection control. 75% of our cohort could benefit from guided treatment by the time of the febrile episode. Early identification of MDRO colonization might have helped to reduce MDRO related mortality, since none of the colonized patients died due to MDRO associated infection or needed ICU admission. However, these findings should be confirmed with further studies, comparing baseline with weekly MDRO screening strategies.[[P402 Image] 1. IncidenceMDRO-colonization]",

Hospital length of stay (LOS) and readmissions by CMV risk category and receipt of PET]Results: Of 368 patients including 76 LR and 192 HR (81.3% TCD), 273 (74%) patients developed CMV viremia; 208 (56.5%) patients started PET with an average of 36 days post HCT (including 33% and 78% of LR and HR respectively). By D180, 17 (4.7% of entire cohort or 8% among PET group) patients developed EOD (gastrointestinal disease in 12, retinitis in 1, pneumonitis and encephalitis in 2 patients each); Among PET group 7 (3.4%) patients developed CMV resistance: (val)Ganciclovir 5 patients, Cidofovir 1 patient and Cidofovir+Foscarnet 1 patient. Overall, PET group had longer mean LOS for HCT (34.3 vs 29.9 days, p=0.0001) and higher rates of readmission (5.2 vs 3.1, p=0.00006). Similar findings were observed in stratified analysis by CMV risk(Table). 40 (22.2%) of readmissions in PET group were associated with CMV. By D180, CMV accounted for 17% of infectionrelated deaths.Conclusions: Among PET group, nearly 1 in 12 patients developed CMV EOD; PET use was associated with longer inpatient stay and greater rates of readmissions compared to no PET use.

Mechnikov North-Western State Medical University, Saint-Petersburg, Russian Federation Background: Despite the development and introduction into clinical practice of new diagnostic algorithms and modern anti-infective drugs, the risk of severe infectious complications in recipients of hematopoietic stem cells remains high and affects the results of hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT).Data on the prevalence and structure of invasive candidiasis in children after HSCT are insufficient. The aim was to study the epidemiology of invasive candidiasis (IC) after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) in large pediatric cohort of patients for the 7 years in Raisa Gorbacheva Memorial Research Institute of Children Oncology,Hematology and Transplantation (CIC725).Methods: In 2009 -2016 yy have been performed 754 HSCT in children: 494 allogeneic and 260 autologous. A retrospective study included 22 cases of IC after HSCT. EORTC/MSG 2008 criteria were used for the diagnosis of proven IC as well as to evaluate response to therapy.",

Fever preceded CRP increase (20.5%), CRP was increased before fever(36.1%), or co-occurred (26.5%). FUO in neutropenia (117 patients) showed a median duration of 2 (range 1-11) days. Severe sepsis developed in 95, septic shock in 26 patients. Blood cultures (BC) were drawn on a median of 4 (range 1-38) days. In 34 patients at least 1 BC became positive. 23/7/2/2 patients had 1/2/3/4 positive BC. For 7/34 patients with positive BC, the same species grew >1x: 3x Staphylococcus epidermidis, 2x Candida parapsilosis, 1x each Cryptococcus neoformans and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. During hospital stay, 94 patients received \u22651 tCT. Of these, 34/35/15/5/1/1/3 patients had 1/2/3/4/5/6/7 scans. In 64/94 patients, \u22651 tCT showed pulmonary infiltrates, with 'possible'/'probable' IFI in 38/11 patients. 89 BAL were performed for 51 patients. 50 patients had \u22651 BAL result positive. The top 5 species discovered were Coagulase-negative staphylococci (31x), Yeast (27x), Enterococcus species (26x), Aspergillus species (14x) and Streptococcus viridans (10x). Cytomegalovirus was seen 5x. 121/27/10/4//3/1 patients received 1/2/ 3/4/6/9 CVC, consecutively. 1 st CVC lasted 25.6\u00b18.5 days, 2 nd CVC 13.3\u00b16.2 days. In 86 patients, \u22651CVC was analyzed for microbial growth, 10 CVC showed growth, 5/ 10 CVC Staphylococcus epidermidis, 2 Candida parapsilosis, 1 each Candida glabrata, Enterococcus faecalis and Enterococcus faecium. Excluding mucositis, 84 patients (50.6%) were found to have a documented infection by diagnostic investigation. All but 13 patients received antibiotic therapy according to the standard operating procedures of the department. 129/75/42/20 patients received 1 st /2 nd /3 rd /4 th line empiric antibiotic therapy. Discharge was possible for 145 patients. Reasons for death were infection in 19 patients, other causes in 2 patients. Cumulative incidence of death by infection after one year was 16.6% (95%CI 11.3-22.7%). FUO in neutropenia was influenced by duration of neutropenia < /\u226512 days (30.8% vs 82.7%, p< .001) only but not by the CD34+ content/kg BW of the patient, CMV IgG status/ matching, type of conditioning, ECOG, age < /\u2265 59 years, or underlying disease. Documented infection was influenced by duration of neutropenia < /\u2265 12 days (p< .001), an ECOG of 0/1 compared to ECOG of 2 (78.6% vs 47.7%, p=.027) and the CMV IgG status of the patient (positive 57.7% vs negative 40.6%, p=.029). CD34+ content, conditioning or underlying disease again showed no impact.Conclusions: Infections still contribute to morbidity and mortality after allo-SCT. The diagnostic results of an elaborate workup around an infection are poor. Further research has to focus on identifying novel diagnostic methods. Careful observance of risk factors for infections might help in better choosing patients at risk for severe infections and tailoring antibiotic prophylaxis.Disclosure: Nothing to declare",

These therapies are only partially effective. Eltrombobag, a thrombopoetin receptor agonist, is effective in aplastic anemia and idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) and may improve posttransplant graft function (Popat et al, ASH 2015).Methods: We evaluated eltrombobag in 7 consecutive subjects with posttransplant poor graft function.Median age was 47 y (range, 4-60 y). 4 were male. Diagnoses included acute myeloid leukaemia (N=1), myelodysplastic syndrome (N=1), aplastic anaemia (N=2), Hodgkin lymphoma (N=2) and acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (N=1). Donors included HLA-identical siblings (N=4) and HLA-haplotype-matched relatives (N=3). Pretransplant conditioning was conventional (N=3) or reduced intensity (N=4). Grafts were blood (N=6) or bone marrow (N=1). Median time to diagnosis of poor graft function was 38.2 d (range, 17.7-139 d) posttransplant. Median platelets count, 18 x 10E+9/L. 3 subjects had platelets < 20 x10E+9/L. Median posttransplant follow-up is 8 mo(range, 6-41 mo).Results: Median interval between diagnosis of poor graft function and starting eltrombobag was 38.2 d (range, 17.7-139d). Median maximum dose was 525 mg/w(range, 350-700 mg/w). 5 subjects responded (71.4%) . Median interval to platelets >50 x10E+9/L was 21 d(range, 7-30d).Conclusions: Eltrombobag can reverse posttransplant poor graft function.Disclosure: Nothing to discloseP595 Successful haploidentic bone marrow transplantation with inotuzumab ozogamicin in patient with relapsed and resistant B cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia Ali \u00dcnal 1 , Serhat \u00c7elik 1 , Zeynep Tu\u011fba G\u00fcven 1 , B\u00fclent Eser 1 , Leylag\u00fcl Kaynar 1 , Mustafa \u00c7etin 1 1 Erciyes Medical School, Hematology, Kayseri, Turkey",

No serious advent events associated with the desensitization therapy was recorded. Most common adverse events were rituximab infusion reaction and (mild) hypotension during PE.Conclusions: Desensitization therapy for aHAb based on EBMT guidelines is safe in pediatric patients undergoing TCD haplo-HSCT. PE and rituximab seem more effective in reducing the title of anti-class I aHAb, thus supporting the use of BC infusion before HSCT for those patients with anti-class II aHAb.

Chronic supportive care and related financial burden, often have an adverse impact on patients and their families. Moreover, in India ST is still associated with significant morbidity and mortality.Methods: The aim of this study was to assess healthrelated quality of life (HRQoL) in ST patients after BMT. Three groups of 30 patients each aged 6 to 12 years were analyzed: Group A consisted of healthy controls, i.e. siblings of children with severe thalassemia; Group B included children with ST on supportive care; and Group C children at least two years after successful BMT for ST.

The use of preemptive and rescue strategy of Plerixafor demonstrate effectiveness in more than 80% of VPM. Despite the amount of infused CD34 + cells were similar between VPM and PM patients, the median time to neutrophils engraftment was delayed in VPM. In conclusion, VPM could beneficiated of received Plerixafor on day +4. Disclosure: Garc\u00eda-Gala JM.

            "text": "Background: Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is an established procedure in lymphoma Background: The role of inflammatory cascade in tumor microenvironment has been demonstrated in several studies. As a part of this issue, elevated neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio (NLR) was shown to be associated with an adverse prognosis, particularly in solid tumors. The aim of this study is to determine the impact of pre-transplant NLR on early transplant complications, as well as post-transplant relapse and survival.Methods: A total of 119 lymphoma patients [median age: 49(18-71) years; male/female: 64/55] who underwent autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) were included in this retrospective study.Results: The initial diagnosis was Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) in 35 (29.4%), B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) in 67 (56.3%) and T-cell NHL in 17 (14.3%) patients. Of 116 patients who were evaluated for pretransplant disease status, 52 patients (44.8%) were in complete remission, 45 patients (38.8%) were in partial remission and 19 (16.4%) patients had refractory disease. Median pre-transplant NLR was found to be 3.42(0-97) . When the study population was divided into two subgroups as \"low-\" and \"high-NLR\", based on median NLR value, number of febrile days were found to be relatively higher in the low-NLR group (p=0.051). A positive correlation was demonstrated between NLR and lactate dehydrogenase levels (r=0.218; p=0.03); and NLR and ferritin levels (r=0.277; p=0.003). At a median follow-up of 24 (1-264) months, overall survival (OS) was found to be better in the low-NLR group without statistical significance [25 vs 13(1-91) months; p=0.069]. In univariate analysis, pre-transplant NLR represented a significant impact on OS (p=0.021). Other prognostic factors were age (p=0.041), platelet engraftment (p=0.018), post-transplant relapse (p=0.009) and pre-transplant ferritin level (p< 0.001). The permanent impact of ferritin on OS was confirmed in multivariate analysis (p=0.008).Conclusions: In this study, an adverse impact of elevated pre-transplant NLR on OS was demonstrated in autologous HSCT recipients with lymphoma. As a predictor of prognosis, NLR may be considered as a safe and cost-effective parameter. Further studies are required in order to use this predictor in routine clinical practice.Background: High cure rates in childhood diseases have been achieved by stem cell transplantation (SCT). However, there is little knowledge concerning recovery of the immune system and community-acquired infection after SCT. Here we studied the long-term reconstitution of the immune system and incidences of community-acquired infection after SCT.Methods: We reviewed medical records for 44 patients (M/F: 31/13, median age: 5 years (range: 1-22years) who were treated in the Department of Pediatrics, Hokkaido University Hospital. We analyzed CD4-positive cell counts, serum immunoglobulin G (IgG) levels, and incidences of community-acquired infection until 2 years after SCT. Indications for SCT were ALL in 8 patients, AML in 4, AA in 6, NB in 5, RMS in 2, JMML in 1, NHL in 1, CGD in 5, WAS in 3, XSCID in 2, APDS in 2, CD40LD in 2, and other solid tumor in 3 patients. Stem cell sources were autologous PB/BM in 6, allogenic BM in 23 (9 related and 14 unrelated) and allogenic CB in 15 patients. In this study, we excluded patients who relapsed after SCT.Results: The duration of CD4-positive cell counts < 500/ ml after SCT was 14.7\u00b111.4 months in all patients. The durations were 12.6\u00b17.1 months in patients with hematologic malignancies, 11.5\u00b17.3 months in patients with hematologic disorders such as aplastic anemia and PID, 28.8\u00b125.9 months in patients with solid tumor, 16.0 \u00b110.4 months in patients who received autologous SCT, 25.1\u00b122.2 months in patients who received related BMT/ PBSCT, 13.8\u00b16.7 months in patients who received unrelated BMT, and 10.5\u00b15.8 months in patients who received CBT. The durations of IgG < 500mg/dl after SCT were 14.9\u00b111.5 months in all patients, 15.8\u00b19.7 months in patients with hematologic malignancies, 11.6\u00b15.1 months in patients with hematologic disorders, 11.0\u00b18.7 months in patients with solid tumor, 19.0\u00b118.6 months in patients who received autologous SCT, 12.0\u00b18.3 months in patients who received related BMT/PBSCT, 11.5\u00b15.7 months in patients who received unrelated BMT, and 15.9\u00b18.7 months in patients who received CBT. There was a significantly higher incidence of community-acquired infection from 6 months after SCT. There were significant differences in the incidence of community-acquired infections between patients with CD4-positive cell counts of < 500/ml and Background: Allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (allo-HCT) has the potential to cure subgroups of patients with multiple myeloma (MM) but its role is controversial due to high transplant-related mortality. While autologous HCT is well established as consolidation after induction therapy using novel agents, allo-HCT is still considered experimental due to excessive early toxicity.Methods: We retrospectively studied 45 MM patients (pts) ; 25 (55,6%) were males with a median age of 52 years (range: 32-60), who underwent allo-HSCT in our center between 2007 and 2018.Median time between diagnosis and allo-HCT was 40 months (range: 20-143).Results: The International Staging System (ISS) was ISS I (33,3%), ISS II (28,9%), and ISS III (37,8%). Twentyeight (62,2%) pts received cells from unrelated donor and 17 pts from identical siblings. Stem cell source were: peripheral blood (n=25) and bone marrow (n=20). Grouprisk distribution using HCT-CI and PAM index can be seen in figure 1. Response was evaluated at day +100: CR (53,3%), VGPR (11,1%), PR (22,2%) and SD (2,2%); response was not evaluated in 5 pts. Regarding hospitalization, 11 (24,4%) pts and 22 (48,9%) pts needed readmission in the first 100 days and 365 days post-alloHCT, respectively, and median days of hospitalization was 27 days (range: 4-92). Reasons for first re-admission were: infection (68,2%), GvHD (27,3%) and renal insufficiency (4,5%). Twenty-seven (60%) died and death causes were: infection (35,6%), progression (15,6%), secondary tumor (4,4%) and the remainder, GvHD and intracranial hemorrhage. In addition, 26 pts (57,8%) suffered cytomegalovirus (CMV) reactivation.Median overall survival (OS) was 44 months (range: 11-76). Univariate analysis showed that re-admission in first 100 days (HR 4, 19; p=0, 001) , re-admission in first 365 days (HR 3, 6; p=0, 001) , CMV reactivation (HR 2,38; p=0,038), ISS (ISS-I vs ISS-II and III; HR 0,347; p=0,033), days of hospitalization in the first 100 days and response at +100 day (CR plus VGPR vs the remainder; HR 0,143; p=0,04) were predictor factors for OS. Other factors like karyotype, response before allo-HCT, HLA-mismatch or baseline CMV serostatus, among others, do not impact on OS.Median OS in pts with low HCT-CI were 56 months (range: 0-156) vs 6 months in intermediate-high HCT-CI Background: Allo-SCT is a potentially curative therapy for patients with multiple myeloma as it provides a graftversus-myeloma effect and a myeloma-free graft. Due to increased NRM and unclear OS benefit the recent guidelines suggested allo-SCT to be used in context of clinical trials focusing on the high-risk patients and those who relapsed early after autograft. Reduced-intensity conditioning regimens may improve rate of NRM; however, optimal conditioning regimen is still to be determined. Here we studied conditioning regimen with 3 alkylating agents consisting of thiotepa (TT), busulfan (Bu) and GvHD prophylaxis with post-transplant cyclophosphamide (post-Cy) in high risk myeloma patients relapsing after autograft.Methods: A total of 40 patients (m, n=23) with median age of 55 years (range 40-67) underwent an allo-SCT (MUD, n=19; MRD, n=12; MMUD, n=6, haploidentical, n=3) during a period from 2014 to 2018 in University of Hamburg. The majority of patients had advanced disease (stage IIIAB, 73%) and high-risk cytogenetics (56%). The median response durartion after autograft was 1.8 years (range 0.5-8. 3 ). The conditioning included TT (cum. dosage 10mg/kg), Bu (median cum. dosage 9.6mg/kg i.v. or 6.4 mg/kg in elderly patients) and post-Cy (cum. dosage 100mg/kg, day +3 and +4). Eight patients (all of them received allografts from MMUD or haploidentical donors) received additionally fludarabine (FLU, cum. dosage of Background: The overall incidence of active CMV infection in patients with multiple myeloma (MM) receiving Background: Several scoring systems have been developed to estimate outcomes in MDS patients who undergo AlloHCT. However, none of them have been specifically validated in T cell depleted grafts. The aim of this study is to investigate the prognostic ability of a recently published scoring system (SFGM-TC) in a cohort of patients with MDS who underwent TCD transplants.Methods: 109 patients underwent a first TCD AlloHCT for MDS from 2007 to 2018. The SFGM-TC score (Caulier et al. Curr Res Transl Med. 2018 ) is performed at day 100 and ranges from 0-8, discriminating low (0), intermediate (1) (2) (3) , and high risk (4-8). Additional analyses were performed at day 180 and day 365. A landmark analysis was done at each time point for the day 100, 180, and 365 analyses, respectively. Background: Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is the only curative procedure for the treatment of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), but among several limiting factors for its accomplishment, such as the patient\u00b4s performance status, is a very relevant issue, i.e., the availability of a compatible HLA donor and, when available, very often the donor\u00b4s age and comorbidities also constitute factors that hinder this medical conduct. Considering this scenario, the possibility of a haploidentical transplantation (HT) has emerged as an option. In Latin America, HT has been included as a treatment option since 2014. Since then, these patients have been included in the Latin American Registry of Transplantation in Myelodysplastic Syndrome, making it possible to analyze the viability and results of these transplants.Methods: From October 2012 to October 2018, seventeen (17) patients were transplanted with a haploidentical donor and included in the Latin American Registry. None of these patients had an identical HLA (8/8 match) related or unrelated donor. Data were obtained from the Latin American Registry of HSCT in MDS. The statistical analyses were performed using the software SPSS, version 23.1 and Graphpad Prism version 5.0, with significance being set at p < 0.05.Results: Table 1 shows the patients and their characteristics. All donors were haploidentical. There was a predominance of reduced intensity conditioning, which was performed in 13 patients (76.5%), whereas the others received the myeloablative conditioning. Cell source was peripheral blood in 10 (58.8%) and bone marrow in 7 (41.2%) of the patients. Graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis in post-HSCT was carried out with cyclophosphamide 50mg / kg on D+3 and D+5, cyclosporin from D0 and mycophenolate from D+1. Complete hematologic recovery was achieved in 16 (94.1%) patients. The incidence of grade II-IV acute GVHD was 11.7%, whereas chronic GVHD was 5.8%. One death occurred due to graft failure and none of the patients showed autologous recovery. Three other patients died. One on D+210 due to a fungal infection, the second on D+90 due to sinusoidal obstruction syndrome and a third on D+61 due to pneumonia caused by Pseudomonas. Regarding overall complications, there was a predominance of mucositis (47%), overall infections (35.2%) and reactivated CMV in 23.5% of cases. Of the total number of living patients, 8 (47%) achieved complete remission and 5 (29.4%) showed disease relapse. The mean follow-up was 39 months (ranging from 5 to 72 months). The lowest probability of disease-free survival at 3 years was 79% (95% CI: 71.48 -88.51).Background: Relapse is the most important cause of failure after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) for FLT3-ITD-positive acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Treatment with FLT3 tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) constitutes a promising clinical approach to induce remission without conventional chemotherapy.Methods: A 50 year-old woman diagnosed with AML secondary to myelodisplastic syndrome (MDS) with NPM1 mutation and internal tandem duplications of the FLT3 gene (FLT3-ITD) in October 2013. After achieving complete remission (CR) with conventional chemotherapy, she received a HLA sibling allogenic-HSCT in February 2014, with BuCy. Four months later, AML relapsed only at medullary level (FLT3 ratio: 0,67 %), treated with chemotherapy and donor lymphocytes infusions (DLI). She achieved 2 nd CR and developed limited chronic graft-versushost disease (cGVHD). Nine months later (April 2015), she suffered the first extramedullary relapse only, breast and skin. Disappearance of the lesions at all levels was achieved with chemo and radiotherapy. She always had full hematologic donor chimerism.In December 2015, she referred atypical precordial pain irradiated to the back. Cardiac MRI was performed and several masses were visualized in the pericardial sac, up to 5 cm in diameter. BM remained in CR with full donor chimerism.Pericardial fluid showed massive infiltration by leukemic-FLT3 positive cells (ratio: 0,7%). She was not considered Background: TA-TMA is a severe complication that can reduce survival after HSCT. Risk factors have been variably reported in adults although data on children remains scarce. We aimed to identify a risk profile for development of TA-TMA in children undergoing HSCT.Methods: We retrospectively reviewed clinical charts of 398 children who underwent 406 HSCTs between 2013-16: at Great Ormond Street Hospital (GOSH) and the Great North Children's Hospital (GNCH). TA-TMA was defined according to revised criteria (Jodele et al. 2013) . Risk factors were categorized into patient derived [age, gender, active co-morbidity at D0 of HSCT (uncontrolled viral/ bacterial or fungal infection, pulmonary, cardiovascular instability, steroid therapy >0.3mg/kg beyond D0, BCGiosis or autoimmune disease), transplant related factors (conditioning intensity, stem cell source, HLA-matching, use of Ciclosporin A (CSA) or Tacrolimus (Tac), CD34+ dose, ex-vivo T cell depletion, use of Defibrotide) and post-HSCT factors (aGvHD, post-HSCT viral reactivation, venoocclusive disease (VOD) and occurrence of posterior reversible leukoencephalopathy (PRES).Results: At a median of 7 months post-HSCT, TA-TMA occurred among 21/406 transplants (5.1%). There was no reported centre variation (5.7% vs 4.6% in GOSH vs GNCH; p=0.6). Gender, underlying disease -primary immune deficiency (PID) (n=273) vs haematological disease (n=133), use of myeloablative (n=153) vs reducedor minimal intensity conditioning (n=229), use of serotherapy or mega doses of CD34 \u226510 X10*6/Kg did not influence the development of TA-TMA. Donor type: MSD/ MFD(n=100) vs MUD (n=129) vs MMUD/Haplo-HSCT Background: We evaluated the outcome of haploidentical HCT (HHCT) using ex vivo \u03b1\u03b2 T cell-depleted (TCD) grafts after reduced-intensity conditioning (RIC) containing low-dose TBI (LD-TBI) in pediatric patients with acute leukemia (AL) in complete remission (CR).Methods: Between May 2012 and October 2018, 36 patients with acute leukemia (17 ALL and 19 AML) in CR received haploidentical hematopoietic cell transplantation (HHCT) using TCR\u03b1\u03b2-depleted graft at Asan Medical Center Children's Hospital. Eighteen patients received HHCT between 2012 and 2015 (earlier time period) and the remaining 18 between 2016 and 2018 (recent study period). The conditioning regimens, the dose of \u03b1\u03b2+ T cells and GVHD prophylaxis are summarized in Table. Results: All 36 patients achieved a sustained neutrophil engraftment at a median of 10 days (range, 9-13) . Of 36 patients, 11 patients (8 ALL & 4 AML) relapsed at a median of 6 months (range, 3-16) after transplant. Of the 11 patients, 10 patients died of disease. One patient died of disseminated tuberculosis at 11 months after transplant, leading to the TRM of 4% at 1 year. As of December 2018, 25 of the 36 patients survive free of disease at a median follow-up of 21 months (range, . At a median followup of 35 months (range, 1-80), EFS and OS at 2 years for all patients were 59% and 67%, respectively. Outcome of HHCT in the recent study cohort was significantly better than that in the earlier study period (EFS of 85% vs EFS of 44%, P=0.05). Among the 17 patients with ALL, the EFS of 8 patients, who received HHCT in early time period after conditioning with TBI of 600 cGy, was significantly worse than that of 9 patients, who received in recent study period after a higher dose of TBI at 800cGy (13% vs 83%, P< 0.05). The EFSs of AML were similar between the two study groups (70% for earlier cohort vs 86% for recent study, P>0.05).Conclusions: In pediatric patients with acute leukemia in CR, our current haploidentical HCT using ex vivo \u03b1\u03b2 TCD graft after RIC containing LD-TBI without GVHD prophylaxis is feasible approach with a low TRM. The Background: Anti-HLA antibodies (aHAb) have been recently recognized as an important risk factor for graft failure (GF), especially in HLA-haploidentical stem cell transplantation (haplo-HSCT). Although, recently, EBMT consensus guidelines have been published [Ciurea, Bone Marrow Transplant 2018] , experience in pediatric T-cell depleted (TCD, another well-known risk factor for GF) haplo-HSCT is lacking. In the present study, we report our experience on the use of a desensitization approach based on EBMT guidelines.Methods: Between June 2017 and August 2018, all patients affected by non-malignant diseases and scheduled for a transplant from an HLA-haploidentical donor after negative depletion of \u03b1\u03b2 T and B cells as previously described [Li Pira, Biol Blood Marrow Transplant. 2016 ], were tested for aHAb with Luminex\u00ae solid-phase immunoassay (One Lambda, Thermo Fisher Scientific) 1 month before the HSCT. All patients with a MFI higher than 5000, which is considered a cutoff predicting for GF, were treated with a desensitization protocol based on the use of anti-CD20 rituximab (375 mg/m 2 before and immediately after the end of plasma-exchange cycle) and plasma-exchange (PE) \u00b1 infusion of irradiated buffy coat (BC) (if after PE aHAb MFI was still > 5000 MFI). This latter was obtained by the non-target fraction of the \u03b1\u03b2 T-cell/B-cell-depletion procedure and consisted of 5 * 10 7 irradiated nucleated cells/kg of the recipient; this was infused 2-4 hours before the infusion of the TCD graft. PE was performed with Miltenyi Life 18 TM Apheresis Unit (Miltenyi, Bergish-Gladback) .Results: In the study period, 37 patients received \u03b1\u03b2 Tand B-cell depleted haplo-HSCT. Eighteen (48%) resulted positive for aHAb (MFI> 1000); 14 (77%) of them had an MFI > 5000 for either anti-class I or II aHAb. These patients (see Table I Background: Osteonecrosis (ON) is a debilitating complication in survivors of allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT). Limited data is available on its course post-transplantation in children. The purpose of our study was to identify recipients of HCT in whom pre-and post-magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is indicated.Methods: The retrospective cohort consisted of 436 patients who underwent first allogeneic HCT from 1998-2014, and prospectively underwent a total of 1092 pre-and post-transplant MRI studies of the hips and knees done annually for 3 years regardless of symptoms. Surviving patients were followed for a median time of 8.33 (range 3.93-14.10) years. Cases of ON were compared to controls matched for age, sex, transplant type, and follow up in a 1:4 ratio for the following variables: ethnicity, underlying disease, ON pre-HCT, conditioning regimen, graft source, bone mineral density Z-scores, body mass index, presence or absence of graft-versus-host disease, steroid use and dosage, and survival status.Results: Thirty (6.9%) patients had MRI findings confirming ON post-HCT. All patients with ON except one were more than 10 years of age. Twenty (67%) patients were male. ON pre-HCT (P < 0.0001) was the only factor associated with presence of ON post-HCT. Epiphyseal ON was seen in 9 (30%) patients pre-HCT, and 26 (87%) post-HCT. Eighteen (60%) patients had involvement of more than 30% of articular surface, and were more likely to undergo surgery (P = 0.009).Conclusions: The incidence of ON in this large pediatric cohort was 7%. The only risk factor for ON post-HCT was pre-existing ON. MRI evaluation for ON pre-HCT is indicated in all patients. MRI evaluation for ON post-HCT is only indicated for patients with ON pre-HCT and symptomatic patients. This will entail cost savings of USD 500,000 per 100 surviving allogeneic HCT patients per year. Patients with more than 30% involvement of the articular surface need close follow up.Clinical Trial Registry: None Disclosure: None",

            "text": "Impact of rabbit anti thymocyte globulin exposure on immune reconstitution and outcome after stem cell transplantation in children Background: Rabbit anti thymocyte globulin (rATG) has been frequently used for many years as GvHD prophylaxis in pediatric stem cell transplantation. Precise dosing regimens are crucial but remain challenging due to several pharmacological characteristics in children.Methods: rATG levels were measured in pediatric patients undergoing allogeneic stem cell transplantation after obtaining approval by the local IRB and informed consent by legal guardians. 32 pediatric patients who received either Thymoglobuline\u2122 (n=22) or Grafalon\u2122 (ATG-F) (n=10) as part of their conditioning regimen Background: Obesity among children is a growing health problem. malnutrition or being over-weight can be of prognostic impact among children who need HSCT.Scientific literature shows a lot of controversy in terms of effect of BMI at the time of infusion on the outcome of HSCT.Methods: We reviewed data of patients who underwent HSCT at King Faisal Specialist Hospital & Research Centre between 2010-2016 to correlate BMI with the outcome and complications of HSCT. Transplant na\u00efve recipients with age at infusion between 2-14 years who received HSCT from matched related donor or autologous HSCT, were included in the dataset for analysis. A total of 423 patients' profiles were reviewed of whom 51.1% were boys. Median age at transplant was 7.5 years. Primary indication of disease was malignancy in 41.6% followed by hemoglobinopathies 26.7%, bone marrow failures 17.3% and immune disorders 12.5%. Solid tumors accounted for 29.5% among malignant disorders. Myeloablative conditioning was used in 97.2% transplants with 11.8% regimens containing total body irradiation. Majority of the patients 81.3% underwent allogeneic transplantation using BM as the source in 80.4% and PBSC in the remaining 19.6% cases. Donor was HLA-Identical Sibling in 89%, parents in 10.2% and others in the remaining 0.9% patients. Median TNC Dose was 2.55 X 10^9 and CD34 was 5.63 X 10^6 per Kg of the body weight at the time of infusion. Age and gender specific BMI percentiles were obtained and classified according to the definition of centers for disease control and prevention (CDC); 24.8% (105) recipients were categorized as Under-Weight, 61.2% (259) Normal, 5.9% (25) Over-Weight and remaining 8% (34) as Obese.Results: Based on chimeric studies at Day-100, our engraftment rate was 98.3% (400) out of 407 evaluable cases. Median time to neutrophil recovery was 14-days from infusion and 26-days for platelets. No statistically significant difference was found for engraftment rate on D-100 as it was 100% (25) among 98.8% (247) in Normal, 97% (97) in Under-Weight and 96.9% (31) in the Obese (P-Value: 0.467). Median time to neutrophil recovery from the infusion date was 15-days in Over-weight patients and 14 in the remaining three groups (P-Value: 0.841). Acute Graft vs. Host Disease (aGvHD) of any grade at Day-100 was recorded in 19.9% (84). Any-grade aGvHD was more common in Over-Weight 24% (6), followed by Obese with 23.5% (8), 21% (22) in Under-weight and 18.6% (48) in Normal BMI-category (P-Value: 0.770). Chronic GvHD was more frequent in Over-Weight (14.3%, 3), compared to 9) Background: Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is the standard treatment for children with severe aplastic anemia (SAA) who have HLA-identical related donor. There is no standard conditioning regimen for children with SAA secondary to non-fanconi anemia (FA) constitutional bone marrow failure syndromes such as telomeropathies. We report the outcome of a consistent reduced intensity conditioning regimen in patients with idiopathic SAA or inherited bone marrow failure syndromes other than FA who underwent HLA matched related HSCT Methods: children with SAA underwent HSCT using the following conditioning regimen: fludarabine 175mg/m2, cyclophosphamide 80 mg/m2, and ATG (thymoglobulin) (10 mg/kg) . GVHD prophylaxis included cyclosporin and mycophenolate mofetil. Donors were all matched related and bone marrow was the stem cell source. All patients had normal chromosomal fragility testResults: a total of 18 children with SAA underwent HSCT, 12 females and 6 males. Average age was 8.1 (range 0.8-13.8 years). All nine patients who were tested for telomere length had short telomeres. Pathogenic or likely pathogenic mutations were reported in 5 patients (2 ERCC6L2, 1 ANKRD26, 1 TINF2, 1 LZTFL1). All donors had normal physical examination, normal CBC, and negative genetic testing if patient mutation is known. All 18 patients engrafted successfully, median time to neutrophil engraftment was 16 (range, 11-29 days) and platelet engraftment 19 (range, 13-45 days). Median infused nucleated cell dose was 3.3 (range,0.9-7.3 X10 8 /kg) and CD34 cell dose was 6.7 (range, 1.1-13.1 X10 6 /kg). None of our patients had acute GVHD and one patient had mild classic chronic GVHD of the skin that was controlled with topical therapy for a short period. Three patients had secondary graft failure in the first-year post transplant. First patient had pancytopenia with loss of donor chimerism and underwent successful second transplant using fludarabine, ATG, and melphalan. The second patient had a nonfunctioning graft despite full donor chimerism suggesting that the related donor might be affected and had silent phenotype. The third patient had homozygous ERCC6L2 mutation and developed progressive cytopenia with myelodysplastic features few months post-transplant and subsequently underwent myeloablative matched unrelated transplant using busulfan, fludarabine, thiotepa and ATG. However, the patient progressed to have acute myeloid leukemia six months post HSCT. Fifteen patients (83%) have normal CBC and stable donor chimerism. Median follow-up duration of 1140 days (range 330 -2595 days). One patient with LZTFL1 mutation developed chronic renal impairment five years post HSCT.Conclusions: HSCT using lower dose cyclophosphamide (80mg/kg) as part of fludarabine based regimen was safe and effective in SAA patients with shorter telomeres and described genetic abnormalities. Optimal conditioning regimen in ERCC6L2-associated bone marrow failure needs to be defined. Larger study is needed to confirm our results.Clinical Trial Registry: Not applicable Disclosure: Nothing to declare",

            "text": "Late effects in patients with hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis treated with hematopoietic stem cell transplantation: A review of the literature Background:Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) is an inherited or acquired disorder of immunedysregulation. Early diagnosis and immunosuppressive treatment can prevent significant organ-failure. The inherited forms, and some acquired cases can only be cured by hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). With modern transplant practices, a significant number of patients survive. The purpose of this literature review was to collect data on the frequency and type of late effects in HLH patients surviving after HSCT and to examine the association with pre-existing HLH conditions (eg. involvement of the central nervous system (CNS) before transplant) and with the pre-transplant conditioning regimens.Methods: The MEDLINE, EMBASE, Web of Science and PubMed databases were searched, by two librarians at the Karolinska Institutet, between May and September 2016 according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-analysis (PRISMA) statement. The search terms included \"HLH\", \"FHL\", \"MAS\", multiple terms for \"HSCT\" and late-effect conditions. Inclusion criteria were publications in English that included children between January 1995 and May 2016. Authors of this review screened all the abstracts of studies against the inclusion criteria.Results: Only nine papers published between 2006 and 2016, with information on late effects in HLH patients who had undergone HSCT, were identified. Three reports include only small numbers of HLH patients. The remaining 6 papers contain data on 261 long-term survivors with a median follow-up of 5.4 years. Five papers address neurological sequelae with a reported incidence from 7-57%. The highest incidence was found after a thorough neurological assessment of 21 HLH patients compared to matched sibling controls. However, the association with CNS disease before transplant and age at transplant was not clear. Patients with EBVassociated HLH seem to have fewer long-term neurological problems. Non-neurological late effects are described in 4 papers only, with endocrinological problems, namely short stature, being the most frequent. One paper specifically analyzed poor growth, thyroid dysfunction and vitamin D deficiency in a cohort of patients with non-malignant disorders including HLH who had undergone HSCT after a reduced intensity conditioning regimen and found significant abnormalities in all groups.Conclusions: Data on late effects in HLH patients is scarce and is mostly based on the retrospective evaluation of small national cohorts. The available information indicates that a significant number of patients suffers from problems which affect their daily life, but lack of information does not allow to analyze the association between pre-transplant conditions and long-term sequelae. Therefore, a retrospective comprehensive analysis of patients registered in the EBMT and CIBMTR registries is currently performed. It will be crucial to better define the frequency and type of late effects in a large cohort. This knowledge will aid counselling prior to HSCT, provide guidance for long-term monitoring of these patients, and potentially identify specific risk factors for late effects in this rare patient population.Disclosure: Nothing to declare.",

At the same time, the quality of life in patients in the long-term after HSCT significantly differs from the quality of life of healthy people of the same age. Deformations in psychosexual development including problems in the gender identity formation cause social isolation of adolescents, which makes their sexual selfrealization impossible and significantly reduces the quality of their life. The purpose of our study was an assessment of the level of gender identity formation of adolescents and psychosexual development correlation to the normal adolescents of the same age.Methods: In a prospective single-center study in 2018, on the base of the Department of Rehabilitation Medicine Raisa Gorbacheva Memorial Institute of Children\u00b4s Oncology, Hematology and Transplantation, we conducted a study of 17 families. The respondents were: 1) parents / guardians of patients accompanying them in the process of examination; 2) adolescents who underwent HSCT treatment and undergo planned examinations at the clinic in the posttransplant period (after D + 100), (n = 17, of which 8 girls and 9 boys, age 12 -17 years, from the date of HSCT 1 -5 years).The following methods were used to assess gender identity: Specially developed questionnaires for teenagers and parents; questionnaire by Sandra L. Bem (Sandra L. Bem, 1974) ; projective techniques \"The Human Picture\", \"The non-existent animal\"; Max L\u00fcscher\u00b4s color choices test.Results: The traditional type of gender identity, which characterizes high masculinity among male respondents and high female gender indicators in 100% of cases, was not revealed. Both among girls and among boys, the androgynous type prevails with a tendency toward femininity.On average, adolescents see themselves as a bit more courageous than their mothers, with rare exceptions, regardless of gender. This confirms the thesis that we received in a previous study that parents tend to see and encourage complacency of adolescents of both sexes, passivity instead of leadership, dedication and independence. All 100% of adolescents who participated in the test demonstrate a shift in the theme of aggression, 77% have some signs of preventing sexual self-determination, abandoning their body, gender, and age. 88% of patients do not communicate with their peers. In 47% of them, negative emotions prevail over positive ones. One third of the test participants demonstrate strong support for rest and minimizing their efforts.Conclusions: The characteristics of family upbringing of adolescents who have undergone HSCT often contribute significantly to limiting their social experience and lead to specific deformities of individuality, including in the sphere of gender identity. We consider advisable to introduce thematic group counseling of parents within the framework of the \"Patient's School\" in psychological treatment support in the clinic. Early diagnosis of the personal aspects of the psychosexual development of adolescents after HSCT allows for timely identification of individual problems in this area and identification of general trends in the long term after HSCT.Disclosure: All authors -nothing to disclose.",

Histologically characterized as undifferentiated small round cell tumors, all are similarly aggressive, have a tendency to disseminate throughout central nervous system and very poor prognosis. We tried to assess the effectiveness of tandem highdose chemotherapy (HDCT) with autologous hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation (auto-HSCT) in this patient group. Methods: From 2010 to 2018, 52 infants under 48 months with different primary embryonal brain tumors such as medulloblastoma (N=28), different PNET NOS (N=10), pineoblastoma (N=3), atypical teratoid rhabdoid tumor (N=3), ETMR (N=8) after surgical resection and induction chemotherapy were planned to receive tandem HDCT with auto-HSCT. Nine patients were conducted only single transplantation because of the development of lifethreatening complications after the first HDCT (N=4) or the emergence of early disease progression (N=5). At the moment of HDCT 31 patients were in complete remission (CR), 20 patients were in partial remission (PR) and 1 patient had stable disease (SD). The conditioning regimen for tandem auto-HSCT were: the first HDCT was carboplatin and etoposide, the second was thiotepa and cyclophosphamide, both with intraventricular methotrexate.Results: The median follow-up is 24 months (range, 6-85). The median time to engraftment after the first auto-HSCT was Background: A series of findings suggest that optimizing natural killer (NK) cell reactivity could further improve outcome after allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (alloHCT). This could be achieved by killer cell immunoglobulin-like receptor (KIR) genotype informed donor selection. An enhanced Receptor-Ligand model which used KIR2DS1 and KIR3DL1 donor genotype information to augment NK cell activation and minimize inhibition demonstrated improved survival in one large AML study (Boudreau et al, JCO 2017) . Likewise, a second model built on the classification of centromeric and telomeric KIR haplotype motifs, also predicted mortality after alloHCT for AML (Cooley et al, Blood 2010) . This joint EBMT and CIBMTR study aimed at validating the two approaches in an independent cohort of patients with MDS or secondary AML.Methods: Donor samples were retrieved from the Collaborative Biobank (Dresden, Germany) and mapped to patient outcome data extracted from the EBMT and CIBMTR. Genotyping of all KIR genes by sequencing exons 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, and 9 was performed by high resolution amplicon-based next generation sequencing. The impact of the classifiers on time-to-event outcomes was tested in cause-specific Cox regression models adjusted for patient age, a modified disease risk index, performance status, donor age, HLA-match, sex match, CMV match, conditioning intensity, type of T-cell depletion and graft type.Results: Clinical data from 1704 patients and corresponding donor genotype information were analyzed. The median age at alloHCT was 59.4 years (range, 18.1 to 79.6 years). The indication for alloHCT was MDS for 72% and sAML for 28% of patients. Disease risk was low/intermediate and high/very high in 41% and 59%, respectively. Donors were 10/10 matched for 79% of patients. Myeloablative, reducedintensity and non-myeloablative conditioning regimens were used in 31%, 57%, and 12% of patients, respectively. Peripheral blood stem cells were the predominant graft source (93% of patients). ATG was administered in 56% and alemtuzumab in 9% of patients. During follow-up after alloHCT 776 patients died. In univariable and multivariable analyses of the whole cohort, overall survival and the cumulative incidence of relapse of patients with KIRadvantageous versus disadvantageous donors were not statistically significantly different. We could not replicate the pattern of outcomes predicted by the KIR3DL1/",

This points at the possibility of interactions between NK-cell mediated alloreactivity and disease type or procedural variations of alloHCT. Available information on KIR-genes, which have been sequenced but not yet analysed, will be investigated in exploratory analyses.Disclosure: The authors have nothing to disclose In the absence of an alternative donor, it is recommended that patients undergo desensitization therapy, especially with high DSA levels (>5,000 MFI). The aim of this study is to analyze the impact of DSA on risk of GF and poor graft function (PGF), and on major outcomes in a consecutive cohort of patients who were systematically screened for DSA before Haplo-SCT. Methods: 141 consecutive patients were candidates for unmanipulated Haplo-SCT with post-transplant Cyclophosphamide (PT-Cy) at our center from January 2012 to January 2018 and 135 were analyzed for the presence of HLA antibodies.Results: 134 patients underwent haplo-SCT. HLA antibodies were detected in 40 patients,19 of them were DSA, while 21 were non-DSA (NDSA). 10 patients out of 19 with DSA were transplanted using the same donor; 2 underwent a desensitization program before transplant.Background: A recent study from EBMT comparing matched sibling (MSD) versus haploidentical donors transplantations, showed better outcome with MSD in adult patients with intermediate risk AML in first remission (CR1). However, a female donor to a male recipient transplant combination is a poor prognostic factor and this study did not address the question whether in this situation, a haploidentical donor transplant might do better. The present study compared the outcomes of allografted male patients according to whether they received stem cells from a female MSD or a haploidentical donor, in the intermediate and high risk cytogenetics groups (MRC classification).Methods: The study included 1066 male patients with cytogenetics transplanted between January 2007 and June 2017 and reported to EBMT. 834 received stem cells from a MSD female donor and 232 from a haploidentical donor (133 male and 99 female). The follow up was 25 months (12-62). We studied separately intermediate and high risk patients. Multivariate analysis was adjusted on factors differing significantly between the 2 groups.Results: 1-Intermediate risk group: 638 male patients received a female MSD and 160 a haploidentical transplant. The distribution of group characteristics was even except that in the haploidentical transplant group, donors were younger (39 y versus 51; p< 0.0001), marrow was more frequently used (45% versus 17%, p< 0.0001) and the interval from diagnosis to transplant was longer (5.4 versus 4.5 months, p< 0.0001). By univariate analysis at two years post transplant, cumulative incidence (CI) of NRM post haplo was higher (26% versus 15%, p=0.002) and CI of extensive chronic GVH lower (14% versus 27%; p=0.002). LFS post MSD and post haplo were 64% and 51% (p=0.03), OS 69% and 60% (NS), GRFS (43% and 43%). By multivariate analyses the only significant poor risk factors were the haplo-identical transplant for NRM (HR: 1.7 (1.1-2-61)) and the patient age for OS (HR: 1.15 (1.02-1.28; p=0.02). Haploidentical transplantation resulted in less chronic GVHD (HR: 0.43 (0.29-0.64); p < 10 -4 ), but a lower LFS (HR: 1.7 (1.1-2.61); p=0.04). 2-High risk group: 196 male patients received a female MSD and 72 a haploidentical transplant. In the haploidentical group, donors were younger (38 y versus 54; p< 0.0001), marrow was more frequently used (42% versus 11%, p< 0.0001) and the interval from diagnosis to transplant was longer (5.1 versus 4.3 months, p= 0.003). By multivariate analysis, haploidentical transplants were associated with a lower relapse incidence (HR: 0,40 (0.21-0.75; p = 0.004),a better LFS (HR: 0,46 (0.28-0.77; p = 0.003),OS (HR: 0,43 (0.25-0.75; p = 0.003), and GRFS (HR: 0,53 (0.34-0.84; p = 0.006)(see figure) . The only other significant prognostic factor was patient age.Conclusions: This study shows that in a male patient with intermediate risk AML, a genoidentical sister donor remains associated with a better LFS. In contrast, in a male patient with high risk AML in CR1, a haploidentical donor may be a better choice than an HLA genoidentical sister.Disclosure: Nothing to declare P663 Abstract already published.",

Therapeutic options for relapse after first allogeneic stem cell transplant (1st HSCT) include chemotherapy followed by donor lymphocyte infusion or second allo-HSCT (2nd HSCT) from the original donor or change to another donor. However, there is unclear outcome for different treatment approach. In this retrospective cohort study, we aim to compare the clinical outcome after different treatment strategy for relapse after first Allo-HSCT.Methods: Between 1992 Jan and 2018 Oct, 1493 consecutive patients receiving 1 st HSCT registered to the BMT database in National Taiwan University Hospital were analyzed. Among them, 580 cases had relapsed after first Allo-HSCT. One hundred and three patients who received no treatment after relapse or with incomplete data were excluded. Their transplant data was collected following the EBMT Registry data collection forms and manuals. Overall survival rate and progression free survival rate were performed by the Kaplan-Meier method. Univariate and multivariate analysis were performed using Cox proportional hazard regression model.Results: Of the 477 patients who experienced relapse after 1 st HSCT, total 244 patients (51%) received chemotherapy followed by DLI or 2 nd HSCT from the same donor (no change group), 36 patient (8%) received chemotherapy followed by 2 nd HSCT from different donors (change group), and 197 (41%) had conventional chemotherapy alone. The patients in \"change group\" were younger (median age 29 vs 37, p = .02), and had more patients achieving complete remission (CR) prior to 2 nd HSCT (44% vs 10%, p = < .01) than patients in \"no change group\". After the 2 nd HSCT, the CR was 68% for \"no change group\" and 91% for \"change group\". The progression-free survival at 3-year and 5-year were 10.5% and 5.9% (Fig 1A, p = .0438%), respectively, for \"no change group\" and 9.4% and 9.4%, respectively, for \"change group\". While the overall survival (OS) at 3-year and 5-year were 15.8% and 9% (Fig 1B, p = .3459%), respectively, for \"no change group\" and 13.5% and 9%, respectively, for \"change group\". Those who achieved CR prior to 2 nd HSCT had a trend of better OS than those without CR (17.5% vs 8.7% at 3-year; 8.7% vs 9.1% at 5year, p =.0365)( Fig 1C) . There were 1 cases survived for more than 10 years in \"change donor group\" and 6 cases survived more than 10 years in \"no change group\". Only one had developed relapse after 2 nd HSCT but achieved subsequent remission again.Conclusions: Our study shows that change donor had similar poor outcome comparing to those using the same donor after the 1 st HSCT. Patients who achieved CR before 2nd HSCT had a trend of better OS than those without remission and the long-term survivors were only those who achieved CR prior to 2 nd HSCT. Novel therapy for CR induction would be warrant for this poor prognostic population.Disclosure: Nothing to declare",

Various donor options are available for the patient who lacks an HLA-matched sibling donor, such as unrelated donors (URD) and HLA-mismatched family (haploidentical) donors. In order to discover the exact role of transplantation type, there are many retrospective analysis, which compared these donor sources, have been reported. Recent studies showed some promising results of haploidentical donor transplantation (HIDT) using post-transplant cyclophosphamide in comparison with unrelated donor. The goal of this study was to compare the outcome of allo-SCT from haploidentical versus matched unrelated (MUD 10/10) or mismatched unrelated donor at a single HLA-locus (MMUD 9/10) for patients with acute leukemia in remission.Methods: Ninety-six adult (18-65 years) patients with acute leukemia in first or second remission who underwent allogeneic transplantation with a minimum 100 days follow-up at Florence Nightingale Hospital Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation Center between 2011 and 2017 were included in this study. Patient characteristics and medical records of all patients were reviewed retrospectively. Thirty-eight patients who received haploidentical donor transplantation were compared with 23 patients receiving a MUD 10/10 and 35 receiving a MMUD 9/10. Patients who completed minimum 100 days post-transplantation follow-up were identified as eligible for survival analysis.Results: The characteristics of the patients and transplant donors in this study are summarized in Table 1 . Median age of patients was 39.4\u00b114 years. Proportion of male patients was 39.1%, 74.2% and 57.8% for MUD 10/ 10, MMUD 9/10 and HIDT groups, respectively, which is significantly different (p=0.02). The other baseline factors were similar, including patient age, donor age, recipient cytomegalovirus (CMV) status, donor CMV status, graft versus host disease incidence, median neutrophil and platelet engraftment times and disease status at post-transplant 100 th day. No significant difference was identified in survival analysis among the MUD 10/10, MMUD 9/10 and HIDT groups, even if they were classified according to primary disease (AML vs ALL) and pre-transplant disease status (CR1 vs CR2). Also, donor CMV status (CMV IgG positivity or negativity) was not an important factor on survival analysis when compared between these three groups (p=0.406).Conclusions: In our study population, clinical outcomes of HIDT patients were inferior to MUD 10/10 and MMUD 9/10 groups. When choosing an alternative donor for patients without an available HLA-matched sibling, urgency of transplantation and host/donor features should be considered. We believe that HIDT might be a feasible alternative choice in this subset of patients.Disclosure: Nothing to declare P673 G-CSF primed bone marrow in HLA-haploidentical transplantation using post-transplantation cyclophosphamide (PTCY) could promote tolerance and further reduce risk of GVHD Nadira Durakovic 1,2 , Zinaida Peri\u0107 1,2 , Lana Desnica 2 , Ranka Serventi-Seiwerth 2 , Mirta Mikuli\u0107 2 , Brian Melamed 3 , Alen Ostoji\u0107 2 , Dra\u017een Pulani\u0107 1,2 , Pavle Ron\u010devi\u0107 2 , Zorana Grubi\u0107 2 , Radovan Vrhovac 1,2 implementation, development, and coordination of unique quality management systems with evaluation audits, intrahospital and international accreditation and certification processes. Quality of health care is a major focus for providers, patients, and accreditors; so, in this study, we aim to compare the quality of BM harvested at IPO-Collection Centre (ICC) with the quality of BM received from External Collection Centres (ECC) during these 6 last years.Methods: This retrospective evaluation included the number of total nucleated cells (TNC) requested by the Transplant Centre, the TNC collected, and the results of BM microbiological analysis performed; donor age, weight and infectious disease markers (IDM); patient demographics and diagnosis. BM collection technique in use at ICC was validated according to JACIE Standards.We consider successful a collection (SC) with TNC between 75 and 125% of the requested value, unsuccessful (UC) if lower than 75% and outstanding (OC) if over 125%.Results: A total of 106 BM was collected, 99 for allogenic (75 unrelated) and seven for autologous transplant; 21 unrelated BM were received from ECC (nine from Germany, seven from USA and five from Portugal). Patient main diagnosis were severe aplastic anaemia (n=28), acute myeloblastic leukaemia (n=20), and acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (n=15). Donors IDM were all negative and nonreactive.Mean age (\u00b1standard deviation, SD) was 33 (\u00b113.2) and 31 (\u00b19.3) years for ICC and ECC donors, respectively. At ICC, we were asked to collect an average (\u00b1SD) of 221.7*10 8 (\u00b1136.0) TNC while ECC were asked for 184.7*10 8 (\u00b1105.7). We collected 169.7*10 8 (\u00b182.3) and received 204.5*10 8 (\u00b1109.2) TNC. Correlation between requested and collected TNC was 0.69 at ICC and 0.56 for ECC.We had 41.2% SC and 26.8% OC meaning an accomplishment of 68.0%. We failed to collect required TNC in 32.0%. Although 85% of received BM fulfil TNC requirements, BM processing lowered this value to 55% due to erythrocyte removal (seven patients with major ABO incompatibility) and plasma reduction (two patients with ABO minor incompatibility). These steps reduce final TNC available for transplant. Weight difference between donor and patient had no significant impact on final TNC collection performance.Sixteen BM from ICC (seven Staphylococcus spp., five Propionibacterium acnesand fourCorynebacterium spp.) Background: Success of peripheral blood stem cell (PBSC) collections depends on patient biological parameters and stable apheresis device performance. Peripheral blood CD34+ cell enumeration is the most reliable predictive factor of apheresis yield however, there are some unexpectedly poor CD34+ cell harvests despite successful mobilization. The aim of the study was assess total collections CD34+ yields and factors influencing main apheresis procedure outcomes including collection efficiency (CE).Methods: Of 2233 consecutive donors covering the period 1-1-2016 to 30-9-2018 were analyzed for the following parameters: pre CD34 count, CD34 yield per procedure, total CD34 dose collected per patient, CD34 collection targets requested by clinical teams. The efficiency of PBSC procedures was determined by calculating the CE and the correlation coefficient between pre CD34 count and yield per procedure. CE was correlated to preprocedure WBC, platelet count, pre CD34 count and blood volume processed. All PBSC collections were performed by Optia Spectra across 7 units in UK.Results: Of the 2233 donors, 1611 were autologous and 622 allogeneic. The autologous donors underwent in total 2543 procedures. The median CD34 target dose for these donors was 4x10 6 /kg.799 (50%) achieved the target dose with 1 procedure and 566 (35%) with 2 procedures. The median pre CD34 count was 30/\u03bcl. The median CD34 yield per procedure was 2.54x10 6 /kg and the median total CD34 dose collected per donor was 5.38x10 6 /kg. 92 (5.7%) of autologous donors collected a total CD34 dose < 2x10 6 /kg, of those 27 (1.7%) had a pre CD34 count < 10/\u03bcl and 65 (4%) >10/\u03bcl.The allogeneic donors underwent in total 878 procedures. The median CD34 target dose for these donors was 5x10 6 / kg. 381 allogeneic donors (61%) achieved the target dose with 1 procedure and 221 (36%) with 2 procedures. The median pre CD34 count was 51/\u03bcl. The median CD34 yield per procedure was 4.07x10 6 /kg and the median of total CD34 dose collected per donor was 6.70x10 6 /kg. 17 (2.7) % of allogeneic donors collected a total CD34 dose < 2x10 6 / kg, of those 3 (0.5%) had a pre CD34 count < 10/\u03bcl and 14 (2.2 %) >10/\u03bcl. The median CE for autologous donors was 55% (range 20-166) and for allogeneic donors was 47% (range12-116). The CE was negatively correlated to WBC (r= -0.29 and -0.37) and platelet count (r=-0.14 and -0.06) for auto and allogeneic donors respectively, but did not correlate to the pre CD34 and blood volume processed. The correlation coefficient between pre CD34 count and CD34 yield per procedure was r 2 =0.67 for the autologous and r 2 =0.34 for the allogeneic collections.Conclusions: The majority of autologous and allogeneic donors achieved the target CD34 dose with one procedure. 94.3 % of autologous and 97.3 % allogeneic donors collected a transplantable CD34 dose of > 2x10 6 /kg. 4% of autologous and 2.7% of allogeneic donors did not collect a transplantable dose despite a preCD34 count of >10/\u03bcl indicating suboptimal procedure performance. The CE was variable and was negatively correlated to the preprocedure WBC and platelet count. The CE and correlation coefficient are lower in allogeneic donors compared to autologous donors.Disclosure: Nothing to declare",

Methods: As potential predictors of mobilization, age, sex, body weight, height, blood volume as well as white blood cell count, peripheral blood (PB) mononuclear cells, platelet count, hematocrit, and hemoglobin levels were considered. Two different evaluations of CD34+ cell counts were determined for each donor: baseline (before granulocyte colony-stimulating factor [G-CSF] administration) and in PB after G-CSF administration on day 4. A total of 122 consecutive HDs with a median age of 47.5 years were enrolled.Results: The median value of CD34+ on day 4 was 43 cells/\u03bcL (IQ 23-68). Basal WBC, Plt and basal CD34+, are significantly higher for group with CD34+ on the 4th day over the median than below. A multivariate quartile regression analysis, adjusted by gender, age, basal CD34 + and basal Plt, shows a, progressively steeper, relationship between baseline CD34+, basal Plt and CD34+ on the 4th day. The basal CD34+ cut-off for prevision of CD34+ on the 4th day was < =2 cells/\u03bcL and >=3 cells/\u03bcL whereas basal platelets count was < =229 x 109/L and >=230 x 109/L.Conclusions: G-CSF can be highly effective in HDs on the 4th day in order to collect enough number of stem cells and we have developed a model for predicting the probability to perform PBSC collection after a short course of G-CSF.Disclosure: nothing to declare P692 Pre-apheresis peripheral blood CD34+ cell counts highly correlates to actual stem cells collected Background: Prediction of stem cell yield on the basis of pre-apheresis CD34+ cell count and the processed blood volume is essential for the planning and executing of the apheresis process.Methods: Data analyzed included donor weight, complete blood count and CD34+ count on day of collection, total processed blood volume, CD34 + cell dose collected in the apheresis product and the number of aphereses performed. Using the method described by Pierelli et al, predicted CD34 + yields were calculated: Predicted CD34 + yield x 106/kg = (Benchmark CE x Volume of blood to be processed x peripheral CD34+ count per \u03bcl) / (Patient's weight in kg x metric conversion factor).Results: In 2017 we established the method described by Pierelli to predict the CD34+ cell yield. 323 allogenic aphereses were performed in 2017 with this approach. Mean processed volume was 13.71 Liters. The mean CD34+ peripheral count before apheresis was 68/ul, the mean collected CD34+count per kg bodyweight recipient was 6.35. Pearson\u00b4s correlation coefficient (r) between predicted yield using pre-apheresis CD34+count and actually collected CD34+ cells per kg bodyweight recipient was 0.967. The mean difference between predicted and collected cell dose was +4.45%.With knowledge of the predicted stem cell count, we were able to adjust apheresis procedure. In case of marginal predicted yield compared to the requested cell dose, we increased the blood volume to be processed. This proceeding led to a significant reduction of second day donations in 2017 by 38% compared to 2016. In only 3 cases we saw more than -40% lower CD34+ doses collected than initially predicted. All 3 donors showed mild iron deficiency with RBC microcytosis, a factor known to affect apheresis procedure.Conclusions: Pierellis method of calculating the stem cell yield shows a good correlation between pre-apheresis CD34 + count and actual collected stem cells, making planning and adjusting of the apheresis procedure more feasible and reliable. This proceeding led to significant reduction of second day donations. Attention should be paid to iron deficiency anemia, leading to lower than estimated CD34+ dose.[ Background: For more than a decade many transplant centers routinely collect and cryopreserve two or more peripheral blood stem cell (PBSC) grafts for a tandem and/ or salvage autologous blood stem cell transplantation (ABSCT) in patients with hemato-oncological diseases. However, subsequent high-dose chemotherapy (HD-CHT) and ABSCT is in many cases not performed for a variety of reasons, specifically in patients with AML, ALL, MPN and Burkitt lymphoma. Data about the actual utilization rate of the cryostored stem cell products are lacking.Methods: We retrospectively analyzed the collection, storage and disposal practices of PBSC products from a large cohort of patients who were treated at the University Hospital Heidelberg or at the University Medical Center Mannheim during a 12-year period. Disease entities included acute myeloid leukemia (AML, n=74), acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL, n=22), MPN (n=18; primary myelofibrosis [PMF], n=9; chronic myeloid leukemia [CML], n=7; secondary fibrosis/essential thrombocythemia [ET], n=1; not specified, n=1) and Burkitt lymphoma (n=18). Patients between 2001 and 2012 were included and followed until 2016.Results: An adequate stem cell graft was defined as \u22652.0 x10Exp6 CD34+ cells /kg body weight. 97% of the patients were able to collect at least one stem cell graft and the median number of grafts per patient was 1 (range 0-5). We could demonstrate that only 31% of all patients who had collected sufficient PBSCs for transplant subsequently underwent an ABSCT. Among the disease entities the actual use of the stored PBSC grafts varied considerably from 0% to 56% (Figure 1) .Conclusions: We could identify striking discrepancies between the collection/storage and actual utilization of Background: Biosimilars (BIO) of granulocyte colony stimulating factors (GCSF) were approved several years ago on the basis of some studies that indicated similar efficacy to the already patented GCSF (Neupogen\u00ae, NEU) both in terms of shortening the neutropenic period after chemotherapy as well as peripheral blood stem cell mobilization in patients with lymphoma and multiple myeloma (MM) treated with autologous stem cell transplantation (auto-HCT). However, all these studies are retrospective and there are still concerns about the real efficacy of BIO and even more about the real benefit on final costs.Methods: We have retrospectively compared the characteristics of the mobilization procedure in both patients with MM and lymphomas, and healthy donors that received either NEU or BIO (with no chemotherapy) in 4 University Hospitals in Catalunya from December / 2013 to November 2017. BIO replaced NEU in June 2016 in all 4 institutions. Primary objectives were the mobilization rate (defined as the percentage of patients that achieved \u2265 10 x 10 3 /ml CD34 + cells in peripheral blood on day 4) and the use of plerixafor (PLEX) in each group as pre-emptive strategy. A multivariable analysis of risk factors influencing the use of PLEX and mobilization failure (defined as collection of < 2 x 10 6 /kg CD34+ cells) was also performed.Results: We treated 216 patients (102 lymphomas and 114 MM) and 55 healthy donors. Both groups of patients (138 NEU and 78 BIO) and donors (33 NEU and 22 BIO) were comparable regarding pre-mobilization general characteristics. There was a trend for a lower median CD34+ peak on day 4 for BIO patients (17 vs 20, p value = 0.1). A total of 53 patients received PLEX, although 7 of them (13.2%) out of strict theoretical indication, CD34+ cells > 10 x 10 3 /ml (range 10.5-13.5) and were removed for further analysis (n = 46, 31 in the NEU group and 15 in the BIO group). Median number of CD34+ cells on day 4 was significantly lower in the group BIO who needed PLEX (2.4 vs 4.8 for NEU+PLEX, p=002), as well as CD34+ cells finally harvested (2.5 vs 3.3x 10 6 /kg, p=0.03). Mobilization failure rate was higher in BIO group (0 vs 20%, p=0.01). Regarding no PLEX patients, median number of CD34 +cells on day 4 was also significantly lower for BIO patients (33.4 vs 23.7, p=0.03). Risk factors for PLEX use were age, basal disease (lymphoma) and number of prior mobilization therapies. The use of BIO was the only risk factor for mobilization failure patients receiving PLEX [HR 10.3 (95%CI 1.3-77.8), p=0.02]. With respect to healthy donor mobilization, none of them needed PLEX but 2 cases from the BIO group (9%) needed more than one apheresis procedures (2 and 3, respectively).Conclusions: We found a lower efficacy of BIO in the setting of stem cell mobilization of patients with only GCSF both in terms of a lower CD34+ cells peak on day 4 and a lower number of CD34+ cells in final apheresis product. BIO GCSF also seems to be less effective in healthy donors.Disclosure: No conflict of interest to be declaredBackground: Auto-SCT is a common treatment in patients with MM or NHL. The aim of the prospective multicenter GOA (Graft and Outcome in Autologous transplantation) study was to investigate the impact of mobilization method used on the cellular composition of collected blood grafts and eventually hematological and immune recovery as well as long-term outcome post-transplant. Altogether 282 patients with MM or NHL transplanted between 5/2012 and 12/2016 at four university hospitals were included. The long-term goal of the study is to evaluate characteristics of optimal blood grafts in regard to post-transplant recovery and outcome. Methods: Altogether 147 patients with MM undergoing first auto-SCT were compared with 135 patients with NHL. All NHL patients were mobilized with chemotherapy + G-CSF, whereas 39 % of MM patients were mobilized with G-CSF only (p < 0.001). Mobilization data, graft cellular composition including CD34 + cell subsets and lymphocyte subsets of the blood grafts, post-transplant hematological recovery and outcome were evaluated. The median followup time was 46 months in MM patients and 35 months in NHL patients.Results: MM patients mobilized CD34 + cells better (median peak blood CD34 + 65 vs. 40 x 10 6 /L, p < 0.001). The median number of aphereses was 2 in both groups (p = 0.09). Altogether 26 % of the NHL patients received plerixafor compared to 12 % in MM patients (p = 0.002). The median number of CD34 + cells collected was higher in MM patients (6.4 vs. 3.9 x 10 6 /kg, p < 0.001).The median amount of CD34 + cells (with 7-aminoactinomycin) in the infused graft was 2.35 x 10 6 /kg in MM group and 2.5 x 10 6 /kg in NHL group (p = 0.02). The grafts contained more NK cells (median 10.1 vs. 6.1 x 10 6 /kg, p = 0.01) and CD19 + cells (median 1.69 vs. 0.00 x 10 6 /kg, p < 0.001) in MM patients. Neutropenic fever tended to be more common in NHL patients (88 % vs. 79 %, p = 0.06) but MM patients had significantly more bloodstream infections (31 % vs. 15 %, p = 0.003). The median duration of hospitalization was longer in the NHL patients (22 d vs. 18 d, p < 0.001) and the NHL patients had significantly more often ICU admissions (4 % vs. 0 %, p = 0.02).Post-transplant neutrophil engraftment was faster in the NHL group (median 9 d vs. 12 d, p < 0.001). The median time to platelet engraftment was 11 days in both groups. Platelet count was higher in the MM group from day 15 until 1 year after auto-SCT. There were significantly more early deaths (< 100 d from the graft infusion) (4 % vs. 0 %, p = 0.02) and non-relapse deaths (6% vs. 0%, p = 0.003) in the NHL group.Conclusions: MM and NHL patients differ in terms of CD34 + cell mobilization, graft cellular composition and post-transplant recovery as well as risk of non-relapse death. Thus, the optimal graft may be different in NHL and MM patients.Disclosure: The study was supported by VTR fund from North Savo Hospital District and study grant from Sanofi.",

            "text": "Single-center experience in use of plerixafor for autologous stem cell mobilization: Change in practice over 10 years Background: Plerixafor has been proven to mobilize human periferal blood stem cells (PBSCs) alone or acting synergistically with granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF). It has mainly been used for rescue mobilization after failed regimen of chemotherapy plus G-CSF, but lately preemptive use in poor mobilizers has been established as cost-effective. We aim to show ten years of experience and change in practice with plerixafor use in our center.Methods: We retrospectively evaluated the outcome of mobilization procedures and leukapheresis collections in our center in the period from January 2009 to October 2018. Practice from the first 5 years, when plerixafor was mainly used as rescue agent after failed attempt, was compared to period from 2014 till present when preemptive use in poor mobilizers (defined as CD34+ cell counts <10 x 10 6 /L blood) was established.Results: In the period from 2009 to 2013, total of 434 patients underwent collection of autologous PBSCs, and 55 patients required repeated mobilization cycles (12,7%). G-CSF alone was used in 39 patients and 16 patients (29%) recieved combination G-CSF with plerixafor. This cohort consisted of 10 males and 6 females with Non-Hodgkin (NHL) and Hodgkin lymphoma (MH); 13 and 3 respectively. We noted 37 unsuccessful mobilizations (67,3% in repeated mobilization, 8,5% in total) of which one patient was from plerixafor group (6,3%).Background: Transplantation of HLA-haploidentical hematopoietic stem cells (haplo-HSCT) is an established procedure for the treatment of several different hematological diseases. One possible strategy to reduce the risk of Graft-versus-Host Disease is represented by the selective depletion of ab T-lymphocytes (coupled with the depletion of CD19+ B-cells in order to reduce the risk of PTLD) using the CliniMACS device (Miltenyi, Bergish-Gladback). Before depletion, leukapheresis units are washed by lowspeed centrifugation, resulting in a platelet (PLT) rich supernatant (PRS) as a by-product generally discarded. We studied the possibility of recovering PLT from PRS of the haplo donor for transfusion to the recipient during the aplasia period occurring after HSCT.Methods: HSC donors were mobilized with G-CSF (plus Plerixafor in 6 out of 24 donors) as previously described [Locatelli et al, Blood 2017] . Leukapheresis units, obtained with a Spectra Optia device, were washed twice (producing 2 PRS bags) at low speed to remove PLT before starting the ab T-cell/B-cell depletion. The two PRS were leukodepleted by filtration, centrifuged, resuspended and pooled in a total volume ranging from 95 to 360 ml InterSol (IS-PLT) for overnight incubation at 22\u00b0C with agitation (60 cycles/min). The IS-PLT samples were analyzed for the criteria established by the Italian transfusion law. IS-PLT bags were examined for the following parameters: volume >40ml, PLT after leukodepletion >2x10 11 , residual leukocytes < 1x10 6 , pH >6.4 at 22\u00b0C at the end of the 5-day storage period. The sterility was tested using BD Bactec culture vials. The evaluation of the residual leukocytes was performed with the BD LeucoCount Kit. The absolute PLT counts were determined using hemocytometer Sysmex XN2000.Results: PRS bags from 24 donors were processed to produce IS-PLT units. Median resuspension volume in InterSol was 220 ml (range 95-360). The absolute mean value of PLT counts measured at the end of the storage period was 2.1 x10 11 (range 1.0-6.1 x10 11 ). This value was found below the threshold fixed by Italian regulation in 8 cases (33.3%). Mean value of residual leukocytes was 1.3x10 5 (range 0-9x10 5 ); the pH value was always > 6.4. Sterility was observed in all cases. According to the work of Slichter et al. Conclusions: We demonstrated that PLTs recovered from leukapheresis bags can be accepted as a conventional hemocomponent according to the parameters fixed by Italian transfusion law and thus can be administered to the haplo-HSCT recipients early after transplantation. This strategy carries several advantages. Indeed, apart from the obvious advantages in terms of reduced costs, IS-PLT can be used to desensitize the recipient by absorption of anti-HLA class I antibodies, if present in the recipient. Moreover, this strategy can avoid the risk of sensitizing the transplanted patients with HLA alleles that differ from the donor's ones. Finally, the IS-PLT unit is readily available. A clinical study aimed at testing the use of IS-PLT units in transplant recipients will be performed to confirm the clinical efficacy of the approach.Disclosure: Nothing to declare P700 Ultrasound guidance as a powerful tool in increasing Background: Peripheral blood stem cells are generally the preferred graft source for allogeneic stem cell transplantation for malignant disease. In most centers first apheresis is performed on day 5 after 8 to 9 doses of granulocyte colony stimulating factor (GCSF) up to 5ug/kg twice daily. The dose of GCSF and the number of apheresis procedures required contribute to symptom, travel and time burden donors are put through during the process. We hypothesized that taking donor-recipient weight differences into consideration may help reduce this burden Methods: A total of 261 healthy donors who donated peripheral blood stem cells on day 4 of GCSF mobilization in the period between January 2015 and August 2018 at the University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf were included in this quality control evaluation. The donors were divided into two cohorts. The impact of donorrecipient weight ratio on stem cell harvest was tested in the training cohort (2015-2016) and validated in the second cohort (2017) (2018) . For the training cohort, donors were grouped according to donor-recipient weight ratio < 1.0 vs. 1.0-1.2 vs. > 1.2. For the purpose of this analysis a stem cells dose of 5 x 10 6 CD34+/kg recipient weight was set for successful apheresis.Results: In the training cohort including 142 donors, 52 (37%), 36 (25%) and 54 (38%) had a donor-recipient weight ratio of < 1.0, 1.0 -1.2 and > 1.2 respectively. The target stem cells count of 5 x 10 6 CD34+/kg recipient weight was achieved in 36 of 52 (69%), 26 of 36 (72%) and 45 of 54 (83%) donors with donor:recipient weight ratio < 1.0, 1.0 -1.2 and > 1.2 respectively. The cut-off for the validation cohort was therefore set at a weight ratio of 1.2.In der validation cohort including 119 donors, 75 (48%) had a weight ratio > 1.2 while 62 (52%) had a weight ratio \u2264 1.2. Overall in this cohort target cell count of 5 x 10 6 CD34 +/kg recipient weight was reached in 92 (77%) cases. This target was reached in 43 of 62 (69%) of donors with weight ratio \u2264 1.2 and in 49 of 57 (86%) donors with weight ratio > 1.2, p = 0.03.Conclusions: A donor-recipient weight ratio of > 1.2 is seen in about 40% of peripheral blood stem cell donations for allogeneic stem cell transplantation. In these cases apheresis on day 4 after 7 doses of GCSF is reasonable. Donors with lower weight ratios should preferentially donate on day 5 after 8 to 9 doses of GCSF.Disclosure: All authors declare no conflicts of interest Background: The effect of a second mobilization and collection of peripheral blood stem cells (PBSC) on the cell yield is low, as we previously demonstrated. However, donor safety has been poorly addressed with no changes in the clinical practices.Methods: Second donations of unrelated and related donors performed between 2001 and 2017 were evaluated (n=24), including PBSC+PBSC (n=18), bone marrow (BM)+PBSC (n=5) and PBSC+BM (n=1). Analytical parameters including leukocyte, lymphocyte, hemoglobin and LDH quantification, obtained on the pre-harvest evaluation of first and second donation, were retrospectively analyzed and compared for all donors. The Portuguese Bone Marrow Donors Registry (CEDACE) recommends a time between donations no lesser than 6 months. It also states that in very urgent situations like graft failure, donor should be clinical and analytical cleared and its safety ensured.In order to evaluate the impact of time between donations, donor population was divided in 3 groups: < 2 months, 2-6 months, >6 months; to determine the influence of donor age, donors were divided in 2 groups: < 40 and \u226540 years.Results: Among the total of 24 donors, 13 were volunteer donors of CEDACE and 11 were familiar. Fifteen second donations were performed because of recipient graft failure and 9 due to disease progression or relapse. At the time of second collection, median donor age was 37 years (range 23-57). The median delay between both collections was 262 days (37-1519). Time between donations did not seem to substantially impact the analytical donor evaluation: leukocytes, lymphocytes, hemoglobin and LDH results are kept within the reference values. However, donors with less than 2 months between donations showed a slight decrease on leukocyte counts (35%) and hemoglobin values (12%), from the first to the second pre-harvest evaluation. Donor age showed no significant influence on the analytical evaluation. Nevertheless, when considering only the PBSC+PBSC donations, donors with \u226540 years showed a small decrease on lymphocyte counts (19%) .Conclusions: This study demonstrated that the analytical parameters, chosen based on literature, had no significant changes between first and second donation. However, particular attention should be paid when time between donations is lesser than 2 months or donor age is \u226540 years.As we concluded that no significant changes were observed in the group of 2-6 months, it is our opinion that the minimum of 6-12 months established by the registries can be shortened to 2 months ensuring donor safety. An accurate donor risk assessment with a larger population should be accomplished in order to strengthen this recommendation.Disclosure: Nothing to declare.",

            "text": "Background: T cell replete haploidentical stem cell transplant (HHSCT) is complicated mainly by increased risk of graft failure (GF) and graft versus host disease (GVHD). Conventionally GCSF has been used to mobilize hematopoietic stem cells (HSC). In TCR HHSCT GCSF mobilized graft with megadose of CD34+ cells expose the patient to higher doses of alloreactive T cells increasing the risk of GVHD. Plerixafor based mobilization gives an advantage of giving high CD34 cell dose limiting exposure to high alloreactive T cell dose. We share our experience of GCSF + Plerixafor based mobilization for TCR HHSCT. Methods: 9 consecutive patients suffering from SCD who underwent HHSCT between Jan 2018 till date along with the respective donors were enrolled in the study (Group 1). All 9 underwent pre-transplant immune suppression (PTIS) 2 cycles at 3 weekly intervals using fludarabine+cyclophosphamide+dexamethasone.The graft was mobilized using GCSF@10mcg/kg/day(D1-D5)+plerixafor@0.24mg/kg(D5) 6-8 hours before the PBSCH. GVHD prophylaxis included PTCy 50 mg/kg/ day on D3 and 4, sirolimus and MMF starting from D5. Group 2 included 5 historical controls where graft was mobilized using GCSF@10mcg/kg/day(D1-D5). Various parameters pertaining to mobilization, harvest, engraftment, GF and GVHD were assessed between the two groups.Background: Poor mobilizers (PM) defined as those with a peripheral blood CD34 + count \u226410cells/\u03bcl on day+4 is a significant risk factor for mobilization failure. Within these, patients with < 5cells/\u03bcl are considered as very poor mobilizers (VPM). Use of plerixafor in VPM patient is controversial. The aim of our study is to compare mobilizing and engraftment between PM and VPM who received Plerixafor plus G-CSF (P+G-CSF).Methods: In our center, mobilization with G-CSF at dose of 10\u03bcg/Kg/day was used in all pts. Apheresis were scheduled on day+5. Plerixafor (0.24 mg/kg) was added if the number of CD34 + cells on day +4 was < 10/uL for 2x10 6 CD34 + /kg requested (or < 20/uL for 4x10 6 CD34 + /kg), or if the number of CD34 + cells collected in the first apheresis was < 50% of CD34 + cells requested.Between January 2016 and September 2018, 37 out of 157pts (23,6%) received Plerixafor for mobilization. We retrospectively studied 30 pts who mobilized with P+G-CSFdue to the number of CD34 + cells on day +4 was < 10/uL.Results: Twelve out of 30 pts were PM, 7 were females, median age 55,5 years (range:32-70). Patients' baseline diseases were: 10 non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) (83,3%), 1 multiple myeloma (MM) and 1 Hodgkin lymphoma. Median CD34 + cell count on day +4 was 8/ uL (range:6-10).There was no mobilization failure. Eighteen out of 30 pts (60%) were VPM, 9 were females, median age 62,5 years (range:34-69). Patients' baseline diseases were: 10 NHL (55,5%), 7 MM and 1 solid tumor. Median CD34 + cell count on day+4 was 2,5/uL (range:2-5). Two out of 18 pts (16,6%) were considered mobilization failure, in 2 of them did not realized apheresis due to CD34 + cell count on day +5 was 2/uL. No difference was seen between both groups regarding gender, age, patients baseline disease or median CD34 + cells count on day +4.VPM needed more apheresis sessions, 5/16 pts required 2 sessions against 1/12 pts in PM (p=not significant (ns). We obtained enough cells to carry ASCT in 90% pts, although mean number of CD34 + cells obtained in VPM was lower than in PM (4,89x10 6 /kg vs 6,38x10 6 /kg, respectively) (p=ns).Twenty-six pts underwent ASCT and mean number of CD34 + cells infused were 4,27x10 6 /kg in VPM vs have been the only route used for cHPC administration. The appearance of other catheters types made us to reconsider the exclusive use of the CVC for the infusion of cHPC. We analyzed the use of a peripheral IV cannula (PIVC) as an alternative to CVC for the infusion of cHPC in patients with cardiovascular diseases.Methods: Medical records of 65 patients who received an ASCT for hematological malignant diseases at the Hospital Cl\u00ednic of Barcelona from January 2017 to February 2018 were reviewed. Of those, eight were infused through a PIVC due to cardiac impairment related to previous treatments, ischemic cardiomyopathy or amyloid deposition.HPC were obtained from peripheral blood by apheresis after mobilization with G-CSF using ACD-A as an anticoagulant. Cryopreservation was performed with autologous plasma and DMSO 10% by mechanical means and stored in liquid nitrogen. Analytical controls were performed including hematocrit, total nucleated cells, total polymorphonuclear neutrophils and platelets using the ADVIA 120 analyzer. The CD34 + / CD45 + population was analyzed by flow cytometry following the ISHAGE single-platform protocol. Viability of total nucleated cellularity was carried out by vital staining with Acridine Orange and the specific viability of the CD34 + population through the technique of 7-Aminoactinomycin D. Thawing was performed bag to bag by immersion in a water bath at 37\u00baC and transferred to the bedside of the patient for gravity infusion using an infusion set without filter through PIVC of 22 Gauche. Vital sings monitoring performed before, during and the end of the every infusion bag including: blood pressure, heart rate, oxygen saturation, body temperature and central venous pressure. Other aspects assessed during the infusion were pain, cold sensation and signs of extravasation in the area of PIVC insertion. After the infusion, the recovery time of the granulocyte series and platelet were evaluated.Results: Median volume and bags administered was 480 (360-600) mL and 4 (3) (4) (5) . The median of total nucleated cells, total nucleated cells / mL and total CD34+ cells/Kg was 462.6 x 10 8 (329.5-657.8), 107.3 x 10 8 (64.66-156.7) and 3.24 (2.46-4.6) respectively. Vital signs were within the normal range and allowed to perform the infusion in an average of 20-30 minutes/bag. No patient required stopping the infusion due to pain in the area of peripheral catheter insertion and no extravasations were detected. All patients referred some cold sensation in the insertion vein and its path. Median hematopoietic recovery was 14 (11-19) days for neutrophils and 11 (0-19) days for platelets, similar to the recovery experienced from patients who received cHPC through CVC.Conclusions: Based on our data, we conclude that the administration of cHPC, through PIVC and by gravity is safe for the product and for the patient, being the preferred choice for patients suffering from some type of cardiovascular disease.Disclosure: Nothing to declare Background: By selective depletion of potentially alloreactive CD45RA + cells, T memory cells might be retained in the graft and could mediate pathogen specific immunity. However, CD45RA expression is not restricted to na\u00efve T cells, but also available on B cells, NK cells and CD34 + stem cells to some extent. Methods: Within this project we aim to analyze CD45RA expression on stem-and NK cells by flow cytometric analysis to estimate the eventual loss of these cells during CD45RA-depletion. Furthermore, CliniMACS depletion following a one-step approach of direct CD45RAdepletion and a two-step approach with primary CD34selection followed by CD45RA-depletion of the negative fraction was investigated.Results: CD45RA expression on CD34 + stem cells was in median 16.9%. With a Median of 99.4% CD45RA expression was measurable on nearly all B cells, which obviates depletion via CD19. A comparably high CD45RA expression of in median 96.0% was detected on NK cells. Unfortunately, the amount of NK cells in the CD45RA-depleted product was 0.24%. CliniMACS depletion following one-step approach resulted in a stem cell recovery of 52.0%. Memory T cell recovery was 24.2% following one-step and 42.0% applying two-step approach. Depletion quality measured by log-depletion was 3.9 and 3.8 for CD45RA + T cells and 3.2 and 3.6 for CD19 + B cells for one-and two-step approaches, respectively.Conclusions: With regard to stem cell recovery, a previous CD34-selection before CD45RA-depletion is recommendable.Background: Current clinical practice of routine use of filters for infusion of autologous hematopoietic cell transplantation (AHCT) at bone marrow transplant centers across North America and Europe is not known. The use of \"Y\" administration tubing without a filter could possibly increase the risk of infusion of macro-aggregates and cellular debris, which may result in increased side effects.Methods: We carried out a retrospective chart review of patients (pts) at Spectrum Health who underwent AHCT. Group A (Gp A) pts received AHCT using a \"Y\" administration tubing with 170-micron filter from 3/2013 -3/2017. These patients were compared to a control group (Gp B) that received AHCT without filter administration tubing from 3/2014-4/2016.This change in clinical practice occurred due to a change in policy at our transplant center as a result of inorganic particles noticed during cryopreservation. We compared the neutrophil and platelet engraftment duration between these groups. We also studied the length of hospital stay and the effect of filter use on any immediate side effects after infusion. Due to the retrospective nature of the study it was not feasible to evaluate the difference in duration of infusion between these groups Results: The two groups were similar in their age, gender, primary disease distribution and median number of CD34 stem cells infused (Table) . There was no difference in median neutrophil (11 vs 11 days) or platelet engraftment (19 vs 19 days) duration for the filter group and the nonfilter group respectively. The median length of hospital stay was also comparable (17 days). There was no statistically significant difference in the immediate side effects (fever, cough, dyspnea, fluid overload, flushing, nausea, vomiting, hypertension, hypotension and anaphylaxis) or confirmed post-transplant infections (viral, bacterial, fungal) experienced by these two groups.Conclusions: Our results show that the routine use of filter does not prolong hospital stay, and neutrophil/ platelet engraftment duration, thereby, suggesting that viable stem cells are not affected. On the other hand, filter use failed to demonstrate any appreciable decline in the immediate side effects experienced after AHCT. Gp Background: Allo-HSCT from related haplo-identical donors (Haplo-HSCT) with post-transplant high-dose cyclophosphamide is increasingly employed in patients who lack a matched related or unrelated donor. The current standard is to use bone marrow grafts (BM) as peripheral blood stem cell grafts (PBSC) have been associated with an increased risk of acute and chronic GvHD. Thus, the aim of our study was to compare the main transplant outcomes and especially the incidence of acute and chronic GVHD in recipients of BM and PBSC grafts. Methods: Thirty-five unselected patients with hematologic malignancy who underwent an haploidentical transplant at our Unit between 2011 and 2018 and received BM (n = 17) or PBSC (n = 18) grafts after the same TBF conditioning regimen were analysed in order to assess differences in transplant outcomes.Our GVHD prophylaxis consisted in cyclosporine A (CsA) from day -1 to +180, a methotrexate \"short course\" and mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) from day +1 to +28.Results: No statistically-significant differences were observed between patients who received BM grafts and those who received PBSC grafts. At transplant fourteen patients were in first complete remission (CR), twelve in advanced CR and 9 had active disease. According to Sorror's risk, nine patients were low-risk, nine intermediate-risk and seventeen high-risk. Twenty-eight CMV+ patients received the graft from twenty-three CMV+ and five CMV-donors, seven CMV-patients received the graft from five CMV+ and two CMVdonors. Mean age at transplant was 51 years (range 23-72), mean donor's age 38 years (range18-39) and mean follow-up 16.9 months (range 1.9-56.7). Median CD 34+ cell dose was 5.2x10 6 /kg (range1.4-10.4), 3.6 x10 6 /kg (range 1.4-7.7) in BM recipients and 14.0 x10 6 /kg (range 4.2-10.4) in PBSC recipients. Median time to neutrophil recovery (>500/\u03bcl) was 22 days (range 16-39) posttransplant, 23 days (range 18-27) for BM recipients and 20 (range 16-39) for PBSC recipients. Platelet recovery (>20.000/\u03bcl) occurred in all patients except one at a median of 17 days (range 10-151) post-transplant, at a median of 20 days (11-151) post-transplant for BM recipients and at a median of 14 days (range (10-26) for PBSC recipients. Seven patients never reached platelets >50.000/\u03bcl. Three patients developed a poor graft function. Acute and chronic GVHD incidence was 28.5% and 22.8% and the risks of acute (hazard ratio [HR], 1.04; P = .955) and chronic (HR, 0.85; P = .816) graft-versus-host disease were similar in the two patient groups. In addition, there were no differences in relapse risks post-transplant (HR, 0.90; P = .898); relapse-free survival was better with PBSC grafts but this difference did not reach any statistical significance. Finally, no significant differences were noted in overall mortality by graft type (HR, 0.62; P = .441).Conclusions: Despite in haplo-HSCT the incidence of acute and chronic GVHD is reported to be higher with PBSC than with BM our small patient series does not confirm this assumption that should be clarified by additional studies. Instead, our data suggest that PBSC Background: Since 1988, cord blood (CBU) has become an alternative source of stem cells for transplantation, with approximately 35,000 procedures currently performed. With a 2-year GS of 50%.Objective: Analyze the outcomes from all the patients transplanted with CBU in our hospital unit.Methods: Retrospective, longitudinal study. All patients transplanted with CBU in our hospital between 2007 and 2017 were included. We analyzed 40 patients with ages from 7 months to 14 years.Results: Two of them received doubled cord transplantation the ratio male: female was 1.3: 1. The transplanted pathologies were: Bone marrow failure 35%, immunodeficiency 25%, AML 20%, ALL 17.5%, Osteopetrosis 2.5%. RIC regimens were used in patients with bone marrow failure and immunodeficiency and myeloablative conditioning regimens were used in patients with malignant hematology diseases. Antithymocyte rabbit globulin (ATG) based serotherapy was used. One case received CBU from a related donor (sister), the rest received unrelated CBU obtained from Centro Nacional de la Trasfusi\u00f3n Sangu\u00ednea. The infusion of CD34 + was in a range of 0.11 to of 2.7 X10 6 /kg with and average of 0.43 X 10 6 / kg. Compatibility was 4/6 in 70%, 5/6 in 20% and 6/6 in 10%. Post-thawing cellularity was not measured. The HLA-C was not analyzed. Forty two point five percent of the patients had a successful engraftment; the average time of engraftment was 30 days. Primary graft failure was detected in 57.5% and secondary graft failure in 10%, for a total success of 32.5%. GVHD was detected in 20% of patients, of which 90% was grade I-II and 10% grade III-IV. The overall mortality was 52.5%. Causes of death were: infection 45% Relapse 30%, Hemorrhage 20% and GVHD 5%.",

            "text": "The risk of infection of the umbilical cord is not related to the microbiological status of the umbilical cord blood Methods: The statistical analysis was carried out on data obtained from samples taken in Poland between 01-Jan-2017 and 31-Dec-2017. The samples were collected in hospitals by external midwifes and sent to the PBKM in accordance with the requirements of the American Association of Blood Banks. After arrival in the laboratory, the blood samples were cultured and the UCs were assessed immediately for visual signs of infection, such as odor, altered color, or visible bloom. The status of both kinds of samples was introduced into the PBKM general database. For the purpose of this analysis, the UCs were considered as microbiologically pure if stored, destroyed after storage, or handed over to the PBKM. Samples marked as infected or disqualified for unknown reasons (other than termination of the contract with the customer, viral infection of the mother, and lack of cell growth) were considered as infected. At the time of the statistical analysis, the samples of unknown UCB microbiological culture status were removed from the generated report. The data was summarized as percentages and the odds ratio was calculated. Statistical significance was considered at p\u02c20.05.Background: Match family donors are the preferable options in allogenic stem cell transplant. However, in the absence of donor relatives match unrelated donors have been an option. In this study, the donor screening, transplant preparation phases of Turkish Stem Cell Coordination Center (TURKOK) and the \u0130stanbul University Bone Marrow Bank (TRIS), were compared.Methods: The unrelated donor scanning data between March 2015 and November 2018 in Pediatric stem cell transplantation Unit of Alt\u0131nbas University Bahcelievler Medical Park Hospital were evaluated. 93 unrelated transplants were performed in total. 65 % of these transplants (n=61) were included from the donors of TURKOK registration system and 34,4 % of these transplants (n=32) were included by means of TRIS from donors outside of Turkey. 8 patients (5 TRIS, 3 TURKOK) were excluded from the study in consequence of screening update and postpone of transplantation. The statistics were carried out on a total of 85 patients, 67,1 % of whom were in TURKOK (n=57) and 32,9 % were transplanted via TRIS (n=28). The day of application to stem cell transplantation unit, reply dates and the transplantation dates were examined for the transplant patients.Results: In the current study, the average response time of TURKOK was found as 0,91\u00b12,96 day (median: 0), the average transplant time after receiving a reply was found as 98,24\u00b163,89 (median: 85) day, the average number of days from date of application to date of transplantation of patients was found as 101,12\u00b163,17 (median: 89). The average response time of TRIS was 18,78\u00b118,36 (median: 15) day, the average transplant time after receiving a reply from TRIS was 136,82\u00b163,84 (Median: 119) day, average number of days from date of application of TRIS to date of transplantation of patients 155,61\u00b172,23 (Median: 140) day.The average response time of TURKOK, the average transplant time after receiving a reply from TURKOK and the average number of days from date of application of TURKOK to date of transplantation of patients was shorter than TRIS. The difference between them was found statistically significant (p< 0.05).Conclusions: In this study, it was determined that the transplantation processes with TURKOK were progressing more rapidly. The rapid progress of the process was attributed to the fact that all donor HLA tissue groups in the TURKOK database were studied in high resolution. In international scans carried out through TRIS, it was thought that the examination of the donor castings coming from bone marrow banks and the time differences between the countries prolong the process. It was thought that HLA tests of the registered donors in the TRIS database and some international bone marrow banks were studied in low resolution but not studied the all HLA loci, the centers wanted high-resolution HLA, and therefore the involvement of social security institutions and payment procedures were among the factors extending this process.Disclosure: Nothing to declare Background: Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (AHSCT) is being performed for a group of hematologic diseases with a curative intent. Outcomes after AHSCT are influenced by the type of donor used. Haploidentical transplantation is an emerging option when a fullmatched donor is unavailable. Methods: We retrospectively analyzed our transplants performed between January 2015 and November 2018, investigating outcomes and complications among haploidentical stem cell recipients.Results: One hundred and nineteen patients underwent AHSCT, 9 of them (7.5%) were recipient of a haploidentical stem cell and included in this study. One patient diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) were performed a haploidentical AHSCT for two times due to relapse. Among those 9 transplants, 4 of them were diagnosed with acute myeloid leukemia, 2 with ALL, 1 with chronic lymphocytic leukemia, 1 with myelodysplastic syndrome and 1 with Hodgkin lymphoma. The mean age of group was 35.7\u00b115.2 years. Three patients (2 AML, 1 ALL) were in remission at the time of transplantation. Patients were given a conditioning regimen based mostly on busulfan, fludarabin and total body irradiation with a myeloablative intent. Patients were also given a various combinations of post-transplant cyclophosphamide, calcineurin inhibitors, mycophenolate mofetil and antithymocyte globulin for graft versus host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis; post-transplant cyclophosphamide administered on 6 (67%) of those transplantations. Peripheral blood was the source of stem cells in all patients. Patients were infused with mean 6.15\u00b10.67x10 6 /kg of CD34+ cells. Hematological recovery was achieved with neutrophil engraftment at a mean of 19.2\u00b12.1 days and platelet engraftment at a mean of 17.3\u00b12.7 days. After a median 8month (0.2-40.6 months) follow up, the cumulative rates of grade 3-4 GVHD, relapse and non-relapse mortality were 11%, 28% (n=7) and 71%, respectively. One patient died due to relapse, at the end of the follow up two were still alive with remission. Only one patient has died due to chronic GVHD affecting serosa and resulting with a fatal tracheoesophageal fistula. The mean overall survival was 6.9\u00b12.6 months in our study.Conclusions: Haploidentical transplant is a feasible option in hematologic malignancies with novel GVHD prophylaxis approaches, especially post-transplantation cyclophosphamide. However, these results need to be supported with further investigations with a larger patient group.Disclosure: Nothing to declare Results: A total of 25 patients between 19 and 58 years (median age: 33 years). Transplant was done for following disease: acute leukemia (n=9, 36%), aplastic anemia (n=5, 20%), lymphoma (n=4, 16%), myelofibrosis (n=3, 12%), myelodisplastic syndrome (n=2, 8%), chronic myeloid leukemia (n=2, 8%). Ten donors were from Turkey and fifteen donors were from different countries of Europe and America. Two of 25 donors were 9/10 and the other 23 was 10/10 HLA matched. The conditioning regimen was mostly non myeloablative (n=17, 68%) while eight patients were treated with myeloablative regimen. Other than two patients who took tacrolimus and mycophenolate mofetile all of them got cyclophosphamide and methotrexate for graft versus host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis. The median time of neutrophil and platelets engrafman were 18 days (range 11-31) and 13,5 days (range 9-36) respectively. Acute GVHD was seen nearly half of the patients (47,8%).Overall survival was 40% for all patients and 15 of 25 patiens (60%) died within first month to 18 months (median 3 months). The mortality rate was more higher for the recipients who had donor source from countries other than Turkey (30% vs 80% p=0,018). Transplant related mortality was the most common reason of mortality (n=7/ 15, 46,7%) and other reasons were GVHD (33,3%), infections and cirrhosis respectively.Conclusions: We found the mortality rate more higher in the patients whose donors were from out of our country. However, we need to further multicentric and prospective investigations to confirm our hypothesis, it would be related with impact of ethnicity.Disclosure: Nothing to disclose Late-breaking abstracts P725 targeted twice daily busulfan-based ric-conditioning for allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation in pediatric patients with chronic granulomatous disease: A 10-year experience with the Zurich protocol Matthias Felber 1 , Mathias Hauri-Hohl 1 , Ulrike Zeilhofer 1 , Federica Achini 1 , Jana Pachlopnik-Schmid 2 , Janine Reichenbach 2 , Seraina Prader 2 , Tayfun G\u00fcng\u00f6r 1Background: Chronic granulomatous disease (CGD) needs sufficient myeloablation to avoid graft failure. For this purpose the EBMT Inborn errors working Party currently recommends Treosulfan or Busulfan-based conditioning regimens for CGD-SCT. We analyzed the last 10 years of targeted Busulfan-based RIC-conditioning including engraftment, GvHD rates, chimerism and late term effects in our pediatric SCT center in Zurich. Methods: Between 2008 and 2018, n=34 consecutive pediatric CGD patients (median age 6 years, range 1-16 years, n=4 female, n=9 autosomal recessive inheritance) have been transplanted. All patients received therapeutic drug monitoring of twice daily administered iv Busulfan (3 or 4 hour infusions; d-5 to -d2) to achieve a targeted cumulative AUC of 45-70 mg/L*h. Fludarabine (180 mg/ sqm; d-8 to -d3) and serotherapy (Thymoglobuline 7.5 mg/ kg total, d-5 to d-3) or Alemtuzumab (0.5-0.6 mg/kg total; d-8-to d-6) were used for immunoablation. Donors were matched unrelated (10/10 HLA; n= 19), mismatched unrelated (9/10 HLA; n= 7), mismatched unrelated (HLA 8/10; n=1), matched sibling (HLA 6/6; n= 5) and haploidentical parental (HLA 5/10; n=2). For 2 patients with haploidentical donor post-transplant cyclophosphamide (d-3 and d-4 with 50 mg/kg iv each) and upfront ATG-Grafalon (40 mg/kg -12 to-d-9) was used. Stem cell sources were BM (n=29) and PBSC (n=5). GVHDprophylaxis included iv CSA (d-3; continuous infusion) and iv. MMF (d-0, in 2-3 doses).Results: Follow-up was 6 to 118 months. Good overall engraftment was noted, with n=1 secondary graft failure followed by successful retransplantation. In one patient a stem cell boost/DLI was necessary due to decreasing myeloid donor chimerism during EBV reactivation, resulting in rapid myeloid donor reconstitution after intervention. Low rates of GvHD were documented with n=2 aGvHD grade IV and n=2mild/limited cGvHD (NIH criteria). With exception of one patient, myeloid donor chimerism at last follow-up was over 82%, mostly over 95%. Overall survival was 31/34 (91%). Deaths were due to GI-GvHD (n=1), autoimmune hemolytic anemia/sepsis (n=1) and thrombotic microangiopathy (n=1).Conclusions: Precision dosing of iv Busulfan in combination with Fludarabine and serotherapy results in excellent outcome of HSCT for pediatric CGD-patients with good engraftment, low overall cGvHD rates and stable, mostly excellent donor chimerism. Graft failure rate was as low as 3%. Low dose Alemtuzumab prevented GVHD in the majority of patients. This analysis demonstrates that targeted Busulfan-based conditioning is a valid option for pediatric CGD-patients. Serum alemtuzumab or ATG monitoring could further improve GF and GVHD rates in the future.Disclosure: The authors declare no conflict of interest.",

Patients present with multisystemic uncontrolled inflammation and multi-organ involvement requiring diverse courses of immunosuppressive and chemotherapy regimens. Allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (alloHSCT) is the only available curative option; however, the cumulative treatment toxicity and the underlying inflammatory disease often result in high organ toxicity and inflammatory complications of transplantation, such as Graft versus Host Disease (GVHD) and/or graft failure. Especially patients with unrelated donors often deal with high transplant-related mortality (TRM) in the setting of conventional intensity conditioning.Herein, we present the clinical course of the disease and transplant outcome of 14 children diagnosed with primary HLH (n=12) and high-risk LCH (n=3) who underwent alloHSCT at our centre from 02/2003 to 08/2018.Methods: The HLH cohort consisted of 7 cases of familial HLH (fHLH), 4 cases of Griscelli syndrome, one XIAP-deficient patient and one HLH-patient with inconclusive genetic testing. All HLH patients had developed clinical symptoms prior to transplantation and had been treated according to HLH-protocols 94, 2004 HLH-protocols 94, or 2015 Median age at transplantation was 10 months (4 to 128 months). Stem cells were derived from HLA-matched siblings (MSD, n= 4), matched unrelated donors (MUD, n = 9) or haploidentical donors (n=1).The majority of patients (9/14) received a RIC regimen containing fludarabine, melphalan and thiotepa (n=8) and fludarabine plus cyclophosphamide (n=1). Myeloablative treatment (5/14) included a treosulfan-based regimen (n=3) and busulfan-containing treatment (n=2). The entire cohort received serotherapy using either muromonab (n=3), ATG-Fresenius\u00ae (n=9) or alemtuzumab (n=2).Results: The overall survival of the entire cohort was 78.6% (11/14) on a median follow-up of 9.9 years ( Figure  1 A+B) .All LCH patients, being treated with fludarabine, melphalan and thiotepa, survived transplantation and showed complete remission (3/3) . Within the HLH cohort the overall survival was 72.7% (8/11). Fatalities (n=3) included two patients from the myeloablative group and one RIC-treated patient. The cause of death were progressive disease activity during the conditioning phase, leading to multi-organ failure on day +15 despite immunosuppressive treatment (n=1) and complicated cerebral seizures followed by lung haemorrhage, possibly due to aspiration pneumonia with evidence of Enterococcus faecium, resulting in septic multi-organ failure on day +4 (n=1). A third HLH patient developed a sudden cerebral edema and ensuing respiratory insufficiency on day +4. Whether this was caused by acute neurotoxic damage by fludarabine or a consequence of relapsed HLH could not be conclusively specified. None of our patients suffered from transplant failure or nonengraftment. There was neither severe acute GVHD (III-IV) nor chronic GVHD observed in this cohort.Conclusions: Primary HLH and high-risk LCH are lifethreatening medical conditions needing rapid alloHSCT. RIC regimens are well-tolerated and sufficient for proper engraftment and disease clearance. Disclosure: The authors have no conflicts of interest to disclose.",

Steroid refractoriness was defined as: progression after three days or no response after 5 days of steroid treatment. The median time from SCT to the onset of aGvHD was 22.5 d (range 9-122 d), and 11 d (range 3-40 d) from the onset of aGvHD to the first MSC infusion, respectively.The majority of our patients (n=5) suffered from a malignant disease and received a graft from a matched unrelated donor (n=6), while one patient had a haploidentical donor. GvHD prophylaxis was performed in all patients except the patient with the haplo-identical graft. All patients with aGvHD were treated with steroids and the patient with thrombocytopenia required regularly transfusions and Romiplostin therapy. The median MSC dose was 1.7x10 6 cells/kg BW (minimum 1.1 x10 6 ; maximum 3 x10 6 ). Three patients received 2 MSC doses, two patients 4, one patient 5 and another 7 doses.Results: At the time point of aGvHD manifestation and MSC application, two patients had CMV reactivation, one patient adenovirus infection and one patient EBVreactivation. By day 28, 5/6 aGvHD patients responded to MSC administration: 3 with complete response and 2 with partial response. At the last follow-up (median: 4.42 months, range 0,82-12.06 months), 4 of 6 patients were alive without acute or chronic GVHD. One patient died soon after MSC treatment with no obvious response in the course of a systemic hyperinflammation syndrome. The other patient although complete responder to MSC-FFM developed fatal adenovirus sepsis. This based on the profound Tcell depletion induced by concomitant application of steroids. The overall survival probability at six month was 66.7%. No acute side effects occurred after MSC infusions. The previously mentioned patient suffering from thrombocytopenia did not need any further transfusions after receiving 2 doses MSCs combined with stem cell boosts while continuing Romiplostin application.Conclusions: Our data confirm excellent tolerability and high efficacy of the licensed off-the-shelf MSC preparation \"MSC-FFM\" in pediatric steroid-refractory aGvHD. In our center, current treatment algorithms have escalated \"MSC-FFM\" to the second line, i.e. immediately after steroid refractoriness has been established.

However, experience in the conditioning regimen is limited and no transplantation strategy for A-T patients exists, especially in an allogeneic setting. Conditioning regimen and donor selection are critical factors in the clinical setting of HSCT and incur substantial risks, especially in A-T. The aim of this study was (1) to evaluate whether different approaches of HSCT including allogeneic hematopoietic HSCT are feasible in regard to graft versus host response (GvHD) and sufficient concerning immune reconstitution (2) and to de-escalate the toxic effects of the conditioning regimen by reducing the dose of cyclophosphamide (CP).Methods: T cells from syngeneic, allogeneic and haploidentical donor mice were used to determine GvHD induced T cell proliferation in a mixed lymphocyte reaction (MLR). Atm-deficient mice were treated with CP or reduced CP in combination with Fludarabine (FLU) and transplanted with 5x10 6 CD90.2 depleted bone marrow donor cells from 129/SvEv GFP-transfected wildtype mice (syngeneic) or from mice of the F1 generation of 129/SvEv wildtype mice and C57BL/6 mice (haploidentical), or from C57BL/6 mice (allogeneic). Tracking of GFP-positive donor derived cells was performed using flow cytometry and Atm PCR. Oxidative stress and damage were detected by a RT Profiler PCR Array and 8-Hydroxy-2\u2032deoxyguanosine.Results: MLR resulted in an increased proliferation of allogeneic donor T cells compared to syngeneic and haploidentical donor cells. Response was lower on dendritic cells isolated from Atm-deficient mice compared to wildtype controls. In vivo results showed the restoration of T cells in Atm-deficient mice accompanied by a prolonged life span and through reduction of thymic tumors. However, allogeneic stem cell transplantation was accompanied with a higher mortality rate, compared to the haploidentical and syngeneic setting. Decreased antioxidative capacity and a higher DNA-damage were seen in CP treated Atmdeficient mice.Conclusions: Haploidentical HSCT seems to be a feasible strategy for A-T. Our data provided further evidence for the high sensitivity against ROS-inducing agents in A-T and this fact needs to be taken into consideration in the choice of the host-conditioning strategy.Disclosure: Nothing to declare This research received funding from Action for A-T Charity (14GOU01) Background: Prognosis of pediatric patients and young adults suffering from refractory or high-risk soft tissue sarcomas remains poor with limited improvement over the last decades despite multimodal treatment strategies. Replacing the immune system by an allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) in refractory solid malignancies has been proposed as a potentially curative therapy due to its presumable graft versus tumor effect. Based on this concept we additionally performed consecutive donor-derived lymphocyte infusions in allogeneic HSCT-patients with refractory or relapsed solid malignancy to further increase anti-tumor efficacy post-transplant.Methods: Pediatric patients with relapsed and/or refractory cancers or with delayed responses to the respective induction therapies were offered donorderived cellular therapies after immune system replacement by an allogeneic HSCT. Cellular immunotherapies comprised of donor lymphocyte infusions (DLI), natural killer (NK) cell or cytokine-induced killer (CIK) cell infusions generated from the original stem cell donors. Allogeneic NK cells were generated from unstimulated leukapheresis by a two-step purification procedure using immunomagnetic CD3 T cell depletion, followed by NK cell enrichment (CD56+) with or without in vitro IL-2 stimulation and expansion for 9-14 days. For CIK cell generation peripheral blood mononuclear cells were isolated and activated by in vitro cytokine stimulation (INF-\u03b3, anti-CD3, IL-2 and IL-15) an expanded over 10-12 days. Expanded CIK cells represented a heterogeneous population of polyclonal T cells with in part shared phenotypic and functional properties of NK cells.Results: Between October 1 st 2003 and January 1 st 2014 a total of 18 patients (eight patients with rhabdomyosarcoma, one patient with synovial sarcoma, two patients with Ewing sarcoma, five patients with neuroblastoma, one patient with hepatoblastoma, and one patient with nasopharynx carcinoma) were enrolled. Seven of 18 (39%) patients in this study had achieved complete remission (CR) before HSCT while another 7 of 18 (39%) patients had obtained at least very good partial or partial response (VGPR or PR). DLI was applied in 5 patients, NK cell treatment was offered to another 6 patients, while CIK cell therapy was given to 7 patients.1.5-year probabilities of overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) were 16.2% and 15.9% for all patients with a median follow up of 8.5 months (range, 1.5-115.1 months). Patients in CR at the time of immune cell therapy (IT) showed estimated 1.5-year OS and PFS of 49.6% and 42.7%, respectively. The majority of patients relapsed and ultimately succumbed to their diseases with two of 18 (11%) patients still being alive 9.6 and 9.3 years after IT. Cumulative incidence of relapse was 79.8% at 1.5 years. T cell engraftment and immune reconstitution (IR) was improved by IT, and correlated with treatment response. However, two of 18 heavily pretreated patients (11%) died due to cumulative treatment-related mortality (TRM). Furthermore, acute graft-versus-host-disease (aGVHD) occurred in 9 of 18 patients (50%) with aGVHD grade I-II observed in 6 (33%) and aGVHD grade III seen in three (17%) patients.Conclusions: Altogether, the results of this study indicate that allogeneic donor-derived cellular therapy at its current state offers curative benefit in selected refractory childhood cancers but warrants further improvement. Background: Allogeneic stem cell transplantation (allo-SCT) is the only curative treatment option for a variety of nonmalignant diseases. The success of allo-SCT is strongly associated with rapid and sustained immune reconstitution (IR). We analyzed the IR in patients who received an allo-SCT for nonmalignant diseases.IR was assessed on days +30, +60, +90, +180 and +365 after allo-SCT analyzing leukocytes, lymphocytes, monocytes, CD3 + T cells, CD3 + CD4 + T helper cells, CD3 + CD8 + cytotoxic T cells, CD3 -CD56 + natural killer (NK) cells and CD19 + B cells.Methods: We analyzed IR-data of 116 consecutive patients receiving allo-SCTs between September 2001 and November 2018. Indications of allo-SCT were hereditary anemias (thalassemia, sickle cell disease, Diamond Blackfan Anemia; HA, n=35, 30%), inherited bone marrow failure syndrome (Fanconi anemia, severe aplastic anemia, others; BMFS, n=34, 29%), hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH, n=12, 10%), immunodeficiency (ID, n=28, 24%) and metabolic disorders (n=7, 6%). The median age at allo-SCT was 7 years (range, 0.2 -26) and at diagnosis 0.8 years (range, -0.5 -17.8).Patients received 1 st allo-SCT from MSD/MFD (n=53, 46%), MUD (n=42, 36%), haploidentical mismatch family donors (n=15, 13%) and MMUD (n=6, 5%). Conditioning regimens were Busulphan-based (n=14, 12%), Treosulphan-based (n=45, 39%), Flu-Mel-Thio (n=35, 30%) or others (n=22, 19%). Graft sources were BM (n=84, 72%) and PBSC (n=32, 28%).In order to consider the age-dependency of IR we normalized each absolute cell count with its corresponding age-specific expected mean values. (Huenecke et al.; Eur J Haematol; 2008) Results: The IR pattern was similar between the HA and BMFS groups. The CD4 + T cells were recovering slightly faster in HA patients compared to the recovery of BMFS patients.Monocytes and NK cells proliferate very fast. At day +60 half of the patients already reached their respective monocytes reference value except for ID patients, who reached 80% of the reference value at the end of the first year.CD3 + CD8 + cytotoxic T cells recovered significantly faster in patients with hematologic diseases compared to patients with HLH (P< 0.001) and ID (P=0.047). Half of the patients reached the reference value of cytotoxic T cells in the hematologic diseases group at day +365. By far inferior was the IR for the HLH patients. In this group only 50% of the patients reached the 45 th percentile of the healthy age-matched reference. In the ID group 50% of all patients reached the 87 th percentile of the age-matched reference group at day +365.B cells are profoundly decreased at day +30 in all groups. However, the longitudinal expansion of B cells was significantly lower both in the ID group and HLH group compared to the hematologic diseases group. At day +365 fifty percent of patients with ID, HLH and hematologic diseases reached the 37 th percentile, 52 th percentile and the 100 th percentile, respectively (P< 0.001; P=0.027).Conclusions: Allo-SCT is the only curative option for patients with nonmalignant diseases. IR is dynamic and revealed a complex diversity pattern with regard to the original disease. To investigate factors influencing IR after allo-SCT is crucial to improve outcome of these patients.Disclosure: Nothing to declare.",

The 3-year overall survival (OS) rate and disease-free survival (DFS) rate was 76.8% \u00b14.2% and 76.7%\u00b14.3% respectively. The 3-year cumulative relapse rate (RR) and the non-relapse mortality (NRM) rate was 13.9%\u00b10.1% and 18.4%\u00b10.1% respectively. The incidence of grade II-IV acute graft versus host disease (aGVHD) was 25.2%\u00b10.1%. For the patients who survived more than 100 days after allo-HCT, the 2 years cumulative incidence of chronic graft versus host disease (cGVHD) was 33.4%\u00b10.2%. Univariate analysis showed that the hematopoietic cell transplantation comorbidity index(HCT-CI) and grade III-IV aGVHD are the high risk factors for OS(81.2\u00b14.5% vs 62.8\u00b110%, P=0.027 and 81.9\u00b14.4% vs 51.1\u00b111.8%,P <0.001). Multivariate analysis demonstrated that grade III-IV aGVHD and HCT-CI are independent risk factors for OS(HR=6.206, P <0.001, 95% CI:2.529~15.288 and HR=2.651,P=0.025, 95%CI:1.127~6.232). Chemotherapy before transplantation did not improve OS or DFS for patients with bone marrow blast cells more than 10% at the time of diagnosis.Conclusions: Allo-HSCT is an effective treatment for MDS patients of relatively high-risk groups. The physical condition of the patients and occurrence of aGVHD are independent risk factors. For intermediate and high risk IPSS-R MDS patients, transplantation before the disease progressed into very high risk can achieve better prognosis, high-risk group can still benefit from rebound GvHD after CNI tapering which was promptly responsive to treatment steroids, FK506 and ECP. Aa one year after SCT 12/13 patients were without GvHD and off all immunosuppression while one single patient was still on taper of immunosuppressant after rebound acute GvHD. No chronic GvHD occurred. SCTrelated toxicity was common with mucositis in all patients (WHO grade 4: n=5), elevated liver enzymes (\u2265grade 3: n=9) and impaired renal function (GFR 40-60ml/min: n=8). Five patients developed neurologic symptoms (seizures n=2, PRES n=1, pseudotumor cerebri n=2) which all resolved without sequelae. Overall survival and transfusion-free survival was 100% with a median observation time of 5 (2-8) years.Conclusions: 4. Treosulfan-based conditioning followed by SCT from HLA-matched related or unrelated donors represents a highly efficacious treatment approach for children, adolescents and young adults with TDT and exhibits an acceptable but not negligible safety profile. An individual risk-benefit assessment incorporating hazards such as secondary graft failure, GvHD and long-term toxicity including infertility and 2 nd malignancy has to be executed in the informed consent process for every patient and his/her guardians.Disclosure: \"Nothing to declare\" P740 Abstract already published.",

That will allow to implement the analysis of patient and donor hematopoiesis by digital PCR methods in our lab.Disclosure Background: With the immense progress in therapeutic regimens in pediatric oncology and stem cell transplantation the survivor rates increased up to 80%. At the same time the field of reproductive medicine has achieved substantial advances to offer potential options for fertility preservation. Therefore it is of great importance to implement fertility counseling and fertility preserving (FP) procedures for patients facing gonadotoxic therapy. In the report on the expert meeting of the Paediatric Diseases Working Party (PDWP) of the EBMT in 2017 counseling related to FP opportunities should be offered to each patient receiving stem cell transplantation (SCT), as part of the pre-SCT workup by a dedicated and trained team. Yet there many medical, ethical, structural and financial issues to consider and overcome. We describe the setting up process to enable fertility counseling for all children with newly diagnosed cancer or those facing stem cell transplantation for malignant and nonmalignant diseases in our department of pediatric oncology and immunology/stem cell transplantation.Methods: At our tertiary care center we assembled a multidisciplinary team involved in fertility preservation (pediatric hematology/oncology, pediatric immunology/ stem cell transplantation, reproductive medicine, andrology, psychology and pediatric surgery). We developed an internal grading system for recommendations regarding fertility preservation based on the current recommendations for fertility preservation of leading societies in this field like EBMT, GPOH and DGGG. It is important to find a consensus within the team for the counseling to ensure reliable counseling. The third step is to implement structures needed for fertility counseling and performance of invasive procedures including legal aspects (AMG). A detailed description of this process is given.Results: After setting up structures for the counseling process we counseled 140 oncology and stem cell transplant patients (0-18 years) between January 2017 and May 2018. We analysed data of the patients including age subgroups and disease entities and the results of the counseling process. For those patients undergoing stem cell transplantation the risk of gonadotoxicity is very high, therefore even the very young children underwent fertility preserving procedures in alignment with our recommendations if they suffered from a nonmalignant disease. Currently we discourage tissue preserving in malignant systemic disease due to possible contamination with malignant cells. Postpubertal female patients were more likely to undergo invasive procedures such as ovarian tissue cryopreservation in the case of oncological diseases, while sperm cryopreservation was recommended in all postpubertal male patients. Overall a high percentage of the patients and their family followed our recommendations.Conclusions: Fertility preservation should be considered as a very important part of the treatment plan for newly diagnosed children and young adults with cancer and those facing stem cell transplantation. Unfortunately there is still a great need for setting up structures in institutions taking care of these patients. In addition fertility preservation sadly lacks funding by health insurance in some countries. With the presentation of our experience and data we want to facilitate incorporation of fertility counseling in other pediatric care centers to provide counseling for pediatric patients in need for fertility preservation.Disclosure: no conflict of interest Regulatory T-cells (T reg ) have been shown to play a role not only in autoimmune diseases and solid organ transplantation but also in GvHD. Several mouse models showed a decrease of GvHD incidence after T reg administration. The few clinical trials regarding the application of T reg for the treatment of GvHD are encouraging, however the data is limited. Methods: Patient: A 14-year-old boy underwent allogeneic SCT for chronic myeloid leukemia refractory to imatinib, dasatinib and nilotinib treatment from his 10/10 HLA identical brother. Freshly derived unmanipulated bone marrow was transplanted after conditioning with of fludarabine (40 mg/m\u00b2/d, day -7 to -4), thiotepa (2x 5mg/ kg, day -3) and melphalan (160 mg/m\u00b2, day -2). Cyclosporin A (CsA) and mycophenolatmofetil (MMF) were used for GvHD prophylaxis. Leukocyte regeneration (>1000/\u03bcl) was seen on day +15, granulocyte regeneration (>500/\u03bcl) on day +16 and thrombocyte regeneration (>50.000/\u03bcl) on day +21. On day +30 after SCT he developed acute intestinal GvHD that exacerbated to grade IV\u00b0(bloody diarrhea, ileus) and did neither respond to steroids, nor to different immunosuppressive drugs such as cyclosporin, tacrolimus, sirolimus, mycophenolatemofetil and ruxolitinib. Extracorporal photopheresis and the administration of immunmodulatory antibodies (adalimumab and tocilizumab) did not succeed either.Results: By administration of low-dose interleukin-2 (IL-2) in vivo induction of T reg was expected but did not succeed. Finally antithymocyte globuline (ATG, 20 mg/kg/ d) was administered on day +150 to +152 to eliminate the GvHD-triggering cells. Hence, the GvHD declined to grade III. Finally, a decision was made to manufacture T reg from his stem cell donor. From an unstimulated leukapheresis T reg were selected by magnetic depletion of CD8 + T-cells and CD19 + B-cells followed by positive selection of CD25 + Background: Treatment of patients with transfusion dependent anemia like thalassemia major (TM), sickle cell disease (SCD) and Diamond-Blackfan anemia (DBA) has improved over the last decades. For the vast majority of patients, allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is the only available curative therapy. For a long time, HSCT has only been performed from HLA-identical sibling donors (MSD) or matched family donors (MFD). However, approximately only 25-30 % of affected patients do have a matched sibling donor, therefore HSCT from 10/ 10 (MUD) and even 9/10 (MMUD) matched unrelated donors has gained importance in recent years.Methods: 36 patients (age range: 2-27 years) with SCD (n=7), DBA (n=6) or TM (n=23), receiving HSCT from a MSD, MFD, MUD or MMUD between 2010 and 2019 were included in our analysis. 23 patients received transplants from MSD/MFD, 13 patients from MUD/ MMUD. 7 patients were identical for HLA-A, B, CW, DRB1 and DQB1, 6 patients shared only 9/10 genes. We analyzed extended haplotypes including DRB3, DRB4, DRB5 and DPB1 for all patients with thalassemia. 7 pairs showed non-permissive DPB1 mismatch and 1 pair mismatch for DPB1 and DRB4.Results: Median time for granulocyte recovery was 20 days in patients transplanted from MSD/MFD and 22 days in patients transplanted from MUD/MMUD. Platelet recovery was reached after 22 days after HSCT from MSD/MFD and 24 days after HSCT from MUD/ MMUD. 28/36 (80%) patients showed complete donor chimerism in all controls. 5/36 (13%) patients showed low level mixed chimerism up to 20% during follow up. 1 patient died shortly after HSCT, 1 patient showed slowly increasing mixed chimerism and finally developed autologous recovery and one patient rejected the graft.Cumulative incidence of grade II-IV acute graft-versushost disease (aGVHD) of MUD/MMUD was 15,2%, whereas only 2 cases of aGVHD grade I occurred in patients transplanted from MSD/MFD. As 1 patient rejected the graft from a HLA-identical parent, 1 patient transplanted from a HLA-identical grandparent developed autologous recovery after 1 year and 1 patient transplanted from a MUD lost the graft due to hemophagocytosis, the probability of event-free survival was 89,5 % after HSCT from MSD/MFD and 83,9 % from MUD/MMUD.Altogether 34/36 patients (94,4 %) are alive and transfusion-independent with complete donor chimerism two years after HSCT; resulting in an overall survival probability of 93,1%. In contrast, overall survival probability was 100% in the group of patients transplanted from MSD/MFD and 80,1 % in patients transplanted from MUD/ MMUD after 2 years.There were 2 patients with thalassemia (6,9%) who died from transplantation-related causes. The first patient died 13 days after HSCT from a MMUD due to candida sepsis with pulseless electrical activity resulting from cardiac iron overload. The second patient died 5 months after HSCT from a MUD due to graft failure.Conclusions: HSCT from MUD and MMUD is a feasible therapy option for patients with transfusion dependent anemia. Nevertheless, it should be noted that iron overload can cause severe complications; therefore, measurement of liver and heart iron concentration through MRI prior to HSCT as well as phlebotomy after transplantation are advisable.Disclosure: Novartis (consultancy: included expert testimony, speaker bureau, Honoraria), Medac (Research Funding, Patents and Royalties), Riemser (Research Funding), Neovii (Research Funding), Amgen (Honoraria) Background: The therapeutic options for patients with Hodgkin\u00b4s disease who relapse after first high-dose chemotherapy with autologous stem cell (1 st ASCT) support are limited. Allogeneic stem cell transplantation in this setting is associated with a high level of transplant-dependent mortality rates in excess of 50-65%. New agent, such as brentuximab vedotin, have been approved for the treatment of these patients, however, their efficacy to provide longterm control or cure is still unknown. A second autologous stem cell (2 nd ASCT) has historically been considered as an option only in a small group of patients so the published experience is scarce. We report our institution\u00b4s experience with second autologous transplants in this patient population.Methods: We evaluated the outcome of 16 adult patients (7 (44%) female and 9 (56%) male), who received an 2 nd ASCT between 10/2013 and 08/2018. Planned tandem ASCT were excluded. The median age at 2 nd ASCT was 32 years (range 21-54), 15 (94%) patients had a Karnofsky performance score \u226580%. 12 (75%) patients were in complete remission (CR) and 4 (25%) patients were in partial remission (PR) at day 100 after 1 st ASCT. Seven (44%) relapses within 12 months after 1 st ASCT. Patients received a median of 1 (0-3) treatment lines between 1 st ASCT and 2 nd ASCT. Only 4 (25%) patients received brentuximab vedotin and none of the patients in our series received checkpoint inhibitors as salvage after 1 st ASCT. The median interval from 1 st ASCT to relapse/progression was12,9 months (range 2,9-133,3). The median interval from relapse/progression to 2 nd ASCT was 9,2 months (range 1,4-46,6). All patients received BEAM as the conditioning regimen for 1 st ASCT, and BeEAM as the conditioning regimen for 2 nd ASCT.Results: The median time to neutrophil recovery (>0.5x10 9 /L) after 2 nd ASCT were 10 days (range 8-17). Best response at day 100 following 2 nd ASCT included CR in 12 (75%) patients and PR in 3 (19%); 1 (6%) had stable disease. 3 (19%) patients received brentuximab vedotin and none of the patients received checkpoint inhibitors after 2 nd ASCT. 14 (87,5%) patients are currently alive, with a median follow-up 49,8 months (range 4,2-154,2).2 patient died after 2 nd ASCT. Causes of death were HL progression. The 5-year overall survival was 86%.Conclusions: The second ASCT in patients with a longterm response after the first ASCT may be the optimal therapeutic option, the effectiveness of which can be enhanced by using new drugs, such as brentuximab vedotin, at all stages of treatment.Disclosure: Nothing to declare",

Granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) combined with high-dose chemotherapy is a frequently used mobilization approach; however, the optimal mobilization strategy has not been determined.The objective of the study was to analyze the mobilizing potential of different regimens used for the collection of peripheral stem cells in patients with relapsed or refractory (R/R) NHL and HD. Methods: We retrospectively analyzed 40 patients with R/R NHL and HD undergoing stem cell collection after chemo-mobilization in the transplant unit at the University Hospital, Varna. Patients were mobilized after DHAP Letermovir is promising, even as a therapeutic agent. More paediatric data are urgently needed.Disclosure: Nothing to declare P752 Development of paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria in a patient after mudallohsct due to JAK2V617Fpositive myelofibrosis-a case of successful treatment with the second transplantation from another donor Agnieszka Tomaszewska 1 , Barbara Nasi\u0142owska-Adamska 2 , Iwona Solarska 2 , Kazimierz Ha\u0142aburda 2Background: Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) is a very rare disease associated with PIG-A gene mutations in hematopoietic stem cells. There are only single case reports on evolving myeloproliferative diseases to PNH in the literature. There is no data concerning development of PNH de novo after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. In our report we describe a patient with recurrence of JAK2V617-positive myelofibrosis 5 years after matched unrelated donor allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (MUDalloHSCT) with simultaneous development of clinically significant PNH.",

            "text": "A 51 year-old-man with a history of MUDal-loHSCT in May 2011 due to JAK2V617-positive myelofibrosis secondary to essential thrombocythemia was admitted to our department 5 years later with mild anemia (Hb-11.0 g/dL) and elevated lactate dehydrogenase (1400 U/L). During last 5 years he remained in complete remission of myelofibrosis with JAK2V617 mutation negativisation and 100% donor chimerism. Suspecting disease recurrence we performed trephine biopsy confirming myelofibrosis (MF2/MF3) with heterozygous JAK2V617 mutation and in flow cytometry analysis of bone marrow we identified cell membrane defect in myeloid line (loss of CD66c). We decided to perform detailed diagnostic tests on PNH -multiparametric flow cytometry of peripheral blood revealed 89% granulocytes and 15% red blood cells with loss of GPI-anchored proteins -PNH clone. These results corresponded with donor chimerism -it was only 20% of donor DNA in bone marrow and 33% in blood tests. Molecular analysis didn't revealed any mutations in genes: CALR, ASXL1 and MPL. Finally the diagnosis of myelofibrosis recurrence after MUDalloHSCT with presence of PNH clone was established. The therapy with eculizumab was unreachable. So the second alloHSCT from another matched unrelated donor after fludarabinemelphalan-thymoglobuline-TBI 200 cGy conditioning was performed on 21.10.2016. We didn't observe any complications of this procedure, engraftment was slightly delayed: ANC>0.5G/L on the 29 day and PLT>50G/L on the 50 day.Results: At present, more than 2 years after the second MUDalloPBSCT, the patient remains in a very good condition with 100% of the second donor chimerism and without any features of PNH (clone is undetectable) and myelofibrosis.Conclusions: Presented case is the first in the literature well documented myelofibrosis recurrence after MUDal-loHSCT with concurrently development of clinically significant paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria. The second MUDalloHSCT from another donor was safe and successful treatment strategy in this situation.Disclosure: Nothing to declare.",

For diseases in advanced stages, chemotherapy, autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) or immunomodulator drugs may provide remissions with limited duration and the treatment remains substantially palliative 2,3 . These dismal results have induced to explore the therapeutical approach with allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) in such patients.
