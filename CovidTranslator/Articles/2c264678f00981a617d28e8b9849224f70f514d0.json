            "text": "Choice of interaction function is one of the most important parts for modelling a food chain. Many models have been proposed as a diseased-prey predator model with Holling type-I or type-II or type-III interactions, but there is no model with general Holling type interactions. In this paper, we study a diseased prey-predator model with general Holling type interactions. Local stability conditions of equilibrium points are derived. We obtain the permanence and impermanence conditions of the system. The conditions for global stability of the system are also derived. The system exhibits limit cycle, period-2, higher periodic oscillations and chaotic behaviour for different values of Holling parameters. One parameter bifurcation analysis is done with respect to general Holling parameters and infection rate. We utilize the MATCONT package to analyse the detailed bifurcation scenario as the two important interaction parameters are varied. It is interesting to note that a diseased system becomes a disease free system for proper choice of interaction functions. Our results give an idea for constructing a realistic food chain model through proper choice of general Holling parameters.",

            "text": "Mathematical models are increasingly used to guide public health policy decisions and to control infectious disease. Epidemic dynamics is an important method of studying the spread of infectious disease qualitatively and quantitatively. The research results are helpful to predict the developing tendency of the infectious disease, to determine the key factors of the spread of infectious disease and to seek the optimum strategies of preventing and controlling the spread of infectious diseases. Mathematical models have a long history in infectious disease ecology starting with Bernoulli's [1] modelling of smallpox and including Ross's [2] analysis of malaria. The earliest attempt to provide a quantitative understanding of the dynamics of malaria transmission was that of Ross [2] . Ross models consisted of a few differential equations to describe changes in densities of susceptible and infected people, and susceptible and infected mosquitoes. Based on his modelling, Ross introduced the concept of a threshold density and concluded that 'in order to counteract malaria anywhere we need not vanish Anopheles there entirely we need only to reduce their numbers below a certain figure [3] . Classical papers of mathematical modelling of infectious disease was constructed by Kermack and McKendrick (1927 [4] , 1932 [5] , and 1933 [6] ). These papers had a major influence on the development of mathematical models for disease spread and are still relevant in many epidemic situations. Aim of ecological modelling is to understand the prevalence and distribution of a species, together with the factors that determine incidence, spread, and persistence (Anderson and May [7] ; May and Anderson [8] ; Bascompte and Rodriguez-Trelles [9] ). Now we have models for many of the most important human emerging infectious dis-eases e.g., HIV (May and Anderson [10] ), malaria (Aron and May [11] ; Macdonald [12] ), SARS-coronavirus (Anderson et al. [13] ), rabies (Murray and Seward [14] ), and influenza (Ferguson and Anderson [15] ). Mathematical models are also being used to explore wildlife disease dynamics (Grenfell and Dobson [16] ; Hudson et al. [17] ) and possible routes of zoonotic disease emergence. Understanding disease dynamics across hosts is an essential first step in understanding and articulating those conditions under which new diseases can emerge from wildlife reservoirs [18] . A predator-prey system with infected prey in polluted environment is proposed by Sinha et al. [19] . Anderson and May [20] were probably the first who considered the disease factor in a predator-prey dynamics and found that the pathogen tends to destabilize the predator-prey interaction. In Rosenzweig prey-predator model, Hadeler and Freedman [21] determined a threshold above which an infected equilibrium or an infected periodic solution appear. Chattopadhyay and Arino [22] considered a three species ecoepidemiological model and studied local stability of equilibrium points, extinction criteria of species and found condition for Hopf-bifurcation in an equivalent two-dimensional model. Haque and Chattopadhyay [23] studied the role of transmissible diseases in a prey dependent predator-prey system with prey infection. Haque and Venturino reported the influence of transmissible disease in prey taking Holling-Tanner predator-prey model [24] . The dynamical behaviour of the predator-prey system was investigated when a predator avoids infected prey and the predator has alternative sources of food ( [25, 26] ). Bhattacharyya et al. [27] proposed a epidemiological model with nonlinear infection incidence. Das et al. [28] modified the HP model by introducing disease in the prey population. They derived conditions for population extinction and the conditions for permanent or impermanent of the system. Sahoo and Poria described a diseased prey-predator model supplying additional food to predator for biological control [29] . Recently, Haque et al. investigated predator-infected eco-epidemics systems with different functional responses [30] .",

            "text": "All food chain models use some realistic interaction functions between preys and predators based on some biological hypothesis. A realistic interaction function should not allow the predators to grow arbitrarily fast, if prey is abundant. Apart from these basic biological considerations, Holling interaction functions are taken as simplest realistic interactions. Holling type-II function is defined as F\u00f0X\u00de \u00bc AX K\u00feX , where A is the maximum predation rate and K is half saturation constant. The function increase linearly if X is small. At large values of X the slope of the function F 0 \u00f0X\u00de decreases as predator becomes saturated but F 0 \u00f0X\u00de always remains non-negative. Actually, the Holling type-II function is based on the assumption that predation rate is proportional to prey density if prey is scarce. However, if the predator actively seeks out large concentration of prey the Holling type-III function F\u00f0X\u00de \u00bc AX 2 K 2 \u00feX 2 is more appropriate. Since the slope of this function goes to zero for small values of X it may be suspected that the food chain will be destabilized if prey concentration becomes too small. The general Holling func- tion is defined as F\u00f0X\u00de \u00bc AX a K a \u00feX a , where a > 0 ( [34] [35] [36] ). The behaviour of different types response functions are shown in Fig. 1 for different values of a.",

We have shown system's dynamics for different values of a; b and infection rate a in Fig. 2 and Fig. 3. From Fig. 2 and   Fig. 3 , we observe that the system (2) have periodic oscillations as well as chaotic bands for different general Holling parameters and infection rate. From Figs. 4 and 5, we observe limit cycle, period-2 to period-7 and chaotic dynamics. The global stability behaviour of the system (2) with different initial conditions is presented in Fig. 6 for different Holling parameter values a and b. Therefore, oscillatory as well as stability nature of the diseased prey population can be captured for a range of Holling parameter values. Das et al. [28] observed chaotic dynamics of the system (2) for a \u00bc 1:15, the period-doubling for a \u00bc 1:17, the limit cycle oscillation for a \u00bc 1:2 and finally stable steady state distribution of all four species for a \u00bc 1:3 for a particular value of a \u00bc 1 and b \u00bc 1 using above set of parameter values. Here we have investigated the dynamics for a \u00bc 1:15 with different Holling interactions through bifurcation analysis.",

For this Hopf point the first Lyapunov coefficient turns out to be \u00c00:1726285, indicating a supercritical Hopf bifurcation. It being negative implies that a stable limit cycle bifurcates from the equilibrium when this looses stability. The branch points (BP) occur at b \u00bc 1:051086 and at b \u00bc 1:398560.

Now it should be recapitulated that we have started with two parameters a and b as bifurcation parameters. To start with we show in Fig. 7 (b) the continuation curve from the Hopf (H) point with respect to b. We observe six generalized Hopf (GH) At the generalized Hopf (GH) points, where the first Lyapunov coefficient vanishes indicating that all GH points are nondegenerate, since the second Lyapunov coefficients are non-zero. The Bogdanov-Taken points are common points for the limit point curves and curves corresponding to equilibria with eigenvalues k 1 \u00fe k 2 \u00bc 0; k 3 -0. Actually, at each BT point, the Hopf bifurcation curve (with k 1;2 \u00bc AEix; x > 0) turn into the neutral saddle curve (with real k 1 \u00bc \u00c0k 2 ). Now, we start LP point continuation from a Bogdanov-Taken (BT) point. If we choose b and a as free parameters and start from the BT point, the continuation curve shows two BT points and two cusp points (CP) which is shown in Fig. 8(a) .

This phenomenon is shown in Fig. 10(a) , where again the Holling parameter b in the system is the only free parameter. One observes that at b \u00bc 1:025252, we have a LPC point with period 83.36766. At this situation two cycles collide and disappears. The critical cycle has a double multiplier equal to 1. From this it follows that a stable branch occurs after the LPC point. For b \u00bc 1:028799, another LPC point occurs with one of the multiplier is greater than 1 which indicates that the cycle is unstable after LPC point. At b \u00bc 1:023759 there is a period doubling (PD) with period 92.32825, two of the multiplier is equal to 1. However, for b \u00bc 1:003603, we observe PD again with period 102:9418, one of the multiplier is greater than 1. At b \u00bc 1:002767 and b \u00bc 1:013483, LPC's are observed with period 105:6208 and 113:8772 respectively. For b \u00bc 0:9888908, we have a branch point cycle (BPC) with period 133:5280. If we choose b and period of the cycles as free parameters and start from the Hopf point (H), as shown in Fig. 7(a) , then the corresponding variation of period versus b is shown in Fig. 10(b) . The similar analysis is done starting from the second Hopf point (H) as initial point, as shown in Fig. 7(a) at b \u00bc 1:540269, and we observe family of stable LPC in Fig. 11(a) . The variation of period versus b is shown in Fig. 11(b) . The corresponding scenario for s; p 1 and p 2 is exhibited in Figs. 12 and 13 . Our above analysis shows that a rich bifurcation structure exists for the predator-prey system with different Holling interactions, when a and b are varied over a wide range of values. It is to be noted that these two parameters represent two important physical quantities in the actual situation, respectively, biological pest control and agricultural research field. As such it may happen that such changes in behaviour may manifest in experimental studies also and so we need further extension of this studies.",

We derive sufficient conditions for local stability of equilibrium points. We also analyse the permanence and impertinence conditions of the system. The conditions for global stability are also obtained for different Holling parameters. We have explored the detailed bifurcation scenario of the proposed system varying the interaction function parameters a and b. The interesting outcomes are the occurrence of various kinds of bifurcation points in the process of continuation. Altogether our analysis reveals the internal complexity of the system in detailed manner. Bifurcation analysis shows that the dynamics of susceptible prey, infected prey, intermediate predator and top-predator are highly effected by the force of infection a as well as the interaction parameters a and b, which is in sharp contrast with the existing results [24] [25] [26] . From the simulation results, it is clear that the infected prey extinct for proper choice of interaction functions. Therefore, a diseased system reduces to a disease free system with proper choice of general Holling parameters. Therefore, we can succesfully control a disease by controlling interaction function from outside in ecosystem. We observe various types of non-unique bifurcation diagrams with respect to bifurcation parameters a; b and a respectively, having stable fixed point, limit cycle, period-2 to higher periodic oscillations, chaotic bands etc. We notice that the infected prey may survive in the system for some range of values of general Holling parameters.",

Our observations indicate that chaos disappear for suitable choice of interaction functions. The most important observation is that our model with Holling type-II interaction (for a \u00bc 1; b \u00bc 1) shows chaotic behaviour but for a 2 \u00bd1:16; 1:56; b \u00bc 0:98 it shows periodic behaviour. The periodic dynamical behaviour of species was reported by many researchers from the field data [44] and laboratory data [45] . Therefore, the model with Holling type-II interactions does not always realistic in ecology, because there are lots of real food chain model which are not chaotic, but depicts oscillatory coexistence. Therefore, we conclude that a realistic food chain model depends on proper choice of general Holling parameters. Novelty of our observation is that one can control an infectious disease if the interaction functions can be controlled from outside. As research extends to higher level, we must need to continue the study for construction of real food chain model with proper general Holling interactions.",
