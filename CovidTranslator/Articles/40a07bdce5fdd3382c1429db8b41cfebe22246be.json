Findings showed that both the public and journalists' evaluations were varied by the manipulation of author notification. That is, the public gave higher scores to the algorithm's work when it was notified as the real author, but they gave lower scores to the algorithm's work when the author was notified as a journalist. It confirmed the public's negative attitude toward journalists' credibility and craving for new information and communication technology (ICT) products/services in Korea. Based on journalists' resistance to change and innovation and the theory of prejudice, it was expected that journalists would be favorable to another journalist's work and unfavorable to an algorithm's work. However, contrary to the hypothetical expectation, journalists also gave higher scores to an algorithm's work and lower scores to a journalist's work. Implications relating to the intrusion of algorithm-written articles into journalism were discussed.",

Among the data-oriented practices emerging in journalism, Carlson (2015) noted that none appear to be as potentially disruptive as automated journalism, insofar as it calls up concerns about the future of journalistic labor, news compositional forms, and the very foundation of journalistic authority. Meanwhile, automated content with no human intervention beyond the initial programming can make journalists free from handling basic works and afford time to focus on more investigative reporting. It could be an opportunity for media companies to reinvent news production system by generating news faster, at a larger scale, and with fewer errors. It also could be beneficial for audience pursuing more news and unbiased reporting.",

In their widely discussed book The Second Machine Age, Brynjolfsson and McAfee (2014) offered an unsettling picture of the likely effects of automation on employment. They asserted that there's never been a better time to be a worker with special skills or the right education, because these people can use technology to create and capture value. However, there's never been a worse time to be a worker with only 'ordinary' skills and abilities to offer, because computers, robots, and other digital technologies are acquiring these skills and abilities at an extraordinary rate (Brynjolfsson & McAfee, 2014, p. 11) .",

How does the public perceive and evaluate the quality of computer-written news articles? Can they tell the differences between articles written by a human journalist and algorithms? Journalists perceive themselves as a professional group differentiated with the public, because they have expertise and duty. Then, how do journalists' perception and evaluations of algorithm-written articles compare with those from the public? This study compares the perceived quality of algorithm-written articles with the work by human journalists. To answer the questions, we sampled both general readers and journalists and conducted a series of experiments with human-and algorithm-written articles.",

For this reason, there have been increasing attention to the impact of algorithm and data in journalism. Some of recent studies focused on the computational journalism using qualitative interviews and textual analysis. Young and Hermida (2015) found that computational thinking and techniques emerged in a (dis) continuous evolution of organizational norms, practices, content, identities, and technologies that interdependently led to new product. Carlson (2015) contended with the emergent practice of automated news content creation both in how it alters the working practices of journalists and how it affects larger understandings of what journalism is, and how it ought to operate.",

Diakopoulos (2015) identified the algorithmic power as something worthy of scrutiny by computational journalists interested in accountability reporting. He tried to show how transparency might be used to effectively adhere to journalistic norms in the use of newsroom algorithms. Using algorithm as part of the journalistic process is not, by any means, a new phenomenon. However, the use of software to actually write a news story is a new advancement (Clerwall, 2014) .

While the softwaregenerated content was perceived as more descriptive and boring, it was also considered to be more informative, objective, accurate, and trustworthy. In this study, the respondents were also asked to assess whether the text had been written by a journalist or by a computer. Of the 27 respondents who read the software-generated text, 10 thought a journalist wrote it and 17 thought it was software-generated. Out of 18 journalists, 8 thought a journalist wrote it, but 10 thought software wrote it. In other words, respondents failed to assess the author of the article correctlydwhether it was written by a journalist or a computer. Overall, journalistic content produced by an algorithm was not or was barely discernible from content written by a journalist in this experiment.",

Public criticism has been mounting against the Korean media because they dismissed the truth, published provocative stories, and parroted the government's announcements without checking the facts and questioning them. A growing number of people have called reporters \"giregi\"da mix of the Korean words meaning reporter and trashdin the wake of the Sewol tragedy.

According to these results, journalists in Korea fall short of the required ethical standards that are set in the audience's minds. Historically, trust in journalists and news organizations has not been high in Korea. In particular, misinformation about the Sewol ferry sinking in 2014 and about the outbreak of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome in 2015 affected trust in the news media. A survey on the news consumption conducted by Reuters Institute for the Study of Journalism in 2016 revealed that Koreans' trust for journalists and news organizations was only 17%, which was ranked the 25th out of 26 developed countries participated in the survey (Reuters Institute, 2016) .",

By stressing the boundaries between the outsider and the journalistic profession, hegemony may be sustained. Previous studies have examined the manner by which professionalization works in the field of journalism. Since Thomas Gieryn (1983) suggested the concept of \"boundary work\", many researchers have devoted to the demarcation problem and how does it work within a large occupational, political, and economic social structure. For example, Zelizer (1992) identifies journalists as an \"interpretive community\" whose authority stems from discursive source operating both inside and outside the professional sphere. However, one obvious thing is professional claims serve to draw boundary line between those on the \"inside\" and \"outside of the profession.",

The computer reduced the labor intensity of journalists in editing and reporting (Howard, 2014) . These technologies also reduced the number of employees in the newsroom. For example, the 'operator' as technician of the metal type has been disappeared by computer. But, disappeared occupational group in newsroom such as operator did not belong to journalistic profession. These groups were assistant of journalists. Of course, journalists had been compelled to adopt computer as a new reporting and editing device. However, journalists thought of computer as assistant of them.

Again they are forced to position themselves in relation to an external threat, which potentially challenges their jurisdiction over their main tasks. Van Dalen (2012) studied the response of the journalistic community to automatic content creation by analyzing 68 newspaper articles and blog posts covering Statsheet, an automated sports news creation site, during 2010. Contrary to previous studies that described the journalistic community as conservative and defensive, journalists who wrote about robot journalists did not reject the new development. Van Dalen (2012) interpreted this finding for three different reasons. First, the journalists who wrote about robot journalists can be seen as early adopters who are more open to change than the journalistic community at large. Second, because automated content creation is mostly applied to sports journalism rather than domains like politics or international affairs, journalists might be more generous. Finally, the journalists who wrote about automated-content analysis are observant of a trend that still remains largely abstract and does not influence their own work directly.",

Journalists might draw a boundary between the outsider and the journalistic profession (Van Dalen, 2012) . Contemporary research on intergroup relations, prejudice, and discrimination appears to accept, at least implicitly, the idea that ingroup favoritism and outgroup negativity are reciprocally related. The idea can be derived from a number of theoretical assumptions. In an environment of scarcity, individuals needed to band together in groups to compete with other groups for survival (Sumner, 1906) . Another approach to ingroup-outgroup distinction can be explained by the zero-sum perspective in which attachment and positive affect toward an ingroup is achieved through distance and negative affect toward corresponding outgroups. In fact, it is a sense universally true that \"we\" are more peaceful, trustworthy, friendly, and honest than \"they.\" This is reinforced by a general preference for the familiar over the unfamiliar (Brewer, 1999) . Following zero-sum perspective, journalists would perceive algorithms replace their job. Otherwise, journalist would perceive the algorithms' works as complementary.",

Snowball sampling is a nonprobability approach to sampling design and inference in hard-to-reach, or equivalently, hidden population. Standard statistical sampling method requires a list of population members from which the sample can be drawn. Although snowball sampling for journalist hinders the generalization of the results, this study adopted the snowball sampling method because it is difficult to gather journalists' samples systematically. This study selected the first participants among the list of journalists, which participated the previous research in Korea Press Foundation. Study 2 also adopted a two (author of the article: algorithm or journalist) by two (notification of author: real or inverse) between subject design. Participants were assigned to one of four conditions identical to Study 1. Each cell had about 40 participants. The manipulations, \"this article is written by an algorithm\" or \"this article is written by a journalist,\" were shown on the instructions. Two groups were aware of the correct author of each article, and the other two groups read the article with wrong information about the author of the article. After reading the assigned article, each respondent ranked the quality of the article (well written, clear, professional, and credible) on a 5-point Likert scale (1 \u00bc not at all to 5 \u00bc extremely).",

Following Allport's (1954) and Brewer's (1999) alternative views, it is assumed that although human journalists in this experiment perceive a journalist who wrote the tested article as a member of the ingroup, the journalists' ingroup identification did not necessarily lead to negative evaluation of the algorithm. Moreover, in the absence of realistic conflict between human journalists and algorithm writers, neither strong ingroup attachment nor outgroup hostility was effective. In fact, since this study only tested a sports article, journalists in general did not perceive strong ingroup attachment to the human article. Since algorithmwritten articles are published in sports and stock market reporting areas in a limited way in Korea, journalists did not seem to show any hostility to algorithm-written news yet.",

According to previous literatures, journalists framed an algorithm as a tool to facilitate systematic coverage and freeing journalists to add more depth, context, and the human touch, as well as possibly decrease costs (Young & Hermida, 2015) . Van Dalen (2012) reached a similar conclusion about the impact of algorithmic journalism.

In other words, expectation for an algorithm's work was presumably low, but after reading the article, people thought it was better than expected. An article written by an algorithm was a positive surprise to people. After reading the journalist's article, people were disappointed because it could not meet the quality expectations.

Van Dalen (2012) adds that journalists see the advantages of an algorithm as an unbiased reporter. Tow Center for Digital Journalism suggests other potentials for algorithms in journalism (Graefe, 2016) . Algorithms are able to generate news faster, at a larger scale, and potentially with fewer errors than human journalists. Algorithms can use the same data to tell stories in multiple languages and from different angles, thus personalizing them to an individual reader's preferences.

If factual errors are discovered, does the software take responsibility? There are other ethical questions such as transparency and copyright. Although most journalists expect the robots will work as complementary to rather than replacing their jobs, automated content creation can be serious competition and a threat to the job security of journalists performing basic routine tasks (Van Dalen, 2012) . In fact, changes in news organizations have been due to coercion from above and to weak-tie connectivity with the organization's market and readers (Lowrey, 2011) .
