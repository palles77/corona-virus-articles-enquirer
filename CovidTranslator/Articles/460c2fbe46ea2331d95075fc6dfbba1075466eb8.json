            "text": "Cruise ship travel has gained tremendous popularity over the last four decades. In 2016, 24 million passengers on 448 ships sailed on worldwide cruises. Cruise destinations such as the Caribbean and Mediterranean have gained popularity due to climate as well as accessibility to many ports. The ever-expanding cruise itineraries (including 184 river cruise ships), which include diverse ports of call, along with a growth in the number of embarkation ports and onboard amenities, provide travelers with convenient and comfortable means to sample different parts of the world in a short amount of time. 2 With the growing popularity of recreational cruises, gastrointestinal (GI) and respiratory disease outbreaks may be amplified by the densely populated, semiclosed cruise environment, which compels international passengers and crew to share many activities and resources. Moreover, passengers can acquire a new infectious disease while in port through contaminated food, water, or infected people. 3 Environmental contamination of cruise ships may result in protracted outbreaks due to infected crew and passengers who remain onboard during successive voyages. Sanitation and disease surveillance programs developed through the cooperation of the cruise industry and public health agencies have led to improved detection and control of communicable diseases. 4 Understanding the most frequently reported diseases on cruise ships, their source and mode of transmission, prevention measures, and available ship medical care facilities can lead to better preparedness for a healthy cruise vacation. 5",

Sailboats and yachts are best known for niche travel, such as \"eco-touring.\" River cruises are popular for providing an informal, intimate atmosphere while traveling to places such as the Nile and the Amazon. Ocean cruises make up the greatest portion of ship-based leisure travel, with the North American cruise industry accounting for the major part of the global ocean cruise market. The North American cruise industry consists of cruise lines that market cruises primarily to North Americans but have embarkation ports worldwide. The Caribbean remains the top cruise destination, followed by Alaska, the Mediterranean, and other parts of Europe. Depending on the type of cruise, the duration can range from hours (e.g., gambling cruises) to several months (e.g., round-the-world cruises). The average duration of a cruise is 9 days, and approximately 58% of cruising passengers choose 6-8-day cruises. The typical 7-day cruise allows passengers ample time to visit three to five ports and explore different locales and cultures. 1",

Updates of outbreaks are posted on VSP's website (www.cdc.gov/nceh/vsp/surv/gilist.htm) on all ships calling on US ports. More than 90% of GI outbreaks investigated by VSP with a confirmed cause are due to NoV. 14, 22 During NoV outbreaks on cruises the original source of infection may be an infected person or food. Further spread, resulting in large numbers of illnesses, mainly occurs by person-to-person transmission of the virus. 16 Most NoV outbreaks can be characterized by high attack rates, a high prevalence of vomiting, short duration of illness, and confirmation with polymerase chain reaction (PCR) techniques. The key to controlling the spread of NoV on cruise ships is the rapid implementation of infection control measures at the first signs of an AGE outbreak; these include hand-washing before eating and after bathroom use plus frequent cleaning of common areas, staterooms, elevator buttons, and hand rails, and limiting guest contact with serving utensils in buffet lines during the first 2 days of the cruise. Also it is recommended that ill passengers seek medical care in the ship's medical center as soon as GI symptoms develop (see Fig. 40.1 ). 17",

Cruise travel can expose travelers to infectious agents, pollutants, changes in diet, physical exertion, extremes of weather, and other conditions that can exacerbate chronic medical conditions. Cruise ships built during the past 10 years generally have some cabins designed to accommodate wheelchairs. Information regarding wheelchair access can be obtained from the individual cruise lines or the CLIA website. 6 Depending on the medical condition, some cruise lines may require that the traveler have a travel companion. Assisted-living type of care must be provided by the passenger. Medical facilities on most modern cruise ships are comparable to those of a land-based urgent care center, some much better; however, limitations and variability in the level of care available exist between cruise lines and individual ships-and at shore-side hospitals during port stops. 6 For this reason, and to protect the health of others on board, passengers with acute medical problems or those who acquire an infectious disease before travel should be encouraged to postpone travel and call the cruise lines to discuss alternatives.

An estimated 25 million passengers are forecast to sail in 2017 (majority from North America). 2 The occurrence of shipboard illnesses and outbreaks related to GI, respiratory, and vaccine-preventable diseases has led to improved infectious disease surveillance and control strategies by the cruise industry and public health agencies. 5 Pretravel health preparations and knowledge of available medical care aboard cruise ships are important for cruise travelers, especially given that approximately one-third are senior citizens who may have chronic illnesses or who may be at greater risk for some infectious diseases. 6 Because medical facilities aboard cruise ships are designed to provide basic emergency medical care, travelers should be encouraged to consult their health insurance provider regarding extra coverage while away from their home country and for medical evacuation. 6 ",
