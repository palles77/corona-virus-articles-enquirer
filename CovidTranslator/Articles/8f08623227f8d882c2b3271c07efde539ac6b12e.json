Video-laryngoscope with a disposable blade works well with a transparent plastic cover to protect the screen and handle. Clearly designated disposal sites for airway equipment that are contaminated can help reduce exposure. Placing a wet gauze on the patient's mouth and nose during positive pressure ventilation reduces droplet dispersion. A full dose of muscle relaxant should be injected at one time and tracheal intubation performed only when muscle relaxants are fully active to prevent coughing. Healthcare providers may want to consider the risks and benefits of giving opioid analgesics prior to induction of general anesthesia since they can lead to significant coughing (21) . Heat and moisture exchanging filters are recommended on both the inspiration port and the aspiration port of the respiratory circuit and should be replaced every 3 to 4 hours. There is evidence that filters can effectively reduce contamination of the anesthesia machine with pathogens including bacteria or viruses.",

The latter leads to an acceptable choice of materials and techniques for personal protection and prevention of cross contamination to other patients and staff. We present a protocolized approach that uses diagnostic criteria to clearly define benchmarks from the medical history along with clinical symptoms and laboratory tests. Patients can then be rapidly assigned into one of three risk categories that direct the choice of protective materials and/or techniques. Each hospital can adapt this approach to develop a system that fits its individual resources. Educating medical staff about proper use of high risk areas for containment serves to protect staff and patients. ",

A lower respiratory tract sample such as expectorated sputum, tracheal aspirate, or bronchoalveolar lavage can be used in intubated patients (19). Testing is recommended in all patients with signs or 4 symptoms of infection. Geographic areas with high infection rates such as South Korea offer testing to all residents while others test those who report contact with a known infected person. Post infection testing is done routinely in some countries as asymptomatic individuals who recovered from a known infection can still carry and transmit the virus. All health care workers should be familiar with the recommendations for RT-PCR testing in their geographic region. The inability to obtain deep respiratory secretions or an inadequate nasopharyngeal swab for screening can result in a high false-negative rate of nucleic acid detection and difficulty in diagnosis and excluding COVID-19 infection from other types of respiratory infections. Serological detection specific IgM antibodies is possible at 3-5days after exposure. In the recovery period IgG antibody titers can be four times or higher than that of the acute phase(19).",

A clearly written protocol for evaluation and management should be posted in each hospital and the corresponding care sites to assure that all care providers follow the same approach.Patients with any criteria suggestion of COVID-19 infection and those with insufficient findings or information to determine the risk of infection should be isolated and referred to an infectious disease expert. In an emergent situation with insufficient time to assess the risk of infection, patients should be treated as active cases and at the highest risk of transmission. Most hospitals in the People's Republic of China, screen all elective patients for COVID-19 prior to surgery. This preventative position was taken to control the growing epidemic crisis. The intent was to eliminate all possible cross-infection to healthcare workers and patients in the perioperative care areas and operating room. The progressive reduction in cases suggests this is an effective technique. Partition management and personnel allocation in OR for suspected/diagnosed patients Patients may require emergency/urgent care in any hospital setting. Some hospitals are more prepared to receive patients with COVID-19 infection than smaller community care sites. Hospitals that do not have advanced infrastructure for multiple isolation and quarantine care should consider transferring confirmed or suspected cases to facilities with available containment. All patients without adequate screening or testing should be treated as active cases and cared for in a negative pressure / isolation operating room. Containment areas should have strict partitions where the clean area, buffer zone (supporting space outside the operating room) and contaminated area (negative pressure / isolation operation room) are clearly marked for easy recognition by every team member. Infected patients or those who are awaiting results of COVD-19 testing should wear medical surgical masks during care.In the operating room, anesthesiologists should use closed circuits and take all measures to minimize coughing following extubation. Anesthetic and resuscitation medicines, devices and surgical instruments should be well prepared in advance to reduce the number of entry and exit to the operating room. Specific personnel assigned to buffer area can be responsible for communication between areas and replenishing items. All medical personnel participating in the operation must wear protective equipment and implement personal protection according to the infection control regulations(Figure 2).",
