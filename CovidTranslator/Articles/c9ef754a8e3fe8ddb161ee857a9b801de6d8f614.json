When doors are closed, current negative pressure designs are effective for the containment of airborne pathogens in the 'dirty' cubicle with an index patient. When the 'dirty' cubicle door is open, airborne agents can move into the other 'clean' cubicle via the shared anteroom. As the door being opened or closed, the door sweeping effect is the main source of the two-way airflow and contaminant exchange through the doorway. When the dirty cubicle door remains fully open, temperature difference and concentration gradient across the doorway induce the two-way buoyancy-driven flow and transport of airborne agents across the doorway. The longer the dirty cubicle door remains fully open (10 s, 30 s or 60 s) or the smaller the air change rate (34e8.5 ACH for each cubicle), the more airborne pathogens are being transported into the 'clean' cubicle and the longer time it takes to remove them after the door is closed. Keeping the door completely open is potentially responsible for the majority of inter-cubicle transmissions if its duration is much longer than the duration of door motion (only 3 s). Our analyses suggest a potential inter-cubicle infection risk if the shared anteroom is used for multiple isolation cubicles. Decreasing the duration of door opening, raising air change rate or using a curtain at the doorway are recommended to reduce inter-cubicle exposure hazards.",

For example, in the early 21st century, more than 8000 cases of SARS were reported, resulting in 774 deaths [1] . Infection transmission in hospitals for such highly infectious diseases is an important public health issue. Besides direct or indirect contact transmissions [2] , respiratory infectious diseases can also be spread by airborne transmission of droplet nuclei over large distance. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) includes the use of administrative measures and engineering controls among its recommendations for reducing exposure risk in health care facilities [3] . Negative pressure isolation cubicles are usually built to accommodate patients in which a slightly negative pressure relative to the surrounding area may effectively prevent infectious agents from escaping out of isolation cubicles [3, 4] . Some design guidelines are widely accepted [3, 4] . US CDC guidelines and relevant international standards are in agreement with respect to requiring a ventilation rate of 12 air change rates per hour (ACH) [3, 4] .",

To reduce the risk of infectious droplets and particles escaping into the corridor, an anteroom is commonly added to separate the cubicle and the corridor. With a higher pressure than the isolation cubicle and lower pressure than the corridor, the anteroom acts as an airlock. Tung et al. [6] reported that, if the isolation cubicle door is open and the air velocity through the doorway is less than 0.2 m/s, risk of droplet nuclei leakage into the anteroom is high. Small-scale experiments and theoretical models [7, 8] confirmed that the opening and closing motion of hinged doors can induce transient airflows and turbulence close to the doorway, followed by air exchange and the transport of airborne particles into the anteroom through the doorway. In addition, health care worker (HCW) movement is a significant factor in the spread of airborne pathogens and particles [9e19] .",

Rydock and Eian [9] carried out tracer gas experiments in which sulfur hexafluoride (SF 6 ) was released at the patient bed position and allowed to mix in the room for 2 min before the release technician exited the room into the anteroom. The technician waited an additional 3 min in the anteroom before entering the adjacent corridor. Subsequently, SF6 was readily detected in both the anteroom and the corridor, indicating tracer gas leakage into the anteroom and corridor during HCW movement. Johnson et al. [10] also reported that containment efficiency was greatly reduced during HCW movement into and out of an expedient isolation enclosure. After fluorescent microspheres were released in the isolation cubicle (particle diameter of 2 mm), Adams et al. [11] measured airborne concentrations in the anteroom and at the corridoreanteroom door with and without HCW movement. They found that containment efficiency rose with greater negative pressure differential, and fell with an increase in human traffic.",

            "text": "Use of a dynamic mesh technique combined with computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations [12e17] has recently allowed simulation of transport of infectious agents induced by door motion and human movement. Using large eddy simulations, Choi and Edward [12] found that for a non-hospital environment the motion of hinged door and realistic human walking did enhance compartment-to-compartment contaminant transport between two rooms through the doorway and a shared vestibule. Poussou et al. [13] and Mazumdar et al. [14] numerically found that humanmovement-induced wake may carry contaminant to positions far from the source location in an airplane cabin. For hospital isolation rooms with higher air change rates, some published studies verified that the velocity and pressure field were significantly affected by human motion and/or door motion [15e19]. However there was only a small change in airborne transmission of airborne agents, and the risk quickly returned to its original level after the door was closed and HCW motion stoped [15e17]. Hang et al. [17] reported ventilation design and air change rates in a six-bed isolation room affected airborne transmission much more than human motion. Goldasteh [18] and Wang and Chow [19] found that human motion can significantly influence particle re-suspension and particle dispersion in the isolation room. Most airborne transmissions are via dispersion of droplets/ particles. Previous studies have confirmed that droplets/particles of different sizes are released from breathing, coughing, or sneezing and then undergo evaporative water loss in the air. There have been a number of studies on evaporation, dispersion and deposition of respiratory droplets as well as tracer gas dispersion in various indoor environments under different ventilation systems [19e38] .",

Both fine particles and gaseous pathogens are significantly influenced by ventilation rates and airflow patterns [19e38] . Yin et al. [38] experimentally studied an one-bed isolation room under the mixing or displacement ventilation system. They found that fine particles (diameter 1 mm and 3 mm) and tracer gas can generate similar contaminant distributions in most region of the ward, except in the areas close to the contaminant source and the exhaust adjacent to the restroom, where the flow may be unstable.",

Moreover the impact of smaller air change rates (21.25 and 8.5 ACH, 25% of the operating air change rates) was also investigated in CFD simulations. [39] was used to simulate indoor turbulent flows. Large eddy simulation (LES) demands more computer memory and a longer simulation time [12] . Among the Reynolds Averaged NaviereStokes (RANS) turbulence models, the RNG ke\u03b5 model was applied because it was reported to be suitable in terms of accuracy, computing efficiency, and robustness for modeling indoor environments [40] . The steady flow field and gaseous concentration field when both doors were closed (i.e. t \u00bc 0 s) were first solved, then the transient door motion was simulated. The governing equations were discretized using a finite volume method (FVM). The second-order upwind scheme was used for discretizing the convection terms. The SIMPLE algorithm was used to couple pressure and velocity. The Boussinesq model was adopted for the buoyancy effect.",

In Test 2A (Fig. 3a) Since it is difficult to experimentally capture the evidence of inter-cubicle airborne transmission if the duration of door opening is only 30 s, in Test 4A (Fig. 3b) , we opened and closed both doors together, with both remaining fully open for 300 s. Concentration data was sampled at least once when the doors were fully open, therefore, the concentration at P1 in 'dirty' Room 1 was found to decrease by about 90% at t \u00bc 284 s, and tended to recover after Door 1 was closed. This fact confirms that the concentration distribution in Room 1 completely changed while Door 1 remained fully open for 300 s. In addition, the concentration at P-anter in Test 4A increased by 1396% at t \u00bc 164 s. Moreover the concentration at P2 in Test 4A increased by 76% at t \u00bc 239 s. Finally, the concentration decrease at P-anter after Door 1 was closed indicates that contaminants in the anteroom were gradually removed after Door 1 was closed.",

            "text": "Case [34, 10 s] is presented as an example. Fig. 7aef shows isosurfaces of contaminant concentration at different times. Gaseous contaminants start spreading from Room 1 into the anteroom after Door 1 begins opening (t \u00bc 0.1 and 0.5 s, Fig. 7aeb ). More agents enter Room 2 from 3 s to 13 s while Door 1 remains fully open (Fig. 7c at 12 s) and from 13 s to 16 s while Door 1 is closing (Fig. 7d  at 15.1 s) . After Door 1 is closed at t \u00bc 16 s, the concentration in Room 2 first rises (Fig. 7e at 32 s) , then decreases. For example, at 167 s (Fig. 7f) the concentration in Room 1 approximates its original level and those in the anteroom and in Room 2 become low. To quantify the concentration variation, Fig. 7g shows normalized spatial average concentration <C(t)>/<C 1 (0)> in Room 2 and the anteroom for Case [34, 10 s], where <C 1 (0)>\u00bc13.47 ppm is the spatial average concentration in Room 1 at t \u00bc 0 s in this case. The anteroom first experiences a peak of <C > max \u00bc 1.52 ppm at t \u00bc 15.2 s, and afterward <C> decreases. After Door 1 is closed at t \u00bc 16 s, <C> in the anteroom decreases more quickly, while <C> in Room 2 continues increasing until it reaches the maximum concentration of <C> max \u00bc 0. (Fig. 11b) . . The opening motion of Door 1 produces two-way airflows and contaminant transport (Figs. 8 and 11 ). Firstly, we define 'the swept volume of door motion' as the space Door 1 passes and moves through. The sweeping motion of Door 1, coupled with the flow from Transfer grille 0 produces a negative flow rate leaving the anteroom and entering Room 1 through the swept volume (Figs. 8a  and 11) . Secondly, the door motion produces a higher pressure in Room 1 than in the anteroom (Fig. 8b) . The pressure is relatively low near the top and bottom of the doorway where considerable positive flow rate (Q(in) in Fig. 11a) is produced, and which is the main reason for contaminant flux entering the anteroom from Room 1 (Q c (\u00fe) in Fig. 11b ). Vortexes are induced near the tip of Door 1 (Fig. 8a) which are also reported in the literature [7, 8] . In this period Door 2 is always closed, and contaminant flux through Transfer grille 2 (Fig. 11b) is small because little contaminant reaches Transfer grille 2 over such a short duration (3 s). Another type of two-way airflow and contaminant exchange was generated (Fig. 9a) . The temperature difference between the anteroom and Room 1, combined with airflow from Transfer grille 0 and the entire ventilation system is the main cause of contaminant leakage. Since the net flow rate across the doorway of Door 1 is about \u00c00.2112 m 3 /s in Case [34, 10 s] and its cross area is 2.444 m 2 , the average velocity is only \u00c00.08 m/s, which is not sufficient to prevent contaminant leakage out of Room 1 when Door 1 remains fully open (0.2 m/ s required by Tung et al. [6] ). Contaminants mainly enter the anteroom through the top of Door 1 and Transfer grille 1 (Fig. 11b) . Chen et al. [44] reported similar findings in a hospital ward consisting of four cubicles with 'positive pressure' towards their shared corridor. If the door is open, the slightly higher temperature in the corridor compared with the cubicles does induce two-way air exchange and contaminant transport across the doorway from one source cubicle into the corridor, and subsequently into the other 'clean' cubicles. A good technique is to install curtains at the doorway [45] which can reduce the area of the doorway and thus increase this average velocity through it. Over this period (3 s < t < 13 s), as displayed in 10 and 11) . Pressure in the anteroom is relatively higher than in Room 1 (Fig. 10a) . The closing motion also induces vortexes behind Door 1 and a two-way airflow pattern (Fig. 10 ). Fig. 11aeb shows that there is considerable positive flow rate and contaminant flux into the anteroom across the doorway of Door 1 due to the sweeping effect of the closing motion. Meanwhile there is much greater negative flow rate and contaminant flux re-entering Room 1 through the bottom and top of the doorway and Transfer grille 1. Negative contaminant fluxes entering Room 2 through Transfer grille 2 continue to rise (Fig. 11b) . As displayed in Fig. 7g , <C(t)> in the anteroom reaches its maximum value at t \u00bc 15.2 s. As shown in Fig. 11b , total Qc of the anteroom becomes negative after t \u00bc 15.2 s, i.e. the negative contaminant fluxes leaving the anteroom across Door 1 doorway and Transfer grilles 1 and 2 (Qc(\u00c0)\u00feQc(grille 2) \u00feQc(grille 1)) start to exceed that entering the anteroom across Door 1 doorway (Qc(\u00fe)). > 16 s, Fig. 11 ). After Door 1 is closed, the negative pressure design produces the negative constant flow rates (\u00c00.2112 m 3 /s) through Transfer grilles 1 and 2. Consequently, the two-way air exchange disappears. Contaminants are quickly removed from the anteroom across two transfer grilles (Fig. 11b) . Considerable Qc across Transfer grille 2 entering Room 2 can explain why the concentration in Room 2 increases until t \u00bc 62 s (Fig. 7g) .",

With a scale physical model, Fontana and Quintino [46] experimentally confirmed that door operation can produce a dirty air transfer in the clean room, and that transfer entity appears strongly related to air volume displaced in the door opening operation but almost independent from differential pressure and flow rate imbalance. However, our simulation results show that the amount of airborne agents transferred into the clean anteroom depend on not only the transient two-way airflow induced by door motion but also the unsteady concentration gradient across the doorway. Thus the transport of airborne agents across the doorway into the clean anteroom and to the neighbor cubicle is a much more complicated and transient process than the scaled model in the literature [46] . Further investigations with various speed of door sweeping motion (for example 3 s, 2 s, 1 s) are still required to check how the speed of door motion influences inter-cubicle transmission in such realistic hospital wards.",

Throughout the door opening and closing motion, the door sweeping effect in combination with the ventilation system dominates two-way airflow and contaminant exchange. When the dirty cubicle door remains fully open for a while, the average air velocity through the doorway is small and the temperature difference across this doorway is the main cause of two-way contaminant exchange and inter-cubicle transmission.",

Keeping the door completely open possibly contributes to the major fraction of inter-cubicle transmission when the duration time (30 s, 60 s) is much longer than the door sweeping processes (only 3 s). Air change rate is another important parameter. If the air change rate for each cubicle decreases from 34 ACH to 8.5 ACH, more infectious agents enter the anteroom and the clean cubicle, meanwhile it requires more time to reach their peak concentration and to remove the leaked airborne pathogens once the dirty cubicle door is closed.",

Considering that the negative pressure in isolation cubicles is sufficient to prevent inter-cubicle airborne transmission if wind speed across the doorway is sufficiently high [6] , it is recommended that curtains can be installed at doorway locations to reduce the risk of airborne pathogen leakage [45] . Other techniques are also plausible, such as using air cleaners [47] , using facemasks [48] , etc. Although further investigations are still required with respect to particles and droplets simulations, this paper offers meaningful findings for the inter-cubicle transmission of gaseous agents when a shared anteroom is used.",
