Endocytosis is involved in sampling of the extracellular milieu and also serves to regulate various processes initiated at the cell surface. These include nutrient uptake, signaling from cellsurface receptors, and many other processes essential for cell and tissue functioning in metazoans. It is also central to the maintenance of PM lipid and protein homeostasis. There are multiple means of internalization that operate concurrently, at the cell surface. With advancement in high-resolution visualization techniques, it is now possible to track multiple endocytic cargo at the same time, revealing a remarkable diversity of endocytic processes in a single cell. A combination of live cell imaging and efficient genetic manipulations has also aided in understanding the functional hierarchy of molecular players in these mechanisms of internalization. Here we provide an account of various endocytic routes, their mechanisms of operation and occurrence across phyla.",

In this review, with the intention of summarizing present understanding of principles of endocytosis, we have surveyed different types of endocytic processes, focusing on their molecular attributes and mechanism of vesicle formation at the cell surface.",

Ingestion of particles larger than 500 nm size typically occurs via triggered processes called 'phagocytosis or macropinocytosis' (Figure 1 ) whereas cargo below this size limit is often internalized by any of the other diverse endocytic processes available at the cell surface ( Figure 2 ).

These processes are tightly regulated, distinct internalization events often resulting in phase-lucent structures inside cells when viewed in a light microscope [1] . They involve longrange remodeling of membrane and the cytoskeleton lying beneath it, and have been focus of some recent re-a cup-shaped membrane distortion around the particle, culminating in a phagosome. Two well-described types of phagocytic entry are: (i) Ig receptor, FcR-mediated engulfment of immunoglobulin G-opsonized particles and (ii) complement receptor CR3-mediated ingestion of C3bi-coated particles. Both the means of phagocytic entry form morphologically distinct phagocytic cups and represent different types of phagocytic mechanisms ( Figure 1A ). Thus the morphology of forming invagination and resultant compartment is a crucial parameter for classifying these processes.",

This leads to localized actin rearrangement, membrane extension around ligand, and thereby further engagement of receptors with ligand in a protruding cup with zipper-lock arrangement. In CR3-type phagocytosis (termed 'trigger-like'), on the other hand, the process is triggered by treatment with either phorbol esters or extracellular agonists [10, 11] and the particle is loosely encased in a large membrane vesicle. The site of phagocytosis has discrete patch-like distribution of F-actin, and occurs by a regulated and triggered depression in the cell surface. There are instances, for example, engulfment of necrotic cells, where the morphology is in between the two [1] . In either case formation of phagosomes is achieved by spatiotemporally controlled sequential action of various small actin-remodeling GT-Pases [12] . The two modes also differ in their requirements for Rho-GTPases, in that FcR-mediated phagocytosis relies on Rac1 and Cdc42 activities, whereas CR3mediated entry is specifically dependent on RhoA [12, 13] .",

Here too, two general models have been described that outline bacterial entry into cells: the 'trigger' or 'zipper' models. Salmonella and Shigella are examples of 'triggering' bacteria; Salmonella injects its effector, SopB, into cells, which activates an exchange factor for RhoG, leading to actin remodeling that causes internalization of the bacterium [14] . The 'zippering' model of entry of the bacteria is similar to FcR-mediated internalization, as it involves engagement of cell-surface receptors all around the particle being internalized. A good example of this 'zippering' kind of bacterium is Listeria Monocytogenes, where the bacterium interacts with host epithelial cells through its adhesins, InlA and InlB, that bind host cell receptors E-cadherin and Met, respectively [15] .",

This correlated with activation of Cdc42 and Rac1 [17] . Activity of the Rho GTPases is presumably required for regulation of actin polymerization during phagocytic cup formation; simultaneous inhibition of both Cdc42 and Rac1 abolishes this. Inhibition of these GTPases individually however only partially inhibits phagocytosis, suggesting they act in tandem during the process. These Rho GTPases upon activation, recruit WASP and thereby the Arp2/3 complex for actin nucleation and polymerization [18] . The action of GTPases is probably regulated by the composition of polyphosphoinositides (PIPs) of the phagosomal membrane. PIPs are also intimately linked to actin dynamics [19] . During early stages of cup formation, PI4,5P2 is enriched at the inner leaflet of the cup; during phagosome closure, rapid disappearance of F-actin at the base of the cup is correlated with the reduction in local concentration of PI4,5P2. Consistent with this, overexpression of the PI-kinase (PIPKI), which converts PI4P into PI4,5P2 or inhibition of PLC and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K, enzymes that produce IP3, DAG, and PI3,4,5P3, respectively) abrogates phagosome closure [2, 20] .",

First described by Lewis [6, 24] as large phase-bright organelles originating from plasma membrane (PM) ruffles, macropinosomes were initially thought to occur via non-selective membrane uptake. This view has changed with increased understanding of this process. Owing to its specific characteristics such as its inhibition with Na + /H + exchanger inhibitor, amiloride [25] , and dependence on growth factor (GF) receptor (GFR) signaling, macropinocytosis is now defined as a highly coordinated, triggered process with distinct molecular regulators. In a study performed using soil ameba, Dictyostelium discoideum, an active phagocytic and macropinocytic organism, it was shown that during macropinosome formation, some membrane proteins were selectively depleted from the site at the PM [26] . It is now clear that there is sorting of membrane components during the formation of macropinosomes.",

EGF binding results in activation of Rac1 GTPase as well as generation of the phosphoinositide, PI4,5P2, both of which together activate WASP/SCAR proteins. These in turn bind to the Arp2/3 complex, hence modulating actin po-lymerization.

In these embryonic stem cells, fluidphase tracer uptake, as an indicator of stimulated macropinocytosis, was rescued by reintroduction of dynamin-1 or 2 [38] , suggesting that dynamin is crucial for this form of macropinocytosis. However, at this stage it is not clear whether dynamin could serve as a scissoring protein for specific cases of macropinocytosis, or has other regulatory functions for endocytosis.

            "text": "Clathrin-coated vesicle (CCV ) formation and its regulation have been reported to be associated with ~150 proteins, however, at this stage, with the exception of a few, their precise sequence of action during CCV formation remains unexplored. In a study carried out in live [48] uncovered the chronology of a few effector protein dynamics during the formation of a mature coat. More of such investigations will shed light on dynamics of critical molecular events that occur during CCV formation. Imaging of clathrin-coat nucleation at PM suggests that it assembles randomly, mediated by cargo protein, AP, and accessory proteins [46] . In neurons, APs direct lattice formation to specific sites at PM via interaction with PI4,5P2 and synaptotagmin I and clathrin. This assembly can be further stabilized by epsin and AP180/ CALM, which bind to AP2, PIP2, and clathrin [49] . Subsequent to this, stabilization of the clathrin-coated pit (CCP) requires cargo acquisition via subunits of AP2 and clathrin [46, 50] . This step proceeds via the recruitment of various AP2-binding partners that facilitate cargo binding, optimal clathrin polymerization, and membrane bending. The process of membrane bending is brought about in part by BAR (Bin Amphiphysin Rvs) domaincontaining proteins [9] , such as endophilin and amphiphysin, and is further facilitated by epsin and inherent curvature properties of assembled clathrin structures [51, 52] . Mature clathrin-coated vesicle, while still attached to the PM, contains amphiphysin and recruits the pinching module that contains the protein dynamin. Dynamin eventually promotes the scission of the vesicle (see later section for details).",

For some viruses this route is obligatory, and for others the clathrin pathway is one of a few that support infection. Studies on the entry of influenza virus in epithelial cells have indicated that a large fraction is endocytosed into CCPs; viral particles are also endocytosed by non-clathrin pathway operating in parallel [60] . Viruses that take a clathrin-dependent route more often induce formation of clathrin pit at the site of binding at the PM rather than entering a preassembled clathrin structure [59] . This suggests a flexibility in regulation of clathrin-coated vesicle formation. Similarly, in case of bacterial uptake, the entry of the bacterium, L. monocytogenes, into HeLa cells was sensitive to depletion of clathrin heavy chain and other endocytic proteins such as dynamin, Eps15, but not the adaptor AP2. This was unexpected because it suggests that cargo 20 times larger than a normal endocytic cargo could use the clathrinbased machinery to enter a non-phagocytic mammalian cell, reiterating the flexibility in clathrin-mediated endocytic processes, both in terms of size and associated machinery [61] .",

Caveolae were originally described as flask-shaped structures in ultrastructure of blood capillaries by Palade in 1953 [62] , but it was not until much later that the coat component, caveolin, was identified [63] . Caveolae are formed by assembly of caveolins, integral membrane proteins that bind directly to membrane cholesterol. There are three subtypes of caveolin proteins, caveolin-1, caveolin-2, and caveolin-3, the former two being responsible for caveolae formation in non-muscle cells and latter in muscle cells [64] . A recent study demonstrated that while morphological features of caveolae are widely conserved, the functions of individual caveolin proteins may be diverse [65] . Many mammalian cell lines such as human colorectal adenocarcinoma cells, Caco2 [66] , or tissues (e.g. many blood cell lineages) do not have detectable levels of caveolin, pointing toward the specialized tissuespecific function of caveolins. Overexpression of caveolins in the cells lacking them induces de novo formation of caveolae [67, 68] .",

In many of these cases the receptors for specific cargoes have also been identified but the mechanism by which cargo is concentrated in caveolae is not understood. In addition, endocytosis via caveolae also remains poorly characterized. It is not clear if caveolar endocytosis is constitutive, albeit occurring at a low rate, and is massively up-regulated on specific induction. Fluorescence recovery after photobleaching studies has indicated caveolae to be relatively stable structures on PM [78] , which can however be made to bud off by the interaction of pathogens such as SV40 virus [79] or can also be induced by incorporation of fluorescent analogues of sphingolipids, namely, lactosyl ceramide [80] [81] [82] . During integrin-dependent cell adhesion, deadherence induces removal of caveolin-coated membrane from the cell surface, and it has been shown that caveolin is required for this process [83] . This results in altered PM lipid composition, due to the loss of many lipids and proteins that partition into detergent-resistant membrane (DRM) domains. This has significant functional consequences foremost of which is loss of Rac1 activity at the cell surface, and consequently remodeling of the cortical cytoskeleton, and activation of anoikisis, a form of apoptosis induced by the loss of cell anchorage [83, 84] . Caveolin knockout mice have proven to be useful genetic tools for studying the function of caveolin and ascertaining caveolar cargo specificity [85] . In mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) obtained from caveolin-1 knockout mice, albumin uptake was found to be defective [86] , but the entry of SV40 [87] and cholera toxin B subunit (CTxB) [88] , two typical cargoes of caveolae, was not compromised. This could be explained by the possibility that caveolin, when present, induces formation of caveolae, but is dispensable for internalization of some caveolar cargoes. In addition, there is evidence that caveolins can negatively regulate entry of certain cellsurface proteins, including CTxB [89, 90] , where overexpression of caveolins prevents their internalization, suggesting that apart from their direct role in endocytosis, caveolins can indirectly influence other endocytic pathways. A novel role for caveolin-1 has been reported, in regulation of Cdc42 activity during membrane trafficking events. Caveolin-1 binds preferentially to Cdc42 in its GDP-bound form and functions as a guanine nucleotide dissociation inhibitor (GDI) for Cdc42. Thus, by maintaining Cdc42 in an inactive state, caveolin-1 regulates basal secretion in the absence of stimuli in pancreatic \u03b2-cells [91] . It is possible that caveolin-1 has similar indirect regulatory roles at PM via inhibitory interactions with mediators of other endocytic pathways. Endocytosis of SV40 virus has been reported to increase in cells lacking caveolin-1 [87] , indicating an inhibitory role for caveolin-1 in this process. However in this study it was not clear whether this effect is due to squelching of effector molecules or due to sequestration of a specific kind of membrane components. Studies exploring redundant endocytic roles of caveolin will be invaluable in understanding the regulatory cross-talk between caveolar and non-caveolar internalization pathways.",

Insights into dynamin function came primarily from morphological analysis of synapses in the shibire ts1 mutant. Cycling of mutants through restrictive and permissive temperatures, Koenig and Ikeda observed a reversible loss of synaptic vesicles at neuromuscular synaptic junctions, implicating dynamin in synaptic vesicle endocytosis [16] . Overexpression of dominant negative, GTP-binding mutants of dynamin also blocked receptor-mediated endocytosis in various cells, suggesting a role for the GTPase activity of dynamin in the clathrin-dependent endocytic process outside the nervous system. Dynamin was found to localize to CCPs at the PM and in isolated synaptosomal preparation [98, 99] , providing further evidence of a direct role for dynamin in endocytosis.",

Dynamin oligomerization and dynamics lead to constriction and eventually budding of the vesicle. The exact function of dynamin at the level of vesicle fission has been a subject of controversy. There are various hypotheses regarding the GTP-dependent mechanism of dynamin action for vesicle pinching. First is the conformational change in dynamin brought about by GTP loading (switch model), which can cause scission by recruiting other molecules that will fuse membranes and acts essentially as a timer for this reaction, whereas the other relies on the actual mechanical force generated at the vesicle neck (pinchase model). While there is evidence for both the GTP switch and mechanoenzyme functions of dynamin [102] , recent studies support a mechanoenzyme or motor-like function of dynamin. The in vitro demonstration of dynamin-coated lipid tubules twisting in response to supply of GTP was a direct evidence supporting a mechano-enzyme behavior where the authors argue that in addition to membrane tension, torsional strain generated at the neck of the vesicle can lead to pinching [103] . Two other studies demonstrated that it is the kinetics of dynamin depolymerization and polymerization on 'tension-free' membranes that brings about changes in membrane curvature, necessary for fission [104, 105] . At this point both these possibilities have distinct implications on the dynamics of dynamin action during pinching as discussed [106] .",

Other clathrin-independent pathways that utilize dynamin are the RhoA-dependent IL-2 receptor endocytic route [109] and APP endocytosis in primary neurons [110] . Although ultrastructural studies indicate that IL-2 receptors are not recruited to CCPs, they were internalized by small uniform-sized invaginations. The uniform and small size (50-100 nm) of the forming endocytic pit at the surface that appears to concentrate the cargo suggests the presence of a protein coat that could aid in the recruitment of these proteins to the site of endocytosis. A lot more information is necessary to uncover the mechanism of operation of this type of endocytosis.",

Here, cells on stimulation with EGF generate circular wave-like ruffles that on concentric closure internalize ~50% of cell-surface EGFR. This process employs dynamin 2 but is independent of clathrin or caveolins [111] . Overall, the function of dynamin seems neither to be strictly dependent on the presence of clathrin on buds, nor is limited by the size of invaginations. As indicated above, the mechanism by which dynamin is recruited to these endocytic sites at PM is unclear, and ought to be the subject of further investigations. However, a general theme that emerges is that most coat-dependent mechanisms of endocytosis use dynamin to assist in scission of the membrane deformation from the cell surface. On the other hand there are a number of coatindependent endocytic processes that appear to function in the absence of dynamin (Table 1) .",

In fact, the existence of a coat-independent route for endocytic uptake has taken a long time to be well accepted; careful experimentation coupled with genetic manipulations provided the necessary evidence. For example, the acceptance of clathrin-independent endocytosis was built on a number of studies: (i) injection of African green monkey kidney cells (CV1) with anti-clathrin antibodies abolished receptor-mediated uptake completely, but inhibited the uptake of a bulk phase marker (lucifer yellow) by only 40% [112] , and (ii) clathrin-dependent endocytosis could also be inhibited by hypotonic shock, cytosolic potassium depletion, or acidification of cytosol while under all these conditions, endocytosis of the plant toxin ricin continued to take place [113, 114] . Together, these and other experiments paved the way to the idea that cells could exhibit one or more clathrin-independent endocytic routes.",

It is also possible, however, that lipid or protein accretions could initiate membrane deformation (vesicle formation) without defined coat proteins. While the pathways that require coats also have their specific lipid requirements [115, 116] , in some instances, lipid organization alone has proven to be sufficient for membrane invagination. Shiga toxin entry is one such example where binding of toxin to the ganglioside, Gb3, www.cell-research.com | Cell Research Sudha Kumari et al. 265 npg induces invaginations in cells as well as model membranes [117] . This was specific to toxin binding, since simply cross-linking Gb3 with antibodies failed to result in invaginations. These studies provide evidence for the requirement of a specific lipid-binding architecture for this process. A lipid-compaction model was proposed for the segregation and membrane budding induced by the toxin. This process was inhibited by increasing membrane tension, indicating that membrane properties, tension, and bending rigidity might play a crucial role in the regulation of lipid-based invaginations. Endocytosis of the lipid-anchored proteins such as glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored proteins (GPI-APs) also does not appear to require any of the well-characterized coat proteins [64, 88, 118, 119] . This pathway could be another example where the foundation for membrane deformation is laid by membrane lipids (see the CLIC/GEEC pathway below). An example where a protein platform suffices to support endocytosis is the process of human papillomavirus 16 (HPV16) virus infection, where tetraspanin-enriched domains are required for virus entry [120] . It was widely accepted that dynamin would be indispensable for all endocytic activities in the cell. In part this notion had been fuelled by the existence of a number of dynamin genes, and isoforms/splice variants [95, 121, 122] . However, this notion was difficult to reconcile with a few key observations: (i) overexpression of dominantnegative mutant form of dynamin-2 in HeLa cells [98] inhibited clathrin-dependent endocytosis but could not completely block fluid phase uptake, and (ii) hemocytes derived from the temperature-sensitive shibire mutants of Drosophila exhibited a complete block in clathrindependent endocytosis of scavenger receptors, whereas fluid-phase and GPI-AP uptake remained unaffected [123] . The dynamin gene mutation in Drosophila renders all dynamin splice forms mutant since the mutation lies in the common exon encoding the GTPase domain [124] .",

Interpretation of such experiments is however, complex. It is difficult to ascertain whether lack of defect is due to lack of involvement of dynamin, or due to an alternative internalization pathway that is induced by inhibition of dynamin. Alternatively, the ability of dynamin mutants to interfere with the activity of Rac [39] suggests that inhibition of a particular pathway may not reflect a direct role for dynamin. From the existing examples under the canopy of dynamin-independent pathways, there are also specific requirements for small GTPases such as the ARF family proteins, and the Rho family proteins (Table 1) . These GTPases could function as timers for regulation of the assembly and disassembly of actin-based endocytic mechanism or as scaffold to recruit other regulatory proteins. However, it is evident that while these GTPases can be utilized in combination, they have a diversity of functions not solely restricted to endocytosis [109, 125] .",

In a mutant screen for endocytic defects in yeast, a large number of identified genes were related to actin and its regulators [127] ; subsequently, the recruitment of actin to the sites of endocytosis was elegantly demonstrated in live cells [128] . One of the first identified genes involved in \u03b1-factor uptake was act1 (end7), the yeast actin gene. Nearly a third of endocytic proteins identified in yeast bind actin or regulate its assembly. A specific kind of actin structure, called 'cortical actin patches' has been observed to be associated with endocytic sites. Using real-time fluorescence microscopy and particle tracking, Drubin and colleagues [129] demonstrated that there are different cortical actin patcheswith distinct protein composition and motility properties; and these were intermediates in the endocytic process. Subsequently, using a live imaging screen of deletion mutants, where they dissected defects in coat dynamics and actin assembly, they provided evidence for the existence of distinct protein modules for coat formation, membrane invagination, actin-meshwork assembly, and vesicle scission during clathrin-or actin-mediated endocytosis [130] . In the same study, they also demonstrated that, in yeast, while clathrin facilitates endocytic site assembly, it is not required for membrane invagination or vesicle formation. Based on these studies, a fission mechanism for such a pathway has been recently proposed [131] . This model suggests that endocytosis can be initiated at a site where the membrane invaginates, and then elongates into a tube through the encasement by ac- tive polymerization of actin, culminating in the scission of a membrane bud of different membrane and protein compositions via traction by myosin motors [132] . Considering that clathrin and its effectors also associate with these vesicles, it is not yet established if actin alone acts as the coat [133] .",

Disruption of the actin cytoskeleton also causes a reduction in endocytosis in a number of clathrin-independent pathways [64, 135] . Large vesicles formed as a result of compensatory endocytosis in Xenopus oocytes also have been shown to have actin coats around them, although the precise function of actin there has not been addressed [136] . It should be, however, noted that actin is a multifunctional structural protein and perturbation in actin and actin nanomachinery can also result in non-specific and indirect defects in endocytosis; nevertheless colocalization of F-actin with endosomes indicates a more direct role in endocytosis. In the following sections we discuss some of the pathways that utilize actin and its regulators, in further detail.",

GPI-APs are outer leaflet membrane proteins that lack cytosolic extensions and thus are unable to directly bind cytosolic adaptors. These proteins belong to a family of proteins with diverse functions and have been shown to be internalized by a dynamin-independent endocytic route, into a specialized early endosomal compartment, where a majority of the internalized fluid phase is also detected in many cell types [119] . Endocytic structures containing nascent endocytosed GPI-APs are named GPI-AP enriched early endosomal compartments (GEECs). GEECs are proposed to result from fusion of uncoated tubulovesicular CLICs (clathrin-independent carriers) directly derived from the cell surface [88] .",

            "text": "CLICs/GEECs are selectively enriched for GPI-APs [119] although at this stage the sorting determinants at PM are not clear. It could potentially be lipid-based sorting, as alterations in cholesterol and sphingolipid levels as well as perturbation of the nanocluster state of the GPI-AP affect endocytosis through this pathway [64, 119, 137] . However, a recent study shows the size of extracellular moiety attached to the lipid tail as an additional determinant for inclusion into GEECs [138] . It will be interesting to investigate the size range of proteins that allows them to be endocytosed via GEECs and also, how the size-based regulation crosstalks to lipidmediated sorting into the GEEC pathway. Another feature of endocytosis via CLICs/GEECs is its dependence on the actin polymerization machinery [64] ; maintenance of dynamic cortical actin architecture appears to be required for GEEC endocytosis. This is brought about by the cycling of the Rho family GTPase Cdc42 and downstream activation of the WASP protein, since locking of Cdc42 in GDP or the GTP state leads to inhibition of the GEEC pathway [135] . Cdc42 dynamics on PM is regulated by ARF1; activation of ARF1 leads to recruitment of a Rho-GAP domain-containing protein, ARHGAP10, and inactivates Cdc42, thus maintaining its cycling [135] . Another recently reported effector of GEEC formation is a BAR domain-containing protein, GTPase regulator associated with focal adhesion kinase-1 (GRAF1). Endogenous GRAF1 localizes to CLIC/GEEC carriers in HeLa cells and silencing its expression results in reduced GEEC marker uptake [139] . GRAF1 colocalizes with active Cdc42 and contains a Rho-GAP domain, so it may be involved in regulating Cdc42 dynamics apart from its other functions. GRAF1 also contains a BAR domain, which could aid in membrane curvature and an SH3 domain, capable of interacting with dynamin GTPase. It is interesting to note that while GEEC formation is dynamin-independent, dynamin appears to be recruited to GEECs post internalization [88] ; this could potentially be mediated by GEEC-associated proteins such as GRAF1, which has been shown to interact with dynamin.",

Since a variety of GPI-APs are internalized by the GEEC pathway, and in some cases endocytosis via GEECs specifically aids in accomplishing their cellular function [140] , this pathway could be of vital importance for this whole family of proteins. Considering its constitutive nature, fast kinetics and heterogeneous resultant vesicle size, the GEEC pathway could mediate the regulation of PM homeostasis. There are an increasing number of proteins internalized by pathways that bear a resemblance to the GEECs. Endocytosis of cholera toxin [88] , internalization of VacA toxin, and sorting nexin 9 (SNX9)-regulated GPI-AP internalization routes are examples similar to GEECs [141, 142] . Another cargo for a GEEC-like pathway is dysferlin, a muscle repair protein, mutations in which are associated with several myopathies. In MEFs devoid of caveolin-1, dysferlin is endocytosed into compartments containing GPI-APs and its cellular entry is independent of dynamin activity, indicating that internalization could potentially be carried out via the GEEC pathway [89] .",

These are distinct from the clathrin-dependent cargo-containing endosomes [143] . Overexpression of constitutively active form of ARF6 was shown to increase endocytosis of Tac; however, inhibition of ARF6 via overexpression of a GTP-exchange defective form does not perturb endocytosis [143] . There have been several additions to the cargoes and effectors of this pathway, recently reviewed [144] . Endosomes-containing cargo internalized via this pathway, remain associated with activated ARF6 [145] ; hyperactivation of ARF6 traps a PIP2-enriched early endosomes of a vacuolated morphology, while its constitutive inactivation blocks the process of recycling back to PM from tubular compartments. Recently, candidates for cargoes endocytosed via the ARF6-pathway were identified using hyperactivated ARF6-trapped endosomes [146] . While ARF6 associates with endosomes containing a specific set of cargoes, it is not clear whether it is involved directly at the internalization level or the recycling step or both. The localization of ARF6 on endosomes can result both from stable association during endocytosis and acquisition on endosomal membrane post-internalization. While ARF6 regulates dynamindependent endocytosis of the herpes simplex protein vp22 [147] , it has also been demonstrated to control the recycling of membrane [148] . It will of interest to visualize the localization of ARF6 in the context of cargo endocytosis at PMA.",

However, the relationship of this pathway to the GEEC/CLIC pathway in other cell types is not yet established; a role for cholesterol and specific RhoGTPases remains as yet unaddressed.",

Flotillin-1 and 2 are both required for induction of membrane invaginations in a dose-dependent manner [153] . Similar to the caveolins, flotillins are associated with DRMs [23] . While flotillins were shown to form heteromeric complexes with caveolins, as demonstrated by co-immunoprecipitation experiments, it is yet unknown if this interaction is functional in the context of caveolae formation [154] . In MEFs lacking caveolin-1, while majority of flask-shaped invaginations are absent, there are some structures that remain. This suggests a role for other molecules in the formation of caveolae (flask)-shaped invaginations [155] . By EM and immunogold labeling, flotillin appears to decorate small membrane invaginations distinct from clathrin-or caveolin-1-labeled pits. However, in a recent study in fibroblasts lacking caveolin-1, overexpression of flotillin isoforms, flotillin-1 and 2 could not induce flask-shaped invaginations, suggesting that factors more than flotillins may be necessary for the generation of the flotillin-decorated invaginations [156] .",

Dynamin-independent endocytosis of HPV16 is localized to tetraspanin domains (CD63, CD151) of the PM and CD151 knockdown in cells blocked HPV16 entry [120] . This mode of endocytosis is distinct from other dynaminindependent routes in that, it is not inhibited by perturbation of cholesterol levels in the cell [120] , nor does it rely on cellular levels of clathrin, caveolin, and flotillin. However, exact steps in this endocytic mechanism, as well as the associated molecular players, are still unclear. Recently, it was demonstrated that endocytosis of a tetraspanin, CD82, is dynamin-independent and occurs via a Cdc42-dependent GEEC-like pinocytic pathway [159] . It raises an interesting possibility that while tetraspanins regulate a distinct cholesterol-independent internalization route, they may utilize a different endocytic pathway for their own cellular entry [159] .",

The function of these genes was further validated in mammalian cells, where mutation in some of these genes replicated transport defects as were observed in C. elegans. These studies also indicated that components of the molecular machinery underlying membrane trafficking may be conserved across systems. In a study that carried out extensive phylogenetic analysis of caveolin genes in metazoan (which provided evidence of extensive gene duplication), it was observed that vertebrate caveolin-1 and caveolin-3 isoforms and an invertebrate caveolin (Apis mellifera) were able to form morphologically identical caveolae in caveolin-1 null mouse cells, while the C. elegans caveolin could not. This indicates diversity of function in the caveolin gene family [156] .",

While some internalization routes seem to be conserved in primary and immortalized cell lines, it is not certain whether their kinetics is conserved and if immortalization has consequences on overall endocytic activity of a cell type. Genetic knockout of known endocytic proteins in mice allows for the derivation of primary fibroblasts that are now routinely used to dissect the process [86] . These fibroblasts serve as excellent tools to study the involvement of candidate proteins in endocytosis -this approach not only avoids complexities associated with overexpression of their dominant-negative isoforms and off-target effects, but also can reflect on the functional redundancy of a given protein in the system. In plants, taking into account the cell wall as a physical barrier to PM accessibility, and the high intracellular vacuolar pressure that builds up turgor pressure, the very existence of endocytosis was debated for a long time. In a study using electron microscopy, PM-associated invaginations containing electron-dense tracer and clathrin coats were visualized [176] . More recently, uptake of FM dyes was demonstrated in plant cells [177] , following which many studies reported endocytosis of membrane markers and specific proteins in plant root hair cells, pollen tube, and cultured tobacco cells [178] . Now there is accumulating evidence about the diversity of endosomal pathways and endocytic compartments in plants. Although most of the studies used FM dyes to monitor internalization in plants, advancements in probing techniques are revealing a diversity of endocytic routes in this kingdom. Apart from clathrin-dependent receptor-mediated endocytosis, actin-sensitive fluidphase endocytosis in inner cortex cells of maize root [179] and PI3K-dependent bulk phase sucrose endocytosis in suspension culture cells of sycamore have been reported [180] . Blockade of clathrin-mediated endocytosis using ikarugamycin (Ika) did not inhibit uptake of positively charged nanogold particles, suggesting the operation of a clathrin-independent pathway [181] . However, in another study, Dhonukshe et al., showed that total membrane uptake in BY-2 tobacco cells could be inhibited by inhibiting clathrin using clathrin hub dominant negative form, suggesting that clathrin is absolutely required for any form of endocytosis [182] . It is possible that a diversity of endocytic portals are conserved in plant and animal systems, and several modes of endocytosis operate in plant cells in a cell type-and tissue-specific manner.",

These proteins therefore need to utilize radically different principles for sorting, membrane deformation, and vesicle generation at PM. Similarly, much less is known about endocytosis of membrane lipids. Dissection of the endocytic process of lipids will give insights into a novel way of vesicle formation. Also considering the multiplicity of functions of proteins, it will be interesting to investigate the overlapping functions of molecules known to be associated with specific trafficking pathways.",

Until we understand the basic principles behind cargo concentration, membrane deformation, and scission in each of these modes it will be difficult to provide any rationale for the proliferation of the mechanisms of entry. Regardless, the endocytic process, in addition to its role in uptake of nutrients and fluid, influences diverse key processes in metazoans, such as establishment of cellular asymmetry and modulation of signaling. In addition to its physiological roles, the endocytic process is also exploited by various pathogens. Insights into the underlying mechanisms will reveal new targets for drug design, and selective employment of these entry routes for drug delivery will also allow for the manipulation of cellular endocytic pathways to alleviate effects of specific diseases.",

Most examplesin (B)are less-explored in terms of their molecular mechanisms, and their specificity for particular cargo is less well defined. For example, CD59 is endocytosed by both the ARF6-associated pathway and the flotillin-mediated endocytic route. The routes illustrated here represent pathways that have been shown to be distinct from one another.",
