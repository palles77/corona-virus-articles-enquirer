The food-grade host L. casei Q-5 was a lactose-deficient derivative of L. casei ATCC 334 obtained by plasmid elimination. The food-grade cell surface display vector was constructed based on safe DNA elements from lactic acid bacteria containing the following: pSH71 replicon from Lactococcus lactis, lactose metabolism genes from L. casei ATCC 334 as complementation markers, and surface layer protein gene from Lactobacillus acidophilus ATCC 4356 for cell surface display. The feasibility of the new host/vector system was verified by the expression of green fluorescent protein (GFP) on L. casei. Laser scanning confocal microscopy and immunofluorescence analysis using anti-GFP antibody confirmed that GFP was anchored on the surface of the recombinant cells. The stability of recombinant L. casei cells in artificial gastrointestinal conditions was verified, which is beneficial for oral vaccination applications. These results indicate that the food-grade host/vector system can be an excellent antigen delivery vehicle in oral vaccine construction.",

Vaccination is effective against many bacteria, viruses, parasites and other infectious diseases in humans. Genetically engineered live vaccine (GELV) is an effective method for vaccine delivery. Non-pathogenic microorganisms are usually used as carriers. The recombinant protective antigen gene fragments of germs are restructured in the vector microbes, and the microbes expressing protective antigens are used as vaccines. Vaccinia virus, adenovirus, and poliovirus are commonly used viral vectors. Salmonella and Bacillus Calmette-Gu\u00e9rin (BCG) are commonly used bacterial vectors (Detmer and Glenting 2006) . The potential for reversion of attenuated strains to virulence is a significant safety concern. Using non-pathogenic bacteria, especially probiotics, as vaccine carriers enhances the safety of vaccines.",
