We set out to document disease transmission chains for Ebola, with the goal of generating a timely account that could be used for surveillance, mathematical modeling, and public health decisionmaking. By accessing public web pages only, such as locally produced newspapers and blogs, we created a transmission chain involving two Ebola clusters in West Africa that compared favorably with other published transmission chains, and derived parameters for a mathematical model of Ebola disease transmission that were not statistically different from those derived from published sources. We present a protocol for responsibly gleaning epidemiological facts, transmission model parameters, and useful details from affected communities using mostly indigenously produced sources. After comparing our transmission parameters to published parameters, we discuss additional benefits of our method, such as gaining practical information about the affected community, its infrastructure, politics, and culture. We also briefly compare our method to similar efforts that used mostly non-indigenous online sources to generate epidemiological information. Article Summary Line: We constructed an infectious disease transmission chain using only publicly available internet sources, which can offer a timely snapshot of what is happening in the community and has the potential to yield detailed transmission trees and estimates for epidemiological parameters.",

Mathematical modelers of infectious disease need parameters derived by reported transmission events, including who infected whom and when, to generate appropriate model transmission parameters. In addition, they need to know the nature of and context surrounding contacts, both of which come into play when trying to forecast disease. Data meeting these requirements for the Ebola virus disease epidemic were not available. In spite of best efforts at forecasting through a very engaged modeling community, the paucity of case transmission data was cited as one of the reasons for disease forecasts that greatly overestimated the number of likely cases [1] . The total outbreak size is now estimated at <29 000 documented cases [2] , and yet early model projections forecasted more than 1 million cases.",

Some of these online transmission accounts included remarkable detail of transmission events, including dates of contact, contact names, and the dates of symptom onset. The distribution of individual incubation periods (the period between infection and clinical presentation of symptoms) is important for assessing the duration of quarantine strategies [3] . The distribution of serial intervals or generation times between subsequent cases in transmission chains is required to extract estimates of the population reproductive number from time series of case counts [4] and is useful for assessing the effectiveness of patient isolation in preventing transmission during various stages of disease progression [5] . Finally, the variability in the number of transmissions from individual cases is useful for characterizing new outbreak probabilities and the circumstances of potential superspreading events [6] .",

Our preferred (sought out) online sources were those that had records of reporting as news organizations for the populations in the affected areas. Online, hyperlinked lists of newspapers by country provided one means for identifying these news sources. Through the advanced search features in popular internet search engines (including Google Search), we were able to conduct internet searches with query returns as they appeared in Guinea, Liberia, Nigeria, and Sierra Leone. (Most news sources identify their geographic distribution and scope by regions, communities, or countries, though we also checked the masthead (or its digital equivalent) to verify where the sources were based.) We adopted the heuristic that first-hand, primary accounts of people, places, and transmission events were reliable starting points for building the transmission narrative. In particular, we identified text within these stories that detailed who acquired infection from whom, dates, locations, and details of symptom onset, quarantine, isolation, resolution, and exposure, if known. We grouped sources by the events they relayed, comparing accounts and attempting to corroborate details between stories and checking that they made sense from an epidemiological standpoint. We continued building the chain until we could no longer find earlier cases and the most recently exposed people were at that time still in their incubation periods.",

Documenting details that were discovered during our search on a desktop calendar proved to be helpful, as it was common to report events according to days of the week, such as last Thursday or the prior weekend. We also had to be cognizant of times and dates, as, for example, 'now' in Utah, USA is different than 'now' in Lagos, Nigeria. Discrepancies between and across sources were resolved using our best judgement, based on subject matter expertise in infectious diseases, including Ebola, while others that could not be precisely reconciled were recorded and reported as uncertainties.",

The gamma distribution was chosen for consistency in comparing our results to those derived from World Health Organization (WHO) data [5] . For the incubation period, we established a date or range of dates of exposure and symptom onset for N = 23 individuals. We first treated this information as doubly interval-censored data [7] , meaning that both the time of exposure and time of symptom onset were not precisely known but fell within finite intervals. Even when a precise date for an event was reported, we assumed an interval for the precise timing of the event across the 24-h period of that date. We then reduced the data to single intervals for each individual i = 1,. . .,N, representing possible incubation periods, where the minimum possible incubation period T i min was the minimum symptom onset time minus the maximum time of exposure, and the maximum possible incubation period T i max was the maximum symptom onset time minus the minimum exposure time. We then optimized the gamma distribution parameters by maximizing the likelihood function",

The social networking site Facebook was not a primary source, but was helpful for verifying dates, especially when connected friends and family wrote about loved ones who were sick or deceased. Each news source had the potential to confirm or refute facts, or to open additional paths for investigation through new clues, often by offering a different spelling for names, places, and events.

Three major sections of the chain included Ebola transmission involving an herbalist who seeded one of the major Sierra Leone chains, a chain arising in Redemption Hospital in New Kru Town, Monrovia, Liberia, and a chain comprised of two large clusters (St Joseph's Catholic Hospital in Monrovia, Liberia, and in Nigeria) stemming from a single Ebola case (the left-most line in Fig. 1 ) leading to 37-38 infections in this section. For this paper, we focused our efforts on refining the transmission chain from the two clusters in Nigeria and at St Joseph's Catholic Hospital (illustrated in Fig. 1 ), and the transmission parameters we present are based on those two clusters Constructing Ebola transmission chains from West Africa (we included the online sources for all three segments in the Supplementary Material). Compared with published sources such as Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report [12] and WHO 2014 reports (published in early and late October, 2014, respectively), we estimate that a low-resolution chain could have been constructed by mid-September 2014, but the final resolution with reliable parameters would have required a further 3-4 weeks (mid-to-late October) for the information to be available from the online sources we used.",

Our approach to gathering epidemiological details via indigenous online sources adds a 'local' news angle to the growing collection of papers reporting similar methods that tap international and specialty online sources. A paper on the Ebola virus disease epidemic by Cleaton et al. [13] sourced reports from Both approaches appear to yield details useful for generating transmission trees and estimating modeling parameters, and each of these approaches has its advantages. The sources used in the Cleaton, Majumder, and Chowell papers were trusted, 'authoritative' sources, including reports generated by the public health organizations themselves (such as the WHO reports), and stories authored by professional journalists who had experience reporting in medical and public health news beats. A potential risk of these sources is that some (WHO situation reports aside) probably existed because the Ebola and MERS-CoV epidemics had caught sufficient worldwide attention. It is likely that these international news services and journal-based resources would not have been publishing news during and prior to the critical initial weeks of an outbreak, or for an outbreak that had failed to gather a worldwide audience. An advantage of our approach is that the majority of online sources we used were already publishing stories at the local, state, or national level before the Ebola virus disease epidemic began, persisted through it, and most remain online to this day. While incorporating Ebola virus disease stories into the regular news cycle was new, familiarity with the culture and population would have required few (if any) additional steps.",

Compared with the MMWR report, our first-generation case disease onset times tended to be nearly 1 week later, and were approximately the same for second-and thirdgeneration cases. Our transmission tree differs from that in Figure 2 .B reported in Folarin et al. in the number of cases (we have 20, they have 19) and in the number of second-generation branches stemming from the index case (we have three, they have two). Both transmission trees show 13 cases linked to the index case, and the branches related to Port Harcourt secondary and tertiary cases are in agreement. We were not able to articulate why we had one more second-generation branch than that stemming from the contact tracing record as reported in Folarin. Of these three secondary branches, two were fairly well established in the online accounts: a professional contact to the Nigeria index case fled to Port Harcourt, and a nurse to the index case had extended contact with her fianc\u00e9. The third second-generation branch was harder to establish, though we believe there was sufficient evidence to support the case that a physician who contacted the index case likely also had contact with his wife who later became symptomatic. Explanations for the discrepancies between our account and those recounted in MMWR and Folarin include incorrect recall or recall bias, errors (for example, one story detailed an extremely unlikely account of patient-physician contact, transmission, subsequent symptom onset, and isolation all taking place on 28 July 2014), dissimilar use of the concept of elapsed days, or just incorrect firstor second-hand information. Whereas the contact tracing information from the Folarin paper's supplementary material had precise dates for hospitalization and symptom onset, we sometimes had to infer symptom onset based on mentions of seeking medical attention or hospitalization. Survivors gave the most detailed reports, but they generally needed to be discharged from isolation and spend some time recovering before they could tell their stories to the media. There was an inevitable loss of precision since as much as 2-4 weeks would elapse before survivors could meet with journalists. In practice, this would cause in an important lag or delay before these more precise survivor-based details became available.",

A possible explanation for this difference is that the news stories preferentially reported on patients within more explosive portions of the outbreak, including patients who were not identified and thus continued to pose risk of transmission to their contacts well after their symptoms began. Transmissions from these patients would then produce longer serial intervals than transmissions from patients identified earlier. This phenomenon has been observed in data from outbreaks of other diseases: serial intervals early in the 2003 SARS outbreak in Singapore were observed to be longer than those occurring later in the outbreak after control measures were implemented [17] . Similarly, serial intervals during the recent explosive outbreak of MERS in South Korea were observed to be longer than those occurring during sporadic, smaller transmission clusters in the Middle East [18] .",

About 5 days before this test, the medical director had direct contact with a symptomatic Ebola patient. Eleven days after the initial negative test, the medical director's health had not improved and he was retestedthis time the result was positive for Ebola virus. Unfortunately, following the initial test result (the false negative), many of those caring for the medical director believed he was suffering with malaria and relaxed their use of personal protective equipment. (We included the false-negative and true-positive test events in Fig. 1 for the hospital director.) This event produced relatively high-risk exposures among the hospital staff some 5 days later than what they would have otherwise encountered. Our serial interval estimates were about 4 days longer than those published by the WHO, some of which may be the result of the unique circumstances surrounding the exposures just outlined.",

As demonstrated in the paragraph above, familiarity with event circumstances gleaned through reading transmission accounts may help infectious disease modelers think through anomalies in their data.

Reading personal accounts of morbidity and mortality may lead to a deep appreciation and compassion for the people and their circumstances at the community level, including reactions to and perceptions of public health emergencies. Finally, public health agencies (local, national, and more so for international) adopting this approach may gain an understanding of unique cultural and socio-political issues associated with an infectious disease outbreak (e.g. West African funeral practices). This appreciation is not inconsequential: 'It is the population experience of disease, in actual societies, that is the subject of our investigations', write Nancy Kreiger and Sally Zierler in their paper [19] on the nature of explaining the public's health. 'Epidemiologic theory reminds us that our work has a context, and that this context is human society'.",

Sometimes informants speculate, descriptions of people and events can be ambiguous, stories may be updated without highlighting that corrections were made, and newspapers may print inaccurate reports. Reporters may not be aware of or follow official case definitionsespecially when those definitions are in flux. It is not always possible to know a reporter's 2000 W. B. P. Pettey and others accidental or deliberate political, cultural, or social biases, or how thoroughly reporters vetted and corroborated their facts. The nature of interest-in-print and privacy means certain important transmission activities (such as sexual transmission of Ebola virus) likely will not be printed. Government censoring or altering stories poses a risk to the timely availability of relevant information. Nearly all of the stories we read were written in English; reports in other languages would likely add another level of complexity that could be addressed by including native speakers on research teams. Not surprisingly, the most sensational and extreme events were the most likely to be reported (journalists sometimes refer to this as the Man Bites Dog effect) and also the most detailed, and therefore the easiest to document. The events related to the Ebola cluster in Nigeria, for example, were easy to reconstruct because they generated intense public interest and press coverage: vivid headlines and stories relayed tales of nurses and physicians who died preventing Nigeria's Ebola index patientwho Nigeria's (then) President Goodluck Jonathan called 'a crazy man'from escaping into Lagos, Nigeria, a city of 21 million people, with one of the world's deadliest infectious diseases. Among the dead were a soon-to-be-married (and pregnant) nurse and a physician who came from one of Nigeria's most prominent families. In this regard, it would be important to perform these searches with respect and compassion. Online newspaper reports appear to be excluded from recent discussions on the ethics of mining social media and big data for public health purposes [20, 21] . Finally, the true extent of the outbreak would likely not be known from newspaper reports. It is important to consider the generalizability and future applicability of this approach. It is likely that we could reproduce this strategy for another cluster of cases in the recent Ebola outbreak or another public health crisis; the key factor is the availability of person-level details. It would be challenging to predict the level of details available especially as the next outbreak may be in a different region of the world with different social morays, news reporting practices, and expectations of privacy.",
