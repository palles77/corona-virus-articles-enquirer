Hierarchical models were used to build informative a priori distributions on the reproduction ratio and the reporting rates. The accuracy and sharpness of forecasts improved substantially when these a priori distributions were used in models for prediction. For example, early forecasts of nal epidemic size obtained without historical information were 3.3 times too high on average (range: 0.2 to 5.8) with respect to the eventual size, but were far closer (1.1 times the real value on average, range: 0.4 to 1.5) using information on past CHIKV epidemics in the same places. Likewise, the 97.5% upper bound for maximal incidence was 15.3 times (range: 2.0 to 63.1) the actual peak incidence, and became much sharper at 2.4 times (range: 1.3 to 3.9) the actual peak incidence with informative a priori distributions. Improvements were more limited for the date of peak incidence and the total duration of the epidemic. The framework can adapt to all forecasting models at the early stages of emerging Aedes-transmitted outbreaks.",

These analyses often focused on transmissibility and reproduction numbers rather than on forecasting the future impact of the epidemic. Indeed, forecasting is dicult before the epidemic reaches its peak, all the more when information on natural history, transmissibility and under-reporting is limited [15] . Yet, it is precisely at the beginning of an outbreak that forecasts would help public health authorities decide on the best strategies for control or mitigation.",

Briey, the two main components of the model were: (i) a mechanistic reconstruction of the distribution of the serial interval of the disease (the time interval between disease onset in a primary case and a secondary case) that allows bypassing vector compartments; (ii) a transmission model for the generation of observed secondary cases in the human host. The generation time distribution was reconstructed by estimating the durations of each part of the infection cycle using disease-and mosquito-specic data from the literature, and assuming a xed local temperature of 28 \u2022 C, as described in more detail in the supplementary appendix. This led to gamma distributions with mean 2.5 weeks (standard deviation: 0.7) for ZIKV and with mean 1.6 weeks (sd: 0.6) for CHIKV.",

Hierarchical models are particularly adapted to this task, as they naturally pool information among several past epidemics and capture both within-and between-location variability [43] . We used separate hierarchical models to obtain information about (i) transmissibility and reporting during CHIKV outbreaks in the French West Indies and (ii) relative transmissibility and reporting between ZIKV and CHIKV in French Polynesia, rather than from a global joint model (as in [44] ). This choice was made to show that prior information can be combined from separate sources in a modular way. We nally considered two versions of informative priors to capture dierent degrees of knowledge. The (L)ocal priors corresponded with estimates for the previous CHIKV epidemic in the same island, therefore including island-specic epidemic drivers, such as population structure and distribution, socio-economic circumstances and environmental conditions. On the other hand, the (R)egional priors encompassed the diversity of past observations within the region, making priors valid for a typical island of the West Indies, especially when no other epidemic has been observed previously.",

Worst case projections on maximal incidence were very imprecise, ranging between 2 and 63 times the eventually reached maximal weekly incidence. Using historical data led to a substantial increase of the quality of these forecasts from the very early stages of the epidemics. Using local priors, the ratio between forecasts and reality ranged between 0.4 and 1.5 for epidemic size and between 1.3 and 3.9 for maximal incidence.

Comparing and systematically evaluating models' forecasting performances is still at the beginning. As of now, comparisons targeted the merits of dierent models including exponential growth models, sigmoid models, or mechanistic epidemic models [45] . Our work provides a complementary approach where information from past epidemics is combined using hierarchical models to inform on parameter ranges, thus increasing the reliability of early forecasts. It was applied here to a dynamic discrete-time SIR model that for its parsimony is well-adapted to real-time forecasting. Complex mechanistic models can provide a more realistic description of the epidemic, accounting, for instance, for heterogenous spatial distribution of individuals and mobility coupling a relevant ingredient for describing epidemics in more extended spatial areas , or vector population dynamics and its mixing with humans. Our framework could in principle be adapted to these more sophisticated models.",

For inuenza, it has been reported that the reproduction ratios in two successive u pandemics (1889 and 1918) showed substantial correlation (r = 0.62) in the same US cities, even years apart [54] . For Aedes -transmitted diseases, comparisons of ZIKV and dengue virus outbreaks [55] and of ZIKV with CHIKV outbreaks [44] in the same locations have highlighted similarities in the epidemic dynamics. In any case, careful consideration of all the factors that may inuence transmission and reporting is needed. For example, contrary to CHIKV, some cases of sexual transmission have been reported for ZIKV [56, 57] . Yet, no epidemics were seen in locations without enough Aedes mosquitoes, as for example in metropolitan France, despite the introductions of several hundreds ZIKV infected cases [58] . This justies the use of CHIKV epidemic data to provide prior information on ZIKV in the epidemic context considered here. More generally, documenting, analyzing and comparing more systematically past epidemics [59] is necessary to provide the data required to derive prior information. In particular, informed with epidemiological records of the recent CHIKV and ZIKV epidemics, our approach could be applied to potential future emergences of other Aedes -transmitted diseases such as Mayaro virus [60] , Ross River virus [61] or Usutu virus [62] once transportability is deemed plausible.",

At this week, predictions with the NI priors were largely o-target, overestimating the future magnitude of the epidemic in all three islands. Using the R priors reduced the gap between forecasts and future observation. Major improvements in both accuracy and sharpness were obtained only with L priors. These results were typical of the initial phase of the epidemics, as shown inFig. 4. Overall, the quality of the forecasts improved as K increases in all three islands and also as prior distributions brought more specic information. Results of the sensitivity analysis show that L priors dened here outperformed or performed at least equivalently to the alternative priors denition tested (supplementary appendix).",
