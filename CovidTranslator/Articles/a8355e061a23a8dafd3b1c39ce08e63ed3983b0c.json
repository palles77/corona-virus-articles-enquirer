            "text": "Protein homeostasis is essential for most cellular processes. The ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) is responsible for much of the regulated proteolysis in the cell, and has non-degradative functions as well. Ubiquitin is a small 76 amino-acid protein that can be reversibly attached to other proteins and lies at the core of an elaborate post-translational modification pathway. Several ubiquitin-like proteins (UBLs) have also been identified, including NEDD8, SUMO and ISG15, which share a characteristic three-dimensional fold with ubiquitin but are otherwise distinct. The UPS and UBL conjugation pathways have multiple essential biological roles and it is not surprising that their function, and often malfunction, are important factors in various human diseases 1 , including numerous cancer types [2] [3] [4] , cardiovascular disease 5 , viral diseases 6 and neurodegenerative disorders 3 . These diseases may feasibly be targeted by modulating components of the UPS and UBL conjugation pathways using small-molecule inhibitors.",

Ubiquitin is then passed to one of several E2 conjugating enzymes through a transthiolation Abstract | The ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) and ubiquitin-like protein (UBL) conjugation pathways are integral to cellular protein homeostasis. The growing recognition of the fundamental importance of these pathways to normal cell function and in disease has prompted an in-depth search for small-molecule inhibitors that selectively block the function of these pathways. However, our limited understanding of the molecular mechanisms and biological consequences of UBL conjugation is a significant hurdle to identifying drug-like inhibitors of enzyme targets within these pathways. Here, we highlight recent advances in understanding the role of some of these enzymes and how these new insights may be the key to developing novel therapeutics for diseases including immuno-inflammatory disorders, cancer, infectious diseases, cardiovascular disease and neurodegenerative disorders. Figure 1 | overview of the enzymatic cascade involved in ubiquitin-like protein (uBL) conjugation and the ubiqitin-proteasome system (uPs). a | Ubiquitin-activating enzyme (UAE) binds ATP and ubiquitin (Ub) to form a ternary complex consisting of E1-ubiquitin thioester with ubiquitin-AMP bound (see text for details). The thioester-bound ubiquitin is then passed to one of several E2 conjugating enzymes through a transthiolation reaction. The ubiquitin-charged E2 then forms a complex with an E3 ligase and a protein substrate to transfer ubiquitin to a lysine residue on the substrate. To mark substrates for degradation, multiple ubiquitins are similarly recruited to produce a K48-linked polyubiquitin chain. Following release from the E3, the proteasome recognizes the polyubiquitin chain, and the substrate is deubiquitylated and destroyed. Substrates marked with ubiquitin chains linked through lysines 6, 11, 27, 29 and 33 also seem to be primarily destined for degradation. Alternatively, substrates marked with monoubiquitin, linear ubiquitin chains or K63 ubiquitin chains are involved in signalling functions that are independent of the proteasome. A second E1 (ubiquitin-like modifier activating enzyme 6 (UBA6)) also activates ubiquitin, but the function(s) of this pathway are unknown. b | Nine classes of UBL and eight E1 activating enzymes participate in diverse biological pathways in humans. E1s, E2s and UBLs are structurally and mechanistically related but are unique to each pathway. Ubiquitin and some E2s are exceptions in that they can be used by both the UAE and UBA6 pathways.

This form of E1 is competent for transthiolation of the thioester-bound UBL to a pathway-specific E2 and is required for the downstream function of UBL conjugation. As the enzymatic mechanism of E1s suggests, there are multiple points at which a small molecule could potentially inhibit UBL activation (BOX 2) . For example, the inhibition of UBL-acyl adenylate formation could be achieved by preventing ATP from binding to E1 using an ATP-competitive small-molecule inhibitor similar to those now commonly used to inhibit kinases and other ATP-dependent enzymes. Alternatively, blocking E1~UBL thioester formation could be achieved by targeting the E1 active-site thiol. Blocking transfer of an E1 thioester-bound UBL to an E2 using molecules that compete with E1-E2 binding is yet another potential mechanism of inhibition 17 . Several strategies for inhibiting E1 function are now available and are beginning to demonstrate the feasibility of selective E1 targeting as a means to further understand UBL pathway biology",

These classes differ in their protein interaction domains for binding to E2s, as well as in other domains related to substrate binding. The RING finger and U-box domains have an adaptor function in bringing ubiquitin-loaded E2 and the substrate together to promote ubiquitylation, whereas HECT E3s form a thioester intermediate with ubiquitin before transfer to a substrate. Individual E3s within these classes are responsible for the recruitment of specific substrate proteins to be tagged with ubiquitin or, in some cases, another UBL.

The molecular mechanisms of E3 function have been elucidated primarily from structural studies. Identifying the substrate-binding surface or related sites mediating ubiquitylation activity, including sites of assembly for components of the E3 complexes, may facilitate the discovery of small-molecule inhibitors of E3s. Indeed, recent reports of inhibitors of cullin-RING ligases (CRLs; of which SCF is an archetype, see REF. 23 for review) represent significant advances. In one example, a chemical genetics screen in yeast for enhancers of rapamycin identified an inhibitor of SCF Met30 that directly bound to the F-box adaptor Met30 and diminished its binding to the core cullin-RING complex in vivo. Therefore, inhibition was achieved through the apparent failure to assemble a functional SCF complex 24 .",

CRBN forms a CRL complex with cullin 4 and the adaptor DNA damage-binding protein 1 (DDB1) that has E3 activity and is inhibited by thalidomide. Interestingly, a mutant of CRBN that does not bind thalidomide but retains E3 activity confers resistance to the teratogenic effects of thalidomide in animal models of embryonic development. This suggests that thalidomide exerts its teratogenic effects through CRBN. Together, these results not only shed light on the mechanism of thalidomide teratogenicity, but are also an example of the modulation of an E3 in a clinical setting using a small molecule (although with unintended and tragic consequences).

First, as UBLs are often translated as pro-proteins or as linear fusion proteins, DUB activity is required to cleave the C termini of UBLs and generate their mature forms. Second, DUBs can remove UBLs from modified substrates, attenuating UBL signalling functions and recycling free UBLs. Third, in the case of ubiquitin, DUBs have a polyubiquitin chain editing or 'proof reading' function. In mammals, there are nearly 100 DUBs belonging to five different families, the majority of which are cysteine proteases; the remainder consists of a small number of zinc metalloproteases. Historically, it has been problematic identifying drug-like inhibitors of cysteine proteases, whereas the general class of metalloproteases has been more amenable to inhibition using small-molecule drugs (BOX 4) .

A new approach using small molecules to form inhibitory UBL-AMP mimetics in situ overcomes this limitation. Inhibition of the NEDD8 pathway was recently demonstrated using the small-molecule NEDD8-activating enzyme (NAE) inhibitor, MLN4924 (REFS 112, 113) . MLN4924 is an adenosine sulphamate analogue that binds to the nucleotide-binding pocket of the NEDD8 thioester form of NAE and forms a covalent adduct with NEDD8 by a mechanism referred to as 'substrate-assisted inhibition' (FIG. 2b) . Because NEDD8 conjugation of cullin proteins is required for the ubiquitin ligase activity of the cullin-RING finger ligases (CRLs) 23,112,114,115, (FIG. 3) , blocking NAE results in the inhibition of CRL activity and the stabilization of CRL substrates, some of which are important for cancer cell growth and survival (TABLE 3) . For example, NAE inhibition results in the stabilization of CDT1, a substrate of the CRL1 SKP2 and CRL4-DDB1 CDT2 ligases, leading to DNA re-replication and apoptosis in proliferating cells 112 . Studies using NF-\u03baB-dependent human cancer models have demonstrated increased levels of the CRL1\u03b2 TRCP substrate pI\u03baB\u03b1 and inhibition of NF-\u03baB activity and apoptosis 116, 117 , suggesting the feasibility of NAE inhibition for the treatment of disease that is associated with constitutively active NF-\u03baB signalling 112 The recent discovery of the importance of linear ubiquitin chains in NF-\u03baB activation extends the complexity of the regulation of the system. A linear ubiquitin chain-assembly complex (LUBAC) conjugates head-totail-linked linear polyubiquitin chains to target proteins. LUBAC is involved in the physiological regulation of the canonical NF-\u03baB pathway by binding to NEMO (NF-\u03baB essential modulator; also known as IKK\u03b3) and in the conjugation of linear polyubiquitin chains on to specific lysine residues of NEMO 30 . The recruitment of LUBAC to the TNF receptor 1 (TNF-R1) signalling complex (TNF-RSC) is stimulation-dependent and requires TRADD, TRAF2 and cellular inhibitors of apoptosis (IAPs), but not NEMO or RIP1. It seems that LUBAC is recruited to the TNF-R1 by cellular IAP-generated ubiquitin chains and generates linear ubiquitin chains to increase the efficiency of NF-\u03baB and jun N-terminal kinase activation. Activation of NF-\u03baB increases TNFdependent gene expression, whereas activation of jun N-terminal kinase inhibits TNF-mediated apoptosis. The attraction of NEMO to the TNF-RSC is increased by LUBAC, and the enzymatic activity of LUBAC seems to stabilize the TNF-RSC 31 .",

The specific amino-acid residues of NEMO that are involved in binding linear ubiquitin chains have been reported to be mutated in humans and result in X-linked ectodermal dysplasia and immunodeficiency 32 . The binding of polyubiquitin chains to NEMO is interesting in that the C-terminal zinc finger of NEMO can bind ubiquitin as well as UBAN. Although neither UBAN nor the zinc finger show any preference for K63-linked chains, together the domains form a high-affinity K63-specific ubiquitin-binding domain. This suggests that the main function of the C-terminal half of NEMO is to specifically bind K63-linked polyubiquitin chains. The binding of NEMO to linear polyubiquitin chains is dependent on the UBAN alone and does not require the presence of the zinc finger 33 . Furthermore, unanchored K63-linked polyubiquitin chains can directly activate TAK1 and IKK kinases. This indicates a new role for free ubiquitin chains in activating kinases. Cleavage of the unanchored K63-linked ubiquitin chains prevents TAK1 and IKK activation 34 . Further research may show that unanchored ubiquitin chains are generated as 'second messages' , as with cAMP.",

It seems that E3s use different E2s to catalyse distinct types of ubiquitin tagging. For example, RING finger IAPs seem to bind to UBCH5A, UBCH5C, UBC7, UBC8 and UBC13/UEV1A 35 . It is also generally thought that, although E3s are the ultimate arbiters of substrate selection for ubiquitylation, the E2s determine what type of polymeric ubiquitin chain will be formed.

For this reason, a | HECT domain E3s use a unique mechanism in which ubiquitin (Ub) is transferred from an E2 to a conserved cysteine residue within the E3 via transthiolation and is then transferred from the E3 to a substrate amino group. All other types of E3 facilitate transfer of Ub from a charged E2 directly to a substrate. b | The RING finger motif comprises a Zn 2+ binding domain that is required for E2 binding. The U-box also binds E2s and is structurally similar to the RING motif, but does not bind metal ions. Monomeric RING finger E3s and U-box E3s bind to both the substrate and the E2. In multimeric RING finger complexes, the RING finger protein binds the E2 while other proteins in the complex bind the substrate.

            "text": "The UPS and heart disease. The role of the UPS in cardiac function and disease is again complex and sometimes conflicting. Proteasome inhibitors have been used in the experimental manipulation of heart disease. The outcomes so far indicate, as might be expected, that the effects of proteasome inhibitors are concentration dependent, with lower concentrations mediating cytoprotective effects and higher concentrations being toxic. For example, studies on non-toxic proteasome inhibition in neonatal rat cardiac myocytes show upregulation of antioxidative enzymes, which confers cardioprotection. This upregulation is a response to mild proteasome inhibition by antioxidative transcription factor NF-E2-related factor 2 (NRF2)-dependent transcriptional activation of an antioxidant response element (ARE) in the superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1) promoter. The induction of antioxidative enzymes and cytoprotection was evident in cardiomyocytes from wild-type mice, but was completely abolished in cells from Nrf2-knockout animals 47 . More understanding of the UPS in the pathophysiology of heart disease is needed to contemplate new routes for therapy. It seems that pressure overload, ischaemic heart disease or genetic mutations in contractile proteins that cause heart failure are accompanied by elevation in levels of misfolded proteins, which may be removed by the UPS and through autophagy. However, proteasome inhibitors may be useful for the treatment of cardiac hypertrophy and ischaemic heart diseases 48 . A complication is that impaired proteasome function is commonly associated with myocardial ischaemic injury, but recent evidence also supports a cardioprotective role for proteasome inhibitors in myocardial ischaemia 49 . The loss of cardiomyocytes is a key problem in the development of cardiovascular disease. Two main processes mediate cardiomyocyte loss: necrosis and apoptosis. In contrast to necrosis, apoptosis is a relatively well-understood, regulated process that is essential in normal development and tissue homeostasis. Tight regulation of both processes is crucial, especially in post-mitotic cells lacking regenerative capacity, such as cardiomyocytes and neurons. The UPS is involved in the regulation of cardiomyocyte apoptosis 50 and possibly necrosis.",

As expected, ubiquitin-dependent processes, including the degradation of ubiquitylated proteins by the 26S proteasome, by autophagy and in the endosome-lysosome pathway, have central roles in neuronal development, homeostasis and disease. These catabolic systems are essential for neuronal activities, including synaptogenesis, cellcell interactions (for example, neuromuscular junction formation 53 ) and synaptic plasticity 54 . In the adult central and peripheral nervous systems, which are based predominately on non-dividing cells, protein ubiquitylation and deubiquitylation are essential for neuronal survival. Most age-related chronic neurodegenerative diseases involve the accumulation of proteins in aggregates, frequently as paranuclear inclusions (FIG. 6) . In every case, proteins within the inclusions are ubiquitylated. a | E2s engage in a sequence of highly specific interactions to faithfully transfer a ubiquitin-like protein (UBL) to a substrate. E2s first bind their respective E1 to receive an activated UBL through a transthiolation reaction. In most cases, the E2-UBL thioester then binds a specific E3 or E3-substrate complex. During catalysis to protein substrates, the UBL is transferred from the E2 thiol active site to the amino group of a substrate acceptor lysine residue that is positioned for nucleophilic attack on the E2-UBL thioester bond. Each of these E2 interactions offers potential opportunities for selective inhibition as illustrated by the following examples. b | Targeting E2~UBL thioester formation by blocking E1-E2 protein-protein interaction. A synthetic peptide called UBC12N26 corresponds to the 26-residue amino terminus extension of UBC12 that specifically binds the NEDD8-activiating enzyme (NAE). UBC12N26 competes for binding of UBC12 to NAE, thereby blocking transthiolation of NEDD8 to UBC12 and inhibiting downstream NEDD8-dependent events. c | Targeting E3-dependent E2 allosteric activation. In some cases, E2-E3 binding is necessary but not sufficient for optimal UBL transfer to a substrate. For example, the E3 gp78 binds the E2, UBE2G2, through a RING finger and a second domain called G2BR that binds the backside of UBE2G2, which is opposite from the catalytic cysteine and distal from the RING binding surface. Blocking G2BR interaction with UBE2G2 would inhibit allosteric activation of the E2 and prevent subsequent ubiquitylation of substrate proteins. d | Targeting catalysis of UBL transfer. A conserved asparagine residue in E2s (exemplified by asparagine 79 in UBC13) has been shown to be crucial for UBL transfer and is thought to form the oxyanion hole required to stabilize the E2 thioester-substrate transition state intermediate.

Four of these families -the ubiquitin C-terminal hydrolases (UCHs), ubiquitin-specific proteases (USPs), ovarian tumour domain proteins and Machado-Joseph disease protein -are all papain-like cysteine peptidases. Many potent inhibitors exist for enzymes of this general mechanism, but historically there has been limited success in turning these leads into drugs. Nevertheless, a desire to clear this hurdle persists because of the many biological roles that DUBs have. Individual cysteine peptidase DUBs have been associated with pathways of importance in specific diseases, such as USP1 with the Fanconi anaemia DNA repair pathway 131 ; USP6 with aneurysmal bone cysts and with a wider role in mesenchymal tumours 14 ; and USP7 with non-small cell lung adenocarcinoma 14, 132 .

CSN5 is a subunit of the COP9 signalosome, and it functions to regulate NEDD8 attachment to cullins, thereby regulating cullin-RING ligase activity and stability. The biological consequences of CSN5 inhibition might be similar to the inhibition of NEDD8-activating enzyme (BOX 2) . AMSH is associated with the endosomal sorting complex required for transport, where its activity regulates trafficking of receptor tyrosine kinases and G protein-coupled receptors 138 . Finally, BRCC36 is part of two complexes, BRCA1 A and BRISC, and has a role in the DNA damage response. In Parkinson's disease and dementia with Lewy bodies, there are intraneuronal deposits of \u03b1-synuclein. However, the seminal feature of all these diseases is regional extensive neuronal loss in the brain and spinal cord. It has been difficult to recapitulate these features of the diseases using mouse transgenesis to overexpress amyloidogenic proteins in the brain 67, 68 . These approaches have led to intraneuronal aggregates and extraneuronal deposits but not extensive neurodegeneration. By contrast, gene targeting to knock out a proteasomal gene and autophagy genes has resulted in the accumulation of intraneuronal inclusions containing ubiquitylated proteins (some resembling human disease) and extensive regional neuronal loss or neurodegeneration. Currently, it seems that age-related chronic neurodegenerative disease can be directly attributed to some dysfunction of the UPS and/or autophagy. Any malfunction of these key neuronal processes for regulated removal of proteins results in molecular neuropathological features of neurodegenerative disease. Promotion of the degradation of ubiquitylated proteins by 26S proteasomes (for example, with 26S proteasome activators such as inhibitors of the proteasomal deubiquitylating enzyme USP14 (REF. 69)) or by autophagy (for example, with mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin) inhibitors 70 ) would facilitate slowing or prevention of chronic neurodegenerative disease.",

Therefore, further studies of the consequences of genetic deletion of neuronal 26S proteasomes (and autophagic functions) will identify receptor and enzyme targets for novel therapeutic developments to slow neuronal death and neurodegeneration. An example of a novel signalling target is the discovery that mutations in optineurin cause amyotrophic lateral sclerosis 71 .

            "text": "The fundamental role of the UPS and UBL conjugation pathways in normal cell function and in disease prompts the search for inhibitors that selectively disrupt pathway function. Despite our limited understanding of the molecular mechanisms of pathway targets, the inhibition of pathway enzymes is an attractive, and increasingly tractable, approach to targeting aberrant signalling pathways in multiple cancers and other diseases. Therapeutic intervention in the UPS, the endosome-lysosome system, the autophagic system and in UBL signalling is an emerging area for the treatment of acute and chronic human diseases, including the treatment of viral and bacterial infections. Some cancers and other disease settings in which these pathways are constitutively active have been shown to be more sensitive to inhibition, potentially limiting the side effects of inhibiting all or part of these key cellular systems.",

Beyond its use in multiple myeloma and mantle cell lymphoma, the most exciting new therapeutic application of bortezomib is as a drug to prevent antibody-mediated rejection of renal allografts in transplant patients by depleting normal antibodyproducing plasma cells 97 . In addition, MLN4924 has established the precedent for inhibiting a specific E1 target, with mechanistic studies indicating the possibility of such an approach for other E1s. Understanding the molecular mechanisms involved in the interactions seen at each step of the UPS and UBL conjugation pathways, between E1s, E2s, E3s, substrates, DUBs and the proteasome itself, is increasing through the use of tools such as small-molecule inhibitors and small interfering RNA, improved compound screening strategies and crystal structure studies. Consequently, there are opportunities present and emerging for other novel therapeutics that target numerous specific pathways in the UPS and UBL conjugation pathways.",

All E1s share similar overall structural features and an ATP-dependent, multi-step mechanism for ubiquitin/ UBL activation. Because E1s perform the first step of UBL activation, selective inhibition of an individual E1 would be expected to block the activation of each of the substrate UBLs for that E1, and subsequently block the function of affected UBL pathways.E1s catalyse UBL activation by the multi-step process detailed inFIG. 2.In the first step, ATP and UBL bind together to form a UBL-acyl adenylate intermediate, releasing inorganic pyrophosphate",

The E1 catalytic cysteine then attacks the UBL-adenylate to form a thioester with the C terminus of the UBL. The E1 subsequently binds a second ATP and UBL, again forming a UBL-adenylate and resulting in the formation of a ternary complex consisting of an E1-UBL thioester with UBL-adenylate bound to it. This form of the E1 is fully competent to transfer thioester-bound UBL to a cognate E2 enzyme and initiate the downstream effects of UBL signalling. Small molecules, including the pyrazone derivative PYR41, JS-K and MLN4924, use distinct mechanisms to block this process at different stages of the E1 reaction cycle (see BOX 2 for further details). b | Substrate-assisted mechanism-based E1 inhibition. E1s use a multistep mechanism to form a ternary complex consisting of an E1~UBL thioester (~ denotes a high-energy bond) with UBL-adenylate bound to it (steps 1-3). This form of E1 is competent for UBL transfer to an E2 by a transthiolation reaction (step 4). The NEDD8-activating enzyme (NAE)-selective inhibitor MLN4924 and related adenosine sulphamate analogues are mechanism-based inhibitors of E1s and form covalent UBL-inhibitor adducts in situ, catalysed by the E1 itself. Inhibitors of this class bind exclusively to the UBL thioester form of E1 shown in step 2 and attack the thioester bond to yield the UBL-inhibitor adduct. The UBL-inhibitor adduct mimics UBL -adenylate, the first intermediate in the E1 reaction cycle, but cannot be further used in subsequent intra-enzyme reactions.
