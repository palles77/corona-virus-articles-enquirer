Since that time, Italy and nations throughout the world have adopted very stringent and severe measures to protect populations from spread of infection. Despite these measures, the number of infected people is growing exponentially, with a significant number of patients developing acute respiratory insufficiency. Endoscopy departments face significant risk for diffusion of respiratory diseases that can be spread via an airborne route, including aspiration of oral and fecal material via endoscopes. The purpose of this article is to discuss the measures, with specific focus on personal protection equipment and dress code modalities, implemented in our hospital to prevent further dissemination of COVID-19 infection.

After septic shock, refractory metabolic acidosis and coagulation dysfunction can lead to death with a case fatality rate reported to be 3.5%. 6 Human-to-human transmission occurs primarily through direct contact or air droplets. 7, 8 The higher risk of transmission is within approximately 1 meter (about 3 feet) from the infected person; however, the maximum distance is still undetermined. 9 Although healthcare personnel working in endoscopy units are not directly involved in the diagnostic and therapeutic evaluation of COVID-19-positive patients, endoscopy should still be regarded as a risky procedure. This risk of exposure and subsequent infection of endoscopy personnel is, in fact, substantial in cases of patients with respiratory disease that can be spread via an airborne route. 10 A recent study by Johnston et al 11 confirmed the significant and unrecognized exposure of the endoscopist's face to potentially infectious biologic samples during endoscopy. Endoscopy procedures demand short physical distance from patients to personnel, and according to studies performed during the global SARS outbreak of 2003, droplets from infected patients could reach persons located 6 feet (approximately 1.83 meters) or more from the source. 12 Finally, we do believe the risk of exposure of endoscopy personnel is not limited to upper endoscopy procedures considering the recent detection of SARS-CoV in biopsy specimens and stools, suggesting a possible fecal-oral transmission. 13 This could be even more relevant given that virus transmission can occur during the incubation period in asymptomatic patients.",

Disinfectants used for this purpose should be tested according to the European Standard EN 14885. The product used must be as follows: bactericidal, mycobactericidal, fungicidal, and virucidal against enveloped and nonenveloped viruses. Cases of hepatitis B and C virus transmission have been reported in the medical literature but have been related to inappropriate cleaning and disinfection. When all currently reprocessing guidelines are strictly followed, the risk of transmission of any kind of viruses is extremely rare to nonexistent.
