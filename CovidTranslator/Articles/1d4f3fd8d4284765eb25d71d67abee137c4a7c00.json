By searching through Science Citation Index, this study analyzed the article literature on SARS and H7N9 influenza, particularly papers in the leading journals The Lancet, New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM), Nature and Science. The results show that the quantity and quality of SARS and H7N9 influenza literature from mainland China changed distinctly over the course of 10 years. Researchers from mainland China published 12 article literature in the The Lancet, NEJM, Nature and Science about H7N9 influenza, whereas mainland China had only 2 article literature about SARS in the same journals. The literature reflects China's growing strength in the science and technology of emerging infectious disease.",

First, they all began in China; the first SARS patient was identified in Guangdong Province in 2002, and human H7N9 influenza infection first emerged in Shanghai in 2013. Second, they have a relatively high mortality rate, approximately 9.6 % for SARS (WHO 2003) and approximately 37.1 % for human H7N9 influenza infections (WHO 2015) . Third, they all caused worldwide alarm. Meanwhile they also have some differences, one being that SARS spread rapidly outside China and became epidemic in some other countries such as Canada, Singapore and Vietnam, although H7N9 influenza has been mainly confined to China. Another difference is that, unlike H7N9 influenza, SARS is capable of effective person-to-person transmission, although some research shows that the possibility of H7N9 influenza transmission via this route exists (Rudge and Coker 2013) .",
