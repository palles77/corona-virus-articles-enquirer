Exposure of HCP to an infectious source should be considered an urgent medical concern to ensure timely management and administration of postexposure prophylaxis, if available and indicated. Infection control and occupational health departments should be notified for management of exposed HCP, identification of all contacts of the index case, and application of immediate infection control measures for the index case and exposed HCP, if indicated.

They may serve as a reservoir for ongoing nosocomial transmission, particularly highly contagious infections such as varicella and measles [1] . Nosocomial transmission can result in infection of susceptible patients, outbreaks, work and patient care disruption, and increased cost [2, 3] . An occupational exposure is defined as an exposure of HCP to a material containing an infectious agent in a healthcare setting [1] . The exposure can occur in inpatient settings (e.g. patient rooms and laboratories), in outpatient settings (e.g. medical offices and dialysis units), and in nontraditional facilities (e.g. emergency medical and skilled nursing facilities) [1] . HCP include all paid and unpaid persons working in healthcare settings who can potentially be exposed to patients and/or to infectious materials, including body substances (e.g. blood, tissue, and specific body fluids), contaminated medical supplies and equipment, contaminated environmental surfaces, or contaminated air [1] . The infectious organism can be transmitted to HCP from a patient, another HCP, hospital visitor, or the environment by several routes (Table 1 ) [1] .",

PEP involves administration of anti-infective agents, vaccines, or immunoglobulin as soon as possible to HCP potentially exposed to a pathogen in order to reduce the risk of infection [1, 4] . Management of HCP exposure to infectious agents is paramount not only to prevent or attenuate the infection in the HCP but also to prevent secondary transmission to their contacts [1] .

There is an urgent need for PEP for serious infections such as HCV and Ebola. Ig should be used as PEP for nonimmune exposed HCP who are >40 years of age, or who are deemed immunocompromised, have chronic liver disease, or have severe allergic reaction to hepatitis A vaccine.",

For patients with AFB smear-negative pulmonary TB, the contagious period is considered to have begun 1 month prior to onset of symptoms and ends when the patient is placed under airborne isolation.Once weekly isoniazid and rifapentine is not recommended for HIV-infected patients receiving antiretroviral treatment, pregnant women or women expecting to become pregnant during treatment, and patients who are presumed to be infected with isoniazid or rifampicin-resistant strains.If the first and follow up TST or IGRA are both negative, the exposed person is classified as not infected with M. tuberculosis. However, if the first or follow up TST or IGRA are positive, the person is classified as infected with M. tuberculosis (either LTBI or TB disease).Liver function tests are indicated for patients with preexisting liver disease/abnormal liver function tests, on hepatotoxic drugs or alcohol, pregnant or 3 months postpartum, and HIV-infected.Isolation of confirmed TB patients can be discontinued if three consecutive sputum samples (collected on different days or 8-24 hours apart, with at least one being an early morning specimen) are AFB smear-negative, three consecutive cultures of the drainage are negative or drainage has ceased, and the patient is on effective therapy and is improving clinically.HCP are considered immune to varicella or HZ if they meet any of the following criteria: documentation of vaccination with two doses of varicella vaccine; diagnosis or verification of history of varicella disease/HZ by a clinician; serologic evidence of either immunity or disease. HCP who previously received two doses of varicella vaccine or had a history of varicella/HZ and then become immunocompromised (e.g. solid organ transplant recipients) should be considered immune, except for hematopoietic stem cell transplant recipients who should be considered immune only if they developed varicella/HZ infection after transplantation or received two doses of varicella vaccine after transplantation.VariZIG can be given up to 10 days after last exposure. For high-risk patients who have additional exposures to varicella-zoster virus \u20213 weeks after initial administration of VariZIG, a second dose should be considered.For immunocompromised patients with varicella pneumonia, airborne and contact precautions should be maintained for the duration of illness.Exposed HCP are considered immune if they meet one of the following criteria: documentation of vaccination with two doses of live measles virus-containing vaccine (with the first dose administered \u202112 months of age and the second dose at least 28 days after the first one), laboratory evidence of immunity (detection of measles immunoglobulin G in serum, with equivocal results considered negative), laboratory confirmation of disease, or birth before 1957. For HCP born before 1957, who lack the other criteria, facilities should consider vaccination with two doses of MMR vaccine at least 28 days apart.Severely immunocompromised individuals include the following: patients with severe primary immunodeficiency; patients who have received a peripheral stem cell transplant (until at least 12 months after completing all immunosuppressive treatment, or longer in patients who have developed graft-versus-host disease); patients with hematologic malignancies and lymphoma; patients on treatment for acute lymphoblastic leukemia and until at least 6 months after completion of immunosuppressive chemotherapy; persons receiving systemic immunosuppressive therapy, including corticosteroids \u20212 mg/kg of",

PEP should not be administered to HCP with brief contact not involving exposure to oral or respiratory secretions, since the risk of transmission is low.Azithromycin is not recommended as a first-line agent for PEP but it is an option in areas where fluoroquinolone-resistant strains of N. meningitidis have been identified.TMP-SMX should be used as an alternative agent to macrolides in patients who are allergic to macrolides or cannot tolerate them, or who are infected with a macrolide-resistant strain of B. pertussis.Although contraindicated in pregnancy, doxycycline and fluoroquinolones can be used as PEP because of the potential severity of plague and lack of effective alternatives.HCP contacts who are \u202165 years of age, or pregnant in their third trimester or 2 weeks postpartum, morbidly obese (BMI \u202140), or have chronic comorbid condition such as cardiopulmonary and renal disorder, or immunocompromised condition or who are in close contact with persons at high risk of influenza complications.HCP who provide care to high-risk patients such as hematopoietic stem cell transplant patients should be either work reassigned or excluded from work for 7 days from symptom onset or until resolution of respiratory symptoms, whichever is longer.Due to absence of either prior infection or vaccination.Contact with blood, urine, or feces of an infected patient, or contact of intact skin with saliva of an infected patient are not associated with risk of transmission of rabies and therefore PEP is not recommended.HCP are considered vaccinated if they received a complete series of a cell culture vaccine (i.e. three 1-mL doses administered intramuscularly in the deltoid area on days 0, 7 and 21 or 28) or other types of vaccine (e.g. duck embryo vaccine, Semple\u00d4 rabies vaccine) with previously documented protective titer of rabies virus neutralizing antibodies (>0.5 IU/mL or complete virus neutralization at a 1:5 serum dilution by RFFIT).Full dose of HRIG should be infiltrated in and around the wound if anatomically feasible, with the rest administered IM into the deltoid muscle, lateral or anterior thigh, or the gluteal region in a separate syringe and site from the vaccine. If HRIG is not administered when active vaccination is begun, it can be administered until day 7 but not after 7 days since the immune response to rabies vaccine would have developed by that time.Day 0 is the day when the first dose of vaccine was given. Rabies vaccine should be given in deltoid muscle but never in gluteal muscle due to the resulting titer of neutralizing antibodies is lower than expected.Ifprotective neutralizing antibodies are not attained (>0.5 IU/mL or complete virus neutralization at a 1:5 serum dilution by RFFIT), additional doses of vaccine could be on days 7 and 14.
