A basic knowledge of these elements is also clinically useful for predicting disease risk and epidemiologic characteristics, and for establishing appropriate management protocols (Table 84 .1). DNA viruses often replicate in the nucleus of the host cell, and tend to be more species specific. RNA viruses tend to replicate in the cytoplasm and are more prone to jumping between species. There are exceptions, such as poxviruses, asfarviruses, and iridoviruses, which are DNA viruses that replicate in the cytoplasm and have significantly lower host fidelity, and bornaviruses, which are RNA viruses with intranuclear replication.",

Influenza viruses are further divided into the genera Influenzavirus A, Influenzavirus B, and Influenzavirus C. Influenza A viruses tend to be the most pathogenic and have been well known to cause pandemic outbreaks in humans since 1918/1919. In marine mammals, both Influenza A and Influenza B have been diagnosed in wild populations of cetaceans and pinnipeds since the late 1970s. Mass mortalities in association with several different strains of Influenza A have been reported in harbor seals since 1979. Influenza B has been reported in stranded harbor seals since 1999, but not in association with epidemics. In cetaceans, Influenza A has been detected in stranded long-finned pilot whales. Additionally, South American fur seals (Arctocephalus australis), 16 Caspian seals (Pusa caspica), 17 Baikal seals (Phoca sibirica) and ringed seals (Phoca hispida), 18 Dall's porpoises (Phocoenoides dalli), 19 beluga whales, and other species have been reported to be seropositive for influenza. 20 Clinical signs include epistaxis, conjunctivitis, subcutaneous emphysema, and general weakness. Diagnosis of influenza can be based on a combination of clinical signs, qPCR, serology, and postmortem findings (gross pathology, histopathology, and immunohistochemistry). Seal-to-human influenza transmission has been described. Direct contact on massive mortalities and one case of direct contact with respiratory secretion are associated with conjunctivitis in humans. 21 A comprehensive review of influenza in marine mammals is available. 20",

This virus may target the respiratory system as well as the GI tract, adrenal glands, and liver. Clinical signs may include nasal and ocular discharge, coughing, inflammation of the oral mucosa, vomiting, diarrhea, lethargy, anorexia, and fever. [43] [44] [45] In cetaceans, diverse alpha-and gammaherpesviruses have been reported. Delphinid herpesviruses 1 and 2, both alphaherpesviruses, have been associated with fatal necrosis of the spleen, thymus, and lymph nodes in bottlenose dolphins, with intranuclear inclusions present in affected tissues. 46 A harbor porpoise herpesviral encephalitis case was also likely to have been caused by an alphaherpesvirus. Delphinid herpesvirus 4, a gammaherpesvirus highly prevalent in bottlenose dolphins, is associated with plaque-like genital lesions, and gammaherpesviruses have been associated with similar lesions in other cetacean species. 38, 47, 48 significant diversity and may eventually be split into more than one species; morbilliviruses from the Northern Hemisphere [porpoise morbillivirus (PMV), dolphin morbillivirus (DMV), pilot whale morbillivirus (PWMV), and Longman's beaked whale morbillivirus (BWMV)] show significant divergence from CeMV from the Southern Hemisphere (from Swan River, Australia and from Brazil). Morbilliviruses have been recognized as causes of mass mortalities in pinnipeds and cetaceans since the early 1980s. Diagnosis in cetaceans is usually postmortem, but clinical signs include cachexia, abnormal mentation, and respiratory distress. In pinnipeds, clinical signs include respiratory distress, ocular and nasal discharge, pyrexia, and erratic swimming. Morbilliviruses infect via the signaling lymphocytic activation molecule (SLAM [CD150]) receptor, taking out memory T cells and leaving the host significantly immunosuppressed. Coinfection with other pathogens such as Aspergillus fumigatus or Brucella become more clinically significant. 23,24 Comprehensive reviews are available for both pinnipeds 22 and cetaceans. 23",

            "text": "Adenoviruses are medium-sized (70-90 nm) icosahedral, nonenveloped, double-stranded DNA viruses with intranuclear replication. In marine mammals, adenoviruses have been reported in pinnipeds, mustelids, and cetaceans. Adenoviruses have been associated with death in yearling California sea lions in rehabilitation; clinical signs included photophobia, emaciation, blood-tinged diarrhea, leukopenia, and monocytosis. 27 In 2011 California sea lion adenovirus 1 (CSLAdV-1) was characterized as a cause of viral hepatitis in wild animals and has since been detected in several pinniped species in captivity, especially in elder animals. 28-30 California sea lion adenovirus 2 and phocid adenoviruses 1 and 2 have been identified in ocular lesions and in unaffected eyes of pinnipeds. 31 In cetaceans, adenoviruses have been associated with gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms in bottlenose dolphins and harbor porpoises from Europe 32,33 and the United States. 34 Recently, a novel adenovirus with unknown clinical significance was found in Southern sea otters. 35 Diagnosis of adenoviral disease may be made with a combination of clinical branches of acquired immunity may be stimulated, this is not always the case, and it is certainly possible to have a negative antibody titer in an exposed animal with an acquired cellular immune response; for some agents this is common. Antibodies may also cross react to related viruses that have significantly different clinical implications. This is especially important in host taxa whose viral diversity is not yet well known, such as marine mammals. Development of an acquired immune response also requires time; it is often a week or more after infection before a response is seen. Finally, there are limitations on available reagents; many techniques require host-specific reagents to detect antibody responses. Although there may be cross reaction when using reagents from closely related hosts, this needs to be validated for each host species. 55 Methods for detection of virus rather than immune response include virus isolation, immunohistochemistry, and nucleic acid-based diagnostics. Virus isolation on cell cultures enables many other possible studies including experimental infections and construction of genetically modified viruses for vaccines or understanding of biology. However, culture conditions have not been determined for most marine mammal viruses. There are few available marine mammal cell lines, and when possible, culture is often comparatively very slow. Immunohistochemistry may detect viral proteins in tissue sections, but the availability of validated antibodies for specific detection of marine mammal viruses is very limited, and cross-reactivity concerns exist. In situ hybridization (ISH) is similar to immunohistochemistry but detects viral nucleic acids rather than viral proteins. The cost barriers to ISH assay development are significantly lower, and use of ISH is expanding. However, nucleic acids are much more badly damaged by formalin than proteins, and it is critical that tissues be processed into paraffin blocks rapidly and not remain in formalin for excessive periods of time.",

PCR primers may be designed to amplify only specific viruses or clades of related taxa. It is critical that a PCR product is identified properly; the most rigorous methods are product sequencing and probe hybridization. Sequencing will provide absolute identification of the product amplified; any assay using broad-range primers to identify clades of viruses needs to have a product sequence ID. Probe hybridization uses a labeled complementary nucleic acid strand that will bind very specifically to the expected product under correct salt and temperature conditions. This is currently most commonly done in probe hybridization quantitative PCR (qPCR, a.k.a. real-time PCR) assays, such as TaqMan assays. These assays require less time, are less expensive, and provide quantitative information about the amount of virus present. However, a properly designed and validated probe hybridization qPCR will identify only known target viruses and is not useful for identification of novel agents.

In marine mammals, papillomaviruses have been found in manatees, 49 cetaceans, 50 and pinnipeds. 51 Clinical signs include warty lesions in lingual and genital mucosa, as well as cutaneous lesions. The possibility of progression to neoplasia should be considered. Treatments against papillomaviruses in marine mammals have not been studied, but imiquimod and cidofovir have shown efficacy in other mammal models.
