With the same vaccine, the onset of protection was assessed after subcutaneous or intravenous vaccination of groups of dogs.

The decay rate of these passive antibodies is proportional to the growth rate of dogs (Fig. 1) .

Because the persistence of maternal antibodies is a well-known cause of vaccine failure, the recommended primary vaccination consists of two consecutive injections.

Canine parvovirus infection potentiates canine distemper encephalitis attributable to modified live virus vaccine (Krakowka et al., 1982) . A parallel can be drawn between the latter observation and epidemiological observations over the last fifteen years. In fact, before the emergence of canine parvovirus, distemper had largely disappeared from veterinary practice, whereas since 1980, it has not been exceptional to observe distemper, sometimes in the form of epidemics, and even in urban dog populations (Blixenkrone-Moller et al., 1993) . This can but lead us to continue promoting vaccination with the existing vaccines, even if improvements can still be made.",

If there is still scope for improving the Total protection 2 + no signs 5 --f CDV disease 3 + died epidemiological situation in the canine species by enhancing preventive medicine, then the principal tools used, the vaccines, could also be improved. It has been indicated above that attenuated vaccine strains have certain deficiencies as regards heat stability and specific safety for some immunodeficient puppies and for other wild carnivores. Furthermore, safer routes of administration than injection could be used, the oral route for instance, and more practical and more effective vaccination schedules could be developed, above all for combined vaccinations. One of the most promising approaches is that offered by new technologies, using recombinant vaccines. A variety of viruses have been used as carriers for heterologous genes inserted by recombinant DNA technology. Vaccinia virus has been most commonly used as a vector for foreign genes (Panicali and Paoletti, 1972) . Studies have been undertaken in recent years to evaluate the safety and suitability of vaccinia virus as an eukaryotic expression vector in different mammalian species including dogs ( Appel, 1988; Pastoret et al., 1992) . Because of its safety, efficacy, and heat-stability, the vaccinia-rabies recombinant offers an excellent alternative to the attenuated strains of rabies virus currently used in the field to achieve the immunization of foxes (Kieny et al., 1984) . The potency of the same recombinant ( vVRG) was demonstrated in the canine species (Chappuis et al., 1994) .",

Their total safety and excellent immunogenicity were demonstrated during vaccination/challenge trials (Tartaglia et al., 1972) . As an example, Table 2 shows recent results obtained in our laboratory using a CDV-Canary pox recombinant. The four vaccinated puppies received 2 injections of recombinant at a 3-week interval ( 10' PFU/dose) . Challenged six weeks after the first injection, they were totally protected after having developed an antibody response. Out of the seven challenge control puppies, five developed distemper and three died. These results are therefore highly encouraging and support other results obtained with other similar recombinants. This new approach offers the prospect of positive developments and further improvements in the control of canine distemper.",
