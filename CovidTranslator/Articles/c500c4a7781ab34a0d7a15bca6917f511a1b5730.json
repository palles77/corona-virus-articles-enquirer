In many of these patients, treatment can be postponed for several weeks or even months without negative oncologic impact. Therefore, time slots for therapy initiation in patients scheduled to undergo treatment, and in those presenting for the first time, were reviewed. Three \u00abelective\u00bb slots per week for treatment initiation were reserved and filled up continuously beginning mid-July. Restricting the number of treatment initiations ensured that not too many patients with a non-time-critical treatment would be \"on beam\" at the same time. Patients were advised to immediately initiate scheduled hormone and androgen deprivation therapy, when indicated. b) Over 70% of all patients with breast and primary prostate cancer were already receiving hypofractionated treatment prior to the 2019-nCoV outbreak, mostly according to the START-B trial for breast cancer 3 , and the CHHiP-trial for prostate cancer 4 ). In view of the impending outbreak, hypofractionated RT was employed whenever feasible, including implementation of a one-week partial breast RT schedule in suitable patients, following recent presentation of favorable long-term outcomes 5,6 . c) Patients with slow-growing asymptomatic tumors (e.g. WHO grade I meningiomas, vestibular schwannomas) were assigned treatment slots at a later time point. d) Palliative RT was delivered using short regimens whenever feasible, and single-fraction stereotactic body RT (SBRT) was considered for cases where a higher biologically effective dose (BED 10Gy ) was deemed necessary, such as in bone metastases with a mass effect and possible future complications. e) Provisions were made to reduce quality assurance (QA) measures as far as deemed reasonable and allowed according to the radiation protection regulation. Generally, patientspecific QA is performed using in vitro dosimetry for verification of intensity modulated RT (IMRT) treatment plans in each case. Once resources (staff, LINAC slots) become limited, only highly modulated plans will be checked, whereas this practice will be suspended for plans deemed to be of low risk for any inconsistencies, based on experience gathered in the past years, including the departmental critical incidence reporting system (CIRS).",

This included our treatment planning workflow, which involves contouring and dose prescription by the physician, plan calculation by a dosimetrist, joint plan adjustment and approval, followed by QA performed by a physicist. In our department, the first evident bottleneck was plan calculation with only two dosimetrists available. To counter this bottleneck, the following measures were taken: a) Trained physicists were involved more actively in the plan creation procedure as a backup plan in case of limited dosimetry staff. b) Remote access to the planning workstation was installed, allowing for one dosimetrist to plan from home (\u00abhome office\u00bb setting), subjecting him to a lower risk of infection, and potentially allowing for work during a quarantine setting.",

In our case, one week after the first departmental contingency plans had been developed, the hospital administration allocated 1.0 full time equivalent (FTE) physician of our department at the newly installed 2019-nCoV outpatient testing station. Another 0.5 FTE administrative worker was allocated the following week. This practice is scheduled to continue as the strain on the health care system intensifies and will require further adaptations on departmental workflows. b) Personnel supporting our department may become unavailable. Affected services may involve facility care, logistics, information & communications technology (ICT), and patient transportation. We plan to employ the department's administrative staff to carry out some of these tasks, should these services no longer be provided by the hospital. Other non-timecritical tasks currently covered by the administrative staff, such as billing, would have to be postponed until the situation improves. With academic sessions paused, the medical faculty has issued a call to medical students to assist in various supporting tasks; at the time of writing, over 100 students have answered the call. c) Certain procedures in brachytherapy may require (regional or general) anesthesia. Many of these indications are not time-critical, such as brachytherapy for prostate cancer, and can therefore be postponed. In our case, four patients with locally advanced cervical cancer are currently receiving external beam radiation therapy (EBRT), and are scheduled to undergo HDR-brachytherapy in the following weeks. As we expect resources for anesthesia to be limited, options for sedoanalgesia need to be discussed with patients and coordinated. As a last resort, delivery of increased doses using external-beam RT may be considered, although this is linked to less favorable outcomes 7",

One of the biggest challenges we envisioned was the eventuality of having patients on treatment testing positive for 2019-nCoV. For patients quarantined for (possible) 2019-nCoV infection, hospital regulations called for decontamination of the LINAC vault and patient transit areas in a lengthy procedure, which was not feasible between regular appointments. Rather, this appeared manageable only if a few patients were affected, as their treatment slots could be moved to the end of the day, followed by decontamination over night. The following measures were taken to mitigate the risks: a) Our department has the three vaults with identical, beam-matched LINACs. During normal operations, two or three LINACs are running, depending on patient workload. Having already carried out all necessary maintenance as a first step of our contingency plan, we were able to specify one LINAC vault that would be preserved for treatments of patients with a (possible) 2019-nCoV infection. b) Markings on the floor are used to highlight access ways to the designated vault and control room. These access ways are \u00aboff-limits\u00bb for non 2019-nCoV-affected patients as well as the LINAC team, and can be swiftly disinfected. c) Treatment slots between possible and confirmed 2019-nCoV cases need to be scheduled with ample time to allow disinfection. The order in which patients are treated depends on the likelihood of a 2019-nCoV infection, starting with the least probable and ending with the confirmed cases.",

French authorities shut down schools on 9 March, whereas Swiss and German authorities followed on 16 March. In anticipation, all coworkers with children had been asked how they planned to take care of their children if schools, kindergarten and daycare facilities were to close. A provisional plan was to convert a breakroom into an impromptu daycare facility for coworkers, although this idea was abandoned due to hospital regulations issued on 13 March not allowing visitors on hospital grounds.
