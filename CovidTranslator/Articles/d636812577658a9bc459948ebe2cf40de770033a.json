            "text": "Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a chronic and progressive fibrotic disease limited to the lung, with high variability in the course of disease from one patient to another. Patients with IPF may experience acute respiratory deteriorations; many of these acute declines are idiopathic and are termed acute exacerbations (AE) of IPF. In these cases, the exclusion of alternative causes of rapid deterioration, including heart failure, bilateral pneumonia or pulmonary embolism, is a challenging goal. AE may occur at any time during the course of IPF, although they are more common in patients with more progressive disease and gastroesophageal reflux. Surgical lung biopsy or even surgical procedures in organs other than the lungs may also trigger AE, mainly in rapidly progressive or advanced IPF. Current diagnostic criteria include the presence of newonset ground glass opacities or airspace consolidation superimposed on an underlying usual interstitial pneumonia pattern seen on high-resolution computed tomography. The outcome is poor with a short-term mortality in excess of 50 % despite therapy. Currently, there is no treatment with demonstrated efficacy for AE-IPF: empirical highdose corticosteroid therapy is generally used, with or without immunosuppressive agents, with limited evidence. On the other hand, there is hope that new treatments to slow down progression of IPF will translate into a reduction of AE-IPF's occurrence. In conclusion, although significant progress in assessing disease severity in IPF has been made, AEs remain unpredictable and are associated with a high risk of death. Improvements in our understanding of the etiology, risk factors, clinical predictors and epidemiology are needed. It is the goal of clinical researchers in the field to provide respiratory physicians with evidence-based guidance to identify patients who may benefit from therapy for preventing or treating AE-IPF.",

[11] observed in 9 % of the patients with AE-IPF the presence of common respiratory viral infection (parainfluenza, rhinovirus, coronavirus); conversely, no viruses were detected in the BAL from stable patients. Furthermore, pan-viral microarrays reveal additional evidence of viral infection [herpes simplex virus, Epstein-Barr virus and torque teno virus (TTV)], in patients with AE-IPF. TTV infections are significantly more common in patients with acute exacerbation than stable controls, but present in a similar percentage of disease controls with acute lung injury. Deep sequencing of a subset of acute exacerbation cases confirms the presence of TTV, but does not identify additional viruses.",

A recent study indicates that ambient air pollution may also cause AE-IPF, particularly by ozone and nitrogen dioxide [15] . Finally, some drugs may be responsible for the occurrence of AE-IPF, including biologic (anakinra, etanercept and infliximab) and nonbiologic (ambrisentan) agents and immunomodulatory (everolimus, interferon alpha and beta) and antineoplastic agents (both conventional chemotherapy and new drugs as tyrosine kinase inhibitors).

Data from the placebo arms of large clinical trials find an incidence of AE-IPF of 6-16 % over a period of 1 year [21] [22] [23] . The incidence is lower (2.3 %) in another trial [24] . In another randomized, controlled trial of anticoagulant therapy in IPF involving 56 patients followed for approximately 3 years, 32 (57 %) were re-hospitalized for AE-IPF, out of whom 53 % died [25] . Of note, subjects were initially enrolled in this study during an admission to the hospital, suggesting that the study population was enriched for prior episodes of AE-IPF or rapidly progressive disease. The incidence of AE-IPF may vary greatly with the severity of disease, the delay since the diagnosis of IPF, diagnostic criteria used and efforts made to rule out infection. This is illustrated by data from a recent highquality IPF trial, in which only about half the cases of acute deterioration suspected by investigators to be AE-IPF were eventually confirmed to be AE-IPF by an adjudication committee [23] .",

Nevertheless, somewhat comparable results were obtained in a retrospective review of an observational cohort of 147 patients with biopsy-proven IPF, with 11 meeting the criteria for AE-IPF [26] . The 2-year incidence of AEs is 9.6 %, and AE-IPF-related mortality is 78 %; the incidence of AE-IPF in this study with a biopsy-confirmed diagnosis of IPF may differ from those in which IPF was diagnosed without biopsy due to potential selection bias. The time from the first visit to the onset of AE-IPF ranges between 3 and 60 months. The retrospective design of this study may have underestimated the incidence rate, as 14 additional cases of acute worsening could not be included due to missing data. This south-Korean study suggests potential higher mortality in the Asian population compared to Caucasian patients, which might be linked to genetic susceptibility. Mortality may vary, however, with the diagnostic criteria used, the population studied, comorbidities, potential genetic factors and, most of all, the time at which mortality is assessed. Whether earlier diagnosis and management might improve outcome is unknown.",

Using a different approach, Martinez et al. [28] evaluated the clinical course of patients with mild to moderate IPF and found that an apparent acute clinical deterioration preceded death in 47 % of patients who died from IPF. Autopsy findings also show that AE are the most common immediate cause of death in patients with IPF [29] .

AE may occur at any time during the course of IPF, although they are more common in patients with more progressive disease such as those with decline in FVC at 6 months after baseline [30] . There is no clear association with age. A smoking history may protect from AE-IPF [27] , although AE-IPF appear to be more common in males [26] , but data are conflicting regarding smoking. In one study, a comparison of clinical features between IPF patients with and without AE-IPF shows no difference in age, smoking status, oxygenation and lung function at the time of diagnosis [26] . Ambient air pollution, particularly the increase in exposure to ozone and nitrogen dioxide emanating largely from motor vehicles, increases the risk of AE-IPF [15] . Pulmonary hypertension at the time of evaluation for lung transplantation increases the risk of subsequent AE in IPF, likely through endothelial dysfunction [31] . Data from several studies suggest seasonal variations in AE-IPF, with an increased frequency during winter months [32] [33] [34] . Patients with a history of AE-IPF have a higher risk of subsequent AE-IPF events [34] . Gastroesophageal reflux is also a risk factor for AE-IPF, as administration of proton pump inhibitors significantly reduces the incidence of AE-IPF [13] . Pepsin levels, a marker of gastric aspiration, are elevated in BAL fluid from patients during AE-IPF compared with those obtained in stable disease [12] . Symptomatic reflux may explain a higher risk of AE in patients with asymmetrical IPF [35] .",

Performing bronchoscopy and bronchoalveolar lavage can be useful to exclude other causes of acute respiratory failure, especially infection. It is often difficult or impossible to perform due to severe dyspnea or acute respiratory failure and does not yield the diagnosis of AE-IPF itself. Therefore, the benefit:risk balance of bronchoscopy must be carefully evaluated at an individual level.

In a double blind, randomized controlled trial evaluating pirfenidone versus placebo, AE-IPF events occurred exclusively in the placebo group, prompting early termination of the study [63] . The number of AE-IPF or time to clinical worsening including AE-IPF was not significantly different between patients receiving pirfenidone or placebo in phase III trials, although pirfenidone significantly reduced the decline in FVC over time and improved survival at 1 year [64] [65] [66] .

However, a small subset of patients might be eligible for lung transplantation, and in this case a more aggressive approach in the intensive care unit can be considered [83] . Interestingly, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) was able to be used successfully as a bridge to lung transplantation in 11 patients with acute respiratory failure refractory to all other interventions [84] . In this retrospective study, ECMO was used for a mean of 17 days (range 2-56 days); nine patients were transplanted, out of whom eight were alive 1 year after transplantation. Such encouraging experience highlights how organization of care and early inclusion on the transplant list of potential candidates are paramount to offer this potentially life-saving intervention in the event of AE-IPF.",

Biomarkers may contribute to various aspects of the disease course, including early diagnosis, assessment of rate of progression of disease, differentiation between infection and idiopathic disease or prediction of response to therapy. Improvement in our understanding of the etiology and epidemiology, preventative measures of potential risk factors and clinical predictors are needed. As some novel drugs especially tyrosine kinase inhibitors targeting the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) are associated with high risk of ILD exacerbation, clinicians should exert particular scrutiny when using them. A wide spectrum of new biological drugs is entering clinical practice in oncology; IPF correlates with an higher risk of developing cancer: whether the next antitumoral agents increase the risk of exacerbation is unknown. Continuous post-marketing surveillance is needed to detect potential effects of new drugs on the natural history of IPF. Acute exacerbations of IPF (and of other ILD) is one of the challenges in the years to come for doctors working with this difficult group of diseases. It is the goal of clinical researchers in the field to provide tools and possibly evidence-based guidance to identify therapies for preventing or treating AE-IPF.",
