When the node reaches the target node and transmits a message, the path could be guaranteed to be the shortest one with ample network bandwidth and buffer memory space.

In the wait phase, the message is transmitted to the target node via direct delivery to fulfill the transmission process if no available node could be found in the spray phase. This method is a modified algorithm that improves the flood transmission of the original Epidemic algorithm.
