The relevance of D-dimer could not be verified, as it is not included in routine laboratory tests. In this study, we have established a multivariable clinical prediction model using a development cohort of 299 patients from one hospital. After backwards selection, four variables, including age, lymphocyte count, lactate dehydrogenase and SpO2 remained in the model to predict mortality. This has been validated internally and externally with a cohort of 145 patients from a different hospital. Discrimination of the model was excellent in both internal (c=0\u00b789) and external (c=0\u00b798) validation. Calibration plots showed excellent agreement between predicted and observed probabilities of mortality after recalibration of the model to account for underlying differences in the risk profile of the datasets.

Nine variables commonly measured in these acute settings were considered for model development, including age, biomarkers and comorbidities. Backwards stepwise selection and bootstrap resampling were used for model development and internal validation. We assessed discrimination via the C statistic, and calibration using calibration-in-the-large, calibration slopes and plots. 4 demonstrated that the model is able to make reliable predictions in patients from different hospitals. In addition, these variables agree with pathological mechanisms and the model is easy to use in all types of clinical settings.",

Currently, very few reports propose reliable prediction models, which have been constructed using Transparent Reporting of a multivariable prediction model for Individual Prognosis Or Diagnosis (TRIPOD) guidance with internal and external validation 6 . One report based on a cohort of 191 COVID patients in early stages of the pandemic showed that age, Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score and D-dimer are independent risk factors of mortality 7 . However, D-dimer is not a routinely available clinical measurement and SOFA can be relatively low in COVID-19 patients on admission, but in the aforementioned report some patients in late stage of COVID-19 were transferred to its study hospitals 7 . This might explain the difference in SOFA scores.",

Variables were excluded if they had high collinearity with global scores. The number of predictors was restricted based on the total number of outcomes in the development dataset 10 .

At this stage in the global outbreak of COVID-19, no published studies have developed and validated prediction models for assessing the probability of mortality in hospitalized patients. A most recent report proposed SOFA score, age and Ddimers as the important prognostic markers 7 . However, in our cohorts, the SOFA score was very low although there is statistical difference between survivors and non-survivors. This difference may be due to some patients being treated in other hospitals prior to transfer in the previously reported study 7 . In addition, SOFA score relies on blood gas analysis, which cannot be easily done continually, in clinics and in under-resourced settings, thus making it difficult for clinicians to use readily. In addition, since D-dimer is not routinely requested, too many patients in our cohorts had no test performed, making it is difficult for us to verify published results. Organ-specific injury markers were not included in the model, including cTnI due to missing data (not routinely measured), as well as ALT and BUN due to high co-linearity with other variables within the model. Therefore, the choice of potential prognostic factors could not be informed by a systematic review of existing prediction models. Similarly, there are no published estimates of discrimination and calibration to compare this study to. Additionally, the event rate is limited, especially in the independent dataset where at least 100 events would be preferable 29 . A multicenter study with a larger cohort for model development and also for validation would add more power, reduce bias, and make the findings more generically applicable.",

Self-referred patients are more likely to have severe symptoms that cause them to seek emergency medical help. Likewise, other hospitals are more likely to test patients who have more pronounced symptoms, thus creating an inherent bias in the patient sample. Therefore, the cohort may not accurately represent patients with mild or asymptomatic COVID-19. These results need to be further validated with patients who are hospitalized for different severities of illness. In conclusion, traditional early warning scores and organ injury markers do not help to predict severity and mortality in patients with COVID-19. Here, we have developed and validated a clinical prediction model using readily available clinical markers which is able to accurately predict mortality in people with COVID-19. This model can therefore be used in current pandemic regions to identify patients who are at risk of severe disease at an early enough stage to initialize intensive supportive treatment and to guide discussions between clinicians, patients and families. It has the potential to be used throughout the world following additional validation .

Discrimination of the model was excellent in both internal (c=0\u00b789) and external (c=0\u00b798) validation. Internal calibration was excellent (calibration slope=1). External validation showed some over-prediction of risk in low-risk individuals and under-prediction of risk in high-risk individuals prior to recalibration. Recalibration of the intercept and slope led to excellent performance of the model in independent data. Interpretation: COVID-19 is a new disease and behaves differently from common critical illnesses. This study provides a new prediction model to identify patients with lethal COVID-19. Its practical reliance on commonly available parameters should improve usage of limited healthcare resources and patient survival rate.",

However, 155/299 and 69/145 patients in the development and validation cohorts died in the hospital, respectively. This poor outcome strongly indicates that these routine scoring systems used in general wards and ICU cannot accurately assess the severity and predict the mortality of patients with COVID-19. We have therefore used a hospitalized study population from Wuhan Tongji Hospital to develop a clinical prediction model using available demographic and clinical indicators. The most informative factors in COVID-19 positive patients were age, LDH, lymphocyte count and SpO2. The developed statistical model had good discrimination and minimal model optimism. In external validation using an independent cohort from Jinyintan hospital, the model had excellent discrimination but needed recalibrating to account for the different underlying risk profile in the independent dataset. Specifically, the development and validation cohorts are temporally distinct as the validation cohort were from earlier in the COVID-19 outbreak. In addition, they are from different sites within Wuhan and the demographics are distinct, with patients admitted to the Jinyintan hospital being younger with a male majority and less patients with hypertension and low SOFA scores (1.0 [0-3] vs 2.0 [2.0-4.0].

With the vivid nomogram, this model will enable the majority of clinicians to assess the severity of patient illness without difficulty, particular in very busy clinical settings. We were also able to externally validate our model in an independent dataset. The discrimination of the model was high in both internal and external validation showing that the model is able to accurately differentiate high and low risk individuals. The prediction models are based on and validated in Chinese hospitalized COVID-19 positive populations and should therefore be applicable to other sites within China and may also be translatable into other sites during the global outbreak. However, separate validation will be required in other patient populations before widespread application.",
