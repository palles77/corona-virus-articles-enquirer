Due to the cytoplasmic replication of Paramyxoviruses, the viral-encoded RNAdependent RNA polymerase (RdRP) is thought to possess all activities required for mRNA capping and methylation. In the present work, using partially purified recombinant RNA polymerase complex of rinderpest virus expressed in insect cells, we demonstrate the in vitro methylation of capped mRNA. Further, we show that a recombinant C-terminal fragment (1717-2183 aa) of L protein is capable of methylating capped mRNA, suggesting that the various post-transcriptional activities of the L protein are located in independently folding domains.",

            "text": "Paramyxoviruses constitute a group of viruses with single-stranded negative sense RNA genome that includes potential pathogens to humans and domestic live stocks. The viral genome consists of a *16 kb long negative sense RNA encapsidated by nucleocapsid protein (N-RNA). Transcription of viral N-RNA occurs in an orderly fashion from the 3 0 end of N-RNA; 3 0 -le-N-P-M-F-H-L-tr-5 0 . Excluding the 52 nt 3 0 leader RNA, all the other mRNAs are capped and methylated similar to cellular mRNA. Viruses of this family replicate inside the cytoplasm of the infected cells and hence, are not dependent on the host enzymes located in the nucleus for the post-transcriptional modification of viral mRNA. During transcription, the viral mRNAs are capped similar to the cellular mRNA, although the extent of methylation differs within the viruses belonging to this family. The direct evidence for the belief that the large protein L of Paramyxoviruses is responsible for mRNA synthesis, capping and cap methylation came from the work of Ogino et al. [12] who showed that the recombinant L protein of Sendai virus possesses guanine-7methyl transferase activity located within the C-terminal part of L protein. Multiple sequence alignment and secondary sequence analysis predicted the presence of 2 0 -O-methyl transferase domain in C-terminal domain of L protein of mononegavirale [6] . Rinderpest virus (RPV) is an important member of the Morbillivirus genus, in the Paramyxoviridae family. We have earlier shown that in RPV-infected cells, the viral mRNA is capped and has both cap 0 and cap 1 structures [8] . In addition, we also demonstrated the guanylyl transferase activity of L protein in vitro. In the same study, domain mapping revealed the ability of a truncated L protein (LD3-aa 1717-2183) to catalyse the first step of guanylyl transferase activity; vis-a-vis formation of a covalent complex with GMP. In the present work, we present evidence for N 7 guanine methyl transferase activity of RPV L protein and further demonstrate that this activity is localized to aa 1717-2183 of L protein indicating the modular nature of the RdRP.",

In agreement, putative 2 0 -O-methyl transferase (MTase) motif was predicted within domain VI (1753-1830 aa) of L proteins [1] . In another report, a structural homology-based comparison was carried out between bacterial 2 0 -O-MTase, Rrmj and the region spanning 1644-1842 aa of VSV L protein, and further mutational analysis revealed the importance of this region in viral mRNA transcription as well as methylation [6] . However, recent evidences point out the importance of regions in domain II of VSV L protein in both cap 0 and cap 1 methylation [9] .",

In support of this observation, Ogino et al. [12] have shown that Sendai virus L protein deletion mutant spanning the domain III alone (aa 1756-2228) catalyses cap 0 methyl transferase activity, while inclusion of a portion of domain II (aa 1121-2228) resulted in significantly higher activity. These results suggest that in paramyxovirus L protein (compared to rhabdo viruses), the catalytic module for cap 0 methyl transferase activity resides in domain III, and domain II may have additional role of stabilizing the enzyme or increase the catalytic efficiency.",

Although the RPV L protein was found to possess the KDKE motif, the catalytic motif for 2 0 -O-methyl transferases, the generation of Cap 1 (7 m GpppA m ) product could not be seen. One likely reason could be that the presence of cap 0 is a mandatory prerequisite for RPV L protein to generate cap 1 structures. In support of this, coronavirus nonstructural protein 16 was found to exhibit 2 0 -O-methyl transferase activity only on N 7 GpppA substrate RNA, while Flavivirus NS5 methyl transferase can catalyse the methylation of both GpppA and N7GpppA substrates [2, 4] . Alternatively, lack of domain II may render domain III catalytically inactive with respect to 2 0 -O-methylation [9] . Hence, it would be interesting to speculate that RPV L protein may also require specific N 7 GpppA substrate RNA to exhibit 2 0 -O-methyl transferase activity although further experiments are needed to confirm this hypothesis.",
