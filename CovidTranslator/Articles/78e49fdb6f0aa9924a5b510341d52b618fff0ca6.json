            "text": "The respiratory syndrome caused by a new type of coronavirus has been emerging from 2 China and caused more than 1000 death globally since December 2019. This new virus, 3 called 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) uses the same receptor called Angiotensin-4 converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) to attack humans as the coronavirus that caused the severe 5 acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) seventeen years ago. Both viruses recognize ACE2 6 through the spike proteins (S-protein) on their surfaces. It was found that the S-protein 7 from the SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) bind stronger to ACE2 than 2019-nCoV. 8 However, function of a bio-system is often under kinetic, rather than thermodynamic, 9 control. To address this issue, we constructed a structural model for complex formed 10 between ACE2 and the S-protein from 2019-nCoV, so that the rate of their association 11 can be estimated and compared with the binding of S-protein from SARS-CoV by a 12 multiscale simulation method. Our simulation results suggest that the association of new 13 virus to the receptor is slower than SARS, which is consistent with the experimental data 14 obtained very recently. We further integrated this difference of association rate between 15 virus and receptor into a mathematical model which describes the life cycle of virus in 16 host cells and its interplay with the innate immune system. Interestingly, we found that 17 the slower association between virus and receptor can result in longer incubation period, 18 while still maintaining a relatively higher level of viral concentration in human body. Our 19 computational study therefore provides, from the molecular level, one possible 20 explanation that the new disease by far spread much faster than SARS. 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 author/funder.

            "text": "The coronavirus disease 2019 has emerged at the end of year 2019 2 from Wuhan, a city in China, as a new infectious disease [1, 2] . It has been found that the replicated RNA genome and synthesized viral proteins are finally assembled together into 10 new viruses, before they escape and attack other cells [7, 8] . As a result, the infections of 11 2019-nCoV normally come with the similar symptoms as SARS, including fever, 12 respiratory difficulty and pneumonia [9, 10] . Different from SARS, however, the new 13 COVID-19 seems to have longer incubation period and thus is more contagious [11] . The 14 disease has caused more than 70,000 confirmed cases with at least 1000 death globally, 15 according to the data from the World Health Organization (WHO) on February 16 th 2020. 16 Therefore, the development of vaccine or therapeutic treatment for this ongoing public 17 health crisis is highly demanding [12, 13] . 18 Almost all the coronaviruses recognize their host cells through spike (S) proteins 19 [14, 15] . S-protein is a glycoprotein expressed on the surface of viral envelop as homo-20 trimers [16] . Each S-protein further consists of two subunits. The S1 subunit includes a 21 region called receptor-binding domain (RBD) which is used to target receptors in host 22 cells, while the S2 subunit regulates the membrane fusion between virus and host cells 23 [17] . These roles of S protein suggest that it could be a key target for vaccine and 24 therapeutics developed to neutralize virus infection by blocking their invasion [18] . 25 Moreover, it has been confirmed in a recent report that the new virus 2019-nCoV uses the 26 same cell entry receptor ACE2 as SARS coronavirus [19] . The atomic structures of 27 complex between human ACE2 and the RBD regions from S-protein of SARS-CoV have 28 been obtained by x-ray crystallography [17] . It was also shown that the sequence of S-29 protein from SARS-CoV shares more than 70% identity with the S-protein from 2019-30 author/funder. All rights reserved.

The area of the square is 1 \u00b5m 2 , while the 2 height of the simulation box is 500 nm. A number of ACE2 receptors (200) are initially 3 placed on the membrane surface (pink in Figure 1a ). They are represented by rigid 4 bodies of cylinders and their binding sites are located on top of the cylinders (red dots in 5 Figure 1a ). The height of each cylinder is 10nm and its radius is 5nm. On the other hand, 6 space above the plasma membrane represents the extracellular region. A number of 7 coronaviruses are located in this area (golden in Figure 1a) . Each virus is simplified as a 8 spherical rigid body with a given radius (40nm). Trimeric S-proteins are uniformly 9 distributed on the spherical surface of each virus (green dots in Figure 1a ). Each S-10 protein can interact with an ACE2 receptor on plasma membrane. After any S-protein on 11 one virus forms an encounter complex with a receptor, we assume that the host cell is 12 captured by the virus. The dissociation between the virus and the receptor is not 13 considered in the system, because we also assume that, after the association between S-14 protein and ACE2, the virus can enter the cell through membrane fusion. Following the 15 initial random configuration, the diffusion of receptors and viruses, as well as their 16 association, were simulated by a diffusion-reaction algorithm until the system reached 17 equilibrium. The detail process of the simulation is specified in the Methods. 18 Before the rigid-body simulation, in order to provide a more realistic estimation 19 on the binding between ACE2 and different coronaviruses, we specifically compared the 20 S-protein from 2019-nCoV with the S-protein from SARS. We applied our previously 21 developed residue-based kinetic Monte-Carlo (KMC) method to simulate the associate 22 processes of these two systems. In detail, the atomic coordinates of the complex between The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi.org/10. 1101 the distance between their binding interfaces is fallen within a given cutoff value d c of 20 1 \u00c5. At the end of each trajectory, receptor and viral protein either form an encounter 2 complex through their binding interface observed in the complex structure, or diffuse 3 away from each other. Based on the simulation results collected from all the 500 4 trajectories, we counted how many times an encounter complex can be formed by the end 5 of the simulation time, which gives the probability of association. As a result, the 6 comparison of calculated probabilities of association for both systems is plotted in Figure   7 2a. 8 The figure shows that probability of association between ACE2 and the S-protein 9 from 2019-nCoV is remarkably lower than the probability of association between ACE2 10 and the S-protein from SARS. Specifically, among the 500 simulation trajectories of which is quantitatively consistent with our simulation results. 23 We then fed the information derived from the structure-based simulations into the 24 rigid-body model. Two specific simulation systems were compared. A relatively fast rate 25 of association between receptors and S-proteins on viral surfaces was adopted in the first 26 system to represent the binding process of SARS, while a relatively slow rate of 27 association between receptors and S-proteins on viral surfaces was adopted in the second 28 system to represent the binding process of 2019-nCoV. All the other parameters such as 29 diffusion constants and concentrations in both systems remain the same. As a result, the 30 author/funder. All rights reserved.

Without surprise, the figure shows that although almost all 2 viruses were attached to the cell surfaces by the end of both simulations, the kinetic 3 process in the SARS system is much faster than the 2019-nCoV system, which is resulted 4 from the difference in the association rate between receptors and their corresponding S-5 proteins. This leads into the fact that during the early stage of simulations, more SARS 6 viruses attach to host cells than 2019-nCoV. For instance, when the simulations in both 7 systems reached the first 10 5 nanoseconds, there have already been more than 40 SARS 8 viruses attached to the cell surfaces. In contrast, there were less than 20 viruses attached 9 to the cell surfaces within the same amount of time in the 2019-nCoV system.",

Altogether, we solved above ODEs numerically by a stochastic simulation 10 algorithm. The brief introduction of the simulation algorithm will be specified in the 11 Methods. 12 Given predefined weights for all the simulation parameters and the initial values 13 for each element, the dynamics of the system is evolved as a function of time. The 14 simulation results of the mathematical model are summarized in Figure 4. As shown by 15 the red curve in Figure 4a, the change of free virus in the system can be divided into 16 three stages. It first decreases from its initial value. After reaching the minimal level, the 17 number of virus then bounces back in the second phase until it drops again and finally 18 vanishes at the end of the third phase. Relative to the free virus, the number of virus 19 captured by host cells equals 0 at the beginning of the simulation. It increases in the first 20 stage and diminishes in the second, as shown by the blue curve in the figure. In the third 21 phase, very few viruses bound to host cells are detected in the system. Corresponding to 22 the change of virus, the number of healthy cells is plotted as the black curve. The curve 23 shows that the level of healthy cells reduces from the beginning and rises only after all 24 free viruses are removed from the systems. Based on these kinetic profiles, the dynamics 25 of the system can thus be interpreted as follows. In the first stage of simulation, free 26 viruses invade into the healthy cells by binding to the receptors on their surface. We 27 suggest that this stage corresponds to the incubation period. In the second stage, new 28 viruses are assembled in and released from the infected cells. At the same moment, the 29 viral genomes left in the infected cells stimulate the immune response. As a result, the 30 total amount of virus is gradually lowered in the third phase, indicating that these viruses 31 author/funder. All rights reserved. No reuse allowed without permission.",

The figure suggests 12 that the first stage in the simulation of 2019-nCoV (red curve) is longer than the 13 simulation of SARS (black curve). This is consistent with the clinical observation that the 14 incubation period of COVID-19 could be as long as 14 days, while the incubation period 15 is normally from 2 to 7 days. More interestingly, we found that the level of free virus at 16 the end of the first period in the simulation of 2019-nCoV is relatively higher than the 17 corresponding level of free virus in the simulation of SARS. Considering that a patient 18 can contain a higher level of new coronavirus during his or her incubation period which 19 is also longer than SARS, our simulation gives the insights about why COVID-19 is more 20 contagious and spread faster than SARS [11]. Finally, when both simulations came to 21 their third phases, we found that the total amount of virus of SARS is higher than 2019-22 nCoV. This gives possible explanation about why the symptoms in most COVID-19 23 patients are relatively mild and not as severe as the symptoms in SARS patients [35]. 24 In summary, it is important to point out that the life cycles of different 25 coronaviruses can also be caused by many other factors such as the difference in the 26 assembling pathways of these viruses. Additionally, the infectious response of each 27 individual is also a case-dependent issue, relying on the expression levels of ACE2 28 receptors and the heterogeneity of immune response in different patients.

It 11 has been found that the kinetic aspect of binding between biomolecules in many 12 biological systems is usually more important to their functions.

Consistent with 16 the experimental data obtained very recently, we found association of the new virus to the 17 receptor is slower than SARS. We further interrogate the impact of this result on the 18 difference in viral life cycle between SARS and COVID-19. By incorporating the 19 information derived from coarse-grained simulations into a mathematical model, we 20 found that the slower association between 2019-nCoV and ACE2 can result in longer 21 incubation period, while still maintaining a relatively higher level of viral concentration 22 in human body.
