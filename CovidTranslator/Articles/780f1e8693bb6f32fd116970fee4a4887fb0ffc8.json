In addition, the system was also designed to deal with the variability in age and gender, which would affect the accuracy of the detection. Furthermore, to enable a low-cost, non-contact and embedded system, multiple vital signs from a medical radar were measured and all algorithms were implemented on a Field Programmable Gate Array, named PYNQ-Z1. Methods: The system consisted of two main stages: digital signal processing and data classification. In the former stage, Butterworth filters, with flexible cut-off frequencies depending on age and gender, and a time-domain peak detection algorithm were deployed to compute three vital signs, namely heart rate, respiratory rate, and standard deviation of heart beat-to-beat interval. For the classification problem, two machine learning models, Support Vector Machine and Quadratic Discriminant Analysis, were implemented. Results: The Student's t-test showed that our proposed digital signal processing algorithms coped well with the variability of human cases in age and gender. Meanwhile, the f 1 -score of roughly 98.0% represented the high sensitivity and specificity of our proposed machine learning methods. Conclusion: This study outlines the implementation of an infection screening system, which achieved competent performance. The system might be beneficial for fast screening of infected patients at public health centers in underdeveloped areas, where people have little access to healthcare.",

Our previous studies were conducted focusing on the noncontact dengue fever detecting systems based on multiple vital signs using medical radar and thermography. For example, [4] [5] [6] [7] developed methods that processed the recorded signal to obtain heart rate (HR) and respiratory rate (RR) by built-in algorithms, namely Autocorrelation, Fast Fourier transform (FFT) and Multiple Signal Classification (MUSIC), on computer software. However, those research studies used built-in algorithms with fixed parameters regardless of the age and sex of subjects, which could reduce the accuracy of the system. Regarding the task of discriminating patients with infectious diseases, [6] employed the Linear Discriminant Analysis method on a small dataset of 18 samples, which achieved an indifferent accuracy level of 88.9%. Moreover, [8] [9] [10] employed sophisticated methods using Neural Networks. However, this approach required high computational complexity to train the Neural Network, partly because it was susceptible to the variability in age and gender.",

            "text": "In this study, several signal processing and machine learning classification algorithms were employed to improve the performance of both tasks. To measure vital signs, a Digital Butterworth filter [11] and a simple time-domain peak detection algorithm were deployed to process the signal acquired from medical radar. To deal with the variability in HR [12] and RR [13, 14] depending on age and gender, instead of the inflexible methods used in Refs. [4] [5] [6] [7] , filters with flexible cut-off frequencies were designed in this work. For the classification problem, two machine learning models, namely Support Vector Machine (SVM) [15] and Quadratic Discriminant Analysis (QDA) [16] were used, with a far larger dataset of 101 samples, than the 18-sample dataset in Ref. [6] , to increase the classification accuracy. Moreover, those algorithms were implemented on a Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA), since one of the long range objectives of this study is to enable a low-cost, portable, and standalone system, which would be beneficial for public health centers in underdeveloped areas, where people have little access to healthcare, thus they have higher risks of succumbing to infectious diseases. FPGAs have been widely used for multiple signal processing problems, especially filtering [17, 18] , due to their flexible and reconfigurable structure. Moreover, research focusing on FPGA implementations of machine-learning problems, such as classification, has been thriving in recent years [19] [20] [21] , since the flexibility, parallelism and energy-efficiency of FPGAs are beneficial for accelerating complicated work. In this study, the FPGA called PYNQ-Z1 was employed to implement all signal processing and classification algorithms.",

At the hardware level, programmable logic circuits of the FPGA are presented as libraries called overlays. These overlays are analogous to software libraries and can be accessed through an application programming interface (API). On the other hand, regarding the software level, a high-level programming language, Python, with the Jupyter Notebook design environment [23] , as well as the kernels of the Linux operating system, can be deployed for high performance embedded application. The PYNQ-Z1 board combines all of the above elements of both software and hardware levels to simplify and improve APSoC design.",

Specifically, the software level of the board enabled the implementations of all algorithms in Python for both the signal processing and classification tasks. Instead of inflexible built-in algorithms on computer software [4] [5] [6] [7] , flexible digital filters were designed to process the radar signal. The filters were designed with SciPy [24] , a Python library for mathematics, science, and engineering. In addition, SVM and QDA classifiers could also supplant complicated Neural Networks [8] [9] [10] deployed on bulky and expensive computers or workstations. The two classifiers were implemented on the board using scikit-learn [25] , a framework supporting many machine learning algorithms. Fig. 2 provides overall information about the system. The medical radar (NJR 4262J, Japan), which has the frequency range from 24.05 to 24.25 GHz transmitted microwave to the person's chest and received the reflected wave, which contained both the cardiac and respiratory frequency components due to the Doppler effect [6] . The signal was monitored for 30 seconds, then it was transferred to the board for processing.",

To make a reliable assessment about the robustness of a classifier, especially when shuffling the dataset before splitting, the 4-fold cross validation was conducted 10 times repeatedly to obtain the average and standard deviation (STD) of evaluation metrics. However, the cross-validation method was not used to measure the training and testing time of the two classifiers, since this method reduced the size of the dataset used for training. Instead, the entire dataset containing the 3 vital signs of 101 objects was used for training, and only one test case was used for testing. . 4 illustrates the results of the digital signal processing stage and how the three vital signs were computed. In the second subplot, through the band-pass filter, all of the high-frequency noise and respiratory information in the original signal were eliminated, to produce the HR from the extracted cardiac frequency component. The third subplot illustrates the waveform of a reference cardiac signal, monitored by the PPG sensor simultaneously with the radar signal. Meanwhile, the fourth subplot shows the low-pass filtered signal, which contains information to calculate the RR. All red dots represent the peaks detected in the two signals after filtering, by applying Algorithm 1. Then using (4), (5) and (8) , with the measuring time t m \u00bc 30s, 32 peaks in the cardiac, and 8 peaks in the respiratory filtered signals, the 3 vital signs were obtained:",

Tables 2 and 3 show that the performance of our proposed filtering method should be superior to the three methods, since [6] employed those three as rigid built-in algorithms, with fixed parameters, which were more susceptible to the variability of human cases. Table 4 compares the 3 signal processing phases in terms of the average amount of time taken to obtain the three vital signs from a signal recorded in 30 seconds by the medical radar. It is evident that the peakdetecting process accounted for by far the highest amount, approximately 80% of the total. Meanwhile, since the calculation of HR and SDHI require two same steps of band-pass filtering and peak detecting, the gross processing time of both the two features was reduced to approximately 35.87 ms. In total, the signal processing stage on the board took about 70 ms. Fig. 5 visualizes pairs of the 3 vital signs HR, SDHI, and RR calculated from the signal processing stage, of all healthy and infected people included in our research study.

In contrast, the SVM required 403 ms for training the model, nearly 90 times as high as the training time of the QDA. It was probably because the SVM includes an iterative procedure to solve the constrained optimization problem, whereas training the QDA classifier only requires a fixed number of steps for basic matrix operations.
