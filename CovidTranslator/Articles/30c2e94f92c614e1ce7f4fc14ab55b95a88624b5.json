By the 11th book edition in 1994, 2 the X-linked catalog had been joined by two other chromosome-specific catalogs: those for the Y chromosome and for the mitochondrial chromosome. Entries in the original autosomal dominant, autosomal recessive, and X-linked catalogs had been assigned unique identification numbers, beginning with 1, 2, and 3, respectively. Entries in the two new chromosome-specific catalogs were given unique numbers beginning with 4 (Y-linked) and 5 (mitochondrial). (Entries were given 4-digit numbers in the first [1966] and second [1968] book editions of MIM. Entry numbers were expanded to 5 digits with the third [1975] edition by adding a zero to the 4-digit numbers of previously existing entries and to 6 digits in the 9th [1990] edition by the same method.)",

Also, the distinction is only relative-that is, whether dominant or recessive sometimes depends on the level at which the phe- notype is analyzed. For example, in several of the red-cell enzymopathies, the deficiency state is autosomal recessive but the electrophoretic variation is likely to be demonstrable in the heterozygote-that is, it is dominant, or at least intermediate, in its inheritance. Furthermore, there are rather numerous examples of particular phenotypes that are inherited as dominant or recessive based on different mutations in the same gene. Table 15 on page l in the preface of MIM12 2 listed 11 disorders that have both dominant and recessive forms resulting from different mutations in the same gene. Some mutations that cause absent function of the protein-that is, null mutationsproduce phenotypic effects only with homozygosity; missense mutations may cause the disorder because of a dominant negative effect when, for example, the structure of a protein that is part of a heteromeric protein complex is altered.",

The method of interspecific (e.g., mouse-human) somatic cell hybridization made it possible to map genes to specific human chromosomes without the existence of a Mendelizing phenotype that could be used in family linkage studies. The difference between the genomes of the two species in the hybrid substituted for the differences between the genomes inherited from father and mother used in family linkage mapping. Thus, when the thymidine kinase gene (TK1 [MIM *188300]) was mapped to chromosome 17 by study of mouse-human hybrid cell lines, 13, 14 an entry was created for the gene, even though no Mendelian variation was known. Already, separate entries had been created for hemoglobin genes such as HBB, the lactate dehydrogenase genes such as LDHA (MIM \u03e9150000), and the G6PD gene (MIM \u03e9305900), among others. As mapping and cloning of genes advanced, the genes involved were given new entries in MIM, again although no Mendelian variation may have been known. Until the generic autosomal catalog was established (in 1994), autosomal \"gene entries\" were arbitrarily incorporated in the autosomal dominant catalog.",

By the fall of 1985, an online version of MIM, now called \"OMIM,\" with the IRx search engine became a major aid in authoring and editing OMIM. Searchability helped to avoid duplications and inconsistencies and allowed entries to be related to each other-cross-referenced-more easily. Beginning in September 1987, OMIM was made generally accessible on the Internet from the Welch Medical Library of Johns Hopkins University. The informatics aspects of OMIM were transferred to the NCBI of the National Library of Medicine on December 1, 1995. Thus, in the 31 years from 1964 to 1995, MIM went from a solitary resource on magnetic tape to a cornerstone genetics resource on the World Wide Web, integrated with other primary genetic data sources. OMIM was one of the first electronic resources to exploit the advantages of the Web.",

Indeed, nosology and nosography, viewed as the delineation of distinct genetic traits, are the main bases for assembling MIM. The basic premise has been that \"Mendelization\" indicates that the phenotype represents a distinct disorder or trait related to a specific mutation in a specific gene and deserves a specific name. In his monograph entitled Nosography, 17 which was published in 1930, Knut Faber, Copenhagen professor of medicine, attributed to Mendel a major, albeit indirect, role in guiding thinking along lines of specific disease entities with specific etiology (causation), comparable to the role played by the pioneers in bacteriology in the late 1800s and early 1900s. Two hundred years ago, angina pectoris, asthma, consumption, dropsy, jaundice, stroke, and many symptom complexes were viewed and managed as though they were distinct entities with a single etiology.",

The question brought out debates between \"lumpers\" and \"splitters.\" 19, 20 The lumper and splitter controversies have often been resolved only by molecular elucidation at the DNA level. It turned out that both the lumpers and the splitters were in part correct. Molecular elucidation revealed numerous instances of \"many from one\" (multiple phenotypes from different mutations in the same gene) and \"one from many\" (the same phenotype from mutations in two or more separate genes).",

See, for example, the several forms of long QT syndrome: LQT1 (MIM #192500), LQT2 (MIM \u03e9152427), LQT3 (MIM #603830), LQT4 (MIM #600919), LQT5 (MIM \u03e9176261), LQT6 (MIM \u03e9603796), and LQT7 (MIM #170390).

Additionally, treatment of the disorder may be found to be specific to the underlying genetic basis. \"Many from one,\" different phenotypes with different mutations in the same gene, is illustrated by many examples. The multiple disorders resulting from mutations in HBB, a total of at least seven, represents an early example. The multiple disorders resulting from mutations in the lamin A/C gene (LMNA [MIM *150330])-a total of at least 11, varying from progeria (MIM #176670) to a form of Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (MIM #605588)-provide an impressive recent example.",

However, often, over time, a constellation of features was found to be more important to clinical diagnosis than was a single feature. Partly for this reason, eponymic designations have been used heavily and have much to recommend them. They have the advantage of conveying no preconceived notion as to the basic nature of the abnormality. \"Hurler syndrome\" was, time showed, a better designation than was \"lipochondrodystrophy,\" which Index Medicus continued to use long after the fundamental fault was found to concern mucopolysaccharides, not lipid. The eponym is merely a \"handle.\" Often the person whose name is used was not the first to describe the disorder or did not describe the full syndrome as it subsequently came to be known.

The list of traits, most of them disorders or diseases, was compared to a photographic negative from which a positive picture of the genetic constitution of the X chromosome could be derived. Although the second catalog, that for autosomal recessive traits, was assembled for utilitarian purposes-that is, as a resource in the identification of new recessive diseases in inbred groups such as the Amish-the \"gene behind the phene\" was always in mind, and no more than one entry per gene was wittingly made from the beginning of MIM in the 1960s.

Schmickel's concept of contiguous gene-deletion syndromes 45 Reciprocal X-autosome translocations have been important for finding the chromosomal location of genes determining X-linked disorders (and the nature of those genes). Sporadic cases of an X-linked recessive disorder in a female with such a translocation was sometimes not only the main or even the only evidence that the gene was on the X chromosome, but also the breakpoint on X indicated the precise location of the gene. In females with an Xautosome translocation, the derivative X chromosome (the derivative chromosome with the centromere of the X) is active in all cells; if the derivative X chromosome were inactive (lyonized), its autosomal component would likewise be inactive, with cell-lethal effects due to autosomal monosomy. Thus, the normal X chromosome is the inactive one, and the derivative X-which may have disruption of the gene at the breakpoint-is the active one. The breakpoint, therefore, marks the site of the gene responsible for the disorder in the patient. Duchenne muscular dystrophy was among the first disorders to be mapped by this method; table 1 in the preface of MIM12 (1998) tabulated 16 other examples. 2 De novo reciprocal autosomal translocations also can provide information on the chromosomal site of autosomal Mendelian disorders or specific autosomal genes. Single cases of de novo autosome-autosome translocation are less informative than are single cases of X-autosome translocation, because either autosome can be the site of the gene disrupted by the chromosome break, or perhaps the phenotype may be the result of a fusion gene-for example, a joining of the promoter region of one gene and the coding region of the other. The occurrence of two or more reciprocal translocations that involve the same chromosome as one of the partners and involve the same chromosome band establishes the site of the gene of interest. For example, in the case of type II (ankyrin-related) hereditary spherocytosis (MIM \u03e9182900), the disorder was mapped to 8p by the discovery of a family with an apparently balanced translocation between chromosomes 8 and 12 46, 47 and another between chromosomes 3 and 8 48 ; in each family, spherocytosis segregated with the balanced translocation, and the break in 8p was at the same site.",

It has been suggested 54 that the extraordinary copy-number polymorphism of the complement component-4 (C4A [MIM \u03e9120810]) may be related to defense against infectious disease and susceptibility to autoimmune disease. Similarly, it is thought 55 that an increased copy number of the trypsinogen-1 gene (PRSS1 [MIM \u03e9276000]) may account for some of the families with hereditary pancreatitis without a known causative mutation in that gene. The beta-defensin genes (e.g., MIM *602215), clustered on 8p2.1, vary in copy number from 2 to 12. Low copy number is associated with susceptibility to Crohn disease (MIM #266600). The CCL3L1 gene (MIM *601395), which occurs in variable copy number (1) (2) (3) (4) (5) (6) (7) (8) (9) (10) , shows an association of copy number with susceptibility to HIV/AIDS (MIM #609423). 56 Copy-number variation of the orthologous rat and human FCGR3B gene (MIM *610665) is a determinant of susceptibility to immunologically mediated glomerulonephritis; low copy number was found to be associated with glomerulonephritis in systemic lupus erythematosus (MIM #152700). 57 Gene duplication is a well-known basis of Mendelian disorders. Most cases of Pelizaeus-Merzbacher disease (MIM #312080) are caused by duplication of the PLP1 gene (MIM *300401). In many instances, Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 1a (MIM #118210), another disorder of myelination, is caused by duplication of the gene encoding peripheral myelin protein-22 (PMP22 [MIM *601097]). Gene duplication is sometimes the cause of disease in a small but nonetheless instructive subsets of patients, including patients with CHARGE syndrome (MIM #214800) caused by duplication in the CHD7 gene (MIM *608892), 58 ",

One of the earliest susceptibility alleles to be identified was that related to Alzheimer disease (MIM #104310), the APOE4 variant of apolipoprotein E (Cys112Arg [MIM \u03e9107741.0016]). 69, 70 In many cases, more than one common disorder is related to the same polymorphic allele. In such cases, which common disorder results is thought to depend on the rest of the genetic constitution of the individual and particular environmental circumstances. The different disorders related to a particular susceptibility allele sometimes have obvious possible connections, as in the case of different forms of autoimmune disorders. Even in different indi-viduals in the same family, the predisposition conveyed by the susceptibility allele may take the form of different common disorders. These considerations are the basis of Becker's common alleles/multiple common disorders model of the genetics of common disease. 71 Several different types of autoimmune disease (MIM #109100) have been found to be associated with particular susceptibility alleles, even in the same family. For example, the Arg620Trp polymorphism of the PTPN22 gene (MIM *600716.0001) has been identified as a susceptibility allele in insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, and Hashimoto thyroiditis. The insertion/deletion polymorphism of angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE [MIM \u03e9106180.0001]) has been identified as a susceptibility allele for myocardial infarction, diabetic nephropathy, hemorrhagic stroke, ischemic stroke, and progression of severe acute respiratory syndrome. In addition, the indel polymorphism of ACE appears to be a QTL for stature. The Val66Met polymorphism of the gene encoding brain-derived neurotrophic factor (MIM *113505.0002) has been related to susceptibility to memory impairment, anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa, and bipolar affective disorder, as well as to protection against obsessive-compulsive disorder and modification of the age at onset of Parkinson disease.",

After the initial creation of individual entries, information provided by new publications was usually added at the end of the existing record. Even when many entries in MIM reached a volume requiring reorganization into topical sections, the diachronic approach was maintained in each section; thus, the historical development of human genetics and particularly medical genetics is evident. The line-up of the 12 print editions of MIM (1966-1998) reflects that progress ( fig. 1 ). The 12 editions are serial cross-sections of the field over the 33 years, 1966-1998, spaced 3 years apart, on average. Progress in human genetics during the 40 years of the existence of MIM/OMIM can be gauged by several other measures more meaningful than the size of the books, including the total number of entries and the number of entries of particular types. Perhaps the most meaningful measures of progress are those that relate to the number of loci/genes mapped to specific chromosomal sites, the number of genes that have been identified as the site of disease-related mutations, and the total number of phenotypes that have been \"molecularized\"-that is, found to be associated with specific DNA mutations.
