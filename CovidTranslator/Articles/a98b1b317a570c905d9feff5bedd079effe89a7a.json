In this model, we accounted for the reported average time of duration of infection (\u03c4) of 14 days [6] . Model was calibrated by adjusting the rate constant (k) to approximate the total infection value reported by the DGS at 17 March. No further fitting was performed in this model. The effect of isolating different fractions of the population was modelled through the variation of parameter \u03b1 in equations. We assumed that protective measures were 99% effective, accounted through model parameter \u03b2. The ODEs were solved using PLAS software and series of simulations were carried scanning various values of the \u03b1 parameter [7] . Simulations were carried with the .

Further, the predicted numbers of cases for the end of March if no measures were taken would be around 42 million. This is also in agreement with the number released by the DGS to the social media based on statistical modelling.

            "text": "Importantly, our results show that the isolation measures had an immediate impact on diminishing the exponential increase of the number of infected cases and this depends on the percentage of the population that is isolated ( Figure 1B ). This is evident by the increasing deviation of the reported number of cases relative to the unperturbed simulation (0%) with time. The evolution of the number of cases reported by DGS between 18 and 25 of March fit between the simulation curves corresponding to 20% and 30% population isolation. This suggests that the estimated percentage of the population that have been effectively isolated is between these percentages. Interestingly, the data also shows a slight shift with time form being close to the 20% towards 30% suggesting that isolation behaviour of the population was gradual. From simulations, we identify other intervals (e.g. 50-60% and 70-75%) that suggest further isolation percentages may be more effective and still withing a plausible of pandemic time. Based on the fraction of hospitalized and mortality reported by the DGS on 27 March together with our model predictions, we computed several infection indicators for these intervals (Table 1 ). Model analysis indicates that current government-mandated measures may shift the expected peak of infections towards the beginning of May and can cause a substantial reduction in the infection numbers ( Figure 1C , Table 1 ). Thus, the predicted peak in the number of cases without any isolation measures would be around 2-2.5 million, whereas the intervention measures have decreased it to an estimated 1.2-0.5 million (Table 1 ). The estimated reduction would be predicted around 59 and 12 thousand people, .

Our simulations also indicate that the peak of infection can be further reduced ~3.5-fold with a delay to November if 70% percentage of the population is isolated at home and follows the government recommendations. For higher percentages of isolation (>75%), our model predicts a substantial reduction in the number of infections and delay of peaks, stopping the COVID-19 epidemic. These solutions, would result in much less total mortality and hospitalization requirements on peak in comparison to the current trend (Table 1, Figure   1B -C). Meanwhile, this comes with the burden of prolonging the time of pandemic to almost a year, which can be economically unbearable. In alternative, further isolation up to 50-50% of the population may be also a solution that substantially reduce most pandemic indicators and shifts the ending of the pandemic to September, with the peak between June and July.",

The fact that we only assume two compartments (Susceptible and Infected) considering the main populated cities (Lisbon and Porto) as one is huge approximation that neglects regional dynamics. Thus, the model is just an approximation that reflects an average trend and may fail to explain regional observations. In this model we also neglected many important parameters of infection transmission such as age groups, social interactions, contact dependent probability, and viral load dependent probability [8] . The inclusion of these parameters would definitely make the model more realistic. However, this data is not available for the Portuguese case and these models require accurate processing of data curation for suitable validation. We have bypassed these limitations by aggregating all of these parameters into one constant, which was fitted to the available data. Overall, the predictions shown here should be taken as semi-quantitative estimates within an upper and lower case-scenarios.",
