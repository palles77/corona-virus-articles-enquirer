The majority of the studies on tourism crises and disasters appear to be concerned with prevention, planning, response and recovery of such events (see, e.g., Ritchie, 2008; Hall, 2010) .

This method has been widely used in different sectors of activity in the determination of structural changes.

First, this method allows us to close a gap in the tourism industry related to the correct allocation of negative shocks in international tourism arrival demand to crisis or disaster phenomena. As stated by Intriligator, Bodkin, and Hsiao (1996: 579 ) \"a break in structure is always a serious matter because it implies that none of the statistical techniques (hypothesis testing, confidence intervals, etc.) is valid any longer. Moreover, the substantive conclusions about the system being modeled that one might wish to draw are also vitiated, to a greater or smaller extent\". Thus, we should be careful in interpreting the results of studies using international tourism demand data that did not take into account these structural breaks, to the extent that their results can be biased. Second, this method can be an important tool for monitoring the impact of a crisis event on the performance of the sector and to provide useful information to develop adequate policy responses to governments, destination managers and hotel managers. A crisis event that causes a structural break should require a specific policy and a greater allocation of resources by policymakers'. 2 The structure of the remaining paper is as follows. Section 2 provides some conceptual background and a review of previous studies about tourism crises and disasters and Bai and Perron's method and Section 3 the econometric procedure. Data is presented in Section 4, and Section 5 reports and discusses the results. The conclusion, limitations and future research appear in Section 6.",

Scott and Laws (2005: 152) present a table with different definitions of the terms crisis and disaster. We present three of these definitions. Reilly (1993) defines crisis as \"a situation which is harmful and disruptive, of high magnitude and is outside the firm's typical operating frameworks\". Carter (1991, p. xxiii) defines a disaster as \"an event, natural or man-made, sudden or progressive, which impacts with such severity that the affected community has to respond by taking exceptional measures\". Finally, the Pacific Asia Travel Association (PATA) (1991) describes a tourism crisis as \"a disaster, whether natural or man-made, that has the potential to totally disrupt the tourism industry\". As Faulkner (2001: 137) emphasizes, all these definitions have transformational connotations, with each event having potentially negative outcomes.",

Hall (2010: 403) refers that \"any period where international tourism numbers only increase by 2% or less often appears to be described as a crisis for the industry\". We are of the opinion that this is a simplistic definition that may explain the high number of researches on crises in the tourism sector. In fact, the author emphasizes a substantial number of publications that have looked at tourism crises. He reports 103,000 publications whose abstracts refer to crises, tourism crises and different types of crises. However, Brecher (1978) highlights the danger of oversimplification and the importance of recognizing that the crisis can be a complex phenomenon, given the chaotic nature of crises and disasters and the uncertainty that surrounds them. Given that crises and disasters can lead to chaotic situations and complex interrelations between human and natural systems, the comprehension of the relationship between cause and effect and the implications of decisions and actions is a complicated process (Faulkner, 2001) . In this sense Brecher (1978) highlights the seven aspects of the crisis that must be analyzed e source, gravity, complexity, time, communication patterns, outcomes and potential intensity.",

However, the recovery of this industry from a crisis is far more complicated than for other industries (Cavlek, 2002) . A very strong partnership and coordinated work among the government, national tourism organizations, foreign tour operators, local travel organizers, and local hospitality officials are essential, according to Cavlek (2002: 487) . Each needs to participate to an important degree in order to secure the fulfilment of several important actions. These include successful rebuilding of the destination image, overcoming any adverse policy resulting from the crisis, short-term restoration and long-term reconstruction of the damaged tourism facilities and infrastructures, effective management of media coverage, reduction of barriers and travel facilitation, and business and consumer regulation support and subsidies (Cavlek, 2002; Steiner et al. 2013) .",

            "text": "Finally, although various studies have extensively investigated crisis phenomena by using quantitative approaches in order to identify disruptions in tourist arrivals (e.g. Cavlek, 2002; Enders, Sandler, & Parise, 1992; Steiner et al., 2013) , none presents a methodology for identifying tourism crises or disasters. The identification of a \"real crisis\" is often a complex issue for several reasons. Sometimes countries suffer damage caused by a \"ripple\" effect that goes far beyond the destinations and parties directly 1 Scott and Laws (2005) involved in the incident that may result in a crisis (Cavlek, 2002, p. 481) . As shown by Young and Montgomery (1998:4) \"\u2026 a crisis has the potential to be detrimental to the marketability of any tourist destination, particularly if it is dramatised and distorted through rumours and the media\". On the other hand, as stated by Faulkner (2001:142) , \"the effectiveness with which the tourism industry in a disaster area handles a crisis, and therefore the degree to which it is prepared for it\", could explain why potentially serious crisis events for the industry did not bring about negative results. For this reason, we propose the application of Bai and Perron's (1998) method to identify structural changes in the international tourism arrival series. 3 This method also allows us to examine whether the dates defined by the method correspond to crisis or disaster events cited among other authors in Hall (2010) and Ritchie (2008) . Given that the BP method determines endogenously the structural break dates that we do not know in practice, it allows us to see which crisis events were truly harmful to the tourism industry, i.e., the real crisis events. We are of the opinion that it is the best method to identify an expost tourism crisis or disaster since this method determines endogenously structural breaks and therefore \"a situation which is harmful and disruptive\". Subsequently, in the explanation of structural breaks, we can relate them to crisis and disaster events referred to in researches and in the media.",

In this manner, we are only interested in the structural breaks that led to a decrease in the number of international tourists, seeking to identify the tourism crises or disasters that are at its origin. As is pointed out by Pesaran and Timmermann (2004) , the majority of time series are subject to occasional structural breaks and it can be very costly to ignore breaks because the results will be biased and forecasts inconsistent. Given that the majority of researches using international tourism arrival data do not analyze the existence of breaks in tourism demand series, the quality of the results is not guaranteed, neither is the correct identification of crisis and disaster phenomena in the tourism sector. In this sense, the BP method is used by us in this study in order to analyze the linkage between structural changes and crisis and disaster phenomena in the tourism sector. In the next section, the BP method is explained in detail. Perron (1998, 2003a, b) provide theoretical and computational testing procedures by which we can identify unknown breakpoints given T observations and m potential breaks (producing m\u00fe1 regimes) by least squares. Following among others, Caporale and Grier (2000) and Rapach and Wohar (2005) , we regress international tourism arrival series on a constant and test for structural breaks in the constant.

Our results also show that the tsunami of 26 December 2004 in the Indian Ocean had a negative effect on the tourism industry of the Maldives, Sri Lanka, Thailand and Indonesia. In this latter country the Bali bombings have also contributed to poor performance of the tourism sector. The structural breaks identified in 2005 are in line with the devastation of the tourism industry verified in these countries, as is indicated by Sharpley (2005) . Finally, we detected the existence of three more structural breaks -in 2007 and 2008 in Hong Kong and Sri Lanka and in 2011 in Japan. In the latter case, we believe that structural change is due to the earthquake, tsunami, and nuclear accident that had occurred consecutively in Fukushima, Japan, in March 2011 (in this regard see, e.g., Kim & Park, 2016) . The breaks identified in Hong Kong and Sri Lanka in 2007 and 2008, were probably due to the impact of financial and economic crisis.

In the case of Haiti, the earthquake of January 2010 caused heavy damage to the tourism sector, so the structural break identified in 2010 was to be expected. In the case of New Zealand, the earthquake of February 2011 caused damage mainly around Christchurch and we have not identified any structural break in the international tourism arrival series. As stated by Brecher (1978) , the gravity and potential intensity are two important factors for the beginning of a crisis that probably not have occurred in the case of New Zealand. The same idea is present in the two structural breaks identified in Madeira. In both cases, natural disasters are at their source. As noted by Machado (2012) , the \"Island of Madeira was not prepared for a catastrophe such as the one that occurred in February 2010, and its consequence has been a huge drop in the tourism industry\". Finally, we identify four structural breaks for Mexico, the UK and the USA. The structural break that we find in Mexico is due to the AH1N1 influenza outbreak that has occurred in the country in 2009. As underlined by Speakman and Sharpley (2012: 72) , soon as the \"situation dominate the world's media, international visitor numbers to Mexico decreased rapidly with the news of the influenza outbreak\". In the case of the UK the structural break identified is related to the foot and mouth disease, which was studied by, among others, Baxter and Bowen (2004) . The two structural breaks identified for the US are related to the 9/11 attacks and the financial crisis. The negative impact of the 9/11 attacks on US tourism and air travel is highlighted by Goodrich (2002) and Blunk, Clark, and McGibany (2006) . The recent economic and financial crisis seems to explain the structural break in 2009, as stated by Ritchie, Molinar, and Frechtling (2010) .",

Our results suggest that this method is shown to be reliable in ex-post detection of negative impacts of tourism crises and disasters related to natural disasters, terrorist attacks, political instability, economic and financial crisis and Table 1 Structural Break Estimation Results and its Rationale. This table presents for each country analyzed the results of the Perron (1998, 2003a, b) structural break method to test for infrequent structural breaks in international tourism arrivals. For the identified structural break dates, we seek to identify their rational, i.e. the existence of a crisis or disaster in the tourism sector of the country. In this manner, we are only interested in the structural breaks that led to a decrease in the number of international tourists, seeking to identify the tourism crises or disasters that are at its origin. * Significant at the 0.05 level. ** Bai and Perron (2003b) biosecurity and disease threats. The Bai and Perron's method has the advantage of determining endogenously structural breaks and identifying the respective dates, which allows a relationship between these dates and crisis and disaster events. Therefore, this method contributes in two ways to the literature related to crisis or disaster events in the tourism sector. First, this method allows us to solve a gap in the tourism industry related to the correct allocation of negative shocks in international tourism arrival demand to crisis or disaster phenomena, ensuring that the estimated results are not biased. Second, this method can be an important tool for monitoring the impact of a crisis event on the performance of the sector and for providing useful information to develop adequate policy responses to governments, destination managers and hotel managers. A crisis event that causes a structural break should require a specific policy and a greater allocation of resources by policymakers'.",

The first limitation is related to the fact that different crises may occur simultaneously in a given country or region. Given that Bai and Perron's method only determines endogenously the structural breaks and identifies their dates, it is impossible to know in these cases if only one or both of these crises are responsible for the structural break in demand for international tourism.",

            "text": "Secondly, given the ex-post detection of structural breaks, it can be argued that the intended monitoring of statistical data for management purposes seems to be solely possible within certain time lag. This is an extremely important point and has been one of the highlights of the current review of the European Union Solidarity Fund (EUSF) Regulation that provides financial support to a Member State in the event of a major natural disaster. 8 The recommendations for improving the EUSF include (i) budgetary discipline; (ii) reduction of the time taken to provide aid and (iii) a greater clarity as regards scope and definitions. The authors of the document consider that the time currently taken to mobilise the fund is unacceptably long, introducing the possibility of paying advances as soon as the affected state has applied for assistance and the aid would have to be returned to the Union budget in the event that the application was not accepted. For this purpose, it is necessary to define clearly and simply what a disaster is. Given that in developed countries it is possible to incorporate forecasts in international tourism demand series based on travel and accommodation booking requests, it may be possible to detect structural breaks in a short period of time. In the presence of a tourism crisis, the cancellation of travel and hotel reservations often occurs, a situation that tends to be rapidly incorporated into the estimates made for the series analyzed and captured by the BP method. In the short time that elapsed between the occurrence of the crisis and its detection by the BP method, the mechanism of pay advances mentioned above can be used.",
