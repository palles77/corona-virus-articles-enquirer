            "text": "The A59 strain of coronavirus, mouse hepatitis virus (MHV), produces acute hepatitis, meningoencephalitis, and chronic demyelination. The authors have previously shown that the spike (S) glycoprotein gene of MHV contains determinants of virulence, hepatitis, and demyelination. They then identified viruses containing mutations in the S gene that exhibit alterations in viral pathogenesis. In the present study, the authors produced new recombinant viruses with each one of these S gene mutations by site-directed mutagenesis and targeted recombination and studied the effect of each individual mutation on the pathogenesis of the virus. They identified a combination of mutations in the S1 gene (I375M and L652I) that abolishes demyelination. Individual mutation and other combinations of mutations in the S gene only interfere with virulence and hepatitis and only reduce demyelination (I375M), but do not abolish demyelination completely. Thus, demyelination determinants exist within genomic regions on both sides of the hypervariable region, downstream from the receptor-binding domain in the S1 part of the MHV spike glycoprotein gene. The structure and precise function of these regions awaits further investigation. Journal of NeuroVirology (2004) 10, 41-51.",

            "text": "Mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) is a member of the coronavirus genus, which belongs to the Coronaviridae family of the Nidovirales order (Cavanagh, 1997; Lai and Cavanagh, 1997) . Nidoviruses pro-duce a variety of hepatic, enteric, and neurologic diseases in animals, and upper respiratory and enteric diseases in humans (Lai and Cavanagh, 1997; Lavi et al, 1999; Lavi and Weiss, 1989) . Infection of MHV-A59 in 4-week-old C57Bl/6 (B6) mice produces a biphasic disease with acute hepatitis and meningoencephalitis followed by chronic inflammatory demyelinating disease (Lavi et al, 1984 (Lavi et al, , 1986 . MHV infection in mice (with both A59 and JHM strains) serves as an excellent laboratory model for virus-induced demyelination, similar to multiple sclerosis (MS) in humans (Houtman and Fleming, 1996; Knobler et al, 1981; Lavi et al, 1984b; Perlman et al, 1990; Sorensen et al, 1984; Wege et al, 1982; Weiner, 1973) . Because viral infection is considered as a potential trigger for demyelination in MS (Allen and Brankin, 1993) , understanding the mechanism of MHV-induced demyelination and the upstream events that lead to the autoimmune phenomenon may provide important insight into the mechanism of interaction between viruses and the nervous system, especially with respect to To understand the molecular basis of MHV neurotropism, we investigated a strain of MHV (MHV-2) that is closely related to MHV-A59 but is only weakly neurotropic (Hirano et al, 1974 (Hirano et al, , 1981 Wege et al, 1981; Yamada et al, 1997; Yokomori et al, 1991) . We sequenced the entire genome of MHV-2 and studied its detailed pathologic properties (Das Sarma et al, 2001b) . We found that MHV-2 produces acute hepatitis and meningitis, without encephalitis, without demyelination, and without persistence of virus in the central nervous system (CNS) (Das Sarma et al, 2001b) . We then replaced the S gene of A59 with that of MHV-2 by targeted recombination and produced recombinant viruses that have a persistence-positive, demyelination-negative phenotype. We concluded that demyelination determinants, independent of viral persistence, map to the S gene of MHV (Das Sarma et al, 2000) . Additional studies identified molecular determinants of pathogenesis in the S gene of MHV (Leparc-Goffart et al, 1998; Navas et al, 2001; Phillips et al, 1999 Phillips et al, , 2001 .",

These recombinant viruses were all found to be nondemyelinating. Sequencing the S genes of these recombinant viruses revealed that the recombinants' S gene was either derived from MHV-2 or from MHV-A59. All the recombinant viruses with an S gene derived from MHV-A59 had three identical amino acid substitutions within the S gene (Das Sarma et al, 2001a) . Because these recombinant viruses were produced by dual infection of cultures with MHV-2 and LA-7, we could not rule out that they also contained other mutations in addition to the mutations in the S gene. We therefore used site-directed mutagenesis and targeted recombination to produce new recombinant viruses, with selective S gene mutations that were associated with the demyelinationnegative phenotype.",

Alb4 is thermolabile and displays small plaque morphology at 39 \u2022 C; thus putative recombinants were selected as large plaque viruses after treatment for 24 h at 40 \u2022 C and plating on L2 cell at 39 \u2022 C. The use of the virus with feline spike protein (fMHV) also provided a Coronavirus S gene demyelination determinants L Fu et al 43 useful method to select recombinant viruses against the background of parental viruses. Because fMHV does not grow in mouse cells, the recombination process with the transfected plasmid could be achieved in feline cells (FCWF). Recombinant viruses with S genes derived from mutated mouse S gene regained the ability to grow in mouse 17Cl-1 cells. By switching from feline cells to mouse cells that did not support the growth of parental fMHV, we were able to select the recombinant viruses because only recombinant viruses with a mouse S gene were present in these cultures. The potential recombinants were plaque purified twice and screened by using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) sequencing to detect the expected mutations made in the S gene. To verify that no secondary site mutations had been introduced into the S gene, we sequenced the entire S gene of the new recombinant viruses.",

Similar bands were detected following infections with Penn99-1, Penn01-1, Penn01-3, and Penn01-5, all of which are demyelinating viruses.

Although the generation of an infectious MHV clone has been recently reported (Yount et al, 2002) , the new construct appears to be attenuated in vivo. Thus, molecular pathogenesis studies continue to require a complex manipulation of the MHV genome in order to introduce targeted changes into specific locations. To date, the best technique available for this purpose is targeted 3 end heterologous recombination, originally introduced by Paul Masters (Peng et al, 1995) . We used this technique in our previous studies, in which we identified the demyelination determinants in the S gene (Das Sarma et al, 2000) . We continued our investigation in the present study to better define the regions of genomic control of demyelination within the S gene. Although incidental mutations during coronavirus replication are not uncommon, we used strict precautions to reduce the chance that incidental mutations might interfere with molecular pathogenesis studies. We sequenced the entire S gene of each new recombinant virus immediately before it was used in pathogenesis studies to confirm the presence of the desired mutations and to exclude the possibility of incidental undesired mutations. The pathogenesis of new recombinant viruses was tested immediately after the generation of the viruses to avoid unnecessary passages of the viruses in culture, which tend to increase the chance for mutations. We generated two identical recombinant viruses for each mutation in two independent recombination procedures. Both viruses were tested in mice to ensure an identical in vivo phenotype. These precautions reduced the chance for incidental mutations to a negligible level.",

However, I375M in combination with L652I completely abolishes demyelination.

As shown in Figure 1 , we provisionally labeled these regions as S demyelination region 1 (SDR1) and S demyelination region 2 (SDR2). There are no known T-or B-cell epitopes in these regions; however, these S1 regions may influence spike protein functions in several ways. Binding of S1 to receptor is unlikely to be significantly affected by sites outside the first 330 amino acids because the CEACAM binding site can exist wholly in the amino terminal 330 residues of S1. However, SDR1 and SDR2 may still have influence on S1-CEACAM binding kinetics, which may affect pathogenesis. Similarly, the SDR1 and SDR2 regions may alter the kinetics and/or extent of the fusion activity of the spike protein, or the kinetics and/or extent of separation of S1 from S2. Either one of these changes may have an effect on the pathogenesis of the virus. The fact that two mutations are necessary for the abolishment of demyelination may rely on the three-dimensional spatial structure and folding of the S1 part of the molecule and on potential chemical interactions between the two sites.",

However, the reduced virulence per se is not enough to abolish demyelination. We have shown here and in a previous publications (Das Sarma et al, 2000 Sarma et al, , 2001a Sarma et al, , 2001b that viruses that lack the ability to produce demyelination can be either less virulent (Penn2K-1, and Penn2K-2) or significantly more vir-ulent (Penn98-1 and Penn98-2, and MHV-2) than MHV-A59. Moreover, the individual L652I mutation has a nonlethal phenotype but no effect on demyelination. In addition, ability of the virus to produce encephalitis may be a prerequisite, but is insufficient for the development of subsequent demyelination. For example, Penn2K-3 and penn2K-4 produce encephalitis similar to demyelinating viruses but do not produce demyelination. This study, therefore, provides further evidence that the ability of a virus to produce chronic demyelination is not in direct correlation with the virulence of the virus. Similarly, viral persistence may be a prerequisite but is insufficient for the development of demyelination. The property of demyelination is therefore a unique additional neurotropic property, which appears to be at least in part encoded by the S1 gene of the MHV genome.",

Infected and transfected cells were plated onto a monolayer of 17Cl-1 cells, and the released viruses were harvested at approximately 24 to 48 h post infection. For selection of the recombinant viruses, a two-step plaque purification was performed and PCR sequencing of the S gene was used to confirm the presence of the desired mutations. For each mutation, we produced two identical viruses in two independent recombination events. This strategy was designed to reduce the possibility that random unrecognized mutations would affect the phenotype. The new recombinant viruses were designated as the following (also in Table 1 ):",
