Those patients with epedimiology history were confirmed by chest CT scans or RT-PCR assays. Throat-swab or broncholveolr lvge fluid sample were collected from all the suspected patients at admission, and RT-PCR assays were perfomed at clinical laboratory. According to the fifih edition expert conference by Chinese healhty commission, except being indetified by RT-PCR, those suspected patients presenting with lung imaging fearure also regard as clinicially diagonsis cases in Hubei province. ARDS was identified in accordance with the Berlin definition [6] , and acute kidney injury was verified according to Improve Global Outcome definition [7] . If the serum levels of cardiac biomarkers ascended to the 99th percentile upper reference limit or new abnormalities were displayed in echocardiography or electrocardiography (ECG), the patient was regarded as acute cardiac injury. The discharged criteria included that symptom disappeared and the lesions eliminated evidently in the chest CT. Furthermore, RT-PCR was negative 2 consecutive beyond 24 hours. After discharged from hosptial, the patients went to the designated hospital for observeration. All patients except deaths were monitored up to March 4, 2020.",

A recent research indicated that lymphocytes,especially CD3 + lymphocytes and CD45 + lymphocytes, decreased significantly in compasrion with non-COVID patients, while there was no significantly difference in quantities and proportions of neutrophils and monocytes [14] .Results of this analysis showed lymphocytes and eostinophils decreased obviously without leukocytosis in most patients, and Neutrophils,monocytes and platelet mianly kept at normal range,it was consistent with previous reports. In term of chest CT, the typical image features were periphearl, subpleural ground glass opacities in the lower lobes. However, a study of CT mianifestions demonstrated that it was approximately 14% COVID-19 patients with atypical CT features [15] . Real time RT-PCR was considered a standard assesment for COVID-19\uff0c but the sensitivity was lower than chest CT scans, RT-PCR was 71%, chest CT scans reached 98% [16] .Thus, it was essential to perform chest CT for detecting the suspected patients.",

Immunoglobulin may enhance the ability of anti-infection in severely ill patient, and steroids are considered in those patients with ARDS. Oxygen inhalation was important to avoid to ARDS for the COVID-19 paitents with hypoxemia. In this study, 76.6% patients receivd oxygen by nasal cathete, and 90% received antiviral therapy, and 38.1% received glucocorticoids. CDC reported that the case-fatality rate (CFR) of COVID-19 the overall case--fatality rate (CFR) of COVID-19 was 2.3% in confirmed cases, and CFR among critical cases may reach 49.0% [11] . Nevertheless, most of patients were still treated in the hospital. Anoter retrospective study suggest the CFR was about 11% [13] . Statistical analysis of this study found that the CFR was 14.2%, and most of them were over 70 year-old patients accompanying with chronic illness.In the past one month, numerous effective measures, including blocking cities and roads, closing supermaket, monitoring temperature, building a new hosptial and seting up medical assistance team, have been carried out to controlling infection source, preventting transmission and reducing death.Until now, there was no new confirmed patients for 13 days,and hospitalized patients decreased sharply.",
