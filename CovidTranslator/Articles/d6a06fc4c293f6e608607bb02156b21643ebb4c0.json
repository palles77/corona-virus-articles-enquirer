            "text": "Canine respiratory coronavirus (CRCoV) has frequently been detected in respiratory samples from dogs by RT-PCR. In this report the first successful isolation of CRCoV from a dog with respiratory disease is described. The isolate CRCoV-4182 was cultured in HRT-18 cells but failed to replicate in a number of other cell lines. The nucleotide sequence of the 3 -terminal portion of the CRCoV genome was determined including all open reading frames from the NS2 gene to the N gene. Comparison with other coronavirus sequences showed a high similarity to bovine coronavirus (BCoV). The region between the spike and the E gene was found to be the most variable and was used for phylogenetic analysis of several CRCoV strains. CRCoV-4182 showed a mutation within the non-structural protein region downstream of the S gene leading to the translation of an 8.8 kDa putative protein comprising a fusion of the equivalent of the BCoV 4.9 kDa protein to a truncated version of the BCoV 4.8 kDa protein. The culture of CRCoV will enable analysis of the expression and function of this and other CRCoV proteins as well as allowing the study of the role of CRCoV in the aetiology of canine infectious respiratory disease.",

            "text": "Canine respiratory coronavirus (CRCoV) was originally detected by RT-PCR in respiratory samples from a population of dogs at a rehoming centre with a high incidence of infectious respiratory disease (Erles et al., 2003) . Subsequent studies found that serum antibodies to the virus were common in the canine population of the United Kingdom, Republic of Ireland, USA and Japan (Kaneshima et al., 2006; Priestnall et al., 2006) . The role of CRCoV in the canine infectious respiratory disease complex is still under investigation. Phylogenetic analyses and the presence of a haemagglutinin esterase gene placed CRCoV in group 2 of the Coronaviridae family. Coronaviruses are enveloped viruses with a large (27-32 kb) singlestranded, positive-sense RNA genome. The structural proteins located within the viral envelope are the spike protein (S), membrane protein (M), envelope protein (E) and the haemagglutinin esterase (HE) protein, which is only present in members of group 2 of the coronaviruses. The nucleocapsid protein (N) associates with the viral RNA to form the helical nucleocapsid (Spaan et al., 1988) . Two large open reading frames (ORFs) at the 5 end of the genome encode the coronavirus replicase proteins. Additional non-structural proteins of group 2 coronaviruses such as bovine coronavirus (BCoV) and mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) are located between the polymerase gene and the HE gene and between the S and E gene. Coronaviruses produce 3 coterminal sets of mRNA of which in general only the first gene at the 5 end is translated. All mRNAs contain a common leader sequence at the 5 end which is encoded by the 5 end of the coronavirus genome. Coronavirus genes are preceded at the 5 end by transcription regulatory sequences (TRS) that commonly include the consensus sequence CYAAAC Zuniga et al., 2004) .",

Fig. 3 shows the genomic organisation of the region between the S and the E gene for BCoV strain Mebus compared to CRCoV strain 4182. The region was divided into three parts for sequence analysis. Region A (297-305 bp) corresponded to the ORFs for the 4.9 and 4.8 kDa proteins of BCoV, region C corresponded to the partial ORF (137 bp) of the BCoV 12.7 kDa protein and region B was the non-coding sequence located in between these ORFs (79-83 bp).

To increase sensitivity, a PCR assay for the detection of nucleocapsid protein gene mRNA was used in addition to detection of CRCoV proteins by immunofluorescence. The failure of CRCoV to replicate in these cell lines may indicate a lack of the appropriate receptor for CRCoV or that other necessary factors for CRCoV replication are not present. MDCK, MDBK and Vero cells have been successfully used for the culture of BCoV. We chose to use CRCoV isolate 4182 at passage 13 as sufficient virus to carry out the experiments was available at that passage.

            "text": "The region between the spike gene and the gene for the 12.8 kDa non-structural protein was the most variable region when comparing CRCoV to BCoV. A deletion of two nucleotides within the gene for the homologue of the BCoV 4.9 kDa protein led to the loss of a stop codon and the generation of an 8.8 kDa protein that included the full length of the 4.9 kDa homologue and a truncated version of the 4.8 kDa protein homologue. It has been hypothesised previously that the 4.9 and 4.8 kDa proteins of BCoV may have arisen by mutation from an 11 kDa protein which is similar to the 15.2 kDa protein of MHV JHM (Abraham et al., 1990b) . The mutation leading to the translation of an 8.8 kDa protein has so far only been detected in CRCoV strains circulating within a canine population at one kennel whereas a strain from a different canine population coded for a 4.9 kDa protein comparable to BCoV. These putative nonstructural proteins are not present in HCoV-OC43 (Mounir and Talbot, 1993a) and the function of the equivalent 4.9 kDa and 4.8 kDa proteins in BCoV is unknown. Moreover the 4.9 kDa protein of BCoV may not be expressed due to the lack of a start codon in its mRNA . The same may apply to CRCoV as the closest transcription regulatory sequence was located 317 nucleotides prior to the start codon. The same TRS which is used by BCoV three nucleotides downstream of the start codon is also present in CRCoV. Analysis of the CRCoV mRNA for this region will be required to determine if the protein is likely to be expressed. It remains to be assessed if the presence of an 8.8 kDa protein changes the growth characteristics of the virus in vitro or if it alters the virulence of CRCoV in dogs. ORF 4, which codes for the corresponding non-structural proteins in MHV, has been deleted experimentally without a detrimental effect to the growth of the virus in cell culture (Ontiveros et al., 2001) . Similarly, replication of MHV strain S in cell culture is comparable to other MHV strains despite the lack of expression of the ORF 4 product (Yokomori and Lai, 1991) .",

All CRCoV genes analysed were found to be most closely related to BCoV-LY138 an isolate obtained in the USA in 1965. Previous sequence analysis of a partial region of the polymerase gene also showed the closest nucleotide similarity to be with BCoV. CRCoV is therefore unlikely to have resulted from a recombination event. Phylogenetic analyses for the non-structural region between the S and E genes reported here placed CRCoV most closely to BCoV confirming analyses based on the partial polymerase gene (Erles et al., 2003) as well as for the complete spike and nucleoprotein genes (data not shown). It is possible that CRCoV originated from a transmission of BCoV to dogs. Sequence data from CRCoV strains from countries other than the UK however will be necessary to determine the origins of CRCoV.",
