In addition to developments in the different surgical and anesthetic techniques, there is no doubt that advances in immunosuppressor treatment have played a key role in allowing such improvements in therapy. Infections are the most frequent complications in transplant recipients, 1 and are the main cause of death during the first year after transplantation. SOT recipients are particularly vulnerable to common or opportunistic viral infections. 2 Such infections may derive from the donor organ (donor-derived infections) or may be community-acquired or correspond to the reactivation of latent endogenous viruses of the patient. Apart from the direct harmful effects of many of these viruses, 3 mention must be made of the immune modulating and inflammatory actions of some of them, which can give rise to very important indirect effects 4 such as acute or chronic graft rejection, or the favoring of other opportunistic infections.",

The disorders may range from scantly expressive or oligosymptomatic clinical conditions, characterized only by fever and detectable viremia, to processes that are extremely serious because of serious structural and functional damage to the grafted organ (more susceptible to infection and greater damage) or to other target organs (due to special tropism shown by some viruses), or because of their disseminated and systemic nature. In this context, mention can be made o f s i m p l e i n f e c t i o n d u e t o C M V w i t h f e v e r a n d cytomegaloviremia, but also of serious organ-specific disease 17 such as enterocolitis (with hemorrhagic characteristics in some cases), pneumonia (including even a bilateral alveolointerstitial pattern with severe respiratory failure or adult respiratory distress syndrome [ARDS]), hepatitis, retinitis and encephalitis. Very similar behavior can be shown by other viruses of the herpes family, such as HSV, VZV and HHV-6, 18 causing more or less extensive and characteristic (vesicular or nonvesicular) exanthematic mucocutaneous disease, with the particularity of being able to spread to or affect other organs. Presentations of a particularly serious nature include hepatitis, pneumonitis, gastrointestinal forms (esophagitis and colitis), and especially the neuro-ophthalmological forms of meningoencephalitis, encephalomyelitis and retinitis. Fortunately, this viral family is susceptible to treatment with specific antiviral agents of established efficacy. 19 In this context, EBV can cause various types of very distinct infectious syndromes (Table 1) , though posttransplantation lymphoproliferative disease (PTLD) is of particular importance due to its clinical repercussions and exclusive management characteristics. 20, 21 The polyomaviruses produce a broad range of relevant clinical conditions depending upon their tropism and invasiveness, giving rise to severe demyelinization p h e n o m e n a s u c h a s p r o g r e s s i v e m u l t i f o c a l leukoencephalopathy (PML) in the case of JCV and to a varied number of processes in the case of BKV, 22,23 such as graft interstitial nephropathy (in renal transplants) -with the risk of transplanted organ loss, ureteral stenosis, hemorrhagic cystitis, meningoencephalitis or urothelial carcinoma ( Table 2) .

However, the presence of GVHD and its treatment may delay such immune recovery. CMV is the most important infectious agent in this phase.

It is sometimes difficult to distinguish between mucositis caused by HSV and that caused by the chemotherapy itself; as a result, empirical antiviral therapy is usually indicated. The reactivation of HSV can be reduced from 80% to less than 5% in seropositive recipients during the first month after transplant by prescribing aciclovir or valaciclovir from the time of conditioning and until recovery from mucositis 35 (see treatment and prophylaxis in Table 3 ). 38, 39 Varicella zoster virus: This manifests as a primary infection (5%) or as reactivation (95%) in 40% of the patients at some time during the first year after transplant, in patients with important cellular immune deficiency (Hodgkin's lymphoma), and in patients in which the condition was previously not common (CLL) and who had received treatment with new immunosuppressor drugs (fludarabine, rituximab, alemtuzumab). In addition to the typical cutaneous forms of presentation, hemorrhagic pneumonia, hepatitis, central nervous system involvement, thrombocytopenia and retinal necrosis may be observed. Occasionally in patients with HPCT, visceral involvement can occur without preceding skin lesions. GVHD is a potent predictor of dissemination. Mortality increases in the presence of lung involvement. The treatment is summarized in Table 3 . 38, 39 Cytomegalovirus: CMV infection is an important complication in patients subjected to HPCT, for although the incidence of CMV disease has decreased in recent years thanks to the prevention strategies adopted, CMV seropositivity is considered an independent risk factor for GVHD and is associated with poorer survival, increased mortality due to bacteremia and fungal infections, and with transplant-related mortality. 40 The manifestations of CMV infection of the target organs are pneumonia, enterocolitis and (more rarely) retinitis. CMV pneumonia is the most frequent and serious manifestation, for even with treatment the mortality rate is 30-50%. This disorder is infrequent prior to graft consolidation, however. On the other hand, CMV pneumonia is being seen to behave as an emerging infection in adult leukemia patients treated with immunosuppressor drugs. 41 HPCT recipients can be classified into different CMV disease risk groups. High risk is assumed for allogenic transplants if there is T cell depletion of the precursor cell source, if the donor is not a relative, in the absence of identical histocompatibility antigen (HLA), the use of highdose corticosteroids, treatment with alemtuzumab and purine analogs, and autologous transplants with CD34+ selection, treated with purine analogs and high-dose corticosteroids ( Table 3 ). The diagnostic techniques of choice for early detection of the infection are antigenemia and PCR. In relation to the diagnosis, it important to apply consensus-based criteria of infection and disease. 42 The regimens relating to prophylaxis, anticipatory treatment and guided treatment are explained in Table 3 .",
