In this paper, we present the development, optimization and validation of an in vitro cell-based high-throughput screening (HTS) assay using the luminescent-based CellTiter-Glo reagent to identify novel antivirals against BTV. Conditions of the cytopathic effect (CPE)-based assay were optimized at cell density of 5 000 cells/well in medium containing 1% FBS and a multiplicity of infection at 0.01 in 384-well plate, with Z'-values \u2265 0.70, Coefficient of Variations \u2265 5.68 and signal-to-background ratio \u2265 7.10. This assay was further validated using a 9 532 compound library. The fully validated assay was then used to screen the 194 950 compound collection, which identified 693 compounds with > 30% CPE inhibition. The tenconcentration dose response assay identified 185 structures with IC 50 \u2264 100 \u03bcM, out of which 42 compounds were grouped into six analog series corresponding to six scaffolds enriched within the active set compared to their distribution in the library. The CPE-based assay development demonstrated its robustness and reliability, and its application in the HTS campaign will make significant contribution to the antiviral drug discovery against BTV disease.",

BTV is transmitted by biting midges of Culicoides, including C. variipennis and C. imocola (Mellor, 2000) . BTV replicates in both vertebrate and insect hosts, causing diseases in wild ruminants and economic important animals including sheep, goat, cattle and other domestic animals around the world (Mellor, 2000; Mellor & Wittmann, 2002) , with $3 billion/year loss worldwide (MacLachlan & Osburn, 2006; Mellor et al., 2008) . Due to its economic significance, BTV has been the subject of extensive molecular, genetic and structural studies and now represents one of the well characterized viruses.",

Currently, vector control and vaccination using BTV virus-like particles are two main prevention strategies being implemented to prevent the possible BTV epidemics (Blair et al., 2000; Travanty et al., 2004) . However, such strategies have been demonstrated to be insufficient due to the changes of vector habitats and new virus strains. The 1998-2001 outbreak of BTV in the Mediterranean Basin was the greatest epizootic of the disease on record, showing that BTV had extended its range northwards into areas of Europe that were never affected before and has persisted in many of these locations (Meiswinkel et al., 2008) . This epidemic has been linked to the recent distribution extensions of its major vector, C. imicola, the involvement of novel Culicoides vector(s), and an apparent ability of the virus to overwinter in the absence of adult vectors Mellor & Wittmann, 2002) . Thus, it is urgent to develop effective antiviral drugs against BTV infection to avoid possible epidemics.",

CPE is evident in BTV infected vertebrate cells, such as HeLa, BSR, and HEK 293T, including both the biochemical and morphological hallmarks of apoptosis (caspase-3 activation, DNA fragmentation, membrane blebbing and cellular shrinkage) (Li et al., 2007) . BTV-induced CPE and/or apoptosis could be monitored using different CPE and apoptosis detection methods, which make the development of a robust and reliable assay possible.

Results were expressed as percent inhibition of CPE where 100% inhibition of CPE was equal to the mean of the cell only control. Compounds showing greater than average CPE inhibition plus three times standard deviation of % inhibition of viralinduced CPE of all compounds were considered \"hits\" and tested in ten-concentration dose response assay.

Characteristics of apoptosis and CPE, including cell shrinkage, membrane blebbing, and DNA fragmentation, have been shown and the apoptotic pathway has been elucidated (Li et al., 2007; Mortola et al., 2004; Nagaleekar et al., 2007) . The quantitative analysis of the CPE induced by BTV infection was shown here using 96-well plate. BSR cells were seeded with a density of 15 000 cells/well, and infected with BTV at different MOIs, 0.5, 1.0 and 10, respectively. At different hours post infection (h.p.i.), BTV-induced CPE was determined using the CellTiter-Glo Luminescent Cell Viability kit, a homogeneous method of determining the number of viable cells in culture based on quantitation of the ATP present, which signals the presence of metabolically active cells. The single step \"add-mix-measure\" format resulting in cell lysis and the generation of luminescent signals is also ideal for future large scale HTS of various compound libraries. While there was no significant decrease of cell viability in BTV infected cell at 24 h.p.i., a two-fold decrease of cell viability in BTV infected cells was observed in all three MOIs at 48 h.p.i.. The decrease of cell viability was much more apparent at 72 h.p.i., with 9.7, 12.0 and 11.7 fold decreases, i.e. S/B ratio, for MOI of 0.5, 1.0 and 10, respectively ( Figure 1 ). This result showed that BTV infection induced CPE can be quantitated, especially at 72 h.p.i. with remarkable high S/B ratios. Meanwhile, this single step CPE-based assay will be suitable for future HTS assays, although further optimizations were necessary to improve this CPE-based assay into a primary HTS assay.",

Thus, it is necessary to evaluate the effect of DMSO on cell growth and cell viability of BSR cells. After being seeded in 96-well plates at 15 000 cells/well, BSR cells were treated with DMSO at different concentrations, ranging from 0.02% up to 2% (Figure 2 ). After 72 h incubation, cell viability was determined using the CellTiter-Glo reagent. The effect of DMSO on cell viability was compared between the cell viability in DMSO treated cells relative to cell viability in cells that were not treated with DMSO. When BSR cells were treated with DMSO at 1% or lower concentration, there were no decreases on the cell viability. In contrast, there was a slight increase of cell viability, ranging from 5% to 12%, when cells were treated with DMSO concentration below 1%. However, when cells were treated with 2% DMSO, there was 28.9% decrease of cell viability, a considerable decrease comparing with cells without DMSO treatment ( Figure 2 ). This result supported that the designated 0.6% DMSO concentration for our HTS campaign will be suitable for the screening. Meanwhile, there should be no more than 1% DMSO added to the cell culture for the entire screening when using this assay.",

Two different FBS concentrations, 5% and 1% in DMEM media, were evaluated at different seeding cell densities. At both concentrations, seeding density at 7 500 and 10 000 cells/well showed similar pattern and the decreases of cell viability were observed at 72 h post seeding.

These compounds were selected based on their physico-chemical properties with cutoffs applied, including MW <1 000, cLogP < 5, HBA < 20 and HBD < 10.

The assay robustness, including the average Z'-value and S/B ratio were graphically illustrated in Figure  5 .

Out of the 658 dose response tested hits, an 'active set' of 185 compounds possessing IC 50 values less than 100 \u03bcM was selected for the purpose of structural analysis. In order to identify common structural elements within the 185 actives, this set was clustered. For each cluster, a representative substructure was identified as a common motif shared by all members of the cluster. The enrichment ratio characterizing a particular substructure was defined here as the ratio between the percentage of compounds that contain this substructure within the active set (185 compounds) and the same percentage within the entire library screened (194 942 compounds). Privileged scaffolds contributing to the activity of hits were typically present in higher percentages among active compounds compared to their distribution within the entire screened library. We selected scaffolds representative of hit clusters that showed enrichment ratios greater than 10 and these were listed in decreasing order of cluster sizes on Scheme I. Privileged scaffolds were likely to be present among non-clustered actives or in small clusters (with members less than 3) as well. Therefore selection of scaffolds further pursued will include clustered hits as well as non-clustered, singleton active structures.",

            "text": "CPE is a general term used to describe the adverse effect on the cells post viral infection. CPE involves at least two distinct processes: necrosis and apoptosis. Various assays are available to distinguish these two mechanisms through measuring a variety of different markers that indicate the number of dead cells (cytotoxicity), the number of live cells (viability), and the mechanism of cell death (apoptosis). Most conventional cell-based antiviral drug screening assays were developed based on the cell viability assay (ATPase, kinase and cytotoxicity). The introduction of CPE-based assay using ATP/luminescence readout, such as CellTiter-Glo reagent, has been recently reported, which made the HTS against large compound library possible in several different antiviral assays, including the antiviral HTS assays against influenza virus (Noah et al., 2007; Severson et al., 2008) , SARS-CoV , Yellow fever virus (Gong et al., 2008) , Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus (Paragas et al., 2004) . Our CPE-based antiviral assay against BTV also showed its feasibility with the \"mix and measure\" one step protocol, and flexibility with stable luminescent signals. Meanwhile, toxic compounds that reduced the cell viability were also excluded in this CPE-based assay. This CPE-based assay was also easy to be adapted and validated in HTS Center, making it possible to screen large compound libraries, such as MLSMR collection. This assay may also be used for assays based on CPE induced by other reoviruses and arboviruses.",

The duplicated validation screening of the CPE-based assay using the 9 532 testing compound library, and the primary HTS assay against MLSMR further demonstrated the assay was sufficiently robust and reproducible for a HTS platform with very similar statistical assay performance values, including Z'-value between 0.70 and 0.71, CV for the cell control between 4.52% and 5.94%, and S/B between 4.49 and 7.56 (Table 1) . CV from the virus infected control was higher than 10%, which is natural for the virus infected cells due to the complexity nature if virus infection process. The S/B ratio form one of the validation screenings was 4.49, lower than 5.0 as requirement, however, the consistent Z'-value from the validation screenings indicated that this assay was robust for using in HTS. Indeed, similar Z'-values, CV and S/B ratio were also obtained for these assay parameters in our primary HTS, which further demonstrated that the assay is reproducible and reliable.",

BTV is the prototype virus in the genus Orbivirus within the family Reoviridae. BTV is considered to be one of the most important diseases of domestic livestock, and has been a subject of intense molecular study for the last three decades and is now one of the best understood viruses at the molecular and structural levels Roy, 2008) . As a member of reoviruses and arboviruses, BTV must be capable and should be sufficiently flexible to allow its replication in evolutionarily distant hosts, which also applied to other reoviruses and arboviruses including members in the families of Togaviridae, Flaviviridae, Bunyaviridae, Rhabdoviridae, and Reoviridae. Since antiviral compounds identified here could protect host cells from BTV-induced CPE responses, these compounds might also protect host cells from other reoviruses and arboviruses infections. Meanwhile, any compound identified using this assay could be used as a chemical probe to further study the virus-host interactions. Thus, our developed HTS assay will be of direct benefit to the drug development and drug design to counter reoviruses and arboviruses diseases, thereby have a positive impact on the widespread burden of these diseases. The effect of DMSO on the cell viability at 72 h post seeding. Cells were seeded and treated with different concentrations of DMSO (percentage). Cell viability was expressed by luminescent signals (units per well). Line indicated the level of luminescent signals from the cells with no DMSO treatment. The experiment was repeated for three times and each data point represents the average value of 16 replicates. The effect of seeding cell density and FBS concentrations in DMEM media on the BSR cells. Cell viability was expressed by luminescent signals (units per well). Cells were seeded in 384well plates at different cell densities with different FBS concentration in DMEM media, 5% FBS concentration in Figure 3a and 1% FBS concentration in Figure 3b . Cell viabilities were measured at different time post seeding and were expressed as luminescent signals per well using CellTiter-Glo reagent. At 24 h post seeding, data for cell density at 2,500 and 5,000 cells/ well were not shown in both Figure 3a and 3b.
