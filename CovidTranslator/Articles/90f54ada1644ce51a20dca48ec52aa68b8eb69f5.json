These dynamic policies aim to select the best current intervention based on accumulating epidemic data and the availability of resources at each decision point. We propose an algorithm to approximate dynamic policies that optimize the population's net health benefit, a performance measure which accounts for both health and monetary outcomes. We further illustrate how dynamic policies can be defined and optimized for the control of a novel viral pathogen, where a policy maker must decide (i) when to employ or lift a transmission-reducing intervention (e.g. school closure) and (ii) how to prioritize population members for vaccination when a limited quantity of vaccines first become available. Within the context of this application, we demonstrate that dynamic policies can produce higher net health benefit than more commonly described static policies that specify a pre-determined sequence of interventions to employ throughout epidemics.",

The observations that can be made during epidemics are numerous (e.g. notified hospitalizations, disease-related mortality, and vaccine availability) and measures of these observations must be made repeatedly over time. A large number of dynamic policies can thus be defined, each of which differs in the manner that the accumulating set of observations is used to inform decisions. A fundamental question is how one can construct dynamic policies that use simple, easily obtained measures of epidemic state and resource availability which still can inform (approximately) optimal decisions throughout epidemics.",

            "text": "Our objective in this paper is to develop a decision model that can be used to define and optimize dynamic policies for controlling epidemics. The optimality of these policies will be determined by their ability to minimize disease-related morbidity and mortality under defined resource constraints (e.g. vaccine doses and budget). To demonstrate the use of our decision model, we consider the problem of resource allocation during an emerging epidemic in which a novel viral pathogen spreads in a completely susceptible population. Examples of such epidemics include H1N1 and H5N1 influenza [3, 5, 15] and SARS [4, 16] . Although we will focus on the problem of resource allocation during a novel pathogen pandemic, the decision model proposed here can be used to characterize dynamic policies for control of other patterns of infectious disease spread. school-age children, who often play an important role in transmission, and consequently, to interrupt or decrease the speed and extent of transmission in the population [22, 23] Despite these potential health benefits, social and economic costs associated with school closure are often high due to missing schoolwork, workplace absenteeism, and wage loss [24] . This control measure, therefore, should be implemented only when the reduction in disease transmission is high enough to offset the cost [25, 26] . If school closure were implemented too late in the epidemic, it would fail to have any meaningful mitigating effect while triggering the intervention too soon would incur unnecessary social and economic costs. Of equal importance is the decision about when to reopen schools. Lifting the intervention prematurely may result in a second epidemic peak and erosion of the accumulated benefit [22] . The first policy-related challenge we consider here is how to decide when to close or reopen schools as the pathogen is spreading in the population.",

As a consequence, an effective vaccine may become available in limited quantity and with considerable delay. During an emerging epidemic, individuals with particular risk factors or health conditions (e.g. the elderly or the immunocompromised) are particularly at higher risk of morbidity and mortality [27] [28] [29] . Providing vaccine to these high-risk individuals has a significant direct benefit in preventing mortality. However, individuals with high contact rates with the rest of the population (e.g. school-aged children) may also be attractive vaccine candidates due to their key role in transmission. The second policy-related question we study in this paper is how to rationalize the limited supply of vaccines between population subgroups who are at different level of mortality risk (e.g. healthy individuals versus those with certain conditions), and who play a different role in disease transmission (e.g. children versus the elderly) [30] .",

Various modeling frameworks can be used to characterize the stochastic process X = {X k , k \u2265 1}, including Markov chain [33] , agent-based [3, 34, 35] , and contact network [36, 37] models. In \u00a74.1 we describe a Markov model to characterize X k for a novel viral epidemic.",

The loss function r(A k , \u03c7 k ) can be characterized in a variety of ways depending on the policy maker's priorities. For example, if the policy maker wants to minimize the total number of influenza cases over the course of epidemic, then loss function r(A k , \u03c7 k ) can be simply defined as the number of new influenza cases during the period [k, k + 1]. However, efforts to control epidemics may be bounded by the availability of resources, in particular budget. In these situations, where both healthrelated and financial outcomes are essential for determining the optimality of a health policy, a common approach is to assume that the policy maker's objective is to minimize the loss in population's net health benefit (NHB) [38] . If action A k \u2208 2 is in effect and events \u03c7 k occur during the decision period [k, k + 1], the loss in the population's NHB is defined as r(A k , \u03c7 k ) = q(\u03c7 k ) + (v(\u03c7 k ) + c(A k ))/\u03bb where: Accounting for both health and cost outcomes of alternatives, net health benefit is widely used as a measure of performance in economic evaluation of health care programs [39, 40] . The decision maker's willingness to invest resources to improve the population's health is represented by the WTP parameter \u03bb; and therefore, the term (v(\u03c7 k ) + c(A k ))/\u03bb represents the units of health that the decision maker is willing to forgo to save v(\u03c7 k ) + c(A k ) monetary units. A larger (smaller) value of \u03bb indicates the abundance (scarcity) of resources.",

It is important to note that the process that generates observations during a given decision interval may be directly influenced by the interventions that are being used. For example, during an influenza epidemic, the case detection rate can be boosted through intensified case finding strategies, such as contact tracing. When these intensified interventions are lifted, the case detection rate may drop significantly. Hence, it will be important in this setting to use information about which interventions were employed during the period over which observations have been gathered as features as well.

In many situations, we would expect substantial correlation among the observations gathered during epidemics. For example, for most epidemics, hospitalized case notifications will be correlated with the number of the infection-associated deaths, and hence including both of these features leads to divergence of the proposed algorithm. This property may actually be advantageous in generating policies that are convenient to implement in practice since the policy maker needs only to gather data about features with the strongest predictive power and the least correlation with other potential features.

Our model is based on earlier epidemic models [54] [55] [56] [57] with the following additions necessary to address the two policy-related questions described in \u00a72. In this model, population members are grouped according to their age and their disease-associated mortality rates. Two age groups are considered in this model: \"Children\" and \"Adults.\" [27, 28] . Within each age group, members with particular risk factors (e.g. chronic pulmonary or cardiovascular conditions) are considered at higher risk of the disease-associated mortality [27] [28] [29] . While in reality individuals with multiple co-morbid conditions may be at highest risk of disease-associated mortality, for simplicity we assume that risk is characterized by a binary classification by \"Average\" (i.e. no co-morbid condition) and \"High\" (i.e. any comorbid condition). Since influenza epidemics typically last only a few months, we assume that the population structure does not fundamentally change during the epidemic; that is individuals do not move between age or risk subgroups and birth or deaths are negligible.",

To inform decisions, dynamic policy A uses the 'cumulative number of hospitalized cases, whereas dynamic policy B uses both the 'cumulative number of hospitalized cases' and the 'number of hospitalized cases over the previous week'. Policies displayed in Figure 4 recommend keeping schools closed while the values of corresponding features are in the black regions. To illustrate how dynamic policy B guides decisions, we overlay a simulated epidemic trajectory onto this policy (represented by the dark grey curve). For the depicted trajectory, dynamic policy B recommends closing schools when the epidemic enters into the black region, and recommends reopening schools when the epidemic trajectory re-enters into the gray region. Figure 5 shows the relative performance of Dynamic Policies A-B with respect to the Static Policy displayed in Figure 4 for the WTP of $500, 000 per life-year saved. The diamonds represent 95% confidence intervals for the mean of paired performance differences which are constructed through the use of common random numbers as a variance reduction technique [60] .

Our experience, however, shows that the inclusion of this feature does not lead to a larger NHB gain compared to Dynamic Policies A and B. Figure 6 displays the effect of WTP value on the total cost incurred and the life years lost during an epidemic if Dynamic Policy B is used to guide school-closure decisions. The affordability curve (Figure 6(A) ) returns the expected total costs, and the health outcome curve (Figure 6 (B)) shows the expected life years lost as a function of the policy maker's WTP for saving one life-year. This figure demonstrates that increasing the WTP value lead to higher costs to control the epidemic but also saves more life-years. In the absence of accurate estimate for the WTP for health, the policy maker can also use the affordability curve ( Figure 6 (A)) to select a level of WTP that satisfies existing budget constraints.

We also observe that for the scenario considered here, A-Approximation method never leads to a policy with higher NHB gain than policies characterized by H-or Q-Approximation method. This suggests that the additivity condition assumed by the A-Approximation method (see \u00a73.2.3) may not be valid in this scenario.

In a numerical experiment including these age or risk-stratified features, we found that the inclusion of these features did not result in superior policies compared to the policies studied in Figure 7 . This may partially be explained by the fact that incorporating a larger number of features in regression models may increase the probability of collinearity among regressors which results in lower accuracy of predictions. This problem might be mitigated through the use of different regression models, such classification and regression trees [63] .

These analyses provide critical understanding about the characteristics of circulating pathogens which allow the development of mathematical and simulation models to project epidemic outcomes and investigate the performance of viable control strategies. This paper extends prior research on the control of epidemics by developing a decision model to define and optimize a novel class of control policies, referred to as dynamic policies.

As novel sources of epidemic data, such as electronic medical and laboratory records [65, 66] , Internet queries [67, 68] and Twitter feeds [69, 70] become increasingly available, we expect that tools to inform dynamic policies will be in increasing demand, since these tools would provide a mechanism to translate epidemic observations into costeffective decisions.

Dynamic treatment regimes inform treatment recommendations that are responsive to an evolving illness in individual patients. This work extends the methodologies to guide decision making using accumulated data to address resource-allocation decisions in mitigating epidemics. The solution methodology proposed in this paper to characterize dynamic epidemic control policies does not restrict the type of epidemic model and hence various frameworks, including Markov chain [33] , agent-based [3, 34, 35] , or contact network [36, 37] models may be used. This allows the decision maker to incorporate a broad range of pharmaceutical and non-pharmaceutical interventions and their attendant logistical constraints into the underlying epidemic model. A limitation of the proposed decision model is the fact that the specific choice of features, the approximation functions, and the learning and exploration rules affect the optimality and stability of the generated policies. If these optimization settings are not appropriately selected the algorithm may converge to a suboptimal and/or oscillating solution. This problem, however, can be mitigated through careful experimental design as discussed in \u00a74.2.",

At this time, it is unclear whether the methods we have proposed for dynamic policy identification are more sensitive to model misspecification than those for determining static policies; this is an important area for future research as trade-offs between static and dynamic policies are further explored. In the meantime, we suggest that if the predictions made by the model do not match the new observations, within a desired degree of accuracy, the model should be re-calibrated. This goal can be achieved by a broad range of methods ranging from simple visual matching to more sophisticated statistical approaches, such as by maximizing a likelihood function [55, [76] [77] [78] [79] . If the model fails to make reasonably accurate short-term predictions, the underlying model structure and assumptions should be revisited. We note that inaccuracies in the surveillance and reporting system may result in suboptimal policies, emphasizing the tremendous importance of public health surveillance for the effective management of epidemics.",

To find the optimal school closure duration for a given value of WTP, we define a finite number of intervals {[t S,i , t E,i ]|t S,i , t E,i \u2208 {0, 7, 14, 28,\u2026, 350}, t E,i > t S,i } and, for each static policy [t S,i , t E,i ], use Monte Carlo simulation to estimate the expected total loss in the population's NHB.

This algorithm searches for the policy with minimum expected loss in the population's NHB. To choose between two policies with statistically indifferent performance, the algorithm selects the policy with less uncertainty around the estimated performance. It is straightforward to see that the policy selected as optimal by this algorithm is unique independent of how policies are initially ordered. \"Actions\" to control the epidemic are chosen at \"Decision Points\" (e.g. every week). The action in effect during a decision period impacts the epidemiological \"Events\" (e.g. new infections or hospitalizations) that may occur during this period. These events may generate \"Observations\" which can be used by the decision maker to form an epidemic \"History\" at the beginning of each decision point. A dynamic policy uses this history to inform which actions to implement during the next period.

Therefore, p i (t) is equal to:To calculate the probability \u03c6 i,j (t), first note that a random susceptible person will contact n individuals during the interval [t, t+\u0394t], where n has Poisson distribution with rate \u039b\u0304i\u0394T = \u0394T \u03a3 i\u2032 \u039b i,i\u2032 . The number of infective persons, m, among these n individuals has binomial distribution (n, p i (t)); and finally, the susceptible person may become infected if the contact with at least one of these j individuals results in infection (so the probability that the susceptible person becomes infected is one minus the probability that none of the interactions with infectives results in infection).
