We aimed to explore the association between RV molecular subtyping, nasopharyngeal viral loads and viremia with childhood pneumonia. Nasopharyngeal and blood samples from cases and controls were tested for RV and the 5\u2032 non-coding region sequenced. The cases compared to controls had a similar prevalence of RV detection in the nasopharynx (23 % vs. 22 %, P = 0.66), similar RV species distribution (A, B, C = 44 %, 8%, 44 % vs. 48 %, 7%, 38 %; respectively; P = 0.66) and similar viral load (4.0 and 3.7 log10 copies/mL, P = 0.062). However, RV-viremia was 4.01-fold (aOR 95 % CI: 1.26-12.78) more prevalent among cases (7%) than controls (2%), P = 0.019. Furthermore, among cases and controls RV-C was more commonly associated with viremia (14 % and 4%, P = 0.023), than RV-A (2% and 1%; P = 0.529). Thus RV-viremia could be used as a measure for attributing causality to RV in children hospitalized for pneumonia.",

Briefly, pneumonia cases were children aged 1-59 months hospitalized with World Health Organization (WHO)-defined pneumonia (according to the pre-2013 definitions) [17, 18] . Prior to enrolment, cases received a bronchodilator challenge in order to exclude cases with hyper-reactive airway. Controls were enrolled from the same community as cases and were matched 1:1 to cases on age-group frequency and HIV-status. The community controls were invited to present at the day-clinic for sample collection and clinical evaluation. The controls could have signs and symptoms of respiratory illness as long as they did not fulfil the criteria for severe pneumonia.",

Furthermore, the molecular subtyping of the RV-positive study participants was similar between cases and controls, thus highlighting the need for additional techniques for determining the true etiological role of RV in disease. We did, however, observe a 4-fold difference in RV-viremia between these two groups (7% vs. 2% in cases and controls, respectively) regardless of the small sample size. These findings could indicate an attributable role of RV infection in the pathogenesis of pneumonia, albeit lower than would have been imputed solely based on RV nasopharyngeal positivity in cases.

            "text": "Over-attribution of pneumonia etiology to RV could, however, be partly mitigated by the use of RV-viremia detection, or nasopharyngeal RV load density as a relative proxy for RV viraemia, with a threshold density of \u22654log 10 copies/mL significantly discriminating between RVviremic and non-viraemic cases. Additionally, the detection rates of RV-C viremia were higher than both RV-A and RV-B; in fact, no RV-B viremia cases were detected which is in line with other studies which have also failed to detect viremia due to RV-B [13, 14, 22, 26] . This could be related to the much lower prevalence of RV-B in the population (9% among cases and 8% among controls), but strongly supports evidence to the hypothesis that RV-B might have lower pathogenicity than RV-A and RV-C [27] [28] [29] . The correlation between viremia and high viral loads found in this study concurs with a previous Italian study. They postulated that high viral loads were a prerequisite for viremia, and that viremia was associated with more severe disease [13] . However, in our study, no positive correlations were found between RV nasopharyngeal viral loads and RV-viremia with markers for more severe disease. In fact those with RV-viremia had shorter hospital stays compared to the non-viremia cases. All of the children in this study were hospitalized with severe or very-severe pneumonia whereas the Italian study was conducted in children with both upper and lower respiratory tract which could account for the differences seen in the association of RV-viremia with more severe disease outcomes. Further; the RV-viremia detection rate in our study (7%) was lower than reported in previous studies (11 %-12 %) [13, 14, 22] , although all of the cited studies were conducted in children less than 14 years of age hospitalized with upper or lower RTI; whereas, we only enrolled children 1-59 months of age hospitalized with pneumonia. In a study from Greece [14] , 11 % of hospitalized RV nasopharyngeal positive children had RV-viremia, the majority (70 %) of the RV-viremia positive cases presented with asthma exacerbations, whilst no RV-viremia cases were detected among children hospitalized with RV-associated pneumonia. Similarly, in the Philippines study [22] , the majority (73 %) of the RV-viremia positive cases were in children presenting with wheezing disease. Thus the low viremia detection rates reported in our study could be related to cases receiving a bronchodilator challenge prior to enrolment, which sought to exclude children with responsive hyperactive airway disease from being enrolled. Importantly, none of the above-mentioned studies enrolled controls. In our study, viremia and high RV loads was seen among both cases and controls indicating the need for inclusion of controls in epidemiology studies on the role of RV in the pathogenesis of pneumonia. Of the four controls positive for RV-viremia, one had an upper RTI and the remaining three were asymptomatic at the time of sampling. However, RV-viremia has been described to be mainly detected during the early stages of disease symptomatology [14] , and the viral load of RV was substantially higher among our controls with RV-viremia. Thus the three RV-viremia positive controls could have been in the incubation period of illness at the time of sampling. One of the limitations of our study was that controls were not systematically followed up post sampling, hence we were unable to confirm that these children did not subsequently develop pneumonia that required hospitalization. A Finnish case-control study which enrolled asymptomatic controls in addition to cases with acute expiratory wheezing, observed that 38 % of the RV positive controls developed respiratory symptoms within the week following sampling [30] . Nevertheless, the detection of RV-viremia among community controls, even at the very low prevalence seen in our study was unexpected, and further highlights the challenges of defining the etiological role of RV in the pathogenesis of pneumonia. Study limitations included the cross-sectional study design which precluded us from studying the viral load over time and in relation to the onset of disease. Further, almost 50 % of cases had more than one virus detected thus we were unable to determine which virus or combination of viruses were the cause of the disease episode as there is no gold standard when it comes to diagnosing pneumonia. Additionally, the small sample size of RV-viremia positive cases and controls could have limited our power to discern clinical severity differences. Future studies will need to look at characterizing the RV molecular epidemiology and presence of viremia at the remaining 6 PERCH sites in Africa and Southeast Asia. Further, the RV typing method used in this study targeted the non-coding region (NCR) which has been shown to have a higher sensitivity for typing in clinical samples [21, 22] ; however, the NCR is less conserved thus sequencing of the conserved capsid region to confirm the RV-C typing would be beneficial in order to study the importance of RV species in severe disease in greater detail.",
