The industry includes the buying, selling and management of services and products (to tourists) that might range from buying hotel rooms to selling souvenirs or managing an airline. To accomplish these complex activities, the tourism industry demands the most creative and innovative managers because tourism represents one of the most perishable of products. If hotel rooms, airline seats, cruise ship births or restaurant tables are not filled daily and repeatedly, the point-of-sale moments to generate revenue from these 'products' are gone forever. There is no opportunity to put such unsold products on sale at a later time, in storage or in inventory (Figure 1.1) .",

These products are also 'assistance goods' used by the tourism industry. In addition to agricultural products, airplanes must be produced, computer reservation systems developed, steel and concrete manufactured and hotels constructed.

The policymakers, planning officials and stakeholders must identify the emerging trends in tourism and orchestrate new measures that lead to orderly growth and quality products that benefit tourists and communities. Unfortunately, in the past, many governments have not given the tourism industry the same concern given to manufactured goods or other service industries. In part due to the terrorists' attacks on the United States on 11 September 2001, and tragedies elsewhere, this attitude is now changing globally. News of conflicts, terrorism, health concerns, natural disasters and weather conditions in many different countries throughout the world often bring the tourism industry to the forefront. The Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) epidemic and concerns about avian influenza have taken their toll on tourism, along with earthquakes, hurricanes, tsunamis and other disasters. The escalation of petroleum prices, difficulties in the world economy and adjustments to new technologies are affecting the tourism industry in unprecedented ways.

In the twenty-first century, we are deep into the services revolution that is changing the way we live and evaluate the world's wealth and economy. An ever-expanding world of innovation has already provided us with multi-use telephones, e-commerce tools within computer technology, digital cameras, high-definition television and practical applications of satellite technology. In this bright new world, we have found another major growth service sector -sometimes referred to as an 'invisible' or 'intangible' activity: tourism. This growing service industry embraces technology in its widespread use of e-commerce tools, for its applications to new products such as space and undersea tourism and for developing new methods of marketing and promotion. The tourism industry has become one of the most dynamic industries throughout the globe as it adapts to technological change, product innovations and new markets. Managing sustainable tourism in today's world adds an important dimension to the growth of the tourism industry. The policies we set for tourism in an ever-changing world will direct the courses of action for the travel and tourism industry in the future. This book is an effort to meet this challenge and provide policy and planning solutions for the orderly growth and development of tourism and add to its sustainability.",

            "text": "A look at travel and tourism within this context mandates that policymakers must understand the need for developing wide-ranging strategies, adjusted as conditions fluctuate or mature. Policymakers must be knowledgeable about market trends and flexible enough to adjust strategic plans in the face of rapidly changing market forces. In summary, policymaking within the new tourism horizon must fully encompass the complex nature of tourism and the far-reaching mechanics of its implementation. Tourism policy and planning will drive the appropriate management techniques and tools essential for meeting emerging trends. This transformation must take place in a new world of globalization and competition, in which, at the same time, the world's population and economies are changing. New technology (particularly in communications and transportation), barriers to travel, political relations and many other factors will affect tourism policy and planning in the future. Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary (2007) has defined policy as 'A definite course or method of action selected from among alternatives and in light of given conditions to guide and determine present and future decisions'. The popular tourism textbook Tourism: Principles, Practices, Philosophies (Goeldner & Ritchie, 2006) defined tourism policy by stating, 'Tourism policy can be defined as a set of regulations, rules, guidelines, directives, and development/promotion objectives and strategies that provide a framework within which the collective and individual decisions directly affecting long-term tourism development and the daily activities within a destination are taken'. This definition is highly useful in most circumstances. Another useful discussion of tourism policy is contained in a new tourism book titled Travel and Tourism: An Industry Primer. Biederman (2007) adds importantly to the definition of tourism policy the following thoughts, 'A tourism policy defines the direction or course of action that a particular country, region, locality or an individual destination plans to take when developing or promoting tourism. The key principle for any tourism policy is that it should ensure that the nation (region or locality) would benefit to the maximum extent possible from the economic and social contributions of tourism. The ultimate objective of a tourism policy is to improve the progress of the nation (region or locality) and the lives of its citizens'.",

This definition acknowledges the important role marketing, product development and hospitality services play in tourism policy.

The political aspects of tourism are interwoven with its economic consequences tourism is not only a continuation of politics but also an integral part of the world's political economy. In short, tourism is, or can be, a tool used not only for economic but for political means'. Fayos-Sol\u00e0 (1996) suggested a more balanced role in tourism policymaking between the private, public and voluntary sectors.

Shorter working hours in some cases, greater individual prosperity, faster and cheaper travel, more destinations to choose from and the impact of advanced technology have all helped to make the leisure and travel industry one of the fastest growing industries in the world. The significance of tourism as a viable source of income and employment, and as a major factor in the balance of payments for many countries has been attracting increasing attention on the part of governments, regional and local authorities and others with an interest in economic development. Furthermore, sustainable tourism concerns for the environment, social conditions and other concepts have entered the decision-making process and will forever change the way tourism grows throughout the world. (This is discussed in some detail with respect to sustainable tourism in Chapter 6.) New research by the World Travel and Tourism Council (Navigating the Path Ahead, 2007) estimates that tourism in 2007 will generate direct and induced employment for approximately 231.2 million people worldwide, or 1 in every 12 jobs. By 2017, it is predicted that employment will be approximately 262.6 million jobs, or 1 in every 12 jobs. According to the report, global tourism in 2007 (both domestic and international) is approximately a US $7.1 trillion industry that will continue to grow in the future, reaching US $13.2 trillion in 2017. Equally important is the fact that tourism, as an export, is of critical importance to both industrialized and developing nations. As an economic factor, tourism is growing faster than the rest of the world economy in terms of export, output, value added, capital investment and employment. (See Chapter 4 for a complete discussion of the economics of tourism.) While tourism has been growing rapidly since World War II and will continue its dynamic growth into the future, this does not mean the industry will grow smoothly. As evidenced, there will be occasional structural, economic, political, environmental, social and conceptual impediments in its path. An example of this was the severe decline in travel worldwide at the start of the Persian Gulf War in 1991. Mediterranean destinations, North America and parts of Asia, far from the war zone and Middle East conflicts, were all affected. Coupled with this is the public's and, in some cases, governments' inadequate understanding of the economic, environmental and social importance of tourism and low levels of access to current information about tourism affairs. At the same time, however, the global importance of tourism is becoming better understood because, in many geographic areas, tourism is replacing other industries that have traditionally been the paramount economic drivers. This, in turn, necessitates better tourism research, policy and planning to support this momentum.",

One of their shared goals is to link tourism to other sectors of the international economy. The European Community, North America Free Trade Agreement and other regional economic instruments are seeking to break down traditional barriers for conducting tourism services across borders, which will ultimately aid international tourism. The World Travel and Tourism Council (London), the Pacific Asia Travel Association (Bangkok), the Southeast Tourism Society (Atlanta) and other groups representing mainly private interests and some public concerns are already establishing a higher level of cooperation and coalition building to tackle broad policy issues.

Marketing a destination, complicated by the difficult supply characteristics of the industry, needs careful planning at the outset. It should operate under a coordinated tourism policy so that the many suppliers and promotion organizations can work well together. Bull, who reported on the state of London, England's tourism policy, studied Bull (1997) highlighted the challenges associated with the long-term impact of short-term changes in the city's marketing programs and concluded that for long-term sustainability, infrastructural and facility issues needed more attention. One conclusion drawn from this analysis is that tourism is far more than just marketing, and that tourism policy should address a multitude of tourism concerns. Opponents of tourism often cite the negative impacts an influx of visitors might have on the destination, and there is a need to have a policy that recognizes these concerns, but, of course, the positive impacts should be equally important to policymakers and practitioners. Understanding both positive and negative impacts will lead to practical sustainable tourism development. When the negative impacts on the local environment are addressed, corrected and managed well by the host community, and the positive attributes built upon, tourism becomes an important driving force in community development. The benefits derived from visitors bear repeating: creating new jobs, spawning new businesses, adding new products, generating additional income, promoting economic integration and diversifying the local economy.",

A second scenario deals with environmental use/overuse, such as the ongoing debates regarding the permissibility of winter snowmobiling in Yosemite National Park in the United States. In the past, very little comprehensive research has been conducted to clearly define best practices for economic, environmental and social impacts on tourism.

            "text": "The tourism business is now, perhaps, the largest industry on earth. When strategically well planned and executed, tourism provides an economic stream both into and within a community, and an incentive to preserve the best features a community, or destination, has to offer, from its wildlife habitats, its historic districts, its scenery, to its local culture and heritage. Properly integrated, tourism can provide an improved quality of life for the community. In this particular case study, tourism can also be seen as a major driver for Kansas' new brand image: \"Kansas, As Big As You Think\". Tourism impacts greatly on the economy of many communities in Kansas. It can be a valuable industry, producing income, creating jobs, spurring economic development, promoting economic diversification, developing new products, growing more businesses, adding tax revenue and contributing to economic integration. Kansas is also committed to a broad-based tourism product that will provide its citizens with a higher quality of life while it generates sustained environmental benefits for the state. Tourism is heavily dependent on information and communication through traditional systems, effective application of new e-commerce tools and responding to travel trends and niche travel. Transportation modesmotor coaches or trains, airlines and rental cars, recreation vehicles, or (as is most dominant in Kansas) the automobile -present a variety of economic opportunities. Infrastructure, ranging from airports, highways and byways, restaurants and hotels, spas and resorts, bed and breakfast establishments, campgrounds and hunting lodges, Native American casinos, and the list goes on, provide diverse tourism opportunities. Public recreation lands, inclusive of local, state and national parks, are increasingly important in the development of new tourism products. Agritourism, ecotourism, rural tourism, adventure travel, geotourism, historic site visitation and built attractions are all part of the tourism phenomenon. Ultimately, the key to a successful program is an effective and efficient strategic plan that includes a marketing approach and that recognizes the great diversity of the tourism products in Kansas. However, in the eyes of the consumer, the great variety of Kansas tourism may not be well known.",

Ecotourism is a market trend that Kansas can capitalize on by highlighting more strongly its natural and geographical assets and its abundance of flora and fauna.

In the July/August 2005 issue of the National Geographic Traveler (the most read travel magazine), the National Geographic Society's Office of Sustainable Tourism published a rating by a panel of experts of National Parks in Canada and the United States that included The Tallgrass Prairie National Preserve, which received a good rating. In the March/April 2005 issue of Midwest Living, a magazine important to Midwest travelers, a section called \"30 Things Every Midwesterner Should Experience\" refers to The Tallgrass Prairie National Preserve in these words: \"Smell the lush stinging wetness of a storm rumbling across a wide-open sky from amid undulating green-golden grasses in the Kansas Flint Hills. This is North America's largest expanse of native tallgrass prairie, and it has an unforgettable sense of place that blends powerful sky, dramatic land and stirring moments\". (Author's note: Also of interest is the article \"Splendor of the Grass\" in the April 2007 issue of National Geographic. This article says, \"The prairie's grip is unbroken in the Flint Hills of Kansas . Much that remains of this once vast ecosystem lies here in the Flint Hills, saved from the plow by stubborn layers of stone jutting rawboned through thin soil . The hard part here in the Flint Hills -and in any of the few remaining patches of native prairie -is learning to see the tallgrass ecosystem for itself . Learn it well enough and you begin to suspect that grasses are what hold this world together.\") A TIA study (sponsored by Smithsonian Magazine, 2003) titled The Historic/Cultural Traveler identified another major trend in tourism in this way: \"Cultural, arts, historic, and heritage activities or events are quite popular among US travelers today. In fact, most US adults (81 per cent) who took at least one trip of 50 miles or more, one way, away from home in the past year included at least one such activity or event while traveling This represents over 118 million adult historic/cultural travelers\". Such a trend is another opportunity for Kansas tourism. Kansas is historically and culturally rich, with interesting small towns and communities and many special local museums and art galleries. The Native American history and culture throughout the state offers an abundance of special tourism product opportunities, along with historic themes including life on the prairie, heritage connected to the Civil War, the unique Eisenhower Museum, air and space museums, the birthplace of Amelia Earhart and much more.",

This research is contained in a report titled Competitiveness in Rural US Regions: Learning and Research Agenda by Michael E.

The report states, \"Many experts highlight the common misperception that agriculture is the dominant source of employment and income in rural economies.

The study includes a \"Cluster Mapping Project\" -clusters consist of related industries within a sector that are prone to co-locate. The traded clusters with the highest absolute level of employment in rural regions were hospitality and tourism, food processing, heavy construction services, automotive, metal manufacturing and business services. The study indicates that \"rural tourism\" in its broadest sense includes scenic beauty as well as special clusters like the \"California Wine Cluster\" that includes a \"tourism cluster\".

Target marketing is a key to a successful tourism marketing program. The basic tenet of target marketing is that few destination areas are universally acceptable and desired by the tourist. Therefore, instead of wasting valuable resources on trying to please all travelers, the Kansas tourism industry should \"target\" highly identified prospects specifically and cater to their wants and needs. One of the early steps in marketing, then, is to divide the present and potential market on the basis of meaningful characteristics and concentrate marketing, promotion and product development on serving the most likely parts of the market -the target markets. Ruf Strategic Solutions, under contract by KTTDD, is probably the best tourism target marketing firm in the nation. This firm has a system that can profile almost any potential visitor within the United States. Their profile system includes geographic, demographic (age, sex, income, education, etc.), socioeconomic, psychographic and behaviour patterns, in addition to many other characteristics of the potential visitor.",

However, due to the nature of the tourism product, there are six additional Ps -partnership, packaging, programming, positioning, people and planning -that should be integrated. The 2004-2005 marketing of Kansas tourism includes a number of changes and new directions. In addition to traditional marketing efforts, KTTDD is \"marketing\" the new Kansas brand image, \"Kansas, As Big As You Think\". To get this message across, to the wide spectrum of audience within Kansas and throughout the United States, will require some innovative marketing and special packaging.",

With a very limited budget, the KTTDD has to be selective in choosing activities it can engage in to support the tourism industry in Kansas, and is finding that it must develop, form and participate in joint partnerships with other agencies and the private sector. Nevertheless, the division has taken a key leadership role in conducting the necessary tourism research and proposing product development opportunities and marketing strategies. This puts the KTTDD in a position to \"make or break\" the efforts for growing tourism in Kansas. Members of the greater private sector in Kansas need to take advantage of the work of the KTTDD as they move on their own agendas. Some of the larger tourism-related corporations, such as Cabela's and the Kansas Speedway, need constant reminders that they, too, are part of the overall tourism strategy for the state, even if they can financially survive with little or no help from the KTTDD. Their cooperation is needed in stimulating other areas of the state, which ultimately will benefit their companies as well. An obvious key player on the tourism team is the Kansas Department of Transportation. Tourists love maps, depend on good roads and will not find what they are looking for without good signage. However, much of what the Department of Transportation can do depends on a tripartite involvement. First, the community needs to identify the tourism products to be promoted and provide the necessary supply side facilities of good local roads, signage, restrooms and other tourist needs. Secondly, in this process the community needs to work hand-in-glove with the KTTDD and other state agencies. Finally, as the local marketing plan is evolving, other infrastructure players are drawn in, including not only transportation, but sewage, water supply and other facilities.",

But there are many other stakeholders: private citizens, local governments, private businesses, economic, as well as environmental, social, and other groups that must all be involved in the process. Ultimately and ideally, a framework for public/private discussions is created that addresses the important tourism policy questions of taxation, financing, transportation, regulatory practices, environmental practices, human resources, community relationships, technology, marketing practices and the many other aspects of the tourism industry.",

This shortened version (which contains modifications from the original document) illustrates only the research phase necessary to develop a strategic planning document to support changes or modifications in a tourism policy. (While it demonstrates some of the ingredients needed to fashion a state tourism policy based on strategic planning, it is not indicative of the full process for constructing a tourism policy or planning model.) As a guideline for this project, a \"Strategic Plan Development Flow Chart\"(Figure 1.10) was constructed, but not followed in every detail. (It can be seen at the end of this case study.)",

Tourism development for the State of Kansas has many positive attributes, especially with respect to its particular combination of natural, scenic, historical, archaeological, cultural and heritage attractions. As already established herein, tourism is a growth industry, and while growth may show some slowing in the short term, the longterm prospects are good, with expected growth based on continuously rising per capita incomes, lower travel costs, increased leisure time and changes in consumers' tastes and preferences toward travel, recreation and leisure goods and services. While tourism has many positive attributes for a community, it should not be regarded as a panacea for all the area's development problems. Arguments for developing and promoting tourism in Kansas include the following:",
