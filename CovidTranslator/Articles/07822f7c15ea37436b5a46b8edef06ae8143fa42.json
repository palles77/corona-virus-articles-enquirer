If PCR reveals the presence of RNA derived from respiratory syncytial virus, human metapneumovirus, parainfluenza virus, or influenza virus, then an acute infection caused by the corresponding pathogen is probably present, and further treatment can be given accordingly. On the other hand, the nucleic acids of adeno-, boca-, rhinoor coronaviruses can be found in relatively trivial infections as well as in asymptomatic persons, probably reflecting either a prior infection or a current subclinical one. For children in particular, upper respiratory infections are so common in the winter months that acute and prior infections with these pathogens cannot be distinguished by multiplex PCR. The use of multiplex PCR in children has not been shown to shorten hospital stays or to lessen antibiotic consumption or overall cost.",

In view of 20 or more potential pathogens, investigations using specific polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for individual viruses (\"monoplex-PCR\") are soon too time-consuming and elaborate for the laboratory. Multiplex-PCR methods enable testing for many pathogens in parallel in a single analysis and are therefore increasingly gaining in importance, since the required specimen volume, time expense, and cost expenditure hardly differ from monoplex-PCR, even though 20 or more different pathogens are analyzed simultaneously. This review article is restricted to multiplex-PCR and aims to summarize the current research status for multiplex-PCR for clinicians who treat pediatric outpatients and inpatients.",

However, studies have shown a lower sensitivity for individual pathogens-for example, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), human metapneumovirus (hMPV), and enteroviruses (8, 9) .

Suitable specimens to confirm respiratory pathogens can be obtained from the upper or lower respiratory tract-that is, nasopharyngeal aspirate, pharyngeal swabs, nasopharyngeal swabs, or bronchoalveolar lavage fluid. The confirmation frequency of pathogens in children with acute respiratory symptoms may be in excess of 80%. In adults it is notably lower, with only 20% in some studies (10, 11) . One of the reasons for this may be the fact that children have much higher viral titers. Furthermore, in view of the fact that respiratory tract infections in children occur in close succession during the winter season, it can be assumed that infections actually overlap. This may provide an explanation for the fact that viral nucleic acids of different viruses in one specimen are found virtually only in children-for example, in 8% of all specimens analyzed by the authors of this article (12) . Table 1 summarizes taxonomic characteristics, typical disease patterns, and specific treatment for selected respiratory viruses.

Furthermore, RSV causes apnea in neonates and young infants, even if patients had received prophylactic treatment with palivizumab (e4).

Bronchiolitis is a clinical diagnosis with respiratory failure and obstruction of the small airways. Many study authors recommend refraining from routine diagnostic evaluation (for example, microbiological testing, radiography of the thorax, and blood gas analyses) in children with bronchiolitis since these impose physical stress and lead to unnecessary inpatient admissions and treatment (13) (14) (15) (16) (17) (18) .

The Robert Koch-Institute regards PCR as the gold standard for the diagnostic evaluation of Chlamydophila pneumoniae (e11) . Fewer than 2% of infections with Legionella spp. manifest in childhood or adolescence, overwhelmingly in the first year of life and in teenagers (e12) . The Robert Koch-Institute attests extraordinarily high sensitivity to PCR techniques for the confirmation of legionella bacteria from respiratory secretions and tissues, even though culture is still regarded as the gold standard (e13) . The sensitivity of the widely used rapid urine antigen test depends on the severity of disease and the serotype (e14, e15).

Generally, multiplex-PCR should be used whenever consequences for the treatment will result-for example, stopping a course of antibiotic treatment. So far, there are no algorithms for such an approach that have been validated in practice. The authors recommend the use of multiplex-PCR especially in the first months of life, in children with risk factors for influenza, and in immunosuppressed patients (for example, patients who have undergone an allogeneic stem cell transplant), as clinical consequences are more likely to be concluded from the results in such patients ( Table 2) .

Confirmed DNA from hMPV, influenzavirus, parainfluenza virus, or RSV enables conclusions about the causative pathogen The molecular confirmation of these four pathogens should always raise suspicions of infections in the more distant past that may not be directly related to the patient's current symptoms. This fact is important especially in small children, since they contract multiple infections in one winter season, some of which will have a short latency period between episodes of illness. Rhedin et al. showed that the nucleic acids of RSV, hMPV, and parainfluenza virus can be confirmed almost exclusively in symptomatic children and very rarely in asymptomatic children (33) . A causal association between respiratory tract symptoms and the confirmation of RSV, hMPV, and parainfluenza virus therefore seems likely. In the same study, rhinovirus DNA was confirmed in 47.9% of symptomatic children, but also in 21.5% of the control group (33).",

Oosterheert et al showed that the confirmation rate for infections of the lower respiratory tract in adults increased from 21% to 43% if quantitative PCR for respiratory pathogens is used, rather than conventional diagnostic tests. However, this study did not show any reduction in antibiotics or in costs (37) . One limitation of the study is the fact that it dates back to 2005. The costs then incurred for PCR diagnostics, of 330.78 Euro/specimen, have been notably reduced since then (37) .",

In the intervention group, clinicians were told the results within 12-36 hours after specimens had been taken, and in the control group, this was done after four weeks. RSV was the most common pathogen, at 55%. The average length of hospital stay and the duration of antibiotic therapy did not differ between groups. The intervention group, however, showed a significantly higher use of antibiotics. The reasons for this effect remain unclear, because the decision in favor of or against intravenous antibiotics was made on the basis of clinical assessment and before the PCR results were known. Since this study-and other, similar ones-excluded children with underlying diseases from participation, the results apply only to children who were previously healthy.",
