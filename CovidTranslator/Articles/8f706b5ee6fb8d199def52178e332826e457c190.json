The biogenesis and three-dimensional organization of these membranes and the link between replication and virus assembly sites is not fully clear. Using electron microscopy, we find Dengue virus (DENV)-induced vesicles, convoluted membranes, and virus particles to be endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-derived, and we detect double-stranded RNA, a presumed marker of RNA replication, inside virusinduced vesicles. Electron tomography (ET) shows DENV-induced membrane structures to be part of one ER-derived network. Furthermore, ET reveals vesicle pores that could enable release of newly synthesized viral RNA and reveals budding of DENV particles on ER membranes directly apposed to vesicle pores. Thus, DENV modifies ER membrane structure to promote replication and efficient encapsidation of the genome into progeny virus. This architecture of DENV replication and assembly sites could explain the coordination of distinct steps of the flavivirus replication cycle.",

            "text": "DENV is a flavivirus: a genus that comprises over 70 viruses, many of which are arthropod borne. Flavivirus particles contain a lipid envelope and an inner nucleocapsid composed of capsid protein and a single-stranded, positive-sense RNA genome (Cleaves and Dubin, 1979) . During infection, the viral RNA is translated into a polyprotein, which is co-and posttranslationally cleaved by cellular and viral proteases into the structural proteins C, prM, and E and seven nonstructural (NS) proteins (NS1, NS2A, NS2B, NS3, NS4A, NS4B, and NS5) (reviewed in Bartenschlager and Miller, 2008; Murray et al., 2008) . The structural capsid (C), membrane (M), and envelope (E) proteins are components of extracellular mature virus particles; NS proteins are expressed within the infected host cell but are not detectable in virions. They are thought to be involved in DENV genome replication, which occurs in close association with cellular membranes. NS3 and its cofactor, NS2B, are involved in processing of the viral polyprotein. NS3 also has RNA helicase and nucleotide triphosphatase activity. NS5 has RNA-dependent RNA polymerase activity and is involved in capping of progeny viral RNA genomes. The role of NS1 in RNA replication is not fully understood. Little is known about functions of the hydrophobic proteins NS2A, NS4A, and NS4B, but several studies suggest that they may anchor the viral replicase proteins to cellular membranes (Chambers et al., 1989) and contribute to virion assembly (Kummerer and Rice, 2002; Leung et al., 2008) and to inhibition of IFNa/b response (Mu\u00f1 oz-Jordan et al., 2003) . Finally, NS4A potentially plays a role in induction of membrane alterations, assumed to serve as a scaffold for the formation of the viral replicase complex Roosendaal et al., 2006) .",

RCs may promote efficient viral replication by anchoring the replication machinery in membrane compartments or by shielding it off from host defense mechanisms (Netherton et al., 2007; Novoa et al., 2005) . Electron microscopy (EM) showed that DENV induces membrane alterations of various morphologies, including convoluted membranes (CM) and vesicle packets (VPs) (Grief et al., 1997) . Immuno-EM studies indicated that VP and CM may represent the site of DENV replication and RNA translation/polyprotein processing, respectively (Mackenzie et al., 1996) . Light microscopy studies showed that NS proteins localize to cytosolic, virusinduced structures (Kapoor et al., 1995; Miller et al., 2006 Miller et al., , 2007 Umareddy et al., 2006) also positive for double-stranded RNA (dsRNA).",

We extended this observation by raising rabbit antisera monospecific for NS1, NS2B, NS3, NS4A, NS4B, and NS5 that were tested for light microscopy analysis of DENV-infected cells (Figures 1, S1 , and S2). All antibodies displayed a distinct labeling pattern that was not seen in uninfected cells ( Figure S1 ). This pattern, exemplified by the NS2Bspecific labeling, consisted of cytoplasmic dot-like structures in the perinuclear area of the cell (Figure 1 ). They colocalized with dsRNA, a generally accepted marker for the (presumed) intermediates during DENV RNA replication ( Figures 1D and  1E ). An exception was NS5, which in agreement with previous reports (Buckley et al., 1992; Kapoor et al., 1995; Miller et al., 2006) localized predominantly to the nucleus of infected cells. However, biochemical fractionation experiments show that up to 30% of NS5 is in the cytosol and about 70% in the nuclear fraction (data not shown), arguing that cytosolic NS5 is poorly accessible to the used antibodies (but still detectable; see below). Thus, DENV NS proteins localize to conspicuous cytosolic structures that likely correspond to the site of viral replication.",

NS3-specific antiserum specifically labeled DMVs, into which ER cisternae extended ( Figure 3A ), and CM ( Figure 3B ). Since NS3 has helicase activity that is essential for RNA replication (Matusan et al., 2001 ) the localization of NS3 suggests that it is an integral part of the viral RC. Dilated ER cisternae packed with particles of $45 nm were readily seen at the periphery of labeled structures ( Figure 3C ). These particles were not labeled with the NS3-specific antiserum ( Figure 3C ) but with a monoclonal antibody to the DENV E glycoprotein, confirming that they were newly assembled virions ( Figure 3D ). Whereas the anti-E antibody also labeled the ER (data not shown), it did not significantly label the vesicles or the CM ( Figures 3D and 3E ). The antibody also revealed single virus particles in the lumen of ER cisternae that were typically located between the vesicles rather than at their periphery ( Figure 3E ; see below). Antibodies against other NS proteins (NS4A, NS4B, NS1, NS2B, and NS5) also showed specific labeling of the vesicles, although weaker than for NS3 arrowheads) . While this suggested that the CM labeled with NS3 only, a lower affinity of the antibodies or poor accessibility of the other NS proteins in the CM cannot be excluded. DsRNA was found as a discrete electron-dense structure inside ( Figure 4F ) or on the cytosolic surface of a subset of vesicles ( Figure 4G ), suggesting that dsRNA is present only in some of the vesicles at a given time point. The electron density detected along with the immuno gold labeling most likely is due to uranyl acetate that was used to contrast the labeled cryosections, although we cannot exclude the possibility that its formation was linked to the use of the dsRNA-specific antibody. However, uranyl acetate binds to phosphate groups present in nucleic acids, supporting the notion that the dsRNA-specific antibody indeed detected viral RNA.",

In contrast, vesicles, CM, and the cisternae found in their close proximity were clearly and specifically labeled for the ER markers PDI and calnexin ( Figures 5A, 5B , and S4). The PDI labeling of the vesicles was relatively low compared to the ER labeling, suggesting that this protein may be partially excluded from these virus-induced membrane structures. Calnexin, in contrast, seemed enriched on the CM compared to the ER, while it was less abundant in vesicles. Finally, the limiting membrane of the dilated virus-containing cisternae and their lumen was labeled for calnexin ( Figure 5B , arrowheads) and PDI ( Figure 5A , arrowheads), respectively, defining this compartment as ER-derived. Thus, the vesicles, CM, and virus-harboring cisternae are derived from the ER.

Virus particles had an average outer diameter of 45.1 nm (\u00b1 2.7 nm, n = 56). Close inspection of the vesicles in 3D revealed that the inner vesicle membrane was often continuous with the outer ER membrane, connecting the lumen to the cytosol via a pore-like opening. Thus, the vesicles appeared as invaginations of the ER rather than as sealed single-membrane vesicles (Figures 7A-7C and 7E, white arrowheads). The membrane invaginations were seen irrespective of the sample preparation protocol (Figures S3A 0 -S3C 0 , white arrowheads), but their visibility depended on the orientation of membranes perpendicular to the x-y plane of tomographic slices and was frequently hampered by a diffuse electron density at the cytosolic side of the vesicle pore ( Figures 7A, 7B , and 7E). Upon Gaussian filtering of the 3D images, 58.2% (\u00b1 7.1%, n = 264) of the vesicles that were fully included in the volumes of ten different tomograms were found to display a pore and to be continuous with ER membranes ( Figure S3 ). Each vesicle contained only one such pore, further suggesting that their inner membrane is an invagination of the ER membrane. Consequently, the lumen of most if not all of these virus-induced vesicles is topologically identical to and open toward the cytosol. Analysis of pores that were readily visible without filtering revealed that they were almost round and had an average maximum width of 11.2 nm (\u00b1 1.6 nm, n = 27). Thus, both the topology of the vesicle interior and the immunolabeling results are consistent with the conclusion that the vesicles are the site of viral RNA replication. Likewise, the size All NS antibodies specifically label vesicles (arrowheads). Note that the virions (Vi) in (A) are not labeled with anti-NS4A and that the dsRNA-specific antibody (F and G) labels a discrete electron-dense structure located within (F) or outside (G) the vesicles. of the pore would allow release of viral RNA genomes to be used for RNA translation and virus assembly.",

The cytosolic space between the pores and opposed membranes was frequently filled with a diffuse electron-dense material (most obvious in Figures 7A, 7B , 7F, and 7H, white arrowheads). The ER/NE lumen directly opposite the vesicle pores often displayed small membrane invaginations (Figures 7D, 7E , and 7G and Movie S3, small arrows), which had a slightly bigger diameter (about 60 nm) than virions and contained a distinct electron density, indicating that they represented virus budding sites ( Figures 7D, 7E , and 7G, small arrows). These putative budding sites were always found in close proximity to single enveloped virus particles inside the ER lumen ( Figures  7B and 7I and Movie S3, black arrowheads), further suggesting that virus budding occurs on ER membranes in close proximity to the vesicle ''pores.'' Three-dimensional surface rendering of the ER and its associated membranes ( Figure 7J and Movie S4) illustrates the above findings: a portion of the ER lumen (yellow) encloses numerous densely packed vesicles (light brown) and is tightly apposed to another ER/NE membrane (yellow, semi-transparent; only the outer NE membrane is displayed). This opposed ER/NE lumen contains single virus particles (red) and, in addition, displays a putative virus budding site (small arrow). Additional virus particles are found in more peripheral segments of the ER that are oriented toward the Golgi stack or in single vesicles in the periphery of the Golgi complex.

Induction of such membrane structures that most likely serve as a scaffold for the assembly of viral RCs has been described for virtually all groups of positivestrand RNA viruses, but their architecture and origin differ among various virus groups (reviewed in Salonen et al., 2005) . The positive immunolabeling for PDI and calnexin (immuno-EM) as well as CLIMP63 (Miller et al., 2006) shows that the DENV-induced membrane structures are derived from the rough ER. Immunofluorescence-based localization of the smooth ER marker Syntaxin17 (Steegmaier et al., 2000) to the membrane structures also implicates smooth ER in the formation of virusinduced compartments. By using ET, we could unambiguously show that all these membrane structures are interconnected and part of a single ER-derived endomembrane system, providing a platform for the transport of viral proteins and genomes between RNA replication vesicles, ribosome-containing membranes (RNA translation), and virus assembly sites. By TEM, the vesicles to which all of the tested NS proteins localized appeared as ''free'' DMVs or as single vesicles in the ER lumen. We show that their appearance depends on the sample preparation protocol, a fact that should be considered when analyzing the ultrastructure of membrane rearrangements induced by other RNA viruses. Three-dimensional analysis of the vesicles reveals that they are invaginations of the ER membrane. Thus, the inside of the vesicles is connected to the cytosol and probably is the site of viral RNA replication, as indicated by the labeling for NS proteins and dsRNA. This result is reminiscent of an earlier report on DENV, in which colocalization of NS1 and dsRNA to VPs and cytoplasmic vacuoles was found in infected Vero cells and insect cells (Mackenzie et al., 1996) . Our results do not, however, support the model by Uchil and Satchidanandam (2003) , who proposed that flavivirus replication vesicles consist of a closed inner vesicle surrounded by an outer membrane that is continuous with CM and the ER. In contrast, we show that the interior of the vesicle is connected to the surrounding cytosol by a pore, which only became visible by use of ET. The pore may regulate import of factors required for RNA replication as well as export of newly synthesized genomes to be used for translation or virus assembly (see below).",

            "text": "The most striking observation from ET was the identification of virus budding sites in close proximity to the pores of replication vesicles. It has been assumed for a long time that flaviviruses acquire their envelope by budding into the ER lumen, and here we provide a direct visualization, in 3D, of this process. Our results not only reveal the DENV budding sites, but also allow us to draw a model of how the topology of DENV-induced membrane rearrangements may contribute to the different steps of the replication cycle ( Figure 7L ): upon infection, genomic viral RNA associates with ribosomes at the rough ER, where translation occurs. The resulting polyprotein is cleaved co-and posttranslationally, forming a membrane-associated RC. Whether polyprotein processing occurs in CM as proposed for Kunjin virus (KUNV) remains to be determined. Invaginations of the ER membrane are induced, presumably by NS4A, in conjunction with other viral and cellular factors and give rise to membranous vesicles that are connected to the cytosol via a pore. We assume that the structural proteins core, E, and prM are excluded from these vesicles, an assumption that is supported by our immunolabeling showing NS proteins on one set of membranes and E on another set. Based on the dsRNA labeling, Bromo-UTP labeling of nascent DENV RNA (S.M. and R.B., unpublished data), and biochemical studies (Mackenzie et al., 1996; Miller et al., 2006 Miller et al., , 2007 Uchil and Satchidanandam, 2003) , RNA synthesis likely occurs within the lumen of the vesicles. Nucleotides and other factors required for replication may enter the vesicle via the pore that also would allow exit of the newly synthesized RNA genome to the cytosol, where it is used for translation or particle assembly. Nucleocapsid formation and virus budding into the ER lumen occur in close proximity of such RNA exit sites. Although virus particles appear to accumulate in dilated ER cisternae, single virus particles contained in vesicles were often found at the cis-Golgi, arguing that single DENV particles are transported to the Golgi, where prM is cleaved by the cellular furin protease (Shapiro et al., 1997) . The release of mature virus particles most likely occurs through the constitutive secretory pathway.",

NS4A oligomers would dilate the lumenal leaflet, resulting in membrane invagination toward the ER lumen, a topology that fits our observation. While this would explain how the vesicles are generated, we do not know how a pore of distinct size is formed and why the vesicles do not pinch off. One possibility is that the required host cell machinery is not available at these sites. Further studies will be required to clarify the molecular composition and biogenesis of the pores.",

Lee and colleague have recently provided evidence that DENV infection enhances autophagolysosome formation and that inhibition of the autophagic host cell machinery by phosphatidylinositol-3 0 -kinase (PI3KC3) inhibitor 3-methyladenine reduces DENV titers (Lee et al., 2008) . The effects are moderate, however, arguing that this pathway may contribute to DENV replication to only a minor extent. Whereas the doublemembrane phenotype seen in our TEM resembles the membrane dynamics during autophagy, a role for this cellular process is unlikely, at least under the conditions used here. Hallmarks of autophagy include membrane wrapping, leading to a double-membrane compartment involved in lysosomal degradation. As shown unequivocally by our ET data, the DENV-induced vesicles are invaginations rather than sealed double-membrane vesicles, and our immunolabeling experiments that exclude lamp-1 from these vesicles do not support an involvement of lysosomes. We note that Lee and colleagues used a different DENV strain that may be more virulent than the New Guinea C (NGC) strain used in our study, which could account for the discrepant results.",

In the case of FHV (Kopek et al., 2007) , newly synthesized viral RNA and the sole replication factor, protein A, were found to colocalize in invaginations of the outer mitochondrial membrane. These spherules have a diameter of about 50 nm and are connected to the cytosol via a necked 10 nm channel. It is assumed that this pore allows exchange of factors required for RNA replication as well as release of progeny RNA. Formation of the spherule is induced by protein A oligomers that appear to bend membranes in a process similar to viral matrix proteins.

This observation is reminiscent of the complex ER-derived network described here in DENV-infected cells. Surprisingly, however, the inner membrane layers of the SARS-CoV DMVs were sealed, whereas neck-like connections were detected between the outer layers of different DMVs. This topology raises the challenging questions of how such large (200-300 nm diameter) sealed vesicles form and how viral RNA is released to gain access to ribosomes and the structural proteins.

In cells either containing a persistently replicating subgenome or infected with HCV, intensive structural rearrangements, designated the membranous web, were found (Gosert et al., 2003; Miller and Krijnse-Locker, 2008) . However, the induced membrane alterations are much more heterogenous, with irregular assemblies of membranous vesicles that vary in size and profound alterations of presumably ER-derived membranes. At variance with flaviviruses, the membranous web of HCV contains interspersed lipid droplets that play a major role in the assembly of infectious virus particles Miyanari et al., 2007; Shavinskaya et al., 2007) . These droplets appear to be tightly linked to the replication sites, but due to the high complexity of these membrane structures, a detailed analysis will be very difficult. In this respect, the 3D model developed here for DENV may serve as a template to unravel the architecture of the HCV replication and assembly compartments.",

Our results provide a possible explanation for the spatial coupling of the different steps of the DENV replication cycle. The next obvious step is to integrate available information about the structures and functions of the viral and cellular factors involved in the biogenesis of these replication factories, but also to decipher the temporal relationship orchestrating the steps, from uncoating of the viral genome up to the assembly of infectious progeny virus. We can assume that these studies will provide new insight into fundamental cell biological processes, but also define targets for the development of preventive and therapeutic strategies to combat this insidious disease.",

Fixed cells were high-pressure frozen/freeze substituted with acetone/0.1% osmium tetroxide as described (Buser and Walther, 2008) (Figure 2E ) or postfixed with 1% osmium tetroxide for 1 hr on ice and dehydrated in a graded acetone series at room temperature (all other figures).

Tomograms were reconstructed using the IMOD software package (version 3.12.20) (Kremer et al., 1996) . The Amira Visualization Package (version 5.2.0, Visage Imaging) was used for 3D measurements, surface rendering, and Gaussian image filtering (3 3 3 3 3 kernel). All 3D surface models were generated from unfiltered tomograms by manually masking areas of interest, thresholding, and smoothing labels, followed by manually filling gaps and additional smoothing when necessary to render the surfaces more continuous.
