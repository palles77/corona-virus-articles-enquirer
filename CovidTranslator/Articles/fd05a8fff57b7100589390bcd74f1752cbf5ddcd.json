A first analysis of simple day-lag maps points to some universality in the epidemic spreading, suggesting that simple mean-field models can be meaningfully used to gather a quantitative picture of the epidemic spreading, and notably the height and time of the peak of confirmed infected individuals. The analysis of the same data within a simple susceptibleinfected-recovered-deaths model indicates that the kinetic parameter that describes the rate of recovery seems to be the same, irrespective of the country, while the infection and death rates appear to be more variable. The model places the peak in Italy around March 21 st 2020, with a peak number of infected individuals of about 260 0 0 (not including recovered and dead) and a number of deaths at the end of the epidemics of about 18,0 0 0. Since the confirmed cases are believed to be between 10 and 20% of the real number of individuals who eventually get infected, the apparent mortality rate of COVID-19 falls between 4% and 8% in Italy, while it appears substantially lower, between 1% and 3% in China. Based on our calculations, we estimate that 2500 ventilation units should represent a fair figure for the peak requirement to be considered by health authorities in Italy for their strategic planning. Finally, a simulation of the effects of drastic containment measures on the outbreak in Italy indicates that a reduction of the infection rate indeed causes a quench of the epidemic peak. However, it is also seen that the infection rate needs to be cut down drastically and quickly to observe an appreciable decrease of the epidemic peak and mortality rate. This appears only possible through a concerted and disciplined, albeit painful, effort of the population as a whole.",

Among the countries hit by the epidemics, Italy found itself grappling with the worst outbreak after the original one, generating considerable turmoil among the population. The exponential increase in people who tested positive to COVID-19 (supposedly together with the sudden increase in the testing rate itself), finally prompted the Italian government to issue on March 8 th 2020 a dramatic decree ordering the lockdown of the entire country.",

(3) , this simply means that one should regard \u03b2 = 0 . 928 as an average figure. In fact, each population will be characterized by slightly different value of \u03b2, which will yield considerably different plateaus, since they are all close to the singularity at \u03b2 = 1 (see again Eq. (3) ). The prediction (3) should not be regarded as the true asymptotic value to be expected at the end of the outbreak for either populations. Rather, it should be regarded as an estimate of the total population initially within the ensemble of people who will eventually get infected. In fact, the elements of the ensemble ( C, R, D ) are not independent, as people get infected, recover and die as time goes by, thus effectively transf erring elements from one population to another. We will show in the next section how this can be accounted for within a simple kinetic scheme, where eventually such interactions will cause the population of infected individuals I to die out and the R and D populations to reach two separate plateaus as observed. Furthermore, it should be noticed that the data plotted in Fig. 1 start from the first pair of successive values (P n +1 , P n ) encountered in the data sheets with P n +1 , P n > 0 , consistent with the fact that P = 0 is also a (trivial) fixed point of the map (1) .",

In the case of China, we set t 0 to day one, as the reported initial populations bear evidence of an outbreak that is already well en route . However, we found that the initial values reported for all the populations, but notably the infected individuals, appear underestimated. This is consistent with the abrupt, visible increase appearing around mid-February, when Chinese authorities changed the testing protocol [1, 2] . Consequently, we let the initial values I 0 , S 0 , D 0 float as well during the fits.

Concurrently, the model fails to follow the observed rapid recovery and overestimates the number of deaths. This is most likely due to the harsh containment measures adopted by the Chinese government in order to curb the spread of the disease. A simple way to test this hypothesis is to restrict the fit to the initial growth phase before the onset of the peak. This is illustrated in Fig. 4 . Indeed, it can be appreciated that a model that does not include any external curbing action on the infected population reproduces quite nicely the initial growth phase, places the peak at the correct time, but fails to match the swift recovery rate and decline of the infection in the window where the imposed restrictions are assuredly in action.",

However, most likely these data do not bear any signature yet of the harsh, draconian measures contained in the dramatic decree signed by Mr Conte on March 8 th 2020. Equipped with our robust estimates of the kinetic parameters, we Table 1 ). A very similar prediction is obtained by restricting the fit up to February 15 th 2020, where the peak had not been reached yet (data not shown). are in a good position to inquire whether those measures will impact substantially on the future evolution of the epidemics. To this aim, we consider a modified version of the SIRD model, where the infection rate r is let vary with time. More precisely, given that the containment measures became law at time t * , we take",

Fig. 5 shows two predictions based on such modified SIRD model, for intermediate (50%) and large (90%) reduction of the infection rate, with t * fixed at the date of the signature of the decree and t = 7 and 2 days, i.e. assuming that the effects of the lockdown will be visible on a time of the order of one week or a few days. It can be appreciated that the effect is predicted to be the one the government was hoping for. Moreover, it can be seen that the quickest the drop in the infection rate brought about by the containment measures, the more substantial the reduction of the epidemic peak. However, it can also be seen that the infection rate should be cut down rather drastically for the measures to be effective. Overall, the dynamics of the decay of the epidemics after the peak and the mortality rate seem also little affected by a time decay of the infection rate, unless this happens very quickly (in a matter of days) and suppressing new infections by at least 90%.",

Our results seem to suggest that there is a certain universality in the time evolution of COVID-19. This is demonstrated by time-lag plots of the confirmed infected populations of China, Italy and France, which collapse on one and the same power law on average. This suggests that a country that becomes the theatre of an epidemics surge can be regarded, at least in first approximation, as a well-stirred chemical reactor, where different populations interact according to mass-action-like rules with little connection to geographical variations.",

Chinese authorities have tackled the outbreak by imposing martial law to a large fraction on the population, thus presumably cutting down the infection rate to a large extent. While data on the outbreak in China bear the signature of this measure, the data on the outbreak in Italy clearly do not at this stage. Moreover, it can be surmised that many cultural factors could influence the infection rate, thus leading to a larger variability from one country to another. Analysis of data from more than two countries of course are needed to substantiate this hypothesis. The death rate probably reflects the average age and underlying health conditions of elderly patients, which are also likely to vary markedly depending on culture and lifestyle.",

Taking into account that the confirmed cases can be estimated to be between 10 and 20% of the real number of infected individuals [2] , the apparent mortality rate of COVID-19 seems to be between 4% and 8% in Italy, higher than seasonal flu, while it appears substantially lower in China, that is, between 1% and 3%.",

While a reduction in the epidemic peak and mortality rate are indeed observed, we predict that such effects will only be visible if the measures cause a quick (matter of days) and drastic (down by at least 80 \u2212 90 %) cutback of the infection rate.
