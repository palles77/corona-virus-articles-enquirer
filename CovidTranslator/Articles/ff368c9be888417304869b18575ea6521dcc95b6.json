A number of enteroviruses, including echoviruses (EV) and group B coxsackieviruses (CVB), initiate infection by attaching to decayaccelerating factor (DAF), a molecule that is highly expressed on the apical surface of polarized epithelial cells. We previously observed that entry of DAF-binding CVB3 into polarized intestinal epithelial cells occurs by an unusual endocytic mechanism that requires caveolin but does not involve clathrin or dynamin. Here we examined the entry of a DAF-binding echovirus, EV7. We found that drugs, small interfering RNAs (siRNAs), and dominant negative mutants that target factors required for clathrinmediated endocytosis, including clathrin and dynamin, inhibited both EV7 infection and internalization of virions from the cell surface. Once virus had entered the cell, it colocalized with markers of early endosomes (EEA1) and then late endosomes (LAMP-2). Inhibition of endosomal maturation-with siRNAs or dominant negative mutants targeting Rab5 and Rab7-inhibited infection and prevented release of viral RNA into the cell. These results indicate that EV7 is internalized by clathrin-mediated endocytosis and then moves to early and late endosomes before releasing its RNA. Trafficking through endosomes is known to be important for viruses that depend on low pH or endosomal cathepsin proteases to complete the entry process. However, we found that EV7 infection required neither low pH nor cathepsins.",

Rhinovirus capsids are unstable at low pH, and for some rhinoviruses uncoating occurs when the virion is delivered to an acidic endosome (13) . However, most enteroviruses are transmitted by the fecal-oral route and must survive exposure to stomach acid; in consequence, their capsids are stable at low pH, and their uncoating appears to be independent of endosomal acidification.",

We had previously observed that CVB3 infection of Caco-2 cells occurs by a complex process that depends on caveolin but not dynamin-2, appears to be independent of clathrin-mediated endocytosis, and is inhibited by depletion of membrane cholesterol (19) . Here, we examined cellular factors required for EV7 infection, using siR-NAs, dominant negative (DN) mutants, and drugs targeting clathrin-specific endocytic mechanisms. We found that infection by EV7, but not by CVB3, was inhibited by siRNA depletion of both clathrin and dynamin (Fig. 1B) , by dominant negative mutants of dynamin2 and the clathrin adaptor protein Eps15 (Fig. 1C) , and by chlorpromazine (Fig. 1D) , an inhibitor of clathrin-mediated endocytosis (20) . Dynasore, a pharmacological inhibitor of dynamin GTPase activity (21) , also had a marked inhibitory effect on EV7 infection (Fig. 1D) . (A small but statistically significant effect on CVB3 infection by dynasore may be nonspecific, as no inhibition of CVB3 was seen with dominant negative dynamin or dynamin siRNA.) In contrast, depletion of caveolin-1 with siRNA ( Fig. 1B) , expression of dominant negative caveolin (Fig. 1C ), or treatment with the cholesterol-depleting agent methyl-beta cyclodextrin (Fig. 1C) , all of which inhibited CVB3, had no effect on EV7 infection.

To determine whether clathrin and dynamin are required for events upstream of RNA release, we employed the neutral red (NR) infectious center assay for virus uncoating previously used to study poliovirus entry (22) . When virus is grown in the presence of NR, the dye is concentrated within the capsid, in close proximity to the RNA genome. Exposure to light activates the dye, damages the RNA, and renders the virus noninfectious. However, once uncoating has occurred, the NR diffuses away from the RNA, so that exposure to light no longer inhibits infection. We found that plaque formation by neutral red-labeled EV7 (NR-EV7) was markedly inhibited when Caco-2 monolayers were exposed to light at 30 and 60 min but that the majority of NR-EV7 became insensitive to light by 90 min (Fig. 2A) . This result suggested that uncoating had largely occurred by 90 min. To monitor requirements for uncoating, we pretreated Caco-2 cells with inhibitors, exposed them to NR-EV7, and allowed infection to proceed in the dark for 90 min. Cells were then exposed to light, harvested, replated on cell monolayers, overlaid with agar, and incubated to permit the appearance of infectious centers. To control for nonspecific effects of the inhibitors, parallel assays were performed in which the illumination step was omitted. If an inhibitor prevents or significantly delays cellular events upstream of RNA release, we expect it to reduce the formation of infectious centers in illuminated, but not unilluminated, cells.",

Cells were pretreated with drugs, exposed to EV7-AF594 at 4\u00b0C, and then incubated at 37\u00b0C for 90 min to permit entry to occur. Cells were then fixed without permeabilization and stained with anti-VP1 antibody and fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-labeled secondary antibody (green) to detect virus still exposed on the cell surface. In control cells treated with dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) vehicle alone, red-labeled virus was seen to accumulate in perinuclear vesicles inaccessible to the anti-VP1 antibody (Fig. 2D) . Similar results were seen in cells treated with the uncoating inhibitor R78206 (Fig. 2G ). However, in cells treated with dynasore, virus remained trapped at the cell surface, as indicated by the congruence of red and green fluorescence (Fig. 2E, yellow) . In cells treated with chlorpromazine, virus was similarly trapped transfected with siRNAs targeting DAF or CAR or with control siRNA (labeled \"C\") and then cultured as polarized monolayers and exposed to EV7 or CVB3, as described in Materials and Methods. Infected cells were counted after staining with anti-VP1 antibody, and nuclei were counted after staining with DAPI.

For a number of viruses, acidification of the endosome provides an important trigger for structural changes that permit fusion of viral and endosomal membranes or release of nucleic acid from the protein capsid. For some, the relatively mild acidity of early endosomes is insufficient, and delivery to more acidic late endosomes is required before entry can occur (13, 26) . Enteroviruses such as echovirus 7, which enter the body by way of the intestine, must survive exposure to gastric acid and are generally quite resistant to low pH (27) . To test whether EV7 entry depends on the low pH of the late endosome, we used two agents that prevent endosomal acidification by different mechanisms, ammonium chloride (28) and the endosomal proton pump inhibitor bafilomycin A (29) . Neither ammonium chloride nor bafilomycin inhibited EV7 infection of Caco-2 cells (Fig. 6A) , although both agents effectively blocked infection by vesicular stomatitis virus, a virus that is known to require endosomal acidification for fusion and entry (30) .",

For poliovirus, the first step in uncoating is triggered when the virion interacts with its receptor, PVR: the virion undergoes a conformational change, leading to exposure of previously buried hydrophobic peptides and release from the capsid of a small internal protein, VP4. But the resulting altered virion, referred to as the A particle, still retains the RNA genome. A second conformational change, and possibly an intracellular cue, is required for the genome to exit, leaving behind a second identifiable altered virion, the 80S empty capsid (4) . In contrast to poliovirus interactions with PVR, some viruses are not converted to A particles when they contact their receptors. The receptor for minor-group rhinoviruses, the LDL receptor, does not induce conformational changes but instead mediates the delivery of these acid-susceptible viruses to endosomes, where uncoating is initiated by acidification (13, 36) . CVB3 is converted to A particles during infection, but A particles are not formed when virus binds to DAF; conversion to A particles and productive infection both depend on interaction with another receptor, CAR (12, 37) .",

            "text": "Although EV7 binds to human DAF on transfected rodent cells, infection does not ensue (14, 17) ; introduction of naked viral RNA into the same cells results in infection (our unpublished data), suggesting that the block to infection occurs upstream of RNA release. Like CVB3, EV7 has been noted to form A particles during infection, but it is not converted to A particles when it is exposed to soluble forms of DAF; it has thus been suggested that a second cellular factor may be essential for infection (38) . Whether this factor is a second receptor protein or an intracellular cue of another sort is uncertain. The intracellular site where uncoating occurs also remains in question. Direct visualization of RNA release has established that poliovirus uncoating in HeLa cells occurs rapidly and quite close to the plasma membrane (22) . In contrast, indirect evidence suggests that, in endothelial cells, poliovirus uncoating is completed slowly, after virus has moved to a perinuclear compartment (39); CVB3 uncoating in Caco-2 cells, as determined by appearance of 80S particles, also occurs deep within the cell (19) . We found that EV7 uncoating, as defined by the neutral red assay, was completed at approximately 90 min, when virus colocalization with LAMP-2 was maximal. The requirement for Rab7 indicates that EV7 uncoating depends on endosomal maturation, and it suggests that the late endosomal environment may provide a signal important for RNA release. Acidification itself does not seem to be important, as bafilomycin and ammonium chloride had no effect on infection; further, although endosomal cathepsins are important for entry of several viruses, infection was not affected by inhibition of cathepsin activity. Ebolavirus entry was recently shown to depend on the Niemann-Pick C1 protein (40, 41) , a cholesterol transport protein resident in late endosomes (42) . We observed no effect on EV7 infection when Caco-2 cells were treated with U18666A (data not shown), an inhibitor of cholesterol synthesis, which induces a cellular phenotype similar to that seen in Niemann-Pick C1 deficiency and which has been shown to block Ebola virus entry (40) . Thus, if a specific endosomal factor is required for EV7 uncoating, it remains to be identified.",

In experiments with siRNAs, Caco-2 cells were transfected and allowed to form polarized monolayers in 12-well plates before infection. In experiments with drugs, monolayers in 12-well plates were pretreated with a drug for 1 h at 37\u00b0C. In the dark, NR-EV7, in binding buffer containing the drug, was allowed to attach to cells at 4\u00b0C for 1 h; binding buffer was then removed and infection was initiated by adding warmed culture medium, containing the drug if appropriate. After 90 min at 37\u00b0C, virus-infected cells were exposed to white light for 10 min at room temperature; preliminary experiments indicated that a 90-min incubation was required for the majority of input virus to escape light-induced NR damage. Duplicate monolayers were maintained in the dark and used as unilluminated controls. Cells were detached with trypsin-EDTA and then counted, diluted, and replated onto fresh Caco-2 monolayers in 6-well plates, in the absence of inhibitors. Agarose overlay was added after 3 h. After 2 days, plaques were developed and counted. In each of four independent experiments, the numbers of plaques in the drug-treated or illuminated wells were normalized to the number of plaques in the unilluminated control well (expressed as a percentage). Therefore, no error estimates are provided for the controls, which were defined as 100%.",
