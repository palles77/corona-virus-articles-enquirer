Currently, Oseltamivir is being stockpiled in many countries potentially affected by the influenza A virus subtype H5N1 epidemic. To identify this change in Oseltamivir-treated patients, a method based on real-time PCR using two labeled TaqMan probes was developed for its rapid detection. In order to validate the method, Oseltamivir specimen from treated (Oseltamivir-resistant strain from a Vietnamese patient, two Oseltamivir-treated tigers) and untreated subjects have been used for this study. The results thus obtained as well as those derived from clone selection and sequencing showed that TaqMan probes could clearly discriminate wild type H274 from the mutant 274Y variant. The sensitivity of this assay was as low as 10 copies/l and allowed the detection of the mutation in a mixture of wild type and mutant. Overall, the assay based on real-time PCR with two labeled TaqMan probes described here should be useful for detecting Oseltamivir-resistant H274Y H5N1 influenza A virus in many species and various sources of specimens with high sensitivity and specificity. Such studies can address potential differences in the diagnostic outcomes between patients who develop detectable Oseltamivir resistance and those who retain only the wild type strain of H5N1.",

Annually, influenza viruses may develop symptomatic influenza in 20% of children and 5% of adults worldwide (Turner et al., 2003) . From the three types A-C only A and B cause widespread outbreaks. Further subtyping of influenza A virus is based on the antigenic differences between two surface glycoproteins: haemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA). Nowadays, 16 HA (H1-H16) and 9 NA (N1-N9) subtypes have been described (Fouchier et al., 2005; Nicholson et al., 2003) . Since 2004, the influenza A virus subtype H5N1 has been the cause of severe disease in various poultry and mammals. The clinical spectrum of avian influenza (H5N1) in humans comprises initial symptoms of high fever (exceeding 38 \u2022 C), lower respiratory tract symptoms, clinically significant lymphopenia, abnormalities on chest radiography, and in some cases diarrhea, vomiting (Tran et al., 2004) and encephalitis. The overall fatality rate among hospitalized patients with avian influenza A (H5N1) infection has amounted to 57% (WHO, 2006) . Two groups of antiviral agents are currently available for the treatment of influenza infection. The Adamantanes (Amantadine and Rimantadine) block the function of the M2 protein; however, drug resistance in patients has increased to 30% (Hayden and Hay, 1992) . The more recently developed class of viral neuraminidase inhibitors includes Zanamivir (Relenza) and Oseltamivir (Tamiflu) . An important antiviral medication used against all strains of influenza A virus is Oseltamivir, which is the first orally active neuraminidase inhibitor in the form of a capsule or powder for liquid suspension (Kim et al., 1997) . The neuraminidase inhibitor (NAI) Oseltamivir imitates natural neuraminidase substrate molecules and binds to the active site of the enzyme in addition to interfering with the release of progeny influenza virus from infected host cells (Moscona, 2005a) . Therefore, neuraminidase (NA) cannot cleave a terminal N-acetylneuraminic acid residue from an oligosaccharide chain and thus, the virions self-aggregate and bind to the surface of infected cells.",

            "text": "Oseltamivir resistance due to neuraminidase mutations have arisen both in challenge studies and in patients with naturally acquired infections. Rates of resistance are estimated at around 1% in the adult population and 5% in pediatric patients (Jackson et al., 2000; Whitley et al., 2001) . In 2004, Kiso et al. (2004) analyzed influenza A viruses (H3N2) collected from 50 children before and during treatment with Oseltamivir. Eighteen percent of the children (N = 9/50) had neuraminidase mutations at Arg292Lys (N = 6/9) or Glu119Val (N = 2/9) or Asn294Ser (N = 1/9). Volunteers experimentally infected with influenza A/Texas/36/91 (H1N1) virus and treated with oseltamivir have shown an H274Y substitution at the neuraminidase active site (Gubareva et al., 2001) . This mutation in response to oseltamivir phosphate treatment leaves the virus severely compromised both in vitro and in vivo (Ives et al., 2002) and confers about 400-600fold resistance (Wetherall et al., 2003) . The mutation at position 274 can influence the sensitivity of influenza N1 NA yet not of N2 NA to Oseltamivir carboxylate by rearranging the shape of the active site to create a pocket for Oseltamivir (Gubareva, 2004; Moscona, 2005b; Wang et al., 2002) .",

            "text": "The specificity of the assay by cross-contamination tests were evaluated and found no cross-reactivity to total human DNA, any of the different NA subtypes of influenza A virus, Newcastle disease virus (NDV), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) subgroups A and B, human metapneumovirus (HMPV), coronavirus OC43, coronavirus 229E, infectious bursal disease virus (IBDV) and infectious bronchitis virus (IBV). Likewise, any significant false positive or non-specific signal in any of the samples tested was not observed. Overall, the results obtained on Oseltamivir resistance with the two labeled probes indicate a high specificity of both primers and probes used for amplification. As for the sensitivity of real-time PCR, the threshold concentration for detecting both wild type (H274) and mutant (274Y) was 10 copies/l. Furthermore, in order to establish the limits of real-time PCR to detect both wild type and mutant in the same sample, wild type and mutant plasmids were mixed in various ratios and diluted them over a range of concentrations 100:0, 75:25, 50:50, 25:75 and 0:100 ratios of wild type and mutant. The result showed the high sensitivity of the detection that can be detected although the reaction had 7.5:2.5 plasmid copies/l of wild type and mutant.",

            "text": "At present, there is a substantial risk of a global influenza A virus subtype H5N1 epidemic not only affecting poultry but also mammalian species including humans. A medication capable of preventing the spread to humans is the neuraminidase inhibitor Oseltamivir. Yet, influenza A virus subtype H5N1 has already developed drug resistance by mutations in the neuraminidase gene leading to amino acid substitutions predominantly at positions 119, 152, 274 and 292 (N2 numbering system) of the enzyme's active site (Gubareva et al., 2000) . The amino acid substitution at position 274 identified in mutants selected in the presence of NA inhibitors both in vivo and in vitro has exclusively been found in N1 (Gubareva et al., 2002) . In 2005, H5N1 virus resistant to oseltamivir due to an amino acid change from Histidine (H) to Tyrosine (Y) based on a single nucleotide alteration at position 274 has been isolated from three Vietnamese patients one of whom, a 14 years old, recovered (Le et al., 2005) while the remaining two, a 13 and 18 years old, succumbed to the infection (de Jong et al., 2005) . Hence, patients found positive for H5N1 infection ought to be monitored for the nucleotide change at position 274 causing resistance to Oseltamivir before the onset of treatment. With the mutation detected in time, alternative treatment applying, for example Zanamivir might save the patient's life.",

The amino acid substitution of Histidine (H) with Tyrosine (Y) is the consequence of a single nucleotide in the first codon of this amino acid change from C to T. The alignment of theH5N1 neuraminidase gene sequence with more than 200 sequences stored in the Genbank database showed a nucleotide change in the specific probe area yet at a position not triggering the critical amino acid alteration. Hence, the probe was designed to allow for this inconsequential mutation by using a degenerate nucleotide at that position thus closely mimicking the natural situation. Moreover, since the conserved area of the gene restricted the probe's length to 17 nucleotides TaqMan MGB was chosen. The probe was coupled with a minor groove binder enhancing its Tm and had a non-fluorescent quencher attached to the 3 end, which does not interfere with fluorescent signal detection. After having tested the probes with the mutagenesis control, the result showed high sensitivity and correct distinction between wild type and mutant upon mixing different ratios of wild type and mutant plasmid at low concentrations.",
