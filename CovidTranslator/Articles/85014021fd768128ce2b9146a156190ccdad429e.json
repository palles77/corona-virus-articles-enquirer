The inhibition on pseudovirus was also seen in cells pretreated with the CC and CC/Fr.2 (IC 50S , 283.4 \u00b1 16.3 and 149.5 \u00b1 13.5 g/ml, respectively), however the highest activities on wtSARS-CoV were observed when the viruses were treated by the extracts before challenging (IC 50S , 43.1 \u00b1 2.8 and 7.8 \u00b1 0.3 g/ml; SIs, 8.4 and 23.1, respectively). Among the compounds fractionated from CC, procyanidin A2 and procyanidin B1 showed moderate anti-wtSARS-CoV activity (IC 50S , 29.9 \u00b1 3.3 and 41.3 \u00b1 3.4 M; SIs, 37.35 and 15.69, respectively). We also sought to determine whether they could interfere with the clathrin-dependent endocytosis pathway using transferrin receptor (TfR) as an indicator. CC/Fr.2 inhibited the internalization of TfR but the procyanidins did not. Taken together, CC/Fr.2 contains unknown substances, that could inhibit the infection, probably by interfering with endocytosis, and it also contains procyanidins that did not inhibit the internalization but inhibited the infection. Therefore, CC extracts contain anti-virus activities that act through distinct mechanisms according to differences in the compounds or mixtures.",

However, the selectivity indices of these materials are as high as 100 and the mechanisms of their actions are not clear (De Clercq, 2004 , 2006 . Therefore, more research is necessary to discover drugs and to study their mechanisms for the practical interference of SARS-CoV infection. It was reported that medicinal herbs combined with western medicines improved the symptoms and decreased the required dosage of corticosteroids for SARS patients (Liu et al., 2006) . To identify potential inhibitor(s) of SARS-CoV, we screened seven different medicinal herbs that were reported to be used for SARS patients . We also fractionated the extracts to characterize the inhibitory molecule(s).",

SARS-CoV S glycoprotein mediates viral entry through pH-dependent endocytosis, like vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) (Sun et al., 2005) . The endocytic pathways taken by viruses can be divided into clathrin-mediated and clathrin-independent pathways (Marsh and Helenius, 2006) . Recently, we demonstrated that SARS-CoV mainly utilizes the clathrin-mediated endocytosis pathway for its entry to target cells (Inoue et al., 2007) . Therefore, we examined whether effective herbs and their purified compounds may affect the endocytotic pathways.",

Each dried medicinal herb (30 kg) was boiled under reflux in 360 l of distilled water for 1 h. The aqueous extract was separated from the residue by centrifugation followed by concentration under reduced pressure. The concentrated extracts were lyophilized. Four fractions of CC were obtained by the method shown in Fig. 1 . CC (114.9 g) was extracted with 700 ml of 50% aqueous ethanol (aq. EtOH/H 2 O under reflux for 2 h. The obtained extract was concentrated under reduced pressure to yield a 50% aq. EtOH/H 2 O extract (13.5 g, fraction 1). Most of this (11.2 g) could be dissolved in distilled water, and it was then extracted with ethylac- etate (AcOEt, 200 ml \u00d7 2) and n-butanol (n-BuOH, 200 ml \u00d7 2). The n-BuOH layer, aq. layer and AcOEt layer were concentrated under reduced pressure to successively yield fractions 2 (CC/Fr.2, 3.5 g), 3 (CC/Fr.3, 3.7 g) and 4 (CC/Fr.4, 2.8 g), respectively. The four fractions of CF were also obtained by an essentially similar method as described above. These fractions were suspended in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) at a concentration of 100 mg/ml and then serially diluted with DMEM.",

To characterize the responsible substance(s), we separated the four fractions from CC and CF using aqueous ethanol (Fr.1), ethylacetate (Fr.4) and n-butanol (Fr.2) extraction Experiments were repeated three times, and the averages of IC50 (the inhibitory concentration of extract to inhibit the luciferase activity to 50% control value) and CC50 (the cytotoxic concentration of extract that reduced cell viability to 50%) are shown. The selectivity index (SI) corresponds to CC50/IC50. methods (Fig. 1) . The IC 50 of CC/Fr.2 was the lowest among the four fractions of CC, although all fractions showed slight inhibitory activities (Table 1 ). The dose-dependent inhibition of CC/Fr.2 was also confirmed using both HIV/SARS-CoV S and HIV/VSVG pseudovirus infection ( Fig. 2A and B ). In the case of the CF fractions, CF/Fr.2, CF/Fr.3 and CF/Fr.4 showed moderate inhibitory activities (Table 1) . Pseudoviruses replicate in infected cells in a single cycle manner, and the luciferase activities are not solely dependent on the entry but also on transcription and protein synthesis. Therefore, the inhibitory activities of CCE and CFE were also examined at different times by adding them to the culture 1 h before infection or 12 h after infection by HIV/SARS-CoV S. The results showed that inhibition occurred only in the former case (data not shown) suggesting that they inhibited the HIV/SARS-CoV S infection only during the early steps of virus replication.

Therefore we could not prove virucidal effects of the compounds, and analyzed their inhibitory activities by adding the mixtures of compounds and the virus (0 h) to target cells. Among the four fractions of CC, CC/Fr.2 showed moderate inhibitory activities in the plaque reduction assay, suggesting that CC/Fr.2 contained more biologically active substances (Table 2) . Unexpectedly, the four fractions of CF, as well as CFE, did not inhibit wtSARS-CoV infection (Table 2) .",

Because HIV-based pseudovirus RNA should be reverse transcribed followed by integration to make the reporter gene product, we examined whether these inhibitors could inhibit wild-type infection. In the plaque reduction assay of wtSARS-CoV infection, the SIs of CC/Fr.1 and CC/Fr.2 were found to be moderate; however, CFE and its fractions did not show significant inhibitory activities. We believe CCE may inhibit the early steps of SARS-CoV infection, based on the time of addition study and on the plaque reduction assay in the wild-type infection. Furthermore, the extract appeared to act on both cells and the virus because it inhibited infection of the cells by pretreatment of the cells or viruses. The IC 50S (283.4 \u00b1 16.3 g/ml for CCE and 149.5 \u00b1 13.5 g/ml for CC/Fr.2) for pre-treatment of the cells were much higher than those obtained by the experiments in which the reagent was mixed with the virus first (IC 50S , 43.1 \u00b1 2.8 g/ml for CCE and 7.8 \u00b1 0.3 g/ml for CC/Fr.2), although we could not demonstrate virucidal activities in our assay. However, the mechanisms of the inhibitory activities by pre-treatment were studied. Because CCE inhibited not only SARS-CoV but also HIV/VSVG pseudovirus infection, we suspected that they might interact with molecules that are important for the entry of both viruses. It is known that VSV and many enveloped viruses must be endocytosed for infection, and they are then transported to early endosomes, late endosomes, and lysosomes using the endocytic pathway. VSV is well-known to infect cells in a pH-dependent manner and was shown to utilize the clathrin-mediated endocytic pathway upon infection. We have also reported that SARS-CoV entry is clathrin-dependent. We therefore examined whether CCE or CFE could interfere with the recycling of TfR.",

These results suggested that the anti-virus activity of CC/Fr.2, but not that of CFE, might be related to the endocytic pathway of viruses. TfR is a well-known clathrin-mediated recycling molecule, and interference with its recycling may enhance the TfR expression on the cell surface.

            "text": "It is well-known that CC contains large amounts of proanthocyanidins (Prior and Gu, 2005) , also known as condensed tannin, which has been accredited with a variety of beneficial effects on health (Beecher, 2004) . Tannins and related compounds were reported to possess anti-HIV activity (Lee et al., 1992; H.X. Xu et al., 2000) . Proantocyanidins are reported to have anti-HIV and anti-HSV activities (De Bruyne et al., 1999) . Therefore, we examined 8 compounds isolated from CC for various biological activities and found that three compounds that were structurally very similar showed inhibitory activities on SARS-CoV infection (Fig. 6) and two of them caused up-regulation of TfR expression. The structures of procyanidins B1 and B2 are closely related to each other except for the configuration at the C-3 position, but procyanidins B2 did not inhibit SARS-CoV infection nor up-regulate TfR expression (data not shown). These data strongly suggest that the anti-SARS-CoV activities in CC/Fr.1 and CC/Fr.2 could be explained by procyanidins. In fact, procyanidins were detected in Fr.1 and Fr.2 but not in Fr.3 (Tanaka, unpublished observation March 12, 2008) . However, none of the procyanidins inhibited the internalization of TfR at the optimal concentration (data not shown), suggesting they may not act on the TfR recycling pathway directly. It was also demonstrated that the compounds did not affect ACE2 expression which is a SARS-CoV receptor. A previous study indicated that procyanidin A2 has the highest SI (24) against HIV suggesting that it has a virucidal effect (De Bruyne et al., 1999) . Therefore it is possible that Fr.2 may contain both endocytosis inhibitor(s) and procyanidins, although we could not identify the substances which could inhibit endocytosis. The up-regulation of TfR by procyanidin is a puzzling phenomenon discovered in this experiment. It is known that proanthocyanidins and their related compounds have chelating activities (Scalbert et al., 2000) and depletion of Fe in cells or medium causes up-regulation of the TfR transcript. However, the up-regulation of mRNA was observed 24 h after the chelators were added (Xu et al., 2008) . Iron chelation by clinically relevant anthracyclines causes an alteration in the expression of iron-regulated genes and atypical changes in intracellular iron distribution and trafficking (Xu et al., 2008) . We could see the up-regulation within 15 min after the addition of procyanidins (Fig. 4) and it is also known that transferrin are the principal plasma proteins that bind wine catechins (Brunet et al., 2002) , therefore, the swift up-regulation of TfR may be caused by depletion of Tfn in the medium. It is of note that \u2423interferon induces depletion of the intracellular iron content and up-regulation of functional TfR on human epidermoid cancer KB cells (Caraglia et al., 1994) , and has also anti-SARS activities (Paragas et al., 2005; Tan et al., 2004; Barnard et al., 2006) . Although, the relationships between these two activities are not clear, the higher SI of procyanidin A2 could be explained by its up-regulation of TfR.",

The fraction also inhibited the internalization of TfR indicating the interference of clathrin-dependent endocytosis. The fraction also contained procyanidins which could have a virucidal effect and some of them showed up-regulation of TfR, probably by depleting transferrin and/or iron from the culture. The novel and complex biological activities of CC could lead to the amelioration of symptoms of a number of virus-infected diseases, including SARS.",
