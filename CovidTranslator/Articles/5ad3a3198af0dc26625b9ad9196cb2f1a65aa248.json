The disease spread rapidly, with cases reported from 29 countries on five continents over 4 months (1-7). By July 3, 2003 , this epidemic resulted in 8,439 reported cases globally, of which 812 were fatal (8) . Rapid identification of the causal agent as a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV) represents an extraordinary achievement in the history of global health and helped to contain the epidemic (7) . Nonetheless, the epidemiology and pathogenesis of SARS remain poorly understood, and definitive diagnostic tests or specific treatments are not established. Since the origin of the virus and its animal reservoirs remain to be defined, the potential for recurrence is unknown. This fact underscores the importance of establishing sensitive and efficient methods for diagnosis and surveillance.",

In contrast, polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based assays have the potential to detect infection at earlier time points.
