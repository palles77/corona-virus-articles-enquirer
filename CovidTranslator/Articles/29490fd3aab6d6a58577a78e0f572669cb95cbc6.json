            "text": "The field of public health includes a wide scope of activities and professional disciplines, ranging from sanitation, health protection, epidemiology, environmental health, financing, health promotion, including supervision, or the provision of clinical care. Each of these disciplines works in systems that face ethical dilemmas, making it important that public health workers have motivation to understand and practice within the ethical guidelines of their profession, thus making ethics an important component of training and practice. The dangers of ethical lapses are overwhelmingly apparent in the case of the Eugenics movement of the early 20 th century which metamorphosed from forced sterilizations in many liberal democratic countries into mass murder of physically and mentally handicapped children and adults in Nazi Germany. Between 1939 and 1941, 180 thousand psychiatric patients along with an equivalent number of handicapped children and adults were killed in an organized extermination program in Germany by lethal gassing. This method was then applied to the industrialized murder or Holocaust of six million Jews and millions of other \"untermenschen\" (sub human) in the greatest genocide in human history. Shortly after World War II ended the Nuremberg Trials of Nazi war criminals were conducted including medical doctors, and some were executed for crimes against humanity. This was followed by the 1948 United Nations Declaration on Human Rights and by the World Medical Association's Helsinki Declaration. Both are widely accepted as cornerstone documents-the latter specifically governing ethical standards related to human experimentation-and are revised regularly since being issued in 1964. But genocide has not disappeared, nor has unscrupulous experimentation such as the Tuskegee experiment on black Americans infected with syphilis and left untreated even after the availability of a cure, penicillin. Ethical standards are now required by \"Helsinki Committees\"ethical review boards-in most medical facilities worldwide. Ethical frameworks have evolved in part due to bitter experience of ethical failures later recognized and affecting public health standards of practice. Future generations of public health leaders and staff will face many ethical issues such as mandatory immunization of health workers and school children, and assisted death of terminally ill patients.",

The principle that saving a life is valued above all other religious considerations is of Biblical origins (i.e., Sanctity of Life or Pikuah Nefesh), where the saving of a life is equivalent to saving the world. This implies that all measures available are to be used, irrespective of the condition of the patient or the cost. But if sickness and death are seen as acts of God, possibly as punishment for sin, then prevention and treatment may be considered to be interfering with the Divine will, and ethical obligation may be limited to relief of suffering. Humanism balances these two ethical imperatives: saving of life and relief of suffering. Materialism may see health care as primarily a function to preserve health for societal well-being and economic prosperity.",

            "text": "The role of society in protecting the health of the population evolved during the latter 19 th century with the sanitation movement and the gradual development of safe water supply, safe management of sewage and waste, and food safety with pasteurization, improving living conditions as well as medical care and the widespread implementation of national health insurance. Countries in Europe and the Americas began to recognize public health as societal obligations at municipal, state and national levels as part of fundamental values and concepts of a society. The astonishing success of public health over the past century increased life expectancy in high-income countries by some 30 years, mostly through improved sanitation, nutrition, living conditions and disease control measures, as well as societal and medical advances making care available to all. In the 1970s, the Lalonde concept emerged that individual behavior was one of the key health determinants, along with human biology, environment and medical care (see Chapter 21) . This placed much of the responsibility for illness and its prevention on individual behavior, but at the same time fostered the development of health promotion as an essential component of public health theory and practice. All these points of view are involved in the ethical issues of the New Public Health (see Box 13.1). BOX 4 . Individual human rights: Liberty, privacy, protection from harm. 5. Solidarity: Sharing the burden of promoting and maintaining health. 6. Beneficence: Reduce harm and burdens of disease and suffering. 7. Proportionality: Restriction on civil liberties must be legal, legitimate, necessary, and use the least restrictive means available. 8. Reciprocity: All have a right to just treatment but share responsibility to ensure justice especially for those facing heavy social and health burdens. 9. Transparency: Honest and truthfulness in the manner and context in which decisions are made must be clear and accountable. 10. Precautionary: Duty to take preventive action to avoid harm even before scientific certainty has been established. 11. Responsibility to Act: Public health officials and policy-makers have a duty to act and implement preventive health measures demonstrated to be effective, safe, and beneficial to population health. Failure to enforce public health regulations with resulting disease or deaths may constitute negligence on the part of responsible officials with civil or even criminal penalties. 12. Equity: Reduce gender, ethnic, social, economic, geographic inequities. 13. Cost and benefits: Economic analysis and consideration of priorities. 14. Stewardship: Responsibility of governance to act in a trustworthy and ethical manner. 15. Trust: Cooperation between the many public and non governmental stakeholders in health. 16 . Evidence based: Decisions should be evidence-based, and revised, considering new evidence. 17. Responsive to needs: Address challenges as they may be anticipated and occur with close monitoring of health status.",

Money spent on new technology with only marginal medical advantages is often at the expense of well-tried and proven lower-cost techniques to prevent or treat disease. The potential benefits gained by the patient from more interventions are sometimes very limited in terms of length-or quality of life. These are difficult issues when the commitment to do all to preserve the life of the patient conflicts with the patient's concept of quality of life and his or her right to decline, or terminate heroic measures of intervention. Terminally ill patients may endure suffering during radical treatment, which may prolong life by only hours or days, clashing with the physician's ethical obligation to do no harm to the patient. The ethical value of sustaining the life of a suffering, terminally ill patient is a growing medical dilemma. The issue is even more complex when economic values are part of the equation. There is a potential conflict between the economic issues, the role of the physician in preserving life, the physician's obligation to do no harm, the felt needs of the patient and his or her family, and the needs of the community. The right of patients to seek euthanasia or assisted suicide in end-of-life situations is increasingly recognized and practiced in some jurisdictions.",

The dissonance between individual rights and community needs is a continuous issue in public health. Application of accepted public health measures for the benefit of people in society may require applying an intervention to everyone in a community or a nation. A democratic society ruled by law and legal protection of human rights may justifiably need to place limits on individual liberties to achieve the goal of reducing disease or injury in the population. Raising taxes and other restrictions on alcohol and tobacco products, laws on mandatory speed limits, driving regulations including seat belt usage, car seats for children and mandatory immunization for school attendance are examples of public health restrictive interventions which place limits on individuals but protect those individuals, their neighbors and the community-at-large from harm. Some forms of mass medication are accepted methods of public health practice to reduce the risk of disease in the population. Chlorination of community water supplies is a well-established, effective, and safe intervention to protect the public health. Fluoridation of drinking water to prevent tooth decay in children means that other persons are also drinking the same fluoridated water, which is of less direct benefit to them. Mandatory pasteurization of milk is an important standard for public health. Fortification of basic foods with vitamins and minerals is also a cost-effective community health measure and banning of trans fats to reduce heart disease, are all topics with advocates and opponents. The addition of folic acid to food as the most effective way to prevent neural tube defects (NTDs) in newborns is an intervention mandated by the US Food and Drug Administration (USFDA) and in over 80 other countries since 1998 (see Chapter 20) . Use of mass immunization is essential for infectious disease control and mass medication is successful for control of \"Neglected Tropical Diseases\".",

Public health policy is guided by two distinct but interactive paradigms; the biotechnological disease and the social-ecological health paradigms. In the 19 th century these were the Germ Theory and the Miasma Theories, long at loggerheads, yet both produced enormous gains in public health.

The Helsinki Declaration was first adopted by the World Medical Assembly in 1964, and amended in 1975, 1983, 1989, 1996, and 2013 . It delineates standards of medical experimentation and requires informed consent from subjects subjecting themselves to medical research. These Everyone has the right to a standard of living adequate for the health and well-being of himself and of his family, including food, clothing, housing, and medical care and necessary social services Declaration of Helsinki, 1964 Research must be in keeping with accepted scientific principles, and should be approved by specially appointed independent committees Biomedical research should be carried out by scientifically qualified persons, only on topics where potential benefits outweigh the risks, with careful assessment of risks, where the privacy and integrity of the individual is protected, and where the hazards are predictable. Publication must preserve the accuracy of research findings Each human subject in an experiment should be adequately informed of the aims, methods, anticipated benefits, and hazards of the study. Informed consent should be obtained, and a statement of compliance with this code Clinical research should allow the doctor to use new diagnostic or therapeutic measures if they offer benefit as compared to current methods (Continued ) standards have become the international norm for experiments, with national-, state-, and hospital-Helsinki committees regulating research proposals within their jurisdiction. Funding agencies require standard approval by the appropriate Helsinki committee, sometimes called Institutional Review Boards (IRBs) or Ethical Review Boards (ERBs), before considering any proposal, with informed consent on any research project. The process recognizes that medical progress is based on research that must include studies involving human subjects, but medical research is subject to ethical standards that promote and ensure respect for human subjects and protect their health and rights. The key issues examined include: humanist values and historical medical ethics of \"first, do no harm.\" The Tuskegee experiment, and a following similar study conducted by the USPHS in conjunction with the Ministry of Health in Guatemala, are remembered as important ethical transgressions which have had repercussions until the present time resulting in suspicion of public health endeavors, particularly among the African-American community in the US, even after a public apology in 1997 by then president Bill Clinton.",

The solidarity principle of societal shared responsibility for funding universal access to health care is based on equitable prepayment for health care for all by nationally regulated mechanisms through place of work or general revenues of government. A society may see universal access to health care as a positive value, and at the same time utilize incentives to promote or place limits on use of services or benefits to the individual such as hospital care, immunization, screening programs, prescription drugs and others. Some services may be arbitrarily excluded from health insurance, such as dental care, although this is to the detriment of children and a financial hardship for many. Strategies for program inclusion are often based on historical precedent rather than cost-effectiveness or evidence. While efforts are being made to include more children in the program, the Medicaid system in the US defines eligibility at income levels up to 133 percent of the poverty line, thus excluding a high percentage of the working poor.

Management of the epidemic was in some respects in conflict with the long-established role of public health of contacting and quarantining persons suffering from selected communicable diseases. It was not acceptable or feasible in modern society to require follow-up of case contacts or to isolate HIV carriers, at a time when there was no clinical cure with medications. However, this led to failure or delay of public health authorities, even in the late 1980s, to close public bathhouses in New York and other US cities where exposure to multiple same-sex partners promoted spread of a lethal disease, which could have been interpreted as negligence. During the 1980s, the politics of HIV/AIDS in the US centered on concerns in the community of men who have sex with men (MSM) that HIV testing could be used in a discriminatory manner.

Initially the vaccine was recommended for preteen girls to create protective antibodies to the virus before they became sexually active to prevent the possibility of sexually transmitted infection of the virus. Controversy arose over concern that this immunization of young girls might promote early onset of sexual activity. Gradually acceptance increased and other age groups of women were urged to take the vaccine. Boys were added to the recommended immunization target groups so as to reduce transmission of the virus, and to address male-to-male transmission via oral and anal sex. Inclusion of HPV vaccination requirement for school entry is under debate in the US, but parental refusals are increasing. CDC reports that HPV infects a large proportion of people in the US. Among adults aged 18\u00c059 it was 45 percent in men and 40 percent in women. Nearly 10,000 women in the US are diagnosed with cervical cancer each year and 3,700 women die. Cancer of the cervix has been massively reduced by routine Pap smears for early case-finding and treatment. The advent of an effective HPV vaccine promises to lower cancer of cervix rates even further. The disease is much more common in low-income countries where screening and HPV immunization are still very low on the health priorities list, so that cervical cancer is the second leading cancer killer of women worldwide. A recent survey conducted by the American Academy of Pediatrics result indicated that nearly 90 percent of pediatricians reported that they experienced parental vaccine refusals in 2013 compared to 75 percent in 2006.

When computed tomography (CT) was first introduced, Medicare in the US refused to insure this service as an untested medical technique. Due to a lack of facility resources such as incubators and poor prospects for the survivors, the Soviet health system considered newborns as living only if they weighed over 1,000 grams and survived more than seven days. Those under 1,000 grams who would be considered living by other international definitions, would be placed in a freezer to die. At the opposite extreme, many western medical centers use extreme and costly measures to prolong life in terminally ill patients, preserving life temporarily, but often with much suffering for the person and at great expense to the public system of financing health care.",

Such ethical failures occur frequently and widely. For example, is it unethical to not fortify grain products with folic acid and salt with iodine when there is overwhelming evidence of safety and cost effectiveness? Should there be a recommended European immunization program; should milk be fortified with vitamin D; should vitamin and mineral supplements be given to pregnant and lactating women, and children; should all newborns be given vitamin K intramuscularly routinely? Other examples include the issues of fluoridation of water supplies and opposition to genetically modified crops or generic drugs in African countries. These issues are continuously debated and the responsibility of the trained public health professional is to review the international literature on a topic 1. Public health should address the fundamental causes of disease and requirements for health, aiming to prevent adverse health outcomes. 2. Public health should achieve community health in a way that respects the rights of individuals in the community. 3. Public health policies, programs, and priorities should be developed and evaluated through processes that ensure an opportunity for input from community members. 4. Public health should advocate and work for the empowerment of disenfranchised community members, aiming to ensure that the basic resources and conditions necessary for health are accessible to all. 5. Public health should seek the information needed to implement effective policies and programs that protect and promote health. 6. Public health institutions should provide communities with the information they have that is needed for decisions on policies or programs and should obtain the community's consent for their implementation. 7. Public health institutions should act in a timely manner on the information they have within the resources and the mandate given to them by the public. 8.

Public health programs and policies should be implemented in a manner that most enhances the physical and social environment. and formulate a position based on the cumulative weight of evidence. It is not possible to wait for indisputable evidence because in epidemiology and public health, this rarely occurs. This is another reason that guidelines established by respected agencies and professional bodies free from financial obligations to vested interest groups are essential to review evidence which accumulates on a continuing basis on many issues thought to have been resolved or which appear de novo. A recent public health issue has been the banning of trans fats in baking and cooking, with legislation in New York City and some upstate New York State counties. The US Food and Drug Administration (USFDA) has declared trans fats, found in many popular processed foods, like baked goods and frozen foods, to be unsafe for consumption as they contribute to heart disease. The USFDA promotes manufacturer compliance and will regulate banning of use of trans fats by 2018, which is expected to reduce coronary heart disease and prevent thousands of fatal heart attacks every year. The USFDA reports that between 2003 and 2012, consumer trans fat consumption decreased about 78 percent and that the labeling rule and industry reformulation of foods were key factors in informing healthier consumer choices and reducing trans fat in foods. While trans fat intake has significantly decreased, the current intake remains a public health concern. The Institute of Medicine (IOM) recommends that consumption of trans fat be as low as possible while consuming a nutritionally adequate diet.",

Along with rising incidence of rickets in infancy due to lack of sun exposure and lack of vitamin D supplements in pregnancy care, birth defects and severe rickets are increasing especially among dark skinned mothers in full body clothing for religious reasons. Most consumers do not know that some processed food categories contain large amounts of trans fats. Consumption in some population groups, particularly poorer people, can be very high. Removing trans fats from the food supply is one of the most straightforward public health interventions for reducing the risk of cardiovascular diseases and some cancers, and improving diets. A study comparing myocardial infarctions in New York counties that banned trans fat usage to counties that did not showed a greater reduction in acute myocardial infarctions in the counties that had banned trans fats. The ethical issue will be to see the rate of acceptance of this finding in other jurisdictions versus traditional opposition to too much interference by the state. The same issue regarding folic acid fortification of flour to reduce birth defects is similarly both a professional and ethical question. Virtually all European countries have ignored the evidence and fail to adopt mandatory fortification thus harming poorer population groups with less money to buy healthier foods.

These include quarantine, isolation, and rationing of vaccines in short supply. Policy-makers and front-line care providers face difficult ethical questions in such cases which can be expected to occur with new challenges in the future. Support during the Ebola outbreak in West Africa in 2014\u00c016 and Zika spreading out from Brazil in 2016\u00c017 has been criticized as bumbling and inadequate, but did indicate strong levels of international cooperation and shared global concern. This most recent Ebola epidemic was the longest and most deadly in history, resulting in nearly 29,000 cases and over 11,000 deaths in Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone. Several potentially useful therapeutic agents were available in 2014 that had been tested on animals, and limited early studies of the safety of vaccine candidates for humans. However, the affected countries struggled to deal with the rapidly escalating epidemic and the growing number of patients. M\u00e9decins sans Fronti\u00e9re (MSF) provided the front-line treatment and infection control, and warned that the epidemic was \"out of control\" and would require a massive international response. First responders in many settings show the way in ethical behavior in calamitous situations such as the Syrian civil war where civilians as well as medical facilities are bombed and gassed deliberately by government and foreign forces. National, international, and local representatives play a critical role in preparing the global community for unexpected epidemics. Research, with sound clinical trials based on best practices for improving clinical care and vaccines for prevention to protect at risk populations, are needed during and between public health emergencies. Research efforts to develop vaccines for these emerging infectious diseases and others such as malaria and dengue are impressive and will hopefully bring forth lifesaving vaccines on large scales in the coming decade. In the case of Ebola, none of the clinical trials have reached definitive conclusions about efficacy in the search for therapeutics, but vaccine trials have identified vaccines that are safe and effective. The availability of financial, organizational, and professional resources to tackle such issues is an underlying problem of priority decision-making with professional, ethical, and moral standards.",

Public health as a profession and a movement or ideology must be willing to point out the effects of nonaction as well as of ethical or nonethical acts. Compliance with evil is unethical and the preparation of public health workers requires understanding of how to differentiate, and to how to advocate for the better choices in policy and its implementation.",

Dedicated courses in ethics should be included in public health education curricula to provide interested students with an opportunity for more in-depth study. 3. Public health ethics along with public health law should be included in criteria for curricula as \"cross cutting\" courses required by accreditation agencies. 4. Public health ethics orientation workshops should be provided to help teachers in all topic areas of the curriculum, core and elective, incorporate ethics in their teaching material. 5. The topic of public health ethics should be incorporated in ongoing educational programs for practitioners in the broad multi-disciplinary fields of public health. 6. Public awareness and engagement efforts that accompany public health programs and interventions should incorporate some measure of ethics education. 7. Critical thinking about the values involved in a public health controversy is vital to combat the public health problem in question. 8. Recognition that the concepts of social solidarity and obligations as well as individual rights are fundamental in public health practice. 9. Recognition that emergency preparedness and response includes mandatory immunizations such as measles and other public health measures as in influenza or cholera control immunization. 10 . Training in ethical studies should be part of public health training at all levels including continuing education. 11. Curriculum development should include awareness of ethical issues of artificial and natural catastrophes of the past century as well as current topics. 12. Case studies are valuable teaching tools and incorporated and examined in class discussion.",
