            "text": "Disulfides are conventionally viewed as structurally stabilizing elements in proteins but emerging evidence suggests two disulfide subproteomes exist. One group mediates the well known role of structural stabilization. A second redox-active group are best known for their catalytic functions but are increasingly being recognized for their roles in regulation of protein function. Redox-active disulfides are, by their very nature, more susceptible to reduction than structural disulfides; and conversely, the Cys pairs that form them are more susceptible to oxidation. In this study, we searched for potentially redox-active Cys Pairs by scanning the Protein Data Bank for structures of proteins in alternate redox states. The PDB contains over 1134 unique redox pairs of proteins, many of which exhibit conformational differences between alternate redox states. Several classes of structural changes were observed, proteins that exhibit: disulfide oxidation following expulsion of metals such as zinc; major reorganisation of the polypeptide backbone in association with disulfide redox-activity; order/disorder transitions; and changes in quaternary structure. Based on evidence gathered supporting disulfide redox activity, we propose disulfides present in alternate redox states are likely to have physiologically relevant redox activity.",

The second group are redoxactive and best known for their catalytic role in proteins such as thiol-disulfide oxidoreductases. An increasing role for the redox-active group in protein redox regulation is emerging. 1, 2 These disulfides act as redox-sensitive switches and are best viewed as posttranslational modifications akin to phosphorylation. It has now been established that oxidative regulation: important in processes such as the cell cycle, apoptosis, and response to oxidative stress; is an important control mechanism in the cytosol. Transient oxidation mediates control of enzymes, signaling pathways, as well as transcriptional and translational control. However, these characterized cytosolic proteins likely only represent the tip of the iceberg. Increasingly, reduction of disulfides is also emerging as a key regulator of protein function in oxidizing environments. [3] [4] [5] Importantly, ageing and several major diseases including neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, type II diabetes, cancer, and cardiovascular disease have been associated with abnormal redox conditions.",

            "text": "Structural and redox-active disulfides can be distinguished by their redox potentials. Disulfide redox potentials measured in thiol-disulfide oxidoreductases range from \u00c0120 to \u00c0270 mV. [6] [7] [8] [9] For disulfides serving structural purposes, the redox potential can be as low as \u00c0470 mV. 10 Computational methods for distinguishing the two groups would be a boon. Reactivity of a redox-active Cys is modulated by its immediate protein environment. In addition to the effects of the electrostatic environment, physical stress applied to a disulfide bond both through stretching and twisting enhances its reactivity. These forces can be applied to a protein dynamically 11 or may be captured during the protein folding process, rendering the disulfide poised to act upon exposure to variations in redox conditions. 12 Because of their enhanced reactivity, redoxactive disulfides are also more susceptible to cleavage/ oxidation under nonphysiologic conditions. For instance, redox-active disulfides are prone to cleavage by synchrotron radiation during the process of X-ray structure determination. [13] [14] [15] Other factors such as the pH of crystallization or the presence of mutations that change the electrostatic environment near a disulfide may also influence reactivity. Here, we mined the Protein Data Bank (PDB) 16 for highly similar proteins that have been solved in multiple redox states, that is, disulfide-bonded in one structure and reduced in another. We present evidence that most of the disulfides present in our Redox Pairs dataset are likely to be physiologically redox-active. Many of the proteins have known thiol-based redox activity, while others have a high likelihood of thiol-based redox activity based on their involvement with redox processes. We also observed and classified types of conformational changes which occur during redox transitions.",

The proteins belong to several major groups known to have redox activity. 11 unique Redox Pairs are associated with aerobic metabolism in eukaryotes or carbon fixation in plants (in groups D and E of Table S1); a further five are associated with maturation of proteins of these pathways (in groups E and G). Four Redox Pairs are associated with ion channel activity (group A): two of these, the chloride channel CLIC1 and the detoxification enzyme arsenate reductase, have known redox activity 17, 18 ; while a third, aquaporin, was recently implicated as a pore for the reactive oxygen species hydrogen peroxide, as part of the redox signaling process. 19 Seven Redox Pairs are associated with the cell cycle, a process known to be redox regulated 20 (Group B). Formation of disulfides involving the catalytic Cys in the phosphatases PR-1 and Cdc25B regulate their resident protein's function. 21 , 22 41 Redox Pairs (group d) are involved in transcriptional control, replication, and DNA synthesis including the oxidative stress response transcription factor OxyR 23 and ribonucleotide reductases from several species in multiple redox states. 24 12 Redox Pairs generated or destroyed reactive oxygen species (Groups F and Y).

From a redox point of view, a second variable -lability, is important. Some structural Zn sites expel Zn upon variation of physiological redox conditions, whereas others bind Zn tightly, and would not be expected to release Zn under physiological conditions. We refer to this first redox-regulated group as ''labile'' Zn sites; and the second, purely structural group, as ''inert.' ' We wished to determine whether Zn sites associated with Redox Pair disulfides detected in the study were labile or inert. The number of Zn ligands and their identity are key indicators of Zn site lability. For catalytic mononuclear Zn sites, three amino acids, which are often His, ligate the Zn. In binuclear Zn sites there are usually six ligands, and the carboxylated residues Asp and Glu predominate over His. 56, 57 Cys is more commonly found as a ligand in structural Zn sites which generally have four ligands. On consideration of ligand type alone, S 4 sites -those with four Cys ligands, are the most labile type of structural Zn site, and are almost as reactive as a free thiol. 58 Most of the structural Zn sites identified in this study were of the S 4 type (Table I) , suggesting they are labile. Four catalytic Zn sites were also found in the dataset. These catalytic Zn sites are highly unusual because of their utilization of Cys as a ligand instead of the more usual His, Glu, or Asp. Two of the catalytic sites are within BHMT and MetH: enzymes of sulfur metabolism, which is redox-regulated in plants. 2 Selection of sulfur ligands for Zn in these enzymes may confer an additional level of redox control on sulfur metabolism.",

For the remaining structures where the metal atom is retained in the oxidized structure, the shortened SG-SG distance may be caused by a heterogeneous mix of oxidized and reduced, metal-bound structures in the ensemble. We reasoned that if the metal was expelled from some members of the ensemble, or partially expelled (still in the site but held, for example, by only two of four potential ligating Cys), then the B-factor should be higher than for chains where no shortened SG-SG distances are observed. Although B-factors cannot be compared between different structures, for some of the redox pairs, different chains of the same structure in different disulfide redox states could be compared. Our analysis confirmed that the B-factor of the metal was higher in the oxidized chains for 80% of structures (see Fig. 3 ). A similar result was obtained for proteins with Fe-S clusters. There were no instances of expulsion of the Fe-S cluster from the oxidized structure but oxidation of Fe-ligating Cys residues to form disulfides was generally associated with a higher B-factor of the relevant Fe atom than Fe atoms where the ligating Cys remained reduced. In contrast, in reduced structures all Fe atoms of the Fe-S cluster had similar B-factors.",

Cys 199 in OxyR is known to undergo alternate modifications such as glutathionylation. 60 Because of the spectacular nature of the transition between the reduced and oxidized structures, and the existence of an alternate mode of redox regulation, the physiological relevance of the disulfide-linked structure has been called into question. 60 To determine whether the oxidized structure of OxyR is indeed an oddity, or if other proteins exhibit similar conformational changes, we systematically searched for morphing proteins in the dataset by scanning for protein structure pairs that exhibited large differences of the backbone torsional angles over at least seven contiguous residues. Changes in pseudo-dihedral angles calculated using four consecutive Ca atoms exceeding a summed threshold of 1000 degrees over seven consecutive residues were used to detect changes in secondary structure. Twenty-two parents were found in the fully reduced set and four in the partially reduced set (designated m in Supporting Information Table 1 ). Proteins showing the largest conformational changes are in Table II . These proteins include the Cl \u00c0 channel CLIC1: a protein that forms ion channels by inserting itself into membranes in response to oxidation; the detoxification enzyme arsenate reductase, which undergoes multiple conformational changes associated with a disulfide relay as part there is partial oxidation of the metal site, the B-factor of the metal should be higher because it has fewer ligands and hence more conformational freedom. This is true for most structures (bars above the axis). Standard errors are depicted where they could be calculated. Key to structures: Clostridium acetobutylicum thymidine kinase 1-1xx6; E. coli aspartate transcarbamylase 2-1r0b, 3-1tug; Thermotoga maritima Sir2 4-2h59; Homo Sapiens Sir2 5-1j8f; Equus caballus alcohol dehydrogenase 6-1axg; Bacillus subtilis Tryptophan RNA-binding attenuator protein-inhibitory protein (antiTRAP) 7-2bx9; severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus nonstructural protein 10 8-2g9t, 9-2ga6; Homo sapiens estrogen receptor 10-1hcq; Deinococcus radiodurans recombinational repair protein 11-1vdd; norovirus 3c-like protease 12-1wqs; Moorella thermoacetica bifunctional carbon monoxide dehydrogenase/acetyl-coa synthase 13 17, 61 and cyclic phosphodiesterase, a tRNA-splicing enzyme where the disulfide modulates access to the active site. 59 Like OxyR, several of these proteins exhibit large changes in Ca separations of the two Cys between alternate redox states (Table II) .

However, the reverse was true for the Thermotoga maritima tRNA-processing enzyme, Psi55s, where significant disorder of the protein chain concomitant with disulfide reduction occurred upon binding of the tRNA substrate fragment. 75 The introduction of disorder in this case may facilitate further co-operative binding of the RNA and protein after the initial docking step. 75 Analyses of the composition of disordered sequences have detected amino acid biases from global frequencies. In particular, aromatic amino acids and Cys are depleted in disordered sequences, whereas Lys is enriched. 76, 77 The disordered sequences in the Redox Pair dataset are also depleted in aromatics, in agreement with more general studies of disordered sequences, but are not depleted in Cys, or enriched in Lys; and thus do not conform entirely to previously detected sequence patterns. Redox Pair disordered sequences are instead enriched in oxygen-bearing sidechains such as Asp, Glu, Ser and Thr. Some changes in secondary structure are also apparent during the order/disorder transitions. In the oxidized state, both Cys residues generally reside on coil in their proteins, but for a small number of pairs the oxidized form has a secondary structure that ''melts'' upon reduction of the disulfide.

The A subunit of spinach chloroplast GAPDH in a reduced, monomeric form (PDB 2hki) is shown on the right and the oxidized homotetramer in complex with NAD \u00fe (PDB 1nbo) is shown on the left. In higher plants, photosynthetic GAPDH exists in vivo mainly as heteromeric isoforms, A 2 B 2 and A 8 B 8 being the most abundant, interconvertible conformations. The B subunit is homologous to the A subunit but has an additional nonhomologous Cterminal extension. Stable homotetramers of A subunits (A 4 -GAPDH) are found at low levels in chloroplast preparations and may be the only form of photosynthetic GAPDH present in unicellular green algae and cyanobacteria. Calvin cycle enzymes are known, as a group, to be redox regulated. 85 The activity of the AB isoform of chloroplast GAPDH is redox regulated by formation of a disulfide between C-terminal thiols in the nonhomologous part of the B chain in light, and its reduction in the dark. 86 The interchain disulfide between A subunits may be important for redox control of the A 4 isoform, which is known to form complexes with the small chloroplast protein CP12 and phosphoribulosekinase in the dark. 87 The disulfide-forming Cys 200 (1nbo numbering) is not present in the B subunit of chloroplast GAPDH which is transcribed from a different gene, or in cytosolic GAPDHs.

Inadvertent triggering of redox-active disulfide switches is a likely contributor to these phenotypes. This view is supported by the association of several Redox Pairs in the dataset with disease. SOD1 (also known as CuZn-SOD) is an enzyme mutated in familial lateral sclerosis (FALs), an age-dependent degenerative disorder of motor neurons in the spinal cord, brain stem and brain. SOD1 is largely localized to the cytosol but is also found in the intermembrane space of mitochondria. SOD1 is activated by formation of the disulfide and insertion of Cu by the copper carrier CCS. Both of these proteins are represented in the Redox Pair dataset (Tables I and S2 ). The conserved disulfide in SOD1 is essential for activity and unusual because it remains oxidized in the cytosol. Although the disulfide is intrachain, it is thought to play a critical role in stabilizing the SOD1 homodimer. Formation of the disulfide is part of the SOD1 maturation process which is regulated by physiological oxidative stress. The three reduced proteins in the dataset are three distinct mutants associated with familial lateral sclerosis (FALs): G37R, H46R, and I113T. The exclusive association of the reduced proteins with the disease mutants suggests redox imbalance of this disulfide is implicated in the disease. This hypothesis is supported by the finding that 14 FALs mutants have the common property of being more susceptible to disulfide reduction than wild-type protein. 97 Toxicity associated with disulfide-linked multimerization of SOD1 mutants has recently been implicated in the disease mechanism. 98 ",

Zn is not expelled from all protein Zn-binding sites with equal facility, and is probably not expelled from some sites at all under physiologic conditions. For structural Zn sites an analogous situation may exist to the bipartite distribution of redox-active and structural disulfides in proteins, with labile Zn sites being redox-active and inert Zn sites corresponding to the purely structural group. Key to Zn expulsion under oxidizing conditions is the presence of oxidation-prone Cys as a Zn ligand. Sites with more Cys are likely to be more facile.

Upon exposure to elevated temperatures, the Cterminal domain swings away from the protein's center of mass, exposing the Zn centre. The N-terminal thiols in the Zn site, Cys 232 and Cys 234, are preferentially oxidatively modified. The remaining two Cys, 269 and 272, form a disulfide of the BDD type, releasing Zn and unfolding the C-terminal domain. Unfolding the C-terminus removes a steric barrier to dimerization, activating the protein's chaperone function. The function of disulfide formation between Cys 269 and 272 in the Zn binding site has not been fully delineated. Potential benefits are protection from other oxidation modifications and restriction of the conformational freedom of the protein chain allowing easier refolding upon return of the protein's milieu to normal conditions. However, these benefits apply to any disulfide and the repeated appearance of the BDD in labile Zn sites of proteins of the Redox Pair dataset suggests a more specific function, possibly recognition by a foldase or metallochaperone. We hypothesize the forbidden disulfide would become stressed upon condensation of the b-sheet in its vicinity, 12 possibly allowing easier re-insertion of Zn. Without any detailed experiments as a guide, the significance of the other repeated forbidden disulfide motif, the JSD, is not clear, but the same arguments relating to its forbidden disulfide nature would apply. The JSD-containing proteins MetH and BHMT are known to be reversibly inactivated by disulfide formation. 100 In vitro, BHMT can be reactivated by dialysis against DTT and Zn, 101 but the specific method of reactivation in vivo has not been characterized.",

Energetically, formation of a disulfide bond between Cys residues would have a favorable entropic contribution to the stability of the chain. A notable exception is Leu-tRNA synthetase where the more ordered reduced structure binds Zn (Fig. 5(B) ). This may be generally true for order/disorder transitions associated with labile Zn sites: the Zn-bound state is entropically favored over a single disulfide because the polypeptide chain is constrained at three or four points instead of two. 40 A subset of Redox Pair proteins exhibiting order/ disorder transitions correlated with disulfide redox status contain regions of disorder in excess of 20% of the protein chain. All the proteins in this group exist as dimers with the other monomer being more ordered. The disordered monomers in these class D structures may correspond to the Molten Globule state. For these proteins, the Molten Globule state adopted may be physiologically relevant to their function. Molten Globules are collapsed forms of the protein chain which have some native-like secondary structure but a dynamic tertiary structure as seen by far and near circular dichroism spectroscopy, respectively. The Radius of Gyration of proteins in the Molten Globule state is $10% larger than the native state but precise tertiary structures at atomic resolution have not yet been obtained for commonly studied Molten Globule proteins such as lactoglobulin A. However, one of the proteins in group D: Platelet Factor 4, which like hepatocyte growth factor, binds heparin and regulates angiogenesis, has been shown to adopt the Molten Globule state upon reduction of its disulfides. 102 It seems likely proteins in group D adopt a Molten Globule state in vivo but can also adopt more ordered states upon binding of appropriate ligands. Several of the proteins bind large polymers such as RNA and heparin and the order/disorder transitions may mediate co-operative behavior between monomers.",

The current paradigm, due to Anfinsen, is that the primary sequence of a protein encodes a unique three-dimensional structure. Various discoveries that have challenged this notion include the spectacular pH-induced conformational change in influenza A haemagglutinin (HA), 105 molecular chaperones, and the previously discussed disordered sequences. All of these discoveries have been difficult to reconcile with the concept that protein sequences adopt a unique minimally frustrated fold. HA is believed to be kinetically trapped in a higher energy fold by an N-terminal domain which is subsequently cleaved, allowing it to cascade into a minimally frustrated fold. The conformations of disordered sequences appear to be principally governed by entropic factors: weak sequence preferences for a variety of conformational substates or modes appear to be co-selected by ligands. Morphing structures appear to be a new type of challenge to the concept of a unique minimally frustrated fold. For morphing sequences, the structure appears to be dependent on the environment. Unlike influenza A HA, where kinetic trapping during the folding process clearly plays a part in the structure adopting two different folds, for morphing sequences the two folds are energetic minima for the sequence in a particular environment. As such structural changes are reversible and dependent on environment.",

The most spectacular morphing transition is that of CLIC1, where an entire subdomain of the protein rearranges in response to different redox conditions. Several Redox Pairs were found exhibiting large morphing conformational transitions of similar magnitude to OxyR, supporting the notion that these types of transitions may be reasonably common. Large separations of the Cys residues in the reduced state are a typical feature of these proteins, and do not preclude disulfide linkages forming. Possibly attack by a helper molecule, such as glutathione, may be required as an intermediate in disulfide formation to bridge the intervening distance. Large physical separation of partner Cys residues may represent an example of negative Morphing transitions are not limited to changes in disulfide redox status. Other morphing transitions not associated with disulfide redox state have been noted in Mad2 and lymphotactin.

In 1995, based on structures of Arc repressor, Sauer proposed the existence of evolutionary bridging states. A substructure in wild-type Arc repressor adopts a b-strand conformation which forms a two-stranded b-sheet with the adjacent monomer. In the N11L mutant of Arc repressor, the substructure was shown to fluctuate between the native state and a helical state on a millisecond time scale. A double mutant known as ''switch Arc'' (N11L, L12N) was shown to be stabilized in the alternate helical conformation. Sauer proposed the fluctuating N11L mutant represented an evolutionary bridge between two stable low energy folds. Proteins that can adopt two different folds from the same sequence could evolve two different functions upon gene duplication and mutation hence acting as an evolutionary bridge between two different folds. 109 It is clear morphing proteins could also act as bridge states: deselection of one state over the other by point mutation may lead to loss of the ability to morph in the daughters resulting in proteins with different but related folds.",

We used ProFit (www.bioinf.org.uk/software/profit) to search for large conformational changes such as hinge movements. ProFit superimposes two structures using Ca atoms and was used to calculate RMSD and distances between residues. Large movements were indicated by the change in distance between the sulfur groups of the Cys residues in a disulfide.",

Large conformational changes between structure-pairs corresponding to rearrangements of the polypeptide backbone were also identified using an implementation of a method by Flocco and Mowbray. 117 For pairs of structures, the method compares the change in a pseudo-torsional angles defined by four consecutive Ca-atoms. Conformational changes were identified by running a smoothing window (five residues long) over the torsional-difference plot. Stretches of contiguous residues with seven or more pseudo-dihedral angles that exhibited individual movements in excess of 20 were initially filtered from the dataset. These conformational changes were further classified by comparing DSSP annotations, solvent accessibility and secondary structure, between the protein pairs. Proteins with conformational changes where the summed changes in the pseudo-torsional angles exceeded a threshold of 1000 degrees with accompanying secondary structure changes were classified as morphing. The presence or absence of multiple chains in the PDB structure could cause errors when calculating changes in solvent accessibility; therefore, DSSP was run on individual chains only. All solvent accessibility measures were normalized using values derived by Chothia. 118 Each amino acid was assigned to one of two states; core or exposed. Core residues are those with a solvent accessibility of less than 10% and exposed residues are those with a solvent accessibility equal to 10% or more. Secondary structures were assigned to one of three states: helix, strand and coil.",
