Inactivated GZ50 was used to immunize mice intranasally either alone, or after precipitation with polyethylene glycol (PEG), or with CpG, or CTB as an adjuvant. The titer of serum neutralizing antibodies was up to 1:640. In mice immunized with adjuvants or PEG precipitated GZ50, specific IgA was detected in tracheal-lung wash fluid by immunofluorescence. Though serum antibodies were detected, no anti-SARS-IgA could be detected in mice immunized only with inactivated GZ50. The roles of adjuvants in intranasal immunization with inactivated.

Among all the possible approaches to developing vaccines against SARS, inactivated SARS-CoV vaccine ranks at the top of the list, because of the high replication competency of this virus in cell cultures [1] , well-established inactivation processes with other coronaviruses and previous success in using the inactivated feline coronavirus vaccine for prevention of this disease [6] . To date, the pathogenesis of SARS has not yet been fully studied, however, the possible roles of host anti-SARS-CoV immune responses have been suggested in severe clinical cases [7] . In addition, antibody-mediated enhancement in feline coronavirus infection has been documented [8] . The risk of a SARS-CoV antibody enhancement phenomenon mediated by inactivated vaccine induced antibodies in vaccines need to be seriously considered. Intranasal immunization using an inactivated SARS-CoV vaccine could be effective both by blocking the live SARS-CoV at the site of entry and inducing antibodies in the respiratory tract and in serum. Besides, if virus infection can be blocked at the site of entry, there may be less risk for the vaccines to develop antibody enhancement phenomenon. Herein, we report the experimental immunization of mice by inactivated SARS-CoV in mice. Specific IgA was detected in tracheal-lung wash fluid and neutralizing antibodies in serum in intranasally immunized mice.",

The strain was first isolated using FRhK4 cell line and was further passaged in Vero cells. After inoculation of this virus at 10 5 TCID 50 per T25 flask (Greiner Labortechnik, Germany), CPE was detected as early as 24 h and peaked at 72 h. Serial passages of GZ50 strain in Vero cells consistently yielded CPE and the virus titer was between 10 6.5 and 10 7 TCID 50 . Full-length sequencing and phylogenetic analysis showed that GZ50 laid between the reported Hong Kong strains, the Canadian and US strains [9] . To study whether it shared antigenicity with virus strains from other cities in China, acetone fixed GZ50-infected cells were used to react with convalescent sera from Hong Kong, Guangdong and Shanghai patients. All convalescent sera showed a similar positive titer by indirect immunofluorescent assay (data not shown).",

Wells were treated with inactivated viruses in triplicates for 1 h at 36.5 \u2022 C, while controls were cells treated only with the culture medium. One hundred microliters of live GHGZ virus (10 7 copies of viral genome/ml) at 10 \u22121 to 10 \u22127 dilutions were added to the inactivated virus treated wells and the control wells, and CPE was recorded for up to 72 h after the inoculation of live virus.

All manipulations were done in a BSL-3 hood in the BSL-3 laboratory. The blocking effect of inactivated virus was judged visually.

Though the inactivated virus was only partially purified, experimental immunization in mice yielded interesting results. Since SARS-CoV is a newly described virus and intranasal delivery of this inactivated virus has not been explored; the aim of this study was to investigate whether this approach of immunizatioin could induce serum antibodies and local antibodies.

In this study we used CPG-ODN and CTB as adjuvants and PEG-precipitated inactivated virus was used to potentiate the uptake of the inactivated viruses by antigen presenting cells, and to maintain inactivated viruses at the site of administration. After four intranasal doses of the inactivated virus, serum anti-SARS-CoV neutralizing antibodies were detected, but no anti-SARS-IgA was found in the tracheal-lung wash fluid. In contrast, when the inactivated virus was co-administered intranasally with adjuvant (either CPG or CTB), both serum anti-SARS-CoV neutralizing antibodies and specific IgA in tracheal-lung wash fluid were detected (Table 2, Fig. 2 ). These results indicate that local IgA antibodies could only be induced by combining the inactivated virus and adjuvant. On the other hand, in mice immunized subcutaneously, with inactivated virus, aside from high titer of serum neutralizing antibodies, specific anti-SARS-IgG also could be detected in tracheallung wash fluid. However, no anti-SARS-IgA was detected, which indicated that the antibodies detected in the tracheal- lung fluid was not produced locally, but derived from serum antibodies.",

CpG-ODN is non-toxic and induces effective humoral and cellular immune responses in hosts [20, 21] . It is thus a promising adjuvant to be used with SARS-CoV for intranasal immunization. In our previous report of using CpG-ODN with HBsAg-ani-HBs complex by intranasal immunization in mice, it was suggested that a selective stimulation of humoral response or cellular response depended on different constructs of antigens [22] . Future studies of using other constructs of inactivated SARS-CoV with CpG ODN by intranasal delivery might induce both cell mediated immune immune responses and antibody responses. Due to the lack of available peptides and antigen for studying SARS-CoV CTL or cell proliferation responses, the cellular immune responses in the SARSV-CoV intranasally immunized mice were not studied. As both cell-mediated immune response and humoral immune responses are important for SARS protection, these studies will be done whenever production of more inactivated virus will be approved. PEG has been used for the purification of inactivated HAV vaccines [23] , and PEG-interferon has already been used in clinical trials for treatment of viral hepatitis B and C [24] . So far no serious ill effects have been described. We therefore used PEG precipitated SARS-CoV inactivated virus for intranasal immunization of mice. Because the number of animals used in each intranasal immunized group was limited, no statistical differences could be drawn between groups. However, compared to the dosage being used with CPG. As the adjuvant, only half the dosage of inactivated virus was necessary to induce both local and serum specific antibodies by using PEG precipitate as the adjuvant. This precipitated inactivated virus is therefore also a good candidate for development of intranasal SARS-CoV inactivated vaccine.",

The results on the blocking assay confirmed that the inactivated virus could block the replication of live virus in cells. Because no other strain of live virus was available, we could not study whether inactivated GZ50 could block other SARS-CoV strains. Recently, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 has been reported as a functional receptor for the SARS-CoV [25] . Whether the successful blocking of inactivated GZ50 versus live GZ50 was associated with this receptor remains to be studied. Besdies, the present blocking effect was only shown in cell culture, it would be interesting to do blocking experiments in animal models. If similar results were obtained, inactivated virus could be used intranasally as an urgent preventive measure when an outbreak occurred. Though due to technical problems the neutralizing function of the IgA in tracheal-lung wash fluid has not been confirmed, the successful induction of IgA antibodies against SARS-CoV by intranasal immunization suggested that SARS-CoV could be blocked at he site of entry, and would protect the vaccinated recipients from SARS-CoV infection. Even if the virus broke through this front-line, serum-neutralizing antibodies could further interact and neutralize the virus. This presumption should however be validated in an animal model mimicking SARS [26] .",
