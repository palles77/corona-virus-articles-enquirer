Previously, we found that MHV-JHM neurovirulence was marked by diminished expression of interferon-g (IFN-g) mRNA and a reduced presence of CD8 T cells in the CNS concomitant with heightened macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP)-1 transcript levels and greater macrophage infiltration relative to MHV-A59 infection. Here, the ability of the S and non-spike genes to regulate these immune responses was evaluated using chimeric viruses. Chimeric viruses WTR13 and S4R22 were made on MHV-A59 variant backgrounds and, respectively, contained the S gene of MHV-A59 and MHV-JHM. Unexpectedly, genes other than S appeared to modulate events critical to viral replication and survival. Unlike unresolving MHV-JHM infections, the clearance of WTR13 and S4R22 infections coincided with strong IFN-g transcription and an increase in the number of CD8 T cells infiltrating into the CNS. However, despite the absence of detectable viral titers, approximately 40% of S4R22-infected mice succumbed within 3 weeks, indicating that the enhanced mortality following S4R22 infection was not associated with high viral titers. Instead, similar to the MHV-JHM infection, reduced survival following S4R22 infection was observed in the presence of elevated MIP-1a and MIP-1h mRNA accumulation and enhanced macrophage numbers within infected brains. These observations suggest that the S protein of MHV-JHM influences neurovirulence through the induction of MIP-1a-and MIP-1h-driven macrophage immunopathology. D",

Infections with viruses containing the MHV-A59/Alb4 background (WTR13 and S4R22) were resolved, coincident with stronger IFN-g mRNA expression and a greater number of CD8 T cells within the brain, regardless of the origin of the S gene. The kinetics and level of the IFN-h and IL-6 mRNA accumulation also co-segregated with genes other than S MHV-A59 or S MHV-JHM . Despite the impaired viral replication, S4R22-infected mice exhibited enhanced mortality compared to MHV-A59 and WTR13 infections. However, critically morbid S4R22infected mice had increased MIP-1a and MIP-1h mRNA accumulation and elevated macrophage levels within the brain reflective of MHV-JHM infection.

In MHV-JHM infection, a similar proportion of CD8 T cells was capable of IFN-g synthesis in response to anti-CD3 (24.2%) and viral peptides (21.6%), resulting in a response ratio (viral peptide/anti-CD3) of 0.89. This indicated that most of the anti-CD3 response could be accounted for by the viral epitopes. Independent of the source of S gene, the presence of the MHV-A59 variant background reduced this value to 0.29 and 0.45 following WTR13 and S4R22 infection, respectively. Thus, the majority of the anti-CD3 response following MHV-JHM infection could be accounted for by the known viral CD8 epitopes.

This variation in viral pathology has been attributed to differences in the S protein between the two viruses. Here, the ability of the S and non-spike proteins to induce immune elements unique to MHV-JHM and MHV-A59 infections using viral chimeras WTR13 and S4R22 was examined. Unexpectedly, it was found that genes other than S were critical in controlling viral titers and inducing IFN-g and CD8 responses known to be protective in MHV infection (Marten et al., 2001) . In contrast, the enhanced mortality due to the presence of the S MHV-JHM protein in MHV-JHM and S4R22 infections was associated with the up-regulation of MIP-1a and MIP-1h mRNA transcripts and increased macrophage infiltration into the CNS. Taken together, this suggests that the S MHV-JHM protein contributes to neurovirulence through the induction of macrophage-driven immunopathology as opposed to enhanced viral replication in the CNS.",

As expected from these and other reports, intracranial (i.c.) inoculation of MHV-JHM was lethal even at 10 PFU (Fig. 1A) . Mice infected a similar dose of S4R22 exhibited a 40% decrease in survival relative to WTR13 infections (Fig. 1A ). This is supported by a previous report (which also observed impaired S4R22 replication on day 5; Phillips et al., 1999) . However, our study demonstrated that, in marked contrast to MHV-JHM infection, S4R22-infected mice succumbed to infection in the absence of detectable viral growth by day 7, suggesting that enhanced S4R22 virulence was not associated with viral replication (Fig. 1C) . Thus, although enhanced neurovirulence could be attributed to the presence of the S MHV-JHM protein, the ability of MHV-JHM to grow to high titer within the CNS depended on genes other than S.",

            "text": "The magnitude and extent of the induced host immune response is a critical factor in resolving viral infections. Therefore, we directly evaluated the influence of the S protein on the two immunological elements demonstrated to be required for MHV clearance, CD8 T-cell and IFN-g responses (Marten et al., 2001) . The number of CD8 T cells in MHV-JHM-infected brains was decreased twofold or more as compared to WTR13-and S4R22-infected brains (Fig. 2) , indicating that the impaired CD8 infiltration observed in MHV-JHM-infected brain was independent of S MHV-JHM . Thus, the reduced CD8 T-cell number following MHV-JHM infection may reflect a non-spike gene which actively inhibits or induces apoptosis in CD8 T cells (Rempel et al., 2004) in a mechanism similar to the MHV E protein triggering of 17C1-1 cell apoptosis . Mononuclear cells isolated from infected brains were stimulated with either anti-CD3 which activates antigen-experienced T cells (Yee et al., 1994) , or viral peptides. CD8 cells from MHV-JHM-and S4R22-infected brains produced IFN-g in response to the two known CD8 epitopes S510 and S598 on the S MHV-JHM . However, the CD8 cell response from S4R22-infected brains (13.6%) was almost half that from MHV-JHM-infected brains (21.6%; Fig. 3B ). As result, independent of S MHV-JHM or S MHV-A59 , but in the presence of the MHV-A59 variant non-spike genes, the known epitopes accounted for a fraction of the total potential for IFN-g production seen upon anti-CD3 stimulation (Fig. 3B) , enhancing the support for critical CD8 epitopes on the MHV-A59 background. This greater number of IFN-g+ CD8 T cells may be responsible for the lower S4R22 titers at day 5 and the subsequent resolution of both S4R22 and WTR13 infections (Figs. 3C and 1C). Therefore, genes other than S appear to have considerable influence over both the quantity and the quality of the CD8 T-cell response, perhaps involving an immunodominant epitope or a CD8 T-cell mitogenic element on the MHV-A59 background.",

In MHV-JHM-infected mice, the levels of IFN-g transcript were reduced compared to WTR13 and S4R22 infections. Conversely, IFN-h mRNA accumulation was sustained only throughout the course of MHV-JHM infection (Fig. 4) , indicating that genes other than S regulated IFN-g and IFN-h mRNA expression. Many viruses have components that alter interferon activity including hepatitis C and Ebola viruses (Basler et al., 2000; Song et al., 1999) . Swine coronavirus M and E proteins are able to induce IFN-a synthesis in compatible leukocyte populations (Baudoux et al., 1998) , supporting the potential ability of non-spike MHV proteins, such as M and E, to influence interferon gene transcription. Moreover, our finding that non-spike genes appear responsible for the sustained level of IL-6 mRNA in MHV-JHM infection is collaborated by Zhang et al. (1998) , who found that enhanced IL-6 mRNA accumulation could be attributed to the MHV-JHM hemagglutinin-esterase gene. The increase in IL-6 message was associated with greater survival, not mortality, indicating that IL-6 transcription was controlled by specific viral elements like hemagglutinin -esterase as opposed to being induced by a non-specific pro-inflammatory response resulting from high viral titers.",

MIP-1a and MIP-1h are chemotactic for macrophages and other leukocytes. The extent of clinical disease in S4R22-infected mice positively correlated with MIP-1a and MIP-1h mRNA levels. RNA samples from S4R22-infected mice with high disease scores, which mimicked IFN-g, IFN-h, and IL-6 mRNA profiles from WTR13-infected mice (Fig. 4) , here reflected MIP-1a and MIP-1h transcript accumulation in MHV-JHM-infected brains (Fig. 5A ). This ability of discrete viral elements to specifically induce MIP-1a and MIP-1h mRNA concomitant with fatal neurologic disease was previously demonstrated with the insertion of an envelope gene from a neurovirulent oncornavirus strain into a nonvirulent strain (Askovic et al., 2001) . More specifically in MHV, the gene segment responsible for MIP-1a production and virulence may be linked to a deletion in the S MHV-JHM protein found in the neuroattenuated MHV-JHM derivative V5A13.1, which induces elevated MIP-1h mRNA, without similar increases in MIP-1a transcript levels (Lane et al., 1998) . A chemotactic target of MIP-1a and MIP-1h, macrophages are also critical in the development of CNS disease, including MHV-induced pathology (Drescher et al., 2000; Wu and Perlman, 1999; Xiong et al., 1999) . The potential impact of these chemokines on macrophage infiltration was directly evaluated by flow cytometric analysis (Figs. 5B and C). Cohort cells from MHV-JHM-and S4R22-infected mice with high disease scores exhibited an approximately threefold increase in the numbers of CD45 high/FcgR high or CD45 high/CD11b high cells per brain as compared to WTR13 infections (Fig. 5C ). It is unlikely that these markers describe either NK cells, since NK1.1+ cells were similarly present in MHV-JHM-and MHV-A59-infected brains (Rempel et al., 2004) , or B cells, since a greater percentage of B220+ cells were observed in MHV-A59infected brains than in MHV-JHM-infected brains (unpublished data, Rempel and Buchmeier) . In S4R22 infections resulting in low disease scores, the proportion of macrophages is intermediate, confirming the ability of the S MHV-JHM protein to induce macrophage infiltration. However, estimates of the numbers of macrophages in these brains were noticeably lower than those from cohort mice with high disease scores. In contrast, the limited capacity of WTR13 to induce MIP-1a and MIP-1h transcripts or macrophage infiltration was not associated with clinical disease. Thus, the apparent ability of the S MHV-JHM to recruit macrophages into the brain, despite the absence of viral replication, appeared to be a source for the heightened morbidity and mortality associated with S4R22 infections. Whether the ability of the S MHV-JHM protein to induce MIP-1a and MIP-1h results from differences in tropism and/or the active induction of certain cellular genes within a population is a focus of future study.",

Briefly, disease scores ranged as follows: 0, no clinical signs; 1, ruffled hair; 2, ruffled hair, hunched back, and slight impairment in mobility; 3, ruffled hair, hunched back, and extreme impairment of mobility; and 4, mortality. Animals with scores of 1 or below were designated as having a low disease score. Animals with disease scores above 1 were classified as having a high disease score. As expected, infection with 10 PFU of the highly virulent MHV-JHM resulted in high disease scores, whereas, clinical disease was generally not evident when mice were inoculated with 10 PFU of WTR13 (Fig. 1) . Therefore, WTR13 was also given at 1000 PFU in the event that the severity of clinical disease reflected the extent of the immune response. At 10 PFU, S4R22 infections resulted in either mild or severe clinical disease. To be able to decipher between potential differences in immune activity, S4R22-infected mice were divided into high disease score and low disease score groups as opposed to averaging all S4R22 results.",
