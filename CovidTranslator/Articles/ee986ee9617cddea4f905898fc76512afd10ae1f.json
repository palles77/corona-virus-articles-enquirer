Novel human-infecting viruses are difficult to detect with standard bioinformatics workflows. Here, we predict whether a virus can infect humans directly from next-generation sequencing reads. We show that deep neural architectures significantly outperform both shallow machine learning and standard, homology-based algorithms, cutting the error rates in half and generalizing to taxonomic units distant from those presented during training. We propose a new approach for convolutional filter visualization to disentangle the information content of each nucleotide from its contribution to the final classification decision. Nucleotide-resolution maps of the learned associations between pathogen genomes and the infectious phenotype can be used to detect virulencerelated genes in novel agents, as we show here for the 2019-nCoV coronavirus, unknown before it caused a pneumonia outbreak in December 2019.",

            "text": "Within a globally interconnected and densely populated world, pathogens can spread more easily than they ever did before. As the recent outbreaks of Ebola and Zika viruses have shown, the risks posed even by these previously known agents remain unpredictable and their expansion hard to control (Calvignac-Spencer et al., 2014) . What is more, it is almost certain that more unknown pathogen species and strains are yet to be discovered, given their constant, extremely fast-paced evolution and unexplored biodiversity, as well as increasing human exposure (Vouga & Greub, 2016; Trappe et al., 2016) . Some of those novel pathogens may cause epidemics (similar to the SARS and MERS coronavirus outbreaks in 2002 and 2012) or even pandemics (e.g. the \"swine flu\" H1N1/09 influenza A strain). Many have more than one host or vector, which makes assessing and predicting the risks even more difficult. For example, Ebola has its natural reservoir most likely in fruit bats (Leendertz et al., 2016) , but causes deadly epidemics in both humans and chimpanzees. As the state-of-the art approach for the open-view detection of pathogens is genome sequencing (Lecuit & Eloit, 2014; Calistri & Pal\u00f9, 2015) , it is crucial to develop automated pipelines for characterizing the infectious potential of currently unidentifiable sequences.",

            "text": "Several computational, genome-based methods exist that allow to predict the host-range of a bacteriophage (a bacteriainfecting virus). A selection of composition-based and alignment-based approaches has been presented in an extensive review by Edwards et al. (2016) . Prediction of eukariotic host tropism (including humans) based on known protein sequences was shown for the influenza A virus (Eng et al., 2014) . Two recent studies employ k-mer based, k-NN classifiers and deep learning (Mock et al., 2019) to predict host range for a small set of three well-studied species directly from viral sequences. While those approaches are limited to those particular species and do not scale to viral host-range prediction in general, the Host Taxon Predictor (HTP) (Ga\u0142an et al., 2019) uses logistic regression and support vector machines to predict if a novel virus infects bacteria, plants, vertebrates or arthropods. Yet, the authors argue that it is not possible to use HTP in a read-based manner; it requires long sequences of at least 3,000 nucleotides. This is incompatible with modern metagenomic next-generation sequencing workflows, where the DNA reads obtained are at least 10-20 times shorter. Another study used gradient boosting machines to predict reservoir hosts and transmission via arthropod vectors for known human-infecting viruses (Babayan et al., 2018) . Zhang et al. (2019) designed several classifiers explicitly predicting whether a new virus can potentially infect humans. Their best model, a k-NN classifier, uses k-mer frequencies as features representing the query sequence and can yield predictions for sequences as short as 500 base pairs (bp). It worked also with 150bp-long reads from real DNA sequencing runs, although in this case the reads originated also from the viruses present in the training set (and were therefore not \"novel\").",

An \"unknown\" nucleotide (N ) can be represented as an all-zero vector. CNNs and LSTMs have been successfully used for a variety of DNA-based prediction tasks. Early works focused mainly on regulation of gene expression in humans (Alipanahi et al., 2015; Zhou & Troyanskaya, 2015; Zeng et al., 2016; Quang & Xie, 2016; Kelley et al., 2016) , which is still an area of active research (Greenside et al., 2018; Nair et al., 2019; Avsec et al., 2019) . In the field of pathogen genomics, deep learning models trained directly on DNA sequences were developed to predict host ranges of three multi-host viral species (Mock et al., 2019) and to predict pathogenic potentials of novel bacteria (Bartoszewicz et al., 2019) . DeepVirFinder (Ren et al., 2018) and ViraMiner (Tampuu et al., 2019) can detect viral sequences in metagenomic samples, but they cannot predict the host and focus on previously known species.

Convolutional filters can be visualized by forward-passing multiple sequences through the network and extracting the most-activating subsequences (Alipanahi et al., 2015) to create a position-weighted matrix (PWM) which can be visualized as a sequence logo (Schneider & Stephens, 1990; Crooks et al., 2004) . Direct optimization of input sequences is problematic, as it results in generating a dense matrix even though the input sequences are one-hot encoded (Lanchantin et al., 2016; . This problem can be alleviated with Integrated Gradients (Sundararajan et al., 2016; Jha et al., 2019) or DeepLIFT, which propagates activation differences relative to a selected reference back to the input, reducing the computational overhead of obtaining accurate gradients (Shrikumar et al., 2019a) . If a reference of all-zeros is used, the method is analogous to Layer-wise Relevance Propagation (Bach et al., 2015) . DeepLIFT is an additive feature attribution method, and may used to approximate Shapley values if the input features are independent (Lundberg & Lee, 2017) .

We show that defining the negative (nonhuman) class is non-trivial and compare different ways of constructing the training set. Strikingly, a model trained to distinguish between viruses infecting humans and viruses infecting other chordates (a phylum of animals including vertebrates) generalizes well to evolutionarily distant nonhuman hosts, including even bacteria. This suggests that the host-related signal is strong and the learned decision boundary separates human viruses from other DNA sequences surprisingly well.",

We show that those maps can be used to visualize and detect virulence-related regions of interest (e.g. genes) in novel genomes.

(Mihara et al., 2016) on July 31, 2019 and downloaded all the available data. The original dataset contained 14,380 records comprising Ref-Seq IDs for viral sequences and associated metadata. Some viruses are divided into discontiguous segments, which are represented as separate records in VHDB; in those cases the segments were treated as contigs of a single genome in further analysis. We removed records with unspecified host information and those confusing the highly pathogenic Variola virus with a similarly named genus of fish. Further, we filtered out viroids and satellites. Human-infecting viruses were extracted by searching for records containing \"Homo sapiens\" in the \"host name\" field. Note that VHDB contains information about multiple possible hosts for a given virus where appropriate. Any virus infecting humans was assigned to the positive class, also if other, non-human hosts exist. In total, the dataset contained 9,496 viruses, including 1,309 human viruses.

The broadest definition takes all non-human viruses into account, including bacteriophages (bacterial viruses). This is especially important, as most of known bacteriophages are DNA viruses, while many important human (and animal) viruses are RNA viruses. One could expect that the multitude of available bacteriophage genomes dominating the negative class could lower the prediction performance on viruses similar to those infecting humans. This offers an open-view approach covering a wider part of the sequence space, but may lead to misclassification of potentially dangerous mammalian or avian viruses. As they are often involved in clinically relevant host-switching events, a stricter approach must also be considered. In this case, the negative class comprises only viruses infecting Chordata (a group containing vertebrates and closely related taxa). Two intermediate approaches consider all eukaryotic viruses (including plant and fungi viruses), or only animal-infecting viruses. This amounts to four nested host sets: \"All\" (8,187 non-human viruses), \"Eukaryota\" (5,114 viruses), \"Metazoa\" (2,942 viruses) and \"Chordata\" (2,078 viruses). Auxiliary sets containing only non-eukaryotic viruses (\"non-Eukaryota\"), non-animal eukaryotic viruses (\"non-Metazoa Eukaryota\") etc. can be easily constructed by set subtraction.",

We use dropout regularization in both cases, together with aggressive input dropout at the rate of 0.25 and 0.2 for the CNN and the LSTM, respectively. Input dropout may be interpreted as a special case of noise injection, where a fraction of input nucleotides is turned to N s. Representations of forward and reverse-complement strands are summed before the fully connected layers. As two mates in a read pair should originate from the same virus, predictions obtained for them can be averaged for a boost in performance. If a contig or genome is available, averaging predictions for constituting reads yields a prediction for the whole sequence. Furthermore, averaging the outputs of selected networks may reduce variance while keeping the bias term unaffected (Naftaly et al., 1997) .

This holds also for novel viruses not present in the training set. In the paired read scenario, the previously described method fails, and standard, alignment-based homology testing algorithm cannot find any matches in more than 10% of the cases, resulting in relatively low accuracy. On a real human virome sample, where a main source of negative class reads is most likely contamination (Moustafa et al., 2017) , our method filters out non-human viruses with high specificity. In this scenario, the BLAST-derived groundtruth labels were mined using the complete database (as opposed to just a training set). In all cases, our results are only as good as the training data used; high quality labels and sequences are needed to develop trustworthy models. Ideally, sources of error should be investigated with an in-depth analysis of a model's performance on multiple genomes covering a wide selection of taxonomic units. This is especially important as the method assumes no mechanistic link between an input sequence and the phenotype of interest, and the input sequence constitutes only a small fraction of the target genome without a wider biological context. Still, it is possible to predict a label even from those small, local fragments. A similar effect was also observed for image classification with CNNs (Brendel & Bethge, 2019) .",

In our case, as the filters were weight-normalized, the counter-contributions suggest that the information content and the contribution of a nucleotide are not necessarily correlated. Visualizing learned motifs by aligning the activating sequences (Alipanahi et al., 2015) would not fully describe how the filter reacts to presented data. It seems that the assumption of nucleotide independence -which is crucial for treating DeepLIFT as a method of estimating Shapley values for input nucleotides -is broken. Indeed, k-mer distribution profiles are frequently used features for modelling DNA sequences (as shown also by the dimershuffling method of generating reference sequences proposed by Shrikumar et al. (2019a) ). However, DeepLIFT's multiple successful applications in genomics indicate that the assumption probably holds approximately. We see information content and DeepLIFT's contribution values as two complementary channels that can be jointly visualized for better interpretability and explainability of CNNs in genomics.",

On the other hand, once a trusted model is developed, it can be used on newly emerging pathogens, as the 2019-nCoV virus briefly analyzed in this work. The methods presented here may also be applied to other biological problems outside of the field of pathogen genomics.
