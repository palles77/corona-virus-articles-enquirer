However, Rayner et al 2~ found that H i,.fluenzae was isolated more frequently in the lower respiratory tract of CF patients than in that of asthmatics. The investigators also found that an increase in the isolation ofH influenzae preceded exacerbations, and that colonization was reduced after antibiotic therapy. Isolation rates vary and tend to be related to culturing techniques. Previous studies detected biotype 1 most frequently, ~1 although other studies have questioned this result.2~ As with the S aureus, primary viral infection may precede colonization byHinjlu~ae. Hinfluenzae may infect the upper respiratory tract before the lower tract, and H b~uenzae enflotoxin may cause tissue injury and inflammatory reactions that predispose to Pseudomonas colonization. P acavginosa in previously undiagnosed patients should lead the physician to suspect the diagnosis of CF. 2s Colonization with S aureus and H i~ue*a.ae predisposes to colonization by rnucoid strains ofP aeruginosa not found in nature or in patients with other pulmonary diseasesY Eighty percent of CF patients older than age 26 years are colonized chronically with mucoid P aeruginosa. 13 The mucoid phenotype of Paeruginosa is due to the exopolysacchm-ide alginate. Alginate protects the organism from host defenses by preventing antibody coating and phagoc~osis. 242s Alginate also may maintain colony formation in the airway, e6 May et a127 have characterized the regulatory mechanisms governing alginate biosynthesis, and have identified factors in the CF lung that may participate in the transition from nonmucoid to mucoidPaeruginosa. Other factors also contribute to the virulence ofP aeruginosa. P aeruginosa adheres to respiratory, epithelium and to mucln in the respiratory tract. 28 P aeruginosa produces exoproducts and proteases, which produce an inflammatory response causing destruction of the ah~vays and decline in pulmonary function. Many strains are nontypeable secondary to a deficiency in lipopolysaccfiaride (LPS) sidechains, although the pathogenic significance of this finding is not clear. 29 Cystic fibrosis patients with 1 ) aeruginosa have elevated levels of antibodies directed against ,o aeruginos~ antigens; however, the antibodies do not protect against pulmonary infectionJ ~ Meconium ileus is an important predictor of early-colonization with P aeruginosa, sl There is, however, no correlation between genoWpe in CF and 19 aeruginosa colonization. Early acquisition may be due to more severe disease, earlier hospital stays, early antibiotic use, or cross-nifectionfl Antibiotic therapy does not eliminate the mucoid strains? 2 Winnie and Cowan 3s correlated m~ increased anti-P aeruginosa titer with decreased pulmonary-function tests. Impaired mucoclliary clearance due to chronic inflammation and ail~vay obstruction contributes to the inability to clear P aeruginosa; 28 however, disseminated P aeruginosa infections are rare. Several approaches to prevent chronic P aeruginosa colonization are being investigated.

An exacerbation usually is characterized by several of the following findings: (1) increase in productive cough; (2) change in the volume and character of sputum; (3) dyspnea; (4) reduced exercise ability; (5) decreased activity or lack of energy-; (6) increased respiratory rate; (7) new chest auscultative findings; (8) new infiltrates on chest radiograph; (9) deterioration in pulmonary, function tests or oxygen saturation; and (10) decreased appetite or weight loss. a5 Although there is not a universally accepted definition of an exacerbation, most CF clinicians would begin antibiotic therapy, aggressive chest physiotherapy, nutritional support and, in selected patients, bronchodilators if five or more of the above findings were present. For the clinician to select appropriate antimicrobial therapy, all of the significant lower respiratory tract organisms must be identified and their sensitivity patterns determined. In young CF patients, adequate lower tract sampling is difficult, and most clinicians rely on throat swabs to detect pathogens. The throat swab is performed by placing the swab against the phalTr~x to collect secretions. Coughing may occur, resuhing in lung secretions being coughed onto the swab. Therefore, the throat swab may contain only oropharyngeal flora, or if cough occurs, a lower airway specimen may be collected. Ramsey et al86 evaluated the predictive value of oropha~lgeal cultures for identifying lower airway bacterial colonization by simultaneously performing oropharyngeal cultures and bronchoseopy. The positive predictive value of a positive oropharyngeal culture in patients who could not cough and expectorate sputum was 83% for P aeruginosa and 91% for S aureus. Unfortunately, the sensitMty of the upper airway cuhure was only 46% forPaeruginosa and 77% for S au~rus. Therefore, oropharyngeal cultures ~ielding .P aeruginosa or S aureus are higialy predictive of lower allvcay colonization, but a negative culture does not rule out the presence of these organisms.
