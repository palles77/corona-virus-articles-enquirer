COVID-19 is a respiratory infection with common signs that include respiratory symptoms, fever, cough, shortness of breath, and breathing difficulties. In more severe cases, infection can cause pneumonia, severe acute respiratory syndrome, kidney failure, and death. It has infected more than 400 thousand people all around the world till the end of the day on 24 th March 2020. The risk of severe complications from COVID-19 is higher for certain vulnerable populations, particularly people who are elderly, frail, or have multiple chronic conditions. Although the situation is worse in European and American region after it got stabilized in China, the conditions in South Asia are deteriorating fast.",

Uncontrolled pandemic in India can lead to the impact of almost 1/6 th population of the world. India holds a significant value on the world map with respect to trade, economy, defense, culture, entertainment, outsourcing workforce, manufacturing and services. Indians are present in almost all the regions of the world and are working towards strengthening the work processes and economies of the world. It is imperative that the trends and forecasts for Indian region must be studied well so that effective strategies can be drawn for the region. Since the mechanisms of COVID-19 spreading are not completely understood, the number of infected people is large and the effects of containment are evaluated essentially on an empirical basis. Therefore, a more quantitative analysis of the epidemic spreading can be interesting.",

For Indian region, the studies are very less till now and some notable work has been done by people from ICMR [18] and other researchers [19] [20] [21] . Except from the mathematical modelling presented by the practitioners from Indian Council of Medical Research, there are no prediction and forecasting models available in the Indian context. From analysis point of view, a lot of studies have been conducted using time series forecasting models like ARIMA [22] [23] [24] and Exponential smoothing [25] [26] [27] . These are standard techniques which gives a decent predictions and forecasts on time series data in quick time. These techniques have been selected based on their wide acceptance in the research community and quick implementation for the various stakeholders to act.",

ARIMA (Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average) models [29] are, in theory, the most general class of models for forecasting a time series which can be made to be \"stationary\" by differencing (if necessary), perhaps in conjunction with nonlinear transformations such as logging or deflating (if necessary). A random variable that is a time series is stationary if its statistical properties are all constant over time. A stationary series has no trend, its variations around its mean have constant amplitude, and it wiggles in a consistent fashion, i.e., its short-term random time patterns always look the same in a statistical sense. A non-seasonal ARIMA model is classified as an ARIMA(p, d, q) model, where p is the number of autoregressive terms, d is the number of non-seasonal differences needed for stationarity, and q is the number of lagged forecast errors in the prediction equation. The forecasting equation is constructed as shown in eq. 1. \u0177 t = \u03bc + \u03d5 1 y t-1 +\u2026+ \u03d5 p y t-p -\u03b8 1 e t-1 -\u2026-\u03b8 q e t-q",

In the current case, there is a clear upward trend in the number of infected cases from COVID-19 in India but seasonality is yet not a concern as the data is limited to a few days only. So this technique should work well for the current series. In the Holt's LES, if the estimated level and trend at time t-1 are L t-1 and T t-1 , respectively, then the forecast for Y t that would have been made at time t-1 is equal to L t-1 + T t-1 . When the actual value is observed, the updated estimate of the level is computed recursively by interpolating between Y t and its forecast, L t-1 + T t-1 , using weights of \u03b1 and 1-\u03b1 as shown in equation 3.",

For long-term forecast, forecasting with Holt's method will increase or decrease indefinitely into the future. In this case, we use the Damped trend method which has a damping parameter 0< \u03d5 <1 to prevent the forecast \"go wild\". We implemented three variants of Holt's method. In fit 1, we explicitly provide the model with the smoothing parameter \u03b1=0.8, \u03b2=0.2. In fit 2, we used an exponential model rather than a Holt's additive model (which is default). In fit 3, we used a damped version of the Holt's additive model but allowed the dampening parameter \u03d5 to be optimized while fixing the values for \u03b1=0.8, \u03b2=0.2. The values of \u03b1 & \u03b2 were set as per the trends seen in the original dataset. These values were obtained after iteratively developing the model.",

Going by the trend, it can be seen that since registering the first case of COVID-19, it took 41 days in India to reach 50 infected patients and the average case per day is 9.75 since the reporting of first case. This is a normal trend but then it took a steep movement upwards where India went from 51 to 100 cases in next 5 days, followed by 1011-150 patients in another 5 days. The number of days went down to 3, 2 and 1 for the next 50 patients each from 151 to 300. After that it's a matter of 1 or 2 days to regularly report 50 patients infected from COVID-19. There have been some milestones on finding the average case per day. Since reporting the first case till 24 th March 2020, the average case per day comes out to be 9.75 as in the initial days there were hardly any patients diagnosed with the virus. But this average kept on increasing with every case. Since reporting the 20 th case, average went to 25.29 cases per day, since 50 th case it was 32.87, since 100 th case it was 41.27, since 150 th case it was 41.27, since 200 th case it was 68.4, and since 250 th and 300 th case it was 73, respectively. There was a slight downfall after that as a complete one day lockdown was announced by the Government of India. This average came down to 70 which is almost constant for last 100 cases.",

On the average growth rate predictions, the cases may rise up to 7000 in next 30 days as compared to the current numbers of 536. Considering the mortality rate to be varying between 2-3% based on the early trends, the number of deaths is predicted to be in the range of 15,000-20,000 in pessimistic scenario. The accuracy of the model was found to be around 70% as the data points are less.",

Of course, the interventions are going on and a lot of people are recovering around the world and in India. However, the Holt's Linear Trend is a realistic estimate of the situation in the current scenario and going by the forecasts, we may see around 3 million infected cases in India in the next 30 days or so. To control the wild predictions, Additive dampening method was also used to predict the forecast and this model depicted that with proper interventions and control, the figures may not reach beyond 8000-9000 infected cases.",

This should have a huge impact on the flattening the curve rather than making it grow exponentially.
