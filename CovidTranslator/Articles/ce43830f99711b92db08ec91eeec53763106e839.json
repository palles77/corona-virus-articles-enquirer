Decisions about the initiation and timing of invasive ventilation can be difficult, and early discussion with critical care colleagues is essential. Appropriateness of invasive ventilatory support can also require advanced discussion with patients and families. In the past 10e15 years, the role of noninvasive ventilation (NIV) has expanded, not least in an attempt to minimize the complications inherent in invasive ventilation. Indeed, NIV is now considered first-line therapy in some conditions (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, pulmonary oedema, mild to moderate hypoxaemic respiratory failure in immunocompromised patients), and a 'trial of NIV' is often considered in respiratory failure resulting from an increasingly wide range of causes. With NIV, the importance of the environment (setting, monitoring, experience of staff) and forward planning cannot be overemphasized. When used for other than the standard indications, NIV should be employed in a high-dependency or intensive care setting in patients for whom invasive ventilation would be considered.",

Target e the gas delivered to the lung is set to a specific limit of target flow rate (volume control) or pressure (pressure control, pressure support, bi-level).

NIV can be delivered using most modern 'intensive care' ventilators. For sicker patients, this has advantages (the ability to deliver higher and precise concentrations of oxygen; separate inspiratory and expiratory limbs minimizing the rebreathing of carbon dioxide; better monitoring and alarm features; rapid access to invasive ventilation). Outside the intensive care unit (ICU), NIV is commonly applied using smaller, portable and 'simpler' but increasingly sophisticated 'non-invasive' ventilators, which provide a range of respiratory support modes. Pressure-cycled modes are generally preferred (as they can accommodate leaks), and breaths can be either patienttriggered (pressure support or bi-level positive airway pressure), or initiated and controlled by the ventilator (pressure control). The two modes are often used synergistically to provide back-up when triggering is poor, the patient's respiratory rate is unreliable or potential apnoeic episodes need to be covered.",

These benefits have been shown predominantly in patients with mild to moderate hypercapnic respiratory failure (pH 7.30 e7.34). NIV should therefore be considered first-line therapy for this group and can be safely used in appropriately staffed and monitored environments outside ICU. However, the use of NIV in patients with more severe respiratory failure 1 can still be compatible with favourable outcomes.

As such, the routine use of NIV in severe pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is not recommended outside critical care facilities. Although early studies have shown early NIV initiation to be beneficial in the management of hypoxic respiratory failure in immunocompromised patients, this has not been borne out in a recent large multicentre study (IVNIctus 4 ).

Both anaesthetic induction agents and positive-pressure ventilation (which decreases venous return) produce cardiovascular depression, and peri-intubation hypotension is common.

Simpler forms of extracorporeal support exist for when hypercapnia is the predominant problem. Studies are ongoing to establish whether such therapies have a role in further mitigating the injurious effects of invasive ventilation in patients with ARDS, avoiding invasive ventilation in patients with COPD failing NIV and weaning patients from longer term mechanical ventilation.
