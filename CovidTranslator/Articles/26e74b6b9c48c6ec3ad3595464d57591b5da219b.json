The aim of this study was to investigate the expression of different cell surface molecules on human retinal pigment epithelial cells (RPEC) following viral infection, with special emphasis on those having immuneregulatory functions. \u2022 Methods: Cultured RPEC were infected with cytomegalovirus (CMV), coxsackievirus B3 (CVB) or herpes simplex virus type I (HSV). Double-staining fluorescence technique was used for visualization of virus infection and cell surface markers in the same cells by laser microscopy. \u2022 Results: CMV downregulated MHC class I antigens on RPEC, whereas CVB and HSV did not alter MHC class I antigen expression. No induction of class II antigens was observed in RPEC infected with CVB, HSV or CMV. The intercellular adhesion molecule ICAM-1 (CD54) was strongly expressed in uninfected RPEC, and a slight increase was observed after virus infection. Vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 (VCAM-1) was expressed in low amounts in both uninfected and infected RPEC. No expression of intercellular adhesion molecule 2 (ICAM-2), E-selectin ELAM-1 or lymphocyte-function-associated antigen 1 (LFA-1) was observed on RPEC before or after virus infection. \u2022 Conclusion: Downmodulation of immune-regulating cell surface antigens has been suggested to provide a means of long-term sur-",

ICAM-1 was initially identified as a widely distributed cytokine-counterreceptor for the lymphocyte-function-associated antigen 1 (LFA-1). The highest levels of ICAM-1 antigen are found on activated endothelium, with lower levels that increase in inflammation on multiple other cell types. High levels of ICAM-2 antigens are found on endothelium and lower levels on hemopoietic cells, including platelets, and on thymic stroma cells. Unlike ICAM-1, ICAM-2 is constitutively expressed and not responsive to lipopolysaccharides or cytokines. VCAM-1 was shown to be expressed by dendritic cells and crypt epithelium (basal part). The E-selectin ELAM-1 (=CD62E) was first identified as a cytokine-inducible surface antigen on endothelial cells. Expression of ELAM-1 has been clearly documented on acutely activated endothelium, where it participates in the recruitment of leukocytes at sites of acute inflammation. This adhesion molecule has also been identified in chronic inflammatory lesions of the skin and synovium. LFA-1 is the receptor for three members of the Ig supergene family of proteins ICAM-1, ICAM-2 and ICAM-3 (=CD50). LFA-1 has been shown to play a central role in homotypic and heterotypic cellular adhesion in immune and inflammatory responses and is expressed on lymphocytes, monocytes, and, more weakly, on neutrophils. LFA-1 is a heterodimer consisting of two subunits, alpha (CDlla) and beta (CD18). For further details see reference [31] . We did not expect the latter antigen to be expressed on human cultured RPEC but used the antibody as control to exclude contamination of the cultures.",

Extensive washings with PBS were necessary to prevent background staining. Cell layers were not allowed to dry out. Cells were finally embedded in Moviol (Hoechst, Germany) to reduce fading during observation and examined in a laser scanning microscope (LSM10, Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany). For FITC a 488-nm argon laser was used for excitation and a BP 530/30 filter for emission. For TRITC a 514-nm argon laser was used for excitation and a BP 575-640 filter for emission.

            "text": "Retinal pigment epithelium is susceptible to growth of various viruses, but infection of the retina does not necessarily lead to severe destruction, as observed with HSV infection, one of the best-studied viruses in ocular disease [36] . As shown in animal experiments, mouse hepatitis virus is able to cause only mild inflammatory response but longlasting disease [23, 24] . Viruses are known to be able to alter \"self\", thereby inducing an autoimmune response, and presumably a similar mechanism could also play a role in affecting the pigmented layer in humans. Autoimmunity to retinal antigens has been implicated in the pathogenesis of endogenous posterior uveitis and retinitis pigmentosa. Reid et al. [22] found that EBV-transformed human lymphocytes from patients with retinitis pigmentosa secreted higher levels of antiretinal antibodies than those from uveitis patients and normal controls, although all groups had low serum titers of antibodies. Albeit in the absence of cytopathic effects, persistent viral infection of retinal tissue has been described as leading to cellular dysfunctions [34] . CMV infection leads to downregulation of MHC class I in human fibroblasts and, as observed, in our experimental design. This seems to favor virus escape from the immune response [12, 20] and might support virus persistence in vivo. Also, other viruses such as HIV or adenoviruses which are able to induce persistent infections choose this type of strategy [19, 25, 26] . MHC class II was not upregulated on cultured human bulbus-derived RPEC as a direct consequence of virus infection in vitro, not ruling out the possibility that this could occur in vivo due to local production of IFN-y by CMV-specific T-cells.",

Adherence molecules regulating interactions of immune effector cells are known to be involved in retinal inflammation [14, 15] . An important member of this class is ICAM-1, which has been shown to mediate lymphocyte binding to RPEC [17] . Basal expression of ICAM-1 on non-hematopoietic cells is usually rather low, but it can be induced by cytokines such as IFN-y, tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-c0 and interleukin-lbeta (IL-I[3). ICAM-1 is also constitutively expressed on unstimulated RPEC and can be induced in vivo by various cytokines, most importantly IFN-y [2] . This mechanism might regulate leukocyte infiltration and might be important for the local immune response of the eye [review 4]. Lymphocyte binding to RPEC is normally ICAM-l-dependent, but ICAM-l-independent mechanisms have also been found on stimulated RPEC [17] , suggesting the involvement of further cell surface molecules. Other investigators showed that HSV-1 induced an increase in ELAM-1, ICAM-1 and VCAM-1, whereas coxsackievirus induced an increase in ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 in endothelial cells. Cytokines such as TNF-c~, IL-1, IL-4 and IL-6 were shown to effect the expression of adhesion molecules. TNF-c~ also upregulated VCAM-1 and ELAM-1 [31] . However, the adhesion molecules ELAM-1 and ICAM-2 were not found on RPEC, and no induction due to viral infection was observed.",

For detection of CMV infection a cocktail of monoclohal antibodies (mAb) was used consisting of an mAb directed to immediate early antigen (IEA, clone E-13, Clonatec, Biosoft, Paris, France), early antigen (EA, DuPont, Vienna, Austria) and pp65 (Clonab-CMV, Biotest, Dreieich, Germany). HSV infection was detected with mAb anti-HSV1/2 (CHA 437, Clonatec, Biosoft). Coxsackievirus infection was detected with a high-titer positive patient serum. As second antibodies we used a FITC-conjugated antimouse F(ab)2 fraction of goat immunoglobulin (Bioresearch, Kaumberg, Austria) or a TRITC-conjugated rabbit anti-mouse IgG and a FITC-conjugated rabbit anti-human IgG or a TRITC-conjugated rabbit anti-human IgG (all from Dakopatts, Glostrup, Denmark), respectively.AntibodiesThe following antibodies were used:Anti-MHC-class I (clone W6/32, IgG2a, dilution 1:40), anti-HLA class-II (clone DK22, IgG2a, dilution 1:40), anti-MHC-class II, alpha-chain (clone TAL.1B5, IgG1, dilution 1:40) (all from Dakopatts); anti-ICAM-1 (CD54, clone RR1/1, IgG1, dilution 1:50), anti-ICAM-2 (clone CBR-IC2/2, IgG2a, dilution 1:50), anti-LFA-1g (CD18, clone R3.3, IgG1, dilution 1:50, (all from Bender MedSystems, Vienna, Austria); anti-ELAM-1 (alpha E-selectin, clone BBIG-E6, IgG1, dilution 1:50, British Biotechnology, Abingdon, UK); anti-VCAM-t (clone El/6, IgGl, dilution 1:50, 5th Leucocyte Typing Workshop, Boston, 1993).",
