This study investigated the effect of licorice on arsenite (As)-induced cytotoxicity in H4IIE cells, a rat hepatocyte-derived cell line. Cell viability was significantly diminished in As-treated H4IIE cells in a time and concentration-dependent manner. Furthermore, results from flow cytometric assay and DNA laddering in H4IIE cells showed that As treatment induced apoptotic cell death by activating caspase-3. Licorice (0.1 and 1.0 mg ml \u00c01 ) treatment significantly inhibited cell death and the activity of caspase-3 in response to As exposure. These results demonstrate that licorice induced a cytoprotective effect against As-induced cell death by inhibition of caspase-3.",

(21) reported that sodium arsenite (NaAsO 2 , As) triggered the production of H 2 O 2 and induced apoptosis via the activation of caspase-3, which is dependent on the production of H 2 O 2 in preosteoclastic cells. Arsenic trioxide (As 2 O 3 ) has also been shown to induce apoptosis in other types of cells (22, 23) . Activation of caspase-3 is a critical step in apoptosis and caspase-3 is believed to be involved in the mediation of As-induced cell death. However, there are few studies that evaluate the effects of useful herbal medicines against As-induced toxicity. The purpose of this research was to investigate whether licorice could prevent As-induced apoptotic cell death via caspase-3.",

In the United States and European countries, G. radix products are currently used as flavoring or sweetening agents for tobaccos, chewing gums, candies or beverages and are consumed in large quantities at approximately 1.5 kg per person per year (1).

We also reported that licorice and liquiritigenin prevented Cd-induced apoptosis, and Cd-induced non-apoptotic cell death, irrespective of sulfhydryl deficiency, whereas liquiritin, isoliquiritigenin or glycyrrhizin did not prevent Cd-induced cell death (3, 27) .",

In As-induced apoptosis, involvement of caspase-3 activation has been well known in both in vivo and in vitro experimental systems (32, 33) . In this study, we found that the cytoprotective effect of licorice against As-induced cell death was mediated by the inhibition of apoptisis. Licorice inhibited caspase-3 activation (Fig. 6 ) and reduced the population of apoptotic cells (Fig. 4) in a dose dependent manner. In Fig. 6 , caspase-3 activation was inhibited by both 0.1 and 1.0 mg ml \u00c01 of licorice to a similar extent. However, the net cell viability by 1.0 mg ml \u00c01 of licorice was much higher than that by 0.1 mg ml \u00c01 of licorice (Fig. 3) indicating the role of caspase-independent apoptotic pathways in this cell line. Apoptosis inducing factor (AIF) and endonuclease G (EndoG) are apoptogenic factors that mediate caspase-independent cell death (34, 35) . Omi/HtrA2 also induces caspase-independent apoptosis by inhibiting IAPs (inhibitors of apoptosis) for activating caspase-9 and -3 (35) . To confirm apoptosis through the caspase-independent pathways including EndoG-induced DNA degradation, further studies are needed. In summary, we demonstrated that licorice blocked As-induced cell death by inhibiting the apoptotic process, and suggested that licorice is a potent preventer of As-induced cytotoxicity.",
