The K418 reached 10 6 TCID 50 /ml of viral titer with similar growth kinetics to those of parental strains and had a cross-reactive neutralizing antibody response to field serum from the entire country. The chimeric clone pK418 can be used as a practical tool for further studying the molecular characteristics of PRRSV proteins through genetic manipulation. Furthermore, successful construction of the K418 will allow for the development of customized vaccine candidates against PRRSV, which has evolved rapidly in Korea.",

            "text": "Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV), which causes a reproductive and respiratory disease in pigs, contains a positive-sense single-strand RNA genome measuring approximately 15.4 kb. The virus is classified into two genotypes, a North American (NA) type and a European (EU) type. The genome of PRRSV contains nine open reading frames (ORFs). ORF1a and ORF1b occupy approximately 80% of the viral genome and encode nonstructural proteins (NSPs) (Meulenberg et al., 1993) . The remaining ORFs encode glycosylated structure proteins, including the glycoprotein (GP)2, GP3, GP4, and GP5, unglycosylated membrane (M) protein and nucleocapsid (N) protein (Meulenberg, 2000) . Previous studies indicated that B-cell epitopes for viral neutralization appeared to reside on structure proteins, including GP3, GP4, GP5, and M (van Nieuwstadt et al., 1996; Yang et al., 2000; Cancel-Tirado et al., 2004; Ansari et al., 2006; Plagemann, 2006) . PRRS is characterized by reproductive failure, including aborted, stillborn, mummified and weak-born piglets, and respiratory disorder, which can result in high death rates in suckling and weaned pigs. PRRS is responsible for significant economic losses for the swine industry worldwide (Neumann et al., 2005) . Control methods including management of incoming replacement gilts, implementation of biosecurity protocols and vaccination have been applied to reduce the risk of PRRSV outbreak. Among them, vaccination has been considered as the most effective tool for preventing the disease (Thanawongnuwech and Suradhat, 2010) . However, current commercial PRRSV vaccines have the drawback of featuring a high level of antigenic variation between the vaccine and field strains of PRRSV (Meng, 2000) . Heterologous strains of PRRSV compared to a vaccine strain possessing antigenic diversity resulting from amino acid sequence variation in GP5 have been constantly isolated and reported from Korea (Cha et al., 2006; Yoon et al., 2008; Kim et al., 2012; Choi et al., 2013) . Generally, field strains, which are the most frequently isolated from regional areas, have been used to develop vaccines in each country that has had an endemic PRRSV outbreak.",

            "text": "Reverse genetics (RG) technology is a practical system to study virus characteristics, in vivo pathogenesis and viral protein function. The manipulation of viral RNA genomes is generally difficult due to the instability of RNA genomes and the lack of research tools for direct RNA editing. However, with RG technology, the modification of infectious RNA viruses can be easily achieved. In previous studies, RG technology has been applied to the genetic modification of genomes of positive-sense and negative-sense RNA viruses and to rescue mutant viruses from cDNA infectious clones (Taniguchi et al., 1978; Racaniello and Baltimore, 1981; Castrucci and Kawaoka, 1995) . RG technology has widespread implications in the fields of virology and vaccinology (Ito et al., 2001; Collins and Murphy, 2005; Almazan et al., 2013) . Using RG technology, a highly pathogenic strain of a virus can be attenuated by the construction of a chimeric virus with highly and weakly pathogenic viruses. In addition, a chimera virus can serve as a viral vector expressing heterologous antigen. The infectious clone of PRRSV has been developed and used in previous studies (Nielsen et al., 2003; Truong et al., 2004; Yoo et al., 2004; Lee et al., 2005; Fang et al., 2006) . In previous studies, diverse chimera viruses of PRRSV have been generated using RG technology to manipulate viral genomes to determine the viral protein involved in the pathogenicity of field strains in pigs (Kwon et al., 2006; Zhou et al., 2012; Ni et al., 2013) . However, RG technology has been used mainly to characterize the function of viral proteins but has not been used to develop recombinant vaccine candidates against PRRSV. In this study, a chimeric virus was constructed using an infectious clone of PRRSV containing genomes of the FL12 strain and a Korean dominant field strain, LMY. The chimeric virus, named K418, contains NSPs from the FL12 strain and structure proteins from the LMY strain.",

The neutralizing antibody titers of cross-reactive group were greater than 1:8, the titers of partially cross-reactive group were 1:8 and the titers of resistant group were less than 1:8. The crossreactive samples against K418 virus, including partially crossreactive ones, accounted for 27.06% whereas cross-reactive samples against MLV which widely used commercial live vaccine accounted for 5.88% of the total field samples ( Table 1) . (Cha et al., 2006; Yoon et al., 2008; Kim et al., 2012; Choi et al., 2013) . Furthermore, sequence diversity on the ORF5 decreased serological cross-reactivity between PRRSV strains belonging to the same genotype (Kim et al., 2013) . The MLV containing a representative attenuated strain of NA type virus is the most commonly used PRRSV vaccine worldwide in field. The MLV virus was frequently isolated from vaccinated pigs in fields. However, only 5.88% of the total PRRSV ELISA positive serum samples neutralized MLV, while 27.06% of PRRSV ELISA positive serum samples neutralized the chimeric virus, K418. The serological cross-reactivity against the K418 virus suggests that the humoral immune response induced by the chimeric virus would cross-react with approximately half percentage of the NA field strain of PRRSV in Korea. The polyclonal antiserum against the K418 neutralized the LMY strain, but not the FL12 and MLV strain of PRRSV (Lee et al., manuscript in preparation) . These results supported that the chimeric virus would be more effective as a potential regional vaccine candidate to protect pigs than the MLV vaccine.",
