Even less is known about the best way to respond to an inevitable influenza pandemic. This article features a discussion about how an influenza pandemic will differ from an annual influenza epidemic and how this difference will affect the public health response.",

Influenza epidemics are events that occur yearly (or every few years) and are caused by a phenomenon known as antigenic drift. Antigenic drift refers to a minor change that occurs within the influenza virus (at the hemagglutinin or neuraminidase site). 3 The resultant strain of influenza is different enough that a new vaccine must be developed to prevent people from getting sick. However, it is not so different that mortality or morbidity rates within a population change very much. Each year in the United States, approximately 36,000 people die from influenzarelated illness. Mortality, very predictably, occurs among the very old and very young. 4 In general, epidemic influenza strains are characterized early enough to develop adequate vaccine stocks to protect the population during the flu season. 5 World Health Organization (WHO) collaborating influenza centers around the world detect new variants, and each year 2 influenza type-A strains and one influenza type-B strain are chosen for a trivalent vaccine. 5 It is very important to distinguish an influenza pandemic from an influenza epidemic, because preparations and responses to each differ significantly.",

Although vaccination still is considered ''the primary strategy to reduce the impact of a pandemic,'' DHHS acknowledges that early in a pandemic, vaccine will not be available. DHHS suggests that only by improving worldwide surveillance can we hope to identify new influenza strains early enough to produce a vaccine. H5N1 avian influenza provides a good example. The virus was first identified in 1997 in Hong Kong, 8, 9 and it has been monitored in animals and humans since that time. 10, 11, 12, 17 An H5N1 vaccine already has been developed for chickens, 24 and, recently, work has begun in earnest on developing a human H5N1 vaccine. 25 If H5N1 does cause the next pandemic, this advanced surveillance might save many lives and prevent dissemination of the virus.",

This scenario occurred dramatically in the 1976 swine flu outbreak. 26 In January 1976, an outbreak of influenza at Fort Dix, New Jersey, left 1 soldier dead, 4 ill, and 500 exposed. The influenza virus in the dead soldier was identified as H1N1, an antigenic shift from the H3N2 virus that had been circulating worldwide at that time. After confirming that person-to-person spread was probably occurring and surmising that a pandemic was imminent, a panel of experts from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), The Food and Drug Administration, and The National Institutes of Health recommended mass vaccination. 26 Between October 1 and December 16, 1976 , 45 million people in the United States were vaccinated against swine flu. As it turned out, a pandemic did not occur, and 532 people who received the influenza vaccine developed Guillain-Barre syndrome, a neurologic disease that causes paralysis. 26 In retrospect, the fact that no other cases of swine flu occurred after the 5 cases at Fort Dix and the absence of cases in the southern hemisphere, where epidemics usually start, should have halted the vaccination campaign before it started.",

Without a vaccine, and with imperfect protection afforded by sound infection control practices, the role of antiviral agents becomes paramount. The WHO has suggested that, in the absence of vaccine, advanced stockpiling of antiviral drugs may be an alternative tool to manage an influenza pandemic. 7 Unfortunately, future pandemic influenza strains are likely to be resistant to the cheaper adamantanes, rimantadine and amantadine, 28 and the use of these drugs in nursing home outbreaks has resulted in rapid development of resistance. 29 The H5N1 avian influenza strain is resistant to the adamantanes. 27 This leaves the neuraminidase inhibitors, oseltamivir and zanamivir, as the antiviral drugs of choice for stockpiling. Zanamivir is not widely available and it must be administered in an aerosolized form. Therefore, according to A. Fauci in the March 3, 2005 issue of The Washington Times, the CDC has begun to stockpile oseltamivir. Oseltamivir is expensive ($35 to $40 per 5day treatment course) (hospital pharmacy data), and it is unlikely that enough medication can be stockpiled to protect all health care workers and patients in a timely fashion. Many hospitals have the resources to stockpile and efficiently disseminate antiviral drugs to health care workers and high-risk groups within the general population (from communications with hospital administrators).",

Recent studies have demonstrated that neuraminidase inhibitors administered as treatment (75 mg twice a day for 5 days) within 48 hours of symptoms not only decrease the duration of illness but also decrease the incidence of hospitalization, antibiotic use, and mortality. 34, 36, 37 Health care workers are a captive group and easily could be monitored for symptoms (eg, fevers and myalgias) of influenza. It seems feasible that such monitoring would identify most of the ill workers and, thus, allow timely administration of antiviral therapy. We estimate that, with excellent infection control practices, we could expect 10% to 15% of our hospital workers to become ill during an influenza pandemic. Thus, at our hospital, we would expect to treat approximately 1000 to 1500 people with a 5-day course of oseltamivir (10 pills). The total cost to stockpile enough Tamiflu for this strategy would be between $40,000 to $60,000 (pharmacy data). Smaller hospitals obviously would spend less.",

The guidelines for antiviral use during epidemics, which relies on identifying high-risk group treatment and prophylaxis, 7 may be useless during a pandemic as the at-risk population increases or changes. 1 If 15% to 30% of the nonimmune population gets infected with pandemic flu, approximately 45 to 90 million doses of oseltamivir will be required in the United States. Both financially and logistically, stockpiling and disseminating this amount of medication is not feasible. Neither the government nor hospitals can afford such a gargantuan expense. An alternative strategy might be to focus treatment and prophylaxis of the general population in the most heavily affected areas in an attempt to slow down transmission until vaccine is available. DHHS suggests that a strategy based on treatment is more cost-effective and efficient than one based on chemoprophylaxis (www.dhhs. gov/nvpo/pandemicplan/annex7.antiviral.pdf). However, treatment must be initiated within 48 hours of symptoms for therapy to be effective. Chemoprophylaxis, according to DHHS, should be used primar-ily to maintain adequate health care and safety services.",

            "text": "Once vaccine is available, limiting transmission will be based on a mass vaccination campaign. In the initial phases of a pandemic, influenza vaccine may not be available, and limiting transmission will be a huge challenge. Containment strategies are limited by influenza's short incubation period (3 days) and the fact that people infected with influenza can spread disease several days before symptoms appear. 4, 7, 21 Thus, as previously described, infection control practices that are effective with other infections, such as SARS, 22 will not work as well with pandemic flu. DHHS recommends that, early in a pandemic, patients should be placed in a negative pressure room (www.dhhs.gov/nvpo/pandemicplan/annex8.stratli mittrans.pdf). As cases mount, patients should be placed in private rooms, and, finally, cohorted on separate wards or in separate buildings. Health care workers caring for influenza patients should use droplet and contact precautions, including wearing a surgical mask, gloves, and gowns, using eye protection, and washing hands. 21 Spread within the community will be more difficult to control than in health care facilities. For community containment, DHHS recommends travel limitations, screening of travelers for febrile or respiratory illness, canceling large group gatherings, closing schools, limiting public transportation, discouraging handshaking, encouraging hand hygiene, teaching respiratory hygiene/cough etiquette, and wearing masks in public (www.dhhs.gov/nvpo/pandemicplan/annex8.stratli mittrans.pdf). Even though large-scale quarantines have not traditionally been effective to limit the spread of influenza, 38 home quarantine (or sheltering in place) might help to slow down a pandemic while vaccine is being developed. There are examples of quarantine/isolation being effective in slowing transmission of the 1918 Spanish flu in more remote populations in Somoa and Alaska (www.dhhs.gov/nvpo/ pandemicplan/annex8.stratlimittrans.pdf). More recently, the quarantine of more than 150,000 people during the 2003 SARS outbreak in Taiwan contributed to shortening the onset-to-diagnosis time compared with those who were not quarantined. 39 Any strategy that involves quarantine or limiting activity will rely heavily on existing public health laws. These laws vary widely from state to state, and many have not been updated in a quarter century or longer. 40 Furthermore, these drastic measures, which are not commonplace, may foment panic and suspicion among an already edgy public.

Created in response to the Nunn-Lugar-Domenici Domestic Preparedness Program by the Department of Defense, MEMS is an attempt to expand the local health care structure in response to a mass casualty event (www.edgewood.army.mil/downloads/ reports/mems_copper_book.pdf). To manage the huge patient burden of a mass casualty event like pandemic influenza, health care delivery will be moved away from hospitals except for the most seriously ill patients. Two patient care modules would be established within communities: The Neighborhood Emergency Help Center (NEHC) would be the primary triage point for symptomatic and asymptomatic exposed patients. From the NEHC, patients could be sent home, to a hospital, or to an Acute Care Center (ACC). ACCs would accommodate patients who require hospitalization but do not need ventilator support or ICU care. The ACC will be near a hospital and will be staffed by physicians and nurses who can provide intravenous fluids, intravenous and oral medications, oxygen, and other supportive care. Also, patients for whom survival is unlikely may be sent to an ACC for comfort care. Area hospitals will only take the sickest patients and all elective procedures will likely cease until the end of the outbreak. NEHCs and ACCs also might serve as distribution/administration points for antiviral medications and/or vaccine in the case of pandemic influenza. Although MEMS is not yet fully functional, states are beginning to implement plans for its creation, and exercises have been organized to test it. It is not yet clear what the trigger will be for activating MEMS, but it is likely to be different in each state/ locality.",
