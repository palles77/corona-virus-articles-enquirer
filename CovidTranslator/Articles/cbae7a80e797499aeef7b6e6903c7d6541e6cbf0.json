            "text": "As a first step toward the development of diagnostic and therapeutic tools to fight the Coronavirus 12 disease , it is important to characterize CD8+ T cell epitopes in the SARS-CoV-2 13 peptidome that can trigger adaptive immune responses. Here, we use RosettaMHC, a comparative 14 modeling approach which leverages existing high-resolution X-ray structures from peptide/MHC 15 complexes available in the Protein Data Bank, to derive physically realistic 3D models for high-16 affinity SARS-CoV-2 epitopes. We outline an application of our method to model 439 9mer and 17 279 10mer predicted epitopes displayed by the common allele HLA-A*02:01, and we make our 18 models publicly available through an online database (https://rosettamhc.chemistry.ucsc.edu). As 19 more detailed studies on antigen-specific T cell recognition become available, RosettaMHC 20 models of antigens from different strains and HLA alleles can be used as a basis to understand the 21 link between peptide/HLA complex structure and surface chemistry with immunogenicity, in the 22 context of SARS-CoV-2 infection. 23 24 An ongoing pandemic caused by the novel SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) has become the 25 focus of extensive efforts to develop vaccines and antiviral therapies (1). Immune modulatory 26 interferons, which promote a widespread antiviral reaction in infected cells, and inhibition of pro-27 inflammatory cytokine function through anti-IL-6/IL-6R antibodies, have been proposed as 28 possible COVID-19 therapies (2, 3). However, stimulating a targeted T cell response against 29 specific viral antigens is hampered by a lack of detailed knowledge of the immunodominant 30 epitopes displayed by common Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA) alleles across individuals 31 (public epitopes). The molecules of the class I major histocompatibility complex (MHC-I, or HLA 32 in humans) display on the cell surface a diverse pool of 8 to 15 amino acid peptides derived from 33 the endogenous processing of proteins expressed inside the cell (4). This MHC-I restriction of 34 peptide antigens provides jawed vertebrates with an essential mechanism for adaptive immunity: 35 surveillance of the displayed peptide/MHC-I (pMHC-I) molecules by CD8+ cytotoxic T-36 lymphocytes allows detection of aberrant protein expression patterns, which signify viral infection 37 and can trigger an adaptive immune response (5). A recent study has shown important changes in 38 T cell compartments during the acute phase of SARS-CoV-2 infection (6), suggesting that the 39 ability to quantify antigen-specific T cells would provide new avenues for understanding the 40 author/funder.

            "text": "groove (termed A-F pockets) define a repertoire of 10 4 -10 6 peptide antigens that can be recognized 48 by each HLA allotype (9, 10). Several machine-learning methods have been developed to predict 49 the likelihood that a target peptide will bind to a given allele (reviewed in (11)). Generally these 50 methods make use of available data sets in the Immune Epitope Database (12) to train artificial 51 neural networks that predict peptide processing, binding and display, and their performance varies 52 depending on peptide length and HLA allele representation in the database. Structure-based 53 approaches have also been proposed to model the bound peptide conformation de novo (reviewed 54 in (13)). These approaches utilize various algorithms to optimize the backbone and side chain 55 degrees of freedom of the peptide/MHC structure according to an all-atom scoring function, 56 derived from physical principles (14-16), that can be further enhanced using modified scoring 57 terms (17) or mean field theory (18). While these methods do not rely on large training data sets, 58 their performance is affected by bottlenecks in sampling of different backbone conformations, and 59 any possible structural adaptations of the HLA peptide-binding groove. 60 Predicting the bound peptide conformation whose N-and C-termini are anchored within a fixed-61 length groove is a tractable modeling problem that can be addressed using standard comparative suggesting that a similar principle can be applied to produce models of candidate epitopes directly 72 from the proteome of a pathogen of interest. Here, we apply RosettaMHC to all HLA-A*02:01 73 epitopes predicted directly from the ~30 kbp SARS-CoV-2 genome, and make our models publicly 74 available through an online database. The computed binding energies of our models can be used 75 as an additional validation layer to select high-affinity epitopes from large peptide sets. As detailed 76 epitope mapping data from high-throughput tetramer staining (23-25) and T cell functional 77 screens (26) become available, the models presented here can provide a toehold for understanding 78 links between pMHC-I antigen structure and immunogenicity, with actionable value for the 79 development of peptide vaccines to combat the disease. 80 author/funder.

In this approach (RosettaMHC), a local optimization of the backbone degrees of 67 freedom is sufficient to capture minor (within 0.5 \u00c5 heavy atom RMSD) changes of the target 68 peptide backbone relative to the conformation of the peptide in the template, used as a starting 69 point.

To identify all possible regular peptide binders to HLA-A*02:01 128 that are expressed by SARS-CoV-2, we used a recently annotated version of all open reading 129 frames (ORFs) in the viral genome from NCBI (32), made available through the UCSC genome 130 browser (33). We used 9-and 10-residue sliding windows to scan all protein sequences, since 131 these are the optimum peptide lengths for binding to the HLA-A*02:01 groove (34). While spliced 132 peptide epitopes (35) are not considered in the current study, this functionality can be added to our 133 method at a later stage. Using NetMHCpan-4.0 (27), we identified all 439 9mer and 279 10mer 134 epitopes that are predicted to yield positive (classified as both weak and strong) binders. To further 135 validate this set and derive plausible 3D models of the peptide/HLA-A*02:01 complexes, we used 136 a structure-guided approach, RosettaMHC, which aims to derive a physically realistic fitness score 137 for each peptide in the HLA-A*02:01 binding groove using an annotated database of high-138 resolution structures and Rosetta's all-atom energy function (36). RosettaMHC leverages a 139 database of 241 HLA-A*02:01 X-ray structures encompassing a range of bound peptides, to find 140 the closest match to each target epitope predicted from the SARS-CoV-2 proteome. To identify 141 the best template for structure modeling, we use sequence matching criteria which first consider 142 the peptide anchors (positions P2 and P9/P10 for 9mer/10mer epitopes), followed by a sequence 143 similarity metric calculated from the full alignment between the template and target peptide 144 sequences. The template assignment statistics for the four different classes of SARS-CoV-2 145 epitopes in our set are shown in Figure 2a. We find that we can cover the entire set of 718 predicted 146 binders using a subset of 114 HLA-A*02:01 templates in our annotated database of PDB-derived 147 structures (Figure 2b).

Residues P3-167 P8 form a series of backbone and side chain contacts with pockets C, D and E, while most 168 backbone amide and carbonyl groups form hydrogen bonds with the side chains of residues lining 169 the MHC-I groove. These high-resolution structural features are consistent across low-energy 170 models of unrelated target peptides in our input set, suggesting that, when provided with a large 171 set of input templates, a combined threading and side chain optimization protocol can derive 172 physically realistic models. 173 174 Selection of high-affinity peptide epitopes using a structure-based score 175 To evaluate the accuracy of our models and fitness of each peptide within the HLA-A*02:01 176 binding groove, we computed Rosetta all-atom binding energies across all complexes modeled for 177 different peptide sets. High binding energies can be used as an additional metric to filter low-178 affinity peptides in the NetMHCpan-4.0 predictions, with the caveat that high energies can be also 179 due to incomplete optimization of the Rosetta energy function as a result of significant deviations 180 between the target and template backbone conformations, not captured by our protocol. We 181 performed 10 independent calculations for each peptide, and the 3 lower-energy models were 182 selected as the final ensemble and used to compute an average binding energy. The results for all 183 9mer peptides are summarized in Figures 3e, f, while additional results for 10mers are provided 184 through our web-interface and outlined in SupplementalTable 1.

These results suggest that the high-resolution features seen in our 211 models (Figure 3c, d) yield optimal binding energies for a significant fraction of the epitopes 212 predicted by NetMHCpan-4.0 (45/33% of strong binders and 30/25% of weak binders for 213 9mers/10mers, respectively), which are comparable to locally refined PDB structures.

Given that \u03b1\u03b2 TCRs generally employ a diagonal binding mode to engage pMHC-I 221 antigens where the CDR3\u03b1 and CDR3\u03b2 TCR loops form direct contacts with key peptide residues 222 (39, 40), knowledge of the surface features for different epitopes adds an extra layer of information 223 to interpret sequence variability between different viral strains. For other important antigens with 224 known structures in the PDB, such features can be derived from an annotated database connecting 225 pMHC-I/TCR co-crystal structures with biophysical binding data (41), and were recently 226 employed in an artificial neural network approach to predict the immunogenicity of different HLA-227 A*02:01 bound peptides in the context of tumor neoantigen display (42). A separate study has 228 shown that the electrostatic compatibility between self vs foreign HLA surfaces can be used to 229 determine antibody alloimmune responses (43). Given that antibodies and TCRs use a common 230 fold and similar principles to engage pMHC-I molecules (40), it is likely that surface electrostatic 231 features play an important role in recognition of peptide/HLA surfaces by their cognate TCRs in 232 the context of SARS-CoV-2 infection. 233 Electrostatic surface potentials calculated using a numerical solution to the Poisson-Boltzmann 234 Equation (44) for our modeled peptide/HLA-A*02:01 complexes allow us to compare important235",
