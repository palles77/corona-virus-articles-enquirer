            "text": "Integrins are a/b heterodimers, but recent in vitro and in vivo experiments also suggest an ability to associate through their transmembrane domains to form homomeric interactions. While the results of some in vitro experiments are consistent with an interaction mediated by a GxxxG-like motif, homooligomers observed after in vivo cross-linking are consistent with an almost opposite helix-helix interface. We have shown recently that both models of interaction are compatible with evolutionary conservation data, and we predicted that the a-helices in both models would have a similar rotational orientation. Herein, we have tested our prediction using in vitro asparagine scan of five consecutive residues along the GxxxG-like motif of the transmembrane domain of a and b integrins, aM and b2. We show that Asn-mediated dimerization occurs twice for every turn of the helix, consistent with two almost opposite forms of interaction as suggested previously for aIIb and b3 transmembrane domains. The orientational parameters helix tilt and rotational orientation of each of these two Asn-stabilized dimers were measured by site-specific infrared dichroism (SSID) in model lipid bilayers and were found to be consistent with our predicted computational models. Our results highlight an intrinsic tendency for integrin transmembrane a-helices to form two opposite types of homomeric interaction in addition to their heteromeric interactions and suggest that integrins may form complex and specific networks at the transmembrane domain during function. .",

Each subunit contains a large extracellular domain, a single transmembrane (TM) spanning a-helix, and a short cytoplasmic tail . Different types of a integrins can combine with different b counterparts, forming a variety of heterodimers. In humans, 18 a-chains can interact with eight different bchains to form 24 different a/b heterodimers with varied functions (Hemler 1999) . By spanning the membrane, the integrins serve as a dynamic linkage between cytoplasm and extracellular space, transducing signals across the membrane to mediate cell growth, differentiation, gene expression, motility, and apoptosis (Watt 2002) . Inside out signal transduction involves integrin cytoplasmic tails separation and subsequent ectodomain conformational changes, which alter the affinity of integrins for extracellular ligands (Hantgan et al. 1999; Kim et al. 2003; Travis et al. 2003) .",

This is not surprising, because the GxxxG motif is prevalent in TM sequences (Arkin and Brunger 1998) and in integrins in particular. The importance of this and other related motifs in a-helical TM domains has been demonstrated in exhaustive statistical analyses (Senes et al. 2000) . In addition, a selection of a random library of TM sequences for homodimerization clearly showed that the GxxxG motif is sufficient for strong helix-helix interactions (Russ and Engelman 2000) . The importance of this motif is highlighted by other experimental observations. For example, using the TOXCAT assay (Russ and Engelman 1999) , a test that measures the oligomerization in the Escherichia coli inner membrane of a chimeric protein containing a TM helix, a sequence critical for integrin aIIb-TM homodimerization that involved the GxxxG motif was suggested by Li et al. (2004) . Also, using a GALLEX assay (Schneider and Engelman 2003) , a two-hybrid system that monitors heterodimerization of membrane proteins in the E. coli inner membrane, the GxxxG-like motif was found to have an important role in homomeric transmembrane interactions in a4 and b7 (Schneider and Engelman 2004) .",

In b TMs, in vivo asparagine substitution G708N (Li et al. 2003) led to integrin activation and homotrimeric interactions were observed. In the cases above, the residues involved in the helix-helix interaction are opposite to the ''G'' residues in the GxxxG motif, hence consistent with our model II. These studies, however, were performed with the system aIIb/b3, and a detailed model for helix-helix interaction was not shown.",

            "text": "Herein, we have conducted an asparagine scan study to test our prediction, using synthetic peptides corresponding to the TM domains of integrin. Asparagine scan mutagenesis relies on the strong hydrogen bonds between asparagine side chains located in neighboring transmembrane domains, and their stabilization of helix-helix interactions (Choma et al. 2000; Zhou et al. 2001; Li et al. 2003; Ruan et al. 2004a,b) . Asn residues are not abundant in transmembrane a-helices (Stevens and Arkin 1999) , and when present generally point toward other a-helices. The assumption in asparagine scans is that only when the asparagine side chain is in a favorable position will oligomerization be enhanced. However, this method can only be used when TM interactions for the native peptide are weak, that is, when only monomers are present in SDS in the absence of asparagine. This condition is met for aM and b2 TMs, but not for other (I and  II) . Slices through the a-helical structure of the integrin TM model we predicted previously using a computational method ). Only the a carbons are shown. (A) Homodimer model I; (B) homodimer model II; (C) homotrimer model I; (D) homotrimer model II. In model I, the interaction takes place mediated by residues 1 and 5 (black balls) of the GxxxG-like motif. In model II, the interaction is opposite, through residue 3. Dotted lines are shown only to guide the eye. A more detailed representation of these structures is shown in Lin et al. (2006) . integrin TMs, for example, aIIb, b3, or b4, which homooligomerize in SDS (data not shown). Hence, we have performed our study using aM and b2 TMs. The pair aM/ b2, also referred to as Mac-1 or CR-3, is a major surface antigen on human leukocytes. Dysfunction of this integrin is associated with Leukocyte Adhesion Deficiency-1 (LAD1) and Glanzmann thrombasthenia (McDowall et al. 2003; Wehrle-Haller and Imhof 2003) .",

Therefore, we calculated these orientational values experimentally for aM-TM and b2-TM, using the pairs of labeled sequences (numbered 1-3) shown in Figure 2 . Each pair contains two consecutive isotopic labels (underlined) that allow calculation of the orientational parameters (see legend in Fig. 2 ). In this case, the rotational orientation of the a-helices in models I and II turned out to be very similar ). The reason is that they have opposite interacting faces and also opposite handedness (left or right). Therefore, although it is not possible to know which model (I or II) is present in the lipid bilayer when no asparagine is present, the TM interactions are restrained in the presence of asparagine and the model is known in the mutant sequences. Thus, we only need to confirm that the orientation in each sample (model I or II) is the same, and consistent with that predicted computationally . Figure 5 shows the infrared spectra of a labeled aM-TM synthetic peptide in the regions amide A and I, collected at parallel and perpendicular polarizations.

Therefore, two models cannot be distinguished with confidence if their difference in v at a particular residue is <50\u00b0. Figure 6 shows that the rotational orientation for residue 1120, v 1120 , (calculated using the pair of sequences labeled ''1'' in Fig. 2, top panel) in the aM mutant NSVGG was \u00c059\u00b06 20\u00b0. The difference in v with any of the computational models (dimeric or trimeric) of aM was always smaller than 50\u00b0; therefore, the orientation of the a-helices in our sample is compatible with both models I and II.

There are indications, however, that homomerization can take place even when the heterodimer is still in place. For example, in the a/b heterodimer (aIIb/b3), residues at the ''G'' position in the GxxxG-like motif of aIIb TM participate in helix-helix contacts in the resting state (Luo et al. 2004 ). However, aIIb mutation W967C, which points away from the a/b interface, was found to be involved in the formation of the species (aIIb/b3) 2 , a dimer of dimers, through formation of a disulfide bond (Luo et al. 2004 ). The latter result suggests that aIIb chains can form homodimers through a GxxxG-like motifindependent interaction (similar to our model II; Fig. 1 ) in the resting state. The potential coexistence of heterodimer and a homodimers has also been suggested earlier (Gottschalk and Kessler 2004) .",

Transition from the resting state to this intermediate state necessitates rotation of the b subunit, and this rotation would expose G708 in aIIb to the lipid environment, making possible the coexistence of a/b heterodimer and b homomerization via model II. The possibility that the a or b homo-oligomerization and a/b heterodimer can be simultaneously present, suggests that homo-oligomerization could provide the energy requirement for aand b-chain separation (Gottschalk 2005) in certain instances.

The rotational pitch angle v is defined arbitrarily as 0\u00b0when the transition dipole moment, the helix director, and the Z-axis all reside in a single plane.
