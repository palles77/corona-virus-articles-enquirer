Age of cat is an important consideration. Younger cats are more likely to develop parasitism, inappropriate nutrition, or protein-losing nephropathy.

            "text": "consistent with hyperadrenocorticism. False negatives and positives occur. \u2022 Low-dose dexamethasone suppression test -Collect baseline blood sample, give dexamethasone 0.01 mg/kg IV, collect blood after 4 and 8 hours. In normal cats serum cortisol should be < 30 nmol/L (< 1.0 \u03bcg/dl) at 4 h and 8 h after dexamethasone. Lack of suppression is seen in most cats (95%) with hyperadrenocorticism, and some cats with nonadrenal illness. \u2022 Urine cortisol to creatinine ratio (UC/CR) -Collect urine sample, centrifuge and submit supernatant. A normal ratio almost always rules out hyperadrenocorticism. Unfortunately, an increased ratio is commonly caused by non-adrenal illness. The test is more reliable if the sample is collected at home. Additional tests may be used to try to differentiate pituitary-dependent hyperadrenocorticism (PDH) from adrenal neoplasia. These include: \u2022 High-dose dexamethasone suppression test -Performed as low-dose dexamethasone suppression test but give 0.1 mg/kg. Lack of suppression at 8 h is seen in most cats (80%) with hyperadrenocorticism. Suppression at 4 h but not at 8 h is consistent with PDH. False negatives may occur in mild cases of hyperadrenocorticism. \u2022 Ultra-high-dose dexamethasone suppression test -Performed as low-dose dexamethasone suppression test but give 1.0 mg/kg. Suppression at 4 h or 8 h to < 30 nmol/l (< 1.0 \u03bcg/dl) or <50% of baseline is consistent with PDH, but lack of suppression may be seen with PDH and adrenal tumors. \u2022 Combination test -Collect blood sample, give 1.0 mg/kg dexamethasone IV, collect blood after 4 h, then immediately perform ACTH stimulation test as above. Interpretation is as for ACTH stimulation test and ultra-high-dose dexamethasone suppression test (taking ultra-high-dose dexamethasone suppression test result as result at 4 h). \u2022 'At home' protocol -Collect urine on the morning of Days 1 and 2; give two oral doses of dexamethasone at 8 hour intervals at 4 pm and 12 pm; then collect a third urine sample on the morning of Day 3. All three samples are assessed for UC/CR. The mean of the first two UC/CR = basal value and acts as a screening test. Suppression < 50% basal on Day 3 is not seen in cats with adrenal-dependent hyperadrenocorticism, but may be seen in cats with PDH. \u2022 Measurement of endogenous ACTH -Collect blood sample in EDTA, spin immediately, transfer plasma to a plastic tube, ship overnight on ice or freeze for storage. Plasma ACTH is high normal or above (>15 pg/ml) with PDH, and low (<10 pg/ml) with adrenal tumors. \u2022 Radiography, ultrasonography and, where available, CT or MRI. Use to determine adrenal size and shape. The presence of adrenal mineralization should not be over-interpreted as it occurs i\u00f1 30% of normal cats. Unilateral adrenal enlargement is typical of an adrenal tumor. While bilateral enlargement usually indicates PDH, it can occasionally result from bilateral adrenal tumors. Hepatomegaly is found in ~75% of all cats with hyperadrenocorticism. CT and MRI can be used to image the pituitary gland as well as the adrenal glands.",
