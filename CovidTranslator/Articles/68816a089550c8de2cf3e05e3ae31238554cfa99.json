However, in vivo manipulation of FRCs has been limited by a dearth of genetic tools targeting this lineage. Here, using a mouse model to conditionally ablate FRCs, we demonstrate their indispensable role in anti-viral T cell responses. Unexpectedly, FRC loss also attenuated humoral immunity due to impaired B cell viability and follicular organization. Follicle-resident FRCs established a favorable niche for B lymphocytes via production of the cytokine BAFF. Thus, our study indicates that adaptive immunity requires an intact FRC network and illuminates a subset of FRCs that controls B cell homeostasis and follicle identity.",

Expression of CCL19 and CCL21 by FRCs, in addition to other adhesion molecules, facilitates chemokine receptor CCR7-dependent homing of naive T cells and provides essential guidance cues to dendritic cells that migrate from non-lymphoid tissues into the lymph node paracortex [6] [7] [8] . Additionally, interleukin 7 (IL-7) production by FRCs is thought to be essential for preservation of the peripheral T cell pool under homeostatic conditions 9 .

FDCs are characterized by localization within B cell follicles, expression of the complement receptors CR1 and CR2 (CD21 and CD35) and the follicular dendritic cell marker 1 (FDCM1), and the ability to display opsonized antigens to B cells. Expression of B cell trophic factors, namely the chemokine CXCL13 and the pro-survival factor BAFF (also known as BlyS, TALL-1, TNFSF13B, TNFSF20), is often attributed to FDCs, implicating these cells in shepherding B cells to follicles, supporting B cell survival and coordinating the germinal center reaction [13] [14] [15] [16] . Previous work employing a system to ablate FDCs provided definitive evidence that, while this stromal subset is critical for germinal center responses, it plays only a minor role in B cell homeostasis within resting lymph nodes 17 . Likewise, loss of FDCs was not mirrored by a decrease in Tnfsf13b, hereafter referred to as Baff, transcript abundance, pointing to the presence of an alternative source. These observations have led some investigators to postulate that MRCs, which reside in close juxtaposition to the subcapsular sinus (SCS) of lymph nodes 18 , serve these functions, but data supporting this hypothesis are not yet available. Thus, the cell population supporting B cell homeostasis within primary follicles has remained enigmatic.",

Our data demonstrate that FRC ablation led to marked alterations in T cell homeostasis and compartmentalization, with profound consequences in the activation, expansion and effector function of viral antigen-specific T lymphocytes. Unexpectedly, loss of FRCs also led to significantly reduced B cell viability and altered follicular organization, followed by marked impairment in humoral immunity to T-dependent and T-independent viral antigens.

A transgenic Cre mouse line that permits targeting of FRCs, in which expression of Cre recombinase is directed by the Ccl19 promoter 19 , was only recently generated. By crossing the transgenic Ccl19-Cre line to Rosa26-enhanced yellow fluorescent protein (EYFP) mice, we have generated Ccl19-Cre x Rosa26-EYFP reporter mice, in which EYFP expression is achieved following Cre-mediated excision of a loxP-flanked transcriptional \"stop\" sequence ( Supplementary Fig. 1a ). Confocal laser scanning microscopy of lymph nodes from Ccl19-Cre x Rosa26-EYFP mice revealed expression of the transgene in the T cell zone, thereby supporting efficient excision of floxed loci in the expected location (Fig. 1a,b) . Flow cytometric analysis demonstrated EYFP expression in FRCs, identified as non-hematopoietic cells expressing the glycoprotein podoplanin (PDPN) and negative for the endothelial marker CD31 and the cell adhesion molecule MadCAM-1 (CD45 \u2212 PDPN + CD31 \u2212 MadCAM \u2212 ) ( Fig. 1c and Supplementary Fig.  1b) . EYFP expression was not detected in other lymph node stromal cells including lymphatic endothelial cells (LECs, CD45 \u2212 PDPN + CD31 + ), blood endothelial cells (BECs, CD45 \u2212 PDPN \u2212 CD31 + ) or integrin \u03b1 7 -expressing pericytes (IAPs, CD45-PDPN \u2212 CD31 \u2212 ) (Fig. 1c) , thereby confirming specificity of the Ccl19 promoter. Despite the recent reports suggesting a close developmental relationship between FRCs and MRCs 20 (CD45 \u2212 PDPN + CD31 \u2212 MadCAM + ), MRCs did not appear to be targeted with Ccl19-directed recombinase, as demonstrated by the absence of EYFP expression in MadCAM-1 + cells lining the subcapsular sinus by flow cytometry and confocal microscopic analysis (Fig. 1c e).",

In these mice, cells with an active Ccl19 promoter (FRCs) express the simian DTR, and are selectively vulnerable to toxin-induced apoptosis when exposed to DTxn. A single injection of DTxn into these mice was sufficient to achieve rapid and extensive ablation of FRCs from lymph nodes. FRCs were lost as early as 24 h following DTxn administration (Fig. 2a-c) and deletion was specific, as we did not detect changes in cellularity of other lymph node stromal populations, including LECs, BECs and IAPs (Fig. 2d) . Consistent with FRCs being the predominant source of the chemokine CCL19 (refs. 8, 9 ) , its expression in lymph nodes was abrogated after FRC ablation, whereas expression of genes shared with other cells, such as Ccl21 (ref. 8 ), was only partially reduced (Fig. 2e,f) . As such, we were able to detect MadCAM-1 + RANK-L + cells along the lymph node subcapsular sinus of FRC-ablated mice ( Fig. 2g and Supplementary Fig. 1d) , confirming a lack of Ccl19 promoter activity in MRCs. In line with this finding, Rank-l transcript encoded by Tnfsf11, which is shared by MRCs and FRCs 8, 18 , was only partially reduced in total lymph node mRNA preparation after FRC ablation ( Supplementary Fig. 1e) , despite complete abrogation of Ccl19 (Fig. 2e) .",

DTxn administration was not associated with systemic toxicity, and it did not lead to weight loss or extra-nodal pathology (Supplementary Fig. 2a and data not shown).

In splenic white pulp, where the Ccl19 promoter is active in both FRCs and CD31 \u2212 PDPN \u2212 (DN) cells ( 19 and Supplementary Fig. 4a ), DTxn administration efficiently targeted EYFP + stroma ( Supplementary Fig. 4b ,c), with a significant decrease in FRCs and DN cells ( Supplementary Fig. 4d ,e). FRC ablation had no effect on splenic weight or cellularity ( Supplementary Fig. 4f ,g) but markedly altered white pulp architecture ( Supplementary Fig.  4h) . B cell numbers were also reduced in the spleen (Supplementary Fig. 4i ), although to a lesser extent than in lymph nodes ( Supplementary Fig. 4j) . Functionally, the effects observed in the spleen impinged on marginal zone humoral responses, with a significant decrease in IgM production upon TNP-ficoll immunization ( Supplementary Fig. 4k ). As Ccl19 promoter activity was also reported in Peyer's patches ( 19 and Supplementary Fig.  5a ), we investigated the fate of Peyer's patches following FRC ablation. Systemic DTxn administration evoked less severe effects in Peyer's patches, with milder reductions in FRC and B cell numbers ( Supplementary Fig. 5b,c) . Similarly, no major anatomical alterations were observed, with the exception of a paucity of T cell clusters in interfollicular regions ( Supplementary Fig. 5d ). Together, these observations pointed to an unanticipated regulation of B cell homeostasis by FRCs, and suggest that damage to the FRC network has deleterious consequences on the cellular circuitries that underpin humoral responses.",

            "text": "Given the reported role for FRCs in regulating immune cell trafficking 6, 7, 9, 26 , we hypothesized that the decrease in B cell numbers after FRC ablation could stem from impaired lymphocyte homing to lymph nodes. To test this hypothesis, congenic CFSElabeled B cells were adoptively transferred into DTxn-treated Ccl19-Cre x iDTR mice, and enumerated within lymph nodes 90 min and 24 h later by flow cytometry. Donor B cell numbers were markedly reduced in lymph nodes of FRC-ablated mice at both time points ( Supplementary Fig. 6a) . B cell homing to lymph nodes depends on CCL19 and CXCL12 (ref. 27 ), and Cxcl12 expression in FRCs has been previously documented 8 . Indeed, Cxcl12 expression was significantly reduced in FRC-ablated mice ( Supplementary Fig. 6b) , and FRCs were sufficient to evoke B cell chemotaxis in vitro ( Supplementary Fig. 6c ), suggesting that FRCs recruit B cells, possibly via CXCL12 and CCL19. Importantly, blockade of lymphocyte ingress (via treatment with a CD62L blocking antibody) was not sufficient to significantly perturb B cell numbers in the first 24 h after treatment ( Supplementary Fig. 6d ), in contrast to the rapid B cell loss observed in FRC-ablated mice ( Fig. 5a,b) . Additionally, preventing lymphocyte egress from lymph nodes with a sphingosine 1-phosphate receptor antagonist, FTY720, did not completely restore B cell numbers following FRC ablation ( Supplementary Fig. 6e ). Altogether, these data suggest that while B cell entry requires an intact FRC network, impaired B cell trafficking can only account for part of the reduction in B cell numbers following FRC ablation. This consideration prompted us to investigate the possibility that FRCs may regulate additional aspects of B cell homeostasis. Consistent with this hypothesis, B cell loss in FRC-ablated mice coincided with a significant increase in propidium iodide-positive B cells (Fig. 6a,b) implicating FRCs in promoting B cell survival.",

            "text": "Most efforts to characterize FRCs have thus far focused on their roles in supporting T cell homeostasis, migration and activation. However, a discrete population of FRCs is also found in and around follicles (B cell zone FRCs, Fig. 6c ), and we reasoned that such a locale could position FRCs to directly interact with and influence B cells. This observation, together with the decreased B cell survival observed in FRC-ablated mice, led us to hypothesize that FRCs may provide critical survival factors for naive B cells. In this context, BAFF plays a critical role in survival of mature B cells 28, 29 . The key source of BAFF in secondary lymphoid organs was previously identified as a radiation resistant cell 30 , with FDCs often considered the sole BAFF-producing stromal cell 31 . Thus, we reasoned that the phenotypes observed in FRC-ablated mice may be secondary to a reduction in FDCs. To test if FDCs were directly targeted in our system, we ascertained whether the Ccl19 promoter was active in FDCs in situ by fluorescence imaging in Ccl19-Cre x Rosa26-EYFP mice. As depicted by FDCM1 and CXCL13 staining, EYFP was absent in the majority of FDCs in steady state lymph nodes (Fig. 6d) . Less EYFP staining was detected in a small number of FDCM1 + processes (Fig. 6d) , possibly due to the tight interconnections that exist between FRCs and FDCs in follicles 4, 32 . Additionally, to assess the status of FDCs in FRC-ablated mice, we performed quantitative microscopic analysis of lymph nodes at different time points after DTxn administration. Our data demonstrated that FDCs are present 24 h after DTxn administration ( Fig. 6e and quantified in Fig. 6f ), despite profound loss of FRCs (Fig. 2c) . Furthermore, FDCs remained functionally competent at this time point, as demonstrated by their ability to correctly display exogenous immune complexes ( Supplementary Fig. 7a ). Prolonged DTxn exposure led to a progressive reduction in FDC volume, as depicted by a decrease in FDCM1 integrated intensity (Fig. 6e ,f) and decreased CD35 staining as well (data not shown). Notably, contraction of the FDC network appeared to be transient and was followed by reappearance of FDCM1 + cells 3 days after FRC ablation (Fig. 6e,f) . Furthermore, direct comparison of FRC and FDC ablation revealed that loss of FRCs rapidly abrogated Baff expression in vivo while depletion of FDCs did not (Fig. 6g ). Together these results point to a previously unrecognized regulatory role for FRCs in maintaining BAFF amounts and B cell viability. Accordingly, the large decrease in B cell numbers was only observed in FRCablated mice but not in FDC-ablated animals (Fig. 6h) . Notably, FRC ablation perturbed Baff expression without perturbing expression of the closely related factor April encoded by Tnfsf13 (Fig. 6i,j) . Moreover, impaired Baff mRNA expression in FRC-ablated mice was mirrored by a similar abrogation in BAFF protein abundance, as assessed by confocal microscopic analysis of lymph node sections (Fig. 6k) . Interestingly, concentrations of BAFF protein in serum were unperturbed in FRC-ablated mice ( Supplementary Fig. 7b ), indicating that FRC loss influences local BAFF production rather than perturbing a systemic reservoir. Furthermore, by injecting carefully titrated DTxn in the footpad, we were able to achieve anatomically restricted FRC ablation, and consequently B cell loss, only in the draining popliteal lymph nodes, without disrupting distal lymph nodes ( Supplementary Fig.  7c,d) . Thus, the functional consequences of FRC depletion on B cell homeostasis are primarily mediated by a local effect in the organ where the ablation occurs.",

Confocal microscopic in situ analysis of B cell zone FRCs revealed that these cells are indeed capable of producing BAFF protein (Fig. 7a ). In line with this finding, BAFF production was also observed by flow cytometry in a discrete fraction of freshly isolated FRCs (Fig. 7b) . Notably, BAFF was rapidly cleaved from the cell surface in a protease-dependent manner, similar to other molecules belonging to the TNF superfamily ( Supplementary Fig. 7e) . Importantly, BAFF + cells were characterized by expression of several FRC canonical genes encoding PDPN, \u03b1-smooth muscle actin (\u03b1SMA), CD44, Cadherin-11, CD140\u03b1 and CD140\u03b2, VCAM, and fibroblastactivation protein (FAP) (Fig. 7c) , supporting that these cells are nearly identical to FRCs. Thus, our data suggest that FRCs positioned in follicular regions contribute to B cell homeostasis by providing the pro-survival factor BAFF. To directly test the aforementioned hypothesis, we cultured B cells in the presence or absence of FRCs and measured B cell viability using propidium iodide staining by flow cytometry. Remarkably, B cells exhibited significantly enhanced viability when cultured in the presence of FRCs compared with B cells cultured alone (Fig. 7d) . The elevated number of propidium iodide-negative B220 + cells in cultures with FRCs could not be accounted for by proliferation (Supplementary Fig.  7f ). To ascertain whether the survival advantage conferred by FRCs was due to a soluble factor, B cells were cultured with stromal cells in separate compartments of a transwell chamber or with FRC-conditioned medium. In both conditions, B cells exhibited enhanced viability indicating the presence of a soluble pro-survival factor derived from FRCs (Fig.  7e ). Next we sought to determine whether the pro-survival factor contributed by FRCs was BAFF. To this end, FRC-conditioned medium was pre-incubated with a BAFF-specific blocking antibody prior to addition to B cells. Strikingly, the enhancement of B cell survival was largely abrogated following BAFF neutralization (Fig. 7f) . In sum, our data describe a subset of FRCs delineating the borders of B cell follicles in lymph nodes (B cell zone FRCs) that nurture B cells through the production of BAFF (Supplementary Fig. 8 ).",

Recent generation of Ccl19-Cre mice provided a solution to this technological limitation 19 . In particular, cell type-specific expression of DTR allowed us to test the functional outcomes of disrupting the FRC network in physiological settings. FRC ablation caused a severe reduction in T cell numbers in resting lymph nodes, and marked impairment in antigen-specific T cell responses. Unexpectedly, FRC ablation was not immediately accompanied by a collapse of the structured conduit system, suggesting that lymph node infrastructure can persist and function for longer periods following damage to stromal cells. Rather, the absence of the cellular source of the reticular network (i.e. FRCs) impinged on T cell dynamics and function. Thus, our study demonstrates that FRCs are essential for optimal T cell immunity but not short-term maintenance of the conduit system.",

While most lymph node FRCs reside within the T cell-rich paracortex, some localize in the vicinity of follicular conduits near the subcapsular sinus 4,32 . Our identification of Ccl19-Cre + cells in B cell follicles (B cell zone FRCs) confirmed that FRCs span both the inner and outer regions of the lymph node 33 . Unexpectedly, we found that B cell zone FRCs constitute a non-redundant source of BAFF. The source of BAFF in secondary lymphoid organs was previously identified as a radioresistant cell 30 , oft attributed to FDCs. This concept was confounded however by reports that abrogation of LT\u03b2R signaling, critical for FDC development and maintenance, did not affect BAFF expression or B cell numbers [34] [35] [36] [37] . Further, a Cd21-Cre conditional ablation system provided evidence that FDCs are dispensable for BAFF expression and naive B cell survival 17 . Although it cannot be excluded that FDCs contribute to BAFF production and their ablation induces a compensatory up-regulation by other cells, these data pointed to an alternate source of BAFF in resting lymph nodes. Based on our data, we propose that B cell zone FRCs represent this source of BAFF and thereby directly support B cell homeostasis. Disrupted follicular organization in FRC-ablated mice may also contribute to decreased B cell survival, as FRCs in intact lymphoid organs would coordinate migration of naive B cells from high endothelial venules to BAFF-rich follicles. Furthermore, while FRC ablation does not appear to impede lymph transit to and within lymph nodes, it may affect the ability of migratory dendritic cells to deliver tissue-derived antigens to T and B cells, thus contributing to the diminished antibody production observed in Ccl19-Cre x iDTR mice. Collectively, our findings indicate that alterations in lymph node stromal composition can have catastrophic consequences on immunological competency, with decreased lymphocyte viability and disorganized spatial organization of T and B cell responses.",

Furthermore, our studies indicated that most FDCs were devoid of promoter activity, and should thus be refractory to DTxn-induced apoptosis. A few cell processes from FDCM1 + cells displayed weak positivity for EYFP. However, given the tight association between FRCs and FDCs in follicles 4,32 , it remains difficult to discern between bona fide promoter activity in these FDCs, or proximity to EYFP + FRCs in follicular regions. In this regard, we observed functionally competent FDCs early after DTxn administration, when profound loss of FRCs has already occurred, suggesting that FDCs are not directly targeted in this system. Consequently, reduction of FDCM1 staining at later time points, likely mediated by a contraction or de-differentiation of the FDC network, may arise from a yet unrecognized crosstalk between FRCs and FDCs. Our finding that contraction of the FDC network was transient and rapidly followed by a regeneration phase is of particular interest. One potential explanation is that damage to the FDC network, secondary to FRC loss, may induce MRCs to generate new FDCM1 + cells 39 .",
