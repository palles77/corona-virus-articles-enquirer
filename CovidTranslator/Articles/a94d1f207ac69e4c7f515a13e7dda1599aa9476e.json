Rotavirus particles could be detected in 39 out of 98 faecal samples by electron microscopy. Immunofluorescence, complement fixation, and immunoelectroosmophoresis detected rotavirus antigens in 39, 42, and 30 samples, respectively. The enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay demonstrated rotavirus antigens in 4-9 faecal samples. The assay is not only sensitive but also simple to perform and suitable for large-scale testing.",

            "text": "Rotavirus has been implicated as one of the major causative agents in newborn calf diarrhoea [2, 8, 18] . Because many strains of the virus do not grow well in cell culture [18] , the diagnosis is based on direct detection in the faeces. Negative contrast electron microscopy has proved to be a reliable method of diagnosis [8] . However, the method is not suitable for the study of large numbers of specimens and its applicability is limited by the lack of general availability and of the expertise needed to perform this technique. A definite need therefore exists for other diagnostic techniques suitable for etiological and epidemiological studies. We have compared a number of previously described techniques with respect to their sensitivity, simplicity, and applicability for large-scale testing. These techniques are immunoelectroosmophoresis (IEOP) [5, 9, 15] , a complement-fixation test (CFT) [14] , an immunofluorescence test OFT) on inoculated cell cultures [2] , and an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) [3, 13, 19] . In this report we present the results of this study. D.J. EUens et al.",

In 39 faecal samples virus was detected by IFT and EM, whereas the CFT demonstrated the presence of the agent in 42 samples. The ELISA detected viral antigens in 49 samples (Fig. 1) Eleven other samples were scored weakly positive in the direct assay, but could not be confirmed in the blocking assay. These samples were considered to be negative. Of the 49 samples scored positive by the ELISA, 43 were confirmed by at least one of the other techniques (Fig. 1) . ELISA, CFT, EM, IFT, and IEOP demonstrated the presence of rotavirus or rotavirus antigens in faecal samples of 24, 22, 21, 21, and 18 calves that developed diarrhoea, respectively. Rotavirus antigens were detected by ELISA in the faeces of two calves that remained healthy, and in the faeces of two other calves by IFT.",

Precipitation lines at approximately equal distances from the antibody trough and the antigen well were never observed using these samples. Thus, only these lines were considered specific for the presence of rotavirus antigens. Use of CArota serum instead of RArota serum did not improve the sensitivity of the IEOP [4] . The IEOP is easy to perform and can be used for the examination of large numbers of samples. However the results are not rapid available and small amounts of antigen may not be detected. This same conclusion was reached by others working with human rotavirus [9, 14] . No further attempts were made to improve the sensitivity of this test. It is conceivable, however, that the use of a rabbit serum prepared against immunoprecipitates [5 ] may improve the results.",

Its sensitivity compares favourably with that of the other techniques, and its specificity can easily be checked by the blocking assay. Serial dilution experiments, using the standard positive faecal extract, showed that rotavirus antigens could be detected by ELISA in a dilution of 1:5000, compared to 1:32 in the IEOP and 1:128 in CFT [4] . The blocking assay requires an additional incubation step of I h at 37oc in comparison with the direct ELISA. During this period the antigen-antibody complexes in the cups are exposed to PBS containing 0.5 M NaCI and 0.05% Tween 80. This may explain the fact that by the use of this procedure rotavirus antigens in the standard positive faecal extract could only be detected up to the 1:2500 dilution, i.e., a twofold loss in sensitivity. The same effect was also observed when other samples were used. Thus weakly positive samples in the direct assay may be negative in the blocking assay: the 11 faecal samples found weakly positive in the direct assay but scored negative in the blocking assay, in fact remain doubtful.",
