The receptor binding domain (RBD) of the S-protein mediates viral entrance through binding dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP4, also known as CD26), a serine protease expressed on the surface of many cell types (Raj et al., 2013) . The tissue distribution of DPP4 has been described in some animal species, including dromedary camels, bats, pigs, llamas, sheep and horses (Vergara-Alert et al., 2017; Widagdo et al., 2016 Widagdo et al., , 2017 .

In addition, the degree of ciliation of the upper respiratory tract in both species was studied by scanning electron microscopy (SEM).",

A number of mechanisms have been proposed to explain such ciliary loss, including direct destruction of the ciliary apparatus, ionic variations during respiratory viral attachment and replication stages, damage through regulating the production of oxidizing metabolites, and apoptosis (Jumat et al., 2015; Mall, 2008; Vareille, Kieninger, Edwards, & Regamey, 2011) . Therefore, the severe ciliary loss observed in nasal turbinates of pigs from this study was probably due to a bystander effect, since a very low amount of MERS-CoV antigen and RNA was found in these affected turbinates. More recent evidence suggests that the speed and efficiency of viral antigen to attach the host cell is accelerated by an entry complex that includes DPP4, a CoV-activating transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2) and the tetraspanin Cd9 (Earnest et al., 2017) .",

Dipeptidyl peptidase-4 protein was detected by IHC following a previously published protocol (Vergara-Alert et al., 2017). Tissue sections were incubated with 5 \u03bcg/ml of polyclonal goat IgG antihuman DPP4 primary antibody (R&D Systems, Abingdon, UK) in a humid chamber at 4\u00b0C overnight. On the following day, slides were washed with phosphate buffered saline with 0.1% tween 20 (pH 7.45), and incubated for 1 hr at RT with alkaline phosphataselabelled horse anti-goat IgG (ImmPRESS \u2122 -AP Polymer Anti-Goat IgG Reagent, Burlingame, CA, USA). Each slide was then incubated with ImmPACT Vector Red Alkaline Phosphatase Substrate (Burlingame, CA, USA) for 10 min and presence of antigen produced a bright red reaction product.

Finally, slides were counterstained with haematoxylin for 10 s and then coverslipped with mounting medium prior to microscopic examination (Nikon Eclipse 50i). Negative controls included the addition of blocking solution (DAKO; Agilent Technologies Company, Santa Clara, CA, USA) instead of primary antibodies for both immunohistochemical techniques. The studied tissues of pigs and llamas were considered as positive controls for the DPP4 IHC, since they constitutively express the studied viral receptor. Also, a nasal turbinate from a dromedary camel infected with MERS-CoV (Haagmans et al., 2016) was used as positive control for MERS-CoV IHC. A grading system for virus antigen expression was established based on the number of cells stained by IHC. Four scores were defined: \u2212, no positive cells detected; +, less than 10 positive cells per tissue section; ++, 10 to 50 positive cells per tissue section; and +++, more than 50 positive cells per tissue section.",

One epithelial cell (arrow) shows MERS-CoV and DPP4 co-localization; the rest of cells containing viral antigen (arrowheads and curved arrow) do not show DPP4 expression. (b) Frontal turbinate; llama. DPP4 staining is present in the lining cilia as well as in the capillaries (arrowheads). In this section, a single epithelial cell harbours MERS-CoV antigen (brown cytoplasmic staining) in the cytoplasm (arrow) in co-localization with DPP4.

In addition, DPP4 was also located in lining cilia and cytoplasm of pseudostratified columnar epithelial cells, and the cytoplasm of macrophages, and neutrophils and vascular endothelial cells in trachea (Figure 3a). The distribution of DPP4 in the bronchus was similar to that in the trachea, with some positive lymphocytes and lack of expression in the neutrophils (Figure 3b). It was also detected in the apical layers of the cuboidal epithelium in bronchioli (Figure 4a) and terminal bronchioli (Figure 4b). In the alveoli, cytoplasmic DPP4 was abundantly present in both type I and II pneumocytes (Figure 5a). Such expression was moderate in the mediastinal lymph node and bronchus-associated lymphoid tissue (BALT, Figure 6a). DPP4 was extensively expressed in the cytoplasm of dendritic reticular cells of germinal centers as well as in the cytoplasm of macrophages and lymphocytes of the medulla in both cervical lymph nodes (Figure 7a) and tonsils. Also, DPP4 staining was seen in epithelial reticular cells in Hassall's corpuscles in the thymus. No differences in the distribution of DPP4 were observed when comparing tissues on different days p.i. In llamas, in contrast, DPP4 was predominantly expressed in cilia of nasal epithelium, the cytoplasm of endothelial cells as well as on the apical surface of glandular cells of the submucosal glands in nasal turbinate; DPP4 antigen was not detected in the cytoplasm of nasal epithelial cells (Figures 1b, 2c and d). DPP4 expression was present in the cilia of tracheal and bronchial epithelial cells and in the cytoplasm of endothelial cells(Figures 3c and d).

The number of MERS-CoV positive cells and MERS-CoV/DPP4 double positive cells was higher in llamas compared to that of pigs. Moreover, variation in labelling and localization of both DPP4 and MERS-CoV were observed between pigs and llamas. In addition, the amount of MERS-CoV antigen in these two species showed a consistent correlation with the MERS-CoV genome levels detected by RT-qPCR in respiratory and lymphoid tissues, indicating that host cell factors necessary for MERS-CoV attachment, penetration and RNA and protein synthesis are present in both pigs and llamas. Noteworthy, MERS-CoV infection led to striking differences of ciliation in respiratory tracts between pigs and llamas. Based on the SEM study, experimental infection with MERS-CoV in pigs was associated with a severe ciliary loss in the nasal turbinates in the early phase of the infection (days 2 and 4 p.i.). Tracheal deciliation, in contrast, was observed at later time points (days 4 and 24 p.i.), being more severe on day 4 p.i. Bronchial ciliation was unaffected during the whole experiment. On the other hand, experimental infection of llamas with MERS-CoV led to almost no effect on nasal, tracheal and bronchial ciliation. These results contrast with recent data generated in dromedary camels, in which ciliary loss was very prominent SEM micrographs of ciliary damage in the respiratory tract of MERS-CoV inoculated pigs and healthy control pigs. On day 4 p.i., severe ciliary loss was detected in nasal turbinate (a) and trachea (b), while ciliary density was unaffected in bronchus (c). Control pigs showed tightly packed ciliation in apical surface of epithelial cells of nasal turbinate, trachea and bronchus (scale bar, 10 \u03bcm) (Haverkamp et al., 2018). In fact, these authors observed that MERS-CoV infected epithelial cells lost cilia and showed lack of apical DPP4 antigen, while the adjacent non-infected cells retained the DPP4 staining. Such evidence was not observed in pigs (DPP4 was detected in the cytoplasm mainly, with a significant loss of cilia) and llamas (infected cells retained apical and cytoplasmic DPP4 labelling and no significant cilia loss occurred) of this study. Ciliary loss of the upper respiratory tract has also been described in other viral infections such as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-CoV in humans",

            "text": "Both pigs and llamas suffered from a subclinical, time-limited infection by MERS-CoV. Three out of 8 llamas showed moderate mucus secretion in 1 nostril on days 4-18 p.i while three pigs showed only mild mucus secretion on days 2-16 p.i (Vergara-Alert et al., 2017). To date, decisive factors that restrict further replication of MERS-CoV in the hosts are still poorly understood. It cannot be excluded that strong innate and/or adaptive immune responses may be responsible for virus clearance. In lymphoid tissues of both species (in the pigs only in the BALT), a limited number of cells were stained positive for MERS-CoV antigen.Noteworthy, these cells had the morphology of dendritic cells (DCs). MERS-CoV has been reported to productively infect human DCs in vitro, which can also serve as a vector for viral dissemination within the body(Chu et al., 2014). However, human DCs can secrete interferons (IFNs) and then trigger a potent innate/adaptive response upon MERS-CoV infection(Scheuplein et al., 2015). Thus, those DC-like cells could interfere with viral replication by releasing cytokines, like type I IFNs, or delivering antigens to other immune cells at the time MERS-CoV reaches this area(Scheuplein et al., 2015). Future studies on this topic are therefore required to verify whether these cells are effectively DCs and if they are able to express DPP4 at the surface before infection.Obtained results suggest the possibility that, besides DPP4, other surface molecules may facilitate virus entry; the potential absence or minimal expression of these latter putative molecules in pigs could be a cause for lower virus replication compared to llamas.Chan et al. (2016) estimated that carcinoembryonic antigenrelated cell adhesion molecule 5 (CEACAM5) is an important surface attachment factor that facilitates entry of MERS-CoV in vitro.",
