Steinsv\u00e5 g, MD, PhD, d and Alkis Togias, MD e Colorado Springs, Colo, Cardiff and Southampton, United Kingdom, Kristiansand, Norway, and Baltimore, Md Nasal obstruction can be monitored objectively by measurement of nasal airflow, as evaluated by nasal peak flow, or as airways resistance/conductance as evaluated by rhinomanometry. Peak flow can be measured during inspiration or expiration. Of these measurements, nasal inspiratory peak flow is the best validated technique for home monitoring in clinical trials. The equipment is portable, relatively inexpensive, and simple to use. One disadvantage, however, is that nasal inspiratory peak flow is influenced by lower airway as well as upper airway function. Rhinomanometry is a more sensitive technique that is specific for nasal measurements. The equipment, however, requires an operator, is more expensive, and is not portable. Thus, it is applicable only for clinic visit measures in clinical trials.",

            "text": "Measurements require patient cooperation and coordination, and not all can achieve repeatable results. Thus, this objective measure is best suited to laboratory challenge studies involving smaller numbers of selected volunteers. A nonphysiological measure of nasal patency is acoustic rhinometry. This sonic echo technique measures internal nasal luminal volume and the minimum cross-sectional area. The derivation of these measures from the reflected sound waves requires complex mathematical transformation and makes several theoretical assumptions. Despite this, however, such measures correlate well with the nasal physiological measures, and the nasal volume measures have been shown to relate well to results obtained by imaging techniques such as computed tomography scanning or magnetic resonance imaging. Like rhinomanometry, acoustic rhinometry is not suitable for home monitoring and can be applied only to clinic visit measures or for laboratory nasal challenge monitoring. It has advantages in being easy to use, in requiring little patient cooperation, and in providing repeatable results. In addition to nasal obstruction, allergic rhinitis is recognized to be associated with impaired mucociliary clearance and altered nasal responsiveness. Measures exist for the monitoring of these aspects of nasal dysfunction. Although measures of mucociliary clearance are simple to perform, they have a poor record of reproducibility. Their incorporation into clinical trials is thus questionable, although positive outcomes from therapeutic intervention have been reported. Measures of nasal responsiveness are at present largely confined to research studies investigating disease mechanisms in allergic and nonallergic rhinitis. The techniques are insufficiently standardized to be applied to multicenter clinical trials but could be used in limited-center studies to gain insight into the regulatory effects of different therapeutic modalities.

Rhinomanometry involves the simultaneous measurement of nasal airflow and the pressure required to achieve that flow, from which nasal airway resistance (NAR) can be calculated. Depending on the technique used, this provides either information about each nostril separately (anterior or modified posterior rhinomanometry) or an integrated measure for both nostrils together (posterior rhinomanometry). Nasal peak flow is an indirect index of nasal obstruction, because increasing nasal resistance modifies nasal airflow and hence the peak inspiratory or expiratory nasal airflow achievable. Differences exist in the cost of equipment required for these physiologic measures and their practical applicability for clinical trial purposes.",

            "text": "One of the attractions of nasal peak flow is the simplicity of the method. A mini-Wright peak flow meter, equipped with an airtight face mask instead of a mouthpiece, can be used to measure NPEF. This measure is quick, noninvasive, inexpensive, and relatively easy. The equipment is portable and useful for repeated examinations. During this procedure, patients are instructed to inspire to total lung capacity and, keeping lips tightly closed, to expire with maximal effort through the nose. 6 Maximal flow rate is read from a cursor in liters per minute. A potential drawback to the expiratory peak flow technique is the blowing of mucus into the peak flow meter. 7 Alternatively, NPIF can be measured by using a Youlten peak nasal inspiratory flow meter (an inverted mini-Wright flow meter) attached to an anesthesia mask. During this procedure, the patient places the mask over the nose and mouth, secures an airtight seal around these areas, and inspires forcefully (a vigorous sniff) through the nose, with lips tightly closed. The measurement of NPIF is associated with a small risk of nasal vestibular collapse. If the alar muscles are contracted during maximal inspiration leading to flaring of the nostrils, this counteracts the tendency for vestibular collapse. 1 In a study of patients with allergy, 2% (6 of 327) of NPIF measurements were not obtained because of total occlusion of the nose. 1 Recent mathematical modelling has indicated that nasal wall compliance, in addition to nasal patency, is an important determinant of NP1F. 8 Reproducibility and variation in nasal peak flow Reproducibility in nasal peak flow measurement is dependent on variation resulting from characteristics of the flow meter, variation related to subject technique, and variation caused by changes in airway size and shape that arise because of interindividual differences. Both the mini-Wright and Youlten flow meters are reported to offer highly reproducible results. Proper technique is more difficult with NPIF than NPEF, but most subjects still achieve reproducible values after less than 5 minutes of instruction. 9, 10 Secretions in the mini-Wright meter can influence NPEF readings. Both NPEF and NPIF are effortdependent, and variability of results might come from fatigue or subtle changes in technique. In addition, nasal patency can change quickly. Other factors that can affect NPIF measurements include severe nasal obstruction, poor coordination, alar collapse, and poor inspiratory reserve. 10 Taking the best of 3 readings with less than 10% variation is a more useful result than taking the mean of the 3 maneuvers.",

            "text": "One inherent flaw of nasal peak flow is the failure of this method to account for abnormalities in pulmonary function. 11 Nasal peak flow is dependent on both nasal patency and the ventilatory capacity of the lungs. 1 Lower airway obstruction and a reduced respiratory effort can affect nasal peak flow. Findings from a study by Phagoo et al 12 demonstrated that NPIF and, to a lesser extent, NPEF were altered by changes in intrapulmonary airway dimensions. The authors stated that NPIF and NPEF may give a false impression of nasal patency when effort is submaximal, intrapulmonary dynamic resistance is increased, or nasal dynamic resistance is low. They suggested that false readings could be avoided by comparing mouth peak flow and/or mouth peak inspiratory flow with that of NPIF and NPEF. 12 Similar to peak expiratory flow rate in patients with asthma, there is a diurnal variation in nasal peak flow measurements, with readings lower in the morning and highest at dinner. There are no reported normal values for either NPEF or NPIF, and accordingly, nasal peak flow can be used only as a relative measurement in the same individual over time, although a NIPF of greater than 2.5 L/s has been proposed as being normal. 13 Some investigators have argued that NPIF should not be used to assess a very obstructed nose quantitatively. Gleeson et al 14 found that many patients with marked subjective nasal blockage were unable to obtain NPIF readings greater than 20 (on a scale from 20 to 350 units, which correspond roughly to L/min). Furthermore, a variety of stimuli can acutely influence nasal patency. Exercise and warm air increase patency. Recumbency, pain, cold air, smoking, and hypoventilation decrease patency. Hormonal factors can also influence nasal patency, although small studies in pregnancy and through the normal menstrual cycle have failed to show significant changes in NPIF. 15, 16 Nasal peak expiratory flow can be influenced by a flow meter contaminated from nasal secretions, which is common in individuals with allergy. Subjects must be instructed to evacuate secretions from the nose by sniffing or blowing before taking a measurement. False results occur if the device is not cleaned regularly.",

Twice-daily measurements would be adequate for determining a chronic pharmacologic effect, and measuring nasal peak flow before and 10 minutes after would examine the effects of nasal provocation. The domiciliary use of nasal peak flow meters to monitor objectively the magnitude of nasal obstruction has been found valuable, and the measures have been found to correlate significantly with the severity of symptom reporting. 17 How nasal peak flow relates to other indices of disease: Comparison with rhinomanometry and subjective measures Rhinomanometry provides a well-established, objective, quantitative measure of NAR. Several studies have compared nasal peak flow measurements with rhinomanometry and visual analogue scales in the determination of nasal obstruction with conflicting results. Gleeson et al 14 and Enberg and Ownby 9 found nasal peak flow to be an unreliable measure of nasal obstruction. Clarke et al 18 found nasal peak flow a relatively insensitive measure compared with rhinomanometry. Larsen and Kristensen 19 saw a poor intraindividual correlation. Jones et al 20 and Fairley et al 21 saw a strong correlation with subjective nasal sensation. In addition, Jones et al 20 found a high correlation between NAR, as measured by anterior rhinomanometry, and NPIF and concluded that NPIF was as good an indication of objective nasal patency as NAR measured by rhinomanometry. 20 Holmstrom et al 10 found a good correlation of NPIF with rhinomanometry, and a significant correlation has also been shown between NPIF and forced inspiratory volume in 1 second. 22 Fr\u00f8lund et al 6 studied the relationship between posterior rhinomanometry and NPEF in healthy subjects and patients with rhinitis. A significant correlation was found between posterior rhinomanometry and NPEF when patients were stratified by rhinitis diagnosis and height. The authors concluded that posterior rhinomanometry is an appropriate method for clinic use, and that NPEF is an easy method for measuring nasal patency and may be suitable for home use.",

Its portability allows objective assessment of occupationally induced nasal obstruction. Nasal peak flow can assess the acute effect on nasal blockage before and after dosing with a pharmacologic agent or with a provocative stimulus. It can also assess changes over longer periods. For example, after nasal allergen provocation, nasal peak flow measurements can assess the late phase reaction at home. This technique can establish the effect of corticosteroids on nasal polyposis and can be used for preoperative and postoperative assessment of septoplasty or turbinectomy. Nasal peak flow is also potentially useful in assessing functional nasal problems and for medical legal assessment.",

With this method, nasal airflow is measured from one nostril at a time and the pressure-sensing tube is swapped from one side to the other. Therefore, the pressure/flow curves and nasal resistance or conductance measurements are determined separately for each nasal passage and the total is then calculated. The major disadvantage of the anterior method is that it is impossible to make any measurements if one of the nasal passages is completely obstructed. This is a significant limitation of the anterior rhinomanometric method and a deciding factor in preference for posterior rhinomanometry as a standard technique, because patients with rhinitis often have obstruction of one nasal passage, and it would not be possible to include these patients in any study in which anterior rhinomanometry was the preferred measure of nasal conductance.",

The principal behind this method of measurement is that the size and pattern of the reflections are an indication of the structure and dimensions of the airways, and that the timing of the reflected wave provides information about the distance into the nostril. This method has been applied to the determination of the cross-sectional area as a function of distance into the nasal airways. The technique assumes 1-dimensional sound propagation and the lack of cross-mode waveforms. The devices and the frequency of sound used are designed to facilitate these requirements, and technologic developments in microcomputers have enabled the sampling, storage, and interpretation of the sound reflections. The conversion of the echo measurements to derive a measure of nasal volume requires complicated mathematical transformation 71 in addition to several theoretical assumptions. [71] [72] [73] [74] However, the validity of acoustic rhinometry has been proven by comparison of measures by this technique with those obtained by imaging, such as with computerized tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging scanning. [74] [75] [76] Studies have indicated that measurements as far as 6 cm from the entrance to the nostril are accurate, but that beyond this distance, access of air to the maxillary sinuses through the ostiomeatal complex distorts the information from the reflected sound, at least in the decongested nose, and leads to inaccuracies in measurement. [77] [78] [79] Measures are thus usually made from 0 to 5 cm into the nostrils. In the congested nose, there is a less good correlation between CT scan evaluation of the nasal air passage dimensions and those obtained with acoustic rhinometry. 78 This is predominantly because of sound distortion in the posterior end of the nasal cavity, whereas anteriorly good agreement is evident. In addition to measuring nasal volume, for a set distance into the nostril, acoustic rhinometry standardly also provides information relating to the minimal cross-sectional area within the nose (a-min). This is usually at the level of the nasal valve, but in the congested nose, it can be at the anterior tip of the inferior turbinate.",

For measurement, the patient sits in the upright position, clears their nose of secretions, and places the disposable nosepiece attached to the end of the acoustic rhinometry tube into a nostril. Different size nosepieces are available and should fit comfortably but firmly into the external nares to ensure an airtight seal. In some instances, it may be necessary to apply a proprietary soft paraffin wax to ensure an airtight seal. Measurements are made separately for each nostril. It is suggested that subjects keep their eyes focused on a point marked on a wall to keep the same head position during repeated measurements. Studies have evaluated the use of a head frame to fix the head rigidly in a set position, but this approach has not been found to provide better results 80 ; rather paradoxically, the results have been reported to be less repeatable under such circumstances. However, the angle of the rhinometry tube is important, because the axis at which the sound travels in the nasal cavity should be parallel to the nasal floor from the nasal valve, and alterations influence the measurement. 81, 82 Measurements are made during breath holding, as the area-distance function may be affected by breathing. 83 The measurements are passive and require no other cooperation from the patient.",

Thus, for repeated measures on separate days as part of a drug intervention study, measures should be undertaken at the same time of day. Because a classic nasal cycle is associated with alternating congestion/decongestion cycles matched by the opposite in the other nostril, the sum of the 2 sides is usually constant. In contrast with measures of nasal airflow, which have indicated that such reciprocating cycles occur in as many as 80% of subjects, 87 acoustic rhinometry measures of nasal volume have revealed such changes in only 25% to 50% of subjects. 75, 88, 89 In one small study of 12 subjects without allergy, repeated measurements of nasal volume, minimal cross-sectional area, and the area of the anterior end of the inferior turbinate every 15 minutes for 6 hours revealed a coefficient of variation of 9.4%, 11.3%, and 17.8%, respectively. 90 The variability was significantly larger in subjects with allergy, with a coefficient of variation for the nasal volume measurement of 14%. 90 Factors other than allergic disease that may influence intersubject variability or baseline measurements are race and height. [91] [92] [93] In a study of 106 subjects with a range of racial origins in North America, there were racial differences between white, Asian, and black noses. 92 Another study has reported no difference between Anglo-Saxon and Indian noses. 93 In a Swedish study of 334 healthy individuals, a weak correlation was found between the minimal cross-sectional area, as measured by acoustic rhinometry, and weight, height, age, and body mass index. 94 A correlation has been found between the dimensions of the external nose and the minimal crosssectional area. 95 Because acoustic rhinometry measures internal nasal cavity dimensions, any structural alterations, independent of mucosal swelling, such as those related to a deviated nasal septum, will influence nasal cavity measures. Changes resulting from mucosal swelling will be modified by a nasal decongestant, whereas those related to structural airway abnormalities will not.",

[74] [75] [76] [77] [78] [79] As discussed, in the decongested nose, these provide very comparable measurements, particularly within the anterior part of the nasal cavity. 77, 78 Acoustic rhinometry obviously has considerable advantage over these other methods of measurement in being considerably less expensive, easy to conduct, rapid to perform, and without radiation risk. Studies have also compared changes in acoustic rhinometry measures after intranasal challenge with measures of nasal airflow, such as rhinomanometry and nasal peak flow. 82, 97, 98, [104] [105] [106] [107] [108] Although studies have found minor variations, in general the information gained by the different techniques is very comparable, with nasal congestion leading to a decrease in nasal volume and a-min in association with a reduction in nasal inspiratory peak flow and an increase in NAR (Fig 4) . Acoustic rhinometry is noted to be user-friendly. 97, 98 Similarly, improvements can be seen with all methods of measurement with nasal decongestants that increase nasal volume and improve nasal airflow. 82, 109 One study found acoustic rhinometry to be more sensitive then rhinomanometry. 110 Theoretically, acoustic rhinomanometry and rhinomanometry may provide complimentary but slightly different information, because the resistance of a cross-sectional area may differ considerably depending on the shape, despite a constant area. 107, 111 In practice, however, under challenge situations in which large changes are induced, the methods are very comparable, and changes relate to the subjective sensation of induced nasal obstruction. 112 Under clinical circumstances, however, there is a poor correlation between the subjective scoring of nasal congestion and measures both by acoustic rhinometry and rhinomanometry. 102, 103 Changes in nasal cavity size after intranasal allergen challenge do not relate to measures of nitric oxide, and at rest, the concentration of nasal nitric oxide is independent of measures of nasal cavity volume. 113, 114 Both these findings suggest that nitric oxide per se is not a major determinant of nasal cavity dimensions. One study in patients with coronavirus-induced common cold identified a correlation between changes in olfaction and changes in nasal dimensions, as assessed by acoustic rhinometry. 115 It is probable, however, that this relationship is purely a reflection of the viral infection affecting 2 separate variables, because studies with nasal decongestants in the common cold have dissociated these measures. 116, 117 Decongestants improve nasal dimensions but have no effect on olfaction. Similarly, no significant correlation has been found between olfaction and nasal patency after nasal allergen challenge. 118 ",

The overall function of the mucociliary clearance system within the nose may be measured by recording the transport rate of particles. Measurement of mucociliary clearance thus potentially provides an overall integrated measurement of cilial function and allows assessment of the net effect of disease processes, such as those associated with allergic inflammation. Important information may also be obtained by analyzing the characteristics of the cilia and the secretions. However, these additional measurements will not be further evaluated.",

The transport rate of radioactive particles can be calculated by following them over a certain distance for a certain period. 119 The saccharin test is most frequently used for screening purposes, because it is easy to perform both for the investigated and the investigator.

There may also be regional differences in clearance velocity within the same nostril. Some individuals have a rapid clearance rate, whereas others are slow clearers.

Other endogenous confounding factors are age, 127 sex, 128 posture, 129 exercise, 130 and sleep, 131 as well as neurotransmitters and neurohormones. 122 The effect of exogenous factors on mucociliary clearance, such as environmental pollution from tobacco smoke, car exhaust fumes, and the burning of fossil fuel, have also been evaluated. The results from studies of the effect of acute exposure to tobacco smoke on the mucociliary system are inconsistent. Consequently, it appears that there are individual variations in the mucosal tolerance to toxins such as tobacco smoke. 132, 133 The functional consequences of sulfur dioxide, nitrogen dioxide, and ozone on the respiratory epithelium are controversial.

Whether these alterations favor the overall mucociliary clearance is a matter for further studies. 119, 140 Influence of nasal therapy on mucociliary clearance Consistent with the variability of assessments of mucociliary clearance, there are no clear results in this outcome measure. Nasal steroids have been found to improve measures, 141 to have no effect, 142 and to be no different to antihistamines. 143 Oral and intranasal antihistamines have not been found to influence mucociliary clearance, 144, 145 and no effect has been seen with the leukotriene receptor antagonist zafirlukast, even though this treatment reduced the nasal lavage eosinophil count significantly. 146 Concern has been raised about whether mucociliary function may be adversely influenced by components of medication. Both in vitro and in vivo studies have shown that that a preservative frequently used in topical nasal drugs, benzalkonium chloride, may structurally and functionally affect both the cilia and the mucosa from which they originate. The clinical consequences of this have been a matter of debate, 147,148 although a recent review of the literature concluded that products containing the preservative benzalkonium chloride appear to be safe and well tolerated. 149 ",

On the basis of convention, immunologic responses are excluded. Reactions of the nasal mucosa to such stimuli should be considered part of the protective function of the nose that is meant to benefit the entire respiratory tract. For example, cold air induces significant water loss, especially under conditions of hyperventilation. To preserve homeostasis and avoid mucosal desiccation and damage, water is being constantly replenished by passive transfer through the paracellular spaces of the nasal airway epithelium. When the water loss is excessive, hypertonicity develops and sensory nerves are activated to induce glandular secretions through a reflex mechanism. The large amounts of water in these secretions compensate for the loss. Similarly, the nose will react with sneezing, glandular secretions, and vascular engorgement (congestion) against chemical irritants or against inhaled particles. The nasal obstruction protects the nasal mucosa by limiting the access of the stimulus.",

It is important to realize, however, that the nasal mucosa comprises several functional elements, including sensory and effector nerves, submucosal glands, respiratory epithelium, goblet cells, subepithelial capillaries, capacitance vessels, and so forth, all of which are regulated by distinct mechanisms and have a certain degree of independence. Nasal symptoms are produced by the activity of 1 or more of these elements. For example, sneezing is produced by activation of nasal sensory nerves or by sensory nerves at a distant part of the body. Rhinorrhea, on the other hand, requires activation of the glandular apparatus, which may occur directly by a chemical stimulus or, most commonly, through cholinergic activation, via a central reflex. In the latter case, several elements of the mucosa are involved, namely sensory nerves, cholinergic effector nerves, and submucosal glands. Nasal symptoms do not always occur in concordance and, depending on the patient or the condition, different nasal symptoms may predominate. Allergic rhinitis characteristically involves sneezing and pruritus, something that is rather rare in patients with nonallergic rhinopathies. 151 Also, clinical observations have suggested that patients with rhinitis can be separated into sneezers, runners, or blockers on the basis of the predominance of the respective symptom. 155 Given this complexity, one has to attempt to define hyperresponsiveness as an attribute of a specific functional element of the nasal mucosa and not as a global condition. The terms sensorineural hyperresponsiveness, glandular hyperresponsiveness, and so forth should therefore be used. The problem arises as to which tests-that is, which stimuli-can reliably offer information on the responsiveness of specific functional elements of the nose. Unfortunately, only a few stimuli with single specificity for a particular functional element have been identified.",

These can include mucus glycoproteins (which are very difficult to measure), the content of fucose (a characteristic sugar of the mucus glycoproteins), lysozyme, or lactoferrin (serous cell products). 159 Is there evidence of nasal hyperresponsiveness to methacholine-that is, of nasal glandular hyperresponsiveness? Several publications support the notion that such a form of nasal hyperresponsiveness does indeed exist. [160] [161] [162] [163] [164] There is also some evidence that nasal provocation with allergen can increase nasal responsiveness to methacholine. 165 Unfortunately, not all studies reproduce these findings. One study examined the effect of methacholine applied to the septal mucosa through filter paper discs in patients with perennial allergic rhinitis who were distinguishable from healthy controls when other tests for hyperresponsiveness were applied. There was no difference between the groups, 166 and no good explanation for this discrepancy was apparent.",

Capsaicin stimulates a specific vanilloid receptor 167,168 on sensory nerve endings to induce a central reflex with its efferent arm leading to cholinergic glandular activation. 168, 169 Capsaicin induces a strong burning sensation but only induces sneezing at very low doses. In addition to the generation of neural reflexes, capsaicin can result in local release of neuropeptides by sensory nerve endings. These peptides can also stimulate glands and may induce plasma exudation from adjacent blood vessels. In the human nose, high doses of capsaicin may yield evidence of plasma exudation, but only in patients with active allergic rhinitis. 170 Despite this, it is difficult to define rhinitis by capsaicin provocation because of a considerable variability in response, and intranasal challenge cannot identify a particular type of nasal hyperresponsiveness. On the other hand, the ipsilateral and contralateral nostril secretory response to unilateral capsaicin provocation using the filter paper technique allows for a clear differentiation between healthy subjects and patients with active allergic rhinitis, with the ED 50 100-fold lower in the latter. 171 Histamine. Very little controversy exists about the ability of histamine to differentiate between active allergic rhinitis and the healthy state. 161, 163, [171] [172] [173] [174] [175] In addition, hyperresponsiveness to histamine has been convincingly demonstrated to occur after experimental nasal allergen provocation and to be inhibited by nasal corticosteroids, linking this phenomenon to allergic inflammation. 154, 172, 176, 177 Most impressively, nasal responsiveness to histamine, with symptoms as the outcome, was found to correlate moderately well with clinical indices of perennial allergic rhinitis (PAR), such as daily symptom scores and the score from the rhinitis quality of life questionnaire. 178 Histamine is by far the most commonly used stimulus in studies assessing nasal hyperresponsiveness. Histamine has multiple effects on the nasal mucosa. It induces sensory nerve activation leading to sneezing, pruritus, cholinergically mediated glandular secretions, and possibly even reflex vasodilation, which may be a cholinergic effect. In addition, histamine has a direct effect on the vasculature leading to vasodilation of the capacitance vessels and plasma exudation from the postcapillary venules of the subepithelial plexus. It is not clear whether histamine can directly activate the nasal glandular apparatus. 179 Despite the complicated effects of histamine on the nasal mucosa, the methodology of the provocation permits differentiation of various aspects of nasal hyperresponsiveness. First, histamine-induced sneezing is a quite clean outcome, reflecting sensory neural function, and can be used to assess sensorineural hyperresponsiveness. Second, evaluation of the content of histamine-induced nasal secretions in markers of plasma extravasation can be used as a measure of vascular hyperpermeability, a form of nasal hyperresponsiveness.",

In this respect, bradykinin does not appear to differentiate patients with active allergic rhinitis from healthy controls. 181 However, in a study by Riccio and Proud, 181 healthy subjects or patients with SAR, when tested out of the pollen season, generate minimal secretory responses to bradykinin and no sneezing. In contrast, both ipsilateral and contralateral secretions to unilateral, localized bradykinin provocation, as well as sneezes, are induced in patients with PAR and in those with symptomatic seasonal disease. This indicates that, in the presence of active allergic disease, a sensorineural response to bradykinin is induced. However, there are some discrepancies between this study and a study reported by Baraniuk et al. 182 Thus, more work with bradykinin in the nose will be required to obtain a more concrete impression of its potential usefulness as a tool to examine specific forms of nasal hyperresponsiveness. Studies on the effects of antiinflammatory agents on hyperresponsiveness to bradykinin have not been performed. Neither do we know whether experimental allergen provocation can change as well as augment the qualitative characteristics of the responsiveness to bradykinin. However, it is worth mentioning that, in the lower airways of patients with asthma, responsiveness to bradykinin increases dramatically 24 to 48 hours after allergen inhalation challenge, much more so than the responsiveness to methacholine. 183 Inversely, bronchial responsiveness to bradykinin can be dramatically reduced with inhaled glucocorticosteroids. 184 Other pharmacologic and biochemical stimuli. Other products of the nasal allergic reaction could turn out to be useful in assessing nasal hyperresponsiveness. These include the sulfidopeptide leukotrienes, prostaglandin D 2 , platelet-activating factor, and so forth. There is very limited experience, however, with nasal provocations involving these agents. Also, other endogenous substances that are capable of inducing nasal symptoms but have not been clearly associated with allergic reactions should be considered, including serotonin, endothelin, and neuropeptides such as substance P or neurokinin A.

            "text": "Nasal symptoms can be produced by physical stimuli. The most common and well-characterized physical stimulus is cold, dry air and, associated with that, hyperosmolar solutions. Many individuals complain of nasal symptoms on exposure to cold, windy conditions, particularly during winter skiing, a phenomenon termed skier's nose. 185 Cold, dry air nasal challenges have been performed in the laboratory, and nasal responsiveness to this stimulus has been well characterized. [186] [187] [188] [189] [190] [191] Although many individuals without allergy have a specific sensitivity to cold, dry air, which is not associated with any other kind of nasal dysfunction, patients with active allergic rhinitis respond more vigorously to this stimulus compared with healthy subjects. 189 Furthermore, patients with allergic rhinitis and asthma have stronger nasal reactivity to nasal challenge with cold, dry air compared with patients with allergic rhinitis alone. 192 Finally, nasal allergen provocation augments the nasal reaction to cold, dry air. 193 Interestingly, cold, dry air has been shown to differentiate patients with nonallergic, noninfectious perennial rhinitis from healthy subjects with higher sensitivity than histamine. 194 Although the exact mechanism through which cold, dry air induces a nasal reaction is not known, available data support the concept that this is primarily a sensorineural reaction initiated by increased tonicity (osmolarity) of the nasal surface, which is in turn induced by excessive water loss. 195 The main outcome of the reaction, however, is glandular activation. 196 In accordance with the theories regarding the mechanism of nasal reaction to cold, dry air, various forms of nasal challenges with hyperosmolar solutions have been developed. 55, 197, 198 The outcomes from these provocations support the concept that hyperosmolarity and cold, dry air share common pathways. 195 As with cold, dry air, hyperosmolar challenges reveal stronger nasal responsiveness in patients with PAR compared with healthy controls. 55 Studies in healthy volunteers have shown that intranasal hypertonic saline enhances the exudative and secretary effects of histamine and methacholine respectively. 199 Shusterman and Balmes 200 and Shusterman et al 201 have developed a methodology to stimulate the nose with chlorine gas and with carbon dioxide. These stimuli are quite relevant to daily environmental exposures, and nasal responsiveness assessed through such methodologies has direct clinical implications. These studies have so far demonstrated that patients with SAR, even when tested outside the pollen season, develop nasal airflow limitation on exposure to chlorine gas with lower threshold, compared with healthy controls.",

            "text": "The methodologies through which nasal provocations are performed to assess hyperresponsiveness can be largely categorized into 3 groups: whole-nose challenges, localized challenges, and environmental exposures. In the last case, provocations are performed either inside environmental chambers or with equipment designed to deliver gases into the nasal passages via face masks. 186, 201 Whole-nose challenges are usually performed with the use of a metered pump spray that delivers a known amount of stimulus into the mucosa. A large airway surface can be reached in this fashion. Objective outcomes from such provocations can be obtained with evaluations of airflow, blowing of secretions, or nasal lavage. Nasal lavage offers the advantage of collecting large volumes of secretions and performing extensive evaluations. 202 The localized provocations are performed by using filter paper discs or strips impregnated with the chemical stimulant that can be introduced into one nostril and left in contact with the septal or the inferior turbinate mucosa for a specific period. 158 Secretory outcomes can be assessed by introducing preweighed dry discs or strips, of the same size as those used for stimulation, onto the same mucosal areas. Secretions induced by the stimulus are absorbed by the filter paper, and the change in the weight of these collection discs is a reliable marker of the secretory response. Collected secretions can be eluted from the filter paper, and limited biochemical evaluations can be performed. The major advantage of the localized challenge technique is that it allows secretions to be collected from both the ipsilateral and the contralateral side to the unilateral provocation. Thus, neurally mediated outcomes involving central reflexes can be assessed.",

Unfortunately, questions are consistently raised regarding the reliability of symptom scales or other subjective measures such as quality of life, which are associated with impressive placebo effects.

The problem with this approach is that nasal airflow limitation is only 1 of several nasal symptoms, and not all patients with allergic rhinitis report congestion as a major complaint. Furthermore, nasal symptomatology is frequently episodic, and daily measurements of airflow may not track the natural presentation of the disease. By assessing nasal hyperresponsiveness, one can obtain a better picture of the propensity of a patient to develop symptoms in response to frequently encountered environmental stimuli. Most importantly, if measures of nasal hyperresponsiveness are performed by using methodologies that can dissect the various functions of the nose, as discussed, various clinical phenotypes and their response to treatment could be correlated to a particular aspect of hyperresponsiveness in a patient-tailored fashion. Unfortunately, the lack of standardization and validation of methodologies to assess nasal hyperresponsiveness means that only scattered data are available on the effects of therapeutic agents, and, even worse, none from large-scale clinical trials.",

            "text": "Objective measures exist for the measurement of nasal patency. Nasal peak flow is an inexpensive, noninvasive, portable, and relatively simple measure that reflects changes in nasal luminal patency. Nasal peak flow is the only validated method suitable for home use, and studies have demonstrated that, when used correctly, the method is reproducible, correlates with both subjective and other objective measures, and may therefore provide a viable method for the outpatient monitoring of nasal patency. NPIF has better reproducibility than NPEF and is the best validated and studied nasal peak flow measurement. Such use would be most appropriate in persistent rather than intermittent disease, because measurement at set times of the day may not reflect episodic events. Within the laboratory, rhinomanometry is the standard technique used for the measurement of nasal resistance, and measurements are relatively easy and are reproducible. This approach is thus commonly used in nasal challenge studies. Such measures are more discerning than those of peak flow. The equipment is not portable and thus not available for home monitoring. The instability of nasal resistance means that only relatively large changes in resistance can be studied in clinical trials, when occasional clinic visit measurements are made, but despite this, such measurements have been able to demonstrate the efficacy of medications such as nasal steroids in allergic rhinitis. A nonphysiologic measure of nasal patency is acoustic rhinometry. Using sound waves and their echo reflection, this technique measures intranasal volume and a-min within the nose. This method of measurement correlates well with rhinomanometry and NPIF and is easy to undertake. Acoustic rhinometry has advantages in that it needs little patient cooperation in the measurements and is a repeatable method of measurement. Measures of nasal patency, although they provide objective outcome measures, reflect only 1 aspect of rhinitis and may thus not encompass all aspects of the disease. It is recognized that there may be altered mucociliary clearance and abnormal nasal airway reactivity in rhinitis. Measures of mucociliary clearance, although simple and easily applicable clinically, are poorly repeatable. To provide a more integrated measure of abnormal nasal airway physiology, nasal challenge testing to measure nasal reactivity has been used.",

However, hyperresponsiveness is a very complex phenomenon that involves a range of potential abnormalities in the various functional elements of the nasal mucosa. Standardized methodologies assessing these abnormalities are not sufficiently developed, and the relationship between such abnormalities and disease presentation has not been vigorously examined.
