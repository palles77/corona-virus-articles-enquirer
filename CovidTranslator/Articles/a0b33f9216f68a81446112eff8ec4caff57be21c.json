The mechanism of action of Ag nanoparticles as an antiviral agent has been studied against several enveloped viruses. It is suggested that nanoparticles bind with a viral envelope glycoprotein and inhibit the virus by binding to the disulfide bond regions of the cluster of differentiation 4 (CD4) binding domain within the human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV-1) viral envelope glycoprotein gp120 [30, 31] . Moreover, it is reported that silver nanoparticles have high binding affinity for the hepatitis B virus (HBV) DNA and extracellular virions with different sized Ag nanoparticles, and can inhibit the production of HBV RNA and extracellular virions [32] . It is generally understood that Ag ions and Ag nanoparticles inactivate viruses by denaturing enzymes by reactions with sulfhydra, amino, carboxyl, phosphate, and imidazole groups [33] [34] [35] [36] [37] .",

A following study presented a large scale fabrication of monodisperse silica hybrid particles (without magnetic core) decorated with Ag nanoparticles and their prompt antibacterial activity against both Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria on air filtration [27] . In those studies, the silica hybrid particles, whether they contained a magnetic Fe 3 O 4 core or not, were functionalized with aminopropyl (AP) groups and the AP groups were used as a dispersive supporter for aggregation control in an aqueous solution and also, as a post to decorate Ag nanoparticles. Oxidation of the decorated Ag nanoparticles was negligibly minimal and their integral hybrid structure was conserved even after 8 months, as far as their concentration had been kept higher than 1.3% in aqueous media. Moreover, surface-oxidized Ag nanoparticles on silica still exhibited a promising antibacterial activity both in water and air [27] .",

Filtration efficiencies of fabricated air filters for various coating areal densities and media velocities are shown in Fig. 6 . The filtration efficiency increased with decreasing media velocity for a given coating areal density. It is well known that the filtration mechanism for nanoparticles at the tens-of-nanometer scale is dominated by diffusional motion of the particles. It is well known that the filtration efficiency due to Brownian diffusion increases with decreasing media velocity for a given particle size [47] . The experimental results shown in Fig. 6 follow this tendency. Moreover, Fig. 6 shows that the filtration efficiency increased with increasing coating areal density for a given media velocity. In previous research, the filtration efficiency of a particle-loaded filter was suggested as follows [48] , where P 0 is the penetration of the particle unloaded filter, depending on the media velocity. \u02c7 is a constant representing filter performance, which depends on the filter material.

The first issue is about the ratio of the number of virus particles deposited on the filter to the SA particles in the filter. As shown in Fig. 7 , the overall anti-viral efficiency was strongly influenced by the amount of SA particles coated in a filter. Note that each data point was determined with Eq. (13) and plaque counting was performed for a filter after the filter was continuously deposited by the aerosolized virus particles for 30 min. However, for virus deposition times other than 30 min, different antiviral efficiencies would be obtained. If the deposition time increases, the ratio of the number of virus particles to SA particles will increase, implying that the amount of SA particles would not be enough for antiviral action against the virus particles. The second issue is about the fact that the filtration efficiency increased with the coating areal density. As shown in Fig. 6 , the filtration efficiency was a function of coating areal density, thus, the amount of deposited virus particles increased with coating areal density for a given virus deposition time.",

Since pressure drop is related to energy expenditure in filtration, the quotient of the logarithm of the penetration and the pressure drop is a measure of the performance achieved against the energy expended. This quotient is called the quality factor. Therefore, the quality factor is used as a useful criterion for comparing different filters of different thickness.

The overall anti-viral quality factor (q antiviral ) also decreased with increasing media velocity (Fig. 9b) . With increasing of coating areal density,q antiviral increased for a given media velocity until the efficiency reached its maximum value (99.9%), but gradually decreased, since the pressure drop continuously increased while the anti-viral efficiency ( \u00c1 antiviral ) was maintained at a maximum.

Moreover, with a higher coating areal density, q antiviral (t) gradually decreased. By comparing these quality factors, it can be concluded that coating SA particles on a filter does not lead to a significant effect on the filtration quality, and there is an optimal coating areal density to obtain the highest anti-viral quality.
