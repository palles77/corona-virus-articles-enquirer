Selective reduction of ketoprofen produced hydroxy derivative 2, which in the reaction with one or two moles of 1-benzotriazole carboxylic acid chloride (1) gave benzotriazole derivatives 3a and 3b, respectively. Compounds 3a and 3b with various amines afforded amidocarbamates 4a-j. Antioxidative screenings revealed that the prepared compounds 3b and 4a-j possess excellent lipid peroxidation inhibition at 0.1 mM concentration, higher than 95% for the derivatives bearing aromatic, cycloalkyl or heterocyclic substituents. Two of the compounds, 3b and 4g, also show high soybean lipoxygenase inhibition activity (95 and 83.5%, respectively). On the other hand, the amidocarbamate derivatives of ketoprofen show only weak reducing activity against 1,1diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl radicals. No selective antiviral effects were noted for the tested compounds against a broad variety of DNA and RNA viruses. Most compounds were endowed with a moderate (IC 50 : 10-25 lM) cytostatic activity.",

            "text": "Ketoprofen (Ket) is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) with pronounced analgesic and antipyretic properties. Numerous ketoprofen derivatives have been synthesized in order to minimize side-effects, prolong plasma half-life and increase solubility (Bonina et al., 2002a (Bonina et al., , b, 2003 . Some amides have proved to be useful prodrugs, while the others possess anti-inflammatory activity independent of the parent compound. It has been demonstrated that amidation of NSAIDs improves selectivity towards COX-2 (Kalgutkar et al., 2000) , while modification of the carboxylic group to hydroxamic acid leads to inhibition of both cyclooxygenase and 5-lipoxygenase, two enzymes crucial in inflammatory processes (Flynn et al., 1990; Muri et al., 2002) . Glycine amides of ketoprofen and several other well-known NSAIDs are significantly less irritating to gastric mucosa, while their anti-inflammatory activities are comparable to their parent drugs (Shanbhag et al., 1992; Singh et al., 1990) . Ketoprofen glycinate methyl ester has higher anti-inflammatory and analgesic activity than the parent drug (Dhaneshwar and Chaturvedi, 1994) . Ketoprofenamides with heterocyclic residues (2-thiazolinyl, 4-methylpyridyl, 3-hydroxypyridyl, pyridyl, 1,5-dimethyl-2-phenylpyrazolonyl or thiazolyl) also possess significant analgesic and antiinflammatory activities (Spickett et al., 1976) , while ketoprofen 2-hydroxyethylamide and ketoprofen esters with bis-(hydroxyalkylthio)-alkanes are useful in the treatment and prevention of atherosclerosis (Lafon, 1977) .",

Lipoxygenases oxidize certain fatty acids at specific positions to hydroperoxides, precursors of leukotrienes, which contain a conjugated triene structure, i.e. soybean lipoxygenase converts linoleic to 13-hydroperoxylinoleic acid. Leukotrienes play an important role as mediators of a variety of inflammatory and allergic processes (K\u00fchn et al., 1990) . Inhibitors of LOX have attracted attention initially as potential agents for the treatment of inflammatory and allergic diseases but their therapeutic potential has now been expanded to certain types of cancer and cardiovascular diseases (Pontiki and Hadjipavlou-Litina, 2005) . Most of the LOX inhibitors are antioxidants or free radical scavengers, since lipoxygenation occurs via a carbon-centred radical (Muller, 1994) . Perusal of IC 50 values shows that compound 3b is the most active by far, followed by compounds 4g, 4d and 4f (IC 50 = 21-95 lM).

The water soluble azo compound 2,2 0 -azobis(2-amidinopropane) dihydrochloride (AAPH) has been extensively used as a clean and controllable source of thermally produced alkylperoxyl free radicals. In our studies, AAPH was used as a free radical initiator to follow oxidative changes of linoleic acid to conjugated diene hydroperoxide. The results indicated that all the compounds are excellent inhibitors of lipid peroxidation (LP) (54.5-99.5%), significantly higher than (17), 153,87 (1), 143.37, 142.06, 141.64 (4, 8, 11), 129.25, 128.90, 127.99, 127.08, 126.87, 126.66, 125.36, 125.16, 124.64 (5-7, 9, 12-16) , 77.28 (10) (Table 2) . This inhibition was found to be concentration dependent. Regression analysis of the LP inhibition at 100 lM revealed that the overall molar refractivity (CMR) is the main physicochemical parameter influencing the inhibition. The linear CMR model suggests that the compounds with high CMR value will be more active. No correlation for lipophilicity was found.",

Only 4g showed minor antiviral activity against vesicular stomatitis virus in HeLa cell cultures (EC 50 : 3 lM), Sindbis virus (EC 50 : 11 lM) and Punta Toro virus in Vero cell cultures (EC 50 : 11 lM). However, the activity was found at compound concentrations close to their cytostatic activities (CC 50 : 2.7-14 lM) (Table 3) , pointing to a toxic rather than a specific antiviral effect. The compounds have also been evaluated for their cytostatic activity against murine leukaemia L1210, murine mammary carcinoma FM3A and human T-lymphoblast CEM cell cultures. The 50% inhibitory concentrations of the test compounds ranked between 2.7 and 422 lM depending on the nature of the compound and the tumour cell line evaluated (Table 3 ).

After incubation at 37\u00b0C for 2 (L1210, FM3A) or 3 (CEM) days, the cell number was determined using a Coulter counter. The IC 50 was defined as the compound concentration required to inhibit cell proliferation by 50%. The antiviral assays, other than the anti-HIV assays, were based on inhibition of virus-induced cytopathicity in HEL [herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) (KOS), HSV-2 (G), vaccinia virus and vesicular stomatitis virus], Vero (parainfluenza-3, reovirus-1, Sindbis, Coxsackie B4, and Punta Toro virus), HeLa (vesicular stomatitis virus, Coxsackie virus B4, and respiratory syncytial virus), feline kidney Crandell cells [feline coronavirus (FeCoV)] (FIPV strain) and feline herpes virus (FeHV) or MDCK [influenza A (H1N1, H3N2) and influenza B] cell cultures. Most viruses have been obtained from ATCC (Rockville, MD). HIV-1(III B ) was provided by R. C. Gallo (at that time at NIH, Bethesda, MD) and HIV-2(ROD) was provided by L. Montagnier (at that time at the Pasteur Institute, Paris, France). FCoV (FIPV) and FeHV were kindly provided by H. Egberink, Utrecht, The Netherlands. Confluent cell cultures in microtiter 96-well plates were inoculated with 100 CCID50 of virus (CCID50 being the virus dose to infect 50% of the cell cultures). After a 1 h virus adsorption period, residual virus was removed, and the cell cultures were incubated in the presence of varying concentrations (200, 40, 8, \u2026 lM) of the test compounds. Viral cytopathicity was recorded as soon as it reached completion in the control virus infected cell cultures that were not treated with the test compounds. The methodology of the anti-HIV assays was as follows: human CEM (*3 9 10 5 cells/ml) cells were infected with 100 CCID50 of HIV-1(IIIB) or HIV-2(ROD)/ml and seeded in 200 ll wells of a microtiter plate containing appropriate dilutions of the test compounds. After 4 days of incubation at 37\u00b0C, HIV-induced CEM giant cell formation was examined microscopically.",
