RNA interference (RNAi) therapy, which silences expression of specific target genes, represents a promising approach for treating viral infections in mammalian hosts. We designed six small interfering (si)RNAs (N473, N580, N783, N796, N799 and N1227) that target the conserved region of the RABV challenge virus standard (CVS)-11 strain nucleoprotein (N) gene. Using a plasmid-based transient expression model, we demonstrated that N796, N580 and N799 were capable of significantly inhibiting viral replication in vitro and in vivo. These three siRNAs effectively suppressed RABV expression in infected baby hamster kidney-21 (BHK-21) cells, as evidenced by direct immunofluorescence assay, viral titer measurements, real-time PCR, and Western blotting. In addition, liposome-mediated siRNA expression plasmid delivery to RABV-infected mice significantly increased survival, compared to a nonliposome-mediated delivery method. Collectively, our results showed that the three siRNAs, N796, N580 and N799, targeting the N gene could potently inhibit RABV CVS-11 reproduction. These siRNAs have the potential to be developed into new and effective prophylactic anti-RABV drugs.",

Affecting both animals and humans, rabies cases are reported worldwide but are most prevalent in undeveloped countries, specifically in rural areas of Africa and Asia. No definitive treatment exists to cure the disease once the clinical stage has been reached, and only a small portion of clinical cases responds to intensive therapeutic management and survives (Willoughby et al., 2005) . Thus, the current strategy to control rabies is pre-exposure prophylaxis by vaccine injection, but research efforts are focused on developing an effective antiviral strategy against established RABV infection.",

            "text": "RNA interference (RNAi) is considered one of the most promising methods to achieve antiviral defense against RABV. The RNAi therapeutic approach is based on the ability of double-stranded small interfering (si)RNAs to specifically trigger mRNA degradation without causing significant cytotoxicity. siRNA-mediated gene silencing occurs through the activities of the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC), a ubiquitous cytoplasmic protein complex that harbors dsRNA-binding domains and an exonuclease domain. The RNAi approach has already been successfully applied to several human pathogenic viruses, including hepatitis B virus (HBV) (Morrissey et al., 2005; Song et al., 2003) , dengue virus (DNV) (Padwad et al., 2009 ), human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) (Boden et al., 2004; Kumar et al., 2008) , poliovirus (Saleh et al., 2004) , hepatitis C virus (Lupberger et al., 2008) , human papilloma virus (Niu et al., 2006) , respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) (Bitko et al., 2005) , severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus (Li et al., 2005) , and influenza virus (Zhang et al., 2009 ). In addition, several researchers have investigated the potential of RNAi to treat RABV infections. Brandao et al. demonstrated that siRNA designed against the rabies virus nucleoprotein (N) mRNA was able to partially protect cultured cells (baby hamster kidney (BHK)-21) from rabies virus infection, as evidenced by direct fluorescent antibody test (Brandao et al., 2007) ; however, no other in vitro assays or in vivo data was provided to support the siRNA inhibitory effect. More recently, Gupta et al. and Sonwane et al. reported that adenoviral vector-mediated delivery of small hairpin (sh)RNAs targeting the RABV N or polymerase (L) mRNA led to a slight increase in survival of RABV-infected mice (Gupta et al., 2011; Sonwane et al., 2011) .",

For example, the viral vectors randomly integrate their vector DNA into the host chromosome. In addition, the vector itself may be immunogenic, cytotoxic, or have specific tissue tropism. There is also a possibility of the vector virus recombining with the wildtype viruses, generating a potentially virulent or toxic pathogen. Thus, researchers in gene therapy have turned to non-viral gene delivery systems in the hopes of creating a safe and effective delivery system. To date, the cationic lipids have proven to be one of the most efficient non-viral gene transfer methods. These amphiphilic molecules possess two elements that are crucial for gene delivery: a cationic head group that condenses DNA and a lipid moiety that acts as a fusogenic group to enhance penetration into cells.",

            "text": "Since an effective treatment for clinical rabies has yet to be developed (Hemachudha et al., 2006) , RNAi is considered a promising therapeutic strategy. The RABV genome consists of a single negative-stranded RNA molecule of about 12 kb that encodes five viral proteins, in the order of 3 -N-P-M-G-L-5 . RNA transcription and RABV replication requires an intricate interplay between the nucleoprotein N, the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) L, the nonenzymatic polymerase cofactor P, and the RNA genome enwrapped by N, which is also known as the RABV nucleocapsid (N-RNA). The N-RNA complex acts as the template for the viral polymerase. During mRNA synthesis, the P and L complex bind to the N-RNA template through an N-P interaction that involves two adjacent N proteins in the nucleocapsid. The L-P binding to the N-RNA is believed to trigger conformational changes that allow the polymerase to access the RNA (Albertini et al., 2008 (Albertini et al., , 2011 . The N, P and L proteins are thus important factors for both viral transcription and replication; therefore, they are considered as promising candidates for siRNA/miRNA inhibition strategies. In fact, studies that sought to identify genetic suppressor elements that inhibit RABV replication identified the N and P proteins as effective targets (Israsena et al., 2009; Wunner et al., 2004) .",

            "text": "In our current study, we attempted to develop a universal siRNA agent that would recognize different RABV strains by using the N gene, which is the most highly conserved gene among the five RABV genes in the different RABV strains. Moreover, we selected the most conserved sequences of the N transcript for use as RNAi targets. Six siRNAs (N473, N580, N783, N796, N799 and N1227) designed, and three (N796, N580 and N799) were capable of significantly inhibiting CVS-11 rabies virus replication. Furthermore, in vitro analysis indicated that the antiviral activity lasted for four days. In vivo, all of the three could partially protect mice from a lethal dose of CVS-11 rabies virus. Interestingly, when ps-N580 and ps-N799 were delivered at lower concentration but together with a liposome reagent, the survival rates significantly increased with both, but to a remarkably high extent with the ps-N799. These results indicated that the cellular uptake of the siRNA therapy was not dependent on dosage alone, but was significantly influenced by the carrier.",

            "text": "There are some discrepancies in the animal experiments that should be noted. N796 worked best as naked RNA, and worse when delivered with liposomes. The protection rates of N580 and N799 increased when delivered with liposomes, which is consistent with our theoretical design. However, the result of N796 was opposite, with N796 working better as naked RNA than with liposomes. We remain perplexed by this finding but speculate that the reason may be due to the distinctive features of in vitro and in vivo environments. Moreover, the mouse grouping was random and this result may reflect individual physical differences in the tested mice. Nonetheless, the mechanism remains unclear and we intend to investigate it in detail in our subsequent studies. The purpose of the in vivo experiments was to verify whether the siRNAs that were selected by in vitro analysis were effective in vivo. The results showed a partial protective effect. However, to achieve complete protection, other siRNA delivery methods (targeted delivery), route (intravenous crossing of the blood-brain barrier), dose (single or multiple siRNAs), and timing of therapeutic administration should be assessed to generate an optimal treatment strategy. Since the siRNAs against RABV N gene sequences were capable of reducing RABV replication and protected mice against rabies, this strategy may represent the foundation for which each of the above-listed parameters may be optimized. Although it is difficult to reach absolute protection, the fact that there is currently no effective way to cure rabies makes these agents promising candidates for adjuvant therapy. For example, in RABV exposure vaccination the body generally needs at least seven days to produce antibodies, and siRNA adjuvant may exert suppressive effects on the virus in the early stages of exposure.",
