Academic career advancement depends on publishing in leading, well established journals, journals that may have little incentive to alter their model. Also, economies extrinsic to science have grown up around the sale (and now lease, in the digital context) of journals. Change has sometimes been held back by efforts to protect publishing revenues and profits. Related to this is the desire of many publishers to rigorously defend \"their\" intellectual property (the texts provided to them by scholarly authors, together with editing, formatting, and other enhancements) in the digital environment through licensing restrictions. New technical protection schemes for intellectual property could make matters worse yet for information users.",
