The error-prone activity of the viral reverse transcriptase (RT) is predicted to be the most influential mechanism for generating mutations. The low fidelity of RT has been successfully exploited by nucleoside and nucleotide analogue reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) that halt viral replication upon incorporation. Consequently, drug-resistant strains have arisen in which the viral RT has an increased fidelity of replication, thus reducing analogue incorporation. Higher fidelity, however, impacts on viral fitness. The appearance of compensatory mutations in combination with higher fidelity NRTI resistance mutations and the subsequent reversion of NRTI-resistant mutations upon cessation of antiretroviral treatment lend support to the notion that higher fidelity exacts a fitness cost. Potential mechanisms for reduced viral fitness are a smaller pool of mutant strains available to respond to immune or drug pressure, slower rates of replication, and a limitation to the dNTP tropism of the virus. Unraveling the relationship between replication fidelity and fitness should lead to a greater understanding of the evolution and control of HIV.",

            "text": "HIV-1 has a remarkably low fidelity of replication, resulting in rapid mutation and, consequently, the ability to rapidly escape control by the immune system, antiretroviral drugs, and vaccines. 4 The sequences of HIV-1 genomes vary greatly, both between infected individuals and within an infected patient. 5, 6 The low fidelity of HIV replication is a result of the error-prone nature of the reverse transcriptase (RT), as well as numerous other potential sources of variation discussed below. The HIV RT lacks the proofreading ability of cellular polymerases and, despite sharing the structural elements of high-fidelity polymerases, 7 it has a fidelity that is considerably lower than cellular RNA polymerases and also lower than other retroviral RTs. 8, 9 HIV RT's relatively high affinity for dNTPs is likely to underpin its error-prone polymerization. 10 The low fidelity of HIV RT can be exploited with nucleoside and nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitors (referred to here collectively as NRTIs), which are analogues of natural nucleosides and nucleotides. NRTIs are less effective against host DNA and RNA polymerases, which have higher fidelity. Resistance to NRTIs is a significant challenge to the effective treatment of HIV, and many different NRTIresistant strains of HIV-1 have been characterized. 11 It is not surprising that among them are RTs that have a higher fidelity of replication, incorporating less of the NRTI than of natural nucleosides. Higher fidelity, however, comes at a cost to the virus, which is the main subject of this review. infected individual (estimated at 10.3 \u00b7 10 9 HIV virions/day) is expected to exacerbate these effects. 13 The APOBEC3 family of cellular proteins inhibits retroviral pathogenesis by hypermutating the ssDNA copy or by blocking reverse transcription. APOBEC3G is the family member that most potently inhibited HIV-1 replication, at least under certain conditions. 14 This cellular cytidine deaminase is incorporated into HIV virions where it ultimately leads to G-to-A mutations in the daughter genomic copies of the virus. In the absence of vif, multiple G-to-A mutations of HIV-1 cripple the virus. 14 Vif, however, reduces the activity of APOBEC3G by promoting its ubiquitinization and degradation. The extent to which APOBEC3G contributes to genetic variation in HIV during the course of an infection is currently controversial, with some studies indicating that it contributes to variation by a sublethal level of mutagenesis, 15 whereas other data are consistent with an ''All or Nothing'' phenomenon. 16 Previously, the process of reverse transcription has been predicted to be the most error-prone step in the HIV replication cycle; 17 however, these studies occurred prior to the characterization of APOBEC3G. This review focuses on the effects of higher fidelity RT mutants on viral fitness, but we note that the activity of APOBEC3G will likely have important consequences for viral fitness that should be better understood in the near future.",

Once the first strand of DNA is synthesized, almost all the genomic RNA will be degraded, with the exception of two purine-rich sequences (polypurine tracts) that are resistant to RNase H cleavage.

Many higher fidelity NRTI-resistant mutants have been characterized and their mechanisms of resistance explored ( Table 1 ). The best characterized of these mutants is K65R, which commonly arises during treatment with zalcitabine (ddC), didanosine (ddI), lamivudine (3TC), or tenofovir (TDF) 11 and has an estimated 8-fold increase in fidelity compared to the same HIV strain with no mutation at K65, in reporter gene assays. 23 Table 1 also includes the Q151N mutant of RT that rarely arises in vivo, but is a well-characterized example of a mutant with higher fidelity.

All of these assays employ templates that are not reflective of the HIV genome. Kinetic and cell-free reporter gene assays use purified RT where viral and host cell factors that are part of the in vivo RT complex are absent. 30 This is perhaps reflected by studies showing that the purified RT has a higher mutation rate than whole virus in vivo. 31 The range of methods and reagents (primers, templates, reporter genes) in these assays varies widely, which may explain the variation in fidelity data for a given mutant, as described in Table 1 .

Where a mutation reduces the relative replication capacity of a virus this is referred to as a ''fitness cost.'' Fitness costs can be measured in a number of increasingly sophisticated ways. On a simple level, replication kinetics of HIV variants in cell lines can be compared, although this is relatively insensitive to subtle fitness costs. A competition assay, where two viruses are seeded into tissue culture for a period of time and the ''winning'' viral strain is detected at the end of the culture, is a fairly sensitive assay, particularly if performed in primary blood CD4 T cells rather than cell lines. 32 An effective but expensive method to assess fitness is to observe the reversion of particular mutations in vivo in macaque infection experiments with SIV or chimeric SHIV viruses. 33 These experiments more accurately reflect the total fitness impact of any given mutation. One final in vivo method that is useful for testing the fitness cost of drug-resistant mutants involves monitoring the decay of drug-resistant virus in patients who have stopped treatment with a specific antiretroviral. 34, 35 The main advantage of these studies is that they translated readily to clinical situations because they involved humans.

            "text": "There is evidence that altering the fidelity of the RT, by either increasing or decreasing nucleotide selectivity, is detrimental to viral fitness. It has become increasingly clear that increases in fidelity always come with a fitness cost, as higher fidelity mutants replicated more slowly in cell lines. 35, 36 In vivo studies in both humans and SIV-infected macaques showed that the M184V/I, 34,37 K65R, 35 and E89G 38 mutants were less fit than ''wild-type'' viruses and often reverted to wild-type in the absence of drug treatment. The in vivo fitness costs of the M184I and M184V are particularly interesting, as the M184I mutation appeared early but tran-siently during 3TC treatment and was replaced by the M184V mutant. 37 The M184I mutant had a higher fidelity than M184V (Table 1 ) and these data indicate that it had a greater fitness cost compared to the lower fidelity M184V. A comprehensive comparison of the fitness cost associated with changes to HIV fidelity found a significant positive correlation between fidelity and fitness cost for high-fidelity HIV mutants, and interestingly, showed that low fidelity was also associated with lower viral fitness. 36 Compensatory mutations are additional changes to the viral genome that are predicted to offset the fitness costs of an initial mutation. They often arise in the presence of selection pressures such as immune responses 38 or drug treatment 39 and are associated with the presence of known drug escape mutants. Compensatory mutations do not confer resistance themselves, but they can restore partial replicative fitness. 40 Examples of this are the A62V and S68G mutations that increase the fitness of the K65R mutant of RT. 40 Many higher fidelity mutants are associated with compensatory mutations, 39, 41 supporting the prediction that increased fidelity comes at a cost. It is likely that the level of HIV-1 replication fidelity that achieves optimal fitness is actually a balance, whereby too high fidelity as well as too low fidelity decreases fitness. It is predicted that mutation rates of RNA viruses such as HIV sit near a critical ''error threshold'' considered to be near a theoretical ''extinction threshold.'' 42, 43 The effect of lowering fidelity further is predicted to make the genome unstable, producing too many nonviable HIV genomes. Certainly there is evidence that too many mutations can decrease the fitness of a quasispecies, as demonstrated in studies of the aforementioned APOBEC3G. In the absence of Vif, HIV could not suppress the activity of APOBEC3G and underwent hypermutation, crippling the virus. 44 Dapp et al. 45 demonstrated a negative correlation between mutation frequency and viral fitness for low-fidelity mutant HIV strain and that even relatively small increases in mutation rates decreased fitness. Further evidence comes from the Q151N mutation, which has a very high fidelity compared to other RT mutants (Table 1) . 46 RT carrying Q151N has 13-fold lower incorporation of incorrect endogenous nucleotides 47 during lacZa reporter gene assays. This is likely due to its 15.9-fold decreased ability to extend past a mismatch in kinetics assays. 46 Q151N was created in a mutagenesis study, based on the Q151M NRTI-resistant mutation that has a small increase in fidelity. The Q151N version is also drug resistant, but rarely arises in patients, perhaps indicating that too high fidelity is untenable.",

            "text": "A second potential mechanism underpinning the reduced fitness of higher fidelity RT mutants is a reduction in the rate of replication and/or processivity of the RT. An RT mutant that is more selective for correct dNTPs is likely to polymerize DNA more slowly. Numerous studies that determined a lower V max or K m ( Table 2 ) for many higher fidelity RTs supported this prediction. 52, 53 Furthermore, many higher fidelity mutant RTs have been shown to have a lower processivity, 47, 54, 55 which is defined as the length of time the enzyme remains associated with the nucleic acids. Processivity, however, is not a direct measure of the rate of replication, and strand transfer can occur when the RT dissociates, continuing polymerization. 12 Our understanding of the relationship between fidelity and processivity is evolving. Although there is evidence for a negative relationship between processivity and fidelity of M184 mutants, 56 ,57 similar studies with RTs harboring L74V and E89G found no such relationship. 58 Furthermore, emerging evidence suggests that the apparent processivity defects of K65R, M184, and Q151N may be due to the altered dNTP affinity of these mutants. 55, 59, 60 Finally, a reduction in dNTP affinity of some higher fidelity mutants is proposed to limit the tropism of HIV, thereby reducing the fitness of HIV in vivo. The increased selectivity of high fidelity mutants is often modulated by active site changes that lead to a decrease in dNTP affinity. 22, 61 The consequences of this have been analyzed in the context of both polymerization kinetics and virus tropism. Cell-based assays have shown that the Q151N and M184V/I mutants had severely reduced growth in primary cells with low dNTP concentrations. 56, 60 The K65R mutant also had a lower affinity for dNTPs, but its ability to infect cells with lower dNTP concentrations remains poorly characterized. Since HIV-1 can target cells such as macrophages that contain low dNTP levels, a lower dNTP affinity is predicted to limit viral tropism in vivo, thereby reducing the fitness of the virus. In this manner, the lower dNTP affinity associated with higher fidelity may have a specific selective disadvantage, in addition to the general impact on the rate of replication.",

Prior to the emergence of high-throughput ''Next-Generation Sequencing'' technologies, the direct detection of viral genome mutations involved cloning and sequencing individual genomes, a process that is time consuming, expensive and yields limited data, in that only a very small proportion of genotypes present in the plasma of a patient, for example, would be analyzed. High-throughput sequencing now provides the means to take a ''snapshot'' of the entire viral population at a given time. 62, 63 Sequencing platforms such as Illumina, SOLiD, and Ion Torrent generate millions of sequencing reads per run, providing the depth necessary to theoretically analyze all of the HIV genomes present in a patient sample. 64 These techniques are currently revolutionizing the study of HIV sequence diversity, with applications ranging from drug resistance monitoring to exploring the total antibody response, 64,65 but they have yet to be applied to questions of viral fidelity in published studies.",

Similarly, fitness costs increase the likelihood of reversion, especially in vivo, and a mixed population of WT and RT fidelity mutants would complicate fidelity measurements.

RNA viruses that harbor extensive genetic diversity are particularly challenging candidates as they are more likely to escape the attenuation through mutation, and low-frequency mutants may escape vaccine-elicited immune responses. Attenuation of RNA viruses by increasing their replication fidelity is one possible strategy for designing live-attenuated viruses. 42 One example is a poliovirus variant with increased replication fidelity, which as a live-attenuated vaccine successfully protected mice from lethal doses of poliovirus. 66 An interesting alternative to highfidelity live-attenuated vaccine design is a severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-coronavirus vaccine candidate that has a reduced fidelity of replication, sufficient to attenuate the virus while affording protection in a mouse model. 67 It is possible that a mutant HIV strain with increased replication fidelity could make an effective live-attenuated vaccine. However, use of a live-attenuated HIV vaccine in humans seems unlikely to become a reality due to safety and efficacy concerns. Regardless, studies of live-attenuated SIV vaccines in macaques have provided useful information on the types of immune responses necessary to prevent SIV infection, 68, 69 making an important contribution to the understanding of effective vaccine-induced immunity to HIV.",

Overall, the level of HIV RT fidelity is likely to be a balance in which too high fidelity leads to a reduction in viral fitness but too low fidelity is also detrimental to the propagation of the virus. Manipulation of viral fidelity is therefore a possible route for controlling the virus. Understanding the relationship between fidelity and viral fitness will lead to a better appreciation of HIV evolution and the potential for controlling the virus. This will certainly be enhanced by the application of high-throughput sequencing to study the fidelity of replication in vivo.",
