Tripartite motif-containing 22 (TRIM22), a TRIM family protein, has been identified as a crucial restriction factor that inhibits a group of human viruses. Currently, the role of cellular TRIM22 in PRRSV infection remains unclear. In the present study, we analyzed the effect of TRIM22 on PRRSV replication in vitro and explored the underlying mechanism. Ectopic expression of TRIM22 impaired the viral replication, while TRIM22-RNAi favored the replication of PRRSV in MARC-145 cells. Additionally, we observed that TRIM22 deletion SPRY domain or Nuclear localization signal (NLS) losses the ability to inhibit PRRSV replication. Finally, Co-IP analysis identified that TRIM22 interacts with PRRSV nucleocapsid (N) protein through the SPRY domain, while the NLS2 motif of N protein is involved in interaction with TRIM22. Although the concentration of PRRSV N protein was not altered in the presence of TRIM22, the abundance of N proteins from simian hemorrhagic fever virus (SHFV), equine arteritis virus (EAV), and murine lactate dehydrogenaseelevating virus (LDV) diminished considerably with increasing TRIM22 expression. Together, our findings uncover a previously unrecognized role for TRIM22 and extend the antiviral effects of TRIM22 to arteriviruses.",

The tripartite motif (TRIM) family of proteins are defined by the highly conserved N-terminal RBCC (RING-finger B-Box Coiled-coil) signature domain [28, 29] . The RINGfinger domain is associated with E3 ubiquitin ligase activity, whereas the B-Box and Coiled-coil region is crucial for homo-and hetero-oligomerization [28, 29] . Functionally, TRIM proteins are implicated in a broad array of cellular processes that ranging from apoptosis, transcription, differentiation, and autophagy to, more recently antiviral immunity [30] [31] [32] . A prime example is TRIM22 (also referred to as Staf50), which has previously been identified as a target gene for tumor suppressor p53 and involved in cellular proliferation [33] . As a member of TRIM family, the RINGfinger domain was shown to be required for regulation of NF-\u03baB [34, 35] , apoptosis [36], NOD2 signaling [37] , and autophagy-dependent Mycobacterium tuberculosis clearance [38] . However, TRIM22 also contains C-terminal SPRY domain to dictate the different subcellular distributions and specific functions which has not been fully clarified [39, 40] .",

For this purpose, HEK293T cells were co-transfected with Flag-tagged TRIM22-expressing plasmid and HA-tagged N protein-expressing plasmids, Co-IP experiments were then performed to assess possible interactions. Unexpectedly, the N protein levels of SHFV (Fig. 7a) , EAV (Fig. 7b) , and LDV (Fig. 7c) decreased sharply upon co-transfection with TRIM22. As shown Fig. 7a -c, evident down-regulation of SHFV, EAV and LDV N protein could be detected, indicating TRIM22 targets arteriviruses N protein in a species-specific manner.",

In fact, approximately 60% of all known human TRIM also harbor a variable SPRY domain at the carboxy terminus, facilitating protein-protein interactions [62] . The TRIM22 SPRY domain was found to specifically targeting viral N protein, much resembling the interaction between TRIM22 and nucleoprotein of IAV [47] . As nucleocapsid protein of RNA viruses, both of them have an essential role in virus assembly, encapsidating the genomic RNA, viral replication and transcription [63] . Noteworthy, the RING domain dependent/independent restriction strategies of virus from different family by TRIM22 appears to be mechanistically similar to the antiviral effect exerted by TRIM56 against Flaviviruses, Coronavirus, and Influenza virus infection [32, 64] , suggested that TRIMs have developed multiple strategy to inhibit distinct viral infection.",

PRRSV with mutation of the NLS2 is shown to induce lower viremia, while higher neutralizing antibody level than the wild-type virus [68] . We found that N protein NLS2 mutants K43-2A failed to interact with TRIM22, further supporting the functional significance of this motif. Several cellular proteins have so far been demonstrated to interact with the N protein, as exemplified by inhibitor of MyoD family-a domain-containing protein, Poly(A)-binding protein (PABP), myxovirus resistance 2 (Mx2), DExD/H-Box Helicase 9 (DHX9), DHX36, SUMO E2 conjugating enzyme Ubc9, and MOV10 [19, 49, 67, [69] [70] [71] [72] .

Our findings provide evidence that human TRIM22 targets the N proteins from SHFV, EAV, and LDV for degradation, suggesting a broad antiviral mechanism of TRIM22 against arteriviruses. However, the expression of PRRSV N protein is resistant to TRIM22 over-expression (Fig. 5a) . A possible explanation is that the N proteins of arteriviruses share only ~ 40% sequence similarity of the amino acid and TRIM22 adopts distinct mechanisms towards different viral N proteins. In this regard, a previous report has shown that differences between the amino acid sequences of NP from several IAV strains determine the sensitivity to TRIM22mediated degradation [73] .",

Therefore, the identification that knockdown of TRIM22 in MARC-145 cells increases PRRSV titer might have promising implications in reducing vaccine production costs. Recently, the CRISPR-based technology has been applied to the generation of viral diseaseresistant pigs [74] [75] [76] . In this context, restoring expression of TRIM22 via the breeding of transgenic pigs may provide potential anti-PRRSV strategies and considerable productivity benefits to pork producers. ",
