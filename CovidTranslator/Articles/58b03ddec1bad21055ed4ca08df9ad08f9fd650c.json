We detected three PEDV strains from ten small intestine samples from piglets with acute diarrhea and we determined the complete genome sequences of the reemerging Korean PEDV field isolates, except for the noncoding regions from both ends. The complete genome sequences of the strains were identical or almost identical (one synonymous single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the ORF1a/1b genomic sequence). Interestingly, comparative genome analysis of recent Korean PEDV isolates and other strains revealed that the complete genome sequences of recent Korean strains were almost identical (99.9%) to those of the US PEDV strains isolated in 2013. These results suggest that the three reemerging Korean strains are distinct from previous endemic Korean PEDV strains and has been recently introduced into Korea from oversea with high likelihood.",

            "text": "Comparative genome analysis and phylogenetic analysis revealed that the reemerging Korean PEDV strains are practically identical to the US strains. A previous study suggested that the three emergent US strains were most closely related to a strain isolated in 2012 from Anhui Province in China. In addition, the genomes of the reemerging Korean PEDV strains did not possess any genetic feature from the genomes of the previously sequenced Korean field and attenuated vaccine strains. These results suggest that the reemerging Korean PEDV strains are not variant strains of old Korean field or attenuated vaccine strains. There are two possible sources of origin of the reemerging Korean PEDV strains. First, the same source of origin of the US strains containing Chinese PEDV-like virus could have been introduced into Korea slightly later than the US outbreak events. This hypothesis can explain why the reemerging Korean PEDV strains are identical to the US strain. Another possibility is that US strain has been directly transmitted into Korea. During the US outbreak of PEDV in 2013, two genetic sublineages of the US strains were isolated. In a previous report, the authors stated that the US strain of PEDV diverged during evolution and that evolution generated two genetic sublineages, namely, IA1-CO/13 and MN-IA2 (Huang et al., 2013) . During complete genome alignment as part of this study, one of the US strains, IA1, showed a recombined genomic region in the ORF1a/ 1b gene, which closely matched that of the Chinese strain JS-HZ2012. All reemerging Korean PEDV strains isolated in this study showed a close relationship with only one of the genetic sublineages of the US strains, namely, MN-IA2. We could not detect a PEDV strain with a close relationship with the IA1-CO/13 sublineage. This possibly suggests that only one sublineage of the US strain has been directly introduced into Korea from the US. To identify the exact source of origin of the reemerging Korean strain, further investigation and surveillance are required. Furthermore, to prevent the introduction of PEDV into Korea from overseas in future, the quarantine policy on feed ingredients should be reinforced.",
