As the amount of available sequence data steadily increases, the ability to perform large-scale comparative analyses has become increasingly relevant. In addition, the growing complexity of genomic feature annotation means that new approaches to genomic visualization need to be explored. We have developed a Java-based application called Sockeye that uses three-dimensional (3D) graphics technology to facilitate the visualization of annotation and conservation across multiple sequences. This software uses the Ensembl database project to import sequence and annotation information from several eukaryotic species. A user can additionally import their own custom sequence and annotation data. Individual annotation objects are displayed in Sockeye by using custom 3D models. Ensembl-derived and imported sequences can be analyzed by using a suite of multiple and pair-wise alignment algorithms. The results of these comparative analyses are also displayed in the 3D environment of Sockeye. By using the Java3D API to visualize genomic data in a 3D environment, we are able to compactly display cross-sequence comparisons. This provides the user with a novel platform for visualizing and comparing genomic feature organization.",

            "text": "When dealing with biological data, the method by which the data is presented affects the inferences that a trained observer can make. This is especially true when dealing with sequence and annotation data. Users are presented with a wide variety of predicted and experimentally supported annotations from which hypotheses on the structure and function of the sequence can be inferred. Common inferences include whether or not the sequence contains a gene, and if so, what are the sequence features that predict likely function. To analyze these, researchers have had available many genome browsers, some of which target specific organisms (Ashburner and Drysdale 1994; Stein et al. 2001) or groups of organisms, such as Ensembl (Hubbard et al. 2002) and the UCSC Genome Browser (Karolchik et al. 2003) . These browsers are extremely well maintained and offer extensive annotation. However, each browser is designed to reflect information in the context of a limited number of sequences. To address questions such as whether a sequence shares similarities with several other sequences, most genome browsers require the user to open several independent browser windows. This complicates the perusal of annotation information. Motivated by a desire to perform comparative genomics analyses in an integrated environment, we have designed a software application named Sockeye that allows a user to simultaneously visualize and manipulate both small and large sets of sequences and their annotations.",

Users of Sockeye are able to analyze large sets of functionally linked sequences, sequences containing genes that are coexpressed, and sequences that are orthologous across multiple species. These sequences can be imported with user-defined annotation or Ensembl-curated information, allowing researchers to compare conserved structures. Loaded sequences can be exported, aligned, or discarded. Furthermore, by allowing a user to import custom annotation, Sockeye can facilitate comparative analyses across sequences from any source. For example, we have used this functionality of Sockeye to compare the genome sequence of the SARS virus against the protein complement of other similar coronaviruses (Marra et al. 2003) .",

Instead of representing data as two-dimensional (2D) images, in which annotation is labeled above and below the sequence, we have developed a three-dimensional (3D) environment in which annotation can exploit a third dimension. A 3D environment is conducive to comparative analyses in which sequence, organism classification, and annotation take up individual dimensions. In particular, a third dimension (z-axis) is well suited to displaying the magnitude of an associated score when a sequence annotation is predicted in silico. Each annotation in Sockeye is displayed as an individual 3D model mapped to a user-defined size and coloring scheme. Each 3D model is specified in a user-configurable XML format file. This allows a user to specify an extensive number of individual annotation objects from only a small collection of 3D primitives (spheres, cylinders, cones, etc.) . We propose that the large combination of differential coloring and modeling schemes within a 3D environment will allow researchers to quickly visualize and identify potentially important conservation patterns in multiple sequence data sets.",

            "text": "Sockeye allows users to execute and visualize sequence alignments. Alignment visualization tools such as PipMaker , although capable of rapidly creating highquality images, require set-up of annotation and sequence files. Sockeye integrates the process of obtaining sequence and annotation data. Furthermore, alignment visualization tools such as PipMaker, VISTA (Mayor et al. 2000) , and synplot (Gottgens et al. 2001 ) offer limited links between alignment results and annotation data (VISTA allows users to view the UCSC site in their Internet browser). Sockeye provides its alignment results with rich annotations such as low complexity repeats and ESTs. Sockeye also allows a user to simultaneously visualize several different alignments and easily view their underlying gaps. This allows a user to compare results from an individual algorithm with different input parameters, or from several different alignment algorithms (Fig. 1) . The focus of Sockeye on providing users with the ability to run genomic analyses, such as alignments, is the primary difference between it and the Apollo project (Lewis et al. 2002) . Apollo is designed to give a user extensive information for analyzing previously run alignments in order to identify new genomic annotations, such as genes. Sockeye allows a user to perform analyses as required in order to examine the relationships between sets of sequences, for instance, when searching for functional noncoding elements. The use of 3D in any type of data visualization and analysis application has advantages and disadvantages. 3D data visualization has been successfully used for engineering design and for geological and meteorological modeling, but it is relatively unexplored in genomics. The success of 3D applications in genomics has been restricted to those used for protein structure analysis (Sayle and Milner-White 1995; Tate et al. 2001; Martz 2002) and gene expression mapping (Kim et al. 2001) . Several new applications have emerged to bring 3D visualization to genomic data analysis. The most notable are the University of Calgary's Java3D CAVE application (Sensen 2002) and the complementary Stichting Academisch Rekencentrum Amsterdam's Saragene CAVE (Bohannon 2002) , both of which use specialized hardware environments, the cost of which is prohibitive for the majority of researchers. In addition, a more significant disadvantage with 3D Figure 1 Multiple alignment visualization. Sockeye is simultaneously showing alignments for regions around the first exon of the Huntington's Disease gene (HD) from LAGAN (top four sequence tracks) and ClustalW (bottom four sequence tracks). The sequence tracks in order are (1) mouse, (2) rat, (3) human, (4) Fugu, (5) mouse, (6) rat, (7) human, and (8) Fugu. For the LAGAN algorithm, the start of translation of the HD gene in each species aligns perfectly. For the ClustalW algorithm, the start of translation for the first exon of the Fugu ortholog is misaligned. The Ensembl exon annotation includes the untranslated region. Ensembl-curated repeats are shown in red; gaps are shown in gray. This image shows how Sockeye can be used for comparative genomics and comparative algorithmics.",

Subsequently, we used LAGAN to complete a multiple alignment of all the sequences that possessed one BLASTn match to the human CFTR locus. We were able to observe regions of similarity across 14 species. 2. Transcription Factor Binding Site Analysis. We have used Sockeye to visualize the locations of muscle and liver specific regulatory modules upstream of CACNL1AS in human and its ortholog, Cacna1s, in mouse. We used a LRA algorithm to scan sliding windows of 200 bp, incrementing by 5 bp, to generate GFF data that were imported into Sockeye as a distribution (Wasserman and Fickett 1998) . From this data we were able to visualize the location of several tissue specific regulatory modules (Fig. 3) . 3. Searching for new genes in C. elegans. Sockeye is being used in preliminary analyses at the CMSGSC for mapping SAGE tags to C. elegans. Because Sockeye shows EST information and C. briggsae annotation information, users have been able to find SAGE tags that map to unannotated regions of C. elegans and that also share strong homology with annotated genes in C. briggsae (G. Vatcher, pers. comm.). 4. SARS-CoV phylogeny. By using data generated from a BLASTX analysis of the protein complement of the nidovirales family against the SARS-CoV virus, Sockeye was able to simultaneously display the dissimilarities present between SARS-CoV and viruses in this family (Fig. 4) . This analysis added further visual evidence that SARS-CoV didn't originate from a recom-bination of two coronaviruses and was in fact a new type of virus (http://www.bcgsc.ca/bioinfo/SARS/, CMSGSC SARS).",

For presentation purposes, we have been able to mirror Ensembl and run Sockeye on a 1.8-Ghz P4 IBM ThinkPad with 60 Gb of hard-disk space and 256 Mb of RAM. The easiest method of using Sockeye is to import data from Ensembl at ensembldb.ensembl.org or db01.bcgsc.bc.ca.",
