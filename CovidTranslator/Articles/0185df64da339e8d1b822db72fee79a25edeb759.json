Massive application and generation of a protective local mucosal and humoral immunity with no adverse effects is the main goal for this strategy. Live virus vaccines can be improved by adding adjuvants to boost mucosal innate and adaptive responses. In a previous study we showed that diatomaceous earth (DE) can be used as adjuvant in inactivated vaccines. The aim of this study was to test DE as adjuvant in an Ark-DPI live infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) vaccine after ocular or spray application. Titrating the virus alone or after addition of DE showed that DE had no detrimental effect on the vaccine virus. How-ever, adding DE to the vaccine did not induce higher IgG titers in the serum and IgA titers in tears. It also did not affect the frequency of CD4 + T cells, CD8 + T cells and monocytes/macrophages in the blood and the spleen determined by flow cytometry. In addition, protection generated against IBV homologous challenges, measured by viral load in tears, respiratory signs and histopathology in tracheas, did not vary when DE was present in the vaccine formulation. Finally, we confirmed through our observations that Ark vaccines administered by hatchery spray cabinet elicit weaker immune responses and protection against an IBV homologous challenge compared to the same vaccine delivered via ocular route.",

            "text": "Infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) is a Gamma coronavirus and the causal agent of IB. This disease causes significant economic losses in the poultry industry worldwide. To date, vaccination is the most widely used method to control IBV. Live, attenuated vaccines are the most commonly used in commercial poultry, particularly in broiler chickens. These vaccines are usually applied massively, through drinking water or spray and/or individually via the eye drop route. The main objective of the strategy is the generation of a protective local mucosal and humoral immunity. Secondary effects of live, attenuated IBV vaccination, such as mild respiratory signs as well as reduced egg production and eggshell quality in layers (Bwala et al., 2012) , are a common outcome of their use. Due to the dozens of recognized serotypes and even more genotypes, IBV vaccination is challenging. The constant surveillance of field strains and the use of homologous vaccines is the only strategy to avoid failed protection against heterol-C 2017 Poultry Science Association Inc.

Oil-based emulsions and aluminium derivatives are routinely used in poultry inactivated vaccines to increase their immunogenicity and improve antigen delivery (Spickler and Roth, 2003) . However, the use of adjuvants substantially increases the price of inactivated vaccines (Meeusen et al., 2007) . Experimental utilization of adjuvants in live, attenuated vaccines for poultry has been previously investigated. Mucosal immune responses and protection of chickens against Newcastle disease virus (NDV) challenge after live attenuated vaccination of NDV were improved by using chitosan nanoparticles as adjuvant (Zhao et al., 2012) . In addition, better antibody responses and protection against challenge in chickens was demonstrated when a live IBV vaccine was mixed with various types of adjuvants compared with a non-adjuvanted vaccine (Deville et al., 2012) . Kjaerup and co-workers tested mannosebinding lectin ligands such as mannan, chitosan, and fructo-oligosaccharide as adjuvants in live IBV vaccines with mixed success (Kjaerup et al., 2014) . In this study, we investigated the use of diatomaceous earth (DE) as 2623 an inexpensive and readily available adjuvant to boost local mucosal and adaptive immune responses generated by an IBV live, attenuated vaccine.",

We found that both spray-vaccinated groups had a lower viral load at 7 dpv than the groups that had been vaccinated intraocularly. This correlates with results by others in which they correlate higher vaccine load early after vaccination with adequate protection (Roh et al., 2013) . A goal of an ideal vaccine is to decrease viral shedding after challenge. In this work we found that both ocular groups had lower viral loads in tears at 6 dpi. As the immunological results, this shows a better protection when the vaccine is applied intraocularly.",

An interesting trend was found in the respiratory signs assessment; a decrease in respiratory signs in the Spray DE+IBV group from d 4 to 6 post infection. This trend correlates with increasing IgG antibodies. Unfortunately, no statistical significance was encountered.",
