Based on motifs found in these serum collectins, we have constructed mutant versions of the human SP-D NCRD that have increased antiviral activity.

Hence, the antiviral activity of NCRDs can be increased by 2 distinct, complementary strategies, namely cross-linking of NCRDs through various means and mutagenesis of CRD residues to increase viral binding. These findings may be relevant for antiviral therapy.",

Human SP-D can also be present in vivo and in vitro as full-length trimers or highmolecular weight multimers ( 6 32 trimers per molecule). Dodecamers and multimers have greater antiviral activity than trimers. The neck domain of collectins mediates trimerization, and recombinant preparations containing just the neck and CRD (NCRD) of collectins spontaneously trimerize and have lectin activity.",

For instance, hNCRD can restore some functions of SP-D-/mice and can ameliorate respiratory syncitial virus infection or pulmonary hypersensitivity reactions. It should be noted that many of these studies employed an NCRD construct that also contains a short N-terminal collagen domain fragment which has impact on its activity [11] . We have explored the activities of the human SP-D NCRD with regard to IAV, using an NCRD without any collagen sequence but with an S protein binding site and His tag in the N terminus [12] . Unfortunately, these human SP-D NCRD trimers have minimal ability to bind IAV and greatly reduced antiviral activity compared to full-length SP-D. We have shown, however, that cross-linking hNCRDs with certain monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) directed against SP-D results in strong antiviral activity [3] . In addition, mutations introduced around the lectin site of the CRD confer antiviral activity on hNCRD without the need for cross-linking [12, 13] .",

Firstly, we wanted to determine if the Fc domain on the mAbs are needed to enhance specific functional activities of NCRDs. To this end, we evaluated the effectiveness of Fab fragments of an enhancing mAb in combination with wild-type SP-D NCRD. We also wanted to develop alternative methods of cross-linking of NCRDs so that we could directly compare the activity of NCRDs of various collectins after cross-linking, to confirm increased intrinsic antiviral activity of the NCRDs of some of the serum collectins. We achieved this using a multivalent preparation of S protein and a panel of collectin NCRDs all containing the S protein binding site. In this way we established a hierarchy of antiviral activity among wild-type collectin NCRDs as follows: CL43 1 conglutinin 1 mannose binding-lectin (MBL) or SP-D. Finally, we wanted to determine if mutant versions of the human SP-D NCRD with increased antiviral activity would show a further increase in activity after crosslinking. In particular, the serum collectins all have a hydrophobic amino acid (valine or isoleucine) at position 343 (using SP-D numbering), whereas SP-D and surfactant protein A have arginine or lysine (for rodent SP-D) at this site. Human SP-D NCRDs containing R343V or R343I substitutions have increased antiviral activity compared to the NCRD of wild-type SP-D [13] . We now show that cross-linking of these mutants with either mAbs or S protein complexes caused a further marked increase in antiviral activity. Of note, the antiviral activity of R343V cross-linked with S protein complexes exceeded that of any of the wild-type collectin NCRDs treated in a similar manner.",

The use of bacterially expressed proteins is feasible because there are no known post-translational modifications within the human SP-D CRD or neck domains, which self-assemble in vitro as stable trimers with lectin activity. All of the NCRD preparations contain an S protein binding site in the N terminus as described previously [17] . Sequences were verified by automated sequencing of the entire coding sequence of the fusion protein. RosettaBlue competent cells were transformed with the wild-type or mutant construct in pET-30a(+) vector, and expressed proteins were isolated from inclusion bodies. After refolding and oligomerization, the fusion proteins were purified by nickel affinity chromatography. Trimers were isolated by gel filtration chromatography on an \u00c4kta system (24) . All proteins were isolated in similar yields with similarly low levels of endotoxin (0.1 to approximately 0.5 EU/ml; Limulus Lysate Assay, Cambrex, Walkersville, Md., USA).

In the case of RAW cells, there was no difference between the effects of F(ab')2 fragments and intact antibody. We previously reported that treatment of IAV with hNCRD cross-linked by the mAb 246-08 markedly increases neutrophil H 2 O 2 responses to the virus.

Then the effects of these treatments on viral HA activity ( a ) and viral infectivity for MDCK cells ( b ) were tested. Results are means 8 SEM of 3 or more experiments. a NCRD alone at concentrations up to 8 g/ml did not cause any inhibition of HA activity. Addition of F(ab')1 fragments did not alter this results; however, addition of the intact mAb or F(ab')2 fragments of the mAb did result in HA inhibition (p ! 0.05). b Similarly, NCRD alone (12 g/ml) or combined with F(ab')1 fragments had no viral neutralizing activity, whereas the intact mAb or F(ab')2 fragments caused significant inhibition (each was significantly less than control or NCRD alone as assessed by ANOVA). The mAb alone had no effect on viral infectivity (black bar in Control). rected against human SP-D. Our NCRDs contain an S protein binding site which we exploited for this purpose. S protein conjugated with HRP can be used to detect binding of our NCRDs to various ligands. Previous binding studies have shown that different NCRD preparations are equivalently detected by the S protein-HRP conjugates. As shown in figure 3 a, S protein-HRP is present as high-molecular weight aggregates on a nonreduced SDS-PAGE gel, whereas free S protein or S protein conjugated to biotin exist as monomers. This property of S protein-HRP was exploited for our studies to generate aggregates of NCRDs containing the S protein binding site. As shown in figure 3 b, preincubation of hNCRD with the S protein-HRP complex resulted in substantially increased binding to IAV compared to the situation where hNCRD is added to the virus followed by addition of S protein-HRP. This implies that S protein-HRP forms a complex with hNCRD that is able to bind more avidly to IAV by presenting multiple hNCRD trimeric heads simultaneously (resembling an SP-D multimer). Preincubation of either hNCRD or rNCRD with S protein-HRP also allowed the NCRDs to inhibit viral HA activity ( fig. 4 a) . Preincubation with free S protein or S protein-biotin did not confer HA-inhibiting activity. These preparations provide useful controls because (as demonstrated in fig. 3 a) they are not multimeric complexes of S protein.",

This again suggests that increased phagocyte uptake of IAV can occur in the absence of N-terminal domains of collectins or the Fc domain of antibodies as long as viral aggregation occurs. Note that viral aggregation was measured by assessing light transmission through stirred suspensions of IAV in this assay, and viral aggregates reduce light transmission compared to untreated virus [21] .

Another possibility is that the N-terminal and collagen domains of SP-D or other collectins engage specific receptors on phagocytes to trigger phagocytosis and increased cellular activation.

            "text": "We have previously shown that the intrinsic antiviral activity of hNCRD can be greatly increased by specific mutations of residues surrounding the lectin-binding site of the NCRD (as in R343V) [13] . These mutations increase the ability of the hNCRD to bind high-mannose glycans of the type found on the viral HA of recent human strains. We have now demonstrated that the neutralizing activity of R343V can be strongly potentiated by cross-linking with mAb 246-08. The combined effects of the R343V mutation and cross-linking result in inhibition of IAV at concentrations of R343V under 100 ng/ml. The activity of R343V cross-linked with S protein-HRP is also notable, since it was greater than the activity of any of the wild-type collectins treated in a similar manner. These results support the concept that combining two methods of increasing the activity of NCRDs (i.e. mutagenesis of the binding region and cross-linking of trimers) can have additive or synergistic effects. Of interest, cross-linking of R343V with either an mAb or S protein-HRP also caused a marked increase in activity against a hypoglycosylated strain of IAV, suggesting that the combined strategy of mutagenesis of the NCRD and crosslinking could increase activity against pandemic viral strains that have diminished envelope protein glycosylation.",

            "text": "Our findings have potential relevance to therapeutics because NCRDs are relatively easy to produce in large quantities. In addition, the use of collectins without including the collagen domain could be advantageous because the collagen domain is associated with some potential proinflammatory effects of SP-D [32] . The use of S protein-HRP complexes to cross-link NCRDs was more valuable as a tool to evaluate the mechanisms of activity of SP-D than as a potential therapy. In contrast, the use of mAbs or fragments to cross-link NCRDs also has conceivable clinical application because many mAbs are now being used effectively in the treatment of infectious or inflammatory diseases or cancer. For instance, palivizumab, which is an mAb directed against the respiratory syncytial virus fusion protein, is effective in prophylaxis against severe infection [35] . This implies that mAbs can achieve significant levels in the lung and inhibit respiratory viral replication. Furthermore, F(ab')1 or F(ab')2 fragments are also used in treatment. Certolizumab is an F(ab')1 fragment of an mAb directed against tumor necrosis factor alpha that has significant therapeutic benefit in Crohn's disease [36] . In this case, conjugation of the F(ab')1 fragment with polyethylene glycol is used to prolong the serum half-life. In animal models, F(ab')2 frag-ments directed against the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus or highly pathogenic H5N1 IAV show therapeutic benefit, indicating that such antibody fragments can achieve meaningful levels in the respiratory tract [37, 38] .",

The specific advantage of the use of F(ab')2 fragments to crosslink NCRDs (or possibly endogenous SP-D) is that because they lack the Fc domain, these fragments do not provoke complement activation, antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity or respiratory burst activation of neutrophils. There is evidence that reactive oxygen or ni-trogen species are harmful in the context of severe IAV infection [1, 39, 40] , so it could be advantageous to avoid triggering such responses. It is also of specific interest that cross-linking of the NCRD of MBL results in increased antiviral activity without the use of the N-terminal and collagen domains. This could be of therapeutic interest since the N-terminal and collagen domains of MBL mediate complement activation, which could be deleterious in some settings [41, 42] .",
