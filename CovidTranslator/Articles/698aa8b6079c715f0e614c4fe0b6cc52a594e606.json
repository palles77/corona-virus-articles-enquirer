In recent studies we have demonstrated that cough may be induced by vibration of the airway at the level of the throat or chest in patients with URTI but that the same stimuli induce little or no cough in healthy subjects. The difference between the patients with URTI and healthy subjects in their response to airway vibration may be explained on the basis of hyperreactivity of airway sensory receptors. We propose that the model of cough induced by airway vibration may be useful for studies on the pathophysiology and pharmacology of airway hyperreactivity in acute cough. The airway vibration model of cough may have some advantages over inhaled tussigens as the stimulus is easily controlled and the method is safe for use in children. q",

            "text": "Cough associated with acute upper respiratory tract infection (URTI) is a common and troublesome problem and it is surprising that very little is known about the aetiology of this type of cough. It is assumed that the normal protective reflex of cough is exaggerated in some way during URTI so that cough occurs spontaneously instead of in response to food or fluid coming in contact with the airway epithelium. It has been proposed that during URTI there is an increased sensitivity of the sensory nerves in the airway epithelium that mediate cough due to the presence of mediators of inflammation [1, 2] . In a prospective study on healthy volunteers it was shown that cough sensitivity to inhaled capsaicin was increased during periods of URTI [2] . A similar increase in cough sensitivity associated with URTI has been reported when cough was induced with an aerosol of inhaled citric acid [1] or nebulized distilled water [3] . Empey et al. [1] have proposed that the increase in cough sensitivity during URTI may be due to increased sensitivity of the rapidly adapting airway receptors (RARs). The RARs are particularly sensitive to mechanical stimulation [4, 5] and therefore it should be possible to induce cough with an adequate mechanical stimulus to the airway. Mechanical induction of cough has been achieved in anaesthetized animals by intra-tracheal stimulation of the upper airway with bristles or iron slugs [6, 7] and airway vibration has been shown to induce cough in humans [8, 9] .",

The cough model associated with airway vibration may allow measurement of the degree of airway hyperreactivity associated with URTI since cough is not readily induced in healthy volunteers by airway vibration. The present paper will discuss the mechanism of airway hyperreactivity associated with URTI and the usefulness of the cough model of airway vibration in clinical trials of new treatments for cough associated with URTI.",

            "text": "In an epidemiological study of common cold symptoms in 131 persons over a 1 year period it was found that the group suffered an average of 2.2 colds, with runny nose being the most common symptom (87%) and cough occurring in only 44% of subjects [11] . In general, patterns of symptom development are not substantially different with different viruses [12] but there is evidence that some viruses are more likely to cause the symptom of cough. Comparison of the percentages of subjects that experienced various symptoms after viral challenge showed that the incidence of cough varies from 9 to 64% depending on the virus used for challenge [12] . This finding indicates that some viruses have the capacity to induce cough whereas others do not. A simple explanation for this difference may be differences in the novelty of the viruses and previous immune history of the patient. Viruses that are commonly circulating in the community tend to cause mild symptoms and sub-clinical infections because of 'herd' immunity to the virus whereas the introduction of a new virus to a previously unexposed community can cause severe illness. Epidemics and pandemics of influenza result because of the novelty of the virus and absence of herd immunity, and severe illness with cough and fever as major symptoms occurs in the population. In the recent cases of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) the major self-reported symptoms were fever (99%) and non-productive cough (69%) [13] and the best predictors for the diagnosis of influenza in the community are cough and fever with a positive predictive value of 79% [14] .",

            "text": "Mild URTI may not be associated with cough because the infection is restricted to the nose and generates rhinitis with symptoms of runny nose, sneezing and nasal congestion. The sensory nerve supply to the nose is from the branches of the trigeminal nerve and stimulation of this pathway results in reflex sneezing and secretion but not cough [15] . Cough is said to be mediated exclusively by the vagus nerves [16] and therefore it is not surprising that a mild common cold is not associated with cough as the infection is restricted to the part of the airway supplied by the trigeminal nerves. With more severe URTI the infection and inflammation may spread down the airway to the larynx, trachea and bronchi, and thus involve parts of the airway supplied by the vagus nerves and therefore trigger cough. The restriction of the vagus nerve to the parts of the airway from the larynx downwards may explain why cough is a dominant symptom in severe respiratory infections such as influenza and SARS but not a major symptom with common cold. In the course of URTI cough develops as a late symptom [12] and this may be because the infection starts at the level of the nose and gradually spreads down the airway to the larynx. Only when the inflammation involves the structures of the larynx and below does cough develop as a symptom.",

This recruitment of cough is clear in Fig. 3 . where the number of coughs reached a maximum after three periods of throat vibration, and is also apparent in Fig. 5 where the number of coughs is greatest after three periods of chest percussion. These results indicate that there is some recruitment or facilitation of cough with repeated airway vibration. The cough recruitment could be due to cough itself traumatizing the airway and causing the release of inflammatory mediators, or it could be due to a central rather than a peripheral mechanism. Brainstem mechanisms such as cough exhibit plasticity and short-and long-term memories that affect the response [22] and it is possible that this type of memory would lead to an enhancement of the cough reflex.",

In a study on citric acid-induced cough the threshold concentration that caused cough in patients with URTI was 2% whereas the threshold concentration in healthy subjects was 3.75% [1] . In a study on capsaicin-induced cough the log concentration of capsaicin (micromoles) needed to induce two coughs (C2) in patients with URTI was 0.27 whereas in healthy subjects the C2 was 0.89 [2] . These studies on inhaled tussigens indicate that patients with URTI need only 30-50% of the concentration of tussigen in order to induce cough compared with healthy subjects. The studies on airway vibration described above, indicate that this method may be better able to discriminate between healthy and hyperreactive patients than methods using inhaled tussigens. A great advantage is that airway vibration induces very little cough in healthy subjects and therefore there is a great difference in the total number of coughs induced in healthy and URTI patients as described above. The large difference in cough sensitivity between healthy and URTI patients demonstrated with airway vibration means that this method could be useful in studying cough medicines that may return the sensitivity of the cough reflex back towards normal, as normal in this case would be the absence of cough or a very long latency to cough.",
