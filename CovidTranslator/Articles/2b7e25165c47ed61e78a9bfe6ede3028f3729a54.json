Clues to the genetic basis of pathogenicity can be gleaned from comparison of the nucleotide sequence of a virulent parent viral strain with that of the cell-passaged attenuated variant. One such pair is the prototype North American isolate, strain VR-2332, and Resp-PRRS, its MA-104 cell adapted attenuated descendent. In this article, we report the complete nucleotide sequence of both strains of PRRSV and have deduced and characterized their nucleotide and protein differences. Several key amino acid changes between parental and vaccine strains were identified using this approach, but many other nucleotide and amino acid changes also occurred in genomic regions of unknown function. The nucleotide sequences were also compared to strain 16244B, which is claimed to be a virulent field revertant of RespPRRS (Allende et al., 2000) . A full comparison of all three PRRSV strains shows that the origin of 16244B ('Michelle' strain) is unclear.",

Initially, several standard 5%-RACE was performed on passage 2 from the original VR-2332 field isolate brain homogenate, passage 31 of strain VR-2332 and passage 4 of RespPRRS vaccine strain (Frohman, 1994) . Three different 5%-terminal base patterns were elucidated, with added ambiguity due to the poly T tract added during the 5%-RACE procedure, immediately preceding an apparent 18 base PRRSV sequence GACGUAUAGGUGUUGGC. Interestingly, heterogeneity at the 5%-end was detected early during passaging of the original PRRSV field isolate, yet no heterogeneity was seen after viral plaque purification to produce strain VR- Fig. 1 . 5%-terminal nucleotides of strains VR-2332 and RespPRRS. VR-2332 (VR) or RespPRRS (R) from different passages were subjected to rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) and products were cloned and sequenced as described in Section 2. VR-2332 represents sequence submitted to GenBank prior to elucidation of the 5% terminal nucleotides. Strain VR-2332-infected brain homogenate was passaged two times on two separate occasions (VR-2a, VR-2b), or plaque purified and passaged 24 (VR-24) or 31 (VR-31) times.

Further analysis of PCR clones derived from 5%-RACE experiments using poly (G) addition discriminated the remaining 5% terminal bases of strains VR2332 and RespPRRS. Only one additional base, corresponding to an adenine residue, was identified for strain VR-2332 ( Fig. 1) . Two additional bases, TA, were detected for the 5% terminal bases of four PCR clones derived from vaccine strain RespPRRS. The number of subsequent passages shown in Fig. 1 (2, 4, 12, 24, 31) indicates the relative stability of the cloned virus strains. These results are discordant with a recent report with respect to the first nucleotide of VR2332 and Resp-PRRS. Oleksiewicz and investigators reported a 5%-terminal U in strain VR-2332 and lack of such in strain RespPRRS (Oleksiewicz et al. 1999) , whereas we observed a 5%-terminal U only in the RespPRRS vaccine strain. The complete leader sequence of RespPRRS vaccine strain shares 95.2% identity with another PRRSV vaccine strain, PrimePac PRRS (Shen et al., 2000) (data not shown).",

RespPRRS leader sequence acquired two additional mutations when passaged for another eight passages at high m.o.i. (UA base 36 and UC at base 63). From the sequence data, we cannot determine exactly when the 5%-terminal thymidine residue of strain RespPRRS was acquired during passaging.

The RespPRRS sequence which we derived from 3-to 7-fold coverage of the genome (AF066183) is somewhat different from the sequence of Re-spPRRS recently reported (Allende et al., 2000) .",

We compared identical and non-identical nucleic acid residues between strains VR-2332 and RespPRRS, strains VR-2332 and 16244B, between RespPRRS and 16244B, and between all three strains. We observed 15157 instances in which all three viral genomes contained the identical base, 215 instances in which strains VR-2332 and RespPRRS were identical but different from strain 16244B, 17 cases in which strains VR-2332 and 16244B were identical but different from strain RespPRRS, and 22 instances in which strains RespPRRS and 16244B were identical but different from VR-2332. Importantly, no instances were observed in which the three strains were all different from one another. If strain 16244B were in fact derived from a field reversion of RespPRRS, the data would imply that for 237 nucleotide mutations 16244B reverted back to the exact VR-2332 nucleotide sequence and in no modifications that occurred in GP3 (aa 83, GE; aa 116, G S; aa 251, A T) and the two in GP4 (aa 69, C Y; aa 135, V A) also are predicted to lie on the exterior of the virion. All of these mutations but one are semi-or non-conservative changes. In the putative viral attachment protein GP5, two amino acids were altered during virus attenuation. One GP5 change occurred within the proposed signal sequence (aa 13, R Q) and the other change (aa 151, RG) is predicted to be located in the virion interior . GP5 has been shown to be disulfide linked to the M protein Mardassi et al., 1996) and studies with a similar virus have revealed that this disulfide bond is critical to infectivity . While no mutations occurred in the extravirion region of GP5, one mutation did occur within the M protein (aa 16, Q E) predicted to be located on the outer surface of the virus. Although this M protein mutation was conservative, mutations in this critical region of the PRRSV viral attachment heterodimer could be important. However, analysis of the sixth in vivo backpassage of RespPRRS re-instance would it have mutated to either of the two possible remaining bases. The likelihood of such a probability is exceedingly low. We also considered the possibility that strain 16244B resulted from a viral recombination event between strain RespPRRS and an unidentified but closely related field isolate. However, no region of considerable length was clearly identified as being derived from strain RespPRRS, which one would expect if viral recombination had taken place. Therefore, the origin of 16244B remains unclear.",

This represents a 0.28% variation during 70 passages in MA-104 cells. This rate of variation is comparable to other RNA viruses (Steinhauer and Holland, 1987) and suggests that PRRSV is not susceptible to inherently high spontaneous mutation rates in the absence of immunological and environmental pressures. This may explain the relative stability of strain VR-2332 when passaged alone in cell culture, as this report delineates. However, PRRSV has been shown to undergo high frequency recombination in the presence of two or more virus strains (Yuan et al., 1999) and appears to evolve rapidly in the presence of biological pressure.",

However, one or more of these silent mutations could change the secondary or tertiary structure of PRRSV RNA and thus alter the stability of the genome.

Only two mutations occurred in the 5%-end of PRRSV during attenuation of strain VR-2332 to RespPRRS, and their relative roles in attenuation must be further investigated. No change occurred in the 3%-end of the PRRSV genome. Viruses may also acquire attenuated phenotypes as a result of mutations in viral proteases (Ni et al., 1995) , protease cleavage sites (Tozser et al., 1999) , within the polymerase gene (Pelosi et al., 1998; Skiadopoulos et al., 1999) , by altering viral proteins to decrease virion stability (Bailly et al., 2000) or to interfere with the virus/host interaction (McCright et al., 1999) , as well as by other mechanisms.

We have determined that our sequence of the RespPRRS strain is somewhat different from what has been previously reported (Allende et al., 2000) , which brings additional complexity to the derivation of potential PRRSV attenuation sites. In addition, the 5%-terminal nucleotides for both VR-2332 and RespPRRS are markedly different from those reported for strain 16244B. In our view, PRRSV attenuation sites may be genotype specific and variable, possibly resulting from a complicated interplay of genomic regions and viral and host specific factors. Postulation of attenuation sites can lead to interesting hypothesisbased experiments. However, a reverse genetics system for PRRSV must be produced and genetically altered at specific nucleotides in order to discern sites of attenuation.",

The schematic also shows possible nonstructural proteins (1 -12) produced during cleavage by ORF1-encoded proteases at proposed cleavage sites (grey arrows). Seventeen amino acid changes occurred during in vitro passaging of strain VR-2332 to produce attenuated strain RespPRRS. Interesting mutations mentioned in the text are indicated by an asterisk.",
