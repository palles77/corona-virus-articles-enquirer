            "text": "A one step reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) assay was developed for detection of viral hemorrhagic septicaemia virus (VHS). A set of six primers were designed, based on the G-protein sequence of the VHS virus serotypes (He, F1, 23.75, Klapmolle and Rindsholm). The assay was optimised to amplify VHS RNA by incubation at 63 8C for only 1 h, and required only a simple water bath or heating block to provide a constant temperature of 63 8C. RT-LAMP amplification products were detected by visual inspection using SYBR Green I stain and had a ladder-like appearance when electrophoresed on an agarose gel. The detection limit of the RT-LAMP assay was found to be similar to the commonly used RT-PCR method: both methods detected VHS RNA at a dilution of 10 6 . The assay was evaluated using clinical samples and the results indicated the suitability and simplicity of the test as a rapid, field diagnostic tool for VHS virus. #",

            "text": "Animal Rhabdoviruses, belonging to the family Rhabdoviridae, infect a broad range of hosts throughout the animal kingdom, including insects, mammals and fish. Aquatic Rhabdoviruses cause significant diseases in fish reared as part of the worldwide salmonid farming industry (Rocha et al., 2004) . Among fish Rhabdoviruses, viral hemorrhagic septicaemia virus (VHS), of the genus Novirhabdovirus, often causes pronounced cumulative mortality of salmonids, especially rainbow trout Oncorhynchus mykiss (Miller et al., 1998) . The virus is enzootic in much of continental Europe (Wolf, 1988) and has been found in North America (King et al., 2001; Snow and Smail, 1999) . VHS is a notifiable disease, included in List II of the European Union Directive 93/54 (1993), and is known by several names including Egtved disease and infectious kidney-swelling and liver degeneration. www.elsevier.com/locate/vetmic Veterinary Microbiology 114 (2006) [205] [206] [207] [208] [209] [210] [211] [212] [213] The virus' aetiology was established by Jensen (1965) , and it is known to infect primarily rainbow trout, Oncorhynchus mykiss, brown trout, Salmo trutta, and to a lesser extent northern pike, Esox lucius (Jorgensen, 1980; Meier and Jorgensen, 1980) , grayling, Thymallus thymallus, and whitefish, Coregonus sp. (Wizigmann et al., 1980; Ahne and Thomsen, 1985; Meier et al., 1986) . The virus has also been isolated from free-living marine fish in the northern Pacific and Atlantic Oceans, the North Sea and the Baltic Sea (Meyers and Winton, 1995; Mortensen et al., 1999) . Virus isolates from wild marine fish are serologically indistinguishable from normal fresh water isolates (Jorgensen and Olesen, 1987) . VHS virus is transmitted by direct contact with either infected fish or contaminated water (Vestergard Jorgensen, 1973) . Survivors from infection become carriers and shed the virus with urine and sexual fluids (Neukirch, 1985) . Although the virus can be present on the surface of eggs, it is readily dissipated and there is no true vertical transmission (Vestergard Jorgensen, 1970) . VHS infection in susceptible fish species is often lethal, due to impairment of osmotic balance; clinical signs include oedema and red haemorrhagic spots around the eyes and on the gills, and blood clots in body fat, viscera and muscle (Wolf, 1988) .",

However, diagnosis of VHS using this PCR test requires expensive equipment and reagents, rendering it unfavourable for use on a large-scale basis, or onsite. A novel, rapid and sensitive technique called loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) has been developed by Notomi et al. (2000) and is capable of amplifying DNA or RNA under isothermal conditions with high specificity and efficiency. LAMP is based on the principle of autocycling strand displacement DNA synthesis. The reaction is performed by a DNA polymerase with high strand displacement activity and a set of two specific inner primers and two outer primers (Notomi et al., 2000) . A reverse transcriptase coupled LAMP assay has been used to detect West Nile virus and for rapid detection of SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) coronavirus (Thai et al., 2004) .",

Difficulties associated with isolation of viruses from clinical specimens has lead to development of rapid and reliable virus detection assays including many RT-PCR assays developed for diagnosis of VHS (Bruchhof et al., 1995; Einer-Jensen et al., 1995; Miller et al., 1998; Strommen and Stone, 1998; Guillou et al., 1999; Williams et al., 1999) . Despite the simplicity of the RT-PCR reaction, its requirements for a high precision thermacycler and elaborate methods for detecting the amplified products have restricted its wide use as a routine diagnostic tool (Thai et al., 2004) . To overcome these issues, Notomi et al. (2000) developed a novel nucleic acid amplification assay: loop-mediated isothermal amplification. The LAMP reaction has been used successfully to detect fish viral infections (Caipang et al., 2004; Gunimaladevi et al., 2004 Gunimaladevi et al., , 2005 , and has been applied to the detection of VHS in the present study.",

The reaction is executed in a single tube and only requires a simple water bath or heating block to provide a constant temperature of 63 8C for 1 h. The LAMP reaction relies on autocycling strand displacement DNA synthesis and utilises a set of four specially designated inner and outer primers (Notomi et al., 2000) which are used during the initial steps of the reaction. During the subsequent cycling reactions, only the inner primers are used for strand displacement DNA synthesis . Each inner primer contains two distinct sequences corresponding to the sense and antisense sequences of the target DNA. The primers form stem-loop structures which initiate self-priming DNA synthesis, and serve as the starting material for the subsequent LAMP cycling reaction (Kuboki et al., 2003) . To further reduce the reaction time, two additional loop primers were used to hybridise to the stem-loops formed by the outer primers. The loops hybridised by the inner primers subsequently prime strand displacement DNA synthesis (Nagamine et al., 2002) .",

Visual inspection is a superior detection method as there is no need for gel electrophoresis and staining with ethidium bromide; only 1 ml of diluted SYBR Green I was required to visualise the reaction products: a distinct green colour indicated a positive result while orange indicated negative.
