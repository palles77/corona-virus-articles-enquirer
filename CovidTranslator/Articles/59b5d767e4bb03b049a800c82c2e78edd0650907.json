An internal extraction control (equine arteritis virus RNA) was added during the nucleic acid extraction process as previously described (Caddy et al., 2013) .cDNA was generated by reverse transcription using MMLV reverse transcriptase enzyme (Life Technologies) and random hexamers (Life Technologies) with the reaction performed at 42 8C for 1 h, followed by an inactivation step at 70 8C for 10 min. qPCR was performed using primers targeting a conserved region of the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase as previously described (Martella et al., 2011) . The sequences of primers used for PCR in this study are presented in Table 1 . qPCR reactions were prepared using the MESA Blue qPCR MasterMix Plus for SYBR Assay (Eurogentech). Briefly, 2 ml cDNA was mixed with 2\u00c2 MasterMix and 0.5 mM primers, then incubated at 95 8C for 10 min. The thermal cycle protocol used with a ViiA7 qPCR machine (AB Applied Biosystems) was as follows: 40 cycles of 94 8C, 15 s; 56 8C, 30 s; 72 8C, 30 s, followed by generation of a melt curve. Viral genome copy number was calculated by interpolation from a standard curve generated using serial dilutions of a standard DNA amplicon cloned from a positive control. The limit of detection was determined by the lowest dilution of control standard CNA reproducibly detected in the assay. All samples were additionally screened for the presence of canine parvovirus (CPV), canine enteric coronavirus (CECoV) and canine norovirus (CNV) using a 1-step qRT-PCR protocol (Caddy et al., 2013) .",

            "text": "A number of studies have reported the N-terminal and C-terminal regions of astrovirus capsids to be relatively conserved, whereas the central region is hypervariable. The human astrovirus capsid protein has previously been divided into three regions; the N terminus (amino acids 1-415), a variable central region (416-707), which includes a hypervariable section from 649 to 707, and a conserved C terminus (708-786) (Willcocks et al., 1995) . An analogous approach for the CaAstV capsid was taken by Zhu et al. (2011) , who divided the capsid into three regions for analysis: amino acids 1-446, 447-730, and 731-end. The four capsid sequences derived from this study have been analysed according to the latter scheme, and sequence identity compared (Fig. 1) . Sequence analysis of the three regions clearly shows that the majority of sequence variation is concentrated in region II. A 24 nt deletion was identified in samples 2-4 in the 5 0 end region II, which has previously been reported in Chinese CaAstV strains (Zhu et al., 2011) . It is not possible to predict the location of this deletion on the capsid structure as it is beyond the region of the astrovirus capsid spike for which the crystal structure has been solved (Dong et al., 2011) . However, sequence alignment with the human astrovirus type 8 capsid (GenBank AAF85964.1) shows this deletion to be located downstream of the caspase cleavage site required for virion maturation, which truncates the full length capsid protein (VP90) into the mature VP70 form (Banos-Lara and M\u00e9 ndez, 2010). Therefore it is predicted that the 24 nt deletion will not alter the mature virion. Evolutionary analysis of the four CaAstV sequences from the study, alongside the seven previously reported full-length CaAstV capsid sequences are presented in Fig. 2 . This analysis indicated that the UK strains do not cluster, contrary to a previous study, which analysed CaAstV strains from a single city (Zhu et al., 2011) . Each UK strain is distinct from each other, and whereas one strain clusters most closely with the Chinese strains, the remainder group with strains identified in Italy over a number of years.",

CaAstV VPg is predicted to start at aa 656, at a conserved QK cleavage site and is 90 aa in length. In other astroviruses, it has been proposed that the C-terminal VPg cleavage site is coded by Q(P/A/S/L) (Al-Mutairy et al., 2005) , and the presence of a QS dipeptide at the same site in CaAstV is consistent with this prediction. The amino acid motif KGK(N/T)K is conserved at the N-terminal end of VPg sequences from both astroviruses and caliciviruses, and this is also identifiable in the CaAstV genome. Another conserved VPg motif is TEXEY, with mutagenesis studies indicating that the Y (tyrosine) residue covalently links VPg to viral RNA (Fuentes et al., 2012) . Analysis of the CaAstV ORF1a sequence also identifies the conserved TEXEY motif at 684-688, thus this tyrosine is predicted to covalently link to the RNA genome. However, the CaAstV sequence diverges slightly from the other mamastroviruses studied, Fig. 2 . Phylogenetic tree based on the full-length amino acid sequence of the capsid protein of CaAstVs.

A \u00c01 ribosomal frameshift site between ORF1a and ORF1b, present in human astroviruses (Marczinke et al., 1994) , is also conserved in CaAstV. This translational frameshift is directed by the slippery heptamer sequence AAAAAAC at position 2666 in the CaAstV genome. A stem loop structure is predicted downstream of the slippery sequence, as shown in Fig. 4 . The slippery sequence and downstream stem loop are highly conserved amongst mamastroviruses. The 3 0 end of ORF1a overlaps with ORF1b by 49 nucleotides. This is shorter than the 71 nt overlap reported for human astroviruses.",

This prevalence was unexpectedly high given that CaAstV has not previously been reported in the UK. It may be predicted that this is an underestimation of prevalence based on the population of dogs surveyed. The majority of previous CaAstV epidemiological studies have focused on dogs less than 6 months old, whereas this study included dogs of any age. Serological studies have shown that exposure to CaAstV typically occurs in young animals, with dogs older than 3 months significantly more likely to be seropositive than younger dogs (Martella et al., 2011) . This suggests that studies focusing only on young dogs will identify more positive CaAStV cases. However, the decision to survey dogs of any age in this study enabled detection of a CaAstV case in a 7-year-old dog. This is oldest case of CaAstV reported to date and highlights the need to have an index of suspicion for infectious causes of gastroenteritis in dogs of any age. Indeed although human astrovirus is more common in paediatric populations, infections in the elderly are reported (Fern\u00e1 ndez et al., 2011) .",

However, our study shows a clear relationship between the presence of CaAstV RNA in stool samples, and (Martella et al., 2011; Zhu et al., 2011) , but is at odds with a French study which found no significant difference in CaAstV identification between diarrhoeic (27%) or healthy puppies (19%) (Grellet et al., 2012) . Determination of the specific pathology induced by CaAstV infection in dogs is often confounded in a clinical setting by co-infections with other gastroenteric pathogens (e.g. CPV in dogs 1 and 4 in this study). Experimental studies will be required to confirm or refute the association of CaAstV with gastroenteritis, but this study does suggest CaAstV can cause disease. Sequencing of the capsid region of each CaAstV strain identified in this study revealed significant sequence variation. This mirrors the variation previously identified within human astrovirus isolates (De Benedictis et al., 2011) . At present, astroviruses are named according to the species in which they are isolated, and subsequent classification is based upon serotypes; these are defined if there is a 20-fold or greater two-way cross neutralisation titre (King et al., 2011) . Sequence analysis has verified this classification, with human astroviruses 1-8 having 86-100% nucleotide identity within a serotype, based on capsid sequences (Noel et al., 1995) . The nucleotide variation within the capsid region of the four CaAstV strains was shown to be 77.1-81.1%, which strongly suggests these strains are also different serotypes. Confirmation of this requires serological analysis, but unfortunately repeated attempts to grow the CaAstV isolates identified in this study in cell culture failed (data not shown).",
