Methods: Materials of tongue picture were dynamically collected from 34 SARS patients and 35 suspected SARS patients, and the difference and similarity between them were analyzed. Meanwhile, the changes in clinic symptoms and tongue picture after integrative medicinal treatment were observed. Results\" Characteristics of tongue picture in SARS patients were changed along with the progress of the disease, showing that there existed a tendency of the pathogen invading from exterior to interior, from surface to the deep. Also the tongue pictures were varied due to the coexistence of dampness pathogen; the time of the early stage was generally 1-1.5 days, shorter than that of other stages. While in the patients with suspected SARS, the tongue picture was mostly red with thin white or yellow coating, comparatively steady and showing no obvious change along with the development of the disease. Conclusion: Observing the tongue picture and its changes in different stages can be helpful to understanding the property of pathogenic evil and its developing rules, thus offering a basis for clinical treatment.

Because of the coexistence of dampness pathogen, the manifestations of tongue coating are varied. For example, red tongue with greasy white coating or greasy yellow coating (dirty fur) is commonly seen in the ultimate stage. Suspected SARS also belongs to epidemic febrile kind of disease, but because its pathogen is of common windwarm nature, no obvious changes in tongue picture occurred, and what was shown was mainly red tongue with thin white or thin yellow coating in the whole developing process of the disease.

Although a great deal of basical and clinical studies have been conducted at home and abroad, the knowledge about SARS is still superficial. Since at present no special effective treatment for SARS is discovered in Western medicine, it is quite important to control the epidemic disease by actively using TCM and fulfilling the integration of TCM with Western medicine. Tongue picture is a very important part in TCM diagnostics, especially in the SARS ward, where medical staff has to closely defend themselves by as much physical separation of themselves from the patients as possible, it makes the feeling of pulse very difficult. So careful analysis of tongue picture becomes more important in confirming TCM Syndrome, revealing the developing rules of the disease, and promoting diagnosis and therapeutic level of IC-WM.",
