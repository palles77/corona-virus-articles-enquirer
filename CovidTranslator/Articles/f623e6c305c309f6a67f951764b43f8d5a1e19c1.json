            "text": "Virus infections are a major cause of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) exacerbations. Recently, Toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3) has been demonstrated to react to double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) and to be involved in the immune responses after viral infections. In the present study, we examined whether oxidative stress, which is involved in the pathogenesis of COPD, enhances the responses of TLR3 in airway epithelial cells. The effect of hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2 ) on the release of IL-8 from BEAS-2B cells and primary human bronchial epithelial cells after stimulation with polyinosinepolycytidylic acid [poly(I:C)], a synthetic analog of viral dsRNA and a ligand for TLR3, and the signal transduction were examined. One hundred to 150 mM H 2 O 2 significantly potentiated the release of IL-8 from the epithelial cells after stimulation with 10 mg/ml poly(I:C). The H 2 O 2 -augmented IL-8 release was inhibited by treatment with N-acetylcysteine. One hundred micromoles of H 2 O 2 enhanced the translocation of nuclear factor (NF)-kB p65, but not that of interferon regulatory factor-3 (IRF-3), into the nucleus and the NF-kB DNA binding activity after poly(I:C) stimulation, which effect was inhibited not by the silencing of IRF-3 but by MG132, a proteasome inhibitor, or dexamethasone. One hundred micromoles of H 2 O 2 potentiated the TLR3 expression on the airway epithelial cells treated with poly(I:C). These data suggest that oxidative stress augments the response of TLR3 in airway epithelial cells via NF-kB and that this effect might be partly mediated by the enhancement of TLR3 expression. Modulation of this pathway may be a therapeutic target for viral-induced exacerbations of COPD.",

Oxidants derived from cigarette smoke or released by inflammatory cells play a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of COPD (6) and, in fact, oxidative stress markers including hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2 ) are elevated in the airways of patients with COPD (8) (9) (10) (11) . During exacerbations, greater amounts of H 2 O 2 are produced in the airways of patients with COPD than those in the stable disease condition (12, 13) .

In addition, the role of Toll-like receptors (TLRs) in recognizing the pathogen-associated molecular patterns, including TLR3, TLR7, and TLR8, has been demonstrated in innate immunity (18, 19) . Especially, TLR3 reacts with viral-derived double-strand RNA (dsRNA) and is thought to play a key role in the viral infection in the respiratory system (20) (21) (22) . The expression of TLR3 has been detected on airway epithelial cells, dendric cells, and macrophages (20, 22) . When TLR3 is activated, both nuclear factor (NF)-kB and interferon regulatory factor-3 (IRF-3) are translocated into the nucleus and activate their DNA binding (18, 21, 23) . The former has been reported to regulate the expression of proinflammatory cytokines, including TNF-a, IL-1b, and the potent neutrophil chemoattractant IL-8 (24) . The latter regulates the expression of type I interferon (IFN) (23) . Although both oxidative stress and viral infection are involved in the exacerbations in COPD, it has been not elucidated whether oxidative stress potentiates the TLR signaling and mediator production.",

            "text": "To confirm whether human bronchial epithelial cells express TLR3, we first examined the expression of TLR3 by immunocytochemistry and immunoblotting. TLR3 was detected in BEAS-2B cells by immunocytochemistry ( Figure 1A ). TLR3 was detected at approximately 110 kD by immunoblotting in BEAS-2B cells and HBEpC as previously reported ( Figure 1B ). Next, we investigated the effect of the TLR3 ligand, poly(I:C) on the release of IL-8 from BEAS-2B cells. Poly(I:C) significantly increased the release of IL-8 from the epithelial cells in a dosedependent manner (Figure 2A ). TLR3 has been reported to exist in the endosome and to require an acidic environment for its activation. To confirm whether the effect of poly(I:C) was mediated through TLR, we used bafilomycin, which is an inhibitor of endosomal acidification. Bafilomycin dose-dependently inhibited the poly(I:C)-induced IL-8 release ( Figure 2B) . We examined the effect of other TLR ligands, including LPS(TLR4), R837(TLR7), and R848(TLR7/8), on the release of IL-8. LPS ( Figure 2C ), R837 ( Figure 2D ), or R848 ( Figure 2E ) had no effect on the release of IL-8 from the epithelial cells. To explore the mechanism for the H 2 O 2 -augmented IL-8 release in the poly(I:C)-treated cells, the effect of H 2 O 2 on the translocation of NF-kB and IRF-3 into the nucleus was evaluated. Treatment with H 2 O 2 caused a small but significant increase in NF-kB p65 translocation into the nucleus ( Figures  4A-4D) . However, H 2 O 2 significantly potentiated NF-kB p65 translocation into the nucleus in the presence of poly(I:C) in a time-and concentration-dependent manner (Figures 4A-4D) . The potentiation of NF-kB translocation was not observed after 24 hours of H 2 O 2 treatment ( Figure E2 ). H 2 O 2 also significantly potentiated NF-kB DNA binding activity in the presence of poly(I:C) ( Figure 4E ). Furthermore, pretreatment with MG132 significantly inhibited the H 2 O 2 -augmented IL-8 release in the poly(I:C)-treated cells ( Figure 4F) . Figures 5A and 5B ). Since there is no available inhibitor for IRF-3, siRNA, for IRF3 was used to estimate the inhibitory effect on the release of IL-8. Although treatment with siRNA eliminated the IRF-3 protein ( Figure 5C ), IRF-3 knockdown did not affect the H 2 O 2 -augmented IL-8 release in the poly(I:C)-treated cells ( Figure 5D ).",

These results suggest that the augmentation of IL-8 release by H 2 O 2 is due to the potentiation of poly(I:C)-induced NF-kB activation. In previous studies, H 2 O 2 has been reported not only to directly induce the NF-kB transcriptional activity (37) , but also enhance NF-kB activation in response to proinflammatory cytokines (38, 39) . The molecular mechanisms by which H 2 O 2 potentiates NF-kB signaling remain uncertain, but several possible mechanisms have been reported. Takada and coworkers showed that H 2 O 2 activates NF-kB through tyrosine phosphorylation of IkBa and serine phosphorylation of the p65 subunit of NF-kB (39) . Others have also reported that H 2 O 2 activates NF-kB via phosphorylation of serine residues in the IkB kinases (IKKs) (40) . Recently, H 2 O 2 has been reported to prolong nuclear localization of NF-kB in proinflammatory cytokine-activated cells by suppressing the negative regulation by IkBa and other proteases (41) . In our current study, H 2 O 2 -augmented NF-kB p65 translocation to the nucleus in poly(I:C)-treated cells continued until 120 minutes compared with the control, which might be consistent with the previous study (41) . We showed that poly(I:C) induced the translocation of IRF3 into the nucleus, but H 2 O 2 did not enhance this translocation. Further silencing of IRF-3 did not affect the potentiation of IL-8 release. Together, potentiation of IL-8 release is mainly mediated via NF-kB but not IRF-3 signaling.",

This result suggests that oxidative stress might affect the regulation of TLR3 expression. Previous reports have shown that poly(I:C) augments TLR3 expression in epithelial cells through a type I IFN-dependent mechanism (21, 42) . Oxidative stress also has been reported to enhance TLR3 expression in adult human astrocytes (43) . These reports might support the current results. Recently, increased TLR3 expression has been observed in airway epithelial cells from patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome in which airway cells are exposed to a hyperoxic condition (44) , suggesting that oxidative stress might modulate TLR3 expression. However, there have not been any studies to clarify the mechanism of this modulation in epithelial cells. In the current study, DEX did not affect the H 2 O 2 -potentiated TLR3 expression. This might suggest that steroid-sensitive signals such as NF-kB are not involved in the mechanism of H 2 O 2 -potentiated TLR3 expression. However, this mechanism remains unclear and further studies are needed.",

While the TLR3 expression was potentiated by H 2 O 2 at 16 hours or later, potentiation of the IL-8 release occurred at 4 to 8 hours or later. These results suggest that the potentiation of the IL-8 release by H 2 O 2 was mainly mediated by the potentiation of NF-kB activation. However, at 16 hours or later, the enhanced TLR3 expression might contribute to the potentiation of IL-8 release by H 2 O 2 .",

The inhibition of the IL-8 release by DEX in the H 2 O 2 -pretreated and poly(I:C)-exposed cells was less than in the vehicle-pretreated and poly(I:C)-exposed cells, suggesting that oxidative stress reduces the effect of steroid on the IL-8 release. The acquirement of steroid resistance under oxidative stress has been reported to occur in macrophages and epithelial cells via inactivation of histone deacetylase 2 (HDAC2) (34, 45) . This inactivation of HDAC2 by oxidative stress might explain our result that DEX was less effective in the H 2 O 2 -treated cells.",

They demonstrated that a catalase inhibitor, aminotriazole, increased the production of reactive oxygen species in murine neutrophils and attenuated LPS-induced acute lung injury in a murine model. This effect was due to the alleviation of NF-kB activity and proinflammatory cytokine production in neutrophils. The discrepancy from our current results might be explained as follows. First, we administered H 2 O 2 exogenously to the airway epithelial cells, whereas they evaluated the role of endogenously produced H 2 O 2 by the inhibition of catalase in the reactive oxygen species production from neutrophils. Moreover, the inhibition of catalase might affect the antioxidant system, including glutathione and superoxide dismutase. Second, they evaluated the role of catalase inhibition in NF-kB signaling and proinflammatory cytokine production in murine neutrophils. We assessed the role of H 2 O 2 in NF-kB signaling and IL-8 production in human bronchial epithelial cells. Differences in the species and cell type might have affected the results. Third, we assessed TLR3 signaling in the current study. They showed the effect of catalase inhibition on lung inflammation induced by LPS treatment. In general, LPS stimulates TLR4; therefore, the discrepancies in the results might be due to the difference in activated TLRs.",

In the current study, we used 100 ng/ml LPS to stimulate IL-8 release in BEAS-2B cells. Therefore, the lack of augmentation in IL-8 release by LPS could be due to the difference in the LPS concentration. In a recent report, Koff and coworkers have shown that TLR1/2, TLR5, and TLR6/2 ligands augment IL-8 release, albeit to a lesser extent than TLR3 stimulation in human bronchial epithelial cells (50) . Therefore, not only TLR3 ligand but also other TLR ligands could stimulate IL-8 release in human bronchial epithelial cells.

Pretreatment with H 2 O 2 potentiated the poly(I:C)-augmented IL-8 release, and the antioxidant NAC reversed this potentiation, suggesting that oxidative stress potentiates the dsRNA-induced IL-8 release from human bronchial epithelial cells. We also showed that H 2 O 2 potentiated the poly(I:C)-induced NF-kB translocation, not IRF-3, into the nucleus and NF-kB DNA binding activity, and suppression of NF-kB by MG132 inhibited the H 2 O 2 -potentiated IL-8 release in the poly(I:C)-treated cells. Furthermore, treatment with H 2 O 2 plus poly(I:C) increased the TLR3 expression compared with the basal condition. These H 2 O 2 -mediated potentiations of the TLR3 responses were also confirmed in primary human airway epithelial cells. These data suggest that oxidative stress potentiates the poly(I:C)augmented IL-8 release in airway epithelial cells through NF-kB activation, and this potentiation might be partly explained by the increased TLR3 expression.",
