Various studies have been carried out to analyse the prevalence of pathogens in wild boar populations and the role of these populations as reservoir for pathogens or a source of infection for domestic pigs (Kaden et al. 2009 ). Wild boar (Sus scrofa) populations are found in many regions worldwide. The role of wild boar as a reservoir of some viruses, and thus a possible source of infection for domestic swine and other domestic animals, is still unclear. However, there are reports on the epidemiological association between wild boar and domestic animals in some viral diseases and movement of these animals can potentially result in dissemination of these diseases (\u017dupan\u010di\u010d et al. 2002) . Currently, there is no recorded data regarding prevalence and distribution of the most important infectious agents among wild boars in Turkey. Therefore, our objective was to determine the seroprevalence against selected infectious pathogens in wild boars from northern Turkey.",

In this study, serum samples were collected from 93 hunter-killed wild boars that were harvested during the 2012 hunting season in northern Turkey (Samsun and Gumushane provinces) which has the suitable geographical conditions, including agricultural area and forest for wildlife (Fig. 1) . Sex was determined (38 males and 55 females) and also age was determined using tooth eruption patterns, and animals were grouped into two age classes: 13 to <24 months old (31 subadults) and >24 months old (62 adults). Blood was collected from the heart, centrifuged at 1,200\u00d7g for 15 min, serum removed, and stored at \u221220\u00b0C. The commercial enzymelinked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kits were obtained from ID.vet Innovative Diagnostics, Montpellier, France for swine vesicular disease virus (SVDV), hepatitis E virus (HEV), swine influenza virus (SIV), Aujeszky's disease virus (ADV) and African swine fever virus (ASFV), and from PRIONICS, Lelystad, Netherlands for classical swine fever virus (CSFV) and porcine parvovirus (PPV), and INGENASA, Madrid, Spain for porcine rotavirus (PRV), porcine respiratory coronavirus (PRCV) and transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), and IDEXX, Bern, Switzerland for bovine viral diarrhoea virus (BVDV) and porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) and the tests were performed according to the producer's description. Plates were read with an ELISA reader at 450 and 650 nm for ID. vet, PRIONICS, INGENASA and IDEXX kits, respectively. Determined OD values were calculated.",

Adult wild boar displayed higher seroprevalences of ADV, BVDV and PPV, whereas it was higher in subadults for PRRSV. The seroprevalence detected in this study for ADV is similar between Samsun and Gumushane provinces, and also for PRV it is similar between adults and subadults. No differences between sexes were observed. The use of the Chi-square test to determine significance of ADV and BVDV were more common in adults than subadults (p<0.01), ( Table 2 ).

Out of the 12 viral diseases, antibodies to five viruses were found in the investigated populations, however, with differences between the individual populations. It is not surprising that PRV is widespread in our wild boar populations (seroprevalence rate, 69.9 %), and that its seroprevalence rate differs significantly from those of the other viruses tested. Most animals tested positive for PRV were derived from Samsun (85.2 %). Although there has been no extensive report on the presence of porcine rotavirus in wild boars, Svensmark (1983) found antibodies against porcine rotavirus (64.2 %) in swine herds in Denmark.",

BVD is prevalent in cattle in Turkey . From our results, it is evident that wild boars in the northern Turkey are rarely exposed to this infection. Cross-reaction with CSFV can be excluded because all sera were negative for this virus. However, it is possible that antibodies relate to exposure to a related pestivirus other than BVDV (e.g. border disease virus). In Germany, the Czech Republic and Croatia, the reported prevalence of BVDV antibodies in wild boar is 0.8, 0.6 and 4.5 %, respectively (Dahle et al. 1993; \u017dupan\u010di\u010d et al. 2002; Sedlak et al. 2008 ).
