            "text": "Emerging infectious diseases such as SARS and the bioterror attacks with anthrax spores that occurred after September 11th, 2001 have highlighted the need to be better prepared for the detection and management of infectious pathogens that threaten public health. Negative staining electron microscopy is one method used to screen environmental and clinical samples for relevant infectious pathogens. Unfortunately, bacterial endospores, like those of Bacillus anthracis, are difficult to identify using this method because of their density that prevents imaging of structural details. Thin section electron microscopy would be an alternative method but this usually requires a few days for preparation and diagnosis. In the present paper we describe the development of a rapid thin section protocol, using mainly Bacillus subtilis spores as a model, which allows an unequivocal diagnosis of endospores within 2 h. The protocol involves chemical fixation assisted by heat or microwaves, rapid dehydration, embedding in the low-viscosity resin LR White and chemically enhanced polymerization. Structural preservation of spores is comparable to preservation after standard Epon embedding. Immunolabeling experiments using B. atrophaeus spores and a specific antibody suggest that the protocol preserves significant antigenicity for on-section immunocytochemistry and therefore offers the possibility for the strain typing of spores using specific antibodies. Further experiments with vegetative bacteria, viruses and cell cultures indicate that the rapid thin section protocol not only preserves spores but also other biological structures. Because of its universality and speed the described protocol complements negative staining electron microscopy as a front line method for the morphology-based diagnosis of pathogens in environmental and clinical samples.",

In particular, negative staining electron microscopy is used to visualize the causative agent of infectious diseases in certain clinical and environmental samples. The method is quick and involves the adsorption of particles in a suspension onto a particular support followed by staining with a heavy metal salt and drying. Transmission electron microscopy of such preparations allows a diagnosis to the group or family level based on morphological criteria without the need for any specific primers or antibodies that limit the diagnostic spectrum. Even viruses and bacteria that are not on the list for routine diagnostics or are genetically modified to avoid detection can therefore be identified within a few tens of minutes. The value of the method was recently demonstrated during the SARS epidemic where diagnostic electron microscopy gave the first indications that the causative virus was a member of the coronavirus family (WHO, 2003) .",

However, negative staining electron microscopy is limited to small particles, depending on their density and the acceleration voltage of the electron microscope. Bacterial endospores, such as those of B. anthracis and related strains, are too dense to allow visualization of structural details other than size and form with negative staining electron microscopy ( Fig. 1) , which prevents their reliable diagnosis.",

This method produces thin sections of a sample that are transparent enough for the electron beam, and visualizes the internal ultrastructure in the transmission electron microscope (see for an overview Bozzola and Russell, 1998) . In the case of bacterial endospores, the particular structural signature, i.e. the complex coat structures that surround the dense membranebound spore core (Setlow, 2005) , can provide an unequivocal diagnosis. However, a major drawback of this method is the comparatively long preparation time using standard protocols, which usually requires several days. Much effort has therefore been invested in reducing the processing time. For instance, increasing the curing temperature of resin polymerization reduces the processing time significantly (Doane et al., 1974) and the use of microwaves allows better heat distribution in the sample and could have non-thermal effects, which increases the rate of diffusion and/or the speed of chemical reactions (Kok and Boon, 1990; Leong and Sormunen, 1998) . In all, the total processing time from native sample to a microscopic diagnosis can be reliably reduced to about 3-4 h (Giberson et al., 2003; Schr\u00f6der et al., 2006) or even less (Gove et al., 1990) using optimized methods. Most protocols use epoxy resin as an embedding medium, often in conjunction with osmium tetroxide post-fixation, which provides a good representation of the ultrastructure but usually does not preserve antigenicity sufficiently for on-section immunocytochemistry.",

Our strategy involved reducing the sample size and using the low-viscosity acrylic resin LR White (Newman et al., 1982) , which efficiently reduced both the diffusion time during dehydration and infiltration with the resin. In addition, the polymerization speed of LR White was drastically increased by the use of a chemical accelerator (Newman and Hobot, 1987) . These changes, together with an improved method for chemical fixation, reduced the total processing time for spores that have significant diffusion barriers (Driks, 1999) and are therefore difficult to process to about 2 h including diagnosis. The paper describes and evaluates the rapid LR White embedding protocol using bacterial endospores and other samples, including virus and cell cultures.",

The spore core appeared round and the delimiting membrane was preserved. Outer and inner spore coats could be distinguished.

Fixation for at least 12 h (1 h at room temperature and the remainder at 4\u00b0C) served as a control. Remarkably, variation was seen in the preservation of control samples between experiments (Table 1, No. 1.1, 2.1, 3.1, 4.1, 5.1). In order to rule out the possibility that depolymerization of the formaldehyde by heat was incomplete, depolymerization by microwaves was compared with depolymerization by heat in one experiment. One beneficial effect of the microwave fixation might be the efficient depolymerization of formaldehyde polymers (Giberson and Elliott, 2001 ) that usually form in formaldehyde solutions (Griffiths, 1993) . However, no differences in structural preservation could be detected using the two depolymerization procedures ( A sufficient and reliable preservation of spore ultrastructure was achieved using 5 min of pre-fixation at room temperature followed by a step-wise increase of temperature to 50\u00b0C in a microwave oven ( 3) microwave-assisted fixation temperatures were also unable to effectively preserve spore ultrastructure. The spores that were heated to 60\u00b0C, although having round non-compressed cores, had no visible membranes or even in many cases showed blebs. However, heating the spore suspension to 50\u00b0C in a water bath resulted in a degree of structural preservation acceptable for diagnostic purposes. Spore coats remained intact and the core membrane was visible in most of the spores (96%, n = 108). However, the cores of many spores (\u2248 70%) showed some degree of deformation (Fig. 3D) .",

Because of their inherent speed, microwave-assisted preparation protocols in particular have been developed and widely applied to diagnostic thin section electron microscopy (Kok and Boon, 1990; Leong and Sormunen, 1998; Giberson et al., 2003) . In this paper we described a rapid and rather simple protocol using LR White as a resin that allows the diagnosis of bacterial endospores within 2 h. All the relevant details of spore ultrastructure (spore core and coats) could be distinguished, although it should be noted that the appearance of these structures was somewhat unconventional, as the particular on-section staining method used (Roth et al., 1990) gives a mixture of positive and negative contrast. However, providing the characteristic signature of bacterial endospores is preserved, unequivocal diagnosis is straightforward. This has been Processing time is given for 1-2 samples. impressively demonstrated by the diagnosis of spores in mummies at least 1000 years old (Hino et al., 1982; Pabst et al., 2005) . Recently, Schr\u00f6der et al. (2006) described a rapid Eponembedding protocol for spores that uses microwaves in many of the incubation steps and that results in virtually the same structural appearance of spores as that after conventional processing. Nevertheless, already the embedding protocol takes 3 h 15 min, resulting in total processing times well over 4 htoo long for a first diagnosis needed to assess the risk posed by a sample. In some cases even the 2 h protocol presented in this paper may be too long. However, there is little room for further improving the processing time for thin section electron microscopy because the individual preparation steps have now been optimized to the point that handling times (changing solutions, transferring samples, ultramicrotomy) now contribute significantly to the time needed. Reducing dehydration, infiltration and microwave times may gain a few minutes and the polymerization times for the acrylic resins could also be reduced using microwaves alone (Giammara, 1993) or in combination with a chemical accelerator (Hillmer et al., 1991) . In all, a further reduction of 15-20 min might be possible and this will be evaluated in the future.",

We initially used a high concentration of formaldehyde in conjunction with a low concentration of glutaraldehyde for at least 2 h at room temperature because this procedure not only results in acceptable structural preservation but also inactivates the spores (Gelderblom et al., 2007) . In an attempt to reduce this time we tried microwave-assisted chemical fixation using the same fixative, resulting, after several trials, in a protocol involving 5 min pre-fixation at room temperature followed by heating to 50\u00b0C for 10 min in the microwave oven. This protocol is very similar to that used by Schr\u00f6der et al. (2006) to process the various samples in their study although they used a modified Karnovsky fixative (1% paraformaldehyde, 2.5% glutaraldehyde in cacodylate buffer, pH 7.3) for 15 or 20 min at 50\u00b0C in the same microwave oven. In contrast, studies with other samples have used microwave-assisted fixation times of a few minutes or even seconds (Gove et al., 1990; Giberson and Demaree, 1995; Login et al., 1995) . In our study, however, shorter times for microwave-assisted fixation, with or without higher microwave power, failed to preserve spore ultrastructure, probably due to the unusual characteristics of spores (i.e coats and low water content) or even to the microwave oven used.",

Structural preservation of Jurkat cells processed with the rapid thin section embedding protocol using LR White (2.5 \u03bcl accelerator per ml monomer). A. View of a typical cell with the morphology of a lymphocyte. The central nucleus (n) is surrounded by a thin layer of cytoplasm with only few organelles, such as mitochondria (mi) and endosomes (e). B. Nuclear membrane (nm) with nuclear pores (np). The cytoplasm contains bundles of microfilaments (arrow). C. Mitochondria displaying their inner membrane system. D. A centriole with the typical triplet organization of microtubules (9 \u00d7 3). Bar in A = 1 \u03bcm and in B, C, D = 0.2 \u03bcm. this paper. The protocol will serve as the basis for further studies addressing the strain typing of endospores from environmental samples using morphological criteria alone or in conjunction with strain-specific antibodies. Strain-typing using antibodies is particularly attractive because sectioning exposes both external and internal antigens, increasing the number of potential targets for strain-specific antibodies. In conclusion, the new protocol described here should provide a much-needed improvement for the diagnosis of environmental samples in the practical setting.",
