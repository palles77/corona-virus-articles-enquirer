This work creates a foundation of new knowledge that provides critical insights around the world's most deadly infectious diseases, and it can lay groundwork for the future development of new diagnostics, medicines, and vaccines. Almost all such research can be performed in ways that pose negligible or no risk of epidemic or global spread of a novel pathogen. However, research that aims to create new potential pandemic pathogens (PPP) (1)-novel microbes that combine likely human virulence with likely efficient transmission in humans-is an exception to that rule. While this research represents a tiny portion of the experimental work done in infectious disease research, it poses extraordinary potential risks to the public.",

Yet a rigorous and transparent risk assessment process for this work has not yet been established. This is why we support the recently announced moratorium on funding new \"gain-offunction\" (GOF) experiments that enhance mammalian transmissibility or virulence in severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), and influenza viruses. This realm of work roughly corresponds with the work we have termed PPP above. Because the term \"gain of function\" in other contexts can be used to describe techniques of scientific research that have nothing to do with the creation of novel potential pandemic pathogens, we think the term can be too broad and can mislead. Throughout this commentary, we focus on research designed to create PPP strains of influenza virus, the type of research that initially attracted attention, leading to the moratorium and for which the most discussion has already occurred. Other types of gain-of-function research on influenza and studies intended to enhance pathogenicity or transmissibility of MERS and SARS coronaviruses may or may not fit the definition of PPP research and further clarification is needed and ongoing. As we discuss near the end of this article, it will be essential to clarify the different risks and benefits entailed by different types of experiments covered by the funding pause (2) .",

In particular, it does not affect disease surveillance or vaccine development programs.

Doing and funding science constitute a process of severe winnowing (especially severe in today's tight funding climate) in which we choose to pursue one approach and not to pursue others based on judgments of which approaches are expected to have the lowest cost, highest probability of success, and greatest yield of valuable findings, among other considerations. Implicit in this process is the idea of opportunity cost.

We decide how to allocate our time and funding among possible approaches, devoting resources to the portfolio of efforts that seems most promising.

From the perspective of public health and the practical goal of preventing and treating flu, alternative approaches include those which, like PPP experiments, seek to enhance our scientific understanding of biology, pathogenesis, and transmission. Alternatives also include efforts to develop treatments and prevention measures, including surveillance, through means other than improving our basic biological understanding of influenza (4). This approach is shown graphically in Fig. 1 , which also depicts the risks of PPP research. Such risks should be weighed against the risks of alternatives, which are typically much smaller or even negligible.

Lists of mutations, and even phenotypes, associated with PPP studies can be compiled and compared against isolates of influenza viruses from birds and other nonhuman sources (16) . We know that these lists are unreliable and can even be misleading: the mutations in hemagglutinin identified by two prominent PPP experiments with H5N1 do not reliably confer human receptor specificity even for other H5N1 viruses (17) . The E627K mutation in the PB2 gene, known as a virulence and transmissibility determinant before GOF experiments (16, 18, 19) , found repeatedly in GOF experiments in H5N1 (20, 21) , and used for pandemic risk assessment in H7 viruses (16) , was found in some isolates of the H1N1pdm strain in 2009, leading to concern about possible increased virulence and transmissibility. Yet it conferred neither trait in this genetic background (22) . At this time, the high levels of epistasis-dependence of phenotype on the genetic background in which a mutation is foundmake prediction of pandemic risk for any given strain more of an art than a science. Indeed, the very presumption that we will see human cases of an incipient pandemic before that pandemic occurs has never been met in practice (23): we have never observed zoonotic cases of any flu virus before it caused a pandemic. This is not to deny that PPP experiments provide any useful data for surveillance and prioritization. Rather, it is to say that other approaches can also identify such predictors (as in the case of the PB2 mutation [11, 13, 14] ) and that the ability to use markers of putative transmissibility or virulence to make reliable predictions remains far in the future (23) . The fact that some analysts consider mutations identified in PPP experiments when assessing threats of viruses found in surveillance does not mean that the use of such mutations improves the predictions, a claim for which we have no evidence because no pandemic strain has ever been identified in advance. The analysis of benefits of PPP creation should reflect this state of science.",

This could not be definitively proven without doing the PPP experiment to manufacture a potentially pandemic variant of H5N1 (24) . While it is now undeniable that ferret-transmissible mutants of influenza A/H5N1 can be created experimentally, the impact on scientific opinion about the risk of a pandemic from H5N1 has been hard to gauge. Prior to the gain-of-function experiments, there was a wide range of expert opinion on the likelihood of an H5N1 pandemic (25) . Some influenza experts questioned whether H5N1 was a major pandemic threat. After the publication of the experiments producing potentially pandemic H5N1, one prominent member of this group, Peter Palese, noted the shortcomings of the ferret model for humans and correctly concluded that the question of whether H5N1 can transmit efficiently in people remains unsettled (11), as it must until the phenomenon is directly observed in nature. From a practical perspective, responsible policy makers and public health leaders should have been planning for the possibility of an H5N1 pandemic before PPP experiments on H5N1 were undertaken. In some countries of the world, they were stockpiling vaccines against H5N1 (26, 27) and making plans for nonpharmaceutical (8) interventions in the event of a pandemic. The same remains true after the experiments. We have observed no discernible influence of the H5N1 PPP experiments on H5N1 policy preparations.",

To establish methodologies and approaches for risk assessment and risk mitigation for this context, it would be valuable to start with a global assessment of the risks and benefits of this realm of research, identifying the common aspects of risk and benefit within PPP experiments and other approaches covered in the funding pause. For example, any risk assessment should include estimates of the probabilities of accidental infection and extensive spread, as well as estimates of the impacts of these events should they occur. The specific values of these estimated parameters will differ for different types of experiments. It will then be necessary to set standards and expectations for the quality and characteristics of risk-benefit assessments for individual experiments, for example, to distinguish coronavirus research from influenza research, enhancements of pathogenicity from enhancements of transmissibility, and other important distinctions. Given that the term \"risk assessment\" is used to mean different things by different people, an agreement on an approach to individual risk assessments would be needed to ensure rigor and credibility. Once this kind of analytic structure is established, individual risk assessments for GOF experiments that meet the definition in the new USG policy (3) should become the norm before such experiments are funded. Crucially, this process should be quantitative, rather than relying on unquantified and unverifiable assurances that particular laboratories are safe.",

There may be research endeavors that are subject to the moratorium that have a risk-benefit profile sufficiently favorable to justify their resumption once risks and benefits have been explicitly set forth.

The benefits (squares) of spending a fixed quantity of resources on a portfolio of activities, including PPP research (red), other approaches to influenza virus virology (green), and other public health activities to defeat influenza (yellow), should be weighed against the benefits of a portfolio in which the other activities are expanded to use the resources freed by not supporting PPP activities, reflecting the opportunity cost of the PPP research. If there are net benefits to including PPP activities in the portfolio, then they should be weighed against the net risks created by PPP experiments, which in the case of influenza transmissibility enhancement, we have argued (see the main text, Risk Analysis) are exceptionally high. The balance may differ for other activities, but this comparison of benefits of portfolios with and without gain-of-function experiments is the appropriate comparison, with any net benefits weighed against net risks. univ, universal.",
