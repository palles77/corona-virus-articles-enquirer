The mixture was stirred for 15-20 min to give a clear solution. After being stirred at room temperature for 20 h, the reaction was concentrated and the resultant gummy residue was partitioned between ethyl acetate (500 ml) and cold 5 N HCl (500 ml). The aqueous phase was extracted with more ethyl acetate, the combined organic solution was washed with 1 N HCl (300 ml), saturated NaCl (300 ml) and dried over MgS0 4 . Concentration of the solution gave a pale yellow solid; it was triturated with CH 2 C1 2 (200 ml), cooled to 0\u00b0C and then filtered off. Washing with CH 2 Cl 2 (2x50 ml) and drying in vacuo afforded 21.0 g of the desired benzophenone 5a as a white solid. The mother liquor afforded additional 2.1 g of the product.
