Cytotoxic T-cells also recognise carbohydrate (Ertl and Ada, 1981) and it has been suggested that genes in the major histocompatibility complex code for glycosyl transferases, which attach specific oligosaccharides to viral proteins to render them antigenic (Blanden et al., 1976) . The glycoproteins of the viral envelope are also expressed on the cell surface but in addition antigens not normally accessible at the surface of the virion can be found in the cell membrane. The matrix protein of influenza virus has been reported to be expressed at low levels on the cell surface (Hackett et al., 1980) and in feline leukaemia virus infections a novel antigen consisting of the glycosalated, internal antigen, precursor protein is expressed on the plasma membrane (Neil et al., 1980) .",

In curve A an immediate decrease in the surviving fraction is observed with the same proportion of virus being neutralised in a given time interval. This pattern of 'one hit' kinetics has been taken to indicate that only a single antibody molecule is required to neutralise each virus particle. However when the same neutralisation reactions are conducted at low antibody concentrations, or low temperature, a change in the curve occurs with a lag in the onset of rapid neutralisation. This lag phase is consistent with a model proposed by Meynell and Meynell (1970) However the mechanism of neutralisation may be more complex as some evidence suggests that neutralised influenza virus adsorbs to, and uncoats in suitable host cells but transcription of the viral genome does not occur (Dimmock and Possee, 1981) . It has been suggested that virus-antibody complexes may activate cellular nucleases and this may account for the neutralisation of virus once it has entered a cell (Mandel, 1967) .",

This levelling off of virus neutralisation can be pronounced leaving a persistent fraction (Fig. 2) . Persistent fractions are more frequently observed with low avidity antibody, occurring early after infection or immunisation. This antibody disassociates from the virus-antibody complexes on dilution leading to reactivation of the virus (Lafferty, 1963) . It has been suggested that persistent fractions can also arise when the virus forms aggregates in which some virions are unavailable to the neutralising antibody. However persistent fractions have been observed when monodispersed virus and high avidity antibody have been used in the neutralisation reaction. Under these conditions the addition of further immunoglobulin to the persistent fraction does not result in additional neutralisation but when a Fab fragment is employed further neutralisation occurs (Ashe et al., 1969) . A reasonable interpretation is that the smaller Fab fragment is able to reach sites on the virion inaccessible to the larger intact immunoglobulin. This stearic inhibition of neutralising antibody could occur through the binding of antibody to non-critical sites leaving the critical sites available to interact with the host cell (Fig. 2) .",

The binding of C3b to the virion may also play an important role in the removal of the immune complexes by the phagocytic cell system whilst the anaphylatoxin C3a, generated during the cleavage of C3, promotes an inflammatory response that appears to be important in limiting the cell to cell spread of herpesviruses and paramyxoviruses.",

(M~ller-Eberhard and GStze, 1972 It has been suggested that the alternative pathway is constantly 'ticking over' resulting in the random deposition of complement (Lachmann and Nicol, 1973) . Whether or not a continued deposition of C3b occurs on a paticular surface will be dependent on the extent that the bound C3b is available to factor H (Pangburn et al., 1980) . This hypothesis is illustrated in figure 3 in which the C3b binding site on \"activating surfaces\" masks or inactivates the factor H binding site and allows the formation of C3bBb. Activation of the alternative pathway in the absence of immunoglobu~in by virus infected (Sissons et al., 1980) and virus transformed cells (Budzko et al., 1976; McConnell et al., 1978) has been reported recently. Although activation of complement occurred without antibody, lysis of a range of human cells infected with enveloped viruses required both an intact alternative pathway and an anti-viral IgG. Even in the absence of lysis C3b coated cells could become susceptible to damage by phagocytic cells (Fig. 4C ).",

In these circumstances the virus is still able to spread from cell to cell through fusion of adjacent plasma membranes since anti-F antibody is necessary to inhibit this activity (Fig. 5B ) (Merz et al., 1980) . Furthermore in the absence of anti-F antibody continued HN antigen presentation will occur in the form of virus released from the expanding syncitia. Antigen-antibody-complement complexes formed during this process may account for the immunopathological responses that have been observed in respiratory syncitial (RS) and measles virus infections (Chatterji and Mankad, 1977; Kim et al., 1969) . Interestingly the severest pneumonia in RS virus infections occurs in children with the highest neutralising antibody titres (Chanock et al., 1970) and RSV induced disease in cattle has been suggested to have an immunopathological component (Kim, 1977) .",

It has been estimated that up to 10% of T-cells may specifically react with any foreign haplotype (Dutton, 1966; Swain et al., 1979) . This high degree of MHC polymorphism and associated alloreactivity presumably has an important role in governing the response to antigens. Thirdly, it is becoming clear that T-cells specific for a particular antigen bear idiotypes identical to antibodies specific for the same antigen (Binz and Wigzell, 1977) . At least part of the T-cell antigen receptor repetoire is, therefore, probably encoded by VH genes. However, unlike the VH genes expressed on B-cells which, it is believed, can be the products of somatic mutation during ontogeny, the VH genes of T-cells may be limited to those encoded in the germ line. This may account for the failure to observe an increase in the affinity of the T-cell receptor for antigen during the development of the immune response (Krawinkel et al., 1978) .",

ANTIBODY DEPENDENT CELL MEDIATED CYTOTOXICITY INTRODUCTION Since the immune system has evolved primarily as a defense against infectious agents it is not surprising to find that the full repertoire of this system can be evoked by viruses. Although there is considerable interaction between the elements of the immune response, it is convenient to distinguish between humoral and cell-mediated components. The most rapidly developing humoral and cell-mediated responses are represented by primordal arms of the immune system, the alternative pathway of complement and natural killer cells. A slightly later developing response, T-cell mediated cytotoxicity, acts to eliminate virus infected cells and it is often the major determinent in recovery from primary infections by enveloped viruses. The antibody response can also be an important element in recovery from primary infections but in addition the neutralising antibody response forms the major barrier to reinfection by viruses. 2. VIRUS STRUCTURE AND ANTIGENS 2.1 Structural types Although there are approximately 20 well defined groups of animal viruses there are only a limited number of structural types. The smaller viruses exhibit the simplest structure in which nucleic acid either RNA or DNA is surrounded by a protein coat called the capsid. In most of the DNA viruses, and in the smaller RNA vlruses, the capsids are icosahedral in shape and therefore display cubic symmetry. The capsids are composed of repeated structural units or capsomeres which, in turn consist of a few viral coded proteins. The larger RNA viruses have a different arrangement of the capsid, the capsomeres being wound around the nucleic acid to form a long helical structure known as the nucleocapsid (Fig. I). The nucleocapsids of the viruses with helical symmetry and some viruses with cubic symmetry, like the togaviruses and herpes viruses, are surrounded by an envelope derived from a modified cell membrane. This is acquired as the virions (virus particles) are liberated through the plasma membrane, or in the case of the herpes viruses as they pass through the nuclear membrane. The phospholipid, glycolipid and cholesterol components of the envelope are derived from the host cell but relatively little (0.5 to 1.0%) of host protein remains in the envelope. Amongst the remaining host proteins actin has been identified in some virus envelopes and histocompatibility",

Once inside the cell the virus sheds it protein coat releasing the nucleic acid. The genome of the virus now directs the synthesis of a variety of proteins which are required for replication of viral nucleic acid and for incorporation into new structural components of the virions. When sufficient concentrations of proteins and nucleic acids have been made they are assembled into progeny virus particles. After assembly the progeny virions are released from the cell over a period which varies with the virus type. In general, the non-enveloped viruses are released rapidly, a process which results in lysis and death of the cell. Furthermore as viral coded proteins are not found in the cell membrane the immune response is not directed against infected cells but is predominantly a humoral response against extracellular viruses. (Fig. i). 3.2 Enveloped virus infections Entry of enveloped virus is again dependent on the presence of cell receptors on the virus and these take the form of glycoprotein spikes projecting from the surface of the envelope. Release of enveloped viruses occurs through a budding process at the cell membrane and as in non-enveloped viruses this may result in lysis and rapid death of the cell. However, for some enveloped viruses like paramyxoviruses, release of the virus may take place over several days without much evidence of cell destruction. This is seen in extreme form in the retroviruses, in which infected cells may continuously release virus without any effect on cellular function. For the enveloped viruses, virus coded proteins are present in the cell membrane before the release of virions. Consequently the immune system, can recognise and eliminate virus infected cells before the release and spread of virus occurs. (Fig. i).",

This is indicated by the transition of the neutralisation curve to a linear pattern.(Fig. 2B).Two main lines of evidence support the contention that for most viruses neutralisation is dependent on binding several antibody molecules. Firstly infectious antigen antibody complexes occur which can be neutralised by the addition of anti-immunoglobulin or by the addition of the early acting components of complement(Oldstone 1975). Secondly antibodies directed at different determinants on the virion surface act synergistically in neutralisation.Not all the determinants on the surface of a virion are necessarily involved in neutralisation and one can make the distinction between critical and non-critical sites for neutralisation(Fig. 2). In influenza virus the envelope contains multiple units of haemagglutinin and neuraminidase antigens(Fig. 1). The critical sites for neutralisation in this virus are the haemagglutinin spikes whilst the neuraminidase spikes play little or no role in neutraliation. The haemagglutinins of influenza virus are required for binding and entry into the host cell and in a simple model one can envisage that a majority of these receptor molecules must be coated to strearically inhibit the virus from binding to its target(Fig. 2).",

The F or fusion protein is responsible for syncitium formation. In measles infected cells IgG bound to either the F protein or the H protein can result in lysis (Fig. 4.D). F(ab') 2 fragments but not Fab' fragments can also produce lysis. This requirement for divalence indicates that patching of the viral antigen and possibly therefore 'focusing' of the target area is required for effective lysis(Perrin et al., 1976). viral antigen continues so that it is eventually stripped off the cell surface (Joseph andOldstone, 1975). This modulation of the virus antigen on the cell surface results in lower levels of antigen expression and increases the probability that the cell will escape immune destruction.The modulation of surface antigens by antibody in measles infected cells has an additional, intriguing effect on antigen expression.Not only is the expression of surface antigens affected but there is a specific decrease in intracellular viral protein concentrations and a change in protein phosphorylation(Fujinami and Oldstone, 1979).(Fig. 5A). It has not been determined if these changes are due to increased degradation or decreased synthesis but the clear implication is that the immune response can modify the net production of viral proteins. It is possible that these processes may be a more general phenomenon involved in the establishment of latent infections.The specificity of antibody can also influence the fate of the infected cell.In paramyxovirus infections antibody to the HN (or H) protein can neutralise the virus by preventing virus adsorbtion.

ANTIBODY DEPENDENT CELL MEDIATED CYTOTOXICITY Like complement mediated cytotoxicity, antibody dependent cell mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) is directed at the virus infected cell. Specificity in the cytotoxic response is provided by IgG bound to the target, whilst the effector component is an Fc bearing mononuclear cell often referred to as a k-cell.

The extent of release of the label over the 4-6 hours of the assay can be used to quantitate the degree of cytotoxicity. From studies with these in vitro assays it is clear that the lytic process involves direct contact between the effector and target cell, followed (in T-cells) by an activation step associated with the production of membrane damage (Henney, 1973). 7.1 Natural killer cells Natural killer cells are a population of non-adherent mononuclear cells which exhibit spontaneous cytoxicity against a range of cell lines including normal cells, tumour cells and virus infected cells.

CYTOTOXlC T-CELL RESPONSE The first indications that cell mediated response is important in recovery from viral infection came from studies of immunodeficient patients.

Indeed identity between the MHC products of the effector and target cell is not necessary under displayed on the thymic epithelium during T-cell development in that organ. Consequently when irradiated A strain mice are reconstituted with (A x B) FI bone marrow cells, the cytotoxic T-cells which develop in the chimaeras only recognise and lyse virus infected cells of strain A.
