NS3 contains an N-terminal domain with protease activity and a C-terminal domain with helicase activity. The two domains communicate with each other along with other HCV and cellular proteins. Herein we show that RNAs can bind directly to the active site cleft of the NS3 protease domain (NS3P) and inhibit proteolysis of peptide substrates. RNAs that are less apt to form intramolecular structures have a stronger inhibitory activity than RNAs with more stable base paired regions. Two mutations in the protease domain that resulted in decreased affinity to ssRNA were also defective in RNA-induced ATPase activity from the helicase domain of NS3. The coordinated effects on inhibition of protease activity and stimulation of ATPase activity raise the possibility that RNA serves as a regulatory switch for the two processes.",

Although NS3 possesses proteolytic activity, substrate cleavage is dramatically enhanced by NS4A (Kwong et al., 2008; Lam and Frick, 2006; Yan et al., 1998; Yao et al., 1999) . The NS3 protease activity is also involved in counteracting cellular antiviral defense pathways by cleavage of the adaptor protein named MAVS (also known as IPS-1, CARDIF, and VISA) that is activated by cytoplasmic RNA sensors RIG-I and MDA5 (Meylan et al., 2005) .

Stringent washes were used to remove noncovalently-bound materials and the crosslinked peptides were eluted by heating the sample. MALDI-ToF was then used to identify the masses of the peptides. Resin that lacked RNA, or NS3 incubated with the RNA-resin but not crosslinked with formaldehyde produced much lower signals for peptides (Inset to Fig. 1C ).",

We reasoned that G9-1 also binds to the active site of NS3P in a manner similar to the RNAs that we have used. To better map the regions in NS3P that contacts the 67-nt G9-1, the RCAP assay was used. However, lithium chloride was used to selectively co-precipitate the conjugated peptides. This alternative RNA precipitation method was previously used to map peptides that can bind longer RNAs (Hema et al., 2010; Vaughan et al., 2012; Yi et al., 2009b ). An overlapping subset of peptides to those that bound to the 27nt RNA was observed as well as additional ones (Fig. 1E ). G9-1 also was crosslinked to additional peptides in both the protease and helicase domains. However, given that G9-1 is larger than our previous probe, this result is to be expected.",

This assay takes advantage of the fact that S-methyl thioacetimidate can specifically modify exposed lysines or the N-terminal amine when the residues are not bound to ligands (Janecki et al., 2005) . The modified and unmodified residues were identified by proteolytic digest followed by mass spectrometry. This procedure was previously used to elucidate the contacts between the ribosomal proteins and rRNA (Lauber et al., 2009; Liu and Reilly, 2009; Running and Reilly, 2009) . Figure 2A shows MS/MS spectra for tryptic peptides generated from NS3 prebound to RNA and then subjected to amidination or to a parallel processed sample that was not bound to RNA. In the absence of RNA, NS3P-4A was amidinated at K165, as determined by a 41 Da mass shift in modified peptides as well as a miss trypsin cleavage site. In the presence of RNA K165 amidination was undetectable, and an increase in the tryptic peptide cleaved at K165 was observed ( Fig.  2A , data not shown). The peptide containing K165 maps adjacent to the NS3P substratebinding pocket (Fig. 2B ), in agreement with the results of the RCAP assay in Fig. 1 . The amidination interference results thus confirm that substrate pocket of NS3P can bind RNA.",

The protease assay used a peptide substrate that contained a fluorophore and a fluorescence quencher, and an increase in fluorescence is observed upon proteolysis (Lam and Frick, 2006) . In the absence of ligand, both NS3 mixed with the NS4A peptide (NS3+4AP) and a fusion of the NS3 protease domain to the NS4A peptide (NS3P-4A) had robust protease activity (Fig. 3A) . Fusion of full-length NS3 to the NS4A peptide was not soluble in our hands. NS3 lacking the NS4A peptide had minimal activity over the course of the reaction (Fig. 3A) . The fluorescence released from a completed NS3-cleavage reaction was not quenched by a 27-nt ssRNA (ssR27), a 29-nt ssDNA, a 24-nt ssDNA with phosphorothioate backbone named 2006, or 1 mM ATP ( Fig.  3A inset and Fig. 3B ) demonstrating that ssRNAs and ssDNAs do not significantly interfere with the readout from the assay. ssR27, ssD29, and phosphorothioate-modified ssDNA 2006 incubated with the NS3P did inhibit the NS3 protease activity (Fig. 3C) . ssD29, ssR27 and 2006 reduced protease activities by 22, 38, and 58%, respectively (Fig. 3C ). Similar trends were observed with NS3P-4A, although the inhibition by 2006 was better than that of NS3 amended with the 4A peptide.

To better quantify the effect of the RNAs on the NS3 protease domain, we examined the consequence of adding increasing amounts of 2006 to NS3+4AP and NS3P-4A (Fig. 3D) . The IC 50 of 2006 was 810 nM for NS3+4AP and 8.2 nM for NS3P-4A, a difference of two orders of magnitude (Fig. 3D) . Altogether, these results confirm that the helicase domain will titrate away some antagonists for the NS3P. Furthermore, some ligands possess yet-to-be elucidated properties that make them better inhibitors of NS3 protease activity.",

RNA ssR29 should form a stable hairpin (\u0394G of \u22128.5 kcal/mol, Zuker et al., 2003) with a single-stranded 3\u2032 tail. RNAs cssR29b and ssR29b are also 29-nt in length, but possess less stable intramolecular structures when compared to ssR29 (\u0394G of \u22123.0 kcal/mol and \u22128.6 kcal/mol, respectively, Zuker, 2003) . SsR29b and cssR29 were both better inhibitors of NS3P-4A activity than ssR29 (Fig. 4B) , suggesting that RNAs with less stable secondary structures are better inhibitors of protease activity. To examine this trend further, we annealed cssR29b and ssR29b to form a dsRNA named dsR29b and confirmed that dsR29 was in a duplex form in a nondenaturing PAGE (Fig. 4B , inset). When tested in parallel with ssR29b and cssR29b, dsR29b had only half the inhibitory effect as either of its single-stranded progenitors (Fig. 4B ). In addition, ssR15 (\u0394G of \u22123 kcal/mol) was a better inhibitor of NS3P-4A protease activity than ssR19. The IC 50 values of ssR29b for NS3+4AP and NS3P-4A were 1.5 \u03bcM and 0.9 \u03bcM, respectively (Fig. 4C) .

The RCAP assay was used to confirm that the mutants were affected for RNA binding.

In addition, each mutant was crosslinked to one unique peptide from the protease domain, suggesting that RNA contact in the protease domain was altered with the two mutants (Fig. 5A) . Interestingly, two peptides from the helicase domain of NS3 (residues 361-372, and 588-601) were not observed with the mutants, consistent with communication through RNA binding by the helicase and protease domains (Fig. 5A) .

Cells expressing MAVS and NS3-4A were solubilized with nonionic detergent and the lysates centrifuged to generate a soluble fraction (S15) and membrane-enriched pellet (P15). The location of MAVS in the fractions was detected using Western blots. As is to be expected, the coexpression of NS3-4A resulted in the release of MAVS into the solubilized fraction (Fig. 6B) . However, in the presence of 2006, the majority of MAVS remained in the membrane fraction. These results are consistent with our observation that 2006 can inhibit the protease activity of NS3-4A.",

The distinct roles in the chronology of a typical HCV infection should require the domains to communicate extensively during the viral infection process (Yao et al., 1999) . Consistent with this idea, elegant work from Moradpour's lab demonstrated a serial dynamic conformational coordination between NS3 protease and helicase domains allowing proper positioning of the protease active site on the membrane and accomplishing processing of the polyprotein in a sequential and spatial fashion (Brass et al., 2008) .",

In fact, we showed that aptamer G9-1 can crosslink residues in/near the active site of the NS3P. G9-1 contacts a larger region of the NS3 protease active site than did the shorter ssRNAs we used. Furthermore, we observed that RNAs that are less stably structured are better inhibitors for NS3P activity while RNAs with more stable structures bind less efficiently. Since ssRNA is the product of the NS3 helicase, identifying that ssRNA are better protease inhibitors suggests that product of the helicase domain could bind to the protease active site to down regulate the protease activity.",

A number of mechanisms have been proposed to regulate the timing of these processes in other positive-strand RNA viruses (Dahl et al., 2007; Isken et al., 2003; Jurgens et al., 2006; Yi et al., 2009a; Yi et al., 2009b) . Indeed, for picornaviruses, the protease 3C is responsible for binding of the origin of PV replication (Fukuda et al., 2000; Shen et al., 2007; Yin et al., 2003) . The HCV NS3 is poised to participate in both processes and our results suggest that RNA binding to the protease domain of NS3 could differentially regulate the two activities. Along with the recent observation that NS3 also participates in the assembly of HCV virions (Moradpour et al., 2007) , it is likely that NS3 will prove a key regulator ensuring the proper timing of the steps in HCV RNA infection.",

B) Sequence of ssR27, the RNA used to generate an affinity resin for the RCAP assay. C) Mass spectra of a control reaction in which the formaldehyde was left out of a reaction (top inset), NS3 crosslinked to the RNA-resin (middle), and NS3 amended with the 4AP crosslinked to the RNA-resin (bottom). The reactions were performed as described in the Materials and Methods. The ions were resolved by a Bruker Autoflex III MALDI-TOF mass spectrometer set in reflectron mode. D) A summary of the ions observed in the mass spectra containing NS3 peptides reversibly crosslinked to the RNA-resin. The observed and expected masses of the assigned peptides are shown. E) Schematics of NS3 showing the locations of the peptides that crosslinked to the ligand indicated. G9-1, an RNA that was selected by SELEX to inhibit NS3 protease activity, was also analyzed by the RCAP assay (Urvil et al., 1997, bottom panel) . Identical peptides were identified for a phosphorothioate-containing DNA (2006) as ssR27. To better discern the two domains of NS3, the helicase domain is in darker grey while the NS3P domain is in lighter color. Residues in the catalytic triad of NS3P are denoted by blue asterisk, the helicase nucleic acid binding residues identified by (Frick, 2007; Mackintosh et al., 2006) are denoted by red asterisks. The locations of NS3 that we identified to bind RNA and phosphorothioate-modified 2006 are in yellow. Effects of nucleic acid ligands on NS3 protease activity in vitro. A) A demonstration of the data generated by the fluorescent protease assay. The assay measures fluorescence releases in arbitrary units (A. U.) over a one-minute period. The presence of NS4A peptide is needed to increase catalytic activity either as a fusion to NS3P (NS3P-4A), or added in trans to the NS3 protein (NS3 + 4A). The inset shows that the RNAs added to the assay did not affect the fluorescence. This control reaction used an NS3 protease reaction that was allowed to reach saturation prior to the addition of the RNA, ssR27. The addition of ssR27 did not perturb the fluorescence, indicating that the RNA did not affect the readout for the assay. B) Sequence of the potential antagonists used in the NS3 protease assay. The letter S denotes that ssDNA 2006 contains phosphorothioates in place of phosphodiesters. C) A summary of the effects of the potential antagonists on the rates of substrate cleavage by NS3 + 4A or NS3P-4A. The rate is the slope of the curve for the fluorescence released in the first three minutes of the reaction, the F-final is the level of the fluorescence in the reaction after a tenminute reaction period. Each reaction was done in at least triplicate and the S.E. is shown in parentheses. D) Inhibition curves for ssDNA 2006 on NS3 and NS3P-4A proteolytic activities.",

The same assay was also performed with the labeled ssR15 annealed to the complementary RNA to generate dsR15. E) Analysis of the mechanism of inhibition of ssR29b on NS3P-4A protease activity. A standard NS3P-4A protease activity assay was performed in the presence of 4 \u03bcM substrate. The effects of two concentrations of ssR29b on the rates of cleavage by NS3P were graphed in a double reciprocal plot. The intercept for the inhibitors was approximately at zero, suggesting that the RNA antagonists for NS3P-4A were competing with the peptide substrate.",

A) MS/MS analysis of peptides from NS3P that were differentially amidinated in the presence and absence of RNA. The top panel shows the b and y ions from the MS/MS spectra for the peptide that was not cleaved by trypsin due to amidination at Lysine 165. The bottom panel shows the MS/MS spectra for the parent peptide in which amidination did not take place due to the presence of ssR27, and the peptide was cleaved at the cognate lysine. B) The model for NS3P and the location of the RCAP peptides relative to the active site of NS3P. The active site residues are in blue. The locations of peptides identified to crosslink to RNA inFig. 1are in yellow, and the location of the amidinated lysine (K165) is in red.FIG. 3.",
