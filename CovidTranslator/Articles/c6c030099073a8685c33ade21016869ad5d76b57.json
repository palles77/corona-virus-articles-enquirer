Workshops included: the use of Directed Acyclic Graphs; interactive data visualisation; digital data and surveillance; Big Data epidemiology; an introduction to Conjoint Analysis; and a discussion on the future of veterinary epidemiology. From within the conference programme, the seven papers contained in this Special Issue of Preventive Veterinary Medicine demonstrate the excellent platform for networking between veterinary epidemiologists, public health professionals, economists and aligned professionals which this conference provides.",

By reviewing information on existing OH surveillance systems, they defined their organisational and functional characteristics, the context for-and likely factors involved in implementation and performance of surveillance systems. This enabled identification of different dimensions of surveillance, areas of collaboration, barriers and levers to progress. The authors then established a conceptual framework for use when describing and evaluating on-goingor when developing future -OH surveillance systems.",

They estimated the high-risk period for farms using interviews, then investigated the clinical manifestation, possible origins and modes of virus introduction. Herd incidence and outbreak risk were calculated in domestic pigs, with spatial and temporal distribution then characterised for this population. Thereafter, the domestic's distribution was used in Bayesian modelling of ASF occurrence in wild boar. Mild, non-specific (to ASF) clinical symptoms masked a high virus virulence, with backyard producers suffering greatest morbidity and mortality. Study findings suggest indirect modes of transmission which are difficult to identify and probably are linked to biosecurity issues. Finally, the spatio-temporal modelling suggested a link between ASF in domestic pigs and local wild boar, which has important implications for future disease control.",

Included in the probability of freedom analyses were test sensitivity, real animal movement and regional herd prevalence data, used to estimate the probability of infection introduction from purchased animals, and local transmission. The outputs were used to validate herd-level estimates of subsequent BTM testing. The probability of freedom declined with posttesting, and was impacted by animal purchasing, for BTM test-negative herds. Comparison of probability of freedom estimates and previous BTM test-results suggest that the former is a better appraisal of herdlevel BTM status for both pathogens. This information can be used to improve the efficiency of future control measures against BRSV and BCV.",

Using a cohort study design to ameliorate the long incubation period of Johne's disease, milking cows were routinely monitored for MAP using milk ELISA testing. The relative importance of dam MAP status compared to other risk factors was then examined, after the relationship with time until first detection of infection had been characterised. The study results suggest that cows may be transmitting MAP to their offspring earlier in the cows' infection course than previously understood. This has practical implications for on-farm management of MAP-positive animals' offspring; for more information see Patterson et al. (2019) .",
