            "text": "Canine Monocytic Ehrlichiosis (CME) is a serious tick-borne rickettsial disease affecting canine populations globally. Besides few reports from stray and pet dogs from localised geographical regions (cities/towns/small states), a comprehensive study on prevalence of Ehrlichia canis (E. canis) among working dogs from different geoclimatic zones of India was pertinently lacking. Study of CME among these dog populations was thus carried out, encompassing clinical aspects and different diagnostic methodologies viz., microscopy, serology and molecular biology. During the two-year study period, clinical specimens from 225 cases suspected of canine ehrlichiosis were examined for clinical pathology and presence of the haemoparasites. Overall prevalence of ehrlichiosis by microscopic examination, commercial dot-ELISA kit and nested PCR assay was estimated to be 1.3%, 19.1% and 5.8%, respectively, which were found to be statistically significant by McNemar Chi squared test (p < 0.05). It was also observed that possibly due to widespread use of doxycycline therapy in field, CME presently does not remain a potential threat which it uses to pose earlier. However, concurrent infections of E. canis and Babesia gibsoni were found to be mostly fatal. Keeping in view of high number of apparently healthy dogs (24) out of total positive cases (46) observed during the study, it is recommended that prevalence studies on CME should also involve screening of apparently healthy dogs. Phylogenetic analysis carried on partial sequencing of 16S rRNA of E. canis strains revealed that all of the Indian strains clustered in a single clade with other E. canis species from India and rest of the world. Molecular divergence was observed among the sequences of Brazilian and American isolates which were also included in the present study. These findings have thus opened a new paradigm for planning of pragmatic control strategies against CME.",

This pathogen is responsible for causing Canine Monocytic Ehrlichiosis (CME) in canines and probably in felines, globally. It is transmitted exclusively by the brown dog tick, Rhipicephalus sanguineus sensu lato (Dumler et al., 2001) . E. canis has a tissue tropism for reticulo-endothelial cells of the liver, spleen and lymph nodes and replicates primarily in the mononuclear macrophages (Swango et al., 1989) . The disease is often referred to as 'tropical canine pancytopaenia', because of its high prevalence rates in tropics and subtropical zones with associated decrease in leucocytes and platelets in clinical cases. In absence of timely therapeutic interventions, the disease pathophysiology continues and the mononuclear cell invasions results into various severe clinical and fatal outcomes (Gal et al., 2008) .",

Immunocomb dot-ELISA test (Biogal Galed Laboratories, Israel) and SNAP3Dx assay (IDEXX Laboratories, USA) utilizing synthetic peptides derived from major immuno-dominant E. canis proteins are also commercially available for the field use (Harrus et al., 2002) .

Besides these lacunae, these prevalence studies were also solely based on either commercial serology kit or on molecular based techniques and thus failed to analyse the practical relevance of both the methodologies in existing field conditions. These points are quite pertinent from the fact that nowadays there has been lot of awareness on control measures viz. anti-tick/acaricide applications and recommended doxycycline therapy against the disease. At present, working dogs being housed in organised kennels also form a key corpus of dog population in this country and due to intensive way of housing; these dogs are unrelentingly on the high risk of acquiring CME. With this background, this study was envisaged to correlate the haematological parameters, serum biochemistry profiles and histopathology findings of canine ehrlichiosis cases along with their diagnostic assays results. These lab findings were then thoroughly analysed so as to bridge the existing knowledge gap on the actual scenario of CME in the organised kennels of this country.",

These kennels were located in different geo-climatic zones encompassing the north-eastern states (Assam and Nagaland), eastern state (West Bengal), northern states (Jammu & Kashmir, Uttar Pradesh and Delhi) and south-western state (Maharashtra) of this country. These organised kennels exclusively maintained pedigreed German Shepherd and Labrador Retriever breeds of dogs. This is akin to many other countries as these two breeds' forms the main corpus of working dog population, globally. Moreover, the kennels under study followed recommended vaccination, acaricide and deworming schedules and had standard management practices in place. A total of 225 serum and blood samples were collected from 90 German Shepherds, 132 Labrador Retrievers and three Cocker Spaniels over a two year study period from March 2012 to April 2014. Three animals (two Labradors and one German Shepherd) died during the study and their necropsy tissue samples were subjected to histopathology examination.",

However, these studies mainly focused on pet dogs bought to the clinics or on stray dogs of some selected cities/parts of this country. Prevalence studies of CME from Northern India were mainly concentrated from Ludhiana city in Punjab over the last few years in pet dogs and non-descript local dogs that were bought to the clinic. Singla et al. (2011) reported a high seroprevalence of 61% in pet dogs when tested by commercial serological kit. The same group in their molecular studies through nested PCR in 2016 in the same city detected meagre 0.39% prevalence of E. canis DNA in pet dogs. Milanjeet et al. (2014) from the same Ludhiana city reveals prevalence of 2.34% by microscopy and 41.59% by PCR. In a recent study from the same location by Kottadamane et al. (2017) , prevalence of 14.28% and 86.90% were reported by microscopy and serology. A multi-centric study by Abd Rani et al. (2011) reported 20.6% of molecular prevalence study among the stray dogs from the cities of Delhi, Mumbai, Ladakh region of Jammu and Kashmir and from the small state of Sikkim in Eastern India. A study conducted in Western India state of Goa by Wise and Tarlinton (2012) revealed the presence of anti-E. canis antibodies among 19% of the dogs out of 40 dogs were screened. Samaradni et al. (2003) from Nagpur, Maharashtra (Western India) reported 18.9% prevalence by microscopy. A single study conducted in Chennai city from South India by Lakshmanan et al. (2006) reported 50% prevalence by PCR.",

No attempt whatsoever had been made to compare these various diagnostic approaches. Present study has been attempted to gauge the pattern of E. canis infection among working dogs in India. A sizeable population of working dogs in India principally comprise of Labrador Retriever and German Shepherd breeds. Deployment of these working dogs in difficult terrains like grassland and forests posses a potential exposure to the infected wild canids; while carrying out duties in semi-urban or rural areas these animals get exposed to the stray dogs. Thus, these working dogs are also at the continuous risk of exposure to ticks and other tick borne diseases. With this background, present study was undertaken simultaneously using, microscopy, dot-ELISA and nested PCR. These diagnostic results were then retrospectively correlated with clinical manifestations, haematology parameters, biochemical profiles and clinico-pathological findings of the clinical cases so as to have an actual view of CME existing in the organised kennels of this country.",

The limitations of microscopy in detecting E. canis morulae has also been reported by prior studies (Mylonakis et al., 2004; Singla et al., 2011; Abd Rani et al., 2011) and therefore make it a less sensitive technique for confirmatory diagnosis of canine ehrlichiosis. Moreover, sensitivity of E. canis detection by microscopy is low due to the fact that in chronic cases number of infected cells in peripheral circulation is very less to be detected by microscopic examination. It is considered that sensitivity may be augmented to some extent by examining buffy coat smears rather than examining blood smears; nevertheless in our study we didn't find any difference between the two approaches.",

Thus, 23.25% sero-positive canines were nested PCR positive, while only 4.65% sero-positives were positive by microscopy. Parana da Silva Souza et al. (2010) had also observed that 34.5% IFAT positive dogs were PCR positive for E. canis. Wen et al. (1997) reported 16S rRNA nested PCR as highly specific and sensitive method for detection of E. canis DNA from blood samples. Nested PCR protocol has been claimed to be comparable 0.2 pg to of E. canis DNA by Southern blotting. Harrus et al. (1998b) had reported that serology based diagnostic assays like indirect immunofluorescence antibody test are not reliable methods to determine persistence of infection or success of treatment as titres have been shown to remain high for long periods even after elimination of the parasite. In contrast, very recent acute condition may not generate enough antibodies sufficient enough to be detected by serology. This phenomenon was observed with two sera samples found to be negative by dot-ELISA (titre 1:20) but judged positive for E. canis by microscopy and nested PCR. Alternately, chronic infections may result in negative results with serology. This may be due to pancytopenia and bone marrow failure (Saito and Walker, 2016) . E. canis DNA in infected dog blood can be detected earlier than serum antibodies, while the latter continue to persist even after doxycycline therapy (Moroff et al., 2014) . Moreover, cross reactivity between different Ehrlichia spp. makes the definitive sero-diagnosis of E. canis difficult. Furthermore, cases with sero-positive and negative nested PCR may also be an indication of the carrier state or subclinical infection due to sequestration of the parasite in the splenic macrophages (Harrus et al., 1998a,b; Waner, 2008) . Nakaghi et al. (2008) did not observe any significant difference between the results IFAT kit (VMRD Inc., USA) and dot-ELISA kit (Biogal Galed Laboratories, Israel), though the latter detected more sero-positives (70% by ELISA versus 63.3% by IFAT). In light of observed facts, it is emphasized that serological assays (dot-ELISA) without confirmation by molecular assay (nested PCR) may lead to biased results, as cross reactivity among Ehrlichia species and persistence of antibodies for long periods in dogs even after their successful treatment may result in reporting of false positive cases. This possibility leads to the overestimation of CME Fig. 1 .

Thus, the serological results should be interpreted with caution and should be complemented by nested PCR results so as to avoid misdiagnosis. Although, clinical signs and pathology of E. canis infection in dogs may vary within or between geographical locations but none the less this pathogen is considered to be most pathogenic amongst other causative agents of canine ehrlichiosis viz. Ehrlichia chaffensis, Anaplasma platys and Anaplasma phagocytophilum (Nair et al., 2016) . It is thus beyond doubt that CME due to E. canis results in marked anaemia due to significant decrease in PCV, TRBC and haemoglobin (gm/dl). But over the last decade, there has been lot of awareness on canine ehrlichiosis in organised kennels and stringent management practices have helped to reduce the incidence and prevalence of the disease. As per our observations, most veterinarians in India prescribe doxycycline at recommended dose along with supportive B-vitamins and iron supplementations for treatment of minor ailments like pyrexia or as chemoprophylaxis, especially during the tick season. It is expected that due to widespread application of doxycycline, CME is no more a real potent threat to dogs in organised kennels of this country as it used to be, in spite of its high prevalence. This may be one of the reasons that no severe chronic case of ehrlichiosis was encountered during the entire study period. From the interpretation derived from clinical presentation of clinical CME cases with their haematological and biochemical profile pictures it was inferred in this study that severe form of chronic ehrlichiosis is not very common in the organised kennels of this country. Thus keeping in view of endemic status of CME in this country and subclinical state of infection it is recommended prevalence studies should also involve screening of apparently healthy dogs.",

Though authors did not observe such serious cases of CME alone and the cases with grave prognosis were observed in only cases affected with mixed infections. Three dogs out of the six animals having dual infection of E. canis and B. gibsoni succumbed to death while no casualty solely because E. canis could be incriminated during the entire course of this study.

However, for developing diagnostics and vaccines for E. canis multi-locus sequence typing of the pathogens along with other associated pathogens like A. platys which have been reported from this country must be carried out. E. canis is considered to have a limited host range among canines and to some extent among felids. Nucleic acid of E. canis has been detected from human beings in Venezuela (Unver et al., 2001) as well from ruminants (ovines) in Turkey and South Africa (Parzy et al., 2009) .

Wider host range and the similarity among the geographically distinct isolates indicate a global spread of the pathogen and its vectors (Parzy et al., 2009) .

The disease manifests in various forms and its diagnosis by conventional microscopy is prone to errors and insufficiency. Regrettably, due to prerequisites of sophisticated technical resources and higher cost elements for PCR and serological assays, practising veterinarians mostly carry out an empirical treatment leading to indiscriminate use of doxycycline and raising concerns on possibilities of positive selection of drug resistant strain of E. canis. It is suggested that doxycycline should be used with caution only when there is active infection in the affected dogs. Thus, practising vets need to be supported strongly by sound diagnostic services to ascertain the status of CME in clinical cases. The present study concludes with the recommendation that researchers/clinicians should not solely rely on clinical signs and smear microscopy/serological methods (antibody based detection methods); but should correlate with detection of active infection (antigen or nucleic acid based detection methodologies). These findings will definitely assists in planning of pragmatic control strategies against CME especially in countries where its endemic scenario exists.",
