Sequencing whole genomes requires resources that are currently beyond those of a single laboratory and therefore it is not a practical approach for resequencing hundreds of individual genomes. DNA microarrays present an alternative way to study differences between closely related genomes. Advances in microarray-based approaches have enabled the main forms of genomic variation (amplifications, deletions, insertions, rearrangements and base-pair changes) to be detected using techniques that are readily performed in individual laboratories using simple experimental approaches.",

Remarkably, virtually all this sequencing has been done using a single method: chain termination sequencing using dideoxynucleosides 1 , usually referred to as Sanger sequencing. From the determination of the first complete genome sequence of an organism, the bacteriophage \u03c6X174 (Ref. 2) , to the completion of 95% of the human genome sequence 3,4, many technical advances in methodologies, automation and computing rapidly increased the rate at which DNA sequence was obtained 5 . The availability of genomic sequences has led to the development of many genomescale analytical techniques that have greatly enriched modern biology -for example, techniques to measure global mRNA abundance 6, 7 , systematically knock out all genes 8 , perturb their function 9 and generate comprehensive clone collections 10, 11 -and together they constitute the new field of genomics.",

To this end, the research and commercial community is accelerating towards new approaches to genome sequencing [12] [13] [14] that are increasingly less expensive, more rapid and efficient, and more widely available. Nevertheless, determining even modest numbers of complete genomic sequences is still a substantial undertaking, entailing equipment, infrastructure and running expenses beyond the resources of most individual laboratories, and the study of sequence variation through direct genome sequencing remains the province of a minority of biologists.",

Methods that efficiently detect genomic differences, be they structural rearrangements, polymorphisms or mutations, often suffice to reduce the sequencing requirement to a tiny fraction of the genome, a capability that is routine in most modern biology laboratories. Several technologies that use hybridization to DNA microarrays are effective for detecting genomic variation in closely related samples. Thus, questions in which a researcher aims to compare normal and diseased tissues from the same individual or mutant and wild-type DNA from the same experimental organism can often be addressed by microarray-based experimental comparison as opposed to exhaustive sequencing of entire genomes.",

To use hybridization to compare genomes at the sequence level it is necessary to maximize the difference between the T m of the perfectly matched DNA and the T m of the mismatched DNA. This difference is highly dependent on the length of the oligonucleotide and in practice is likely to only be within the range of detection for oligonucleotides that are shorter than 50 bp. Therefore, short probes are required to interrogate sequence differences between genomes. Longer probes -such as those provided by BAC clones, cDNA clones or PCR products -provide greater coverage of the genome and allow detection of structural variation, even in the presence of a small number of sequence differences (see table; IV, insertional variation; SV, structural variation).

Equal amounts of labelled DNA is hybridized to the microarray, and the hybridization reaction is allowed to come to equilibrium over a period of >12 hours. At most probes, equal amounts of the two samples will hybridize (yellow features on the array), reflecting the fact that most loci in the two genomes are present in equal amounts (for example region 3). Regions that are deleted in the sample genome (region 1 of sample A) will result in probes with increased relative Cy3 signal (green features). Alternatively, amplified regions in the sample (region 2 of sample A) will result in features with an increased relative Cy5 signal (red features). Over the entire microarray, the signal ratios at each feature follow a Gaussian distribution, and candidate copy number variations are identified on the basis of deviation of a particular probe ratio, using statistical cut-offs.

For Affymetrix-manufactured microarrays, the method entails labelling DNA with biotin, then adding streptavidin conjugated to phycoerythrin after hybridization (represented by yellow circles). Rather than a ratio, an absolute value of hybridization is determined; following normalization, this value is compared with other experiments to detect genomic variation. A single two-colour hybridization gives less variation at each probe than two independent one-colour hybridizations because the detailed conditions at every probe, such as salt concentration and temperature, are identical in the two-colour experiment but are not necessarily identical in the two independent one-colour experiments.",

The latter is important for understanding the mechanism by which this source of variation is generated and for predicting how genomic elements that are encoded at junction sites might be affected. BAC probes provide the greatest coverage of the genome and are currently the most comprehensive microarray platform available for human genome analysis; they do not detect small variants, however, and breakpoint resolution is limited to the size of the probe. Thus, the application of microarrays using oligonucleotide probes is appealing as this enables both greater resolution and greater sensitivity. For smaller genomes, such as those of microorganisms, complete coverage of the genome using short oligonucleotide probes is already commonplace 30, 31 . Coverage of the human genome using short oligonucleotide probes continues to increase, either through the use of dedicated array platforms 54 or the use of microarrays that were originally designed for genotyping 57, 58 , thereby enabling the detection of smaller variants with higher resolution. Moreover, some types of structural variation that do not change the copy number -such as inversions and reciprocal translocations, which are not detected using large probes -should in principle be identified with oligonucleotide probes by virtue of the sequence change at the junction site.",

The coloured boxes indicate the relative intensity of hybridization at each probe -yellow being the highest intensity. b | In the absence of resequencing arrays, hybridization of the sample to candidate sequence probes can be used. Mismatches resulting from mutations in sample DNA will result in a lower hybridization efficiency compared with hybridization to a sample with complete sequence complementarity. This approach has the advantage of requiring far fewer probes and is often sufficient to detect sequence variation. If a mismatch is inferred then small-scale sequencing is necessary to identify the variant nucleotide. c | The effect of a SNP on hybridization is related to its corresponding position in a probe. More central positions result in the greatest decrease, whereas SNPs positioned at the end of probes are much less likely to result in a significant decrease in hybridization. d | It is possible to use hybridization data obtained from a mutation detection array to compute a likelihood that a particular site is a sequence variant with respect to the reference genome. This approach facilitates the comparison of related individuals at the sequence level, allowing rapid scanning of the genome. The diagram illustrates the analysis of a drug-resistant mutant in the budding yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Candidate SNPs are identified by a positive log likelihood value. In this case, a small number of candidate SNPs are detected throughout the genome; one is shown here on chromosome V, which is representative of the entire 13 Mb of the yeast genome. The peak highlighted in the inset is shown at higher resolution in the main figure. A single signal in the CAN1 gene, which is known to confer resistance to the drug canavanine, was identified and subsequently verified using Sanger sequencing.

Algorithms to analyse resequencing microarray data thus make use of the gain of signal at perfectly matched probes as well as the loss of signal at non-complementary probes. Although only 4 probes are necessary for each site in principle, up to 28 probes have been used in practice to interrogate each nucleotide position by including probes that target all possible sequence variants on both strands of DNA and various small insertion and deletion combinations 63 . Resequencing arrays have been used successfully for small viral genomes such as the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus 25 as well as for human mitochondrial DNA 27 . The great advantage of resequencing arrays is that they not only detect variation, but they also allow the variant sequence to be inferred. Although probe densities of commercially prepared oligonucleotide arrays have increased markedly over the past 10 years and now contain in the order of 10 6 features per array, most eukaryotic genomes are in the order of 10 7 -10 9 nucleotides. Thus, to cover the entire genome of a higher organism using resequencing arrays it is necessary to use many individual arrays, as was done for resequencing the genome of A. thaliana 33 and a significant subset of the human genome 34 . it is unclear what the upper limit is on the number of probes that can be placed on a microarray, but the rate of increase in probe density suggests that comprehensive resequencing arrays could eventually be available for larger genomes.",

To obtain robust data, experimental and analytical considerations need to be made at all stages of the Nature Reviews | Genetics Figure 3 | genome-wide mapping of loci by selective enrichment and detection using microarrays. One way of mapping insertion sequence variation is to isolate the insertion element and its immediately neighbouring DNA. Specific regions of the genome are isolated using either a capture probe method (as illustrated in the diagram) or a PCR-based method. This approach is suited to mapping the location in the genome of mobile genetic elements, which are notoriously difficult to characterize using wholegenome sequencing approaches. As shown in the figure, DNA is fragmented in the first step (a). Two separate reactions selectively enrich for the 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 ends of the insertion sequence using sequence-specific capture probes (b). The 5\u2032-enriched and the 3\u2032enriched fractions are labelled with different fluorophores (Cy5 and Cy3, respectively) and then hybridized to a microarray using a two-colour protocol (c). Finally, insertion sites are mapped on the basis of a transition (indicated by an arrow in d) from positive to negative log 2 ratio, corresponding to sample that is enriched for DNA adjacent to the 5\u2032 end of the insertion sequence and sample that is enriched for DNA adjacent to the 3\u2032 end of the insertion sequence, respectively. The site of transition corresponds to the genomic location of the insertion sequence. Each red and blue bar represents a microarray probe in a contiguous region of the genome spanning ~10 kb. The distance between each probe is ~200 bp and therefore, in this case, the insertion site is detected between two probes corresponding to a mapping resolution of ~200 bp.",

This is particularly acute for the 'homemade' variety of microarrays, such as the BAC arrays used for aCGH, in which probe quality can vary greatly between microarrays. However, even leading microarray manufacturers frequently provide microarrays with variable probe quality 93 . The presence of an internal reference provides a means of controlling the variation that is due to probe quality because the measurement of interest is the relative binding efficiency between the reference (often a standard reference used over and over again) and sample.

Inherent limitations. Although microarray-based methods are a powerful and simple approach to characterizing genomic variation, there are a number of limitations. The greatest limitation in comparison with de novo sequencing methods is the fact that only known sequence is interrogated. Most microarrays have been made using a reference sequence that was obtained using wholegenome Sanger sequencing of one or a few members of a species. Therefore, if additional individuals that contain genomic loci that were not detected in the initial sequencing are analysed using these arrays then these genomic regions will be completely missed in the analysis. This is likely to represent a small proportion of any genome, but in yeast there are a number of cases of genes that are found in some strains but that are not present in the reference sequence 98 . it seems likely that this will be a general case for many species. once such genes have been found in other individuals it makes sense to incorporate them into subsequent microarray designs. An additional limitation for microarrays is the analysis of highly repetitive regions. This includes regions or features of the genome that are present in multiple copies, such as transposons and telomeres as well as low-complexity DNA that contains repetitive motifs. lowcomplexity DNA poses a particular problem for detecting sequence variation because hybridization efficiency seems to be much more variable in these regions and is a common source of false positives.",
