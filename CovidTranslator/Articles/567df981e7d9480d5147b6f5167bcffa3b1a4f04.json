            "text": "The alpha-helical coiled coil is a structurally simple protein oligomerization or interaction motif consisting of two or more alpha helices twisted into a supercoiled bundle. Coiled coils can differ in their stoichiometry, helix orientation and axial alignment. Because of the near degeneracy of many of these variants, coiled coils pose a challenge to fold recognition methods for structure prediction. Whereas distinctions between some protein folds can be discriminated on the basis of hydrophobic/polar patterning or secondary structure propensities, the sequence differences that encode important details of coiled-coil structure can be subtle. This is emblematic of a larger problem in the field of protein structure and interaction prediction: that of establishing specificity between closely similar structures. We tested the behavior of different computational models on the problem of recognizing the correct orientation -parallel vs. antiparallel -of pairs of alpha helices that can form a dimeric coiled coil. For each of 131 examples of known structure, we constructed a large number of both parallel and antiparallel structural models and used these to asses the ability of five energy functions to recognize the correct fold. We also developed and tested three sequenced-based approaches that make use of varying degrees of implicit structural information. The best structural methods performed similarly to the best sequence methods, correctly categorizing \u223c81% of dimers. Steric compatibility with the fold was important for some coiled coils we investigated. For many examples, the correct orientation was determined by smaller energy differences between parallel and antiparallel structures distributed over many residues and energy components. Prediction methods that used structure but incorporated varying approximations and assumptions showed quite different behaviors when used to investigate energetic contributions to orientation preference. Sequence based methods were sensitive to the choice of residue-pair interactions scored.",

The coiled coil consists of a bundle of supercoiled helices that are encoded by a 7-residue sequence repeat of the form [abcdefg] n . With a and d positions hydrophobic and e and g positions usually polar or charged, a \"sticky\" stripe winds its way around an individual helix, dictating the formation of a twisted helical bundle (Figure 1a and b) . Because of this simple relationship, the coiled-coil fold is one of the easiest protein structures to predict. Numerous programs have been developed to detect the presence of coiled-coil forming segments in sequences, and these exhibit respectable sensitivity and specificity.1 -4 However, few methods exist to predict the variety of topologies found in coiled-coil structures.4 -6 Helix content can vary from 2 to 7 helices, and helix orientation can be parallel or antiparallel. Structures can be homo-or heterooligomeric, and the helices can align axially in different ways. Thus, the \"coiled coil\" is really a large family of structures that share many properties but exhibit different topological characteristics.7",

            "text": "The difficulty of predicting coiled-coil structure lies in differentiating what can be subtle distinctions in interactions. For example, it has been reported for several designed coiled coils that changing a single a-or d-position residue can lead to a change or loss of oligomerization specificity.8 -10 Small changes in sequence can also alter helix orientation preferences. In the work of Oakley et al., moving a buried Asn residue by 7 positions in one helix and 3 in its partner helix was sufficient to switch a designed coiled coil from a parallel to an antiparallel orientation. 11 Lumb and Kim found that a buried Asn can establish both oligomerization and helix orientation specificity. 12 Perhaps surprisingly, this sensitivity to small sequence changes appears to hold for many native sequences as well. Mutation of an Asn residue at an a position of the yeast transcription factor GCN4 leads to loss of oligomerization specificity in that coiled coil,13 and changing 2 residues in the antiparallel coiled-coil dimer of Bcr can give either a mixture of antiparallel higher-order helical assemblies or trimers, depending on the mutations.14 This plasticity of coiled-coil structure in response to mutation makes the problem of fold recognition challenging. Much of the signal that is typically used to discriminate one structure from another in prediction, including patterns of predicted secondary structure and preferences of residues for different degrees of burial, is of little or no use in classifying coiled coils by type because these properties are largely the same in many of the competing structures. This situation also arises in other structure-prediction problems, where target and decoy structures must be resolved that sometimes include \"mirror-image\" variants containing the correct secondary structure elements arranged incorrectly with a reversed overall chirality. 15 , 16 Despite these challenges, some progress has been made on the problem of predicting coiledcoil interaction preferences from sequence. Several methods have been proposed for discriminating dimers from trimers. Simulations have successfully captured oligomeric preferences, and sequence-based programs have been developed for making predictions on novel coiled coils. 4 , 5 , 17 However, these were developed over a decade ago, using extremely small sets of known coiled-coil examples, and frequently fail on additional test cases that are available today. More recently, several methods have been developed to predict interacting partners among the bZIP transcription factors -an important protein family in which dimerization is mediated by a parallel coiled coil.6 , 18 -21 Relatively little is known about determinants of coiled-coil helix orientation, however. Various strategies have been used to design coiled coils that specifically adopt a parallel or antiparallel orientation, such as electrostatic charge patterning or the manipulation of a-and d-position polar residues or shape complementarity.11 , 22 -27 Alanine in core positions has been proposed to contribute to antiparallel specificity in coiled coils. 28 But in general, it is difficult to recognize sequence patterns that may specify helix orientation in native sequences. Analyzing features that determine orientation specificity via mutagenesis is often confounded by the fact that key residues may encode other types of specificity as well. For example, when probing the possible role of d-position Glu in determining the orientation preference of the Bcr coiledcoil domain, mutation to Leu led to the formation of trimers and other higher-order oligomers, as mentioned above.14 In this paper, we describe the performance of several types of computational models on the problem of predicting coiled-coil orientation. Due to the relatively small number of coiled coils with known orientation preference, learning strategies such as those that have been used in other motif recognition problems are not readily applicable.1 , 29 -32 Instead, we relied on structural models to evaluate coiled-coil orientation. We developed both explicit structural models and sequence-based models in which our use of structure was implicit. \"Out-of-the-box\" methods of both types did not perform very well, but small adjustments that took advantage of coiled-coil properties significantly improved the results.",

For simplicity, we considered pairs of sequences of equal length that can be fully overlapped in both parallel and antiparallel orientations, i.e., those sequences that are \"blunt ended\" when aligned both ways. This test is akin to biochemical assays that can measure the relative stability of these two conformations,11 , 33 although it avoids complexities that can be introduced by non-dimer states. An important feature of our calculations is that they do not require an accurate treatment of a dissociated and/or unfolded reference state (because the common unfolded state cancels), and therefore represent a best-case scenario for computational prediction.18 Significant additional challenges, such as predicting the correct axial alignment of helices, and determining that two sequences will form a dimer rather than some other type of oligomer, must be overcome to develop a general coiled-coil structure prediction method.",

To assemble this database, dimers were identified using the program SOCKET,34 which detects the knobs-into-holes side-chain packing that characterizes coiled-coil interfaces. Additionally, SOCKET was used to determine the coiled-coil heptad assignment (abcdefg). Because SOCKET also detects knobs-into-holes packing in non-coiled-coil structures, such as 4-helix bundles and helical sheets,34 , 35 these were manually removed. We also included several sequences from the human bZIP family of coiled coils21 , 36 in order to increase the number of parallel heterodimers in the database. In total, 61 parallel and 70 antiparallel examples with low sequence similarity and length >= 18 residues were selected and defined as our test set. We made the assumption that the coiled-coil motif itself is sufficient to encode the observed helix orientation for these structures. This may not always be true, and it is less likely to be true for short sequences that are part of a more complex fold. It is also less likely to be true for coiled coils that are highly buried. Nevertheless, local determination of helix orientation has been confirmed experimentally for a small number of cases in the literature, and it is likely to be true for the majority of our examples.14 , 37 -40 Due to the limited number of available structures, there are biases in the data set. In particular, the parallel structures include more homodimers and the antiparallel structures more heterodimers. This affected the performance of some methods, as discussed below.

The models differ from one another in the choice of pairs and/ or the weights assigned to them. Our selection of residue pairs took advantage of the known heptad register of the test-set structure. Heptad assignment for coiled-coil sequences with unknown structures can be made using programs such as Paircoil.1 , 3 We considered only interactions among the a,d, e, and g residues that make up the coiled-coil dimer interface. A summary of the notation and residue pairs for all ISM models is shown in Table II . To approximate the RISP struct method using an ISM, we scored seven pairs involving residues that commonly satisfy the RISP struct distance cutoff. These pairs were assigned their RISP weights, giving method RISP CC-all . Like RISP struct , RISP CC-all did not perform very well ( Figure 2b ). Interestingly, however, when we scored only 5 types of interactions for each coiled-coil orientation, giving model RISP CC , the performance was much better and rivaled that of the best ESM methods ( Figure 2c ). The pairs in RISP CC include those that have been described many times as being important for coiled-coil associations (i.e. a-a', d-d' and g-e' for parallel50 -53 and a-d', g-g' and e-e' for antiparallel54 ) as well as core-to-edge terms (ga' and d-e' for parallel and a-e', d-g' for antiparallel) that have been investigated in some systems and that were previously predicted to be important.18 , 55 , 56 Further reduction of the number of pairs, i.e. using only core a-a', d-d' (parallel) or a-d' pairs (antiparallel), giving model RISP core , or only edge g-e' or g-g' (parallel) or e-e' (antiparallel) pairs, giving RISP edge , degraded performance ( Figure 2b) .",

For RISP core , this effect came from more favorable weights for a-a' and d-d' homotypic interactions than heterotypic interactions. This bias was somewhat surprising, as the RISP energy function was designed to minimize such effects by excluding cases where a residue interacts with a symmetry-related copy of itself in the training set. Increasing the number of pair terms to make the RISP CC model, e.g. by adding edge and core-edge interactions that occur between positions not related by symmetry, diluted this effect, and the overall bias decreased (Figure 2d ). The CE model is based on a much smaller number of terms than the RISP models, and so homodimer bias here is likely a result of unequal numbers of weights available for scoring homo vs. heterodimers.",

Seventeen structures (13%) were predicted correctly by three or fewer methods. Some of the examples that are rarely predicted correctly may contradict our assumption that the PDB reflects the structure that coiled-coil fragments would adopt in isolation. For example, 1OV9, VicH H-NS histone-like protein, consists of an antiparallel coiled coil flanked by N-terminal swap domains that pack against it; any influence on helix orientation from these domains was not considered in our models. Another example is 1X75, DNA gyrase subunit A, in which an intramolecular antiparallel coiled coil is packed against a large structured loop.

Classifying all methods as statisticsbased (DFIRE, RISP struct and RISP CC ), knowledge-based (ELEC, CE) or pseudo-physical (Rosetta, GK, FoldX) shows that the knowledge-based potentials are least similar to the other methods and also not closely related to one another. The simple ELEC model had poor performance overall (Figure 2b ). Figure 3a shows that much of this poor performance resulted from the model's frequent failure to make a prediction (gray boxes), due to equivalent attractive and repulsive charge-charge interactions in both orientations. There are also examples where ELEC made a strong, yet incorrect, prediction. Model CE performed much better than ELEC; in overall prediction rate it was similar to the very good RISP CC (also an ISM). Yet, the clustering in Figure 3a shows that CE is not at all similar to the other ISMs in terms of how orientation is assigned for specific sequences. This is understandable, as CE and RISP are based on completely different methods of deriving pairwise scoring weights (experiments vs. PDB frequency analysis). Comparisons of ELEC, CE, and RISP CC further illustrate how three types of terms (edge interactions involving e and g positions, core interactions involving a and d positions, and core-to-edge interactions) are all important (Supplementary Figure S5a) . The inclusion of these heptad-position pairs in RISP CC (absent from ELEC or CE) help to account for its better performance. Finally, it is interesting that the RISP struct and RISP CC methods cluster quite tightly, despite significant differences in their prediction performances, underscoring their basis in the same contact potential.",

Figure 4 panels a-c illustrate the contributions of different energy terms to prediction performance. The prediction accuracy of each important term when used alone is shown, along with the effect of removing terms individually from the total energy. The Rosetta terms Eatr and Erep, which together give the total van der Waals energy, gave reasonable prediction performance when used alone (73%). Although the Rosetta electrostatics terms were poorly predictive in isolation, they significantly enhanced overall performance (removing them reduced performance from 82% to 76%). Interestingly, FoldX relied much more on a single type of term. The electrostatics term alone gave 73% prediction performance (just 3% below that of the FoldX total energy). Removing this term from the total energy reduced performance to 63%. The GK model is more similar to Rosetta than to FoldX, although it describes a more important role for electrostatics than Rosetta does. Interestingly, omitting the repulsive van der Waals energy contribution from the total energy had little effect on the performance of any of the models.

Seeking physical insights, we used this approach to explore whether component terms contribute differently to the total energy depending on whether the final prediction is parallel or antiparallel. For both Rosetta and GK, the van der Waals energy terms co-varied strongly with the total energy (Figures 4d and e) . The largest contribution came from the repulsive term, and interestingly, steric clashes were more important for examples predicted to be antiparallel than for those predicted to be parallel. Other Rosetta and GK terms, including those that describe electrostatic and solvation contributions, were smaller and exhibited less dramatic differences between parallel and antiparallel predictions. The FoldX electrostatic terms co-varied to a significant extent with the total energy (Figure 4f) , consistent with the analysis of Figure 4c . However, the FoldX energy terms that differed most between parallel and antiparallel predictions were the van der Waals energy (VdW), solvation terms (SolvP and SolvH) and side-chain entropy contribution (entropySC); these each showed stronger co-variation with the total energy for parallel predictions than for antiparallel. The observations for all three energy functions described above are consistent with parallel structures being packed more tightly than antiparallel, such that van der Waals interactions are more attractive, side-chain motions are more restricted, desolvation is greater, and clashes are more likely in the parallel orientation. Figure 3 panels b-e further emphasize differences between the methods and also support the characterization of parallel and antiparallel structures suggested by the co-variation analysis. Figure 3b illustrates cases where differences in steric repulsion between parallel and antiparallel structures were important, as reflected by a large magnitude for the Rosetta Erep term. The GK model also recognized an effect from repulsive van der Waals interactions for these examples. All but one of the cases with large Erep terms were predicted to be antiparallel by Rosetta and GK, most of them correctly so. Further analysis revealed that 11 out of 13 such examples, including 2 incorrect predictions, had Ile residues paired at d-d' positions in the parallel structures; this is an interaction that is known to lead to unfavorable sterics for some well-studied parallel coiled-coil dimers. 51 , 58 The examples in Figure 3b were treated differently by FoldX, RISP CC , and CE than by Rosetta and GK, as is expected because the former energy functions do not include a strongly repulsive steric term. Despite this, RISP CC and FoldX performed well on these structures. These methods capture the influence of poor packing due to steric clashes using other terms, in an overall balance that gives correct results.",

There are 18 complexes in which two Ile residues were paired at d-d' when modeled in the parallel orientation. Rosetta correctly predicted 10 out of 10 of the antiparallel coiled coils, and only 3 of 8 of the parallel. Notably, all 8 of these parallel-orientation paired Ile residues are in terminal heptads. From the crystal structures, it is clear that the helices often fray slightly towards the ends of the supercoil to accommodate these \u03b2-branched residues ( Figure 5 ). Such fraying is not included in our idealized backbone models. To compensate for this, we tested models in which each coiled-coil heptad, or each residue, contributed its minimum energy when evaluated over all backbones. This provided a way for the radius of the supercoiled bundle to effectively vary, potentially accounting more accurately for the local context of key interactions. However, this did not improve overall performance. FoldX, which does not contain a strong repulsive term, did slightly better at predicting these structures, with 5 out of 8 parallel structures predicted correctly but only 9 out of 10 antiparallel structures correct. this term were mostly parallel. Similar patterns are seen in the CE and RISP CC COREatr terms, in the FoldX VdW and SolvH terms and, to a lesser extent, in the GK Eatr term. Favorable packing was offset in most models by solvation penalties, presumably because polar residues were more buried in better-packed structures. Thus, clear preferences for the antiparallel structure showed up in the FoldX SolvP and Rosetta Esol terms for examples in this panel, and, to a lesser extent, in the GK EEF term. These trends support a model where closer packing and more burial (both favorable hydrophobic burial and unfavorable polar burial) can be achieved in the parallel orientation relative to the antiparallel orientation.",

For FoldX, electrostatics terms co-varied most strongly with the total energy ( Figure 4f ). Figure 3d shows examples that had large contributions from FoldX electrostatics (Elec, HDipole and Eleckon); these terms more often favored antiparallel structures. The GK potential also showed some of the FoldX trends for these examples, but the overall importance of electrostatics relative to other terms was reduced. Finally, electrostatics contributed very little to the Rosetta potential, which uses a combination of a statistically derived term (Epair) and an orientation-dependent hydrogen bond term (Ehbnd) to account for electrostatic effects. Figure 4d shows a preference for parallel coiled coils in the Rosetta hydrogen bonding term, which we suspected could include a contribution from Asn residues. A preference for paired, hydrogen-bonding Asn residues at a-a' positions in parallel coiled coils has been well documented and described as a determinant of coiled-coil orientation and alignment. 11 , 12 , 21 We explored whether this effect was evident in our data. Among all 131 sequence pairs tested, there were 28 examples where two Asn residues could be paired at a-a' sites in a parallel model. Of these, 27 were from parallel structures and only one was from an antiparallel structure (Figure 3e ). At least in our test set, therefore, the potential to pair Asn residues at a-a' is a strong indicator of a parallel orientation. This is recognized by models CE and RISP CC . CE includes a strong preference for Asn-Asn pairing, as determined experimentally,53 and its influence was clear in the CE COREatr term. RISP CC also assigns a favorable weight to this term, reflected in its COREatr term.",

To increase the probability that an appropriate backbone was available for each complex, each dimer was modeled on 120 different parallel and 81 different antiparallel templates. This was critical; ultimately 52 parallel and 44 antiparallel backbones were used to construct the minimumenergy structures of both orientations for the 131 complexes modeled. Although we found in post-analysis that a much smaller set of backbones could provide the same total prediction performance, it would have been difficult to determine in advance which scaffolds these should be. Thus, although it may be possible to capture backbone variability more efficiently than we have done here (e.g. by using a better-targeted backbone library or some different approach), we have found that it is important to model flexibility to achieve good results. We also found that small amounts of structural relaxation following rigid-backbone/ rotameric side-chain repacking were important.

However, it is not easy to modify the ESMs to accommodate small clashes, because such clashes can be important for determining the correct helix orientation. For example, softening the repulsive terms in Rosetta or GK to accommodate Ile pairs at terminal d positions may prevent the proper identification of clashes elsewhere. Interestingly, FoldX lacks such a rigid repulsive term, yet is still able to correctly predict the orientation of many sequences that contain these paired residues (Figure 3b) . Overall, our analyses support a model in which packing constraints are more demanding on parallel than on antiparallel backbones. Features of this model are captured differently by different methods. Models that include steric repulsion use this to predict that certain structures are antiparallel. Yet models that lack these terms can nevertheless recognize better packing in other ways. For FoldX, energy decomposition shows a role for the surface-area based van der Waals and hydrophobic solvation terms in favoring parallel structures. However, for sequences with large clashes (as assessed by Rosetta Erep differences), the preference of these terms for the parallel state is reduced or even reversed (Figure 3b ). This illustrates that despite a lack of explicit steric repulsion, FoldX can still recognize poor packing that arises in structure prediction of the incorrect orientation.",

Scoring all pairs of residues that could potentially be within 4.5 \u00c5, based on sequence and known coiled-coil dimer structures, was also not effective (model RISP CC-all ). Strikingly, however, when just 5 types of pairs were included for each orientation, performance was very good (RISP CC ).

In particular ,  Vinson and colleagues have quantified contributions of a-a', d-d' and g-e' pairs in parallel bZIP coiled coils,50 -53 and there is an approximate structural correspondence between these and the a-d', g-g' and e-e' pairs of antiparallel coiled coils, which have been less investigated.54 The core-to-edge terms (g-a' and d-e' for parallel and a-e', d-g' for antiparallel) provide a slight but detectable improvement in performance (Supplementary Figure S5a) . Interestingly, including the core-core terms (a-d' in parallel or a-a', d-d' in antiparallel structures) significantly degraded performance, despite recent observations by Hadley et al. that these can be significant in some antiparallel structures. 59 These results suggest that fold-recognition techniques applied to protein complexes, e.g. as are implemented in programs such as InterPreTS and Multiprospector,60 -62 could be improved if strategies for identifying critical specificity-determining residues in different folds were available. A significant disadvantage of some of the ISMs is that they exhibit a parallel bias for homodimeric structures. It is unlikely that this preference has a physical justification, as it is not supported by the best performing ESM models. Therefore, the use of ISMs to predict coiled-coil orientation may be subject to systematic errors that favor structures in which residues interact with adjacent copies of themselves.

To fit a native structure, we optimized superhelical parameters, as well as two external parameters that locate the coiled coil in the laboratory frame. It is important that the superhelical axis of the native coiled coil be aligned with the z-axis of the parameterization above. The superhelical axis of a parallel coiled coil can be well approximated as the rotational axis that maximizes superposition of one helix onto another. However, this is not the case for antiparallel coiled coils. For these, we found the best alignment by adjusting the internal Crick parameters, along with two Euler rotations and three translational degrees of freedom, using a process similar to that of the fitcc program. The center of mass of the helix was translated to the origin, and then the coiled coil was approximately oriented using two vectors defined by connecting the first and last C \u03b1 atom of each helix. The average of these two vectors was aligned with the z-axis. Starting from this position, the rest of the Crick parameters, along with two Euler angles and translations in three dimensions, were optimized using Matlab's constrained minimization algorithm65 to minimize the RMSD of the native helix to the closest ideal Crick helix. Given this superhelical alignment, antiparallel Crick parameters were fit in CHARMM by minimizing the energy with respect to these parameters as well as a rotation about the superhelical axis and a translation with respect to this axis. The energy minimized was proportional (with constant 25 kcal/\u00c52) to the sum of the distances squared of all C \u03b1 atoms from the ideal Crick C \u03b1 -atom positions.",
