The actual detection of the biogenic amines was on-line and within a temporal resolution of seconds. Simultaneously, the psychostimulant behavior induced by cocaine was studied by infrared photocell beam detection. The results show that cocaine concurrently and significantly increased synaptic concentrations of DA (p < 0.0001) and 5-1-1\"1\" (.o < 0.004) in VTA. Serotonin changes were accompanied by a notable oscillatory pattern. Importantly, DA and 5-HT changes in VTA were significantly and positively correlated (p < 0.01). Moreover, psychostimulant behaviors induced by cocaine were significantly increased over control values (p < 0.0001). Psychostimulant behaviors were significantly correlated with concurrently changing synaptic concentrations of DA (p < 0.01) and also with 5-HT to a lesser degree. Additionally, behavioral data indicate that cocaine may exhibit an anxiolytic effect during acute administration because agoraphobic behavior, as shown by increased central ambulatory behavior, was dramatically reduced by cocaine. Summarily, the present findings show that cocaine increased synaptic concentrations of DA in VTA, an action that is correlated with cocaine-induced psychostimulant behavior. The DA-ergic effect appears to be tonically maintained. Furthermore, new findings demonstrate a colocalized, cocaine induced 5-HT-ergic effect in VTA, which keeps pace with cocaine-induced alterations in DA-ergic neurotransmission. Thus, 5-HT may be a relay or a gating mechanism for a DA reward signalling pathway for cocaine.",

            "text": "In vivo voltammetry (electrochemistry) VARIOUS types of reinforcement capabilities for cocaine have been empirically and systematically reported during the past 25 years (4, 17, 24, 26, 37) . Furthermore, commensurate neurochemical evidence points to a distinct cocaine-induced mesolimbic dopaminergic influence in nucleus accumbens (NAcc) (10) (11) (12) 23, 25, 29, 34, 35, 44) ; the nerve terminals for discrete neuronal circuits thought responsible for brain reward phenomena (38) . Although early scientific papers debated the importance of a dopaminerglc mediation in somatodendritic ventral tegmental area (VTA-[A~0]) in neurophysiological reinforcement processes (of. (36) for review), a critical paper clearly emphasized a mediation for DA in VTA in cocaine-induced reinforcement (39) . Electrophysiologlcally, cocaine suppresses impulse frequency in VTA somatodendritcs (16) . Since lesions of NAcc and rostral VTA attenuate a cocaineinduced suppression of somatodendritic cell firing (16) , it is thought that both presynaptic nerve terminals and somatodendritic autoreceptors regulate cocaine's action in VTA. Indeed, a current report shows that cocaine increased the availability of dopamine (DA) in situ, in VTA in the anesthetized rat; the report supports the latter hypotheses (7) . Interestingly, cocaine does not act on DA in the parallel A9 somatodendrites in substantia nigra (22) . cesses has historically been empirically equivocal (cf. [43] for review). Provocatively, 5-HT per se has been shown to decrease intracranial self-stimulation (ICSS) (47) . Amidst the studies on cocaine reinforcement though, two recent scientific papers have been foremost in demonstrating that cocaine acts through a 5-HT-ergic component (10, 27) . Early on, cocaine was shown mechanistically to produce a potent inhibition of active 5-HT reuptake processes in whole brain (40) . More recent studies, however, have further shown that cocaine inhibits 5-HT reuptake (46) and decreases 5-HT synthesis in the discrete neuroanatomical substrate NAcc (18) . Electrophysiologically, cocaine suppresses impulse frequency rates in vivo and in vitro in the somatodendritic cell bodies for 5-HT; that is, the dorsal raphe magnus (DR) (14, 31) . Taken together with in vivo and in vitro evidence that shows (SC) cocaine suppresses 5-HT release in NAcc (10, 11, 15) , the emerging 5-HTergic role for cocaine is that of a centrally acting agonist.",

Moreover, VTA contains high levels of 5-HT and tryptophan hydroxylase activity (41) , and exhibits high affinity uptake for 5-HT (3). Radioautographic (32) and immunohistochemical (42) studies have further shown that VTA contains a dense network of 5-HT axonal varicosities.

Dopamine was the first signal to be detected in the time course of the applied potential (Eapp), signifying a faster rate of electron transfer for this cation, vis-~t-vis the cation 5-HT. Dopamine was detected in 10-15 s at a peak potential (Eap) of + 0.140 V + 0.015 V. Dopamine was detected without electrode capacitance to detect at the same Eap, the metabolite of DA, 3-4 dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (DOPAC), and ascorbic acid (AA). Moreover, the neurotransmitter 5-HT was detected at an Eap of +0.290 V +0.015 V within 10 to 13 s during each in vivo voltammogram. The electrochemical signal for 5-HT was detected, without interference at the same Eap from either the metabolite of 5-HT, that is, 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA) or uric acid (UA), which is a constituent of brain with similar electroactive properties to those of 5-HT. One voltammetric scan spanned 60 s. There was an 8.5-min interval between scans. The indicator microelectrode was activated by a 2-min cell deposition before each scan. Nonfaradaic charging current (Cdt) was eliminated in the first 25 s of each scan. Using a medium exchange technique, the analytes, DA, and 5-HT were selectively preconcentrated (conditioned) onto the working microelectrode surface in saline phosphate (PO4) buffer (0.01 M), pH 7.4, in a closed semidifferential circuit, daily for 3 days before its surgical insertion in VTA. This provides a controlled, increased sensitivity, and selectivity for DA and 5-HT detection in the electrolyte environment of the brain. A Ag/AgCI microelectrode served the reference function for the electrochemical circuit and a stainless steel microelectrode served the auxiliary function in this circuit in vitro and in vivo. Detailed procedures for the formulation of each of the microelectrodes in the three-microelectrode assembly are previously published by our laboratory (8) (9) (10) (11) . In addition, specifications for synthesizing the modified carbon paste, which actually constitutes the microelectrode detection device, are published by our laboratory (8) . As shown by others (5), possible stearic-acid electrocatalytic interactions between AA and DA, or possible nucleophilic reactions between glutathione (GSH) and DA, through dopamine-o-quinone (DOQ) intermediates are insignificant in physiological neuronal tissue.",

            "text": "The neurotransmitters and the behavioral movements of the animal were concurrently detected in vivo in behaving and freely moving, virus-free, male, Sprague-Dawley rats (Charles River, Kingston, NY). The weight range of the animals at the time of study was 290-310 g. A priori, rats were determined free of specific viral organisms, that is, Sendai Virus, Kilham Rat Virus, Reo Virus Type 3, Sialodacryoadenitis Virus, Rat Corona Virus, Toolan's HI Virus, Micro Plasma Pulmonis Virus, Lymphocytic Choriomeningitis Virus, Hantaan Virus and Encephalitozoon Cuniculi Virus. Although rats were group housed in Plexiglas cages (dimensions: I = 21\" \u00d7 w = ll.5\" \u00d7 h = 8\") before surgery, each rat was provided recovery, individually after surgery in a taller Plexiglas cage (l = 12\" x w = 12 ~ x h = 18\"). In addition, rats were treated with physiological saline (0.5 ml) immediately and for 2 days after surgery. Indicator microelectrodes were implanted in VTA-(A~0), under aseptic surgery with pentobarbitai Na anesthesia (50 mg/kg IP: dilute solution); booster injections of pentobarbital Na were administered once after the first 2 h of surgery in one increment of 0. l ml and once every subsequent hour (0.05 ml) to continue to maintain the appropriate depth of anesthesia. Specifically, the surgical procedure consisted of gently inserting the indicator microelectrode into VTA using a stereotaxic guide (Kopf Stereotaxic, Tujunga, CA). The stereotaxic coordinates were from Bregma, AP = 2.8, ML = 0.9, and DV = -8.6 (33) . Importantly, the Ag/ AgCl reference microelectrode and the stainless steel auxiliary microelectrode were simply placed in contact with cortex; they were not actually inserted into a specific neuroanatomical substrate. The three-microelectrode assembly was held in place with dental acrylic (Kadon Cavity Liner, Caulk, Becker Parkin Dental Supply Co. Inc., NY). The total time for the surgical procedure was 3-4 h. Throughout surgery, body temperature was continuously monitored with a rectal probe attached to a thermometer (Fisher Scientific, Fadem, N J) and was continuously maintained at 37 \u00b1 0.5\u00b0C with an aquamatic K module heating pad (American Hospital Supply, Edison, N J). The reason for this was twofold: (a) to prevent anestheticinduced hypothermia and (b) to prevent electrochemical Eap shifts, since Eap is temperature-dependent. Animals were provided a period of 7 to 14 days recovery after aseptic surgical operations were performed, although animals were obviously recovered from surgical anesthesia within the same day. Purina Rat Chow and water were available ad libitum and a 12-h, dark-light cycle was continuously maintained for the animals. Each animal was treated with a great deal of care throughout the surgical procedure and throughout the studies.",

Moreover, the behavioral chamber was equipped with side-by-side double doors (dimensions: w = 15.75\" x h = 23.5\") to enable a facile injection procedure. A series of infrared photocell beams were encased in aluminum frames around the chamber's perimeter. When activated with an IBM computerized circuit box, these infrared photocell beams detected the animal's position in the behavioral chamber on an x-y axes positional basis. Thus, multiple concurrent measures of the animal's activity were simultaneously assayed. The specific activities of each animal assayed were (a) ambulations (locomotor activity), (b) central ambulations (locomotor activity in the central part of the chamber), (c) rearing behavior (wherein both forepaws of the animal are raised away from the floor), and (d) fine movements (stereotypic movements of sniffing and grooming).

However, the present studies further elucidate DA-ergic mechanisms in VTA by assessing cocaine's action on DA in the freely moving and behaving animal, in a psychomotor stimulant reinforcement paradigm (48) . The present data support previous data that DA-ergic neurons in VTA-(A~0) mediate reinforcement processes (39) . The present findings indicate that a tonic-type relationship may exist between the DA-ergic response to cocaine in VTA and time. Such a response may lend an explanatory note to the hypothesis that favors cocaine-induced inhibition of impulse frequency rates by somatodendritic autoreceptor regulation. The data do not rule out, however, the well-known alternative hypothesis, that is, that activation of a negative feedback pathway from enhanced DA at the nerve terminal, can cause a suppression of cocaine-induced cell firing. What may be most contributive from the present studies though, is the actual demonstration that there is an apparent failure on the part of somatodendrites to completely suppress cocaineinduced enhancement of DA, despite a cocaine-induced suppression of impulse frequency. Thus, DA release mechanisms in VTA after cocaine are to some extent independent from somatodendritic cell firing components. Perhaps, such a disassociation could enable cocaine's potent abuse potential. The behavioral psychostimulant effects of cocaine were as ex-pected, as were the highly correlative relationships that were found between DA and each of the cocaine-induced behavioral parameters studied (10) . The capacity of cocaine to cause an anxiolytic response acutely, may also be important in defining its abuse potential.",

It is likely that the 5-HT-ergic effects of cocaine in VTA are derived from neighboring 5-HT somatodendrites. Supporting this suggestion is reported evidence of a 5-HT-ergic axon fiber pathway that relays efferent ascending 5-HT projections through VTA en route to medial forebrain bundle (6) . Consequently, cocaine-induced 5-HTergic effects in VTA may be influenced by cell body impulse frequency rates. In this way, an increase in synaptic 5-HT in VTA may occur as a negative feedback compensatory response to a cocaine-induced decrease in dorsal raphe firing rates (14) and/or to a (SC) cocaine-induced decrease in 5-HT release in nucleus accumbens (10, 11) . However, another plausible explanation for the present data is that cocaine might induce an action on 5-HT that is localized in VTA. Supporting this hypothesis are biochemical, radioautographic, immunohistochemical, and ultrastructural electron microscopic data that show or suggest that 5-HT axons not only pass through VTA, but terminate in VTA (3, 32, 41, 42) and/or form distinct synaptic junctions to directly innervate DA-ergic neurons in VTA (20) . Therefore, 5-HT-ergic release and reuptake inhibitory processes can occur within the VTA itself and cocaine may affect these processes either separately or in an integrative fashion. Simplistically then, cocaine-induced 5-HT reuptake inhibition may explain the present data.",

The present findings provide evidence that the 5-HT-ergic effects of cocaine mimic its enhanced DA-ergic effects. Indeed, both l0 min and 40 min after (SC) cocaine administration, synaptic concentrations of the two biogenic amines, DA and 5-HT are significantly increased to the same extent. Moreover, cocaine-induced 5-HT-ergic changes maintain a positive correlation with the cocaine-induced DA-ergic effects. The data suggest that the oscillatory nature of the 5-HT-ergic response may be modulatory to the DA-ergic tonic response to cocaine. Accordingly, 5-HT may act as a relay or a gating mechanism for DA-ergic circuitry. Thus, cocaine may relay its biogenic amine effects through raphe nuclei. Biochemical evidence of DA neurons in raphe nuclei (41) and pharmacological evidence for a modulation of extracellular DA by 5-HT in nucleus accumbens (13) , in addition to lesioning studies that evidence a 5-HT-DA relationship between raphe and NAcc (21) , would argue for the relay hypothesis. Alternatively, cocaine may gate its biogenic amine effects through a colocalized action in VTA per se. The fact that 5-HT neurons have been found to directly innervate DA-ergic neurons in VTA (20) , in addition to pharmacological evidence that DA neurons might be directly regulated by 5-HT in VTA (3), considerably enhances the gating hypothesis.",

Indeed, classical behavioral hyperactivity, even when the 5-HT syndrome participates, has been basically associated with activation of DA systems (28) .
