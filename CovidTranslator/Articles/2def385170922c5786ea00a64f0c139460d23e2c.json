However, most mucosal adjuvants used are toxic and the identification of safe delivery systems is necessary. Here, we evaluate the potential of a recombinant Autographa californica baculovirus driving the expression of the LC3 fragment of the Gal-lectin to confer protection against amoebic liver abscess (ALA) in hamsters following oral or nasal immunization. Hamsters immunized by oral route showed complete absence (57.9%) or partial development (21%) of ALA, resulting in some protection in 78.9% of animals when compared with the wild type baculovirus and sham control groups. In contrast, nasal immunization conferred only 21% of protection efficacy. Levels of ALA protection showed lineal correlation with the development of an anti-amoebic cellular immune response evaluated in spleens, but not with the induction of seric IgG anti-amoeba antibodies. These results suggest that baculovirus driving the expression of E. histolytica vaccine candidate antigens is useful for inducing protective cellular and humoral immune responses following oral immunization, and therefore it could be used as a system for mucosal delivery of an anti-amoebic vaccine.",

In Mexico, amoebiasis is ranked as the sixth highest cause of morbidity (2) , with the last national seroepidemiological survey showing a seroprevalence rate of 8.4% in general population using an indirect hemagglutination test (3) . Amoebiasis is most frequent in developing countries where environmental and population hygiene measures can be deficient.

A fragment of the Gal-lectin heavy subunit named LC3 (52kDa), which includes the carbohydrate-binding domain (8) , has been shown to be one of the main targets for IgG and IgA anti-Gal lectin antibodies recovered from patient\u00b4s serum and feces, respectively (14) (15) (16) .

Thus, recombinant complete Gal-lectin or its component fragments LC3 and LecA, the serine-rich protein SREHP, the 112 kDa adhesin EhADH112 and a 30 kDa protein belonging to the collagen-binding proteins familiy, have been shown to confer differing levels of protection against ALA development in hamsters and gerbils following oral immunization, suggesting a functional interaction between mucosal and systemic compartments (4, (7) (8) (9) (10) (11) (12) (13) (19) (20) (21) (22) (23) (24) (25) (26) . However, current limitations associated with oral or nasal immunization in humans include the lack of safe mucosal adjuvants. Most adjuvants used with animal models in immunization/protection trials are not acceptable for use in humans, including Freund\u00b4s complete and incomplete adjuvant, cholera toxin (CT) and the attenuated bacterial and yeast stocks mentioned previously (11, 12, 22, 24) . Thus, the search for safe adjuvants and optimum antigen de-livery strategies that are capable of inducing effective local protective immune responses against E. histolytica is a matter of fundamental interest. Diverse viral vectors have been studied to this end. One of the most promising is Autographa Californica, an insect enveloped double-stranded DNA nucleopolyhedrovirus (AcNPV) which can drive the expression of foreign genes in mammalian cells without causing cytotoxic effects (27) .",

In vitro, AcNPV induces maturation of antigen presenting cells (APCs) and production of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines, via TLR9/MyD88-dependent pathways (28, 29) , supporting its immunogenicity and potential as delivery vaccine vector. Numerous studies have demonstrated that recombinant baculovirus expressing target antigens on their surface (baculovirus display) and/or driving the cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter-dependent expression (baculovirus expression) confer protection against a broad variety of pathogens. Effective immune protection has been reported in murine models using one or both systems for several viral and parasitic diseases (30) (31) (32) (33) (34) (35) (36) (37) (38) (39) (40) (41) .",

Immunized groups comprised two by oral route with WT (O AcNPV-WT) or LC3 recombinant (O AcNPV-LC3) baculovirus and two groups by nasal route with WT (N AcNPV-WT) and LC3 recombinant (N Ac-NPV-LC3) baculovirus.

Oral administration was done by using a neonatal feeding tube in previously Sevorane sedated animals, whereas nasal administration was done by releasing 10 \uf06dl per each nostril using a pipette. Infected sham group received in the same animals 200 \uf06dl of NaHCO3 and 20 \uf06dl of PBS by oral and nasal route, respectively.

Capable of activating dendritic cells and macrophages in vitro, the Gal-lectin is also an immunodominant antigen recognized by sera from patients carrying amoebic infections (16, 44) . The combination of these factors poses E. histolytica Gal-lectin as the leading vaccine candidate against human amoebiasis (45) . In the present work, we show for the first time that oral and nasal immunization of hamsters with the baculovirus A. californica driving the expression of the immunogenic E. histolytica Gal-lectin heavy chain LC3 fragment resulted in the induction of systemic humoral and cellular anti-LC3 immune responses that conferred protection against ALA. Protection was observed at two levels: i) sterilizing protection, with no evidence of macroscopic or microscopic lesions and no liver trophozoites, observed in 57.9% and 21% of hamster groups immunized with O AcNPV-LC3 or N AcNPV-LC3, respectively (Table 1) ; and ii) partial protection, with reduction in ALA sizes and weights, observed in the O AcNPV-LC3 immunized group (21%; Fig. 2A and Table 1 ). Sterilizing protection observed in the O AcNPV-LC3 group suggests that the adaptive immune response elicited upon immunization, measured as anti-amoeba IgG antibodies in sera and spleen cells proliferation, was sufficient to avoid early colonization of liver tissue by trophozoites upon challenge. These results are evidence of immune recall and thereof immunological memory (46) . However, complete protection against ALA by both routes (17 out of 19 hamsters by oral and 4 out of 19 by nasal) was only correlated with the lymphoproliferation measured from spleens ( Fig. 4B) but not with the level of anti-amoeba IgG antibodies, as no differences in the level of such antibodies were found when comparing protected vs unprotected AcNPV-LC3 immunized hamsters (Fig. 4A) .",

            "text": "Our protection results agree with those reported by Ivory and Chadee where gerbils nasally immunized with the Gal-lectin heavy chain and CpG oligonucleotides as TLR-9 adjuvant were protected from ALA demonstrating, as we report here, that an effective immune response was raised after mucosal vaccination. However, in contrast to this report, we reached only 21% of sterile protection by nasal immunization whereas they observed partial protection before 5 days and almost sterilizing protection at 10 and 15 days (10) . Moreover, in counterpart to our result of AcNPV adjuvant activity conferring slight protection by itself, they observed that CpG-treated gerbils developed larger abscesses than those excised from PBS-treated animals, suggesting that this exacerbation could be due to the ability of CpG-ODN to activate innate immune cells through TLR9, a mechanism that might be shared with AcNPV (10) . Although the mechanisms underlying these differences are unknown, the different protection levels could be due to differences in the animal model, trophozoites virulence and adjuvants used for each study, as well as to differences in the compartmentalization of the induced immune responses. In control groups, low sterilizing protection (10.5%) was only observed in O AcNPV-WT, which showed neither correlation with spleenocytes response to amoebic extract (Fig. 4B) nor cross-reactive antibodies to amoeba (Fig. 4A) . The reason for the sterilizing protection observed in these two animals is unknown, but may be related to poor infection rates during the challenge with trophozoites. Protection due to baculovirus activation of innate immunity is unlikely, because of the low number of animals protected in the WT control groups. Taking together, our study in combination with those the mentioned above, and others conferring protection against ALA in gerbils by oral immunization with attenuated bacteria such as Yersinia enterocolitica and Salmonella Typhimurium, support the concept that mucosal immunization, and particularly the oral route, as a useful strategy for delivery of an effective anti-amoebic vaccine, not only against intestinal amoebiasis, but also effective against a systemic challenge. In this sense, oral vaccination is considered to be a highly desirable form of vaccination, being noninvasive, painless, and self-administrable (47) .",

            "text": "On the other hand, the baculovirus-based delivery system we used here, may offer an attractive immunization strategy because of the low cytotoxicity and inability of the virus to replicate in mammalian cells (27) . Baculovirus are known to efficiently drive the expression of foreign proteins in mammalian cells, being currently used for large-scale production of recombinant proteins of clinical utility (48) , and recently proposed as a novel tool for vector-based human vaccines (49) . Since baculovirus can only drive the expression of LC3 once inside a cell, our results also indicate that AcNPV administered by oral and nasal routes were able to transduce cells with antigen presentation potential, such as local DCs or macrophages in the intestinal submucosa and Peyer's patches, which in turn processed the LC3 fragment and present it to T and B lymphocytes in the draining mesenteric nodes, resulting in the specific systemic responses and varying degrees of protection observed in immunized animals. However, studies of AcNPV cell targeting in immunized hamsters by using labeled baculovirus should be carried out in order to demonstrate in vivo transduction of APC and other immune cells by the baculovirus. Our results are in agreement with many in vivo and in vitro studies showing baculovirus as potent adjuvants by itself, inducing DCs maturation by TLR9 recognition through MyD88-dependent and independent path-ways (28) , and increasing its capacity of activate T cells towards a Th1-biased inflammatory response (50) . Previous studies of protection against intestinal and hepatic amoebiasis have used CT as adjuvant (51) (52) (53) , a strong immune elicitor that can induce immunological memory against heterologous antigens in most animal models. However, CT is no authorized for clinical use in humans due to its enterotoxicity and potential harmful effects on olfactory nerves when administered nasally (54) .",

            "text": "Mechanisms underlying hamster protection against ALA conferred by the oral administration of AcNPV-LC3 remain largely unknown, but correlations with anti-amoeba cellular responses measured in the spleen were observed (Fig. 4 A and B) . Phenotypic and functional maturation of dendritic cells and macrophages as well as direct activation of B cells induced by AcNPV promotes antigen presentation and induction of a Th1 response and IgG2a antibodies, as shown in numerous studies (28, 29, 50) . The AcNPV adjuvant effect could be indispensable for the sterilizing protection observed in the liver, breaking the tolerogenic environment present in physiological conditions because of exposition to dietary antigens and microbe\u00b4s metabolites that are produced locally, as also occurs in the intestine (55) . Thus, it has been suggested that during an acute E. histolytica infection in the liver parenchyma, the functional activation of iNKT, macrophages and Th1 cells is needed to both, control infection and downregulate the effect of resident cells such as DCs, Kupffer cells and Tregs, whose activation usually induces tolerance (56) . Such mechanism could be present also in the intestine, where oral immunization with AcNPV-LC3 could induce local IgA and cellular immune responses, in addition to the systemic response reported here. One can speculate that a similar mechanism could prevent large intestine colonization by E. histolytica, therefore preventing development of human intestinal amoebiasis and ALA consequently.",
