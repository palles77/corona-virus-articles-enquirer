            "text": "Cross-species transmission of viruses poses a sustained threat to public health. Due to increased contact between humans and other animal species the possibility exists for cross-species transmissions and ensuing disease outbreaks. By using conventional PCR amplification and next generation sequencing, we obtained 130 partial or full genome kobuvirus sequences from humans in a sentinel cohort in Vietnam and various mammalian hosts including bats, rodents, pigs, cats, and civets. The evolution of kobuviruses in different hosts was analysed using Bayesian phylogenetic methods. We estimated and compared time of origin of kobuviruses in different host orders; we also examined the cross-species transmission of kobuviruses within the same host order and between different host orders. Our data provide new knowledge of rodent and bat kobuviruses, which are most closely related to human kobuviruses. The novel bat kobuviruses isolated from bat roosts in Southern Vietnam were genetically distinct from previously described bat kobuviruses, but closely related to kobuviruses found in rodents. We additionally found evidence of frequent cross-species transmissions of kobuviruses within rodents. Overall, our phylogenetic analyses reveal multiple cross-species transmissions both within and among mammalian species, which increases our understanding of kobuviruses genetic diversity and the complexity of their evolutionary history.",

Pathogens that infect multiple host species are more likely to emerge in human populations than host-restricted pathogens (Taylor, Latham, and Woolhouse 2001) . It is therefore important to understand the genetic diversity of viruses circulating in both human and animal populations and to identify possible cross-species transmissions.",

            "text": "Aichi Virus A-1 (hereafter 'AiV-A1') is one of several recently discovered enteric viruses associated with acute gastroenteritis in humans which belongs to the Kobuvirus genus (Yamashita et al. 1991) . Kobuviruses have a single-stranded, positive-sense RNA genome 6.9-8.4 kb in length. The genome structure is composed of a leader protein (L), followed by structural capsid proteins (VP0, VP3, and VP1) and nonstructural proteins (2 A-2 C and 3 A-3 D) (Yamashita et al. 1998 (Yamashita et al. , 2003 Ng et al. 2012) . To date, kobuviruses have been found in multiple host taxa including humans, lagomorpha (rabbits), chiroptera (bats), rodentia, artiodactyla, carnivora, and aves, as well as in environmental samples (Yamashita et al. 2003; Reuter et al. 2008 Reuter et al. , 2010 Kapoor et al. 2011a; Wu et al. 2012; Lodder et al. 2013; Smits et al. 2013; Oem et al. 2014; Pankovics et al. 2015 Pankovics et al. , 2016 . Kobuviruses are currently grouped into six different species (AiV A to F) and unassigned kobuviruses according to the latest report of International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (https://talk.ictvonline. org/taxonomy/). However, it is still unclear whether the broad host range of kobuviruses is indicative of cross-species transmission events. Additionally, there may be novel and unknown kobuviruses present in other host species; their existence may increase the scope for further transmission events between animals and humans.",

Different combinations of substitution models, clock models and population size models were evaluated by using the path sampling sampling to estimate marginal likelihoods (Baele et al. 2012) . The best fitting model was a general time-reversible model with a gamma distribution (G) across sites as the substitution model, with an uncorrelated log-normal relaxed molecular clock model and with a constant size coalescent process prior over the phylogenies. The MCMC chains were run for 100 million iterations with sub-sampling every 10,000 iterations and 10% burn-in. MCMC convergence and effective sample size of parameter estimates were evaluated using Tracer 1.5 (http://beast.bio.ed.ac.uk). Our sequence data were obtained from samples collected over a short time period (within 5 years) so cannot be used to generate robust estimates of the substitution rate and time to the most recent common ancestor (TMRCA). Therefore, we applied an informative prior on the substitution rate parameter using a normal distribution (mean rate \u00bc 2 \u00c2 10 \u00c03 substitutions/site/ year; SD \u00bc5 \u00c2 10 \u00c04 ) based on published evolution rates of the VP1 gene of related picornaviruses in both humans and nonhumans, as is fully described in our previous study (Lu et al. 2016 ). An asymmetric model with Bayesian Stochastic Search Variable selection (BSSVS) was applied to identify statistically significant transition rates between host species and geographic locations. Maximum clade credibility (MCC) trees were summarized using Tree Annotator and visualized using FigTree v1.4.0 (http://tree.bio.ed.ac.uk/software/figtree/).",

Sixty-three VP1 gene sequences were then amplified from bamboo rats (n \u00bc 23), rats (n \u00bc 39), and civets (n \u00bc 1) from samples which were PCR positive for kobuviruses. From the 2,097 extractions subjected to NGS, we detected 157 kobuvirus RNA sequences from total contigs with HSPs (high-scoring segment pairs) scores !500 by running BLASTn. The highest prevalence of kobuviruses was in bats (44%, 78/179), followed sequentially by rats (17%, 55/315), cats (15%, 2/13), and pigs (8%, 22/285). Kobuviruses had a much lower prevalence in humans (0.8%, 11/1, 222) than in the other mammalian species except in dogs (0, 0/45).

The time-scaled phylogeny of VP1 regions showed that the clade of Vietnamese bat kobuviruses and the clade of rodent kobuviruses were close related with a TMRCA estimated at $100 years but with some uncertainty (mean 99 years, 95% HPD 55-164 years). Vietnamese bat sequences may have a more recent TMRCA with mean estimate of 43 years (95% HPD 10-78 years) (Fig. 1) . Further metagenomic investigations indicated that the bat faecal samples belonged to two bat species: Scotophilus kuhlii and Murina ussuriensis.

Further ancestral reconstruction of Vietnamese bat kobuvirus VP1 sequences indicated possible cross-species transmission between the two species (with BF > 100), despite the limited sample size (Fig. 4) . In addition, we observed that the Vietnamese bat kobuvirus VP1 sequences were separated into two subclades.

Genotypes A and B have similar TMRCAs, originating in the early 1980 s (mean \u00bc 35 years and 95% HPD \u00bc 17-40 years for Genotype A; mean \u00bc 33 years and 95% HPD \u00bc 22-43 years for Genotype B). Phylogenetic analysis of VP1 gene sequences showed that the six AiV-A1 sequences found in our study all belonged to Genotype B with an estimated TMRCA around 2006. They were close related to other Genotype B sequences isolated from southeast China and South Korea in 2008 and 2010. Two AiV-A1 sequences (EU143279 and EU143278) have been previously detected in Dong Thap province in 2002 and 2003; they belong to Genotype A (Pham et al., 2008) . This result may indicate the current dominant AiV-A1 in Dong Thap province in Vietnam is Genotype B, the ancestor of which existed and spread in this area over a 10-year time frame ( Supplementary Fig. S4 ).",

We isolated a kobuvirus VP1 sequence (KT944174) from civet faecal samples taken at a civet farm in Dak Lak province. It represents the first reported kobuvirus in Asian palm civets. This civet kobuvirus sequence was comparable to canine and feline kobuviruses, with 70-77% nt identity. Phylogenetic analysis showed the civet sequence fell into the clade composed of kobuviruses isolated from carnivora, including cats (Felis catus), dogs (Canis lupus), and foxes (Vulpes vulpes), but it belonged to a separate sub-lineage from canine kobuviruses and feline kobuviruses (Figs 1 and 5 ). In addition, the phylogeny of kobuviruses found in carnivora (including Canidae, Felidae, and Viverridae families) matched the branching order of their host phylogeny (Cornelis et al. 2012) , consistent with no cross-species transmission events.",

In this study, although we found kobuviruses in both rodents and humans, they were phylogenetically distinct. We did not detect kobuviruses from people that had had close contact with rodents. We found that kobuviruses may transmit frequently between multiple wild rodent species in Vietnam.

            "text": "Similar to rodents, bats are one of the most diverse and widely distributed mammals. They are a natural reservoir for many important emerging infectious viruses such as severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronaviruses, lyssaviruses, filoviruses, and mammalian paramyxovirus (Johara et al. 2001; Leroy et al., 2005; Calisher et al. 2006; Drexler et al. 2012a ). Batderived viruses can be transmitted to other host species via contamination of food with bat excreta, or direct exposure to bat blood or excreta, or infection via intermediate hosts (Quan et al. 2013) . Pathogens derived from other animals may also spill over into bats, as some bat species feed on small vertebrates such as rats and birds (Morrison 1983) . Therefore, there is a possibility of a bat-derived virus transmitting to rodents living in the same environment or vice versa. In this study, we described a rodentlike kobuvirus from bat specimens in Dong Thap province in Vietnam. However, direct evidence of virus spill over between rodents and bats is still lacking. Ancestral reconstruction analysis indicated that kobuviruses are more likely to jump from rodents to bats, although this result had only weak support. Given that the common ancestor of the two lineages existed >100 years ago, there could also be an unknown host of both lineages and the host jump event may have occurred somewhere a long time before. In addition, the Vietnamese bat kobuviruses found in our study were distinct from the species AiV-F and unassigned kobuviruses previously found in bats, indicating that bat-derived kobuviruses are quite diverse. In comparison, high genetic diversity has also been observed among bat-derived hepaciviruses, which raises the possibility that other hepaciviruses, including HCV, may have originated from bats (Kapoor et al. 2011b; Drexler et al. 2012b; Quan et al. 2013 ). However, for kobuvirus, although the clade of Vietnamese bat kobuviruses is adjacent to the clade of human kobuviruses, there is no clear evidence to show that AiV-A1 originated from bats. Further investigation and discovery of kobuvirus sequences over larger geographical scales and in other host species may help to clarify the evolutionary connections.",
