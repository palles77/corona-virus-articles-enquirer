Methods: Study data were collected over a 3-month period from June to September 2007. The survey research method was used. A total of 1500 randomly sampled registered nurses from 18 hospitals in Hunan, China completed self-report questionnaires. Results: Of the 1500 nurses included in the study, 1444 returned valid self-report questionnaires. Compliance with standard precautions was found to be low in the surveyed nurses. With a maximum possible score of 80, the quartile range of the overall score for compliance for all nurses was 48.29 (upper quartile score 76.36, lower quartile score 28.07), which was occupied by 64.7% of the participants. The factors most affecting compliance were: standard precautions training (odds ratio (OR) 2.17, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.85-2.55) and knowledge (OR 1.94, 95% CI 1.01-3.41), followed by hospital grade (OR 1.61, 95% CI 1.79-1.86), presence of sharps disposal box in the department (OR 1.43, 95% CI 1.10-3.41), general self-efficacy (OR 1.29, 95% CI 1.04-1.59), exposure experience (OR 0.69, 95% CI 0.56-0.85), and department in which the nurse worked (OR 1.24, 95% CI 1.05-1.46). Conclusions: The relevant authorities and hospital infection control department should pay more attention to nurse compliance with standard precautions. Standard precautions training should be strengthened and sufficient practical personal protection equipment provided in order to reduce hospital infections and protect the health of patients and medical staff. \u00df",

The standard precautions propose that patient blood, body fluid, secretions, and excrement have infectivity, hence isolation measures are necessary. These precautions affect both patients and medical personnel. Isolation measures include avoidance of direct contact with patients and air-borne particles, and require hand washing and sterilization, the use of self-protection equipment, the safe disposal of sharp instruments, etc.",

These infections affect the quality of medical care and increase medical care costs. Data from the US CDC show that to the end of the year 2002, of 57 medical workers diagnosed with HIV infection following occupational exposure (including 24 nurses), piercing by a sharp instrument had resulted in 48 infections (84.2%). 1 Other studies have also shown evidence of clinical nurses becoming infected due to occupational exposure. 2 In a prevalence survey conducted by the World Health Organization (WHO) in 55 hospitals across 14 countries, it was found that 8.7% of in-patients acquire infections in hospital. 3 According to Mao et al., 4 the incidence of clinic nurses being pierced with sharp instruments potentially contaminated with infected blood is high. They reported the incidence rate of needlestick injury in nurses to be 80.6%. 4 Standard precautions protect patients as well as medical workers and help to control the occurrence of hospital infections. As the incidence of infectious blood diseases has increased and with the spread of non-blood infectious diseases such as avian influenza and severe acute respiratory syndrome worldwide, there has been increased emphasis on standard precautions for medical workers, and research into standard precautions has been carried out in many countries. Research in this area has mostly been limited to the survey of medical worker knowledge, attitude, and practices.",

In this investigation, the multiple correlation coefficient R = 0.60, which suggests a high degree of correlation of the above multiple impacting factors with activity compliance.

Li and Zhao 16 investigated the professional personnel involved in infection management in 22 second-class hospitals in Luoyang City, and found that 25.0% of them did not understand the concepts of standard precautions. Tang et al. 17 investigated 108 nurses in internship, and found that only 16 .7% knew about the standard precautions. Xu 18 investigated knowledge of standard precautions in 55 hospital workers; only 32.0% accepted pre-and post-training, only 16.0% of workers knew the indications for hand washing, though none had learned the correct hand washing method, and only 4.0% knew the scope of the standard precautions. Askarian et al. 5 investigated medical practitioners at hospitals in Iran and found that the median levels of knowledge ranged from 6 to 7 (maximum score 9). Monsalve Arteaga et al. 19 investigated medical students in Venezuela and found a lack of standard precautions knowledge among these students. Melo et al. 20 investigated nurses in one hospital in Goiania, Brazil, and found that only 75.6% understood the standard precautions as protective measures, 52.4% for both professionals and patients and 9.8% for patients with a diagnosed infection. In our survey of 1444 nurses, only half (n = 722) had knowledge of all the standard precautions or had received training. This indicates that half of the nurses had received no education on the standard precautions at all; some had not even heard about them from other sources. This is consistent with the results of other research. In our survey, 98.2% of nurses indicated their wish to be trained in the standard precautions. Whether in the univariate analysis or multivariate analysis, knowledge of the standard precautions was found to exert a great impact on the individual's compliance with the precautions (r = 0.24). Nurses with standard precautions training had greater precaution compliance than those without standard precautions training. This result is similar to the results found by Zhu and Chen 12 and Vaughn et al. 21 Our results indicate that senior staff involved in infection management should gain knowledge themselves and also train their employees.",

In this survey, it was found that nurse protection practices in the smaller hospitals were not as good as in the general hospitals. The reason for this may be that smaller hospitals are more basic, lack good infrastructure, and have no specialized infection administration departments. Additionally, not enough emphasis is put on the control of hospital infections. In terms of nurse working department, the compliance of nurses in the medical departments was lower than for those in the surgical departments. This difference was found to be statistically significant (p < 0.05), and is probably as a result of the greater number of chronic internal medicine and elderly patients in the medical departments. Also, there is no obvious presence of blood in the medical department, which may result in protection being neglected. These results indicate that the administration departments should focus on comprehensive monitoring, especially the monitoring of hospital infections in primary level hospitals.",

In our survey, it was found that 93.7% of nurses were in departments equipped with sharps disposal boxes; however, when the survey was carried out on location, they did not use these boxes at all. It is known that one-off collection boxes increase department expenses, especially in the grass-roots units. Due to economic constraints, protection equipment cannot always be purchased and provided as required by the regulations.

Our research results reveal a positive correlation between general self-efficacy and compliance with precautions (r = 0.21). Regression analysis showed general self-efficacy exerts a positive impact on compliance with the standard precautions (OR 1.29). These results are consistent with those of the investigations of Yang 27 and Wang and Huang. 28 It is very important to ensure the provision of high quality medical care and security by the prevention and control of hospital infections. Nurses play an important role in the prevention and control of hospital infections because they undertake a high proportion of the treatment and care of patients. The standard precautions are a basic measure in the control of hospital infections. Results of our research show that compliance with the standard precautions is low in nurses. According to the activity theory model-health belief model, the formation of health beliefs is critical for the acceptance of advice, the correction of misconduct, and the adoption of health activities. Most health behavior theories suggest that the most proximal influences on health behavior are attitudinal, social influence, self-efficacy, and intention/stage of change variables. 29 According to our investigation and analysis, the factors impacting compliance with the standard precautions include: standard precautions training and knowledge, hospital grade, presence of a sharps disposal box in the department, general self-efficacy, exposure to patients, and department in which the nurse works.",
