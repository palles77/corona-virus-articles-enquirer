[6] [7] [8] [9] [10] From June 1 to July 31, 2015, MERS-CoV caused the largest outbreak outside the Arabian Peninsula in the Republic of Korea, resulting in 186 confirmed MERS cases with 38 deaths. [7] [8] [9] This occurred when a Korean traveler returning from a trip to Qatar, United Arab Emirates (UAE), Saudi Arabia, and Bahrain became ill with a respiratory illness and visited several hospitals before finally being diagnosed as having MERS-CoV infection on May 20, 2015, at Samsung Medical Center. [7] [8] [9] This resulted in 186 people, including 25 health care workers (HCWs), contracting MERS-CoV infection; 181 of 186 cases were associated with hospital transmission.

            "text": "The exact mode of transmission of MERS-CoV to humans is not yet accurately defined. Epidemiologic, genetic, and phenotypic studies indicate that dromedary camels appear to be the main intermediary reservoirs of MERS-CoV. [12] [13] [14] [15] Camels are assumed to be intermediary host species for the MERS-CoV, although the exact source and the mode of transmission in many primary MERS cases remain unclear. Antibodies to MERS-CoV were detected in serum and milk collected from 33 camels in Qatar in April 2014. In one study, active virus shedding in nasal secretions and in feces was observed for 7 of 12 camels. 13 MERS-CoV survives for prolonged periods in camel's milk but viable virus became undetectable after pasteurization at 63 C for 30 minutes. 16 MERS-CoV has been detected in camels from Kenya; 792 of 1163 camels studied had enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) seropositivity of which 11 camel nasal swabs were positive for MERS-CoV by quantitative reversetranscription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). 17 A study of humans in Kenya detected MERS-CoV neutralizing antibodies in persons living in rural areas, although no human MERS cases have been detected yet. 18 The primary source of human MERS-CoV infections remains unknown. There are no definitive data on the epidemiologic link between human MERS-CoV infections and bats. Only one fragment of MERS-CoV with close matching to a human isolate of MERS-CoV was found in a study of more than 1000 samples from Taphozous bats. 19 Phylogenetic analysis of an MERS-related CoV identified from a Neoromicia capensis bat sampled in South Africa supports the hypothesis that bats are the evolutionary source of MERS-CoV but not a zoonotic reservoir. 20 To date, no sustained human-to-human transmission has been documented, although tertiary and quaternary spread did occur in the Korean outbreak. 8, 9 RISK FACTORS FOR PRIMARY MIDDLE EAST RESPIRATORY SYNDROME CORONAVIRUS INFECTION Several independent risk factors for increased susceptibility to acquiring primary MERS-CoV infections have been identified: direct dromedary exposure in the fortnight before illness onset, direct physical contact with dromedary camels during the previous 6 months, diabetes mellitus, and heart disease. Risk factors for MERS-CoV infection among camel workers include milking camels, contact with camel waste, poor hand hygiene before and after animal tasks and training activities, and workers with respiratory symptoms requiring overnight stay in hospital. 21 Viral RNA sequencing has confirmed camel to human transmission of MERS-CoV 22-24 after known exposure to the infected camels. Recent data suggest that although MERS-CoV is widespread among dromedary camels in the Middle East and Africa, zoonotic transmission of MERS-CoV from camels to humans is relatively uncommon, and human disease is not directly proportional to potential exposure. MERS-CoV does not transmit easily from person-to-person unless there is close contact, such as occurs when providing care to a patient in the household 25 or nosocomial setting when the diagnosis of MERS-CoV has not yet been recognized and there are lapses in instituting infection control measures. 2,3,6,7",

If patients do not have signs or symptoms of lower respiratory tract disease and the collection of lower tract specimens is not possible or clinically indicated, upper respiratory tract specimens, such as a nasopharyngeal aspirate or combined nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs, should be collected. When taking nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal specimens, Dacron or rayon swabs specifically designed for collecting specimens for virology must be used. These swab kits should contain virus transport medium. The nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs should be placed in the same tube to increase the viral load. 35, 36 A single negative test result does not exclude the diagnosis, and repeat sampling and testing is strongly recommended. To confirm clearance of the virus, respiratory samples should be collected sequentially (every 2-4 days) over ensuing days until there are 2 consecutive negative results in clinically recovered persons. Specimens for MERS-CoV detection should reach the laboratory as soon as possible after collection and be delivered promptly to the laboratory, shipped at 4 C if possible. When there is likely to be a delay of more than 72 hours in specimens reaching the laboratory, it is recommended that the specimens are frozen at \u00c020 C or ideally \u00c080 C and shipped on dry ice. It is important to avoid repeated freezing and thawing of specimens. 35, 36 LABORATORY TESTS FOR MIDDLE EAST RESPIRATORY SYNDROME CORONAVIRUS Accurate laboratory molecular diagnostic tests are available using highly sensitive and specific real-time RT-PCR (rRT-PCR). Three rRT-PCR assays for routine detection of MERS-CoV have been developed targeting upstream of the E protein gene (upE) and the open reading frame 1b (ORF 1b), and ORF 1a. [35] [36] [37] The assay for the upE target is considered highly sensitive and is recommended for screening, with the ORF 1a assay considered of equal sensitivity. To date, these rRT-PCR assays have shown no cross-reactivity with other respiratory viruses, including human coronaviruses, and were suitable to detect all known MERS-CoV strains in humans and dromedary camels.",

A range of treatments such as lopinavir/ritonavir, pegylated interferon (IFN)-a2a, and ribavirin have been used empirically for serious cases of MERS but there is no accurate evidence base that any of them improve treatment outcomes. Treatment with either lopinavir/ritonavir or IFN-b1b in the marmoset model was associated with improved clinical, radiological, and pathologic outcomes with lower viral loads in comparison with no treatment, whereas mycophenolic acid alone increased viral loads and fatality. 42 Macrolide therapy is commonly started before the patient arrives in the ICU in Saudi Arabia. A retrospective study of 136 patients with MERS found that macrolide therapy is not associated with a reduction in mortality or improvement in MERS-CoV RNA clearance. 43 Currently there is an ongoing randomized controlled trial in progress in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia comparing lopinavir/ritonavir, recombinant IFN-b1b, and standard supportive care against placebo and standard supportive care in patients with laboratory-confirmed MERS requiring hospital admission. 44 Systemic corticosteroids were shown to delay viral clearance in critically ill patients with MERS-CoV infection. 30 A range of anti-MERS-CoV drugs and host-directed therapies are being considered as potential therapies for MERS-CoV. 41 Properly designed studies are needed to answer several knowledge gaps for us to understand the disease pathogenesis, viral kinetics, mode of disease transmission, and the intermediary source of MERS to guide infection control prevention measures and treatment responses in MERS-CoV infection.",

Droplet precaution (wearing a surgical mask within 1 m of the patient) and contact and droplet precautions (wearing gown, gloves, mask, and eye protection on entering the room and removing them on leaving) must be used when caring for patients with suspected MERS-CoV infection. 46 HCWs should implement airborne precautions and wear a fit-tested particulate respirator (eg, The US National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health-approved N95 filtering facepiece respirator [FFR] or an European norms [EN] approved FFP2-FFR or FFP3-FFR) when performing aerosol-generating procedures for infected and potentially infected patients. Avoiding aerosolizing procedures in crowded hospital emergency or inpatient medical wards that do not have adequate infection control measures in place may decrease MERS-CoV human-to-human spread and environmental contamination.
