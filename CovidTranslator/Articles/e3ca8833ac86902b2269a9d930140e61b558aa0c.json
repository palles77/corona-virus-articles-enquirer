Funding for public health services in Ontario is based on a mixed model with municipal and provincial partners contributing to the funding. While funding is referred to as \"50/50\", in actual fact, the Province matches the municipal contribution, and goes further. An additional 10-15% of funding is made available through the Community Reinvestment Fund to offset the increase in municipal costs over the base year. The total funding for the public health sector has gone up by 55% over 5 years. SARS provides an opportunity for a re-examination of the funding arrangement as some local health units have had difficulty in obtaining funding at the municipal level.",

While many individuals volunteered for the response, other public health functions that they were engaged in had to be put on the back burner. The area of public health human resources has been the subject of many studies since 2001. Creating extra capacity takes time as public health professionals take a few years to train. For instance, a fully qualified public health nurse takes 4 years to train, a public health inspector 4 years, a public health physician 5 years post graduation. Therefore aggressive investment and strategic planning is needed to meet public health human resource needs.",

The arrival of the integrated Public Health Information System (iPHIS) at the turn of the millennium aroused an interest in Ontario, and a formal commitment to its rollout was made in the spring of 2002. Implementation was planned for the spring of 2003 on a staggered basis. SARS challenged the planned start up. However, an iPHIS module was developed and used in April 2003 during the SARS outbreak. At the time of writing, British Columbia (where iPHIS was developed) is evaluating the SARS iPHIS module developed in Ontario.",

A practical success story is the West Nile virus surveillance system where bird and mosquito surveillance served as an early warning system. The Global Public Health Intelligence Network (GPHIN) 3 system that scans raw newswire feed provides valuable alerts for influenza pandemic surveillance, based on events around the world. The use of non-prescription drugs can also be used as a sentinel for other conditions.
