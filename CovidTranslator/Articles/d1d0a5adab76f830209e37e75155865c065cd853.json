Although government agencies encourage less use of antibiotics in livestock (Weese et al., 2015) , the metaphylactic use of tulathromycin in commingled dairy calves has been reported to lower the incidence of diarrhea, otitis media, and BRD and improve growth (Stanton et al., 2010 (Stanton et al., , 2012 (Stanton et al., , 2013 and suggested to possibly reduce antibiotic resistance (Weese, 2006) .

Navel infections were treated with 5 mL of penicillin G procaine i.m. (300,000 units/mL; Agri Laboratories LTD, St. Joseph, MO) daily for 7 d. On d 28, 42, and 56, an experienced technician auscultated lungs of calves (right, anterior side of calves) to assist in identification of respiratory disease.",

Significant stressors in the life of a calf include castration, dehorning, weaning, commingling, and vaccina-tion (Hulbert and Mois\u00e1, 2016) , and these stressors frequently occur after 3 wk of age when respiratory disease is most prevalent. Stressors combined with the presence of viruses allow bacterial colonization of the lungs and are a typical reason for the onset of respiratory disease (Yates, 1982) . A common outcome of BRD in calves is decreased weight gain and wither height. Indeed, Stanton et al. (2010) showed that calves that developed BRD before 8 wk of age experienced decreased weight gain and wither height. Detection can be difficult but critical to treatment, and recovery from the disease can affect performance later in life. This was demonstrated in a study with 795 Holstein calves where identification and treatment of disease before 2 mo of age improved first-and subsequent-lactation milk production (Heinrichs and Heinrichs, 2011) .",

However, in calves without disease, ADG (0.13 kg/d) and withers height gain (0.04 cm/d) were increased by TUL versus oxytetracycline metaphylactic treatment. Our improvement in both BW gain and hip width gain between TUL and CON was consistent with the report by Stanton et al. (2010 Stanton et al. ( , 2012 . Stanton et al.

However, the effect of TUL on withers height growth after approximately 3 mo of age was uncertain, but wither heights of all calves (healthy and sick) were greater at 9 mo with TUL versus oxytetracycline treatment. Stanton et al. (2012 Stanton et al. ( , 2013 attributed improvements in growth to reduction of disease in calves. In our studies, the identification of disease was low. We speculate that that there was some level of BRD that was not identified and that TUL may have reduced subclinical disease to allow for more BW and structural growth.",
