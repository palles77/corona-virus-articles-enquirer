In M-day-old rats with a non-fatal infection there was a marked infiltration of T lymphocytes of 'cytotoxic/suppressor' phenotype in the brain parenchyma, whereas T 'helper' cell phenotypes mainly were located perivascularly. In brains from newborn rats with a fatal infection no or only few lymphocytes were detected.",

The age of the host animal strongly influences the course of many virus infections (Byington and Burnstein 1973) . For instance, neurotropic strains of measles virus cause a fatal necrotizing brain infection in newborn rats, while animals inoculated at 10 days of age or later are refractory to development of clinical signs as a consequence of the virus infection (Percy and Coulter-Mackie 1982) . The detailed mechanism(s) for the age dependence are not fully understood. They may involve a more productive virus replication in immature brains (Griffin et al. 1974) or reflect differences in the immune response or other host defence mechanisms with age (Johnson and Norrby 1974 ).",

T lymphocytes of 'cytotoxic/suppressor' phenotype recognize antigen on cells that also express MHC class I antigen, whereas T lymphocytes of 'helper' phenotype require that the antigen is located on ceils that express MHC class II antigen. Under normal conditions the nervous system has low levels of MHC antigen expression (Vitetta and Capra 1978; Schnitzer and Schachner 1981) , but an enhanced expression of both class I and class II transplantation antigens is seen during certain circumstances. Thus, experimental allergic encephalitis (EAE) induces an increased synthesis of class II antigen (Sobel et al. 1984; Craggs and Webster 1985; Traugott et al. 1985; Vass et al. 1986) , and y-interferon and coronavirus infections induce both class I and class II antigen expression on neural cells in vitro (Lampson and Fisher 1984; Wong et al. 1984; Fierz et al. 1985; Massa et al. 1986; Suzumura et al. 1986 ).",

To visualize immunoglobulins and B cells, sections were incubated with a rabbit anti-rat immunoglobulin. These sections and the specimens incubated with the polyclonal anti-MHC class I antigen were then sequentially incubated with anti-rabbit IgG (Dakopatts) and rabbit PAP (Dakopatts). Possible cross-reactivity of the anti-rabbit antiserum with rat Ig was eliminated by extensive adsorption by Sepharose-coupled rat immunoglobulins. The specificity of the antibodies was tested on frozen sections of normal rat lymph nodes and spleens. Omission of the first layer of antibody was used as a control. The peroxidase reaction was made according to Kaplow (1975) . Sections were counterstained with Mayer's haematoxylin. Slides were coded, read blindly and the mean number of cells per visual field was estimated at a magnification \u00d7 200.",

In accordance with a previous study (Striggtrd et al. 1986 ) we now detected Ox8 antibody labelling also on non-lymphocytic irregularly shaped cells. Certain heterogeneities in the distribution of the different lymphocyte phenotypes in the brain tissue were observed. There was a conspicuous perivascular occurrence both of Ox8 antibody reactive lymphocytes of the T 'cytotoxic/suppressor' phenotype and of W3/25 antibody T 'helper' phenotype in brains of animals inoculated at 2 weeks of age. However, the Ox8 antibody reactive T lymphocytes were also distributed more widely in the brain parenchyma as was their MHC restriction element, namely the class I antigen. These cells might therefore be engaged in a cytotoxic elimination of infected cells. In vitro W3/25 and Ox22 antibody-positive cells function as inducers of T cytotoxic cells . It is therefore of interest to note that the Ox22 antibody-positive lymphocytes occurred early during the infection.",
