Antiviral activity was found against Influenza A/B (H3N2, H1N1, H5N1, H7N7 and S-OIV), RSV, and herpes simplex virus (HSV). Very recent, as yet unpublished research data indicate that coronaviruses and parainfluenza viruses are also sensitive to the extract, reinforcing the theory that Echinaforce \u00ae broadly blocks membranous viruses. Prof. Pleschka, University Giessen, Germany, found that the extract modified the structure of surface receptors of Influenza viruses (haemagglutinin) required for entry into the cell. The data suggested that Echinaforce \u00ae interfered with the virus replication process at the earliest possible step (cellular infection), thereby preventing infection. Intracellular replication was, however, not affected by the extract, or only at higher concentrations. Even continuous passaging of influenza viruses in the presence of Echinaforce \u00ae did not result in the emergence of resistant influenza strains, whereas culturing of viruses in the presence of a neuraminidase inhibitor (Tamiflu \u00ae ) rapidly generated drug-resistant strains. Intriguingly, Tamiflu \u00ae -resistant influenza viruses remained susceptible to Echinaforce \u00ae .",

This selective support of the immune reaction was also observed in subjects reported to have increased stress or with a higher susceptibility to cold infections in the past.

Echinaforce \u00ae can also be recommended for long-term use in children, the elderly as well as those suffering from COPD, asthma patients or smokerspeople in whom the consequences of cold and flu can be severe. 2. Short-term prevention (weeks to months): During times of increased stress and poor sleep, it is beneficial to support the immune resistance with Echinacea to balance the negative effects on the immune system. It is in these situations where short-term preventative use of Echinacea (for a few weeks) can apply. During peak periods of viral outbreaks one is surrounded by people with cold infections (in public places or the office) as well as a higher level of active viruses on public surfaces (handrails, public telephones etc). This probably represents the most important scenario for short-term preventative use of Echinacea, with its proven anti-viral effects. 3. Acute treatment (at the first symptoms): While prevention may be of interest to a select group of people, acute treatment of cold and flu is advantageous to everyone. Here, it is crucial to administer Echinacea at the earliest possible opportunity, and best at the presentation of first signs or symptoms (usually an itchy throat or sneezing). By blocking inflammation and viral replication at this stage, the development of further cold symptoms can be limited, leading to a reduced need for nasal decongestants, pain medication, cough medicines and unnecessary prescriptions of antibiotics.",
