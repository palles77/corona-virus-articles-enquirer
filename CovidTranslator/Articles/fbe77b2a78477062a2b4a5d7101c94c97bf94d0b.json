The antigenicity of the expression products was tested using a number of polyclonal antisera and monoclonal antibodies. The polyclonal antisera recognized different sets of epitopes in the il62-residue sequence. The N-terminal region of one of the two subunits, S2, was recognized by all polyclonal sera and by two monoclonal antibodies. This clearly immunodominant region contains at least two adjacent or overlapping epitopes, one of which has been localized within 18 residues.",

Conventional vaccines do not exist or are rendered ineffective by antigenic variation. This latter mechanism is thought to be relevant for the epidemiology of infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), which causes a highly contagious respiratory disease in chickens. After recent outbreaks of the disease, new serotypes have been isolated that may have originated from the live attenuated strains used for vaccination (Kusters et al., 1987) . Obviously, recombinant-DNA expression products or peptide vaccines would offer a valuable alternative for conventional vaccines. The antigenic properties of IBV or other coronaviruses most likely reside in the peplomer (Cavanagh et al., 1984) , a club-shaped spike projecting from the viral membrane and consisting of a dimer or trimer of the E2 peplomer protein (Cavanagh, 1983) .

Apparently, this region is not subject to antigenic variation. This would be another advantage of the epitopes found in 52.Thirdly, the recognition of the N-terminal S2 sequence by several polyclonal antisera indicates that this region is strongly immunodominant.This would favour a response in all vaccinated animals.These considerations may become relevant as soon as the technology for designing effective peptide vaccines becomes available.",
