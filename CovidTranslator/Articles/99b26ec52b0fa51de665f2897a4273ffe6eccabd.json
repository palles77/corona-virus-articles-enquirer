PEDV is an alpha-coronavirus replicating primarily in porcine intestinal cells. PEDV vaccines are available in Asia and Europe, and conditionally-licensed vaccines recently became available in the United States but the efficacies of these vaccines in eliminating PEDV from swine populations are questionable. In this study, the immunogenicity of a subunit vaccine based on the spike protein of PEDV, which was directly targeted to porcine dendritic cells (DCs) expressing Langerin, was assessed. The PEDV S antigen was delivered to the dendritic cells through a single-chain antibody specific to Langerin and the targeted cells were stimulated with cholera toxin adjuvant. This approach, known as \"dendritic cell targeting,\" greatly improved PEDV S antigen-specific T cell interferon-\u2425 responses in the CD4 pos CD8 pos T cell compartment in pigs as early as 7 days upon transdermal administration. When the vaccine protein was targeted to Langerin pos DCs systemically through intramuscular vaccination, it induced higher serum IgG and IgA responses in pigs, though these responses require a booster dose, and the magnitude of T cell responses were lower as compared to transdermal vaccination. We conclude that PEDV spike protein domains targeting Langerinexpressing dendritic cells significantly increased CD4 T cell immune responses in pigs. The results indicate that the immunogenicity of protein subunit vaccines can be greatly enhanced by direct targeting of the vaccine antigens to desirable dendritic cell subsets in pigs.",

The disease mainly affects neonatal piglets often presented with watery diarrhea, vomiting, and 90-95% mortality in na\u00efve populations (Stevenson et al., 2013) causing immense economic losses to the swine industries (Schulz and Tonsor, 2015) . The causative agent of the disease is porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), an alpha-coronavirus in the family Coronaviridae (Chasey and Cartwright, 1978; Tobler et al., 1993) . PEDV encodes four structural proteins: Spike (S), Envelope (E), Membrane (M) and Nucleocapsid (N) (Brian and Baric, 2005) . PEDV S protein is a type I transmembrane protein. The extracellular portion of S protein contains major antigenic determinants, and is made up of three domains, N-terminal domain (NTD), S1 domain and S2 domain. The S1 and S2 domains contain potential virus neutralizing epitopes (Huang et al., 2013; Song and Park, 2012) . A recombinant, spike-based (NTD-S1) vaccine induces virus-neutralizing antibody responses in pregnant sows and protected their offspring from mortality (Oh et al., 2014) . However, the cellular immune responses of this protein subunit vaccine have not been determined. Recent studies showed that PEDV infection or vaccination enhanced the antigen presenting capabilities of porcine DCs in vitro and in vivo which subsequently stimulated T cell proliferation efficiently (Gao et al., 2015 (Gao et al., , 2016 . In mouse and monkey models, Human immunodeficiency virus gag antigens were targeted to specific dendritic cell (DC) subsets expressing c-type lectin receptors (CLRs) in order to generate effective cellular immune responses even at low antigenic doses (Trumpfheller et al., 2012) . More recently, we successfully targeted porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) antigen to a pig DC subset expressing DC-SIGN that effectively primed CD4 T cells in pigs at a low antigenic dose (Subramaniam et al., 2014) . However, the effects of antigen targeting to additional porcine CLRs are entirely unknown.",

Intraperitoneal administration of PEDV-specific antibodies obtained from sera of PEDV-infected sows reduced disease severity and increased survival of piglets upon virus challenge (Poonsuk et al., 2015) . Prior exposure of 11 day-old piglets with PEDV showed reduced morbidity upon re-challenge with virus three weeks later (de Arriba et al., 2002) . The reduced morbidity strongly correlated with the frequencies of PEDV-specific antibody-secreting cells in intestinal tissues as well as with serum PEDV-specific antibody levels at the day of challenge (de Arriba et al., 2002) . On the other hand, PEDV induces significantly higher CD4 T cell responses but not CD8 T cell responses in ileal tissues of suckling piglets as compared to the weaned piglets. (Annamalai et al., 2015) However, the role of these CD4 T cell immune responses induced by PEDV to protection in pigs remains unknown.",

Since higher affinity antibodies are desired for \"dendritic cell targeting\" (Cheong et al., 2010) , the 3B3 mAb was chosen for further analysis.

The recombinant 3B3 single chain antibody, which is a human Fc fused with 3B3scFv, also specifically stained the over-expressed porcine Langerin on CHO-K1 cells comparable with that of a positive control antibody 929F3.01 (Fig. 1B) . The Langerin-targeting PEDV S antigen, which is porcine Fc fused with 3B3scFv at the amino terminus and with PEDV S antigen at the carboxy terminus (3B3scFv-pFc-PEDVsAg) (Fig. 1C) , was detected as an approximately 210 KDa protein in SDS-PAGE analysis of transiently-transfected 293T cell lysates (Fig. 1D) . The porcine F c fused with the PEDV NTD-S1 only (pF c -PEDVsAg) served as non-targeting antigen and identified as an approximately 180 KDa protein in the SDS-PAGE analysis ( Fig. 1C and D) . In short, the recombinant 3B3 single chain antibody specifically binds porcine Langerin which can be produced as a fusion protein with PEDV S domains.",

First, we measured T cell immune responses against DC-targeted PEDV NTD-S1 in pigs. The peripheral blood mononuclear cells were isolated, stimulated in vitro with the recombinant NTD-S1 antigen, and stained for intracellular IFN-\u2425. Flow cytometry analyses showed that the CD4 pos CD8 pos T cell subset was the only subset showing increased mean frequencies of IFN-\u2425 producing cells in response to PEDV NTD-S1 (Fig. 2) . As early as 7 days after the prime vaccination in pigs, the antigen-specific CD4 T cell frequencies in the transdermal DC-targeted group were significantly higher (0.969 \u00b1 0.201, p \u2264 0.025) than those in the non-targeted group (0.395 \u00b1 0.158) and in the intramuscular DC-targeted group (0.483 \u00b1 0.067) (Fig. 2B) . The CD4 T cell priming sustained in a proportion of pigs (2/8) in the transdermal DC-targeted group (p = 0.027) until 28 days after prime vaccination (Fig. 2C) . At day 7 after booster vaccination, IFN-\u2425-specific CD4 T cell responses increased significantly in the transdermal DC-targeted group (0.391 \u00b1 0.107, p = 0.016) as compared to the non-targeted group (0.108 \u00b1 0.052) (Fig. 2D ). Our results indicate that transdermal delivery of Langerin-targeted PEDV S antigen significantly increased cellular responses in the CD4 pos CD8 pos T cell compartment in pigs.",

Similarly, no significant numbers of PEDV NTD-S1-specific IgA secreting cells were detected in ileal tissues of pigs in Langerin-targeted groups at necropsy (data not shown).

            "text": "The ongoing PEDV outbreaks in the United States have devastated the swine industry and currently there is no fully-licensed PEDV vaccine in the United States. Modified live PEDV vaccines are available in Asia, but the efficacy of these vaccines is questionable as they do not completely prevent virus shedding and outbreaks of PED continue in Asia (de Arriba et al., 2002; Oh et al., 2014) . Therefore, more effective vaccines are needed to eradicate PEDV altogether from neonates, growing and adult pigs particularly in breeding herds. In this study, we developed a novel spikebased PEDV subunit vaccine candidate that was directly targeted to pig Langerin-expressing dendritic cells through a single chain antibody. This vaccine candidate enhanced the cellular immune responses, particularly in the CD4 pos CD8 pos T cell compartment if the vaccine was injected transdermally. This is important since traditional subunit protein-based vaccines typically do not induce strong cell-mediated immune responses. However, enhanced antibody predominantly IgG responses but reduced cellular immune responses were observed if the PEDV NTD-S1 was targeted to Langerin pos DCs in systemic sites in pigs. Our study shows that the \"dendritic cell targeting\" approaches could be incorporated into PEDV subunit vaccine developments to improve the efficacy of protein-based vaccines by modulating the cellular and humoral immune responses against PEDV. Microplates were coated with PEDV NTD-S1 followed by blocking with non-fat milk. Diluted serum samples were incubated with coated antigen, and after several washings, the bound antibodies were detected with enzyme-conjugated secondary conjugates either anti-porcine IgG (A) or anti-porcine IgA (B) together with corresponding substrate. The sample-to-positive (S/P) ratios were calculated as described in the methods section. Serum samples from PEDV negative pigs served as negative control while those collected from PEDV-infected pigs at 44 days post-infection served as positive control. Each sample was measured in duplicate. Data on the y-axis represent the arithmetic mean of S/P ratio values \u00b1 standard error of mean, n \u2265 7. (*p < 0.05; **p < 0.01).",

The results of our study also indicate that the memory immune responses are indeed developed effectively in pigs due to Langerin-targeting of PEDV antigen as demonstrated by the increased frequencies of antigen-specific CD4 pos CD8 pos T cells which are considered as the effector memory T cells in pigs (Gerner et al., 2009) . The overall magnitude of CD4 T cell responses against Langerin-targeted PEDV NTD-S1 was comparatively higher in pigs vaccinated by the transdermal route, when compared to the intramuscular route, which is possibly mediated by either pig Langerin pos dermal DCs or LCs or both (Marquet et al., 2014; Romani et al., 2012) . This is consistent with reports that mouse Langerin pos dermal DCs are capable of inducing strong T cell immune responses in skin draining lymph nodes , while human LCs are capable of engulfing measles virus particles through Langerin molecules to present viral antigens to CD4 but not CD8 T cells (van der Vlist et al., 2011) .",

Our data suggest that IgG responses were slightly stronger against intramuscular administered tar-geted PEDV NTD-S1 when compared to transdermal administered antigen, however both groups showed this difference only after intramuscular boosting, which is quite contrary to the observed T cell responses after priming. This difference may be explained by the fact that pig Langerin pos DCs in systemic sites are a fraction of CD11c pos DCs which are classified as conventional type 2 DCs biased toward inducing Th2 responses (Bigley et al., 2015; Maisonnasse et al., 2015) . Therefore, it is warranted to examine Th2 immune responses against porcine Langerin-targeted antigens in systemic sites in future studies. In addition, when compared to the transdermal vaccination, the intramuscular vaccination route made the antigen more readily accessible in mucosal lymphoid tissues producing significant IgA responses against PEDV NTD-S1. However, the significant differences in antibody responses between the transdermal and the intramuscular vaccination were not recognizable at the serum neutralizing antibody levels at one week after booster vaccination.",

The affinity index ('a') is the measure of ammonium thiocyanate molar concentration that produced 50% decrease in the initial absorbance corresponding to the y-axis value 1.7 (dotted line). (B) Immunofluorescence analysis. CHO-K1 cells were transfected with plasmids expressing porcine Langerin or an irrelevant cellular receptor. After 48 h, cells were fixed, permeabilized and stained with indicated antibodies followed by corresponding fluorochrome-conjugated secondary antibodies. DAPI blue staining indicated the cell nucleus. 929.F3.01 is an anti-human Langerin rat mAb known to cross-react with porcine Langerin. (C) Schematic illustration of vaccine antigen constructs. pFc-PEDVsAg and 3B3scFv-pFc-PEDVsAg are the non-targeting and Langerin-targeting PEDV spike-based vaccine antigens. \"IL-2 ss\" is the signal sequence derived from human IL-2 gene. VH and VL represent the variable domains of heavy and light chains of the 3B3 mAb. NTD-S1 represents n-terminal domain together with the S1 domain of the PEDV spike protein. (D) SDS-PAGE analysis. Vaccine antigens were prepared from the large scale 293T transient transfections and resolved in 4-20% SDS-PAGE followed by Coomassie blue staining. Lane 1: pFc-PEDVsAg; and Lane 2: 3B3scFv-pFc-PEDVsAg. The molecular sizes were determined by protein ladder in a separate well.
