Soluble intercellular adhesion molecule-1, IFN-l 1 , and eosinophil cationic protein in nasal washes, along with blood eosinophil counts and total and allergen-specific IgE in sera, were also evaluated. Similar assessments were done in 24 young adults (16 with asthma, 8 without) who participated in an experimental challenge with RV (serotype 16).",

The odds for wheezing were increased if children who tested positive for RV were sensitized to one or more allergens (odds ratio, 3.9; P = 0.02). Similarly, neither peak nor cumulative viral loads differed significantly in washes from adults with asthma compared with those without asthma during the experimental RV challenge.",

A wide diversity of RV genotypes cause recurrent infections that lead to attacks of wheezing that begin in infancy, and these early childhood episodes of wheeze with RV are associated with an increased risk for developing asthma as children grow older (4) (5) (6) (7) . After 3 years of age, RVs are associated with up to 70% of asthma exacerbations among children living in both temperate and tropical climates (2, 8, 9) . The mechanisms underlying the role of RV in provoking these attacks remain poorly understood; however, it is clear that most children and adults who experience RV-induced exacerbations are atopic and have high titers of serum IgE antibody (Ab) to allergens, such as dust mite, which have been shown to significantly increase the risk of wheezing with RV (9) (10) (11) .",

This impaired antiviral response correlated inversely with increasing quantities of RV-RNA detected by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) in culture supernatants (12, 13) . In two other studies, the secretion of innate IFNs from plasmacytoid dendritic cells in peripheral blood was significantly decreased in cells from subjects with asthma compared with those without after stimulation with influenza in one study, or RV in the other (14, 15) . Additionally, the production of these cytokines correlated inversely with serum IgE levels or FceRIa expression on plasmacytoid dendritic cells, and IgE cross-linking on plasmacytoid dendritic cells before stimulation with influenza or RV further diminished this innate response. Taken together, these observations suggest that people with asthma may be at risk for higher viral loads and symptoms affecting their respiratory tract during RV infection.",

Although impairments in innate antiviral immunity together with increased viral replication have previously been observed in ex vivo experiments (12-15), we did not detect significant differences in viral loads in washes from the children with asthma who had naturally acquired infections with RV, or from the adults with asthma challenged experimentally with RV compared with infected individuals without asthma who were enrolled in these studies. This is the first study to evaluate viral loads among children treated for exacerbations of wheezing compared with those with acute rhinitis. Based on qPCR assessments, the viral load in the upper airway, where RV replicates vigorously, was similar in nasal washes from the wheezing and rhinitis groups, although viral shedding among the wheezing children tended to be lower. The prevalence of positive tests for RV was essentially the same in both groups. Thus, the odds ratio for wheezing based only on a positive test for RV was not significant among these children. However, similar to our previous studies in Charlottesville and Costa Rica, the combination of a positive test for RV and sensitization (IgE Ab) to one or more aeroallergens increased the risk for wheezing significantly (2, 3, 9, 10) .",

Additionally, the subjects with asthma with high and low IgE levels had respiratory tract symptoms (both upper and lower) that were increased compared with control subjects during the period of symptom resolution, even though the viral loads were not significantly different from the control subjects without asthma.

Together, the data suggest that the receptor used by RV to infect epithelial cells may influence viral load for the RV-A viruses, but this observation may or may not apply to infections with RVs that do not use ICAM-1 as their receptor (e.g., RV-C strains, or RV-A strains that infect by the low-density lipoprotein receptor).

            "text": "In conclusion, the results of this investigation suggest that the regulation of viral load during infections with RV is likely to be complex. In the pediatric study, the risk for wheezing with RV was significantly increased in the atopic host; however, the viral loads among the children with and without asthma were similar and the same was true among the adults who were infected with RV experimentally. Taken together, these studies suggest that the asthmatic response to RV is likely to result from inflammatory pathways that are amplified or independently provoked by RV, rather than from a higher viral load in the asthmatic airway. n Author disclosures are available with the text of this article at www.atsjournals.org.",
