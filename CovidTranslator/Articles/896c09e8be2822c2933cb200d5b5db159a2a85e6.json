Viral antigen was demonstrated by immunofluorcseence after infection of coverslip cultures by the method described for faecal virus reisolation. Infectivity titres of TGEV were determined by plaque assay on APT/2 ceils in 50 mm plastic petri dishes. Infectivity was still present after 2 but not 3 days at 22 \u00b0 C and was lost within 24 hours at 37 \u00b0 C. Virus could be demonstrated by both plaque assay and immunofluorescence in infectious samples. Blood was taken from the cephalic vein of animals B, C and D before and regularly after infection to monitor the serum for VN and I I F antibodies to TGEV. A microtitre test (15) was used to assay TGEV neutralising antibody levels in serum and the responses of cats B, C and D are presented in Figure 1 as the toglo of the reciproeM of the end-point dilution, calculated by KXRBEg'S method (6) . Antibody could not be detected prior to infection and animal A remained negative for the three days prior to sacrifice. The uninfected control also remained negative. In animals B, C and D VN antibody was first detected approximately i week after exposure to TGEV and the titres rose to maximum values of 102-2--102.a.",

Following experimental infection with TGEV serum antibody, detectable in the I I F test, developed and persisted similarly in the three cats tested (Fig. 2) . The I I F test titres were consistently lower than VN test titres. After hyperimmunization a marked increase in the I I F test titre was detected in D. This animal also developed antibody to APT/2 cell antigens in the I I F test, although the titre was four-fold lower than that of specific antiviral antibody. Antibody to F I P was assayed in an I I F test, by Dr. N. C. PEDERSEN~ University of California, Davis, U.S.A. (11) and in a suckling mouse brain-adapted F I P neutralisation test (5) by Drs. A. D. M. E. OST~R~AVS and M. C. HORZI~K, University of Utrecht, The Netherlands. No FIP-specific antibody was demonstrable in the sera before or after oral infection with TGEV. Antibody was detected by the I I F test in cat D within 21 days of the first hyperimmunization, however, reaching a titre of 102.4 which remained constant for the following 20 days (Fig. 2 ) but this serum failed to neutralise F I P infectivity in the mouse brain system. This experiment demonstrates that cats exposed to TGEV can excrete the virus for a period significantly longer than would be expected from passive transit of ingested virus. The eat could therefore constitute a practical epidemiological hazard to susceptible pigs. The ability of TGEV excreted by the eat to infect pigs or other cats was not investigated but similar work (4) demonstrated the ability of dogs and foxes to excrete TGEV which could infect piglets. Hence, contact between these carnivores and infected pigs should be prevented. A study of the replication site of TGEV in the cat was not possible with the limited number of animals. Virus isolation from only two of the animals tested may indicate some variation in host. susceptibility to infection although the serological responses were similar in all 3 animals. F I P and TGE, two antigenically-related viruses, are now known to infect eats experimentally but result in differing immune responses. Following a single exposure to TGEV, 3 cats developed homologous antibodies, detectable by VN and I I F tests. Antibody to F I P was detected only following hyperimmunization, which resulted in extremely high anti-TGEV titres. Experimental F I P results in no TGEV neutralising antibody but antibody to both viruses is found using I I F tests with F I P titres exceeding TGEV titres. These results provide serological evidence of a distant antigenic relationship between TGEV and FIP, perhaps due to an internal group antigen not involved in virus neutralisation. This situation can be compared to the closer relationship of the canine coronavirus to TGE, agents which cross-react in VN and :[IF tests (1, 12) . Hyperimmunization may be important in stimulating antibody to heterologous viruses.",
