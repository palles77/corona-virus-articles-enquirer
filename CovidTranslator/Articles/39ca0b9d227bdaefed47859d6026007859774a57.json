Basing on the impulsive model, the existence of order-1 periodic solution and its stability are proved with a novel method. The theoretical results indicate that the impulsive treatment triggered by the number of infectious is an efficient approach to control animal infectious disease from breakout. Numerical simulation is presented to support the theoretical conclusion in the end.",

However, animal infectious throw mankind a deadly menace with infectious diseases initiating from animals [1] [2] [3] . Some diseases such as African swine fever and bovine leukemia only influence animals. But to some epidemic, those pathogenic bacteria can be spilled from domestic animals or wildlife to human beings, and the development and mutation during the transmission will make the pathogenic bacteria difficult to control [4] [5] [6] . A lot of diseases besetting human beings such as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), SARS corona virus, Ebola virus and avian influenza viruses (AIV) all can trace their filiation from animals [7] . Taylor's achievement showed that about 75% of human epidemics stem from an animal source, and these zoo-noses are quite difficult to control after its prevalence among a crowd of human [8] . So preventing the formation and spread of zoonoses is quite important to public health of human beings. In recent achievements, some scholars have got some useful results in impulsive dynamic system. Among them, Jianjun Jiao et al. established an SIR model with impulsive vaccination and impulsive dispersal to analyze the effect of impulsive vaccination and restricting infected individuals boarding transports on disease spread [9] . Linfei Nie et al. proposed a state-dependent impulsive model with two control threshold values to study two-languages competition and they found the order-1 periodic solutions using qualitative analysis method [10] . Shengqiang Zhang et al. proposed a stochastic nonautonomous Lotka-Volterra predator-prey model with impulsive effects and investigate its stochastic dynamics [11] . Meng Zhang et al. considered the preventive control of computer worm's transmission through Internet [12] . Recently discussions regarding impulsive disturbance based on state feedback have dominated the research in field of control theory and optimization [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] . Enlightened by those research about impulsive model, we construct a state feedback impulsive SIS model to analyze the therapy control of animal infectious diseases. In practice, animal epidemic is hardly to be detected during its latent period because no obvious symptoms can be observed. Veterinarians can find the disease only after the eruption and then can treatment measures be carried out. Nevertheless, a certain amount of animals have been infected by the virus at that time. Thus, it is more appropriate to represent the treatment of animal epidemics as a state feedback impulse which depends on the variable of infected animals.",

Once the number of infectious animals accumulates to the threshold of impulsive set, human will carry out some treatment measures and the number of the infectious drop to the imagine set. That work costs huge manpower and material resources. In fact, since the periodic solution is unique and stable, the period of the periodic solution is a constant. If we observe the phenomenon that the interval between each time the amount of the infectious reaches the threshold is a constant, it forebodes the periodic solution has formed.

In system (1.1), impulse set and phase set are M : I = I * and N : I = (1 \u2212 \u03b8)I * respectively. Assume phase set N intersects the horizontal isoclinic line dI dt = 0 at point B( d+d 0 \u03b2 , (1 \u2212 \u03b8)I * ), and there must exist a trajectory L B passing through B and being tangent with phase set N : I = (1 \u2212 \u03b8)I * (see Fig. 4). Denote the intersection point of the trajectory L B and the impulsive set M as M B (x M B , I * ). For the impulsive set is below the equilibrium E 2 , i.e. I * \u2264 1 \u03b2 (r \u2212 d 0 \u2212 d+d 0 \u03b2K ), so x M B > d+d 0 \u03b2 which means the horizontal ordinate of point M B is larger than that of point B.
