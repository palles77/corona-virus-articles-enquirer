Technically, though, this goal is very, very difficult to achieve, especially for data input (compared to data retrieval and reporting). The ancient computing axiom of Garbage In, Garbage Out (GIGO) is always at work: GIGO. For example, if a specific tumor, like a variety of melanoma is not initially correctly entered into the electronic medical record, analysis, or retrieval of melanomas of that type may be impossible to achieve. Yes, a more general report, analysis, or query might capture the data in a broader category of \"cancer,\" but little more specificity may be possible. Similarly, medicine names are often so closely similar that typographic-or faulty memory-errors could cause life-threatening risks. Many antibiotics have similarsounding names, but the benefits, side-effects, and allergic complications can be very, very different. Similarly, many narcotic pain killers use terms that sound like \"codeine,\" but some are 10\u00d7 stronger than others, and could cause life-threatening complications from overdose or allergic reactions! Hopefully at some future date, advanced AI software might reliably infer and even correct information as it is entered. For example, a patient with chronic or reoccurring disease and treatments, the computer might predict the correct terminology during data input. Such a system might, for example, alert the physician or nurse that \"According to the EHR records, Mrs. Jones's osteoarthritis pain has in the recent past been treated with 100 mg of generic Celebrex, or celecoxib. Is that the medicine you want to prescribe, or do you want to continue with this prescription for 500 mg of ibuprofen?\" Or, a system might suggest that \"Mrs. Jones has had a diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis since 2009. Do you want to add a new diagnosis of osteoarthritis?\" For query, reporting or analytical purposes, the software might easily search for all potential variants of arthritis, or melanomas, or antibiotics. Retrieval, analysis, or reporting software cannot add specificity or details that are not in the original data, however, nor can errors be corrected. However, broad-based data analysis can take place, e.g., summary statistics of all patients with skin cancers, including all varieties of melanomas, are possible.",

Because of FDA's limited regulatory authority, virtually every EHR vendor is careful to document that its CDSS products are intended to be used by a \"learned intermediary,\" i.e., a licensed medical professional or under the direction of same. The FDA-and the vendors-use this distinction to clarify that the software is not intended or approved to deliver medical diagnosis and/or therapy without the supervision and control of an appropriate licensed professional. Since the FDA does not nominally operate, inspect, or impose itself directly in a physician's office, clinic, or hospitals, the daily use of devices is not nominally visible to it.",

The level of liability assumed by the device and vendor is quite a bit higher, too, since it is not necessarily controlled by a \"learned intermediary.\" Some products sit on the edge, or middle, of such distinctions. For example, a mammography breast tumor detection system could be used as a backstop for physician diagnosis. The benefit is the \"learned intermediary\" is doing the actual diagnosis, and the CDSS is double-checking his/ her work. Because mammography reviewers are known to encounter periods of mistakes, they often spot-check each other's work, which is a role that the CDSS can potentially do more effectively and consistently.",

If the underlying scientific and medical facts are crystal clear for the CDSS rules, and the rules have been extensively tested and approved in similar nonautomated applications, the patient risks are low, and competent human oversight is likely, the vendor may only need to document the intrinsic performance and reliability of the software and device. For example, a portable digital chest X-ray device that selflimits the radiation exposure to assure high-quality image functions solely within very well-known laws of physics. The voltage and duration of the radiation-emitting device can be automatically controlled by a radiation sensor and safety system at a level of precision that may well exceed human measurement capability.",

Physicians have gotten themselves in trouble-and injured patients-when the erroneous customization of their order sets prevented the CDSS from safe operation. Because many departments, specialists, and clinical situations require customized rules, and because the rule systems (whether ES or ML) are complex, large, and difficult to assess, verification that they are operating as intended, and/or validation that their functions are indeed safe and optimal for current medical care is a growing challenge. Take, as one example, the new hypertension rules, which define a lower blood pressure for hypertension diagnosis and treatment. In principle, every physician, hospital, medical device, electronic medical record system, and pharmacy information system may need every affected CDSS system to be updated, verified, and validates. Though cumbersome for an ES-based system, the method of retraining an ML-based CDSS may be much more complex, because the system may need to \"unlearn\" prior examples, or it may need to be retrained or tweaked in some manner.",

Modern AI seems to be encroaching more and more into areas of \"knowledge\" by leverage ever-increasing computing and memory capacity. Imparting or deriving wisdom into or from AI, however, lies beyond the horizon for now. For example, an AI-based babysitter may be able to \"see\" a child putting a fork or spoon in its mouth, and \"know\" that is safe. It may even \"know\" that a pocket knife does not belong in a child's hands, let alone near its mouth or eyes. A wise parent, however, will anticipate that a child may try to put virtually anything into its mouth, including toxic chemicals, nearby animals, or virtually any mobile object, and will add a razor, broken piece of pottery, or nearby worm into the threat category without delay. That same wise parent will apply the same rules to a grandparent with dementia without much prompting, too. Current AI programs are hampered by several constraints, including limitation of its learning to past events and rules, dependence on direct success and failure experiences, and an absence of \"awareness.\" When humans say, \"I could see that child was in danger,\" or even more abstractly, \"I could see that child was upset,\" we include a massive amount of personal and collective knowledge into our wisdom, judgment, and awareness. To date, AI has not demonstrated that capacity, nor the senses of compassion and fear that are part of our biologic heritage.",

Although that action might be logical and even at some level justified, human parents and caretakers, know that children learn from falling, scraping their knees, bumping their heads, cutting their fingers, and numerous other mistakes. Teenagers and adults, unfortunately, sometimes must learn from much, much more disastrous mistakes. Creativity and innovation come along with significant measures of risk.

In fact, facts and knowledge change as time, experience, and circumstances evolve. At one time, for example, antibiotics were mixed in soaps and product surfaces to eradicate germs, but we have come to realize that excessive or incomplete use of antibiotics has given rise to dangerous generations of antibiotic-resistant germs. Even rules of thumb, like the IV Therapy's \"Five Rights\" may inevitably be reconsidered as we realize we have overlooked, or might improve outcomes if we add more rights (Federico, 2015) ! Perhaps last, but certainly not least, there are significant ethical and societal issues being exposed in the development and deployment of AI systems in all applications (health care included). One of the simplest medical ethics issue is the right of the patient to choose to accept, decline, or cooperate with treatment. How, for example, should an AI healthcare system deal with a patient with liver disease who cannot/will not stop drinking alcohol or injecting illegal narcotics? Or consider the conundrum that faces the self-driving car industry: no-win choices and decisions provoked by circumstances. For example, if a car must choose from harming a child on one side of the street, a group of adults crossing the street, a pregnant mother on the other side of the street, or risk harming the passenger by running into an oncoming bus, what is the \"best\" decision (Silva, 2019) ? Is this dilemma much different than the choices facing a late-stage cancer patient, for whom chemotherapy, radiation therapy, surgery, and/or morphine all have complex risks, consequences, costs, suffering, and ultimately death?",
