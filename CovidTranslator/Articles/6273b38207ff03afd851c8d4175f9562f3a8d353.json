As of Feb 28, 2018, 2182 cases of MERS-CoV infection (with 779 deaths) in 27 countries were reported to WHO worldwide, with most being reported in Saudi Arabia (1807 cases with 705 deaths). MERS-CoV features prominently in the WHO blueprint list of priority pathogens that threaten global health security. Although primary transmission of MERS-CoV to human beings is linked to exposure to dromedary camels (Camelus dromedarius), the exact mode by which MERS-CoV infection is acquired remains undefined. Up to 50% of MERS-CoV cases in Saudi Arabia have been classified as secondary, occurring from human-to-human transmission through contact with asymptomatic or symptomatic individuals infected with MERS-CoV. Hospital outbreaks of MERS-CoV are a hallmark of MERS-CoV infection. The clinical features associated with MERS-CoV infection are not MERS-specific and are similar to other respiratory tract infections. Thus, the diagnosis of MERS can easily be missed, unless the doctor or health-care worker has a high degree of clinical awareness and the patient undergoes specific testing for MERS-CoV. The largest outbreak of MERS-CoV outside the Arabian Peninsula occurred in South Korea in May, 2015, resulting in 186 cases with 38 deaths. This outbreak was caused by a traveller with undiagnosed MERS-CoV infection who became ill after returning to Seoul from a trip to the Middle East. The traveller visited several health facilities in South Korea, transmitting the virus to many other individuals long before a diagnosis was made. With 10 million pilgrims visiting Saudi Arabia each year from 182 countries, watchful surveillance by public health systems, and a high degree of clinical awareness of the possibility of MERS-CoV infection is essential. In this Review, we provide a comprehensive update and synthesis of the latest available data on the epidemiology, determinants, and risk factors of primary, household, and nosocomial transmission of MERS-CoV, and suggest measures to reduce risk of transmission.",

Since the publication of the MERS Seminar in The Lancet in 2015, 5 MERS-CoV cases have continued to be reported in communities and hospitals across the Arabian Peninsula, with occasional cases in travellers resulting in non-sustained outbreaks in health-care settings in other continents. 4 In this Review, we provide the latest available data on the epidemiology, determinants, and risk factors of primary, household, and nosocomial transmission of MERS-CoV, and highlight measures to reduce the risk of transmission in community and nosocomial settings.",

Large health-care associated outbreaks of MERS-CoV have occurred in Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, and South Korea. From May 20 to July 13, 2015, the largest outbreak of MERS-CoV outside the Arabian Peninsula occurred in South Korea, resulting in 186 confirmed MERS cases with 38 deaths (20\u00b74% mortality rate). 4,6-8 The outbreak occurred when a South Korean traveller returning from a trip to Qatar, the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, and Bahrain became ill, and went to several health facilities before finally being diagnosed as having a MERS-CoV infection on May 20, 2015 , at the Samsung Medical Center, Seoul, South Korea. 6, 8 Human-to-human transmission linked to the individual's admission to these health-care facilities caused 186 people (of whom 25 were health-care workers) to become infected with MERS-CoV within a few weeks. The infection of 181 people was associated with hospitals. 8 This outbreak clearly illustrated how MERS-CoV can be transmitted from person to person in the hospitals of a well resourced developed country outside the Middle East. Following this unprecedented outbreak, the tenth meeting of the WHO MERS Emergency Committee 9 was convened by the Director General under the International Health Regulations (2005) on Sept 2, 2015. Since then, intermittent sporadic cases, community clusters, and nosocomial outbreaks of MERS-CoV have continued to occur in Saudi Arabia. 4 MERS-CoV is on the WHO blueprint list of priority pathogens 10 (panel 1) since it remains a persistent threat to global health security.",

Despite extensive investi gations, the specific source and mode of transmission of primary human MERS-CoV infections remains unknown. 5, 13 Although bats have been implicated as an original source, so far no definitive data have established an epidemiological link between human MERS-CoV infections and bats. Based on a study of 1100 bat samples, only one gene fragment of MERS-CoV in one bat of the genus Taphozous was found to closely match a human isolate of MERS-CoV. 14 Epidemiological, genetic, and exposure linkages between dromedary camels (Camelus dromedarius) and human MERS-CoV infection cases seem to indicate that dromedary camels are the main intermediary animal reservoirs of MERS-CoV (appendix). 15, 16 A study done in Qatar in April, 2014, reported that antibodies to MERS-CoV were present in the serum and milk of camels. Evidence for active viral shedding in nasal secretions and faeces was observed in seven of 12 camels, and viral RNA was detected in the milk of five of these seven camels. 15 In a systematic, active, surveillance study 16 in Egypt, among the 2541 camel serum samples tested, 1808 (71\u00b72%) were seropositive for antibodies to MERS-CoV (as detected by microneutralisation assay), and of the 2825 camel nasal swabs tested, 435 (15\u00b74%) contained MERS-CoV RNA (as detected by RT-PCR). Additionally, MERS-CoV antibodies were also detected in rectal swabs and milk samples of the camels. 16 MERS-CoV survives for prolonged periods in camel milk, but a viable virus becomes undetectable after pasteurisation at 63\u00b0C for 30 min. 17",

Compared with seroprevalence of MERS-CoV antibody in the general population in Saudi Arabia (0\u00b72%) in 2012-13, seroprevalence was 15 times higher in camel shepherds (two [2\u00b73%] of 87 shepherds had MERS-CoV antibodies; p=0\u00b70004), and 23 times higher in slaughterhouse workers (five of 140 shepherds had MERS-CoV antibodies [3\u00b76%]; p<0\u00b70001). 21 Substantial risk factors were identified for primary MERS-CoV infection among camel workers in Qatar: 18 involvement in animal training, milking camels, workers with respiratory symptoms requiring overnight stay in hospital, contact with camels' waste, and poor hand hygiene before and after animal tasks.",

            "text": "People in close contact with dromedary camels, patients with MERS-CoV infections, and health-care workers caring for patients with MERS-CoV are at an increased risk of acquiring the infection compared with the general population. MERS-CoV transmission from camels to human beings is thought to occur via direct contact with camels through respiratory droplets or saliva, or through consumption of camel products, such as milk or undercooked camel meat. 15, 18, 22, 23 Camel to human crossspecies transmission of MERS-CoV has been confirmed by viral RNA sequencing of samples obtained from infected dromedary camels, and from symptomatic 22, 23 and asymptomatic patients 24 after known exposure to the infected camels. A study 25 of animal herds associated with patients with MERS-CoV infection in Saudi Arabia found that the nasal swabs of 75 of 584 dromedary camels were positive for MERS-CoV RNA for about 2 weeks, whereas the nasal swabs were negative for MERS-CoV RNA in other animals, including goats, sheep, and cattle. Notably, 70\u00b79% of camels associated with individuals with MERS-CoV infections had MERS-CoV antibodies as determined by ELISA assays, and full genome sequencing identified ten MERS-CoV camel isolates that were identical to the isolates of their corresponding 25 Nevertheless, testing of sera from 191 people with various degrees of exposure to an infected dromedary herd found no serological evidence of infection. 26 These data suggest that although MERS-CoV infection is widespread among dromedary camels, zoonotic transmission of MERS-CoV from camels to human beings is relatively uncommon, and human disease burden is not directly proportional to potential exposure to camels. 26 Furthermore, although dromedary camels are a known host species for MERS-CoV, less than half of the people who have primary MERS-CoV infections have a history of exposure to dromedary camels. 4,5,13 On the basis of existing MERS-CoV sequence data that examined the phylodynamics between camels and human beings using a structured coalescent model, Dudas and colleagues 27 have shown that long-term evolution of MERS-CoV occurs exclusively in camels, whereas human beings serve as a transient and ultimately terminal host. Additionally, the study showed that human outbreaks of MERS-CoV in the Arabian Peninsula were driven by seasonally varying zoonotic transfer of the viruses from camels. 27",

Patients with mild infections can have low-grade fever, a runny nose, dry cough, sore throat, and myalgia. Patients with severe infections have pneumonia that progresses to acute respiratory distress syndrome, multisystem disease, and organ failure. Oh and colleagues 35 measured progression of pneumonia in patients with severe Review infections by scoring the number of lung zones involved on chest radiographs, and showed that pneumonia progressed abruptly after about 7 days of illness, and the severity of the symptoms reached a peak after approximately 14 days. MERS-CoV viral load in lower respiratory tract samples is higher than the viral load in upper respiratory tract samples. 35, 36 Additionally, extrapulmonary features including myalgia are common. 5,6,13,27-34 Up to half of all patients with MERS-CoV infections have acute kidney injury, and a third of patients who are critically ill have gastrointestinal symptoms, such as abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhoea, 29 and MERS-CoV can be detected in stool specimens. 37 Between Dec 2, 2014, and Nov 12, 2016, Ahmed and colleagues 38 collected daily information from the Saudi Arabian Ministry of Health on people with MERS-CoV, and recorded 660 confirmed cases of human MERS-CoV infections.

The rapid spread was attributed to poor compliance among health-care workers with wearing personal protection equipment while interacting with patients and application of AGPs, including intubation, manual ventilation before intubation, nebulised medications, and oxygen therapy. These data underscore the importance of increasing awareness and infection control measures at first points of entry to health-care facilities. 56 In Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, in 2014, major nosocomial outbreaks of MERS-CoV infection occurred, involving three health-care facilities in which existing inpatients, clinic patients, and visitors became infected following direct or indirect exposure to the index patients. 48 Emergency departments with overcrowding and poor infection control were the main location of exposure, leading to nosocomial outbreaks in hospitals in Saudi Arabia 49 and South Korea. 7, 8, 57 Two unlinked clusters of MERS-CoV infection 14,58 occurred at the same hospital in Wadi ad-Dawasir, Saudi Arabia, in the Riyadh region in early 2017.

In a Korean study, 64 591 healthcare workers who cared for patients with MERS using proper personal protective equipment were screened for MERS-CoV after finishing the patient care. The screening revealed that three (0\u00b75%) health-care workers had acquired asymptomatic MERS-CoV infections. A followup study 65 of a nurse with an asymptomatic MERS-CoV infection in South Korea showed that she did not transmit the infection to the 82 people they had been in contact with, whereas another study 46 speculated that a family cluster of MERS-CoV infections in Saudi Arabia was probably related to exposure to an unrecognised individual with asymptomatic or subclinically mild MERS-CoV in a hospital setting. Four generations of transmission among health-care workers in hospital, shared housing, and home environments were observed in Saudi Arabia after investigation of an outbreak of MERS-CoV caused by an index patient (a nurse with MERS-CoV and pulmonary tuberculosis) who had contact with 73 people. Although the disease was mostly mild, transient, or asymptomatic among the health-care workers, this study 51 has shown that health-care workers could transmit MERS-CoV to other health-care workers despite being asymptomatic.",

Investment in the development of rapid point-of-care testing for MERS-CoV would be of great value to the global public health community. The upsurge in the number of human MERS-CoV infections over the past few years in health-care facilities in the Middle East and South Korea was attributed to several preventable factors. Low health-care worker awareness of the possibility of MERS-CoV with consequential poor implementation of infection control procedures resulted in nosocomial outbreaks. These outbreaks involved transmission of the infection to existing hospital patients, outpatients, visitors, and health-care workers within health-care facilities. Transmission was associated with overcrowding, absence of isolation room facilities, and environmental contamination, without substantial genetic changes in the transmissibility of the virus. 58",

These precautions include wearing a half-mask air purifying respirator, such as a US National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health approved N95 filtering facepiece respirator, or a European Standard-approved FFP2 or FFP3 filtering facepiece respirator. The respirator should fit properly, and all health-care workers should undergo in-depth training for the proper use, donning and doffing of the respirator, and in performing a user seal check every time the respirator is used. 66 To reduce room contamination in the hospital setting, the application of a minimum room ventilation rate of six air changes per h in an existing facility is recommended. A higher ventilation rate of 12 air changes per h is required for new or renovated constructions, especially when caring for patients receiving mechanical ventilation and during AGPs. 67 Cleaning environmental surfaces with water and detergent and applying commonly used disinfectants (such as hypochlorite) is an effective and sufficient procedure. 66 Unprotected or inadvertent exposure of health-care workers to patients with MERS-CoV should prompt rapid quarantine and testing of the exposed health-care workers.

A surveillance study 70 for MERS-CoV in dromedaries in Africa and central Asia which used MERS-CoV spike pseudoparticle neutralisation assays has shown that MERS-CoV antibodies are highly prevalent in camel serum samples from African countries. Using quantitative RT-PCR, positive specimens for MERS-CoV were detected in camel nasal swabs from all the African countries from which samples were collected. By contrast, dromedary serum and swab samples from Kazakhstan in central Asia were shown to be negative for MERS-CoV when using these assays. 71 Phylogenetic analysis of the spike gene revealed that MERS-CoVs from Africa formed a cluster closely related to, but distinct from, the viruses in the Arabian Peninsula. These findings indicate that MERS-CoV is actively circulating in dromedary populations in Africa, but the MERS-CoV virus in Africa is phylogenetically distinct from that in the Middle East. 69 The finding that MERS-CoV is not universally endemic in dromedaries raises the hypothesis that some species of bats, or some other animal, the environment, or both, could constitute a maintenance community and be the true natural reservoir of MERS-CoV, and that the virus is transmitted to camels and is maintained within camels for varying periods of time. 71 The role of unpasteurised milk, meat, and secretions (saliva, urine, sweat, and stool) of dromedary camels in the transmission of MERS-CoV requires further study. The risk factors for household transmission include sleeping in the same room as a patient and contact with a patient's secretions. The role of asymptomatic individuals in nosocomial transmission of MERS-CoV infections to patients who are at high risk of infection needs to be clarified. Although AGPs such as intubation, manual ventilation before intubation, tracheotomy, and noninvasive ventilation appear to have played an important part in nosocomial outbreaks of SARS-CoV infection, 72 the precise role of these procedures in the transmission of MERS-CoV infection in health-care settings requires further investigation. Additionally, improved compliance with infection prevention and control protocols and adherence to standard precautions (appendix) are required to decrease the risk of human-to-human MERS-CoV transmission and the number of outbreaks in health-care facilities.",

[28] [29] [30] [31] 36, [47] [48] [49] 52, 56 Early recognition of MERS-CoV infections, improved compliance with internationally recommended infection control protocols, and rapid implementation of infection control measures are required to prevent outbreaks of MERS-CoV associated with health-care facilities. 77 The establishment of robust public health infrastructures, effective global consortia to enable rapid and effective detection, definitions and surveillance of new infectious disease threats, and the prioritisation of research, preparedness, response, and control efforts is crucial. 5 years after the first identification of MERS-CoV, many important questions remain. With no specific treatments 78 available, and high mortality rates, advancing knowledge on MERS-CoV through collaborative equitable international research and surveillance partnerships remains a priority. 79 Contributors DSH and AZ initiated the idea of the Review, did the literature search, and developed the first draft of the manuscript.
