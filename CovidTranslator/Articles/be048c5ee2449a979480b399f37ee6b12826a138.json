The minister faced several accusations: the SARS outbreak was growing, the Chinese government had covered up the severity of this problem, the Chinese government ignored Taiwanese who suffered from SARS, and the Health Ministry provided information that was neither timely nor accurate. He employed several image repair strategies (denial, defeasibility, bolstering, minimization, differentiation, attack accuser, and corrective action). However, his messages were contradictory and apparently related on false information, so his efforts were unsuccessful and he was stripped of his office.",

Zhang and Benoit (2004) investigated image repair efforts by Saudi Arabia following the attacks on American on 9/11: 15 of 19 hijackers were citizens of Saudi Arabia. The Saudi government relied mostly on denial and bolstering and was fairly successful at dealing with the accusation that it supported terrorism; it was less effective in dealing with concerns that Saudi Arabia had not sufficiently supported the U.S. on Iraq. Drumheller and Benoit (2004) examined attempts by the U.S. Navy to deal with Japanese casualties when the submarine USS Greeneville collided with a fishing trawler, the Ehime Maru. Mortification was used but not as effectively as it could have been: cultural norms in Japan stipulated that the apology should have been made directly to the victims' families. This study adds to that literature by analyzing China's Former Health Minister Zhang Wenkang's discourse (Zhang, 2003) on the SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome) epidemic to see whether it helped repair the image of the Chinese government.",

The international community was annoyed with China's secretiveness concerning SARS (Metzler, 2003) . Mr. Zhang and his health ministry withheld the effects of the disease that had plagued China since November 2002 (Beech, 2003) . It was not until April 3, 2003 that Zhang finally broke a 4-month silence to declare on behalf of his ministry and the Chinese government that SARS cases were only found in parts of China and that it was under effective control; in fact, the epidemic had escaped China and appeared in no fewer than 13 countries (Elegant, 2003) . Tragically, the killer virus undercut China's new image, which refers to the new and heralded leadership of Hu Jintao that had been making efforts to establish a newly founded transparency and more open communication since he formally assumed office as China's political supremo in March 2003 (Metzler, 2003) . Of course, a government's image may not change overnight.",

            "text": "This study investigates whether Minister Zhang Wenkang's discourse on SARS repaired the image of the Chinese government. This study first revisits Benoit's theory of image restoration (1995), and then it analyzes Minister Zhang Wenkang's discourse on SARS. Finally, this study critiques the effectiveness of his messages and discusses the findings of the analysis. Benoit (1995) proposes a comprehensive theory of image restoration, which he now prefers to call \"image repair\" (Benoit, 2000; Metzler, 2001) . This theory focuses on the genre of defensive communication used to \"reduce, redress or avoid damage to a reputation\" (Benoit, 1995, p. vii) . In this case, \"restoring, or protecting one's reputation is a primary goal after a crisis\" (Benoit, 1995, p. 71 ). Seeger and Ulmer (2002) assert Benoit's theory is widely applied to messages offered by organizations following crisis although it is not specifically offered as a theoretical framework for organizational discourse. Accordingly, this study employs this theory to guide its analysis of former Chinese Health Minister Zhang Wenkang's discourse on repairing the Chinese government's image after the SARS crisis emerged. Fishman (1999) notes that Benoit's theory is based upon the assumption that an individual's or an organization's most important asset is its reputation. Benoit's theory offers a total of 14 image repair strategies (Benoit, 1995) that individuals or organizations could adopt to restore their image (Fishman, 1999) after an attack or a crisis. Benoit (1995) groups his strategies into five broad categories (see Table 1 ). Table 1 shows that the first image repair strategy is denial. Denial manifests in two variants: simple denial and shifting the blame to another party. Benoit (1995) notes that simple denial happens when a defense claims that an undesirable act did not occur or that the accused was not the one who performed it. Fishman (1999) asserts that the advantage of shifting blame is that it allows an organization or individual to portray itself as a victim of unfair allegations, and/or to direct attention to a scapegoat.",

            "text": "Overseas correspondents also considered Zhang's assertion that his ministry had cooperated and would continue to cooperate with WTO not apparently supported by the facts. For example, at the press conference a journalist asked Zhang to clear up why he should say travel in China was safe on April 3, 2003 given that the day before WHO warned people around the world not to go to Hong Kong and southern China. As we noted, Zhang claimed that WHO's warning was based on its ignorance of the situation in southern China. Zhang's tones raised concerns about his attempts to bolster the Chinese government's cooperation with WHO. Second, much of Minister Zhang's argumentation and explanation was based on inaccurate data and statements that appeared to be false. For example, minimization was a major strategy for Zhang. However, these claims were not persuasive for his audience. WHO's statistics showed over 1800 cases of SARS in Guangdong from the end of 2002 to June 24, 2003 (WHO, 2003b . Similarly, he claimed on April 3 that Beijing only had 12 cases, three of whom had died of SARA. Jiang revealed to Time (Asia) that one hospital had admitted 60 SARS patients of whom seven had died (Jakes, 2003) . Consequently, Zhang's strategy of minimization did not work; these apparently false statements also likely undermined his credibility. On April 8, 2003, accurate data of the SARS cases and deaths were formally released by Executive Vice Minister at a press conference on April 20, 2003. He reported that Beijing had experienced 339 diagnosed SARS cases and 402 suspected cases. It was also on this day that Minister Zhang's dismissal was announced.",

In the Lewinsky affair, Former President Clinton relied primarily on total denial in the first wave of discourse (Blaney & Benoit, 2001) . At the beginning, Minister Zhang denied the SARS outbreak was rampant and growing, claiming that SARS was under effective control. When such defenses fail, rhetors will normally quickly switch to another strategy. Once forced to admit his improper relationship with Miss Lewinsky, Clinton \"abandoned denial for transcendence\" (Benoit & McHale, 1999, p. 277) . After Zhang denied the SARS situation in China was serious for the first time, he wasted no time in switching his strategy to bolstering.",

When his denials became unsupportable, Clinton admitted having an improper relationship and employed mortification. In the final stage, \"Clinton's image restoration strategies were mostly successful\" (Blaney and Benoit, p. 105) . Of course, sometimes rhetors can wait too long to use mortification, as with President Nixon and the Watergate affair (Benoit, 1982) . In comparison to these former U.S. presidents, Zhang never used mortification in his discourse. Even when his simple denial was spotted self-contradictory at the conference, he still stubbornly denied his wrongful act: covering up the true situation of SARS and lying about the true infections and deaths caused by SARS. That is why Zhang was finally sacked for his failure to provide up-to-date and correct SARS figures and to be well prepared against the sudden public health hazards (Newsmax Wires, 2003) . Put in other words, Zhang was stripped from his post of minister because of his destruction of the government's image.",
