In particular, the propensity of these peptides to assume an ordered structure was investigated upon by changing the solvent's polarity and the temperature. A reduction of solvent polarity led to a significant increase in the \u03b1-helix content in the case of HR1, whereas only a slight change in the secondary structure was observed in the case of HR2. In both cases the conformational change followed a two-state transition model. The interaction of the peptides was monitored by the conformational change in the mixture with respect to the single peptides. However, formation of the complex did not significantly enhance thermal stability. A reliable estimation of the secondary structure was obtained by optimising the experimental conditions to collect CD data down to 180 nm, and by comparing the structure data yielded by different software packages.",

Even though the fusion proteins belonging to this class, like hemagglutinin, HIV gp41, SARS-CoV glycoproteins, and paramyxovirus F protein [1] are not well correlated in terms of sequence homology [2] , they share some common structural and functional features. In particular, Class I fusion glycoproteins contain two key structural elements. The hydrophobic fusion peptide domain can penetrate the target membrane thereby forming a bridge between the two membranes [1] [2] [3] . Downstream of the target membrane, two other sequences called Heptad Repeats (HR) are involved in the steps leading to lipid mixing and membrane fusion [1] [2] [3] . The two HRs consist of seven-amino acids arrays where the first and fourth positions are occupied by hydrophobic residues determining a strong propensity to assume a \u03b1-helical conformation as solvent polarity decreases and the hydrophobic positions become exposed. These stretches, generally named Nterminal (HR1) and C-terminal (HR2), are usually located downstream of the fusion peptide and upstream from the transmembrane domain respectively. As the protein is assumed to trimerize to trigger fusion [1, 2] , the crucial refolding leads to the formation of a triple helical coiled-coil structure (a six-helix bundle) due to the interaction of three C-term HRs with a trimeric core of N-term HRs.",

            "text": "Herpes Simplex Virus type I (HSV) entry into the eukaryotic cell requires a pool of glycoproteins not yet completely characterized, four of which are essential for the fusion mechanism [3, 4] . After target recognition upon the interaction of gD and one of the cell receptors, a complex concerted mechanism involves three other glycoproteins, namely gB, gH and gL. The emerging role of gH as the executor of fusion triggers a deeper characterization of the key structural elements of this viral fusion protein. Recent works have identified gH's fusion peptide and HRs. In particular, the HRs of gH were characterized first by bioinformatic prediction and then by in vitro studies of mutagenesis and inhibition/reversion of infectivity. The bioinformatic search posed the N-terminal HR with a high propensity to assume a coiled-coil conformation, called HR-1, at residues 443-475, while HR-2 was located at amino acids 556-585. Sitespecific mutagenesis and sequence substitution revealed the crucial role in viral fusion. To elucidate the details of the whole mechanism, synthetic peptides mimicking the native sequences involved in fusion are widely used also because of the major therapeutic implications arising from the development of peptidomimetic drugs. Many systems have been investigated through this path ( [1, 2] , and, as an example, ref. [5] ). Two synthetic peptides of 25 aa each, gH-HR1-25 (444-468, abbr. HR1-25) and gH-HR2-25 (556-580, abbr. HR2-25), have already been tested in vitro for their ability to reduce viral infection, and in particular viral fusion, and to prove their reciprocal interaction, as demonstrated by NPAGE and reversion of infectivity inhibition [6] .",

            "text": "Finally, a secondary structure analysis was performed. As the exact protein concentration cannot be established in the case of the 1:1 mixture solutions and the difference spectra, because the exact number of residues involved is unknown, MLR method was chosen, even though the limits of an unconstrained fit based on linear regression has been widely reviewed (see, for example, ref. [13, 14, 17] ). The results of the analysis of the individual peptides, the mixture and the difference spectra are summarised in Table 1 . The secondary structure changes as a function of TFE percentage for each sample are shown in Fig. 3 . MLR seems to overestimate the absolute structure content by about 10% with respect to the previous analyses. As far as conformational changes are concerned, the crucial parameters were the maximum conformational changes occurring between 0% and 15% TFE ( Table 2) . For HR1-25 and HR2-25, the difference in the \u03b1-helix content determined by MLR was compared to that evaluated by ellipticity value at 222 and 208 nm. Even if MLR still seemed to slightly overestimate \u03b1helix content in HR2-25, the quantified conformational changes were in good agreement. This gives reliability to the estimate of the entity of conformational variation undergone by the mixture that is translated into a conformational change of the non-covalent complex of HR1-25 and HR2-25 as revealed by the analysis on the difference spectra, even if this conformational change is small. Our group already noted the formation of this complex [6] , as confirmed by an NPAGE study [6] . Mixing HR1-25 with increasing amounts of HR2-25, up to 1/1 molar ratio showed the formation of a simple hetero dimer, eventhough the possible presence of multimers was monitored. The higher order oligomers should arise from the binding of the irregular parts of the peptides, in addition to the helix-helix dimer formation. Recently, another work [21] on longer peptides derived from the same gH regions achieved similar results, but many more CD data were collected in the present investigation by working further in the UV range. TFE is widely used in conformational studies because it promotes intramolecular hydrogen bonds in spite of intermolecular interaction with water molecules thereby enhancing \u03b1helix formation [17] [18] [19] . Moreover, as TFE lowers the polarity of the solution, the environmental changes explored by the peptides resemble those of the native sequences during the fusion process. Indeed, similar studies on HR sequences and fusion peptides mimicking sequences used TFE in circular dichroism analysis [6, 7, 20, 21] . So, the effect of 10% and 15% TFE was compared to that of 10% and 15% ACN, the latter solvent being less efficient in stabilizing ordered structures (Fig. 4) . Shapes of the spectra revealed a stabilization of the random conformation to the detriment of \u03b1-helix content. This is particularly true for HR1-25, that has a high content of \u03b1-helix in the presence of 10% and 15% TFE. The [\u03b8] 222 nm /[\u03b8] 208 nm ratio confirmed the transitions described for HR1-25, HR2-25 and the 1:1 mixture, as reported in Table 3 . These spectra were obtained from peptides at pH = 5.5 either in ACN or TFE. The fact that pH did not affect the structural content of the two peptides is consistent with the finding that the fusion process in which gH participates does not strictly depend on a decrease of pH [22] .",

Thermal denaturation experiments in 100% PBS solution did not significantly affect the \u03b8 222 CD values because the peptides, singly and in the 1:1 mixture, assumed an almost disordered structure in those experimental conditions. A slight decrease in ellipticity was observed but it was associated with \"fraying\" of the ends of the peptides in solutions (Fig. 5, panel  A) . In the presence of 10%TFE, HR2-25 CD signal was still not affected by thermal denaturation, whereas HR1-25 and the mixture revealed a significant decrease of the ellipticity absolute value at 222 nm (Fig. 5, panel B) . The first derivatives curve of HR1-25 showed a maximum at 42\u00b0C, the T m of the peptide in this condition, while the 1:1 mixture showed a T m of 37\u00b0C (Fig.  6, panel A) . This is quite surprising, because stabilization to thermal denaturation is expected as a consequence of formation of a complex between the two peptides. However the T m of the mixture is relatively close to that of HR1. Thus the behaviour of the mixture does not resemble the mean behaviour of the two peptides in the same solution, even though triggered by the So far, Selcon3 for HR1-25 gave poor results. However, this parameter is only a symptom of similarity between the two mentioned spectra, and a good NMRSD does not necessary imply a better estimate of fraction. So the final estimate reported in Table 4 include all the values. a Structures estimated are \u03b1-helix, regular (R) and distorted (D), \u03b2-sheet, regular (R) and distorted (D), \u03b2-turn and non-ordered structure. b For details about basis spectra, see ref.

Circular dichroism studies are a straightforward way to highlight the secondary structure of peptides and proteins in solution and their variations.

This tendency was assessed by the broadly different information that can be extrapolated from CD spectra. This study processed data using parameters like the ellipticity value at 222 nm or the [\u03b8] 222 nm /[\u03b8] 208 nm ratio that are as widely used as critically accepted. Only the complete spectrum contains all the structural information on the peptide (or protein) analysed. Those parameters, however, if conveniently supported, help to reveal the propensity to conformational variation as a function of different environmental conditions that is a real concern when investigating a chemical reconstructed model of a more complex biological system. The structural estimate obtained by CDPro and MLR should be interpreted in this light. Making every effort to work in the best spectroscopic and \"deconvolution\" conditions, this is actually quite difficult if a native environment has to be maintained or reproduced. So far, a program, like MLR, though not as sophisticated as the newly available algorithms, has been chosen for its advantages in estimating secondary structure from spectra with unknown concentration, such as the difference and mixture spectra, and because of a reference set which is very small, but contains peptide spectra. On the other hand, CDPro offers three refined programs with multiple basis sets that may also include denaturated and membrane proteins, but require high resolution spectra (at least close to 180 nm) and a wellknown concentration of sample to give a reliable estimate of structure. However, the structural features of a peptide may be not well represented by protein reference sets, and vice versa, and the analysis could be biased. Despite the questionable limits and assumptions of the methods used, CDPro and MLR, like all the other parameters evaluated, quantitatively express what is qualitatively illustrated in the CD spectra: the structure of the two peptides is solvent-dependent, and appropriate environment conditions promote \u03b1-helix conformations that may be differently involved in the different steps of either the fusion process involving the native protein, or the inhibition of the fusion mechanism involving the synthetic peptides.",
