Upon recognition of microbes by innate immune cells, such as macrophages and dendritic cells, diverse signalling pathways are activated that combine to define inflammatory responses that direct sterilisation of the threat and/or orchestrate development of the adaptive immune response. Innate immune signalling must be carefully controlled and regulation comes in part from interactions between activating and inhibiting signalling receptors. In recent years, an increasing number of pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), including C-type lectin receptors and Toll-like receptors (TLRs), has been described that participate in innate recognition of microbes, especially through the so called pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs). Recent studies demonstrate strong interactions between signalling through these receptors. Whereas useful models to study these receptors in great detail in the murine and human system are now emerging, relatively little is known regarding these receptors in companion and farm animals. In this review, current knowledge regarding these receptors in species of veterinary relevance is summarised.",

The adaptive component is organised around two classes of specialised lymphocytes, T cells and B cells, each of which display an unique receptor with a specific antigen, leading to a large and diverse repertoire of antigen receptors within the T/B cell population. This diversity is necessary to ensure that each individual cell can encounter its specific antigen, thus inducing activation, maturation and proliferation of the cell. This process, called clonal expansion, forms the basis of the function of the adaptive immune system. Whereas clonal expansion is crucial in dealing with an invading pathogen, the process itself is relatively slow, taking days before enough effector cells and their products can be produced. This delay provides the majority of invading pathogens with time to attach, invade and successfully replicate within the host.",

In the adaptive immune system, T cell and B cell receptors are generated during their development by somatic recombination. This equips each cell with a structurally unique receptor, leading to an extremely diverse and randomly generated receptor repertoire. Cells expressing a fitting, antigen-specific receptor are subsequently multiplied by clonal expansion. The downside of this system, however, is that receptors have to be developed within an individual and, no matter how useful they are, they have to be developed over and over again in subsequent cell generations, as these receptors are not encoded in the germ line.",

Activation of the adaptive immune response can be harmful to the host when the antigens are self or environmental antigens, since immune responses to such antigens can lead to autoimmune diseases and allergies. How does the immune system determine the origin of the antigen and subsequently decide whether to induce an immune response?

Innate immune recognition, as stated above, is mediated by germ line-encoded receptors, which means that the specificity of each receptor is genetically predetermined. One advantage of this is that innate immune receptors evolved by natural selection to have defined specificities for infectious microorganisms. The problem, however, is that every organism has a limit to the number of genes it can encode in its genome. The human genome, for example, contains only 75,000-100,000 genes, most of which have nothing to do with immune recognition. In comparison, there are approximately 10 14 and 10 18 different somatically generated immunoglobulin receptors and T cell receptors, respectively. The total number of receptors involved in innate immune recognition is thought to be in the hundreds. Moreover, microorganisms are extremely versatile and can mutate at a much higher rate than any of their hosts.",

These structures are referred to as pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) and the receptors of the innate immune system that have evolved to recognise them are called pattern-recognition receptors (PRRs). The best-known examples of PAMPs are bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS), peptidoglycan (PGN), lipoteichoic acids (LTAs), mannans, bacterial DNA, doublestranded RNA and glucans. Although these structures are chemically quite distinct, all PAMPs have common features. PAMPs are produced only by microbial pathogens and not by their hosts. They are usually invariant structures shared by entire classes of pathogens. For example, all Gram-positive bacteria have LTA and, therefore, the LTA-PRRs of the host can detect the presence of virtually any Gram-positive bacterial infection. The structures recognised by the innate immune system are usually essential for the survival or pathogenicity of microorganisms.",

PRRs are expressed on a variety of antigen presenting cells (APCs), particularly monocytes, macrophages, dendritic cells (DCs) and B cells, with recent data suggesting expression of PRRs on T cells and natural killer (NK) cells (Hornung et al., 2002) . As the expression of PRRs is not clonal, all receptors displayed by a specific cell type recognise the same PAMP. Activation of PRRs by PAMP binding triggers the immediate response of the cell, in contrast to the necessary proliferation/maturation of cells of the adaptive immune response. This accounts for the rapid kinetics of innate immune responses.",

However, similar to the murine and human systems, we may need to revise the above mentioned groups and include the intracellular expressed PRRs belonging to the family of NOD-like receptors and RIG-1-like receptors (Creagh and O'Neill, 2006) . To date, NOD-like receptors have only been shown to detect bacteria, whereas RIG-1-like receptors only recognise viruses. Thus, in addition to the bacterial and viral ligands to surface PRRs, cells seem to have a second, redundant system, acting through similar signalling pathways, and probably acting co-ordinately in circumstances of TLR/CTLR activation.",

The superfamily of C-type lectin-like domains (CTLDs) is a group of currently more than 1000 identified extracellular proteins. C-type lectins were among the first animal lectins discovered, with bovine conglutinin being known since 1906. The terms C-type lectin, carbohydrate recognition domain (CRD) and CTLD are often used interchangeably in the literature. The term Ctype lectin was introduced to distinguish a group of Ca 2+ -dependent (C-type) carbohydrate-binding proteins (lectins) from the Ca 2+ -independent lectins (Drickamer, 1988) . When the structure of C-type lectins was established and their functions defined, it was found that the carbohydrate-binding activity was mediated by a CRD which was present in all Ca 2+ -dependent lectins but not in other types of animal lectins (Drickamer, 1988) . Further information regarding C-type lectin groups in the human and murine system can be found at http://www.imperial.ac.uk/animallectins/default.html and http://plab.ku.dk/tcbh/lectinlinks.htm.",

Type II receptors have a single transmembrane domain with an extracellular carboxyl terminus containing the CRD and a cytoplasmic amino terminus. Typical examples of this group are the asialoglycoprotein receptor of hepatocytes, macrophage galactose/N-acetylgalactosamine-specific lectin and the NK cell low affinity IgE receptor (CD23). These receptors have a consensus amino acid motif in their cytoplasmic domains responsible for associating with clathrincoated vesicles. Some type II receptors (e.g., asialoglycoprotein receptors) are involved in uptake of molecules into cells through the endocytic pathway. Others (e.g., NK receptor NKR-P1) are involved in signal transduction based on cell-cell recognition. Oligomerisation (into dimers, trimers or hexamers, depending on the molecule) allows these receptors to bind to carbohydrate ligands with multivalent degrees of interaction.",

The cDNA sequence of the bovine orthologue, originally termed WC6, shares 86% and 78% nucleic acid identity with human and mouse DEC205, respectively. COS-7 cells transfected with a plasmid containing the bovine DEC205 coding region expressed a molecule that stained with a WC6-specific monoclonal antibody (Gliddon et al., 2004) . Two-colour flow cytometry of bovine mononuclear cells from afferent lymph draining skin and from blood, confirmed the high level of expression of DEC205 (WC6) on large cells in lymph that were uniformly positive for DC-lysosome-associated membrane glycoprotein (DC-LAMP) and major histocompatibility complex class II (MHC II). Within this DEC205 + DC-LAMP + population were subpopulations of cells that expressed the macrophage-MR or CD172a, implying that DCs in afferent lymph all express this CTLR but, within this population, different subsets with potentially different functions may be present (Gliddon et al., 2004) .",

It is a constantly recycling endocytic receptor, containing eight CRDs which mediate recognition of terminal mannose/fucose-linked N-acetyl glucosamine and sulphated-N-acetylgalactosamine via their cysteine-rich domains. Macrophage-MR has been implicated in the recognition of numerous microbial pathogens, including Candida albicans, Pneumocystis carinii, Leishmania spp. and HIV (Gordon, 1998; Linehan et al., 2000) . Functional characterisation of the putative bovine macrophage-MR (GenBank NM_175779) showed that this receptor is involved in mannosyl-rich glycoprotein-induced mitogenesis in bovine airway smooth muscle cells and the Fig. 1 . SMART representation of bovine C-type lectin receptors. Each receptor has several extracellular C-type lectin binding domains, followed by a neck region and the transmembrane region. The function of the neck region is not yet fully understood. uptake of dextran into monocyte-derived DC (Lew et al., 1994; Werling et al., 1999) . More recently, both cytopathic and non-cytopathic types of bovine viral diarrhoea virus (BVDV) were shown to affect the mechanisms of antigen uptake by monocytes. Endocytosis in BVDV-infected monocytes, unlike uninfected cells, was MR-independent and mediated by fluid phase uptake after 1 h of infection, but became MR-and fluid phase uptake-dependent after 24 h of infection, independent of the BVDV biotypes (Boyd et al., 2004) . Thus, by influencing the early antigen uptake function of APCs, BVDV might disrupt the function of monocytes as professional APCs and contribute to specific immunotolerance to BVDV (Boyd et al., 2004) . Interestingly, a variety of recent publications indicate that CTLRs collaborate with TLRs in the recognition and uptake of pathogens, as well as the induction of the innate immune response (Underhill, 2003) . Fig. 1 shows the domain architecture of the currently sequenced bovine CTLRs, clearly indicating the similarity of the molecules. Fig. 2 shows the evolutionary relationships of the three known bovine molecules with their human and murine orthologues, based on currently available GenBank accession numbers of full length molecules (Table 2) . Amino acid sequence alignments were generated with CLUSTALW. Molecular distances and the tree were computed using the Phylodraw programme. This figure also shows the relationships between the different dectin isoforms in the bovine, murine and human systems, indicating that, in most cases, the bovine molecules seem to be more closely related to the human than to the murine counterparts.",

Since the specificity of TLRs (and other innate immune receptors) cannot be changed, these receptors must recognise patterns that are constantly present on infectious non-self microorganisms, not subject to mutation and highly specific (e.g., not normally found in the host where the TLR is expressed).

In both cases, signalling leads to the production of cytokines and modulation of surface co-stimulatory molecules, forming a bridge between innate recognition and the acquired immune system (O'Neill, 2006) . Up to 14 TLRs have been discovered in different species, either enabling the host to recognise bacterial components (TLRs 1, 2, 4, 5, 6 and 11), RNA/DNA components (TLRs 3, 7, 8 and 9) or with no known function (TLRs 10, 12, 13 and 14). Numerous reviews have been published within the last years, covering all aspects of TLR-ligand interaction and several websites offer comprehensive information (e.g., http://www-personal.umich.edu/ ino/List/TOLLRE.htm). Fig. 3 summarises our current knowledge about TLRs and their ligands, including the main signalling pathways, and provides information about the cellular localisation of these receptors. However, it has to be stated that the localisation of these receptors is not fixed, but rather dynamic, and may change with cellular activation. Fig. 4 shows the evolutionary grouping of all confirmed sequences of farm and companion animal TLRs compared to the corresponding human orthologues. The figure illustrates the relationships between receptors from different species, highlighting the potential for differences in pathogen recognition. It also indicates that TLRs of farm animals may have developed from a common ancestor, which is different to the corresponding human TLR.

Based on these data, it is evident that the majority of tissues/cells analysed so far do express TLRs. However, the expression pattern varies between tissues, between cell subsets within cattle and the TLR repertoire varies in different tissues/cells compared to those analysed from other species, such as mice and humans.

Surprisingly, BVDV-infection of macrophages resulted in a modulated NO response when cells were stimulated with TLR2 or TLR4 ligands, suggesting that viral infection may modulate TLR-function without inducing differences in expression of mRNA transcripts (Franchini et al., 2006) . This observation may become even more important when looking at different APC subsets (Werling et al., 2004) or in cells isolated from animals exposed to stress or growth hormones (Eicher et al., 2004) . However, whether differential expression of TLR mRNA is based on the interaction of a ligand with the TLR, or whether these effects are just a ''side-effect'' based on cellular stress in general, requires further study. One approach is to analyse the expression of bovine TLRs in human embryonic kidney (HEK) cells, a cell line devoid of some TLRs, allowing direct analysis of TLR-ligand interaction by gene reporter assays or chemokine production. Recently, this has been used successfully to study activation of NFjB by bovine TLRs (Yang et al., 2006) .",

Analysis of canine TLR cDNA in a variety of tissues by RT-PCR revealed differences in the pattern of expression. Furthermore, the response of canine peripheral blood mononuclear cells to LTA, a TLR2-ligand, induced CXCL-8 secretion by these cells (Bazzocchi et al., 2005) . However, further analysis of the published canine TLR 2 and 4 sequences has suggested that they are not full length as claimed (Catchpole and House, personal communication). Expression of feline TLRs 1-9, as analysed by quantitative PCR, found expression of these TLRs in all cell types analysed (Ignacio et al., 2005) . The level of expression of each TLR varied between tissues and expression was further affected by infection with feline immunodeficiency virus (Ignacio et al., 2005) . Similarly, the U3-long terminal repeat of feline leukaemia virus was recently shown to activate NFjB via a TLR3dependent mechanism (Abujamra et al., 2006) .",

Secondly, the set of PRRs expressed varies among different cells, resulting in a PRR repertoire that is different for each cell type of the immune system. Thirdly, changes in PRR cell-surface distribution adds yet another level of complexity, modulating binding of PAMPs to certain carbohydrate moieties and thus regulating the affinity for different ligands. Finally, these receptors have been shown to interact with each other, thereby giving rise to a network of multimolecular complexes that add an extra level of complexity to pathogen recognition.",

Clearly, knowledge about these PRRs will aid in the understanding of host-pathogen interactions and may lead to the revision of current concepts of pathogenesis. Even more importantly, knowledge about the functions of these receptors, their ligands, and subsequent gene-activation after receptor-ligand interaction may lead to the development of new therapeutic approaches by interfering at three points in the PRR activation cascade. Ligands can be used as adjuvants, providing the first point to regulate PRR activation. Secondly, modulation of PRR activity can be achieved by the addition of soluble forms of PRRs or PRR-blocking molecules. Finally, PRR signalling can be positively regulated by the adapters or negatively regulated by their inhibitors. Recent findings suggest that there are small synthetic molecules that block TLR-adapter interaction (Ii et al., 2006) . More information about TLR agonists in association with adjuvants has recently been published (Del Vecchio et al., 2005; Mbow and Sarisky, 2005) .",
