Indeed, at that point, there was only one curiosity that could be called an infectious disease, namely, anthrax. Robert Koch's teacher, Jacob Henle, had published in 1840 a theoretical treatise, 'On Miasmata and Contagia,' in which he put forth the criteria that one would have to meet to establish that a microorganism caused disease. These criteria now known as Koch's postulates are considered the fundamental steps by which an agent is proven to cause a particular infectious disease (Table 1) .",
