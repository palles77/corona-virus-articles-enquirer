African lion (Panthera leo) populations are infected with lion-specific FIV strains (FIVple), yet there remains uncertainty about the degree to which FIV infection impacts their health. Reported CD4+ T-lymphocyte depletion in FIVple infected lions and anecdotal reports of lion morbidity associated with FIV sero-prevalence emphasize the concern as to whether FIVple is innocuous or pathogenic. Here we monitored clinical, biochemical, histological and serological parameters among FIVple-positive (N=47) as compared to FIVple negative (N=17) lions anesthetized and sampled on multiple occasions between 1999 and 2006 in Botswana. Relative to uninfected lions, FIVple infected lions displayed a significant elevation in the prevalence of AIDS defining conditions: lymphandenopathy, gingivitis, tongue papillomas, dehydration, and poor coat condition, as well as displaying abnormal red blood cell parameters and elevated liver enzymes and serum proteins. Spleen and lymph node laparoscopic biopsies from free-ranging FIVple infected lions (N=8) revealed evidence of lymphoid depletion, the hallmark pathology documented in immunodefieciency virus infections of humans (HIV-1), macaques, and domestic cats.

            "text": "Pathological conditions associated with lentivirus infection in human and animal models include immune depletion, oral lesions caused by opportunistic infections, wasting, renal disease, and frequently a chronic inflammatory response. These conditions have been described as shared disease sequelae in humans infected with HIV, in macaques with SIV or chimeric S/ HIV, and in domestic cats with FIV (Table 1) . AIDS-defining conditions in HIV and SIV include immunodeficiency indicators such as CD4+ depletion (Freeman et al., 2004; Pandrea et al., 2007; Varbanov, Espert, and Biard-Piechaczyk, 2006) , lymphadenopathy (McClure et al., 1989; Quijano, Siminovich, and Drut, 1997; Wang et al., 2003; Yanai et al., 2006) , and progressive changes in histopathology consisting of lymphoid hyperplasia, involution, and atrophy (McClure et al., 1989; Quijano, Siminovich, and Drut, 1997; Wang et al., 2003) . In humans, loss of condition, or cachexia, is also AIDS defining (Eid and Orenstein, 2006; Faintuch, Soeters, and Osmo, 2006; Freeman et al., 2004; Kotler et al., 1984) . Oral lesions such as gingivitis and papillomavirus associated warts (papillomas) are common in HIV infection and can be useful diagnostic indicators of HIV status since they parallel decline in CD4+ counts and rising viral load Greenspan and Greenspan, 2002; Hodgson, Greenspan, and Greenspan, 2006; Pantanowitz, Schlecht, and Dezube, 2006; Reddy, 2007; Woodman, Collins, and Young, 2007; zur Hausen, 2002) . The documentation of gingivitis and papillomas in HIV-positive patients has increased in recent years possibly due to the long-term survival of patients receiving anti-retroviral therapy (Reznik, 2005) . Papillomavirus is also associated with aggressive cervical cancer in HIV coinfected humans (Hawes et al., 2003; Pantanowitz, Schlecht, and Dezube, 2006; Woodman, Collins, and Young, 2007; zur Hausen, 2002) . Although the incidence of papilloma viruses in SIV-infected rhesus macaques (Prospero-Garcia et al., 1996) is unknown, gingivitis has also been observed in this animal model (L. Calynda, personal communication).",

This assumption has been reinforced by laboratory experiments demonstrating that domestic cats infected with FIVple seem to recover completely after transient lymphadenopathy and plasma viremia, despite persistent cell-associated viremia throughout the study period (VandeWoude et al., 2002; VandeWoude et al., 1997) . Similarly, naturally SIV-infected hosts such as sooty mangabeys and African green monkeys are rarely symptomatic, in contrast to AIDS-like pathology in non-native SIV-infected hosts such as Asian macaques, and AIDS in humans (Pandrea et al., 2006; VandeWoude and Apetrei, 2006) .",

Neurological effects and cachexia have also been associated with FIVple infection in a captive lions (Brennan et al., 2006; Bull et al., 2003) . In this study, three free-ranging Botswana lion populations, as well as lions from the Serengeti Tanzania population, were examined for thirteen physiological and pathological correlates to FIVple infection ( Figure 1 ; Table 1 ). We examined clinical, hematological and biochemical profiles of FIVple-infected and FIVple-seronegative freeranging lion populations and performed histopathological analalysis on a suite of tissues from a subset of FIVple-infected lions. Relative increases in the occurrence of specific and nonspecific clinical symptoms including lymphadenopathy, gingivitis, papillomas, dehydration, and loss of coat condition were found in FIVple-infected lions, as were biochemical profiles indicative of hyperglobulinemia, anemia, and hypoalbuminemia. Similarly, histopathological changes in FIV-infected lion lymphoid tissue were consistent with an FIVple associated pathogenesis.",

FIV status was compared between populations. A limited number of lions from Serengeti National Park in Tanzania (SNP; 8 lions, 8 observations, sampled from 1993 were also included. . FIVple prevalence in our sampling was significantly reduced in study samples from the MKP relative to other lion study populations; 17% in MKP/NP compared to 99%, 100% and 100% in the Delta, Chobe, and SNP, respectively (p<0.0001 in all cases). These FIVple sample prevalences reflect those of the larger populations (Brown et al., 1994; Carpenter and O'Brien, 1995; Olmsted et al., 1992; Troyer et al., 2005) . Mean age of FIVple-positive and FIVplenegative lions was 7.3 (range=1.75-14 years) and 6.3 (range=0.8-8 years) respectively (no significant difference between groups, p=0.32) and likewise the proportion of females was similar in the two FIV groups (0.706 for FIVple-positive and 0.846 for FIVple-negative; p=0.50; for age and sex of each lion see supplemental figure 1 ). Immunodeficiency, as indicated by low CD4 counts, has been previously documented in the SNP lions included in this study . To further document specific immune effects, eight FIVple positive lions were collared and sampled sequentially by a full medical exam including laparoscopic surgery to obtain biopsy samples from lymph nodes, spleen, liver, and kidney for histopathological analysis.",

Virtually all FIVple-positive animals had some manifestation of gingivitis. In some younger lions (\u2264 3 years old) the gingivitis presented as a bright red line along the gingival edge (very similar in appearance to the linear gingival erythema seen in HIV-associated gingivitis (Reznik, 2005) . This inflammation was associated with a narrow zone of depigmentation (especially noticeable along the molars; Figure 2 ). All older FIVple-positive lions had well-developed chronic granulomatous gingival lesions with varying degrees of depigmentation that, in some cases, involved the entire alveolar mucosa ( Figure 2 ) although no lions in the study presented with the extreme necrotizing gingival lesions seen in human AIDS patients. In contrast, the mild gingivitis observed in six (out of fifteen) FIVple-negative lions tended to present as minor gingival irritation with limited depigmentation; more severe gingival lesions were not observed in these lions.",

Mild kidney abnormalities were observed, with evidence of multifocal segmental to diffuse membranoproliferative glomerulonephropathy (MPGN) with no evidence of tubular or interstitial lesions in all three lions (suppl. T2). This histopathology was not considered to be of sufficient severity to account for the high incidence of dehydration in FIVple positive lions (see discussion). Seven liver biopsies from Delta lions had portal inflammation, often with mineralization and a high proportion of eosinophils (suppl. T3). Remnants of parasite eggs were seen in two biopsies. Liver enzymes ALT and AST were also significantly elevated in FIVple-infected samples (p=0.005 and p=0.012; Figure 4 ). Among FIVple-positive samples, ALT and AST also varied by habitat, with the lowest values seen in samples from lions residing in arid/savannah environments with intermittent water supplies (MKP/NP and SNP), followed by samples from lions living with a constant riverine water source (Chobe), and the highest levels seen in samples from lions in swampland (the Delta).",

Although study lions were weighed at capture, most were evaluated at only one time point. Some lions were weighed at multiple time points, however age of animals and seasonal differences in prey abundance complicate determination of weight loss. Thus we could not accurately document changes in weight. Similarly, the lack of standard measurements and benchmarks for BMI and low fat free mass and standardized assays for cytokines in lions make measures of these parameters unfeasible in these populations. An index of cachexia that could be measured in study lions was albumin; therefore we used low albumin levels as a proxy for under nutrition. None of the FIVple-negative animals presented with abnormally low albumin levels, while 46.94% of FIVple-positive animals had hypoalbuminemia (defined as >2 SD lower than the mean of the controls; p=0.00129; Table 1; Figure 4 ); 70% of infected animals had levels 1 SD or more below the mean of the controls (<3.3 mg/dL; Figure 4 ; Figure S1 ).

One lion (Ple-1025), with both lymph node and spleen sampled 3 times over a period of 3 years, demonstrated the typical progression pattern from a hypertrophic state to an involuted one with increasing lymphoid depletion, hyalinosis, and development of plasmacytosis over time that is seen in HIV infected humans and FIVfca infected domestic cats (figure 6; table 2 (Matsumura et al., 1993; Quijano, Siminovich, and Drut, 1997) .

All nine individuals presented with evidence of moderate to severe follicular and/or pericortical atrophy either in lymph node, spleen, or both and most showed lymphocyte depletion with or without follicular hyalinosis (Table 2) .

We extend previous reports of FIVple associated CD4 depletion in peripheral blood (Bull et al., 2003; Roelke et al., 2006) by demonstrating lymphoid depletion via biopsies of lyphoid tissues from infected lions. We document evidence that lyphadenopathy, gingivitis, and papillomas are more common in FIVple infected lions. In addition, we show that infected animals are more likely to be in poor condition, both with respect to their general physical health (hydration, coat condition, and albumin levels) as well having depressed hemoglobin and PCV. Finally, we demonstrate that infected lions have alterations in serum chemistry profiles and histopathologies that are consistent with immune deficiencies seen in humans, macaques, and domestic cats infected with HIV, SIV, and FIV, respectively.",

Fiftythree percent of FIVple infected study lions presented with papillomas, while only 14.3% of uninfected lions had papillomas (Table 1) . Gingivitis was documented in 88.4% of FIVple positive lions and only 40% of FIVple negative animals. In addition gingivitis persisted and progressed further in infected lions. Early stages of gingivitis in our study lions mimicked that seen in HIV-associated gingivitis with marked linear gingival erythema (LGE). Later stage gingivitis in lions was not similar to HIV-associated gingivitis as none of our study lions presented with the severe necrotizing gingivitis and peridontitis as seen in HIV infected humans and FIV infected domestic cats (Coogan, Greenspan, and Challacombe, 2005; Kohmoto et al., 1998; Reddy, 2007) .

Lions infected with FIVple undergo CD4 depletion (Bull et al., 2003; Roelke et al., 2006) . Lymphadenopathy was also significantly increased in FIVple infected animals. While it was not always observed in positive lions, not all lions are at the same stage of infection. Most lions in this study were over 6 years old and, given the 100% seroprevelance rate by 2 years of age, were probably infected for at least 4 years when first examined and therefore may not have been in an acute stage of lymphoid hyperplasia. Other signs of a chronic inflammatory response observed in FIVple infected lions include ubiquitous hyperglobulinemia (primarily gammaglobulin), hypoalbunemia, and anemia (low haemoglobin and/or PCV). These biochemical profiles are common in HIV-positive individuals (De Milito et al., 2004; Kim et al., 2006; Lifson et al., 1995; Nagase et al., 2001; Schwartlander et al., 1993) and have been observed in SIV and FIV infection (Ackley et al., 1990; Hillyer et al., 1993; Hofmann-Lehmann et al., 1997; Kohmoto et al., 1998; Sparkes et al., 1993; Wong et al., 1999) . Further, low hemoglobin and albumin levels are significantly associated with progression to AIDS and death in human pre-AIDS patients (Bonarek et al., 2001; Mocroft et al., 1999; Shah et al., 2007) .",

            "text": "FIVple positive lions were often mildly to moderately dehydrated (Table 1) . Major causes of dehydration include lack of water (an unlikely cause in the swampland of the Okavanga Delta) and gastrointestinal disease with vomiting and diarrhea, which have not been generally observed in these study lions by the field biologists. Also, significant renal disease can result in dehydration due to the kidney's inability to retain water and the high net protein loss by diseased glomerulus and tubules. However, very few infected lions (5 of 29 tested) presented with overt proteinurea or loss of functional concentrating ability (only 2 out of 29 tested had low specific gravity of urine). In addition, serum creatinine levels (which are indicative of glomerular dysfunction) were not significantly different between either FIVple positive and negative lions or dehydrated vs. hydrated lions. Further, in the three lions for which we had renal biopsies, renal pathology was mild and restricted to the glomerulus. Taken together, these parameters of renal function do not support renal failure as the cause of widespread (63%) dehydration seen in FIVple positive lions. The remaining typical reason that animals and humans become dehydrated are fever or depression/malaise (with associated inappetence and oligodipsia), both of which may be general signs of ill health and, along with dehydration itself, are well-documented in lentiviral infected humans and domestic cats (Bendinelli et al., 1995; Faintuch, Soeters, and Osmo, 2006; Pedersen et al., 1987; Selwyn and Rivard, 2003) ; dehydration is also documented in SIV-infected rhesus macaques (Board et al., 2003; Hodge, Novembre, and Dewhurst, 1998) .",

            "text": "Wasting, an extreme loss of condition, is common in humans, macaques, and domestic cats infected with pathogenic lentiviruses (Eid and Orenstein, 2006; Faintuch, Soeters, and Osmo, 2006; Freeman et al., 2004; Hutson, Rideout, and Pedersen, 1991; Kohmoto et al., 1998; Kotler et al., 1984; Matsumura et al., 1993; Morley, Thomas, and Wilson, 2006; Podell, Chen, and Shelton, 1998; Yamamoto et al., 1989) . Many FIVple infected lions in this study (40%; Table  1 ) presented symptoms suggesting they were along a continuum between wellness and wasting as indicated by their general physical condition, anemic state and significantly depressed albumin levels. In addition, cachexic animals have been observed in FIV-endemic areas in Tanzania (SNP) and in South Africa (KNP). In both sites, the prevalence of wasting seemed to rise coincidental with the introduction of other immunosuppresive disease outbreaks; specifically tuberculosis (TB) in KNP (Ide, 2002; Renwick, White, and Bengis, 2007) and canine distemper virus (CDV) in SNP (Roelke-Parker et al., 1996) . While TB causes a wasting syndrome on its own, CDV typically is not associated with wasting and it is possible there was a synergistic reaction or a release of FIVple from immune control in dually infected animals. Other indicators of general loss of condition have also been observed, including poor coat condition and hair quality (40% in FIVple infected lions versus 5.6% in negative lions; p=0.00123; Table 1 ) considered an indicator of wellness in veterinary practice. These markers are non-specific and can be influenced by many biological and environmental factors, but taken together show a general trend for FIVple-infected lions to be in poor health more often than FIVple-negative lions.",

While liver pathologies are often observed in HIV infected humans due to viral infections, usually hepatitis C virus (HCV), they are rare in macaques or domestic cats, as these laboratory animals are sequestered from secondary infections in specific pathogen free environments. Elevated liver transaminase (ALT and AST) are indicative of hepatic insult and were observed more frequently in Okavango Delta FIVple positive lions. The liver histopatholgy of a subset of those lions was consistent with parasite infection (see supplemental table 3) , as were the presence of parasite eggs in some samples. In this case we suspect the liver pathologies may have a primarily environmental component and may be due to a fluke or other parasite restricted to the marsh ecosystem (Okavango Delta). This does not rule out the possibility that, due to lymphocyte depletion, infected Botswana lions would be more susceptible to hepatic viruses or parasites such as schistomiasis, both of which are exacerbated by HIV infection in humans.",

We had previously speculated that FIVple is host-adapted (Brown et al., 1994; Carpenter and O'Brien, 1995; Troyer et al., 2004) and has little influence on lion survival, at least not in the Serengeti ecosystem . However, as with HIV infected humans, there occurs variability in FIVple progression rates from acute to chronic to disease states. Many lions may never progress to advanced symptoms, others may do so only after reproductive age or the natural lifespan of a lion in the wild, which is shorter than that of lions in captivity. Regardless of age, lions that are severely ill die or are killed very quickly in the wild; confounding attempts to document extreme pathologies, since bodies are seldom recovered for necropsies. Finally, the extensive genetic diversity observed among FIV strains, would raise the prospect of potential differences in pathogenicity between different FIVple strains, as is documented among both HIV and FIV strains Pecon-Slattery et al., 2008a; Troyer et al., 2004; Troyer et al., 2005) .",

Animals from MKP were captured on two collection trips (Nov. \u203299 and May \u203201). A total of 20 individual lions were darted, examined, and sampled. Four lions were captured on both trips allowing re-sampling. Seven collection trips were made to the Delta resulting in 70 separate examinations and samples from a total of 40 individual lions (1-5 samplings/animal). Four Chobe lions examined and sampled in May \u203201 and archived samples from 8 SNP lions (with one re-sample) collected from 1994-1996 were used as study site controls for the two major sites in this study. The majority of lions in all populations were mature adults between the ages of 6 to 9 years old. Cubs (up to 2 years old) were sampled from MKP and the Delta, and some sub-adults and young adults (2-6 years old) were sampled from each population. In MKP we sampled only 1 older adult (9 to 14 years), however in the Delta, we sampled over many years and 14 lions had reached old adult status by the time the study ended (see supplemental figure 1 for estimated age and age class of lions at each sample date). Samples from all populations were biased towards females to maximize recapture potential (supplemental figure 1) . Within the Delta, 7 FIVple positive animals were also selected for more extensive examination and surgical biopsies of lymphoid and other tissues. One individual, Ple-1025, was biopsied annually for 3 years for a progressive analysis of tissue pathology. Finally, one trophy-killed FIVple-positive male lion, Ple-1756, was necropsied for tissue collection within 3 hours of death.",

Anesthetized lions were placed in dorsal recumbency and the ventral abdomen was scrubbed with betadine and isopropyl alcohol, using standard asceptic, surgical techniques. The surgeon, surgical assistant, and lion were gowned, gloved, and draped respectively using sterile, disposable materials. Abdominal laparascopy and biopsies were performed using standard, acceptable medical procedures, with the following modifications. All equipment and laparoscopic instruments used were made by Stortz (Germany). Compressed medical grade CO 2 was introduced into the abdomen via a 6\u2033 Veress needle to a maximum pressure of 13-15mmHg (controlled by a Stortz Endoflator). Once sufficient abdominal pressure was achieved, the lions was tipped head down at \u223c30\u00b0 to roll the viscera forward and a 11 mm trocar 10.5cm long with a conical tip was used to penetrate the abdominal wall 3 to 5 cm caudal to the umbilicus and a 10mm Hopkins 28cm telescope was introduced. A fiberoptic cable carried light from a 300Watt halogen light source to the telescope. A Storz camera system was attached to the eyepiece of the telescope and the image was visualized on a flat video screen (Samsung\u00ae). Two additional 5mm ports were appropriately placed proximal and lateral to the cameral port to accommodate instruments in order to biopsy the liver, spleen, left kidney, and cecal lymph nodes (also on the right). Blakesley and Manhes Biopsy forceps with 5mm cups were used to collect tissue samples of liver, spleen and cecal lymph nodes (approximately 10 mm 3 each). The preferred technique for the kidney biopsy was to tilt the animal to the right to expose the left kidney. Tru-cut biopsy needles were used to perform endoscopy guided sampling transcutaneously. When possible, multiple samples were taken from each organ and were placed in neutral buffered formalin and maintained at room temperature. Tissues from the necropsy of lion ple-1756 were treated in a similar way.",
