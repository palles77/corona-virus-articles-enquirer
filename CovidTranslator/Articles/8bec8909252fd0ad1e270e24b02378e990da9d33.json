Here, we report that feline aminopeptidase N (APN), a cell-surface metalloprotease on the intestinal, lung and kidney epithelial cells, is a receptor for type II FIPV but not for type I FIPV. A monoclonal antibody (MAb) R-G-4, which blocks infection of Felis catus whole fetus (fcwf-4) cells by type II FIPV, was obtained by immunizing mice with fcwf-4 cells which are highly susceptible to FIPV. This MAb also blocked infection of fcwf-4 cells by type II feline enteric coronavirus (FECV), canine coronavirus (CCV), and transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV). On the other hand, it did not block infection by type I FIPVs. MAb R-G-4 recognized a polypeptide of relative molecular mass 120-130 kDa in feline intestinal brush-border membrane (BBM) proteins. The polypeptide possessed aminopeptidase activity, and the first 15 N-terminal amino acid sequence was identical to that of the feline APN. Feline intestinal BBM proteins and the polypeptide reacted with MAb R-G-4 (feline APN) inhibited the infectivity of type II FIPV, type II FECV, CCV and TGEV to fcwf-4 cells, but did not inhibit the infectivity of type I FIPVs.",

            "text": "Feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV), family Coronaviridae, genus Coronavirus, causes a chronic, progressive, immunologically mediated disease in domestic and exotic cats. The family Coronaviridae is divided into 3 distinct antigenic groups on the basis of sequence analysis of their genome and antigenic relationships. One of these includes human respiratory coronavirus 229E (HCV-229E), transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) of swine, porcine respiratory coronavirus, canine coronavirus (CCV), and feline coronavirus (FCoV) [6, 26] . Feline coronaviruses (FCoVs ) are divided into FIPV types I and II, and feline enteric coronavirus (FECV) types I and II, on the basis of disease type; that is, whether it causes FIP, the ability of the viruses to proliferate in cell cultures, and the antigenic relationship to TGEV and CCV [23] . The type II strains of FIPV and FECV appeared to be more closely related to CCV and TGEV, i.e., immunodominant neutralization epitopes shared by the spike proteins of TGEV, CCV, and the type II FCoV strains seem to be absent in the type I strains [13] . Recently, these findings were confirmed by sequence analysis. The spike genes of type II FCoVs have much closer similarity to those of TGEV and CCV than to the spike genes of type I isolates [19, 20] .",

            "text": "Viral infection requires binding of the viruses to cellular receptors. Free virus receptors administered to organisms antagonize the endogenous virus receptors, and suppress proliferation of the virus. Therefore, virus receptors have drawn attention as potential anti-virus drugs, and have been identified for several viruses [16] . The CD13 antigen, which is an important cell-surface marker of myelocytic leukemia, has been widely used for immunophenotyping of leukemia [10] . The CD13 antigen has been identified by gene cloning as the enzyme aminopeptidase N (APN) [18] . CD13/APN is widely distributed in respiratory and digestive epithelial cells and blood cells [14, 25] . The physiological functions of CD13/APN differ depending on cell type. In the intestinal brush border membrane (BBM), for example, CD13/APN cleaves N-terminal amino acids of small peptides in the final steps of digestion, and helps absorption of peptides from the small intestine [25] . In 1992, 2 study groups simultaneously reported that CD13/APN functions as a cellular receptor for TGEV and HCV-229E [8, 31] . In 1993, it was reported that CD13/APN also functions as a receptor of cytomegalovirus [28] . Although TGEV and HCV-229E both use CD13/APN as a receptor, the former cannot use the human APN as a receptor, and the latter cannot use the porcine APN, showing species-specific receptor recognition [7, 17] . It has also been shown that FIPV and CCV, which are antigenically close to TGEV, cannot use the porcine APN as a receptor [9] . Recently, it was reported that mouse and hamster cells, which are intrinsically nonsusceptible to FIPV, are infected with FIPV if transfected with feline APN genes, showing that FIPV also uses CD13/APN as a receptor [29] . However, it has been shown that type II FIPV strain 79-1 146 can use the canine APN as a receptor, while type I FIPV strain TN 406 cannot, suggesting that FIPV receptors are heterogeneous consisting of types [2] .",

These results showed that type II FIPV uses the feline APN as a receptor, but it is not a receptor for type I FIPVs. In the experiment by Tresnan et al., the infection rate of type I FIPV to feline APN-transfected hamster cells was much lower than that of type II FIPV (2% and 30%, respectively) [29] . Benbacer et al. showed that type II FIPV can use the canine APN as a receptor but type I FIPV cannot, supporting our results [2] . The amino acid sequences of S proteins of type I and type II FIPVs showed obly about 46% homology [20] , which may have been responsible for the differences in the receptor between these FIPVs. The homology in the N-terminal 700 amino acids of S proteins is very low, and there are few domains where the sequence of 5-6 consecutive amono acids is maintained. Neither type I nor type II FIPVs infected porcine ST or CPK cells. However, Woods et al. showed that type I FIPV strain UCD-1 infected newborn pigs [30] . This result suggested that strain UCD-1 may use receptor proteins other than the APN because FIPV cannot use the porcine APN as receptors. It has not been verified whether type II FIPV infects newborn pigs, or whether proteins other the APN can be used as receptors. However, the study by Woods et al.

In the phylogenetic tree of the S protein-deduced amino acid sequences, however, type I FIPV strains form a group, which is very distant from the type II FIPV, type II FECV, CCV, and TGEV groups [20] . In the present study, we demonstrated that type II FIPV, type II FECV, CCV, and TGEV form a group because these viruses use CD13/APN as a receptor, while type I FIPV alone uses a different receptor, indicating that it is distant from those groups. Although the receptor binding site of FIPV is unknown, there are important antigenic domains in S proteins such as the neutralization and enhancement sites [4, 5, 11-13, 21, 22] . Generally, the distribution of cells expressing virus receptors is an important factor determining in viro proliferation of viruses (pathogenicity). Although type I and type II FIPVs use different receptors, these FIPVs cause the same diseases because FIP is likely immune-mediated and not directly related to virus replication. It is hoped that the receptor (CD13/APN) binding site of type II FIPV and the cellular receptor of type I FIPV will be identified in the near future.",

Polypeptides recognized by the MAb R-G-4 were purified from feline intestinal brush-border membrane proteins by affinity chromatography using MAb R-G-4 as the ligand. 1 Marker proteins; 2 feline intestinal brush-border membrane proteins; 3 polypeptide recognized by MAb R-G-4 was detected. This enzyme activity was completely blocked by addition of the inhibitor, 1, 10-phenanthroline or Bestatine (Fig. 4). The aminopeptidase activity was not detected in the eluted fraction (data not shown). The first 15 amino acids of the polypeptide were determined by N-terminal sequencing: NH2-Ala-Lys-Gly-Phe-Tyr-Ile-Ser-Lys-Pro-Val-Ala-Ile-Leu-Ala-Ile-COOH. This sequence agreed with the N-terminal sequence of feline aminopeptidase N at 93.3%. The virus-binding capacities of feline and porcine intestinal BBM proteins or the polypeptide recognized by the MAb R-G-4 were examined by neutralization of the virus infectivity. Ten fold-diluted samples were reacted with 200 p.f.u.
