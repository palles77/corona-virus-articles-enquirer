Many coronaviruses have been readily adapted to growth in cell lines derived from their hosts or other species. The cytopathic effect (cpe) produced by coronaviruses in infected cells is variable [1] . However, the most common feature of the cpe is its focal nature which progresses to involve the entire cell sheet. On the other hand, the cpe formed by some coronaviruses is of a more nonspecific degenerative quality. Most coronaviruses produce a cpe with a tendency to form syncytia, although this cannot at present be considered to be a general feature of the Coronaviridae.",

The other cpe consisted of a diffuse rounding-up of cells together with the formation of syncytia (Fig. lb) . The multinucleate cells first appeared as clear refractile cells which developed a granular appearance. In later stages giant cells with nuclei around the periphery, and large vacuolated cells, sometimes with no nuclei, were observed. Both types of cpe were observed by 4 days after infection, and the cpe gradually progressed to the whole monolayer. An uninfected cell monolayer is shown in Fig. 1 c.

The proportion of syncytia in these low passage MRC16s varied with a number of factors including the passage number, the medium used, the multiplicity of infection (m.o.i.) and the HCV isolate used. Table 1 shows the results of a typical experiment. Different HCV isolates produced different proportions of cpe, with up to 60% of the cpe in the form of syncytia for 229E, but less than 20% for TO.

All these reports, with one exception [13] , describe the cpe for HCVs as a diffuse rounding-up of cells around the edges of the monolayers, although in some cases it is more focal.

Virus-induced cell fusion of human macrophages by HCV 229E has also been observed [15] , although the proportion of multi-nucleate cells in the infected macrophage population was small compared with that found in studies with the coronavirus, mouse hepatitis virus strain 3 [ 16, 17] .",
