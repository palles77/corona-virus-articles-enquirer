            "text": "For several CoVs, including murine hepatitis virus (MHV) and SARS CoV, cell surface expression of spike protein mediates interactions with receptors on adjacent cells, resulting in cell fusion and syncytium formation. Syncytium formation is a welldescribed cytopathic effect for many viruses in cell culture or in animal model systems and has been suggested to increase viral cell-to-cell spreading (9) . However, for CoVs, syncytium formation has not been tested for a role in replication or cell-to-cell spreading. In this study, we demonstrate that CoVs induce plasma membrane changes consistent with macropinocytosis. Macropinocytosis is a type of endocytosis that is morphologically defined by the presence of membranous extensions of outwardly polymerizing actin termed membrane ruffles. Membrane ruffles nonspecifically surround and internalize fluid cargo into large vesicles or macropinosomes (10) (11) (12) . Membrane ruffling is involved in cell migration, cell-cell interactions, environmental sampling, recycling of surface proteins and membranes, and delivery of bulk material to endosomes and lysosomes (13) (14) (15) (16) . Macropinocytosis can be transient, such as during the clearance of apoptotic bodies, or constitutive, like that associated with immune cells monitoring the environment for pathogens (17) or in cells transformed by the SRC oncogene (18) . Macropinocytosis may be initiated by activation of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and involves signaling though GTPases and kinases, including Rac1, Cdc42, and Pak1. Further, macropinocytosis requires sodium-hydrogen exchangers (NHE) and thus is specifically inhibited by 5-(N-ethyl-N-isopropyl)-amiloride (EIPA) (19, 20) . Macropinocytosis has been identified as an entry mechanism for several pathogens, including Salmonella enterica, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, coxsackie B virus, influenza virus, Ebola virus, vaccinia virus, Nipah virus, and HIV (19, 21) . In each of these studies, membrane ruffling or blebbing is induced by addition of the pathogen to a cell culture, and membrane modifications cease after pathogen internalization. To date, no role for macropinocytosis other than entry has been described as a host-pathogen interaction of viruses or bacteria.",

We demonstrate that MHVinduced macropinocytosis is continuous once initiated \u05464 h postinfection (hpi), significantly after viral entry is completed. Replicating virus is required for induction of macropinocytosis, and inhibition of macropinocytosis impairs viral titers and cellcell fusion.

We therefore examined the etiology and role of plasma membrane ruffling during CoV infection. Murine delayed brain tumor (DBT) astrocytoma cells were infected with MHV strain A59 (MHV A59) expressing green fluorescent protein (GFP) as a fusion with the replicase protein nsp3 (22) , and cells were imaged continuously from 4 to 12 hpi, until the monolayer was entirely involved in syncytia or was lost ( Fig. 1A ; see Movie S1A to C in the supplemental material). Cell infection was confirmed both by the presence of GFP-nsp3 at replication complexes and by syncytium formation, a characteristic cytopathic effect of MHV infection. Membrane ruffling on multiple edges of the cell was noted to begin after 5 hpi, similar to the time of appearance of GFP-nsp3 fusion proteins at replication complexes, and was continuous throughout infection. The plasma membrane changes were extensive and included lamellipodia, filopodia, peripheral dorsal ruffles, and circular dorsal ruffles ( Fig. 1A ; see Movie S1A to C ). The membrane ruffling associated with infection frequently resulted in the internalization of large vesicles. We measured the diameters of 386 vesicles in five liveimaging movies of MHV-infected cell monolayers. Vesicle diameters ranged from 0.49 to 4.14 m with a mean diameter of 1.45 m (Fig. 1B) . This large vesicle diameter was similar to that reported for macropinosomes in multiple systems and much larger and more variable in size than that of endosomes generated by other forms of endocytosis (23) . In addition to ruffling and vesicle formation, MHV-infected cells reproducibly manifested long filopodia that extended from infected cells and contacted distant cells, resulting in fusion at the point of contact and subsequent recruitment of cells into syncytia (see Movie S2A to C in the supplemental material).",

            "text": "Infection with MHV or SARS CoV induces bulk fluid uptake consistent with macropinocytosis. A hallmark of macropinocytosis is bulk fluid uptake from the surrounding environment. To test whether CoV-infected cells were inducing bulk fluid uptake, we used Nile Red neutral polystyrene nanoparticles with a diameter of 800 nm as markers, since their size is excluded from all endocytic pathways except macropinocytosis. MHV-infected DBT cells ( Fig. 2A and B) and SARS CoV-infected DBT-hACE2 cells (Fig. 2B) were incubated with nanoparticles during the last 3 h of infection. Cell monolayers infected with either MHV or SARS CoV demonstrated a significantly higher percentage of cells with internalized nanoparticles than mock-infected cells (Fig. 2B ). Macropinocytosis has been described as a means of pathogen entry in several different systems. However, since our data suggested that MHV-induced ruffling was occurring much later during infection, we next sought to determine the timing of bulk fluid uptake during MHV infection. Cells were mock infected or infected with MHV and then incubated with nanoparticles for 2-h intervals beginning at infection and fixed immediately afterward (Fig. 2C ). Significantly increased nanoparticle uptake was first detected between 4 and 6 hpi and was also prominent at 6 to 8 hpi, indicating that increased fluid-phase uptake initiates at 4 h or later postentry and continues through the remainder of infection. This result was consistent with our visual and quantitative measurements of ruffling and vesicle formation. Because nanoparticle uptake occurred late during infection, we next tested whether replicating MHV is required to induce bulk fluid uptake. Cells were mock infected, infected with MHV, or incubated with an equal concentration of UV-inactivated or heat-inactivated MHV and incubated with nanoparticles for 2-h intervals, beginning at infection (Fig. 2C ). UV-inactivated MHV did not result in increased nanoparticle uptake, suggesting that surface receptor interactions were insufficient to induce macropinocytosis. Heat-inactivated MHV also did not cause nanoparticle internalization, suggesting that the membrane-ruffling phenotype observed was not a cellular response to foreign particles. In addition, in order to confirm that macropinocytosis is not utilized for entry of CoVs, we labeled virions with 1,1=-dioctadecyl-3,3,3=,3=-tetramethylindocarbocyanine perchlorate (DiI) and added them to DBT cells grown on a glass bottom dish at a high multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 25 PFU/cell (Fig. 2D ). Virions were adsorbed for 30 min at 4\u00b0C to synchronize the infection before they were transferred to the 37\u00b0C chamber incubator surrounding the microscope. Cells were then live imaged for 1 h. While we did visualize viruses entering cells at the plasma membrane, we did not observe any evidence of cellular membrane ruffling at the site of entry or else- where on the cell. Thus, virus infection is required for induction of bulk fluid uptake, and MHV-induced macropinocytosis is not associated with virus entry.",

To distinguish between these possibilities, we used two approaches: induction of syncytia by different methods and blockade of syncytium formation with antireceptor antibodies. To test the cell fusion hypothesis, cells were chemically treated with polyethylene glycol 1500 (PEG-1500) or transfected with the vesicular stomatitis virus G protein (VSV-G) (Fig. 6A) to induce cell-cell fusion and then incubated with nanoparticles. Both PEG-1500 treatment and VSV-G expression resulted in small syncytia with fewer than 10 nuclei. The nanoparticle uptake levels of syncytia with similar numbers of nuclei from MHV-infected cells, PEG-1500-treated cells, and VSV-G-transfected cells were compared. PEG-1500 treatment resulted in nanoparticle uptake greater than that of mock-infected cells but significantly less than that seen during MHV infection. Expression of VSV-G did not result in greater nanoparticle uptake than in mock-infected cells. We next blocked the interactions of MHV A59 spike protein with its cellular receptor, carcinoembryonic antigen (CEACAM), by adding anti-CEACAM blocking antibodies at 2 hpi and measured the effect on syncytium size and nanoparticle uptake (Fig. 6B) . The anti-CEACAM antibodies resulted in a significant reduction in syncytial cell number and size but did not significantly decrease nanoparticle uptake by infected cells (Fig. 6C) . Together, these results demonstrate that cleaved spike protein at the cell surface, and not cell fusion alone, is required to initiate and sustain macropinocytosis.",

We then evaluated the effect of EIPA on syncytium size and discovered that treatment with EIPA decreased both the percentage of infected cells involved in syncytia (Fig. 7D ) and the size of the syncytia (Fig. 7E) .

Here, we report that CoVs also have the capacity to modify the plasma membrane through activation of the macropinocytosis pathway. Prior to this study, the only role demonstrated for virus-induced macropinocytosis was in virus entry. MHV-associated macropinocytosis, in contrast, is initiated relatively late during infection and is continuous once activated. MHV 2S does not stimulate cell-cell fusion or macropinocytosis in infected cells but still causes disease in vivo, suggesting that macropinocytosis may not be required for the fitness or pathogenesis of all strains of MHV or for all CoVs. The disease phenotypes of MHV A59 and 2S differ, as infection with MHV A59, but not MHV 2S, causes spinal cord demyelina-tion (35) , suggesting that macropinocytosis-driven cell-to-cell spreading could be a tissue-specific strategy. The conservation of macropinocytosis during MHV and SARS CoV infections, however, suggests that macropinocytosis induction could be an important determinant of pathogenesis for viruses capable of maintaining cleaved spike protein on the surface of infected cells.",

            "text": "Our results demonstrate two consistent and dramatic phenotypes associated with MHV-induced macropinocytosis: ruffling with vesicle internalization and filopodia associated with cell fusion and recruitment into syncytia. The fact that inhibition of MHV-induced macropinocytosis impairs the overall virus titer while not affecting entry or intracellular infectious virus suggests the possibility of multiple functions that favor overall virus fitness, specifically, recruitment of membranes and nutrients into infected cells and syncytia, enhancement of virus release, or virus cell-to-cell spreading. MHV A59 acquires its viral envelope by budding through the ERGIC and is released from the cell without lysis via the exocytic pathway. No previous role for a traditionally endocytic pathway such as macropinocytosis has been reported to be used during viral release (36, 37) . The observed increase in the formation of long filopodia from infected cells that contact and recruit uninfected cells into syncytia suggests a role for macropinocytosis as a mechanism by which CoVs potentiate cell communication over significant distances. Filopodia could act as mediators of CoV cell-cell fusion by concentrating spike protein and virus at the filopodium tip. Actin modifications have been previously implicated in the cell-to-cell spreading of other viruses. Vaccinia virus utilizes actin tails to infect distant cells at a rate faster than that at which it infects adjacent cells (38, 39) . HIV and human T-cell lymphotropic virus use filopodia to create virological synapses to transfer infectious material from one cell to another (40, 41) . Macropinocytosis can occur in polarized cells (42) and could represent a novel mechanism of virus cell-to-cell spreading over tight junctions within airway epithelium. Viral spreading in this manner has several advantages over viral spreading via exocytosis, specifically, immune evasion, concentration of reagents, speed, and the capacity to circumvent physical barriers. Increasing the size and duration of plasma membrane extensions could increase opportunities for interactions with adjacent or distant cells.",
