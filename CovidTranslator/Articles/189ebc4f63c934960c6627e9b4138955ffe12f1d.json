The exponential growth in the number of cases has overburdened clinical care facilities and threatens to overwhelm the medical workforce. These numbers underestimate the true number of infections due to the relative paucity of diagnostic testing to date (2) and the presence of asymptomatic or mild cases (3, 4) . As a result, California, along with many other states and countries, has issued a \"shelter-in-place\" policy for all residents, effective March 20, 2020. These unprecedented measures have disrupted daily life significantly for ~40 million inhabitants for an indefinite period, with the potential for profound economic losses (5) .",

Notably, the 9 available sequenced genomes from crew members and passengers aboard the cruise ship (UC1, UC5 to UC11, and UC19) all clustered within the WA1 lineage. The first reported case from the United States within this lineage (WA1) was reported January 19th (18) [Bedford, et al. 2020 ] and therefore substantially predates the excursions of the Grand Princess cruise ship . The SARS-CoV-2 sequences from cruise ship passengers and crew all shared two single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNVs), C17747T and A17858G, as well as the triad of SNVs common to all WA1 lineages (C8782T, C18060T, and T28144C) (Figures 2 and  3 ). In addition, all of the passengers on the second cruise to Hawaii (UC 5-11) and UC1, who was on the first cruise to Mexico, carried at least 2 additional mutations not observed in UC19, who also was on the first cruise. This indicates that the virus from UC19 is most likely basal to the clade containing the cruise ship strains, and that COVID-19 infections associated with the first cruise were passed onto passengers and crew on the second cruise. The chronology and phylogeny of the cruise ship outbreak, along with the predominance of the WA1 lineage in Washington State but not outside of the US, also suggest that the virus on the Grand Princess likely came from Washington State, although it is still possible that the cases originated from a different region in which the WA1 strain is circulating. In addition to the passengers and crew members on the Grand Princess, virus genomes sampled from five cases of community transmission in different counties of the Bay area (UC19, UC20, UC22, UC23 and UC28) were also phylogenetically placed in the WA1 lineage, suggesting possible community circulation of that lineage in California as well as on the Grand Princess ship.",

The sequence from individual UC29 (MT027062 is from the same patient) was a returning traveler from China and has an identical COVID-19 sequence to a household contact (MT027063). Their viral genomes were more closely related to ancestral lineages from China. Interestingly, three further genomes (UC24, UC26 and UC27) also grouped within a viral lineage with widespread circulation in Europe.

Out of five sequenced cases from this outbreak cluster (UC13 to UC17), three formed a distinct cluster by phylogenetic analysis (UC14 was an employee at the facility, while UC16 and UC17 were family members living in the same residence), indicating likely household transmission (Figures 2B and 3) . Notably, the genome from a Solano county resident (UC21) was also grouped into this cluster, suggesting possible circulation of a virus lineage between different counties. An active investigation regarding a putative epidemiologic link involving UC21 and individuals in the Santa Clara County cluster had been initiated prior to the genomic analyses and is ongoing at the time of publication. Two other workers (UC13 and UC15) also operated at the same building and had no direct contact with UC14; all three had different employers and no known social contact with each other. Consistent with this epidemiological data, the genomes (UC13-15) from the three workers in the large facility are distinct from each other (i.e. no identifiable shared SNV). Several possible scenarios could give rise to this observation, including the prospect that more than one virus lineage was introduced into the building via different events or the workers were infected as a result of community transmission.",

This epidemiological profile is distinct to that in Washington State, in which the vast majority of virus genomes sequenced to date belong to a single phylogenetic lineage, WA1 [Bedford, et al. 2020 ]. The WA1 lineage strains share common ancestry with an early imported lineage that seem to have established transmission in Washington State from January 2020. By contrast, in California, we conclude that multiple recent and unrelated introductions of COVID-19 into the state via different routes have occurred, giving rise to the diversity of virus lineages reported in this study, rather than cryptic transmission of a single pre-existing lineage among counties in California. We note that this does not exclude the possibility of cryptic transmission of multiple lineages in California, as the current level of sampling is not dense enough to estimate confidently the dates of the seeding events, nor the subsequent periods of cryptic transmission before a lineage was identified.",

Notably, the WA1 lineage has been recently identified in COVID-19 cases in Illinois, Minnesota, Connecticut, and Utah. The early date and basal phylogenetic position of the WA1 lineage makes it likely that the direction of dissemination was from Washington State to other states; however that conclusion could change if further genomic sampling in the US revealed substantial levels of virus genetic diversity. SARS-CoV-2 mutates more slowly than many other human RNA viruses, on the order of 1 to 2 SNV mutations a month across its ~29 kB genome (20) , as it contains a nonstructural gene with proofreading activity (21). Despite this, the WA1 lineage of SARS-CoV-2 is readily identifiable with 3 key SNVs, C8782T, C18060T, and T28144C (Figure 3 ) which, at this stage in the epidemic, are distinct from other SARS-CoV-2 lineages.",

First, this initial analysis represents relatively sparse sampling of cases. Undersampling of virus genomes is due in part to the high proportion of cases (80%) with asymptomatic or mild disease (3, 4, 20) and limited diagnostic testing for COVID-19 infection to date in California and throughout the United States. Second, the majority of samples analyzed were obtained from public health laboratories and thus may not be representative of the general population. Finally, phylogenetic clustering of viruses from different locations, such as Washington State and California in the same clade, does not prove directionality of spread. Despite this, our study shows that more robust insights into COVID-19 transmission are achievable if virus genomic diversity is combined and jointly interpreted with detailed epidemiological case data.",

Social distancing interventions, such as the \"shelter-in-place\" directive that was issued by the governor of California on March 20, 2020, may assist in stemming community spread of imported cases.

Single nucleotide variants (SNVs) with respect to the reference strain (NC_045512) are shown in vertical red lines. Cases that are grouped into the WA1 cluster (defined as containing the C8782T, C18060T, T28144C SNVs) include the first identified case of COVID-19 infection (WA1) in the United States on January 15 th , 2020, 9 passengers and crew members aboard the Grand Princess cruise ship, and 4 Northern California counties. Two additional SNVs, C17747T and A17858G, are common to SARS-CoV-2 viruses associated with the Grand Princess cruise ship. Single SNV variants C9924T and G29711T define groups of infected individuals in the Solano County (UC2, UC3, and UC4) and Santa Clara County (UC14, UC16, and UC17) clusters, respectively. 13 er th 4, .
