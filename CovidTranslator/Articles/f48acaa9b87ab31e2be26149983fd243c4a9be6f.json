Hypericin (HY) is an excellent compound that has been investigated in antiviral, antineoplastic, and antidepressant. To investigate the inhibition effect of HY on IBV infection in chicken embryo kidney (CEK) cells, 3 different experimental designs: pre-treatment of cells prior to IBV infection, direct treatment of IBV-infected cells, and pre-treatment of IBV prior to cell infection were used. Quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR), immunofluorescence assay (IFA), flow cytometry, and fluorescence microscopy were performed and virus titer was determined by TCID 50 . The re-sults revealed that HY had a good anti-IBV effect when HY directly treated the IBV-infected cells, and virus infectivity decreased in a dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, HY inhibited IBV-induced apoptosis in CEK cells, and significantly reduced the mRNA expression levels of Fas, FasL, JNK, Bax, Caspase 3, and Caspase 8, and significantly increased Bcl-2 mRNA expression level in CEK cells. In addition, HY treatment could decrease IBV-induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation in CEK cells. These results suggested that HY showed potential antiviral activities against IBV infection involving the inhibition of apoptosis and ROS generation in CEK cells.",

IBV infects chickens via the respiratory tract, from which it can spread to other epithelial tissues. Therefore, IBV not only injures the respiratory tract, but also causes damage to the digestive system and urogenital system, such as the proventriculus, kidney, ovary, and oviduct, resulting in respiratory disease, interstitial nephritis, and dysplasia of the oviduct (Zhong et al., 2016) . IBV has led to severe economic losses in the poultry industry worldwide. It has been demonstrated that IBV not only causes direct loss due to high mortality, secondary bac-terial infection, poor meat production, and egg quality, but also indirect losses arises from increasing drug costs and vaccination in IBV prevention (Liang et al., 2019) .",

            "text": "The Chinese government has prohibited the use of antiviral drugs in food animals. Thus, utilization of traditional herbs remains a major focus in antiviral research. Several reports have confirmed that traditional Chinese herbs could effectively inhibit the replication of various viruses (Chen et al., 2018; Dziewulska et al., 2018; Lv et al., 2019; Xie et al., 2017) . Hypericin (HY), a natural 6367 polycyclic quinone, is mainly extracted from St John's Wort (Hypericum perforatum L.) (Barnes et al., 2019) . Hypericin has traditionally been used in a wide range of medical applications such as anti-virus (Birt et al., 2009; Marrelli et al., 2014; Naesens et al., 2006; Wolfle et al., 2014) , anti-tumor (Mirmalek et al., 2015) , and anti-depressant (Zhai et al., 2015) . Hypericin has virucidal activity against both DNA and RNA viruses with lipid envelope (Tang et al., 1990) , suggesting that HY has the potential to be developed and used as antiviral drugs. In particular, HY has been found to have significant inhibitory effect on HIV infection (Taher et al., 2002) . Recent studies on the use of HY for inhibiting hepatitis C virus (HCV) have attracted more attention (Jacobson et al., 2001; Shih et al., 2018) . Hepatitis C virus infection could induce oxidative stress and endoplasmic reticulum stress, which enhanced the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and promoted caspase 3 activity, and finally led to hepatocyte injury in vivo and in vitro (R\u00edos-Ocampo et al., 2019) .",

The aim of this study is to elucidate the antiviral activity and related mechanism of HY inhibiting IBV replication in chicken embryo kidney (CEK) cells, and provide alternative approach to prevent and treat IBV infection. The impact of HY on relative mRNA expression levels of IBV, apoptosis-related genes (including Fas, FasL, JNK, Bax, Bcl-2, Caspase 3, and Caspase 8), and ROS production in IBV-infected CEK cells were studied. Our results clearly demonstrated HY had potential antiviral activities against IBV infection involving the inhibition of apoptosis and ROS generation in CEK cells.",

Our results showed that direct treatment of HY on virus-infected cells was the best among 3 different experimental designs ( Figure 2 ). In the direct treatment of HY on virusinfected cells, it may be due to the effect of HY on infected cells, effectively inhibited the activity of viral transcriptase, and effectively reduced the replication of IBV in CEK cells. The pre-treatment of HY on IBV prior to infection may be related to the photoperiod and oxygen supply of HY. Under light conditions, HY could absorb photons, and then stimulate singlet oxygen to play an antiviral role. Because this experiment was carried out under the condition of no oxygen and weak light, the direct attack effect of HY on virus particles was not brought into full play, and the killing effect of virus was weakened (Miskovsky, 2002; Xu et al., 2019) . In the pre-treatment of HY on cells prior to infection, HY blockaded on the adsorption of virus in CEK cells was weak, or did not protect the cells, thus failed to effectively prevent IBV from entering the host cells (Pu et al., 2009 (Pu et al., , 2012 . Therefore, in the following experiments, the CEK cells were first infected IBV, and then incubated HY solution. To further confirm the inhibitory effect of direct treatment of HY on virusinfected cells, the viral fluorescent signal was detected by IFA (Figure 3 ). Our results confirmed the inhibition effect of direct treatment of HY on virus-infected cells.",

            "text": "While apoptosis usually functions as a host defense mechanism that ensures killing of infected cells (Elmore, 2007) , several viruses, including IBV, have been shown to induce apoptosis to enable efficient virus transmission, while avoiding overt inflammatory responses and activation of the immune system . Our results showed that IBV could induce apoptosis in CEK cells (Figure 4) , and increase mRNA expression levels of Fas, FasL, JNK, Bax, Caspase 3, and Caspase 8, with the exception of Bcl-2, which significantly decreased after IBV infection ( Figure 5) , which was consistent with other reports (Chhabra et al., 2016; Fung et al., 2014; Liao et al., 2013) . It was found that IBV could increase the mRNA expression levels of Fas, FasL, and Bax, and decrease the mRNA expression level of Bcl-2 in IBV-infected HD11 cells (Han et al., 2017) . Another research demonstrated that JNK served as a pro-apoptotic protein during IBV infection. Interestingly, pro-apoptotic activity of JNK was not mediated via c-Jun, but involved modulation of the anti-apoptotic protein B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl2) (Fung and Liu, 2017) . Moreover, our results showed that HY could inhibit apoptosis induced by IBV on CEK cells (Figure 4) , and reduced mRNA expression levels of Fas, FasL, JNK, Bax, Caspase 3, and Caspase 8, but increased Bcl-2 mRNA expression level after IBV infection ( Figure 5 ). This is similar with human umbilical vein endothelial cells, in which HY could inhibit cell apoptosis by affecting the expression of apoptosisrelated genes and inhibit production of ROS (Do and Kim, 2017) .",
