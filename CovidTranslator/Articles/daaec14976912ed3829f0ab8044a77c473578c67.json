The technique Involves the coating of electron microscope grids with protein A and specific TGE virus antiserum. Optimal conditions for performing this solid phase Immune electron microscopy technique were a concentration 250 JIgmr ! of protein A; 1:100 diluted rabbit ann-roe virus hyperimmune serum for coating the grids and overnight Incubation with virus samples. The possibility of detecting coronavlrus In crude faeces was highly improved with solid phase Immune electron microscopy, compared with conventional negative staining electron microscopy, by specific trapping of virus and prevention of adsorption of contaminants. The sensitivity of the method was evaluated by coded investigation of a dilution series of stock virus mixed with different pools of faeces. The Improvement of virus detection In faeces by solid phase Immune electron microscopy, compared with standard electron microscopy was at least tOO-fold. Faecal shedding of coronavirus by pigs Infected with virulent and attenuated strains of TGE virus was studied. Virus detection In faeces by a standard electron microscopy technique was not practical, since the virus was obscured by a large quantity of debris In the faeces. By using solid phase Immune electron microscopy, however, the aspect of the specimens on the grids Improved so much that, In addition to more common Immunofluorescence, the technique might be useful as a diagnostic test for TGE. Virus was detected In daily faecal samples from one or two days after experimental Infection with virulent TGE virus, until death In five out of eight animals. Unlike Immunofluorescence, solid phase Immune electron microscopy may be used for diagnosis In living animals.",

Immune electron microscopy can greatly increase the sensitivity of diagnostic electron microscopy. Conventional immune electron microscopy is based on the observation in the electron microscope of clumps of virions specifically formed with homologous antibodies (Saif et al 1977) . Derrick (1973) described a new immune electron microscopic technique in which grids were coated with antibodies and used for specific trapping of plant viruses. Shulka and Gough (1979) introduced a modification in which grids were precoated with protein A before coating with specific antiserum. Precoating of the grids with protein A increases the efficiency of trapping by the absorbed antibodies, since the immunoglobulin molecules are attached to the grid by their Fe regions and have their antigen binding sites preferentially exposed. This technique, called solid phase immune electron microscopy (SPIEM), has been applied successfully in the detection of rotavirus in human stools (Nicolaieff et al 1980 , Svensson et al 1983 .",

Virus was detected in supernatant after low speed centrifugation of the faecal suspension, in sediment after high speed centrifugation or in both.

Application of this method, however, is not often reported in the literature. In the present study, coronavirus particles were rarely found by standard EM in faeces of experi-mentally infected pigs. Sensitivity of EM for detection of virus may be increased by immune EM of which there are several modifications. By SPIEM, small numbers of virus particles can be visualised more easily by specific trapping of virus. Moreover, a layer of serum proteins prevents the adsorption of crude materials and provides fairly clean preparations. SPIEM has further advantages which make it practical as a diagnostic test: (a) a reduction of time needed to screen one specimen; (b) a more homogeneous distribution of virus particles on the support film, thereby a higher incidence of positive scores; (c) the ability to distinguish, through the specificity of immunological trapping, infections with TGE virus and porcine epidemic diarrhoea virus, a coronavirus which is antigenically unrelated to TGE virus (Pensaert and De Bouck 1978) .",

The highest number of virions were seen on grids coated with 250 I-Ig ml-I of protein A and I: 100 diluted antiserum; these conditions were chosen for further work. The present study indicates that increasing the concentration of antiserum does not always improve the virus-trapping efficiency of the grids. Optimal concentration of protein A and antiserum may depend on the antibody titre and need to be determined for each new system. Svensson et al (1983) reported that SPIEM was 30 times more sensitive than direct EM for detecting rotavirus in faeces. In the present study, 17 times more coronavirus particles were trapped from a relatively pure cell culture harvest of TGE virus by SPIEM than were trapped by standard EM. Virus suspensions prepared from infected cell cultures show relatively little contamination with cellular debris, and the number of virus particles on grids prepared for standard EM can easily be counted. Standard grids of faecal suspensions are largely obscured by debris preventing a reliable estimation of numbers of virus particles. A major improvement of SPIEM is its high efficiency of virus trapping out of heavily contaminated specimens such as faeces; virus could be detected in at least lOO-fold higher dilutions of stock virus in faeces, compared with standard EM. Generally, specimens that were just positive by standard EM contained more than 50 virus particles per square in a SPIEM assay.",

In such cases, a SPIEM test might be useful in confirming a diagnosis. Moreover, since the present study indicates that the virus can be detected in daily faecal samples of diarrhoeic animals, SPIEM can confirm a diagnosis on living animals.

SPIEM might be an alternative technique for investigating daily virus excretion in faeces. In the present study, immunofluorescence detected virus replication in epithelial cells of the small intestines of two pigs that were necropsied on the eighth day after infection; this finding is in accordance with results of Pensaert et al (1970) who detected fluorescence until seven days after inoculation. Restriction of infection by the attenuated Purdue strain of TGE virus to the caudal portion of the small intestine may explain why this strain does not cause diarrhoea as severe as that observed with the virulent Miller virus (Frederick et al 1976) . The results obtained in this study indicate less faecal shedding of virus over a shorter period by pigs infected with the attenuated Purdue virus; this finding agrees with reports which detected limited replication of the virus in the small intestine.",
