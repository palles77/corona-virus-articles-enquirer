As mentioned, gastrointestinal symptoms such as diarrhea and nausea are less common and symptoms such as fever and cough are more common in viral infections such as seasonal influenza, SARS and MERS.

Many patients with coronavirus may be unrecognized and present in the community because, according to the results of this study, none of the clinical symptoms were definitively present in all patients. Therefore, definitive diagnosis of patients is difficult and one should expect hidden and vector-borne patients in the community.

It has been shown that the mortality of this disease is higher than that typically obtained by dividing the death rate by the total number of patients. Because at the time of infection the number of persons is much lower than the number entered into the denominator (10).
