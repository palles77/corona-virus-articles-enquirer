            "text": "Diarrhea in kittens is one of the most common maladies facing the small animal clinician and managers of feline shelters and catteries. 1 A recent survey of the Association of Shelter Veterinarians identified kitten diarrhea as one of the top two concerns of veterinarians who treat shelter cats, second only to upper respiratory infections. 2 Clinical signs can range in severity from a mild, self-limiting diarrhea to a potentially fatal acute hemorrhagic diarrheal syndrome. Despite the significant clinical importance of diarrhea in kittens, veterinary literature does not provide much specific information on the causes and diagnosis of this malady. Antibiotics often are administered injudiciously to diarrheic kittens, and subsequent resolution of clinical signs often is equated wrongly with eradication of a \"putative\" infectious pathogen. Indiscriminate antibiotic therapy may even alter the commensal intestinal microflora, which leads to an exacerbation of the animal's diarrhea or development of antibiotic resistance. 3 Knowledge of the most common causes of diarrhea in kittens is integral to formulation of appropriate diagnostic and therapeutic plans and guidance for the veterinarian when standard therapeutic recommendations fail. Although diarrhea in kittens can be associated with a number of different etiologies, infectious causes are believed to play an important role in many of these cases.",

It causes early embryonic death, abortion, and pyometra in infected cows. 6 Interestingly, T. foetus is found primarily on the large intestinal mucosal lining in cats. 4 Infected cats generally are young but have ranged in age from 3 months to 13 years of age (median 9 months). The pathogenicity of T. foetus for cats was demonstrated in a recent study in which eight cats were infected experimentally with a T. foetus strain isolated from a diarrheic kitten. 7 Trophozoites were cultured from the feces of all eight cats within 1 week after oral inoculation; infection persisted throughout the entire 203 days of the study, even when stools became normal.",

The procedure should be performed with saline (0.9 per cent) and with use of fresh feces (body temperature, <2 hours old). Trophozoites in older specimens lose their motility and degenerate and become unrecognizable. The survival of trichomonads can be prolonged by adding 3 ml of 0.9 per cent saline to 2 g of feces. A small amount of feces is placed on a warm slide and a drop of 0.9 per cent saline is mixed with the feces. Alternatively, a miniscule amount of fresh feces can be collected by insertion of a cotton-tipped swab into the rectum. The smear must not be too thick, because trophozoites will be missed easily. A simple rule of thumb is that the observer should be able to read the fine newsprint of a newspaper through the smear.",

T. foetus should be distinguished from Giardia spp. Giardia trophozoites have a concave ventral disc, and motility that mimics a falling leaf. In contrast, trichomonads are spindle-shaped, have an undulating membrane that courses the entire length of the body, and move in a more irregular and jerky fashion. In contrast to Giardia spp., trichomonads do not have a cyst stage, which underscores the limitations of fecal flotation technique for diagnosis of trichomoniasis.

This may reflect an alteration of the endogenous intestinal microflora that supports the trichomonads, or effective resolution of cofactors (Giardia spp., Cryptosporidia spp., other coccidia), that could exacerbate the cats' diarrhea. Prolonged use of antimicrobials has not been successful for long-term control of diarrhea and may delay the onset of clinical remission or exacerbate the diarrhea in some animals. In addition, higher doses of certain antibiotics such as metronidazole and paramomycin may cause adverse effects in cats, including neurotoxicity and nephrotoxicity, 10 respectively. A recent report showed that more than 50 per cent of cats diagnosed with T. foetus-associated diarrhea were still shedding the organism up to 5 years after diagnosis based on PCR confirmation, and diarrhea persisted for up to 3 years in many cats, despite aggressive antimicrobial administration. 11 Relapses of diarrhea were common and associated with dietary change, medical treatments unassociated with T. foetus infection, and travel. 11 Currently, it is unknown whether long-term infection of cats with T. foetus is a predisposing factor for development of inflammatory bowel disease. In light of the poor host specificity of T. foetus and the intimate association between infected cats and their human companions, the potential for zoonotic transmission should be considered. A single case of human infection with T. foetus has been documented in the literature to date. In that case, the infection presented as epididymitis and meningoencephalitis after immunosuppression and peripheral blood stem cell transplantation. 12",

Current laboratory protocols for detection of Cryptosporidium oocysts in fecal specimens include microscopic examination of smears stained with Giemsa, the modified Ziehl-Neelsen technique ( Figure  15 -3), the modified Kinyoun acid-fast technique, or use of an immunofluorescent detection procedure ( Figure 15-4) . 20, 21 Immunofluorescent detection procedures are more sensitive and specific than acid-fast stains and generally are the method of choice for morphological diagnosis in human beings. 22 Microscopic techniques work well when clinical signs are present and oocyst numbers are relatively high; however, once clinical signs abate and oocyst numbers are greatly decreased, the sensitivity of tests relying on morphological identification is reduced and diagnosis often requires examination of multiple fecal specimens. In these cases, the newer enzyme immunoassays designed to detect Cryptosporidium spp. antigens in feces have proven more sensitive. 23 Difficulties in detection and enumeration of oocysts in fecal specimens are compounded by variation in consistency between individual fecal specimens, the amount of specimen used, and oocyst losses incurred during recovery processes. Although several diagnostic tests have come into widespread general use, the veterinary literature lacks published data that compare different diagnostic methods in cats. No single procedure has become adopted universally.",

However, microscopic diagnosis of Giardia infection can be difficult, because (1) cysts may be shed intermittently and (2) they are so delicate. Many artifacts (e.g., grass pollen, yeast) mimic the morphology of Giardia cysts to varying degrees, and care must be exercised in differentiating these from Giardia spp. A recent survey evaluated the sensitivity of fecal flotation for detection of Giardia spp. in dogs and confirmed the poor performance of current in-house microscopy testing for Giardia spp. compared with microplate ELISA. In that study, microscopy following fecal flotation identified only half of the infected dogs and falsely diagnosed up to 25 per cent of uninfected animals. 26 Accurate identification of these parasites in diarrheic cats is important because the organism could be a zoonosis 27 and failure to detect these parasites in diarrheic cats often leads to injudicious antibiotic therapy, which can exacerbate the diarrhea. Many veterinarians and reference laboratories have resorted to using ELISA tests that rely upon detection of Giardia cyst wall protein I (GCWP 1). 28 The ELISA tests are advantageous because they are generally easy to perform and results are easy to interpret. In addition, the test does not rely upon morphological identification of cysts or oocysts via microscopy, which saves technician time and potentially avoids false-negative interpretations. The ELISA tests also can detect GCWP 1 in the absence of detectable cysts. 28 However, virtually every commercially available ELISA is marketed for human use, and studies are few that appraise their performance characteristics in diarrheic cats and dogs.",

The performance characteristics of this test have not been well characterized; the test must be scrutinized against the performance characteristics of other ELISAs, fecal flotation, and the immunofluorescence assay. Preliminary studies in our laboratory found a relatively high sensitivity (86 per cent) for the Remel ProSpecT Microplate ELISA in cats naturally infected with Giardia spp., whereas the Remel ProSpecT Rapid ELISA had an unacceptably low sensitivity of 56 per cent. 29 Immunofluorescence detection procedures (see Figure 15 -4) are more sensitive and specific than acid-fast stains and generally are the method of choice for morphological diagnosis of cryptosporidiosis in human beings. 22",

In addition, no correlation exists between increased fecal endospores and the presence of fecal enterotoxin. Finding spiral-shaped bacterial organisms should be interpreted with caution because many Campylobacter spp. are found in cats, and many are nonpathogenic. Perhaps the best use of stained fecal smears is to make a diagnosis of intestinal lymphoma, and intestinal Histoplasma or Prototheca infections, the latter two of which are rare in cats.

Caution should be heeded in interpretation of the results of fecal ELISAs for C. perfringens enterotoxin (CPE) and C. difficile toxin A and/or B in neonatal kittens because of the high incidence of positive ELISAs (up to 50 per cent) I* documented in apparently healthy kittens. The effects of C. difficile toxin A and B have been shown to be dependent on age in human beings and dogs, in whom high levels of toxins are detected in the feces of neonates in the absence of clinical signs of disease. 42, 43 The reader is referred to Chapter 5 for a more detailed description of specific bacterial enteropathogens associated with diarrhea. The indications for performance of fecal enteric panels on diarrheic kittens are poorly defined, which results in indiscriminate testing and misinterpretation of results. Fecal cultures and toxin analysis for specific bacteria should be reserved for (1) kittens that develop diarrhea after kenneling or show attendance once parasitic causes for diarrhea have been ruled out, (2) kittens with an acute onset of bloody diarrhea in association with evidence of sepsis, (3) outbreaks of diarrhea occurring in more than one household pet, and (4) screening for enteropathogens (C. difficile, Campylobacter spp., or Salmonella spp.) when zoonotic concerns are present. A recently published study documented the prevalence of five groups of potentially zoonotic enteric infections (Salmonella spp., Campylobacter spp., Cryptosporidium spp., Giardia spp., and Toxocara cati) in fecal samples from cats under 1 year of age that were either housed in humane shelters or presented to primary-care veterinarians in central New York State 44 (see Chapter 75). Possible associations of these organisms with the cat's source or with the presence of diarrhea were evaluated. The proportion of fecal samples with one or more zoonotic organisms was 35.1 per cent among client-owned cats and 44.2 per cent among shelter cats. The prevalence of Salmonella spp. was 0.8 per cent, which is similar to the reported prevalence of Salmonella spp. in cats in Colorado 27 and in kittens from shelters in Japan (1.1 per cent). 45 I* also have documented a relatively high incidence of Campylobacter spp. in fecal specimens from nondiarrheic cats and kittens (approximately 20 per cent).",

Intravenous (IV) fluid and electrolyte therapy is indicated, with particular attention given to potassium repletion. The intramedullary route can be used in kittens, because the subcutaneous route is likely to be inadequate. Dextrose solution (2.5% to 5%) is added to the IV fluids if the kitten is hypoglycemic. Plasma or colloids (dextran 70 or hetastarch) are indicated if the serum albumin concentration drops below 2.0 g/dl. Antibiotics are administered to febrile or severely neutropenic cats. If the animal is neutropenic but afebrile, prophylactic administration of a first-generation cephalosporin is reasonable. Cats in septic shock should be treated with a broad-spectrum aerobic and anaerobic antibiotic (e.g., ampicillin plus amikacin). Human granulocyte colonystimulating factor (G-CSF) at 5 \u00b5g/kg q24h SC will increase neutrophil numbers but may not influence outcome. Antiemetics such as prochlorperazine, metoclopramide, or ondansetron are indicated if vomiting is intractable. Metoclopramide is most effective when administered as a constant rate infusion at a dose of 1 mg/kg q24h. Gastric protectants including H 2 -receptor antagonists and sucralfate are indicated when there is evidence of secondary esophagitis. Broad-spectrum anthelminthics to treat concurrent intestinal parasites should be administered when the cat is no longer vomiting. Most cats can be weaned gradually onto a digestible commercial enteral diet; however, intractable vomiting may warrant the administration of total or partial parenteral nutrition (see Chapter 16) .",

Finding intestinal parasites in the feces of a kitten with diarrhea does not establish parasitism as the cause of the intestinal disease, although many kittens show a partial or complete resolution of clinical signs after administration of a broad-spectrum anthelminthic. We deworm diarrheic kittens routinely even in the face of a negative fecal flotation or negative Giardia ELISA. Serological screening for feline leukemia virus is recommended for kittens with chronic diarrhea that have not responded to antiparasitic and dietary therapy. Metronidazole administration often is associated with some amelioration of diarrhea, possibly because of altering the intestinal microflora, dampening cell-mediated immunity, or killing a specific pathogen such as Clostridium difficile. Dietary modification should be considered in cats that fail to respond to empirical antiparasitic therapy and metronidazole administration. We frequently use commercial feline intestinal diets and have had success using a diet that is highly digestible and contains relatively large amounts of fermentable fiber. Kittens that fail to improve on a commercial diet can be fed a cooked turkey or chicken diet (without carbohydrates) for 5 to 10 days to provide a highly digestible meal containing moderate amounts of fat. Dietary fat restriction does not appear to be as important in cats with intestinal disease as it is in dogs. Home-cooked diets are not complete and balanced and should not be fed to kittens for more than 10 days.",

We discourage the administration of prednisone to diarrheic kittens unless a comprehensive work-up, including intestinal biopsies, warrants this therapy. Kittens with chronic ileitis could have secondary deficiencies of vitamin B 12 (cobalamin), an important micronutrient for DNA replication in the intestinal crypts (see Chapter 13) . Vitamin B 12 can be administered empirically to kittens at 100 mg per kitten, given subcutaneously once weekly for 4 to 6 weeks. Repeat injections should be based on determination of serum cobalamin concentrations. Cobalamin is safe, easy to administer, and cheap. Use of prebiotics and probiotics for diarrheic animals has received tremendous attention recently; however, most studies completed have not been performed in animals with clinical disease. Furthermore, caution should be heeded when purchasing over-the-counter commercial probiotics because little federal regulation and quality control exist over many products, and label descriptions do not always match the ingredients.",

The diagnostic yield will be increased markedly with the examination of fresh fecal specimens, the use of a centrifugation technique with zinc sulfate solution, and the timely incorporation of immunoassays for diagnosing Giardia and Cryptosporidium spp. Diagnosis of T. foetus is enhanced greatly with the utilization of InPouch culture kits that facilitate the growth and direct visualization of motile trophozoites. The clinical documentation of enteropathogenic bacteria that cause diarrhea in cats is clouded by the presence of many of these organisms existing as normal constituents of the indigenous intestinal flora. Attributing disease to a putative bacterial enteropathogen(s) in kittens should be made only after considering the animals' signalment, predisposing factors, clinical signs, serological assays for toxins, fecal culture, and/or PCR. Relying on results of fecal culture alone is wrong, because C. perfringens, C. difficile, Campylobacter spp., and pathogenic and nonpathogenic E. coli are isolated commonly from apparently healthy cats. Fecal cultures may be useful in procuring isolates for the application of molecular techniques such as PCR for detection of specific toxin genes, or for molecular typing of isolated strains to establish clonality in suspected outbreaks. Accurate diagnosis of infections may require diagnostic laboratories to incorporate PCRbased assays using genus-and species-specific primers to facilitate detection of toxin genes and differentiation of species that appear similar phenotypically and biochemically.",
