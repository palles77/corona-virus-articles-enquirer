The species became extinct 28,000 years ago, coinciding with the arrival of anatomically modern humans (AMHs) in Europe 40,000 years ago. There has been considerable debate surrounding the main causes of the extinction of Neandertals. After at least 200,000 years of successful adaption to the climate, flora and fauna of Eurasia, it is not clear why they suddenly failed to survive. For many years, climate change or competition with anatomically modern human (AMH) have been the leading hypotheses. Recently these hypotheses have somewhat fallen out of favour due to the recognition that Neandertals were a highly developed species with complex social structure, culture and technical skills.",

In contrast, AMHs continued to co-evolve with east African pathogens. More than 200,000 years later, AMHs carried pathogens that would have been alien to pre-historic Europe. First contact between long separated populations can be devastating. Recent European and American history provides evidence for similar events, where introduction of viral, protozoan or bacterial pathogens to immunologically na\u00efve populations lead to mass mortality and local population extinction.

They were better adapted to European conditions during the Ice-Age, having lived there for 200,000 years. Modern humans in contrast, had migrated from subtropical environments in North Eastern Africa, and were better suited for warmer conditions. Neandertals were much more competent in using tools and preparing weapons than previously thought [8] . The more we learn about Neandertals, the harder it is to believe that we simply out-smarted them. The Neandertals were indeed extremely successful hunters and were taking down game ranging from large woolly mammoths, to quick and agile deer. Analysis of mtDNA of populations in Asia supports the view that there was only a single dispersal out of Africa by AMHs, and additionally this population has split early into at least one European and one Asian branch although the evidence is not conclusive for this scenario [9] . It is therefore not very likely, assuming similar reproduction rates that AMHs outnumbered and overwhelmed the Neandertals.",

Open burning releases large amounts of air pollutants, including dioxins, that can induce short term and long term effects on human health, especially in children [14] .

            "text": "The evolutionary origin of several viral pathogens correlates with the genetic and paleontological data of first contact and near first contact of AMHs and Neandertals. We propose that AMHs introduced an infectious agent, deriving from Eastern Africa, into the population of the Neandertals. We would expect Neandertals to be extremely vulnerable to most introduced diseases. First, in Africa, AMHs and their ancestors had gone through intense selection and co-evolution with pathogens in their sub-tropical environment. The survivors who withstood those particular diseases emigrated to Europe. We believe that Neandertals would have encountered fewer human pathogens in their evolutionary history, at least during the past 200,000 years before AMH arrival in Europe. And those infectious diseases that might have been present in Europe at that time, would then have been of a very different nature than those in Africa. Why should have Neandertals experienced fewer plagues and infectious diseases before the arrival of AMHs? The main reason is that most diseases affecting humans are ultimately zoonotic diseases that originated in animals. For a zoonotic pathogen it is normally much easier to breach the species barrier if the species are closely related. Therefore African primates could have served as a reservoir or transmitter of pathogens for developing humans. Examples for this can also be observed in re-cent history (HIV jumped from primates to humans some 70-100 years ago). Even zoonoses from other species would be facilitated in Africa by the greater species diversity of rodents, bats and insects that serve as reservoirs for many viruses and other pathogens (reviewed in Refs. [16] [17] [18] ). This environmental background may have led to a higher genetic resistance against infectious diseases in AMHs compared to Neandertals. The third reason why Neandertals were more vulnerable is they were descended from a very small group and long-term effective population size of Neandertals was smaller than that of modern humans and extant great apes at the time of AMH arrival. Recent studies including mitochondrial DNA analysis propose that it was as low as 10,000 individuals [19] . There is also evidence that the genetic variability of the Neandertals was very low. The mtDNA genetic diversity in Neandertals between 38,000 and 70,000 years ago was estimated to be one-third of that in contemporary modern humans [19] and, more importantly, much lower than that of the AMHs who more recently descended from the largest human gene pool in Africa. Greater diversity of the immune system increases the number of pathogens that can be recognized. Given the overall lack of genetic diversity of Neandertals, they likely lacked immune gene variability as well putting them at a higher risk of developing disease relative to AMHs.",

Table 1 Overview over viral pathogens: likelihood ranking: whether a viral pathogen is a (+): very likely candidate, (o) possible but not very likely candidate, or a (\u00c0) highly unlikely candidate for contributing to Neandertal extinction.

Varizella-Zoster virus (VZV), the most important human pathogenic representative of the Varicelloviruses, is the causative agent of varicella (chickenpox) and herpes zoster (shingles). VZV is able to persistently infect humans over the entire lifespan. Primary infection with Varizella-Zoster virus can lead to chickenpox. Chickenpox is extremely contagious as over 90% of unvaccinated people become infected [20] , while herpes zoster occurs only in individuals who have had a primary VZV infection. Today, most cases of herpes zoster occur in individuals who are more than 45 years old.",

Another example comes from the Shetland Islands, off the Scottish coast. In the early 1900s the island inhabitants lived in small villages. Each island population was separated from the next island. Even in such isolated communities, several cases of varicella in children followed a single case of shingles in an adult [30] .

Humans appear in the fossil record 28,000 years ago and subsequently Neandertals disappeared.

The Hyperdisease Hypothesis of Mac-Phee and Marx [37] developed this scenario to explain megafaunal extinctions during the Pleistocene-Holocene transition. On the other hand, a disease-mediated extinction hypothesis for Neander-tals that has some possibility of empirical testing has not been presented previously. Earlier reports concerning possible rickets infections of Neandertals did not aim at explaining their extinction, but rather tried to explain Neandertal bone morphology [38] . A possible reason disease has not been considered is that it was a long held belief that Neandertals were not culturally sophisticated and were therefore displaced by more advanced AMHs. It is now clear that lack of cultural sophistication was certainly not applicable to Neandertals.",

Many of them have developed in tropical and sub-tropical regions of the world and crossed the species barrier when humans came in close contact with wild or domesticated animals. (2) There are a number of examples of chronic and recurring viral infections in humans that reach a very high seroprevalence in susceptible populations. Infections caused by retro-viruses, herpesviruses, hepadnaviruses and many others are able to develop into persistent infections lasting for years. (3) In immunocompetent humans many viral infections are not lethal, especially if a population has had enough time to adapt or to co-evolve with that pathogen. After a more or less pronounced acute phase after primary infection, symptoms often decline. Examples are HIV infections, hepatitis B and C and Herpes simplex. (4) If a viral infection is introduced into an immunologically na\u00efve population that has not encountered the virus for generations, the outcome may be dramatic. The introduction of measles and small pox into the Americas by Europeans resulted in millions of deaths in Native American populations. (5) Even if many viruses in fact depend on vectors, a large number of viruses can be transmitted by direct human-to-human contact as the viruses are often contained in body fluids and excrement. Smallpox, chickenpox, kissing disease and SARS are examples of viruses which can infect by means of direct human to human transmission.",
