On one hand, one of the first protective barriers set up to prevent viral replication, spread or persistence involves the induction of apoptotic cell death that aims to limit the availability of the cellular components for viral amplification. On the other hand, while they completely depend on the host molecular machinery, viruses also need to evade the cellular responses that are meant to destroy them. The existence of numerous antiapoptotic products within the viral kingdom proves that apoptosis constitutes a major threat that should better be bypassed. Among the different strategies developed to deal with apoptosis, one is based on what viruses do best: backfiring the cell on itself. Several unrelated viruses have been described to take advantage of apoptosis induction by expressing proteins targeted by caspases, the key effectors of apoptotic cell death. Caspase cleavage of these proteins results in various consequences, from logical apoptosis inhibition to more surprising enhancement or attenuation of viral replication. The present review aims at discussing the characterization and relevance of this post-translational modification that adds a new complexity in the already intricate host-apoptosis-virus triangle.",

[1] [2] [3] Dying this way, host cells are likely to generate specific signals aiming at triggering the immune system with innate and/or adaptative responses allowing the eradication of the invader. 4, 5 On the other hand, viruses have evolved a huge arsenal of strategies meant to either counteract or deal with this destructive process to ensure their survival. [6] [7] [8] Apoptotic cell death is accompanied by characteristic morphological changes (cellular rounding-up and volume reduction, chromatin condensation, nuclear fragmentation, plasma membrane blebbingy) and at a molecular level by the activation of first initiator and then effector cysteinyl aspartate proteinases or caspases. 9,10 Activated caspases act through a catalytic Cys that hydrolyzes peptide bonds within the substrate, with a stringent specificity for Asp residue at P1 position (the nature of residues at positions P2, P3 and P4 depending on the caspase). Caspase substrates include a large number and variety of cellular proteins that participate through their cleavage to the strong apoptosisrelated morphological changes, as well as other physiological processes. Interestingly, viral proteins are also likely to be cleaved by caspases but until 2004, only four of them were reported as such and suggested as advantaging the associated viruses through their cleavage. 11 Since, their number has greatly increased and at least 16 viruses are now known to express proteins that undergo caspase cleavage. Here, we aim at updating these cleavages and discussing their biological relevance. From apoptosis inhibition to the improvement or attenuation of viral amplification, caspase cleavage of VPs highlights a potential new fascinating viral strategy to handle apoptosis induction.",

ORF390 ability to suppress caspase activity is associated with consensual caspase cleavage sites: 269 DEVD 272 k that targets caspase 3, and 230 VETD 233 k and 300 LEHD 303 k that are both required for caspase 9 inhibition. Although each site specifically targets one protease, the three of them are needed to reach maximal caspase inactivation. 20 For baculoviruses and WSSV, inhibiting apoptosis is crucial to achieve their life cycle. These different invertebrateinfecting viruses encode proteins exhibiting active caspase cleavage sites, just as cellular substrates do, but with the special ability to irreversibly freeze the protease activity. This leads to a very potent and broad caspase inhibition, which keeps the host cell machinery available and fit for viral amplification.",

On permissive infection, AMDV induces caspase activation that is necessary for viral amplification. 22 This requirement was associated with NS1 protein being cleaved through two caspase 3 sites leading to five NS1-related products. 23 When one site is mutated within AMDV molecular clones, the viral production is strongly reduced and even aborted when both sites are disrupted. Interestingly, wild-type (WT) NS1 protein, which exerts replicative and transcriptional functions, is mostly nuclear, but when one of its cleavage sites is disrupted, the protein remains cytosolic resulting in a dramatic decrease in NS1-dependent viral protein (VP) expression. NS1-related C-terminal products, also nuclear, are suggested to be actively Human papillomavirus (HPV) is mostly known to infect epithelial cells of the genital tract and cause cervical cancers. On epithelial differentiation, HPV induces a DNA damage response that leads to caspase 3-dependent apoptosis. 24 Interestingly, HPV E1, a protein involved in viral DNA replication, is a target for caspases 3 and 7 at a site that is conserved in all genital HPVs and preventing E1 cleavage reduces viral amplification. When compared with chemically induced apoptosis, HPV-induced apoptotic markers are limited. Interestingly, HPV increases the levels of both antiapoptotic Bcl2 and Survivin proteins. 25 HPV pro-and antiapoptotic properties might achieve a caspase activity threshold that is sufficient for E1 cleavage and viral amplification, but not lethal for the host cell. Besides E1, HPV E6 protein is cleaved by caspases as well, but the functional consequences remain unknown. 26 Human astroviruses (HAstV) are responsible for gastroenteritis. In Yuc8 strain, orf2 encodes the precursor of viral capsid proteins, VP90, whose processing yields VP70. Besides, HAstV activates caspases 3, 4, 6, 7, 8 and 9. 27, 28 In vitro, caspases 3, 8 and 9 are able to target VP90 27 but only caspase 3 or 9 silencing reduces VP70 generation on infection. Interestingly, both intracellular VP90 processing into VP70 and progeny virion release are lost in the presence of a pan caspase inhibitor. However, in opposition to what was first suggested, viral release needs caspase activation but does not need VP90 processing into VP70 to be achieved. 27 But yielding fully infectious viruses does require shorter polypeptides to be created through VP70 further processing by trypsin. Thus, first cleaving VP90 to generate VP70 likely represents a crucial intermediate event during HAstV infection.",

On permissive infection, N protein localizes in both cytosol and nucleus while remaining cytosolic in cells undergoing persistent infection. Moreover, preventing N from translocating to the nucleus by mutating its nuclear localization signal abolishes its cleavage by caspases.

Accordingly, complementing a stable cell line containing an orf57-null KSHV genome with ectopic WT or uncleavable ORF57 promotes lytic gene expression, while ORF57 lacking residues 1-33 does not. Consistently, the number of cell-free virus particles dramatically increases when caspase 7 is inhibited.

Interestingly, AMDV capsid proteins VP1 and 2 are also processed by caspases on viral infection or ectopic expression. 31 The cleavage generates a stable 26-kDa product, VPx, and can be partly prevented by the pharmacological inhibition of caspases 6, 8, 9 and 10, and completely by a pan caspase inhibitor. Besides, VP protein expression in either transfected or AMDV-infected cells mainly activates caspase 10, followed by caspases 6, 9, 3 and 7, with caspase 7 as the more efficient in VP cleavage in vitro. Altogether, these data argue for the involvement of several caspases in VP cleavage. AMDV-G strain grows more efficiently at 31.8 1C than 37 1C. The alteration of the caspase site within AMDV-G increases both VP and genomic copies production at the non-optimal temperature of 37 1C and shows no significant effects at 31.8 1C, suggesting that VP caspase cleavage attenuates AMDV-G life cycle. In vivo AMDV-G infection might thus be regulated by active caspases because it only occurs at 37 1C. Interestingly, NS1 cleavage favors viral DNA replication while VP processing would limit the packaging of progeny virions. As it is possible that both NS1 and VP cleavages do not inevitably occur simultaneously depending on the pattern of activated caspases, it would result in either effective or attenuated viral replication and allow the virus to spread or persist.",

However H-1PV is able to activate caspases in non-transformed cells, leading to the cleavage of NS1, a non-structural protein (NS) notably involved in viral DNA replication and gene expression by transactivating P38 promoter, which controls the synthesis of capsid proteins. Cleaved NS1 protein (named NS1-Nterm) lacks its C-terminal transactivation domain. When ectopically expressed, NS1-Nterm acts as a dominant negative on NS1-driven P38 promoter transactivation, and dramatically decreases viral production. Moreover, a molecular clone expressing an uncleavable version of NS1 tends to generate more virions. As cancer cells are often refractory to proper apoptotic induction, we propose that H-1PV oncotropism is due, at least in part, to the inability of cancer cells to cleave NS1 protein, thus allowing strong virus production. On the other hand, NS1 cleavage would act as a sensor of antiviral defenses and accordingly attenuate viral amplification, likely to favor persistent infection (our unpublished results). Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus (CCHFV) causes severe coagulation dysfunction in humans. CCHFV nucleocapsid protein (NP) is an important structural protein also involved in viral replication and, when ectopically expressed with an apoptotic factor such as Bax protein, it generates two fragments through cleavage at a consensual 266 DEVD 269 k motif. 32 A caspase 3 inhibitor and cells lacking caspase 3 both allows a one log-increase in the production of virions, which suggests that caspase activation is involved in CCHFV attenuation. Thus, NP caspase cleavage and/or NP-related products may participate to this attenuation although the mechanisms remain to be investigated. Interestingly, the caspase cleavage site is conserved within all the strains that were checked, suggesting that it is an important feature for CCHFV regulation.",

            "text": "Influenza viruses are structured into ribonucleoprotein segments consisting of viral RNA and viral proteins, the major one being the NP. Unlike avian NP, NP proteins from human influenza A and B viruses are long known to be caspase targets. 33, 34 Human influenza with uncleavable ('avian-like') NP is dramatically less lethal for mice, along with lower viral titers and faster clearance than its WT counterpart. This argues for the involvement of NP caspase cleavage in the virulence of influenza virus. But making avian NP cleavable (i.e. making the protein 'human-like' by introducing the same caspase cleavage site) does not enhance the viral virulence as could have been expected. Thus, modulating influenza pathogenicity through NP caspase cleavage would be a specificity of human strains that cannot be extrapolated to avian ones. 35 However, avian influenza pathogenicity might still be regulated by caspase cleavage. The viral ionic channel M2 protein is also cleaved by caspases, likely caspase 2 and/ or 3 36, 37 in both human and avian influenza viruses and was shown to be associated with avian influenza pathogenicity. 37 Altogether, these studies highlight that modulating influenza caspase sites attenuates the virus although through currently unknown mechanisms. 37, 38 Hepatitis C virus (HCV) often leads to chronic infection evolving to cirrhosis and possibly hepatocellular carcinoma. HCV core protein induces activation of caspases 2 and 6, and interacts with viral NS5A protein that is cleaved by the activated caspases. [39] [40] [41] [42] Several studies point to a role of NS5A cleavage in its subcellular localization. The protein is mainly found in the cytosol while exerting nuclear functions. NS5A caspase cleavage was first suggested to allow the removal of a C-terminal cytoplasmic retention signal along with the translocation of the C-terminal deleted NS5A to the nucleus, reminding what was already described for AMDV NS1 protein. 42 However, a study more recently reported a cytosolic localization of these C-terminal truncated forms of NS5A and no obvious role of NS5A caspase cleavage in its trafficking. 40 Although its characterization is well admitted, the functional relevance of NS5A cleavage is still debated.",

The name of the virus, nature of its genome and caspase(s) induced on infection are indicated. The characteristics of the cleavages were also summarized, with identity of the cleavage site(s), caspase(s) able to cleave in vitro and/or in cellulo (sometimes different from caspases induced in cells undergoing infection) and suggested functions of the caspase-related products as often as possible. Vertical black arrows indicate where cleavage occurs viral serotype. Furthermore, when apoptosis is chemically induced in AdE1A-transformed cells, AdE1A levels decrease but can be restored using a pan caspase inhibitor. 47 However, AdE1A levels remain stable on adenovirus infection despite TNFa-induced caspase activation. Thus, although AdE1A caspase cleavage is likely to occur, its existence on infection as well as its biological relevance for adenoviruses remains elusive so far. Interestingly, AdE1A-binding abilities to transcription factors such as CBP and TBP are affected by the cleavage, suggesting that it might modulate the expression of early viral genes.",

            "text": "Viruses Face Up to Apoptosis: Die Harder. There are clear evidences concerning the relevance of viral protein caspase cleavages in the physiology of viruses ( Figure 1) . Coherently, such a modification is used to directly fight apoptosis and AcMNPV as well as WSSV express proteins acting as strong and broad inhibitor caspase substrates. For other viruses, caspase cleavage probably allows the removal of specific regions that reveals or eliminates functional domains or signals. In some cases, this leads to full viral amplification (AMDV NS1, HPV E1), with the striking example of AMDV NS1 protein that needs to be cleaved by caspases to translocate to the nucleus and eventually exert its functions. On the contrary, caspase cleavage can result in the attenuation of the virus by generating new viral products acting as dominant negatives of NS proteins (H-1PV NS1, KSHV ORF57) or unfit for virus packaging when structural proteins are concerned (AMDV VP and possibly FCV capsid protein). Interestingly, such attenuation at a cellular level might hold importance regarding the possibility for viruses to establish permissive and/or persistent infection at a higher scale (i.e. multicellular organisms). The functional consequences of some viral protein caspase cleavages still remain debated or elusive because of the difficulty of investigating hazardous entities (influenza, HCV), the multitude of strains and genotypes (influenza, HCV, adenovirus) or the lack of appropriate tools such as cellular or animal models allowing to recapitulate the viral life cycle (TGEV, MCV). When caspase cleavages of viral proteins work in too mysterious ways, it is sometimes concluded that they constitute a mechanism of degradation resulting from the host fighting back the infection. However, the caspase-related products detected are mostly stable, suggesting they could be somehow involved in the viral life cycle as mentioned right above. Besides, knowing how high the mutation rates of viruses can be, 50 or that some viral oncoproteins (like v-Rel) adapted to resist caspase cleavage through evolution unlike their cellular counterparts, 51 keeping caspase cleavage sites seems very unlikely if viruses do not somehow profit from them. As caspase cleavage of viral proteins occurs in all sorts of proteins (structural or non-structural) and in all sorts of viruses (DNA as well as RNA), this suggests that it constitutes a strong strategy to handle apoptosis. By managing to use the molecular effectors of apoptosis to protect themselves from eradication without any additional genetic information required, viruses prove once again how fascinating their adaptability can be.
