Validated ligand-and structurebased pharmacophore mapping approaches were combined with Bayesian modeling and recursive partitioning to identify structural and physicochemical requirements for highly active APN inhibitors. Based on the assumption that ligandand structure-based pharmacophore models are complementary, the efficacy of 'multiple pharmacophore screening' for filtering true positive virtual hits was investigated. These multiple pharmacophore screening methods were utilized to search novel virtual hits for APN inhibition. The number of hits was refined and reduced by recursive partitioning, druglikeliness, pharmacokinetic property prediction, and comparative molecular-docking studies. Four compounds were proposed as the potential virtual hits for APN enzyme inhibition.",

            "text": "Aminopeptidase N (APN, EC 3.4.11.2) is a zinc-dependent membrane type II endopeptidase. It belongs to the M1 family of MA clan (metallo-peptidase superfamily) of peptidases. It contains 967 amino acids and has a relative molecular mass (M r ) of \u223c99,000 [1] . APN is mainly involved in ATP-dependent downstream processing during cytosolic protein degradation. It enables the utilization of amino acids as nutrients [2] . This enzyme is found in a variety of species, such as mammals, insects, plants, and bacteria. Human APN is identical to the human lymphocyte surface cluster differentiation antigen CD13. It is also known as APN/CD13, which is widely distributed in mammals. It is expressed on the surface of different cells, such as epithelial cells of the intestine and kidney, synaptic membranes in the central nervous system, fibroblasts, endothelial cells, epithelial cells, sebocytes, and keratinocytes [1] . Deregulation of APN/CD13 expression is observed in many diseases, such as cancer, chronic pain [3] , and various forms of joint effusions, rheumatoid arthritis [4] , multiple sclerosis [5] , systemic sclerosis, and systemic lupus erythematosus [6] . APN plays a crucial role in tumor invasion, metastasis, and angiogenesis [7] in cancer. The over-expression of APN was reported in breast, colon, gastric, ovarian, pancreatic, renal, and thyroid cancer [7] . Therefore, it is used as an important clinical marker in cancer [1] . APN also functions as a receptor for corona virus like gastroenteritis virus and human corona virus 229E [2] . Inhibition of APN/CD13 may be useful for treatment of such diseases [1] . Bestatin was first identified as APN inhibitor, isolated from Streptomyces olivoreticuli [8] , and reported to improve immunological functions by enhancing the chemotaxis of T lymphocytes.",

Recently, the X-ray crystal structure of human APN (hAPN) complex with bestatin [9] was reported, and it provided the opportunity to understand the mechanism of action of different APN inhibitors by structure-based analysis. In this study, an attempt was made to highlight the structural and physicochemical requirements of APN inhibitors. We also tried to find novel scaffolds as virtual hits to design potent drug-like APN inhibitors. Both ligand-and structure-based pharmacophore mapping studies were performed to identify the 3D structural requirements for potent APN inhibitory activity. Two different QSAR approaches, i.e., Bayesian modeling and recursive partitioning (RP) techniques, were adopted to understand the physicochemical and 2D structural requirements for better APN inhibitory activity. Simultaneously, 'multiple pharmacophore-based virtual screening' was employed for the selection of virtual hits from the diverse chemical databases. The best RP model was utilized to select virtual hits from the ligands obtained from 'multiple pharmacophore-based virtual screening'. Comparative molecular docking studies with three different docking tools were performed to search the most potential drug-like virtual hits as well as to predict possible interactions between proposed virtual hits and the catalytic residues at the binding site of APN enzyme.",

IC 50 values of all these compounds were determined by the same group of authors using l-leucinep-nitroanilide as the substrate and microsomal aminopeptidase N from porcine kidney microsomes as the enzyme. This data set (internal data set) was used for the development as well as preliminary validation of pharmacophore models. The molecules of the data set have wide range of inhibitory activity (IC 50 ), from 1.8 to 9108.6 \u00b5M. Moreover, a second data set (external data set) containing 175 compounds was collected from the binding database (BD) [20] . Unlike internal dataset, the biological activities of these compounds were determined by various assay methods by different group of authors, and APN inhibitory activity of these molecules was expressed either in IC 50 or in k i (the dissociation constant for inhibitor binding). From the BD compounds, 101 compounds were arbitrarily chosen as 'active' APN inhibitors (reported IC 50 < 15 \u00b5Mor k i < 0.050 \u00b5M) and 74 compounds were arbitrarily selected as 'inactive' APN inhibitors (reported IC 50 > 10 2 \u00b5M or k i > 10 2 \u00b5M). Comparing with the internal data set, the external compounds contain more structural and biological activity variations. The purpose of using an external data set was to assess the overall performance of pharmacophore models and to develop Bayesian and RP models. The detailed information of internal and external data set compounds is provided in the supporting information (Tables S1 and S2 , respectively).",

A diverse set of conformations of these compounds was generated using the FAST conformer generation method, where maximum number of conformers and the energy range were chosen as 255 and 20 kcal/mol, respectively.",

            "text": "The developed 3D pharmacophore hypotheses were validated by three different methods, (1) cost analyses, (2) Fischer randomization test and (3) test set prediction [22] . In the cost analysis method, three cost values-fixed, total, and null cost of the generated hypotheses were analyzed. The fixed or ideal cost is the cost of simple possible hypothesis that fits all the data in a perfect manner. The null cost or no correlation cost is the cost of the hypothesis without any feature. The value of the total cost of the generated hypothesis should lie between the fixed cost and the null cost. It should be close to that of the fixed cost value, but away from the null cost value. The correlation coefficient, root mean square deviation (RMSD) and configuration cost are the other parameters considered in the cost analysis. The configuration cost (determines the complexity of the hypothesis) should be less than 17 and the RMSD value (explains the quality of the correlation between the experimental and estimated values) should be less than 1.5 for a standard pharmacophore hypothesis [23] . Fischer randomization test was used to ensure whether a strong correlation exists between the chemical structures and the biological activities of the training set compounds. The test was performed at 95 % confidence level, where the biological activities of the training set data were scrambled using the same features and parameters used in development of original hypothesis. If any randomization run produces hypothesis with better correlation coefficient and/or less total cost, the original hypothesis may be considered to be developed by chance. The third validation method, i.e. the test set prediction was used to ensure that the pharmacophore hypotheses were well predictive on a set of diverse compounds other than the training set compounds. The test set containing 150 compounds was subjected to Ligand pharmacophore mapping protocol in DS [21] to map these compounds in the generated hypothesis, and to obtain the estimated activity value for each compound. The higher correlation coefficient between the experimental and the estimated activity of the test set indicates better external predictability of the generated hypothesis.",

Tree 1 was selected as the best model (Model 4) on the basis of receiver operating characteristic (ROC) score (0.926) and cross-validated ROC curve (0.807). Moreover, when the model was validated with 31 test set compounds, the ROC score was 0.790. The details statistical analysis of Model 4 is provided in supporting information (Table S7 ). The schematic representation of the RP-tree 1 model is shown in Fig. 4 . Figure 4 depicts the development of Model 4 with six selected descriptors along with their cut-off values that were used for developing and validating the model. It demonstrates that nPA, MFPSA, Kappa_3_AM, AlogP, PHI, and HBA_count played important roles in distinguishing actives from inactives. The functionality of these descriptors are listed in Table S8 (supporting information). In Fig. 4 , the p values are for winning class and reflect sample weight. 1 means active and 0 stands for inactive. In this model, the training set contains 87 actives and 57 inactive compounds. Each active sample is assigned a weight of 94 and each inactive sample is assigned a weight of 87, e.g. in node 1, 46 active and 4 inactive compounds are observed. Therefore, p(1) can be calculated by the expression: 57 \u00d7 46/(87 \u00d7 4 + 57 \u00d7 46). In the RP model, NPA (total number of atoms in a molecule with a positive charge) was found to be the main classifier, which may be correlated with the fact that the positive ionizable features, like primary amines play important role in the ligand-receptor interaction. The physicochemical descriptor MFPSA is the ratio of the polar surface area to that the total surface area. It is evident from Fig. 3a that the catalytic site of APN contains amino acids having polar side chains (e.g., glutamic acid, tyrosine, etc.) as well as polar water molecules that participate in the receptorligand interactions. Although the model highlights the importance of ionizable groups, these are not the sole determinant for the higher activity of these molecules. Hydrogen-bond acceptor and donor groups also play vital roles in the ligandreceptor interactions. Therefore, the significance of MFPSA as a second major classifier of the model (for the compounds that lacked nPA) reconfirms that the polarity of the molecule has considerable importance for APN inhibition. The number of hydrogen-bond acceptor was also found to be important, and the significance of it was found in the pharmacophore mapping approach. In addition, AlogP (logarithm of octanol-water partition coefficient determined by the Ghose and Crippen's method [38] ) was found to be important for APN inhibition of compounds that had lower cutoff values of both nPA and MFPSA. The function of hydrophobic descriptor may be easily understood as the binding site of hAPN comprises of hydrophobic pockets and hydrophobic interactions with residues like Phe472 and Ser469 were reported for bestatin. In addition, two topological kappa-shaped index descriptors, PHI and Kappa_3_AM were appeared in the model. The Kappa_3_AM is alpha-modified shape index of order three and PHI is the molecular flexibility index. These topological descriptors appeared in the model for compounds having higher values of MFPSA. Therefore, it may be interpreted that flexibility of the molecule is an important criterion for higher activity.",

The Bayesian modeling reconfirmed that polar moieties, like amide, carboxylic acid, and phosphinyl groups are favorable. The functionality of aromatic moieties may be intriguing because these appeared in both favorable and unfavorable fingerprints. However, unfavorable aromatic rings were either attached to polar residues or have exocyclic conjugation. Both of the functionalities may be related to aromaticity of these rings. It was interesting to find that acyclic rings appeared as the most unfavorable fingerprints due to lack of features (positive charge, polarity, and ring aromaticity) required for higher activity.",

An ideal pharmacophore query is able to capture active molecules selectively from the databases discarding inactive molecules. Therefore, prior to virtual screening the selectivity of the model should be properly assessed. The decoy set validation is the most popular and widely used approach to confirm overall specificity of a model [43] [44] [45] [46] . The decoy set is a set of compounds, where some known active compounds are combined with inactives or decoys, and the whole set is screened with the selected pharmacophore query. The selection of inactive compounds for decoy set validation is very crucial for unbiased virtual screening. The selectivity of the pharmacophore model may be represented either by ROC curve [43, 45] or by GH score [44, 46] . The largest public available database of decoys is directory of useful decoys (DUD), which provides decoys for limited number of targets [47] . In the absence of DUD for a particular target, the selection of inactives depends on the users. However, the latter approach may have two major limitations, (a) it often presumes the inactivity of the decoys despite lack of supporting evidence [48] and (b) the decoy selection method may lack transparency. Moreover, Verdonk et al. [49] earlier demonstrated that some 1D molecular properties may affect the results of docking-based virtual screening, and their proposal may be extrapolated to pharmacophore-based virtual screening as well [43] . According to Verdonk et al., it is not sufficient to use a random library (subsets of public databases) for performance assessments, but it is essential to build up a focused library that reflects the physicochemical properties of the active set. Verdonk principle may be utilized for the selection of decoys [49] . In the current approach an alternative procedure has been adopted which includes the following steps, (a) selection of an well identified and recognizable decoy set from a public database (i.e. BD), which is considerably less focused than internal dataset used for the pharmacophore model development, (b) validation of the decoy sets by multiple screening with three different pharmacophore models developed in the current study, and (c) determination of activity profile by RP model developed from the external data set. The justification of these steps (a, b and c) is discussed in the supporting information (Text S3). To substantiate the idea of multiple screening, the external data set was screened with three different pharmacophore queries (Models 1, 2, and 3) as shown in Fig. 6 .",

The protonated nitrogen atoms of these residues were mapped over the positive ionizable feature, and also interacted with the catalytic amino acid residues. Flippo et al. [50] earlier investigated some quinoline antimalarial agents, which strongly inhibited mammalian APN enzyme (lowest IC 50 = 0.028 \u00b5M). These compounds also contained piperazine moiety as the only positive ionizable group. Chelerythrin, a natural product containing quaternary nitrogen, also showed 82 % inhibition of APN [3] . Ligand-receptor interactions of these compounds were not reported earlier. Apart from the positive ionizable features, the proposed virtual hits also contained polar groups and aromatic rings, which were found to be important in APN inhibitory activity. All virtual hits were found to form \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 interaction with the catalytic amino acid residues.

Ligand-and structurebased pharmacophore mapping, RP and Bayesian modeling were carried out and all models were properly validated to achieve the first objective. Both ligand-and structurebased pharmacophore mapping suggested that four features: (a) positive ionizable, (b) acceptor, (c) donor, and (d) ring aromatic are essential for the receptor-ligand interactions.",

            "text": "The 3D QSAR pharmacophore model may be utilized for prediction of bioactivity of the ligands. RP modeling was performed on a diverse set of molecules, and it showed positive ionizable (P) feature may be the most important determinant for APN inhibition, and increased polarity of the molecule has positive contribution for higher biological activity. Besides, hydrophobicity [related to ring aromatic (RA)] was also found to be involved in receptor-ligand interaction. RP modeling presented some cut-off values of important descriptors that demarcate the active inhibitors from that of inactives. These may be utilized for the design of new molecules. In addition, Bayesian model highlighted some favorable and unfavorable fingerprints, which may also be utilized for the novel lead design purpose. The results of pharmacophore mapping, RP and Bayesian modeling were comparable and consistent enough to indicate the success of each modeling approach. To explore the second objective, an external random data set was constructed from reported APN inhibitors available in a public database (BD). It was shown that multiple screening by the ligand-and structure-based models may decrease the number of false positives gradually even from a random decoy set, the use of which is not recommended [49] for screening approaches in order to avoid low enrichment. Moreover, it was also found that the ligand-and structure-based pharmacophore models are complementary [51] because sequential screening by ligand-and structurebased pharmacophore queries gradually reduced the number of inactive virtual hits. The multiple screening followed by the RP prediction further reduced the number of false positive hits. This composite approach of screening also decreased the number of true positives to a considerable extent (Fig. 7) . However, the main success of this approach lies in the fact that it is less complicated and maintains transparency in terms of the selection of decoys as well as the validation of the model. The last objective of the work was to search some potential virtual hits of APN inhibitors. Multiple pharmacophore screenings followed by RP prediction were carried out from some public databases. The retrieved virtual hits were tested for drug-likeness and pharmacokinetic properties. The filtered virtual hits were docked at the receptor active site, and four compounds showing consistent results in three different docking tools were ultimately proposed as the most potential virtual hits. All virtual hits were found to contain essential features like positive charge, polarity, and ring aromaticity, and may help to obtain useful APN inhibitors.",

Hyporefine generated ten pharmacophore hypotheses with fixed and null cost values of 74.43 and 275.83, respectively. Among ten hypotheses, the first hypothesis (Model 1) was selected as the best pharmacophore on the basis of the cost values, correlation coefficient and RMSD value. Model 1 showed the lowest total cost (91.24) with a cost difference (null cost-total cost) of 184.58, indicating that the model and data are correlated by more than 90 %. The correlation value of this hypothesis was 0.961, which suggests the model is capable of predicting the activity of the training set compounds. In addition, lower RMSD value (1.15) of the hypothesis further supports the predictive ability of the model. The configuration cost of the model was found as 13.89, which was much lower than the cutoff value of 17.",
