As of February 19, 2020 , the WHO has reported over 75,204 COVID-19 infections and over 2,009 COVID-19 deaths (2) , while key aspects of the transmission dynamics of COVID-19 remain unclear (3) . The serial interval of COVID-19 is defined as the time duration between a primary case (infector) developing symptoms and secondary case (infectee) developing symptoms (4, 5) . Obtaining robust estimates for the distribution of COVID-19 serial intervals is a critical input for determining the reproduction number which can indicate the extent of interventions required to control an epidemic (6) .",

First, the data are restricted to online reports of confirmed cases and therefore may be biased towards more severe cases in areas with a high-functioning healthcare and public health infrastructure. The rapid isolation such cases may have prevented longer serial intervals, potentially shifting our estimate downwards compared to serial intervals that might be observed in an uncontrolled epidemic. Second, the distribution of serial intervals varies throughout an epidemic, with the time between successive cases contracting around the epidemic peak (18) . To provide intuition, a susceptible person is likely to become infected more quickly if they are surrounded by two infected people rather than just one. Since our estimates are based primarily on transmission events reported during the early stages of outbreaks, we do not explicitly account for such compression and interpret the estimates as basic serial intervals at the outset of an epidemic.",

Third, the identity of each infector and the timing of symptom onset were presumably based on individual recollection of past events. If recall accuracy is impeded by time or trauma, cases may be more likely to attribute infection to recent encounters (short serial intervals) over past encounters (longer serial intervals). In contrast, the reported serial intervals may be biased upwards by travel-related delays in transmission from primary cases that were infected in Wuhan or another city before returning home.

The lognormal distribution provides the best fit for the truncated data (followed closely by the gamma and Weibull). However, we do not believe there is cause for excluding the non-positive data and would caution against making assessments and projections based on the truncated data.

First, we left truncated the data (i.e., removed all non-positive values) for (a) all 468 infection events and (b) the subset of infection events ( N = 122) in which both the infector and infectee were infected in the reporting city (i.e., the index case was not an importation from another city). Second, we shifted the data by adding 12 days to each reported serial interval for (c) all infection events and (d) the subset of infection events in which both the infector and infectee were locally infected.

We estimate a mean serial interval for COVID-19 of 3.96 [95% CI 3.53-4.39] with a standard deviation of 4.75 [95% CI 4.46-5.07], which is considerably lower than reported mean serial intervals of 8.4 days for SARS (9) and 12.6 days (10) -14.6 days (11) for MERS. The mean serial interval is slightly but not significantly longer when the index case is imported (4.06 days [95% CI 3.55-4.57]) versus locally infected (3.66 days [95% CI 2.84-4.47]); it is slightly shorter when the secondary transmission occurs within a household (4.03 days [95% CI 3.12-4.94]) versus outside of the household (4.56 days [95% CI: 3.85-5.27]). Combining these findings with published estimates for the early exponential growth rate COVID-19 in Wuhan (12,13) , we estimate a basic reproduction number ( R 0 ) of 1.32 [95% CI 1.16-1.48] (6) , which is lower than published estimates that assume a mean serial interval exceeding seven days (13-15) . These estimates reflect reported symptom onset dates for 752 cases from 93 Chinese cities, who range in age from 1 to 90 years (mean 45.2 years and SD 17.21 years).
