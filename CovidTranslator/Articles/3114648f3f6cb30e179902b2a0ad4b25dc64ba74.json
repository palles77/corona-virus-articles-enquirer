In this study, we show that the envelope (E) protein of severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus can induce membrane permeability changes when expressed in Escherichia coli. E protein expressed in bacterial and mammalian cells under reducing conditions existed as monomers, but formed homodimer and homotrimer under non-reducing conditions. Site-directed mutagenesis studies revealed that two cysteine residues of the E protein were essential for oligomerization, leading to induction of membrane permeability. This is the first report demonstrating that a coronavirus-encoded protein could modify membrane permeability in E. coli cells.",

Similar to other coronaviruses, SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) is an enveloped virus with a single strand, positive-sense RNA genome of 29.7 kb in length. Upon virus entry into cells, a 3 0 -coterminal nested set of 9 mRNAs is produced [20] . The genome-length mRNA, mRNA1, expresses two overlapping replicase proteins in the form of polyproteins 1a and 1a/b. The polyproteins are subsequently processed into at least 16 putative nonstructural proteins (NSP1-NSP16) by virus-encoded proteinases [20] . The mature proteins comprise proteinases, RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, and helicase, involved in the genomic and subgenomic RNA synthesis. The four structural proteins, arranged in the order 5 0 -S-E-M-N-3 0 , are encoded by subgenomic mRNA 2, 4, 5, and 9, respectively. In addition, eight putative nonstructural proteins, 3a, 3b, 6, 7a, 7b, 8a, 8b, and 9b, are encoded by mRNA3, 6, 7, 8, and 9 , respectively [20] . They are unique proteins of SARS-CoV and very little is known about the functions of these nonstructural proteins [18, 20] .",

Analysis of the E protein expressed in bacterial and mammalian cells demonstrated that the protein may form homodimer and homotrimer, and site-directed mutagenesis studies revealed that two cysteine residues of the E protein located at amino acid positions 40 and 44 are essential for the formation of oligomers and for induction of membrane permeability in Escherichia coli cells.

Once again, no obvious band corresponding to protein 6 was detected (Fig. 1B, lane 10) , indicating the expression of this protein at a very low level in the bacterial cells. As significant inhibition of the growth of bacterial cells carrying this gene was observed (Fig. 1A) , it suggests that the protein may be highly toxic to bacte-ria.

It was also noted that induction of the empty vector, pET24a, affects the growth of bacteria carrying the plasmid, compared with bacteria carrying pET24-3a and pET24-3b (Fig. 1A) .

To analyze the involvement of these cysteine residues in the oliogomerization of E protein, site-directed mutagenesis of these cysteine residues to alanine either individually or in combination of two or three was made to generate five mutants (M1-M5). Mutant M1 contains mutation at the C1 position, M2 at C2, and M3 at C3. M4 contains mutations at both the C1 and C2 positions, and M5 contains mutations at all three positions.

As shown in Fig. 4B , both the 9.3-kDa monomer and the 27-kDa homotrimer were detected in bacterial cells expressing wild type E protein and M2 under non-reducing conditions (lanes 1 and 3) . Only the 9.3-kDa monomer was detected in bacterial cells expressing M1, M3, M4, and M5 under the same non-reducing conditions (Fig. 4B, lanes 2, 4, 5, and 6) . As mentioned, a protein band of approximately 18 kDa migrating between the 9.3-kDa monomer and the 27-kDa homotrimer was detected in cells expressing both wild type E protein and M2 (Fig. 4B, lanes 1 and 3) . These results confirm that the two cysteine residues are involved in oligomerization of the E protein by formation of interchain disulfide bonds.",

These 1 and 2) and the flag-tagged E protein expressed in HeLa cells were separated on SDS-15% polyacrylamide gels under reducing (lanes 2 and 4) and non-reducing (lanes 1 and 3) conditions. Polypeptides were transferred to PVDF membrane and probed with anti-His (lanes 1 and 2) and anti-Flag (lanes 3 and 4) monoclonal antibodies, respectively. After incubation with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse IgG, the E protein was detected by a chemiluminescence detection kit. Numbers on the left indicate molecular masses in kiloDaltons. proteins contain at least one transmembrane domain that interacts with and expands the lipid bilayer, and could form hydrophilic pores in the membrane by oligomerization, with hydrophilic residues presumably facing the aqueous lumen of the pore [4, 7] . The hydrophilic channels would allow low molecular weight hydrophilic molecules across the membrane barrier, leading to the disruption of membrane potential, collapse of ionic gradients, and release of essential compounds from the cell. Alterations in ion concentration, such as enhancing the intracellular concentration of sodium ions, in the cytoplasm of virus-infected cells at the beginning of viral protein synthesis would favor virus replication. This would promote translation of viral versus cellular mRNAs, as translation of mRNAs from many cytolytic animal viruses is fairly resistant to high sodium concentrations. In contrast, high sodium concentrations are inhibitory to the translation of most cellular mRNAs [4, 7] . Progressive membrane damage during viral replication cycles would also result in cell lysis, promote virus release, and facilitate virus spread to surrounding cells. Disruption of the function of viroporins would therefore abrogate viral infectivity, rendering this group of viral proteins suitable targets for the development of antiviral drugs.",
