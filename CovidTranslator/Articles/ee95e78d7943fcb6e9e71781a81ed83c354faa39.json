Disease refers to a definable deviation from a normal phenotype (observable characteristics due to genome and environment), evident via patient complaints (symptoms), and/or the measurements of a careful observer (signs). The cause of the disease is referred to as its etiology (from the Greek word meaning the study of cause). One disease entity can have more than one etiology, and one etiology can lead to more than one disease. Each disease entity develops through a series of mechanistic chemical and cellular steps. This stepwise process of disease development is referred to as its pathogenesis (from the Greek word meaning generation of suffering).",

Patient workup uses present illness history with reference to past medical history, review of other organ systems for other abnormalities, review of family history, physical examination, radiographic studies, clinical laboratory studies (for example, peripheral blood or CSF specimens), and anatomic pathology laboratory studies (for example, tissue biopsy or pleural fluid cytology specimens). As you will see from other chapters in this book, the ability to rapidly and inexpensively screen for chromosomal translocations, copy number variation, genetic variation, and abundance of mRNA and miRNA is adding substantial molecular correlative information to the workup of diseases.",

The conclusion of the workup generally results in a specific diagnosis which meets a set of diagnostic criteria, and which explains the patient's symptoms and phenotypic abnormalities. Obviously, arrival at the correct diagnosis is a function of the examining physician and pathologist (fund of knowledge, experience, alertness), the prevalence of the disease in question in the particular patient (age, race, sex, site), and the sensitivity/specificity of the screening tests used (physical exam, vital signs, blood solutes, tissue stains, genetic assays). The pathologic diagnosis represents the best estimate currently possible of the disease entity affecting the patient, and is the basis for downstream follow-up and treatment decisions. The diagnosis implies a natural history (course of disease, including chronicity, functional impairment, survival) that most patients with this disease are expected to follow. Be aware that not all patients with a given disease will naturally follow the same disease course, so differences in patient outcome do not necessarily correspond to incorrect diagnosis. Variables that independently correlate with clinical outcome differences are called independent prognostic variables, and are routinely assessed in an effort to predict the natural history of the disease in the patient. It is also important to note that medical therapies for specific diseases do not always work. Variables that independently correlate with (predict) responses to therapy are called independent predictive variables.",

Thus, the start point for written medical history corresponds to around 1700 BC for Mesopotamian rules in the code of Hammurabi, and around 1550 BC for the analogous Egyptian rules in the Ebers papyrus. By definition, these philosophers, theologians, and physicians had access and assets to allow a written record, and materials and storage sufficient for the written records to survive. The Mesopotamian records indicate a deitydriven and demon-driven theory and empirical practice by recognized professional physicians. In this context, the prevailing thought was that \"Disease was caused by spirit invasion, sorcery, malice, or the breaking of taboos; sickness was both judgment and punishment\" [2] .",

            "text": "The Greek medical community evolved a theory of disease related to natural causes and effects, with less emphasis on deity-driven theory. The Hippocratic Corpus includes \"On the Sacred Disease\" (circa 400 BC), which rejected a divine origin for diseases, and postulated a natural rather than supernatural basis for disease etiology (\". . . nowise more divine nor more sacred than other diseases, but has a natural cause . . . like other affections.\"). Aristotle (384-322 BC) wrote broadly on A B topics including logic, biology, physics, metaphysics, and psychology. To Aristotle, observations led to a description of causes, or first principles, which in turn could be used logically in syllogisms to predict future observations. We would agree with these basic notions of induction and deduction. However, there was a different background philosophical construct regarding the nature of matter and causality (four elements, four humors, and four causes, including a final or teleologic purpose). We would recognize Aristotle's \"efficient\" cause of a disease as its etiology. Alexander the Great's conquest of Egypt in the 4th century BC led to Greek (Ptolemaic) leadership of Egypt from 305 BC to 30 BC, with development of the Alexandrian library and University. Faculty such as Euclid developed geometric models of vision (Optica), and Herophilus described human anatomy by direct dissection and observation (Greek medicine apparently allowed dissection in Alexandria, including vivisection of the condemned). During the Roman imperial era, Galen (129-207 AD) used dissection and observation of other animals such as the macaque (human dissection was illegal) to extrapolate to human anatomy and physiology. Like Aristotle's approach, Galen's approach to patients, diseases, and treatments was guided by philosophical constructs of four humors (blood, phlegm, yellow bile, and black bile) and the resulting temperaments (buoyant, sluggish, quick-tempered, and melancholic) due to humoral imbalances. It is thought that many of Galen's texts were destroyed with the Alexandrian library before the 7th century AD, but a subset was preserved and translated by Middle Eastern scholars. These ancient classic texts were then retranslated into Latin and Greek when printing houses developed in the 15th century (for instance, Hippocrates' De Natura Hominis, circa 1480 AD, and Galen's Therapeutica, circa 1500 AD). The historical picture of the Greco-Roman understanding of disease is one of empirical approaches to diseases based on inaccurate understanding of anatomy, physiology, and organ/cellular pathology. Greek medicine became less superstitious and more natural causeand-effect oriented, yet philosophy still trumped direct observation, such that evidence was constrained to fit the classic philosophical constructs. Some of the concepts sound familiar; for example, normal represents equilibrium and disease represents disequilibrium. However, we would differ on what variables are in disequilibrium (the historical humors, numbers, and opposites versus contemporary chemical and kinetic equilibria).",

During these middle ages for Western Europe outside Spain, there was apparently a retreat to pre-Hellenistic beliefs in supernatural forces that intervened in human affairs, with protecting saints and relics for disease prevention and therapy. Centers of medical learning following the Spanish Muslim model developed in Montpellier, France, and in Salerno, Italy, beginning in the 11th century.",

(Euclid thought that the eye generated the image, rather than light reflected from the object being received by the eye). In the 13th century, Roger Bacon reinforced this use of observation, hypothesis, and experimentation. The printing press (Gutenberg, 1440 AD) allowed document standardization and reproduction, such that multiple parallel university and city libraries could afford to have similar collections of critical texts, facilitating scholarly publications in journals. Access to publications in libraries and universities led to a system of review, demonstration, discussion, and consensus regarding new scientific findings.",

The ancient models of Aristotle and Galen had become sacrosanct, and newer, evidence-based models were considered heretical to some degree. So it was somewhat revolutionary when Vesalius dissected corpses, compared them with Galenic descriptions, and published De humani corporis fabrica libri septem (1543 AD; \"Seven Books on the Structure of the Human Body\"; the Fabrica), challenging and correcting 16th century understanding of normal human anatomy. Vesalius's successors (Colombo, Fallopius, and Eustachius) further improved the accuracy of human anatomic detail. Thus, correction of Galen's anatomical inaccuracies (including the rete mirabilis at the base of the brain, the five lobed liver, and curved humerus) required at least 13 centuries for challenge, scientific disproof, and eventual medical community acceptance.",

By the 17th century, Galileo, Kepler, Newton, Harvey, and others had used this observation-based, matter-based, and mathematical law-based perspective to develop a scientific approach similar to our own modern approach of testing hypotheses with experimental data and statistics. In human biology, the investigation of structure led to studies of function, initially of human cardiovascular physiology, for example, Harvey's Anatomical Exercise Concerning the Motion of the Heart and Blood in Animals (1628). Whereas Galen conceived of parallel but unconnected arteries and veins, with continuous blood production in the liver and continuous blood consumption in the periphery, Harvey demonstrated that blood was pumped by the heart through arteries, through tissue capillaries, to veins, and then back to the heart in a circle (circulation).",

Thus, prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells, tissue architecture, and comparisons of normal and disease microanatomy were philosophical speculation until description of the mathematics of optics and lens design. In a real sense, optical technology was rate-limiting for the development of the fields of tissue anatomy, cellular biology, and microbiology. Concepts of optics were written as early as 300 BC in Alexandria (Optica, Euclid). Clear glass (crystallo) was developed in Venice in the 15th century. A compound microscope was invented by Janssen in 1590 AD. Microanatomy and structural terminology was begun by Malpighi (1661 AD), who examined capillaries in frog lung, trachea tubes for airflow in silkworms, and stomata in plant leaves. Robert Hooke used a compound microscope to describe common objects in Micrographia (1665 AD). Antony Van Leeuwenhoek used self-made simple magnifying lenses to count the threads in cloth in a Dutch dry-goods store, then later published descriptions of bacteria (termed animalcules), yeast, and algae, beginning in 1673 AD. Yet the relevance of these observations in microanatomy and microbiology to human diseases required changes in conceptual understanding of the etiology and pathogenesis of diseases. For example, it was 200 years after Van Leeuwenhoek that the common bacterium Streptococcus was recognized as the etiologic agent of puerperal fever in post-partum women.",

This concept (termed vitalism) was disproven by the in vitro synthesis of urea by F. Wohler in 1828 [13] . Work from this era initiated the field of organic chemistry. Predictable rules for in vitro and in vivo organic reactions, structural theory, modeling, separation technologies, and accurate measurement subsequently allowed the chemical description of natural products, and the chemical synthesis of both natural products and synthetic compounds. In addition to setting the stage for a systematic understanding of cellular biochemistry and physiology, organic chemistry set the stage for laboratory synthesis of natural products, such as dyes, vitamins, hormones, proteins, and nucleic acids. In that era, the textile industry was the main consumer of dyes. Access to imported natural product dyes from plants was predictable for seafaring nations, but not for landlocked nations. In parallel with natural product extraction and purification was the recognition that aniline from coal (Perkin, 1856) could be modified to generate a spectrum of colors, catalyzing the development of the German dye industry in the last half of the 19th century. Some of these synthetic dyes were found useful for histochemical staining.",

Metallic ion mordants made oxidized hematoxylin (hematein) colorfast in textiles, and a protocol for tissue staining was published by Boehmer in 1865. Similar to the hematoxylin story, semisynthetic analine dye technology was adapted by histochemists from 1850-1900. Many of these dyes are still routinely used for recognition of tissue structure, peripheral blood cells, and microorganisms, including hematoxylin, eosin, methylene blue, Ziehl-Neelsen, Gram, van Gieson, Mallory trichrome, and Congo red [14] .",

Similarly, tissue transplantation experiments led to the recognition of cellular rejection [15] due to thymus-derived T-cells. Antibodies and T-cells cooperate to react to foreign (non-self) molecules, common examples being allergic responses, viral infections, and organ transplants. Antibodies were found to be made by B-cells and plasma cells, and were found to be exquisitely specific for binding to their particular antigens (ligands) either in solid phase or in solution. The analogous T-cell receptor (TCR) recognizes a ligand made up of a 15-20mer peptide presented by self MHC (HLA in human) molecules on the surface of antigenpresenting cells (macrophages, dendritic cells, activated B-cells). B-and T-cells activate and proliferate when exposed to non-self proteins, but not to self proteins, attesting to tolerance to self. When B-and T-cell selftolerance breaks down, autoimmune diseases can result (including myasthenia gravis, Grave's disease, and lupus erythematosus). Antibodies (immunoglobulins) were found to be heterodimers of 50 kD heavy chains and 25 kD light chains, folded together so that a highly variable portion defines the antigen-binding site, and a constant portion defines the isotype (IgM, IgD, IgG, IgE, or IgA). Similarly, T-cell receptors were found to be heterodimers of immunoglobulin-like molecules with a highly variable portion for ligand binding, and a constant portion, but without different isotypes. The range of antigen-binding specificities in a normal mammal is extensive, perhaps infinite, subtracting out only those self proteins to which the animal is tolerant. The genes encoding immunoglobulins and T-cell receptors were sequenced and, surprisingly, the extensive variation of specificities was due to a unique system of gene rearrangements of polymorphic V, D, and J gene segments with random nucleotide addition at the junctions [16, 17] . This system allows generation of literally billions of different Ig and TCR binding specificities.",

Peroxidasetagged secondary antibodies and DAB chemistry were developed to generate a stable chromogen in the tissue, and this is now the primary method for detecting antigens in formalin-fixed tissue sections. Improved antibody binding specificity and industrial production required monoclonal antibodies, which required the development of mouse plasmacytomas/myelomas and cell fusion protocols [19] .

Dietary deficiency diseases prompted searches for the critical metabolic cofactors, so-called vital amines or vitamins. Xerophthalmia was linked to retinol (vitamin A) deficiency in 1917 (McCollum). Rickets was linked to calcitriol (vitamin D) deficiency in 1926. Beri-beri was linked to a deficiency of thiamine (vitamin B1) in 1926. Scurvy was linked to ascorbic acid (vitamin C) deficiency in 1927. Pellagra in the United States was linked to niacin deficiency in 1937. Pernicious anemia was linked to cobalamin (vitamin B12) deficiency in 1948. It is currently unusual to see morphologic features of these diseases in this country. Diseases due to nondietary physiologic imbalances prompted isolation of hormones. For example, hyperthyroidism and hypothyroidism were linked to thyroxine imbalances in 1915, and table salt was iodized starting in 1917. Diabetes mellitus was linked to insulin deficiency in 1921, nonhuman insulin was industrially purified and marketed soon thereafter, and recombinant human insulin was marketed in 1982.",

Clinical demand for body fluid levels of ions (such as sodium, potassium chloride, and bicarbonate), glucose, creatinine, hormones (such as thyroxine and parathyroid hormone), albumin, enzymes (related to liver and cardiac function), and antibodies (reactive to ASO, Rh, ABO, and HLA antigens) led to the development of clinical laboratories in chemistry, endocrinology, immunopathology, and blood banking. Functional assays for coagulation cascade status were developed, as were methods for estimating blood cell concentration and differential, leading to coagulation and hematology laboratories. Serologic and cell activation assays to define HLA haplotype led to HLA laboratories screening donors and recipients in anticipation of bone marrow and solid organ transplants. Culture medium-based screening for infectious agents led to dedicated clinical microbiology laboratories, which are beginning to incorporate nucleic acid screening technologies for speciation and prediction of treatment response. The clinical laboratories now play a critical, specialized role in inpatient and outpatient management, and their high test volumes (a 700bed hospital may perform 5 million tests per year) have catalyzed computer databases for central record-keeping of results.",

It turns out that the instruction set for protein sequence is defined by DNA sequence. The role of nucleoproteins as a genetic substance was alluded to by Miescher in 1871, and was shown by Avery to be the pneumococcal transforming principle in 1944. The discovery of X-ray crystallography in 1912 made it possible for Franklin, Wilkins, and Gosling to study DNA crystal structure [20, 21] , and led to the description of the antiparallel double helix of DNA by Watson and Crick in 1953 [22] . This seminal event in history facilitated dissection of the instruction set for an organism, with recognition that 3-base codons specified amino acids in 1961 [23] , and description of the particular codons encoding each amino acid in 1966 [24] . Demonstration of in situ hybridization in 1969 [25, 26] made it possible to localize specific DNA or RNA sequences within the cells of interest. Recognition and purification of restriction endonucleases and DNA ligases, and the development of cloning vectors, made it possible to clone individual sequences, leading to methods for synthesis of natural products (such as recombinant human insulin in 1978 [27] ). Chemical methods were developed for sequencing DNA [28, 29] , initially with radioisotope-tagged nucleotide detection in plate gels, then with fluorescent nucleotide detection in 1986 [30] . Subsequent conversion to capillary electrophoresis and computer scoring of sequence output allowed high throughput protocols which generated the human genome sequence by 2001 [31, 32] . The development of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) [33] made it possible to quickly screen for length polymorphisms (identity testing, donor:recipient ratio after bone marrow transplant, and microsatellite instability) and sequence abnormalities (translocations, rearrangements, insertions, deletions, substitutions) in a targeted fashion. Quantitative PCR methods using fluorescent detection of amplicons made it possible to study DNA and RNA copy number, and to mimic Northern blots/oligo microarrays in estimating RNA transcript abundance for cluster analysis.",

Traditionally, the absorption of electromagnetic waves by tissues led to summation differences in exposure of silver salt photographic film. Tomographic approaches such as CT (1972) and NMR (1973) complemented summation radiology, allowing finely detailed visualization of internal anatomy in any plane of section. In the same era, ultrasound allowed visualization of tissue with density differences, such as a developing fetus or gallbladder stones. More recently, physiology of neoplasms can be screened with positron emission tomography (PET, 1977) for decay of short half-life isotopes such as fluorodeoxyglucose. Neoplasms with high metabolism can be distinguished physiologically from adjacent low-metabolism tissues, and can be localized with respect to normal tissues by pairing PET with standard CT. The result is an astonishingly useful means of identifying and localizing new space-occupying masses, assigning a risk for malignant behavior and, if malignant, screening for metastases in distant sites. This technique is revolutionizing the preoperative decision making of clinical teams, and improves the likelihood that patients undergo resections of new mass lesions only when at risk for morbidity from malignant behavior or interference with normal function.",

Multivolume texts are devoted to the gross and microscopic diagnostic criteria used for diagnosis, prognosis, and prediction of response to therapy [1, 34, 35] . Pathologists diagnose disease by generating a differential diagnosis, then finding the best fit for the clinical presentation, the radiographic appearance, and the pathologic (both clinical lab and morphologic) findings. Logically, the Venn diagram of the clinical, radiologic, and pathologic differential diagnoses should overlap. Unexpected features expand the differential diagnosis and may raise the possibility of previously undescribed diseases. For example, Legionnaire's disease, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), Hantavirus pneumonia, and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) are examples of newly described diagnoses during the last 30 years. The mental construct of etiology (cause), pathogenesis (progression), natural history (clinical outcome), and response to therapy is the standard approach for pathologists thinking about a disease. A disease may have one or more etiologies (initial causes, including agents, toxins, mutagens, drugs, allergens, trauma, or genetic mutations). A disease is expected to follow a particular series of events in its development (pathogenesis), and to follow a particular clinical course (natural history). Disease can result in a temporary or lasting change in normal function, including patient death. Multiple diseases of different etiologies can affect a single organ, for example, infectious and neoplastic diseases involving the lung. Different diseases can derive from a single etiology, for example, emphysema, chronic bronchitis, and small cell lung carcinoma in long-term smokers. The same disease (for instance, emphysema of the lung) can derive from different etiologies (emphysema from a-1-antitrypsin deficiency or cigarette smoke).",

For example, certain diseases such as squamous and small cell carcinomas of the lung are extremely rare in nonsmokers.

First, lineage of certain classes of neoplasms (including small round blue cell tumors, clear cell neoplasms, spindle cell neoplasms, and undifferentiated malignant neoplasms) is usually clarified by immunohistochemistry, frequently by cytogenetics (when performed), and sometimes by electron microscopy. Second, there are limitations inherent in a snapshot biopsy or resection. Thus, the etiology and pathogenesis can be obscure or indeterminate, and rates of growth, invasion, or timing of metastasis cannot be inferred. Third, the morphologic changes may not be specific for the underlying molecular abnormalities, particularly the rate-limiting (therapeutic target) step in the pathogenesis of a neoplasm. For example, Ret gain of function mutations in a medullary thyroid carcinoma will require DNA level screening to determine germline involvement, familial risk, and presence or absence of a therapeutic target. Fourth, the same morphologic appearance may be identical for two different diseases, each of which would be treated differently. For example, there is no morphologic evidence by H&E stain alone to distinguish host lymphoid response to Hepatitis C viral (HCV) antigens from host lymphoid response to allo-HLA antigens in a liver allograft. This is obviously a major diagnostic challenge when the transplant was done for HCV-related cirrhosis, and the probability of recurrent HCV infection in the liver allograft is high.",

            "text": "Paraffin section immunohistochemistry has proven invaluable in neoplasm diagnosis for clarifying lineage, improving diagnostic accuracy, and guiding customized therapy. If neoplasms are poorly differentiated or undifferentiated, the lineage of the neoplasm may not be clear. For example, sheets of undifferentiated malignant neoplasm with prominent nucleoli could represent carcinoma, lymphoma, or melanoma. To clarify lineage, a panel of immunostains is performed for proteins that are expressed in some of the neoplasms, but not in others. Relative probabilities are then used to lend support (rule in) or exclude (rule out) particular diagnoses in the differential diagnosis of these several morphologically similar undifferentiated neoplasms. The second role is to make critical distinctions in diagnosis that cannot be accurately made by H&E alone. Examples of this would include demonstration of myoepithelial cell loss in invasive breast carcinoma but not in its mimic, sclerosing adenosis ( Figure 11 .2), or loss of basal cells in invasive prostate carcinoma (Figure 11 .3). The third role of immunohistochemistry is to identify particular proteins, such as nuclear estrogen receptor (ER) (Figure 11 .4) or the plasma membrane HER2 proteins ( Figure 11 .5), both of which can be targeted with inhibitors rather than generalized systemic chemotherapy. Morphology remains the gold standard in this diagnostic process, such that immunohistochemical data support or fail to support the H&E findings, not vice versa. Probability and statistics are regular considerations in immunohistochemical interpretation, since very few antigens are tissue-specific or lineage-specific. Cytokeratin is positive in carcinomas, but also in synovial and epithelioid sarcomas. This example may imply aspects of the lineage of these two sarcomas that may be helpful in our categorization of these neoplasms. Another example would be the diagnosis of small cell carcinoma in the lung of a nonsmoker. Because lung primary small cell carcinoma is extremely uncommon, in non-smokers, this diagnosis would prompt the pathologist to inquire about screening results for other, nonpulmonary, sites. Likewise, immunohistochemistry results are always put into the context of the morphologic, clinical, and radiographic findings. For example, an undifferentiated CD30(\u00fe) neoplasm of the testis supports embryonal carcinoma primary in the testis, whereas a lymph node effaced by sclerotic bands with admixed CD30(\u00fe) Reed-Sternberg cells supports nodular sclerosing Hodgkin's disease.",

Multidisciplinary conferences function almost real-time with respect to the initial biopsies. Together, these changes have forced modern pathologists to make critical diagnoses on progressively smaller biopsy specimens, sometimes bordering on the amounts seen in cytopathology aspirates, and to do this in a timely fashion.

Current approaches to these neoplasms are now generally approached using paraffin section immunohistochemistry. Electron microscopy is currently used mainly for nephropathology, for evaluation of ciliary axonemes, for rare cases where immunohistochemistry is not diagnostic, and where demonstration of premelanosomes, neuroendocrine granules, or amyloid is diagnostic. Adequate sampling of a lesion is critical to making an accurate diagnosis. Undercall diagnostic discrepancies are frequently due to sampling of a small portion of a large lesion that is unrepresentative of the most abnormal portion of the lesion. Insufficient sampling can result in an equivocal diagnosis or, worse, an inaccurate diagnosis.
