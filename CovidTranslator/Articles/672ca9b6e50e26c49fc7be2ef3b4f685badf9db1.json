Daily intercity migration data for 367 cities in China are collected from Baidu Migration, a mobile-app based human migration tracking data system. Historical data of infected, recovered and death cases from official source are used for model fitting. The set of model parameters obtained from best data fitting using a constrained nonlinear optimization procedure is used for estimation of the dynamics of epidemic spreading in the coming weeks. Our results show that the number of infections in most cities in China will peak between mid February to early March 2020, with about 0.8%, less than 0.1% and less than 0.01% of the population eventually infected in Wuhan, Hubei Province and the rest of China, respectively.",

            "text": "The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) (known earlier as New Coronavirus Infected Pneumonia) began to spread since December 2019 from Wuhan, which has been widely regarded as the epicenter of the epidemic, to almost all provinces throughout China and 28 other countries. Human-to-human transmission had been found to occur in some early Wuhan cases in mid December [1] , and the high volume and frequency of movement of people from Wuhan to other cities and between cities is thus an obvious cause for the wide and rapid spread of the disease throughout the country. The Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Removed (SEIR) model has traditionally been used to study epidemic spreading with various forms of networks of transmission which define the contact topology [2] , such as scalefree networks [3, 4, 5] , small-world networks [6, 7] , Oregon graph [8, 9] , and adaptive networks [10] . Moreover, in most studies, the contact process assumes that the contagion expands at a certain rate from an infected individual to his/her neighbor, and that the spreading process takes place in a single population (network). The COVID-19 outbreak, however, began to occur and escalate in a special holiday period in China (about 20 days surrounding the Lunar New Year), during which a huge volume of intercity travel took place, resulting in outbreaks in multiple regions connected by an active transportation network. Thus, in order to understand the COVID-19 spreading process in China, it is essential to examine the human migration dynamics, especially between the epicenter Wuhan and other Chinese cities. A recent study has also revealed the risk of transmission of the virus from Wuhan to other cities [11] .",

To demonstrate the impact of intercity traffic on the COVID-19 epidemic spreading, we plot in Figure 1 the number of infected individuals in different cities versus the inflow traffic volume from Wuhan, which clearly shows that for cities farther away from Wuhan, the number of infected individuals almost increases linearly with the inflow traffic from Wuhan. In view of the importance of human migration dynamics to the disease spreading process, we combine, in this study, intercity travel data collected from Baidu Migration [12] with the traditional SEIR model [2] to build a new dynamic model for the spreading of COVID-19 in China. Using official historical data of infected, recovered and death cases in 367 cities, we perform fitting of the data to estimate the best set of model parameters, which are then used to estimate the number of individuals exposed to the virus in each city and to predict the extent of spreading in the coming months. Our study shows that the number of infected cases in various Chinese cities will peak between mid February to early March 2020, with about 0.8%, less than 0.1% and less than 0.01% of the population eventually infected in Wuhan, Hubei Province, and the rest of China, respectively.",

The period (around 20 days) surrounding the Lunar New Year (mid January to early February in 2020) is the most important holiday period in China. Migrant workers and students travel from major cities to country towns for family reunions, and return to the cities at the end of the holiday period. Holiday goers also travel to and from tourist cities. China's Ministry of Transport estimates around 3 billion trips to be taken during this period. Wuhan, being a major transport hub and having a large number of higher education institutions as well as manufacturing plants, is among the cities with the largest outflow and inflow traffic before and after the Chinese New Year festival. Our study aims to incorporate these important human migration dynamics in the construction of the spreading model. We collect daily intercity travel data in China from Baidu Migration, which is a mobile-app based big data system recording movements of mobile phone users. Specifically, we have collected Baidu Migration data for 367 cities (or administrative regions) in China over the period of January 1, 2020, to February 13, 2020. The data provide the migration strengths of cities which are indicative measures of the human traffic volume moving in and out of individual cities and administrative regions, as depicted by the inflow and outflow networks shown in Figure 3 (a).",

In view of this special migration factor, the SEIR model should incorporate the human migration dynamics in order to capture the essential features of the dynamics of the spreading. In particular, for city i, in addition to the abovementioned classic interpretation, the daily increase in the number of infected cases should also include the inflow of infected individuals from other cities, less the outflow of removed cases from city i. In reality, inflow and outflow of exposed individuals to and from the city are also important and to be estimated in the model.

Data fitting for all 367 cities are performed. Values are updated iteratively in the optimization process. Moreover, since all parameters, like infection rates, are to be generated by fitting data with the model, the integrity of the data becomes crucial. As the official Wuhan data are expected to deviate from the true values quite significantly during the early outbreak stage due to uncertainty in diagnosis and other issues related to reporting of the epidemic by the local government, we have allowed the fitting errors for Wuhan to expand over a reasonable range, while the fitting errors for most other cities remain small. In addition, as the epidemic propagates in time, effective control measures and improved public education would reduce the infection rates for the susceptible and exposed individuals, making these parameters time varying in reality.

This is because stringent measures have been taken to limit travel and hence to curb the spreading of the virus since late January 2020. The infection rates should be progressively reduced, with the effect of reducing the number of infected individuals as well as mitigating of the peak times. Furthermore, climate factors may also play a role in the epidemic spreading. As temperature generally rises from February to May, the infection peaks would unlikely occur later than the predicted times as the new coronavirus epidemic is generally known to subside in warm weather. Based on our findings and assuming no drastic change in infection rates (e.g., schools and workplaces remain closed and intercity travel limited), we can conclude, with optimism, that the COVID-19 epidemic would end around April 2020.",

Our model for the disease spreading is essentially the classic SEIR model, with intercity travel data supplying the essential information about the number of infected, exposed and recovered individuals moving between different cities. All parameters of the model, including infection rates, recovery rates, and eventual percentage of infected population for 367 cities in China, are identified by fitting the official data with the model using a constrained nonlinear programming procedure. Using these parameters, estimates of the number of exposed individuals in 367 cities as well as projections into the next 200 days are also found. Our model, however, does not consider the contact network topology that would be necessary if details of the transmission process, such as superspreading events, are to be captured. Nonetheless, our model provides a very reasonable estimation of the propagation of average numbers of exposed, infected and recovered individuals, despite missing details of fluctuation (e.g., sudden surge due to a superspreading event). The main conclusion of our study is that the COVID-19 epidemic spreading will peak between mid February to early March 2020, with about 0.8%, less than 0.1% and less than 0.01% of the population eventually infected in Wuhan, Hubei Province and the rest of China, respectively.",
