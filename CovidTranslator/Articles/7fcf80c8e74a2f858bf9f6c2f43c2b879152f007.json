To protect the confidentiality of hospitals, researchers compiled a list of the 100 hospitals and directly e-mailed the directors of each infection control unit, inviting them to respond to the Web-based survey. To increase survey response rates, repeat contact by weekly e-mail was made over 4 weeks. Only 1 person in each institution participated in the survey.

It is a well-known fact from the outbreak of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus in the ROK that multibed rooms enable the spread of infectious diseases, and this represents part of the chronic problems of the Korean health care system. 8 In this study, the median number of single rooms in each hospital was 5 (range, 0-63). Patients with known or suspected infectious diseases acquired by contact or droplet routes or airborne droplet nuclei should be physically isolated from other patients. 9 The use of single-room isolation with adherence to the requirements of isolation can be a cornerstone in the prevention and control of MDROs in hospitals. 10 However, this practice is a challenge in the ROK where hospitals are largely organized in multibed rooms, with insufficient numbers of single rooms. A health care organization that is planning to expand its facility may now consider the need for single rooms. In 1999, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's National Nosocomial Infections Surveillance System recommended 1 full-time ICN per 100 hospital beds and 1 full-time ICN for each additional 250 beds. 1, 11 Actually, the average number of infection control professionals per 100 beds was 1.2 in U.S. hospitals enrolled in the National Health and Safety Network and 0.8 in Canadian acute care hospitals. 12, 13 Although infection prevention and control policies have largely improved the medical environmental on infection prevention and control, changes in the use of specialized personnel for infection prevention and control fell short of recommendations. For example, the ratio of the number of beds to ICNs in the ROK (1 fulltime ICN per 400.3 \u00b1 154.1 beds) was lower than in other countries with established infection prevention and control programs. [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] Our study found a wide variation in the training and experience of ICNs. To date, there is no formal certification process to assess the practice of ICNs and ensure a minimum level of competence. The Korean Society for Healthcare-associated Infection Control and Prevention has recently attempted to provide a formal educational process for the updated practice for infection prevention and control. Promoting the training and appointment of specialist personnel to support and expand infection prevention and control programs should be the ongoing focus of effective policy-oriented management. The buildup of a highly qualified workforce should be based on the political support of continuous human resource development.",

It is likely that the emergence of carbapenem-resistant organisms will result in changes in the choice of organisms for active surveillance cultures. However, facilities have great diversity in their approach to preventing gram-negative MDROs. The definitions of multidrug resistance and the criteria of isolation were not even unified, compared with those for gram-positive MDROs. 20 On the other hand, the centralized management of the increase in MDROs can be temporarily effective, under conditions of finite resources. However, a comprehensive and multifaceted approach simultaneously covering the various MDROs should be designed to minimize opportunity costs. 21 Over the last 5 years, the newly implemented Infectious Disease Control and Prevention Act and the hospital accreditation have resulted in substantial investment in infection prevention and control by hospitals throughout the ROK. However, the current fee-forservice payment system in the ROK does not offer reasonable incentives for infection prevention and control programs. Reflecting on the current state of the health care system, our study found a shortage of skilled workforce and inferior facilities for handwashing and a shortage of single rooms in relatively scaled-down hospitals. The lack of financial incentives for these activities potentially limits quantitative and qualitative improvement in infection prevention and control programs. A reasonable medical insurance fee should be established based on the multidisciplinary approach for effective execution of ideal infection prevention and control programs.",

On average, the ICNs had 63.5 months of experience in infection prevention and control (IQR, 28-87; range, 15-141). Of the responding hospitals, 85.4% and 80.5% employed a specialist in infectious disease and clinical microbiology, respectively.

Three facilities (7.3%) have complied with the regulation of infection prevention and control since the introduction of legislation. Five hospitals (12.2%) employed a full-time ICP. Thirteen hospitals (31.7%) introduced the use of disposable tissue towels, and 3 hospitals (7.3%) introduced hand sanitizers and disinfectants. Twenty-three facilities (51.6%) introduced a monitoring and feedback program for hand hygiene in 2010, and 15 hospitals (36.6%) commenced regular education seminars for MDRO infection prevention and control. A significant increase was observed between 2009 and 2014 in the median number of personnel specialized in infection control within each hospital (1.6 \u00b1 1.2 vs 2.4 \u00b1 1.9, P = .011). Between 2009 and 2014, monitoring of the prevalence of MRSA (57.4% vs 42.6%, P = .118) and VRE (60.0% vs 40.0%, P = .024) and active surveillance for carriers of MRSA (66.7% vs 33.3%, P = .022)",
