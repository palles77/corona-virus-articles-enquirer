A sample of 279 Chinese female nurses completed questionnaires in a two-wave longitudinal survey. With a cross-lagged analysis, the results indicated that family mastery at Time 1 had a significant positive effect on work engagement at Time 2. Furthermore, the relationship between family mastery and work engagement was stronger in a context of high (vs. low) job demand. These findings suggested that resource generated in family could directly help people stay engaged in the workplace, particularly under stressful working conditions. Our findings have expanded the JD-R model of work engagement and bridged it with theory of work-family enrichment. Implications for theory and practices are discussed.",

In the job demands-resources (JD-R) model of work engagement (Bakker & Demerouti, 2008) , it is assumed that job resources have motivational potential and are positive predictors of work engagement. Recent trend in work-family balance literature has suggested that resources generated in family domain could also promote role involvement and performance in work domain (outcome of work engagement), such process is conceptualized as family-to-work enrichment (Greenhaus & Powell, 2006) . Furthermore, according to the JD-R model , 2008 , resources gain their salience when individuals are facing high job demands. Family mastery is certainly a highly valued personal resource that is generated from family domain (e.g. Hobfoll, 1989) . We thus intended to explore family-to-work enrichment process by examining the impact of family mastery on work engagement when individuals have to deal with high job demands. The results of the study would contribute to Western organizational theories by bridging research in work-family balance and the JD-R model.",

A recent study by Lu, Siu, Spector, and Shi (2009) found that experiences in family (new parental experiences, spouse support) had significant positive effects on the facilitation component of work-family balance. Yet Lu's et al. study was limited by its cross-sectional data and small sample size. Work-family research has long been criticized for an overreliance on cross-sectional data (Barnett, 1998; Casper, Eby, Bordeaux, Lockwood, & Burnett, 2007; Greenhaus & Parasuraman, 1999; Zedeck, 1992) . Thus our study also contributed to this literature by adopting a longitudinal design. Specifically, we conducted a cross-lagged panel analysis to further probe the causal relation between family mastery and work engagement in China, which would offer a significant contribution to the validation and generalization of Western theories.",

We believe engaged nurses have vigor, absorption and dedication to their work activities and be able to deal with demands at work more effectively (Bakker & Demerouti, 2008) . Understanding nurse engagement is therefore an important prioritized research agenda (Simpson, 2008) . More importantly, female nurses are more prone to work-family interface issues (Byron, 2005) . Rothbard (2001) study also supported that enrichment from family to work only applicable for females rather than males.

Work-family conflict can result in adverse health and performance outcomes for individuals, families and organizations (Allen, Herst, Bruck, & Sutton, 2000; Bruck, Allen, & Spector, 2002) . With the emerging trend in psychology emphasizing the positive subjective experiences and individual traits which promise the quality of life (e.g. Seligman, Rashid, & Parks, 2006) , there is a growing consensus for an expansion of the work-family paradigm to include the positive outcomes of the work-family interface. For instance, the positive spillover theory postulates that attitude, behaviors, and emotions associated with one role may spill over to another positively (Edwards & Rothbard, 2000) . Positive experiences (e.g. affect, development, capital) in one domain (e.g. family) are transferred to another domain (Carlson, Kacmar, Wayne, & Grzywacz, 2006) . The positive aspect of work-family interface has been exemplified in terms such as facilitation (Frone, 2003) , enhancement (Greenhaus & Parasuraman, 1999) , and enrichment (Rothbard, 2001) . A close scrutiny of these terms reveals considerable content overlap although subtle differences remain (Grzywacz, 2002) . In an effort to synchronize these researches, Greenhaus and Powell (2006) suggested that work-family enrichment could best capture the process that had often been discussed and examined. They defined work-family enrichment as \"the extent to which experiences in one role improve the quality of life in the other role\" (p.73). Specifically, Greenhaus and Powell (2006) proposed that skills and perspectives, psychological and physical resources, social-capital resources, flexibility and material resources generated in family/work role could directly promote high performance in work/family role. Work-to-family enrichment occurs when work experiences improve the quality of family life, and family-to-work enrichment occurs when family experiences improve the quality of work life. Furthermore, in their model of work-family enrichment, two mechanisms or paths were proposed to explain how a resource generated in one role can promote high performance and positive affect in another role. One is instrumental path, which refers to a resource generated in one role can be transferred directly to enhance another role performance. Another is affective path, which captures the process of positive affect between two roles, resulting in role performance enhancement and positive affect experiences consequently. Nevertheless, studies on family-to-work enrichment process are far less than work-to-family enrichment process in the research literature.",

Mastery or the sense of mastery refers to \"the extent to which one regards one's life chances as being under one's own control in contrast to being fatalistically ruled\" (Pearlin & Schooler, 1978, p.5) . Mastery has been recognized as an important psychological resource (e.g. Frone, Russell, & Cooper, 1991; Hobfoll, 1989) , and could be treated as a multifaceted resource that is specific to a given domain or role (e.g., Lawton, Kleban, Moss, Rovine, & Glicksman, 1989). Hence, the degree to which mastery is attributed to oneself varies by domain of behavioral competence. Family mastery concerns the extent to which individuals control their families' lives (Pearlin & Schooler, 1978) . Extant research has demonstrated that mastery has both direct and moderation effect to protect individuals from stressful experiences. For example, Christensen, Stephens, and Townsend (1998) provided the evidence that mastery in women's family roles (parent care, mother and wife) was strongly related to psychological well-being. Miller, Campbell, Farran, and Kaufman (1995) found that mastery in caregivers of persons with dementia was not only negatively related to role strain and depression but also buffered the effects of stressors on depression.",

Dedication refers to being strongly involved in one's work, and experiencing a sense of significance, enthusiasm, inspiration, pride and challenge. Finally, absorption indicates that one is fully concentrated and happily engrossed in one's work, whereby time passes quickly. Employees with high work engagement feel a strong identity with their work, and they perceive their work as meaningful, inspirational and challenging, thus they tend to apply knowledge, and utilize skills and resources to a greater extent at work (Bakker & Demerouti, 2008; Bakker, Schaufeli, Leiter, & Taris, 2008) . It has been argued that engaged workers perform better (Demerouti & Cropanzano, 2010) , experience positive emotions (Wright & Cropanzano, 2000) and report better health (Schaufeli & Bakker, 2004) , and hence create more job and personal resources (Xanthopoulou, Bakker, Demerouti, & Schaufeli, 2009 ), which would fuel future work engagement.",

Hence, Jones, Burke, and Westman (2006) advocated more research into what the individual can do to actively involve family life so as to facilitate recovery from work.

Hobfoll (1989) suggested that in order to develop and gain more resources, people would employ resources that they possess or call on resources which are available to them from their environment. A sense of mastery of family life would make people experience more positive affect such as positive mood, satisfaction with family roles, and psychological well-being (Christensen et al., 1998) . All these positive psychological experiences (also kind of resources) could be employed by the individuals to help them stay highly engaged in their work, and thus develop more job and personal resources for them (Xanthopoulou et al., 2009 ). In addition, individuals with high family mastery would have more and better recovery experiences at home. Thus, they are more energetic in the workplace than those who do not master situations at home. Therefore we anticipate, Hypothesis 1. Family mastery at Time 1 will be positively related to work engagement at Time 2.",

            "text": "One of the central assumptions in the JD-R model of work engagement is that gaining resources becomes more imperative, and takes up their motivational effects when individuals face high job demands (Bakker & Demerouti, 2008) . There has been evidence supporting this assumption. For example, Bakker, Hakanen, Demerouti, and Xanthopoulou (2007) found that job resources (appreciation, organizational climate, innovativeness) had a stronger relationship with work engagement when teachers are exposed to profound pupil misbehavior. Yet, as far as we know, there is little empirical evidence that supports whether family resources can also gain their salience to help people engage in their work when they face high job demands. Greenhaus and Powell (2006) proposed that, resources generated in Role A (e.g., family) were more likely to directly promote high quality life in Role B (e.g., work) when the resources were perceived to be relevant to Role B than when they were not relevant. Based on this proposition, we can infer that when people face a high job demand (a stressful work condition), they are more likely to seek help and support from family members. Thus family resources would be more relevant to them at work, and then can have a stronger impact on improving the quality of their work life. Family mastery is certainly a highly valued personal resource generated in family role (e.g. Hobfoll, 1989) , which is beneficial for an individual to perform work role. Accordingly, by combining Greenhaus and Powell (2006) proposition and the JD-R model of work engagement (Bakker & Demerouti, 2008) , we can infer that family mastery will have a strong positive effect on work engagement when individuals have to deal with a high job demand. Thus we suggest, Hypothesis 2. Family mastery will have a stronger relationship with work engagement when job demand is high than when job demand is low.",

The surveys were administered twice to a sample of female nurses drawn from a hospital in Guangzhou, with a 6-month time interval. The span of 6 months was to provide ample separation between our measures while not spacing surveys so far apart as to unnecessarily increase participant attrition. Before administering the survey, the researcher explained the purpose of the project and asked for their consent to participate. The anonymity of their answers was assured. Participants were asked to write a self-identifiable coding (mother's surname plus month/year of her own birth), which was needed to match the second wave responses. During the first wave of the survey (Time 1), 1100 nurses were distributed the questionnaires, 990 (90%) returned completed questionnaires. The same procedure was followed for the second wave of the survey (Time 2), all employees (N = 1016) in Time 1 (T1) were invited again to participate. For the Time 2 survey (T2), 808 (80% response rate) questionnaires were returned. By checking the self-identifiable coding, we got only 279 matched sample who both took part in T1 (28%) and T2 (35%). The low matched rate may be due to the fact that some participants forgot their codes created in T1 or they did not create their codes in T1 or T2. Furthermore, there are not many varieties of surnames in Chinese; hence there were many coincidences of codes in the sample that made it difficult for us to identify the matched ones.",

Prior to the cross-lagged analyses, we examined a series of measurement models to support the discriminant validity between family mastery and work engagement. Specifically, we compared the hypothesized four-factor model (family mastery, work engagement, at both T1 and T2 respectively) with a one-factor model (in which all indicators were constrained to load on a single factor), two different two-factor models, one of which made a distinction between family mastery and work engagement (irrespective of time of measure), and the other reflecting time of measurement (T1 measured loading on one factor and T2 measured loading on the other). In addition, we also specified two different three-factor models, one of which combined the T1 and T2 measures of family mastery, and the other combined the T1 and T2 measures of work engagement. Following Cole and Maxwell (2003) , in test of the measurement models we allowed the error terms for the corresponding latent variable indicators to be correlated and constrained the factor loadings to be equal across time for testing the measure equivalence. In order to reduce the number of parameters and thereby improve the sample size-to-estimator ratio, parceling procedure was employed for SEM (Marsh, Hau, Balla, & Grayson, 1998) .",

The results showed that the four-factor model, in which factor loadings were constrained to be equal and the error terms for the corresponding latent variable indicators were allowed to be correlated over time, provided a substantially better fit to data as compared to the models specifying one, two, or three factors.

Moreover, the path between work engagement at Time1 and family mastery at Time 2 in M recipr and M revers was not significant, which indicated that work engagement did not have a reversed cross-lagged effect on family mastery. Family mastery at T1 had a positive cross-lagged effect on work engagement at T2 (\u03b2 = .16, p b .05) as expected after the autoregressive effects were controlled (see Fig. 1 ).

Our results also support this model and have further demonstrated that work engagement might act a critical and significant mediating role in the family-to-work enrichment process. As mentioned earlier, research on antecedents of family-to-work enrichment is needed but they are relatively less found in the work-family literature (Jones et al., 2006; Kofodimos, 1993) . Our study has therefore filled this gap of knowledge and contributed to Western theories in work-family literature.

            "text": "Some limitations of this study should be noted. First, as the sample only included females, we have no idea whether the present results exist for males. Previous limited research on gender differences in family-to-work enrichment (Kirchmeyer, 1993; Rothbard, 2001) has produced inconsistent results. We recommend further investigation of the role of gender in family-to-work enrichment process. Second, the study was based on self-reports that may raise questions of common-method bias (e.g., Podsakoff, MacKenzie, Lee, & Podsakoff, 2003) . However, the longitudinal design overcomes some of the problems because previous levels of the variables are controlled for to a certain degree. Also, the results of confirmatory factor analyses showed that all variables could be empirically distinguished within and across waves. Another potential limitation of the present research findings concerns the issue of causal inferences. It is acknowledged that causality requires not only that variables are found to be associated, but also the isolation of these variables from other potential sources of influence (Bollen, 1989) . However, although our results yielded no significant difference in marital status, we did not control any other individual difference variables that may potentially influence the relation between family mastery and work engagement, such as general self-efficacy and optimism (Xanthopoulou et al., 2009) . Hence, our findings do not allow conclusions about absolute causality. Nevertheless, by comparing the proposed model with a number of alternative models, our results provide evidence that the assumption of a causal effect of family mastery on work engagement is at least plausible. Lastly, the matching rate of samples was low. Future research should adopt other method for creating a personal code to avoid overlap. Furthermore, future research can replicate our study to other Chinese or Western societies with different occupational groups.",
