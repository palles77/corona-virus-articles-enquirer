            "text": "Sterile plain plastic tubes without ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) for CSF collection are generally recommended because leukocytes can adhere to glass, clotting is rare, and EDTA may falsely elevate the protein concentration of CSF . Some prefer to routinely collect into EDTA tubes to avoid clotting secondary to extensive blood contamination (Carmichael, 1998) . However, such samples probably have limited diagnostic utility. If measurement of glucose is the primary objective, CSF should be collected into fluoride/ oxalate, although this may be necessary if CSF contains few erythrocytes and is analyzed rapidly. Carmichael (1998) indicated that approximately 1 mL of CSF per 5 kg of body weight can be collected safely. It may be dangerous to remove more than 1 mL of CSF per 30 seconds, more than 4 to 5 mL of CSF from the dog, more than 0.5 to 1 mL of CSF from the adult cat, or more than 10 to 20 drops of CSF from the kitten. Rand et al (1990) indicated that 1.0 to 1.5 mL of CSF can usually be collected from the cat to avoid meningeal hemorrhage if too much fluid is withdrawn.",

The nose should be held or propped so that its long axis is parallel to the table and it should not be allowed to rotate in either direction. The point of insertion is located on the midline approximately halfway between the external occipital protuberance and the craniodorsal tip of the dorsal spine of C2 (axis) and just rostral to the anterior margins of the wings of C1 (atlas). The needle is inserted at the intersection of a line connecting the anterior borders of the wings of the atlas and a line drawn from the occipital crest to the dorsal border of the axis along the midline. Puncture of the skin first with an 18-gauge needle or a scalpel blade is helpful in overcoming skin resistance in thick-skinned animals and preventing contamination with skin cells/detritus. Alternatively, the skin can be pinched and lifted so that the needle can be safely pushed through the skin with a twisting motion.",

Attachment of a syringe to the needle with aspiration of CSF is not recommended because suction may result in contamination with blood or meningeal cells or obstruction of CSF flow by aspirated meningeal trabeculae. Rarely, aspiration is necessary and should be only done by the experienced collector. Passage of the needle through the spinal cord to underlying bone should be avoided at the cerebellomedullary cistern because it may cause damage to the cord and/or cause blood contamination of the CSF sample.

Sometimes no fluid or only a very small amount of fluid is obtained owing to the small size of the lumbar subarachnoid space. Lumbar puncture may be preferred in cases with localized spinal disease because it may be more likely to confirm abnormality than cerebellomedullary cistern collections (Thomson et al., 1990) .",

Misdirection laterally into the paralumbar muscles or underestimation of the length of needle required might result in advancement of the needle to the hub without encountering bone. CSF may be collected from the dorsal subarachnoid space, or the needle may be passed through the nervous structures to the floor of the spinal canal and CSF collected from the ventral subarachnoid space.

The likelihood of misinterpretation due to sample deterioration depends on the initial protein concentration of the sample and how long the analysis is delayed. For example, if the CSF protein concentration is more than 50 mg/dL, a delay in analysis of less than 12 hours is unlikely to alter final interpretation. Addition of an equal volume of 4% to 10% neutral buffered formalin or 50% to 90% alcohol, depending on availability, is recommended for fixation of specimens that cannot be immediately delivered to a laboratory and processed immediately (Carmichael, 1998) . Alternatively, the addition of one drop of 10% formalin to 1 to 2 mL of CSF can be used to preserve cells for cell counts and morphologic examination when submitted to a referral laboratory; cell count will be different from unfixed, but the difference is clinically insignificant. Refrigeration will help retard cellular degeneration. Cellular stability can be increased by addition of fresh, frozen, or thawed serum or plasma (Bienzle et al., 2000) or by addition of 20% albumin (Fenner, 2000) . If a CSF sample is not analyzed within 1 hour from collection, Fry et al (2006) recommend dividing the fluid into two aliquots, an unadulterated aliquot for total nucleated cell count (TNCC) and protein measurement and an aliquot added with 20% of fetal calf serum (or 10% autologous serum) for differential cell count and morphologic evaluation. For those samples of insufficient volume (less than 0.5 mL total), hetastarch can be added to CSF for routine assays. In the last situation, the dilutional effect of adding a stabilizing agent must be taken into account when calculating results. Hetastarch comes ready to use as 6% hydroxyethyl starch in 0.9% NaCl solution and is then added to CSF 1:1 (vol/vol). Protein and enzyme concentrations in CSF are relatively stable during transit by routine pick-up, overnight postal, and courier delivery (Carmichael, 1998) . Analyses other than cell counts and cell differentials are best performed on the unadulterated aliquot to ensure no interference.",

However, in a study (Hurtt and Smith, 1997) of iatrogenic blood contamination effects of total protein and nucleated cell counts in CSF, the erythrocyte count was not significantly correlated with nucleated cell count or protein concentration in CSF from clinically normal dogs or those with neurologic disease. The study concluded that high CSF nucleated cell counts and protein concentrations indicate neurologic disease, even if samples contain erythrocytes up to 13,200/\u03bcL. Protein concentration, neutrophil percentage, and the presence of eosinophils have been reported to be significantly affected by blood contamination in canine CSF having low TNCC (less than or equal to 5/mL) and interfere with the use of these parameters for assessing CNS changes (Doyle and Solano-Gallego, 2009 ). The presence of vacuolated basophilic macrophages and reactive lymphocytes, however, is not significantly affected by blood contamination, and therefore it may be useful in identifying dogs with CNS abnormalities even when CSF has a low TNCC.",

Special analytic techniques most often available at commercial or reference laboratories and not available in practice are needed owing to the minute protein concentration in CSF. Due to the minute amounts present, CSF protein analysis may be referred to as \"microprotein. \" An estimate of CSF protein content can be obtained using urine dipsticks.

The IgG index is equal to the (CSF IgG/serum IgG) divided by (CSF albumin/ serum albumin). An IgG index greater than 0.272 with a normal AQ suggests intrathecal production of IgG.

However, changes in CSF glucose concentration in serum or plasma are not immediately reflected in CSF and may take 1 to 3 hours before they are apparent in CSF (Cook and DeNicola, 1988) . The ratio between blood glucose and CSF glucose is frequently reduced in bacterial infections of the CNS in humans and has been reported to occur in some cases of pyogenic infections of the CNS, CSF hemorrhage, or blood contamination that may result in increased utilization of glucose by cells. However, the relationship between bacterial encephalitis and decreased CSF glucose compared with serum or plasma glucose may depend on multiple factors, including the blood glucose level, degree of permeability of the blood-brain barrier, and presence or absence of glycolytic cells or microorganisms. Fenner (2000) stated that the reduction in glucose does not occur in dogs. Significant reductions in CSF glucose concentrations have been reported in human malignant disorders involving the leptomeninges, and it is considered a relatively specific finding for this condition (Chamberlain, 1995) .",

Among the MMPs, MMP-2 (gelatinase A) and MMP-9 (gelatinase B) are able to digest basal lamina, which can lead to opening of cerebral barriers. MMP-9 expression in CSF of dogs with IVDH is associated with the severity of neurologic signs and prognosis, suggesting MMP-9 expression after severe spinal cord injury associated with absence of deep pain perception is a predictor of poor prognosis (Nagano et al., 2011) . Latent MMP-9 was detected in nine of 10 dogs with choroid plexus tumors or lymphoma, in a smaller percentage in dogs with meningiomas, gliomas, or pituitary tumors, and not at all in dogs with nonneoplastic neurologic disease (Mariani et al., 2013) . Further diagnostic application of MMPs' measurement within CSF awaits combined analyses of MMPs and their inhibitors (TIMPs) as well as cytokines in order to define the potential diagnostic application of MMPs in CNS inflammatory diseases (Marangoni et al., 2011) .",

Evaluation of multiple preparations or preparations from larger volumes of CSF increases the likelihood of detection of minor abnormalities.

Cytocentrifugation is commonly available in reference or commercial laboratories. The membrane filtration technique requires special staining that is not commonly available in practice. Several sedimentation techniques have been described and are suitable for use in practice or commercial or reference laboratories to which rapid submission of CSF specimens is possible (Cook and DeNicola, 1988; Parent and Rand, 1994) . Readers are referred to these sources for more detail on construction of a sedimentation apparatus and preparation of sedimentation specimens. A sample device is demonstrated in Fig. 14-2A&B.

These may not have been from bone marrow aspiration but possibly from a site of extramedullary hematopoiesis as was discovered in five dogs with hematopoietic elements within the interstitium of the choroid plexus at the level of the fourth ventricle (Bienzle et al., 1995) . Myelin-like material, neurons (Fig. 14-4A), and neuropil (Fig. 14-4B) have been reported as contaminants of canine CSF associated with accidental puncture of the spinal cord during cerebellomedullary cistern collection (Fallin et al., 1996) . The term surface epithelium is used to describe meningeal, choroid plexus, ependymal, and endothelial cells that are found in human CSF. However, because of their fragility, these cells are difficult to identify cytologically with certainty. Ependymal cells, which line the walls of the ventricles, and choroid plexus epithelium, which is continuous with ependymal epithelium, are indistinguishable from one another; they are small uniform cuboidal to columnar cells that are characterized by eccentrically located small, round nuclei, granular to coarse chromatin, and moderate amounts of finely granular cytoplasm ( Fig. 14-3B ). Garma-Avi\u00f1a (2004) described three cell types of canine choroid plexuses based on Romanowsky staining in which the most prevalent (75%) were termed alpha cells having basophilic granular cytoplasm. The remainder beta and gamma cells are nongranular or rarely vacuolated, respectively. Leptomeningeal (subarachnoid lining) cells are described as individual or small clusters of mononuclear cells with moderate to abundant lightly basophilic cytoplasm containing round to oval eccentric nuclei with a delicate chromatin pattern. In canine CSF the presence of occasional surface epithelium cells should be judiciously interpreted as more likely a contaminant (Wessmann et al., 2010) .",

Demonstration of bacteria, fungi, yeast, or protozoa in CSF can confirm the presence of these infections. A variety of fungal types-Cryptococcus, Blastomyces, Histoplasma, Neospora caninum, and ehrlichial organisms-have been demonstrated in CSF (Gaitero et al., 2006; Singh et al., 2005) .

Clinical improvement occurred with corticosteroid administration. Bacterial meningoencephalitis (Fig. 14-9A&B ) is suspected if greater than 75% neutrophils are present in CSF regardless of the total cell count. Bacteremia is usually the cause, with septic emboli to the brain as a result. Untreated cases often produce marked pleocytosis with greater than 1000 cells/\u03bcL. Intracellular location of bacteria and accompanying inflammation are particularly important in eliminating the possibility of bacterial contamination associated with nonsterile collection technique or nonsterile collection tubes. Neutrophils show mild to severe karyolysis.",

A study of 42 dogs found that a high percentage of affected animals were Toy or Terrier breeds (Munana and Luttgen, 1998) . Clinical signs of fever, ataxia, tetraparesis, cervical hyperesthesia, and seizures have been reported. Designation of the clinical signs into focal or multifocal was helpful in determining prognosis, with dogs having focal clinical signs surviving longer. Lesions are histologically found in both white and gray matter of the brain and predominantly the white matter of the caudal brainstem and spinal cord. CSF has variable cytology ranging from a mild to moderate lymphocytic, mixed cell pleocytosis to neutrophilic predominance (Chrisman, 1992) . Nucleated cell counts had a median of 250 cells/\u03bcL (range 0 to 11,840) with the majority having counts greater than 100 cells/\u03bcL (Munana and Luttgen, 1998) . In this same study, dogs with multifocal signs all had pleocytosis, whereas some of the dogs with focal signs had normal cell counts. The predominant cell type was lymphocytic (52%), monocytic (21%), neutrophilic (10%), and mixed cell (17%). CSF protein is variably elevated, with a mean value of 256 mg/dL (range 13 to 1119), as reported by Bailey and Higgins (1986) . Differential diagnoses include infectious diseases and idiopathic necrotizing encephalitis. Electrophoretic separation of CSF proteins in GME has shown increases in the alpha and beta globulin fractions (Sorjonen, 1990) , whereas these fractions are generally decreased in canine distemper (Chrisman, 1992) . Both GME and canine distemper may have increased gamma globulins. GME lesions involve widely disseminated perivascular, lymphocytic-granulomatous meningeal, and parenchymal infiltrates. Necrosis and demyelination are major features in necrotizing encephalitis and may be present to a minor extent in GME. GME cases with lesions that involve the caudal brainstem or spinal cord progress slowly, permitting longer survival. Radiation has been recommended as an adjunct to treatment, especially in dogs with focal clinical signs. The disease is poorly responsive to glucocorticoids despite the suggestion of an immune-mediated etiopathogenesis (Kipar et al., 1998) . GME inflammatory lesions are composed of predominantly CD3 antigen-positive T-lymphocytes and a heterogeneous population of activated macrophages with MHC class II expression, suggesting a T-cell-mediated delayedtype hypersensitivity of an organ-specific autoimmune disease (Kipar et al., 1998) .",

Cell counts may be variable, ranging from normal to greater than 50 cells/\u03bcL; and lymphocytes represent the predominant cell population, accounting for greater than 60% of the cells present. Abate et al (1998) indicated that CSF in distemper cases had increases in macrophages, total protein concentration, and gamma-globulin fraction by electrophoretic separation and the presence of cellular inclusions. Amude et al (2006) described a marked CSF pleocytosis (554 cells/\u03bcL) with protein content within normal limits in a 7-month-old dog with polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-confirmed viral distemper. In this case, the nucleated cell differential count was 70% lymphocytes, 25% neutrophils, and 5% monocytes. Diagnosis of canine distemper often involves suggestive history, clinical signs, and evidence of serum or CSF IgM in response to active infection by canine distemper virus. In addition, RT-PCR on CSF is considered a useful, fast, and specific method to diagnose canine distemper virus infection (Amude et al., 2006) . Mixed Cell Pleocytosis. As we have described, mixed cell pleocytosis can be seen with a variety of underlying diseases, including GME, FIP, canine distemper, steroid-responsive meningoencephalomyelitis (Fig. 14-22) , toxoplasmosis, neosporosis, sarcocystosis (Fig. 14-23A-C) , encephalitozoonosis, cryptococcosis, blastomycosis, aspergillosis, histoplasmosis, degenerative disc disease, ischemia, and neoplasia (Chrisman, 1992; Bisby et al., 2010) .

Myelin-like material was observed in 20 of 98 (20%) samples and was more frequently observed in lumbar than in cerebellomedullary samples. Samples from dogs less than 10 kg were more likely to contain myelin compared with dogs more than 10 kg. Larger amounts of myelin-like material were observed in CSF from dogs with intervertebral disc disease compared with other diseases. No association was found between myelin-like material and outcome. These results suggest that the presence of extracellular myelin-like material in canine CSF samples is more often an artifact of collection technique and anatomy rather than the result of neurologic disease; in addition, myelin-like material in CSF is not associated with a poorer prognosis.",

They are thought to arise from entrapment of ectodermal cells in the neural tube during embryologic development or from trauma of repeated spinal taps. The cyst material, and occasionally CSF, contains numerous mature squamous epithelium, consistent with an epidermoid cyst (Fig. 14-28A&B) . Spinal arachnoid cysts, also referred to as meningeal cysts and leptomeningeal cysts, have been reported as an uncommon cause of neurologic deficits in the dog and cat and are generally related to a normal CSF analysis (Galloway et al., 1999) . With neoplasia, the protein concentration is often increased with only occasional neoplastic cells observed in CSF. This will depend on the location of the mass with its proximity to the ventricle, its involvement with the meninges, or its communication with the subarachnoid space in order to have access to CSF. CSF was collected in 51 dogs with primary intracranial neoplasia, in which the fluid was normal in 10% of cases, characterized by an elevated cell count in 58% of cases, and characterized as albuminocytologic dissociation in 30% of cases. A mixed cell pleocytosis was the most common cytologic abnormality in the 51 samples, and cellular atypia or neoplastic cells were detected in only two dogs with CNS lymphoma (Snyder et al., 2006) . The authors concluded that in the case of CNS lymphoma, CSF analysis may be helpful in achieving a diagnosis. Similarly, in 28 cats with intracranial neoplasia, Troxel et al (2003) found that albuminocytologic dissociation was noted in eight (28.6%) cats. The remaining 20 (71.4%) cats had varied increases in nucleated cell counts, while a definitive diagnosis of lymphoma was made in only one cat in which lymphoid blast cells were detected in CSF.",

Elective employment of smear cytology in neuropathology is based on several considerations: it is very simple and quick to perform, it requires few materials and equipment, and the specimens can be prepared directly in the operating or adjacent room. Small pieces of tissue can be examined and smears can be repeated several times with different portions of the same specimens. Various fast-staining techniques can be used. Smear preparations appear to be of greater diagnostic value, with fewer nondiagnostic specimens, when compared with touch preparations (Long et al., 2002) .

(Fig. 14-45) . Vernau et al (2001) described the cytologic features of 93 primary brain tumors in dogs and cats. De Lorenzi et al (2006) determined an accuracy value of 92.8% with a cytologic evaluation of nervous system lesions from 42 cases in dogs and cats. They initially classified the changes as nonneoplastic or neoplastic. The nonneoplastic group consisted of tissues derived from inflammation, cyst, granuloma, or scar lesion, whereas the neoplastic group included lesions of neuroepithelial origin (neural, glial, and ependymal/choroidal proliferations) or of nonneuroepithelial origin, divided further into epithelial, mesenchymal, and round cell tumors.",

Cytologic features of nonneuroepithelial lesions can vary considerably due to the extreme heterogeneous morphology of these groups. Nevertheless, the presence of cohesive cellular clusters or epithelial sheets; tightly packed spindle cells; whorls; large, round cells with prominent nucleoli and discernible cytoplasm; and numerous inflammatory cells suggests consideration of nonneuroepithelial tumors. The distinction between neuroepithelial and nonneuroepithelial depends to a large extent on pattern recognition (an advantage of histopathology) and individual cell morphology. Therefore, overlapping of morphologic features for the differentiation of neoplastic and nonneoplastic lesions and the primitive tumor heterogeneity is a limitation of cytology.",

            "text": "Nonneuroepithelial tumors that arise from the arachnoid meningeal layer are termed meningiomas (Box 14-1)-the most common intracranial tumor in dogs and cats. The tumors are derived from leptomeningocytes that associate with neural crest tissue and have both epithelial and fibroblastic ultrastructural characteristics. As a result, these tumors have several variant forms , which are found both in cervical and lumbar regions of the spinal cord as well as intracranially and within the retrobulbar region (Zimmerman et al., 2000) . Spinal cord meningiomas are mostly extramedullary, but few reports note the radiographic presentation of them as intramedullary (Hopkins et al., 1995) . According to Bailey and Higgins (1986) , meningiomas are associated with a high prevalence of pleocytosis (nucleated cell counts greater than 50/\u03bcL), with a predominance of neutrophils that is attributed to a response to tumor necrosis. In contrast, pleocytosis was detected in only 27% of 56 dogs with intracranial meningioma, and a neutrophil predominance was observed in only 19% of dogs. It is possible that the incidence of the tumor necrosis was less in their study. Myelography, MRI, and CT are imaging tools used currently to identify tumors of the brain and spinal cord. Fine-needle aspirations, crush preparations (De Lorenzi et al., 2006; Moissonnier et al., 2002) , and incisional cutting needles have been used to obtain cytologic and tissue samples for biopsy. The cytologic features of meningiomas have been discussed in several reports (Hopkins et al., 1995; Zimmerman et al., 2000) .",

The cytologic features include large, round cells with eccentric nuclei and cytoplasm distended by many variably stained eosinophilic granules (Fig. 14-51A-C) . Cells stain strongly positive for PAS as well as for the immunocytochemical stain for ubiquitin. Other staining reactions for these cells include a variably positive reaction for S-100, \u03b1-1-antichymotrypsin, \u03b1-1-antitrypsin, and vimentin as well as a negative reaction for glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), pancytokeratins, and markers for subpopulations of leukocytes and macrophages Sharkey et al., 2004) . Peripheral nerve sheath tumors (PNST) may be encountered in cytologic preparations (Box 14-1). These are most often associated with peripheral nerve roots and include those of the neural crest-derived Schwann cell that assists in myelination as well as fibroblastic connective tissue cells that surround nerve bundles. A cytologic distinction among benign PNST (schwannoma and neurofibroma) can be difficult or impossible (Fig. 14-52) . Benign schwannomas and neurofibromas can show cytologic features of atypia so that differentiation between benign and malignant PNST is problematic even for the experienced, and histopathologic examination is required.",

Tumors from these cells most often produce a normal CSF related to their deep parenchymal location. One report of oligodendrogliomas in cats described their cytologic features as they appeared in cytospin preparations of CSF (Dickinson et al., 2000) . Cells were large with nuclei four to six times the size of red cells. Nuclei were eccentric within a densely basophilic, moderately abundant cytoplasm. An aspirate from an oligodendroglioma presenting as a brain mass is shown (Fig. 14-55A-C) . Normally, these cells are responsible for myelination of neurons in the CNS and appear as small cells with condensed chromatin. Tumors often demonstrate a unique honeycomb appearance and increased proliferation of blood vessels. Astrocytes provide nutritional support to neurons, act as metabolic buffers or detoxifiers, and assist in repair and scar formation. They have been described as histiocytic in appearance (Fernandez et al., 1997 ). An example of reactive astrocytes was described previously (Fig. 14-40A&B ). Astrocytomas examined by crush preparation preserve the cytoplasmic features of an eccentrically placed nucleus within a moderately abundant basophilic cytoplasm (Fig. 14-56A-C). GFAP is a marker used to distinguish astrocytes from other neuroglial and meningeal cells, but it may sometimes yield a positive reaction in neuroepithelial tumors, such as ependymoma and choroid plexus tumor (Fernandez et al., 1997) , and meningeal tumors .",

The ependymoma (Box 14-1) is a rare tumor (Fig. 14-57 ) that was reported in the cat, with neoplastic cells found in CSF with a moderately elevated protein content, mild pleocytosis, and macrophages as the predominant cell type along with evidence of chronic hemorrhage. The neoplastic cells were described as large cells having nuclear hyperchromatism, prominent nucleoli, and moderately abundant, highly basophilic agranular cytoplasm appearing singly and in clusters. An anaplastic ependymoma in a dog was diagnosed from partial positive staining with GFAP and vimentin but a negative reaction with S100, CD3, and cytokeratin (Fernandez et al., 1997) . The choroid plexus cells represent a highly vascular portion of the pia mater that projects into the ventricles of the brain and is thought to secrete CSF. Positive cytokeratin staining is expected in choroid plexus tumors (Box 14-1). A cytologic example of a choroid plexus tumor is shown as an imprint of the tumor mass and within CSF (Fig. 14-58A&B ). The choroid plexus tumors were associated with increased protein content and increased nucleated cell count in a study (Bailey and Higgins, 1986) . These cells appear similar to mesothelial cells, having a large, round nucleus with abundant, well-defined, deeply basophilic cytoplasm having surface projections ( Fig.  14-58C) . A papillary appearance with epithelial features can be seen in cytologic preparations of choroid plexus papilloma ( Fig.  14-58A ). Two choroid plexus carcinomas were cytologically misdiagnosed as choroid plexus papillomas (De Lorenzi et al., 2006) . Both of these tumors occurred within a ventricular site and consisted of large, pedunculated, friable masses that presented cytologically as well-formed papillary structures, usually showing a fine fibrovascular core covered by uniform cuboidal or columnar epithelium having minimal cytologic atypia with moderate pleomorphism (Fig. 14-59A ). The final histologic diagnosis of carcinoma was made based on the presence of single-cell infiltration into the fibrovascular cores, suggesting that a definitive diagnosis of choroid plexus carcinoma can be made only after thorough histologic examination of the resected specimen ( Fig.  14-59B ). Magnetic resonance imaging and CSF analysis were helpful in determining a difference between choroid plexus papilloma and choroid plexus carcinoma (Westworth et al., 2008) . In this study, Golden Retrievers were overrepresented compared with the hospital population and median CSF protein concentration in carcinomas was 108 mg/dL (range 27-380 mg/dL) that was significantly higher compared to papillomas whose median was 34 mg/dL (range 32-80 mg/dL). A potential diagnostic pitfall among tumors (Box 14-1) of different neuroectodermal and nonneuroectodermal origin can arise with ependymal or choroid plexus tumors and metastasis from well-differentiated adenocarcinomas. In fact, these two categories of neoplasms can share some analogous cytomorphologic findings such as epithelioid aspects with cohesive gland-like fragments, round to polygonal cellular shape, and well-defined cytoplasm with distinct margins and round nuclei often with evident nucleoli. Additional information, such as the age of the patient, the precise location within the brain or spinal cord, and a complete clinical history, especially the presence of a known primary tumor, may be critical in making the correct diagnosis.",

During the last decade, there has been an increased use of sophisticated imaging techniques with increased surgical investigation and surgical and medical treatment of neurologic disease. These trends indicate there may be opportunity to expand the use of nervous system cytology to include examination of fine-needle aspirates of lesions identified within the brain or spinal cord, ventricular fluids obtained by direct aspiration or by cannula, and squash preparations of small biopsy specimens or tissue fragments. All of these techniques are currently used in cytologic evaluations of human patients (Bigner, 1997) and to a limited extent in veterinary medicine (De Lorenzi et al., 2006; Moissonnier et al., 2002; Vernau et al., 2001) . There may be increased demand and/or need for development of special preparative techniques such as cell blocks and immunocytochemistry for more precise identification of primary or metastatic tumors, inflammatory cell types, or immunophenotype of malignant or nonmalignant lymphoid proliferations. This is useful in human medicine for the purpose of diagnosis, prognosis, and disease monitoring.",

The authors conclude that intraoperative diagnosis with stereotactic biopsy has high validity and that immediate treatment based on smear preparations can be justified.
