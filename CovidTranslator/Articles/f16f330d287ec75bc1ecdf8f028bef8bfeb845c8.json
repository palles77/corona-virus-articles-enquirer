To be effective, a minimum biosecurity plan should address (1) isolating new animals, (2) isolating animals returning to the herd, (3) regulation of animal, human and equipment movement, and (4) the design and implementation of cleaning and disinfection procedures directed at the reduction of pathogen loads. Although much of the following may be applicable to various animal systems, special camelid situations will be addressed, when appropriate.",

However, overdependence on these technologies may blur the importance of, and encourage indifference toward management components of disease control such as biosecurity. 3 Management, including directed input from qualified veterinarians, should strive to incorporate the breadth of available tools including risk assessment, computerized record keeping, implementation of modern diagnostic technologies and the practice of optimal husbandry techniques, including biosecurity and biocontainment. 4 Biosecurity practices should be prioritized to address those factors that pose the greatest risk of disease introduction. The most common means by which contagious diseases are introduced to a herd involves introduction of new animals or the return to the herd of animals that had been on other premises or locations. Obviously, introduction of animals displaying any clinical signs of disease must be avoided. Importantly, producers must be educated that mere exclusion of clinically ill animals is unlikely to prevent introduction of disease. Often, animals that appear clinically normal may be incubating disease or be subclinically affected. It is well documented that in a given population of animals, only a fraction of those infected typically exhibit clinical disease, the larger proportion being subclinically affected. Consequently, appropriate and effective efforts in biosecurity must focus on the entire population of animals, rather than simply concentrating on those that are clinically affected.",

This obviously requires communication between parties long before any animal movement. Ideally, purchasers should be familiar with both current and past health status of the seller's herd. Conditions of concern may include evidence of diarrhea, respiratory diseases, ill thrift, failure of passive transfer, abortion, and herd-based diseases. Buyers must also be knowledgeable about fundamental biosecurity practices of the seller's herd.

In general, the effect of virulence mechanisms and how they relate to disease in camelids is similar to that in other domestic livestock. For example, crias exposed to enteroinvasive strains of Escherichia coli are more likely to suffer bacteremia compared with those exposed to noninvasive strains. Exposure to drug resistant strains of bacteria (e.g., Salmonella) may be associated with herd outbreaks of disease. The pathogens that affect camelids are often similar to those that affect other domestic species and include bacteria, viruses, protozoa, and various parasites. These agents have been reviewed and are listed in Box 1-1. [14] [15] [16] [17] Although camelids are known to suffer diseases similar to other domestic livestock, no camelid-specific vaccines have been produced or approved for use in the United States. Many products are, therefore, used in an extra-label manner. Owners and managers should be informed that extra-label use carries no assurance of efficacy or safety. The basic foundation for immunizing camelids is, therefore, limited and includes immunization against Clostridia organisms such as Clostridium In hot and humid environments such as those found in the southeastern and western United States, heat stress is prevalent. Prevention of heat stress should involve management practices that facilitate a camelid's ability to cool itself. 19 Shearing practices should be adjusted to coincide with seasons of high environmental temperature. Camelids should always have access to sufficient shade and be housed with damp, sandy soils, which facilitate thermoregulation. Sprinkling systems that spray the camelids' ventrum and wading ponds may be effective. In severe conditions, air-conditioned stalls may be necessary. Importantly, any time animals are housed in confined areas (either during hot or cold weather), attention must be paid to adequate ventilation. As a general rule, if individuals inspecting a facility are not reasonably comfortable because of excessive heat, cold, wind, moisture, humidity, odors, and so on, it is likely that animals will be similarly uncomfortable.",

Infection occurs via the fecal-oral route; therefore, housing, feeding practices, and pasture management are important in reducing exposure to susceptible animals. Importantly, oocysts can survive for several weeks in warm, dry environments, but they can persist for months to years in cool, damp environments. The prepatent period (time from ingestion of infective oocysts to shedding in feces) varies between coccidia species and may range from approximately 10 days for Eimaria punoensis to 33 days for E. macusaniensis. Crossprotection between coccidia species does not appear to occur; therefore, even adult camelids may become infected and develop clinical disease after exposure to a new species.",

This environment lessened the risk of pathogen exposure and disease propagation, since direct contact between animals was minimized and pathogens were frequently exposed to unfavorable environmental conditions (freezing or thawing and desiccation). Today, camelids commonly reside in environments varying from pasture settings with low population density to dry lots with barns or enclosures with high population density. Specific risk factors include housing (e.g., barns, pastures); physical environment (e.g., bedding, animal exposure, cleaning and disinfection); general hygiene; miscellaneous stresses such as transportation and handling, and atmospheric conditions (e.g., temperature, humidity, ventilation). Fortunately, many of the risk factors associated with environmental conditions can be controlled with implementation of specific biosecurity measures.",

Varnished plywood retains approximately 15-fold more microorganisms compared with plastic surfaces. On smooth impervious surfaces such as metal or plastic, washing with soap and water to remove visible contamination will result in the elimination of approximately 99% of the microbial load. Similar washing of typical household surfaces removes approximately 90% of the microbial load. It can be presumed that washing of rough lumber will remove even less microorganisms. This knowledge may be used to recommend cleaning and disinfection protocols, in designing facilities, and choosing construction materials and equipment. Finally, basic knowledge about the survival of pathogens on various substrates may be useful in both the management and the investigation of disease outbreaks.",
