We have combined 3 proteomic analysis of the viral translation and replication complexes with a CRISPR 4 screen, to identify host factors required for norovirus infection. The core stress 5 granule component G3BP1 was identified as a host factor essential for efficient 6 human and murine norovirus infection, demonstrating a conserved function across 7 the Norovirus genus. Furthermore, we show that G3BP1 functions in the novel 8 paradigm of viral VPg-dependent translation initiation, contributing to the assembly of 9 translation complexes on the VPg-linked viral positive sense RNA genome by 10 facilitating 40S recruitment. Our data suggest that G3BP1 functions by providing viral 11 RNA a competitive advantage over capped cellular RNAs, uncovering a novel 12 function for G3BP1 in the life cycle of positive sense RNA viruses and identifying the 13 first host factor with pan-norovirus pro-viral activity. 14 15 16",

Within the membrane bound viral 24 replication complex, translation of the viral genome and the synthesis of new viral 25 RNA occurs in a highly coordinated process. Positive sense RNA viruses have 26 evolved novel gene expression mechanisms that enable them to overcome the 27 genome size limitations that accompany error-prone replication and which might 28 restrict their overall coding capacity (Firth and Brierley, 2012) . In addition, viral 29 modification of the host cell translation machinery often provides a competitive 30 advantage allowing for the efficient translation of viral RNA in an environment where 31 competing cellular RNAs are in abundance (McCormick and Khaperskyy, 2017) . 32",

STARS 181 analysis was used to ranks genes with positive and negative values (Table S4 ).

Western blotting confirmed the loss of G3BP1 in the three lines 201 tested and we noted that at in some cases, a concomitant increase in G3BP2 202 expression was observed as has been previously noted (Kedersha et al., 2016) . A 203 clear defect was observed in the ability to replicate to produce infectious virus in 204 three independently selected \u0394G3BP1 cell lines ( Fig 4B) . This effect was mirrored by 205 an inability to induce cytopathic effect leading to virus-induced cell death ( Fig 4C) . In 206 contrast, the ability of encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV) to infect and cause cell 207 death was unaffected by the deletion of G3BP1( Fig 4C) . These data confirm that 208 cells lacking G3BP1 are highly resistant to norovirus infection. To determine if the G3BP1 was also essential for HuNoV, we examined the impact 212 of loss of G3BP1 on human norovirus replication in cell culture using the Norwalk 213 virus replicon. To establish the experimental system, we first confirmed that the 214 presence of VPg on the 5' end of the Norwalk RNA was essential for the replication 215 of the replicon RNA and for the capacity to form G418 resistant colonies. 216",

BV-2 cells were cultured in DMEM containing 10% 731 FBS and 1% HEPES. G3BP1 knockout BV-2 cells were generated using two 732 approaches. The clone 1B2 was generated by transiently transfected with Cas9 and 733 a sgRNA (5TTCCCCGGCCCCGGCTGATGNGG) targeting exon 7 of G3BP1. BV-2 734 cells were then single cell cloned and G3BP1 was sequenced by Illumina HiSeq. BV-735 2 cells are polyploid at the G3BP1 locus as described previously (Orchard et al., 736 2016). Clone 1B2 also had three independent deletions at the sgRNA binding site 737 resulting in deletions of 1, 2, and 5 base pairs respectively. The mutations introduced 738 into the IB2 BV-2 cell clone resulted in frame shifts at nucleotide positions 253, 254 739 and 244 and the absence of detectable G3BP1 protein as measured by western blot. 740 G3BP1 knockout BV-2 cell clones A, C and F were generated using an independent 741 approach that relied on first generating a pool of three lentiviruses carrying guide 742 RNAs TGTGCAACATGTCCGGGGCC, CAAACTCCCGCCCGACCAGC and 743 TAGTCCCCTGCTGGTCGGGC targeting the first 100bp of the coding sequence, 744 cloned into pLentiCRISPRv2 (Sanjana et al., 2014).

Mouse G3BP1 was subcloned from pCM6-G3BP1 752 (MR207441; Origene). Mouse G3BP1 lentiviral constructs deficient in the C-terminal 753 RGG domain (mG3BP1\u0394RGG) and the RGG and RRM domains 754 (mG3BP1\u0394RGGRRM) were generated by Gibson cloning from the pCMV6-G3BP1 755 vector.
