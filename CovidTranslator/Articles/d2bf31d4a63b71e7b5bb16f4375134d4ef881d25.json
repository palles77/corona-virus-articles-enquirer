To permit analysis of the host range and entry mechanism of SARS-CoV, we incorporated the humanized SARS-CoV spike (S) glycoprotein into HIV particles to generate a highly infectious SARS-CoV pseudotyped virus. The infection on Vero E6-a permissive cell line to SARS-CoV-could be neutralized by sera from convalescent SARS patients, and the entry was a pH-dependent process. With these highly infectious SARS-CoV pseudotypes, several cell lines derived from various tissues were revealed as susceptible to SARS-CoV, which were highly corresponding to the expression pattern of virus\u00d5s receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). In addition, we also demonstrated angiotensin 1 converting enzyme (ACE)-the homologue of ACE2 could not function as a receptor for SARS-CoV.",

It not only binds to the cellular receptor but also initiates membrane fusion [14] [15] [16] [17] . To develop the pseudotyped virus system for studying SARS-CoV entry, we initially transfected pTS containing the native S gene into 293T cells, but found that the expression of the S protein in transfected cells was too weak to be detected either by FACS or Western blot (Figs. 1A and B). The poor expression from the native S gene might be due to codon bias, since the native S gene had a codon usage that differed substantially from those of human genes (Fig. 1C) . We therefore synthesized a humanized S gene (TSh) in which native codons were replaced with the degenerate codons used most frequently in human genes. When the pTSh was transfected into 293T cells, the S protein could be easily detected by FACS analysis (Fig. 1A) . Western blot analysis of lysates from the pTSh transfected 293T cells showed two major protein bands that reacted with anti-S sera: a 180 kDa protein corresponding to the previously described size for the mature S protein on SARS-CoV virions [18] and a 130 kDa protein consistent with the calculated molecular weight of the nonglycosylated precursors of the S protein (Fig. 1B) .",

            "text": "The establishment of the pseudotyped virus HIV/ SARS provided us a convenient and safe method for studying the viral tropism, which would help to reveal potential SARS-CoV target tissues besides the lung. Using this virus, we assessed the infectivity of SARS-CoV using a panel of cell lines. Among the tested cell lines, Huh7 (human liver cell line) and Vero E6 exhibited the highest susceptibility to HIV/SARS. Two other human liver cell lines (HepG2 and Bel7402), one lung cell line (Glc82), and two colon intestine cell lines (T84 and Colo320) could also be infected by HIV/SARS to various degrees. A canine kidney-derived cell line (MDCK) also exhibited susceptibility to HIV/SARS. However, HeLa, A549, H7402, L02, Hep-2, SW480, NIH/3T3, COS-7, RD, and CHO cells were not infected by HIV/SARS. As a control, all cell lines were readily infected by HIV/VSV-G (Fig. 3A) . We then analyzed the expression of ACE2 in these cells in order to establish a correlation between ACE2 expression and HIV/SARS susceptibility. Our data showed that ACE2 expressed in all susceptible cell lines except MDCK; however, the ACE2 did not express in non-permissive cells such as HeLa and NIH/3T3. The MDCK cell line was canine-derived and we were not sure whether our PCR primers were suitable because the ACE2 sequence in canines was unavailable. The expression level of ACE2 was relatively high in Vero E6 and Huh7 cells and was weaker in Bel7402, HepG2, T84, Colo320, and Glc82 (Fig. 3B) . These data established a strong correlation between ACE2 expression and the cell susceptibility to the HIV/SARS. ACE2 is highly expressed in respiratory, cardiovascular tissues, and in the gastrointestinal systems [21] . Previous studies have shown that respiratory and gastrointestinal system were major targets for SARS-CoV in vivo [1, 3, 22, 23] . The high level of ACE2 expression can explain the tropism of SARS-CoV in these two systems. Thus, the tissue-specificity of SARS-CoV infection may be determined, at least in part, by tissue-dependent expression of ACE2.",

We analyzed the expression of ACE2 in these cells by RT-PCR but failed to detect its expression (data not shown). It was reported that ACE-the homologue of ACE2, was expressed in T lymphocyte, macrophage, and dendritic cells [26, 27] , and this was confirmed by our RT-PCR results (data not shown). To test whether ACE could mediate the entry of SARS-CoV as ACE2, we transduced cDNA of human ACE into NIH/3T3 cells or HeLa cells, the ACE expressing cells could neither be infected by HIV/SARS (Fig. 4A ) nor bind to soluble S protein (Fig. 4B) . Our data indicated that the ACE could not function as a receptor for SARS-CoV and the impairment of immune system in SARS patients might be due to other unknown reasons.",

The other is receptor-mediated endocytosis in which low pH within the endosome is required to trigger membrane fusion. Inhibitors of vacuolar acidification, such as ammonium chloride, can prevent virus entry through the latter pathway [28] . To assess through which pathway HIV/SARS used to enter the cell, we treated the Huh7 cells with ammonium chloride before infection. Pseudotyped viruses HIV/VSV-G and HIV/AMLV demonstrating pH-dependent and independent entry were used as positive and negative controls, respectively. Infectivity of HIV/ SARS and HIV/VSV-G, but not HIV/AMLV, was similarly diminished by ammonium chloride (Fig. 5) . Treatment with 30 mM ammonium chloride caused complete inhibition of infection by HIV/SARS (Fig. 5) . This result was consistent with the recent report by Yang et al. [29] . The pH dependency of infection indicated that the entry of HIV/SARS into host cells was most likely mediated by endocytosis.",

Most importantly, our cell tropism analysis indicated that multiple tissues besides the lung might be susceptible to SARS-CoV infection because of the specific expression of ACE2. Finally, this SARS-CoV pseudotyped virus we generated in this study can be used as an efficient and safe system for analyzing the character of SARS-CoV infection including immune responses to SARS-CoV infection, development of neutralizing antibodies, and detailed characterization of the S protein function.",
