Poly-ADPr-glycohydrolase readily reverses poly-ADP-ribosylation induced by the DNA-damage sensor PARP1 and other enzymes, but it does not remove the most proximal ADPr linked to the target amino acid. Searches for enzymes capable of fully reversing cellular mono-ADP-ribosylation back to the unmodified state have proved elusive, which leaves a gap in the understanding of this modification. Here, we identify a family of macrodomain enzymes present in viruses, yeast and animals that reverse cellular ADP-ribosylation by acting on mono-ADP-ribosylated substrates. Our discoveries establish the complete reversibility of PARP-catalyzed cellular ADP-ribosylation as a regulatory modification.",

            "text": "a r t i c l e s ADP-ribosylation is a highly dynamic post-translational modification carried out by a variety of enzymes that share the substrate NAD + and transfer single or multiple ADPr moieties onto target proteins [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] , often in response to cellular stresses including DNA damage, infection and neuronal signaling. Specific PARP family members (ARTD enzymes), including PARP10, PARP14 and PARP16 as well as certain sirtuins (hSirT4 and hSirT6), bacterial toxins and ecto-mARTs (ARTC enzymes), transfer only a single ADPr unit onto amino acid side chains 1, 3, 6, [9] [10] [11] [12] . Other ADP-ribosyltransferases can attach the initial ADPr moiety onto an acceptor residue and then add additional ADPr units to the 2\u2032-OH group of the covalently linked ADPr moiety, thus acting as genuine oligo-or poly-ADPr polymerases, the most notable example of which is PARP1, an enzyme involved in DNA-damage signaling and the control of chromatin structure. ADP-ribosylhydrolase 3 (ARH3) and poly-ADPr-glycohydrolase (PARG) are two enzymes known to efficiently hydrolyze poly-ADPr (PAR) 3, 6, [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] . They have been reported to also act on the most protein-proximal ADPr moiety 6 , but their activities have not been rigorously tested. More recently, human PARG has been specifically tested on mono-ADP-ribosylated PARP1 E988Q substrate and has shown essentially no activity toward the terminal ADPr 14 . Two additional enzymatic activities have been reported that can catalyze the removal of the protein-proximal ADPr unit from acceptor proteins. The first is ADP-ribosylhydrolase 1 (ARH1), which specifically hydrolyzes ADPribosyl-arginine linkages 15 . The second is an unidentified ADP-ribosyl lyase activity that was first described in biochemical extracts from rat liver 13 , which is thought to function on ADP-ribosylated glutamate or lysine residues, releasing a deoxy form of ADPr, but that has not been biochemically identified to date. Indeed, searches for enzymes capable of fully reversing cellular mono-ADP-ribosylation back to the unmodified 'ground state' have proved elusive, despite the textbook assumption of full reversibility for PARP-mediated ADP-ribosylation.",

Using crystallography, site-directed mutagenesis and molecular dynamics simulations of the enzyme-substrate complex, we probe the catalytic mechanism of the enzyme and use the derived structure-and-function model to predict and validate protein-proximal ADP-ribosyl-hydrolase function in a family of active macrodomain enzymes across genomes from viruses to animals. a r t i c l e s Our findings establish PARP-catalyzed cellular ADP-ribosylation as a genuinely fully reversible regulatory post-translational modification.

Treatment with PARP1 inhibitor AG14361 (30 \u00b5M) or mutation of MacroD2 ADPr-binding pocket (G188E) abolished recruitment (Supplementary Fig. 2a,b) , consistent with a conserved role of its ADPr pocket and a PARP1dependent mechanism. In contrast to the PAR-binding MacroH2A.1.1 macrodomain 18, 26 , where more DNA damage only increased the amount of recruited protein but not its kinetics, MacroD2 recruitment acquired bimodal features, with a rapid phase followed by a slower phase, thus causing the maximum intensity of recruitment at the DNA lesions to shift to later time points concordantly with increasing DNA damage ( Supplementary Fig. 2c,d) . These observations suggested that MacroD2 binding sites become available through two distinct mechanisms. The first phase of recruitment is probably the result of the initial DNA damage-induced mono-ADP-ribosylation, as it depended on PARP inhibition (Supplementary Fig. 2a) . The second phase, in turn, may represent MacroD2's binding to mono-ADPribosylated species generated by the degradation of PAR through PARG activity. Consistently, short interfering RNA-mediated PARG depletion, which increased PAR levels (Supplementary Fig. 3a) , slowed the second MacroD2 recruitment phase without affecting the first phase of recruitment or the recruitment profile of the MacroH2A.1.1 macrodomain (Supplementary Fig. 3b-d) .",

Because glutamate-linked, proximal ADPr units in mono-ADP-ribosylated PARP1 are chemically related to OAADPr and because MacroD2 preferred binding to weakly modified PARP1 (Fig. 1b) , we tested whether it cleaved ADP-ribosylated PARP1. MacroD2 incubation with substoichiometrically [ 32 P]NAD + -modified PARP1 showed efficient [ 32 P]ADPr removal (Fig. 1d) , whereas PARG failed to remove ADPr. In contrast, PARG removed most radioactivity from poly-ADPribosylated PARP1 (Fig. 1d) , and MacroD2 showed little activity. MacroH2A.1.1, consistently with its nonenzymatic roles, removed no ADPr under either condition. Thus, MacroD2 acts on weakly modified mono-ADP-ribosylated PARP1, whereas PARG acts on highly modified poly-ADP-ribosylated PARP1. MacroD2 appears to be an enzyme that reverses PARP1-mediated mono-ADP-ribosylation. If MacroD2 reverses the first step of PARP1 activity, that is, mono-ADP-ribosylation, it should interfere with PAR synthesis. Indeed, under substoichiometric NAD + concentrations MacroD2 limited [ 32 P]ADPr incorporation on PARP1, regardless of when it was added (Supplementary Fig. 4d ). In contrast, when high NAD + concentrations were used, MacroD2 only reduced total ADPr when it was present in the reaction from the outset (Supplementary Fig. 4d) . To exclude the possibility that MacroD2 would affect PARP1 ADP-ribosylation by hydrolyzing NAD + , we assayed NAD + levels upon incubation in the presence of MacroD2 or MacroH2A.1.1. Neither MacroD2 nor MacroH2A.1.1 affected NAD + levels ( Supplementary Fig. 4e) . Thus, MacroD2 suppresses PARP1-mediated mono-ADP-ribosylation but cannot modify poly-ADP-ribosylated sites.",

Comparison of the MacroD2-ADPr complex with the ligand-free structure of the catalytically active homolog MacroD1 showed a structural rearrangement of loop 2 (amino acids 188-191 in MacroD2) upon ADPr binding 20 . In MacroD1, the loop is in an open conformation but is closed in the structure of the MacroD2-ADPr complex, where it stacks tightly against the distal ribose (a 13-\u00c5 movement of Tyr190 in MacroD2 compared to the corresponding Phe272 in MacroD1; Supplementary Fig. 6) .

Consistent with this, Asp102 is not conserved in AF1521 (Fig. 4a,e) . Likewise, Asn92, which is also conserved in noncatalytic macrodomains, helps to coordinate the distal ribose (Fig. 4c,e) . The only other hydrophilic group in the vicinity of the distal ribose is Tyr190, which hydrogen-bonds the 3\u2032\u2032-OH group and mediates van der Waals contacts with the distal ribose. However, Tyr190 is exchanged to phenylalanine in the catalytically active MacroD1, which argues against catalytic roles. The absence of other candidate residues leads us to tentatively propose a substrate-assisted mechanism, in which a coordinated water molecule ideally positioned between \u03b1-phosphate and distal ribose would be catalytic (Fig. 3a) .

Starting from a MacroD2 G100E scaffold (no catalytic activity, no ADPr binding), we introduced mutations that reestablish ADPr affinity but not catalysis. The ADPr-binding G100E Y190N and G100E I189R Y190N mutants exhibited no detectable de-ADP-ribosylation activity, despite their interaction with modified PARP10 (Supplementary Fig. 9a-d) . This indicated that the orientation of the distal ribose, the distance between Gly100 and Ile189 and the positioned water are crucial for catalysis.",

Structure-based alignments showed that the above identified signature residues required for catalytic activity in MacroD2, MacroD1 and AF1521 (Gly100 in loop 1, Ile189 and Tyr190 in loop 2 of MacroD2) are conserved in a number of macrodomain proteins, including viral SARS-CoV Nsp3, Escherichia coli YmdB, yeast Poa1p and human PARP14 (Fig. 4e) , identifying these proteins as potential mono-ADP-ribosyl hydrolases. We validated hydrolase activity in AF1521 and yeast Poa1p (Fig. 4d) . Consistent with our predictions, a yeast macrodomain not matching the signature (Ymx7) was not catalytically active (Fig. 4d) Signature motif residues important for the coordination of the ADPr distal ribose and indicative for hydrolysis activity are highlighted in red.

We suggest that the hydrolytic activities of macrodomain-like proteins on OAADPr and mono-ADP-ribosylated PARP1 and PARP10 are overlapping functions. OAADPr maintains an equilibrium between acetylated 2\u2032\u2032-and 3\u2032\u2032-OH, yet its acetyl group can also isomerize to the 1\u2032\u2032-OH 27 , so hydrolysis may occur at the 1\u2032\u2032-ester linkage. ADP-ribosylated glutamates are linked through the 1\u2032\u2032-OH, and our assays with H 2 18 O showed that MacroD2 hydrolyzes 1\u2032\u2032-linked ADPr. Further, the ADPr-1\u2032\u2032-phosphate hydrolase activity described in yPoa1p 19 but also present in MacroD1, MacroD2 and other macrodomains 25,31 correlates very well with our reported mono-ADP-ribosyl-hydrolase activity. Notably, a mutational analysis of SARS-CoV Nsp3 classified residues important for phosphatase activity that overlap our signature motif for protein-ADPr hydrolysis 31 . Further, the SARS-CoV Nsp3-ADPr complex is isostructural for distal ribose coordination with MacroD2-ADPr. Signature motifcontaining macrodomain proteins thus act as 1\u2032\u2032-ester hydrolases.",

In particular, MacroD2's reversal of ADP-ribosylation on weakly automodified PARP1 in vitro (Figs. 1 and 2c) suggests that MacroD2 could suppress PARP1 activation by removing mono-ADP-ribosylated PARP1 species until a certain threshold for full PARP1 activation is achieved, for example upon DNA damage. Inhibitors targeting macrodomain-like proteins most probably alter PARP1 signaling and could be therapeutically useful for cancer treatment. Further, there are many other ADP-ribosylating enzymes in humans, including PARPs and sirtuins, as well as nonenzymatic ADP-ribosylation mechanisms. Here we reported what is, to our knowledge, the first set of conserved enzymes capable of removing terminal, protein-proximal ADPr units from PARP-modified mono-ADP-ribosylated proteins. Although detailed mechanistic analysis awaits the generation of highly defined mono-ADP-ribosylated substrates, our discovery of enzymes that fully reverse this regulatory modification will allow systematic dissection of ADP-ribosylation signaling.",

Buffer chemicals, including ADP-ribose (A0752), anti-V5 affinity gel (A7345), H 2 18 O (32987) and cholera toxin A subunit (C8180) were all from Sigma.Plasmids. Mammalian expression constructs of wild-type MacroH2A.1.1 macrodomain and MacroD2 macrodomain were described previously 32 . The mammalian expression construct of wild-type MacroD1 (aa 86-325) was generated by cloning of the PCR-amplified corresponding sequence into the pmEGFP-C1 vector by using BglII and EcoRI restriction sites. The mutant G188E was generated by using QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis (Stratagene) according to the manufacturer's protocol. All constructs were sequence verified.Bacterial expression constructs were as follows: GST-PARP10 catalytic domain (aa 818-1025) was a gift from B.

            "text": "Imaging was performed on a Zeiss AxioObserver Z1 confocal spinning-disk microscope equipped with an AxioCam HRm CCD camera (Zeiss) through a Zeiss Plan/Apo 63\u00d7/1.4 oil-immersion objective lens. For laser microirradiation, we used a 355-nm-wavelength diode-pumped solid-state pulsed laser (DPSL-355/14, Rapp OptoElectronics). DNA damage was induced by focusing a circle with a diameter of 5 \u00b5m on the nucleus. We have defined as low laser energy the amount of microirradiation resulting in the recruitment of 2% of nuclear MacroH2A.1.1 at the sites of microirradiation and, consequently, high laser power as eight-fold increased energy compared to the former, which results in recruitment of about 6% of the nuclear MacroH2A.1.1 macrodomain to the site of microirradiation. The microirradiated cells were imaged every 3 s for 5-20 min. Cells were plated in borosilicate 8-well Lab-Tek chambered cover glasses (ThermoScientific), and Hoechst 33342 (Sigma) was added to the culture medium at least 30 min before microirradiation at 200 ng ml \u22121 final concentration. When indicated, the PARP inhibitor AG14361 (Selleckchem) was added to the culture medium 30 min before microirradiation at 30 \u00b5M final concentration. During the experiments, cells were kept at 37 \u00b0C in a CO2-independent imaging medium (Gibco) supplemented with 10% (v/v) FBS (Gibco), 1 mM sodium pyruvate (Sigma) and 2 mM l-glutamine (Sigma), 100 U ml \u22121 penicillin and 100 \u00b5g ml \u22121 streptomycin (Sigma).Time-lapse images were registered and analyzed with Fiji (http://fiji.sc/wiki/ index.php/Fiji), and the MultiStackReg. Igor Pro (WaveMetrics) Fiji plug-in was used for analyzing and plotting the data. To quantify protein recruitment following microirradiation, data were background subtracted, corrected to premicroirradiation, adjusted for changes in nuclear matrix intensity and corrected for fluorescence loss according to the formula R(t) = ((I(t)\u2212I back (t))\u2212((I(t 0 )\u2212I back (t 0 ))*((T(t)\u2212I back (t))\u2212(I(t)\u2212I back (t)))/((T(t 0 )\u2212I back (t 0 ))\u2212(I(t 0 )\u2212I back (t 0 ))))/ (T(t)\u2212I back (t))\u00d7100, where R is percentage of recruitment, I is intensity acquired along the laser path region, I back is the background region outside the cell of interest, and T is the total fluorescence within the nucleus.In vivo poly-ADP-ribosylation assay. To validate the effect of siRNAmediated PARG depletion, cells were washed in PBS (Sigma) after live-cell imaging and treated with 1.2 mM H 2 O 2 (Sigma) and fixed at different time points (10 min and 30 min). Subsequently, cells were fixed in prechilled 70-30% (v/v) methanol/acetone for 10 min at \u221220 \u00b0C, washed in PBS and blocked in 5% (w/v) milk in 0.05% (v/v) PBS-Tween20 at room temperature. The primary antibody, anti-poly-ADPr mouse monoclonal 10H antibody (ascites), 1:1,000, was used overnight at 4 \u00b0C. AlexaFluor647-conjugated donkey anti-mouse IgG secondary antibody (Molecular Probes cat. no. A31571) was used at 1:500 dilution. DNA was stained by using Hoechst 33342 (Sigma). Images of fixed cells were taken on a Zeiss AxioObserver Z1 confocal spinning-disk microscope and analyzed with CellProfiler 2.0 (http://www.cellprofiler.org/). To quantify poly-ADPr signal intensities, images were background subtracted, and far-red integrated intensities were calculated in the nuclei of cells positively expressing MacroD2 macrodomain. For the CellProfiler pipeline, nuclei were segmented by Hoechst staining, the segmented nuclei were filtered for MacroD2 expression on the basis of GFP fluorescence, and PAR levels were quantified as with the AlexaFluor647 integrated fluorescence intensities. Additional information is provided in the Supplementary Note. Protein expression and purification. Macrodomains were expressed in E. coli Rosetta(DE3)pLysS cells at 18 \u00b0C for 18 h after 200 \u00b5M IPTG induction. Cell pellets were snap frozen with liquid nitrogen and stored at \u221280 \u00b0C. For histidine-tagged-protein purification, the thawed pellet was resuspended in lysis/wash buffer (50 mM Tris-Cl, pH 7.9, 0.5 M NaCl, 20 mM imidazole, 5 mM \u03b2-mercaptoethanol and protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche)). Lysates were sonicated for 3 \u00d7 30 s at medium setting (Branson ) until the lysate was not viscous and centrifuged for 45 min at ~45,000g at 4 \u00b0C. The supernatant was incubated for 1h with Ni-NTA resin (Macherey Nagel), washed five times with 45 ml wash buffer and eluted with wash buffer containing 500 mM imidazole. Where appropriate, the histidine tag was cleaved with TEV protease overnight at 4 \u00b0C. The proteins were dialyzed overnight in storage buffer (25 mM Tris-Cl, pH 7.9, 0.25 M NaCl, 1 mM DTT), concentrated and subjected to gel-filtration chromatography with a Superdex S75 16/60 column (GE Healthcare) using storage buffer as eluent. Peak fractions confirmed by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie staining were pooled and concentrated with 10,000 MWCO concentrators (Amicon). Concentrations were determined by absorbance measurements at 280 nm wavelength by using calculated molar extinction coefficients.For GST-tagged macrodomain protein purification, the procedure was as above, with the exception of lysis buffer composition (50 mM Tris-Cl, pH 7.9, 0.1 mM EDTA, 0.5 M NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1 mM DTT and protease inhibitors) and glutathione Sepharose, with 20 mM reduced-glutathione elution (GE Healthcare).GST-fused PARP10 catalytic domain was expressed and purified essentially as previously described 33 , with the exception that the lysis/wash buffer for protein purification was 50 mM HEPES, pH 7.2, 500 mM KCl, 0.1 mM EDTA, 10% glycerol, 1 mM DTT and included protease inhibitors. The PARP10 protein was incubated with glutathione Sepharose, washed with wash buffer and eluted with 20 mM reduced glutathione in wash buffer. The fractions were dialyzed in storage buffer (25 mM HEPES, pH 7.2, 300 mM KCl, 10% glycerol, 1 mM DTT), concentrated to 1 mg/ml. The concentration was determined by absorbance measurements.Crystallization and data collection. MacroD2 macrodomain was purified to homogeneity in 25 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 100 mM NaCl, 1 mM DTT and concentrated to 5 mg/ml in the presence of 6 mM ADPr. Crystals of the macrodomain-ADPr complex ( Table 1) were grown at room temperature by vapor diffusion from hanging drops composed of equal volumes (1 + 1 \u00b5l) of protein solution and crystallization buffer (18% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 3350, 0.1 M HEPES, pH 7.5, and 0.1 M Mg formate) suspended over 1.0 ml of the latter as reservoir solution. Needle-shaped crystals of up to 500 \u00d7 50 \u00d7 50 \u00b5m were transferred into reservoir solution containing 20% (v/v) glycerol and flash frozen in liquid nitrogen. A 1.5-\u00c5 resolution data set at 100 K was recorded at beamline ID-29 of the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (ESRF), Grenoble, France. Processing and scaling were carried out with XDS 36 and Scala 37 .Structure solution and refinement. The structure of the complex was solved with the molecular replacement method as implemented in PHASER (University of Cambridge 38 ), by using the previously determined human MacroD1 npg",
