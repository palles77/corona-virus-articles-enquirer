HBoV-2-4 were mainly identified in stool samples. 6, 7 Homology at the protein level between the four HBoV genotypes is high, between 70 and 90%. 3 HBoV-3 is thought by some to be the result of a recombination event between HBoV-1 and HBoV-2, owing to the similarity of the HBoV-3 NS1 and V1V2 genes to those of HBoV-1 and HBoV-2, respectively. 6 Indeed, HBoV-3 is likely detected along with HBoV-1 during routine diagnostic screening, as the conserved NS1 genes regularly targeted for testing are genetically similar.",

In the absence of an established cell culture system or animal model, the pathogenicity and replication mechanisms of HBoV remain unclear. 5, 18, 19 A recent report suggests that HBoV is, however, a true respiratory pathogen capable of causing sometimes severe, and even life-threatening, illness. 20 Here, we report the findings of the first study investigating the prevalence, seasonality, clinical characteristics and the molecular epidemiology of HBoV in amongst an all-ages population of patients hospitalized for acute lower respiratory illness (ALRI) in Cambodia over 3 consecutive years.",

In parallel, the incidence of HBoV infection amongst Cambodian ILI outpatients and asymptomatic controls was investigated previously, with only one asymptomatic individual testing positive for HBoV DNA. 22 However, persistent and prolonged shedding is a characteristic of parvoviruses, and it is thought that low-level asymptomatic shedding can persist following HBoV infection. 20, 36, 37 Two independent stud-ies reported the HBoV carriage rate to be 43% amongst asymptomatic children, 38 and that the incidence of HBoV amongst asymptomatic children was higher than amongst symptomatic children. 39 However, these two studies were conducted amongst children aged <2 years. Hence, the high carriage rate may have been biased towards the very young age of the sample population with HBoV incidence highest amongst children aged <2 years. 1, 9, 40 Amongst a population of slightly older children, up to 5 years of age, Brieu et al. 36 reported that HBoV DNA was not detected following testing of asymptomatic children. In the absence of an established continuous culture system, it is currently unclear to what extent shedding occurs following HBoV infection, whether shedding and carriage rates amongst children and adults are equivalent, and whether shedding is innocuous or infectious. However, the higher incidence of HBoV infection amongst hospitalised Cambodian ALRI patients observed in this study relative to outpatients with ILI suggests that HBoV infection can result in severe illness.",

Cam2007-E141  ...............................................................................Y............................. . 43 Recently, a severe case of HBoV infection resulting in acute respiratory failure was reported, in which HBoV was the only pathogen detected. 20 The possibility that clinical illness amongst the Cambodian HBoV-infected patients was exacerbated because of bacterial co-infection cannot, however, be excluded as testing for bacterial co-infection could not be performed because of a lack of suitable specimens obtained from young participants. Whether HBoV represents a true pathogen, or an opportunistic co-pathogen, has been the source of much debate. 2, 5 A primary reason that the role of HBoV as a sole pathogenic agent is questioned is that HBoV is commonly detected as a co-infection. Globally, the frequency of HBoV-1 co-infection with other respiratory viruses amongst children with lower respiratory tract infection is reported to be as high as 83%. 4, 5, 44 Furthermore, it has been reported that HBoV coinfection may be higher amongst hospitalised individuals compared with those with mild illness as shedding is potentially enhanced by airway inflammation resulting from coinfection with an additional respiratory pathogen, or that HBoV may play a role in enhancing or aggravating symptoms of existing infections. 5 Mechanisms proposed to explain the high rate of co-infection with other respiratory viruses include that HBoV is either a helper virus, facilitating replication of other respiratory pathogens or that HBoV may require a helper virus to facilitate productive infection. 45 It must also be considered that the more recent widespread use of highly sensitive multiplex assays enabling simultaneous detection of multiple pathogens in a single patient sample may also contribute to the high rate of coinfection with HBoV and additional respiratory pathogens detected. In this study, 44% of patients were co-infected with HBoV and an additional respiratory virus. Regionally, the reported rate of HBoV co-infections varies and does not appear to be particularly associated with hospitalisation: 42% amongst hospitalized children in Singapore, 32 90% amongst out-patient children aged <5 years in rural Thailand, 37 9% amongst hospitalised children in Vietnam. 31 In this study, co-infection with HBoV and HRhV was most frequently detected (Table 3) , analogous to the findings of a similar study conducted amongst paediatric patients in rural Thailand. 37 Whether the high frequency of HBoV and HRhV co-infection is a reflection of the high incidence of HRhV circulating in the general population 2 or whether HRhV co-infection is beneficial to HBoV replication and pathogenesis remains unknown. In the absence of an established cell culture system or animal model, much remains unclear regarding the pathogenesis of HBoV.",

            "text": "All of the HBoV strains obtained from respiratory specimens for analysis in this study were classified as HBoV-1. Globally, HBoV-1 strains have been reported to show low nucleotide and protein diversity; mean genetic diversity <1% at nt and <0AE5% at aa levels. 44 Comparatively, the diversity of HBoV-2, -3 and -4 strains, all identified in stool species, is far greater. 8 The low level of diversity reported worldwide amongst HBoV-1 strains has resulted in speculation that HBoV-1 evolved recently from the enteric bocavirus species, acquiring tropism for cells of the respiratory tract. 8, 46 The organisation of the HBoV genome is similar to that of other Parvoviruses, namely that the non-structural proteins are encoded by conserved genomic regions, whereas diversity is concentrated in regions encoding the capsid proteins. 45 Analysis of amino acid sequences obtained from Cambodian HBoV-1 strains revealed 0-2AE9% nt diversity and 0-3AE4% aa diversity amongst VP1 \u2044 VP2 sequences. Greater variation amongst sequences encoding the VP1 \u2044 VP2 capsid proteins was anticipated as VP1 \u2044 VP2 is under pressure from host immune responses. The level of diversity amongst Cambodian NP1 sequences was 0-1AE1% at the nt level, which is similar to that recently reported by Kapoor et al. 46 Surprisingly, the level of diversity at the aa level amongst NP1 sequences was equivalent to that observed for VP1 \u2044 VP2 sequences, at 0-3AE3%. Five amino acid substitutions were observed amongst Cambodian NP1 aa sequences, including Asn 599 that has been reported previously by Ma et al., 47 following analysis of HBoV-1 NP1 sequences obtained from Japanese children with ALRI. The observed diversity amongst Cambodian NP-1 sequences may have occurred as a result of immune pressure, as it was recently reported that the HBoV non-structural proteins, including NP1, are targeted by humoral responses. 30 The potential impact, if any, of non-synonymous mutations within this conserved region of the HBoV-1 genome remains unclear and warrants further investigation.",
