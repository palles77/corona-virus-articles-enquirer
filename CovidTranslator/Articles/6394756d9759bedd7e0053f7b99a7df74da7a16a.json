However, the remaining two human CoVs cause severe respiratory syndromes and are associated with considerable mortality [1] . In 2003, the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-CoV caused a disease outbreak that claimed nearly 800 lives [2] , and for the second consecutive decade this century, a new human CoV has emerged. The Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS)-CoV was first isolated from a 60-year-old man in Saudi Arabia in June 2012 [3] . Three years later, it has been responsible for the infection of more than 1300 individuals in 26 countries, and more than 480 related deaths [4] .",

The log 10 reduction factors produced by the test products under clean and dirty conditions at each time point are shown in Table 2. With each PVP-I formulation, log 10 reduction in viral titer C4 was demonstrated under clean and dirty conditions after only 15 s with the undiluted and 1:10 dilutions (except for gargle/mouthwash, which, in dirty conditions, required 30 s of exposure at the 1:10 dilution).

One part MERS-CoV suspension (100 lL) was mixed with 100 lL of either 0.3 g/L added to 8 parts (800 lL) of the undiluted test product. After a contact time of 15 s, 20 lL of the test mixture was added to 99.98 mL ice-cold medium. Aliquots (300lL) of the diluted sample were then added to 336 wells containing the indicator cells. The cells were cultivated for 5 days, and then inspected",
