The incidence, clinical presentation and outcome of symptomatic and asymptomatic VRTI in HSCT outpatient unit were prospectively evaluated during a single influenza season (January-March 2011). Pharyngeal swabs were performed at the first visit and if new symptoms were present. Molecular multiplex assay for 12 respiratory viruses was performed by the regional reference laboratory. Among 264 swabs from 193 outpatients, 58 (22 %) resulted positive for 61 viruses (influenza, n =20; respiratory syncytial virus [RSV], n =21; rhinovirus, n =12; coronavirus, n =4; adenovirus, n =3; parainfluenza, n =1). VRTI were detected more frequently in the presence of symptoms than in asymptomatic patients: 49 out of 162 (30 %) vs. 9 out of 102 (9 %), p <0.001. Influenzalike illness syndrome (ILI) was significantly associated with a VRTI if compared to other presentations (42 %), while the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control definition was not (30 %). Positive predictive value (PPV) of ILI for influenza was 17 %. Influenza and RSV peak periods were contemporary. Influenza prophylaxis was given to 25 patients following exposure. Low rate of progression from upper to lower respiratory tract infection (approximately 5 % for influenza and RSV), no nosocomial epidemics and no VRTI-related deaths were observed. VRTI are very frequent in high-risk haematology outpatients, but symptoms are aspecific and PPV of ILI is low. Symptoms of influenza and RSV overlap. Thus, microbiological diagnosis and contact preventive measures are crucial. Rather than universal influenza prophylaxis, prompt diagnosis and treatment of only documented infections could be pursued.",

In immunocompromised patients, VRTI are usually more severe, with an increased risk of progression from upper to lower respiratory tract infections and more frequent presence of bacterial or fungal co-pathogens than in immunocompetent patients [4] [5] [6] [7] . Moreover, long-term sequelae of VRTI, such as restrictive or obstructive airway disease, have been reported [8, 9] . During the last decade, rapid and highly sensitive molecular tests have been developed and made available, with the most recent multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) platform that can detect multiple viral pathogens [10] [11] [12] . Based on data from observational studies, it is believed that most VRTI in patients with haematological malignancies present with fever and/or upper respiratory tract symptoms, while less is known about the asymptomatic circulation of respiratory viruses, even though prolonged viral shedding has been observed [4, [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] .",

Given the higher sensitivity of the CDC RT-PCR system than the Seeplex Kit for detecting A/H1N1p and influenza A viruses in general, throughout this paper, all results pertaining to influenza A virus should be considered to have been obtained by the former method.

Similar results were reported in another prospective observational study, where 25 % of patients had a VRTI, and respiratory viruses were detected more frequently in the presence of symptoms, but symptoms in case of influenza and other VRTI were similar [20] . ECDC definition adapted for the haematology population was even less specific than ILI. In immunocompetent individuals, ILI presentation is considered rather specific for influenza during the epidemic season. In fact, in generally healthy older adolescents and adults living in areas with confirmed influenza virus circulation, estimates of PPV, a simple clinical definition of influenza (acute onset of cough and fever), have been reported to be approximately 80-90 % and empirical anti-influenza treatment was recommended in such conditions [28] [29] [30] [31] . However, even in an immunocompetent population, the accuracy of the clinical diagnosis of influenza on the basis of symptoms alone is being questioned (reported incidence of ILI in patients with influenza, 44-51 %) and is now considered limited because symptoms from illness caused by other pathogens can overlap considerably with influenza [29] . In immunocompromised patients, the association between ILI and influenza is even less pronounced, as systemic symptoms, such as fever or myalgia, are frequently lacking [32] . Therefore, considering the co-circulation of influenza, RSV and rhinoviruses in the same period and the similar clinical presentation of these infections, early use of rapid molecular testing to identify a specific virus, instead of universal empirical treatment with Fig. 2 The distribution of different VRTI anti-influenza drugs in patients with ILI, should be pursued. Initiating antiviral treatment at the onset of symptoms and then discontinuing it after diagnostic tests result negative for influenza is another feasible management strategy.",

However, in this population of immunocompromised patients, of whom <25 % was vaccinated, the incidence of influenza during the epidemic season was only 10 %. Such a low incidence might be a result of a strict isolation policy with daily use of surgical masks and particular attention to hand hygiene, together with a virusspecific attack rate that may vary annually. Additionally, a low progression rate to lower respiratory tract infection and low mortality in all VRTI was observed (approximately 5 %), possibly due to a rapid diagnosis and an early start of an antiviral therapy-usually 24-48 h after the onset of symptoms. Therefore, in a population with low incidence and mortality and in consideration of the possibility of acquiring resistance to antivirals, as reported during the 2009 H1N1 epidemics [33, 34] , an early diagnosis and post-exposure prophylaxis for close contacts seem preferable to a general chemoprophylactic strategy.",

However, they may also detect viral genetic material from a resolved or subclinical infection, and the optimal management of these cases remains unclear. In this cohort, nine asymptomatic subjects had VRTI and isolation measures were applied in all cases, but only one patient was treated for influenza. It has been reported that, in asymptomatic patients, lower quantities of virus might be present [20, 35] and transmission might be improbable, as demonstrated by on observation that no transmission to household contacts occurred in asymptomatic immunocompetent subjects with rhinovirus [36] . Also, in this study, asymptomatic patients did not subsequently develop any clinical symptoms.",

The limitations are a single-centre experience and a short observation period, which did not include the last weeks of 2010 when some infections could occur. Thus, data on the incidence cannot be extrapolated to other populations or seasons. Additionally, the sensitivity of detection of respiratory viruses may vary for oropharyngeal and nasopharyngeal specimens [37] . Although, nasopharyngeal aspirates may be the most sensitive, especially for conventional diagnostic methods, less invasive specimen collection techniques are also acceptable given the very high sensitivity of new molecular diagnostic methods [37] , while recent guidelines recommend combined intranasal sampling using flocked swabs and the pharyngeal swabs in one virus transport medium [25] . Finally, other centres with different management strategies for outpatients, including different contact prevention measures, might experience different rates of nosocomial transmission or morbidity.",

When evaluating the predictive value of ILI for the diagnosis of influenza in symptomatic patients during the epidemic season, only 17 % (11 out of 65) of cases presenting with ILI had influenza.
