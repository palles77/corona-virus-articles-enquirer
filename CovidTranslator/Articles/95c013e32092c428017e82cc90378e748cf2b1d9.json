[3] [4] [5] The bacteria that most commonly cause UTIs are similar in dogs and cats (Fig. 1) . 3, [6] [7] [8] Escherichia coli is most common, followed by gram-positive cocci, and then various others, including Proteus, Klebsiella, Pasteurella, Pseudomonas, Corynebacterium, and several other rarely reported genera. 3, 6 Mycoplasma spp are isolated from urine of dogs with clinical signs of lower urinary tract in less than 5% of samples; whether Mycoplasma spp are associated with urinary tract disease in cats is controversial. 3, [9] [10] [11] Cats may be infected with a unique strain of Staphylococcus, Staphylococcus felis, and commercial phenotypic identification systems may not differentiate between S felis and other coagulase-negative Staphylococcus spp. 7, 8 One study found that S felis was the third most common isolate based on 16S rDNA sequencing (n 5 25/ 106, 19 .8% of bacterial isolates cultured), suggesting S felis is the most common Staphylococcal species causing UTI in cats. 7 ",

Bacterial pyelonephritis may be associated with hematuria only.",

            "text": "In addition to clinical signs, results of a complete urinalysis may provide evidence of a bacterial UTI. Hematuria, pyuria, and bacteriuria are often present unless there is suppression of immune response because of underlying disease or drugs (Fig. 5 ). Microscopic examination of unstained urine sediment is less sensitive and specific than examining urine sediment stained with a modified Wright stain. 22 A positive urine culture is the \"gold standard\" for diagnosing bacterial UTI. A quantitative urine culture includes isolation and identification of the organism and determination of the number of bacteria (colony-forming units per unit volume). Quantitation of bacteria enables interpretation as to the significance of bacteria present in a urine sample. Caution should be exercised when interpreting quantitative urine cultures obtained by midstream voiding or manual expression of urine. 21 Determining whether an infection is uncomplicated or complicated is essential to guide the diagnostic and therapeutic plan. A simple uncomplicated UTI occurs sporadically in an otherwise healthy animal with a normal structural and functional urinary tract. 23 In contrast, infections are complicated if there is (1) involvement of the upper urinary tract and/or prostate, (2) an underlying comorbidity that alters the structure or function of the urinary tract, such as an endocrinopathy or chronic kidney disease (CKD), or (3) recurrent infection. 23, 24 Recurrent infections are further categorized as relapsing, refractory/persistent, reinfection, or superinfection ( Table 1) . 23, 24 Most cats with bacterial UTI have complicated infections. 21 Additional laboratory testing and imaging studies are often required for complicated infections (Box 2). 21 Pyelonephritis Pyelonephritis is an example of a complicated UTI. Diagnosis of pyelonephritis is usually presumptive based on positive urine culture, concurrent consistent renal diagnostic imaging abnormalities (eg, pyelectasia), and possible improvement in degree of azotemia following antimicrobial therapy. Although a positive culture is helpful for the diagnosis, a negative urine culture does not rule out pyelonephritis.",

Abdominal radiographs and ultrasound are useful to determine the size, shape, location, and architecture of the prostate as well as if any cysts or abscesses are present (see Fig. 3A ). 14 Prostatic fluid should be evaluated for cytology and bacterial culture and sensitivity (see Fig. 3B ). Options for prostatic fluid sampling are discussed elsewhere, but include semen evaluation of the third fraction, prostatic wash, fine-needle aspiration, and prostatic biopsy. 14 Catheter-associated urinary tract infection There is no evidence to support routine urine culture or culture of the urinary catheter tip following removal in asymptomatic patients; such cultures do not predict the development of catheter-associated infection. 23 In contrast, urine culture is always indicated for a patient with clinical signs of UTI, fever of undetermined origin, or abnormal urine cytology (ie, hematuria, pyuria). If the patient develops new clinical signs or fever after a urinary catheter has been placed, then, ideally, the urine catheter is removed and a cystocentesis is performed to provide a sample for culture once the bladder fills. Alternatively, the original urinary catheter is replaced and a urine sample is collected through the second catheter. It is less ideal to sample the urine through the original catheter, and a sample from the collection bag should never be used. 23 Asymptomatic bacteriuria Asymptomatic bacteriuria (AB) is a common and often benign finding in healthy women. Risk factors include pregnancy, diabetes mellitus, spinal cord injury, indwelling urinary catheter, and being an elderly nursing home resident. 25 Women with AB have more frequent symptomatic episodes, but antimicrobial treatment does not decrease the number of episodes. A benefit to treatment has not been found with clinical trials in humans, whereas potential complications include adverse drug reactions and the development of antimicrobial resistance. 25 The prevalence of AB in healthy dogs and cats is low (2%-9%). [26] [27] [28] [29] Animals with underlying comorbidities, such as hyperthyroidism, diabetes mellitus, or CKD, or recurrent infection have increased prevalence of AB, up to 30% 29-33 and 50%, 34 respectively. There are no prospective studies comparing clinical outcome in veterinary patients with or without antimicrobial treatment of AB. In one recent prospective study of dogs with AB, 50% had transient colonization and 50% had persistent bacteriuria over a 3-month time period; no dog developed clinical signs at any time point. 27 Similar to general recommendation in humans, treatment is not recommended for AB unless there is a high risk for ascending or systemic infection (eg, immunocompromised patients, CKD). 23 ",

Probiotics restore Lactobacillus sp vaginal flora and displace potential uropathogens from the vagina. 48 Two studies in dogs have evaluated vaginal microflora before and after probiotic administration and found no significant differences. 53, 54 However, more prospective studies are needed to evaluate the role of probiotics for lower urinary tract disease in veterinary species. Probiotics on the market vary by bacterial species, potency (number of colony-forming units), and viability.

Prophylactic antimicrobial therapy for recurrent infection There are no good studies evaluating pulse (intermittent) or chronic low-dose prophylactic antimicrobial therapy in animals with frequent reinfections, but anecdotally, some animals may benefit (Box 3). Careful patient selection is required and the impact of promoting antimicrobial resistance should be considered. Before prophylactic treatment is undertaken, urine culture and susceptibility testing should be done to ensure that the bacterial UTI has been eradicated. For long-term prophylaxis, a drug that is excreted in high concentration in urine and unlikely to cause adverse effects is selected. Often a fluoroquinolone, cephalosporin, or a b-lactam antimicrobial is chosen. The antimicrobial agent is administered at approximately one-third of the therapeutic daily dose immediately after the patient has voided, at a time when the drug and its metabolites will be retained in the urinary tract for 6 to 8 hours (typically at night). The drug is given for a minimum of 6 months. Urine samples, preferably collected by cystocentesis (not by catheterization because this may induce bacterial UTI), are collected every 4 to 8 weeks for urinalysis and quantitative urine culture. If the sample is free of infection, then prophylactic treatment is continued. If bacterial UTI is identified, active (breakthrough) infection is treated as a complicated bacterial UTI before returning to a prophylactic strategy. If a breakthrough bacterial UTI does not occur after 6 months of prophylactic antimicrobial therapy, then treatment may be discontinued and the patient should be monitored for reinfection.",

However, in meta-analysis (n 5 1049), humans supplemented with cranberry products had less UTI over a 12-month period compared with placebo. 59 There are few veterinary studies in healthy dogs and no feline studies. 60, 61 In addition, quality and potency are variable among over-the-counter products; ideally each Urinary Tract Infections formulation would be tested in the species of interest. The Consensus of the Antimicrobial Guidelines Working Group of the International Society for Companion Animal Infectious Diseases is that there is insufficient evidence to support use of cranberry extract to prevent recurrent UTIs in dogs and cats. 23 Local therapy Local infusions with antimicrobials, antiseptics, and dimethyl sulfoxide can be irritating and are not retained within the urinary bladder. 23 Anecdotally, instillation of dilute chlorhexidine (1:100, 0.02%) and/or ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA)-tromethamine (EDTA-Tris) 62 via cystotomy tube may decrease the incidence of bacterial UTI (Bartges JW, personal communication, Knoxville, TN, 2014) . In a small human study, bladder irrigation with dilute 0.02% chlorhexidine significantly decreased postoperative bacteriuria, although it did not eliminate pre-existing infection and did not appear to damage the bladder mucosa. 63 It has been postulated that EDTA-Tris has synergistic effects with systemic antimicrobials 64 as well as local chlorhexidine irrigation. 63 Proposed mechanisms included divalent ion binding causing alteration of bacterial DNA synthesis, cell wall permeability, and ribosomal stability. In additional, in vitro studies suggest that the presence of EDTA-Tris reduces the minimum inhibitory concentration for various antimicrobial drugs. 64 In a small study (n 517 dogs, n 5 4 with chronic cystitis) daily local infusion via sterile urinary catheter (25 mL EDTA at 37 C) for 7 days was well tolerated and dogs had negative urine cultures up to 180 days after treatment. 64 Additional studies are needed to determine the short-and long-term effects of EDTA-Tris therapy.",

[66] [67] [68] A biofilm is composed of organisms adhered together by a selfproduced polysaccharide matrix. 66 It has been suggested that the bacteria within the biofilm become sessile; they are protected from the immune system, are antimicrobial, and inherently are resistant to shear forces of removal. 66 In humans, bacteria with the capacity to produce biofilms have been associated with AB. 65, 66 Biofilms are also implemented in the development of catheter-associated UTI. 69 Strategies to prevent catheter-associated biofilms include using (1) materials that are less amendable to biofilm formation and (2) coatings or surface modifications that decrease biofilm formation. For example, silicone catheters are preferred over latex because scanning electron microscope imaging reveals that latex surfaces are more irregular and promote microbial adherence. 49 An example of an agent used for catheter coating is the antiseptic chlorihexidine. In a veterinary prospective study (n 5 26 dogs) evaluating biofilm formation on indwelling urinary catheters, sustained-release varnish of chlorihexidine-coated urinary catheters statistically decreased biofilm formation. 69 There are an array of other catheter coatings and modifications to decrease bacterial adherence and biofilm formation that have primarily been studied in a research setting, including silver coating, nanoparticles, iontophoresis, antimicrobials, urease and other enzyme inhibitors, liposomes, and bacteriophages. Other novel strategies include quorum sensing inhibitors and vibroacoustic stimulation (Box 4). A detailed discussion of comparison is beyond the scope of this article and the reader is referred elsewhere. 49 Some oral antimicrobials, in particular combination therapy with clarithromycin, have shown promise in vitro for antibiofilm activity. For example, Pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilm was eliminated by a synergistic combination of clarithromycin and ciprofloxacin. 70 Likewise, combination therapy of clarithromycin with fosfomycin was more effective than either treatment alone to reduce Staphylococcus pseudintermedius biofilm. 71 In vivo studies are needed to further evaluate the efficacy of these therapies.",

Excreted in urine predominantly in active form if normal renal function is present. Ineffective against b-lactamase-producing bacteria.Amikacin Dogs: 15-30 mg/kg q24h, IV/IM/SC Cats: 10-14 mg/kg q24h, IV/IM/SC Not recommended for routine use but may be useful for treatment of multidrugresistant organisms. Potentially nephrotoxic. Avoid in animals with renal insufficiency. Not established whether there is any advantage over amoxicillin alone. Ampicillin Not recommended because of poor oral bioavailability. Amoxicillin is preferred. Should only be used in situations where oral treatment is problematic. Enterococci are resistant. Pharmacokinetic data are available to support the use in dogs and cats, with a duration of 14 d (dogs) and 21 d (cats). The long duration of excretion in the urine makes it difficult to interpret posttreatment culture results. SC Approved for treatment of UTIs in dogs in some regions. Enterococci are resistant. Reserved for multidrug-resistant infections with few other options. Myelosuppression can occur, particularly with long-term therapy. Avoid contact by humans because of rare idiosyncratic aplastic anemia. Ciprofloxacin 30 mg/kg q24h, PO Sometimes used because of lower cost than enrofloxacin. Lower and more variable oral bioavailability than enrofloxacin, marbofloxacin, and orbifloxacin. Difficult to justify over approved fluoroquinolones. Dosing recommendations are empirical. PO Highly metabolized and excreted through intestinal tract, so urine levels may be low. Not recommended for routine uses. Excreted in urine predominantly in active form. Reserve for documented resistant UTIs but good first-line choice for pyelonephritis (dogs 20 mg/kg PO q24h). Limited efficacy against enterococci. Associated with risk of retinopathy in cats. Do not exceed 5 mg/kg/d of enrofloxacin in cats. Imipenem-cilastatin 5 mg/kg q6-8h, IV/IM Reserve for treatment of multidrug-resistant infections, particularly those caused by Enterobacteriaceae or P aeruginosa. Recommend consultation with a urinary or infectious disease veterinary specialist or veterinary pharmacologist before use. PO Excreted in urine predominantly in active form.
