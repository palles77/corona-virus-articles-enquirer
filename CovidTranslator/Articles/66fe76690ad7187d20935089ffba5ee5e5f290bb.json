The diagnosis of CCV infection relies on either demonstration of the virus by electron microscopy or by virus isolation. For the latter technique to be successful requires good survival of CCV in faeces. Although coronaviruses in general show moderate stability at temperatures below 4\u00b0C (McIntosh, 1974; Pensaert and Callebaut, 1978; Siddell et al., 1983) , feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV), a closely related virus to CCV, is reported to be more labile (Stoddart, 1985) . The survival of CCV at various temperatures and the effect of routine laboratory handling and storage on the infectivity of CCV has not previously been described. Thus, the aim of this paper is to investigate the survival of CCV under various conditions and to determine optimal storage conditions for field and experimental samples.",

All solutions also contained 10% foetal calf serum, 0.067 mg/ml benzyl penicillin, 0.11 mg/ml streptomycin sulphate and 0.0022 mg/ml amphotericin B. One ml aliquots made from each of these samples were stored at either 20\u00b0C, 4\u00b0C, -20\u00b0C or -70\u00b0C, whilst one ml aliquots of CCV in growth media were also stored at 37\u00b0C, for variable periods of time. Three bijou containing virus in growth media were subject to one, three or six freeze thaw cycles (frozen at -70\u00b0C and thawed at 37\u00b0C). A second experiment was performed to investigate the effect of dilution of faecal samples on the survival of CCV. Thus, CCV-C54 was mixed with a faecal suspension as described above. Ten-fold dilutions, of the CCV-C54 infected faecal suspension, were made in Wellcome growth media. Duplicate dilutions were stored at either 4\u00b0C or 20\u00b0C for variable periods of time. The viral titres in all aliquots were then determined as previously described (Tennant et al., 1991b) .",

The pattern of virus survival was similar for growth medium and VTM at all temperatures although the former tended to be marginally superior. The lower the temperature of storage then the greater the retention of infectivity. Viral titre was rapidly lost at 37\u00b0C in growth medium, with a drop in virus infectivity from the initial titre of 10 5.3 TCIDso/ ml to zero by 13 hours (Fig. la) . At 20\u00b0C, in growth medium and VTM, virus infectivity declined more slowly, but there was at least a 102 reduction in titre by 48 hours (Fig. lb) . At 4\u00b0C little loss in titre was seen in either growth medium or VTM up to 72 hours ( (Fig. le) by 3 months. Almost complete retention of viral infectivity was demonstrated following six consecutive freeze-thaw cycles. The CCV titre decreased from 10 5.3 TCIDso/ml initially to 105 TCIDso/ml after the sixth freeze-thaw cycle (Fig. 2) .",

Thus, infectivity was retained after several days at 4\u00b0C, and for at least 2 years at -20\u00b0C or -70\u00b0C, when stored in growth media or VTM. However, the virus tended to lose infectivity rapidly at 37\u00b0C and over several days at room temperature. The longer survival of CCV in A-72 media and VTM, compared with faecal suspension, is probably attributable in part to the pH or presence of ions and colloids in faeces which may inactivate the virus. The inclusion of foetal calf serum in the faecal suspension appeared not to substantially affect virus survival.",
