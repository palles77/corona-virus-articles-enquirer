Moreover, such a diagnostic tool will help with preventing 53 spread of virus by identifying the infected cases and can monitor the health status of infected patients 54 by quantifying the viral load. Center for Disease Control was the first to develop a quantitative 55 reverse transcriptase real-time PCR (RT-PCR), which later became the gold standard technique 56 (https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/about/testing.html). Subsequently, a Chinese group 57 used a RNA-based metagenomics next generation sequencing (mNGS) to diagnose the viral RNA 58 from the clinical samples of two patients (3). However, the requirement for advanced technology and 59 skilled personnel and long turn-around time (24 hours) are not feasible for local and referral 60 laboratories. Therefore, a colorimetric loop mediated isothermal amplification, also known as LAMP, 61 was developed to obviate the need for expensive technologies, e.g. real-time PCR and NGS, as well 62 as to shorten the turn-around time to up to 40 minutes (4). However, this assay was a qualitative one 63 and also only the swab samples from limited number of patients (n=7) were included for testing (4). 64",

In total, 168 patients from center 1, among which 35 confirmed 156 COVID-19 cases, and 92 patients from center 2, among which 12 patients were confirmed COVID-157 19 cases, were recruited. One asymptomatic patient tested positive by qRT-PCR (Ct values 37) and 158 by our RT-LAMP was categorized suspected by in-charge physician and few days later became 159 positive. Four patients tested positive by qRT-PCR were negative by our RT-LAMP and one patient 160 tested negative by qRT-PCR was positive by our assay (Figure 1 and Supplementary Table 1) . 161",
