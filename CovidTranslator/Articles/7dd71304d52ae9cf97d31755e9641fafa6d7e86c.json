In this study we investigated the effect of direct addition of exogenous human apoD protein purified from breast cystic fluid to rat hippocampal slice cultures after excitotoxic injury induced by the glutamate analog kainate. ApoD at a concentration of 10 g/ml partially prevented loss of MAP2 immunostaining and LDH release from injured hippocampal neurons after kainate injury. ApoD also attenuated the increase in oxidative products of arachidonic acid and cholesterol, F 2 -isoprostanes and 7-ketocholesterol, respectively, after kainate treatment. In view of the molecular structure of apoD which consists of an eight stranded \u2424 barrel that forms a binding pocket for a number of small hydrophobic molecules, we propose that apoD promotes its neuroprotective effects by binding to arachidonic acid and cholesterol thus preventing their oxidation to neurotoxic products such as 4-hydroxynonenal (4-HNE) and 7-ketocholesterol.",

It however, does not share sequence similarity with other apolipoproteins, but instead is a member of the lipocalin superfamily of proteins which share a conserved tertiary structure and function in the transport of small hydrophobic ligands. The molecular structure of apoD consists of an eight-stranded \u2424 barrel (\u2424-clam) that forms a binding pocket suitable for a number of small hydrophobic molecules including arachidonic acid, cholesterol and progesterone [8, 15, 20, 21] . Apolipoprotein D is the major protein component in cyst fluid from women with human breast gross cystic disease [1] . Its expression has been shown to be increased in the brain in patients with Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease or schizophrenia [19, 26, 28] , and animal models of Niemann-Pick type C disease, transmissible spongiform encephalopathy, ischemic stroke and excitotoxic injury [5, 18, 22, 25] .",

            "text": "Recent studies indicate that apoD has an important function as a neuroprotective and antioxidant protein. In a screen to identify genes that protect Drosophila against acute oxidative stress, a fly homolog of apoD, glial lazarillo (Glaz) was identified. Overexpression of Glaz resulted in increased resistance to hyperoxia as well as a 29% extension of lifespan under nomoxia [30] . In contrast, the absence of Glaz reduces the organism's resistance to oxidative stress and starvation and shortens male lifespan. Glaz mutants also have a higher concentration of lipid peroxidation products, pointing to a role of lipid peroxidation protection or scavenging as the mechanism of action of this lipocalin [23] . Furthermore, flies that express the human form of apoD are long lived and protected against stress conditions associated with aging and neurodegeneration, including hyperoxia, dietary paraquat and heat stress [16] . Similar findings to those observed in Drosophila have been noted in vertebrates and even plants. Loss of mouse apoD function increases the sensitivity to oxidation stress and the levels of brain lipid peroxidation, and impairs locomotor and learning abilities [9] . In contrast, human apoD overexpression in the mouse brain produces opposite effects, increasing survival and preventing the rise of brain lipid peroxides after oxidant treatment [9] . ApoD has also been shown to provide resistance against coronavirus infections in mice [6] . Plants that overexpress apoD, likewise, show increased resistance to oxidative stress [4] . Cellular stresses that either cause extended growth arrest, such as hydrogen peroxide and UV light, or increase in proliferation, such as lipopolysaccharide treatment were found to increase apoD production in vitro. At the promoter level, NFkB, AP-1 and APRE-3 proved to be the elements implicated in the lipopolysaccharide response [7] .",

The hippocampi were dissected out, and sectioned transversely at 350 M thickness using a tissue chopper.

The slices were maintained at 37 \u2022 C, 100% humidity and 95% air and 5% CO 2 . The medium was changed to fresh medium every 3 days in culture. The effects of kainate and other agents were tested in hippocampal cultures after 14 days in vitro. The cultures were treated with KA (100 M) for 3 h in serum free culture medium. The above dose and duration of kainate treatment has been shown to be toxic to neurons in hippocampal slices [13] .",

An 8-16 fold increase in apoD protein concentration is present in the hippocampus after entorhinal cortex lesions [27] , and increased apoD immunoreactivity is found in hippocampal pyramidal neurons after kainate induced excitotoxicity in rats [18] . In view of the range of brain and CSF apoD concentrations in health and disease, we chose 1-10 g/ml as the concentration to test in our experiments. Human apoD protein in these experiments was prepared as previously described [20] . Human breast cystic fluid was centrifuged at 35,000 \u00d7 g for 2 h, followed by dialysis of the aqueous phase against K 2 HPO 4 10 mM pH 7.4, and hydroxyapatite in same buffer.

The color reaction was stopped with several washes of Tris buffer, followed by PBS. The slices were mounted on gelatin-coated glass slides and counterstained with methyl green before coverslipping with Permount. The number of MAP2 positive neuronal cells in the CA fields of the hippocampal slices was counted in a \"blind\" manner on coded slides at 200\u00d7 magnification with the help of a grid. At least six slices were quantified for each treatment. The mean number of stained cells/mm 2 was then calculated for each treatment, and the results were subjected to statistical analyses, using one-way ANOVA with Bonferroni's multiple comparison post-hoc test.

No protective effect was observed after addition of BSA ( Fig. 1B and C) . Together, these findings indicate a neuroprotective effect of apoD after kainate induced excitotoxicity that might be related to its ability to prevent the formation of lipid oxidation products. The above results are consistent with recent reports that showed that loss of mouse apoD function increases the sensitivity to oxidation stress and the levels of brain lipid peroxidation. In contrast, human apoD overexpression in the mouse brain produces opposite effects increasing survival and pre-venting the raise of brain lipid peroxides after oxidant treatment [9] . ApoD has also been shown to provide resistance against coronavirus infections in mice [6] .",

In view of the molecular structure of apoD which consists of an eight-stranded \u2424 barrel (\u2424-clam) that forms a binding pocket form a number of small hydrophobic molecules, we propose that apoD is neuroprotective by binding to arachidonic acid and cholesterol thus preventing their oxidation to neurotoxic products such as 4-hydroxynonenal (4-HNE) [2] and 7-ketocholesterol [3, 10, 17] . The binding of apoD with arachidonic acid and cholesterol may also facilitate lipid transport mechanisms related to repair processes following KA-mediated toxicity. Further studies are necessary to elucidate factors that regulate the expression of apoD after neuronal injury.",
