This objective is becoming more attainable through the co-evolution of gene transfer vectors and regulation systems. The ideal vector should efficiently transduce non-dividing cells with minimal toxicity, thus endowing the system with persistent transgene expression. The helper-dependent adenovirus vectors meet these requirements, as demonstrated in various studies in the literature. The most promising regulation system is the tet-on system, which has low basal transcriptional activity and high inducibility. To explore the regulated transgene expression in the context of a helper-dependent vector, we constructed the HD-TET-IFN vector, containing the mIFN\u2423 gene under the control of the tetracycline Expression of mIFN\u2423 in immunocompetent mice L Aurisicchio et al",

Among the viral vectors, adenovirus (Ad) vectors deliver genes to a wide variety of cell types and tissue independently of their proliferative state (reviewed in Ref. 1 ). These vectors have been modified by introducing deletions in the early genes to increase cloning capacity and reduce cellular toxicity. 2 However, these modifications have not lead to a prolonged transgene expression in rodents and nonhuman primates, indicating that residual low level expression of Ad genes is responsible, at least in part, for the short-term persistence. The 'gutless' or helper-dependent adenovirus vector (HD) allowed transgene expression to persist for almost the entire lifetime of mouse as shown in liver, brain and muscle. [3] [4] [5] These vectors lack all viral coding sequences and are produced by the co-infection of a suitable cell line with an Ad helper virus, which provides in trans the proteins required for replication and packaging. 6, 7 In light of the extensive cloning capacity (35 kb) and the persistence of expression in many cell types, HD vectors are ideal vectors for studying gene functions in the absence of interfering viral promoters, undesired expression of potentially toxic Ad genes, and reduced immune response against Ad proteins.",

            "text": "To achieve safe and effective protein expression, pharmacological control over the level of gene transcription is required. Placing gene activity under control from outside via an effector molecule allows the activity to be limited within a 'desired window'. Thus expression can be adjusted according to the evolution of induced biological effects, and treatment to be terminated by drug withdrawal. Different systems based on small-molecule control of transcription have been developed and proven to be effective in mice. The rapamycin-regulated system (RRS) uses a 'dimerizer' drug to bring together the functional units of a bipartite transcriptional factor. 8 A different chimeric system is based on the progesteron antagonist, RU486. An HD vector expressing human growth hormone (hGH) under control of the RU486-inducible system was very effective both in controlling hGH expression and in inducing a biological response for a limited period of time. 9 The Tet systems, widely applied both in vitro and in vivo, have been derived from elements of the tetracycline (Tc) resistance operon of Escherichia coli which were converted into eukaryotic transcription activation systems. 10 In one version a Tet-controlled trans-activator (tTA), a fusion between the Tet repressor protein (TetR) and a eukaryotic transcription activation domain, binds to tet operator sequences fused to a minimal promoter and activates transcription in the absence of Tc. 11 Addition of Tc, or one of its derivative such as doxycycline (Dox), abolishes transcription. In a second version, a mutated form of tTA, rtTA, binds and activates transcription only in the presence of Dox. 12 Both Tet systems were used in gene therapy models whereby a variety of vectors were applied: retroviruses, adenoassociated virus (AAV) binary systems, first generation adenoviruses, and electroporated DNA. 8, [13] [14] [15] Despite numerous successful applications, the Tet regulatory systems originally described show some limitations. rtTA exhibits some residual affinity to tetO in the absence of Dox and requires relatively high levels of Dox to achieve full activation. In addition, rtTA and possibly its mRNA are rather susceptible to degradation, at least in certain cell types. These limitations were overcome by novel rtTA versions, which were identified via mutagenesis and genetic selection in yeast. The new transactivator species such as rtTA s -S2, which were subsequently embedded in synthetic sequences designed to optimize expression in mammals, showed drastic improvements in all parameters mentioned above. 16 Pharmacological control of gene expression may be critical in those applications utilizing pleiotropic cytokines such as IFN\u2423, which is currently used in the treatment of viral hepatitis. A more effective antiviral treatment against HBV infection was obtained by introducing asialoglycoprotein binding sites in the recombinant IFN\u2423, which in turn led to higher intrahepatic concentrations. 17 IFN\u2423 gene transfer may offer the possibility of limiting IFN\u2423 expression to the liver, 18, 19 with a potential reduction of side-effects in other tissues, such as the central nervous system, provided that transgene expression is kept within safe and therapeutic levels. The antiviral IFN\u2423 action is thought to be mediated by transcriptional activation of many genes including 2',5'-oligoadenylate synthetase (2'5'OAS) and GTPase such as TGTP. 20 In this report, the features of regulated mIFN\u2423 expression are explored utilizing the novel rtTA2 s -S2 transactivator carried in a single HD vector, HD-TET-IFN. The efficacy of a Dox-regulated expression of mIFN\u2423 was verified in a murine model of acute hepatitis. Liver protection was dependent only on activation of mIFN\u2423 expression induced by Dox treatment. Secretion of the cytokine was repeatedly re-induced to the same high level for a period of 3 months, and controlled by the amount of Dox delivered. In addition, C57/B6 mice injected at low HD-TET-IFN doses resulted in Doxmediated regulation of liver restricted mIFN\u2423 expression, which was associated with induction of antiviral genes. These results indicate that desired levels of mIFN\u2423 expression can be achieved and maintained by controlling both the vector dosage and the transcriptional activity.",

The tetracycline-sensitive transactivator rtTA2 s -S2 was cloned under the liver-specific TTR promoter and enhancer followed by the SV40 polyadenylation signal. mIFN\u24232 gene was inserted in the opposite orientation under the control of the P tet-1 promoter, 10 followed by the bGH polyadenylation signal. To increase mRNAs stability, two introns were inserted upstream of the transactivator and of the mIFN\u2423 gene, respectively. The expression cassette was inserted in the helper-dependent backbone vector C4HSU generating pHD-TET-IFN plasmid and the HD-TET-IFN vector was rescued and amplified in 293cre cells using the H14 helper virus. 21 To compare in vitro the potency of mIFN\u2423 expression mediated by HD-TET-IFN or HD-IFN, which expresses mIFN\u24232 directly under the TTR promoter, Hep3B cells were treated with 50 pp/cell and mIFN\u24232 released in the medium was measured at day 2 p.i. (Figure 1b) . In HD-TET-IFN-treated cells 200-fold Dox-dependent induction of mIFN\u2423 production was observed. Lower values were observed in HD-IFNtreated cells. To visualize the cells which expressed mIFN\u2423 as a function of the vector dose, Hep3B were treated with increasing amounts of HD-TET-IFN and mIFN\u2423 expression revealed by an immunohistochemistry assay. A dose-response correlation was observed between the vector dose and the cells stained with an anti-mIFN\u2423 antibody only in Dox-treated cells, whereas no positive staining was observed in the absence of Dox even in cells treated with HD-TET-IFN at the highest doses of 1000 pp/cell ( Figure 2 ).

At a concentration of 200 g/ml, serum mIFN\u2423 was in the range of 4000 U/ml, whereas at 20 g/ml it was 10-30 U/ml. At the lowest Dox concentration, serum mIFN\u2423 was detectable only with the more sensitive, albeit not quantitative ELISA assay.

For this purpose, we examined the effects of HD-TET-IFN on the infection of susceptible mouse strain C57/Bl6 with mouse coronavirus MHV-3. Treatment with recombinant mIFN-\u2424 type I was shown to prolong survival following MHV-2 exposure, particularly when the treatment was initiated before viral infection. 23, 24 Mice were injected i.v. with 1 \u00d7 10 10 pp of HD-TET-IFN and mIFN\u2423 induction measured at day 14 and 21 p.i. As expected, in all injected mice treated with Dox in the drinking water at a concentration of 200 g/ml for 3 days, circulating mIFN\u24232 was observed in the range of 1900 U/ml and returned to basal level 3 days after Dox withdrawl. At day 40 p.i., a subgroup of mice were reinduced with Dox in the same condition described above, and all mice were infected at day 42 with an i.p. injection of 200 p.f.u. of MHV-3. To verify the impact of mIFN\u24232 Gene Therapy induction on MHV-3-mediated liver damage, transaminase (ALT) present in the serum were measured 3 days after MHV-3 infection (Figure 6a ). Hepatic protection was observed in mice pre-induced with Dox, where serum transaminase levels remained at basal levels. However, a sharp rise in serum ALT levels was observed in mice injected with HD-TET-IFN and not treated with Dox or in control mice (mock). An additional effect, observed only in Dox-treated mice, was a slight but significant prolonged mean survival time (P \u03fd 0.008581). As shown in Figure 6b , control mice and those not treated with Dox died between day 3 and 4 after MHV-3 infection, whereas in the Dox-treated group one out of six survived till day 21 when the experiment was terminated (mean survival time \u00b1 standard deviation: mock 4 \u00b1 0 days; no Dox 3.8 \u00b1 0.37; Dox 5.8 \u00b1 0.83).",

In C57/B6 mice injected with low vector doses (1.4 \u00d7 10 9 pp and 2.8 \u00d7 10 9 pp) and not treated with Dox, mIFN\u2423 was detected neither in the liver, nor in the serum. However, liverrestricted mIFN\u2423 in the range of 60-120 U/g was observed upon induction depending on the vector dose. Higher HD-TET-IFN dose (4.4 \u00d7 10 10 pp), in the absence of Dox treatment, resulted in 100 U/g of mIFN\u2423 present in the liver, but not in the serum. After Dox treatment mIFN\u2423 levels increased 100-fold in the liver and 1000fold in the serum. These levels returned to background upon Dox withdrawal 3 days later (data not shown). In Balb/C mice, where Ad is less persistent, 25 liver-restricted mIFN\u2423 was induced only at a virus dose of 4.4 \u00d7 10 10 pp, whereas at lower vector doses the cytokine was undetectable. The HD-TET-IFN doses that resulted in liver-restricted mIFN\u2423 expression were further analyzed for the induction of mIFN\u2423 responsive genes (Figure 7b ). In agreement with the presence of mIFN\u2423 protein, Northern blot analysis showed a clear signal for the mIFN\u2423 mRNA in both C57/B6 and Balb/C only in Dox-treated mice (lane A). As a consequence of mIFN\u2423 expression, 2'5'OAS and TGTP transcripts were elevated, as indicated by the RNase protection assay (lanes C and D). A 7.6-and three-fold induction of 2'5'OAS signal was observed at the highest HD-TET-IFN dose indicated in Balb/C and C57/B6, respectively. When compared with 2'5'OAS, the induction of TGTP over the background was less pronounced. To examine the reversal of induction of antiviral gene activities, 2'5'OAS and TGTP transcripts were examined 3 days after Dox withdrawal. At this time point, in C57/B6 mice injected with 2.8 \u00d7 10 9 pp previously induced with Dox, mRNA synthesis from antiviral genes had returned to basal level.

The rapid adjustment of the activity of a therapeutic gene to the progression of the diseases is of particular importance. The HD-TET-IFN vector meets several of these requirements. Injecting large doses (1.4 \u00d7 10 10 pp) in C57/B6 mice resulted in undetectable serum levels of mIFN\u2423 in the absence of Dox (Figure 3 ). Upon induction with Dox, mIFN\u2423 was detected in the serum and its expression correlated with the amount of Dox delivered to the animal (Figure 4 ). High levels of secreted mIFN\u2423 were observed at the largest dose of Dox, with only slight variations over a period of 3 months. Although the rapid induction of secreted cytokines has already been widely reported, the rapid reversal of mIFN\u2423 induction represents a major improvement over the previously described systems. The rapamycin system, which was explored in the context of Ad or AAV vectors, demonstrated rapid induction of hGH and controlled expression over a wide range of doses. 27 However, hGH remained above the basal levels for up to 12 days after a single injection of the inducer. Similar slow de-induction kinetics were observed in the brains of rats using the Tet-off system delivered by a first generation Ad vector. 8 Improved reversal of induction was reported, 9 with the RU486 regulation system carried on a HD vector and driven by the same TTR promoter used in this study. Interestingly, Burcin et al 9 observed a similarly inefficient induction of their reporter gene at an early stage after HD injection, as did our system. Further experiments are required to understand why 2 weeks appear to be required to reach steady state expression. Since full induction of Tet-controlled genes is achieved within less than 8 h in the liver of transgenic mice, 28 other factors such as the immuno-response against Ad particles may have a detrimental effect on transcription at this early stage. One limitation of the actual rtTA2 s -S2 based system is its poor sensitivity to Dox, which in our experimental conditions was not saturated using 20 mg/kg ( Figure 5 ). However, in parallel with rtTA2 s -S2, the rtTA2 s -M2 transactivator was developed, which shows a 10-fold higher sensitivity to Dox in HeLa cells. It will be interesting to explore this additional transactivator in the context of HD vectors, which may bring the Dox required within the dose range of human antibiotic therapy.",

            "text": "Apparently, the long persistence and sustained reinducibility of mIFN\u2423 expression (Figure 3 ) in immuno- competent mice indicates that the rtTA2 s -S2 transactivator is not immunogenic, although we presume that the use of a liver-specific promoter such as TTR, which expressed the transactivator only in hepatic cells, and not in professional antigen presenting cells, may have contributed to this persistence. This hypothesis is in agreement with previous reports showing long-term transgene expression in the context of first generation Ad vector only in the presence of a liver-specific promoter. 29 In this study, liver protection against MHV-3 challenge was observed only upon Dox-mediated induction of mIFN\u2423 expression (Figure 6a ). The striking difference observed in association with the Dox treatment is very significant in view of the fact that the same viral preparation was injected in both groups, eliminating experimental bias such as difference in the transducing particles per unit volume, purity of vector preparation and dilution volume. In addition, liver protection was achi-eved 6 weeks after HD-TET-IFN injection, in line with the notion that therapeutic effects mediated by helperdependent vectors persist for a long period of time. Previously we showed that lower levels of serum mIFN\u2423 were associated with partial hepatic protection, but had no effects on survival rate. 18 In this study, all mice treated with Dox showed liver protection and one out of six survived the MHV-3 infection (Figure 6b) . The higher level of circulating mIFN\u2423 may have elicited stronger local and peripheral effects such as induction of antiviral genes or peritoneal macrophage activation, which may have limited MHV-3 replication in a more efficient manner. Although we showed that injection of HD-TET-IFN resulted in Dox-dependent hepatic protection, the impact of this gene therapy approach on chronic hepatitis remains to be established, as no mouse model for this disease exists, unlike HBV (woodchuck model) or HCV infection (non-human primates, such as chimpanzees). However, the pharmacological control of IFN\u2423 expression is also required in the context of these animal models in light of safety concerns such as toxicity, sideeffects and adjusting the IFN\u2423 level as a function of disease progression.",

However, systemic injection is associated with side-effects, particularly on the neuronal system, which cause the withdrawal of a significant number of patients from the therapy. Therefore, it was of interest to evaluate the possibility of limiting the biological response induced by IFN\u2423 expression to the liver as a function of the Dox treatment and the vector dosage. In a previous study, we observed that in mice injected with the HD-IFN, which express mIFN\u2423 directly under the constitutive TTR promoter, liver-restricted mIFN\u2423 expression, as well as the induction of antiviral genes last for 10 months (data not shown). This observation is in agreement with recent reports where gene transfer mediated by HD vectors resulted in long persistence of transgene expression. 3, 5, 21 This long period of IFN\u2423 expression could, nonetheless, be considered 'over-therapeutic' in light of the current treatment for HCV, which lasts for 6 months. Using the HD-TET-IFN vector, however, allows a controlled timing and potency of expression on the basis of Dox treatment even at low vector doses. Indeed, low doses of HD-TET-IFN resulted in mIFN\u2423 being detectable in the liver and not in the bloodstream only upon Dox induction (Figure 7a ). As a consequence of liver-restricted mIFN\u2423 expression, antiviral genes were induced (Figure 7b ) in the absence of liver damage or inflammation response. Also in the liver, the reversal of mIFN\u2423 induction was fairly rapid, as indicated by the reduction of antiviral gene mRNAs 3 days after Dox withdrawal. Lastly, the expression of mIFN\u2423 was highlighted in the hepatocyte cells upon Dox treatment ( Figure 7c ). As expected on the basis of previous experiments with marker genes, Dox-dependent mIFN\u2423 expression distributed in hepatocytes, which are in the proximity of the vessel.",

Additionally, it requires the use of a large number of animals and can be limited by toxicity during embryogenesis.

Mice injected with HD-TET-IFN showed high levels of serum mIFN\u2423 only upon transcriptional activation. The transgene expression was reinducible to the same high level up to 3 months p.i., and the amount of expressed cytokine could be regulated by dosing doxycycline. Transcriptional activation of mIFN\u2423 induced by doxycycline resulted in prolonged survival and reduced liver damage in HD-TET-IFN-injected mice challenged with a lethal dose of coronavirus. Activation of antiviral genes mediated by doxycycline-dependent mIFN\u2423 expression was also observed at low HD-TET-IFN doses. The possibility of controlling gene expression by the combination of HD vectors and the latest tet-on transactivator also holds promise for studying gene function in other animal models.
