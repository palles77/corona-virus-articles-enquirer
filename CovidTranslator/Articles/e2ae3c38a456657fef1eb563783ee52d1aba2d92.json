In most cases, alignments are performed between the target sequences by dynamic programming techniques and the resulting alignment scores are used to calculate a measure of similarity. Meanwhile, especially in recent years, an increasing number of alignment-free methods have emerged [1] [2] [3] [4] . In contrast to traditional alignments, these alignment-free methods mostly (i) make few assumptions of the evolutionary model and (ii) present light computational load. With the first merit, alignment-free methods do not suffer greatly from some evolutionary events, e.g., large rearrangements and transposon activity. While the second merit enables broad contributions of alignment-free comparisons in pre-filtering relevant sequences, and then using alignment algorithms to refine the searches. This type of heuristic approach is already used in programs like BLAST [5] and FASTA [6] . Additionally, after the completion of many genome projects, alignment-free comparisons begin to find their use in whole genome phylogeny, which meets great computational and theoretical challenges using alignment-based methods.",

Observing that relative abundances of all dinucleotides are remarkably constant across the genome, Karlin et al. [7] [8] [9] proposed the 'genome signature' to describe a genome. The 'signature' consists of the array of dinucleotide relative abundances q xy \u00bc f xy =f x f y extended over all dinucleotides, where f x is the frequency of nucleotide x and f xy is the frequency of dinucleotide xy. In the same manner, genome signature based on abundances of k-nucleotides can also be defined. Reinert et al. [10] studied the statistical and probabilistic properties of words in sequences, with emphasis on the deductions of exact distributions and evaluation of its asymptotic approximations. Word-based comparisons were recently reviewed by Vinga and Almeida [2] . According to their work, biological sequences are first represented as frequency vectors in Euclidean space, and then pairwise distances between these sequences can be defined as the standard Euclidean distance, Mahalanobis distance, linear correlation coefficient or Kullback-Leibler discrepancy between their corresponding vectors. As another powerful tool for sequence analysis, some graphical representations of DNA or protein sequences are also based on statistics of short words [11, 12] .",

However, these simple distances are not satisfying for an accuracy phylogeny, because (i) they treat all word types equally, despite that they have different background frequencies, and (ii) contribution of a word may not merely be a polynomial function of the frequency difference. In order to overcome the above problems, the Mahalanobis and standard Euclidean distance, which take into account the data covariance structure, were proposed for sequence comparison relatively recently [15] . In this paper, we will propose two distance measurements free of such problems by using a probabilistic framework.",

In order to validate our method, distance matrices for the same data set are also constructed using some classical dissimilarity measurements, e.g., the standard Euclidean distance [15, 25] , linear correlation coefficient [26] , Kullback-Leibler (KL) discrepancy [3] and the Composition Vector approach [16, 27] . Note that the Kullback-Leibler discrepancy between two frequency vectors is not symmetrical and will give degenerate results when some word types are absent, we use a re-vised version -the Weighted Sequence Entropy (WSE) [28] . This modification works equivalently with the KL discrepancy in the case of short words, and can effectively avoid the degeneracy for long words.

Then collect CV x for all possible x as components to form a composition vector. The final distance between two species is evaluated based on the cosine function between their corresponding composition vectors. After calculating the pairwise distance matrices, phylogenetic trees for the 25 viruses are built by the UPGMA and NJ programs in the PHYLIP package. Then, rooted phylogenetic trees are drawn by the TREEVIEW program [29] . The UPGMA tree built by the standard Euclidean distance is shown as Fig. 1(1) . This tree supports torovirus as the outgroup of all coronaviruses, but fails to cluster three group I coronaviruses -HCoV-229E and PEDV are grouped together, but TGEV is much closer to the SARS clade. Fig. 1 (2) is the NJ tree constructed by the Euclidean distance. Similar to the UPGMA tree, this tree also prefers SARS-CoVs clustering with TGEV. But an obvious defect is that it does not successfully cluster the eight group II coronaviruses. In Fig. 2 , we list the trees built by linear correlation coefficient between pairwise frequency vectors. Fig. 2(1) is the UPGMA tree. This tree perfectly clusters species within each typical group, and confirmed SARS-CoVs paraphyly. But it fails to identify the outgroup status of torovirus relative to coronaviruses. While the NJ tree ( Fig. 2(2) ), in which torovirus is selected as outgroup species, confirms the adjacent relationship of SARS-CoVs with group I viruses. In the tree built from our distance measure d Exp (Fig. 3) , all above defects are eliminated, i.e., species of each typical groups cluster, and torovirus stays outside of all coronaviruses including SARS-CoVs. Our tree shows that SARS-CoVs are not closely related to any previously isolated coronaviruses and form a new group, but do not support the outgroup status of SARS-CoVs relative to other coronaviruses, as proposed by Zheng et al. [30] . This result is mainly in accordance with the WSE tree at word order k \u00bc 6 ( Fig. 4 ) and the NJ tree constructed by the Composition Vector method (Fig. 5) . Moreover, it is also supported by the experimental evidence, which showed that group I coronaviruses specific antibodies are able to recognize antigens in SARS-CoV infected cultured cells [31] .",

However, multiple sequence alignment of genomic sequences is still a bottleneck, first due to the computational time, and second due to the inherent model assumptions. Therefore, there is a great need to develop new sequence comparisons free of these problems. In recent years, a quantity of alignment-free methods which are based on, e.g., k-words frequency [2] , graphical representations [35] [36] [37] [38] [39] [40] [41] [42] , and information contents [32, 43] , have been proposed.

It has relatively low computational complexity, and does not suffer greatly from genetic rearrangements and transposon activity, which serve as common ways of genome evolution. In most cases, biological sequences are represented as occurrence or frequency vectors in a high dimensional Euclidean space, and then the standard Euclidean distance, linear correlation coefficient, Kullback-Leibler (KL) discrepancy or cosine function between these vectors are calculated as measures of dissimilarity. In this paper, we investigate two word-based distance measurements in a probabilistic framework. Our hypothesis is that occurrence of a given word in a random DNA sequence follows the Poisson distribution. Then distance between two sequences is evaluated by the probability of generating one sequence under the Poisson model estimated from the other, or their different expression levels of words. In contrast to the traditional word-based distances, which use only frequencies of fixedlength words, our distances take background information of words (estimated by frequencies of some shorter words or the corresponding nucleotide composition) into account. In other words, our method has a potential to adjust the background information for distance measurements using composition vector. Through constructing phylogenetic trees of 25 viruses including SARS-CoVs and 20 Eutherian mammals, we find that our method gives a more competitive result compared to the ongoing word-based methods.",

However, different from our measure (Eq. (3)), the value of CV x may be affected by those words with very low background frequency, i.e., when f x is very small, the corresponding CV x will be very large. While our measure is free of this problem as it ranges from 0 to 1. In other words, our method can avoid the noise accompanied by words with exceptional background frequencies.",

For example, occurrences of many words are much higher than 60 in some bacterial genomes (when k \u00bc 10), which makes our Poisson-based distances computationally infeasible. So a reliable and efficient approximation of Poisson probability is critical to our method. In addition, the accuracy of our approach depends strongly on the Poisson model of word occurrences. This assumption is generally valid when the sequence length is suffi- Fig. 6 . The UPGMA tree built from the complete mtDNA sequences of 20 mammals. We use the distance metric dExp, and background frequencies of words are estimated by the Markov model of order k \u00c0 2. ciently large. But for words with overlapping structure, e.g., TATATA and CCGCCG, their occurrences in a random sequence may vary significantly from the Poisson distribution. While at the same time, experiments showed that these self-overlapping words are more prone to be functional patterns in regular regions of genomes. In the future study, we will explore some models to describe and compare these words.",
