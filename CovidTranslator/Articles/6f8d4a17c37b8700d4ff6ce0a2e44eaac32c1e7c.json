Saudi Arabia, being the custodian of the 2 holy cities (Mecca and Medina), provides extensive, multifaceted programs to serve these \"Guests of God.\" However, the annual event is confronted with public health challenges besides immigration, crowd, and crime management. In addition to the formidable logistics, the risk for spread of infectious diseases is well recognized in the era of globalization. Contemporary outbreaks of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), Ebola virus, and Zika virus have drawn much attention to global health. The annual Hajj event definitely calls for precautions. This paper is informed by a review of the literature and case studies among 2015 Hajj pilgrims.",

            "text": "Infectious Diseases. The 5-day ritual causes extensive physical and mental stresses. Heat, sun exposure, thirst, crowding, traffic congestions, steep inclines, rough terrain, and cultural diversity present extensive stressors. During Hajj, pilgrims are also challenged by various prevention and infection control measures. Weather conditions, along with overcrowding within a confined area, make pilgrims also more susceptible to acquiring and spreading infections, particularly acute respiratory infections. 4 These major challenges have been witnessed when outbreaks of epidemics have occurred; for example, outbreaks of plague and cholera in ancient times involved large numbers of pilgrims, when quarantine was the prime means of control 5,6 ; a global meningococcal serotype W135 outbreak in 2000 was widely linked to either a recent return from the Hajj or contact with returned pilgrims 2,7 ; in recent years notable threats were avian influenza viruses, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus, Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), and multidrug-resistant tuberculosis. 8, 9 In 2012, the Hajj received political and scientific attention when MERS cases were detected in France, Germany, Italy, and the United Kingdom. MERS-CoV was first isolated from a patient who died of a severe respiratory illness in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. 8 According to Bakhsh et al, 10 in 2 health care centers near the Holy Mosque, most of the patients were suffering from respiratory problems followed by skin and gastrointestinal problems during the 2013 Hajj season. \"Hajj cough\" was considered by pilgrims the most reported complaint, and 1 in 3 pilgrims were found to be affected. The severity and clinical spectrum of respiratory disease varies from mild sickness to severe pneumonia, hospitalization, and even death. 11 Unfortunately there are no comprehensive studies on the epidemiology of respiratory infections during Hajj; most investigations involved cross-sectional studies on a relatively small number of cases. 12, 13 Although governments of Hajji's countries of origin recommend flu vaccinations for Hajj pilgrimages before departure, most hajjis do not adhere to these recommendations. Influenza vaccine has been recommended since 2005 for all pilgrims, especially people at high risk, which includes those >65 years of age and people with preexisting medical or immune-compromising conditions. 14 Despite all these recommendations, the influenza vaccine acceptance rate among Hajj pilgrims varies by country and by year. Many pilgrims refuse vaccines; the main reasons identified were reliance on \"natural immunity,\" lack of awareness or knowledge, and lack of access to vaccines. Many people have misperceptions about vaccines, including that they contain toxic preservatives and are themselves the cause of disease. Moreover these vaccinations do not cover variants of different strains of influenza. According to Alborzi et al., 13 in their study on Iranian Hajj pilgrims, influenza vaccination could not prevent respiratory infections in pilgrims statistically (P \u00bc . 19 ), but the consequences of this limitation remains less. Two hundred fifty-five pilgrims were examined for respiratory infections, and influenza virus was identified more in unvaccinated than in vaccinated pilgrims (16.5% vs 9.2%) in laboratory tests of their nasal swabs. 13 Another study among Malaysian pilgrims found that influenza vaccine was effective for 50%-60% in preventing hospitalization and pneumonia; it was 80% effective in preventing death in patients older than age 60. 15 Eventual vaccination failures might be explained by a new drift of variants or inappropriate vaccine handling and storage. * Therefore examining the circulating influenza strains is recommended in * For men, the special outfit for the hajj consists of 2 pieces of white, unsown cloth. One of the pieces is wrapped around the midriff to cover the lower body, and the other is draped around the shoulders to cover the upper body. Women must cover their bodies in a loose-fitting outfit and cover their hair. However, they are not permitted to cover their faces. addition to strict enforcement of vaccination policy. 13, 15 Among other precautionary measures, the use of a face mask is considered by some pilgrims religiously prohibited while wearing ihram. Some consider using alcohol-containing products (eg, hand sanitizers) as prohibited during Hajj ritual too, although recently religious scholars have allowed the use of alcohol for medical purposes. However, the challenge remains to endorse use of mandatory face masks in the crowd and organize screening at arrival. 9 The Saudi government faces extreme pressure during the time of Hajj because there are multiple routes of entry for pilgrims. 16 Therefore it is recommended to enforce the law on compulsory vaccinations and control for dishonesty and corruption by the home countries as prerequisites for visa processing. Also, a supply of adequate vaccines at limited or no cost is strongly suggested. 14 Skin infections among pilgrims are very common because of lengthy rituals of standing and walking, heat, and unfavorable conditions. 17 Primary pyoderma (including impetigo), carbuncles, furuncles, folliculitis, pyoderma complicated eczema, and cutaneous leishmaniosis are commonly found. Pilgrims are barefoot while walking in some holy places, or emotionally climb some rocky places. Accidental injury, severe burns, and soreness of the sole are common occurances, 18 and these kinds of injuries increase the chance of secondary skin infections, especially among elderly and comorbid people. Noncommunicable Diseases. Many studies and the Saudi Arabian government's health statistics have indicated that noncommunicable diseases, particularly cardiovascular diseases and diabetes, pose critical health challenges for pilgrims and the government's health system during Hajj. [19] [20] [21] Pre-hajj medical states, being of old age, rigorous physical activities, exhaustion, fatigue, heat, and trauma are related to and cause exacerbation of chronic noncommunicable diseases during Hajj. 19, 22, 23 Cardiovascular diseases were the main cause of hospitalization and intensive care. Almalki 24 reported in his Hajj study that out of 110 inpatients from 20 different countries, 34% had ischemic heart disease, 20% had elevated blood pressure, and prevalence of stroke was 17%. According to Madani et al, 19 more than 60% of the intensive care unit admissions in 7 hospitals in Mina and Arafat were due to cardiovascular origins. Among these cases, myocardial infarction and left ventricular failure were of the highest occurrence. 19 Furthermore, cardiovascular events were the major cause of death during pilgrimage. The review study of Al Shimemeri 25 confirmed that cardiovascular diseases during the Hajj period caused more death than other communicable and noncommunicable diseases. In 2008, 66% of deaths were due to cardiovascular diseases out of 446 deaths among Indonesian pilgrims. 26 Many factors been identified that lead to poor diabetes control during Hajj. 27 A study by Khan et al 21 revealed that 31.9% of 689 emergency patients had diabetes; meanwhile 34 patients were diabetic among 160 acutely hospitalized patients.",

When fully occupied, the buildings could accommodate an average crowd density level of 4 people per square meter (4 ppm 2 ). However, at certain locations, and closer to the Kaaba, the level of density becomes 6-8 ppm 2 and 12 ppm 2 . A similar crowd density is observed near Jamarat, and incidences like stampedes occur commonly. 30 The Saudi government has involved religious scholars, administrators, immigration and security personnel, health officials, and other officials to Three stone pillars that are pelted as a compulsory ritual of hajj in imitation of the Prophet Abraham (Peace on Him). manage the Hajj. In spite of all these efforts, several disasters have taken place every year, such as stampedes, fires, bottlenecks, and more. Although during the past few years several scientific and technological efforts have been applied to assist in the management of crowds, in 2015 a devastating stampede occurred. The use of crowd simulation models, assessment of the efficient ways of grouping and scheduling pilgrims, luggage management, video monitoring, and changes in the transport system are the latest measures to improve the management of the pilgrimage event. 31 There are many methods for modeling and simulating pedestrian crowds followed worldwide, such as agent based, social force, cellular automata, fluid dynamic, fixed GPA monitoring and queuing models, and so on. Pedestrian crowd dynamics have different scales, such as the microscopic scale, dealing with individual pedestrians, and the macroscopic scale, dealing with the characteristics of a crowd. These methods have shown several self-organizing principles about the patterns of crowd phenomena; corresponding patterns have been noted in real crowds. These included macroscopic crowd patterns that result from local interactions of multitudes of pedestrians at the microscopic level. 29 Some studies reported that people moving in groups had positive psychological effects, including less feeling of being lost, and that proper guidance from a group leader had a positive effect as well. 30 In absence of these factors, real crowds are perceived to pose a threat. However, updates on the crowd flow must be announced and displayed by electronic boards at different parts of the roads to assist in crowd management. Heat-Related Sickness.

Many recent incidences and risks of morbidity and mortality suggest that it is not the sole responsibility of one country but should be attributed to all home countries of pilgrims. Especially to meet the challenge of infectious diseases, a well-coordinated global approach is priority. Epidemiological modeling at the microscopic level is suggested by many researchers and already monitored in other mass gatherings, such as Notting Hill Carnival. Dishonesty related to vaccination and treatment ultimately endangers the whole world as illustrated in the literature. Henceforth international collaboration, law enforcement, and research are vital to ensure accessibility of vaccines and prescribed medications for the pilgrims. Capacity building within host and sending countries focusing on prevention of infectious disease, heat-related sicknesses, and injuries before Hajj are important and should be adopted worldwide. Hajj causalities data should be shared accurately; and the custodian country should welcome global participation and deal with criticism in a constructive way. Furthermore, an international event of this magnitude such as the Hajj creates communication challenges. To minimize language barriers, law enforcers must be proficient in English, and written instructions or directions should make use of main global languages. 29 Hajj is a unique mass gathering provides excellent is annual opportunity to reflect on the public health risk posed by international and multicultural crowds and the value of mitigation strategies. New and challenging risks can be introduced during mass gatherings. From a global health and human security perspective, strengthening of core capacities in managing mass gatherings and researching risks posed by such gatherings are paramount to safeguarding the public's health.",
