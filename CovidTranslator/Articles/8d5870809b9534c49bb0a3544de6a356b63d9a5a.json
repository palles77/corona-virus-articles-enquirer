There was a period between 1960 and 1970 when it was widely expected that the antibiotic and vaccine era would reduce or eliminate infectious diseases, but as we know now, new microbes pursue every possible chance to escape from barriers that are erected to contain them and we must be forever on our guards. Influenza, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) have shown us that the fear that new plagues are in the making is not unjustified. In most parts of the world; however, we are not well prepared because we have not enough water, not enough food, not sufficient shelter, and no peace. Drug resistant superbugs have spread to 40 countries and in India alone more than 600 million people defecate in the open.",

Certain occupational groups may be at greater risk such as farmers, pastoralists, hunters, veterinarians, and wildlife workers, but zoonoses are not only a rural problem anymore. They undoubtedly have also spread into urban areas. Last but not least, mass gatherings like the annual Hajj pilgrimage to Saudi Arabia also poses a real zoonotic risk especially to people who come into close animal contact; for example, when a great number of animals of unknown origin are sacrificed. This review article highlights the most important viral, bacterial, and parasitic zoonotic diseases and briefly mentions the occurrence of some of these on the Arabian Peninsula.",

The first cases were reported in 1992/1993. 3 In 1992/1993 the disease entered the United Arab Emirates (UAE) via Al-Ain from Oman and infected first 12 dromedaries, 5 sheep, 4 goats, and 3 foxes in the Al-Ain area. Four months later, it reached Abu Dhabi and Dubai where rabies killed 17 more dromedaries and one sheep. In total, 44 animals and 4 species were affected. The disease reemerged in 2013/2014 and infected 6 feral cats, 2 red foxes, and one horse, which was bitten by a rabid fox. Al-Dubaib 4 reported rabies in dromedaries in Saudi Arabia in 2007. A rabies incidence of 0.2% was reported by 48 camel herdsmen looking after more than 4,000 animals. The disease was transmitted in 70% of cases by bites from feral dogs and 17% of the cases by rabid foxes. Camels ware mainly bitten in the front and hind legs when defending their neonates. It is believed that rabies is transmitted by the red fox in the UAE and Oman and mainly by wild dogs (feral) in Saudi Arabia and Yemen. It can only be presumed that these animals species are the vectors of rabies on the Arabian Peninsula, as there are very few available reports. 5 Rabies viruses isolated from camels in the UAE were indistinguishable from the Lyssavirus serotypes. A phylogenetic tree from Omani and UAE rabies strains was established, and this showed that rabies viruses cluster together in a European/Middle East lineage, 6 segregated into 2 distinct branches. The reference method of making a diagnosis of rabies is to demonstrate rabies virus antigen in impression smears of fresh brain by immuno fluorescence (Figure 1) .",

Most pandemic strains such as the 1957 H2N2, 1968 H3N2, and 2009 pandemic H1N1 have emerged by genetic re-assortment with the avian and human influenza A viruses. 2 A devastating outbreak of avian influenza H5N1 occurred in Saudi Arabia in 2005 when an infected falcon was brought back from Disclosure.

Table 2 shows in detail which influenza viruses were isolated in the UAE over the last decade from avians. The situation in other countries of the Arabian Peninsula is unknown.

It is now confirmed that the virus can be transmitted by the dromedary (Camelus dromedarius) through nasal and eye secretions to humans. Studies from different Middle Eastern countries have also revealed that dromedaries were infected at high rates with MERS CoV a long time before notification of the first human cases. 8 Dromedaries from USA, Europe, and Australia are free of antibodies against MERS CoV with the exception of some camels from the Canary Islands. It is still obscure if dromedaries act as an intermediate host or if other animal species like bats infected them. Sequence analysis have shown that a MERS CoV isolated from a dromedary was identical to an isolate from a human patient who died from the CoV infection after close contact with one of his camels, which displayed rhinitis. 9 Severe acute respiratory syndrome, which appeared first in southern China in 2002 and was contained in July 2003 after spreading to 29 countries worldwide was the first serious and readily transmissible disease to emerge in the twenty-first century. 10 Masked palm civets (Paguma larvata) were the intermediate host responsible for passing the virus to humans, but horseshoe bat species (genus Rhinolophus) were the definitive host.",

            "text": "Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) is an acute disease of humans caused by a tick-borne virus widely distributed in Asia, Africa, and southern and eastern Europe. The infection is enzootic, but mainly asymptomatic in many animal species such as cattle, sheep, goats, camels as well as small mammals like hares. 11 Thirty species of ticks, particularly the genus Hyalomma act as both reservoir and vector. Humans become infected by tick bites or through close contact with infected animals and humans. Hyalomma ticks were responsible for outbreaks in humans with high fatalities in the UAE, Oman, and Saudi Arabia. 12, 13 Another viral hemorrhagic disease named Alkhurma hemorrhagic fever (AHF) has emerged in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia in the mid 1990's. 14 Alkhurma hemorrhagic fever is a zoonotic disease and human clinical cases have been linked to mainly sheep and camels although the virus has not yet been isolated from livestock. However, AHFV and other arboviruses like Kadam and Quaranfil viruses have been isolated from the camel tick Hyalomma dromedarii in Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, and Yemen. It is important to mention that human movement not only facilitates the transmission of zoonotic diseases into the Arabian Peninsula, but also the introduction into other continents when pilgrims return back to their home countries. Strikingly, all rift valley fever (RVF) epizootics described to date have followed unusually severe rainy seasons, probably indicating a very large insect population as a vector prerequisite. In 2000, the disease for the first time affected humans and livestock outside Africa, when it was diagnosed in the southern parts of Saudi Arabia 15 and Yemen. 16 It is believed that it was introduced into this part of the world by infected ruminants coming from East Africa via the port of Djibouti. For more than 70 years, RVF epidemics have occurred at prolonged intervals in Eastern and Southern Africa. 5, 17 The fatality in the RVF epidemic in southern Saudi Arabia in 2000 reached 14%. 18 It is quite obvious that globalization of trade and altered weather patterns are a concern for the future spread of RVF, as the causative agent, the RVF virus is capable of utilizing a wide range of mosquito vectors.",

Since then, WNV outbreaks have been reported all over the world. The disease reached the United States in 1999 and has now spread over the entire country as well as Central and South America, and the Caribbean. The genus Flavivirus, to which WNV belongs comprises over 70 viruses, many of which may infect humans such as the yellow fever and dengue fever viruses. The genotyping of WNV has demonstrated 2 main lineages with several subtypes. Humans, horses, camelids, and many other mammalian species as well as reptiles and birds can be infected through mosquito bites. However, they are dead-end hosts because they do not produce enough virus particles in their blood to infect biting mosquitoes. The virus can be transmitted only by mosquitoes, which become infected when they take a blood meal from a bird carrying WNV. So far, human infections have been responsible for over 12,000 cases of meningitis and encephalitis and over 1,000 fatalities in the United States as well as several thousand equine fatalities. Antibodies against WNV were found in dromedaries 19 and horses 20 in the UAE, but the general situation of WNV on the Arabian Peninsula is unknown and should be more thoroughly investigated in the future.",

Human brucellosis remains one of the most common zoonotic diseases worldwide with more than 500,000 new cases annually.

Despite being a notifiable disease in most countries, brucellosis is often unrecognized and unreported. Brucella melitensis and Brucella abortus are the 2 species most commonly found in human cases, and Brucella melitensis is responsible for the most serious infection leading to orchitis and epididymitis in men and fetal loss in pregnant women. Infections have been reported to occur in humans, dromedaries, small ruminants, and ruminating wildlife 5 from the Arabian Peninsula.

The parasites are transmitted by sand flies, which bite a wide range of warm-blooded animal species including man, and the dog acts as a main reservoir. Zoonotic cutaneous leishmaniasis (ZCL) is caused by Leishmania major and sylvatic rodents harbor the parasite.

The predilection sites of cysts are: liver (63%), lung (25%), muscles (5%), bones (3%), kidney (2%), spleen and brain (1%). 30 However, exact data on the prevalence of this disease in humans is not available although in many countries it is a notifiable disease . 23 Conclusion and recommendations. Numerous zoonotic diseases cause morbidity, mortality, and productivity losses not only in humans, but also in livestock and wildlife populations all over the world including the Arabian Peninsula. These diseases may have large social impacts in endemic areas. Several of these zoonotic diseases have been introduced from other countries into the Arabian Peninsula due to lack of stringent import regulations or lack of implementing them. Typical recent examples are outbreaks of RVF, CCHF, avian influenza, and glanders into the Arabian Peninsula. Mycobacteriosis and brucellosis as well as leishmaniasis are further examples of this situation. Uncontrolled trade of live dromedaries for example from East African countries where a seroprevalence of brucellosis may reach 40% contribute to a rise of zoonotic diseases in the imported countries. Not only zoonotic diseases have been introduced from Africa and Asia into the Arabian Peninsula, but also other diseases such as foot-and-mouth with severe consequences for the livestock industry. Serotypes completely unknown to this region were recently introduced most probably from Egypt. Therefore, there is an urgent need for interdisciplinary collaboration between health, agricultural, and environmental ministries of all countries of the Arabian Peninsula to avoid the emergence and re-emergence of zoonotic diseases in their territories.",
