With the expansion of screening activities in Israel, in subsequent years, sera were analyzed by ELISA also, as enabled by safety requirements, thus both assays were performed in parallel. Fig. 2 shows the neutralization titers and the percentage positives with confidence level (CI) detected by the two assays per year. While the VNT was performed on all sera collected from 2012 to 2017, ELISA was performed only on the sera collected between 2015 and 2017. We initially tested 90 camel sera, obtained from 2012 to 2014, using VNT. Most camels were adults, 3 years and more, thus analysis of infection by age is not possible. MERS-CoV neutralizing antibodies for the year 2012 showed a seropositivity of 72.5% point estimate proportion (PEP) (CI: 60.3%, 84.8%) at a 95% confidence level (CL). The seropositivity seemed to drop to 38.7%, during 2013. Sera from 2015 to 2017 were analyzed by both ELISA and VNT ( Fig. 2A, B) . The seroprevalence of MERS-CoV antibodies obtained using ELISA did not significantly differ from those obtained using VNT, as both PEPs and Cls overlapped (Fig. 2) . Most camel sera were collected from the Southern part of Israel, except of 2 farms (nos. 14 and 15) ( Table 1 , Fig. 1 ), from the Northern and Central Israel, respectively. Only one camel serum from farm no. 14 was positive.",

The presence of virus-specific neutralizing antibodies suggests that Israeli camels were exposed to MERS-CoV in the past. The VNT assay was more sensitive than the ELISA, which had only 91.7% sensitivity when compared to VNT assay. That feature could be related to the fact that the ELISA coating antigen was the MERS-CoV spike S1 protein, whereas the VNT assay employed complete virions that could reveal antibodies against other viral proteins. Alternatively, whereas the ELISA detects only IgG, the VNT detects any isotype of antibodies which could be IgG, IgM or IgA. The VNT assay was also more specific than the ELISA, which had a calculated specificity of only 93.33% when compared to VNT. In addition, the higher strength of the VNT assay as compared to ELISA might be attributed by the fact that borderline sera by ELISA were not considered.",

Moreover, the proportion of sera with low VNT titers (< 320) in Israel was about 70.4%, whereas in in the surrounding countries only about 10% of the sera had low VNT titers meaning that the MERS-CoV seroprevalence in Israel is lower than that in the surrounding countries.
