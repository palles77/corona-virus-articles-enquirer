            "text": "Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (2019-nCoV), which first broke out in 1 Wuhan (China) in December of 2019, causes a severe acute respiratory illness with a mortality 2 ranging from 3% to 6%. To better understand the evolution of the newly emerging 2019-nCoV, in this 3 paper, we analyze the codon usage pattern of 2019-nCoV. For this purpose, we compare the codon 4 usage of 2019-nCoV with that of other 30 viruses belonging to the subfamily of orthocoronavirinae. 5 We found that 2019-nCoV shows a rich composition of AT nucleotides that strongly influences its 6 codon usage, which appears to be not optimized to human host. Then, we study the evolutionary 7 pressures influencing the codon usage and evolutionary rates of the sequences of five conserved 8 genes that encode the corresponding proteins (viral replicase, spike, envelope, membrane and 9 nucleocapsid) characteristic of coronaviruses. We found different patterns of both mutational bias 10 and nature selection that affect the codon usage of these genes at different extents. Moreover, we 11 show that the two integral membrane proteins proteins (matrix and envelope) tend to evolve slowly 12 by accumulating nucleotide mutations on their genes. Conversely, genes encoding nucleocapsid 13 (N), viral replicase and spike proteins are important targets for the development of vaccines and 14 antiviral drugs, tend to evolve faster as compared to other ones. Taken together, our results suggest 15 that the higher evolutionary rate observed for these two genes could represent a major barrier in the 16 development of antiviral therapeutics 2019-nCoV. 18 20 genome of coronavirus (mouse hepatitis virus -MHV), a positive sense, single-stranded RNA virus, 21 was first reported in 1949. It belongs to the family Coronaviridae and ranges from 26.4 (ThCoV 22 HKU12) to 31.7 (SW1) kb in length [10], making it the largest genomes among all known RNA viruses, 23 with G + C contents varying from 32% to 43% [20]. The coronavirinae family consists of four genera 24 based on their genetic properties, including genus: Alphacoronavirus, Betacoronavirus (subdivided in 25 subgroups A, B, C and D), Gammacoronavirus and Deltacoronavirus. Coronavirus can infect humans 26 and many different animal 2 of 20 bats, rabbits, ferrets, mink, snake, and other wildlife animals. To date, 30 CoVs genomes have been 28 identified. Only seven CoVs have been identified that infect humans, including Human CoV-229E 29 (HCoV-229E), Human coronavirus NL63 (HCoV-NL63), HumanCoV-OC43 (HCoV-OC43), Human 30 CoV-HKU1 (HCoV-HKU1), Human SARS related coronavirus (SARSr-CoV), Middle East Respiratory 31 Syndrome (MERS-CoV) and SARS CoV 2 ( nCoV) [26]. 32 Severe acute respiratory syndrome CoV 2 (2019-nCoV), which first broke out in Wuhan (China) in 33 December of 2019, causes a severe acute respiratory illness with a mortality rate from 3% to 6%. 34 The newly sequenced virus genome encodes two open reading frames (ORFs), ORF1a and ORF1ab, 35 the latter encodes replicase polyproteins, and four structural proteins [19], [9]: the spike-surface 36 glycoprotein (protein S), the small envelop protein (protein E), the matrix protein (M), and the 37 nucleocapsid protein (N). 38 The phenomenon of codon usage bias (CUB) exists in many genomes including RNA genomes and 39 it is actually determined by mutation and selection [1]. As it is well-known, the non-random choice 40 of synonymous codons varies among species that are potential host for viruses [11] [? ]. It is then 41 important to study patterns of common codon usage in coronaviruses because CUB can be related to 42 the driving forces that shape the evolution of small RNA viruses. Mutational bias has been considered 43 as the major determinant of codon usage variation among RNA viruses [13]. Indeed, RNA viruses 44 show an effective number of codons (ENC) that is quite high (ENC>45) pointing to a quite random 45 codon usage, whereas if one uses the adaptive index CAI then the viral CUB is consistent with that of 46 the host, as observed in the Equine infectious anemia virus (EIAV) or Zaire ebolavirus (ZEBOV) [5]. 47 65",

In Table 2 and 3, we report 83 the ENC and CAI values for all the coronaviruses we considered in this work. To visually enhance 84 the differences among the codon usage of these coronaviruses we calculated Zscore of a single virus 85 in relation to the other members of the CoV subfamily. Interestingly, the ENC value associated to 86 2019-nCoV (51.9 \u00b1 2.59) is lower than the average of all Coronaviruses, meaning that 2019-nCoV uses 87 a broader set of synonymous codons in its coding sequences.

The principle behind CAI is that codon usage in highly expressed genes can reveal the optimal (i.e., most efficient for translation) codons for each amino acid. Hence, CAI is calculated based on a reference set of highly expressed genes to assess, for each codon i, the relative synonymous codon usages (RSCU i ) and the relative codon adaptiveness (w i ):",

The ENC-plot is a plot in which the ENC is the ordinate and the GC3 is the abscissa. Depending on the action of mutational bias and natural selection, different cases are discernable.

Genes94 The genome of the newly emerging 2019-nCoV consists of a single, positive-stranded RNA, 95 that is approximately 30K nucleotides long. The overall genome is organizated similar to other 96 coronaviruses. Ceraolo et al. performed a cross-species analysis for all proteins encoded by the 97 2019-nCoV (see Figure 3-4 in [3]). The newly sequenced virus genome encodes polyproteins, common 98 to all betacoronavirus, which are further cleaved into the individual structural proteins E, M, N and S, 99 as well the non-structural RdRP [28]. So, only five viral genes are classified according to their viral 100 location and studied for each virus because the short length and insufficient codon usage diversity of 101 the other genes might have biased the results. The corresponding gene products including S protein 102 regulates virus attachment to the receptor of the target host cell [2]; the E protein functions to assemble 103 the virions and acts as an ion channel [18], the M protein plays a role in virus assembly and is involved 104 in biosynthesis of new virus particles [17] the N protein forms the ribonucleoprotein complex with 105 the virus RNA [19]. Finally, RdRP catalyzes viral RNA syntesis. We calculate for these five proteins 106 the RSCU vectors in each virus of the dataset (see Figure 3). We show that only for gene E, M and 107 N 2019-nCoV cluster with SARSr-CoV and SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3, consistent with the inferred 108 phylogeny shown in Figure A3. 109 author/funder.

The ENC plot analysis of individual genes of 2019-nCoV 110 To further investigate which factors account for the low codon usage bias of the different genes 111 in coronavirus, we analyzed the relationship between the ENC value and the percentage of G or C 112 in the third positioncodons (GC3s). In Figure 4, we show separately the ENC-plots obtained for the 113 five genes (M, N, S, E, and RdRP), together with the Wright's theoretical curve, corresponding to the 114 case when the codon usage is only determined by the GC3s [29]. We would like to point out that if 115 mutational bias, as quantified by GC-content in the generally neutral 3rd codon position, is the main 116 factor in determining the codon usage among these genes, the corresponding point in the ENC-plot 117 should lie on or just below Wright's curve. In Figure 4, all distributions lie below the theoretical curve, 118 an indication that not only mutational bias but also natural selection plays a non-negligible role in the 119 codon choice in all genes. This is exemplified by the violinplots in Figure 5 of the distances between the 120 genes and Wright's theoretical curve.

The codon usage bias was 183 further confirmed by the mean ENC value of 51.9 (a value greater than 45 is considered as a slight 184 codon usage bias due to mutation pressure or nucleotide compositional constraints). The same analysis 185 is effectuated with CAI index, that it is calculated on the with RNA of codons expressed most often. 186 This suggests that the RNA viruses with high ENC values (and low CAI) adapt to the host with 187 various preferred codons.
