            "text": "Background/Purpose: Controversy exists in the literature regarding whether dentists with multiple occupational exposures suffer from premature mortality. A cohort mortality study was conducted to evaluate the survival outcome and determine if potential exposure to harmful agents leads to premature mortality among dentists. Methods: Using the Life Table Analysis System, we calculated standardized mortality ratios (SMRs) for a cohort of 11,700 dentists affiliated with the Taiwan Dental Association. These dentists were followed from 1985e2009. Reference rates were derived from cause-, gender-, and age-specific mortality rates of the general population of Taiwan and 18,664 Taiwanese internists, who were considered to be more socioeconomically proximal to dentists. A Cox proportional hazard model was also constructed to determine multiple risk factors associated with mortality. Results: Compared with the general population, dentists in Taiwan consistently demonstrated reduced from all-cause mortality. However, compared with internists, significant and excess mortality were observed in dentists for overall mortality (SMR Z 1.13; 95% confidence interval [CI] Z 1.00 e1.26), drowning (SMR Z 6.62; 95% CI Z 2.15 e15.45), and heart diseases (SMR Z 1.66; 95% CI Z 1.22e2.21). After adjusting for other risk factors, the Cox model showed an increased hazard ratio of 1.17 (95% CI Z 1.01e1.37) for dentists. Conclusion: Taiwanese dentists demonstrated significant elevated SMRs for overall causes, drowning, and heart diseases. Careful precaution should be taken to reduce these trends. Future studies are also needed for in-depth exploration of the mechanisms regarding how professional stress and exposure contribute to the increased risk of mortality in Taiwanese dentists.",

These elevated risks might represent the impact of the potential hazards in the workplace; however, the relationship between the mortality rate of dentists and hazardous agents has not been clearly elaborated. As the risk of death from cancer increases with advanced age, the assessment of true cancer risks requires longer periods of follow-up examinations. In order to improve the validity of the abovementioned studies, additional socioeconomically comparable reference groups should be recruited and the duration of the follow-up examinations must be extended to detect any increase in mortality.",

Twenty-six of the 289 deceased dentists had an unknown cause of death. The all-cause and cause-specific mortality rates of the dentists were compared with those of the reference groups. Person-years and standardized mortality ratios (SMRs) were calculated using the Life Table Analysis System (LTAS.NET), which was first developed by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH), and SMRs and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated using the mortality rates of the 119 underlying causes of death of the general population and internists of Taiwan as the reference group, respectively. In this study, we set the significance level to p < 0.05. While the mortality rates of the general population can be directly retrieved from the vital statistics tables of Taiwan, we recruited similar data on all practicing internists in the TMA. These individuals were followed from 1990e2006 to serve as an alternative reference group. 14 Cox proportional hazard analysis was conducted to determine the hazard ratios and 95% CIs for the following risk factors: age, gender, specialty, geographic region of practice, age at the beginning of practice, year practice was begun (before or after 1995 when the NHI system was established), and physician-to-population ratio. The physician-to-population ratios were categorized into four levels: > 1:500, between 1:500 and 1:700, between 1:700 and 1:900, and < 1:900 (Table 1) . We applied a stepwise strategy for variable selection using a significance level for entry and significance level to stay that were both set to 0.15. Regression diagnostics were also run, including examination of the proportional hazard assumption, residual analysis, and detection of influential cases, and we also checked for multicollinearity to assure good quality analysis and goodness of fit of the model.",

Our study also found five dentists who died of drowning and a higher cause-specific SMR (6.62, 95% CI Z 2.15e15.45) for dentists compared with internists. Deaths by drowning are generally suspected of being suicides. As a sensitivity analysis, we reclassified all nontraffic-related deaths, including drowning deaths, as suicides; however, the SMR did not significantly increase. Thus, we tentatively conclude the possibility of miscoding or misclassifying suicides as accidental injuries as unlikely. Based on our qualitative enquiry, many dentists pursue fishing as a hobby, especially in the ocean surrounding Taiwan. The unexpected tides and weather conditions might partially explain the increased SMR of drowning by dentists, and careful precautions should be taken to reduce this risk.",

            "text": "There are several limitations of this study. First, the exact dates of obtaining the dentist license were absent for 410 out of 11,700 members. Most of these participants were very old and began their practices before 1985. We determined the time spent practicing dentistry from the date of obtaining the license through December 31, 2009 or the date of death or termination of membership. For those with incomplete information on the date or month of obtaining the license, we assumed the date to be July 1 of the year the dentist turned 24 years of age because most dentists graduate from dental schools around this time. Thus, we might have slightly overestimated the time spent practicing dentistry, which could result in the underestimation of the risk of mortality. But, this assumption might not affect the overall conclusion. Second, because the follow-up periods of two cohorts of dentists and internists were different, namely 1985e2009 and 1990e2006, respectively, this raises concerns regarding comparability and potential bias. However, because there were no catastrophic events (such as an epidemic of severe acute respiratory syndrome or earthquakes larger than 6.0e7.0 on the Richter magnitude scale, etc.) in Taiwan during both periods, the likelihood of potential bias may be minimal. Third, the analyses did not incorporate information regarding the levels of the clinics and hospitals being practiced. Thus, we had to assume that it might be a random effect that only lead to underestimation or had a null effect.",
