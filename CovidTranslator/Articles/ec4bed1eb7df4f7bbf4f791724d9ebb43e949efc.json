It does not, however, cover operation of the electron microscope or of other equipment for which the manufacturers' instructions would be more appropriate. The chapter is subdivided into four sections: a general introduction (detailing necessary equipment, safety precautions, etc); negative staining procedures; thin sectioning procedures; and briefly scanning EM. Following a brief discussion of the principles, each technique is given in sufficient detail to be followed as a recipe. Modifications are included within the methodology or in a following paragraph. However, it is not intended to be a comprehensive text and readers are directed to the bibliography for more complex techniques. Finally, it must be stated that the total novice should ensure that they receive their initial instruction from a competent electron microscopist, ideally on a recognized academic or manufacturer-run course.",

The author's personal opinion is that it does not matter. 6. Cover the film and grids with a square of filter paper. When the paper is fully wetted remove it gently. The film, plus grids, should remain attached to the filter paper, which should be allowed to dry, grids uppermost, at room temperature. 7. When dry, the coated grids, on the filter paper, are placed into a suitable vacuum coating apparatus, and a thin film of carbon is evaporated onto the grids. No further details are given as different machines vary and all that is necessary is to follow the manufacturer's instructions. The thickness of the carbon film may be estimated by observing its deposition on a thickness indicator (a piece of white porcelain with a drop of vacuum oil on it). The carbon is only visible on the porcelain -not the oil. 8. The grids are then ready for use.",
