We investigated the cross protection of the vaccine by assessing the traqueal ciliostasis, virus recovery, and histopathological changes typically observed in the respiratory tract. Although the IBVPR03 strain is S1genotyped as Massachusetts with a high genomic similarity to the H-120 vaccine strains, surprisingly, we found no tropism or pathogenicity to the trachea in birds infected with this strain. On the other hand, we observed ovarian and testicle lesions. Here, we show that, despite belonging in the Massachusetts genotype, the IBVPR03 pathotype differs from the expected respiratory pattern, causing instead marked histopathological changes in the gonads, so far not associated with this group.",

            "text": "The Avian Infectious Bronchitis virus (IBV) causes a highly contagious disease and produces severe economic losses in the poultry industry worldwide. The etiologic agent, the infectious bronchitis virus, is a pleomorphic coronavirus with a single-stranded, positive-sense RNA genome that is 27.6 Kb long and encodes the following structural proteins: spike glycoprotein (S), membrane glycoprotein (M), the nucleocapsid protein (N), and the small membrane protein (E) [1] . The IBV replicates in the upper respiratory tract and also in some epithelial cells of the digestive, urinary, and reproductive systems [1, 2] . Literature has shown that in addition to its respiratory, digestive, and urinary signs, the IBV can cause declines in egg production and fertility of breeding flocks. Since it was first described in 1931 [3] , several serotypes and strains of IBV have been isolated worldwide and there are currently no vaccines that stimulate a complete protection, demanding in many circumstances the adoption of multiple vaccines for the constantly arising antigenic variants [4] . Meanwhile, the emergence of new IBV variants requires constant characterization of these strains by genotyping, serotyping, and pathotyping for subsequent cross-protection studies with the available vaccines [5] .",

In a cross-protection study conducted previously with H-120 vaccinated birds challenged with IBVPR03, we found no tracheal lesions in unvaccinated birds and some birds whose gonads were examined presented lesions in the testis and ovary. Moreover, IBVPR03 was subsequently S1-genotyped as Massachusetts with a high genomic similarity between the IBVPR03 and H-120 vaccine strains [6] .

Tissue samples were processed using standard histological procedures, embedded in paraffin wax, and cut into 4-mm sections. Afterwards, sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin for histological examination by light microscopy. Tracheal samples were assigned with scores ranging from 0 to 3. A score of zero identifies the absence of injury, while cases with mild, moderate, and severe injury were classified as 1, 2, and 3, respectively. The following morphological characteristics were recorded: loss of cilia (0 to 3), loss of epithelial cells (0 to 3), depletion of epithelial glands (0 to 3), inflammatory infiltration (0 to 3), edema (0 to 3), inflammatory infiltration in the adventitia (0 to 3), and epithelial hyperplasia (0 to 1). Final scores for the histopathology of the trachea (per bird) were calculated by summing the scores for each of the analyzed parameters. Since we observed macroscopic changes in the testis of one animal belonging to the NONVAC/PR03 unit at 47 days old, we kept 2 chicks from each group (NONVAC/PR03 and VAC/PR03) until 49 days for the collection of gonads, in addition to the trachea.",

RT-qPCR reaction was carried out in triplicate with GoTaq\u00ae Probe 1-Step RT-qPCR system (Promega\u00ae), 750 nM of each primer, 200 nM of probe, and 4 \u03bcL of RNA sample, with the manufacturer's amplification conditions, using 7500 Real-Time PCR System (Applied Biosystems\u00ae). All samples were tested for chicken actin \u03b2 as internal control [14] using the same reagents and thermocycler, but with 500 nM of each primer, 150 nM of probe, and 2 \u03bcL of RNA. After purification with ExoSAP-IT\u2122 (Thermo Fisher\u00ae), the specificity of RT-qPCR reaction for IBV was checked by bidirectional sequencing using a fluorescent dye terminator kit (Applied Biosystems\u00ae), in a Mastercycler-Pro (Eppendorf\u00ae), followed by electrophoretic separation in a 3500XL sequencer (Applied Biosystems\u00ae). Sequencing data were edited using the DNAStar software and the nucleotide sequences were analyzed through GenBank searches.",

The dose used to challenge the birds in Experiment 2 (10 4 EID 50 /bird) was 10 times lower than in Experiment 1 (10 5 EID 50 /bird) since we were evaluating birds at a younger age with an experimental design that also comprised the evaluation of nephropathogenicity of IBVPR03, which is held in early ages [15] . In fact, Experiment 2 showed that the Brazilian strain IBVPR03 is pathogenic to the kidneys (Fig. 5) , corroborating clinical findings from outbreaks in South Brazil, and possibly, with the increase of the challenge dose, the injuries would be more severe, either in the kidneys or gonads. The most plausible explanation for the presence of IBV of the Mass genotype in birds vaccinated with the Massachusetts strain may be the insufficient immunity in the genital tract that was conferred by vaccination with the used Mass strain, despite the presence of elevated levels of systemic antibodies against this same strain that were induced by that same vaccine. Therefore, the anti-IBV antibodies that are present in the blood serum might exert a partial protective role preventing the development of lesions in some organs and/or tissues of the challenged birds, however not being able to prevent infection and the development of lesions in the genital tract of these birds. This could be due to other local immune mechanisms or ones that act more closely with these tissues, such as IgA antibodies or effector cytotoxic T cells that might not have been induced the vaccine [16, 17] . Also, it is important to emphasize that different IBV strains and other infectious agents usually co-infect commercial flocks enhancing the extent of pathogenic lesions and symptoms in the field.",

To date, most research regarding IBV in the reproductive tract examined its pathogenicity in mature chickens primarily investigating the negative impact of the viral replication in the ciliated epithelium of the oviduct and epididymis [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] . Nevertheless, reproductive impairment caused by IBV is more severe and enduring whenever young chicks are affected and, accordingly, this study laid emphasis on immature birds [24, 25] . Despite the fact that declines in egg production and quality are largely associated with oviduct damage, four-day-old chicks challenged in this study with IBVPR03 often presented follicle degeneration at 12 days of age (Fig. 1) . These data show that, in addition to possible changes in the oviduct, IBVPR03 may also reduce laying performance through its direct influence upon ovaries. Broadfoot et al. [ 26] reported that the earlier the age at which birds are infected with IBV, the greater the proportion of false layers (inoculation of 1-and 18-day-old chicks led to 26.6% and 9.3% of false layers, respectively). Afterwards, several other researchers focused on the IBV induction of false layers or abnormal oviducts [20, 21, 24, 25, 27, 28] , but only a few studies investigated IBV effects on the gonads [29] . Recently, Hong et al. [ 30] noticed that infections with a Korean IBV strain (SNU8067) in unvaccinated 16-week-old SPF hens inhibited formation of hierarchal ovarian follicles (80% of individuals) and oviduct maturation (50% of individuals). This finding suggests that ovarian follicles may be more susceptible than the oviduct and, in turn, drops in egg production may be a consequence of irregular ovarian follicle development. Furthermore, the same authors observed that 30% of vaccinated chickens exhibited moderate to marked aplasia of the ovarian follicles and moderate atrophy of oviducts, possibly from the use of inactivated oil-emulsion vaccines in SPF chickens without priming [30] . According to the latest molecular epidemiological surveys, 16.80 to 33.71% of the Brazilian poultry flocks positive for IBV were comprised of breeders. Among them, 21.68 to 81.35% had gonad samples positive for IBV or exhibited some sort of reproductive disorder [31, 32] . Together, these evidences strengthen the need of further studies to assess not only the significance of IBVPR03 or other Brazilian field isolates on egg output of laying hens and breeders, but also the efficacy of the existing vaccination protocols to the challenges posed by the emerging IBV variants.",

In roosters, some authors suggest that IBV is able to replicate in the epithelial lining of the efferent duct increasing the incidence of epididymal stones, which, in turn, decreases daily sperm production and fertility [18, 19, 33, 34] , but an unequivocal conclusion has not yet been established as a result of contradictory data [18, 19, 34, 35] . Besides, to our knowledge, very few studies include experimental IBV infections of SPF chicks in order to monitor their impact on male physiology and fertility. Most of the available information comes from correlations between vaccinations (with both attenuated and killed viruses) or epidemiological surveys and the occurrence of lithiasis, orchitis, or decreased sperm production [18, 19, 34] . It cannot be excluded that we may be unaware of some relevant, missed articles, but it seems that our study is one of the few providing experimental data describing the microscopic lesions of IBV in testis. In other words, there is a lack of knowledge regarding the pathology of IBV infection in the male reproductive tract. Although IBV venereal transmission has been previously documented, inoculation of IBV (Arkansas and Massachusetts strains) in 10-weekold roosters apparently failed to induce histopathological changes in testes [36] . Thus, it has yet to be determined whether, as observed in females, there is any negative correlation between the age of exposure to IBVPR03 (and other strains) and the degree of testicular alterations.",

However, multiple factors influence the content and integrity of nucleic acids such as tissue size, fixation temperature and duration, and the amount of time that elapses before the sample is fixed [37] , by the age of the tissue block [38] . In this context, we performed the RT-qPCR in order to detect the IBV RNA. From the 8 birds with gonadal injuries, 4 were positive to IBV RT-qPCR and although the high Ct values (35.84 to 37.42), probably by low viral load and RNA degradation in FFPE samples, the specificity of RT-qPCR reaction was also confirmed by bidirectional sequencing of the 4 sample amplicons.",

These data suggest that IBVPR03 may not use the respiratory tract as the primary site for replication. Earlier work, where the authors sequenced the 5\u2032-terminal of the S1 gene, indicates a high genomic similarity between the IBVPR03 and H-120 vaccine strains. Consequently, this field isolate was categorized as a Massachusetts genotype [6] . Subunit S1 is a primary target for host immune responses (via neutralizing antibodies) and it is determinant for the tissue tropism of IBV strains. These changes in tissue tropism could be a consequence of escaping mechanisms of the virus associated with the immune pressures driven by vaccination protocols for IBV [39, 40] . Furthermore, it has been demonstrated that immunity is not the only selective pressure on IBV [41] and the genetic diversity in viral isolates is attributed to shifts in population equilibrium of the replicating viral genomes even in the absence of immune selection pressure [42] . Such divergence between genotype and predominant pathotype or tissue tropism has also been reported in an IBV isolate from Egypt (Egypt/F/ 03), which, despite being classified as Massachusetts, showed a marked nephropathogenicity in experimentally infected SPF chickens [43] .",
