            "text": "Development is frequently accompanied by tissue-specific changes in protein and lipid glycosylation. Among these, modifications in the type and linkage of sialic acid have been reported [1] . The sialic acids comprise a group of more than 40 acidic sugars, which are derived from several enzymic modifications of N-acetylneuraminic acid (Neu5Ac) [2, 3] . They generally occupy terminal positions in the oligosaccharide chains of glycoconjugates where they are involved in mediating and regulating a variety of physiological cell-cell interactions and are also exploited by a number of pathogens as adhesion ligands [4] . N-glycolylneuraminic acid (Neu5Gc) is one of the most common sialic acid types and is formally derived by the addition of a hydroxy group to the N-acetyl moiety of Neu5Ac. Neu5Gc is abundant in the animal kingdom, although its expression in glycoconjugates varies widely, exhibiting considerable interspecies differences. Furthermore, within a certain species the appearance of Neu5Gc is tissue-and age-dependent [5] and may also be influenced by cell activation [6] and disease [7] .",

In all cases, a good correlation between the amount of Neu5Gc, the activity of the hydroxylase and the level of hydroxylase mRNA was observed. However, Western-blot analysis revealed considerable accumulation of less active enzyme in the post partum period, which persisted until adulthood. No evidence for cytosolic factors influencing the hydroxylase activity or for the formation of truncated enzyme was found, raising the possibility that other regulatory mechanisms are involved. The relevance of these results in the formation of Neu5Gc as a receptor for certain pig enteric pathogens is also discussed.",

Although evidence for ontogenic changes in hydroxylase activity was reported [13, 16] , these assays were performed under nonquantitative conditions owing to the omission of exogenous cytochrome b & and cytochrome b & reductase [17] , prompting additional investigations. Since post-natal modifications in the sialic acid profile of pig and rodent small intestine have been found in several studies [18, 19] , the pig tissue was adopted in the present study as a model system for investigations on developmental changes in Neu5Gc biosynthesis.",

Additionally, pig rotavirus, which similarly causes diarrhoea in young pigs, binds to GM3(Neu5Gc) [15] . Another pathogen, pig-transmissible gastroenteritis coronavirus, also recognizes glycoconjugates containing \u03b12,3-bound Neu5Gc [25] . Enhanced levels of Neu5Gc-containing glycoconjugates were found in newborn pigs, which are particularly susceptible to these infections [15] . Studies on the regulation of Neu5Gc expression are, therefore, important for our understanding of the aetiology of these economically relevant pig diseases.",

All animals were killed by a lethal injection of pentabarbitone, the intestinal tissues were immediately excised and any residual gut contents were removed carefully. The small intestine was divided into proximal and distal segments for foetal tissues and samples of duodenum, jejunum and ileum were taken from all other animals.

To obtain probes for Northern-blot analysis, the plasmids were digested with EcoRI (Promega). Double-stranded DNA probes of 310 bp were purified and used in Northern-blot analyses following standard methods. In summary, total RNA was extracted from flashfrozen jejunum tissues from newborn (n l 3), suckled (n l 2), weaned (n l 2) and adult pigs (n l 2) using the acid guanidinium thiocyanate-phenol chloroform method [27] .

The expression of Neu5Gc and CMP-Neu5Ac hydroxylase has previously been associated with mature T-lymphocyte populations in pigs [10] . The higher levels of Neu5Gc in the ileum at later stages of development may therefore partially result from the relatively large number of intra-epithelial and sub-mucosal lymphocytes in this region compared with the proximal intestine [37] . A histological analysis of Neu5Gc expression is evidently required to clarify this issue. The intestinal microflora may also influence the biosynthesis of glycoconjugates during the postnatal development of the small intestine [38] . Thus, commensal and pathogenic bacteria promote changes in the lymphoid tissue and modulate the formation and glycosylation of intestinal mucins [39, 40] . Furthermore, parasitic nematode infections in rats result in reduced intestinal CMP-Neu5Ac hydroxylase mRNA expression and decreased levels of Neu5Gc in mucins [7] . Since the major changes in Neu5Gc content reported here occur during the colonization of the gut by normal enteric bacteria, microbial influences on glycosylation are possible and warrant further investigation.",

Furthermore, the results on the spatial distribution of Neu5Gc are also relevant to the site of infection by these pathogens. For example, E. coli with K99 fimbriae were found to adhere preferentially to and colonize distal regions of pig small intestine [43, 44] . Similarly, pig transmissible gastroenteritis virus was found to be most pathogenic in jejunum and ileum [45] and pig rotavirus initially infects the ileum [46] . Distal regions of the pig small intestine therefore appear to be more prone to infection by pathogens, which require Neu5Gc for adhesion.

Similar conclusions were reached on the basis of studies on various adult pig tissues [10] and pig lymphocyte subpopulations [11] . Developmental changes in the expression of GM3(Neu5Gc) in rat small intestine were also found to correspond to the activity of this enzyme [16] .",

In a preliminary report [48] , it was suggested that cytosolic factors might regulate the hydroxylase activity. However, in mixed enzyme assays using tissue supernatants exhibiting high or low enzyme activity, no evidence for the presence of such substances was found ( Figure 6 ). Furthermore, in the Western blots there was no evidence for an inactive, truncated form of the hydroxylase, observed previously in mouse liver [49] .",

Interestingly, a similar phenomenon was also observed in the heart and lung of adult pigs [10] . The origin or function of this less active protein is unknown. To date, no posttranslational modifications of the hydroxylase are known. The incorporation of a [2Fe-2S] cluster is probably an obligatory modification in the generation of active enzyme [50] . However, since little is known about the formation of such centres in cytosolic proteins [51] , its possible role in influencing hydroxylase activity remains unclear. The observed accumulation of hydroxylase protein may reflect a decrease in its degradation, though as yet nothing is known about the mechanism of hydroxylase protein turnover. The correlation between the enzyme activity and the level of mRNA suggests that newly synthesized enzyme is detected in the activity test, and that differential degradation rates at various stages of development or in certain tissues [10] may contribute to the observed discrepancies between the amounts of hydroxylase protein and hydroxylase activity. Clearly, further research is required not only to elucidate the factors which govern the transcription of the hydroxylase gene, but also to study the holoenzyme assembly and turnover of the enzyme protein.
