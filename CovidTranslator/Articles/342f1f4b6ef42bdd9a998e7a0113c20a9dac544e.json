As a result of the successful eradication of smallpox with the vaccinia virus (VACV), the general population is no longer required to receive a smallpox vaccine, and will have no protection against smallpox. This lack of immunity is a concern due to the potential for use of smallpox as a biological weapon. Considerable progress has been made in the development of subunit-based smallpox vaccines resulting from the identification of VACV protective antigens. It also offers the possibility of using antigens from VARV to formulate the next generation subunit-based smallpox vaccines. Here, we show that codon-optimized DNA vaccines expressing three VARV antigens (A30, B7 and F8) and their recombinant protein counterparts elicited high-titer, cross-reactive, VACV neutralizing antibody responses in mice. Vaccinated mice were protected from intraperitoneal and intranasal challenges with VACV. These results suggest the feasibility of a subunit smallpox vaccine based on the VARV antigen sequences to induce immunity against poxvirus infection.",

However, due to safety concerns over the manufacture of the traditional VACV vaccine, the production of this type of vaccine, such as DryVax (Wyeth Laboratories, Inc.) in the United States and derived from the NYCBH strain of vaccinia virus, is no longer considered acceptable since termination of its production in 1982. Reports of adverse events including myocarditis that are associated with immunization with VACV (Casey et al., 2005) have prevented the completion of a 2002 re-vaccination campaign among non-military high-risk populations, such as healthcare professionals. Currently, VACV is still the main smallpox vaccine and a newer generation of live-attenuated VACV vaccines is being produced in tissue cultured cells to allow for stockpiling in hopes of being able to protect the general population in the event of a bioterrorist attack (Artenstein et al., 2005; Fang et al., 2006; Monath et al., 2004) .",

            "text": "Recent studies have made great strides in demonstrating the use of subunit-based smallpox vaccines to induce protective immunity against smallpox. Poxviruses, which include variola major (VARV), vaccinia virus (VACV), monkeypox virus, ectromelia virus (ECTV) and others, belong to the orthopoxvirus genus and considerable cross-protection has been observed between these viruses. Poxviruses are large viruses with a genome that encodes about 200 proteins and it is this complexity which has partly delayed the identification of protective antigens against these viruses. Several potential targets of protective immunity have only recently been confirmed in well organized animal studies. There are two forms of infectious poxvirus: the intracellular mature virus (IMV) and the extracellular enveloped virus (EEV). Recent studies have shown that vaccinia virus IMV-specific antigens, A27, L1 and D8, and EEV-specific antigens, A33 and B5, are immunogenic and protective, albeit variably, against VACV infection in mice (Fogg et al., 2004; Galmiche et al., 1999; Hooper et al., 2000; Hooper et al., 2004; Pulford et al., 2004; Sakhatskyy et al., 2006; Xiao et al., 2007) , against ectromelia virus (ECTV) (Xiao et al., 2007) , and against monkeypox in non-human primates (Heraud et al., 2006; Hooper et al., 2004) . Furthermore, a four-gene combination DNA vaccine that encodes two IMV (A27 and L1) and two EEV (A33 and B5) antigens was protective against vaccinia virus challenge in mice and induced antibody responses against monkeypox virus in non-human primates (Hooper, Custer, and Thompson, 2003) . However, these subunit vaccines were not as protective as the live-attenuated vaccinia virus vaccine unless polyvalent formulations and/or multiple immunizations are used to achieve comparable levels of protection inducible by one single vaccinia inoculation (Fogg et al., 2004; Hooper et al., 2000; Hooper, Custer, and Thompson, 2003; Pulford et al., 2004; Sakhatskyy et al., 2006) .",

            "text": "Why the live-vaccinia virus vaccine offers better protection against infection is unclear and studies have been conducted to examine the contributions of the two arms of the immune system in offering protective immunity against poxvirus infection by depletion of B-and T-cells prior to primary and/or secondary challenge with various poxviruses, offering conflicting results. Antibody-mediated depletion of B-cells, but not of CD4+ or CD8+ T-cells, prevented vaccineinduced protection from a lethal intravenous challenge with monkeypox virus (Edghill-Smith et al., 2005) and poxvirus in a mouse model (Belyakov et al., 2003) indicating that this protective response is primarily mediated by antibodies and that vaccinia-induced antibodies are necessary and sufficient for protection against a lethal poxvirus challenge. Additional results confirming the role of antibody responses show that passive administration of VACV antibodies confers protection from subsequent lethal monkeypox (Edghill-Smith et al., 2005; Hooper et al., 2004) and that type I/II IFN deficient, CD8+ depleted mice were able to survive a secondary infection with ECTV (Panchanathan, Chaudhri, and Karupiah, 2005) . However, to determine immune responses in primary and secondary vaccination against smallpox in humans, a recent study has shown that positive CMI responses could be elicited seven days after infection in secondary immunized volunteers (i.e., vaccinia non-na\u00efve) and that this response preceded increases in antibody titers (Kennedy et al., 2004) . Furthermore, an important role for interferon (IFN) and less of a role for antibodies in conferring protection against poxvirus was observed following a primary infection (Panchanathan, Chaudhri, and Karupiah, 2005; Pulford et al., 2004) . While the exact roles of each arm of the immune system in mediating poxvirus infection have not been completely elucidated, the majority of recent reports point to a greater role of antibodies against various poxvirus antigens in eliciting protection against poxvirus infection. Therefore, it appears as though subunit-based smallpox vaccines that induce poxvirus-specific antibodies would be effective in conferring protection from poxvirus infection.",

A recent study examining the differences between the major neutralizing B5 antigenic site on vaccinia virus and it's variola virus ortholog B6 demonstrated that from a panel of 26 anti-B5 monoclonal antibodies only 16 cross reacted with B6 protein and out of 10 that did not at least 3 were EEV neutralizing or blocked comet formation (Aldaz-Carroll, 2007) . These results indicate that the production of a subunit-based vaccine using VARV antigens rather than those from VACV may confer greater protection against smallpox infection and there is no apparent reason not to use VARV antigens with a subunit-based vaccine. While safety issues over using the variola virus itself as a live attenuated vaccine lead to the use of antigens from the vaccinia virus, the production of a subunit-based vaccine does not incorporate live viruses into its design and therefore eliminates the safety concerns over using variola virus antigens.",

At least in theory, this approach should minimize the chance of reduced protection due to any sequence difference that may exist between VARV and VACV, particularly when antigen-specific immune responses, such as neutralizing antibody determinants and/or dominant T-cell epitopes, are involved. In the current study, three VARV antigens (A30, B7 and F8) were chosen based on the high immunogenicity and potential of protection from their VACV counterparts (A27, B5 and D8) as shown in literature and from our recently published studies (Sakhatskyy et al., 2006) .",

For VARV, the India 1967 (VARV-IND) and Bangladesh 1975 (VARV-BSH) strain sequences were used. The orthologous VARV protein for the VACV A27 antigen is A30 for VARV-IND and A31 for VARV-BSH; for the B5 antigen the orthologous protein is B7 for VARV-IND and B6 for VARV-BSH, and for the D8 antigen the orthologous protein for both VARV-IND and VARV-BSH is F8 (Shchelkunov, 1995; Shchelkunov, Massung, and Esposito, 1995) . Sequences of these three proteins are highly homologous but not completely identical to the VACV antigen sequences: three amino acid differences exist between A27 and A30/A31, 23 amino acid differences between B5 and B6/B7 and 12 amino acid differences between D8 and F8 proteins (Fig 1) . Some of these differences occurred with only one of the two VARV strains, thereby further improving the overall level of homology.",

All three antigens were present in both the cell lysate (L) and culture supernatant (S) and their molecular weights, in general, matched those from the VACV-WR strain grown in Vero cells, except B7 DNA vaccine which only expresses a smaller molecular weight ectodomain of B7 protein. The apparent molecular weight of B7 antigen in lysate was slightly larger than B7 in supernatant -indicating additional post-translational processing of B7 protein as an intermediate product prior to secretion. Non-transfected 293T cells and uninfected Vero cells did not show pox-specific antigens (Fig. 2 ). In addition, we show that recombinant A30, B7 and F8 proteins (rA30, rF8 and rB7) were successfully produced and purified from an E. coli expression system using the same synthetic A30, B7 and F8 genes ( Fig  2) . These results also show that the B7 protein forms dimers in its non-denatured condition.

This has been made possible through the identification of the immunogenic and protective vaccinia virus IMV-specific antigens (e.g., A27, L1 and D8) and EEV-specific antigens (e.g. A33 and B5). These antigens have shown to be immunogenic and protective against VACV infection in mice (Fogg et al., 2004; Galmiche et al., 1999; Hooper et al., 2000; Hooper et al., 2004; Pulford et al., 2004; Sakhatskyy et al., 2006; Xiao et al., 2007) , against ectromelia virus (ECTV) (Xiao et al., 2007) , and against monkeypox virus in non-human primates (Heraud et al., 2006; Hooper et al., 2004) . Despite this great progress, these previous studies used antigen genes cloned from VACV or monkeypox virus rather than those from VARV to induce broad and protective antibody responses mainly due to safety concerns over using VARV as a model and to the difficulty in producing VARV infection in species other than humans and some non-human primates. Although the sequences are very similar between these viruses (i.e., VACV or monkeypox virus) and VARV, they are not completely identical. In a recent study, the properties of the vaccinia virus EEV protein B5 and its Variola ortholog B6 were compared in order to determine whether B6 is a better choice as a subunit vaccine against smallpox. This study found that from a panel of 26 anti-B5 monoclonal antibodies only 16 cross reacted with B6 protein and out of the 10 that did not, at least 3 were EEV neutralizing or blocked comet formation (Aldaz-Carroll, 2007) . With current technology, it has become possible to produce synthetic gene sequences based on the known VARV protein sequences, which may be more immunologically desirable in producing immune responses against smallpox infection than the genes from another pox virus. It could be argued that VARV-based antigens should be more compatible with the invading smallpox infection than VACV antigens although the definitive proof can only be obtained in a VARV challenge study which is not readily available due to security control of VARV reagents.",

Furthermore, when these VARV antigens were given in combination, they induced neutralizing responses similar to those produced by their VACV counterparts, D8 and A27 when administered in combination (data not shown). This increase in immunogenicity after administration of a combination of antigens compared to when administered as a monovalent formulation is consistent with studies done with VACV antigens. Immunization with DNA vaccines encoding for a single VACV membrane protein induced only modest anti-VACV reactivity (Pulford et al., 2004 ) as compared to when these antigens were given in combination (Hooper et al., 2000; Hooper, Custer, and Thompson, 2003) . Mice that were vaccinated with polyvalent (i.e., A30, F8 and B7) VARV antigen DNA vaccines were protected from intraperitoneal challenge. When the VACV challenge was administered intranasally, mice that were immunized with either the polyvalent recombinant protein or DNA vaccines were protected. Furthermore, we observed that with only two immunizations, the protein-based subunit vaccine was more effective than DNA vaccines in eliciting higher antibody responses and better protection in the dose ranges tested in the current study with the adjuvant used for protein immunization. Since the current study was not designed to compare the difference between DNA and protein based VARV vaccines, more dedicated studies, especially in non-human primates, are needed to further identify any qualitative and quantitative differences in immunogenicity and protective efficacy for these two types of VARV vaccines.",

Given the decreased cross-reactivity of anti-B5 VACV antigens with B6 antigens of variola major (Aldaz-Carroll, 2007) , our study demonstrated that it is feasible that a variola major antigen-based vaccine can be produced and may potentially confer more matched immune responses and/or greater protection following exposure to VARV. Results from this study show that there is no apparent advantage of substituting original VARV antigens for their orthologs from less virulent poxviruses, as indicated by the similar levels of neutralizing antibodies and levels of protection against VACV challenge between the VARV antigen-based vaccines, developed in this study, and the orthologous VACV antigens. Results from the current study suggest that future efforts in the development of subunit-based smallpox vaccines may be better suited to focus on optimizing the conditions necessary to elicit immunological responses from the variola major protective antigens themselves rather than those from the vaccinia virus.",
