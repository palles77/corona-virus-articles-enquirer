            "text": "The protective effect of egg yolk and colostrum powders prepared from hens and cows vaccinated with inactivated bovine coronavirus (BCV) antigen was evaluated in a challenge model with a virulent BCV strain. Twenty three calves from BCV-free herds were randomly divided into control and several treatment groups. All calves were orally challenged with 1 x 10 9 TCIDso of the virulent Kakegawa strain of BCV at 24 to 36 h after birth. Calves in treatment groups received either egg yolk powder or cow colostrum containing BCV specific antibodies. Daily treatment with these antibody preparations started 6 h until 7 days post-challenge. Control calves which received no antibody had severe diarrhea and all died within 6 days after infection. In contrast, calves fed milk containing egg yolk or colostrum with neutralization titers of 1:2560 or 1:10 240 respectively all survived and had positive weight gain unlike the other treatment groups. These results indicate that the orally administered egg yolk and colostrum powders protected against BCV-induced diarrhea in neonatal calves and that the egg yolk used provided a higher degree of protection compared to colostrum powder on a titer basis. Treatment with whole egg yolk from immunized hens therefore provides a more efficacious alternative to the existing methods of specific passive protection against BCV. \u00a9 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.",

            "text": "Bovine coronavirus (BCV) is an important agent of neonatal calf diarrhea and is associated with acute diarrhea of adult cattle referred to as winter dysentery. This virus is known to cause a more severe disease and higher mortalities than those caused by the bovine rotavirus because it multiplies in both the small intestine and the large intestine whereas the rotavirus infects only the small intestine (Kapil et al., 1990) . To determine protective immune responses against BCV, there have been reports analyzing the titers of passive and active antibody isotypes to BCV in serum and mucosal surface (Heckert et al., 1991a,b) . Coronavirus vaccines are available to control BCV diarrhea, but have not been found to be efficacious in protecting against infection (Heckert et al., 1991c; Kapil et al., 1990) . In the case of passive immunization, there were few reports on oral administration of antibodies derived from serum or colostrum against BCV. Recently, chicken egg yolk antibodies have been used for prophylaxis and treatment of infectious intestinal diseases. We have been investigating the efficacy of the chicken egg yolk antibodies in calves against enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) (Ikemori et al., 1992) and bovine rotavirus . The objectives of the study reported here were (l) to evaluate the efficacy of chicken egg yolk antibodies and cow colostrum antibodies against BCV-induced diarrhea in calves where BCV causes a more severe disease than bovine rotavirus, and (2) to compare the therapeutic value of chicken egg yolk and cow colostrum antibody.",

Calves were randomly distributed as non-treated control group (group 1), egg powder treatment groups (groups 2 and 3) and colostrum powder treatment groups (groups 4, 5 and 6). At 24 to 36 h after birth, calves were orally challenge-exposed with 1 \u00d7 109.0 TCIDs0 of the virulent Kakegawa strain (Fig. l) . At 6 h after BCV challenge, the treatment groups were given between 1.5 and 2 1 of milk containing the egg yolk or colostrum powder. Subsequently, this was given 2 times per day for 7 days after challenge exposure. Particularly, the egg powder treatment groups 2 and 3 were given milk containing antibody titers of 1:1280 and 1:2560 (0.25 and 0.5 g of egg powder) respectively. On the other hand, colostrum powder treatment groups 4, 5 and 6 were given milk containing antibody titers of 1:2560, 1:5120 and 1:10 240 (0.5, 1.0 and 2.0 g of colostrum powder) respectively. The control group received no antibody. The clinical response of each calf was recorded throughout the experiment and evaluated in terms of fecal consistency score, weight gain, and mortality. Fecal scoring was done by persons who did not know the treatment condition for each calf. Scoring was done 2 times per day with numerical scores as follows: 0 = normal, 1 = soft consistency, 2 = mild O Q diarrhea, 3 = severe watery diarrhea and death. The cumulative fecal score of each calf was expressed as total score for 7 days. Examination of feces for infectious BCV was done daily for 7 days by culturing the homogenates of the specimens in HRT-18 cells. On day 7 post-challenge, samples of the middle part of jejunum and colon were tested for infectious BCV by the same method. Body weight gain of calves was expressed as percentage weight gain at day 7 over initial body weight on day 0. The serum of calves collected at the start and at the end of the experiment were checked for anti-BCV antibodies by neutralization test.",

This is to fill the gap in the literature concerning passive protection against BCV using specific antibody. Our data showed that significant protection was achieved in calves treated with high titers of the egg yolk and colostrum antibodies against the challenge strain (Table 1) . Survival against coronavirus-induced mortality was 100% when 1:2560 and 1:10 240 antibody titers were used for treatment of calves with the egg yolk or colostrum powder, respectively. Particularly, the calves treated with the egg yolk antibody did not have severe diarrhea and had higher weight gains. About 8 g of egg yolk powder were obtained from one chicken egg and only one egg yolk was needed to protect one calf from diarrhea over a 7-day course of treatment. The present data corroborate an earlier protection trial using egg antibody specific for ETEC in ETEC-infected calves (Ikemori et al., 1992) .",

Although diarrhea was observed in calves treated with these antibody powders, the cumulative fecal scores were higher in the calves treated with colostrum than those treated with egg yolk. It appears that greater amount of colostrum powder than egg yolk powder is necessary to prevent diarrhea. The virus titers in the intestines of groups 4 to 6 calves were high irrespective of the dose of antibody given; virus titers in the small intestines tended to be higher than in the large intestines in the above groups (Table 2 ). It was speculated that continued viral proliferation in the small intestine was the reason for the persistent diarrhea observed in these groups of calves.",

Firstly, the avidity of antibodies derived from colostrum is lower than that of antibodies obtained from egg yolk (Ikemori et al., 1993) . Compared to colostral antibodies, the BCV specific antibody from egg yolk may have reacted more strongly and stably with coronavirus epitopes in vivo in the neutralization reaction. Secondly, less chicken antibody may have been digested and inactivated by the gastric juice. The antibodies that escaped digestion in the stomach are still functional in the small intestine. The antibody of the egg yolk is thought to be of almost the same stability or slightly more susceptible to gastric juice than mammalian antibody (Shimizu et al., 1992) . However, the present data demonstrated that the antibody from egg yolk was more effective than colostral antibody suggesting that yolk components in the egg yolk powder such as proteins and fats may have protected the immunoglobulin fraction from digestive enzymes and allowed safe passage of yolk immunoglobulins through the stomach enough to confer protection in the target areas of the small intestine of calves. On the other hand, colostral proteins and fats may be more susceptible to digestion by gastric juice or quantitatively less than those of the egg yolk.",
