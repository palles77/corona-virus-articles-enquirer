In response to the need, we have developed a simulation-based optimization methodology for generating dynamic predictive mitigation strategies for pandemic outbreaks affecting several regions. Our methodology can accommodate varying virus and population dynamics. It progressively allocates a limited budget to procure vaccines and antivirals, capacities for their administration, and resources required to enforce social distancing. The methodology uses measures of morbidity, mortality, and social distancing, which are translated into the costs of lost productivity and medical services. The simulation model was calibrated using historic pandemic data. We illustrate the use of our methodology on a mock outbreak involving over four million people residing in four major population centers in Florida, USA. A sensitivity analysis is presented to estimate the impact of changes in the budget availability and variability of some of the critical parameters of mitigation strategies. The methodology is intended to assist public health policy makers.",

As of December 2009, the World Health Organization (WHO) has reported 447 cases of confirmed avian-to-human transmission of H5N1 virus resulting in 263 deaths worldwide (World Health Organization 2010a). Although human-to-human transmission of H5N1 has so far been reported for a few isolated cases, a mutation of this virus leading to a broader human-to-human transmission presents a threat to our quality of life. A milder human-to-human transmissible H1N1 virus subtype surfaced in Mexico in the Spring of 2009 and propagated to a global H1N1 pandemic outbreak. As of late December 2009, 208 countries were affected with a total number of deaths of at least 11,516 (World Health Organization 2010b). Most experts believe that the next pandemic will likely be caused by a highly pathogenic virus for which we have little or no pre-existing immunity (Schoenstadt 2009 ).",

The practicality and effectiveness of mitigation strategies also depend on the available emergency response infrastructure, mitigation resources, and resource allocation policies. With the available technology, even after a new virus subtype is identified, a surge production of adequate vaccine stockpile can take up to 9 months (Fedson and Hant 2003; Aunins et al. 2000) . This may limit the use of vaccine as an effective mitigation resource in the critical early stage of a pandemic. Even in the best case scenario, when the emerged virus subtype has a known epidemiology, the existing vaccine stockpile will be insufficient (World Health Organization 2009; WHO Global Influenza Programme 2009). Furthermore, the supply of antiviral drugs, immunizers, healthcare providers, hospital beds, and logistics will also be constrained. The challenge of developing feasible and effective mitigation strategies, attested by the H1N1 2009 outbreak, has been acknowledged by WHO (WHO Global Influenza Programme 2009) and echoed by national public health authorities, including the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC; Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 2007a; US Department of Health & Human Services 2007).",

            "text": "The existing general literature on pandemic modeling aims to address various aspects of the pandemic process including (a) underlying spatio-temporal structure, (b) contact mechanism, (c) disease transmission, (d) disease natural history, and (e) development of containment and mitigation strategies. These aspects are closely interrelated. For instance, the nature of the spatio-temporal structure, including composition of the social mixing groups and temporal dynamics of the affected population, drives the contact process which is the main determinant of the disease transmission (Larson 2007; Halloran et al. 2002; Ferguson et al. 2006; Wu et al. 2006b) . A comprehensive decision-aid model for containment and mitigation must take into account all of the above constituents; it must incorporate the mechanism of disease progression, from initial infection, to asymptomatic earlier phase, symptom manifestation, and final health outcome (recovery or death) (Handel et al. 2009; Pourbohloul et al. 2009; Atkinson and Wein 2008) ; it must also consider the population dynamics of disease spread, including individual susceptibility (Pitzer et al. 2007a,b) , transmissibility (Handel et al. 2009; Yang et al. 2007 Yang et al. , 2009a Cauchemez et al. 2004) , and human behaviors that mediate infection generation (Colizza et al. 2006; Epstein et al. 2007 Epstein et al. , 2008 Halloran 2006) ; finally, it must incorporate the impact of pharmaceutical and non-pharmaceutical prevention and intervention, including vaccination, antiviral therapy, social distancing, school and workplace closures, travel restrictions, and use of low-cost measures, such as face masks and hand washing (Longini et al. 2004; Wu et al. 2006b ; Atkinson and Wein 2008; Yang et al. 2009b; Tang et al. 2006; Scharfstein et al. 2006; Glass et al. 2006; Lipsitch et al. 2007; Nigmatulina and Larson 2009 ). In essence, effective mitigation strategies have a twofold objective: (a) systemically to alter the disease dynamics and control disease progression with available clinical therapies, and (b) to alter the social dynamics and contain disease propagation within the affected communities. Mitigation strategies vary in the composition of the target groups, geo-spatial coverage, and implementation time.",

Notable examples of such models are dynamic compartmental approaches, typically represented in the form of a set of differential equations, which delineate transitions between disease phases (e.g., susceptible, exposed, symptomatic infected, etc., Larson 2007; Arino et al. 2006; Dargatz et al. 2006; Ferguson et al. 2003) . Based on the solution approach, the mathematical models can be subdivided into analytical (or closed form) and iterative. Compared to the statistical models, the dynamic-iterative models feature more granular composition of the mixing groups (Larson 2007; Nigmatulina and Larson 2009; Wu et al. 2006a ). However, the degree of granularity is still limited since any additional spatio-temporal considerations can negatively impact the computational robustness of the models. Description of the contact processes in mathematical models generally does not take into account changes in the behavioral patterns during the course of the pandemic (e.g., compliance to intervention by vaccination and social distancing, Arino et al. 2006; Dargatz et al. 2006; Ferguson et al. 2003) . Consideration of behavioral aspects can be found in some of the recent simulation-based models (Kelso et al. 2009; Halder et al. 2010; Yasuda and Suzuki 2009; Milne et al. 2008) . Furthermore, mathematical models are typically based on the infection pathways and disease progression that are invariant to time and individual attributes (Dargatz et al. 2006; Ferguson et al. 2003) .",

In contrast to the statistical and mathematical models, the simulation models are capable of providing most detailed description of population dynamics whereby each individual can be assigned a set of attributes (e.g., age, gender, community, etc.) that can be modified without altering the general model structure Uribe et al. 2008) . However, such comprehensive descriptive granularity is achieved at the expense of higher data demand and substantial computational burden. As a result, most existing simulation-based approaches incorporate statistical and/or mathematical submodels (e.g., for infection generation) in order to attain an effective balance between model accuracy and practicality Savachkin et al. 2010b) .",

These approaches first aim to implement a form of social distancing to reduce the contact between the susceptible and the infected. The infected population is then treated with an antiviral therapy to reduce infectiousness, and the susceptible is vaccinated to increase their immunity. For example, Wu et al. (2006b) implemented social distancing for all contacted and symptomatic cases followed by antiviral application. Such strategies, which appear to be more discriminating and thus less expensive, have been found to be particularly efficient for low transmissibility scenarios (i.e., scenarios with the values of the basic reproduction number below 1.8, Ferguson et al. 2005; Mills et al. 2004) .",

MIDAS cross-validated the models by simulating the city of Chicago, with 8.6M inhabitants, and implementing targeted layered containment (TLC). Under TLC, the symptomatic infectious cases refrain from going to work (take liberal leave), receive antiviral treatment, and become subject to household quarantine; the asymptomatic contacts receive targeted antiviral prophylaxis (TAP) and become subject to household quarantine. The research findings of the MIDAS network and other institutions (Atkinson and Wein 2008; Glass et al. 2006 ) were used in a recent \"Modeling Community Containment for Pandemic Influenza\" report by the Institute of Medicine (IOM), US, to formulate a set of recommendations for mitigating PI at the local level (Committee on Modeling Community Containment for Pandemic Influenza 2006).

Research protocols should be developed, approved, and put in place now to generate the information needed during an outbreak to inform models, and improve their disease sub-models.\" The report also strongly recommends (1) \"that future modeling efforts incorporate broader outcome measures ... to include the costs and benefits of intervention strategies\", and (2) \"that models examining the potential effectiveness of school and workplace closures on mitigating pandemic influenza include a broader range of closure options.\" We add here that most current approaches focus on assessment of policies defined a priori; few of the existing models for design of synergistic mitigation strategies are \"learning\", i.e., capable of predicting of and adapting to changes in the course of a pandemic, and ultimately generating a dynamic optimal strategy (Savachkin et al. 2010b) . Furthermore, the majority of the current simulation models feature a singleregion design (see Appendix Table 1 ). In Savachkin et al. (2010b) , we developed a simulation-based optimization model for generating mitigation strategies for crossregional pandemic outbreaks. The model was implemented on a sample outbreak and the resultant strategy was compared to the existing governmental pro-rata distribution policy, which allocates mitigation resources to each affected region in proportion to its population (HHS 2007) .",

The methodology is driven by a large-scale simulation-based dynamic optimization model that incorporates varying virus epidemiology and region-specific population dynamics. The model generates mitigation strategies for an efficient, progressive allocation of limited resources, including stockpiles of vaccines and antiviral drugs, healthcare capacities for administration of vaccination and antiviral therapy, and social distancing enforcement resources. The optimization control seeks dynamically to minimize the impact of ongoing outbreaks and the expected impact of potential outbreaks, and allocates the resources accordingly. The methodology considers measures of morbidity, mortality, and social distancing, translated into the cost of lost productivity and medical expenses (societal and economic costs). The model was calibrated using historic pandemic data and tested on a sample cross-regional outbreak in Florida, USA, with over four million inhabitants. We also present a sensitivity analysis for estimating the marginal impact (measured in terms of the average total pandemic cost and the average number of fatalities) of changes in the total budget availability and variability of some critical decision factors. These factors included: (a) vaccine efficacy, (b) efficacy of antiviral therapy, (c) social distancing conformance level, (d) social distancing declaration threshold, and (e) social distancing period.",

(2010b) ; (d) our study attempts to analyze the effect of social distancing policies (namely, the target population conformance) on the dynamics of societal and economic costs; (e) in this paper, we also present a short description of our decision-aid simulation software made freely available to general public through our web site.

Those of them who belong to a prespecified mortality risk group receive an antiviral treatment, to reduce their mortality probability (see Eq. 3). It is assumed that an antiviral becomes effective immediately. The antiviral application is subject to availability of the antiviral stockpile and the administration capacity, measured in terms of the number of certified nurses. Both the antiviral application and vaccination are affected by a number of social behavioral factors, including conformance of the target population, its degree of risk perception, and associated compliance of healthcare personnel (Maunder et al. 2003; Robertson et al. 2004; Pearson et al. 2006) . The conformance level of the target population could be affected by the demographical profile of the region (Keane et al. 2005; Niederhauser et al. 2001; Rhodes and Hergenrather 2002; Rosenthal et al. 1995; Smailbegovic et al. 2003) and quality of the public information available (Colorado Department of Human Services Division of Mental Health 2009), among other factors. The degree of risk perception of the target population could be impacted by a negative experience developed during pharmaceutical campaigns of the previous outbreaks (Safranek et al. 1991; Cummings et al. 1979 Non-pharmaceutical mitigation For a social distancing mediation, we adopted a guidance suggested by CDC, USA (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 2007b). The guidance establishes five categories of pandemic severity (from 1 to 5) and recommends different quarantine and closure policies for each of the categories. The categories are determined based on the value of the case fatality ratio (CFR), the cumulative proportion of the number of fatalities in the total infected population. Our simulation model periodically reassesses the CFR value during the pandemic course. For the CFR values lower than 0.1% (which corresponds to Category 1), voluntary at-home isolation of the infected cases is implemented. If the CFR falls in the range between 0.1 and 1.0% (Categories 2 and 3), in addition to the above at-home isolation, the following measures are recommended: (a) voluntary quarantine of households members of infected cases and (b) child and adult social distancing. Finally, for the CFR values exceeding 1.0% (Categories 4 and 5), all the above measures are implemented. Alike pharmaceutical measures, the effectiveness of social distancing mitigation is also affected by several of the behavioral factors mentioned above (Colorado Department of Human Services Division of Mental Health 2009). Our model considers a certain social distancing conformance level, which can vary based on the demographics profile. Travel restrictions considered in the model included regional air and land border control for outgoing infected travelers (for details, see the testbed implementation in Sect. 4).",

Mitigation resources include stockpiles of vaccine(s) and antiviral drug(s), hospital beds, capacities for vaccination and antiviral administration, social distancing enforcement resources, among others.

The last column contains the hourly contact rates for each mixing group type. The hourly schedules (Savachkin et al. 2010a ) were adopted from Das and Savachkin (2008) . Each infected individual was assigned a daily travel probability of 0.24% (Bureau of Transportation Statistics 2002), of which 7% was by air and 93% by land transportation.

Infection detection probabilities for regional border controls for symptomatic cases were assumed to be 95 and 90% (Ortutay 2010) , for air and land transportation, respectively. These values were reduced by 70% for asymptomatic travelers (Ortutay 2010) . Travel bans were implemented for all detected infectious cases. An undetected infectious traveler was assumed to trigger a regional outbreak in his/her destination with a timehomogeneous probability \u03c9 = 0.001 during his/her infectiousness period.

The marginal impact was measured separately by the change in the total pandemic cost and the number of mortalities (averaged over multiple replicates), resulting from a unit change in the total budget availability or a factor value, one at a time. Factors under consideration included: (a) antiviral efficacy, (b) vaccine efficacy, (c) social distancing conformance, (d) social distancing declaration threshold, and (e) social distancing period. We also investigated the affect of varying the social distancing conformance on the dynamics of the societal and economic costs. Figure 8a and b shows the dynamics of the pandemic impact, measured as the average number of fatalities and total cost, for different levels of the total budget availability relative to the total budget requirement (see Appendix Table 13 ). As expected, the curves for the average number of deaths and total cost exhibit a downward trend, for both transmissibility scenarios, as the total budget availability increases. An increased budget translates into higher availabilities of mitigation resources, which will mediate regional pandemic impact and reduce the probability of spread to unaffected regions. As also expected, a higher virus transmissibility generates more infections which, in turn, result into more fatalities and, subsequently, bigger societal and economic costs. As the budget availability approaches the budget requirement (starting from approximately 60%), both impact curves show a converging behavior, for both scenarios, whereby the marginal impact of additional resource availability decreases. This can be explained by noting that the total budget requirement was calculated assuming the worst case scenario where all regions are affected and provided with adequate resources to cover their respective populations at risk. Figure 9a and b shows the behavior of the two impact measures for the level of the antiviral efficacy (\u03c4 in Eq. 3) between 10 and 20, and a fixed level of the total budget availability (50% of the total requirement).",

Figure 12a and b shows the dynamics of the total cost broken into the societal and economic components. The societal cost for the two scenarios generally decreases with quarantine conformance as a consequence of generating fewer infections and deaths (and hence, smaller lost productivity) during the quarantine period. For higher transmissibility, the marginal impact of the conformance level is more pronounced due to the effect of amplifying reduction in contact intensity explained above. A similar behavior can be observed for the economic cost which incorporates the cost of medical expenses of the recovered/deceased (over the entire pandemic period) and the cost of lost productivity of the quarantined individuals (during the social distancing period).

Figure 14a and b shows the dynamics of the average number of fatalities and total cost for values of the social distancing period between 10 and 14 days (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 2007b). Similar to the analysis for the social distancing conformance level (see Sect. 4.2.4), for both transmissibility scenarios, the two curves exhibit a decreasing trend: once the CFR reaches a significant value of 1.0%, social distancing becomes the most efficient containment measure.

It was observed that while the total budget requirement was arrived at assuming that all regions would be affected, the dynamic predictive allocation strategy decreased the probability of spread from the ongoing regions, thus resulting in reduced need for resources. Our analysis also showed that compared to the high transmissibility scenario, marginal impact of the vaccine efficacy for the low transmissibility scenario was less significant due to a relatively smaller infected population. We observed that the overall pandemic cost was significantly affected by the social distancing conformance, particularly for higher transmissibility scenario. A higher degree of social distancing conformance led to a reduction in the contact intensity within the affected region. This further reduced the probabilities of spread to unaffected regions. We also observed that delayed declaration of social distancing led to a growth in the number of infected and dead. Moreover, for both transmissibility scenarios, longer social distancing period (from 10 to 14 days) significantly reduced the pandemic cost by decreasing both the contact intensity and the size of the post-quarantine infectious population.",

Else, do Step 9. 7. (a) For each ongoing region, implement a next day run of its single-region simulation.(b) Check the containment status of each ongoing region. Update sets A n and B n , if needed. (c) For each unaffected region, calculate its outbreak probability. (d) Based on the outbreak probability values, determine if there is a new outbreak region(s) j. If there is no new outbreak(s), go to Step 6. Otherwise, go to Step 8. 8. For each new outbreak region j, (a) Increment n \u2190 n + 1. (b) Update sets B n \u2190 B n \u222a { j} and C n \u2190 C n \\{ j}. (c) Re-estimate regression equations for each region k \u2208 B n \u222aC n using the singleregion simulations, where each simulation is initialized to the current outbreak status in the region. (d) Determine the remaining availability of the previously allocated resources. (e) Solve the resource allocation model for each region k \u2208 B n .",
