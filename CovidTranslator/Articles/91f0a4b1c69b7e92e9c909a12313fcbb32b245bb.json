These findings suggest that this IFNa-induction mechanism does not require viral replication in IFNa-producing leukocytes, but rather, may be the consequence of membrane interactions between IFNa producer cells and viral proteins present at the surface of virus particles or virus-infected cells. Indeed, several reports indicate that glycosylated viral proteins may be the essential triggers for IFNa induction (Ito et al., 1978; Lebon, 1985; Charley et al., 1991; Laude et al., 1992; Capobianchi et al., 1992) .

Identification of the cells responsible for producing IFNa was recently carried out using several technical approaches: cells containing mRNA for IFNa were identified by RNA-RNA in situ hybridization (Gob1 et al., 1988) , whereas immunocytochemistry with monoclonal or polyclonal anti-IFNa antibodies detected cells containing cytoplasmic IFNa (Sandberg et al., 1989; Feldman and Fitzgerald-Bocarsly, 1990) . A filter immunoplaque assay (ELISPOT) was also used to visualize IFNa-secreting cells (Cederblad and Alm, 1990) . Assuming that most IPC were detected by such techniques, and that the different IFN subtypes present in the supernatants of induced leukocytes were produced by the same cells, it was suggested that the yield of IFN per IPC could be estimated from the amount of IFN in supernatants and the IPC number per culture. Thus, herpes simplex virus(HSV)-induced human IPC were found to secrete between 0.5 and 2 units of IFNa per cell (Cederblad and Alm, 1990) . In order to analyse in more detail the nature of human IPC, several approaches were used to select these cells, including separation on density gradients, sequential cell depletion or flow CMV = cytomegalovirus. CSF = colony-stimulating factor. cytometry cell sorting with anti-leukocyte monoclonal antibodies (mAb) (Fitzgerald-Bocarsly et al., 1988; Sandberg et al., 1990) . IPC which responded to HSV-or to cytomegalovirus (CMV)-infected cells were recovered in the low density fraction of metrizamide gradients, but were found to be functionally distinct from dendritic cells (Chehimi et al., 1989) .",

In the present report, we have enriched TGEV-induced IPC by using cell depletion or cell-sorting procedures with specific mAb or by cell fractionation on discontinuous density gradients. The IPC were monitored by ELISPOT assay for secreted IFNa, and by IFN bioassay in culture supernatants. From these data, the IFN yield per IPC was estimated in the different cell fractions obtained and was found to vary with the degree of IPC enrichment. MATERIALS AND METHODS PBMC Porcine PBMC were obtained from heparinized blood by Ficoll density centrifugation on \"MSL\" (density 1.077, Eurobio, Paris). PBMC were suspended in RPMI-1640 medium supplemented with 10 % foetal calf serum (FCS) and antibiotics. Porcine PBMC were then used directly in IFN induction or were depleted of plastic-adherent cells as follows : PBMC were resuspended in RPMI-1640 medium supplemented with 20 % FCS at a concentration of 2-5 x lo6 cells/ml and incubated for 90 min at 37\u00b0C in tissue culture flasks. \"Plastic-non-adherent cells\" were then collected by shaking the flasks. experiments, phagocytic cells were depleted by car-bony1 iron ingestion before Ficoll density centrifugation (Charley and Lavenant, 1990 ).",

The frequency of IPC was even increased following complement-mediated depletion of CD8+ cells (table II) . These data indicated, therefore, that when non-adherent cells were treated with mAb before virus induction, IFNa-secreting cells could be characterized as non-T, non-B, CD8-but CD4+ cells, partly confirming previous observations of the effects of complement-mediated cell depletion on IFN production (Charley and Lavenant, 1990 ). However, a surprising result in the present experiments was that IPC monitored by ELISPOT were mostly SLA-class-IInegative, in contrast with our previous results on IFN production by mAb-treated leukocytes (Charley and Lavenant, 1990) . Such a discrepancy might be explained by the results of the following experiments in which immunomagnetic beads/cell separations were performed either before or after virus induction : table IV shows that a much higher proportion of porcine IPC was recovered in the positively selected cell fraction when anti-CD6 or -SLA-class-II-coated beads were used after virus induction instead of before virus induction. An alternative approach to selecting IPC was to fractionate PBMC on discontinuous density gradients using Percoll or metrizamide. When plastic non-adherent cells were fractionated onto Percoll gradients, cells from the low-density fraction (45 % Percoll) corresponding to less than 15 070 non-adherent cells were lo-to 17-fold enriched for IFNa-secreting cells (table V) . IPC were much more highly enriched on metrizamide gradients : in the low-density fraction of 14.2 % metrizamide, in which 0.5-1.5 % of nonadherent cells were recovered, the IPC frequency was 20-to 130-fold increased as compared with unfractionated PBMC (range of results obtained in 11 experiments, table VI). To characterize the enriched IPC population obtained on 14.2 070 metrizamide gradients, indirect immunofluorescence tests were performed with anti-porcine leukocyte mAb. Table VII shows that low-density cell fractions were mainly enriched for TH22A5+ or MSA3 + (SLA-class-II+) cells and for 74-22-15 + cells (granulocytes/macrophages). To try to enrich IPC further, lowdensity cells isolated on 14.2 % metrizamide were also treated with different mAb: only a slight (less than 2-fold) increase in IPC frequency could be obtained when low-density cells were depleted of CD8+ cells (data not shown).",

This result is in agreement with other studies performed on HSV-induced human leukocytes. By several technical approaches, including limiting dilution analysis, RNA-RNA in situ hybridization, immunocytochemistry and ELISPOT assay, the frequency of human IPC in blood mononuclear cells is less than 1 per lo3 (Gob1 et Feldman and Fitzgerald-Bocarsly, 1990; Cederblad and Alm, 1990) . IPC, which circulate throughout the body and are induced to secrete IFNa following brief exposure to non-infectious viral structures (reviewed in Charley and Laude, 1992) are likely to contribute markedly to the early production of IFNu occurring in viral infections and thus deserve much attention. However, their very low frequency has greatly hampered their study. In the present report, we have analysed the effects of various cell fractionation procedures to enrich for coronavirus-induced porcine IPC. Depletion of plastic-adherent and phagocytic cells resulted in a 3-fold IPC increase (table I) , which indicates that, in contrast to the results of Gob1 et al. (1988) demonstrating that monocytes are potent producers of IFNcr in response to Sendai virus, TGEV-induced IFNu-secreting cells are non-adherent and non-phagocytic cells.",

Cell fractionations with mAb resulted in only a slight IPC enrichment : at the most, IPC were 4-fold-enriched by positive selection with anti-CD4 mAb-coated beads (exp. no 2 in table IV). In contrast, cell fractionations on discontinuous density gradients allowed a much higher enrichment of IPC : in the low-density fractions from Percoll gradients and from metrizamide gradients (tables V and VI), IPC were lo-30-fold enriched. The 14.2 % metrizamide fraction, which contained less than 1.5 % non-adherent cells, in some experiments contained IPC at a frequency up to 120 times higher than the starting cell population. This low-density cell population was mainly enriched in SLA-class-II+ cells, in T cells and in cells reacting with a mAb specific for granulocytes and macrophages (table VII). In the human species, HSV-or CMV-induced IPC fractionated in a low-density cell population, enriched in HLA-DR+ cells, but which appeared to be functionally distinct from dendritic cells (Feldman and Fitzgerald-Bocarsly, 1990 ; Chehimi et al., 1989) .",

In fact, we could not detect IFNy in the supernatants of TGEV-induced low-density cells (data not shown). Also, preliminary colonystimulating factor (CSF) assays performed on porcine bone marrow semi-solid cultures indicated that there was no higher CSF activity in the supernatants of low-density cells (F. Hervatin, personal communication). It remains possible, therefore, that the increased IFN yield per IPC observed is a consequence of an enhancing, so called \"priming\", effect of IFNa upon its own production (Stewart ef al., 1971) .
