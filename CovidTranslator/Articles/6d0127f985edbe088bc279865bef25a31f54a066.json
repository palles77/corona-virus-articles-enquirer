To reveal the evolution mechanism of SARS-CoV-2 genome, we performed comprehensive genomic analysis with newly sequenced SARS-CoV-2 strains and 20 closely related coronavirus strains. Among 98 nucleotide mutations at 93 sites of the genome among different SARS-CoV-2 strains, 58 of them caused amino acid change, indicating a result of neutral evolution. However, the ratio of nucleotide substitutions to amino acid substitutions of spike gene (9.07) between SARS-CoV-2 WIV04 and Bat-SARSr-CoV RaTG13 was extensively higher than those from comparisons between other coronaviruses (range 1.29 -4.81). The elevated synonymous mutations between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13, suggesting they underwent stronger purifying selection. Moreover, their nucleotide substitutions are enriched with T:C transition, which is consistent with the mutation signature caused by deactivity of RNA 3'-to-5' exoribonuclease (ExoN). The codon usage was similar between SARS-CoV-2 and other strains in beta-coronavirus lineage B, suggesting it had small impact on the mutation pattern. In comparison of SARS-CoV-2 WIV04 with Bat-SARSr-CoV RaTG13, the ratios of non-synonymous to synonymous substitution rates (dN/dS) was the lowest among all performed comparisons, reconfirming the evolution of SARS-CoV-2 under stringent selective pressure. Moreover, some sites of spike protein might be subjected to positive selection. Therefore, our results will help understanding the evolutionary mechanisms contribute to viral pathogenicity and its adaptation with hosts.",

Then, we further compared the proportion of synonymous mutations in spike gene between WIV04 and RaTG13 or Bat-SL-CoVZC45. The ratio of nucleotide substitutions (263 NT) to amino acid substitutions (29 AA) was 9.07 from WIV04 to RaTG13, which was significantly higher than the ratio (3.91, 864/221) from WIV04 to Bat-SL-CoVZC45 (p < 0.05) (Fig. 2) . Moreover, we also observed that the synonymous mutations increased in whole genome level between WIV04 and RaTG13 than that between WIV04 and Bat-SL-CoVZC45.",

It's reported that the CoVs lacking a 3'-to-5' exoribonuclease (ExoN) accumulated 15 to 20 fold more A:G and U:C transition (14) . What's more, the RNA mutagen 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) treatment will also increase the U:C and A:G transitions. Consequently, this increased T:C mutation implies the ExoN of SARS-CoV-2 may be deactivated compared with that of RaTG13.

From December 2019 to February 2020, the genome sequences of 108 strains of SARS-CoV-2 virus have been submitted to GISAID database worldwide. Compared with the standard SARS-CoV-2 strain WIV04, total 98 point mutations were detected at 93 nucleotide sites of all SARS-CoV-2 strains with genome sequence available on Feb. 25 2020 (Fig. 1A) . However, only 58 of these nucleotide mutations caused changes in amino acids. Among them, 15 nucleotide substitutions at 14 sites caused changes in 7 amino acids of the spike protein were observed. Consequently, the proportion of synonymous mutations (~40%) among all current reported SARS-CoV-2 strains is similar to that between WIV04 and Bat-SL-CoVZC45 (39.1%), but is dramatically less than that between WIV04 and RaTG13 (90.7%).",

The codon usage difference of spike gene between human coronavirus HKU1 and bovine bCoV-ENT sequence have the largest difference, with a ratio of 41.41. Codon usage bias in a gene can be effectively measured by determining the effective number of codons (ENc). Generally, the RNA viruses usually consist of high ENc values which help it in replication and host adaption with preferred codons. The lower ENc values represent high codon bias with low numbers of synonymous codons used for the amino acids, and a gene with strong codon usage bias may have an ENc value less than 35. The ENc values of WIV04 spike gene was 44.38 (Fig. 2), which is similar with those of RaTG13 and other bat coronavirus in Beta-CoVs lineage (B), indicating the high synonymous mutation was not determined by codon usage bias.",
