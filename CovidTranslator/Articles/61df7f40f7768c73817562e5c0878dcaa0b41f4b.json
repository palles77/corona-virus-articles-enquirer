There is usually a seasonal pattern which is country dependent; in addition for the same month (say October) in different years there are annual fluctuations of about the same magnitude. It is customary to say that these are random fluctuations but are they really random? In this respect one can observe that by saying that a phenomenon is random one gives up ipso facto all attempts to understand it. It is probably for this kind of reason that Albert Einstein supported the ''hidden variable'' interpretation of quantum physics. In 1935, i.e. some 10 years after quantum mechanics was introduced, Einstein et al. [8] suggested that the wave function description of quantum objects was incomplete in the sense that it did not include some hidden parameters.",

While writing his paper Bertillon did not know that some 28 years later there would be a massive influenza pandemic through which his discovery could be tested. We will show below that it was indeed confirmed in all countries where the pandemic has had an impact. Apparently, there has been no further studies of this phenomenon ever since. Actually, even in Bertillon's paper the effect is discussed fairly briefly. In particular its mechanism remains to be uncovered. This is the purpose of the present paper.",

This raises the following question. In most countries the death rate presents a winter peak in January Fig. 1a shows that the population changes based on the summation of monthly births and deaths approximates correctly the observed annual population changes. The curve of birth numbers based on a constant birth rate is naturally parallel to the population curve; it is displayed in the inset graph of Fig. 1b ; the variation interval of births numbers (as shown on the vertical axis of the inset) is (9.20, 9.45 ). These variations are much smaller than the actual fluctuations of birth numbers; as a result the broken line of predicted birth numbers looks almost completely flat when displayed on the same graph as the actual births fluctuations. Source: Bunle [11]. or February. According to the Bertillon coupling one would expect a trough of births 9 months later that is to say in October or November. Is this indeed the case? If not, in what respect do exceptional death surges differ from regular winter surges? This point will be discussed in the second one of the two papers devoted to this question. 3 In an attempt to get a clearer idea of the mechanism of the coupling effect the present paper will address the following questions.",

The proposition has a fairly clear intuitive interpretation. To make things simple let us assume that the death-excess variable e takes place in one month, as is for instance the case for earthquakes. In a virtual world where everybody conceives once every month, for each missing person there would be a missing baby 9 months later. Under this assumption the birth trough would be of same magnitude as the death spike. However we know that actually the probability to conceive in a given month is \u03bb/12 = 0.0017 where \u03bb is the annual birth rate. In other words in 10,000 persons only 17 may conceive in the relevant month. Thus, this direct effect contributes very little to the birth trough.",

It is by comparing different case studies that we came to the conclusion that social factors play a key-role. How? As famine and influenza have biological effects, at first sight the resulting birth reduction might also be attributed to such effects. On the contrary, birth reductions after earthquakes can hardly by accounted for by biological factors. For that reason the case of the Tokyo earthquake of 1923 played a key role in our understanding. It convinced us that the suffering of the many people who are affected but do not die was of central importance. In examining successive case-studies it will also be seen that the magnitude of the birth reduction is compatible with the existence of a group of people that we call collateral sufferers. This term refers to persons who are affected by the event under consideration (whether epidemic, disease or anything else) but do not die. In order to generate the observed birth dips the size of this group must be several times larger than the number of fatalities. This is illustrated in Fig. 2b . In Sweden although there were only 43,000 excess deaths in 1918, it is estimated that about one third of the population, that is to say almost 2 millions (50 times more than those who died), was affected by the disease. Naturally, this fraction is difficult to define precisely because there is a continuum between the persons who were not affected at all and those who experienced very mild forms of the disease.",

Just as an element of comparison, it can be mentioned that this rate was 2.8 times higher than the rate of 28 per thousand reached during the famine of 1961 in China. In the breakdown of the deaths according to their causes only 2350 famine deaths were recorded whereas 27,215 deaths were attributed to tuberculosis, dysentery, smallpox and whooping cough.

For stock owners, put options provide a protection against the fall of a stock price because it gives them the right to sell their stock at a predetermined price which may be much higher than the current price. Moreover, because the price of a put option increases when the price of the stock declines, speculators can make a profit by selling their put options.

However, in contrast with 9/11, all persons (at least those who do not have air conditioning) are directly affected to some degree.",

The data are taken from [11, p. 313, 438] and [12, p. 73 ]. In early 1918 the Swedish population numbered 5.8 millions; on average its annual birth and death rates were 2.0% and 1.3% respectively. In other words, the birth number reduction cannot simply be a ''mechanical'' consequence of the death spike. It can only be explained by a drastic reduction in the birth rate. Average time interval between intercourse conducive to conception and birth. The familiar estimate of 9 (mean) months corresponds to an interval of 274 days, that is to say one week longer than the (more accurate) estimate given in the figure. The standard 280 day figure refers to the time interval between the last menstrual period and birth; it overestimates the time between sexual intercourse and birth by two weeks. The 9 day dispersion of ovulation refers to its standard deviation. Source: Wilcox et al. [23, 24] , Bhat and Kushtagi [25] . each duration, which gives an average of D = 267. The distribution of the fertility window is approximately Gaussian 10 with a standard deviation of 9 days. In summary: D = 267 \u00b1 \u03c3 , \u03c3 = 9 days. This estimate is confirmed by the following result based on a sample of 125 pregnancies in which ''the median time from ovulation to birth was 268 days'' [26] .",

Thus, nine months later the birth rate of this group of persons would also be zero. With respect to a normal year this would result in a reduction of 400,000 \u00d7 0.8/1000 = 3200 births.

One may say that during the time of the epidemic people postponed planned marriages. As in Sweden in any normal month there were about 4000 marriages a drastic reduction could in principle account nine months later for a fall in births of the same magnitude, that is to say of the size actually observed. However, it appears that in most countries there was only a slight reduction in the number of marriages or even none at all. Thus, in Sweden in October 1918, at the height of the influenza epidemic, there were 4323 marriages compared to an average of 4255 in the same month of October 1915 October , 1916 October , 1917 Even when there is a fall in marriages it has not necessarily an impact on the number of births 9 months later. An illustration is provided by New York City in September 2001. As a result of the World Trade Center attack the number of marriages fell from 6753 in August 2001 to 2616 in September. However the correlation between the time series of monthly percentage variations of marriages and conceptions over the 60 months from 1999 to 2003 is as low as 0.025 (which, for a confidence level of 0.95, is not a significant correlation). The corresponding linear regression reads: \u2206b/b = 0.003(\u2206m/m) + 0.11 which shows that the observed fall of 61% of marriages will translate in a fall of less than 1% for the births.In short, in some cases where there is both a substantial reduction in the number of marriages (which is rare) and a significant marriage-birth correlation, this factor may contribute but it cannot be the root factor that we are looking for.",

For the present study we rather need the time D between the sexual intercourse which led to the conception and birth. The conception results from the encounter between a spermatozoon and an ovum (also called ovule or egg cell). Ovulation means that the egg is released from the ovary into the Fallopian tube; it remains there in good shape for only one day which means that conception and ovulation must take place almost on the same day. In contrast the spermatozoa can stay alive in the Fallopian tube for 3 days with similar conception probabilities during those 3 days. 9 Once fertilized, the egg starts its journey down the Fallopian tube and into the uterus where it will get implanted (see Fig. C.1) .The key-question then is: when does ovulation occur? It is often said that it occurs at day 14 in the menstrual cycle. In fact, this depends upon the length of the menstrual cycle [24] . When the length of the cycle is 28 days, ovulation occurs on average at day 12. When the cycle lasts more than 30 days, the ovulation takes place on day 14. The global average for all cycles is 14 days. Coupled with the standard estimate of 280 days starting from the beginning of the cycle one gets: 280 \u2212 14 = 266 days following ovulation. With respect to intercourse one gets time intervals of D = 266,267,268 days with same probability for 9 Actually they can remain alive for about 6 days but the probability of conception during these three extra days is only one third of the conception probability during the first 3 days [23] .",
