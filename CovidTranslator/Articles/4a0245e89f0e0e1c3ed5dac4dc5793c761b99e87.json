In the present study, a new C-geranylated flavone, paucatalinone C (1) and five known C-geranylated flavanones (2\u22126) were isolated. In addition, a total of 34 C-geranylated flavonoids were detected by HPLC-DAD-ESI-MS/MS coupling techniques from the CH 2 Cl 2 extract of P. catalpifolia. Futhermore, anti-aging effects of isolated compounds were evaluated in vitro with premature senescent 2BS cells induced by H 2 O 2 . Phytochemical results indicated that P. catalpifolia was a natural resource of abundant C-geranylated flavonoids. Diplacone (3) and paucatalinone A (5) were the potent anti-aging agents in the premature senescent 2BS cells induced by H 2 O 2 and the C-geranyl substituent may be an important factor because of its lipophilic character.

Previous phytochemical studies on Paulownia plants have led to the isolation of quinones [2] , lignans [3] , phenylpropanoid glycosides [4] , and C-geranylated flavonoids [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] . Up to date, more than 40 C-geranylated flavanones have been isolated from Paulownia plants, especially from P. tomentosa [10] . Some C-geranylated flavanones display cytotoxic [7, 11] , antioxidant [5, 11] , antiviral [12] , antibacterial [6, 9] , anti-inflammatory [13] , and anti-cholinesterase activities [14] . Therefore, C-geranylated flavanones have drawn great attentions because of their various prominent pharmacological effects.",

In the present study, another new C-geranylated flavone, paucatalinone C (1), along with other five known C-geranyl flavanones were isolated from the fruits. In addition, using HPLC-DAD-ESI-MS/MS coupling techniques, more than 34 C-geranylated flavonoids were detected. Furthermore, the cellular anti-aging effects of all isolated C-geranylated flavonoids on the premature senescent human embryonic lung diploid fibroblasts cells (2BS cells) induced by H 2 O 2 were investigated. Our phytochemical results indicated that P. catalpifolia was also a natural resource of abundant C-geranylated flavonoids and paucatalinone C (1) was the first isolation from the genus Paulownia as a C-geranylated flavone. Biological activity assays demonstrated diplacone (3) and paucatalinone A (5) were the potent anti-aging agents and the C-geranyl substituent may be an important factor for the cellular bioactive effects because of its lipophilic character.",

The second subfraction (3.6 g) with little green pigmentum was performed a HPLC-DAD-ESI-MS/MS assay firstly, then was chromatographed on an ODS column, eluting with aqueous MeOH from 40% to 100% in gradient to yield six subfractions (Sub. F 1-6). Each subfractions was then executed an analysis by HPLC-DAD-ESI-MS/MS for the presence of C-geranylated flavonoids. Sub. F 4 (820 mg) gave a distinct signal with typical features of C-geranylated flavone (1) and was purified again by prep-HPLC with 82% aqueous MeOH as mobile phase to yield the new compound (8.6 mg, t R = 32 min). Sub. F 3 was chromatographed on ODS eluting with 65% aqueous MeOH and purified by Sephadex LH-20 with MeOH to give compound 2 (10.3 mg). Compound 3 (20.0 mg) was isolated from sub.F 5 by ODS chromatography with 75% aqueous MeOH as elution. Compounds 4-6 were obtained in our previous study [15] and were detected by HPLC-DAD-ESI-MS/MS in the present study.",

Generally, Flavones or flavonols showed two main maximum UV absorptions at about \u03bb 220\u2212280 and 300\u2212400 nm, respectively; however, flavanones or flavanonols showed a main maximum absorption at about \u03bb 290 nm with a shoulder peak at about \u03bb 230 nm and a weak absorption at about \u03bb 340 nm. Besides, the key ESI-MS/MS characteristic of geranylated flavonoids was a neutral loss of a C 9 unit from the C 10 side chain and the appearance of the flavonoid skeleton fragment with a methylene ion [19] [20] . These neutral C 9 units and methylene flavonoid skeletons can The neutral loss \u0394m/z 124 was easily considered as the C 9 unit U1 fragmented from the side chain (Fig.  5b) .

Our previous phytochemical investigation made it clear that structures of geranylated flavonoids in P. catalpifolia Gong Tong were different from to those in other plants of the same genus. The difference was mainly due to the isolation of the C-8 substituted geranyl flavanones [15] along with the detection and isolation of C-geranylated flavones/ flavonols in this experiment. Unfortunately, accurate structures for each detected HPLC signal could not be demonstrated definitely only by UV and MS experiments because of the above uncertainties. Results of this analytical assay only gave us information that abundant geranylated flavonoids were found in fruits of P. catalpifolia Gong Tong with their structural type (flavanones or flavones), even potential structures. If intensive phytochemical isolations were carried out for this kind of compounds, especially for those microconstituents, many new C-geranylated flavonoids with slight structural changes could be obtained and elucidated.",

If the geranyl moiety modified by hydroxylation at C-7\" (2, 4, 6) , the bioactivities could be significantly decreased, which was particularly verified by the cellular radical-scavenging assay. This is probably due to the lipophilic character of the geranyl group. It can increase the alteration of membrane fluidity for tested compounds and keep 2BS cell from cell membrane and nuclear damage when the cells are exposed to an oxidative or genotoxic stress. ",

Among them, many detected compounds possessed the same quasi-molecular ion peak ([M + H] + ), such as signals 7, 9, 17, 20, 26, 31 with m/z 441 and 2, 8, 10, 14, 19, 21, 32 with m/z 455. This might be caused by those structural diversifications of different location for C 10 side-chain, different modification for geranyl substituent, different absolute configuration for C-2/C-3 or different location for methoxy group as demonstrated above. Furthermore, the isolation of paucatalinone C (1) along with the detection of other two C-geranylated flavones or flavonols (22 and 24) was the first time for phytochemical investigations on genus Paulownia. In addition, three C-pentenyl flavonoids (18, 22\u221223) Fig. 5 Identification of C-geranylated flavonoids in P. catalpifolia Gong Tong by HPLC-DAD-ESI-MS/MS analyses",
