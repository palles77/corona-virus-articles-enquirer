At home, China has experienced unprecedented material improve ments, doubling its gross domestic product per capita, for example, between 2002 and 2006. What are the major challenges for the health of the Chinese people? What are the implications for global health? The authors of the papers in this special issue of The Lancet on China's health system were invited to address these questions as China's global engagement continues to expand in the opening decade of the 21st century. 1- 18 The reasons for commissioning this report are compelling. Despite accounting for over a fi fth of the world's population, the importance of China to global health has been under-recognised by the international health community. This perception is changing rapidly, especially after the August, 2008, Olympics. There are at least four reasons, contemporary and historical, for China's growing role in global health.",

For example, artemesinin, the most eff ective drug against the malaria parasite, comes from traditional Chinese medicine. 10 China's universities and modern research laboratories are increasingly attracting outsourced research and development investments. 8 Community health workers that were pioneered in the 1930s and subsequently refashioned as barefoot village doctors are an acknowledged Chinese innovation for primary health care. 15 China, like many other countries, is struggling to manage the public-private mix in health care; its new eff orts to address various market failures are likely to contribute signifi cantly to global understanding of what does and does not work. 1, 5, 6 Third, China is a major contributor in the control and spread of global health risks, an inevitable aspect of China's growing international participation in the trade of goods, services, and people. In other words, what happens in China is important for the health of others around the world. Emergence of new infectious diseases, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome, and persistence of old pathogens (eg, tuberculosis) illustrate why China's health situation has global importance. 2 The spread of transnational health risks is an inevitable aspect of China's participation in global transactions, as recently illustrated by controversy surrounding pet foods, cough syrup, and toothpaste. Moreover, as China's energy consumption grows, industrial pollution and carbon production will assume growing global health importance.",

Although China's health sector is overwhelmingly internally focused, its global reach is expanding, as shown by its assistance to sub-Saharan Africa, to where China has dispatched more than 40 health teams. China's success in securing the election of the fi rst Chinese head of a UN agency, WHO, marked a turning point of China's participation in global health governance. To probe the scope and depth of China in the context of global health, a collaboration between Chinese and international health scientists-convened by the Peking University Health Sciences Centre, The Lancet, and the China Medical Board-commissioned this report, including 19 papers: seven theme papers and 12 commentaries. 1-18 Written by 65 authors, of whom two-thirds are Chinese, the report brings together diverse scientifi c evidence about China's major health problems, its current strategies, and China's health future.",

            "text": "An important signal of China's stronger political commitment to health is shown by the expanding role of the state in health-care provision and stewardship, together with the mobilisation of communities and civil society for health improvement. The results of these changes are already measurable. China is now on track to reach Millennium Development Goal (MDG) 4, reducing child mortality by two-thirds between 1990 and 2015. 19 This achievement has been made through antipoverty policies, land reform, investments in agriculture, and economic growth, as well as through improved health services. China has also made important progress on MDG 5, the reduction of maternal mortality. 19 Health care in China, however, is distinctive in several ways. First, the scale is vast. Whatever the problem or solution, China's health conditions are gigantic in size-with more than 300 million smokers, 177 million people with hypertension, and an estimated 140 million urban migrants, stretching demand for new forms of health care. 3, 18 Second, the speed of health change in China has been extremely rapid. Health transitions that took nearly a century in other richer countries have taken place in a few decades in China. 3, 4 Third, China's unique national history and ecology have resulted in great diversity in health conditions and responses. Many aspects of health in China will demonstrate both commonality and exceptionalism within the country and among nation states. An example is medical ethics and human rights, in which China has been moving towards universal norms while at the same time contributing a unique tradition of Chinese philosophy and values. 16 And fourth, China increasingly has the economic capacity to make profound advances in health. China's spectacular economic growth enables it to augment its investments in health substantially.",
