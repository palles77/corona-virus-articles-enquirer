In addition, they shed coronavirus-like particles (CVLPs) in their feces which are morphologically distinct from \"typical\" coronaviruses. 0ronasal, intraperitoneal, intraduodenal, and intravenous inoculations of CVLPs were uniformly unsuccessful in the seroconversion of eats to CV, whereas subsequent prolonged close contact with colony eats did result in seroconversion. Such evidence indicates that MD eats in this barrier colony are infected with at least two non-crossreactive agents: (1) feline enteric CVLPs, which are shed in feces and are morphologically and antigenicMly distinct from established coronaviruses (CVs), and (2) a virus which is antigenically cross-reactive with CVs, but which is apparently shed by some route other than the lower gastrointestinal tract.",

FIPV-like particles have been identified in the gastrointestinal tracts of some cats with feline infectious peritonitis (FIP) (6, 7) and enteritis (5, 14) , and in feces of apparently healthy cats (N. C. PED~RS~:~', personal communication). An enteric virus morphologically and antigenically similar to FIPV has been reported from cats reared in a conventional feline breeding colony maintained by Animal Resources Services, University of California, Davis (14) , and is referred to here as FECV (UCD). This virus was initially detected in feces of healthy cats but was shown to be capable of producing mild pyrexia, leukopenia, and enteritis when fed experimentally to young kittens (14) . Coronavirus-like particles morphologically distinct from FIPV have been detected in feces of clinically normal cats (10, 11) and in feces of some cats with enteric disease (10) . These latter particles were first visualized by electron microscopy (EM) in feces of MD cats raised in a barrier feline breeding colony maintained by the Division of Laboratory Animals Services, New York State College of Veterinary Medicine, Cornell University (11). Feline enteric CVLPs have since been detected by EM in 20 of 185 (10.8 percent) fecal samples from privately-owned cats hospitalized at t.he small animal clinic of the Veterinary Medical Teaching Hospital at Cornell (t0). While morphologic and antigenic similarities exist between FIPV and FECV (UCD), the morphologically dissimilar CVLPs appear to be antigenicMly dissimilar as well (I 1).",

The peplomer fringe surrounding the CVLP was composed of regularly spaced teardrop-like knobs anchored to the particle by thin stalks. The total length of projections (25 nm) was uniform. The classical CV peplomers, however, were larger, more diffuse, and petal-shaped. The FECV (UCD) and TGEV peplomers were also not as regularly spaced and less uniform in length, ranging from 15--30 nm.",

Particles are moderately to markedly pleomorphie, ranging in diameter from 60 to over 1000 nm, and possess regularly spaced radiating surface projections reminiscent of coronaviral peplomers. However, closer examination reveMs that CVLP projections consist of a knoblike structure anchored to the particle by a slender stalk, and thus are distinguishable from the larger, more massive petal-shaped peptomers of \"typieM\" eoronaviruses (4, 13) . Feline enteric CVLPs appear to be morphologically distinct from established eoronaviruses and also from a proposed feline enteric coronavirus, FECV (UCD), recently reported from California (14) . To date CVLPs have not been positively identified as the cause of disease in any species (13) . Further immunologic and physieochemical studies are required before it can be determined whether CVLPs are true members of the Coronaviridae or represent a new and distinct group of viral agents.",

For instance, CVLPs may have been inactivated or antigenically altered during processing of inocula. Viral peplomers, presumed mediators of attachment to target cells, may have been damaged or Iost, producing loarticles incapable of infection. EM examination of CVLPs, however, has demonstrated that peplomer integrity is virtuMty unaffected by the storage, filtration, ultracentrifugation, and routine El~{ processing teclmiques used in this experiment (C. A. STODDA~T, unpublished data). This is in contrast to some reports of established CVs in which such methods can result in damaged virions, with extrusion of internal components and/or partial or complete denudation of the peplomer fringe (9; C. A. STOD~)ART, unpublished data). The possibility also exists that subtle antigenic alteration of CVLP peptomers may not have been accompanied by detectable morphologic changes. The action of proteolyric enzymes in the gastrointestinal tract on the antigenic and morphologie stability of virus particles must also be considered (t6).",

At this time it is unclear whether a similar one-way serologic crossreaction might occur between TGEV and CVLPs and it is possible that while antibody to CVLPs may not detect TGEV in the KELA, anti-TGEV antibody may react with CVLPs in a reciprocal test.",

Alternatively, CVLP infection may have stimulated only IgA and/or IgM production, but this possibility is less likely due to the combined heavy chMn/light chain specificity of the conjugate used in the KELA. The antibody response induced by CVLP infection may have been so transient as to have been missed by the sampling intervals used. However, i.v. administration of CVLPs would presumably have induced a substantial systemic antibody response even if the virus were no longer infectious. Lastly, the cats used in these experiments may not have been susceptible to CVLP infection Mthough persistence of CVLPs in feces of individual cats argues against a simple passive transit through the gastrointestinal tract. Thus we conclude that CVLPs do indeed infect cats, but the nature of the target cell(s) and the specificity of any-resulting antibody response remain undetermined.",
