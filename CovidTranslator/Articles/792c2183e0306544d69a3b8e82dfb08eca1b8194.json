            "text": "Monoclonal antibody therapy has been a game changer for cancer therapy, including treatments for lymphoma or human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 + (HER2 + ) breast cancer (1, 2) . However, this approach has limitations, including slow development timelines, limited modification options, and short half-life for the molecules, requiring frequent repeat administrations. These limitations contribute to the high cost of development and deployment of these important tools and represents a challenge for the development of combination approaches. An important recent advance in the field of monoclonal technology is the bispecific T cell engager (BiTE), which combines the specificity of mAbs with the cytotoxic potential of T cells. BiTEs have shown promising results in leukemia clinical trials (3); however, this therapy has a limited applicability because it requires continuous intravenous infusion for weeks (4) and has manufacturing limitations. A longer-lived, simpler, reproducible production method for these antibody-based products would be important for cancer immunotherapy.",

HER2dMAb delayed tumor progression for HER2expressing ovarian and breast cancer models. We next used the HER2dMAb single-chain variable fragment portion to engineer a DNA-encoded BiTE (DBiTE). This HER2DBiTE was expressed in vivo for approximately 4 months after a single administration. The HER2DBiTE was highly cytolytic and delayed cancer progression in mice.

HER2dMAb-injected animals demonstrated a significant delay in tumor growth, resulting in improved survival ( Figure 3C ).

To validate the antitumor effect in an immunocompetent host, we generated tumors using the murine HER2 + breast cancer cell line Brk-pk110 (with the caveat of the spontaneous immunogenicity of HER2 in mice). We engineered this cell line to express similar HER2 levels to OVCAR3 ( Figure 3E ). We treated the mice with HER2dMAb or the empty vector 5 days after tumor challenge.

Accordingly, we fused the scFv of the HER2dMAb with the scFv of an optimized sequence encoding anti-CD3 (modified UCHT1) ( Figure 4A ). This HER2BiTE was efficiently expressed in vivo upon injection and CELLECTRA (Inovio) electroporation into the mouse tibialis anterior muscle ( Figure 4B ). The new HER2DBiTE retained binding to HER2 and bound to CD3 (Supplemental Figure 2, A and B) . Importantly, although the stimulation UCHT1 provides has been reported capable of killing T cells, we didn't observe an increased proportion of apoptosis or difference in T cell numbers when we cocultured OKT3 cells with HER2DBiTE as compared with just control in the presence of HER2 + cells (Supplemental Figure 2 , C and D). To determine the functionality of the HER2DBiTE expressed in vivo, we cultured sera from mice injected with HER2DBiTE or empty vector with HER2 + ovarian cancer cells and T cells. Sera from mice after HER2DBiTE treatment showed T cell activation (Supplemental Figure 2 , E-G) and an efficient dose-dependent cytotoxicity of OVCAR3 and CAOV3 cells. No cytotoxicity was found upon incubation with sera from empty vector-treated mice or was observed in the absence of T cells ( Figure  4C and Supplemental Figure 2H ). Incubation of T cells with OVCAR3 at a 1:5 ratio with 5% sera (5 \u03bcl in 100 \u03bcl) from treated mice showed that the DBiTEs exhibited potent activity for approximately 4 months ( Figure 4D ). As in HER2DBiTE, we observed generation of anti-HER2DBiTE antibodies, which could in part be responsible for the circulating levels over time (Supplemental Figure 2I ). To determine the DBiTE antitumor activity in vivo, we challenged NOD/SCID-\u03b3 (NSG) mice with OVCAR3. We treated mice with a single administration of 200 \u03bcg of HER2DBiTE or empty vector a day after tumor implantation. Two weeks after tumor inoculation, when tumors were approximately 50 mm 3 , we injected 10,000,000 PBMCs intraperitoneally into each mouse. HER2DBiTE treatment significantly affected tumor progression ( Figure 4E ), with tumor regression or tumor elimination observed in 8 out of 10 tumors while no tumor impact was observed in the control group ( Figure 4F) . No in vivo effect of HER2DBiTE was observed in the absence of PBMCs (Supplemental Figure 2J ).",

This higher stability simplifies storage and shipping because of the current strict cold chain requirement for antibodies. These requirements can increase therapeutic costs and can limit in vivo product half-life (14) . We show that intramuscular delivery of designed antibody-encoding DNA plasmids achieves stable plasma antibody concentrations for several months, limiting the requirement for multiple administrations, simplifying treatment strategies, as well as providing an improved expression profile. Despite high antitumor activity, BiTE therapy has advanced slowly because these new tools have limitations due to manufacturing problems and half-life of approximately 2.1 hours. Its short half-life imposes BiTE therapy to be administered as continuous intravenous infusion for 4-8 weeks per cycle (4) . Recent experiments with an intravenously delivered RNA expressing BiTE show in vivo activity for up to 6 days (15). HER2DBiTE, delivered by a simple injection lasting just milliseconds, was expressed in vivo for approximately 4 months, resulting in sustained, dramatic antitumor activity. Synthetic DNA delivery of BiTEs could alleviate the burden generated by the short half-life of BiTE therapy and provide an important new application for this tool in cancer immunotherapy.",

Addition of pertuzumab to standard chemotherapy and trastuzumab in HER2 + breast cancer further improves progression and invasive disease-free survival in HER2 + breast cancer. In ovarian cancer, pertuzumab has shown a trend toward increase in progression-free survival (17) . The synthetic DNA platform production shown here would allow administration of pertuzumab as a dMAb as well as a DBiTE or their administration as a combination with DNA-encoded checkpoint inhibitors (8, 9) . Such combination approaches have the advantage of a potentially higher antitumor effects using a simplified therapeutic regime that would favor adherence to treatment.",

Antibody humanization is able to reduce antiantibody responses in human therapies (18) , and as we have reported, dMAb engineering can limit responses against anti-drug antibodies (ADAs) (19) . We expect that implementation of this and other ways to prevent antiantibody responses will further contribute to positively influence dMAb circulating levels in future studies. Data from blinatumomab, the only BiTE approved to date, show that there is development of neutralizing ADAs in less than 1% of the patients treated (4). These studies demonstrate that HER2dMAbs can allow for several months of durable expression, which can drive antitumor activity. Further engineering of these expressed forms into BiTEs allows for a significant degree of potency in vivo. dMAb-engineered sequences can be a starting point for development of improved BiTEs when launched from DNA cassettes (HER2DBiTE) and can result in improved half-life extending their antitumor activity. These approaches appear valuable for additional exploration as tools for the treatment of ovarian as well as potentially other cancers.",
