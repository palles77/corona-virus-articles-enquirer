However, as the survival rates of CML patients improves, the prevalence of CML is increasing. The prevalence of CML in France is estimated to epidemic, and what their prognosis has been. Standardized management of this large number of patients has become a new challenge for our hematologists. In order to optimize the care of CML patients as the pandemic spreads, it is therefore essential to understand the characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 infections in CML patients and the experience of their management in Hubei province. When the outbreak started, the 29 centers of the Hubei Anti-Cancer Association Chronic Myeloid Leukemia Standardized Management Collaboration Group adopted comprehensive management measures for CML patients. Various kinds of online consultation, online smart hospitals and online courses were made available to provide patients with information while they remained at home. Individualized treatment schemes were proposed according to the clinical situation of each patient. It was recommended that all patients, especially those with stable conditions, refrain from leaving their homes, and even avoid going to hospitals. Volunteers were organized to",

Thus patients who failed to achieved an optimal response to CML therapy appear more likely to have a symptomatic infection with SARS-CoV-2. This tendency requires further study, but there are two possibilities that might explain it. First, an optimal response to TKI treatment may beassociated with immune recovery. CML patients exhibit selective depletion of effector T reg cells (eT reg cells) 23,24 , while TKIs increase the number of natural killer cells (NK), NK-LGL and T-LGLs cells 25 , which play a role in regulating immunity. Second, previous studies have reported that imatinib and other TKI drugs have antiviral activity in vitro against Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-COV) and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-COV) 26-28 . It will be interesting to see if TKIs also have activity against anti-SARS-CoV-2.We analyzed the 82 respondents living in Wuhan and found that there was 1 clinicallydiagnosed case (1.2%). Of the Japanese citizens evacuated from Wuhan, 8/565 (1.4%) had a confirmed infection with COVID-19 29 . Among 310 CML living patients in Hubei province outside of Wuhan, 1 case of infection (0.32%) was diagnosed.",
