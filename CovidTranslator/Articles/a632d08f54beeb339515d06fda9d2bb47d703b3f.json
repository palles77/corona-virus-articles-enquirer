Previously, we have shown that coronaviruses, after being assembled intracellularly, are released from a specific side of these cells depending on the virus and the cells. Thus, transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) was released from the apical side of porcine kidney LLC-PK1 cells [8] , whereas mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) was released basolaterally from murine kidney epithelial cells (mTAL; [9] ) as well as from LLC-PK1 [10] and from human colon carcinoma cells (Caco-2; [11] ) both stably expressing the recombinant MHV receptor cDNA. We suggested that the apical release of TGEV and the basolateral release of MHV might be factors contributing to the difference in pathogenesis found between TGEV and MHV in their respective natural hosts, the former causing mainly a localized enteric infection, the latter spreading through the body to other organs. However, MHV appeared to be released from the apical membrane when tested in canine kidney cells (MDCK) that stably expressed the recombinant MHV receptor cDNA [11] , an observation incompatible with our hypothesis.",

To this end, LLC-PK1 cells were transfected with pCR3-fAPN (a kind gift of Dr. Kay Holmes, Department of Microbiology, University of Colorado Health Sciences Center, Colorado, USA) containing the neomycin resistance gene and the recombinant feline aminopeptidase N (fAPN) cDNA. The latter encodes the protein that has been shown to function as a receptor for feline, canine, porcine and human coronaviruses. G418-resistant colonies were propagated and functionally tested for fAPN expression by assessing their susceptibility to FIPV (results not shown). One of the positive cell lines was selected for further experimentation and was named PKFA-2. This cell line remained susceptible to FIPV infection for at least 20 passages. PKFA-2 cells were grown on glass coverslips and infected with FIPV strain 1146, FECV strain 1683, CCoV strain I-71 or with the Purdue strain of TGEV. At 6 h p.i. cells were fixed with ice-cold methanol and prepared for indirect immunofluorescence analysis using for TGEV a porcine anti-TGEV serum (a kind gift of Dr. Luis Enjuanes, Centro Nacional de Biotecnologia, CSIC, Universidad Aut\u00f3noma, Canto Blanco, Madrid, Spain) and for FCoVs and CCoV a combination (1:1) of antiserum G73 [15] and ascitic fluid A40, both obtained from experimentally FIPV-infected cats.

To prepare a cell line stably expressing the FIPV receptor glycoprotein, LLC-PK1 cells were transfected with pCR3-fAPN, a plasmid containing the feline APN receptor gene [14] . G418resistant cells were cloned by three rounds of limiting dilution. Cells from a selected clone (named PKFA-2) and LLC-PK1 cells were grown on coverslips and infected with the different viruses. At 6 h p.i. cells were fixed and processed for immunofluorescence analysis as described in the text. The different virus/cell combinations are indicated combination of A40/G73 cross-reacts with the structural proteins of FECV, CCoV and TGEV, although the spike protein of the latter was not recognized. The immunofluorescence observations of Fig. 1 show that the PKFA-2 cells supported FIPV, FECV and CCoV infection while having maintained their susceptibility to TGEV. From this experiment, and others where the m.o.i. was varied, it appeared that in each case essentially all cells could be infected by the different viruses.",

This allowed inoculation both from the apical and from the basolateral side. Routinely, tightness of the monolayer was checked by adding medium to the apical compartment up to a slightly higher level than in the basolateral compartment [2] . No leakage of culture medium from the apical to the basolateral compartment occurred from 24 h after cells were seeded on filters and before 11 h post infection (p.i.). From this observation and previous experiences we decided to finish all further experiments before 9 h p.i. The filter-grown cells were infected from either side with the different viruses at an m.o.i. of 5 and at different times post seeding (p.s.). At 6 h p.i. cells were fixed with ice-cold methanol and processed for an indirect immunofluorescence assay as described previously [8, 9] using the antibodies mentioned above. It was found that at 1 d p.s. all viruses enter the epithelial cells both through the apical and the basolateral side with the same efficiency (results not shown), indicating that the filter was not a physical barrier for the viruses. However, from 2 d p.s. the entry started to become polarized and at 7 d p.s. FECV, FIPV, CCoV and TGEV entered the cells preferentially through the apical side (Fig. 2) as was found before for MHV and TGEV [8, 9] .",

Therefore, parallel cultures of PKFA-2 cells were grown on filters and infected with either virus from the apical side. Apical and basolateral culture media were analysed for the appearance of viral proteins and infectious viral particles. It is of note that, for technical reasons discussed previously [9] , monolayers were used at two days of age. As we observed earlier, the kinetics with which the monolayers developed their polarity of viral entry was delayed as compared with their development of tight junctions and polarity of virus release [8, 9] . Thus, selectivity in the release of viruses occurs already while that of entry has not yet been fully established. In the experiment shown in Fig. 3 infected cells were radiolabelled with 35 S-amino acids from 5-8 h p.i. after which viral proteins were immunoprecipitated from the culture media as described before [8] using the anti-TGEV serum (for TGEV) or the combination of G73/A40 \u1b64 Fig. 2 . Entry of CCoV, FECV, FIPV and TGEV into PKFA-2 cells. PKFA-2 cells cultured on filter supports were infected with the different viruses from the apical or basolateral side at 7 days post seeding. Cells were fixed at 6 h p.i. and processed for immunofluorescence analysis as described in the text Note that the protein present at the top of the gel in some of the basolateral samples is an unidentified cellular protein (Mr \u223c250 kDa) nonspecifically co-immunoprecipitated only from basolateral media of PKFA-2 cells [9] (for FECV, FIPV and CCoV). Subsequently, the samples were loaded onto an SDS-10% polyacrylamide gel and electrophoresed. In agreement with the results obtained with the parental LLC-PK1 cells [8] , TGEV structural proteins were observed predominantly in the apical medium. To our surprise, however, the structural proteins of FECV, FIPV and CCoV had in each case accumulated on the basolateral side of the cells. The basolateral release of these viruses was confirmed when the titres of virus in the media were determined by performing a limiting-dilution assay (n = 3 for each time point; two-fold dilution steps) in PKFA-2 cells. Whereas more than 99% of the infectious TGEV was released into the apical medium, 87, 90 and 93% of the CCoV, FECV and FIPV infectious particles, respectively, were found in the basolateral culture medium similar to the release of MHV from LLC-PK1 cells expressing the MHV-receptor [10] . As discussed previously, these latter figures may even be an underestimation of the basolateral release because many particles become trapped between neighbouring cells and between the filter and the cells [9] .",

FCoVs occur in two serotypes and the FECV and FIPV strains used here are each of type II. It has been reported before that fAPN can also function as a receptor for type I FCoVs [14] . However, we were unable to infect our PKFA-2 cells with the type I FIPV strains UCD-1 and TN406 (results not shown), which is consistent with findings of others [1] . In addition, it was reported recently that a monoclonal antibody against fAPN blocked the infection of Felis catus whole fetus cells by type II but not type I FCoVs [3] . These data imply that type I feline coronaviruses use a receptor that is either different from or required in addition to the fAPN molecule.",

This is similar to the entry of other coronaviruses, i.e., bovine coronavirus [7, 13] , MHV [9] and TGEV [8] . Previously, we have shown that the porcine APN (pAPN) was mainly located on the apical surface of polarized LLC-PK1 cells [8] , similar to the apical localization of the human APN in MDCK cells [16] . Conceivably, the fAPN is also located on this side of epithelial cells. As we were mainly interested in virus release, we did not examine this feature further. The observation that the polarity in virus entry appeared to develop only after cells had been grown for longer periods on filters resembles our earlier observations showing that in young monolayers the viral MHV-and TGEV-receptors are still distributed on both sides [8, 10, 11] . With respect to the in vivo situation -coronaviruses are generally transmitted by the fecal-oral and/or the aerogenic routes -apical entry of coronaviruses into epithelial cells seems logical. By entering the organism's respiratory and/or alimentary tracts the viruses first encounter the apical membranes of the epithelial cells that line these cavities. Entry through the apical surface would thus be an efficient way for the viruses to infect these cells, rather than being transported, for instance, by M-cells in the Peyer's patches, to the basolateral surface of the epithelial cells before infection can occur.",
