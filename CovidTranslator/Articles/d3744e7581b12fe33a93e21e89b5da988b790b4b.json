It is believed to be autoimmune in nature. The cause is unknown; both genetic and environmental factors have been implicated in the pathogenesis. MS generally presents with the acute or subacute onset of neurologic abnormalities that may wax and wane over many years. Diagnosis is generally made by means of observation of the clinical course in conjunction with a neurologic examination and laboratory tests. These tests may include magnetic resonance imaging of the head and spine, lumbar puncture, and evoked potentials. Treatment is based on general suppor& ive care, the use of corticosteroids for relapses, and symptomatic management of ongoing problems. The frequency of relapses can be reduced with interferon-13 (Betaseron). Copolymer 1 and interferon43 la are being evaluated by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for approval for use for reduction in the frequency of relapses in relapsing-remitting MS. Treatment of chronic progression is often attempted with immunosuppressive agents such as corticosteroids, azathioprine, and cyclophosphamide. Use of other agents is being investigated.",

Secondary progressive MS begins with a relapsing-remitting course, but the disease gradually worsens, causing slow accumulation of neurologic signs and symptoms. MS that never has a relapsing-remitting course but begins with a slow progression of signs and symptoms is classified as primary progressive MS. Treatment of MS is based on the progression of an individual case. General health measures include exercise, physical and occupational therapy, a balanced diet, and aggressive treatment of fever and overheating. Treatment of relapses is recommended for moderate to severe relapses. Corticosteroids are choice of treatment of relapses.

Disease activity, as measured with MRI, is particularly high among patients with chronic progressive disease. 4 The acute lesions of MS can now be demonstrated with gadolinium-enhanced MRI. The initial event is associated with local disruption of the blood-brain barrier (Fig. 1) . As the abnormality evolves, increased signal intensity becomes evident on T2-weighted images (Figs. 2 and 3). The lesion may grow larger over a few days and then the areas of high signal intensity may begin to recede. Over time, the lesions may completely resolve on TZweighted images. With each relapse, which is defined by new or newly enhancing lesions on MR images, the older areas of involvement may be reactivated. Reactivation is associated with the development of permanent lesions on MR images. 5 Clinical correlation is frequently observed with areas of contrast enhancement or abnormal signal intensity in the cerebellum, brainstem, or spinal cord. Abnormalities in the cerebral hemispheres are frequently periventricular in distribution and only occasionally correlate with specific symptoms or signs.6,7 The accumulation of lesions in the frontal lobes is associated with a decline in memory.8 In addition, a change in the number of lesions on cranial MR images correlates with a change in overall clinical status as measured with standard scales.g Observations made with MRI are having a marked impact on both our basic knowledge of MS and on therapeutic trialsJo MRI studies will provide considerable insight into the natural history of the disease and will be an excellent independent variable in future clinical trials.",

Plaques are found frequently in a periventricular distribution in the cerebral hemispheres. Some of these plaques may be associated with the distribution of terminal veins.17J8 Plaques may occur anywhere within the white matter. When plaques are near the cortex, sparing of the subcortical myelinated fibers is often observed. Plaques adjacent to gray matter may at times spread into the gray matter, including the cortex and deeper nuclei. Plaques are frequently found in the white matter of the optic nerves, the brainstem, the cerebellum, and the spinal cord. Plaques in these locations more frequently correlate with symptoms. Within a plaque, axons are frequently preserved. 18 The evolution of a plaque is not known. MRI investigations show that the blood-brain barrier is locally disrupted at the onset of symptoms. Pathologists disagree as to whether demyelination precedes inflammation or is secondary to inflammation. At present the latter view predominates. In acute plaques, the inflammatory response of lymphocytes, plasma cells, and macrophages is capable of producing or augmenting demyelination by direct and indirect mechanisms. The inflammatory response is predominantly perivenular, with a lesser response at the edges of or within plaques. The macrophages associated with acute plaques characteristically contain myelin fragments or myelin breakdown products.lg Lymphocytes may contribute to the pathologic process by means of direct or indirect pathways. Direct mechanisms include antibodyand cell-mediated immunity. T-cell-mediated reactivity is favored because most inflammatory cells are T cells. Indirect mechanisms include the secretion of lymphokines and cytokines. The ability of molecules such as tumor necrosis factor to damage myelin or oligodendrocytes is the focus of ongoing research.20 Cytokines may influence macrophage activation, stimulating the phagocytosis of myelin. In addition, the release of heat shock proteins may result in stimulation of Ty6 cells, resulting in increased cytotoxicity.",

These models provide an opportunity for the investigation of autoimmune and virus-associated disease, respectively. EAE is an autoimmune disease of the CNS and a model for immunotherapy. A CD4+ T-cell population specific for a myelin antigen, either MBP or proteolipid protein, is required for initiation EAE. EAE and MS share characteristics that include CNS demyelination, perivascular T cells, association with MHC class II antigens, and possibly restricted TCR V-gene utilization.4g The murine adoptive transfer model has another important feature of MS: the chronic relapsing clinical course.4g This clinical course is useful for investigations of the immune response and immunotherapy not only during onset of the disease but also during relapse. The pathologic features of this murine transfer model are inflammation and prominent demyelination.4g-51 EAE is not associated with an environmental factor.",

In this model, antecedent mild or even subclinical viral encephalitis is followed by a period of quiescence and the eventual onset of demyelination. 50 The virus is persistent during the demyelinating phase of the disease. This implies that either low-level expression of viral polypeptides or immunologic cross-reactivity between virus and myelin antigens is crucial for initiating demyelination. The demyelination in the TME virus model is mediated by T lymphocytes. These T cells may have viral specificity but produce demyelination. This mechanism would be relevant to MS if the suspected environmental factor were one or several viruses. As in MS and EAE, T cells appear to initiate immunemediated demyelination in TME.!~~z~~ Experimental immunotherapies are evaluated in these animal models and provide a basis for clinical trials in human beings. Examples of these investigational treatments include cytokine transforming growth factor-i3, (TGF131,53 lymphokine-toxin,54 anti-T-cell receptor Vb-specific monoclonal antibody,55,56 T-cell vaccination,57 blocking peptides, anti-adhesion molecule specific monoclonal antibodies,5g and nitric oxide synthetase inhibition. 60 These experimental models provide an invaluable resource for the study of immunotherapy.

Many types of nystagmus are identified, including pendular nystagmus, small-amplitude nystagmus, or gaze-evoke nystagmus.63a65a66 Absent abdominal reflexes in a slender patient who has not undergone an abdominal operation may be a helpful sign. A mild intention tremor with or without past-pointing is also an early sign, as is a positive Romberg sign or difficulty with balance with 24 DiVZ,January 1996 tandem gait. Subtle motor weakness or spasticity may also be found. Loss of vibratory or proprioceptive sensation in the lower extremities is common early in the course of the disease. MS should be strongly suspected in young or middle-aged adults who describe symptoms consistent with the Lhermitte sign in the absence of obvious cervical cord abnormalities. The Lhermitte sign consists of paresthesia or an electric shock-like sensation that radiates up the head or down the spine on neck flexion or extension. Other important abnormalities are gait disturbances, persistent binocular double vision when looking in a particular direction, or a history of optic neuritis or transverse myelitis.

Much of the pain reported with MS is musculoskeletal and is related to abnormal use of muscles and joints. For example, patients who use a wheelchair may experience wrist, shoulder, or elbow pain from manipulating the wheelchair. Patients with paraparesis or ataxia may experience back or leg pain from poor posture and balance when walking. These problems should be treated with antiinflammatory medications and physical therapy. Primary MS pain is often dysesthetic.14z The patient describes a burning sensation or perhaps even electric shock-like pain. This pain can be in any location, but it is most commonly in the lower extremities. Some patients experience tic douloureux or atypical facial pain. This primary pain may be controlled with tricyclic antidepressants, phenytoin, or carbamazepine.142 In patients with refractory pain, valproic acid can be tried. 13Z Headaches can become a problem in patients with MS.

            "text": "Research involving medications to improve the symptoms that limit the lives of many patients with MS is ongoing and should continue. 4-Amino-pyridine and 2,3-diamino-pyridine are being studied as agents that may improve conduction through poorly myelinated areas. These agents may reduce double vision, improve strength, and possibly reduce tremor. More research is needed to evaluate these DM,January 1996 47 and other compounds that may improve the quality of life of many patients with MS. Although the cause of MS remains a mystery, important advances have been made in the understanding and treatment of MS in the past few years. As this trend continues, we may have more diverse and effective therapies to offer patients with MS in the years to come.",
