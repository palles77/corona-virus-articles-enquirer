            "text": "Laryngotracheobronchitis is a common childhood illness affecting 3% of children. Most of the affected children are aged between 6 months and 3 years, with a peak incidence of 60 per 1000 child-years in those children aged between 1 and 2 years [1] . Epidemiological studies suggest that 1-5% of children with croup are admitted to hospital and 2-3% of those admitted children, require intubation [2] . Death is extremely rare and has been estimated to occur in no more than 1 in 30 000 cases [2] . Parainfluenza (types 1 and 3), and influenza A and B are the most common viral agents causing croup. Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), rhinovirus, coronavirus, metapneumovirus and adenovirus are also responsible for this illness. There is seasonality to the prevalence with more presentations in the autumn. There is an annual pattern influenced by the variability of the viruses in the community for that year [2] .",

            "text": "Croup is characterised by a \"barking\" cough, hoarse voice, stridor and respiratory distress caused by generalised airway inflammation and oedema of the upper airway mucosa. Most children have mild illness which resolves spontaneously without any specific treatment. However, some children have severe illness with stridor, respiratory distress and hypoxaemia requiring intubation. Current evidence strongly supports the use of glucocorticoids for the management of croup [3] . Previously it was felt that steroids took up to 6 h to have an effect on the airway [4] , but a recent Cochrane review concluded that glucocorticoids improve croup symptoms at 2 h with the effect lasting at least 24 h [3] . Glucocorticoids also reduce rates of return visits, admissions and readmissions. When treated with placebo, 204 out of every 1000 children will return for medical care. When treated with glucocorticoids, 74-153 out of every 1000 children will return for medical care [3] . Glucocorticoids reduce the length of stay by 15 h (range 6-24 h), but make no difference to the need for additional treatments. Dexamethasone 0.15 mg\u00b7kg \u22121 or prednisolone 1 mg\u00b7kg \u22121 would be the recommended treatment dosing [2] , although other guidelines suggest doses up to 0.6 mg\u00b7kg \u22121 of dexamethasone [3] .",

Nebulised adrenaline has been associated with a clinically and statistically significant transient reduction in croup symptoms 30 min post-treatment [5] and can \"buy time\" for steroids to act. Children with croup develop swelling of inner mucosal layers of the larynx and trachea. Nebulised adrenaline is thought to act by stimulating \u03b1-adrenergic receptors in subglottic mucous membranes, producing vasoconstriction and decreased mucosal oedema. The clinical effect is sustained for at least 1 h, but disappears after 2 h. Studies of nebulised adrenaline treatment of croup have used both racemic and l-adrenaline. One small trial found that l-adrenaline (5.0 mL, 0.1% (1:1000)) was as effective and safe as racemic adrenaline (0.5 mL, 2.25%) [7] . When racemic and l-adrenaline are compared, there is no difference in croup score at 30 m (standardised mean difference 0.33, 95% CI \u22120.42-1.08), but at 2 h l-adrenaline shows a small reduction in croup score compared with racemic adrenaline (standardised mean difference 0.87, 95% CI 0.09-1.65) [5] .",

They concluded that nebulised adrenaline is effective for the treatment of acute mild to moderately severe croup and that it should be used as a first line treatment [14] . This has not been taken up universally, but it is now standard practice in some countries to use steroids and nebulised adrenaline in the emergency department, watch the patients for 2 h and then discharge home if well enough [2] . The final two studies both used steroids and nebulised adrenaline, showing clearly a good response to the treatment with no rebound or indeed any major re-emergence of symptoms [12, 13] .",
