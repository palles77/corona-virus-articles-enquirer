            "text": "East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). 2 As of March 9 th , 2020, COVID-19 has infected more than 100,000 people worldwide and caused more than 3,500 deaths, and the data are still increasing; in Wuhan, the fatality rate of COVID-19 was 4.8% (2404/49965). Of note, critically ill patients with COVID-19 have a high mortality rate. In a study of 52 critically ill patients in Wuhan, 32 (61.5%) patients died at 28 days and the mortality rate was 81.1% (30/37) in patients requiring mechanical ventilation. 3 Accumulated evidence has strongly demonstrated that systemic inflammatory response, acute kidney injury (AKI) and fluid overload (FO) were associated with high mortality in severe sepsis. [4] [5] [6] In critically ill patients with COVID-19, the overwhelming inflammation including C-reactive protein (CRP) and interleukin (IL)-6, IL-8, IL-10, tumor necrosis factor \u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1) were observed, 7-10 which is consistent with patients suffering from SARS-CoV 11 and MERS-CoV. 12 Continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) is a great help in critically ill patients not only to control of electrolyte, acid-base derangements but also to remove inflammatory mediators and improves oxygenation in fluid overload. [13] [14] [15] CRRT has been applied to critically ill patients, including patients with SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and other viral infectious diseases such as Ebola virus disease. 14, 16 However, the benefits of CRRT are still no consistent conclusion in critically ill patients. 17 CRRT significantly reduced the level of IL-6 and decreases hospital mortality rate in pediatric severe sepsis, especially in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). 18 Besides, a meta-analysis revealed that patients who received CRRT had significantly lower mortality compared to conventional therapy. 19 Hoverer, CRRT was associated with increased mortality in patients with MERS-CoV. 16 The relationship between CRRT and patients' outcome varied in patients with the different disease and was effected by the modalities, anticoagulation, vascular access management, timing of initiation and intensity of CRRT. 17, 20, 21 To date, no specific treatment has been confirmed to be effective for COVID-19, and supportive treatment remains essential. As far as we know, the effect of CRRT on critically ill patients with COVID-19 has not been reported. In this retrospective cohort study, we aimed to explore the effect of CRRT on all-cause mortality in patients with COVID-19 undergoing invasive mechanical ventilation and the risk factors for mortality in patients with CRRT treatment.",

Inflammatory storm may originate from the following aspects. First, SARS-Cov-2 infects patients by binding human ACE2, 29, 30 which is widely expressed in multiple organs throughout the body. 31 SARS-CoV-2 might lead to multi-system inflammation through ACE/Ang II/AT1R pathway and ACE2/Ang (1-7)/Mas receptor pathway. 32, 33 Second, it was reported that antibody dependent enhancement (ADE) of SARS-CoV-2 due to prior exposure to other coronaviruses might also be involved in COVID-19. ADE can elicit sustained inflammation, lymphopenia, and/or cytokine storm, which makes it a possible explanation for the geographic limitation of severe cases. 34 Third, combined infections may lead to a more severe systemic inflammatory response. Indeed, in our study, some patients combined with infection in other organs (e.g. urinary tract, blood) and other pathogen (e.g. influenza virus, fungus). Fourth, shock, hypoxemia and coagulation pathway abnormalities in critical patients could aggravate systemic inflammatory response, which become a vicious cycle, threatening life. 35, 36 In our study, CRRT was associated with prolonged survival in COVID-19 patients with invasive mechanical ventilation. CRRT is a widely used blood purification therapy, which achieves a high solute clearance rate through diffusion, convection, ultrafiltration, and adsorption. The primary goal of CRRT is to compensate for the loss of renal function and associated sequelae, including uremic toxins, electrolyte disturbances, metabolic acidosis, and volume overload 37 . Besides these, CRRT can also remove cytokines from the bloodstream. Emerging evidence has shown that CRRT was associated with significantly lower mortality in patients with severe sepsis. 18, 19, 38 In addition, in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome, CRRT could remove All rights reserved.

Elevated cTnI in serumreflects damage to cardiomyocytes with a high myocardial specificity. 53 Patients with increased cTnI levels showed higher in-ICU mortality of pneumonia. 54 NT-proBNP is a natural hormone with biological activity synthesized by cardiomyocytes and mainly expressed in the ventricle. The rapid synthesis and release of NT-proBNP into the blood due to myocardial dilation regulate the cardiac function among patients with left ventricular dysfunction.
