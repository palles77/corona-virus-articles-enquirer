SARS had a significant impact, not only on the health systems of affected countries but also on their local economies (Bennett 2006, 4-5) . The experience with SARS provided important insights into the clinical management of patients with infectious respiratory disease and was an impetus to the strengthening of domestic public health preparedness (Choi and Lam 2009) and global public health surveillance tools (Braden et al. 2013) .

It is timely to consider whether there are lessons from the experience of public health over the past decade that we can utilise to improve our preparedness for pandemic disease. During the past decade, in addition to SARS and H1N1, we have seen the spread of highly pathogenic avian influenza (World Health Organization 2011c, 4-5) and the emergence of a new influenza subtype with H7N9 (Gao et al. 2013; Uyeki and Cox 2013) . While SARS and influenza are very different diseases, with differing patterns of transmission and disease-related mortality, the two of them serve as interesting and contrasting bookends to a decade that has been characterised by a renewed focus on infectious diseases and global health governance.",

While initiatives to improve global public health laws, along with strengthening of regional and national preparedness, have been a step forward, the deeper ethical and practical challenges will be shown to remain poorly addressed. Thus there is as yet no antidote to the tendency for some nations to overreact (contravening free trade and travel expectations) or fail to adequately report on the reasons for special domestic measures, or any real answer to the inability of many countries to afford the associated costs of adequate planning.",

The International Health Regulations (IHR) is a key document in global public health law. Originally developed out of the international sanitary conferences and conventions of the 19th and 20th centuries, the IHR established a framework for controlling the international spread of infectious diseases and specifying the maximum measures that could be taken by countries in response to disease outbreaks in other countries (Fidler 2004, 28-34) . Unfortunately, by the time SARS arrived to challenge global public health, the IHR had become outdated and of limited efficacy (Bennett 2006, 8; Fidler 2004, 36) . Importantly the IHR only required countries to report cases of three diseases to the World Health Organization-cholera, yellow fever, and plague.",

Revisions to the IHR were adopted by the World Health Assembly in May 2005, with the revised IHR entering into force in June 2007 (World Health Organization 2008) . Although the revised IHR still contain a list of specified diseases that must be reported to the World Health Organization, it also takes a broader approach that focuses on whether an event is a public health emergency of international concern, with the assessment to consider events in terms of their seriousness, whether they are unusual or unexpected, their risk of international spread, and their risk of restrictions on international trade or travel (World Health Organization 2008, Annex 2). As French and Mykhalovskiy note, the move in the IHR (2005) from listed diseases to events that constitute a public health emergency \"reflects an enlarged conceptual space for thinking about pandemics\" (French and Mykhalovskiy 2013, 12) .",

Furthermore, the establishment of a National IHR Focal Point within countries as required by the revised International Health Regulations (World Health Organization 2008, Article 4), to serve as a point of contact with the World Health Organization, ensured that WHO was able to communicate updated pandemic information quickly and effectively to Member States during the pandemic (Katz and Fischer 2010, 5) . While in general the revised regulations seem to have worked well during the 2009 pandemic, with countries displaying openness in their willingness to share information and technical assistance during the pandemic (Katz and Fischer 2010, 5-6) , there were some difficulties, particularly with countries introducing restrictions on trade or travel that did not accord with the official advice opposing such restrictions at the time (Katz and Fischer 2010, 6; Wilson, Brownstein, and Fidler 2010, 507; World Health Organization 2011c, 62-63) .",

Similar concerns have been expressed by others. Noting the use of restrictive measures during the H1N1 pandemic, and the lack of enforcement mechanisms in the International Health Regulations, Wilson, Brownstein, and Fidler have expressed concern that these measures were used in response to a relatively mild pandemic, raising the possibility \"of more widespread violations if a more dangerous virus emerges and spreads\" (2010, 507). While recognising that restrictions might have been even more widespread without the Regulations, they point out that the implementation of unnecessary restrictions may serve to undermine the willingness of States to report events that may constitute a public health emergency of international concern, thus raising the possibility of the IHR regulatory framework being \"at risk of unravelling through systematic violations, in much the same way as earlier versions of the regulations did\" (Wilson, Brownstein, and Fidler 2010, 507) .",

An example of such regional coordination can be seen in the Asia Pacific Strategy for Emerging Diseases (World Health Organization 2011a; Coker et al. 2011, 605) . The Strategy provides a framework to assist countries with strengthening their capacity to respond to emerging diseases. However, it has been argued that while many countries in East and South-East Asia are now better able to respond to infectious diseases than they were a decade ago, \"[g]iven the continued scale and pace of change in East and South-east Asia, it is vital that the capacity to predict and identify biologic threats and to protect the public's health does not stagnate as the memory of SARS fades\" (Horby, Pfieffer, and Oshitani 2013, 859) . In a study of pandemic preparedness in six Asian countries, Hanvoravongchai et al. (2010) found that of the six countries studied-Cambodia, Indonesia, Lao PDR, Taiwan, Thailand, and Vietnam-each had pandemic plans and that pandemic preparedness was shaped by the health systems within countries, while the degree to which preparedness was regarded as a priority was also shaped by local political and historical contexts. Furthermore, while countries had developed their pandemic preparedness for avian influenza, with surveillance often focused on poultry, the development of H1N1/2009 highlighted the need to be able to change strategies to take account of changing circumstances (Hanvoravongchai et al. 2010) . Kamigaki and Oshitani (2010) also have noted that a number of South-East Asian countries had developed their pandemic plans for the more deadly H5N1 avian flu and that H1N1/2009 presented a different set of issues. They noted that a number of South-East Asian countries lack the surge capacity in the health system, the stockpiles of antivirals, and the intensive care facilities necessary for an effective early response to a pandemic (Kamigaki and Oshitani 2010, 6) . Demographic factors can also affect the impact of a pandemic on a particular country. Kamigaki and Oshitani have noted that past pandemics, including the H1N1/2009 pandemic, have been characterised by excess mortality being concentrated in younger age groups, in contrast to the pattern for seasonal influenza that typically strikes the elderly. As Kamigaki and Oshitani note, this characteristic of influenza pandemics could potentially impact on the severity of a pandemic within the region, given that many countries in South-East Asia have younger populations and higher fertility rates than OECD countries (Kamigaki and Oshitani 2010, 6-7) .",

The Hong Kong plan expressly included surveillance of poultry outlets, farms, pet bird traders, and wild birds (Health, Welfare and Food Bureau 2005, 3) . Furthermore the plan included references to HPAI (highly pathogenic avian influenza) in the alert and serious response levels in the pandemic plan, although the highest level, the emergency response level, referred more broadly to \"efficient human-to-human transmission of novel influenza\" or the declaration of an influenza pandemic by the World Health Organization (Health, Welfare and Food Bureau 2005, 17-18) . The Singapore plan also expressly referred to avian influenza in the plan (Ministry of Health Singapore 2009). The Indonesian plan expressly recognised that the strategy for control of avian influenza and the strategy for human pandemic influenza preparedness share a number of common goals. One part of the Indonesian plan focused on a national strategy for controlling avian influenza, while another part of the plan focused on preparedness for human pandemic influenza (Republic of Indonesia 2006). These findings match with those in the studies discussed above and the findings by Coker and Mounier-Jack's 2006 analysis of pandemic plans in Asian countries, where they found that Asia-Pacific pandemic plans expressly linked their preparedness for human influenza pandemics with preparedness for avian influenza (Coker and Mounier-Jack 2006, 887) . Furthermore, in an analysis of 119 national pandemic plans, WHO found that more than half of the plans had been developed for a pandemic emerging from avian influenza (World Health Organization 2011b).",

While a broad spectrum menu of options may enable low-income countries to more cheaply afford to build pandemic planning around any existing disaster infrastructure, such calibration of responses may appear to be an unaffordable luxury of little benefit to citizens of countries where resources are beyond inadequate to start with.

While we will all be at risk during a pandemic-something that Battin et al. (2009) capture by conceptualising each of us as both potentially a victim and a vector-it is also clearly the case that some populations will be particularly at risk during a pandemic. Some of this vulnerability may come from the characteristics of the particular disease, for example, whether the disease strikes the young, people who already have underlying health conditions, or pregnant women. Some of this vulnerability also will likely arise from social and economic vulnerability. There is increasing recognition of the importance of including vulnerable populations in planning for emergencies and of developing understandings of vulnerability that are inclusive of social and economic vulnerability (Campbell et al. 2009; Hutchins et al. 2009; World Health Organization 2013b) . In an analysis of 37 pandemic plans published from 2001 -2006 , Uscher-Pines et al. (2007 found that references to vulnerability tended to focus on biological or medical risk (in 20 plans) and that where reference was made to social disadvantage it was in the plans of high-income countries. Furthermore, it has been argued that the dominance of scientific, political, and legal discourses in pandemic plans, over social, cultural, and ethical discourses, serves to obscure the needs and interests of disadvantaged populations (Garoon and Duggan 2008 ; see also Bennett and Carney 2014; Carney and Bennett 2014) .",

When we seek to engage the \"community\" in our pandemic planning, it is vitally important that we do so in inclusive and supportive ways. However, while it is a welcome development when public health legislation addresses vulnerability such as through the \"equity principle\" of section 13 of the South Australian Public Health Act 2011, it may be doubted that this will necessarily count for much in the \"heat of battle\" when managing an acute crisis, even in a well-resourced country such as Australia. More purchase may be achieved by other principles in the South Australian Act, such as those promoting \"participatory planning\" (s 11) or the \"utilitarian balancing\" process laid down in section 14, which counterpoises goals of public protection and the taking of personal responsibility for risk minimisation against interests such as dignity, privacy, and civil rights.

Likewise the attention to public participation and the process for striking a utilitarian liberal form of balancing off of competing ethical precepts under section 14 of the 2011 South Australian legislation, where measures grounded in addressing \"harm to others\" (the public at large) are constrained by principles of proportionality to the risk posed, application of the least restrictive alternative principle, and consideration for the dignity, autonomy, or other interests of affected citizens. There have been other advances as well, including greater recognition of risks to vulnerable populations and the importance of culturally sensitive communication strategies. However, this paper suggests that the most pressing ethical issues remain outstanding: namely addressing the complex structural, socio-economic, cultural, and political issues and a lack of sufficient attention to issues of distributional justice between and within regions and countries.
