Measles is associated with induction of both a long-lived protective immune response and immunosuppression. To gain insight into immunological changes during measles virus infection, we examined gene expression in blood mononuclear cells from children with acute measles and children in the convalescent phase compared to uninfected control children. There were 13 significantly upregulated and 206 downregulated genes. Upregulated genes included the immune regulatory molecules interleukin 1\u2424 (IL-1\u2424), CIAS-1, tumor necrosis factor alpha, PDE4B, PTGS2, IL-8, CXCL2, CCL4, ICAM-1, CD83, GOS-2, IER3 (IEX-1), and TNFAIP3 (A20). Plasma levels of IL-1\u2424 and IL-8 were elevated during measles virus infection. Downregulated genes mainly involved three gene ontology biological processes, transcription, signal transduction, and the immune response, and included IL-16 and cell surface receptors IL-4R, IL-6R, IL-7R, IL-27RA, CCR2, and CCR7. Most mRNAs had not returned to control values 1 month after discharge, consistent with prolonged immune response abnormalities during measles virus infection.",

After infection of the respiratory epithelium, MV is transported to the regional lymph nodes, probably by dendritic cells or macrophages (9) . After replication in lymphoid tissue, there is systemic spread to multiple organs including skin, spleen, and liver. Infection induces a robust immune response beginning at the time of the rash with production of immunoglobulin M antibody to the MV nucleoprotein and induction of cellular immune responses. Antibodies are made to most MV proteins, with immunoglobulin G1 as the predominant isotype (9) . The cellular immune response is responsible for the characteristic measles rash and is important for viral clearance (33, 48) . Patients with agammaglobulinemia develop a rash and recover, while those with defects in cellular immunity may not (8, 23) .",

There were no significantly regulated genes at entry, 224 at discharge, and 32 at follow-up. The results were pooled and duplicate genes were averaged, leaving 13 upregulated genes and 206 downregulated genes. Similar results were obtained by comparing controls versus days 2 to 4, 6 to 11, and 36 to 61. The significant groups with more than five genes for the GO biological processes annotation were identified. The only upregulated groups were signal transduction and apoptosis, which overlapped significantly. Upregulated genes included the cytokines IL-1\u2424 and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-\u2423), chemokines CCL4, CXCL2, and IL-8, cell surface molecules ICAM-1 and CD83, and regulatory proteins CIAS-1 (NALP3), IER3 (IEX-1), PDE4B, PRGS2, GOS2, and TNFAIP3 (A20) (Fig.  2) . These mRNAs increased at entry, peaked at discharge, and declined but remained above the control levels at follow-up. The downregulated gene classifications fell into three broad GO biological process groups: transcription, signal transduction, and the immune response (Table 2 ). These gene expression levels were decreased at entry, and for most, the lowest expression levels were at discharge. There was a tendency to recover by follow-up, although not back to control levels ( ). The largest gene groups in these classifications were zinc finger proteins (n \u03ed 10) and transcription factors (n \u03ed 10). The signal transduction biological process group included the classifications signal transduction, protein amino acid phosphorylation, and cell surface receptor-linked signal transduction. There were nine receptor genes and eight kinases in this group. The immune response biological process group included the classifications immune response, antimicrobial humoral response, and cellular defense response. Genes within these classifications included the cytokines IL-16 and TNFSF3 (LT\u2424) and the cytokine and chemokine receptors IL-4R, IL-6R, IL-7R, IL-27RA, CCR2, and CCR7 (Fig. 3) .",

The function of one upregulated gene, TNFAIP3 (A20), is to downregulate the activity of IRF-3, a key transcription factor for induction of IFN (19, 38) . This pattern is in contrast to the mRNAs increased by in vitro MV infection of dendritic cells and PBMCs that were predominantly IFN and IFN-responsive genes (3, 50) . Likewise, PBMCs from influenza virus-infected humans and smallpox virus-infected monkeys showed significant upregulation of immune modulators induced by IFN (35, 36) . However, PBMCs from patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome showed a similar pattern to measles with several upregulated genes from the innate immune system, but no IFN-induced genes (35) . This suggests that gene expression in PBMCs during the phase of measles studied reflects primarily the immune response to infection, not infection per se. Because measles is not recognized until the rash appears as virus clearance is initiated 10 to 14 days after infection, and changes in gene expression are rapid and tightly controlled (3, 4, 50) , it is possible that an IFN response would have been detected earlier in infection.",

CCL4 is produced at sites of interaction between antigen-specific dendritic cells and CD4 \u03e9 T cells and attracts na\u00efve CD8 \u03e9 T cells that express CCR5 (5, 22, 32) . CXCL2 and IL-8 are structurally related (42) . Both IL-8 and CXCL2 bind to CXCR2, but IL-8 also binds to CXCR1 expressed on a subset of effector CD8 T cells (12, 45) . CXCL2 may contribute to lung injury during viral infection (20) . Infection of epithelial cells with a number of respiratory viruses, including MV, increases expression of IL-8 in vitro (40) . IL-8 is increased in the plasma of monkeys early after MV infection (40) and, in this study, was increased in children with measles during the rash. However, CCL4 and CXCL2 plasma levels were lower during acute infection, suggesting that the changes seen in PBMCs may have local effects that were not reflected in plasma. Expression of many more genes was decreased than increased, and these decreased mRNAs encoded proteins involved in signaling and regulation of transcription. In contrast, in lipopolysaccharide-challenged humans, the downregulated genes were involved in respiration, protein synthesis, and degradation (4) , and in smallpox virus-infected monkeys, the downregulated genes were T and B cell markers and reflected lymphopenia. Acute measles changes were most similar to those induced by chronic HIV-1 infection in humans, where genes associated with signal transduction, immune response, and transcription were also largely downregulated (27) . Simian immunodeficiency virus-infected macaques sampled at 3 and 7 weeks after infection had two downregulated zinc finger proteins similar to measles but otherwise showed quite different responses with few downregulated genes (47) . Although the cell composition of the PBMC compartment is changing during measles virus infection, we do not think that this had a significant effect on the results, because the largest alterations in cell composition occurred at entry. This fact may have contributed to the variability and lack of significantly regulated genes at this time.",

Several receptors for cytokines and chemokines were downregulated: IL-4R, IL-6R, IL-7R, IL-27RA, CCR2, and CCR7. CCR2, the receptor for MCP1 (CCL2), MCP3 (CCL7), and MCP5 (CCL12), is highly expressed on monocytes and is downregulated when monocytes differentiate into macrophages (21, 31) . Both TLR2 and TLR4 agonists downregulate CCR2, and the MV H protein can activate TLR2 (2, 30) . CCR7 is important for dendritic cell and T cell homing to lymph nodes and is upregulated early after MV infection of dendritic cells (50) but is absent on effector memory cells (15) , which express receptors necessary for migration to inflamed tissues. This decrease is consistent with an ongoing T cell effector response during the rash phase of measles (9, 39) . Also consistent with an effector memory response is the increase in phosphodiesterase-4 (PDE4B) that is expressed at high levels in memory CD4 \u03e9 T cells, where it regulates degradation of cyclic AMP, a mediator of inflammatory responses (43) .",
