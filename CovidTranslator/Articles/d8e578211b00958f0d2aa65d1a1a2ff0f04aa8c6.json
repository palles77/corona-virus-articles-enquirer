Not only does it affects the person's life, but also causes serious epidemic contagious, because patients can not get help with hospital on time. With the development of wireless communication network, patient may get medical information by wireless network device. It can alleviate contradictions between patients and medical resources. But in developing countries, population quantity is a big data. How to solve data packets in wireless communication network is a big problem when researchers face huge population. In order to solve some problems in big data communication, this paper founds availability data transmission routing algorithm. This algorithm can reduce energy consumption and overhead, then improve deliver ratio in big data communication. Compare with Spray and Wait algorithm, Binary spray and wait algorithm in opportunistic networks, this algorithm acquires good results by reduce energy consumption, overhead and deliver ratio.",

Figure 2 shows data transmitting in big data mobile health environment. Effective data packets are recorded by sensor devices and they can transmit to mobile devices. According to data collection, all the data can be sent to hospital and doctors. Data will be analyzed. Hospital and doctors receive patients' request by mobile devices. This request contains patients' check indicator, illness describing, and patient requirement and so on. Doctors diagnose the condition of patients' index from mobile device, and then give treatment list for patients. Patients can download list and look over diagnostic results. At the same time, patients may send these results to their relationships.

Secondly, the lost of the data leads to the low deliver ratio. Thirdly, with multiple neighbor nodes, the spraying will consume great routing overhead of the source node. The Spray and wait algorithm is not an optimal selection. The Binary spray and wait algorithm [16] is an optimization of the Spray and wait algorithm. It reduces routing overhead in the way that the source node sends 1/2 data data packets to the neighbor nodes and stores the rest data. However, this algorithm can be adopted only in networks with few nodes. With the increase of nodes and data data packets, the problems in Spray and wait algorithm occur again.",

            "text": "After algorithm design and setting simulation apportionment, we will compare with three algorithms Spray and wait(S&W), Binary spray and wait(BS&W) and ADTRA. The simulation is as follows. Fig. 7 The relationship between consume energy and node Figure 7 shows the relationship between energy and node. Before 300 nodes are participated in transmitting messages, energy consumption in ADTRA is greater than the BS&W. When nodes is reached more than 400, ADTRA energy consumption is less than BS&W. ADTRA can save energy consumption under the condition of the nodes. When nodes is 1000, ADTRA energy consumption is the least. BS&W energy consumption is less than S&W. ADTRA and BS&W acquire good effect, especially ADTRA more suitable used in big data environment. Figure 8 shows the relationship between overhead and node. In simulation experiment, S&W algorithm in routing overhead is very high. The number of nodes in 500, S&W is around 1000, when node number 1000, routing overhead is over 3200. Obviously, S&W algorithm is not suitable for application in big data environment. ADTRA and BS&W are not increased obvious. Especially nodes are less than 280, BS&W is smaller than ADTRA routing overhead. The nodes are more than 300, routing overhead for BS&W is less than BS&W and ADTRA. Nodes are participated to 1000, routing overhead ADTRA is BS&W 75 % of consumption. Explain ADTRA has better optimization effect. Figure 9 is the relationship between deliver ratio and node. In initial stage, the participation message nodes are 100, ADTRA and BS&W transmission deliver ratio is over 40 %, S&W is also exceeded 30 %. With the increase of nodes, three algorithms of deliver ratio are raised. This suggests that in opportunistic network, transmission deliver ratio is improved by increasing when the nodes of the algorithm. When nodes reach 600, ADTRA deliver ratio is more than 70 %, when the nodes reach 800, ADTRA deliver ratio is more than 80 %, when the nodes reach 1000, ADTRA algorithm deliver ratio is more than 90 %. Explain ADTRA when the more data, higher transmission rate. And, in the node reaches 1000, ADTRA deliver ratio is 1.5 times than S&W. It is said ADTRA has good effect to improve deliver ratio in transmission. Deliver ratio is most important parameter in big data mobile heath environment. So it needs to design sending data data packets in different time. The time intervals are 5, 10 and 15 s. The simulation result is as Fig. 10 .",

It is said, ADTRA at different time distribution of data data packets can be get higher deliver ratio. And then the more data data packets interval longer, the higher deliver ratio arrive at. Figure 11 shows the end-to-end delay on average. In the simulation, three samples are collected at different moments when nodes join in transmission. In Fig. 11 , the highest delay occurs in the spray and wait algorithm, which exceeds 2800. Binary spray and wait and ADTRA are better than the spray and wait algorithm because many data packets are lost during transmission via the multicopy algorithm. In the ADTRA, the end-to-end delay stabilizes at 400 when 1000 nodes transmit because effective data packets are adopted. Table 5 and Fig. 12 record surplus energy for nodes that are transmitted in simulation. All of the nodes are divided into four groups and are indexed c0-c249, t0-t249, w0-w249, and r0-r249 in the map. Surplus energy is recorded per hour by each one hundred on average. Surplus energy for three algorithms is shown in Table 5 .",
