We used simulation approaches to reproduce three actual cases where groups of hospital occupants reported to be either infected or not infected when SARS patients were hospitalized in nearby rooms. Simulations using both computational fluid dynamics (CFD) and multi-zone models were carried out to understand the dilution level of SARS virus-laden aerosols during these scenarios. We also conducted a series of measurements to validate the simulations. The ventilation rates (dilution level) for infection and non-infection were determined based on these scenarios. The safe ventilation rate for eliminating airborne viral infection is to dilute the air emitted from a SARS patient by 10000 times with clean air. Dilution at lower volumes, specifically 1000 times, is insufficient for protecting non-infected people from SARS exposure and the risk of infection is very high. This study provides a methodology for investigating the necessary ventilation rate from an engineering viewpoint.",

Compared with contact infection which can be avoided by quarantine or chemical disinfection, airborne transmission is potentially more dangerous and uncontrollable. Thus, it is important to understand the circumstances under which airborne transmission of SARS may be possible and, more specifically, what ventilation rate is required to sufficiently dilute virus-laden air and reduce the risk of airborne viral transmission indoors. The latter question can inform the design of ventilation systems that prevent indoor airborne transmission of SARS and other similar infectious diseases.",

Cross-ventilation refers to a high rate of air exchange between the indoor and outdoor environments by either natural forces or mechanical ventilators. In hospitals with relatively high ventilation rates, there were no reported SARS cases due to crossinfection. While a high ventilation rate could not reduce the total viral load emitted from SARS patients, the subsequent dilution effect appears to have lowered the airborne viral concentration. This suggests a possible threshold SARS infectious concentration (or, dilution) such that, when the airborne viral concentration is lower than the threshold the possibility of infection is very low. This hypothesis, if proven true, could provide basis for a minimum ventilation rate requirement during outbreaks of SARS and other similar infectious diseases.",

An infinite ventilation rate would theoretically be sufficient, but is not a practical solution given the high energy requirements. Thus, the minimum ventilation rate (equivalent to the dilution level) is an important characteristic of an efficient and safe ventilation system. This research attempts to determine the minimum ventilation rate required for safe and efficient ventilation using numerical simulation approaches. These attempts are based on quantitative analysis of one infection case and two non-infection cases in two Chinese hospitals during the 2003 SARS outbreak. This study illustrates a method for determining the safe rate of ventilation by reproducing both infective and non-infective environments using simulation tools.",

It typically spreads through air by attaching to larger particles or assembling into clusters (Rota et al. 2003; Junge 1963) . Two widely-accepted vehicles of airborne infectious disease transmission from an infected individual's exhalation, coughing and sneezing include large droplets (sputum) that are 10 \u2212 100 \u03bcm (Duguid 1945; Chao et al. 2009 ) and smaller particles approximately 10 \u03bcm (Morawska 2006; Nicas et al. 2005) . Studies suggest that droplets larger than 20 \u03bcm rapidly settle onto surfaces (Gold and Nankervis 1989) , while droplets between 0.5 and 20 \u03bcm remain in the air for a longer time and are therefore more likely to be captured into the respiratory tract and produce infection (McCluskey et al. 1996) . If particles carrying pathogens are inhaled by and deposited into the respiratory tract of a susceptible individual, disease can result. Thus, when dealing with airborne transmission, a primary concern is particles smaller than 1 \u03bcm or, droplet nuclei, which can remain suspended in the air for long periods of time (Morawska 2006; Nicas et al. 2005; Wang et al. 2005; .",

From a fluid dynamics standpoint, virus-laden particles with sufficiently small inertia can be treated as passive species without the possibility of slippage to air (Murakami et al. 1992; Zhao and Wu 2005) .

A potential way is to use the air emitted from a SARS patient as the reference indicator. If we define the equivalent SARS virus concentration in air emitted from a patient's mouth as 1, the relative concentration of the virus in the air can then be described as the number of times of dilution of the emitted air. For instance, if the air emitted from a SARS patient is diluted by 10000 times using clean air, the equivalent concentration will be one over ten thousand, or 100 ppm. The average rate of a seated person's breathing air is reported to be between 0.27 and 0.33 m 3 /h, with large variation due to physiological or activity conditions. In this study, we used 0.3 m 3 /h as the reference breathing rate given that SARS patients were typically in a reclined position in the hospital and experiencing breathing difficulties. Thus, if a room with a single SARS patient is ventilated with 3000 m 3 /h of fresh air, the equivalent concentration of the SARS virus in the room's air will be 10000 times dilution, or 100 ppm. The following quantitative analysis of virus concentration is based on this assumption.",

Assuming that the inlet air through the fan is totally clean, the air dilution in the emergency patient room was 2700 to 6 m 3 /h (20 patients), which translates into roughly 450 times dilution. This is considerably lower than the 1000 or 2000 times dilution in the infection case described above. The emergency patient room had a high risk of SARS cross-infection.

The hospital was involved in SARS patient care between February 16 and April 1, 2003. Figure 11 illustrates the floor plan of the hospital's 6th floor, where the physicians, nurses and patients involved in the SARS outbreak were housed during that period. The north side rooms are patient rooms with one SARS patient per room. The south side rooms are offices and foyers for the physicians and nurses. It was confirmed that all windows and doors were fully open during the working day throughout that period. At that time, preventative equipment against SARS was not well developed and the only protection for physicians and nurses was the use of twelve-layer masks. Still, no health care worker became infected. It should be noted that there were 74 SARS patients hospitalized in the patient rooms during that period, and 15 physicians and 35 nurses on call during that time. This means that the offices and foyers were safe places even though they were connected to the SARS patients' rooms by the hospital corridor. To reproduce this case, the measured wind speed and direction data between February 16 and April 1, 2003 were obtained from the local metrological office and applied as the simulation boundary conditions (Table 1) . A multi-zone model was used to simulate the ventilation rate and direction under different wind speeds and directions (Fig. 12) . The results show that the highest equivalent virus consistence was no greater than 170 ppm and that, during most of that period, the consistence was between 30 to 80 ppm.

Under conditions where the mean value of the exhaust rate is 0.3 m 3 /h per person and dilution with clean air is less than 1000 times, the risk of infection would be very high. In contrast, a dilution rate is higher than 10000 times results in a low risk of infection risk. More research is needed, however, to better understand what happens when the dilution rate falls between 1000 and 10000 times. Infection is a very complex process and involves many factors, so establishing a clear boundary between safe and dangerous dilution rates would be challenging. Most importantly, our results show that reproducing actual infective and non-infective cases with simulation tools is a valid method for determining safe ventilation rates for the purpose of maintaining an infection-free building environment.
