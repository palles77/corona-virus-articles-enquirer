            "text": "We report an RNA-negative, temperature-sensitive (ts) mutant of Murine hepatitis virus, Bristol ts31 (MHV-Brts31), that defines a new complementation group within the MHV replicase gene locus. MHV-Brts31 has near-normal levels of RNA synthesis at the permissive temperature of 33\u00b0C but is unable to synthesize viral RNA when the infection is initiated and maintained at the nonpermissive temperature of 39.5\u00b0C. Sequence analysis of MHV-Brts31 RNA indicated that a single G-to-A transition at codon 1307 in open reading frame 1a, which results in a replacement of methionine-475 with isoleucine in nonstructural protein 3 (nsp3), was responsible for the ts phenotype. This conclusion was confirmed using a vaccinia virus-based reverse genetics system to produce a recombinant virus, Bristol tsc31 (MHV-Brtsc31), which has the same RNA-negative ts phenotype and complementation profile as those of MHV-Brts31. The analysis of protein synthesis in virusinfected cells showed that, at the nonpermissive temperature, MHV-Brtsc31 was not able to proteolytically process either p150, the precursor polypeptide of the replicase nonstructural proteins nsp4 to nsp10, or the replicase polyprotein pp1ab to produce nsp12. The processing of replicase polyprotein pp1a in the region of nsp1 to nsp3 was not affected. Transmission electron microscopy showed that, compared to revertant virus, the number of double-membrane vesicles in MHV-Brts31-infected cells is reduced at the nonpermissive temperature. These results identify a new cistron in the MHV replicase gene locus and show that nsp3 has an essential role in the assembly of a functional MHV replication-transcription complex.",

            "text": "Coronaviruses are positive-stranded RNA viruses with genomes ranging in size from 27 to 32 kb. Approximately twothirds of the genome encodes proteins that are involved in viral RNA synthesis. The majority of these proteins are encoded in two 5\u0408-proximal, overlapping open reading frames (ORFs), ORF1a and ORF1b, and are translated as polyproteins, pp1a and pp1ab, which are then processed by virus-encoded proteinases into 16 nonstructural proteins (nsp's): nsp1 to nsp11, encoded in ORF1a, and nsp12 to nsp16, encoded in ORF1b. The translation products of ORF1a and ORF1ab, together with other viral proteins (41, 60) and, possibly, cellular proteins, assemble into replication-transcription complexes (RTCs) responsible for the synthesis of genome-sized RNA and a set of 3\u0408-coterminal subgenome-sized mRNAs. The subgenomesized mRNAs are produced by an unusual mechanism that involves discontinuous transcription during negative-strand RNA synthesis (for recent reviews, see references 39 and 43) .",

            "text": "The coronavirus RTCs accumulate at perinuclear regions and are associated with a network of endoplasmic reticulum-derived, modified membranes (16, 20, 28) . The interconnected structures within this network are known as convoluted membranes (CMs) and double-membrane vesicles (DMVs). Both structures are associated with viral replicase proteins and double-stranded RNA (16, 28, 53) , but it is not yet entirely clear if both are the sites of active RNA synthesis. Hydrophobic transmembrane domains are present in nsp3, nsp4, and nsp6 and likely serve to anchor the nascent pp1a/pp1ab polyproteins to membranes during the first steps of RTC formation (1, 6, 16, 21, 26, (32) (33) (34) 54) . A variety of studies suggest that most, if not all, coronavirus nsp's are recruited to the viral RTCs (16, 21, 35, 45) , and a complex and dynamic pattern of interactions between intermediate and mature RTC proteins is thought to play a role in the regulation of viral RNA synthesis. Crystallographic analysis of individual and oligomeric complexes of coronavirus nsp's, as well as studies involving Saccharomyces cerevisiae two-hybrid, coimmunoprecipitation, cosedimentation, and cross-linking analysis (3, 47, 48, 55, 56) , provides insights into some of the structural aspects of these RTC interactions.",

Clearly, some of these activities are common to many RNA viruses and are directly related to the biogenesis of the RTC and viral RNA synthesis. However, others (e.g., the endoribo-nuclease of nsp15) are unique to coronaviruses or viruses closely related to them (23) and may be involved in unusual activities that are related to the size of the coronavirus genome or virus-host interactions (15) . Also, the finding that 2\u0408-Oribose-methylated RNA substrates are resistant to cleavage by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) endoribonuclease indicates that there may be functional links between different nsp's: for example, the endonuclease activity of nsp15 and the S-adenosylmethionine-dependent 2\u0408-O-methyltransferase activity of nsp16 (23) .",

We have recently reported a genetic and functional analysis of a panel of MHV ts mutants that are unable to synthesize viral RNA when the infection is initiated and maintained at the nonpermissive temperature, i.e., mutants with an RNA-negative phenotype. One of the main conclusions of this analysis is that mutations in the nsp12, nsp14, and nsp16 proteins define distinct cistrons (cistrons II, IV, and VI) while mutations in the nsp4, nsp5, and nsp10 proteins define a single cistron (cistron I). On the basis of these results, we have predicted that most of the ORF1a gene products (more specifically, nsp4 to nsp10) function as a polyprotein before cleavage into individual polypeptides, or they are as-sembled into the RTC and are then cleaved, with a gain of function expressed in individual polypeptides. In contrast, the ORF1b-encoded nsp's (nsp12 to nsp16) are diffusible and assemble and function in viral RNA synthesis after cleavage from pp1ab. We have also suggested that replicase polyprotein processing may have an important role in regulating the different functions associated with the coronavirus RTC: for example, minus-and plus-strand RNA synthesis and the aging of the active complex (40) .",

However, there are still many unanswered questions. For example, it has not been shown that, as we predict, the nsp6, nsp7, nsp8, and nsp9 proteins function in cis, together with nsp4, nsp5, and nsp10. To do this, it will be necessary to find MHV RNA-negative ts mutants with causal mutations in the relevant proteins and to complement them with existing mutants. Similarly, our model leaves open the question of whether or not other ORF1a-encoded proteins will be able to complement defects in cistron I mutants. As mentioned above, it is known that particular domains of nsp1 and nsp3 are not essential for virus replication, but it is, of course, still possible that these proteins do have functions in RNA synthesis. Finally, the classical genetic approach can be further exploited to provide mechanistic insights into the functional inactivation of nsp's at the nonpermissive temperature. For example, a recent biochemical analysis of the MHV RNAnegative mutant LA ts6 has suggested that nsp10 acts as a regulatory cofactor of nsp5 proteinase activity (9) . It would be interesting to investigate the polyprotein processing pattern of additional mutants in order to establish whether similar interactions exist between other proteins encoded in the MHV replicase gene locus.",

To analyze the phenotype of MHV-Brts31 in more detail, we determined first the EOP of a high-titer (passage 2) virus stock. At 33\u00b0C, the stock had a titer of 1 \u03eb 10 8 PFU/ml, and at 39.5\u00b0C, the stock had a titer of 1.5 \u03eb 10 3 PFU/ml, which is an EOP of 1.5 \u03eb 10 \u03ea5 . This value is indicative of a single point mutation. Of the plaques that formed at the nonpermissive temperature, all that we tested were no longer ts and are, therefore, revertants. One of these revertants was designated MHV-Br31R1. The plaque size and morphology of MHV-Brts31 and MHV-Br31R1 at 33\u00b0C and of MHV-Br31R1 at 39.5\u00b0C were identical to those of the parental MHV-A59 (Fig. 1A, left panel) .

Figure 2A higher temperature. We have also confirmed that the kinetics and levels of virus RNA synthesis in MHV-Brts31-infected cells maintained at the nonpermissive temperature cannot be distinguished from those of mock-infected cells and that cells infected with MHV-Br31R1 and MHV-A59 are indistinguishable in terms of virus RNA synthesis at the permissive temperature (data not shown). These results show that MHV-Brts31 has near-normal levels of total RNA synthesis at the permissive temperature. They also suggest that MHV-Br31R1 is most likely to be a true revertant. To show definitively whether or not the kinetics and levels of viral RNA synthesis in MHV-Brts31-infected cells at the permissive temperature are identical to those of MHV-A59-infected cells will require a more detailed analysis, possibly using different multiplicities of infection and a more accurate measure of RNA levels, e.g., quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR). A major advantage of using ts mutants is that they can be analyzed by temperature shift protocols, i.e., by allowing them to gain function at the permissive temperature, shifting them to the nonpermissive temperature, and then determining if the function is lost. Thus, we determined the effect of temperature shift on the levels of total viral RNA synthesis in MHV-Brts31and MHV-Br31R1-infected 17Cl-1 cells. To do this, infections were initiated at 33\u00b0C and infected cells were incubated until RNA synthesis reached about 20% of the maximum rate, which is approximately 4 to 5 h postinfection. At this time, one set of cells were pulse-labeled with [ 3 H]uridine in the presence of actinomycin D. Another set of virus-infected cells were shifted to 39.5\u00b0C and pulse-labeled for 30 min at 0 and 30 min after shifting to the nonpermissive temperature. The cells were pulse-labeled with [ 3 H]uridine in the presence of actinomycin D and in the presence or absence of 100 g/ml of cycloheximide.

The pulse-labeling prior to temperature shift shows again that MHV-Brts31-and MHV-BR31R1-infected cells have comparable levels of RNA synthesis. After temperature shift, total RNA synthesis increased in MHV-Br31R1-infected cells in the absence of cycloheximide. This reflects the amplification of virus RTCs and the increased metabolic rate at higher temperatures. In the presence of cycloheximide, the activity fails to increase, but after shift, significant activity remains. We conclude that the MHV-Br31R1 replicase-transcriptase activity formed before temperature shift is relatively resistant to higher temperature. In MHV-Brts31-infected cells, there is also significant RNA synthesis activity after temperature shift, irrespective of the presence or absence of cycloheximide. We interpret this to mean that for MHV-Brts31, preexisting complexes are also relatively resistant and continue to synthesize plus-strand RNA at the nonpermissive temperature. To decide whether or not RTCs in MHV-Brts31-infected cells are able to synthesize minus-strand RNA at the nonpermissive temperature will require further experiments.",

            "text": "In order to confirm that G 4131 to A is the mutation responsible for the ts phenotype of MHV-Brts31, we used a vaccinia virus-based reverse genetics system to produce a recombinant virus, MHV-Brtsc31, that has a single G-to-A nucleotide exchange at position 4131 compared to the parental recombinant MHV-A59, which we call MHV-inf-1. MHV-Brtsc31 was rescued and plaque purified three times at 33\u00b0C, and a passage 2 virus stock was obtained. Sequence analysis of RNA from this stock of virus confirmed the presence of the G 4131 -to-A mutation (data not shown). At 33\u00b0C, the MHV-Brtsc31 stock had a titer of 6 \u03eb 10 8 PFU/ml, and at 39.5\u00b0C, the stock had a titer of 1.0 \u03eb 10 4 PFU/ml, which is an EOP of 1.7 \u03eb 10 \u03ea5 . MHV-Brtsc31 also failed to form plaques at 37\u00b0C (Fig. 1A, right  panel) . One of the plaques that formed in cells infected with MHV-Brtsc31 and maintained at the nonpermissive temperature of 39.5\u00b0C was picked and designated MHV-Br31cR1. The plaque size and morphology of MHV-Brtsc31 and MHV-Br31cR1 at 33\u00b0C and those of MHV-Br31cR1 at 39.5\u00b0C were identical to those of the parental MHV-inf-1 (Fig. 1A, right  panel) . Sequence analysis of RNA isolated from 17Cl-1 cells infected with a passage 2 stock of MHV-Br31cR1 showed that it was, indeed, a true revertant (data not shown). Next, we determined the amounts of viral RNA synthesized in cells infected with MHV-inf-1 and MHV-Brtsc31 and maintained at the permissive and nonpermissive temperatures of 33\u00b0C and 39.5\u00b0C, respectively. Figure 1C shows that at 33\u00b0C both viruses produce genome-sized and subgenome-sized virus RNA in the expected ratios. At the nonpermissive temperature of 39.5\u00b0C, MHV-Brtsc31 did not synthesize a detectable level of RNA. Finally, we repeated the same complementation analysis described above using MHV-Brtsc31 (Table 1) . Again, the ts mutant virus was able to complement all of the mutant viruses tested from each complementation group, with complementation indices (CI) of between 27 and 717. Taken together, these results confirm that a single G 4131 -to-A mutation is responsible for the ts phenotype of MHV-Brts31, conclusively locate cistron 0 in ORF1a, and show that nsp3 has, at least, one essential role in MHV RNA synthesis.",

To see if the replacement of methionine-475 with isoleucine in nsp3 of MHV-Brtsc31 has any effect on pp1ab processing, we repeated the experiment described above using an antiserum specific for nsp12, the viral RdRp. The results shown in Fig. 5 lead us to conclude that the processing of nsp12 is also impaired at the nonpermissive temperature compared to the permissive temperature in cells infected with MHV-Brtsc31 but not in MHV-Br31cR1-infected cells (Fig. 5 , lanes 2 and 4 and lanes 6 and 8). As a control, we once again demonstrated the impaired processing of nsp5 in MHV-Brtsc31-infected cells at the nonpermissive temperature (Fig.  5, lanes 1 and 3 and lanes 5 and 7) . TEM analysis of MHV-infected cells reveals that DMVs can be visualized as dark-ringed vesicles in the cytoplasm adjacent to the nucleus (16) . In cells infected with MHV-Br31R1, the typical accumulation of DMV structures (indicated by arrows) was evident after incubation at the permissive (Fig. 6A) and nonpermissive (Fig. 6B ) temperatures, with an increased number of DMVs in the cells incubated at 39.5\u00b0C. In contrast, we found that although the number of DMVs in MHV-Brts31infected cells incubated at the permissive temperature (Fig.  6C ) was similar to the number found in revertant virus-infected cells, the number of DMVs in MHV-Brts31-infected cells that had been shifted to the nonpermissive temperature was reduced ( Fig. 6D and F) . We also noted a small number of aberrant vesicles at the nonpermissive temperature (indicated by asterisks in Fig. 6D and F) that stained with uranyl acetate and Reynolds' lead citrate but do not have the typical doublemembrane morphology. Further work will be necessary to determine if these are possibly residual DMVs.",

This led us to the hypothesis that each of the five MHV ORF1b cleavage products (nsp12 to nsp16) may represent distinct cistrons but that the majority of the ORF1a cleavage products will function as a single cistron.

Furthermore, the identification of the mutation responsible for the ts phenotype of MHV-Brts31 (G 4131 to A) shows that cistron 0 encompasses, at least, the region encoding nsp3. For a number of reasons, we suggest that cistron 0 will not extend beyond the coding region of nsp3. First, as mentioned above, extensive deletion of sequences encoding the carboxyl region of nsp1 or, indeed, the entire coding region of nsp2 has an attenuating effect but is not lethal for MHV replication (13, 18) . Second, although it has been shown that an RNA stemloop in the bovine coronavirus (BCoV) 5\u0408 proximal coding region of nsp1 is essential for RNA replication (4) (which would explain the lethality of deleting the entire nsp1 coding region), the majority of evidence suggests that the coronavirus nsp1 protein primarily has a role in the virus-host interaction (8, 24, 25, 29) or regulatory, rather than essential, functions in RNA synthesis (19) . Although the possibility that other ORF1a-or ORF1b-encoded nsp's (i.e., nsp6, nsp7, nsp8, nsp9, nsp11, nsp13, or nsp15) could fall into the same complementation group as MHV-Brts31 cannot be ruled out, it would, in our opinion, be difficult to reconcile this with our current view of MHV replicase gene expression and function.",

First, the ts lesion of MHV-Brtsc31 is affecting nsp5-mediated processing of pp1a and pp1ab, specifically, the processing of p150 to generate nsp4, nsp5, and nsp8 and the processing of pp1ab to generate nsp12. However, there is no effect on the processing of the replicase polyproteins to produce nsp1, nsp2, and nsp3. We interpret this to mean one of two things. Either there is an interaction between nsp3 and another component of the RTC, which is necessary to facilitate nsp5-mediated polyprotein processing, or the normal structure or function of nsp3 is needed to provide pp1a/pp1ab substrates upon which nsp5 can act. In this respect, the precedent for protein-protein interactions within the coronavirus RTC that result in a modification of nsp5 activity has been given by Donaldson et al. (9) , who have suggested that nsp10 may act as a cofactor for 3CLpro-mediated processing.",

A quantitative analysis of DMV numbers in cells infected with MHV-Brts31, together with experiments to determine the turnover rate of DMV structures in MHV-A59-infected cells, will be needed to determine the precise defect in DMV biogenesis. However, our data suggest that preformed RTCs are able to continue plus-strand RNA synthesis at the nonpermissive temperature, and it seems more likely that the failure to correctly process the replicase polyproteins would affect assembly rather than stability of the RTC. On the other hand, an earlier analysis of cells infected with the RNA-negative, ts mutant MHV-Albts6 (6) has shown that DMV formation and replicase polyprotein processing are not always linked. In this case, DMV formation was severely impaired even though replicase polyprotein processing appeared to be normal. The finding that both MHV-Brts31 and MHV-Albts6 fail to accumulate DMVs at the nonpermissive temperature is consistent with the idea that DMVs either are required for coronavirus RNA synthesis or are generated as a result of viral RNA synthesis.",

In this context, it is important to note that the data do not allow us to discern whether the phenotypic changes that we observe are directly or indirectly related to the causal mutation. The M475I mutation, which is located, essentially, at the junction of the PLP1 and X domains of nsp3, could lead to multiple effects that may then be separately related to the different phenotypic manifestations. Indeed, Graham and Denison (17) have shown that recombinant MHV mutants with changes in the nsp1-to-nsp3 protein coding region may have a variety of different phenotypes with respect to replicase polyprotein processing, replication, and RNA synthesis.",

            "text": "In general, we can offer three possible ways in which the M475I mutation may exert its effect. First, it is possible that one or more of the enzymatic activities associated with nsp3 are rendered inactive at the nonpermissive temperature. For a number of reasons, we consider this the least likely explanation. For example, we consider it unlikely that inactivation of PLP1 activity is responsible for the phenotype of MHV-Brts31 (or MHV-Brtsc31). Our data do not provide any evidence for a defect in nsp1, nsp2, and nsp3 processing, and previous studies have shown that MHV PLP1 activity is not essential for virus replication in cell culture (17) . Nevertheless, mutants of this sort are highly impaired on recovery and we cannot rule out that the inactivation of PLP1 may somehow be involved. Similarly, although it has been shown that the HCoV-229E PLP2 activity is essential for replication (58), our results do not indicate any defect in this activity at the nonpermissive temperature in MHV-Brtsc31-infected cells. A second type of function associated with nsp3 is the ADP-ribose 1\u0409-phosphatase and poly(ADP-ribose) binding activities of the X domain. Again, we consider it unlikely that inactivation of one or both of these activities can account for the phenotype of MHV-Brts31 because it has been shown previously that mutation of the active site of the HCoV-229E nsp3 X domain has no significant effect on virus RNA synthesis (36) . The inactivation of nsp3-associated deubiquitination activity (57) and other, as-yet-unidentified enzymatic activities remains a possibility.",

            "text": "A second and perhaps more likely explanation is that, at the nonpermissive temperature, interactions between nsp3 and cellular membranes are compromised. Although there is still some uncertainty, the current model of MHV nsp3 topology predicts at least 2 transmembrane helices (26, 31, 32) . This would place the bulk of nsp3 on the same membrane face occupied by nsp5 and the nsp12 to nsp16 proteins processed from pp1ab. Kanjanahaluethai et al. (26) recently showed that removing the nsp3 transmembrane domain abolished PLP2 activity, presumably by preventing the interaction of PLP2 with its substrate. If the MHV-Brts31/MHV-Brtsc31 nsp3 protein is no longer stably inserted into the cellular membrane at the nonpermissive temperature, then this could compromise the integrity of the whole replicase-transcriptase complex. The same might be true if the replacement of methionine-475 with isoleucine in nsp3 had a global effect upon the structure of nsp3, or even the pp1a and pp1ab polyproteins as a whole. Our current view of nsp3 as a large protein with a functional and structural domain architecture might argue against a global effect (31) , and the position of this substitution, which is essentially predicted to be in a flexible region separating conserved functional domains, would be more consistent with the idea that intramolecular nsp3 domain interactions are affected at the nonpermissive temperature.",

This could be manifested as an inability to assemble new complexes or as the assembly of a nonfunctional complex. Putative metal-binding domains are located in the PLP, ZF, and Y domains of the MHV nsp3, and they may represent zinc-finger motifs that are involved in the recognition of other protein components of the RTC. The MHV nsp3 protein also contains a putative nucleic acid-binding domain. Neuman et al. (31) have shown that the corresponding SARS-coronavirus NAB domain of nsp3 has both single-stranded nucleic acid-binding activity and doublestranded unwinding activity, and they suggest that these activities are consistent with a nucleic acid chaperone function. It is easy to see how the disruption of MHV nsp3 protein-protein or nsp3 protein-RNA interactions could prevent the assembly of a functional RTC and result in the ts phenotype that we observe for MHV-Brts31 and MHV-Brtsc31.",

The MHV replicase gene comprises two ORFs, ORF1a and ORF1b, connected by a (\u03ea1) ribosomal frameshift, which encode the viral replicase polyproteins. The replicase polyproteins are processed by papain-like cysteine protease activities 1 and 2 (PLP1 and PLP2, respectively, in nsp3) and the 3C-like cysteine protease activity (3CLpro in nsp5) to generate intermediates and mature nonstructural proteins (nsp's), which assemble to generate functional replication-transcription complexes. The site of the ts lesion in the MHV-Brts31 nsp3 open reading frame is indicated by the star. Domains recognized by the polyclonal antibodies used in the immunoprecipitation assays are indicated by black bars. FIG. 4.
