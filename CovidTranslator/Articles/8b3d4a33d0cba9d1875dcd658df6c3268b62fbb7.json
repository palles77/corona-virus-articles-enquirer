The outbreak in Northern Italy demonstrates that it is fundamental to contain the virus' spread at a very early stage of diffusion. At later stages, no containment measure, even if strict, can prevent the saturation of the hospitals and of the intensive care units in any country. Here we show that it is possible to predict when the intensive care units will saturate, within a few days from the first cases of COVID-19 intensive care patients. Using early counts of intensive care patients, we predict the saturation for Lombardy, Italy. Governments should use the Italian precursor to control the outbreak of COVID-19 and prevent the saturation of their intensive care units to protect their population.",

To avoid the saturation of the ICUs, governments need to impose strong containment measures, such as lockdown of the population. Acting early is paramount: after containments measures are taken, the number of cases still grows exponentially for at least ten days, due to infections contracted before the measures (2). The later these containment measures are taken, the stronger these measures need to be to contain diffusion of COVID-19, and could be anyways insufficient to avoid the catastrophic collapse of the NHS. For example, Japan and Singapore were able to avoid a lockdown of the population, because the governments implemented a range of measures at a very early stage of the outbreak (Fig. 1 ).",

This repository contains daily counts of confirmed cases, hospitalized patients, ICU patients, and deceased patients, at the national and regional level (Fig. 3 ). This repository represents an important and unique source of information for other countries that the pandemic will reach. The number of ICU patients represents a more robust information compared to the number of infected people, which is subject to an under-reporting. The number of infected people strongly depends on the number of performed tests and on the strategy of sampling of the population (e.g. only symptomatic people, random people). Testing capability and strategy might largely vary among different countries, while ICU patients count is a routine operation performed by all NHSs. ICU counts are more reliable also compared to deaths counts, since most patients dying with COVID-19 have comorbidities and ascertaining that COVID-19 was the primary cause of death can be complicated.

We focus on Lombardy region. The number of ICU patients in the region grew exponentially for the first ten days, starting from February 24 th , and then slowed down as it reached the number of available ICU beds. We can predict the date at which the ICU beds became saturated by performing a linear regression of the logarithm of the number of ICU patients, starting from the first four datapoints (Fig. 4) . This result shows that monitoring the ICUs statistics at the beginning of the epidemic allows countries to assess the date of possible saturation of the ICU beds early on. Monitoring the ICUs early in the outbreak is paramount: Lombardy in Italy has one the best NHS in the World (6,7), therefore most countries will face the saturation of their ICU beds at earlier stages of the outbreak. It is worth to note that several factors can affect the time to saturate the ICU beds. In particular, the saturation time depends on the connectivity of the population: the more people are connected within a region, the faster the infection diffuses (8) . Therefore, the risk of ICUs saturation is higher for the most developed and connected regions, and Lombardy is the most connected region of Italy. Moreover, if a lock down measure is imposed, the saturation time depends on the incubation time of the disease and on the degree of adherence of the population to the lockdown.",

Specifically, we expect the effect on the number of ICU patients to appear within about two weeks (i.e. the maximum incubation time), and on the number of deaths to appear in about three weeks (i.e. the time from infection to death) (2) . At the current moment, 15 days have passed from the national lockdown, so we expect to see an effect only on the number of ICU patients. Because of the saturation of the ICUs in several Italian regions, the number of ICU patients in Italy currently underestimates the number of cases that would require intensive care. Therefore, we analyze the data of Italy excluding the regions where the ICUs have saturated. This leaves us with 15 of the 20 regions and excludes about 28% of the Italian population. We find that the recent growth of ICU patients is consistent with a linear growth, rather than an exponential growth, suggesting that the lockdown measures have effectively reduced the spread of the infection (Fig.   6 ), as it has been for Hubei region (1). Specifically, we can obtain a very good fit of the data using an exponential curve (ICU patients(t) \u221d exp[r t], t = days), up to five days after the lockdown (equal to the median incubation time of COVID-19 (9)) and a line (ICU patients(t) \u221d b t, t = days) for later datapoints. the author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.",

The saturation of the ICUs in many Italian regions suggests that containment measures were taken too late. Using Italy as a precursor, other countries should impose these confinement measures at earlier stages of the outbreak to be able to protect their population from COVID-19. We show that countries can predict the date of saturation of their ICUs early on, as soon as an exponential growth of intensive care patients is observed, as it was in Lombardy region. The Italian case demonstrates that a national lockdown is effective in reducing the growth of ICU patients. The complete saturation of ICUs, thus the collapse of a NHS, would be a catastrophe that would affect the entire population of a nation. People would die if, for any reason, intensive care would be needed : no matter being positive or negative to COVID-19, the age, the richness, or the wellness of the patient.",

The Italian government immediately implemented several measures to increase the number of available ICU beds, for example postponing non-essential surgical operations and purchasing mechanical ventilators for new ICUs, and to increase medical support, for example by recalling retired doctors. Yet, these measures offer what we call a linear response, which is not sufficient to face an exponential growth of ICU beds demand. The Italian government implemented also a series of measures to slow down the diffusion of the virus. Schools and universities were closed in Lombardy on February 26 th , and in rest of Italy on March 5 th . On March 8 th , Lombardy region ordered a lockdown of the populations (Decreto del Presidente del Consiglio dei Ministri 8 Marzo 2020). On the following day, the lockdown was extended to the entire nation. In Lombardy and in Italy, nurses, doctors and health-care professionals have fought with incredible strength, acting as war heroes in dark times. However, the ICUs rapidly saturated by COVID-19 ICU patients in Lombardy region (Fig. 4) and subsequently in other regions (Fig. 5). On March 21 st , the Italian government imposed a full lockdown of the nation, closing off all the non-essential companies and manufacturing plants. All rights reserved.

The dotted blue line is the linear regression of the first six orange datapoints. The day of saturation can be predicted by linear regression, fitting the logarithm of the number of ICU patients, at early stages of the epidemic: the magenta rectangle shows the predicted temporal range for the saturation of 50% of the ICU beds; the extremes of the range are obtained by fitting the first four (blue triangle) and nine orange datapoints. To avoid incurring in the ICUs saturation, an anticipated lockdown would have been necessary, as indicated by the blue triangle.
