Safeguarding the lives of millions of pilgrims is the cardinal duty and honor of the Custodian of the Two Holy Cities in Islam.

Protecting the lives of pilgrims during Hajj however is not only a matter of governing national policy for the KSA and its monarch, but a divinely ordained duty. The stakes for protecting Hajj are therefore extremely high, not only in scale but also in terms of the religious mandate.",

While alcohol is forbidden for ingestion to the observing Muslim, it is permitted for all medical purposes including as both a vehicle for medications and in topical form as alcohol hand hygiene agents. The KSA has been very far sighted in issuing religious fatwahs for such medical practices for over two decades with KSA's scholars issuing fatwas to reassure Muslim patients and the wider public of the acceptability of the use of alcohol hand rub for the Muslim without violating any principles of Islam [15] .

Sometimes they are hired from outside the country, many international volunteer doctors and other personnel seek to serve the 'guests of god'. These workers are also at risk should Hajj be allowed to continue in the face of an accelerating COVID-19 outbreak. The impact would be two-fold. Not only of more health care personnel exposed to active disease with the threat of severe infection in localized pockets and then transmission to others seeking medical care, but also a twofold burden on the HCWs-caring for patients afflicted by the outbreak or compromised by it somehow and managing fellow colleagues sickened by the intensification of exposure. The semi-permanent health services at Hajj are already siphoning off critical healthcare staff from their usual responsibilities throughout the KSA managing a population of close to 32 million including 10 million expatriates. In a scenario with colleagues falling ill and on some occasions dying, the wider Saudi healthcare system could be singularly more impacted by the COVID-19 crisis during Hajj than any other healthcare workforce yet to date.

While that decision will be heartbreaking for individual Muslims and both spiritually and economically damaging for the Kingdom, solace will be obtained in knowing the Muslim majority world can contribute to the wellbeing of humanity. Further, the Kingdom has the opportunity to lead the world in acknowledging that even the most beloved and long-awaited mass gathering events including the Olympics must sometimes be suspended, postponed or canceled. Hajj planners frequently consult on the management of mass gatherings including the US inauguration, the Olympics and the World Cup. Their preemptive management of the coronavirus crisis in the setting of the world's largest and most diverse mass gathering is being closely followed and will be a blueprint for other mass gatherings soon following.",
