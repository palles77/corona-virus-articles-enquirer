            "text": "Myeloid differentiation factor 88 (MyD88) is a key adaptor molecule in the interleukin-1 (IL-1) and IL-18 Toll-like receptor signaling pathway. Because it is present in dental follicle (DF) cells in vitro, the purpose of this study was to determine its chronological expression in vivo, as well as its possible role in osteoclastogenesis and tooth eruption. An oligo DNA microarray was used to determine gene expression of MyD88 in vivo in the DFs from the first mandibular molars of postnatal rats from days 1-11. The results showed that MyD88 was expressed maximally at day 3. Using siRNA to knock down MyD88 expression in the DF cells also reduced the gene expression of nuclear factor-kappa B-1 (NFKB1) and monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 (MCP-1). IL-1\u03b1 up-regulated the expression of NFKB1, MCP-1 and receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa B ligand (RANKL), but knockdown of MyD88 nullified this IL-1\u03b1 effect. Conditioned medium from DF cells with MyD88 knocked down reduced chemotactic activity for mononuclear cells and reduced osteoclastogenesis as opposed to controls. In conclusion, the maximal expression of MyD88 at day 3 in the DF may contribute to the major burst of osteoclastogenesis needed for eruption by up-regulating MCP-1 and RANKL expression.",

            "text": "Osteoclastogenesis and subsequent alveolar bone resorption are essential for creating a pathway for the tooth to erupt (1) . For the eruption of the first mandibular molars of rats, mononuclear cells (osteoclast precursors) are recruited into the dental follicle (DF), a loose connective tissue sac that surrounds the unerupted tooth, and differentiate into osteoclasts (2) . It has been shown that the recruitment of mononuclear cells into the DF is mediated by monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) and colony-stimulating factor-1 (CSF-1), which are maximally expressed by the DF at day 3 postnatally and secreted by the DF cells (3) (4) (5) . Our recent study demonstrated that endothelial monocyte-activating polypeptide II (EMAP-II) also contributes to this recruitment (6) . Moreover, a crucial molecule for osteoclastogenesis signaling, receptor activator of nuclear factor-kappa B ligand (RANKL), is expressed in the DF (7) . At this time (day 3), osteoprotegerin (OPG), an osteoclastogenesis inhibitor in the DF, is down-regulated by CSF-1 (8) . Another osteoclastogenesis inhibitor, secreted frizzled-related protein-1 (SFRP-1), also is downregulated in the DF at this time (9) . With RANKL presence in the DF, a decrease in osteoclastogenesis inhibitors at day 3 provides a favorable microenvironment to promote osteoclastogenesis.",

MyD88-deficient mice had no response to IL-1\u03b2 stimulation for elevating TNF-\u03b1 and IL-6 expression (15) . Interferon \u03b3 (INF\u03b3) production in response to IL-18 stimulation also was abrogated (15) . MyD88 also contributes to an innate immune response to invasion of bacteria, yeasts and viruses (10) . Studies from the MyD88-deficient mice have shown that MyD88 is essential for induction of interferon \u03b1 (INF\u03b1) and interferon \u03b2 (INF\u03b2) by forming a complex with interferon regulatory factor 7 (IRF-7) and interferon regulatory factor 1 (IRF-1) respectively (16, 17) . Thus, loss of MyD88 impacts type I interferon production, and results in a weak immune response against pathogens, along with the abolished or greatly suppressed expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines (18) (19) (20) . Consequently, infections by bacteria, viruses and parasites were lethal to MyD88-deficient mice (20) (21) (22) . Finally, MyD88 is involved in injury healing, likely through recruitment of leukocytes into the injured area; e.g., in MyD88-deficient mice recruitment of leukocytes into the entorhinal cortex (EC) after brain injury (23) was reduced.",

Knocking down MyD88 expression reduced the up-regulation of MCP-1 expression by IL-1\u03b1 such that the MCP-1 expression in vitro with MyD88 knocked down was only 25% of its IL-1\u03b1 up-regulated level in the absence of a knockdown (Fig. 5B) . In vivo, IL-1\u03b1 is maximally expressed early in the stellate reticulum, a tissue adjacent to the DF (28) . In this study, we found that MyD88 expression was maximal early (day 3) in vivo (Fig. 1A) , and IL-1\u03b1 up-regulated its expression in vitro (Fig. 2) . Therefore, it is possible that IL-1\u03b1 from the stellate reticulum contributes to the up-regulation of MyD88 at day 3. The up-regulation of MyD88 also may be the mechanism by which IL-1\u03b1 enhances NFKB1 expression in the DF cells because over-expression of MyD88 in 293T cells results in activation of NF-\u03baB signaling in the absence of exogenous stimuli such as IL-1\u03b1 and TNF-\u03b1 (12) .",

Moreover, the increase in chemotaxis of the medium of DF cells treated with IL-1\u03b1 was negated by MyD88 knockdown. Thus, the reduction in MCP-1 gene expression in the DF cells that is brought about by MyD88 knockdown is reflected in reduced chemotaxis for osteoclast precursors. That the reduction is not 100% is because other chemotactic molecules, such as CSF-1 (4) or EMAP-II (6) also are produced by the DF cells. Thus, as in many other instances of development, there is a redundancy of function among different molecules to bring about a critical developmental event.",

RANKL is expressed in the DF, and is up-regulated in vitro by IL-1\u03b1, TNF-\u03b1 and TGF-\u03b2 (7). By activating NF-\u03baB pathways, RANKL sequentially activates c-Fos and nuclear factor of activated T cells c1 (NFATc1), leading to osteoclastogenesis (34) . In our study, NFKB1 was shown to be partially dependent on MyD88 (Fig. 3A) in the DF cells. However, osteoclast precursors from MyD88-deficient mice similarly differentiated into osteoclasts as compared to those from wild type mice (24) , suggesting that MyD88 may not be directly involved in osteoclastogenesis or that a MyD88independent NF-\u03baB signaling may exist in osteoclast precursors. Moreover, our study also showed that after MyD88 was knocked down, IL-1\u03b1 enhanced RANKL expression (5.8 times) was nullified (Fig. 5C) , indicating that MyD88 is essential to up-regulation of RANKL in response to IL-1\u03b1 stimulation. Similar results have been found in osteoblasts from MyD88-deficient mice showing that RANKL expression had no response to stimulation by LPS, diacyl lipopeptide or IL-1a (24) . Thus, it appears that MyD88 is involved in osteoclastogenesis by up-regulating RANKL in osteoblasts or DF cells in response to IL-1\u03b1 stimulation, but MyD88 does not directly affect osteoclast precursors. Moreover, as seen in Fig. 5 , MyD88 knockdown does not result in a reduced RANKL expression; i.e., it does not affect the base level of RANKL, but it does inhibit the upregulation by IL-1\u03b1.",

As NF-\u03baB protein has been shown to bind to the promoter region of the MCP-1 gene (35) , it is likely that the down-regulation of MCP-1 expression in the DF cells was due to NFKB1 reduction following MyD88 knockdown. This is supported by the observation that NFKB1 reduction occurs first (as early as 24 h after transfection), whereas MCP-1 reduction is not seen until 48 h after transfection (Fig. 4) .",

As a crucial adaptor for innate immune responses, MyD88 is involved in the toll-like pathway leading to innate immunity against bacteria, as shown by the finding that MyD88-deficient mice were highly and more susceptible to bacterial invasion than TLR2-deficient mice (36) . Because MyD88, as well as toll-like receptors TL2 and TL4 for LPS and bacterial lipoprotein respectively, is present in the gingival and periodontal ligament fibroblasts (37) , it may be possible that MyD88 in periodontal tissues suppresses oral bacteria invasion. Given that the DF is the precursor of the periodontal ligament, it is not surprising that MyD88 is expressed in both tissues.",

            "text": "In conclusion, we have shown that MyD88 is expressed maximally in the DF of the first mandibular molar at day 3, the time of the major burst of osteoclastogenesis, as well as a time of high expression of IL-1\u03b1 in the adjacent stellate reticulum (28) . Our in vitro studies with DF cells show that knockdown of MyD88 gene expression nullifies the up-regulatory effect of IL-1\u03b1 on NFKB1, MCP-1 and RANKL gene expression. Moreover, knockdown of MyD88 in the DF cells reduces the chemotactic activity of the conditioned medium for osteoclast precursors from these cells in comparison to the controls in which MyD88 is expressed. Both MCP-1 and RANKL promote osteoclastogenesis and the DF regulates the osteoclastogenesis needed for eruption pathway formation. Thus, MyD88 expression in the DF may promote the stimulatory effect of IL-1\u03b1 upon genes needed for osteoclastogenesis (MCP-1 and RANKL), as well as possibly directly up-regulate MCP-1 expression. Expression of myeloid differentiation factor 88 (MyD88) mRNA and protein in the dental follicle. (A) mRNA expression of MyD88 in the dental follicle of postnatal day 1 to 11 by DNA microarray. The results are presented as the mean values \u00b1 standard deviations of three independent litters of rats, with the bars without same letter indicating statistical difference from each other. MyD88 expression at day 3 was significantly higher than at other days. (B) Immunostaining of MyD88 in rat first mandibular molar at day 5. MyD88 protein was expressed in the dental follicle (DF), as well in alveolar bone (AB), but not in the stellate reticulum (SR). (C) Immunostaining controls, in which the primary antibody was replaced by immunoglobulin G (IgG). No immunostaining was observed. Scale bar: 50 \u00b5m. Up-regulation of MyD88 by interleukin-1\u03b1 (IL-1\u03b1). The dental follicle cells were treated with IL-1\u03b1 (5 ng ml \u22121 ) for 1 to 12 h (repeated three times), and the MyD88 gene expression was determined using real-time RT-PCR. An asterisk (*) indicates a significant difference between IL-1\u03b1 treatment and the untreated control for a given time. MyD88 expression was significantly up-regulated by IL-1\u03b1 at 3 and 6 h. Reduction in expression of NFKB1 (A) and MCP-1(B) in the dental follicle cells with MyD88 knocked down. The dental follicle cells were transfected with siRNA targeting MyD88 mRNA (siRNA) or scrambled siRNA without targeting any RNA (control) at a concentration of 5 nM, and the expression of NFKB1 and MCP-1 was determined at 24, 48 and 72 h using real-time RT-PCR. The experiments were repeated three times, and the data were analyzed using paired t-tests. An asterisk (*) indicates a significant difference between siRNA and control for a given time point. The gene expression was significantly reduced at 24, 48 and 72 h for NFKB1, and at 48 and 72 h for MCP-1 after transfection. Dependence of IL-1\u03b1 up-regulated expression of NFKB1, MCP-1 and RANKL on MyD88. The dental follicle cells were transfected with either MyD88 siRNA to knock down MyD88 or scrambled siRNA as a control. After 48 h of transfection, the cells were treated with or without IL-1\u03b1 (5 ng ml \u22121 ) for 1 h for NFKB1 and RANKL expression, and 2 h for MCP-1 expression. Gene expression was determined using real-time RT-PCR. The experiments were repeated three times, and the data were analyzed using paired t-tests. An asterisk (*) indicates a significant difference between IL-1\u03b1 treatment and untreated control. Note that IL-1\u03b1 up-regulated the expression of NFKB1, MCP-1 and RANKL expression but that this was nullified in the dental follicle cells after MyD88 was knocked down by siRNA. ",
