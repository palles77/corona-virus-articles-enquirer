            "text": "We have analyzed the replication of deletion mutants of defective interfering (DI) RNAs derived from the coronavirus mouse hepatitis virus (MHV)-A59 in the presence of MHV-A59. Using two parental DI RNAs, MIDI and MIDIDH, a twin set of deletion mutants was generated with progressively shorter stretches of 5 sequence colinear with the genomic RNA. All deletion mutants contained in-frame ORFs. We show that in transfected cells and after one passage the DI RNAs were detectable and that their accumulation was positively correlated with the length of 5 sequence they contained. However, accumulation of two twin mutants, D2, in which sequences from nucleotide position 467 were fused to those from position 801, was undetectable. In passage 4 cells, but not in transfected or in passage 1 cells, recombination with genomic RNA led to the appearance of the parental DI RNAs. The accumulation of these parental RNAs was inversely correlated with the length of 5 sequence on the deletion mutants and was highest in the D2 samples. In sharp contrast to the data reported for MHV-JHM-derived DI RNAs, we show that MHV-A59-derived mutant RNAs do not require an internal sequence domain for replication. The data suggest that coronavirus replication involves an RNA superstructure at the 5 end of the genome or one comprising both ends of the genomic RNA. We also conclude from the recombination data that in-frame mutants with impaired replication signals are more fit than out-frame mutants with intact replication signals. \u1b67",

These DI RNAs were selected because they are replicated efficiently by the viral polymerase. An identical series of deletions was introduced into the 5-POL 1a part of both DIs. In this way a range of lengths of 5 sequence colinear with the genome from 3889 (MIDI) through 1990 (MIDIDH) to 466 nts (MIDIDBam/Pst) was generated which could be analyzed in the background of differently sized DI genomes. For MIDI, in all cases but one (the D2 mutant), the 5 sequences were fused to those starting at genomic nt position 2503. In the case of MIDIDH all fusions except D2 were with sequences starting at position 1984. The structure of the DIs and of the deletions made are depicted in Fig. 1 .

The latter two or uncoating signals, in which case only the P0 data would directly reflect replication efficiency of the deletion oligonucleotides only detect DI and genomic RNA but give a background signal of ribosomal RNA (indicated mutants.

Figure 3 shows that MIDIDPst (1145 nts) and mutants D3 (983 nts) and D1, lacking an additional 177 nts from the 5 end, replicated efficiently, but to lower levels than the parental MIDI. The mutant MIDIDBam/Pst, which has the shortest 5 sequence (466 nts), clearly replicated poorly, but to detectable levels. From Fig. 4 it can be seen that the accumulation of the MIDIDH derivatives was lower, but it showed the same pattern as did the MIDI derivatives. These mutants contain at most 1984 nts from the 5 end of the genome.
