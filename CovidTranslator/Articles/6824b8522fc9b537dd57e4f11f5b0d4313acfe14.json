All laboratory-confi rmed cases of MERS-CoV to date from Saudi Arabia have been reported to WHO. 4, 5 Data for clinical characteristics of MERS are scant because of the small number of cases detected since appearance of the virus 15 months ago. Clinical information from individual or cluster case reports is recorded by the Program for Monitoring Emerging Diseases (ProMED) and is summarised through updates 6-10 from WHO, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC). Data suggest that MERS presents primarily with respiratory symptoms and that most patients with serious disease have either other medical comorbid disorders or immunosuppression. Case reports of family clusters and hospital outbreaks in Saudi Arabia, [11] [12] [13] and other countries in the Middle East and Europe, [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] also indicate that individuals with MERS-CoV can present with a range of respiratory and non-respiratory symptoms, with many manifestations of clinical disease. Furthermore, recent case reports from Saudi Arabia [11] [12] [13] , the UK, 15, 16 France, 17 Germany, [18] [19] [20] Italy, 21 and Tunisia 22 suggest that mild respiratory illness might be part of a wider clinical spectrum of MERS-CoV infection. Two patients from Tunisia 9, 22 and one from the UK 16 had mild respiratory illnesses and they did not need to be admitted. Furthermore, initial presentations of MERS-CoV disease might not include respiratory symptoms initially. 12, 13 The fi rst patient reported from France 17 of MERS-CoV infection presented initially with diarrhoea and abdominal pain and subsequently developed respiratory symptoms.",

The largest number of MERS-CoV cases has been reported from Saudi Arabia, where 70 cases are known to date. Countries outside Saudi Arabiareporting a total of 20 patients with MERS-are Jordan, 14 the UK, 15, 16 Italy, 21 Germany, 19 France, 17, 18 Tunisia, 22 Qatar, and United Arab Emirates (table 1) . Some cases of MERS-CoV infection have been reported in travellers returning from the Middle East and in their close contacts (some without a travel history), 16, 17 suggesting person-to-person trans mission. This type of transmission was confi rmed by genome sequencing of MERS-CoV isolates from the Al-Hasa health-care-associated outbreak. 13 In Saudi Arabia, the fi rst case of MERS-CoV infection occurred in June, 2012 (reported in September, 2012). Two main reporting periods subsequently became apparent. The fi rst was the early period from June, 2012, until April 1, 2013, during which time nine cases were recorded in residents of central and western Saudi Arabia (Bishah, Al Qassim, and Riyadh; fi gure 2). These cases were predominantly male (90%), occurred sporadically, and included two small family clusters in Riyadh. In one family cluster, 12 the index case resided in an extended household of 28 males and females, including 18 children. Secondary cases arose in two sons, and a grandson also became infected. During this fi rst reporting period, no ill health was identifi ed or reported among health-care workers; thus, transmission potential of MERS-CoV in the community seems low. In the second period, from April 1, 2013, to July 14, 2013, almost all cases arose in the eastern province of Saudi Arabia (Al-Hasa) and were associated mainly with transmission in hospitals, including three cases among family contacts and two cases in health-care workers. 13 The rise in the number of MERS-CoV cases detected in Saudi Arabia during the second reporting period might not refl ect increased transmission but rather could be attributable to augmented case detection as a result of enhanced screening and surveillance activities. Dissemination of information on MERS-CoV by the Saudi Ministry of Health has raised awareness among healthcare providers and the public, leading to an increase in reports of suspected MERS-CoV cases, from 168 in April, 2013, to 524 in May, 2013 (currently about 70 reports daily, on average).",

Pneumonia was an incidental fi nding on chest radiography and he subsequently developed severe respiratory disease, from which he died. A second case of MERS-CoV infection was diagnosed subsequently at the same hospital in a patient on long-term steroid treatment. The respiratory presentation of the index case suggests transmission in the hospital room shared by both patients.

First, patients were self-selected because of referral to hospital and being screened actively for MERS-CoV by nature of their serious clinical condition. Second, we did a retrospective study of clinical case records. Third, case record entry was not done uniformly. Fourth, comorbidity data were unavailable for admissions without MERS-CoV infection and from the community population. Finally, follow-up data after discharge were missing. Despite these limitations, we have been able to delineate further the epidemiological, demographic, and clinical charac teristics of 47 Saudi patients with MERS-CoV infection. The main fi ndings of our study are that most patients present with serious respiratory disease, need to be admitted to hospital, and 60% of them die. Adults of both sexes are aff ected, at a mean age of 56 years (range 14-94). A quarter of patients had accompanying gastrointestinal symptoms, including diarrhoea and vomiting, and many cases occurred in individuals with chronic underlying comorbid medical disorders. Half of all patients had two medical comorbidities: diabetes and chronic renal disease. A study from Saudi Arabia showed that more than 50% of Saudi people older than 50 years have diabetes. 26 However, the large number of people with MERS-CoV infection and chronic renal disease might have been biased by the Al-Hasa hospital outbreak, which happened in the renal unit. Further case-control studies are needed to defi ne the eff ect of comorbidities on susceptibility to, and associated mortality from, MERS-CoV infection.",

This classifi cation precludes identifi cation of the full range of clinical presentations and misses asymptomatic, subclinical, and mild cases. Furthermore, since the fi rst case report from Saudi Arabia, in September, 2012, the Ministry of Health has recommended mandatory testing for MERS-CoV of all cases of respiratory illness requiring admission to intensive care. This directive has biased selection and detection of more severe cases of MERS-CoV infection and might have skewed the observed high case-fatality rates. Clinical symptoms, laboratory investigations, and imaging fi ndings of MERS-CoV are similar to those noted in other community-acquired respiratory-tract infections. For example, imaging features of MERS generally resemble those seen in patients with community-acquired pneumonia. Progression from unilateral focal air-space opacities to multifocal or bilateral involvement was frequent in patients admitted to the intensive-care unit with MERS pneumonia.

[27] [28] [29] [30] [31] [32] [33] [34] SARS originated in southern China in November, 2002, spread to Hong Kong, and was transmitted rapidly worldwide, resulting in 8422 cases and 916 deaths (case-fatality rate 11%). On the basis of our fi ndings, the clinical features of MERS-CoV disease bear some resemblance to those seen in patients with disease caused by SARS-CoV. In patients with MERS, fever, cough, and dyspnoea are the major symptoms in those admitted to hospital. Other common presenting symptoms include chills, rigor, headache, myalgia, and malaise. Although respiratory failure is a major clinical feature, mild disease and atypical presentation with diarrhoea have been reported in cases of MERS and SARS. Common laboratory features of SARS 32-34 recorded on admission include infi ltrates on chest radiographs and lymphopenia, whereas thrombo cytopenia and raised amounts of lactate dehydrogenase and alanine aminotransferase have been noted in some cases. Although our data show similarities in clinical presentation between cases of MERS and SARS, some important diff erences are also present (table 6) . After the Al-Hasa health-care-associated outbreak, 13 global concern grew about the pandemic potential of MERS-CoV. 35 Mathematical models developed recently 36, 37 allow conjecture on the pandemic potential of MERS-CoV. Breban and colleagues 37 defi ned the rate of spread by analysis of 55 of the fi rst 64 laboratory-confi rmed cases of MERS-CoV infection. The basic reproduction number (R 0 ; ie, the number of secondary cases every index patient is expected to infect in a fully susceptible population) of MERS-CoV is 0\u00b769 in the worst-case Breban and colleagues' analysis shows that the chance of MERS-CoV having an R 0 greater than 1 is very small. Data to assess any changes in incidence of admissions or mortality due to pneumonia are not available in the WHO Eastern Mediterranean region. Overall, as yet, evidence is scant throughout this WHO region to support the possibility of either transmission of MERS-CoV from asymptomatic infected individuals or ongoing, low prevalence, mildly symptomatic illness in the community.",

Two further asymptomatic cases have been recorded among female health-care workers in the eastern region and Al-Hasa. These fi ndings are important because the cases we present here might be just the tip of an iceberg of a range of clinical illness caused by MERS-CoV. Apart from enhanced and active surveillance for cases, we need to develop rapid, accurate, serological diagnostic tests for case-control studies.",
