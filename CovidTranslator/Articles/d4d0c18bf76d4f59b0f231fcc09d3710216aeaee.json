            "text": "Human metapneumovirus (hMPV) is a respiratory pathogen that was discovered in 2001 and is considered a major cause of both upper and lower respiratory tract infections. A sensitive, fast, and high-throughput diagnostic test is needed for the detection of hMPV that may assist in the clinical management as well as in the reduction of inappropriate therapy. Therefore, a comparison assessment was performed in this study between the PrimerDesign\u2122 genesig real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) Assay and the INFINITI \u00ae Respiratory Viral Panel Plus Assay (RVP-Plus) for the detection of hMPV infection in patients with respiratory tract infections. A total of 200 respiratory samples were collected from 185 hospitalized patients, during the winter season in Kuwait. Of 185 patients, 10 (5.4%) were positive for hMPV RNA by the in-house RT-PCR assay, while 7 (4%) were positive for hMPV RNA by the real-time RT-PCR assay and 9 (5%) were positive for hMPV RNA by the INFINITI \u00ae RVP-Plus assay. The high incidence rate (60%) of hMPV infection was in January 2011. The sensitivity of the real-time RT-PCR and INFINITI \u00ae RVP-Plus assays was 70% and 90%, respectively, with specificity of 100% for both assays. hMPV types A and B could be identified in this study; however, discordant genotyping results were found between the direct sequencing method and the INFINITI \u00ae RVP-Plus assay in 33% of hMPV-positive patients.",

Nucleic acid amplification tests are the gold standard approach for the diagnosis of viral respiratory infections (Lee et al., 2006) , compared to old conventional approaches such as culture methods. In spite of the difficulties in the diagnosis of a wide range of viral respiratory infections due to the similarity in the clinical presentations, symptoms, and signs, nucleic acid amplification tests can assist in this process (Fox, 2007) . Recently, nucleic acid amplification tests such as polymerase chain reaction method (PCR), reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), real-time PCR, and multiplex PCR combined with microarray detection are being used widely in the diagnosis of respiratory viruses for their enhanced sensitivity and specificity above the conventional methods.",

Since then, it has been implicated as a common cause of upper and lower respiratory tract infections in children and adults of all ages (Boivin et al., 2002) . hMPV is a single negative-stranded RNA enveloped virus that is classified in the Pneumovirinae subfamily of the Paramyxoviridae family. Genetic analysis revealed a relatively high degree of sequence variability between different hMPV isolates, and 2 major subgroups, A and B, were identified. Subsequent genetic analysis led to a further subdivision of the hMPV A and B subgroups into the subtypes A1, A2, B1, and B2 (Biacchesi et al., 2003) . Moreover, subgroup A2 was further subdivided into 2 minor subgroups, A2a and A2b (Huck et al., 2006) . hMPV infection is seasonal, with peak infection in the winter and spring months (Ali et al., 2010; Al-Turab et al., 2011; Sugrue et al., 2008) .",

Concordant results were obtained for only 6 (67%) of 9 samples (Table 1) . A comparison between the different molecular assays for the detection and genotyping of hMPV RNA in terms of cost, turnaround time, and automation is shown in Table 2 .",

A sensitive, rapid, automated, and high-throughput diagnostic test is needed for the detection of hMPV and other respiratory viruses, which may assist in the clinical management as well as in the reduction of the implementation of inappropriate therapy and hospitalization (Barenfanger et al., 2000; Fox, 2007) . Some recent studies suggested the importance of comparing the molecular diagnostic methods with other molecular techniques to assess performance, because of the superior sensitivity of the molecular methods compared to conventional ones (Ali et al., 2011) . Therefore, in this study, we compared the sensitivity of 2 molecular assays, the PrimerDesign\u2122 genesig real-time RT-PCR and the INFINITI \u00ae RVP-Plus assays, with a reference assay, the in-house RT-PCR, using a set of degenerate primers targeting the N gene, for the detection of hMPV RNA in clinical specimens. The in-house RT-PCR was used as a gold standard test to confirm the presence or absence of hMPV RNA in cases of discrepancy between the 2 assays. All the 10 hMPV RNA-positive samples detected by the in-house RT-PCR were confirmed by direct sequencing. Although RT-PCR is still the method of choice for the detection of hMPV RNA in many clinical laboratories for its high sensitivity and specificity (Jin et al., 2012; Kroll & Weinberg, 2011; Zhu et al., 2011) , it is not preferred due to the total turnaround time needed along with some other confirmatory tests such as sequencing which may take a total of 48 h.",

The turnaround time to accomplish the real-time RT-PCR was 3 h for hMPV RNA detection as well as quantification. The INFINITI \u00ae RVP-Plus assay showed higher sensitivity (90%) than the genesig real-time RT-PCR, and all specimen results were positive for the internal control, ensuring the validity of results. The turnaround time for the detection and genotyping of hMPV RNA and other respiratory viruses using the INFINITI \u00ae RVP-Plus required around 24 h for 24 samples. hMPV RNA could not be detected in 1 sample by the INFINITI \u00ae RVP-Plus assay and was also hardly detected by the real-time RT-PCR, showing very low viral load suggesting that the discordance is due to the difference in the sensitivity of the 2 assays to detect low viral load as reported earlier (Ali et al., 2011) . Our results indicated that both hMPV genotypes A and B were circulating with no predominance for certain genotypes. However, the INFINITI \u00ae RVP-Plus assay showed discrepancies in genotyping results with the direct sequencing method. Although genotyping is required in some viral infection cases, some studies showed that, in case of hMPV infection, there is no such correlation between different hMPV genotypes and the severity or the outcome of the disease (Agapov et al., 2006; Debur et al., 2010) .",

Recently, several data were published concerning the evaluation of different molecular-based techniques for the detection of respiratory viruses showing some discrepancies in the results between different molecular methods (Ali et al., 2011; Arens et al., 2010; Dare et al., 2007; Gharabaghi et al., 2011; Raymond et al., 2009) . Although a multiplex PCR combined with microarray detection such as the INFINITI \u00ae RVP-Plus assay is sensitive, has high-throughput (24 samples/run), is time saving, and has expert techniques, it is not commonly used in clinical laboratories owing to its cost and complexity. hMPV is known as a common disease in young children (Al-Turab et al., 2011; Falsey et al., 2003; Principi et al., 2006; Williams et al., 2004; Van den Hoogen et al., 2004) , and our data have shown that most hMPV-positive patients were infants less than 2 years (60%). In our previous work, hMPV infection was not detected among children and adults from 2 years up to 60 years (Al-Turab et al., 2011) . However, in this study, hMPV was detected in 10% of children aged from 2 to 17 years and in 30% of adults aged from 18 up to 60 years. Three of 4 in these 2 age groups (75%) had pneumonia, 2 of whom were admitted to the intensive care unit. This emphasizes the importance of hMPV infection not only in young children and elderly people, but also in middle-age groups, which supports the finding of a previous study showing that hMPV infection occurs in adults of all ages and may account for a significant portion of persons hospitalized with respiratory infections (Falsey et al., 2003) . In addition, in our previous study, rhinovirus was found to be the major cause of acute respiratory infections followed by hMPV, respiratory syncytial virus, and then adenoviruses, a finding that was also obtained in the present study (data not shown) (Al-Turab et al., 2011) .",
