            "text": "Hong Kong has been severely affected by severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). Contact in households and healthcare settings is thought to be important for transmission, putting children at particular risk. Most data so far, however, have been for adults. We prospectively followed up the first ten children with SARS managed during the early phase of the epidemic in Hong Kong. All the children had been in close contact with infected adults. Persistent fever, cough, progressive radiographic changes of chest and lymphopenia were noted in all patients. The children were treated with high-dose ribavirin, oral prednisolone, or intravenous methylprednisolone, with no short-term adverse effects. Four teenagers required oxygen therapy and two needed assisted ventilation. None of the younger children required oxygen supplementation. Compared with adults and teenagers, SARS seems to have a less aggressive clinical course in younger children. Since late February, 2003, WHO has received reports of outbreaks of a severe form of atypical pneumonia in Vietnam, Hong Kong, and Singapore. Hong Kong is the most severely affected city. WHO has referred to this unusual form of severe pneumonia as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). 1 The surveillance case definition of SARS is: history of high fever (>38\u040aC); one or more respiratory symptoms, including cough, shortness of breath, and difficulty breathing; and close contact within 10 days before onset of symptoms with a person who has been diagnosed with SARS, history of travel within 10 days before onset before symptoms to an area with reported foci of SARS transmission, or both. 1 Household contact and contacts in health-care settings are believed to be important routes of transmission. 2, 3 This transmission route could put children at particular risk, but most data available so far have been in adults. We therefore decided to report our experience in treating children with SARS.",

All these patients had mild progressive consolidative change on serial chest radiographs but complete resolution was achieved within 14 days. The typical radiographic changes in one patient are shown in the figure. Three of the five teenagers (patients 7-9) presented with bilateral lower-lobe opacification at presentation, which progressed rapidly within days. Despite clinical improvement, these consolidative changes persisted into the 2nd week of the illness. Patient 10 showed no abnormality on chest radiography at presentation, but high-resolution CT confirmed focal consolidation in the right lower lobe. In CT of the thorax in patients 2 and 6, the characteristic features of peripheral and alveolar opacities simulated the radiological appearances of bronchiolitis obliterans organising pneumonia. Four teenagers required supplemental oxygen, one required bi-level positive airway pressure and intermittent positive-pressure ventilation.

Teenage patients presented with symptoms of malaise, myalgia, chill, and rigor similar to those of adults, 2,3 whereas the younger children presented mainly with cough and runny nose, and none had chills, rigor, or myalgia. The clinical course was much milder and shorter among younger patients, and radiological changes were milder and generally resolved more quickly than in the teenagers. All paediatric patients had clinically important lymphopenia, 3 Clinical features and treatment outcomes among SARS children children. 5 Among our patients, short-term use of high-dose ribavirin was well tolerated and had no major short-term adverse effects such as severe haemolytic anaemia. In addition, high-dose corticosteroid was used in combination with the antiviral agent because severe immune-mediated damage of lung tissue was reported in postmortem examination of SARS patients. 3 Eight of the ten children had been attending school at the time of presentation. There was no evidence that they had spread the infection to their classmates. This finding is in sharp contrast to the experience reported among adults that SARS carries a very high infectivity rate. 2, 3 At the time of our study, 22 adults had died in Hong Kong. 3 During the study period, around 30 children were suspected as having SARS in Hong Kong. So far, no child has died. Our preliminary findings suggest that young children develop a milder form of the disease with a less-aggressive clinical course than do teenagers and adults.",

On this basis, we did an open-label study in which oral gabapentin 300 mg thrice daily was given for every other chemotherapy treatment in nine patients with breast cancer. Six of the nine reported at least a three-point improvement in peak delayed nausea (on an eight-point nausea scale), and three patients had complete resolution of nausea when taking gabapentin. This preliminary evidence shows that gabapentin might have a role in treatment of chemotherapy-induced nausea. Delayed onset of nausea induced by chemotherapy remains a problem for about half of patients receiving moderately emetogenic chemotherapy, despite preventive treatment with a serotonin antagonist and dexamethasone. 1 We describe an open-label study of therapy with the anticonvulsant gabapentin for acute (within 24 h) and delayed onset (days 2-5) nausea induced by chemotherapy.",
