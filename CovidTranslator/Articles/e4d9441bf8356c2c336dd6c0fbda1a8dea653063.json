However, temperature monitoring procedures have a very powerful psychological effect of reassuring parents and the public that schools are safe during a SARS outbreak. This is an important consideration which cannot be discounted. With the simplification and streamlining of procedures to reduce inconvenience to students and schools, temperature monitoring remains a useful community response in the event of an outbreak.",

Blood was taken for measurement of concentrations of vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 (VCAM-1) and markers of activation of neutrophils (L-selectin and leukotriene B4), and platelets (P-selectin). Fifteen (54%) of the children with HbSS, but none of the Hb SC group, had sleeping hypoxaemia, defined as mean sleeping SaO 2 93% or less. There was no significant difference between sleeping and waking SaO 2 .Daytime and night-time hypoxaemia was demonstrated in over half of the children with HbSS and was associated with a greater degree of anaemia, increased red cell adhesion to endothelium, and an increase in markers of neutrophil and platelet activation. Is the hypoxaemia the cause or the result of the observed changes? These researchers have previously published evidence that the hypoxaemia in their patients is not due to lung disease. In severe sickle cell disease greater anaemia is associated with a greater shift to the right of the haemoglobin dissociation curve and they propose that it is this that leads to cellular activation and sickle cell complications. Clinicians, they say, may need to take more notice of modest levels of hypoxaemia and be prepared to intervene more readily.",
