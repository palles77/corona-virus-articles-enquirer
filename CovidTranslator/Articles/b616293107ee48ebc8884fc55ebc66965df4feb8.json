The main clinical signs included chronic diarrhea (93%), weight loss (71%), polyuropolydypsia (48%), vomiting (43%), polyphagia (38%), fatigability (36%) and dysorexia (19%) with a median duration of 4 months before diagnosis. Cobalamin values ranged from 44 to 400 ng/L (median: 296 ng/L). 60% of the hypocobalaminemic cats had also a hyperfolatemia (folate > 12 ng/L) at diagnosis. fT4 was measured in the 64 older cats (> 12 years) and revealed an hyperthyroidism (fT4 > 40 pmol/L) in 20% of the cases. 67/259 hypocobalaminemic cats had a known clinical and biological follow-up (median time follow-up = 44 days): cobalamin significantly improved 1 month after treatment (50 lg/kg IM cyanocobalamin in a single dose) for 87% of the cats, even if 16% remained hypocobalaminemic. 62% of the followed cats were clinically improved, of which 85% with an associated higher cobalamin value. Clinical and biological improvement after cobalamin supplementation was significantly associated with an increase in folate concentration (P-value = 0.02). However, 33% of the cats with an improved cobalamin value did not show any clinical improvement.",

The use of next generation sequencing (NGS) technologies has allowed identification of diversity and distribution of the virome. These approaches can equally be applied to dogs.This study aimed to identify and characterise the virome present in faeces of dogs with chronic enteropathy (CE) compared to the virome of healthy dogs (HD). Faecal samples were evaluated from 8 HD and 8 dogs with CE (4 Food, 3 Antibiotic and 1 Steroid Responsive) using a NGS approach. A viral enrichment protocol, using a series of centrifugation, endonuclease treatments and bacterial filtration were performed. The enriched viral DNA and RNA were extracted and amplified using sequence-independent single-primer amplification (SISPA) protocol, and subsequently sequenced by NGS using the Illumina MiSeq platform at the AGRF. Two bioinformatic pipelines were used to analyse the viral population. After selecting high quality reads and removing dog and bacterial sequences, sequence information was compared against 2 reference databases. We identified a total of 15,358 viral contigs, with 14,241 DNA viral sequences and 1,041 RNA sequences across all 16 dog samples. The majority of viral hits from both groups of faecal samples were bacteriophage (73.8% HD and 99.7% CE), from several families mainly from the Caudovirales order. After all analyses, only 6 viral eukaryotic families were identified across all samples. Two groups of sequences similar to known virus families, Reoviridae and Papillomaviridae, were identified in both groups (HD 1/8 and 1/8 and CE 2/8 and 2/8, respectively). Sequences similar to Picornaviridae were identified only in one dog with CE and sequences similar to Adenoviridae, Parvoviridae and Coronaviridae were identified only in healthy dogs (1/8 each).Further genomic characterisation and phylogenetic analysis was undertaken on 2 viruses. The 11 genome segments of a Rotavirus (Reoviridae) isolate were determined. Similarly, the sequence of the entire coding region of a kobuvirus (Picornaviridae) isolate was determined. Preliminary analyses indicated that all rotavirus gene segments exhibited between 55% -98% nt homology to previously reported canine rotaviruses. The kobuvirus sequence exhibited moderate nt homology (55%) to previously described genomes and clustered with other canine kobuvirus sequences available in GenBank. In conclusion, viral sequences from a range of different virus families, including both RNA and DNA families, and known pathogens were identified and characterised, and the largest proportion of viral contigs identified belonged to bacteriophages.",

Fecal S100A12 concentrations were increased in dogs with chronic gastroenteropathy (CE), and correlated with the severity of clinical and endoscopic disease. A negative outcome was associated with higher fecal S100A12 concentrations in CE dogs, but the response to different forms of treatment and fecal S100A12 has not been reported, and this information will be important to further evaluate the utility of fecal S100A12 as a biomarker for gastrointestinal disease. Aim of this study was to evaluate the association between responses to various treatments (i.e., elimination diet, antimicrobial drugs, or corticosteroids/other immunosuppressants) and fecal S100A12 in dogs with CE. Fecal samples were collected from dogs diagnosed with CE, and fecal S100A12 was measured in all specimens using an established in-house ELISA. Based on the response to treatment, dogs were classified as having antibiotic-responsive diarrhea (ARD), food-responsive diarrhea (FRD), or steroid-responsive/therapy-resistant idiopathic inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Statistical analysis was performed using non-parametric 2-or multiple-group comparisons, the likelihood ratio to evaluate the association between groups of dogs and response to treatment, and a receiver operating characteristic curve to calculate sensitivity and specificity at the optimum cut-off concentration. A total of 64 dogs with CE (median age: 6.3 years; 33 males/ 31 females) were included in the study, the final diagnosis of which were ARD (n = 9), FRD (n = 30), or IBD (n = 25). Response to treatment was complete remission (n = 35), partial response (n = 25), or no response (n = 4). Fecal S100A12 concentrations ranged from 1 to 34,500 ng/g, and higher S100A12 levels were seen in dogs with IBD than in dogs with FRD (P = 0.010) or ARD (P = 0.025). Dogs that did not respond to treatment had significantly higher S100A12 levels than dogs with partial (P = 0.005) or complete (P = 0.003) remission, but response to treatment was associated with disease classification (P = 0.020). Despite a small number of patients, fecal S100A12 levels of >2,700 ng/g at the time of diagnosis distinguished dogs that failed responding to treatment from those with at least partial remission with a sensitivity of 100% and specificity of 87%. We conclude that, in line with our previous finding that fecal S100A12 may be a useful biomarker of disease severity in dogs with IBD, fecal S100A12 may also have utility in predicting the lack of response to treatment in dogs with CE. The utility of serial fecal S100A12 concentrations to monitor treatment response in dogs with CE warrants further research.",

All dogs were given oral prednisolone (1 mg/kg/day) for 14 days, followed by a tapering dosage over 10 weeks. After 4 weeks of prednisolone treatment, a certified canine rehabilitation therapist instructed the owners of dogs in the exercise group on how to increase their dogs' physical exercise.

Owners of dogs in the control group were asked to maintain the dogs' routine lifestyles.

Introduction: In healthy animals, the phosphate (P) in combination with calcium homeostasis is regulated in comparatively narrow limits: excessively ingested P is excreted via urine. Common knowledge is, however, that P is a progressive factor in chronic renal failure (CRF) wherefore typically a P restricted diet is prescribed for affected patients. In 1995, Pastoor demonstrated that a P excess (significantly at~890 mg P/MJ ME; Ca/P 0.4/1 for 28 days) impairs renal function even in healthy cats, diagnosed mainly by reduced endogenous creatinine clearance. Dietary P originates from meat and other protein sources, bones and cartilages, mineral supplements and technical additives (water binding, palatability a/o texture enhancer etc.). The daily amount ingested with complete diets from the European market often exceeds the recommended daily allowance (RDA; NRC 2006 , FEDIAF 2014 considerably (up to 10times, Anonymus 2014).",

The P concentration of a diet alone is no sufficient marker of its tolerance since Ca/P ratio and P origin influence the effects.

The use of NTproBNP, Troponin I (high-sensitivity, cTnI) and PDK4 pre-screening for occult dilated cardiomyopathy(ODCM) in the Doberman pinscher(DP) has been previously reported. The aim of this prospective collaborative study was to identify robust pre-screening recommendations for DP utilizing the current generation of commercially available diagnostic tests. A cohort of asymptomatic DP were evaluated at the American Doberman National Specialty show in 2012, 2013, and 2014 (N = 449, median age 5 years, range 1-12). Evaluations consisted of auscultation, echocardiography (echo), 3-minute ECG (ECG), NTproBNP (Cardiopet Plus R ), cTnI, and PDK4. DP were classified as affected (ODCM) if their LVIDs was > the PROTECT entry criteria with or without VPCs (N = 22). DP were classified as normal (NL) if their LVIDd and LVIDs < PROTECT entry criteria and they had no VPCs (NTproBNP:N = 373, cTnI:N = 368, PDK4;N = 253). ROC analysis comparing ODCM and NL was done for NTproBNP, cTnI, and PDK4. Overall accuracy (percent correctly classified) was considered for individual tests as well as a variety of combinations. The goal of combining tests was to eliminate false negatives while minimizing false positives. The AUC for NTproBNP, cTnI and PDK4 was 0.91, 0.90 and 0.65 respectively with the percentage correctly classified equal to 81.8, 80.7 and 56.1 (including 4 false negatives for PDK4) when a cut-off of 548 pmol/l, 0.139 ng/mL or a positive PDK4 (hetero-or homozygous) were used respectively. When the cutoffs for NTproBNP and cTnI are used in combination the AUC was 0.95 and 91.3% were correctly classified (0 false negatives, 30 false positives).",

Statistical analysis included paired t-test (Wilcoxon test) and a linear regression analysis with graphical analysis to assess agreement between the 2 methods of data acquisition. There was a highly significant correlation (P < 0.001) between the values obtained in short-axis and long-axis views for the parameter LA diameter (longitudinal: 0.96AE0.07 cm; transversal: 0.94AE0.1 cm), a very significant correlation (P < 0.01) for the parameter LVDs (Longitudinal: 0.56AE0.2 cm; transversal: 0.69AE0.2 cm), and significant correlation (P < 0.05) for the parameters IVSs (longitudinal: 0.7AE0.14 cm; transversal: 0.68AE0.18 cm), LVPWs (longitudinal: 0.74AE0.18 cm; transversal: 0.66AE0.14 cm) and FS (longitudinal: 55.7AE14.1%; transversal: 48.3AE15.4%), with no significant correlation (P > 0.05) between the 2 methods for the remaining parameters.

Each participant placed 2 arrows on each image to denote the start and finish points of their left atrial measurements without prior instructions -the first being near the interface with the aorta and the second being along the caudolateral border of the left atrium.

Expression of selected genes were measured by SYBR-Green based qRT-PCR and normalized to 2 different housekeeping genes (HPRT1, RPS5) by ddCt method. Quality controls were made by melting curve analysis and size determination of the PCR products by agarosegel electrophoresis. For data evaluation descriptive statistics, Student's t-test and Mann Whitney U-test were used. The selected gene-expression panel consisted of 13 different mRNAs which represent main biological processes related to fibrosis, remodeling and impaired contractility. COL1A2, MMP1, TIMP1, VCAN, SPP1 are directly related to collagen turnover and remodeling. IL8, CCL2 are inflammatory markers. STC1, HSP70, S100A are early stress response genes. TGFB2 has central role in fibrosis while MYH6 and MYH7 ensure cardiac specificity.",

Within the distal nephron, the enzyme 11-beta hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase 2 (11bHSD2) protects the mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) from activation by cortisol, allowing it to interact with aldosterone. In humans, mutations of 11bHSD2 cause apparent mineralocorticoid excess, characterised by sodium and water retention with resultant hypertension. Sodium and water retention is also a hallmark of canine congestive heart failure (CHF). This could partly be explained by dysregulation of renal 11bHSD2 activity, exposing MR to activation by cortisol. The aim of this study was to investigate the activity of renal 11bHSD2 in canine CHF by measuring the concentration of cortisol and its metabolites in the urine from affected dogs. Owners collected urine in a home environment from healthy adult dogs (n = 7), and from dogs prior to presentation with non-cardiac chronic disease (n = 6), and dogs with cardiac disease (ISACHC Ib, n = 4; ISACHCII or III, n = 5). Levels of cortisol (F) and cortisone (E) excreted in urine were measured by mass spectrometry. Urinary cortisol was normalised to creatinine to account for variations in glomerular filtration rate. Cortisol was also measured in plasma obtained from all unhealthy dogs. Plasma cortisol levels (P = 0.75)and urinary cortisol:creatinine ratio (P = 0.22) did not differ between groups. However, the F/E ratio, was increased in dogs with class II-III heart failure (P = 0.048). An increased F/E ratio, in the presence of unchanged plasma cortisol, implies decreased renal 11bHSD2 activity and enhanced MR activation by cortisol in canine CHF. This data suggests that changes in renal cortisol metabolism in canine CHF cannot be explained by chronicity of disease, that the urinary F/E ratio has potential as a biomarker for canine CHF and that renal 11bHSD2 could offer a therapeutic target in its management. Further studies investigating 11bHSD2 expression and bioactivity in canine CHF are ongoing.",

In humans endomyocardial biopsy (EMB) is highly recommended in case of unexplained left ventricular dysfunction associated to ventricular arrhythmias (VA) or high-grade atrioventricular block (AVB). Despite the frequency of these conditions in dogs, histopathology data are lacking. The aims of this study were to describe the feasibility of EMB in dogs and to investigate a possible role of viral myocarditis in case of unexplained dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) phenotypes, high-grade AVBs, supraventricular arrhythmias (SVA) and VA. Twenty-five dogs of different breeds, M/F 1,5, mean age 5.95 + 3.07 years, mean body weight 32.8 + 11.52 kg, presented for third degree AVB 9/25, DCM 6/25, VA 6/25, SVA 2/25, and VA+SVA 2/25, underwent percutaneous right EMB under general anesthesia throughout the jugular vein. For each dog clinical records were analyzed. In all dogs at least one right ventricular sample (range 1-4) was collected for histopathology and immunohistochemistry; in 16/25 dogs at least one sample (range 1-3) for viral PCR was collected. All histopathologic samples were stained with haematoxylin and eosin, Masson's trichrome and red elastic picrocirius. In selected cases stains with monoclonal anti-CD3 and anti-CD79 were performed. Nucleic acids were obtained after sample storage in RNA later solution, disruption with tissue Lyser and extraction with TRIzol; and tested for canine viruses (enteric and respiratory coronavirus, herpes virus, distemper virus, adenovirus 1 and 2, and parvovirus) and for West Nile virus and Bartonella spp. Seven out of 25 dogs had aspecific signs of cardiomyopathy and 2/25 suggestive of arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC). EMB gave normal samples in 6/25 dogs and not diagnostic in 1/25 dog. Nine out of 25 samples were suggestive of myocarditis at different stages (3 third degree AVB, 5 DCM and 1 SVA). Two of these dogs resulted positive for virus (1 enteric coronavirus, 1 herpes virus). None of the dogs had positive immunoistochemical stains. Two dogs with cardiomyopathy were positive for herpes virus and for herpes virus and parvovirus, respectively. Both of these dogs came from a kennel. No complication was noted in 24/25 dogs, one dog had self-limiting pericardial effusion. This study showed, similarly to human cardiology, that EMB is a safe and useful technique that allows recognition and classification of unexplained myocardial and rhythm disorders, 25% of which possibly associated with viral myocarditis. Further studies are needed to prove the relationship between viruses and myocarditis in a larger cohort of dogs.",

However, they require multiple calibrations and therefore multiple blood sampling; moreover, the sensors are quite expensive and can be used only for a few days. A new human flash glucose monitoring system (FGM) (FreeStyle Libre, Abbott, UK) measures IG, does not require calibration, is rather inexpensive and the sensor can be used as many as 14 days. It is composed by a small sensor applied subcutaneously that has to be \"scanned\"with a reader to obtain real time glucose values. The aim of this study was to assess the accuracy of this FGM in diabetic dogs. In all dogs the sensor was placed on the neck area and fixed with an adhesive patch. During the 1 st -2nd, 6 th -7th, 13 th -14th days from the application, the IG measurements were compared with the peripheral blood (EDTA plasma) glucose (PG) concentrations analysed by a reference hexochinase based method (Olympus/Beckman Coulter AU400). Linear regression, Bland Altman plots and the Clarke error grid analysis were used to assess the accuracy. Ten client-owned diabetic dogs on insulin treatment were included. Median age was 9.5 years (range 2-13), 7 were female (spayed), 3 were male (2 neu-tered). Median body weight was 17.9 kg (range 5.4-43.1). Four hundred and sixty four simultaneous measurements were taken with FGM (IG) and with the reference method (PG): 29 samples were in the hypoglycemic range (<70 mg/dL), 175 in the euglycemic range (70-180 mg/dL) and 260 in the hyperglycemic range (>180 mg/dL). Considering all the measurements together a positive significant correlation between IG and PG concentrations (r 2 = 0.86) was found. MeanAEstandard deviation difference from the reference method was \u00c01.8AE22 mg/dL in the hypoglycemic range, \u00c09.8AE47 mg/dL in the euglycemic range, \u00c01.25AE63 mg/dL in the hyperglycemic range. IG values differed >50 mg/dL from the reference method in 0%, 11% and 32% and >25 mg/dl in 13%, 27% and 70% in the hypoglycemic, euglycemic and hyperglycemic range, respectively. Underestimation-overestimation of IG compared to PG was observed in 31-69%, 60-38% and 48-39% of hypoglycemic, euglycemic and hyperglycemic measurements, respectively; 78.6% and 97.8% of glucose values measured by FGM fall in zone A and zones A+B of the error grid analysis, respectively. The application of the sensor was easy and apparently painless; a mild local erythema after sensor removal was found in 5/10 dogs. FGM is a simple and promising glucose monitoring system that seems accurate for the clinical use in diabetic dogs.",

Mutations of the GNAS gene provide an explanation for ACTH-independent hormonal activity of ATs, but the autonomous growth remains greatly undisclosed. An approach to elucidate the proliferative capacity of ATs is to learn from the current understanding of adrenal growth biology. The Sonic Hedgehog (SHH) signaling pathway plays an essential role in the development of the adrenal gland and in regulating adrenocortical cell proliferation. The members of the SHH signaling pathway are present in progenitors of the steroidogenic cells of the normal adrenal gland and dysregulation of SHH signaling has been implicated in adrenal cancer in humans.

Tools to diagnose the disease and monitor treatment effect are limited, with insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) currently being the only easily accessible blood test. Serum IGF-1 has previously been shown to be insensitive when assessing RT effect. Development of additional serological diagnostic tools that can be measured alongside serum IGF-1 is therefore desirable.

This study therefore aimed to: 1. further evaluate the use of serum PIIINP to differentiate HSDM from DM; and 2. to evaluate PIIINP as a marker for treatment success.",

Published evidence in a limited number of cases dating from the 1960s indicates that cats do not appear to have naturally-occurring antibodies against canine red blood cell antigens. In fact compatibility tests before the first transfusion did not demonstrate evidence of agglutination or haemolysis of canine erythrocytes in feline serum and no severe acute adverse reactions have been reported in cats receiving a single transfusion with canine blood. Severe acute reactions not reported so far cannot however be excluded and we decided to perform a pilot study to evaluate the presence of naturally occurring antibodies against canine red blood cell antigens in cats and viceversa. Surplus material from diagnostic samples (blood EDTA and blood serum samples) of 13 cats and 24 dogs was used to perform test-tube major and minor cross-match tests (at 37\u00b0C, 4\u00b0C and room temperature (RT)) and blood typing, after obtaining the informed consent from owners. Hemolysis, macro-and micro-ag-glutination were investigated in each test tube and were considered markers of a positive matching. Blood from each cat was tested with blood from 2 to 6 different dogs for a total of 49 major and minor cross-matchings each one performed at the 3 different temperatures of incubation. Thirty-eight overall major cross-matchings proved positive at 37\u00b0C, 33 at RT and 39 at 4\u00b0C respectively. The minor cross-matching was positive in all but 2 tests performed at 37\u00b0C. No cat tested totally negative (37\u00b0C, 4\u00b0C, RT) at both major and minor cross-matching procedures performed towards any single dog. Ten cats experienced positive major and minor cross-matching at 37\u00b0C, RT and 4\u00b0C towards 1-3 different dogs. Five cats were positive in the major cross-match, at least at 37\u00b0C, towards 1-3 different different dogs. Seven cats obtained a positive major cross-match at RT and/or at 4\u00b0C towards 1-5 dogs. Only 2 cats tested completely negative at 37\u00b0C, RT and 4\u00b0C, in one out of the 4 different major cross-matchings performed. In conclusion, naturally occurring antibodies against canine red blood cell antigens appear to be frequently detected in cats as well as those against feline red blood cell antigens in dogs. Xenotrasfusion of canine blood to cats should only be performed after the selection of a compatible donor by means of at least a negative major cross-match test result.",

It is a selective non-competitive inhibitor of inosine-5 0monophosphate dehydrogenase, which is expressed in many cell types. MPA's ability to induce lymphocyte cytotoxicity, reduce monocyte recruitment, and suppress dendritic cell maturation, are useful targets in treating immune mediated and inflammatory diseases. It has been used extensively in human medicine for transplant recipients and more recently in veterinary medicine in dogs with various immune mediated diseases. However, its use in cats is limited in part because MPA is primarily metabolized by glucuronidation and cats inherently have a decreased ability to glucuronidate many drugs.

A statistically significant increase of sCys-C was observed in Group B, with doses of 2 mg/Kg of prednisone (0.18 AE 0.03 mg/L; P < 0.01), and doses of 4 mg/Kg of prednisone (0.28 AE 0.15 mg/L; P < 0.001) respect to these same dogs before treatment (0.05 AE 0.04 mg/L) and compared to the control group (0.07 AE 0.04 mg/L). However, the serum concentration observed in hyperadrenocorticism (0.09AE 0.06 mg/L) was similar to the one find in the healthy animals Group. The creatinine concentration was not increased either, during the prednisone treatment, or in the case of hiperadrenocorticism. In conclusion, the present study agrees with that is described in human medicine, and confirms the effects of glucocorticoids on sCys C concentrations in dogs. The administration of high doses of prednisone is associated with a sCys C increase. On the other hand endogenous cortisol increase (hyperadrenocorticism) in dogs is not seen to modificate the sCys C.",

However, little is known about frequency or eventual prognostic significance of blood eosinophilia in MCT bearing dogs. Thus, the aim of this study was to determine frequency of absolute and relative peripheral blood eosinophilia as well as eosinopenia and to evaluate potential influence on progression free interval (PFI), overall survival time (OST) and tumor specific survival (TSS). Dogs with mast cell tumors diagnosed between 2008 and 2014 were included into this retrospective study. Data were collected from medical records and follow up phone conversations with patient owners or referring veterinarians. Medical records were reviewed to rule out underlying clinical conditions other than MCT that could cause eosinophilia. Tumor diagnosis was made either by fine needle aspirate and/or tumor biopsy. A patient was allocated to the eosinophilic group, when the eosinophil concentration was >0.8*10 3 /lL or the relative percentage was > 4%, respectively. When the eosinophil concentration was <0.1*10 3 /lL patients were categorized as eosinopenic. Groups were compared by the Pearson Chi-Square test. The PFI, OST and TSS curves were generated by the Kaplan-Meier product limit method. A log rank test was used to compare the curves. One-hundred dogs were included into this study. Absolute eosinophilia was detected in 8/ 100 patients and in 37/100 a relative eosinophilia was present. Median concentration of eosinophils was 0.3*10 3 /lL (range, 0-3093) and median relative percentage was 3.0% (range, 0-25%). Eosinopenia was found in 24% of all dogs. A positive association between relative eosinophilia and low grade tumors was detected with both Patnaik (P = 0.001) and Kiupel (P = 0.027) grading system. A positive linear correlation was further noticed between absolute eosinophilia and OST (P = 0.022). Positive correlation was confirmed between relative eosinophilia and PFS (P = 0.001), OST (P = 0.001), and TSS (P = 0.001). Accordingly a negative linear fit was found between eosinopenia and PFI (P = 0.002), OST (P = 0.004) and TSS (P = 0.001). Data indicate that peripheral blood eosinophilia might serve as an easily available additional prognostic tool for mast cell tumor bearing dogs.",

The detection of Leishmania infantum-specific antibodies has been extensively exploited for specific diagnosis and monitoring of treatment in canine leishmaniosis. High levels of L. infantum-specific antibodies are commonly observed in dogs with moderate to severe disease. Controversial results have been described regarding the use of kinetics of L. infantum specific antibodies during treatment monitoring. The majority of the studies reported that antibodies often decreased slowly but remained detectable over a long period of time while older studies considered that serology was not useful for treatment monitoring. A consensus statement is that measurement of antibody levels is meaningless before 6 months of treatment. The aim of this study was to evaluate L. infantumspecific antibodies at the time of diagnosis and during treatment follow-up visits and to correlate these with the dog's clinical status. Nineteen dogs were diagnosed (day 0) and followed-up during treatment (days 30, 180 and 365). The treatment protocol was a combination of meglumine antimoniate (50 mg/kg/12 h SC for 1 month) and allopurinol (10 mg/kg/12 h PO for 1 year). Physical examination and baseline laboratory tests (CBC, biochemistry profile, serum electrophoresis, urinalysis and urinary protein/creatinine ratio) were performed during all visits. Leishmania infantumspecific antibodies were assessed by an end point sera dilution ELISA method. The majority of dogs (n = 16) were classified as LeishVet stage II (moderate disease) at the time of diagnosis. Three dogs were classified as LeishVet stage III (severe disease, n = 2) or IV (very severe disease, n = 1). Results showed high and variable levels of specific antibodies at the time of diagnosis (meanAESD: 7855AE14821 ELISA units (EU)). Interestingly, a rapid significant reduction (P < 0.05) was observed at day 30 during treatment (mean AESD: 3503AE5980 EU). A continuing significant decrease of specific antibodies was also determined at days 180 (mean AE SD: 2139AE6829 EU) and 365 (mean AESD: 245AE108 EU). All dogs improved clinically with treatment with the exception of one dog that clinically relapsed at 6 months post-treatment and its specific antibodies level slightly increased. In conclusion, this study reports, for the first time, a rapid reduction of L. infantum specific antibodies after 30 days of treatment by an end point sera dilution ELISA method associated with clinical improvement. It is important also to highlight that a marked decrease of antibody levels was also noted after 6 months and 1 year of treatment.",

Canine L. infantum infection can manifest as a chronic subclinical infection, self-limiting disease, or non-self-limiting illness. A protective CD4+ T-cellmediated immune response characterized by production of inter-feron-gamma, IL-2 and TNF-alpha is believed to be present in resistant subclinical dogs while this response seems to be diminished or absent in sick dogs. However, there are few and poorly standardized assays to evaluate this response in the dog. In addition, cellular mediated immunity has been mainly investigated in subclinical or vaccinated dogs but limited information is available in sick dogs with different degrees of disease severity. The aim of this study was to investigate L. infantum-specific cellular immunity in dogs with clinical leishmaniosis at the time of diagnosis. Twenty-six dogs were diagnosed based on physical examination, routine laboratory tests (CBC, biochemistry profile, serum electrophoresis, urinalysis and urinary protein/creatinine ratio) and L. infantum-specific antibody levels measured by quantitative ELISA. Heparin whole blood was stimulated with L. infantum soluble antigen (LSA) and the mitogen concavalin A (ConA) and incubated during 5 days. Unstimulated whole blood from each dog was used as control. Supernatants were collected and IFNgamma concentration was measured with a commercial sandwich ELISA. The majority of dogs (n = 16) were classified as LeishVet stage II (moderate disease). The rest of dogs were classified as stage I (n = 3), stage III (n = 4) and stage IV (n = 2). Twelve dogs (stage I, n = 2; stage IIa: n = 9, stage III: n = 1) produced IFNgamma after stimulation with LSA (mean AE SD: 2137AE1526 pg/ mL) and ConA (meanAESD: 6596 AE 4448 pg/mL). In contrast, 13 dogs (stage IIa: n = 5; stage IIb: n = 3; stage III = n = 3; stage IV, n = 2) did not produce detectable IFN-gamma after stimulation with LSA but 12 dogs produced IFN-gamma after stimulation with ConA (mean AE SD: 5665AE4923 pg/mL) while one dog was unresponsiveness to ConA. No differences in IFN-gamma concentration were found between IFN-gamma producer and nonproducer dogs when blood was stimulated with ConA (P = 0.6). Interestingly, IFN-gamma producer sick dogs presented with a lower antibody levels (meanAESD: 1068AE1217 ELISA units (EU)) when compared with IFN-gamma non-producer sick dogs (mean AE SD: 11448AE17602 EU) but differences were not statistically significant (P = 0.1). The results of this study suggest that sick dogs with a more exaggerated humoral response and a more severe disease lack L. infantum specific IFN-gamma production in stimulated blood.",

However, dogs with advanced liver disease can present with ALT levels within reference range. Recent studies have shown the potential of circulating microRNAs as a biomarker for liver injury. Hepatocyte-derived microRNA-122 (miR-122) was identified to be liver specific with superior sensitivity over ALT levels in mice and humans. The aim of the present study was to investigate the potential for circulating miR-122 to serve as a diagnostic serum biomarker of hepatocellular injury in dogs. Hereto, liver biopsies of 46 Labrador retrievers were collected. Liver histology, including grade of hepatitis and stage of fibrosis, was reviewed by a boardcertified veterinary pathologist (TSGAMvdI). Concurrently, serum samples were collected and analyzed for ALT levels and miR-122 levels. Dogs were included into one of the following groups: normal liver and normal ALT levels (control group), liver pathology and normal ALT levels, or liver pathology and high ALT levels. Comparative statistics between groups were performed using the Mann-Whitney U test and associations between miR-122 and ALT levels, grade, stage and hepatic copper concentrations were analyzed using the Spearman's rank correlation coefficient. Logistic regression models were used to assess the accuracy of miR-122 and ALT to detect the presence of hepatocellular injury. In total, 8 dogs had normal liver histology and normal ALT levels. Thirtyeight dogs had liver pathology whereof only 14 dogs had increased ALT levels. In the high ALT group the median level of miR-122 was 57 (range, 3 -794) times higher compared to the control group (P < 0.001). Even in dogs with liver pathology and normal ALT levels, the median miR-122 level was 3 (range, 0.4 -35) times higher compared to the control group (P < 0.05). Univariate logistic regression showed that only miR-122 and not ALT level was a significant predictor for abnormal liver histology (P < 0.05).

Treatments for primary hepatitis are typically symptomatic and importantly, predicting prognosis at point of diagnosis remains challenging. In contrast to human medicine, where the type of hepatitis is defined by the inciting cause, few causes of chronic hepatitis have been identified in the dog, and the majority of cases are idiopathic. Systemic inflammation is well recognised in humans with liver disease. Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome (SIRS) is the clinical expression of the action of complex intrinsic mediators of the acute phase reaction. The presence of SIRS has been linked to a poor outcome in various liver diseases. The prevalence and predictive value of a SIRS in dogs with primary hepatitis has not been examined in dogs with liver disease. This is surprising given the accumulating evidence that SIRS is linked to the development of hepatic encephalopathy (HE) in dogs with liver disease. Although the pathogenesis of HE is not completely understood, it has been indicated that ammonia and inflammatory cytokines play a crucial role in the development of HE. HE is an important cause of morbidity and mortality in patients with liver disease.",

Outcome is generally poor in canine PLE, and there is a lack of studies identifying underlying risk factors.

Medical records for dogs seen at the Royal Veterinary College between 2005 and 2014 were reviewed to identify dogs with a diagnosis of PLE confirmed by histopathology. Dogs were included in the study if they had serum samples frozen within 30 minutes after sampling, had been kept at -80 degrees C until analysis, and if clinical activity scoring (CCE-CAI) had been recorded at the time of diagnosis. Forty-three dogs were included in the study. Follow-up with referring veterinarians was made to determine outcome of patients. Patients were divided into 2 groups: patients deceased due to PLE (poor outcome group, n = 22) and patients alive or deceased due to another disease (good outcome group, n = 21). Treatments for patients were allocated to 2 groups: one group consisted of patients who were prescribed diet only and the other group received diet and immunosuppressive agents. Samples were sent on dry ice to Michigan State University's Diagnostic Center for Population and Animal Health.

            "text": "Disclosures Canine pancreatitis is the most common exocrine pancreatic disorder. The prognosis of canine pancreatitis is variably and no logistic regression constructed severity scoring systems are available. Four hundred and thirty nine dogs diagnosed as pancreatitis with acute onset of compatible clinical signs, a positive SNAP \u00d2 cPL TM Test, and/or associated abdominal ultrasonographic abnormalities between January 2009 and December 2012 were presented at National Taiwan University Veterinary Hospital (NTUVH). One hundred and three dogs hospitalized with complete medical therapy and outcomes were selected for further analysis. The 103 dogs were divided into survival (n = 61) and non-survival (n = 42) groups. Forty-seven parameters including signalment, clinical signs, physical examinations, clinicopathological examination, complications and concurrent diseases were analyzed and compared between the 2 groups. Logistic regression analyses were performed in this study. Variables with P \u2264 0.1 were considered for further analyses. The mortality in this study was 40.8%. Age, heart rate, respiratory rate, white blood cell count, albumin, BUN, creatinine, potassium, presence of systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) and presence of oliguria or anuria were selected for constructing the scores. Continuous variables outside the reference interval were separated into quartiles to yield quartile-specific odds ratios (ORs) for survival. Based on the integer value of the OR, the scoring system was then developed by incorporating weighting factors assigned to each quartile. A predictive total score was calculated for each dog by summing all weighting factors. The total scores of each dog ranged from 10 to 70. The severity scores in this study achieved an area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) of 0.871. The optimal cut-off point for discriminating outcome was 24.5 with a sensitivity of 78.6% and specificity of 90.2%, respectively. The mortality was 84.6% with a score \u2265 25, whereas 14.1% with a score \u2264 24. There was a significant difference (P < 0.001) between the 2 groups seperated by the cut-off point. The severity scoring system of this study provides a reliable and clinical applicable method to predict clinical outcome in dogs with pancreatitis.",

Previously, we validated a cardiac troponin I (cTnI; Vet J 185:50-7, 2010) assay for sensitive and specific detection of cardiac injury in domestic animals. We found various non-cardiac diseases of dogs and cats were associated with cardiac injury detected by serum cardiac troponin I, including some cases of pancreatitis. Also, we validated the DGGR-lipase assay for cost-effective, sensitive and specific detection of pancreatitis in dogs and cats (Vet Clin Path 41: E10-11, 2012; 42:E14-15, 2013 ). Herein, we tested the hypothesis that pancreatitis was associated with cardiac injury. cTnI was measured by Advia Centaur TnI-Ultra assay; DGGR-lipase by the Randox colourimetric assay. We retrospectively analysed data from dogs and cats admitted to UCD veterinary hospital in which both cTn and lipase had been measured. Upper limit of reference range for lipase in dogs is 80 U/L; we consider 80-150 indicative of mild pancreatitis, 150-500 moderate, and >500 as marked. Upper limit of reference range for lipase in cats is 25. Reference range for cTnI is < 0.054 ug/L for dogs and cats. We consider 0.054-0.15 indicative of mild cardiac injury, 0.15-1 as moderate, and >1.0 as marked. 145 dogs and 19 cats had both lipase and cTnI measured. 78 dogs had normal troponin; 113 had normal lipase and 43 had normal lipase and normal cTnI. 32 dogs (22%) had pancreatitis as indicated by increased lipase. In 18(56%), pancreatitis was mild, in 9(28%) it was moderate, and in 5(16%) it was marked. 67 of 145 dogs had increased cTnI: mild in 33(49%), moderate in 22(33%), and marked in 12(18%). Cardiac injury in dogs with pancreatitis was absent in 28%, mild in 34%, moderate in 25%, and marked in 13%. 13 of 19 cats had normal cTn; 10 had normal lipase. 6 of 19 cats had pancreatitis, severely in 3. Lipase and cTnI was correlated (r = 0.7) for dogs and cats. We conclude that both pancreatitis and cardiac injury, as indicated by high-sensitivity and high-specificity assays Randox-DGGR-lipase and Centaur-cTnI, respectively, are not uncommon in veterinary hospital cases. We confirm and extend our previous work. Pancreatitis in dogs and cats is typically associated with cardiac injury. Severities of pancreatitis and cardiac injury are correlated. For~40% of dogs and cats with pancreatitis, cardiac injury is moderate to marked.",

While imbalances in duodenal and fecal microbial communities have been associated with mucosal inflammation, relatively little is known about alterations in mucosal bacteria seen with CE involving the ileum and colon. The aim of the present study was to use fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) techniques to investigate the composition and spatial organization of mucosal microbiota in endoscopic biopsies obtained from dogs with CE and controls. Tissue sections from the ileum and colon from 19 dogs with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), 6 dogs with granulomatous colitis (GC), 12 dogs with intestinal neoplasia, and 15 controls were studied by FISH targeting the 16S rRNA genes of total bacteria, group-specific organisms, and individual bacterial species shown to be relevant in human IBD. The numbers of mucosal bacteria were analyzed using generalized linear models for each of the colon and ileum tissues, with Spearman's rank correlation coefficients used to test the correlation between mucosal microbiota and inflammatory (CIB-DAI score, histopathology) indices. The ileal and colonic mucosa of healthy dogs and dogs with CE was predominantly colonized by bacteria localized to free and adherent mucus compartments. Dogs with CE harbored more (P < 0.05) mucosal bacteria belonging to the Clostridium-coccoides/Eubacterium rectale group, Bacteroides, Enterobacteriaceae, and Escherichia coli versus controls. Within the CE group, IBD dogs had increased (P < 0.05) Enterobacteriaceae and E. coli bacteria attached onto surface epithelia or invading within the intestinal mucosa. Bacterial invasion with E. coli was present in the ileal and colonic mucosa of dogs with GC (P < 0.05). Dogs with intestinal neoplasia had increased (P < 0.05) adherent (total bacteria, Enterobacteriaceae, E. coli) and invasive (Enterobacteriaceae, E. coli, and Bacteroides) bacteria in biopsy specimens versus all other groups. Increased numbers of total bacteria adherent to the colonic mucosa were associated with clinical disease severity (CIBDAI score) in IBD dogs (P < 0.05). These results indicate that histopathologic lesions of canine CE are associated with different populations in ileal and colonic mucosal microbiota. These spatial, segment-specific structure and differential response of select bacterial groups to intestinal inflammation may be pivotal regarding the functional consequences of these alterations in the pathogenesis of canine CE.",

Also, as for the D/ L value from back to abdomen, the highest value was found at the position of 11:00 and 1:00.

Tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion (TAPSE) is an echocardiographic measure that allows to assess right ventricular systolic function.

Thus, the goal of this study is to determine the reproducibility of the measure TAPSE in normal dogs and to determine the relationship between TAPSE and age in healthy beagle dogs. TAPSE was measured from an M-mode recording of the lateral aspect of the tricuspid valve annulus obtained through a left parasternal apical 4-chamber view. TAPSE values were averaged from measurements on 5 consecutive beats during sinus rhythm. The measurements were recorded by 2 different persons (C-V, A.; M-M F.) with different grade of experience in canine echocardiography studies.. All patients had a complete 2-dimensional and Doppler study using an Envisor CHD (Philips \u00d2 ) ultrasound system. Twenty-three healthy beagles were used.

Tetralogy of Fallot (TOF) is a congenital heart disease characterized by 4 abnormalities, i.e., pulmonic stenosis, ventricular septal defect (VSD), aortic overriding and secondary right ventricular hypertrophy, caused by anterior deviation and abnormal septation of the conal septum during the embryonic period. Few studies have reported the hemodynamic consequences and clinical outcome of TOF in small animals. The objective of this retrospective study was therefore to document the epidemiological, clinical, echo-Doppler findings, and survival, in a canine and feline population with TOF. The case records of animals diagnosed with TOF by combined use of echocardiography and Doppler examination were reviewed (2003) (2004) (2005) (2006) (2007) (2008) (2009) (2010) (2011) (2012) (2013) (2014) . Tetralogy of Fallot was identified in 31 animals (15 dogs, 16 cats). The most commonly represented breeds were Terriers for dogs (7/15, 46.7%), and Domestic Shorthair for cats (12/16, 75.0%). Most included animals (28/31, 90.3%) were clinically affected at the time of diagnosis. Pulmonic stenosis was characterized by a variable systolic Doppler-derived pressure gradient both in dogs (median [range] 106 mmHg ) and cats (109 mmHg ), and associated with hypoplasia of the pulmonary trunk in one third of the cases (35.7%). Most VSD were large, with a median VSD:aorta ratio of 0.60 [0.35-1.02] in dogs and 0.59 [0.18-1.15] in cats. Median age at death from cardiac cause was 23.4 months [3.5-92.9 ] without significant difference between dogs and cats (P = 0.298). These results suggest that in both cats and dogs TOF-related death occurs predominantly in young adult animals with major hemodynamic consequences at the time of diagnosis.",

The aim of this study was to assess whether and how radiographic and echocardiographic cardiovascular variables differ across age bands of healthy cats. A cohort of 98 clinically healthy cats were categorized into 3 groups: adolescent-adult (0.6-6 years; n = 45), middle-aged (7-10 years; n = 28), and geriatric (11-17 years; n = 25). All cats underwent a full physical examination, a complete blood count, routine biochemical profile, a baseline serum total thyroxine concentration, auscultation, non-invasive blood pressure measurements, thoracic radiography, electrocardiography, and echocardiography. Cats with hypertension, hyperthyroidism, cardiac, or renal disease were excluded from the study. Body weight, body condition score, systolic blood pressure, heart rate, and all echocardiographic indices were similar across the 3 groups. The mean (AE standard deviation [SD]) vertebral heart scale (VHS) value obtained for the geriatric group (7.7 AE 0.6) was significantly greater than that obtained for the adolescent-adult group (7.4 AE 0.4; P = 0.018). The mean ratio of the distance between the cardiac base and dorsal sternum to thoracic cavity height at the point of the cardiac base was significantly less in the middle-aged (0.64 AE 0.04) and geriatric (0.61 AE 0.05) groups than in the adolescent-adult group (0.69 AE 0.04; both P < 0.001). The mean angle between the cardiac long axis and the body axis was significantly smaller in middle-aged (40.4 AE 7.7\u00b0) and geriatric cats (40.0 AE 7.9\u00b0) than in adolescent-adult cats (53.1 AE 7.3\u00b0; both P < 0.001). The mean angle between the cardiac long axis and the sternum of middle-aged (36.8 AE 6.6\u00b0) and geriatric cats (36.2 AE 7.9\u00b0) was significantly smaller than that in adolescentadult cats (42.6 AE 5.7\u00b0; P = 0.006 and P = 0.002, respectively). Additionally, the degree of undulation of the thoracic aorta correlated positively with age (r 2 = 0.307, P = 0.003). These findings suggest that differences in the horizontal alignment of the heart, thoracic-aorta undulation, and VHS in healthy geriatric cats, relative to observations in younger cats, can be considered to be agerelated.",

No structural abnormalities of the tricuspid valve and sign of pulmonary stenosis were detected. The 2-dimensional and M-mode echocardiography showed a cardiac involvement in 3 cats. One cat, infected by A. abstrusus and T. brevior showed a mild systolic tricuspid regurgitant jet with Color Doppler of 1.64 m/sec, while another A. abstrusus-infected cat, had mild TR of 2.2 m/sec with a mean PAPs of 29 mmHg which resolved within 4 weeks after therapy. One cat diagnosed with troglostrongylosis, showed a marked right-sided cardiac enlargement of 6 mm, and a large systolic tricuspid regurgitant jet with a TR peak velocity of 3.1 m/s recorded at continuous-wave Doppler via a Color Doppler echocardiography. The minimum pressure difference between the right ventricle and the right atrium was estimated 38 mmHg and the PAPs was at least 48 mmHg. The echocardiographic and Doppler evidence of mild PH persisted at further examination performed until 3 months after diagnosis. PH is rare in cats, despite cases of reversible PH are known in cat aelurostrongylosis. In this study the first case of irreversible PH infection in a cat affected by T. brevior is presented and this finding further supports the high pathogenicity of troglostrongylosis, especially in young patients. In cats with lungworm infection, possible cardiovascular complications must be taken into account and these infections should be always considered in the differential diagnosis in cats with cardiorespiratory signs.",

Pulmonary balloon valvuloplasty (PBV) is considered to be the treatment of choice for dogs withsevere stenosis. Whether dogs with moderate stenosis benefit from PBV remains unclear, and variables such as degree of hypertrophy, valve morphology, amount of tricuspid insufficiency and presence or absence of clinical signs aregenerally used when recommendations are made to pet owners. In this study we report the effect of valve type on PBV outcome in 110 dogs treated at 3 different academic speciality cardiology practices. Baseline echocardiographic images were evaluated at each institution and valve morphology was classified as either type A (N = 78, 137.96 mmHg, range 53-278) or type B (N = 33, 153.72 mmHg, range 81-300) and 'no' (N = 87, 140 mmHg, range 53-279) or 'yes' (N = 24, 151 mmHg, range 87-300) for presence of pulmonary annular hypoplasia when diameter was compared to aortic annulus. Twenty four hours following PBV both type A (56 mmHg, range 17-210) and type B (78 mmHg, range 25-197) valves had significant reduction in gradient compared to baseline (P < 0.0001). This reduction remained significant at 30 days (A: 77 mmHg, range 22-193; B: 60 mmHg, range 30-116; P < 0.0001 for both). Dogs with annular hypoplasia (65 mmHg, range 25-197) and without annular hypoplasia (69 mmHg range 17-210) had a significant reduction in gradient 24 hours post PBV. It remained significant at 30 days (with annular hypoplasia: 77 mmHg, range 30-116; without annular hypoplasia: 61 mmHg, range 22-193; P < 0.0001 for both). When comparing to baseline, considering valve type, there was no significant difference in percent reduction in gradient for type A versus type B valves at both the 24-hour (A: 58%, range 17-88; B: 48%, range 12-82; P = 0.1014) and 30-day (A: 43%, range 23-89; B: 58%, range 33-81; P = 0.0544) recheck evaluation time points. Additionally, there was no significant difference in gradient reduction when looking only at whether or not there was annular hypoplasia at 24 hours (yes: 57%, range 24-78; no: 49%, range 17-89; P = 0.2673) and 30 days (yes: 48%, range 25-81; no: 47%, range 22-89; P = 0.4695). In conclusion, classification of dogs with PS according to valve type and annulus morphology did not help predict the 30-day response to PBV.",

Our hypothesis was that LA-FACtotal and LAEF decrease with severity of CMVD. Eighty dogs were included in a prospective observational cross-section clinical study, grouped according to CMVD severity based on echocardiographic evaluation and clinical signs. The dogs were equally distributed in each group: A, B1, B2 and C, according to American College of Veterinary Internal Medicine staging system. Indicators of LA function were calculated with the following equations: LA-FACtotal = 100 9 (LAmaximum area -LAminimum area)/LAmaximum area, measured by apical 4 view; and LAEF = 100 x (LAmaximum volume -LAminimum volume)/LAmaximum volume, by biplane area-length method from the left apical 4 and 2chamber views. LA-FACtotal showed lower values (P < 0.0001) in group C (31.88%, P25-75% = 26.47-41.12) compared with groups A (52.75%, P25-75% = 48.08-56.07), B1 (48.38%, P25-75% = 42.57-51.91) and B2 (46.15%, P25-75% = 41.17-50).

Both these results were expected. None of the cases included experienced renal damage (WRF or IRIS class change or UPC change) concomitant to episodes of CHF. The persistence of normal renal condition regardless of CHF events and therapy administration was unexpected. In conclusion, experiencing CHF seems not to directly affect renal function.

Echocardiographic evaluation of the right pulmonary artery distensibility index (RPAD index) was recently described as a valuable method for early detection and severity evaluation of pulmonary arterial hypertension in dogs. RPAD index is calculated as the percentage change in diameter of the right pulmonary artery (RPA) between systole and diastole, obtained by M-mode echocardiography from the right parasternal long axis view. The aim of this study was to compare the RPAD index obtained by 2 different echocardiographic views in dogs. The study design was a prospective, multicenter, observational study. Forty-five clientowned dogs from different breeds were included: 31 dogs with heart disease and 14 healthy dogs. Two different right parasternal views, long axis (RPLA) and short axis (RPSA), were used to measure the RPAD index. From the RPLA view (method 1) and RPSA view (method 2) a short axis and a long axis image were respectively optimized for the right pulmonary artery. The RPAD index was calculated by M-mode as the percentage change in diameter of the right pulmonary artery: [(systolic diameter -diastolic diameter)/ systolic diameter]*100. Measurements were done off-line as an average of 5 consecutive cardiac cycles by a single investigator blinded to the dogs' diagnosis. A Pearson and a Bland-Altman test were used to assess correlation and agreement between the 2 methods, respectively. Intra-and inter-observer measurement variability was quantified by average coefficient of variation (CV). Level of significance was set at P < 0.05. M-mode evaluation of the RPAD index was satisfactorily obtained by both methods in all dogs. Pearson test showed a strong positive linear correlation between the values of RPAD index obtained from both methods (r 2 = 0.9346, P < 0.0001). Bland-Altman test showed a good agreement between the 2 methods in estimating RPAD index (bias = 0.51%, SD = 2.96%, 95% limits of agreement = \u00c05.30, 6.33%). The mean difference between the 2 methods was 0.51% (95% confidence interval = \u00c00.35; 1.35). Intra-and inter-observer measurement variability was clinically acceptable (CV<10%).The study showed a good agreement between short axis and long axis M-mode evaluation of RPA. Both methods can be used interchangeably to evaluate RPAD index. Further studies are needed to evaluate the RPAD index in a larger population of healthy dogs and the diagnostic and prognostic role of this echocardiographic parameter in dogs with different types of pulmonary hypertension.",

Our study aimed to find (1) if some CNS diseases could be associated with a selected group of common microbial or viral pathogens in dogs and (2) if CNS diseases have any characteristic profile with regard to 2 parameters, C-reactive protein (CRP) and IgA, that are reported to be potentially useful but unspecific markers of CNS diseases. We analysed 210 cerebrospinal fluid samples obtained from dogs with varying neurological signs between June and November 2014. Real-time PCR was employed with probes for Toxoplasma gondii, Neospora caninum, Anaplasma phagocytophilum and Canine distemper virus. IgG-antibodies to Tickborne encephalitis virus (TBE) were assayed and IgA titres were measured using ELISA, while CRP concentrations were determined by immunoturbidimetric assay. The dogs had a median age of 4 years (range: 0.5-14) and comprised 60 breeds most frequently involving Chihuahuas, Labrador Retrievers, Bernese Mountain Dogs and Boxers. Gender distribution was 22.4% female, 12.9% spayed bitches, 42.8% male, 15.7% neutered male, and 6.2% non-identified. None of the cases were PCR-positive for Toxoplasma gondii or Canine distemper virus. One dog was positive for Anaplasma phagocytophilum and another for Neospora caninum. Antibodies to TBE virus were within the borderline range in 6/210 dogs. The 210 dogs could be divided into 2 age groups: 60 (=28.6%) for young dogs (<2 years, median 1 year) and 150 (=71.4%) for older dogs (\u22652 years, median 6 years). IgAhigh (>0.1 mg/dl) cases represented 95% and 90% for young and older dogs, respectively. CRP-high (>1.0 mg/l) cases were almost half and equal: 51.7% and 56.0% in young and older dogs, respectively. Compared with older dogs, young dogs had higher levels of CRP (P = 0.022) and IgA (P = 0.054). Within the IgA-high cohorts, CRP-high and CRP-low cases distributed almost equally (46.7% versus 48.3%) in young dogs but disproportionate (52.0% versus 38.0%) in older dogs. There were no [IgA-low/CRP-low] cases in young dogs but 6.0% in older dogs. Our present data suggest that (1) canine CNS disorders were largely characterized by high IgA and particularly in young dogs (2) inflammatory types (CRP-high) were almost equal in both groups and (3) although the significance remains yet to be determined, pathogens like Anaplasma phagocytophilum and Neospora caninum could be detected in a few cases of canine CNS disorders.",

This survey assesses the online search behaviour of French pet owners for their pets' health and its influence on a veterinary consultation. In April 2013, 260 French pet owners coming in a veterinary teaching hospital for a medical or a surgical consultation were surveyed. 239 (91.9%) owners fulfilled the questionnaire on a voluntary basis. The survey contained 26 questions dealing with 3 topics: the online search behaviour of owners for their pets' health, their perception of the information found online and the internet's influence on a consultation and on the veterinarian/client relationship.73.6% of owners use the Internet to obtain information on their pets' health. Among them, 32.6% use it rarely and 28.9% occasionally. They mainly look for information on a disease (51.1%), a symptom (51.1%), a breed (50%) or a nutritional advice (48.9%). 79.7% of owners try to verify the accuracy of the information found, most often by questioning their veterinarian (82.8%). Few owners (15.4%) think that online information is always trustworthy. Most of the research (81.9%) is randomly made, websites being found through search engines. The majority of pet owners (81.3%) aren't aware of any health certification label for websites. Internet enables certain pet owners to feel more at ease with their pets' health care: they ask more questions to their veterinarian (88.9%) and feel more involved in medical choices (55.6%). 37.9% of owners consider that the Internet can positively impact their relationship with the veterinarian. Relief is the most common (73.6%) emotional response to online research for medical information. However, 58.8% of owners feel overwhelmed by the amount of information found, 56% are confused and 35.2% frightened by the serious or graphic nature of the information found online.",

The objective of this retrospective study was to better define the spectrum of diseases associated with canine pancytopenia, to establish possible clinicopathological discriminators for the common causes and to investigate if the severity of pancytopenia or the underlying disease were associated with the clinical outcome (death or survival). Medical records of dogs with a comprehensive diagnostic investigation admitted in a veterinary teaching hospital were retrospectively reviewed. Pancytopenia was defined by a hematocrit (HCT) <37% (<30% for dogs <5 months of age), white blood cell counts (WBC) <6,000/lL and platelet counts (PLT) <200,000/lL. A control group of 238 dogs without any evidence of blood cytopenia(s) was also established. In total, 119 pancytopenic dogs were studied. Bone marrow aspiration cytology was examined in 42 cases and aplasia of all hematopoietic lineages was observed in 22 (52.4%) dogs. The most common diagnoses included monocytic ehrlichiosis (CME) (n = 43), leishmaniosis (CanL) (n = 28), parvoviral enteritis (PE) (n = 19), and concurrent CME and CanL (n = 12). Mixed breed dogs were more likely to develop pancytopenia as compared to purebreds and pancytopenic dogs tended to be younger than the controls (conditional dependent logistic regression model, P = 0.013 and P = 0.001, respectively). Among the most common diseases associated with pancytopenia, the mean WBC counts were significantly lower in dogs with CME and PE compared to dogs with CanL (one way ANOVA with Bonferroni test for multiple comparisons, P = 0.004 and P = 0.03, respectively), while PLT counts were significantly lower in CME compared to CanL (P<0.0001) or PE (P < 0.0001). Total protein concentrations were significantly lower in dogs with PE compared to CME (P < 0.0001) and CanL (P < 0.0001). Using a univariable logistic regression analysis model, no association was established between the underlying disease and the final outcome. However, higher HCT (by at least one percentage unit), WBC (by at least 1,000/lL) and PLT (by at least 10,000/lL) values tended to significantly increase the odds of survival (P = 0.025, P < 0.0001 and P = 0.006, respectively). In the present study, CME, CanL and PE were the major causes of canine pancytopenia. Potentially useful diagnostic indicators included severe leucopenia (CME, PE), thrombocytopenia (CME) and hypoproteinemia (PE).",

The median lifespan of domestic dogs has been estimated to 9-12 years, but little is known about risk factors for mortality in aged dogs: most mortality studies in dogs have been carried out among diseased dogs (renal or heart diseases, cancers, post-operative death). To determine which characteristics are associated with mortality in a priori healthy aged dogs, a prospective cohort study has been conducted in 116 guide dogs, followed from a systematic geriatric examination (GE) to either (all-cause) death or cut-off date (July 16 th , 2013) . Survival analyses (Kaplan-Meier estimators, log-rank tests, and multivariate Cox proportional hazards models) were used to assess the associations with time to death. Median age at GE was 8.9 years, all dogs were neutered, and 50% were female. The majority of dogs were Golden Retriever (n = 48) and Labrador Retriever (n = 27). Among these 116 dogs, 16% were obese, 47% presented skin nodules and 90% used bus as transportation. A total of 76 dogs died during follow-up, leading to a median survival time from GE of 4.4 years. After adjustment for demographic and biochemical variables (age, sex, total proteins, cholesterol and ALP), an increased alanine amionotransferase level (\u2265102 UI/L; adjusted Hazard Ratio [aHR], 6.0), presenting skin nodules (aHR, 2.3), and not being a Labrador (aHR, 3.3) were independently associated with a shorter time to death (P < 0.05). Public transportation tended to be associated with mortality (aHR, 3.0; P = 0.06), highlighting the importance of environment in mortality.

Laryngoscopic and bronchoscopic findings in dogs examined by the author between 2001 and 2014 were evaluated for the presence or absence of laryngeal abnormalities. Dogs that presented for evaluation of inspiratory difficulty or panting were excluded from analysis. Clinical diagnoses of inflammatory airway disease, airway collapse, airway infection, eosinophilic bronchopneumopathy or a combination of these disorders were obtained through bronchoscopy and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid analysis. Detection rates for laryngeal abnormalities were compared among disease groups using Chi Square analysis and Fisher's exact test, with significance set at P < 0.05.

Bronchiectasis is a poorly characterized disease in dogs identified by airway dilatation on radiographs, computed tomography, bronchoscopy, or histopathology. Little is known about underlying disease processes associated with bronchiectasis in dogs. Medical records from dogs presented to UC Davis were searched for identification of bronchiectasis. Underlying disease processes and clinical diagnoses were obtained through review of the history, physical examination, respiratory endoscopy and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid analysis and microbiology. Historical reports, results of imaging, bronchoscopy and fluid analysis, and scrutiny of pathologic and clinical diagnoses were comprehensively evaluated to identify the most likely underlying disease process associated with bronchiectasis. Between 2003 and 2014, bronchiectasis was diagnosed in 86/621 dogs (14%) that had bronchoscopy performed. Dogs ranged in age from 0.5 to 14 years (median 10 years) with 1/85 dogs < 6 months, 16/85 dogs (19%) 1-5 years, 37/85 dogs (43%) 5.1-10 years of age and 31/85 dogs (37%) over 10 years of age. Dog breeds affected more than once included 6 Labrador retrievers, 5 Cocker spaniels, 4 Golden retrievers and 4 Standard Poodles. Duration of cough ranged from 3 days to 10 years (median 6 months). Underlying disease processes included pneumonia in 45/86 (52%) dogs, inflammatory airway disease in 24/86 (28%) dogs, and eosinophilic bronchopneumopathy in 10/86 (12%) dogs. Twenty-three of 85 dogs (27%) had positive bacterial cultures, with isolation of Streptococcus (n = 6) and enteric species (n = 5) most commonly.

Oxidative stress in the body represents the imbalance between the production of reactive oxidative species and the ability of antioxidant defense mechanisms to detoxify the reactive intermediates. Oxidative stress is involved in the pathogenesis of many diseases, including hemolytic anemia, atherosclerosis, tissue reperfusion injury and has also carcinogenic potential. Several studies have clearly shown an association between obstructive sleep apnea syndrome in humans and oxidative stress, but detailed underlying pathomechanism remains unclear. Due to the consideration of brachycephalic dogs as an animal model of human OSAS, this study was designed to evaluate oxidative stress (Paraoxonase type-1 activity; PON1 and total antioxidant status; TAC) in brachycephalic dogs with Brachycephalic Airways Obstructive Syndrome (BAOS) before and after surgery compared to control dogs.",

Canine idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (CIPF) is a progressive interstitial lung disease mainly affecting West Highland white terriers (WHWTs). The CIPF course varies greatly among dogs from rapid deterioration to slowly progressive forms and the survival time from onset of clinical signs ranges from a few months to several years. In human IPF, increased chemokine (CC-motif) ligand 2 (CCL2) concentrations in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) are indicative of a poor outcome and serum concentrations are correlated with clinical parameters of lung function. In dogs, serum and BALF CCL2 concentrations were shown to be elevated in WHWTs with CIPF compared with healthy WHWTs. The aim of the present study was to investigate whether serum CCL2 concentrations measured in WHWTs with CIPF at diagnosis (1) can be used as an indicator of prognosis and (2) correlate with lung function parameters. CCL2 concentrations were determined by ELISA (Canine CCL2 Quantikine ELISA kit, R&D Systems) in the serum of 60 WHWTs suspected of CIPF (median age 11.7 years, range 5.7 -14.5), for which a follow-up was available (median follow-up time 8.6 months, range 0 -71.8). Serum sampling extended from May 2007 to January 2015. CIPF diagnosis was confirmed by thoracic high resolution computed tomography, lung histopathology, or both examinations in 17, 6 and 27 WHWTs respectively. Kaplan-Meier analysis was conducted to investigate differences in survival times according to serum CCL2 concentrations at diagnosis. Spearman analysis was used to assess correlations between serum CCL2 concentrations and lung function parameters, namely the distance walked in the 6-minute walking test (6MWD) and the arterial partial pressure of oxygen (pO 2 ). Among the 60 CIPF WHWTs included, 31 died or were euthanized for CIPF-related reason, 12 died or were euthanized for non-CIPF-related reason and 17 were still alive at the end of the study. The median survival of WHWTs with CIPF-related death or euthanasia was 6.4 (range 0.4 -71.9) months from diagnosis. Serum CCL2 concentrations above 700 pg/mL were significantly associated with a shorter survival time in WHWTs affected with CIPF (P = 0.02). A weak negative correlation was found between serum CCL2 concentrations and the 6MWD (r = \u00c00.382, P = 0.03, n = 31), while no correlation was observed with arterial pO 2 values (n = 49). In conclusion, serum CCL2 concentration provides prognostic information in WHWTs suffering from CIPF, while this marker is weakly correlated with the clinically lung function parameters available in the present study.",

In controls, GGO was mild and localised mainly in cranial lobes. In CIPF WHWTs, GGO was mild, moderate or severe in 2, 4 and 5 dogs respectively, without lobe predilection. Consolidation was observed in 5/11 CIPF WHWTs but not in controls (P = 0.020) and was mild (3/5) to moderate (2/5). A mosaic pattern, suggestive of air trapping, was noticed in 8/11 CIPF WHWTs but not in controls (P = 0.001) and was mild, moderate or severe in 3, 2 and 3 WHWTs respectively, without lobe predilection. Nodules were present in 3/11 CIPF WHWTs but not in controls. Reticulation, subpleural bands and parenchymal bands were noticed in 1, 1, and 3/11 CIPF WHWTs respectively. Honeycombing, emphysema, pleural effusion and pleural thickening were never observed. Bronchial wall thickening and mild bronchiectasis were present in 6/11 and 3/11 CIPF WHWTs respectively but not in controls (P = 0.008 and P = 0.09). The overall T-HRCT S quality was good in 10/17 examinations compared with 16/20 for T-HRCT GA (P = 0.160). The presence of motion artefacts was higher for T-HRCT S (P < 0.001), but were most frequently graded as mild (P < 0.001). T-HRCT S allowed identification of a mosaic pattern in 2 additional CIPF WHWTs, while consolidation could not be identified in 2 others. There was no difference in identification or gradation for the other features between T-HRCT GA and T-HRCT S . In conclusion, GGO, consolidation, mosaic pattern and bronchial wall thickening are the main T-HRCT features of CIPF in WHWTs. Honeycombing, the major feature of IPF in humans, was never observed, which suggests a different pathophysiology between the 2 entities. T-HRCT S images are in accordance with T-HRCT GA and can be used for CIPF diagnosis.",

Case files from 2005 to 2014 were searched for dogs with the diagnosis of mesenterial LAd/LAb based on cytology and/or histopathology. Of 24 cases identified, 5 had to be excluded due to incomplete data. The remaining dogs were of mixed breed (n = 6), small Munsterlander (n = 4) and one each of other breeds. Nine dogs were male and 10 female. Median age was 47 months (range . Diagnosis was based on fine needle aspiration (FNA; n = 9), histopathology (n = 1) or both (n = 9). Significant findings in the dogs' history included gastrointestinal signs (n = 2), 1 puppy whose mother had mastitis, bite wounds/abscesses of the skin (n = 2), pulmonic stenosis (n = 1) and orthopaedic diseases (n = 3). Most common presenting complaints were lethargy (n = 13), hyperthermia (n = 12), diarrhoea (n = 7), vomiting/nausea (n = 6), inappetence/anorexia (n = 5), back/abdominal pain (n = 4) and lameness (n = 2). Diagnostic tests performed included haematology/serum biochemistry (n = 19), thoracic (n = 12) and abdominal (n = 7) radiographs, abdominal ultrasound (n = 19), CT/MRI (n = 3), FNAs of other organs (n = 7), urinalysis (n = 12) with culture (n = 7), coagulation profiles (n = 5), orthopaedic radiographs (n = 2), cPL (n = 5), blood cultures (n = 1), and CSF/joint taps (n = 2). Dogs were retrospectively divided into group A (n = 9): dogs with no other disease than LAd/LAb (\"idiopathic\") and group B (n = 10): dogs with other diseases diagnosed simultaneously. These included neoplasia (carcinoma n = 1, lymphoma n = 2, leiomysarcoma n = 1, histiocytic neoplasia n = 1, prostate carcinoma n = 1), gastroenteritis (n = 3), presumed pancreatitis (n = 2), purulent monoarthritis (n = 1), purulent hepatitis/ splenitis (n = 2), fungal infection at a distant site (n = 1), and mycobacteriosis (n = 1). Eleven dogs received surgical treatment and antibiotics, and 8 dogs conservative medical management consisting of supportive treatment and antibiotics. All dogs were discharged alive. Dogs in group A were hospitalized longer (mean 8 days, SD 3.4) than dogs in group B (mean 3 days, SD 2.2) (P = 0.004). The median follow-up time was 67 days (4-784 days). There was no difference in pretreatment with antibiotics or anti-inflammatories between groups. t-tests or Kruskall-Wallis tests showed that dogs in group A were borderline significantly younger (P = 0.052), had significantly higher respiratory rate (P = 0.004), rectal temperature (P = 0.007), monocyte count (P = 0.014) and CRP concentration (P = 0.027) than dogs in group B. The small Munsterlander had an odds ratio of 32 over other breeds to suffer from LAd/LAb. In conclusion, idiopathic mesenterial LAd/LAb was seen in young dogs with hyperthermia and gastrointestinal signs. Diagnosis of purulent LAd/LAb on FNA does not exclude the presence of another underlying pathogenesis.",

The tumor-associated inflammatory response had the effect of enhancing mammary tumorigenesis, helping incipient neoplasias to acquire hallmark capabilities, both in human and dogs. T-cells migration to the tumor site and the following activation may be the essential requirement for their promoting effect on tumors. In human breast cancer the signaling pathways of c-kit have been described as possibly being involved in differentiation, migration, survival, and maturation of T-cells and other inflammatory cells into tumor sites. In order to clarify this subject in canine mammary tumors (CMT), 80 malignant neoplasms were studied by using immunohistochemistry comparing the intratumoral CD3+ Tlymphocytes and c-kit expression together with VEGF, microvessel density (MVD) and clinicopathological characteristics of tumor aggressiveness. CD3+ T cells and high c-kit immunoexpression revealed a positive and statistically significant correlation with VEGF (r = 0.503, P < 0.0001; r = 0.284, P = 0.023 for CD3 and c-kit respectively) and CD31 (r = 0.654, P < 0.0001; r = 0.365, P = 0.003 for CD3 and c-kit respectively). A statistically significant association (P = 0.039) and a positive correlation (r = 0.263, P = 0.039) between CD3+ T-lymphocytes and c-kit was also observed. Tumors with high c-kit expression showed higher counts of CD3+ T-cells. The MVD of high CD3/VEGF tumors was significantly more elevated (P < 0.0001). A similar association was observed for high c-kit/VEGF tumors (P < 0.001). In this study high CD3/VEGF, high c-kit/VEGF and high CD3/c-kit tumors were statistically significantly associated with elevated grade of malignancy (P < 0.0001 for CD3/VEGF, c-kit/VEGF and CD3/ckit), presence of neoplastic intravascular emboli (P < 0.0001 for CD3/VEGF and CD3/c-kit; P = 0.002 for c-kit/VEGF) and presence of lymph node metastasis (P < 0.0001 for CD3/VEGF, c-kit/ VEGF and CD3/c-kit). Tumors with high CD3/VEGF (P = 0.006), high c-kit/VEGF (P < 0.0001) and high CD3/c-kit (P = 0.002) expression were associated with shorter OS time. Inter-estingly the group of tumors with high c-kit/VEGF retained their significance by multivariate analysis arising as independent predictor of OS. Results of this study suggest that T-lymphocytes may share common signaling pathways with c-kit and VEGF in CMT progression and may contribute to increased angiogenesis, aggression and shorter OS in these tumors.",

FoxP3 regulatory T cells (FoxP3Treg) are a distinct group of T lymphocytes that have immunosuppressive properties. Normally this cells work for prevention of harmful autoimmune responses, however can also interfere with beneficial immune responses such as anti-tumor immunity. In human breast cancer these cells play a crucial role in tumor progression. In canine mammary tumors (CMT) there are only a few studies and this topic are not welldocumented. In this study we included 80 malignant CMT and studied, by immunohistochemistry, the intratumoral FoxP3 expression together with vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), microvessel density (MVD, by CD31 antibody) and several clinicopathological characteristics. Abundant FoxP3Treg cells was statistically associated with presence of tumor necrosis (P = 0.004), nuclear grade (P = 0.001), poor differentiation of tumors (P < 0.0001), high mitotic grade (P < 0.0001), high histological grade of malignancy (P < 0.0001), presence of neoplastic intravascular emboli (P < 0.0001) and presence of lymph node metastasis (P < 0.0001). Intratumoral FoxP3 levels were correlated with the levels of VEGF (r = 0.427; P < 0.0001) and intratumoral MVD (r = 0.520; P < 0.0001). Additionally tumors with abundant FoxP3Treg cells were associated with shorter overall survival (OS) time (P = 0.0001). Results suggest that Treg cells play a role in CMT progression and may contribute to increased angiogenesis and aggression in these tumors. The association of intratumoral FoxP3 expression with shorter OS of animals suggests a utility of Treg cells activity as a prognostic marker.",

The only published study in Chile was carried out in 30 cats, with prevalences by PCR of 3.3% to Mhf, and 10% to CMhm.The aim of this study was to perform molecular detection of haemoplasmas in cats from Valdivia, southern Chile. Blood samples were taken from 384 cats and used for haemoplasmas DNA detection by Quantitative Real Time PCR (qPCR) at Universidad Austral de Chile. qPCR protocol was based on detection of feline DNA targeting 28S Housekeeping gene and Mycoplasma spp. 16S rRNA gene (universal primers, MY16SF forward, MY16SR1 y MY16SR2, both reverse) by SYBR Green method. The melting Temperature (Tm) analysis allowed identifying the infecting Mycoplasma species (Mhf, CMhm, CMt). It was not posible to identify haemoplasmas species on co infected cats, so a second qPCR specie specific protocol was applied on these samples. Second qPCR protocol was based on 16S rRNA gene, with specific primers to detect Mhf, CMhm, CMt and CMhp. All samples (384/384) were positive to 28S gene, proving presence of cat DNA. From the 384 cats, 15.1% (58/384) were positive to haemoplasmas, where 7.8% (30/384) corresponded to CMhm (Tm 73.5-75.0\u00b0C), 4.4% (17/ 384) to Mhf (Tm 75.0-76.5\u00b0C), 2% (4/384) to CMt (Tm 76.5-78.0\u00b0C) and 1.8% (7/384) to co infections. Associations between CMhm+Mhf, CMhm+CMt, CMhm+CMhp and CMhm+Mhf+ CMhp were detected on co infected animals. These results agree with those found in previous reports from Chile, Europe, EUA and Brazil, where CMhm is the most prevalent species and co infections are less frequent. Valdivia cats are infected by 4 different haemoplasma species and CMt and CMhp are reported for the first time in Chile.Founding: DID UACh, Project S-2014-25",

Clinical manifestations of canine visceral leishmaniasis (CanL) are non-specific and include progressive weight loss, anemia, lymphadenomegaly, hepatosplenomegaly, dermatological, renal and ocular alterations. Cardiac lesions resulting in clinical signs has been scarcely described in dogs with VL, and the presence of the parasite in the cardiac tissue has been involved in few reports. Accordingly, the present study aimed to evaluate histopathological abnormalities in cardiac tissue from dogs naturally infected by Leishmania infantum chagasi. A total of 20 dogs were evaluated. All dogs were symptomatic but no one presented clinical signs of cardiac involvement. In compliance with a federal law and under the owners' signed consent, all dogs were submitted to euthanasia and comprehensive post-mortem evaluation. Samples from right atrium free wall (RA), right ventricle free wall (RV), interventricular septum (IVS) and left ventricle free wall (LV) were collected and evaluated. Tissue samples were fixed in formalin, embedded in paraffin, sectioned at 5 mm, and stained with hematoxylin and eosin (HE) and Anti-Leishmania immunohistochemistry was also performed. The study was approved by the Ethics Committee in Animal Experimentation and Animal Welfare (protocol number 0463/2013). Histopathological changes were observed in at least one of the 4 evaluated cardiac regions in 75% (15/20) of the dogs. The most frequent cardiac injury was an inflammatory reaction, characterized by the presence of mononuclear cell infiltrate in different degrees. Of the evaluated regions, RA was the one with the highest incidence of histopathological changes, observed in 80% (12/15) of the animals, followed by RV, LV and SIV, affected in 73.3% (11/15), 66.7% (10/15) and 53.3% (8/15) of the dogs, respectively. Immunohistochemistry revealed amastigotes in the cardiac tissue in 70% (14/20) of the dogs. A positive correlation was found between cardiac lesions and the presence of amastigotes in the myocardium (P < 0.05).",

The combination of meglumine antimoniate and allopurinol is consid-ered the most effective therapy for canine leishmaniosis and constitutes the first line protocol against this disease. Allopurinol is a parasitostatic drug used in long-term to maintain low parasite loads and to avoid clinical relapses. Traditionally, allopurinol is considered a very safe drug in the dog. However, some reports indicate that xanthinuria and xanthine urolithiasis is produced after prolonged therapy with allopurinol in the dog. The aim of this prospective study was to evaluate the prevalence of urinary adverse effects of allopurinol treatment (10 mg/kg/BID/PO) in dogs with leishmaniosis. Diagnosis was made by compatible clinicopathological abnormalitites with leishmaniosis and high Leishmania infantum-specific antibody levels assessed by quantitative ELISA. Once leishmaniosis was diagnosed, a close follow-up (day 0, 30, 90, 180 and 360 during treatment) including physical examination, baseline laboratory tests (CBC, biochemistry profile, serum electrophoresis, urinalysis, urinary protein/creatinine ratio) and abdominal ultrasound was performed. In our preliminary results, 13 dogs were included. Dogs did not present any urinary abnormalities based on biochemistry profile, urinalysis and abdominal ultrasound at the time of diagnosis. Four out of 13 presented xanthinuria (day-30 (n = 3), day-90 (n = 4), and day-180 (n = 4)). Two out of 13 dogs presented renal mineralization at day-90 of treatment. Two out of 13 dogs presented bladder urolithiasis since day-90 of treatment. Xanthinuria was presented initially in all dogs that developed renal mineralization or bladder urolithiasis. Dogs with renal mineralization and urolithiasis were treated with a restricted protein diet and, so far, they did not develop renal disease.",

Assessment of systolic arterial blood pressure (SAP) is an important tool in small animal internal medicine practice, especially with diseases or clinical conditions that can cause hypertension or hypotension. The Doppler method is noninvasive and has several advantages compared to oscillometric method. There are few studies about the effect of body position on SAP in conscious dogs. The hypothesis was that animal positioning during measurement alters SAP values. The study design was prospective and randomized regarding order of positioning measurements. One hundred and twenty client-owned, conscious, healthy or sick adult dogs, weighing up to 10 kg were included. SAP was recorded by Doppler ultrasonography following American College of Veterinary Internal Medicine consensus statement with animals positioned in sternal recumbency, right lateral recumbency and with the dog laying down on owner 0 s lap. The order of body position was raffled at the time of measurement. Five consecutive measurements on each body position were performed always on left forelimb and the average was calculated. SAP values were higher in sternal recumbency (153 mmHg, P 25%-75% = 134-176.5; P < 0.0126) compared to those obtained on the owner 0 s lap (139 mmHg, P 25%-75% =125.5-159.8), and both were similar to right lateral recumbency (141 mmHg, P 25%-75% =125-159). These results suggest that SAP measurement obtained on owner 0 s lap or right lateral recumbency can be used on clinic routine, but SAP measurement obtained on sternal recumbency should be avoided, because such measures may be overestimated.",

Outcome is generally poor in canine PLE, and there is a lack of studies identifying underlying risk factors. The hypothesis of this study was that low vitamin D 3 serum concentrations could be a risk factor for bad outcome in such patients. Medical records for dogs seen at the Royal Veterinary College between 2005 and 2014 were reviewed to identify dogs with a diagnosis of PLE confirmed by histopathology. Dogs were included in the study if they had serum samples frozen within 30 minute after sampling, had been kept at \u00c080 degrees C until analysis, and if clinical activity scoring (CCE-CAI) had been recorded at the time of diagnosis. Forty-three dogs were included in the study. Follow-up with referring veterinarians was made to determine outcome of patients. Patients were divided into two groups: patients deceased due to PLE (poor outcome group, n = 22) and patients alive or deceased due to another disease (good outcome group, n = 21). Treatments for patients were allocated to two groups: one group consisted of patients who were prescribed diet only and the other group received diet and immunosuppressive agents. Samples were sent on dry ice to Michigan State University's Diagnostic Center for Population and Animal Health. Ionised calcium (iCa) was measured using an ion specific electrode and 25(OH)D was measured using a commercially available radio-immunoassay that has been validated for use in veterinary medicine. Comparisons of outcome groups for age, CCECAI, treatment, serum 25(OH)D and iCa were performed using a Mann-Whitney U test or Chi 2 .

The prognosis of canine pancreatitis is variably and no logistic regression constructed severity scoring systems are available. Four hundred and thirty nine dogs diagnosed as pancreatitis with acute onset of compatible clinical signs, a positive SNAP \u00d2 cPL[TRADEMARK] Test, and/or associated abdominal ultrasonographic abnormalities between January 2009 and December 2012 were presented at National Taiwan University Veterinary Hospital (NTUVH). One hundred and three dogs hospitalized with complete medical therapy and outcomes were selected for further analysis. The 103 dogs were divided into survival (n = 61) and non-survival (n = 42) groups. Forty-seven parameters including signalment, clinical signs, physical examinations, clinicopathological examination, complications and concurrent diseases were analyzed and compared between the two groups. Logistic regression analyses were performed in this study. Variables with P \u2264 0.1 were considered for further analyses. The mortality in this study was 40.8%. Age, heart rate, respiratory rate, white blood cell count, albumin, BUN, creatinine, potassium, presence of systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) and presence of oliguria or anuria were selected for constructing the scores. Continuous variables outside the reference interval were separated into quartiles to yield quartile-specific odds ratios (ORs) for survival. Based on the integer value of the OR, the scoring system was then developed by incorporating weighting factors assigned to each quartile. A predictive total score was calculated for each dog by summing all weighting factors. The total scores of each dog ranged from 10 to 70. The severity scores in this study achieved an area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) of 0.871. The optimal cut-off point for discriminating outcome was 24.5 with a sensitivity of 78.6% and specificity of 90.2%, respectively. The mortality was 84.6% with a score \u226525, whereas 14.1% with a score \u226424. There was a significant difference (P < 0.001) between the two groups seperated by the cut-off point.

Previously, we validated a cardiac troponin I (cTnI; Vet J 185:50-7, 2010) assay for sensitive and specific detection of cardiac injury in domestic animals. We found various non-cardiac diseases of dogs and cats were associated with cardiac injury detected by serum cardiac troponin I, including some cases of pancreatitis. Also, we validated the DGGR-lipase assay for cost-effective, sensitive and specific detection of pancreatitis in dogs and cats (Vet Clin Path 41:E10-11, 2012; 42:E14-15, 2013 ). Herein, we tested the hypothesis that pancreatitis was associated with cardiac injury. cTnI was measured by Advia Centaur TnI-Ultra assay; DGGR-lipase by the Randox colourimetric assay. We retrospectively analysed data from dogs and cats admitted to UCD veterinary hospital in which both cTn and lipase had been measured. Upper limit of reference range for lipase in dogs is 80 U/L; we consider 80-150 indicative of mild pancreatitis, 150-500 moderate, and >500 as marked. Upper limit of reference range for lipase in cats is 25. Reference range for cTnI is <0.054 ug/L for dogs and cats. We consider 0.054-0.15 indicative of mild cardiac injury, 0.15-1 as moderate, and >1.0 as marked. 145 dogs and 19 cats had both lipase and cTnI measured. Seventy-eight dogs had normal troponin; 113 had normal lipase and 43 had normal lipase and normal cTnI. 32 dogs (22%) had pancreatitis as indicated by increased lipase. In 18(56%), pancreatitis was mild, in 9(28%) it was moderate, and in 5(16%) it was marked. Sixty-seven of 145 dogs had increased cTnI: mild in 33(49%), moderate in 22 (33%), and marked in 12(18%). Cardiac injury in dogs with pancreatitis was absent in 28%, mild in 34%, moderate in 25%, and marked in 13%. 13 of 19 cats had normal cTn; 10 had normal lipase. 6 of 19 cats had pancreatitis, severely in 3. Lipase and cTnI was correlated (r = 0.7) for dogs and cats. We conclude that both pancreatitis and cardiac injury, as indicated by high-sensitivity and high-specificity assays Randox-DGGR-lipase and Centaur-cTnI, respectively, are not uncommon in veterinary hospital cases. We confirm and extend our previous work. Pancreatitis in dogs and cats is typically associated with cardiac injury. Severities of pancreatitis and cardiac injury are correlated. For~40% of dogs and cats with pancreatitis, cardiac injury is moderate to marked.",

While imbalances in duodenal and fecal microbial communities have been associated with mucosal inflammation, relatively little is known about alterations in mucosal bacteria seen with CE involving the ileum and colon. The aim of the present study was to use fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) techniques to investigate the composition and spatial organization of mucosal microbiota in endoscopic biopsies obtained from dogs with CE and controls. Tissue sections from the ileum and colon from 19 dogs with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), 6 dogs with granulomatous colitis (GC), 12 dogs with intestinal neoplasia, and 15 controls were studied by FISH targeting the 16S rRNA genes of total bacteria, group-specific organisms, and individual bacterial species shown to be relevant in human IBD. The numbers of mucosal bacteria were analyzed using generalized linear models for each of the colon and ileum tissues, with Spearman's rank correlation coefficients used to test the correlation between mucosal microbiota and inflammatory (CIB-DAI score, histopathology) indices. The ileal and colonic mucosa of healthy dogs and dogs with CE was predominantly colonized by bacteria localized to free and adherent mucus compartments. Dogs with CE harbored more (P < 0.05) mucosal bacteria belonging to the Clostridium-coccoides/Eubacterium rectale group, Bacteroides, Enterobacteriaceae, and Escherichia coli versus controls. Within the CE group, IBD dogs had increased (P < 0.05) Enterobacteriaceae and E. coli bacteria attached onto surface epithelia or invading within the intestinal mucosa. Bacterial invasion with E. coli was present in the ileal and colonic mucosa of dogs with GC (P < 0.05). Dogs with intestinal neoplasia had increased (P < 0.05) adherent (total bacteria, Enterobacteriaceae, E. coli) and invasive (Enterobacteriaceae, E. coli, and Bacteroides) bacteria in biopsy specimens versus all other groups. Increased numbers of total bacteria adherent to the colonic mucosa were associated with clinical disease severity (CIBDAI score) in IBD dogs (P < 0.05). These results indicate that histopathologic lesions of canine CE are associated with different populations in ileal and colonic mucosal microbiota. These spatial, segment-specific structure and differential response of select bacterial groups to intestinal inflammation may be pivotal regarding the functional consequences of these alterations in the pathogenesis of canine CE.",

It was observed that ORMD was associated with increased circulating insulin and decreased adiponectin concentrations, suggesting that in dogs, as in humans, there are links between obesity, ORMD, and associated diseases, although pathogenetic mechanisms and health significance for dogs remain unknown.

Tetralogy of Fallot (TOF) is a congenital heart disease characterized by 4 abnormalities, i.e., pulmonic stenosis, ventricular septal defect (VSD), aortic overriding and secondary right ventricular hypertrophy, caused by anterior deviation and abnormal septation of the conal septum during the embryonic period. Few studies have reported the hemodynamic consequences and clinical outcome of TOF in small animals. The objective of this retrospective study was therefore to document the epidemiological, clinical, echo-Doppler findings, and survival, in a canine and feline population with TOF. The case records of animals diagnosed with TOF by combined use of echocardiography and Doppler examination were reviewed (2003) (2004) (2005) (2006) (2007) (2008) (2009) (2010) (2011) (2012) (2013) (2014) . Tetralogy of Fallot was identified in 31 animals (15 dogs, 16 cats). The most commonly represented breeds were Terriers for dogs (7/15, 46.7%), and Domestic Shorthair for cats (12/16, 75.0%). Most included animals (28/31, 90.3%) were clinically affected at the time of diagnosis. Pulmonic stenosis was characterized by a variable systolic Doppler-derived pressure gradient both in dogs (median [range] 106 mmHg ) and cats (109 mmHg ), and associated with hypoplasia of the pulmonary trunk in one third of the cases (35.7%). Most VSD were large, with a median VSD: aorta ratio of 0.60 [0.35-1.02] in dogs and 0.59 [0.18-1.15] in cats. Median age at death from cardiac cause was 23.4 months [3.5-92.9 ] without significant difference between dogs and cats (P = 0.298). These results suggest that in both cats and dogs TOF-related death occurs predominantly in young adult animals with major hemodynamic consequences at the time of diagnosis.",

The aim of this study was to assess whether and how radiographic and echocardiographic cardiovascular variables differ across age bands of healthy cats. A cohort of 98 clinically healthy cats were categorized into three groups: adolescent-adult (0.6-6 years; n = 45), middle-aged (7-10 years; n = 28), and geriatric (11-17 years; n = 25). All cats underwent a full physical examination, a complete blood count, routine biochemical profile, a baseline serum total thyroxine concentration, auscultation, noninvasive blood pressure measurements, thoracic radiography, electrocardiography, and echocardiography. Cats with hypertension, hyperthyroidism, cardiac, or renal disease were excluded from the study. Body weight, body condition score, systolic blood pressure, heart rate, and all echocardiographic indices were similar across the three groups. The mean (AEstandard deviation [SD] ) vertebral heart scale (VHS) value obtained for the geriatric group (7.7 AE 0.6) was significantly greater than that obtained for the adolescent-adult group (7.4 AE 0.4; P = 0.018). The mean ratio of the distance between the cardiac base and dorsal sternum to thoracic cavity height at the point of the cardiac base was significantly less in the middle-aged (0.64 AE 0.04) and geriatric (0.61 AE 0.05) groups than in the adolescent-adult group (0.69 AE 0.04; both P < 0.001). The mean angle between the cardiac long axis and the body axis was significantly smaller in middle-aged (40.4 AE 7.7\u00b0) and geriatric cats (40.0 AE 7.9\u00b0) than in adolescent-adult cats (53.1 AE 7.3\u00b0; both P < .001). The mean angle between the cardiac long axis and the sternum of middle-aged (36.8 AE 6.6\u00b0) and geriatric cats (36.2 AE 7.9\u00b0) was significantly smaller than that in adolescent-adult cats (42.6 AE 5.7\u00b0; P = 0.006 and P = 0.002, respectively). Additionally, the degree of undulation of the thoracic aorta correlated positively with age (r 2 = 0.307, P = 0.003). These findings suggest that differences in the horizontal alignment of the heart, thoracic-aorta undulation, and VHS in healthy geriatric cats, relative to observations in younger cats, can be considered to be age-related.",

Doppler-derived +dP/dt and -dP/dt from mitralregurgitation are considered indexes for assessment of systolic and diastolicfunction respectively, that have less load dependence than the ejection phaseindexes. This study aimed to determine correlation between Doppler-deriveddP/dt and other systolic and diastolic echocardiographic indexes, and if theycan be used to identify dogs with and without remodeling, with or withoutcongestive heart failure (CHF) and for evaluation of chronic mitral valvedisease (CMVD) severity. Fifty-seven dogs with CMVD (stages B1, B2, C+D) wereincluded prospectively in an observational cross-sectional clinical study anddistributed in groups regarding the presence of remodeling and CHF, to evaluate+dP/dt and -dP/dt, and distributed according to TDI-diastolic pattern tocompare \u00c0dP/dt. Group C+D (2142 mmHg/s, P 25 -P 75 = 2023-2456) had +dP/dt significantly lower compared to B1 (2865 mmHg/s, P 25 -P 75 = 2383-3308) and B2 (2721 mmHg/s, P 25 -P 75 = 2241-3186) (P = 0.0023).

Pulmonary balloon valvuloplasty (PBV) is considered to be the treatment of choice for dogs withsevere stenosis. Whether dogs with moderate stenosis benefit from PBV remains unclear, and variables such as degree of hypertrophy, valve morphology, amount of tricuspid insufficiency and presence or absence of clinical signs aregenerally used when recommendations are made to pet owners. In this study we report the effect of valve type on PBV outcome in 110 dogs treated at three different academic speciality cardiology practices. Baseline echocardiographic images were evaluated at each institution and valve morphology was classified as either type A (N = 78, 137.96 mmHg, range 53-278) or type B (N = 33, 153.72 mmHg, range 81-300) and \"no\" (N = 87, 140 mmHg, range 53-279) or \"yes\" (N = 24, 151 mmHg, range 87-300) for presence of pulmonary annular hypoplasia when diameter was compared to aortic annulus. Twenty-four hours following PBV both type A (56 mmHg, range 17-210) and type B (78 mmHg, range 25-197) valves had significant reduction in gradient compared to baseline (P < 0.0001). This reduction remained significant at 30 days (A: 77 mmHg, range 22-193; B: 60 mmHg, range 30-116; P < 0.0001 for both). Dogs with annular hypoplasia (65 mmHg, and without annular hypoplasia (69 mmHg range 17-210) had a significant reduction in gradient 24 hours post PBV. It remained significant at 30 days (with annular hypoplasia: 77 mmHg, range 30-116; without annular hypoplasia: 61 mmHg, range 22-193; P < 0.0001 for both). When comparing to baseline, considering valve type, there was no significant difference in percent reduction in gradient for type A versus type B valves at both the 24-hour (A: 58%, range 17-88; B: 48%, range 12-82; P = 0.1014) and 30-day (A: 43%, range 23-89; B: 58%, range 33-81; P = 0.0544) recheck evaluation time points.",

Our hypothesis was that LA-FACtotal and LAEF decrease with severity of CMVD. Eighty dogs were included in a prospective observational cross-section clinical study, grouped according to CMVD severity based on echocardiographic evaluation and clinical signs. The dogs were equally distributed in each group: A, B1, B2 and C, according to American College of Veterinary Internal Medicine staging system. Indicators of LA function were calculated with the following equations: LA-FACtotal = 100 9 (LAmaximum area \u00c0LAminimum area)/LAmaximum area, measured by apical four view; and LAEF = 100 9 (LAmaximum volume \u00c0 LAminimum volume)/ LAmaximum volume, by biplane area-length method from the left apical four and two-chamber views. LA-FACtotal showed lower values (P < 0.0001) in group C (31.88%, P25%-75% = 26.47-41.12) compared with groups A (52.75%, P25%-75% = 48.08-56.07), B1 (48.38%, P25%-75% = 42.57-51.91) and B2 (46.15%, P25%-75% = 41.17-50).

Echocardiographic evaluation of the right pulmonary artery distensibility index (RPAD index) was recently described as a valuable method for early detection and severity evaluation of pulmonary arterial hypertension in dogs. RPAD index is calculated as the percentage change in diameter of the right pulmonary artery (RPA) between systole and diastole, obtained by M-mode echocardiography from the right parasternal long axis view. The aim of this study was to compare the RPAD index obtained by two different echocardiographic views in dogs. The study design was a prospective, multicenter, observational study. Forty-five client-owned dogs from different breeds were included: 31 dogs with heart disease and 14 healthy dogs. Two different right parasternal views, long axis (RPLA) and short axis (RPSA), were used to measure the RPAD index. From the RPLA view (method 1) and RPSA view (method 2) a short axis and a long axis image were respectively optimized for the right pulmonary artery. The RPAD index was calculated by M-mode as the percentage change in diameter of the right pulmonary artery: [(systolic diameter \u00c0 diastolic diameter)/systolic diameter]*100. Measurements were done off-line as an average of 5 consecutive cardiac cycles by a single investigator blinded to the dogs' diagnosis. A Pearson and a Bland-Altman test were used to assess correlation and agreement between the 2 methods, respectively. Intra-and inter-observer measurement variability was quantified by average coefficient of variation (CV). Level of significance was set at P < 0.05. M-mode evaluation of the RPAD index was satisfactorily obtained by both methods in all dogs. Pearson test showed a strong positive linear correlation between the values of RPAD index obtained from both methods (r 2 = 0.9346, P < 0.0001). Bland-Altman test showed a good agreement between the 2 methods in estimating RPAD index (bias = 0.51%, SD = 2.96%, 95% limits of agreement = \u00c05.30, 6.33%). The mean difference between the two methods was 0.51% (95% confidence interval = \u00c00.35; 1.35). Intra-and inter-observer measurement variability was clinically acceptable (CV<10%).The study showed a good agreement between short axis and long axis M-mode evaluation of RPA. Both methods can be used interchangeably to evaluate RPAD index. Further studies are needed to evaluate the RPAD index in a larger population of healthy dogs and the diagnostic and prognostic role of this echocardiographic parameter in dogs with different types of pulmonary hypertension.",

Therefore, an inherited susceptibility can be suspected. Reason for presentation and clinical signs were nonspecific, and similar to what is reported in other breed. In human medicine, haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), a form of glycosylated haemoglobin, is used as the standard measure of average glycaemic control over 2-3 months. The measurement of HbA1c in dogs has been previously demonstrated however high pressure liquid chromatography techniques are too technically difficult for routine use and other methods are no longer available. The objective of this study was to assess the use of latex immunoagglutination inhibition using a monoclonal antibody for the measurement of HbA1c in dogs, using the Siemens DCA Vantage \u00d2 .",

Our study aimed to find (1) if some CNS diseases could be associated with a selected group of common microbial or viral pathogens in dogs and (2) if CNS diseases have any characteristic profile with regard to two parameters, C-reactive protein (CRP) and IgA, that are reported to be potentially useful but unspecific markers of CNS diseases. We analysed 210 cerebrospinal fluid samples obtained from dogs with varying neurological signs between June and November 2014. Real-time PCR was employed with probes for Toxoplasma gondii, Neospora caninum, Anaplasma phagocytophilum and Canine distemper virus. IgG-antibodies to Tickborne encephalitis virus (TBE) were assayed and IgA titres were measured using ELISA, while CRP concentrations were determined by immunoturbidimetric assay. The dogs had a median age of 4 years (range: 0.5-14) and comprised 60 breeds most frequently involving Chihuahuas, Labrador Retrievers, Bernese Mountain Dogs and Boxers. Gender distribution was 22.4% female, 12.9% spayed bitches, 42.8% male, 15.7% neutered male, and 6.2% non-identified. None of the cases were PCR-positive for Toxoplasma gondii or Canine distemper virus. One dog was positive for Anaplasma phagocytophilum and another for Neospora caninum. Antibodies to TBE virus were within the borderline range in 6/210 dogs. The 210 dogs could be divided into two age groups: 60 (=28.6%) for young dogs (<2 years, median 1 year) and 150 (=71.4%) for older dogs (\u22652 years, median 6 years). IgAhigh (>0.1 mg/dl) cases represented 95% and 90% for young and older dogs, respectively. CRP-high (>1.0 mg/l) cases were almost half and equal: 51.7% and 56.0% in young and older dogs, respectively. Compared with older dogs, young dogs had higher levels of CRP (P = 0.022) and IgA (P = 0.054). Within the IgA-high cohorts, CRP-high and CRP-low cases distributed almost equally (46.7% versus 48.3%) in young dogs but disproportionate (52.0% versus 38.0%) in older dogs. There were no [IgA-low/CRP-low] cases in young dogs but 6.0% in older dogs. Our present data sug-gest that (1) canine CNS disorders were largely characterized by high IgA and particularly in young dogs (2) inflammatory types (CRP-high) were almost equal in both groups and (3) Internet is a potential source of medical information for pet owners. Therefore, it could play an indirect but important role in the veterinary practice. This survey assesses the online search behaviour of French pet owners for their pets' health and its influence on a veterinary consultation. In April 2013, 260 French pet owners coming in a veterinary teaching hospital for a medical or a surgical consultation were surveyed. 239 (91.9%) owners fulfilled the questionnaire on a voluntary basis. The survey contained 26 questions dealing with three topics: the online search behaviour of owners for their pets' health, their perception of the information found online and the internet's influence on a consultation and on the veterinarian/client relationship.73.6% of owners use the Internet to obtain information on their pets' health. Among them, 32.6% use it rarely and 28.9% occasionally. They mainly look for information on a disease (51.1%), a symptom (51.1%), a breed (50%) or a nutritional advice (48.9%). 79.7% of owners try to verify the accuracy of the information found, most often by questioning their veterinarian (82.8%). Few owners (15.4%) think that online information is always trustworthy. Most of the research (81.9%) is randomly made, websites being found through search engines. The majority of pet owners (81.3%) aren't aware of any health certification label for websites. Internet enables certain pet owners to feel more at ease with their pets' health care: they ask more questions to their veterinarian (88.9%) and feel more involved in medical choices (55.6%). 37.9% of owners consider that the Internet can positively impact their relationship with the veterinarian. Relief is the most common (73.6%) emotional response to online research for medical information. However, 58.8% of owners feel overwhelmed by the amount of information found, 56% are confused and 35.2% frightened by the serious or graphic nature of the information found online.",

Canine pancytopenia is associated with a range of intra-marrow or extra-marrow causes, including though not limited to, infectious agents, drugs, toxins and neoplasms. There is currently limited information regarding the clinicopathological features of the underlying causes or the prognosis in pancytopenic dogs. The objective of this retrospective study was to better define the spectrum of diseases associated with canine pancytopenia, to establish possible clinicopathological discriminators for the common causes and to investigate if the severity of pancytopenia or the underlying disease were associated with the clinical outcome (death or survival). Medical records of dogs with a comprehensive diagnostic investigation admitted in a veterinary teaching hospital were retrospectively reviewed. Pancytopenia was defined by a hematocrit (HCT) <37% (<30% for dogs <5 months of age), white blood cell counts (WBC) <6.000/lL and platelet counts (PLT) <200,000/lL. A control group of 238 dogs without any evidence of blood cytopenia(s) was also established. In total, 119 pancytopenic dogs were studied. Bone marrow aspiration cytology was examined in 42 cases and aplasia of all hematopoietic lineages was observed in 22 (52.4%) dogs. The most common diagnoses included monocytic ehrlichiosis (CME) (n = 43), leishmaniosis (CanL) (n = 28), parvoviral enteritis (PE) (n = 19), and concurrent CME and CanL (n = 12). Mixed breed dogs were more likely to develop pancytopenia as compared to purebreds and pancytopenic dogs tended to be younger than the controls (conditional dependent logistic regression model, P = 0.013 and P = 0.001, respectively). Among the most common diseases associated with pancytopenia, the mean WBC counts were significantly lower in dogs with CME and PE compared to dogs with CanL (one way ANOVA with Bonferroni test for multiple comparisons, P = 0.004 and P = 0.03, respectively), while PLT counts were significantly lower in CME compared to CanL (P < 0.0001) or PE (P < 0.0001). Total protein concentrations were significantly lower in dogs with PE compared to CME (P < 0.0001) and CanL (P < 0.0001). Using a univariable logistic regression analysis model, no association was established between the underlying disease and the final outcome.

The median lifespan of domestic dogs has been estimated to 9-12 years, but little is known about risk factors for mortality in aged dogs: most mortality studies in dogs have been carried out among diseased dogs (renal or heart diseases, cancers, post-operative death). To determine which characteristics are associated with mortality in a priori healthy aged dogs, a prospective cohort study has been conducted in 116 guide dogs, followed from a systematic geriatric examination (GE) to either (all-cause) death or cut-off date (July 16th, 2013). Survival analyses (Kaplan-Meier estimators, log-rank tests, and multivariate Cox proportional hazards models) were used to assess the associations with time to death. Median age at GE was 8.9 years, all dogs were neutered, and 50% were female. The majority of dogs were Golden Retriever (n = 48) and Labrador Retriever (n = 27). Among these 116 dogs, 16% were obese, 47% presented skin nodules and 90% used bus as transportation. A total of 76 dogs died during follow-up, leading to a median survival time from GE of 4.4 years. After adjustment for demographic and biochemical variables (age, sex, total proteins, cholesterol and ALP), an increased alanine amionotransferase level (\u2265102 UI/L; adjusted Hazard Ratio [aHR], 6.0), presenting skin nodules (aHR, 2.3), and not being a Labrador (aHR, 3.3) were independently associated with a shorter time to death (P < 0.05). Public transportation tended to be associated with mortality (aHR, 3.0; P = 0.06), highlighting the importance of environment in mortality.

Bronchiectasis is a poorly characterized disease in dogs identified by airway dilatation on radiographs, computed tomography, bronchoscopy, or histopathology. Little is known about underlying disease processes associated with bronchiectasis in dogs. Medical records from dogs presented to UC Davis were searched for identification of bronchiectasis. Underlying disease processes and clinical diagnoses were obtained through review of the history, physical examination, respiratory endoscopy and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid analysis and microbiology. Historical reports, results of imaging, bronchoscopy and fluid analysis, and scrutiny of pathologic and clinical diagnoses were comprehensively evaluated to identify the most likely underlying disease process associated with bronchiectasis. Between 2003 and 2014, bronchiectasis was diagnosed in 86/621 dogs (14%) that had bronchoscopy performed. Dogs ranged in age from 0.5 to 14 years (median 10 years) with 1/85 dogs <6 months, 16/85 dogs (19%) 1-5 years, 37/85 dogs (43%) 5.1-10 years of age and 31/85 dogs (37%) over 10 years of age. Dog breeds affected more than once included 6 Labrador retrievers, 5 Cocker spaniels, 4 Golden retrievers and 4 Standard Poodles. Duration of cough ranged from 3 days to 10 years (median 6 months). Underlying disease processes included pneumonia in 45/86 (52%) dogs, inflammatory airway disease in 24/86 (28%) dogs, and eosinophilic bronchopneumopathy in 10/86 (12%) dogs. Twenty-three of 85 dogs (27%) had positive bacterial cultures, with isolation of Streptococcus (n = 6) and enteric species (n = 5) most commonly.

Oxidative stress in the body represents the imbalance between the production of reactive oxidative species and the ability of antioxidant defense mechanisms to detoxify the reactive intermediates. Oxidative stress is involved in the pathogenesis of many diseases, including hemolytic anemia, atherosclerosis, tissue reperfusion injury and has also carcinogenic potential. Several studies have clearly shown an association between obstructive sleep apnea syndrome in humans and oxidative stress, but detailed underlying pathomechanism remains unclear.

Canine idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (CIPF) is a progressive interstitial lung disease mainly affecting West Highland white terriers (WHWTs). The CIPF course varies greatly among dogs from rapid deterioration to slowly progressive forms and the survival time from onset of clinical signs ranges from a few months to several years. In human IPF, increased chemokine (CC-motif) ligand 2 (CCL2) concentrations in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) are indicative of a poor outcome and serum concentrations are correlated with clinical parameters of lung function. In dogs, serum and BALF CCL2 concentrations were shown to be elevated in WHWTs with CIPF compared with healthy WHWTs. The aim of the present study was to investigate whether serum CCL2 concentrations measured in WHWTs with CIPF at diagnosis (1) can be used as an indicator of prognosis and (2) correlate with lung function parameters. CCL2 concentrations were determined by ELISA (Canine CCL2 Quantikine ELISA kit, R&D Systems) in the serum of 60 WHWTs suspected of CIPF (median age 11.7 years, range 5.7-14.5), for which a follow-up was available (median follow-up time 8.6 months, range 0-71.8). Serum sampling extended from May 2007 to January 2015. CIPF diagnosis was confirmed by thoracic high resolution computed tomography, lung histopathology, or both examinations in 17, 6 and 27 WHWTs respectively. Kaplan-Meier analysis was conducted to investigate differences in survival times according to serum CCL2 concentrations at diagnosis. Spearman analysis was used to assess correlations between serum CCL2 concentrations and lung function parameters, namely the distance walked in the 6-minute walking test (6MWD) and the arterial partial pressure of oxygen (pO 2 ). Among the 60 CIPF WHWTs included, 31 died or were euthanized for CIPF-related reason, 12 died or were euthanized for non-CIPF-related reason and 17 were still alive at the end of the study. The median survival of WHWTs with CIPF-related death or euthanasia was 6.4 (range 0.4-71.9) months from diagnosis. Serum CCL2 concentrations above 700 pg/mL were significantly associated with a shorter survival time in WHWTs affected with CIPF (P = 0.02). A weak negative correlation was found between serum CCL2 concentrations and the 6MWD (r = \u00c00.382, P = 0.03, n = 31), while no correlation was observed with arterial pO 2 values (n = 49). In conclusion, serum CCL2 concentration provides prognostic information in WHWTs suffering from CIPF, while this marker is weakly correlated with the clinically lung function parameters available in the present study.",

Canine idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (CIPF) is a progressive interstitial lung disease mainly affecting West Highland white terriers (WHWTs). This study was intended to (1) describe thoracic high-resolution computed tomography (T-HRCT) findings obtained in CIPF dogs under general anesthesia (GA) using the glossary of the Fleischner Society and (2) compare images obtained under GA (T-HRCT GA ) with those obtained under sedation (T-HRCT S ). T-HRCT images from 11 WHWTs with CIPF and 9 control WHWTs were retrospectively reviewed by three observers in consensus. Specific T-HRCT features were assessed and graded for each lung lobe (0 = absence, 1 = mild, 2 = moderate and 3 = severe). A global score was then calculated. The Khi\u00b2 test with the threshold 5% was used for the statistical analysis. Ground glass opacity (GGO) was observed in all CIPF WHWTs and in 5/9 of controls (P = 0.013). In controls, GGO was mild and localised mainly in cranial lobes. In CIPF WHWTs, GGO was mild, moderate or severe in 2, 4 and 5 dogs respectively, without lobe predilection. Consolidation was observed in 5/11 CIPF WHWTs but not in controls (P = 0.020) and was mild (3/5) to moderate (2/5). A mosaic pattern, suggestive of air trapping, was noticed in 8/11 CIPF WHWTs but not in controls (P = 0.001) and was mild, moderate or severe in 3, 2 and 3 WHWTs respectively, without lobe predilection. Nodules were present in 3/11 CIPF WHWTs but not in controls. Reticulation, subpleural bands and parenchymal bands were noticed in 1, 1, and 3/11 CIPF WHWTs respectively. Honeycombing, emphysema, pleural effusion and pleural thickening were never observed. Bronchial wall thickening and mild bronchiectasis were present in 6/11 and 3/11 CIPF WHWTs respectively but not in controls (P = 0.008 and P = 0.09). The overall T-HRCT S quality was good in 10/17 examinations compared with 16/20 for T-HRCT GA (P = 0.160). The presence of motion artefacts was higher for T-HRCT S (P < 0.001), but were most frequently graded as mild (P < 0.001). T-HRCT S allowed identification of a mosaic pattern in 2 additional CIPF WHWTs, while consolidation could not be identified in 2 others. There was no difference in identification or gradation for the other features between T-HRCT GA and T-HRCT S . In conclusion, GGO, consolidation, mosaic pattern and bronchial wall thickening are the main T-HRCT features of CIPF in WHWTs. Honeycombing, the major feature of IPF in humans, was never observed, which suggests a different pathophysiology between the two entities. T-HRCT S images are in accordance with T-HRCT GA and can be used for CIPF diagnosis.",

The tumor-associated inflammatory response had the effect of enhancing mammary tumorigenesis, helping incipient neoplasias to acquire hallmark capabilities, both in human and dogs. T-cells migration to the tumor site and the following activation may be the essential requirement for their promoting effect on tumors. In human breast cancer the signaling pathways of c-kit have been described as possibly being involved in differentiation, migration, survival, and maturation of T-cells and other inflammatory cells into tumor sites. In order to clarify this subject in canine mammary tumors (CMT), 80 malignant neoplasms were studied by using immunohistochemistry comparing the intratumoral CD3+ Tlymphocytes and c-kit expression together with VEGF, microvessel density (MVD) and clinicopathological characteristics of tumor aggressiveness. CD3+ T cells and high c-kit immunoexpression revealed a positive and statistically significant correlation with VEGF (r = 0.503, P < 0.0001; r = 0.284, P = 0.023 for CD3 and c-kit respectively) and CD31 (r = 0.654, P < 0.0001; r = 0.365, P = 0.003 for CD3 and c-kit respectively). A statistically significant association (P = 0.039) and a positive correlation (r = 0.263, P = 0.039) between CD3+ T-lymphocytes and c-kit was also observed. Tumors with high c-kit expression showed higher counts of CD3+ T-cells. The MVD of high CD3/VEGF tumors was significantly more elevated (P < 0.0001). A similar association was observed for high c-kit/VEGF tumors (P < 0.001). In this study high CD3/VEGF, high c-kit/VEGF and high CD3/c-kit tumors were statistically significantly associated with elevated grade of malignancy (P < 0.0001 for CD3/VEGF, c-kit/VEGF and CD3/ckit), presence of neoplastic intravascular emboli (P < 0.0001 for CD3/VEGF and CD3/c-kit; P = 0.002 for c-kit/VEGF) and presence of lymph node metastasis (P < 0.0001 for CD3/VEGF, c-kit/ VEGF and CD3/c-kit). Tumors with high CD3/VEGF (P = 0.006), high c-kit/VEGF (P < 0.0001) and high CD3/c-kit (P = 0.002) expression were associated with shorter OS time. Interestingly the group of tumors with high c-kit/VEGF retained their significance by multivariate analysis arising as independent predictor of OS. Results of this study suggest that T-lymphocytes may share common signaling pathways with c-kit and VEGF in CMT progression and may contribute to increased angiogenesis, aggression and shorter OS in these tumors.",

FoxP3 regulatory T cells (FoxP3Treg) are a distinct group of T lymphocytes that have immunosuppressive properties. Normally this cells work for prevention of harmful autoimmune responses, however can also interfere with beneficial immune responses such as anti-tumor immunity. In human breast cancer these cells play a crucial role in tumor progression. In canine mammary tumors (CMT) there are only a few studies and this topic are not welldocumented. In this study we included 80 malignant CMT and studied, by immunohistochemistry, the intratumoral FoxP3 expression together with vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), microvessel density (MVD, by CD31 antibody) and several clinicopathological characteristics. Abundant FoxP3Treg cells was statistically associated with presence of tumor necrosis (P = 0.004), nuclear grade (P = 0.001), poor differentiation of tumors (P < 0.0001), high mitotic grade (P < 0.0001), high histological grade of malignancy (P < 0.0001), presence of neoplastic intravascular emboli (P < 0.0001) and presence of lymph node metastasis (P < 0.0001).

Additionally tumors with abundant FoxP3Treg cells were associated with shorter overall survival (OS) time (P = 0.0001). Results suggest that Treg cells play a role in CMT progression and may contribute to increased angiogenesis and aggression in these tumors.

Cardiac lesions resulting in clinical signs has been scarcely described in dogs with VL, and the presence of the parasite in the cardiac tissue has been involved in few reports. Accordingly, the present study aimed to evaluate histopathological abnormalities in cardiac tissue from dogs naturally infected by Leishmania infantum chagasi. A total of 20 dogs were evaluated. All dogs were symptomatic but no one presented clinical signs of cardiac involvement. In compliance with a federal law and under the owners' signed consent, all dogs were submitted to euthanasia and comprehensive post-mortem evaluation. Samples from right atrium free wall (RA), right ventricle free wall (RV), interventricular septum (IVS) and left ventricle free wall (LV) were collected and evaluated. Tissue samples were fixed in formalin, embedded in paraffin, sectioned at 5 mm, and stained with hematoxylin and eosin (HE) and Anti-Leishmania immunohistochemistry was also performed. The study was approved by the Ethics Committee in Animal Experimentation and Animal Welfare (protocol number 0463/2013). Histopathological changes were observed in at least one of the four evaluated cardiac regions in 75% (15/20) of the dogs. The most frequent cardiac injury was an inflammatory reaction, characterized by the presence of mononuclear cell infiltrate in different degrees. Of the evaluated regions, RA was the one with the highest incidence of histopathological changes, observed in 80% (12/15) of the animals, followed by RV, LV and SIV, affected in 73.3% (11/15), 66.7% (10/15) and 53.3% (8/15) of the dogs, respectively.

The combination of meglumine antimoniate and allopurinol is considered the most effective therapy for canine leishmaniosis and constitutes the first line protocol against this disease. Allopurinol is a parasitostatic drug used in long-term to maintain low parasite loads and to avoid clinical relapses. Traditionally, allopurinol is considered a very safe drug in the dog. However, some reports indicate that xanthinuria and xanthine urolithiasis is produced after prolonged therapy with allopurinol in the dog. The aim of this prospective study was to evaluate the prevalence of urinary adverse effects of allopurinol treatment (10 mg/kg/BID/PO) in dogs with leishmaniosis. Diagnosis was made by compatible clini-copathological abnormalitites with leishmaniosis and high Leishmania infantum-specific antibody levels assessed by quantitative ELISA. Once leishmaniosis was diagnosed, a close follow-up (day 0, 30, 90, 180 and 360 during treatment) including physical examination, baseline laboratory tests (CBC, biochemistry profile, serum electrophoresis, urinalysis, urinary protein/creatinine ratio) and abdominal ultrasound was performed.

Assessment of systolic arterial blood pressure (SAP) is an important tool in small animal internal medicine practice, especially with diseases or clinical conditions that can cause hypertension or hypotension. The Doppler method is noninvasive and has several advantages compared to oscillometric method. There are few studies about the effect of body position on SAP in conscious dogs. The hypothesis was that animal positioning during measurement alters SAP values. The study design was prospective and randomized regarding order of positioning measurements. One hundred and twenty client-owned, conscious, healthy or sick adult dogs, weighing up to 10 kg were included. SAP was recorded by Doppler ultrasonography following American College of Veterinary Internal Medicine consensus statement with animals positioned in sternal recumbency, right lateral recumbency and with the dog laying down on owner 0 s lap. The order of body position was raffled at the time of measurement. Five consecutive measurements on each body position were performed always on left forelimb and the average was calculated. SAP values were higher in sternal recumbency (153 mmHg, P 25%-75% = 134-176.5; P < 0.0126) compared to those obtained on the owner 0 s lap (139 mmHg, P 25%-75% = 125.5-159.8), and both were similar to right lateral recumbency (141 mmHg, P 25%-75% = 125-159).

Its prevalence in the general canine population is estimated between 0.06 and 0.28%. Certain breeds appear to have an increased risk for developing hypoadrenocorticism, including Bearded Collie, Standard Poodle, Portuguese water dog and Nova Scotia Duck Tolling Retriever, with reported prevalence of 9.4, 8.6, 1.5 and 1.4%, respectively.The objective is to evaluate the prevalence and clinical features of naturally occurring hypoadrenocorticism in Great Pyrenees (GP) presented at the Centre Hospitalier Universitaire V et erinaire (CHUV) of the University of Montreal.",

The study was approved by the ethical committee of Veterinary Medicine Service of Las Palmas de Gran Canaria University (Spain) and it was carried out in accordance with the current European legislation on animal protection. Thirteen client-owned cats were included [LM (n = 3), FBD (n = 10)]. Cats did not have a previous history of upper airway, cardiac or systemic diseases and had negative results when tested for heartworm and FeLV/FIV diseases. Cats were placed in the BWBP chamber and after an adaptation period of time in a quiet and silent environment, four 3-minute periods were registered and data were shown as means with standard deviations. A P-value <0.05 was considered statistically significant.

Med., ULPGC, Las Palmas, Spain Laryngeal masses (LM) usually produce air flow limitation during inspiration, expiration or transiently during subsegments of both breathing phases. Feline bronchial diseases (FBD) have pre-dominantly expiratory flow restrictions. Barometric whole-body plethysmography (BWBP) is a non-invasive pulmonary function test (PFT) that allows a dynamic study of breathing patterns widely used to evaluate lower airway responsiveness. The objective of this preliminary study was to evaluate if there were significant differences in respiratory rate [RR (rpm)], tidal volume [TV (mL)], minute volume [MV (mL)], inspiratory [Ti (s)] and expiratory [Te (s)] intervals, peak inspiratory and expiratory flows [PIF and PEF (mL/s)], end expiratory pause [EEP (ms)], Enhanced pause [Penh] and Pause [PAU] between cats with LM and with FBD by using BWBP. The study was approved by the ethical committee of Veterinary Medicine Service of Las Palmas de Gran Canaria University (Spain) and it was carried out in accordance with the current European legislation on animal protection. Thirteen client-owned cats were included [LM (n = 3), FBD (n = 10)]. Cats did not have a previous history of upper airway, cardiac or systemic diseases and had negative results when tested for heartworm and FeLV/FIV diseases. Cats were placed in the BWBP chamber and after an adaptation period of time in a quiet and silent environment, four 3-minute periods were registered and data were shown as means with standard deviations. A Pvalue < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. BWBP results were: RR = 28.27 AE 23.54; TV = 99.97 AE 43.04; MV = 2168.34 AE 872.70; Ti = 1.41 AE 0.77; Te = 1.83 AE 1.18; PIF = 126.99 AE 25.92; PEF = 237.62 AE 67.03; EEP = 724.02 AE 862.09; Penh = 3.391 AE 0.960 and PAU = 1.654 AE 0.258 for LM cats, and RR = 78.76 AE 60.77; TV = 28.56 AE 14.86; MV = 1663.88 AE 761.04; Ti = 0.46 AE 0.18; Te = 0.67 AE 0.24; PIF = 97.21 AE 40.31; PEF = 87.97 AE 51.40; EEP = 15.63 AE 12.62; Penh = 0.857 AE 0.287 and PAU = 0.914 AE 0.211 for FBD cats.",

            "text": "Cyprus is an island state in the eastern Mediterranean basin. No epidemiological studies have yet been performed on infectious agents in cats from Cyprus. The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of several infectious agents, including some vector-borne infections, in cats from Cyprus.Surplus EDTA-blood and serum samples were recruited from 176 Cypriot cats, from which signalment and lifestyle characteristics were recorded. DNA was extracted and real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) assays were used to detect haemplasmas (Mycoplasma haemofelis, \"Candidatus Mycoplasma haemominutum\" and \"Candidatus Mycoplasma turicensis\"), Leishmania spp.and Bartonella henselae. Conventional PCR assays were used to detect Ehrlichia/Anaplasma spp. Samples yielding positive results for Leishmania spp. or Ehrlichia/Anaplasma spp. underwent further characterisation (sequencing). ELISAs were performed for the detection of L. infantum antibodies, feline leukaemia virus (FeLV) antigen and feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) antibodies. Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS for the assessment of any associations between variables and infectious agents.Of the 176 samples extracted, 2 were excluded due to failure of \u2265one internal control PCR. Of the remaining 174 samples, 46 (26.4%) were positive by PCR for haemoplasma including 13 (7.5%) for M. haemofelis, 36 (20.7%) for \"Ca. M. haemominutum\" and 12 (6.9%) for \"Ca. M. turicensis\". Nineteen (10.9%) were positive for B. henselae. One cat (0.6%) was PCR positive for Ehrlichia/Anaplasma spp. and sequencing revealed identity with Anaplasma platys. Leishmania spp. DNA was detected in 6 of the 174 (3.4%) cats; sequencing revealed L. infantum in 4 of these cases. L. infantum serology was positive in 7 of the 162 cats tested (4.3%). Only one cat was positive for both Leishmania PCR and serology. Of the 166 cats that underwent retroviral serology, 11 (6.6%) were FeLV and 30 (18.4%) were FIV positive.Statistical analysis identified several significant associations (P < 0.05) including the following; haemoplasma infection and both outdoor access and feral-shelter cat origin, FeLV or FIV infection and both anaemia and feral-shelter cat origin.This study documents, for the first time, the presence of haemoplasmas, L. infantum, B. henselae, A. platys, FeLV and FIV in the feline population of Cyprus. The prevalence of haemoplasma, FIV and B. henselae infections were among the highest reported in cats from Mediterranean countries, while that of Leishmania spp. was similar. This is the second report of A. platys infection in a cat from a Mediterranean country.Disclosures: No disclosures to report. Bartonella species (spp.) are zoonotic pathogens, and infections in cats are common. Prevalence in cats from Southern Germany is still unknown. The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of Bartonella spp. DNA in blood of cats in Southern Germany and to evaluate associations between Bartonella bacteremia, housing conditions, feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV), and feline leukemia virus (FeLV) status, including progressive, regressive, and abortive FeLV infection.Blood samples of 479 cats that were presented to different veterinary clinics in Southern Germany for various reasons were tested for Bartonella spp. DNA using a previously published conventional polymerase chain reaction (PCR) targeting a fragment of the 16S-23S rRNA intergenic spacer region. For statistical analysis, Fisher's exact test was used.Prevalence rate of Bartonella spp. bacteremia was 2.5% (12/479; CI: 0.01%-0.04%). B. henselae was amplified in eleven of these cats. One cat was positive for B. clarridgeiae DNA. Most of the infected cats were clinically healthy, but half of the cats had thrombocytopenia, potentially caused by their Bartonella spp. infection. There was no significantly higher risk to be infected with Bartonella spp. when living mainly outdoors or being FIV-or FeLV-infected.Prevalence of Bartonella spp. bacteremia is low in Southern German cats, but there is still a risk of human Bartonella infection associated with cat ownership. Most clinical changes of the Bartonella spp.-infected cats were related to other diseases. However, thrombocytopenia was common and further studies are required to define its potential clinical relevance.Disclosures: No disclosures to report. Ante-mortem diagnosis of feline infectious peritonitis (FIP) is still challenging. The aim of this study was to evaluate sensitivity and specificity of a \"combined reverse transcription nested polymerase chain reaction (RT-nPCR) and sequencing approach\", detecting mutations at two different nucleotide positions within the spike gene, that previously were shown to correlate with the FIP phenotype.",

            "text": "The study population consisted of 64 cats with confirmed FIP and a defined control group of 63 cats for which FIP was considered an important differential diagnosis, but that were definitively diagnosed with other diseases. Blood and/or effusion samples were examined for feline coronavirus (FCoV) RNA by RT-nPCR and, if positive, nucleotide positions 23531 and 23537 were sequenced for nucleotide transitions. Sensitivity, specificity, negative and positive predictive values were determined and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) calculated.RT-nPCR detected FCoV in 38 cats in blood (n = 3) and/or effusion (n = 36); all of them had FIP. One of the mutations of interest was found in 2/3 of the PCR-positive blood samples and in 32/36 of the PCR-positive effusion samples. Diagnostic specificity of the \"combined RT-nPCR and sequencing approach\" was 100% in blood (95% CI 83.9-100.0) and effusion (95% CI 93.0-100.0). Diagnostic sensitivity was 6.5% (95% CI 0.8-21.4) in blood and 65.3% (95% CI 50.4-78.3) in effusion.A positive test result therefore confirms a suspicion of FIP. A negative result, however, cannot be used to rule out FIP, especially Feline Infectious Peritonitis (FIP) is a viral disease caused by the virulent strain of Feline Coronavirus (FIPV). The disease can appear under two clinical forms, dry or effusive, both leading to a fatal outcome. Diagnosis was based on histopathologic lesions on necropsy until the recent discovery of mutations associated with the FIPV strain in the 3c and spike (S) genes. Our main goal was to detail the distribution of 3c or S gene mutations in different biological samples of cats suffering from FIP.This was a retrospective, observational study of 33 cats showing clinical signs compatible with FIP. Ten out of 33 cats were of pure breed. 57.7% were males and 42.3% females. Median age was 36.5 months at presentation. The clinical presentation, pathologic findings and virologic data were reviewed. According to clinical signs, 11 cats were classified with a dry form and 22 with a wet form of FIP. The main clinical signs included dehydration, hyperthermia, icterus, abnormal abdominal palpation, neurological and ocular disorders.When possible blood, fecal material, effusion, fine needle aspiration (FNA) from relevant organs or a combination of these, was recovered from each cat. Feline Coronavirus (FCoV) was first researched by RT-PCR, then the 3c and part of the S genes were sequenced to determine the eventual presence of mutations.Among the 11 dry cases, FCoV was detected in 2/8 blood samples, 3/8 fecal samples and FNA (11/11). Among the 22 wet cases, 9/15 blood samples, 12/14 fecal samples and all effusion samples (21/21) were positive for the presence of FCoV. 3c mutations were never found in fecal samples but were found in 6/10 effusion samples and in 8/8 FNA. S mutations were detected in 4/9 fecal samples, 8/9 FNA and 14/15 effusion samples. For three cats, no mutation, neither in 3c or S genes was identified despite the confirmation of FIP by necropsy.S gene mutation is more frequently observed than 3c gene despite in two cases where only 3c mutations were identified. Moreover the presence of strains harbouring S mutation in feces has never been described before and could suggest the possible diffusion of FIPV among feline population.In conclusion, viral diagnosis of FIP based on RT-PCR sequencing in effusion and FNA samples is essential. RT-PCR resulting from blood samples should be carefully interpreted because of high risk of missing FIPV.Finally, searching for mutations in both S and 3c genes is recommended.Disclosures: No disclosures to report. Methicillin Resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) has recently become a great concern for pet animals' disease and zoonotic infection. MRSA strains transfer between pet animals and humans could occur. The aim of the present study was to determine the occurrence of MRSA in 34 household dogs.From January to June 2012, clinical samples were collected from 34 dogs, patients of the Veterinary Teaching Hospital of the Department of Veterinary Sciences of Messina (Italy), affected by several diseases of various origins. All samples were processed by bacteriological conventional methods for isolation and identification. All strains were tested for phenotypic susceptibility to oxacillin and were subjected to a PCR protocol for the detection of mecA gene. Strains carrying the gene were considered Methicillin Resistant (MRS). Lastly, on both MRS and Methicillin Sensitive (MSS) strains, Kirby-Bauer disk diffusion susceptibility testing were performed to highlight resistance profiles using 44 molecules belonging to the main classes of antimicrobials used in veterinary practice. Strains resistant to at least one molecule of three or more classes of antibiotics were considered multidrug-resistant (MDR). The statistical analysis of the results was made using the Z-test by a Primer \u00d2 software.Forty Staphylococcus spp. strains were isolated, belonging to 12 species. The most frequently isolated microorganisms were Staphylococcus aureus with 14 isolations (35%) and Staphylococcus pseudintermedius with 11 isolations (27.5%), followed by Staphylococcus epidermidis with 4 isolations (10%) and Staphylococcus cohnii and Staphylococcus warneri, both with 2 isolations (5%). A single isolation (2.5%) was obtained for each of the species Staphylococcus chromogenes, Staphylococcus haemolyticus, Staphylococcus lentus, Staphylococcus lugdunensis, Staphylococcus saprophyticus, Staphylococcus simulans and Staphylococcus sciuri. Thirteen (32.5%) strains of Staphylococcus spp. were phenotypically resistant to oxacillin and three Staphylococcus aureus (7.5%; n.2 from pyoderma, n.1 from exudative pleural effusion) were positive for the mecA gene. All 40 strains of Staphylococcus spp. were MDR. Our results showed the presence of MRSA and multidrug-resistant staphylococcal strains in household dogs. A lack of correspondence between antimicrobial susceptibility tests and molecular methods was found in the present study.Disclosures: No disclosures to report. Haemotropic Mycoplasmas (haemoplasmas) are bacteria that infect domestic cats. Approximately 25% of ill cats have haemoplasma infection. Three main feline haemoplasma species have been detected worldwide; Mycoplasma haemofelis (Mhf), \"Candidatus M. haemominutum\" (CMhm) and \"Candidatus M. turicensis\" (CMt). A fourth haemoplasma called \"Candidatus M. haematoparvun-like\" (CMhp) was latter identified in cats. The only published study in Chile was carried out in 30 cats, with prevalences by PCR of 3.3% to Mhf, and 10% to CMhm.The aim of this study was to perform molecular detection of haemoplasmas in cats from Valdivia, southern Chile. Blood samples were taken from 384 cats and used for haemoplasmas DNA detection by Quantitative Real Time PCR (qPCR) at Universidad Austral de Chile. qPCR protocol was based on detection of feline DNA targeting 28S Housekeeping gene and Mycoplasma spp. 16S rRNA gene (universal primers, MY16SF forward, MY16SR1 y MY16SR2, both reverse) by SYBR Green method. The melting Temperature (Tm) analysis allowed identifying the infecting Mycoplasma species (Mhf, CMhm, CMt). It was not posible to identify haemoplasmas species on co infected cats, so a second qPCR specie specific protocol was applied on these samples. Second qPCR protocol was based on 16S rRNA gene, with specific primers to detect Mhf, CMhm, CMt and CMhp. All samples (384/384) were positive to 28S gene, proving presence of cat DNA. From the 384 cats, 15.1% (58/384) were positive to haemoplasmas, where 7.8% (30/384) corresponded to CMhm (Tm 73.5-75.0\u00b0C), 4.4% (17/384) to Mhf (Tm 75.0-76.5\u00b0C), 2% (4/384) to CMt (Tm 76.5-78.0\u00b0C) and 1.8% (7/384) to co infections. Associations between CMhm+Mhf, CMhm+CMt, CMhm+CMhp and CMhm+Mhf+CMhp were detected on co infected animals. These results agree with those found in previous",
