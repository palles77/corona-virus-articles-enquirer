Objectives: To determine whether HRVC-QCE was a distinct HRV-C strain, by determining its genome and prevalence, by cataloguing genomic features for strain discrimination and by observing clinical features in positive patients. Study design: Novel real-time RT-PCRs and retrospective chart reviews were used to investigate a welldefined population of 1247 specimen extracts to observe the prevalence and the clinical features of each HRV-QCE positive case from an in-and out-patient pediatric, hospital-based population during 2003. An objective illness severity score was determined for each HRVC-QCE positive patient. Results: Differences in overall polyprotein and VP1 binding pocket residues and the predicted presence of a cis-acting replication element in 1B defined HRVC-QCE as a novel HRV-C strain. Twelve additional HRVC-QCE detections (1.0% prevalence) occurred among infants and toddlers (1-24 months) suffering mild to moderate illness, including fever and cough, who were often hospitalized. HRVC-QCE was frequently detected in the absence of another virus and was the only virus detected in three (23% of HRVC-QCE positives) children with asthma exacerbation and in two (15%) toddlers with febrile convulsion. Conclusions: HRVC-QCE is a newly identified, genetically distinct HRV strain detected in hospitalized children with a range of clinical features. HRV strains should be independently considered to ensure we do not overestimate the HRVs in asymptomatic illness.",

The most recent significant healthcare impact attributed to HRVs was the 2009 H1N1v influenza pandemic when HRVs were the most common viruses detected among patients qualifying, but laboratory-negative for, pandemic virus testing. 33 Similar findings were described during the SARS-CoV outbreak. 34 A lack of viral sequence data weakens our differential diagnostic and overall detection capabilities which limits our ability to define epidemiological features as well as the occurrence of strain-, or species-specific clinical outcomes and potentially differentiating genetic features. Due to the retrospective nature of our study, no temporally comparable control population was available for testing. This is a limitation among most other HRV studies as is the current inability to culture the newly identified HRVs. When a control population is included however, strain typing is usually not conducted and so a higher proportion of asymptomatic illness is attributed to all HRVs as a total group. Additionally, because we and others cannot fulfil Koch's postulates for the currently unculturable HRV-Cs, the clinical observations cannot be specifically associated with the PCR-determined presence of HRVC-QCE RNA. Our findings highlight the need to better understand the genomics, taxonomy, epidemiology and clinical impact of the newly identified HRV strains to accurately quantify the scope of their clinical impact as distinct respiratory viruses.",
