From the samples used for 16S ribosomal sequencing we recovered, on average, 16,000 sequences per sample, accounting for a total of 2,646 operational taxonomic units across all samples sequenced.

The diagnosis of AS was made according to stringent clinical criteria, defined a priori, consistent with the American Academy of Pediatrics guidelines (6) . Eligible subjects had either: (1) persistent upper respiratory tract symptoms, i.e., 11-29 days of cough (not exclusively nocturnal) and/or nasal symptoms (rhinorrhea of any quality) which was not improving; or (2) 6 to 10 days of worsening symptoms (substantial worsening of nasal symptoms and/or fever after a period of improvement). We excluded children who: 1) had AS with severe presentation; 2) had received antimicrobial treatment within 15 days before presentation; 3) had evidence of another infection (i.e., acute otitis media or pneumonia); 4) had underlying immune deficiency, cystic fibrosis, ciliary dyskinesis, or major developmental delay, or 5) had asthma or allergic rhinitis as a main diagnosis for the presenting symptoms.

For swabs processed using the partition methods, the distal portion of the cut swab was used to inoculate the plates. Cultures were incubated overnight at 37\u00b0C with 5% CO 2 . If no growth was present after overnight incubation, the culture was reincubated for another 24 hours. Growth of pathogenic bacteria (S. pneumoniae, H. influenzae, and M. catarrhalis) was assessed using standard techniques (9) (growth in 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 quadrants); 3+ and 4+ were considered heavy growth.",
