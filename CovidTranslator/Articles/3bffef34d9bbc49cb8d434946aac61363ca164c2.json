We assessed the impact of introducing the Enigma\u00ae MiniLab\u2122 FluAB-RSV point-of-care test (POCT) on patients admitted with a suspected respiratory virus driven illness in an acute pediatric ward. This utilized a before and after design (respiratory viral seasons 2013/14 versus 2014/15). Following POCT implementation, oseltamivir prescribing increased in patients with influenza (OR = 12.7, P = 0.05, 95% CI [1.0, 153.8]). A reduction in the average reimbursement charges without a change in the length of stay was observed. Modeling suggested that laboratory test cost savings could be achieved if the POCT cost \u00a330 and was used for screening, followed by the respiratory viral panel for RSV and influenza negative patients. A rapid POCT for influenza A/B and RSV infections in pediatric inpatients may improve oseltamivir prescribing, strengthen antimicrobial stewardship, reduce reimbursement charges and decrease laboratory costs.",

Moreover, these tests have lower sensitivities compared to PCR-based devices (Boku et al., 2013; DiMaio et al., 2012; Goldenberg and Edgeworth, 2015) .

Inpatient admission data was collected during the main influenza season between November 1 and February 28 of two consecutive years, for patients having a Respiratory Viral Panel (RVP) (xTAG\u00ae RVPfast2, Luminex Corp, Austin, TX) ordered within 72 hours of admission. Patients admitted during the 2013/14 season when only the RVP was used (period 1) were compared (with data collected retrospectively) to those during the 2014/15 season, in which both the POCT and the RVP were used in parallel (period 2). In period 2, the POCT was available for use 24 hours a day, 7 days a week for any patient admitted to Mountain Ward who required a swab taken for respiratory virus diagnostic testing. The final sample size was 274 (period 1) and 300 (period 2) (see Appendix 2 for details, Supplementary Data). Staff were encouraged to act on the POCT result although no formal protocol was introduced. Study outcomes are presented from the perspective of the National Health Service (NHS). Research Ethics Committee approval was waived as this was classified as a service evaluation.

However, UK sentinel hospital surveillance indicated that the proportion of confirmed Influenza A confirmed hospitalized cases in those under the age of 17 years was lower in 2014/15 than 2013/14 (22% and 27% respectively). Excess all-cause mortality in all age groups increased from 0.2% in 2013/14 to 5.4% in 2014/15. Despite these differences, we did not observe any significant differences in the distribution of respiratory viruses during the study periods (Table 2) . Conversely, we observed a greater rate of recorded complications (22.3% vs. 13.0%, P b 0.01 for 2013/14 and 2014/15 respectively) in the study population.",

Overall vaccine effectiveness may also have been different for the two periods (Caspard et al., 2017) . It is not known what these differences may have had on the study findings. For example, it is possible that the change in oseltamivir prescribing was influenced by the increasing incidence of influenza A and/or increase in all cause excess mortality over the two periods. However, as these are national data and these parameters were not measured for the study population, it is not possible draw any definitive conclusions.

Results from a questionnaire conducted at the time of the study suggested that ward staff felt the test improved bed management (results available upon request from the authors). We recommend conducting a time and motion analysis to capture other cost drivers, such as staff time. Further studies should also explore a packaged antimicrobial stewardship intervention involving an influenza/RSV POCT, including staff training on best prescribing practice following the POCT result. This study demonstrates that POCTs may have the potential to improve the appropriateness and efficiency of management of ILI in pediatric patients and strengthen antimicrobial stewardship practice.",
