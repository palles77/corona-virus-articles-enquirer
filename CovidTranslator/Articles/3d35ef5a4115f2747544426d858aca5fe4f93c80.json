            "text": "Fifteen isolates of Infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) were obtained from the kidney, trachea, and cecal tonsil of IB suspected chickens between 2001 and 2002 years in Korea. The S1 glycoprotein gene of IBV isolates were amplified by reverse transcriptase -polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and analyzed by restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis. Fifteen Korean IBV isolates were classified into 4 groups by their RFLP patterns using restriction enzymes, HaeIII, BstYI, and XcmI. The RFLP patterns for 3, 1, and 1 of 15 isolates corresponded to the patterns of IBV Arkansas, Connecticut, and Massachusetts strains, respectively. Ten of 15 isolates generated unique KM91 RFLP pattern that was observed in the IBV KM 91 strain previously isolated in Korea. To confirm genetic diversity in the S1 genes of IBV isolates, viral RNAs of representative 9 of 15 IBV isolates were amplified, cloned, sequenced and compared with published sequences for non-Korean IBV strains. Korean IBV isolates showed amino acid sequence similarity between 61.8% (K446-01 and K161-02) and 96.1% (K281-01 and K210-02) with each other and they showed amino acid sequence similarity between 42.9% (K161-02 and GA980470) and 96.5% (K203-02 and KB8523) compared to non-Korean IBV strains. By phylogenetic tree analysis, Korean IBV field isolates were branched into five clusters in which 3 clusters were differentiated from non-Korean IBV strains. Especially, Korean IBV isolates K069-01, K507-01, K774-01 and K142-02 formed a separate cluster. It seems that IBVs continue to evolve and IBVs showing various genetic differences may cocirculate in Korea.",

It is a pleomorphic enveloped virus with club-shaped surface projections (spikes) on the surface of the virion and its genome consists of the single stranded positive-sense RNA genome of approximately 27 kilobases [1] . The virion contains four major structural proteins: the spike (S) glycoprotein, the membrane (M) glycoprotein, the envelope (E) glycoprotein, and the nucleocapsid (N) protein [24, 30] . The S glycoprotein of IBV is posttranslationally cleaved into N-terminal S1 and C-terminal S2 subunits [7, 30] . The S1 glycoprotein forms the distal, bulbous part of the spike, and the S2 glycoprotein anchors the S1 glycoprotein to the viral membrane [3] . The S1 subunit is known to contain regions that induce neutralizing, serotype-specific, and hemagglutination-inhibiting antibodies [5, 18, 27] .",

Six genotype I IBV isolates showed similar RFLP patterns to Mass type of IBV and only 2 genotype II IBV isolates were only isolated in 1986. Twenty-nine genotype III IBV (KM91 type) isolates showed distinct RFLP patterns in PCR-RFLP analysis using restriction enzymes HaeIII, EcoRI, and BamHI [29] . The KM91 isolate is the representative genotype III isolate. Genotypes IV andV were newly isolated in 1995. In this study, 10 of 15 field IBV isolates were classified as the KM91 type and 3 isolates were classified as Arkansas and 1 as Connecticut types. In pathogenicity tests, isolate KM91 caused 50% mortality, severe nephritis and renal urate deposition in the kidneys of infected chicks, but genotypes I, II, IV and V only induced respiratory distress at 1 to 2 days after inoculation [29] . The H120 vaccine could not protect chicks against challenge with the KM91 isolate, genotype III. Therefore, the KM91 type has seemed to be a major IBV circulating in Korea. The Korean IBV K203-02 isolate showed both Massachusetts and KM91 type RFLP patterns in PCR-RFLP analysis. The detection and differentiation of two different kinds of viruses in a single sample is a significant advantage of RT-PCR-RFLP analysis which other researchers have also reported [2] .",

            "text": "In the phylogenetic tree, Korean IBV isolates formed five distinct clusters. Korean IBV K446-01 isolate was clustered into Mass41 group although it was classified into the Connecticut group by PCR-RFLP analysis. Korean IBV K203-02 isolate was clustered into the same genotypic clade as non-Korean IBV strains KB8523, H120, and D41 that were an attenuated vaccine strains [21, 26, 31] . Therefore, K203-02 isolate appears to be originated from a vaccine strain. Korean IBV K281-01 and K210-02 isolates formed distinct clusters that were related to non-Korean IBV Ark99, Ark DPI, Gray and JMK strains although K281-01 and K210-02 isolates were classified into the Arkansas type by PCR-RFLP analysis. Two Korean IBV isolates K281-01 and K210-02 had the same Arg-Arg-Ser-Arg-Arg on spike glycoprotein cleavage recognition sites as the non-Korean IBV strains Ark DPI, Gray, and JMK [14] . Spike glycoprotein cleavage recognition site does not appear to correlate with serotype or pathogenicity [14] . Korean IBV K161-02 isolate formed a distinct cluster although it was classified into the KM 91 type with other several IBV isolates by PCR-RFLP analysis. It showed 61.8% to 64.3% amino acid sequence similarity compared to other Korean IBV isolates, which was lower similarity than other IBV isolates. It was noteworthy that K161-02 isolate was related to non-Korean IBV isolate DE072 and GA980470 in the phylogenetic tree although it showed 42.9% (K161-02 and GA980470) to 43.4% (K161-02 and DE072) amino acid sequence similarity. The IBV DE072 strain was involved in IB outbreaks of broilers on the Delmarva peninsula, U.S.A. in 1992, and it was classified into the Delaware variant (DE var) type by virus-neutralization tests, cross-challenge tests and S-1 gene analysis [12] . The IBV GA980479 strain was isolated from broilers in Georgia, U.S.A. and is similar to the IBV DE072 strain [25] . But it was genetically distinct from IBV DE072 and shared very low antigenic relatedness with IBV DE072 and other IBV isolates and thus was designated into a new serotype, Georgia 98 [25] . It seems that the Korean IBV K161-02 isolate may be one of the Korean IBV variants. Further characterization by virus-neutralization tests and cross-challenge tests using several IBV strains will be needed. The Korean IBV K069-01, K507-01, K774-01, and K142-02 formed a distinct cluster that consists of only Korean IBV isolates. They were classified into the IBV KM91 type by PCR-RFLP analysis, which has been isolated mainly in Korea [29] .",

Widespread uses of various vaccines made from heterologous IBVs in the field may play an important role in increasing the number of new genetic variants in Korea.",
