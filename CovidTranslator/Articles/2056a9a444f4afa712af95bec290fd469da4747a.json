Main reasons, of course, being our high population density, geographical location, and our close economic ties with epicenter of the outbreak. Therefore, despite the scarcity of information available to us, we are pulling whatever we have out of a hat to contain the spread. Many actions are particularly notable which were undertaken just within a matter of a month (Fig. 1) .",

Just before the holidays, the Central Epidemic Command Center (CECC) was activated for critical roles of oversight, coordination, and communication. Second, owing to our universal healthcare system, we have the advantage of using our National Health Insurance (NHI) IC cards found on each of our residents, to identify individuals with recent travel history to and from China whenever they seek healthcare at service providers. Hospitals and medical staff are immediately alerted prior to care even if patients fail to disclose such information. This was all made possible by the cross-sectoral work between NHI Administration and immigrations agency.",
