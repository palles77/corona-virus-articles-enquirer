            "text": "Summary For a virus to survive and replicate in an organism, it must employ strategies to evade and misdirect the host's immune response. There is compelling evidence that the primary immunoevasive strategy utilized by the SARS virus, like influenza, is to inhibit its host's corticosteroid stress response. This is accomplished by viral expression of amino acid sequences that are molecular mimics of the host's adrenocorticotropin hormone (ACTH). When the host produces antibodies against these viral antigens, the antibodies also bind to the host's own ACTH, which limits the host's stress response by interfering with ACTH's ability to stimulate the secretion of corticosteroids. This inadequate corticosteroid response provokes symptoms as a result of a relative adrenocortical insufficiency. Treatment with corticosteroids can relieve the patient's symptoms of adrenocortical insufficiency and give them the corticosteroid levels needed to fight their infection. Similarly, by taking moderate daily doses of corticosteroids as a prophylactic, it may be possible to avoid clinical infection with SARS. If SARS's ACTH mimic strategy never has an opportunity to get started, SARS's ability to evade its host's immune system while its viral load is low will be significantly impaired. In this article, amino acid sequences from the SARS and influenza viruses representing likely homology to human ACTH are identified. Evidence demonstrating that ACTH autoantibodies are produced during influenza infection is also presented. Early treatment with corticosteroids should lower the dose necessary to counteract SARS's ACTH autoantibody mechanism. If corticosteroid treatment is delayed until inflammatory cytokine levels are causing serious injury, only high doses of corticosteroids are likely to be effective. c 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

[10] reported that influenza-infected patients had normal serum cortisol levels but low ACTH levels. These results are difficult to reconcile unless the patients' serum contained abnormal binding agents to ACTH. For example, if these patients had autoantibodies to ACTH, the antibodies would have interfered with the ACTH immunoassay, especially if the autoantibodies and assay antibodies were competing for the same antigenic region of the ACTH molecule, which is likely. This would result in an erroneously low ACTH reading. The assay would only measure unbound ACTH, as demonstrated in the report by Pranzatelli et al. [11] of a 9-year old boy with opsoclonus-myoclonus who was determined to have ACTH levels of 72 and 4.3 pg/ml using conventional ACTH immunoassay analyses. After solid-phase extraction of the ACTH, the total ACTH level measured by radioimmunoassay was 3000 pg/ ml. ACTH antibodies were subsequently detected in the boy's serum. Similarly, Jefferies et al.'s ACTH data only approximates the free ACTH levels.

Furthermore, unlike the increased corticosteroid levels that would be expected during a systemic immune response, influenza-infected patients do not have increased cortisol levels [10] . For example, rats injected with sheep red blood cells demonstrated two to threefold increases in corticosteroid levels [13] .

If SARS induces production of ACTH autoantibodies, then all SARS patients should benefit from early, sustained treatment with corticosteroids. If patients exhibiting the first signs of SARS infection are given stress levels of corticosteroids (40-60 mg oral prednisone twice a day for adults), the patients should feel better and the virus will be deprived of its primary immunoevasive strategy, which should make SARS more vulnerable to the immune system. Patients that are already stressed due to an existing medical condition will require higher doses. An initial loading dose of corticosteroids may also prove to be beneficial.",

When interfering ACTH autoantibodies are abundant, ACTH is hypersecreted, as in Pranzatelli et al.'s [11] patient with ACTH antibodies who had total ACTH levels 200 times normal. Since ACTH is more prevalent than SARS antigens, to the immune system, the ACTH invader appears to be the more serious threat, for which a larger proportion of resources must be mobilized. This attenuates the antibody response to SARS. If a sufficient dose of corticosteroids is given, this will significantly suppress the pituitary gland's secretion of ACTH and the ACTH antibody response will abate, which will allow the antibody response to SARS to increase.",
