En algunos de estos casos la infecci\u00f3n por EV-D68 se ha asociado a enfermedad neurol\u00f3gica grave. Aunque en poblaci\u00f3n europea la circulaci\u00f3n de este serotipo parece ser baja, el ECDC recuerda la necesidad de reforzar la vigilancia, especialmente en pacientes hospitalizados. En octubre de 2014, en las muestras respiratorias de 5 pacientes ingresados en el Hospital Universitario Vall d'Hebron de Barcelona, se pudieron detectar enterovirus. Estos fueron caracterizados como EV-D68 mediante an\u00e1lisis filogen\u00e9tico de las secuencias parciales codificantes para la prote\u00edna viral VP1. Estas secuencias eran adem\u00e1s similares a las de las cepas aisladas en los \u00faltimos meses en EEUU. Estos 5 pacientes presentaron s\u00edntomas respiratorios, pero s\u00f3lo uno requiri\u00f3 ingreso en la Unidad de Cuidados Intensivos. Sin embargo, ninguno de los pacientes present\u00f3 s\u00edntomas de enfermedad neurol\u00f3gica. En este trabajo se comentan tambi\u00e9n consideraciones relacionadas con los m\u00e9todos de diagn\u00f3stico para enterovirus, especialmente para este serotipo. En conclusi\u00f3n, en este trabajo se confirma el posible papel etiol\u00f3gico del EV-D68 en la infecci\u00f3n respiratoria del paciente ingresado.",

In addition, a large outbreak is currently occurring in North America (Canada and United States) 5 and causing substantial hospitalisation of children with severe respiratory disease, some of them with acute neurologic illness. 6 The circulation of EV-D68 in the general population seems to be low, although the risk of EV-D68 transmission in European countries remains moderate. In fact, epidemic clusters of severe disease by EV-D68 have not been still reported. Therefore, European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) reminds of the need to be vigilant to new EV-D68 cases in Europe, particularly in severe hospitalised patients.",

In the present study the first hospitalised EV-D68 cases in Spain in October 2014 were reported. were included in the present study. Among this heterogeneous group of patients, all cases with suspicion of viral ARI admitted to the units of Intensive Medicine, Onco-Hematology, Pneumology, Neurology and Neonatology were included to increase the chance to detect EV-D68 associated with severe respiratory disease. The specific EV detection was simultaneously performed by a commercial real-time RT-PCR (SmartEV, Cepheid, USA), not only to enhance EV detection, but also to avoid the likely false results due to the high genetic similarity between rhinoviruses and enterovirus (in particular for EV-D68). 1 Institutional Review Board approval was obtained from the Hospital Universitari Vall d'Hebron Clinical Research Ethics Committee. Phylogenetic analysis of the sequences of partial EV VP1 region 1 was carried out using MEGA v6 7 to determine the type of the detected enteroviruses. Sequences from previous molecular epidemiological studies were downloaded from GenBank (GB) Database to be included in the phylogenetic analysis (GB accession numbers are shown in the taxons of the phylogenetic tree) together with recent EV-D68 characterised in The Netherlands and USA. 4 The molecular evolutionary models of nucleotide substitution were fitted to the multiple sequence alignment using evolutionary analyses conducted in MEGA v6. 7 The phylogenetic tree was constructed using a neighbour-joining distance method as implemented in MEGA v6 with the evolutionary model with lowest Bayesian information Criterion score. 7 The topological accuracy of the tree was evaluated by the bootstrap method (1000 replicates).

            "text": "The acute flaccid paralysis detected in the USA and Canada in children with EV-D68 infection has raised concerns about the aetiological role of this EV serotype in severe neurological disease. 6 Recently, the first case of AFP following EV-D68 infection was reported in France. 10 None of our EV-D68 infected patients had symptoms of neurological disease or paralysis, as also shown among patients of the last Dutch report. 10 The severity of clinical symptoms seems to be related with the presence of underlying diseases. Therefore, four of the patients in our series had risk factors to develop severe respiratory infections, and EV-D68 acquisition was nosocomial in three patients, but only one suffered severe bronchiolitis that required mechanical ventilation (Table 2 ). Anyway, clinicians should be on the alert for severe respiratory illness in children that might be caused by infection with EV-D68 for an early diagnosis. Although there are no vaccines or specific treatments for EV-D68 infection, and clinical care is only supportive, the detection and identification of these viruses could help in explaining serious respiratory illness, giving guidance to medical care, preventing unnecessary treatment with antibiotics and adopting the isolation protocols to avoid the nosocomial transmission. In the last 5 years the circulation of three different EV-D68 clades (major groups 1, 2 and 3) based on the phylogenetic analysis of VP1 sequence was reported. 3, 4, 8 The EV-D68 strains characterised in this study belonged to the major group 3, and were similar to the strains recently described in The Netherlands that fell into this cluster. 4 Some amino acid substitutions including an amino acid deletion at position 140 were found (Table 1) in the VP1 amino acid sequences from strains belonging to the major group 3 relative to Fermon strain, which differentiate them from the other strains belonging to the other two major groups. Since most of the amino acid differences fell into the BC-and DE-loops, these might be associated with changes in the antigenicity features, as previously described. 9 However, an association between these virological features and the severity of infection cannot be established.",

Previously, in our laboratory Seegene's method was only used as the routine diagnostic method for the detection of respiratory viruses, including all EV serotypes, as commercially approved. But similar Seegene's products such as Seeplex \u00ae RV15ACE Detection kit (Seegene, Korea) did not seem to detect EV-D68 in a multi-centre study in the Netherlands. 11 The decision to use it in parallel with a commercial EV-specific diagnostic test was made both to avoid false results as RV, and to assure the detection of the different known EV serotypes in order to accomplish with ECDC recommendations. The respiratory virus most frequently detected in the studied samples was RV, as expected for this period of the year, but none of these RV laboratory-confirmed samples were positive using Cepheid's EV-specific RT-PCR assay. It excluded the possibility that other EV, in particular EV-D68 cases, were wrongly identified as RV. However, the fact that Seegene's method is used by many European laboratories to detect EV in addition to other respiratory viruses suggests that the EV-D68 prevalence and its importance in Europe might therefore be underestimated.",
