            "text": "In contrast to BALB/c mouse macrophages (MF), MF from the A/J mouse strain, upon activation by exogenous interferon gamma (IFNg), develop an anti-mouse hepatitis virus 3 (MHV3) state which correlates with resistance to virus infection. To investigate the autocrine activation of BALB/c and A/J MF, we activated them with interleukin-12 (IL-12) and/or IL-18, and quantified IFNg production, the anti-MHV3 state and arginine metabolism. Synergistic activation by IL-12/IL-18 induced the expression of the IFNg gene in MF from both mouse strains. In bone marrow (BM) or peritoneal (P) MF of specific pathogen-free (spf) mice of both strains, IFNg synthesis occurred only with a synergistic IL-12/IL-18 activation and showed increasing levels from 24 to 72 h of activation. In contrast, when non-spf mice were used in the assay, their PMF synthesized higher IFNg levels upon activation with only IL-12 or only IL-18 or both. The BALB/c MF were always capable of synthesizing higher amounts of IFNg than the A/J MF. An anti-MHV3 state was observed only in A/J MF upon activation with IL-12/IL-18 or IFNg regardless of their origin from the peritoneum or bone marrow. Arginine metabolism in activated and/or virus infected BMMF was investigated through nitric oxide (NO) and arginase induction as well as the consumption of arginine and synthesis of citrulline, ornithine and spermine. The results showed that both BALB/c and A/J BMMF populations released NO only after activation with IL-12/IL-18 or IFNg. Arginase was not induced in BMMF from both strains by IL-12/IL-18 or IFNg but only by IL-4/IL-10. Higher arginine consumption was observed in BMMF from both strains upon activation with IL-4 or IFNg which further increased, in this case, when the cells were infected with MHV3. As a consequence of nitric oxide synthase synthesis and arginine consumption in IFNg activated BMMF, we observed a higher synthesis of citrulline. High levels of ornithine were induced only upon IL-4 activation. Polyamine synthesis was higher in A/J BMMF than in BALB/c ones, which correlated with the slightly lower levels of ornithine observed. Upon infection with MHV3, we observed a higher synthesis of spermine. IL-12/IL-18 or IFNg activation, mainly in MHV3 infected cells, led to a decreased synthesis of polyamines, notably spermine, only in A/J BMMF. Difluoromethylornithine treatment, which leads to inhibition of polyamine synthesis, induced a decreased MHV3 multiplication in www.elsevier.de/imbio (C.A. Pereira). both BALB/c and A/J BMMF. Altogether these data show the relevance of IFNg, from the autocrine or paracrine pathway, and arginine metabolism for the control of MHV3 replication in MF of a resistant mouse strain.",

            "text": "Mouse hepatitis virus 3 (MHV3) is a natural murine viral infection that, in experimental conditions, has a resistance pattern dependent on the genetic background of the animal. BALB/c mice are susceptible and adult A/J mice are resistant to MHV3. Our previous studies have shown that resistance to MHV3 infection in mouse populations can be a consequence of a T-cell dependent mechanism, in which the production of interferon-g (IFNg) and the sensitivity of macrophages (MF) to IFNg play an essential role (Vassa\u02dco et al., 2000) . We have shown that the resistance of A/J mice to an MHV3 isolate that we have cloned, selected and amplified, is acquired after immunization with ultraviolet inactivated MHV3 (uvMHV3) and that IFNg activation induces an antiviral state only in MF from resistant mice, leading to a partial restriction of multiplication by significantly delaying virus replication. Recently, we have demonstrated that murine MF are capable of secreting IFNg upon a synergistic stimulation with interleukin (IL)-12 and IL-18, or an autocrine and T-cell independent MF activation mechanism (Munder et al., 1998a (Munder et al., , 2001 .",

            "text": "In MF, nitric oxide synthase (NOS) and arginase are inducible enzymes that act on a common substrate, arginine. As a consequence, arginine is oxidized by NOS producing citrulline and nitric oxide (NO) or is hydrolyzed by arginases producing ornithine and urea. Ornithine is in turn catabolyzed by ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) for polyamine (putrescine, spermidine and spermine) biosynthesis or ornithine amino transferase (OAT) for glutamate or proline synthesis (Fig. 1) . Difluoromethylornithine (DFMO), an analog of ornithine that inhibits ODC, has been used in the study of polyamine depletion (Wang and Wong, 2003) . Polyamines, such as spermine, play several roles in cell differentiation and proliferation (Thomas and Thomas, 2001) . Despite contradictory observations, it is generally accepted that polyamines contribute to virus maturation (Cohen, 1998) . We have recently shown that a competition between NOS and arginase for their substrate takes place in mouse bone marrow-derived MF (BMMF) and that they appear to define two alternate functional states of MF, induced by, respectively, Th1 (IFNg) and Th2 cytokines (IL-4 and IL-10) (Munder et al., 1998b (Munder et al., , 1999 . These cytokines would also differentially regulate NOS2 and arginase 1 in vivo (Hesse et al., 2001) .",

Protective effects of NO have been related to infections involving ectromelia, vaccinia and herpes simplex 1 viruses (Harris et al., 1995; Melkova and Esteban, 1995) , Coxsackie B3 virus (Lowenstein et al., 1996; Saura et al., 1999) , Epstein-Barr virus (Kawanishi, 1995) and Japanese encephalitis virus (Saxena et al., 2000 (Saxena et al., , 2001 . On the other hand, there are indications that NO may not be essential for virus clearance in vaccinia virus-infected mice (Rolph et al., 1996) or tick-borne encephalitis virus infection (Kreil and Eibl, 1996) . Although arginase induction in MF and its consequences has been poorly studied (Corraliza et al., , 1997 Modolell et al., 1995) , some reports implicate arginase in antiviral activities in MF, tumor cell cytotoxicity and immune response (Bansal and Ochoa, 2003; Mistry et al., 2001; Ochoa et al., 2001) .

Later published data indicate that resistance to MHV3 is dependent on the production of NO (Pope et al., 1998) . Besides the fact that different mechanisms may contribute to resistance, a controversial finding seems to be a defect of NO production in susceptible BALB/c mice. Nevertheless, recent studies indicate that BALB/c mice are capable of producing NO in vivo (Fabre et al., 2004; Kwon et al., 2004) . Unpublished data from our group show also that, in certain conditions, BALB/c mice are capable of producing NO in vivo, as evaluated by direct Electron Paramagnetic Resonance (EPR) spectroscopy in blood and liver. Genetic differences of the virus isolate or mouse strain used, as well as the basic mechanism considered for resistance may account for the divergent findings.",

As clearly described in another publication (Munder et al., 2001) these BMMF population are homogeneously F4/80+, MAC-1+, I-A+, B7.1+, CD16/32+ with no detectable cells expressing T, B or NK cell markers (CD3, CD4, CD8, CD19, CD5, B220, DX5, NK1.1). Cells were cultured in non-toxic Teflon bags (fluorinated ethylene propylene, Biofolie 25; Heraeus GmbH, Hanau, Germany) as described (Munder et al., 1998a) . The Teflon foils were folded and sealed with a diathermal sealing apparatus (Polystar 100 B and Polystar 401 M-RPA; Rische+Herfurth GmBH, Hamburg, Germany) to give rectangular bags, and subjected to gas sterilization. Cells (5 \u00c2 10 4 /ml) in DMEM with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) (Biochrom AG), 5% horse serum (Invitrogen-Gibco Co., Carlsbad, CA), 15% L929 supernatant as a source of colony-stimulating factor, 100 U/ml penicillin, 100 mg/ml streptomycin, 1% sodium pyruvate (Invitrogen-Gibco) and 0.5% 2-mercaptothanol (Sigma) were incubated for 12 days at 37 1C in the presence of 10% CO 2 . Cells were detached by repeated careful stretching of the medium, transferred to 96-well microplates at a concentration of 2 \u00c2 10 5 cells/100 ml and used in the experiments. Peritoneal macrophages (PMF) were prepared from peritoneal exudate cells collected by peritoneal lavage with DMEM containing 10% FBS and cultured in 96-well microplates at a concentration of 2 \u00c2 10 5 cells/ 100ml. The cells were incubated for 2 h at 37 1C in 5% CO 2 , washed three times with DMEM after vigorous shaking to remove non adherent cells and used in the experiments. Although carefully treated, the PMF population may contain a few other cells. MHV3, originally obtained by the Institute of Virology, University Louis Pasteur, Strasbourg from Dr. J.L. Virelizier, Institut Pasteur, Paris, was cloned by limiting dilution; one plaque was selected and amplified on L929 cells to serve as the inoculum for future stocks to limit spontaneous mutations. Samples were then transferred to the Max Planck Institute of Immunobiology, Freiburg and to the Laboratory of Virus Immunology, Institute Butantan, Sa\u02dco Paulo. Aliquots containing 2 \u00c2 10 5 plaque-forming units per milliliter (PFU/ml) were stored at \u00c080 1C and used in all experiments.

The treatment of BMMF from these spf mice with only IL-12 or IL-18 failed to either induce expression of the IFNg gene or secretion of IFNg during the first 48 h. BALB/c mouse MF were shown to regularly synthesize higher amounts of IFNg (3200760 pg/ml for BALB/c BMMF and 1600720 pg/ ml for A/J BMMF after 72 h of activation) and the studies showed that, in BMMF of both mouse strains, the IFNg mRNA and secreted IFNg could be detected after 24 h of IL-12/IL-18 activation. The amount of secreted IFNg present in supernatants increased consistently from 24 to 72 h (from 1500720 to 3200760 pg/ml in BALB/c BMMF and from 500710 to 1600720 pg/ml in A/J BMMF).

Among the mechanisms proposed for resistance of some mouse strains to experimental MHV3 infection (Fingerote et al., 1996; Lamontagne et al., 1996) , we have described a T-cell dependent one in which IFNg synthesis and MF sensitivity to IFNg play a central role. Susceptible mice would develop a fatal hepatitis by lacking either the ability to synthesize IFNg or cells capable of responding to IFNg. IFNg would exert its activity by down-regulating the expression of the main viral receptor (Vassa\u02dco et al., 2000) . Recently, we have also shown a novel pathway of autocrine MF activation by demonstrating that MF, upon synergistic stimulation with IL-12 and IL-18, are a potent IFNgproducing cell (Munder et al., 1998a) . BMMF are a reliable non contaminated population which can support these findings (Munder et al., 2001) . So, along with the classical or paracrine MF activation by IFNg produced by lymphoid cells, an autocrine MF activation could take place, where IFNg is produced by IL-12/IL-18-activated MF. Although their relative magnitudes are not yet known, both processes occurring in MF could play a crucial role in controlling infections.",

The data presented show that synergistic activation by IL-12/IL-18 of MF from resistant (A/J) and susceptible (BALB/c) mouse strains induced the expression of the IFNg gene ( Fig. 2A) . BMMF or PMF of both spf mouse strains secreted IFNg upon a synergistic IL-12/IL-18 activation (Fig.  2C ) and the levels of secreted IFNg increased along the time of stimulation and were higher in BALB/c MF (Figs. 2B and C) . Nevertheless, an anti-MHV3 state was observed only in A/J MF upon a synergistic activation with IL-12/IL-18 or with exogenous IFNg (Fig. 3) . As expected, in the PMF of non-spf animals, IFNg synthesis could be observed also among MF stimulated only with IL-12 or IL-18. Taken together, these results demonstrate that autocrine MF activation takes place in both BALB/c and A/J MF and, as shown for paracrine IFNg MF activation, only A/J MF respond with the expression of an anti-MHV3 state. Both BMMF and PMF behave similarly regarding IFNg synthesis and anti-MHV3 state. Among non-spf mice, which better mirror the natural state of mice concerning this endemic virus infection, their PMF synthesize high levels of IFNg upon treatment with only IL-12 or IL-18 possibly due to their already immunologically primed state or to the presence of other cells. The evidence that, after 72 h, the BMMF from spf mice synthesized some IFNg upon stimulation of only IL-18, may rely on the autocrine pathway. The contribution of each, the paracrine, T-cell dependent, and the autocrine, T-cell independent, mechanism of MF activation during MHV3 infection remains to be determined. It is conceivable that autocrine-IFNg synthesis participates in early stages of infection, prior to specific antigen recognition by lymphoid cells, not only by enhancing the MF ability to restrict the agent's infectivity but also by enhancing the MF ability to present antigens. By this way, autocrine MF activation would represent a link between the innate and acquired immune response (Frucht et al., 2001) .",

NO is a highly reactive molecule produced from a guanidine-nitrogen of arginine in a reaction catalyzed by NOS. NO is synthesized at high levels by MF upon stimulation by Th1 cytokines (Hesse et al., 2001; Munder et al., 1999) and has been implicated in host defense (Guillemard et al., 1996; Harris et al., 1995; Kawanishi 1995 Melkova and Esteban, 1995; Tucker et al., 1996) . Arginase, an enzyme induced in MF upon stimulation by Th2 cytokines (Hesse et al., 2001; Munder et al., 1999) , drives the synthesis of ornithine, which is catalyzed by ODC to form polyamines (putrescine, spermidine and spermine). DFMO, an analog of ornithine, can irreversibly inhibit ODC causing polyamine depletion. Arginase has been implicated in virus inhibition and may potentially have an antimicrobial activity OR play an antimicrobial role Modolell et al., 1995) . Polyamines, such as spermine, play several roles in cell differentiation and proliferation and may contribute to virus maturation (Cohen, 1998; Thomas and Thomas, 2001; Wang and Wong, 2003) .

Arginase was induced only when IL-4/IL-10 was used for activation (Fig. 4B ). Higher arginine consumption was observed in BMMF from both strains upon IFNg or IL-4 activation and, as expected, IFNg activation led to higher citrulline synthesis and IL-4 activation to higher ornithine synthesis (Figs. 1, 5B and 5C). Both arginine consumption and spermine synthesis increased during MHV3 infection. Although IL-12/IL-18 activation of both BALB/c and A/J BMMF led to NO synthesis (Fig. 4A) , a higher consumption of arginine was not observed in this situation (Fig. 5A ). IL-12/IL-18 or IFNg activation, mainly in MHV3 infected cells, led to a decreased synthesis of spermine only in A/J BMMF (Fig. 5D ). The putrescine and spermidine pattern levels followed that of spermine but at lower levels (data not shown). Intracellular polyamines were shown to be important during MHV3 replication since, in DFMO-treated BMMF, we detected a significant decrease in MHV3 titer (Table 1) .",

The lack of arginase induction indicates the Th1 behavior of this type of autocrine activation. The fact that upon exposure to IL-12/IL-18, which induces endogenous IFNg (Fig. 2) and NO (Fig. 4) , we failed to observe the expected arginine consumption and citrulline synthesis, clearly observed when exogenous IFNg was employed (Figs. 5A and B), may rely on inherent quantitative and kinetic characteristics of the process.",

In these MF, polyamines were induced during MHV3 infection and significantly inhibited upon activation by IFNg or IL-12/IL-18. Supported by the data showing a decreased MHV3 replication in DFMO treated MF (Table 1) , the polyamine modulation by IFNg correlates with the anti-MHV3 state observed only among A/J MF. Nevertheless, the molecular basis of a mechanism underlying the influence of IFNg on polyamine synthesis remains unclear.",
