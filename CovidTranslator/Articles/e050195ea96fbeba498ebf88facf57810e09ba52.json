Some air pollution monitoring, analysis, and prediction systems were proposed to solve the problem. However, there is very little research to see whether the air quality is associated with the Influenza-Like Illness (ILI) disease or not. In this study, a system is needed, in which the air quality data and the influenza-like illness data can be analyzed together to determine their associations accurately and effectively. In this work, a novel integrated platform was implemented by building a cluster environment based on Hadoop, Spark and a visualization environment with ELK Stack as well as a backup storage system based on Ceph object storage architecture. Also, Sqoop and Alluxio were used to solve the inefficiency problem in processing vast amounts of data. The experimental results showed the visualization of air quality and influenza-like illness data collected from 2016 to 2017 in Taichung, Taiwan. Besides, the association analyses and discussion between air quality and influenzalike illness were also presented.",

            "text": "In recent years, air pollution has attracted increasing attention globally as it significantly impacted global health (Gheorghe & Ion, 2011; Yuan, Zhang, Wang, Wang, & Zuo, 2017) . Worldwide air pollution-related mortality was estimated at around 6.5 million in 2012 (Influenza-like illness concept, 2014). In Taiwan, urbanization and the rapid development of various industries have made air pollution an critical concern. Obtaining real-time air quality information is of great importance for air pollution prevention. Thus, it is necessary to perform air pollution analysis and prediction to determine changing trends in air pollution and to propose prevention strategies. However, since the collected air pollution data is not only dynamically evolving and vast, a lot of computation resources are needed. In addition, it is difficult to analyze the data effectively and reliably in stand-alone computation environments. Therefore, an integrated platform of air pollution monitoring was constructed by using Spark (Spark yarn, 2016; Geng & Zhang, 2017; Yang, Chan, Liu, & Lou, 2017; Yang, Chen, Den, Wang, & Kristiani, 2018) , R (Liu et al., 2018) and ELK Stack (LangiWidyawan et al., 2015, pp. 181-186; Prakash, Kakkar, & Patel, 2016) based on Hadoop framework to provide a real-time and easy-to-use big data analysis and visualization environment. In this work, the real-time data of air pollution and influenza-like illness were collected from the open data websites provided by the environmental protection administration and the Taiwan CDC open data portal, respectively. In addition, HDFS and Alluxio software were employed to build the cloud storage framework. The Ceph object storage environment was also developed as the backup storage framework. Through the dashboard created by ELK Stack software, users could quickly realize the association analyses between air pollution and influenza-like illness in Taiwan in a visualized way.",

Ceph storage clusters are designed to run on commodity hardware, using an algorithm called CRUSH (Controlled Replication Under Scalable Hashing) to ensure data is evenly distributed across the cluster and that all cluster nodes can retrieve data quickly without any centralized bottlenecks. The Ceph storage system is designed to be self-healing, self-managing and strives to reduce the operational cost. The storage system uniquely delivers object, block, and file storage in one unified system. Ceph object storage is accessible like Amazon S3 (Persico, Montieri, & Pescape, 2016, pp. 113-118; Shetty & Naik, 2017, pp. 507-512) . Open Stack Swift provides a native API for integration with software applications.

In the Spark environment, one of the weaknesses is that data transformation and distribution is implicitly managed by Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS). Data locality does not guarantee for iterative machine learning algorithms which read the same data multiple times. The resulting data shuffling becomes a bottleneck when iteratively reading such RDDs. It needs to write to HDFS first and continue to the next iteration. YinMem et al. in (Huang, Yesha, Halem, Yesha, & Yinmem, 2016) proposed a parallel distributed indexed inmemory computation system, bridged the gap between Hadoop ecosystem and HPC by replacing MapReduce with MPI while obtaining the advantages of the distributed data storage. Ceph distributed storage system is a demanding concentrated multipurpose with saving by object storage daemon. In (Iop science, 2016), authors' motivations are to extend the STAR online compute farm from a simple job processing tool for data taking into a multi-purpose resource equipped with a large storage system would lead any dedicated resources to become an extremely efficient and an attractive multipurpose facility. The Ceph storage system is used to achieve this goal on a 10 GB backbone network for eliminating the network as a limitation. With further acquisition of large fast drive (1 TB SSDs), they showed how they can customize the data placement options. Ceph has to offer such as primary affinity, mounting OSD journals on SSDs and Cache Tiering along with no-Ceph related local disk caching techniques.",

Moreover, PM 2.5 has a good practical association with the incidence of ILI and incidence of ILL is higher in the winter season and southern Taiwan, which is associated with PM 2.5 . Our work provides a real-time gathering of data set and a social event. The results demonstrate an association of multi-factor air pollution and influenza cases, which is the combined effect of several mechanisms. First, high air pollution has been proved to harm both innate and cell-mediated immunity. It may take a period to develop symptoms and signs of influenza after the insults. Second, air pollution is associated with the abundance of microorganisms. The size of influenza virus about 0.08-0.12 \u03bcm is smaller than the PM 2.5 so that airborne pollution particles provide condensation nuclei to which virus droplets attach. The effect of incubation period could play a role in the lag-time effect. In the incubation period is 5-7 days in the cases of influenza, so the lag-effect cannot be explained by organisms inoculation alone. Population susceptibility and C.-T. Yang et al. Computers in Human Behavior 100 (2019) 266-274 immunogenically modulated by genetic factor and environment stimuli would be possible underlying mechanisms in the phenomena. Our study provides a frontier work for the further study of population genetic, host-environment-microorganisms interactions, and epigenetics.",

For data analysis, based on our trend charts air pollution has an impact on Influenza-Like Illness disease, actually for PM 2.5 and O 3 particulate matters. Some of the other parameters like humidity, temperature, PM 10 , NO 2 etc. also have an impact to this disease. We only research a significant component that influences ILI. On the infrastructure side, we choose the best performance ways for the data operation. First, we use Indexing for the relational database. Second, data transfer between MySQL to HDFS, we optimize the Sqoop tool with generating multi-file and with direction parameters. Third, for C.-T. Yang et al. Computers in Human Behavior 100 (2019) 266-274 data processing, Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS) as a temporary data storage and through Alluxio in-Memory environment feeds data to Spark is faster than using HDFS only. For the performance comparison, we can conclude the speed performance averagely grows to 40% than the previous condition.",

ILI was detected at least once in 219 (23.7%) of 945 household members. 271 (62.3%) of 435 nose/throat swabs were positive for at least one of the 15 viruses tested. Six viruses predominated amongst positive swabs: Rhinovirus (28%), Influenza virus (17%), Coronavirus (8%), Enterovirus (5%), Respiratory syncytial virus (3%), Metapneumovirus virus (2.5%) and Parainfluenza virus 3 (1.8%).
