It is unknown, however, whether this loss is caused by functional downregulation of transgene expression or death of transduced cells. Herein, we demonstrate that during the elimination of transgene expression, the brain becomes infiltrated with CD4 + and CD8 + T cells and that these T cells are necessary for transgene elimination. Further, the loss of transgene-expressing brain cells fails to occur in the absence of IFN , perforin, and TNF receptor. Two methods to induce severe immune suppression in immunized animals also fail to restitute transgene expression, demonstrating the irreversibility of this process. The need for cytotoxic molecules and the irreversibility of the reduction in transgene expression suggested to us that elimination of transduced cells is responsible for the loss of transgene expression. A new experimental paradigm that discriminates between downregulation of transgene expression and the elimination of transduced cells demonstrates that transduced cells are lost from the brain upon the induction of a specific antiviral immune response. We conclude that the anti-adenoviral immune response reduces transgene expression in the brain through loss of transduced cells.",

            "text": "Especially, whether the immune response blocks transgene expression or actually kills transduced cells needs to be determined, as only functional inhibition of transgene expression would be transient and reversible. Immune-mediated killing of infected brain cells would represent an unacceptable consequence and potentially limit clinical gene therapy. [13] [14] [15] Recently, we demonstrated that upon the systemic immunization against adenovirus, antiviral CD8 + T cells form close anatomical appositions, i.e., immunological synapses, with target adenovirally transduced astrocytes. 16, 17 During this process, transgene expression is lost from ~50% of infected cells, 85% of which are reactive astrocytes. 18 Additionally, T-cell activation leads to the production and secretion of IFN\u03b3, perforin, and TNF\u03b1. [19] [20] [21] Much research has also been done on the mechanisms by which the immune system clears infection from the brains of animals infected with Lymphocytic Choriomeningitis Virus (LCMV), 22 Sindbis Virus, 23 measles virus, West Nile virus, 24 Borna virus, 25 Murine Cytomegalovirus, 26 Theiler's Virus, Semliki Forest virus, mouse hepatitis virus (MHV), 27 or herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV1). 28 Cytotoxic T cells, especially CD8 + T cells, IFN\u03b3, perforin, and TNF\u03b1 have all been shown to be necessary to various degrees to clear or control viral infections in the brain. However, bona fide killing of infected brain cells has only ever been demonstrated using in vitro paradigms, but never in vivo. 29 It is thought that clearing of virus from the brain occurs without physical damage to the structure of the CNS. 30 We now describe results using a novel reporter system to discriminate whether immune responses to adenoviral vectors are functional and reversible or cytotoxic. ROSA26 transgenic mice that encode within the ROSA locus a STOP sequence flanked with loxP sites upstream of the transcriptional start site of the lacZ gene. In this mouse strain, genomic \u03b2-galactosidase is only expressed after Cre-mediated excision of loxP-flanked STOP sequence. 31 We used an adenoviral vector-expressing Cre recombinase to infect the brains of ROSA26 mice. 32 Upon systemic immunization, functional downregulation of Ad-mediated transgene expression should result in loss of Cre expression, without loss of genomic \u03b2-galactosidase expression; loss of both Cre-expressed from the adenoviral vector-and \u03b2-galactosidase-expressed from the genome of infected cells-would be the result of killing of Ad-infected brain cells. 30 Previous studies have shown that adeno-associated virus (AAV) and lentiviral vector-mediated expression of Cre in neurons of ROSA26 transgenic mice induce long-term expression of \u03b2-galactosidase from the recombined ROSA26 locus, 33 thereby supporting the feasibility of our reporter system. In the liver, Wang et al. 34 have used AAV-Cre to demonstrate that instability of newly formed AAV dsDNA is responsible for low rAAV transduction efficacy. These authors observed that upon administration of AAV-expressing Cre recombinase to ROSA26 transgenic mice, liver expression of recombined lacZ remains high and stable, while expression of AAV-encoded alkaline phosphatase is modest; although dsAAV are formed in most infected cells, they are rapidly lost. The instability of a large proportion of AAV dsDNA precludes their use in our paradigm which requires continued, comparable, stable, and long-term expression of genomic recombined lacZ and transgenes encoded by episomally-located Ad vectors' genomes.",

Naive C57Bl/6 mice were injected in the right brain striatum with first-generation adenoviral vectors encoding herpes simplex type 1 thymidine kinase (Ad-TK) as a marker transgene. Thirty days later, animals were immunized systemically with a first-generation adenoviral vector encoding an unrelated transgene (Ad-HPRT) (Figure 1a) . Expression of TK is reduced following immunization, remaining at very low levels for up to 120 days after immunization (Figure 1b) . Figure 1b (%) and Figure 1c (total numbers) indicate that CD4 + T cells infiltrate the brain as early as 7 days post immunization and remain in the brain at significant levels up to 120 days after immunization. CD45 + cells, a marker representing all bone marrow-derived cells, infiltrate the mouse brain as early as 14 days post immunization, with peak levels obtained at 60 days after immunization and remain in the brain at significant levels up to 90 days post-immunization; at early time points, when CD4 + cell counts are high, the comparable numbers of CD45 + cell numbers obtained are most likely reflecting the influx of T cells; however, from 30 days onwards, as T-cell numbers decrease, CD45 + cells most likely indicate the presence of macrophages/microglia in the brain; to avoid any confusion in later experiments to detect intercellular interactions, we used the antibody F4/80 to label only macrophages/microglia.

Following irradiation, TK expression did not increase (Figure 5a ). (Figure 5b ) or flow cytometry analysis of CD4 + T cells and CD8 + T cells in the spleens (Figure 5c -d) confirms that irradiation dramatically reduces the levels of immune cells. Irradiation also caused a sharp reduction in the frequency of adenovirus-specific IFN\u03b3secreting T lymphocyte precursors in the mouse spleen (Figure 5e ). The decrease in T-cell function was less following treatment with rapamycin, but TK expression did not recover back to control levels (Figure 6a-c) .

Cre recombinase expression (provided in trans by Ad-CAG-Cre) excises the STOP sequence, thus allowing constitutive and permanent \u03b2-galactosidase expression from the genome of transduced cells, while expression of Cre recombinase can be used to monitor transgene expression from the viral vector (Figure 7a) . Upon immunization, changes in the expression of Cre recombinase (vector genome) will indicate changes in the expression from the viral vector; changes in the expression of \u03b2-galactosidase (ROSA26 genome) will indicate changes in the number of transduced cells.",

            "text": "The elucidation of the cellular and molecular mechanisms by which the immune response clears viral gene expression from the brain is crucial to the safety and efficacy of clinical trials in neurological gene therapy. If host defense mechanisms simply abolish transgene expression, the effectiveness of gene therapy will be reduced. However, if the immune response both suppresses transgene expression and eliminates transduced brain cells, the symptomatology of patients suffering from chronic neurodegenerative disorders that involve neuronal loss would worsen. Elucidating how the immune system regulates transgene expression in the CNS is therefore of central importance to clinical neurological gene therapy, 1, 13, 15, 30, 35, 36 especially in view of the continuing use of first-generation adenoviral vectors for the treatment of brain diseases, specifically brain tumors. [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] 11, 12, 37 Utilizing a well established mouse model of brain immune responses to adenoviruses, we demonstrate that T cells mediate elimination of transgene expression from the brain through what both cytotoxic and noncytotoxic mechanisms. 2,3,16-18 Kinetics of infiltration of immune cells into the brain produced a number of interesting and unexpected observations. The first cells to infiltrate the brain were CD4 + cells, which peaked at 7 days after immunization, remained high for the first month, and then slowly decreased to basal levels during more than 4 months. To our surprise, CD8 + cells entered the brain much later, with very low levels of CD8 + T cells found in the brain at 30 days after immunization, peaking only much later, at 2-3 months after immunization, and then returning to basal levels by 4 months. Macrophages/monocytes increased more slowly than CD4 + T cells and achieved a clear peak in the CNS at 2 months after immunization. This indicates that at the peak of the reduction seen in transduced cells, i.e., at 30 days after immunization, CD4 + T cells are the most abundant in the brain, followed by macrophages, and CD8 + T cells, a distant third. If numbers of T cells in the brain were to determine function, then CD4 + T cells would be the ones mostly responsible for the decrease of transduced cells. However, when we carefully examined the capacity of T cells to establish morphological contacts with transduced target cells in the brain, we found that both CD4 + and CD8 + T cells did indeed establish contacts with transduced cells, but that, overall, these contacts were very few. Specifically, less than 10% of all target cells are contacted by either CD4 + or CD8 + T cells at the peak of reduction in the number of transgene expression, though up to 75% of transduced cells are contacted by macrophages. Thus, in spite of the known importance of immunological synapses and their role in mediating communication between effector T cells Elimination of Ad-mediated transgene expression upon immunization is not reversed by rapamycin. C57BL/6 mice were injected with Ad-TK in the brain and 30 days later, immunized i.p. with either Ad-HPRT or saline as control. 30 days after immunization, mice were immunosuppressed by treatment with rapamycin. Mice were euthanized 5 days post immunosupression for further analysis. (a) Stereological quantification of TK immunoreactive cells in the mouse brain following rapamycin treatment. *P < 0.05 compared to nonimmunized mice, one-way ANOVA followed by Tukey's test.

Our experiments demonstrate that CD4 + and CD8 + T cells are necessary for transgene elimination and that their effects are mediated, at least in part, by IFN\u03b3, perforin, and TNF\u03b1. Our data demonstrating that the immune system can eliminate adenovirally transduced brain cells indicates that this phenomenon will have to be carefully studied and monitored during future clinical trial using adenoviral vectors, or potentially other viral vectors.",

The construction of Ad-TK (expressing HSV1-TK), Ad-\u03b2-gal (expressing \u03b2-galactosidase), and Ad-HPRT (expressing hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyl-transferase) has been described in detail elsewhere. [42] [43] [44] In both vectors, the transgenes are under the major immediate early human cytomegalovirus promoter (hCMV). All viruses tested negative for the presence of replication competent adenoviral vectors (RCA) and lipopolisacharide (LPS) as described before. 45 Ad-CAG-Cre (Ad-Cre) previously described was a generous gift from Dr Saito. . Mice were anesthetized using ketamine (75 mg/kg) and medetomidine (0.5 mg/kg) and placed in a stereotactic apparatus modified for mice. Animals were injected into the right striatum (stereotactic coordinates: 0.05 mm anterior, 0.22 mm lateral from bregma and 0.32 mm ventral from the brain's surface) with 1 \u00d7 10 7 infectious units of adenoviral vector within 0.5 \u03bcl of volume, using a 5 \u03bcl Hamilton syringe. Each injection was performed over a period of 3 minutes, with the needle being left in place for an additional 5 minutes before withdrawal. Thirty days after viral vector injection into the brain, animals were immunized systemically (i.p. injection) with 3.28 \u00d7 10 8 infectious units (iu) of Ad-HPRT in 100 \u03bcl of saline solution. At experimental endpoints, mice were anesthetized via i.p. injection of an overdose of ketamine (50 mg/ kg) and xylazine (50 mg/kg) and transcardially perfused with oxygenated Tyrode's solution alone (for brains to be used for molecular studies) or perfused-fixed with oxygenated Tyrode's solution followed by 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate buffered saline (PBS). Brain tissue was removed and postfixed for 48 hours before immunohistochemistry and further analysis. Unless indicated, experiments were performed on groups of 3-5 animals per group.",

Downregulation of Ad-mediated transgene expression should result in loss of Crerecombinase expression without loss of genomic -galactosidase expression, whereas loss of both Cre-recombinase and -galactosidase expression would be the result of loss of Ad-infected brain cells.

Quantification and stereological analysis. The optical fractionator protocol used for unbiased stereological cell estimation in the striatum of mice injected with Ad-TK was as described earlier. Striatum and external capsule were defined according to the Mouse Brain Atlas. 48 Quantification of DAB or fluorescent-labeled cells in the striatum was performed by the examination of five coronal sections in series from each animal. Analysis was done by stereological methods using a computer-assisted image analysis system (Stereoinvestigator software version 5.0, Microbrightfield, Vermont) with a Zeiss Axioplan 2 microscope controlled by a Ludl electronic MAC 5000 XY stage control (Ludl Electronics Products, Hawthorne, NY) and Axioplan Z-axis control (Carl Zeiss, Thornwood, NY) connected to a digital camera. The region of interest was traced using the 1.25\u00d7 objective. The number of cells was measured in 200 \u00d7 200 \u03bcm fields that covered the surface of the analyzed region. Labeled cells were counted using the 20\u00d7 objective with 55 counting frames throughout the delineated area of the striatum in each section via the Optical Fractionator. The thickness of each counting frame was 50 \u03bcm and positive cells were counted only when found to be in the limit of the square. Data were expressed as an absolute number of positive cells in each anatomical region analyzed, as described previously.",
