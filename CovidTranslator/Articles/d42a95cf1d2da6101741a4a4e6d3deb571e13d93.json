The critical feature of this model is that the community is modelled as a small-world network of interconnected nodes. Each node is linked to a fixed number of immediate neighbors and a random number of geographically remote nodes. Transmission can only propagate between linked nodes. This model exhibits two features typical of SARS transmission: geographically localized outbreaks and ''superspreaders''. Neither of these features are evident in standard susceptible-infected-removed models of disease transmission. Our analysis indicates that ''super-spreaders'' may occur even if the infectiousness of all infected individuals is constant. Moreover, we find that nosocomial transmission in Hong Kong directly contributed to the severity of the outbreak and that by limiting individual exposure time to 3-5 days the extent of the SARS epidemic would have been minimal. r",

Two notable SSE were observed early in the epidemic and have been widely reported: at the Amoy Gardens housing estate and at the Prince of Wales hospital. Epidemiological studies [3, 4] have found that in Hong Kong: the fatality rate was approximately 17% (compared to 11% globally); the mean incubation period was 6.4 days (range 2-10) [5] ; the duration between onset of symptoms and hospitalization was 3-5 days; and the mean number of individuals infected by each case during the initial phase of the epidemic was 2.7 [2] . Like any epidemic, an initial exponential outbreak is evident in the SARS infection data for Hong Kong [5] , but this initial explosion was soon tempered. In this paper, we present an alternative These are the ''revised'' data in the lower panel. As we are unsure of the revision process use, and we believe it to include strong assumptions about the etiological agent involved, we analyze only the reported data in this paper. explanation for the occurrence of SSE. We show that SSE may occur, as a result of social structure, even if the etiological agent is equally infectious in all patients.",

As is usual, the class S represents individuals that are susceptible to the infectious agent, but are not yet infected. Category R represents individuals that are permanently incapable of either transmitting or acquiring the disease: typically, this represents those that have recovered from the infection (and are assumed to be immune), those that have died, and those that are either isolated or quarantined. The I class represents individuals that are infected and infectious, whereas P represents those that are infected but not yet infectious (similar to E in the standard formulation).",

The population of N nodes are arranged in a regular grid, of side length L (L 2 \u00bc N) and each node is connected directly to n 1 immediate neighbors. 1 An infected individual will infect each of its n 1 neighbors (provided they are still susceptible) with probability p 1 : Furthermore, each node has n 2 long distance links (see Fig. 2 ). These are links to nodes that are geographically remote from one another, infection occurs along these pathways with probability p 2 : For each node i the number n \u00f0i\u00de 2 is fixed and so are the links to its n \u00f0i\u00de 2 remote neighbors.

It is the inclusion of long distance links with a random number of links that gives rise to the network's SW structure. Moreover, the same long distance links can also cause the network to exhibit scale free (SF) properties. By SF we mean that logarithm of the probability of a node having n links is inversely proportional to log n (very large number of links occur relatively frequently). Whether the induced network of actual infections follows a SF distribution remains to be tested [7] and is not the focus of this paper.",

Therefore, the sum n 1 \u00fe n 2 is a lower bound on the number of active acquaintances. The reason n 1 \u00fe n 2 is only a lower bound, is that n 1 \u00fe n 2 is the number of links that are sufficiently intimate to support transmission of the virus. In reality, some links would be closer than others and would be far more likely to lead to transmission. We make the simplification that transmission will occur with probability p 1 on all the n 1 -links and probability p 2 along all the n 2 -links. Informally, p 1 is the probability of transmission between members of the same household in a 24 h period, p 2 is the probability of transmission between acquaintances over one day. These two probabilities are not necessarily the same. Therefore n 2 may be defined as the number of individuals with this transmission probability. Experimental evidence suggests that any two individuals in continental North America (in 1967) are connected by (on average) no more than six links [12] . Ignoring mutual acquaintance, and assuming a population of 200 000 000 one can deduce that each individual has approximately log\u00f02 \u00c2 10 8 \u00de= log 6 % 10:667 unique acquaintances. The problem of mutual acquaintances complicates things slightly, but this will not have an significant effect on the result. Moreover, if we set n 1 \u00bc 4 (the horizontal and vertical neighbors only) then the probability of two nodes having mutual acquaintances is only n 2 \u00bc N: Hence, in our simulations, we take n 1 \u00bc 4 and E\u00f0n 2 \u00de \u00bc m \u00bc 7: Note that the choice of n 1 and n 2 is not critical, what is more important is the infection probability p 1 n 1 \u00fe p 2 n 2 : 4 In fact, the variation in control (such as quarantining of suspected infected individuals) can be equally modelled as a reduction in n 1 and n 2 : In this model we aim to keep the parameter changes as simple as possible and achieve the same result by changing only p 2 :",

However, by imposing a SW-SF structure on the system we simulated the effect of propagation by acquaintance: one can only become infected after contact with an infected individual [13, 14] . Furthermore, the explicit modelling of associations allows more effective simulation of control measures such as quarantining (or school closure). Finally, localized outbreaks (SSE) can be more realistically modelled with the inhomogeneous SW-SF model structure. The implication of this is that the SSE do not necessarily require highly contagious individuals, only a highly connected individual, and, highly connected individuals occur naturally in any community. In other words, high rates of infection for certain individuals are not necessarily related to the action of the disease, only to their degree of social connectedness. Therefore we conclude that a highly variable infection rate is not necessarily a significant factor in the transmission of SARS.",
