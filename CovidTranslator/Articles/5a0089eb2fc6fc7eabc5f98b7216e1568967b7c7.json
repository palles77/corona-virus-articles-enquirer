Generally, it is preferable to wait to initiate chemoprophylaxis until laboratory confirmation has been received. c. The prophylactic doses are oseltamivir 75 mg PO once daily or zanamivir two inhalations once daily for adults. d. Prophylaxis should be continued for 14 days minimum or until the outbreak has been declared over (see section D above). ii. Staff: a. In the context of significant antigenic drift and/or vaccine mismatch for which suboptimal VE may reasonably be anticipated, and in particular in relation to H3N2 viruses this season, it is recommended that staff who provide resident care or conduct activities where they may have the potential to acquire or transmit influenza (21) should also take prophylactic antiviral medication during the outbreak, regardless of whether they have received the current season's influenza vaccine. This is because, despite some vaccine protection anticipated, a substantial proportion of vaccinated individuals, including healthy working-age adults, are anticipated to remain susceptible to drifted H3N2 viruses. b. Antiviral prophylaxis recommendations should be reinstituted whenever an outbreak is declared even for the same subtype and within the same setting and season. The maximum duration of continuous prophylaxis should be eight weeks, but outbreaks managed with antivirals should generally be terminated well within this period. In the unusual event that the outbreak is more prolonged, control measures should be reassessed in consultation with the local Medical Officer of Health and other experts. c.

This would include a review of hand hygiene and infection control precautions, along with refresher training, as required. The use of antivirals should be stated in the RCF's influenza outbreak management policy.

Outbreaks of influenza are not uncommon in RCFs. To protect the health of staff and residents and to ensure the RCF is well prepared to manage an outbreak of influenza, it is important to consider the following actions: \u2022 Plan for a possible outbreak: 200 a. Develop easily accessible internal policies and procedures on infection control and an outbreak management plan. A copy of these guidelines and the Influ-Info Kit produced by the Department of Social Services should be used as references.27 b. Include a medical practitioner (or equivalent) in the development of the outbreak management plan; this is essential for consideration of use of antiviral medications. c. Acquire adequate stocks of materials such as personal protective equipment (PPE) and cleaning materials (refer to Appendices 1 and 2). Consider having an outbreak kit / box specifically for use in an outbreak. d. Ensure RCF staff know the symptoms and signs of influenza, and are trained in infection control procedures for use of PPE (Appendix 1). e. Policies supporting use of antiviral drugs for prophylaxis should reflect the reduced effectiveness of antivirals with either delays in implementation or low levels of compliance, and a response option for poor compliance. f. If there is an intention to use influenza antivirals for prophylaxis in the management of outbreaks, RCFs may develop processes with attending GPs for antiviral prescriptions/ standing orders prior to the influenza season (see 6.2.9), as to be effective antiviral medication must be used in a widespread fashion at the same time. g. For residents with renal failure, GP assessment of the renal function is needed before or soon after prophylaxis commences (Appendix 16). Note. Legislation relating to the use of standing drug orders may differ between jurisdictions. \u2022 Develop a systematic method for detecting and recording residents in the facility who develop symptoms of ILI, such as fever or cough. An ILI detection system may include increased frequency of temperature observation during winter and methods to alert the responsible clinician of symptomatic residents. \u2022 Maintain a functional system for the timely detection of potential influenza outbreaks (3 residents/staff with ILI within 3 days) in the RCF. This may be a daily summary of all ILI records. Ensure daily hand-over time for ILI monitoring and outbreak detection for those assigned to this important task. \u2022 Early in the year, plan to ensure at least 95% of staff and residents are vaccinated (refer to Section 3: Vaccination). Encourage staff, family members and regular visitors such as hairdressers etc., volunteers, allied health and support workers to be vaccinated. This helps keep them healthy and reduces the likelihood of influenza being brought into the facility. \u2022 Keep vaccination records for staff and residents up-to-date, and ensure they are easily accessible when needed for an outbreak response.",

Recommendation: Antimicrobial treatment has to be empirical and should follow an approach according to the individual risk of mortality. The assessment of severity according to mild, moderate and severe pneumonia implies a decision about the most appropriate treatment setting (ambulatory, hospital ward or ICU)[A4]. Antimicrobial treatment should be initiated as soon as possible [A3]. Which additional therapies are recommended? Recommendation: All patients should be subject to early mobilization [A3]. Low molecular heparin should be given in patients with acute respiratory failure [A3]. The use of non-invasive ventilation is not yet standard care but can be considered, particularly in patients with COPD [B3] and ARDS [A3]. The treatment of severe sepsis and septic shock is confined to supportive measures [A3]. Steroids are not recommended in the treatment of pneumonia [A3]. Early mobilization has been shown to be associated with better outcome. For the purpose of the study, early mobilization was defined as movement out of bed with change from horizontal to upright position for at least 20 min during the first 24 h of hospitalization, with progressive movement each subsequent day during hospitalization [430]. Do antiviral substances prevent influenza virus infection? Recommendation: Prevention of influenza by antiviral substances should only be considered in special situations (for example in outbreaks in closed communities during influenza seasons) [A1]",

Routine Practices (as per Part B, Section III) and Contact Precautions should be followed for all health care settings (as per Part B, Section IV) sub-section i) and modified as noted below: For Long Term Care a. Patient Placement, Accommodation and Activities \u2212 Perform a point of care risk assessment to determine patient placement, removal from a shared room or participation in group activities on a case-by case basis, balancing infection risks to other patients in the room, the presence of risk factors that increase the likelihood of transmission, and the potential adverse psychological impact on the infected patient. \u2212 Participation in group activities should be restricted only when wound drainage or diarrhea cannot be contained. \u2212 Ensure patient performs hand hygiene or is assisted as necessary before participation with group activities. b. Use of Personal Protective Equipment \u2212 Wear gloves if direct personal care contact with the patient is required or if direct contact with frequently touched environmental surfaces is anticipated. \u2212 Wear gowns for direct hands-on care. c. Cleaning of Patient Environment \u2212 In outbreaks, consider more frequent cleaning and cleaning with disinfectants. This includes bathing and toileting facilities, recreational equipment and horizontal surfaces in the patient room, and in particular, areas and items that are frequently touched (e.g., hand and bedrails, and light cords).Modifications of Droplet Precautions in Long Term Care a. In long term care and other patient settings, perform a point of care risk assessment to determine patient placement, considering infection risks to other patient(s) in the room and available alternatives. b. If a two-metre spatial separation is not possible, manage the patient in their bed space, with privacy curtains drawn. c. Participation in group activities may need to be restricted while the patient is symptomatic. d. During an outbreak in a facility, restrict social activities to units and areas. e. Restrictions in the number of visitors may be advisable during community or facility outbreaks of respiratory infections.Modifications of Airborne Precautions for Long Term Care a. Tuberculosis (infectious, respiratory (pleural or laryngeal)) i) Determine the tuberculosis infection status of patients in LTC facilities at the time of admission. ii) If an airborne infection isolation room is not available in the long term care setting, arrange for transfer to a facility with airborne infection isolation rooms. When transfer is delayed, reduce the risk of transmission of tuberculosis by the following: \u2022 Place the patient in a single room with the door closed, preferably without recirculation of air from the room and as far away from rooms of other patients as possible. gown when entering the room of a patient suspected or proven to have RSV, parainfluenza virus, or adenovirus infection, and when soiling with respiratory secretions from a patient is anticipated (e.g., when handling infants with suspected or proven RSV, parainfluenza, or adenovirus infection). Change the gown after touch contact and before giving care to another patient or when leaving the patient's room. After gown removal, ensure that clothing does not come into contact with potentially contaminated Wear a surgical mask and eye protection or a face shield when performing procedures or patient-care activities that might generate sprays of respiratory secretions from any patient whether or not the patient has confirmed or suspected viral respiratory tract infection (279).CATEGORY IB (2) Wear a surgical mask and eye protection or a face shield when within 3 feet of a patient with suspected or confirmed adenovirus infection (279). CATEGORY IB e. Patient placement in acute-care facilities (1) Place a patient with diagnosed RSV, parainfluenza, adenovirus, or other viral respiratory tract infection in a private room when possible or in a room with other patients with the same infection and no other infection (279;749;810;813;815;819). CATEGORY IB (2) Place a patient with suspected RSV, parainfluenza, adenovirus, or other viral respiratory tract infection in a private room. CATEGORY II (a) Promptly perform rapid diagnostic laboratory tests on patients who are admitted with or who have symptoms of RSV infection after admission to the health-care facility to facilitate early downgrading of infection-control precautions to the minimum required for each patient's specific viral infection (817;819). CATEGORY IB (b) Promptly perform rapid diagnostic laboratory tests on patients who are admitted with or who have symptoms of parainfluenza or adenovirus infection after admission to the health-care facility to facilitate early downgrading of infection-control precautions to the minimum required for each patient's specific viral infection and early initiation of treatment when indicated. CATEGORY II f. Limiting patient movement or transport in acute-care facilities (1) Limit to essential purposes only the movement or transport of patients from their rooms when they are diagnosed or suspected to be infected with RSV, parainfluenza virus, or adenovirus (279). CATEGORY IB (2) If transport or movement from the room is necessary (a) For a patient with diagnosed or suspected RSV or parainfluenza virus infection, ensure that precautions are maintained to minimize the risk for transmission of the virus to other patients and contamination of environmental surfaces or equipment by ensuring that the patient does not touch other persons' hands or environmental surfaces with hands that have been contaminated with his/her respiratory secretions (279). CATEGORY IB (b) For a patient with diagnosed or suspected adenovirus infection, minimize patient dispersal of droplets by having the patient wear a surgical mask, and ensure that contact precautions are maintained to minimize the risk of transmission of the virus to other patients and contamination of environmental surfaces or equipment (279). CATEGORY IB 2. Other measures in acute-care facilities a. Staffing (1) Restrict health-care personnel in the acute stages of an upper respiratory tract infection from caring for infants and other patients at high risk for complications from viral respiratory tract infections (e.g., children with severe underlying cardiopulmonary conditions, children receiving chemotherapy for malignancy, premature infants, and patients who are otherwise immunocompromised) (279;507;813;815;817). CATEGORY II (2) When feasible, perform rapid diagnostic testing on healthcare personnel with symptoms of respiratory tract infection, especially those who provide care to patients at high-risk for acquiring and/or developing severe complications from RSV, parainfluenza, or adenovirus infection, so that their work status can be determined promptly. CATEGORY II b. Limiting visitors Do not allow persons who have symptoms of respiratory infection to visit pediatric, immunocompromised, or cardiac patients (279;507;810;817;819).CATEGORY IB c. Use of monoclonal antibody (palivizumab) for attenuation of RSV infection Follow the recommendations of the American Academy of Pediatrics to consider monthly administration of palivizumab, an RSV monoclonal-antibody preparation, to the following infants and children aged <24 months: 1) those born prematurely at <32 weeks of gestational age and have bronchopulmonary dysplasia, and those born prematurely at <32 weeks gestation without chronic lung disease who will be aged <6 months at the beginning of the RSV season, and (2) those born at 32-35 weeks gestation, if two or more of the following risk factors are present: child-care attendance, school-aged siblings, exposure to environmental pollutants, congenital abnormalities of the airways, or severe neuromuscular disease (820;822-824). CATEGORY II 3. Control of outbreaks in acute-care facilities a. Perform rapid screening diagnostic tests for the particular virus(es) known or suspected to be causing the outbreak on patients who are admitted with symptoms of viral respiratory illness. Promptly cohort the patients (according to their specific infections) as soon as the results of the screening tests are available (749;764;810;813;815;817;819). In the interim, when possible, admit patients with symptoms of viral respiratory infections to private rooms CATEGORY IB b. Personnel cohorting (1) During an outbreak of health-care-associated RSV infection, cohort personnel as much as practical (e.g., restrict personnel who give care to infected patients from giving care to uninfected patients) (810;813;815). CATEGORY II(2)No recommendation can be made for routinely cohorting personnel during an outbreak of health-care-associated adenovirus or parainfluenza virus infection. UNRESOLVED ISSUE c. Use of RSV immune globulin or monoclonal antibody No recommendation can be made for the use of RSV immune globulin or monoclonal antibody to control outbreaks of RSV infection in the health-care setting (820-825;827-829). UNRESOLVED ISSUE. PREVENTION AND CONTROL OF HEALTH-CARE-ASSOCIATED INFLUENZA I. Staff Education Provide health-care personnel continuing education or access to continuing education about the epidemiology, modes of transmission, diagnosis, and means of preventing the spread of influenza, in accordance with their level of responsibility in preventing healthcare-associated influenza (1029;1044-1046).CATEGORY II II. Surveillance A. Establish mechanisms by which facility personnel are promptly alerted about increased influenza activity in the community. CATEGORY II B. Establish protocols for intensifying efforts to promptly diagnose cases of facility-acquired influenza. 1. Determine the threshold incidence or prevalence of influenza or influenza-like illness in the facility at which laboratory testing of patients with influenza-like illness is to be undertaken and outbreak control measures are to be initiated (942). CATEGORY II 2. Arrange for laboratory tests to be available to clinicians for prompt diagnosis of influenza, especially during November-April (936-939). CATEGORY II III. Modifying Host Risk For Infection B. Use of Antiviral Agents (See Section V-C)8. The ICP should communicate with relevant facility committees and personnel within the facility, ICPs from transferring facilities, and public health authorities to ensure appropriate isolation and collection of surveillance information (Category II). 9. No recommendation on number of ICPs per 100 LTCF beds.D. Surveillance 1. The LTCF should have a system for ongoing collection of data on infections in the institution (Category IC). 2. A documented surveillance procedure should be used, including written definitions of infections (Category IB). Comment: Concurrent surveillance is preferable to retrospective surveillance. The frequency of surveillance for HAIs in the LTCF should be based on factors such as acuity level of the resident population. Surveillance at least once a week generally is needed to collect timely data. Surveillance data should be collected from communication with staff; this may be during walking rounds in the LTCF. Medical progress notes in the chart, laboratory or radiology reports, nursing notes, treatment records, medication records, physical assessments, environmental observations, and follow-up information from transfers to acute care hospitals provide clues to the presence of infections. 3. The ICP should review surveillance data frequently and recommend infection control measures, as appropriate, in response to identified problems (Category IB). Comment: Analysis of surveillance data should include at least the following elements on each infection to detect clusters and trends: resident identifier, type of infection, date of onset, location in the facility, and appropriate laboratory information. 4. Infection rates should be calculated periodically, recorded, analyzed, and reported to the administration and the infection control oversight committee (Category IB). Comment: Infection rates usually are calculated monthly, quarterly, and annually. HAI rates are calculated preferably as infections per 1000 resident-days. A standard infection report form facilitates reporting of surveillance information. Tables, graphs, and charts may be used and facilitate education of personnel. 5. Surveillance data should be used for planning infection control efforts, detecting epidemics, directing continuing education, and identifying individual resident problems for intervention (Category IB). Comment: In addition to collection of baseline infection rates, the ICP should perform problem-focused studies. Examples of special studies are evaluation of UTIs in catheterized residents, a study of the occurrence of influenza in vaccinated versus unvaccinated residents, or the prevalence of pressure ulcers in bed-bound residents. 6. In addition to the above outcome measures, surveillance should also include analysis of process measures relevant to infection control (Category II). Comment: Examples include monitoring hand hygiene compliance, observation of aseptic technique, and measuring HCW influenza vaccination rates. E. Outbreak Control 1. Surveillance data should be used to detect and prevent outbreaks in the LTCF (Category IB/IC). Comment: The occurrence of even a single verified case of a highly transmissible disease (such as infectious TB, influenza, scabies,\u2022 Symptomatic healthcare providers who care for patients who are at high risk of developing complications from influenza, particularly those who are severely immunocompromised (C-III).Patients Who Are Recommended to Receive Antiviral Treatment for Suspected or Confirmed Influenza, Which Antiviral Should Be Prescribed, at What Dosing, and for What Duration? Recommendations 20. Clinicians should start antiviral treatment as soon as possible with a single neuraminidase inhibitor (NAI) (either oral oseltamivir, inhaled zanamivir, or intravenous peramivir) and not use a combination of NAIs (A-1). 21. Clinicians should not routinely use higher doses of US Food and Drug Administration-approved NAI drugs for the treatment of seasonal influenza (A-II). 22. Clinicians should treat uncomplicated influenza in otherwise healthy ambulatory patients for 5 days with oral oseltamivir or inhaled zanamivir, or a single dose of intravenous peramivir (A-1). 23. Clinicians can consider longer duration of antiviral treatment for patients with a documented or suspected immunocompromising condition or patients requiring hospitalization for severe lower respiratory tract disease (especially pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome [ARDS]), as influenza viral replication is often protracted (C-III).INSTITUTIONAL OUTBREAK CONTROLWhen Is There Sufficient Evidence of an Influenza Outbreak in a Longterm Care Facility or Hospital to Trigger Implementation of Control Measures Among Exposed Residents or Patients and Healthcare Personnel to Prevent Additional Cases of Influenza?

CATEGORY II 2. In acute-care facilities, establish mechanisms by which the infection-control staff can monitor personnel compliance with the facility's infection-control policies about these viruses (817). CATEGORY II B. Surveillance 1. Establish mechanisms by which the appropriate health-care personnel are promptly alerted to any increase in the activity of RSV, parainfluenza virus, adenovirus, or other respiratory viruses in the local community. Establish mechanisms by which the appropriate 220 health-care personnel can promptly inform the local and state health departments of any increase in the activity of the above-named viruses or of influenza-like illness in their facility. CATEGORY IB 2. In acute-care facilities during periods of increased prevalence of symptoms of viral respiratory illness in the community or healthcare facility, and/or during the RSV and influenza season (i.e., December-March), attempt prompt diagnosis of respiratory infections caused by RSV, influenza, parainfluenza, or other respiratory viruses. Use rapid diagnostic techniques as clinically indicated in patients who are admitted to the health-care facility with respiratory illness and are at high risk for serious complications from viral respiratory infections (e.g., pediatric patients, especially infants, and those with compromised cardiac, pulmonary, or immune function) (749;764;815;817;897). CATEGORY IA 3. No recommendation can be made for routinely conducting surveillance cultures for RSV or other respiratory viruses in respiratory secretions of patients (including immunocompromised patients, such as recipients of HSCT) (507). UNRESOLVED ISSUE 4. In LTCFs, establish mechanism(s) for continuing surveillance to allow rapid identification of a potential outbreak in the facility. CATEGORY II II. Prevention Of Transmission Of RSV, Parainfluenza Virus, Or Adenovirus A. Prevention of Person-to-Person Transmission 1. Standard and contact precautions for RSV and parainfluenza virus; and standard, contact, and droplet precautions for adenovirus a. Hand hygiene Decontaminate hands after contact with a patient or after touching respiratory secretions or fomites potentially contaminated with respiratory secretions, whether or not gloves are worn. Use soap and water when hands are visibly dirty or contaminated with proteinaceous material or are visibly soiled with blood or other body fluids, and use an alcohol-based hand rub if hands are not visibly soiled (271;279;284;782;802-804;813;817).

Droplet Precautions 1. Place a patient who is diagnosed to have influenza in a private room or in a room with other patients with confirmed influenza, unless there are medical contraindications to doing so (279). CATEGORY IB 2 Place a patient suspected to have influenza in a private room and promptly perform rapid diagnostic laboratory tests to facilitate early downgrading of infection-control precautions to the minimum required for the patient's infection (279). CATEGORY II 3. Wear a surgical mask upon entering the patient's room or when working within 3 feet of the patient (279). CATEGORY IB 4. Limit the movement and transport of the patient from the room to those for essential purposes only. If patient movement or transport is necessary, have the patient wear a surgical mask, if possible, to minimize droplet dispersal by the patient (279). CATEGORY II B. Eye Protection No recommendation can be made for wearing eye-protective device upon entering the room of a patient with confirmed or suspected influenza or when working within 3 feet of the patient. UNRESOLVED ISSUE C. Contact Precautions No recommendation can be made for observance of contact precautions (in addition to droplet precautions) for patients with confirmed or suspected influenza (279;921). UNRESOLVED ISSUE D. Standard Precautions 1. Decontaminate hands before and after giving care to and/or touching a patient or after touching a patient's respiratory secretions, whether or not gloves are worn: if hands are visibly dirty or contaminated with proteinaceous material or are visibly soiled with blood or body fluids, wash them with either a nonantimicrobial soap and water or an antimicrobial soap and water; and if hands are not visibly soiled, use an alcohol-based hand rub for their decontamination (278). CATEGORY IA 2. Wear gloves if hand contact with patient's respiratory secretions is expected(279;921). CATEGORY II 3. Wear a gown if soiling of clothes with patient's respiratory secretions is expected (279). CATEGORY II E. Air Handling No recommendation can be made for maintaining negative air pressure in rooms of patients in whom influenza is suspected or 225 diagnosed, or in placing together persons with influenza-like illness in a hospital area with an independent air-supply and exhaust system (909;922;924). UNRESOLVED ISSUE F. Personnel Restrictions In acute-care facilities, utilize the facility's employee health service or its equivalent to evaluate personnel with influenza-like illness and determine whether they should be removed from duties that involve direct patient contact. Use more stringent criteria for personnel who work in certain patient-care areas (e.g., ICUs, nurseries, and organ-transplant [especially HSCT] units) where patients who are most susceptible to influenza-related complications are located (920;993;1051). CATEGORY IB V. Control Of Influenza Outbreaks A. Determining the Outbreak Strain Early in the outbreak, perform rapid influenza virus testing on nasopharyngeal swab or nasal-wash specimens from patients with recent onset of symptoms suggestive of influenza. In addition, obtain viral cultures from a subset of patients to determine the infecting virus type and subtype (936-939). CATEGORY IB C. Antiviral Agent Administration 1. When a facility outbreak of influenza is suspected or recognized: a. Administer amantadine, rimantadine, or oseltamivir as prophylaxis to all patients without influenza illness in the involved unit for whom the antiviral agent is not contraindicated (regardless of whether they received influenza vaccinations during the previous fall) for a minimum of 2 weeks or until approximately 1 week after the end of the outbreak. Do not delay administration of the antiviral agent(s) for prophylaxis unless the results of diagnostic tests to identify the infecting strain(s) can be obtained within 12- Patients with flu-like symptoms, who are frail, immunosuppressed, have severe chronic comorbidities, are respiratory compromised, or have been admitted to a hospital should have laboratory confirmation of influenza. Patients experiencing severe influenza-like symptoms out of an epidemic season should also be given a diagnostic test. Immunofluorescense assays or PCR are the tests of choice. /Evidence for use of antiviral agents to treat influenza in the elderly, to prevent its occurrence, or to mitigate its complications, is unclear. Until this issue is resolved, physicians should use antiviral agents on a case-by-case basis.Traditional infection control measures are essential when there is any case of influenza, especially when there is an outbreak in a 227 long-term care facility.Measures to avoid transmission include non-pharmacological interventions, i.e., frequent hand washing, respiratory hygiene, and cough etiquette. Traditional infection control measures should obviously be instituted when there is any case of influenza (32, 34). In long-term care facilities, outbreaks of influenza should lead to the initiation of a comprehensive approach to contain virus transmission. Increased hand hygiene practices, as well as cleaning and disinfecting surfaces with an approved antiseptic product, use of droplet precautions (surgical masks), cohorting of residents, vaccination of those previously not immunized against influenza, and possibly prophylaxis with antiviral drugs. The utilization of these interventions should not replace vaccine administration (32).Smith, 2019; Country: USA, Sponsor: The Society for Healthcare Epidemiology of America and the Association for Professionals in Infection Control Scope: Recommendations are developed for long-term care (LTC) infection control programs based on interpretation of currently available evidence. The recommendations cover the structure and function of the infection control program A. Infection Control Program 1. An active, effective, facility-wide infection control program should be established in the LTCF. The purpose of the program is to help prevent the development and spread of infectious diseases (Category IC). Comment: The elements of a program generally include the following: a. Surveillance-Systematic data collection to identify infections in residents b. Outbreak control-A system for detection, investigation, and control of epidemic infectious diseases in the LTCF c. Isolation-An isolation and precautions system to reduce the risk of transmission of infectious agents d. Policies and procedures-Relevant to infection control (see Table 2 ) e. Education-Continuing education in infection prevention and control f. Resident health program g. Employee health program h. Antibiotic stewardship-A system for antibiotic review and control i. Disease reporting to public health authorities j. Facility management, including environmental control, waste management, product evaluation and disinfection, sterilization and asepsis k. Performance improvement/resident safety l. Preparedness planning 2. The infection control program must be in compliance with federal, state, and local regulations (Category IC).B. Infection Control Administrative Structure 1. Oversight of the infection control program should be defined and should include participation of the ICP, administration, nursing history of communicable diseases, illnesses, and incidents such as exposures to contagious diseases, needlesticks, injuries, and accidents. 10 . The LTCF should develop protocols for managing employee illnesses and exposures (such as bloodborne pathogens like HIV and hepatitis B and C, as well as TB, scabies, or gastroenteritis) (Category 1B/IC). Comment: An employee absentee policy that discourages the employee from working while ill should be developed.L. Education 1. Infection control education should be provided at the initiation of employment and regularly thereafter. Training should include all staff, especially those providing direct resident care (Category IC). 2. All programs should be documented with the date, topic, names of attendees, and evaluations (Category IC). Comment: Program topics should be timely and relevant to infection prevention and control. Basic hygiene, hand hygiene, respiratory etiquette, transmission of infectious diseases, occupational health, prevention of TB and bloodborne pathogens, Standard and Transmission-based Precautions, infection control standards, and the susceptibility of residents to infectious diseases are topics that should be included. The ICP may recommend topics. Surveillance data are of interest to staff and may be included as appropriate. The educators should evaluate the educational program and outcomes and use that information to modify future programs. Uyeki, 2019; Country: USA, Sponsor: Support for these guidelines was provided by the Infectious Diseases Society of America Scope: diagnostic testing and treatment of illness caused by infection with influenza A and B viruses circulating among humans during seasonal epidemics and does not address asymptomatic infections. The guidelines also address diagnostic testing and use of antivirals for management of institutional influenza outbreaks What Test(s) Should Be Used to Diagnose Influenza? Recommendations Clinicians should not use viral culture for initial or primary diagnosis of influenza because results will not be available in a timely manner to inform clinical management (A-III), but viral culture can be considered to confirm negative test results from RIDTs and immunofluorescence assays, such as during an institutional outbreak, and to provide isolates for further characterization (C-II).",

Restricting admissions to a LTCH in outbreak may create a backlog in emergency departments or acute care, with a risk to patients in that system.

There may be some respiratory outbreaks for which longer isolation periods are required. This would occur in consultation with the OMT. For influenza, the recommendation to isolate residents to their rooms is due to the increased viral shedding that occurs when patients are symptomatic; restriction of ill residents to their room is recommended as long as it does not cause the resident undue stress or agitation. If, however, restriction causes undue stress or agitation, alternative IPAC measures can be considered, including the use of a surgical mask and compliance with HH, at the discretion of the LTCH in consultation with the PHU.Residents with an ARI who are not in single room accommodation can be managed in their bed space using Droplet and Contact Precautions with privacy curtains drawn, where these accommodations are available.25 However, residents may leave their room if they are able to comply with HH requirements and with the use of a surgical mask.

Antiviral medication is recommended for the management of institutional outbreaks of influenza A and/or influenza B. Antivirals play a key role in outbreak management and control. Research has shown that antiviral drugs are effective for both the prevention (prophylaxis) and early treatment of influenza infection. The use of antiviral medication, in conjunction with other outbreak IPAC measures, can quickly bring influenza outbreaks in health care facilities under control.28 Influenza vaccination provides incomplete protection to the elderly and the immunocompromised.9 Antiviral medications offer protection that is additive to that of annual influenza immunization in these populations. Antiviral medications are also effective in the prevention of influenza in unvaccinated healthy adults.Two antiviral drugs are currently used in Canada for the treatment and prophylaxis of influenza. Oseltamivir (oral) and zanamavir (inhaled) are both neuraminidase inhibitors that help to prevent further replication of the influenza virus.28 Zanamivir is generally not recommended for residents, as they may have difficulty using the inhaler.Decisions regarding influenza antiviral prophylaxis or treatment should be made based on current data of circulating influenza strains, including antiviral resistance. Testing of influenza isolates for antiviral resistance is performed as part of routine laboratory surveillance at the National Microbiology Laboratory (NML), and is reported by PHO's Ontario Respiratory Pathogen Bulletin, the Laboratory-Based Respiratory Pathogen Surveillance Report and the national FluWatch report.Health care providers are advised to refer to updates on influenza activity and antiviral resistance patterns in ongoing surveillance reports mentioned above.",

Advance medical orders can substantially expedite administration of antiviral medications. \u2022Staff who are unimmunized against influenza for any reason should be informed that in the event of an outbreak, they may be given the option of taking antiviral medication for the duration of the outbreak in order to continue their duties, or if unable or refuse to take antiviral medication for the duration of the outbreak, they may be excluded from working in the LTCH depending on the policy of theLTCH.5 \u2022To facilitate antiviral treatment during outbreaks, staff who are unable to receive the influenza vaccine should be assessed for eligibility for antiviral drugs such asoseltamivir or zanamivir prior to the influenza season.

In addition, staff who are not immunized, who 260 conduct activities in the LTCH, and who are assessed as being able to take antiviral medication, may wish to obtain and keep prescriptions on hand to assist with timely commencement of antivirals, in the event of an influenza outbreak.5 \u2022During the influenza season, LTCH administration must keep a current list of staff working in the LTCH who are not immunized, in order to promptly implement control measures such as antiviral prophylaxis and cohorting staff.5 Other control measures such as non-patient care work arrangements or staff exclusions may also be considered.",

            "text": "During a public health-confirmed influenza outbreak, antiviral medication for prevention shall be offered to all residents/patients in the outbreak-affected area who are not already ill with influenza, whether previously vaccinated or not, until the outbreak is declared over.In addition, all unvaccinated asymptomatic staff who work in the area of the LTCH where the influenza outbreak is occurring should be advised to take prophylactic antiviral medication until the outbreak is declared over. During a confirmed influenza outbreak, when the circulating strain is not well-matched by the vaccine, antiviral prophylaxis may be offered to all staff, regardless of vaccination status, as determined by the OMT or in consultation with the Medical Officer of Health or designate until the outbreak is declared over. PHUs may consult with PHO regarding scientific and technical support regarding evidence of a mismatch. Antiviral prophylaxis should be initiated as soon as an influenza outbreak is declared. In almost all situations, it is prudent to wait for laboratory confirmation of influenza before initiating prophylaxis and treatment. Once the specimen reaches the appropriate laboratory, rapid test results are usually available within one business day. In some circumstances, the Medical Officer of Health may provide recommendations for prophylaxis prior to laboratory confirmation. Institutions should consult with PHU representatives on the outbreak management team when starting antiviral prophylaxis and treatment.Recommendations regarding influenza antiviral prophylaxis: \u2022It is reasonable to allow unvaccinated staff to work with residents or patients on an outbreak unit as soon as they start antiviral prophylaxis. Unless there is a contraindication, consenting staff should also immediately be offered immunization against influenza with the current seasonal influenza vaccine. \u2022In healthy adults, it takes two weeks to develop antibodies to the influenza virus after receiving the influenza vaccine. Staff who have been vaccinated for less than two weeks at the time the influenza outbreak is declared should take antiviral prophylaxis for two weeks after vaccination or until the outbreak is declared over (whichever comes first). Note: Antiviral medications do not interfere with the immune response to vaccine. \u2022Staff should be alerted to the symptoms and signs of influenza, particularly within the first 4 days after starting antiviral prophylaxis. Staff illness should immediately be reported to the supervisor, ICP and/or occupational health. Staff reporting signs and symptoms of 261 influenza should be excluded from working in any healthcare setting if symptoms develop. This information should be shared with the local public health representative. \u2022Prophylaxis may be discontinued once the influenza outbreak is declared over. \u2022Prophylaxis may also be given during influenza season in institutional settings not experiencing an influenza outbreak to unvaccinated individuals at high-risk of influenza-related complications, at the discretion of the treating physician.\u2022If a person taking a neuraminidase inhibitor (i.e. oseltamivir or zanamivir) for prophylaxis of influenza develops symptoms of an influenza-like illness, the neuraminidase inhibitor can be continued, however, the neuraminidase inhibitor should be increased to the recommended treatment dose. Consideration should be given to obtaining a nasopharyngeal specimen if the individual has been on antiviral prophylaxis for more than four days to determine the presence of a resistant strain or another respiratory virus.",

Advantages of a whole-facility approach include: preventing the spread of the outbreak to other units, preventing the introduction from another outside source when influenza is circulating in the community, not needing to be as vigilant to detect the spread on another unit as would be needed if surveillance is being used as a trigger for prophylaxis, and preventing the need to manage an outbreak unit by unit as new units are added. Disadvantages to the whole-facility approach include: logistics of using antiviral medication for a large number of residents, the theoretical potential for resistance if the drug is widely used for prevention, antiviral availability, and the potential for side effects occurring in a larger number of residents.",
