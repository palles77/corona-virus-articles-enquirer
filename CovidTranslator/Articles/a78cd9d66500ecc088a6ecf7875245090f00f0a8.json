Diagnosis. It can occur on any part of the body, but the perineum, extremities, and truncal areas are most involved. Presenting symptoms are swelling that may evolve into tense erythema that may progress to a dusky blue and pain out of proportion to what is visible. Palpable crepitus from air formation and soft tissue air on X-ray is also pathogonomic but not always present. Local symptoms may be accompanied by systemic symptoms of sepsis and shock. Common bacterial organisms. Usually the cause is polymicrobial with both anaerobic and aerobic gram-positive and gram-negative organisms to include Vibrio, group A and B streptococci, enterococci, staphylococci, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas, Proteus, Serratia, Clostridium, and rarely fungal organisms, including Aspergillus, Zygomycetes, and Candida.

Empiric antibiotic prophylaxis is not recommended for patients who are not symptomatic. Persons who develop a skin lesion or other illness within 1 month after removing a tick should be instructed to seek medical attention to rule out any tick-borne diseases (Lyme disease, Rocky Mountain spotted fever, ehrlichiosis, tularemia, babesiosis, or Colorado tick fever).

The usual causes of acute bronchitis are viral infections that affect the upper airways (influenza A and B virus; parainfluenza type 1, 2, and 3; coronavirus; rhinovirus; RSV; and human meta-pneumovirus).

Patients that complain of a chronic cough, defined as lasting for longer than 3 weeks, can include noninfectious entities such as postnasal drip, asthma, and gastroesophageal reflux.The indications for a chest X-ray in patients with an acute cough to rule out pneumonia are patients with abnormal vital signs (increased respiratory rate, difficulty in respiratory effort, stridor or tachypnea, and oxygen saturations below 92%) or crackles on chest examination.The main treatment issue in cases of acute bronchitis is the use of antibiotics.",

Sinusitis can be caused by or precipitated by several viruses (rhinovirus, parainfluenza, and influenza), allergic rhinitis, or nasal foreign bodies.The diagnosis of ABS is based on clinical criteria in patients who present with upper respiratory symptoms that are persistent, severe, or worsening after an initial viral upper respiratory infection (URI).The clinical criteria used to make the diagnosis of ABS in patients that have recently had a viral URI or allergic rhinitis event are new maxillary sinus pain, purulent nasal drainage, postnasal discharge, and cough. It is the general agreement that radiographs are not necessary for the diagnosis of sinusitis in children 6 years old and younger, and the American College of Radiology has taken the position that the diagnosis should be made on clinical grounds alone for all ages.
