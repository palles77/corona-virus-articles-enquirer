Here, we provide new significant insights on the involvement of lipids in the structure and function of the CoV E protein channel on the basis of three series of experiments. First, reversal potential measurements over a wide range of pH allow the dissection of the contributions to channel selectivity coming from ionizable residues of the protein transmembrane domain and also from the negatively charged groups of diphytanoyl phosphatidylserine (DPhPS) lipid. The corresponding effective pKas are consistent with the model pKas of the acidic residue candidates for titration. Second, the change of channel conductance with salt concentration reveals two distinct regimes (Donnan-controlled electrodiffusion and bulk-like electrodiffusion) fully compatible with the outcomes of selectivity experiments. Third, by measuring channel conductance in mixtures of neutral diphytanoyl phosphatidylcholine (DPhPC) lipids and negatively charged DPhPS lipids in low and high salt concentrations we conclude that the protein-lipid conformation in the channel is likely the same in charged and neutral lipids. Overall, the whole set of experiments supports the proteolipidic structure of SARS-CoV E channels and explains the large difference in channel conductance observed between neutral and charged membranes. j o u r n a l h o m e p a g e : w w w . e l s e v i e r . c o m / l o c a t e / b b a m e m Bulk solution conductivity(S/m)",

All coronaviruses express the envelope (E) protein, a multifunctional short polypeptide involved in virus morphogenesis and virulence [2] [3] [4] [5] . SARS-CoV E protein is 76 amino acid long and contains an alpha-helical transmembrane (TM) domain that spans the lipid membrane with~28 residues [6] (Fig. 1 ) SARS-CoV E protein oligomerizes forming a pentameric structure that displays ion channel activity [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] a remarkable function for this protein that may affect virus host interaction.",

This data suggested that lipid molecules likely assemble with E protein oligomers to form a combined proteolipidic structure. In this structure the lipids could be only located at the channel entrances, or alternatively, within the lipid polar heads, stabilized by peptides, lining totally or partially the pore wall. The ion channel activity of a number of transmembrane proteins, as well as of small peptides and antimicrobial peptides, is strongly dependent on the lipid environment [13, 14] . Actually, evidence on the lipid involvement in the channel structure is often obtained from the sensitivity of the pore-forming activity to the curvature of the lipid bilayer membranes [15] . The reason for that lies in the high energy cost of assembling lipidic structures in membranes with intrinsic curvature that usually inhibits the channel activity [16] . In this sense, we observed a lower probability of pore formation by SARS-CoV E protein in membranes containing phosphatidylethanolamine (DOPE), a lipid with negative intrinsic curvature [12] , which suggests a significant involvement of lipid molecules in channel structure.",

Several series of experiments are reported that have in common the modulation of the effective protein and lipid charge presented to the small ions crossing the aqueous pore [18] . First, reversal potential measurements under different pH conditions enabled us to identify the contributions of ionizable residues of the protein TM and also of the negatively charged groups of DPhPS lipid to channel selectivity. Secondly, the change of channel conductance in membranes containing varying ratios of neutral DPhPC lipids and charged DPhPS lipids in low and high salt concentrations was studied. Finally, protein and lipid charges were modified by changing the salt concentration of the solution both in neutral and charged membranes and the corresponding channel conductance and the solution conductivity were determined.",

From those results it became apparent the large influence of the lipid charge on the channel preference for cations. To further analyze this effect, channel selectivity in solutions of varying acidity was measured using the same concentration gradient used in previous studies (500 mM cis|50 mM trans). Two series of reversal potential measurements were performed over a wide range of pH (1.5-7): first in neutral membranes (DPhPC) and then, using negatively charged membranes (DPhPS). The channel selectivity was strongly dependent on the net charge of the host lipid (Fig. 3) . When reconstituted in DPhPC, the channel displayed a very SARS-CoV E protein sequence. E protein is divided into three domains: the amino terminal (N-terminal), the transmembrane and the carboxy terminal (C-terminal). Red letters represent hydrophobic amino acids, and blue letters indicate hydrophilic amino acids. Asterisks highlight polar charged amino acids located at the beginning (two glutamic acid residues) and at the end (an arginine) of the transmembrane domain, respectively. mild cationic selectivity at neutral pH (ratio of the permeability to positive versus negative ions, P + /P \u2212 = 1 \u00b1 0.1) and a moderate anionic selectivity in highly acidic solutions (pH 1.5) (P + /P \u2212 = 0.3 \u00b1 0.1).

The easiest interpretation of this second effective pKa seen in the titration curve is to ascribe this value to the carboxyl group of the PS polar head although titration of the phosphate group cannot be totally excluded. This would support the view that lipids line the pore lumen and not only contribute but also determine the channel selectivity. The model pKas of serine carboxyl group reported in the literature are in the range 2.5-4.5 [29, 30] . However, when the ionization occurs in confined spaces as the pore, where protons see a different electric potential near the ionizable site, it is expected a significant deviation from the model pKa [30] . In concentrated solutions the apparent pKa (the one obtained from titration curves) should be shifted towards lower values [31] . Interestingly, the fitting value of pKa1 = 4.3 is the same in both series of measurements. This fact may indicate that the protonation of glutamates in the TM protein domain is not affected by the presence of carboxyl groups of the lipid polar heads despite the presumably tight arrangement of the TM helices and the lipid molecules. This is consistent with the fact that there are many more carboxyl than glutamate groups lining the pore so that the organization of helices and lipid molecules in the pore may be such that both types of charged groups are kept apart from each other.",

Bearing in mind that lipid polar heads are neutral at such low pH, this anionic selectivity can only arise from positively charged residues of the TM helices like arginine R38.

These values raise relevant questions. The main one is how to interpret the result obtained for DPhPC that is almost twice the value obtained for DPhPS. This, together with huge standard deviations found in the experiments could question whether the unitary channel conductance reported in neutral membranes is truly a single-channel conductance or it is the result of two simultaneous insertion events. To address this issue, we measured channel conductance in membranes with variable lipid composition between pure DPhPC and pure DPhPS. The values of channel conductance were extracted from the histograms of current jump amplitudes. Both new insertions as well as channel closures were considered as events for the statistics [12] . The experimental results in 1 M KCl solutions and pH 6 are shown at the top panel of Fig. 4 (circles). There is a smooth transition from 370 pS (DPhPC membranes) to 190 pS (DPhPS membranes) and the channel conductance decreases with the mass percentage of DPhPS lipid. This result clearly supports the interpretation already given in the preliminary version of these experiments [12] , confirming that the channel conductance in 1 M KCl decreases as the charge of the lipid increases (Fig. 4) .",

According to intuitive electrostatic arguments, the accumulation of ions near the pore entrance due to the lipid charge should give just the opposite effect, i.e. greater channel conductance in DPhPS. Thus, we may ask whether the difference in conductance requires more elaborated arguments or if it could just be explained by a change in the aqueous pore size caused by a different lipid-protein conformation. A new series of conductance measurements performed in membranes of variable composition using diluted KCl solutions (30 mM) could shed some light on this issue. The experiments reported at the bottom panel of Fig. 4 (triangles) show that channel conductance in neutral membranes is lower (almost one third) than in fully charged membranes, exactly opposite to what was observed in concentrated salt solutions. If the changes in conductance with the lipid composition were simply a consequence of different protein-lipid conformations yielding changes in the pore size, the ionic current should decrease or increase in a similar way at low and high salt concentrations. Although a change in the pore size between DPhPC and DPhPS membranes cannot be categorically excluded, the main cause for this large change in channel conductance between them must be sought elsewhere.",

This means that the interaction between the permeating ions and the channel is so weak that ion conduction in the pore and in bulk solution is pretty similar to each other. This is consistent with the weak selectivity of the channel at neutral pH (see Fig. 3 , top plot) [12] . The channel resembles a neutral nanopore and ion permeation is barely influenced by the low fixed charge density in the protein TM domain. In contrast, when channel conductance is measured in DPhPS membranes, two distinct regimes were observed. In low concentration solutions (30-100 mM KCl), channel conductance is~70 pS and is independent of conductivity. In contrast, in more concentrated solutions (0.3-1.5 M KCl) conductance increases with conductivity but does not scale with bulk conductivity, as it is the case in charged pores [14] . This result is in line with the cationic selectivity of the CoV E channel in negatively charged membranes (see Fig. 3 , bottom plot) and with the fact that the preference for K + ions should be reflected on the channel conductance, particularly when KCl concentration is smaller than the effective negative fixed charge concentration in the pore.",

For conductance values in DPhPS \u03c1 = 0.94 M. Despite the simplicity of the theory invoked, both values give accurate fits of the respective measurements and are consistent with the change of conductance with solution conductivity. In DPhPC, only the negative residues of the protein TM domain contribute to the fixed charge concentration and their effect is of minor importance. In DPhPS membranes, as long as the bulk concentration is smaller than \u03c1, the ion concentration inside the pore rises to match \u03c1 so that local electroneutrality is ensured. Charge neutrality is then the reason why in this regime, channel conductance is higher than in a neutral pore and almost independent of bulk concentration. When bulk concentration becomes comparable to \u03c1, counterions (ions of opposite charge to \u03c1) accumulate and coions (ions with the same charge as \u03c1) are excluded following Donnan equilibria. Finally, when salt concentration is much greater than \u03c1, Donnan exclusion comes to be negligible and conductance increases almost linearly with the total ion concentration in the pore, similarly to a neutral pore.",

On one side, reversal potential experiments indicate that although both the protein and the lipid charges participate in the overall ionic selectivity of the pore, they play separate roles that can be clearly dissected. On the other side, channel conductance measurements suggest that the lipid charges contribute to the channel current by accumulating counterions as described by the well-known Donnan equilibrium. However, this simple effect must be handled with care because it leads to distinct regimes depending on the balance between the bulk electrolyte concentration and the average fixed charge concentration inside the channel. Interestingly, both kinds of experiments performed in neutral and charge lipids can be rationalized with no need to appeal to different channel conformations. This does not exclude the existence of different protein-lipid conformations, but stresses how important is the understanding of charge regulation effects that otherwise could be mistakenly attributed to changes in pore size.
