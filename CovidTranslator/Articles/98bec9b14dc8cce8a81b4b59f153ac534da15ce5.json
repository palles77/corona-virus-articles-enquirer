Their disparate detection rates of adenovirus and rotavirus from stool samples taken in two different rural areas in South Africa is intriguing and warrants further investigation. However, I would hesitate to ascribe an aetiological role to these adenoviruses merely on the basis of electron microscopy of stools of patients with diarrhoea and vomiting. Further work is needed to differentiate these viruses from respiratory adenoviruses and commensal enteric adenoviruses.",

Stools were examined by negative-staining electron microscopy and we were unable to detect adenoviruses in any of these specimens. The rates of rotavirus detection were low, varying from 6%2 to 19%,7 and this was thought at first to be due to patients reporting for medical care late in the course of their illness when the excretion of virus particles dropped below the detection limit of the electron microscope. In a recent study (unpublished) the low rotavirus detection rate in the Black population (7%, 3 out of 41) was confirmed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay as well as by electron microscopy; in contrast, the figure for the White population was 56% (14 out of 25). Adenovirus was again conspicuously absent. The reasons for this low frequency of rotavirus in the Black population, which does not appear to be related to the high incidence of lactase deficiency in this population,8 are being investigated.",

He states that in his wide experience of acute porphyria he has never encountered an attack induced by alcohol and consequently does not advise his patients to abstain from drinking.

Our experience in the management of porphyria over three decades is similar. On several occasions, we have been surprised by the small quantities of alcohol which have triggered attacks in some of our patients with frequently relapsing porphyria. Two patients who have each had, over the past three years, an average of 7 attacks per year, have independently discovered that drinking only one glass of vodka or two glasses of sherry is sufficient to precipitate an attack. On the basis of their personal experience of the effects of alcohol on their porphyria, both have become teetotal.",

Ethanol is a well known porphyrinogen and induces hepatic ALA synthase activity in laboratory animals.2 We have demonstrated in healthy non-porphyric subjects that the ingestion of 200 ml vodka (1-316 mol ethanol), raises the activity of leucocyte ALA synthase by a mean of 110%3 and similar distrubances of haem biosynthesis are observed in alcoholics.4 One should also remember that the primary aetiological agent in the development of cutaneous hepatic porphyria is ethanol, as a consequence of its effects upon haem synthesis. It is for these reasons that alcohol figures so largely on lists of drugs contraindicated in the porphyrias. 5 5 With recommends more liberal use of drugs as well as of alcohol in porphyria patients. We agree that it is difficult to be certain of the safety or otherwise of certain drugs in acute porphyria. The response also varies from patient to patient. However, we must strongly advocate caution and avoidance of potential porphyrinogens when prescribing for and advising porphyria patients, as detailed in the recent international review. There is still no dependable form of therapy for the acute attack so prevention of such attacks is of paramount importance.",
