Analysis of the consensus full-length genome for three different IBV serotypes (Ark, GA98, and Mass41) showed that passage in embryonated eggs, to attenuate the viruses for chickens, resulted in 34.75-43.66% of all the amino acid changes occurring in nsp 3 within a virus type, whereas changes in the spike glycoprotein, thought to be the most variable protein in IBV, ranged from 5.8 to 13.4% of all changes. The attenuated viruses did not cause any clinical signs of disease and had lower replication rates than the pathogenic viruses of the same serotype in chickens. However, both attenuated and pathogenic viruses of the same serotype replicated similarly in embryonated eggs, suggesting that mutations in nsp 3, which is involved in replication of the virus, might play an important role in the reduced replication observed in chickens leading to the attenuated phenotype.",

Transcription occurs through a leader-primed RNA synthesis mechanism that results for IBV in six 3 0 co-terminal subgenomic mRNA molecules. Four structural proteins-spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M), and nucleocapsid (N)-along with the viral RNA make up the enveloped virion. The N protein binds to the viral RNA forming the ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complex. The E and the M protein are membrane bound proteins that play a role in virus assembly [4] . The S glycoprotein on the surface of the virus mediates attachment to the host cell, is responsible for fusion of the host cell membrane and viral envelope, and in IBV, it contains epitopes that define serotype and induce neutralizing antibodies [5] . The S glycoprotein of IBV is post-translationally cleaved into S1 and S2 subunits, and the S1 subunit is reported to have three hypervariable regions [6] [7] [8] . Mutations, insertions, deletions, and recombination in S contribute to the genetic diversity of IBV, which is recognized as different genetic or serologic types of the virus [5] .",

            "text": "Two polyproteins 1a and 1ab account for approximately two-thirds of the viral genome-coding region and make up the replication transcription complex (RTC). The polyprotein 1ab is translated through a-1 frame-shift translation mechanism that occurs approximately 20-40% of the time [9] . The IBV 1a and 1ab polyproteins are post-translationally cleaved into 15 nonstructural proteins (nsps), nsps 2 through 16 by a papain-like protease (PLP) and the main protease (Mpro), also referred to as the 3C-like protease [10] . IBV does not have an nsp 1 equivalent found in some other coronaviruses. The PLP contained within nsp 3 is divided into PL1 and PL2 papain-like proteases. The PL1 protease, present in other coronaviruses, is truncated and nonfunctional in IBV, thus PL2 cleaves nsps 2, 3, and 4 [11] . The Mpro contained within nsp 5 cleaves nsps 5 through 16 . The biological characteristics of many nsps have been previously reported [9, 10, [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] . In addition to nsps 3 and 5, which contain proteases PL2 and Mpro, respectively, nsps 2, 4, and 6 contain hydrophobic residues predicted to play a role in anchoring the RTC to the Golgi. Nonstructural proteins 7, 8, 9, and 10 are reported to have RNA-binding activity. Nonstructural protein 11/12 is the RNA-dependent RNA-polymerase, nsp 13 is a RNA helicase, nsp 14 is an exoribonuclease, nsp 15 is an endoribonuclease, and nsp 16 is a methyltransferase.",

However, the ectodomain of the S glycoprotein from the Beaudette strain of IBV, an attenuated laboratory strain, was replaced with an S from a pathogenic strain (Mass 41 strain) of the same serotype. This chimeric virus was shown to induce an immune response but remained nonpathogenic in chickens, indicating that the S glycoprotein is not solely responsible for pathogenicity of IBV [2, 20] . In another study, a chimeric IBV was created with the replicase genes 1a and 1ab from the attenuated Beaudette strain, and all of the structural genes from the pathogenic Mass 41 strain including the S gene. This chimeric virus was not pathogenic in chickens, indicating that the replicase proteins also appear to be determinants of IBV pathotype [2, 21] . Genetic differences reported in 1a and S between virulent and avirulent strains of IBV also led others to suggest that the replicase proteins, in addition to S, are involved in the pathotype of the virus [22] .",

Briefly, the viruses were filtered through a 0.8-lm filter then through a 0.22-lm filter (Millipore, Billerica, MA) prior to RNA extraction. Viral RNA was purified using the high pure RNA isolation kit according to the manufacturer's recommendation (Roche Diagnostic Corporation, Foster City, CA) and re-suspended in DEPC-treated water. Reverse transcription (RT) and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification were performed with the Takara RNA LA PCR kit (Takara Bio Inc., Otsu, Shiga, Japan) using a random primer and an amplification primer in a strand displacement amplification reaction following the manufacture's protocol. The sequence of the random reverse transcription primer was 5 0 -AGC GGG GGT TGT CGA ATG TTT GAN NNN N-3 0 , and the amplification primer sequence, which is designed to anneal to the complement of the conserved region on the random primer, was 5 0 -AGC GGG GGT TGT CGA ATG TTT GA-3 0 . Both primers were obtained from Integrated DNA Technologies, Inc. (Coralville, IA). For the RT reaction, a master mix was prepared, which included MgCl 2 (5 mM), 109 RNA PCR buffer (19) , dNTP mixture (1 mM), RNase inhibitor (1 units/ll), reverse transcriptase (0.25 units/ll), 5 0 degenerate primer (2.5 lM), and RNA (5.75 ll/reaction) then 10 ll per sample was aliquoted in a thermocycler tube. The reaction conditions for the RT reaction were 10 min at 30\u00b0C for the primer annealing then an hour at 50\u00b0C for extension followed by a five-minute incubation at 99\u00b0C for inactivation of the enzyme and a five-minute period at 5\u00b0C. A PCR master mix-which included at the final concentrations MgCl 2 (2.5 mM), 109 LA PCR Buffer (19) , sterilized distilled water (32.25 ll), Takara LA Taq (1.25U/50 ll), and 5 0 primer (0.2 lM)-was prepared and 10 ll of the RT reaction was added to 40 ll of the mix.

A schematic representation of nsp 3 and number of amino acid changes in each domain is presented in Fig. 2 . The nsp 3 ORF has 43.66% of all amino acid differences observed between Ark/Ark-DPI/81 and Ark-attenuated (including a ten amino acid deletion in the attenuated virus at positions 789-798), 34.75% of all amino acid differences observed between GA98/CWL0470/98 and GA98-attenuated (including an eight amino acid deletion in the pathogenic virus at positions 901-908 and a three amino acid deletion in the pathogenic virus at positions 950-952), and 37.08% of all amino acid differences observed between Mass/Mass41/41 and Mass-attenuated (including a ten amino acid deletion in the attenuated virus at positions 797-806). These changes represent 1.96, 5.18, and 11.06 differences per 100 amino acids within nsp 3 for Ark, GA98 and Mass 41, respectively.

            "text": "In this study, we analyzed the consensus full-length genome for the pathogenic and attenuated viruses of three different IBV types and showed that within a virus type, 34.75 to 43.66% of all the amino acid changes between the pathotypes occurred in nsp 3, whereas changes in spike ranged from 5.8 to 13.4% of all changes. It should be noted, however, that spike had the highest number of differences between different serotypes of the virus, which is consistent with previous reports [5] [6] [7] [8] . A high percentage of differences between pathogenic and attenuated viruses within a serotype in nsp 3 suggests this region plays a key role in pathogenicity. The nsp 3 is a complex protein with multiple domains making it an attractive target for antiviral drug design [9, 32] . It is approximately 1,600 amino acid residues in length and consists of an acidic domain, an ADP-ribose 1 phosphatase, the PL2 protease (a deubiquitinating protease), Y and transmembrane domains. The acidic domain is of unknown function, however; there is some evidence that it possesses nucleic acid binding activity because it is consistently co-purified with singlestranded RNA [33] . Previous studies with other organisms indicate that electrostatic interactions from this type of domain play a key role in ligand binding [34] . Influenza A viruses also contain a polymerase acidic protein (PA) that is required for the transcription and replication activity of the viral polymerase [34] . Differences between pathogenic and attenuated IBV strains within a serotype, including deletions in Ark and Mass41 viruses, were in and around the acidic domain within nsp 3 (Fig. 2) . Thus, it is likely that the acidic domain plays a role in attenuation in chickens but the exact function(s) of the amino acids in this domain is unclear. It was interesting that we observed an eight and a three amino acid deletion in the pathogenic virus GA98/CWL0470/98 at positions 901-908 and 950-952, respectively, compared to the GA98-attenuated virus. Since sequence insertions are not likely to occur during the attenuation process, the GA98-attenuated virus possibly represents a minor undetected subpopulation in the pathogenic virus, which was selected by passage in embryonated eggs.",

This suggests that the ADP-ribose-1 protein may be functional in the pathogenic and attenuated IBV viruses and is consistent with the results of the Mass 41-X domain as reported by Xu et al. [14] . The ADP-ribose-1 phosphatase may be important in pathogenicity of IBV because it has been shown to play a role in ADP ribosylation, a post-translational protein modification involved in DNA damage repair and transcription regulation [14] . In addition, it was reported that the ADP-ribose-1 is dispensable for viral replication in tissue culture, suggesting that this domain is involved in regulation of viral replication rather than the actual replication process [36] .",

Most coronaviruses have two papain-like proteases; however, in IBV the PL1 protease is truncated and is nonfunctional [16] . The structure of the PL2 protease domain was determined to be a ''thumb-palm-finger'' motif [37] . This domain has also been shown to be a potent IFN antagonist by inhibiting the phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF-3) causing a disruption in the activation of the type I IFN response through Toll-like receptor 3 (TLR 3) or retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I) [38] . Although the catalytic triad of the PL2 protease is conserved, amino acid changes between the pathogenic and attenuated viruses are observed in the PL2 protease, which could affect the efficiency of this IFN antagonist leading to altered viral replication in the cell. The disruption of IFN signaling has been shown in many viral infections, including SARS-CoV, dengue virus, and paramyxoviruses [39] [40] [41] . The IBV PL2 viral protease was also shown to have characteristics similar to ubiquitin-specific proteases [42] . Deubuquitinating proteases, which remove ubiquitin from proteins that have been marked by cellular mechanisms for ATP-dependent degradation, could be a potential mechanism by which the virus can alter the cellular environment favoring replication.",

The transmembrane domain is inserted into the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane co-translationally and plays an important scaffolding role for the replication transcription complex [9] . Recently, it was shown that three transmembrane domains were predicted for the SARS-CoV nsp 3 but only two were found to span the ER membrane orienting the protease domain of nsp 3 on the cytoplasmic side where viral replication occurs [13, 15] . In murine hepatitis virus (MHV), five transmembrane domains were predicted but only two domains were found to span the membrane, also locating the protease domain on the cytoplasm side [13, 15] . Our sequence data for IBV predicts four transmembrane domains within nsp 3. Assuming the protease domain is located on the cytoplasm side of the membrane, we predict that either two or all four transmembrane domains would be used.",

Our data strongly support these studies and further indicate that changes in nsp 3 play a key role in IBV pathotype. It should also be emphasized that pathogenicity in avian coronaviruses is likely polygenic, since we and others [22] observed amino acid substitutions in other viral proteins including spike. The 6b ORF detected in TCoV (GenBank accession numbers ACB87503 and ACB87504) is identified in Ark and GA98 viruses herein. Only one amino acid difference was observed between the Ark viruses, but 43 differences as well as 3 amino acid deletions and 1 insertion are observed between GA98 viruses. An attempt to identify a subpopulation in the GA98/CWL0470/98 pathogenic virus with the GA98attenuated gene 6b was unsuccessful. It is not clear why gene 6b is so variable between the GA98 viruses but it appears recombination rather than mutations over time may have played a role. A nucleotide blast analysis indicated that the GA98/CWL040/98 virus was 98% similar to Mass H120 a vaccine virus and the GA98-attenuated virus was 98% similar to Ark-DPI a pathogenic virus, suggesting an origin for those genes. Nonetheless, assuming the 6b ORF is expressed, it apparently does not play a role in defining pathotype.",

When the same amount of virus was administered, birds given the attenuated virus compared to birds given the homologous pathogenic virus had less virus detected in the trachea at all sampling times and the difference was statistically significant for most of the time points. Thus, it appears that the amount of IBV replication in the trachea correlates with the ability of the virus to cause disease in chickens. Attachment and entry, and replication of the attenuated virus (for chickens) were not impaired because it grew to the same titer (with the exception of one time point) as the pathogenic virus in 10-day-old embryonated eggs. Inefficient attachment and entry into chicken host cells in vivo could be due to changes in spike. And decreased replication of the attenuated viruses could be due to the inability of the virus to overcome some as yet unidentified innate defense mechanism(s) in chicken cells that is not present in embryonic cells. Domains within nsp 3 associated with the deubiquitinating protease or IFN antagonists are likely candidates for further research.",

The exact mechanism(s) surrounding the interaction of virus and host processes affecting virus replication have yet to be determined for IBV, but identifying the sequence changes in the virus responsible for reduced replication and attenuation is an important step in elucidating those mechanisms.
