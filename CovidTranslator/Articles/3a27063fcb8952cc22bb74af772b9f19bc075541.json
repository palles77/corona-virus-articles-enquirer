Microbiol., Development is reported of a feline cell line which can support the growth of coronaviruses from canine (CCV), feline (FIPV) and porcine (TGEV) species. The cell culture has been serially transferred over 100 times and has retained its initial growth requirements, proliferative capacity and morphologic features. Each virus had specific growth characteristics in this cell culture although all produced a similar CPE and plaques under agar. Croos neutralization studies demonstrated a two-way relationship between TGEV and CCV and between TGEV and FIPV, whereas a one-way relationship was demonstrated between CCV and FIPV.",

            "text": "Coronaviruses have been associated with a wide variety of diseases in animals and human beings (Tyrrell et al., 1978) . Investigations of the pathogenesis and basic properties of these viruses have been impeded due to the fastidious nature of their growth requirements (Robb and Bond, 1980) . Cultivation of the enteric strains has usually been limited to their growth in the host animal or cells and tissues derived from that host (McIntosh, 1974) . The feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV) has been grown at low infectivity titers by co-cultivation of infected peritoneal macrophages with feline cell cultures (Black, 1980; Pedersen et al., 1981a) , in intestinal and tracheal ring cultures (Hoshino and Scott, 1978) , in fetal feline lung cultures (O'Reilly et al., 1979; Hitchcock et al., 1981) and in the brains of newborn mice (Osterhaus et al., 1978a) , rats and hamsters (Osterhaus et al., 1978b) . The canine coronavirus (CCV) has been grown in canine kidney cell cultures (Binn et al., 1980) and in a human rectal adenocarcinoma cell line (Laporte and Bobulesco, 1981) . The porcine transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) has been grown in primary and secondary pig kidney (McClurkin, 1965) , thyroid (Tyrrell et al., 1978) and testes cultures (McClurkin and Norman, 1966) , and has also been propagated in a primary canine kidney culture (Welter, 1965) . The absence of a single cell culture system capable of supporting the growth of coronaviruses from more than one animal species has limited studies of the antigenic and serological relationships among these viruses.",

The CPE was characterized by an increase in opacity of cells, rounding and detaching of cells, and occasionally, syncytium formation. The increase in opacity and rounding of infected cells made the CPE easy to detect against the fibroblast-like cells in the rest of the culture (Fig. 1B) . The CPE was focal and did not appear to spread from the initial foci. However, trypsin dispersion of infected cultures did distribute the infected cells among the non-infected cells and this procedure increased the number of foci in the subculture. The highest FIPV titers were obtained when viral infected cell culture fluids were mixed with normal FC cells at the time plates and flasks were seeded and then allowed to become confluent. Viral plaque titers of 1 X l0 s pfu/ml or greater were obtained by this method. Stock FIPV, maintained at --80 \u00b0 C, had to be passaged every 6 months to maintain high FIPV plaque titers as the virus titer decreased 2 log10units during this storage interval.",

Although the growth procedures for each virus were different, they all produced a CPE in the FC cells that was similar to that reported for cultivation of each virus in cells or tissues derived for the host animal (Pedersen et al., 1981a; Binn et al., 1975; Kemeny, 1978) . While the FC cell culture supported the growth of these viruses, it would be less useful for primary isolation of individual viruses from field cases because of initial low viral titers and the need for blind passage~ Another disadvantage is the limited number of virus strains tested in the cells. There are numerous other strains of each virus that may or may not replicate in this system. The addition of trypsin to the agar overlay is a requirement for the formation of FIPV plaques, and it enhanced the development of CCV and TGEV plaques. The reasons for this were not investigated, although it is in agreement with a previous report on the use of trypsin with bovine coronavirus (Storz et al., 1981) .",

The antigenic relationships previously reported between TGEV and CCV, and TGEV and FIPV, were confirmed (Cartwright and Lucas, 1972; Pedersen et al., 1978; Reynolds et al., 1980) . A strong two-way neutralization activity occurred between TGEV and CCV while a much weaker activity occurred between TGEV and FIPV. In contrast, the relationship between CCV and FIPV ap-peared to be one-way, because FIPV antisera would neutralize CCV but CCV antisera would not neutralize FIPV. The differences reported in this study and those of previous reports may be due to the low number of samples evaluated in this study. However, since all three viruses replica~ da this system, the exact interrelationships among these viruses may now be much easier to determine. In addition, the relationship of the recently reported feline enteric coronavirus (Pedersen et al., 1981b) to these viruses will be much easier to evaluate.",
