Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) mediates the cleavage of angiotensin (Ang) I into Ang II, a peptide that acts downstream on specific angiotensin type I (AT-1) receptors, which together are all important targets for modern HF therapeutics. Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is a recently discovered homolog and, in contrast to other members of RAAS, ACE2 is seemingly protective in HF (1) . It is an integral membrane carboxypeptidase that removes the terminal amino-acid from Ang II, resulting in the production of a biologically active peptide, Ang (1) (2) (3) (4) (5) (6) (7) , that antagonizes the effects of Ang II by activating the Mas receptor (2, 3) . Mice that are deficient in ACE2 have increased Ang II levels and a severe cardiac contractility defect that is reversed by the genetic deletion of ACE (4) . Intracardiac overexpression of ACE2 prevents Ang II-induced hypertension and cardiac fibrosis, implicating a direct in vivo cardioprotective role for ACE2, in addition to suggesting possible therapeutic utility (5) .",

Plasma sACE2 activity was stratified by quartiles. Increasing sACE2 activity was strongly correlated with a diagnosis of HF, irrespective of etiology, and was not associated with any other disease state ( Table 2 ). The odds ratio of predicting HF with sACE2 values above the fourth quartile was 4.8 (2.0 to 11.9, p = 0.0002, Fisher exact test). Soluble ACE2 activity also was associated with a worsening LVEF, increasing BNP levels, and use of loop diuretics ( Table 2 ). The association between sACE2 activity and aldosterone antagonists was more clearly demonstrated by the use of a direct comparison (sACE2 ng/ml, 95% confidence interval [absence vs. presence of aldosterone antagonists]: 29.6 [26.2 to 32.9] vs. 39.3 [34.0 to 44.7], p = 0.0025, analysis of variance). In logistic regression analysis, sACE2 activity was independently associated with the presence of HF (Table 3) .",

            "text": "One of the most intriguing questions our study raises is what role ACE2 plays in HF progression. Similar to its counterpart ACE, ACE2 is an integral membrane protein with a signal peptide and an N-terminal transmembrane domain. The presence of circulating ACE2 in plasma indicates either the cause or effect of an adaptive or maladaptive physiologic process operative in human HF. Unlike ACE, it is known that cleavage of membrane ACE2 into the soluble form is in part dependent on the tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 convertase ADAM17, a protease up-regulated in HF (9,10). Up-regulation of proinflammatory cytokines and activation of proteases during HF has long been implicated as a pathologic mechanism of cardiac remodeling (9, 11) . Therefore, cleavage of membrane ACE2 may be due to the up-regulation of a pathological protease, resulting in a relative decrease in local membrane ACE2 levels and cardiac dysfunction. Alternatively, cleavage and release of membrane ACE2 as a soluble form may offer a compensatory mechanism in HF. Angiotensin 1-7 has a very short half-life (<9 s), and release of sACE2 from the vascular endothelium may serve to alter systemic Ang(1-7) concentrations and the relative peripheral balance of ACE2/ACE. By demonstrating the relationship between greater levels of sACE2 activity and HF, these data give us insights into the systemic activation of an endogenous counterregulatory pathway beyond its membrane-bound confinements.",

Aldosterone decreases ACE2 transcription through a nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate oxidasemediated pathway (12) . It is therefore interesting to observe the direct correlation between the use of aldosterone receptor antagonists and greater sACE2 activity, which is consistent with the observation of increased ACE2 production from patients treated with spironolactone, indicating a potential mechanism of their beneficial effects (12) . Stimulation through the AT-1 receptor is also known to suppress ACE2 expression (13) . However, unlike animal studies, patients in our study were exposed to long-term inhibition of the RAAS, which might account for the lack of association between plasma sACE2 and the use of either ACE inhibitors or Ang receptor blockers.",
