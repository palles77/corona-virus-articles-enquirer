A negative CPV ELISA test cannot therefore reliably exclude a diagnosis of FPV. It is important to remember that recent immunization for feline panleukopenia can result in positive results on fecal ELISA tests for up to 2 weeks, so results should be interpreted with caution in a recently vaccinated patient. 2 Serology, using virus neutralizing antibodies, is regarded as the most reliable way to confirm FPV infection; a 4-fold increase in titers taken 2 weeks apart is diagnostic. 1 Aggressive supportive care, along with broad-spectrum antibiotic coverage, is the only therapy for affected cats. Those that survive the first week will usually recover, but a full return to health may take several weeks. Life-long immunity occurs after natural infection.",

Although several species have been identified in both asymptomatic and diarrheic cats, C. jejuni is the organism most often associated with clinical disease. 5 The severity of diarrhea in infected cats seems to be dependent on several factors, including the infective dose, the level of protective antibodies, and the presence of other intestinal pathogens. 6 Clinical signs are most likely in animals less than 6 months of age, and usually consist of mucoid diarrhea, often with fresh blood. Diagnosis in the hospital setting is difficult, because phase-contrast microscopy is needed to identify the motile, curved bacteria. Routine fecal cytology with Gram staining may reveal the gull wing-shaped rods, but many other organisms (eg, Helicobacter) have a similar appearance. Culture of fresh feces remains the most reliable way to establish a diagnosis. The organism is quite hardy both at room temperatures and when refrigerated, so transportation to a laboratory is certainly feasible. Anaerobic swabs should be used, because the organism is microaerophilic. Also, special culture methods enhance the likelihood of successful growth, so the laboratory should be informed ahead of time if Campylobacter is suspected.",

Fecal cytology may reveal numerous spores, which are certainly supportive of the diagnosis, but it is important to remember that large numbers of endospores have been reported in the stools of healthy cats (Fig 1) . In dogs, no association has been found between fecal endospore counts and the presence of Clostridial enterotoxins. 9 Various assays for detection of enterotoxins are presently available, but some questions have arisen about their specificity. 10 Most commercial laboratories offer a human-based ELISA test; a positive test result certainly supports the diagnosis, but a negative result does not exclude it.",

The cystic form (Fig 3) is most readily detected by the zinc sulfate flotation method, but it is important to remember that clinical signs may occur 1 to 2 days before cysts appear in the feces. Fecal Giardia antigens can be detected with commercially available ELISA kits (eg, SNAP Giardia test, Idexx Laboratories Inc., Westbrook, MA, USA; and ProSpecT Giardia Rapid Assay, Alexon Inc., Sunnyvale, CA, USA). These have not been extensively validated in cats, but seem to have similar sensitivity and specificity to zinc sulfate flotation methods. 14 Some commercial laboratories use direct immunofluorescence assays to detect Giardia cysts; feces should be preserved in formalin before shipping to maximize accuracy. PCR methods are probably the most sensitive way to detect infection, but are not widely available. 15 Several drugs have shown efficacy against Giardia, but none are currently approved for this use in cats. Although metronidazole has been widely used in this context, recent studies have indicated poor efficacy, likely because of parasitic resistance. 12 The current treatment of choice is fenbendazole, at 25 mg/kg by mouth every 12 hours for 5 days. Albendazole is equally efficacious, but is associated with an idiosyncratic myelotoxicity in cats and should be avoided. A recent study of experimentally infected kittens reported that a combination of febantel, pyrantel, and praziquantel (Drontal Plus, Bayer Animal Health, Shawnee Mission, KS, USA) decreased fecal shedding (based on immunofluorescence assay testing). However, few cats in the treatment group had diarrhea, so the clinical usefulness of this protocol needs further investigation. 16 Treatment must be accompanied by thorough efforts to control environmental contamination, because re-infection is otherwise likely. Steam cleaning or disinfection with quaternary ammonium products is recommended, followed by a drying out period of several days.

It is easy to mistake tritrichomonads for Giardia trophozoites, but closer inspection reveals a distinctive undulating membrane along the entire body (Fig 4) . Their motility patterns are also different, with a jerkier, axial motion noted with Tritrichomonas foetus. If a direct fecal smear is negative, the organism may be cultured with a commercially prepared medium and container (InPouch TF-Feline, Biomed Diagnostics, White City, OR, USA). This can be easily performed in the clinic with a peppercorn-sized stool sample. The pouch is kept at room temperature and is examined under the microscope every day for evidence of the motile trophozoites (Fig 5) . It can take up to a week for the organism to be evident. A more expensive, but more sensitive, method for confirming infection is fecal PCR. This test is performed at North Carolina Treatment of Tritrichomonas foetus has historically been problematic. Many cats will transiently improve with a range of different antibiotics, but then relapse soon afterward. Consistent and sustained clinical improvements have been documented with oral ranidazole (30-50 mg/kg by mouth every 12 hours), and negative posttreatment fecal PCR tests have been reported. 19 This drug is presently the treatment of choice, but is not currently licensed for this use in cats and must be obtained from a compounding pharmacy. Ronidazole has been associated with a reversible neurotoxicity, similar to that reported with metronidazole, and characterized by cerebellar signs. 20 Many cats seem to improve without treatment as they get older, and spontaneous resolution of diarrhea often occurs within 2 years. However, many of these cats remain positive on fecal PCR testing, suggesting that a chronic, asymptomatic carrier state occurs. 21 Cryptosporidium parvum Cryptosporidium parvum is a coccidial protozoan. Several genotypes of Cryptosporidium have been identified, but C. parvum is most often associated with clinical disease in cats.

Trophozoites lose their motility and become unrecognizable after short periods outside the host, so this examination really needs to be performed in the clinic. If a flotation study cannot be performed immediately, it is acceptable to refrigerate the sample. Cysts, oocysts, and helminth ova are generally hardy, and can survive several days of careful storage. If samples are shipped elsewhere for microscopic examination, a preservative should be used; formalin or commercially available products such as Proto-Fix (AlphaTec Systems, Inc., Vancouver, WA, USA) and Ecofix (Meridian Diagnostics, Inc., Cincinnati, OH, USA) are appropriate choices.
