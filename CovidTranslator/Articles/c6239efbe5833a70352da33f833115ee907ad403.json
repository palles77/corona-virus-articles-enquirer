The influenza A (H1N1) 2009 monovalent vaccine (H1N1 vaccine) became available in the U.S. in October 2009. Purpose: To assess 2009 H1N1 and seasonal influenza vaccination coverage and identify factors independently associated with vaccination among HCP in the U.S. Methods: Data from the 2009 -2010 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) influenza supplemental survey were analyzed in 2011. Multivariable logistic regression and predictive marginal models were performed to identify factors independently associated with vaccination among HCP. The Kaplan-Meier survival analysis procedure was used to estimate the cumulative proportion of people vaccinated.",

H1N1 vaccination coverage among HCP was higher among those who reported being male, having higher education, having higher income, being married, having access to a primary care physician, formerly or never smoking, and having health insurance. Additionally, people who needed to see a doctor but could not, and those who had not had a routine checkup within the past 1 year were less likely to be vaccinated (Table 1) . Factors associated with seasonal and any-dose vaccinations were similar to factors associated with H1N1 vaccination. Adjusted coverage estimates from the multivariable model did not differ greatly from the crude vaccination coverage. Overall, factors independently associated with H1N1, seasonal, and any-dose vaccinations were similar.

Vaccine unavailability at the time of epidemic activity may have contributed to the low H1N1 vaccination coverage. 7, [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] One study 22 showed that 17.3% of unvaccinated HCP listed unavailability of 2009 H1N1 vaccine as a reason for nonvaccination. 15 In addition, not all healthcare settings offered worksite influenza vaccination. Worksite vaccination could signif\u0131cantly increase seasonal and H1N1 vaccination coverage among HCP, but one study 22 showed that one third of healthcare settings did not offer on-site vaccination for HCP.",

            "text": "Vaccination coverage among HCP for H1N1 and seasonal influenza varied widely by state. Variation by state in vaccination coverage among the general adult population also has been observed. 23 Factors that may have contributed to the wide variation in vaccination coverage include the following: epidemic activity had virtually declined or disappeared in many southern states when vaccine became available, whereas it was still ongoing in many northern states 18 -20 ; wide variations in state-specif\u0131c vaccination program and pandemic planning preparation: states that were well prepared for a pandemic may have found it easier to implement vaccination programs on very short notice 24 ; and differences in the effectiveness of specif\u0131c intervention programs being implemented by states (i.e., commu-nity campaigns, provider-based strategies, and workplace vaccination). 24, 25 Influenza vaccination among HCP legislation also may influence vaccination coverage. During the time of the pandemic, eight states had influenza vaccination legislation requirements among HCP, either to offer (seven states) or ensure vaccination (one state). 26 Of those eight states, six had influenza vaccination coverage among HCP that was higher than the national average, which may indicate that legislation requirements help increase vaccination coverage. Vaccination coverage among HCP may be further increased when more states recommend or require influenza vaccination for HCP. In the current study, vaccination coverage was found to be higher among HCP who have a regular physician and have visited a physician for a routine checkup within 1 year than among those who did not. Physician contacts play an important role in vaccination uptake. 13, 14 HCP may have more-frequent contacts than do non-HCPs with their healthcare providers. Routine physician visits can provide important opportunities for providers to vaccinate HCP. The current study found that race/ethnicity, income, highrisk conditions status, and health insurance status were also independently associated with vaccination. Those f\u0131ndings concurred with those of previous studies. 13, 14 Studies showed that 2009 H1N1 vaccination coverage among HCP in other countries was 18% in Italy and 22% in Spain. Coverage among HCP was 92% in South Korea and 79% in Thailand. [27] [28] [29] [30] There are likely factors that contribute to higher coverage. A well-prepared vaccination plan with strong support from hospital administrators, free vaccine, and well-distributed H1N1 pandemic information may have contributed to the higher vaccination coverage among HCP in South Korea and Thailand. 29, 30 In addition, Thailand was a SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) epicenter and has been dealing with H5N1 (avian influenza) outbreaks. [31] [32] [33] This past experience probably increased support for pandemic planning and implementation.",

First, BRFSS is a landline, telephone-based survey that excludes people without telephones and those with only cellular phones and thus may produce a biased coverage estimate 34 ; however, weight was adjusted to account for people without landline telephones and people with cell phone only. 8, 34 Second, vaccination status is self-reported and is subject to recall bias. However, self-reported influenza vaccination status has been shown to have relatively high agreement with medical records among older adults. [35] [36] [37] Comprehensive strategies are needed to further improve uptake of vaccination coverage for HCP. Recommended approaches include emphasizing the benef\u0131ts of HCP vaccination for staff and patients; considering the level of vaccination coverage among HCP to be one measure of patient safety and quality assurance; electronic tracking of coverage levels by ward, unit, and occupation; providing vaccinations in the workplace so they are easily accessible; and implementing catch-up vaccination programs for HCP who are already employed and ensuring that newly hired HCP receive necessary vaccinations. 2 ",
