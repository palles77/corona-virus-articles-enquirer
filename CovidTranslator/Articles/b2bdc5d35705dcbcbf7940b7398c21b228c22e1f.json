            "text": "Group A rotaviruses (RVAs) are one of the 8 rotavirus species recognized in the Reoviridae family , and are responsible for severe gastroenteritis, primarily in children <5 years of age as well as the young of many mammalian species (Estes and Kapikian, 2007; Gentsch et al., 2005) . In humans, RVA infections result in G9 group A rotaviruses (RVAs) are considered important pathogens in pigs and humans, and pigs are hypothesized to be a potential host reservoir for human. However, intestinal and extra-intestinal pathogenicity and viremia of porcine G9 RVAs has remained largely unreported. In this study, colostrum-deprived piglets were orally infected with a porcine G9P[23] or G9P[7] strain. Histopathologically, both strains induced characteristic small intestinal lesions. Degeneration and necrosis of parenchymal cells were observed in the extra-intestinal tissues, but most predominantly in the mesenteric lymph nodes (MLNs). RVA antigen was continuously detected in the small intestinal mucosa and MLNs, but only transiently in cells of the liver, lung, and choroid plexus. Viral RNA levels were much higher in the feces and the MLNs compared to other tissues. The onset of viremia occurred at day post infection (DPI) 1 with the amount of viral RNA reaching its peak at DPI 3 or 5, before decreasing significantly at DPI 7 and remaining detectable until DPI 14. Our data suggest that porcine G9 RVAs have a strong small intestinal tropism, are highly virulent for piglets, have the ability to escape the small intestine, spread systemically via viremia, and replicate in extra-intestinal tissues. In addition, MLNs might act as a secondary site for viral amplification and the portal of systemic entry. These results add to our understanding of the pathogenesis of human G9 RVAs, and the validity of the pig model for use with both human and pig G9 RVAs in further studies.",

            "text": "the death of 453,000 infants and young children each year, mostly in developing countries (Tate et al., 2012) . The genome of RVA consists of 11 segments of double-stranded RNA enclosed in a triple layered particle (Estes and Kapikian, 2007) . Most segments encode a single polypeptide, allowing the virus to express six structural (VP1-VP4, VP6, and VP7) and five or six nonstructural proteins (NSP1-NSP6) (Estes and Kapikian, 2007) . Recently, a classification system encompassing all 11 genome segments was developed using nucleotide cut-off values and phylogenetic analyses. The notation Gx-P[x]-Ix-Rx-Cx-Mx-Ax-Nx-Tx-Ex-Hx is used for the VP7-VP4-VP6-VP1-VP2-VP3-NSP1-NSP2-NSP3-NSP4-NSP5/6 encoding gene segments, respectively (Matthijnssens et al., 2008a,b) . This system offers international standardization to analyze RVA interspecies evolutionary relationships, gene reassortment events, functional gene linkage in reassortant progeny, emergence of new RVA strains, RVA host range restriction, and virulence (Matthijnssens et al., 2008a,b) . Porcine RVA strains are highly divergent, and multiple Ggenotypes (G1-G6, G8-G12, G26) and P-genotypes (P (Collins et al., 2010; Martella et al., 2010) . Complete genome analyses have revealed that several virus gene segments typically found in pig RVA strains and Wa-like human RVA strains have a common ancestor (Matthijnssens et al., 2008a) . Porcine RVAs are considered important pathogens due to their economic impact on the pig industry and are a significant reservoir for human RVAs (Kim et al., 2010; Matthijnssens et al., 2008a Matthijnssens et al., , 2010b Zeller et al., 2012) . G9 RVA strains have so far been detected only in pigs and humans, and pigs are hypothesized to be a potential reservoir for human G9 RVAs (Mascarenhas et al., 2007; Matthijnssens et al., 2010a) . Since G9 RVAs were first detected in diarrhoeal samples of children in C\u00f3 rdoba, Argentina, and in Washington State during 1980, G9 RVA strains belonging to lineage 3 have now spread throughout the world and are now recognized as the fifth most globally important human genotype (Barril et al., 2006; Cao et al., 2008; Matthijnssens et al., 2010a; Phan et al., 2007; Santos and Hoshino, 2005) . These lineage 3 human G9 RVA strains have been shown to be both phylogenetically and antigenically related to one the first described porcine G9 RVA strains A2 . In South Korean pigs, the G9 genotype in combination with the P[7] and P[23] genotypes has been isolated and identified as the third most important genotype after G5P[7] and G8P[7] (Kim et al., 2010) . Most recently, full-length genomic analysis of porcine G9P [23] and G9P[7] RVAs revealed that these porcine G9 RVAs possess typical porcine genotype constellations: G9-P[23]/ P[7]-I5-R1-C1-M1-A8-N1-T1-E1-H1 (Kim et al., 2012a) . This report provided basic genetic information of G9 RVA strains, which are increasing in prevalence and are important in both humans and pigs.",

However, accumulating evidence suggests that RVA escapes the gastrointestinal tract and spreads to the extra-intestinal organs in both human and animals. For example, RVA antigen and viral RNA have been detected in serum samples from children with RVA diarrhea, indicating that antigenemia and possibly viremia could occur during RVA infection (Blutt et al., 2003; Chiappini et al., 2005; Fischer et al., 2005) . In children who died during RVA infection, RVA antigens and viral RNA were detected in the extraintestinal organs and tissues including the central nervous system, liver, lung, spleen, heart, kidney, testis, and bladder (Blutt and Conner, 2007; Lynch et al., 2001; Pager et al., 2000; Ramig, 2004; Riepenhoff-Talty et al., 1996; Zheng et al., 1991) . It has been clearly demonstrated that RVAs cause not only gastrointestinal but also systemic infections in experimental animal models (Ciarlet et al., 2002; Crawford et al., 2006; Fenaux et al., 2006; Kim et al., 2011 Kim et al., , 2012b Petersen et al., 1998) .",

RVA antigen was detected in a few epithelial cells and lymphoid cells from DPI 3 to DPI 7 in the choroid plexus from piglets inoculated with both strains, but not from either inactivated virus-or mockinoculated piglets (Figs. 4L and 5L, Tables 5 and 6 ). 3.5. Quantification of RVA RNA in the feces, nasal swabs, blood, and extra-intestinal organs and tissues SYBR Green real-time RT-PCR assays were performed to evaluate the viral RNA copy numbers in the feces, blood, MLN, liver, lung, choroid plexus, and nasal swab sampled from G9 RVA-inoculated piglets. As expected, viral RNA was not detected in these specimens sampled from either inactivated virus-or mock-inoculated piglets.",

            "text": "RVA can infect and cause clinical disease in humans and a wide range of animal species (Estes and Kapikian, 2007) . As a common disease in humans and animals, transmission of RVA from one species to another may occur and leads to public health concerns, particularly in developing countries, where humans and animals often live in close proximity and mixed infections are rather common (Jain et al., 2001; Leite et al., 1996; Timenetsky et al., 1994; Unicomb et al., 1999) . To date, the G9 RVA strains have only been detected in humans and pigs, and pigs are hypothesized to be a potential reservoir for human G9 RVAs (Collins et al., 2010; Mascarenhas et al., 2007; Matthijnssens et al., 2010a) . G9 RVAs can be classified phylogenetically into I-VI lineages, with lineage I-II consisting of strains isolated in the 1980s, and III-VI composing of strains isolated from the mid-1990s (Phan et al., 2007) . Of these, lineages III and VI were found in both humans and pigs (Phan et al., 2007) . Interestingly, human lineage 3 G9 RVA strains were previously shown to be both phylogentically and antigenically related to the first described porcine G9 RVA strain A2 . Both porcine G9 RVA strains used in this study clustered in lineage VI of known porcine and human G9 RVAs. Moreover, these strains possessed the following porcine/human Wa-like genotypes: R1-C1-M1-N1-T1-E1-H1 plus porcine specific genotypes P[7]/P[23]-I5-A8 (Kim et al., 2012a) . However, these porcine specific genotypes have been detected in humans and other species as well, most likely as a result of interspecies transmission (Ghosh et al., 2012; Varghese et al., 2004; Zeller et al., 2012) . In addition, the human reference strain Wa replicates in experimental pigs, resulting in diarrhea and intestinal pathology (Azevedo et al., 2005) . These findings may indicate that G9 RVAs with a (partially) Walike genotype constellation are capable to cause successful interspecies transmissions at least between humans and pigs. Therefore, it is important to determine whether G9 bearing RVAs can induce typical RVA-associated disease in animal models. In the present study, we have demonstrated that both porcine G9 RVA strains induced typical RVA-associated disease, including diarrhea, histopathological changes in intestinal and extra-intestinal organs or tissues, and viremia in experimentally infected piglets. Our results provide a new perspective on the pathogenesis of G9 RVAs in a pig model, confirming that like other human and animal RVAs, intestinal and extra-intestinal tropisms and viremia can be induced in an animal RVA disease model. To our knowledge, this study is the first to describe the intestinal and extra-intestinal pathogenicity of G9 bearing RVAs in an experimental pig model. Our data will also contribute to increased understanding of infection, pathology, disease, immunity, and testing of prospective vaccines and drugs against both human and animal G9 RVAs.",

Replication of both G9 strains occurred most efficiently in the intestine because the viral RNA copy numbers in the fecal samples were $25-fold greater than that seen in the next most prominent site, the MLN, and $660-fold greater than that found in other organs at DPI 3. It has also been shown that the number of antigen positive cells was the highest in the small intestinal villi. In addition, the high intestinal lesion scores at DPI 14 (after the disappearance of diarrhea) were due to sustained strong crypt hyperplasia, resulting in low villi versus crypt ratios. It is important to note that, since the intestinal samples were taken from only one or two experimental piglets sacrificed on any given day, further studies will be needed to increase the number of experimental piglets to obtain more robust statistical data. However, overall these combined data indicate that both G9P[23]/P[7] strains display a strong intestinal tropism and virulence in piglets.",

The ability of RVA to infect certain lymphocyte subsets or to be taken by antigen-presenting cells in the gut-associated lymphoid tissue could indicate a potential route of viral spread from the intestine to other organs (Fenaux et al., 2006) . In the present study, antigen-positive lymphoid cells were detected in the lamina propria of the villi in the piglets infected with either G9P [23] or G9P[7] , supporting the role of cell-associated viremia. Moreover, MLNs were shown to be the second most susceptible tissues with high antigen and viral RNA loads in the lymphoid cells of animals infected with both strains throughout the experiment. Histopathologically, MLNs showed lymphoid cell necrosis and deficiency, resulting from RVA replication. Therefore, it could be argued that MLNs act as a secondary amplifier and a portal of systemic entry through either the lymphatic network or the blood (Brown and Offit, 1998; Fenaux et al., 2006; Mossel and Ramig, 2003) . In addition, it was reported that cell-free viremia rather than cell-associated viremia via the bloodstream seems to be major path of viral spread in a mouse model (Fenaux et al., 2006) . At this stage however, it is important to note that we cannot determine whether RVA antigens detected in the lymphoid cells were due to authentic RVA replication in the lymphoid cells or simply represent antigen taken up by the B lymphocytes to process the antigen. As an additional minor point of caution, it should be noted that the pathological, virological, and immunological events of RVA infections in the porcine and mouse models may be different and could also be distinct from what occurs in humans.",

However, there is now growing evidence that extra-intestinal replication and lesions associated with RVA infections can occur in humans and animals (Blutt et al., 2003 : Ciarlet et al., 2002 Crawford et al., 2006; Fenaux et al., 2006) . As mentioned above, both G9P[23] and G9P[7] RVA strains caused small intestinal pathology and viremia in the experimental piglets, which can mediate RVA spread to extra-intestinal organs or tissues. Therefore, we assessed where and when RVA antigen and RNA was present outside the small intestine and how many viral RNA copies could be found at various sites. Antigen-positive cells of both strains were detected in many more cells of the MLN than those of the liver, lung, and choroid plexus. The viral RNA loads also reached a peak during this period, which was 0 to 3 logs lower than the viral load in MLN and feces. From these findings, it could be concluded that porcine G9 RVA can replicate, albeit to a limited extent, in the extraintestinal organs including the MLN, liver, lung, and choroid plexus. These results are consistent with other studies that indicate the ability of G9 RVA virions to spread to the blood and to substantially extend to the extraintestinal organs (Blutt et al., 2003; Ciarlet et al., 2002; Crawford et al., 2006; Fenaux et al., 2006; Kim et al., 2011) . In addition, our results indicated that although porcine G9 strains infected and replicated in the extra-intestinal organs or tissues, the severity of RVA-associated lesions in these organs and tissues was lesser than that of small intestine and MLN.",

            "text": "It should be noted that these RVA-associated lesions in these extra-intestinal organs and tissues can induce more serious diseases when complicated with other pathogens or diseases. For example, many viral pathogens such as influenza virus, porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus, porcine respiratory coronavirus and porcine circovirus type 2 play crucial role as a primary pathogen for developing porcine respiratory disease complex (PRDC), which is one of the most important diseases in the pig industry (Brockmeier et al., 2002) . These viral pathogens injure the ciliated or pulmonary epithelium of the respiratory tract, cause damage to the function of pulmonary macrophages, and alter immunomodulatory effects. The suppressed defense mechanisms of the respiratory tract facilitate secondary bacterial infection with Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae, Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae, and Pasteurella mutocida, resulting in PRDC. In this study, both RVA strains injured alveolar epithelium, resulting in interstitial pneumonia. Thus, it can be speculated that RVA can act as a primary pathogen to alter the defense mechanisms of the respiratory tract, to facilitate the secondary bacterial infection and finally to evoke PRDC. Further study should address whether RVA infection can induce PRDC when complicated with secondary bacterial infection.",

Both porcine G9 RVA strains share the ability to escape the small intestine, spread systemically via viremia, and replicate in extra-intestinal organs and tissues. Our data indicate that MLNs may play a critical role in RVA escape from the small intestine by providing a site for substantial and prolonged secondary viral replication before extending to extra-intestinal organs and tissues. A detailed understanding of the mechanisms that determine intestinal and extra-intestinal pathogenicity, combined with the availability of effective preventive and therapeutic measures, is critical for the control of RVA infection. However, to date, animal models to understand pathogenesis of porcine and human G9 RVAs have not established. Therefore, we expect that the present results could contribute to our understanding of the pathogenesis of human G9 RVAs, and pig model with porcine G9 strains could be suitable for evaluating not only the efficacy of vaccines but also anti-viral drug candidates of both these important pathogens.",
