They classified households as being \"well prepared\" for an emergency based on possession or affirmation of nine of fourteen \"indicators\" in a standard checklist. Fewer than 10% of households were considered \"well prepared,\" while many professed ignorance or lack of interest in preparedness. Preparedness was associated with participation in emergency training and knowledge, and was negatively associated with reliance on external rescuers as well as a fatalistic outlook.",

A figure was added describing the percentage of households preparing the 14 essential emergency items (Figure 1 ). The majority of households owned 5 emergency items. About 10% owned over 9 emergency items. Although the 14 items are not equally important, their importance varies with different emergency events. This makes it difficult to attach a fixed weight to each item in terms of their importance. For example, in a fire emergency, \"escape rope\" and \"gas mask\" are more important than having food and water. But this is not necessarily the case in an event when the survivors are isolated from the outside world. Therefore, we did not differentiate the importance of the emergency items.
