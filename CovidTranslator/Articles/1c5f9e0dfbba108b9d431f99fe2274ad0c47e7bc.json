            "text": "Germline variation at immunoglobulin (IG) loci is critical for pathogen-mediated immunity, but establishing complete haplotype sequences in these regions has been problematic because of complex sequence architecture and diploid source DNA. We sequenced BAC clones from the effectively haploid human hydatidiform mole cell line, CHM1htert, across the light chain IG loci, kappa (IGK) and lambda (IGL), creating single haplotype representations of these regions. The IGL haplotype generated here is 1.25 Mb of contiguous sequence, including four novel V alleles and one novel C allele and an 11.9 kb insertion. The CH17 IGK haplotype consists of two 644 kb proximal and 466 kb distal contigs separated by a large gap of unknown size; these assemblies added 49 kb of unique sequence extending into this gap. Our analysis also resulted in the characterization of seven novel IGKV alleles and a 16.7 kb region exhibiting signatures of interlocus sequence exchange between distal and proximal IGKV gene clusters. Genetic diversity in IGK/IGL was compared to that of the IG heavy chain (IGH) locus within the same haploid genome, revealing 3-fold (IGK) and 6-fold (IGL) higher diversity in the IGH locus, potentially associated with increased levels of segmental duplication and the telomeric location of IGH.",

            "text": "Introduction Immunoglobulins (IG) or antibodies are essential components of the adaptive immune system that play key roles in processes associated with innate and adaptive immunity. They are expressed by B cells as either cell surface receptors or secreted proteins, and are formed by two pairs of identical \"heavy\" and \"light\" kappa or lamda protein chains, encoded by genes located at three major loci in the human genome: the IG heavy (IGH) at 14q32.33, and the IG light lambda (IGL) and kappa (IGK) loci, located at 22q11.2 and 2p11.2, respectively (1) . Specifically, through a unique mechanism referred to as V-(D)-J rearrangement (2) , individual Variable (V), Diversity (D), and Joining (J) genes at the IGH locus, and V and J genes at either the IGK or IGL loci rearrange somatically at the DNA level to generate V-D-J and V-J regions that, after transcription and translation, encode the variable domains of the antibody (1) . V-(D)-J rearrangement is accompanied by the random addition and deletion of nucleotides at the junctions of the combined V, D, and J genes by terminal deoxynucleotide transferase (TdT). The extreme variability observed in expressed antigen-na\u00efve B cell antibody repertoires is due to this combinatorial and junctional diversity, and partly ensures that the immune system is able to recognize and mount effective immune responses against a diverse range of potential pathogens. At the population and species level, IG haplotype and allelic variation also make important contributions to the diversity of expressed antibody repertoires (3) (4) (5) (6) ; however, the roles of IG genetic polymorphism in antibody function have not been comprehensively investigated (7) .",

Importantly, not only has IG genetic diversity recently been implicated in inter-individual variation in expressed antibody repertoires (3) (4) (5) , but genetic variants in both IG coding regions, as well as recombination signals (RSs) and regulatory sequences are also known to influence antibody expression and function, and mediate risk of disease phenotypes (9) (10) (11) . However, our understanding of germline variability at the IGH, IGK, and IGL loci remains severely limited, especially in terms of haplotype structure (i.e., large segmental duplications and deletions) as well as coding and non-coding sequence polymorphisms. We have begun to uncover this variability in the IGH locus, leading to complete nucleotide resolution descriptions of large structural variants (insertions, deletions, duplications, and complex rearrangements), including novel functional IGHV genes and alleles (6) .",

The IGL locus (22q11.2) was initially mapped (12) (13) (14) and fully sequenced and analyzed once in its entirety from multiple cosmid and BAC library resources (NG_000002.1) (15) . The locus spans approximately 0.9 Mb, and includes 69 IGLV, seven IGLJ, and seven IGLC genes; IG gene alleles are designated as functional (F), open reading frame (ORF), or pseudogenes based on established criteria (1, 16) . Additional IGLV, IGLJ, and IGLC genes not present in this haplotype are known to occur as insertion variants in the human population (1, (17) (18) (19) . Similarly, the initial mapping (20) (21) (22) and sequencing of the IGK locus (2p11.2) was done using a composite of cosmid, bacteriophage, and BAC clone libraries (23) . A unique feature of the IGK locus is that it includes two large inverted segmental duplications (SDs) that comprise distinct V genes (termed proximal and distal); these regions remain separated by a large, currently unsequenced, assembly gap. The proximal region spans 0.54 Mb (NG_000834.1) and includes 69 IGKV functional/ORF genes and pseudogenes, whereas the distal region (NG_000833.1) spans 0.43 Mb and includes 62 V genes and pseudogenes (distal V genes are denoted by a \"D\"; e.g., , five functional IGKJ genes, and a single functional IGKC gene reside downstream of the proximal V gene cluster (1) . Additional BAC clones from the RPCI-11 library spanning the IGK proximal region and a portion of the distal region have also been sequenced (24) . Both IGL and IGK are known to exhibit V, J, and C gene allelic and structural variation (1, (17) (18) (19) (25) (26) (27) .",

A hydatidiform mole occurs when a sperm fertilizes an enucleated egg. The paternal DNA is then doubled resulting in an effectively haploid genome. DNA resources from this material are thus ideal for resolving sequence assemblies in structurally complex genomic regions. Together with data produced previously for the IGH locus from the CH17 library (6), assemblies generated here for the IGK and IGL gene clusters represent the first complete haplotypes of all three IG loci from a single human. Using these data, we have conducted the first comparison of genetic diversity between the three IG regions in the same haploid genome. Our analyses have facilitated the identification of novel single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within IGL and IGK gene coding regions, V gene recombination signal (RS) sequences and regulatory elements, and also revealed evidence for a novel large sequence conversion event between the IGKV proximal and distal regions. In addition, our three-locus comparison shows a striking enrichment of structural and nucleotide diversity in the IGH locus, confirming previous suggestions that germline variation within the light chain gene loci is lower than that observed in IGH (18, 28, 29) .",

In total, we identified 37 of the 38 known functional/ORF IGLV genes, seven functional J genes, and four functional C genes. The remaining IGLV gene, IGLV5-39 was not found in CH17, consistent with it being an insertion polymorphism (1) , (18, 27) . Sequence comparisons within IGLV, IGLJ, and IGLC genes revealed allelic differences between CH17 and the existing IGL assembly (NG_000002.1) at six V genes, two J genes, and one C gene ( Figure 1 ; Supplementary Table 1 ). Six of these alleles, five of which were novel (IGLV6-57, IGLV11-55, IGLV5-48, IGLV5-45, and IGLC7), included amino acid changes. Notably, the novel allele identified at IGLV5-48 included a nonsense mutation that introduced a premature stop codon in the framework 3 region of the protein; 15 additional SNPs were also characterized within the exons of this gene. Prior to this study, only a single allele of IGLV5-48 had been described, classified as an ORF due to a single nucleotide difference in the heptamer of the recombination signal (V-RS TACAGTG instead of CACAGTG (30) ). SNPs characterized in the remaining four novel functional/ORF alleles were represented in the 1000 genomes project (1KG) dataset (31) . Previously described regulatory motifs and RS sequences (15) associated with each of the 37 identified functional/ORF IGLV genes were also inspected for previously uncharacterized variants in the CH17 haplotype, but no SNPs in these regions were identified.",

            "text": "Eight BAC clones were analyzed in the IGK locus, forming two independent contigs, one in the proximal region totalling 644 kb (GRCh37, chr2: 89027491-89630436), and a second in the distal region of the locus totalling 466 kb of contiguous sequence (GRCh37, chr2: 89841120-90308341; Figure 2 ). The proximal contig, containing four BACs, spanned from the intron of IGKV2-40 to 170 kb downstream of IGKC; thus, this contig lacked 10.9 kb of known sequence upstream of IGKV2-40 characterized in the initial genomic description of the locus (NG_000834.1), representing a small gap in the CH17 sequence. In the distal region, four complete BACs were assembled into a single contig spanning 22 kb upstream of the most distal gene IGKV3D-7 to 60 kb downstream of IGKV2D-40. This sequence included ~49 kb of additional sequence (compared to the originally sequenced distal cluster of IGK, NG_000833.1) extending into the assembly gap between the proximal and distal units, which is predicted to be 800 kb (23, 32) . The sequence extending into the unsequenced gap is dominated by complex repeats (Supplementary Figure 1) , likely contributing to the difficulty of completing assemblies in this IG gene cluster. Alleles at forty-four functional/ORF IGKV genes, 22 in each of the proximal and distal regions, as well as five IGKJ genes, and a single IGKC gene in the proximal region were characterized and compared to those found in the initial IGK assembly (NG_000834.1/NG_000833.1; Figure 2 ; Supplementary Table 2 ). To maintain consistency between IGL and IGK comparisons, for the analyses presented here we used IGK sequences initially generated by Kawasaki et al. (23) (NG_000834.1/NG_000833.1) because existing GRCh37 assemblies also included a mixture of clones from the RPCI-11 BAC library, and a single clone from CH17 (CH17-158B1). Based on alignments of CH17 sequence to NG_000834.1/ NG_000833.1, we observed ten allelic differences of IGKV genes, and one allelic variant of IGKJ2; ten of these alleles, including IGKJ2*04, involved amino acid changes. We characterized ten novel alleles that were not represented in IMGT, including three that were observed in NG_000834.1/NG_000833.1. In two instances, we observed the presence of alleles that had been previously classified as either \"distal\" or \"proximal\" alleles residing at loci in the alternate location. For example, we found a novel allele that matched with 100% sequence identity to IGKV1-13*02 at the IGKV1D-13 locus in the CH17 haplotype (this allele has been named IGKV1D-13*02). From our analysis of V-RS sequences, we found that in contrast to IGKV1D-13*01 in NG_000833.1, the allele in the CH17 haplotype at this locus was associated with a canonical, non-mutated V-heptamer sequence. Also, genomic descriptions of the gene IGKV1-8 have revealed a 21 bp deletion in an upstream regulatory element, which had been predicted to disrupt promoter function and inhibit expression (mutation observed in NG_000834.1(33)); however, IGKV1-8*01 has been shown to be expressed in some cases (documented in IMGT Gene tables (www.imgt.org) (34) . Potentially explaining this discrepancy, we found that the previously described IGKV1-8*01 21 bp promoter deletion was not present in the CH17 haplotype, suggesting that this germline indel variant could contribute to variation in the expression of alleles at this locus.",

Segmental duplications are known to facilitate sequence exchange via non-allelic homologous recombination and interlocus gene conversion (36, 37) ; however, given the lack of reference sequence data this has not been investigated in the IGK locus. To address this, we conducted pair-wise comparisons of distal and proximal regions from CH17 and NG_000834.1/ NG_000833.1 assemblies to search for large tracts of shared sequence ( Figure 3A ). The expectation is that sequences should be most similar between homologous regions of the NG_000834.1/NG_000833.1 and CH17 assemblies, whereas higher similarity between proximal and distal regions within a given assembly would suggest the potential occurrence of sequence exchange. Using this approach, we identified a large ~16.7 kb region that showed higher identity between the proximal and distal units of the NG_000834.1/ NG_000833.1 assemblies than between the CH17 distal and NG_000834.1 IGK proximal units ( Figure 3A ). This region included two IGKV genes for which we observed allelic variants between the NG_000834.1/NG_000833.1 assemblies and CH17 haplotypes. Fourway sequence alignments of this region show that the CH17 distal unit was most unique compared to the other three sequences ( Figure 3B ), providing evidence that distal and proximal units have undergone sequence exchange at some point in the past, making the distal unit more similar to the proximal unit in this region represented in the NG_000834.1/ NG_000833.1 assemblies. It is important to note, however, that the distal fragment of the initial assembly generated by Kawasaki et al. (23) (NG_000833.1) harbors many unique bp differences compared to the other three sequences (blue tick marks, Figure 3B ), which could be suggestive of the occurrence of mutation following the predicted sequence exchange event. Further analysis of this multi-sequence alignment using the Difference of Sums of Squares (DSS) method for recombination detection also predicted two potential flanking recombination breakpoints within the expected regions based on visual inspection of the sequence alignment and comparison of sequence similarities. We also analyzed sequence from two BAC clones in the proximal and distal clusters from the RPCI-11 BAC library (24) ; providing further support for this predicted event, this analysis revealed that these carried the same variants observed in the NG_000834.1/NG_000833.1 assemblies. An alternative explanation, although less parsimonious given the data presented, could be that this region of the IGKV distal cluster in the CH17 haplotype has undergone more rapid sequence divergence since the original duplication of the IGKV distal and proximal segments. The sequencing of additional haplotypes in the distal and proximal IGKV clusters will likely provide more insight into the mechanisms underlying these observed sequence signatures.",

This prompted us to also compare other genomic characteristics between the three loci. Excluding regions of structural variation between haplotypes/assemblies, we first generated SNP calls (not including gaps and single bp indels) between the CH17 and reference assemblies for all three loci; 519, 854, and 2897 SNPs were identified for IGKV, IGLV, and IGHV, respectively (Table 2; Figure 4 , left panel). After cross referencing these SNPs with dbSNP135 and 1KG datasets, 85, 103, and 407 SNPs in the IGKV, IGLV, and IGHV loci were determined to be novel variants, not represented in either dataset. Not surprisingly, given the number of SNPs in the 1KG datasets, fewer SNPs at each locus were represented in dbSNP ( Figure 4 ). We examined these sites in publicly available Illumina data generated from the CHM1 genomic DNA (39) to determine if the novel SNPs were supported by an orthogonal platform (see Materials and Methods). We identified 84/85, 96/103, and 406/407 sites in IGKV, IGLV, and IGHV, respectively, that are supported by the Illumina data. The discrepancies may represent sequencing errors. The novel SNPs for each region are reported in GRCh37 coordinates in Supplementary Table 3 .",

An analysis of genomic features in the three loci also showed that the fraction of each locus covered by repeat content was highest in IGHV, whereas that covered by SDs, not surprisingly was highest in IGKV (Table 2 ). However, when the primary SDs associated with the IGKV proximal/distal duplication event were excluded (i.e., we only included SD annotations corresponding to duplications occurring solely within either proximal or distal clusters, but not between the two), SD coverage in IGHV (37.7%) was found to be much higher than both of the light chain loci (IGLV, 24.6%; IGKV, 28.2%; Table 2 ). When only SDs exhibiting > 95% sequence identity were considered, this difference was even more striking (IGHV, 28.8%; IGLV, 12.9%; IGKV, 1.0%). Interestingly, in IGHV, SNP density was higher in regions of segmental duplication compared to regions not covered by SDs, especially true when considering only those regions covered by SDs with >95% sequence identity (Table 2) ; however, this difference was not found to be significant after permuting SD vs. non-SD region assignments and re-assessing SNP densities of 10,000 permutations using the Monte Carlo False Discovery Rate (MCFDR) method (40) (P > 0.05). SNP density was also increased in segmentally duplicated regions of IGKV with >95% sequence identity compared to regions not covered by SDs, but again, this difference was not significant after permutation (P > 0.05).",

We found that mean SNP densities were ~2-fold higher in telomeric regions (within 3 Mb = 0.001; 1 Mb = 0.0009) when compared to centromeric regions (within 3 Mb = 0.0005; 1 Mb = 0.0004; Supplementary Figure 2A) .

In contrast, when CHM1 SNP densities within 3 Mb of all telomeres were compared, the region on the q arm of chr14 (including both IGHV and non-IGHV sequence) no longer stands out, suggesting that IGHV may have some unique properties contributing to higher than average genetic diversity.

From the CH17 clones, 13 novel alleles were identified in the two loci, including four IGLV alleles, eight IGKV alleles, and one IGLC allele; an additional three IGKV alleles were also described from NG_000834.1/NG_000833.1 as part of our analysis. Two recent assessments of IGK alleles -one of a public dataset of 435 expressed sequences (42) , and a second of deep-sequenced antibody repertoires from four individuals (43)concluded that, unlike IGH, IGK allelic datasets are likely to be mostly complete, as only two putative novel alleles were identified from these analyses (42) . In contrast, IGHV sequencing in 10 individuals also supports these observations, finding that nearly 25% of characterized putative alleles were novel (44) . However, the fact that we identified 12 novel light chain V gene alleles from a single haploid genome implies that additional efforts to identify unreported alleles in IGL and IGK are warranted. Importantly, as noted previously in IGHV (6), SNPs associated with novel alleles identified in IGL and IGK were present in the 1KG dataset, further supporting the notion that the 1KG dataset could serve as a useful resource for future investigations of IG gene diversity and the identification of novel polymorphisms. However, given the prevalence of segmental duplication in the IG loci, it will undoubtedly be essential to consider the impact of paralogous sequence variants (PSVs) when assessing 1KG SNP data in these regions, as complex and duplicated sequence structure are known to confound SNP characterization (45, 46) .",

In both cases, RS and promoter sequence previously associated with alleles at these loci were predicted to inhibit their expression; however, the alleles described for these genes in the CH17 haplotype included variants that would be expected to exhibit normal gene expression. The importance of such polymorphisms is that they can result in variable levels of gene expression, including the loss of genes/alleles from expressed repertoires. In addition to those noted above, several other IGKV genes are also classified as ORF genes based on irregular RSs (34) . Notably, IGKV2D-29*02, previously referred to as \"A2c\", has a non-canonical V-heptamer, but has also been shown to occur in productive rearrangements. A third allele at the IGKV2D-29 locus, \"A2b\", has also been shown to have a defective RS V-heptamer, which results in decreased expression and has been implicated in susceptibility to Haemophilus influenzae type b infection (9, 47) .",

Our first observation from this comparison was that the number of V gene allelic differences among the CH17 haplotypes was highest in IGHV. This finding is perhaps not surprising given that allelic richness is also known to be highest in IGHV based on available genetic data in the IMGT/GENE-DB (35) and IMGT Allele Alignments (www.imgt.org). In addition, studies of substitution patterns in V genes have also revealed evidence for increased diversity in IGHV compared to IGLV and IGKV (29, 48) . Strikingly, however, when we extended our comparison to include all SNPs within the three loci, we found that locus-wide genetic diversity was also much higher in IGHV, indicating that increased diversity in this locus is not limited to within V gene coding regions. IGHV SNP density is also higher than that observed for killer cell immunoglobulinlike receptor/leukocyte Ig-like receptor and T cell receptor alpha loci, calculated at ~0.0016 for both loci (Meltz Steinberg et al., manuscript in preparation).",

In IGL, for example, only three insertion-deletion variants of functional genes have been identified, involving IGLV1-50, IGLV8-61, and IGLV5-39 (18, 27) ; however, the deletion of IGLV8-61 has been identified in only a single individual. Likewise, in the IGKV locus, aside from an identified rare haplotype containing a deletion of the entire distal IGKV gene cluster (49, 50) , only a single functional V gene insertion, including the gene IGKV1-NL1, has been identified (25) . Limited evidence suggesting putative IGKV gene duplications/deletions (e.g., IGKV1-5 and IGKV3-20) has also more recently been noted from expressed antibody repertoire data, although these await confirmation as germline polymorphisms (43) . Thus, in total, liberal estimates from the literature indicate that only 4-6 light chain functional/ORF V genes are known to occur in CNV, in stark contrast to ~29 in IGHV (6, 7) . In line with this difference, four V gene-containing CNV were identified in the CH17 IGHV haplotype compared to zero defined in IGLV and IGKV.",

            "text": "Two factors suggest that the higher rate of CNV in IGH may be attributable to the increased fraction of the locus covered by segmentally duplicated sequences. First, segmental duplications are known to be associated with SVs genome-wide (51) , and second, duplications have been shown specifically to facilitate structural variation in IGH (6) . Segmental duplications and tandem repeats also mediate sequence exchange either through gene conversion or recombination, that can either result in the homogenization of paralogous sequences (36, 37, 52) , or in an increase in genetic diversity (53, 54) . Illustrating the latter of these two scenarios, we found that for IGHV, SNP density was highest in regions including segmental duplications, particularly those with >95% sequence identity with their paralogs; similar trends were not noted for SNP density estimates calculated within non-SD repeat regions (Table 2 ). Importantly, SDs with >95% identity comprised nearly twice the fraction of IGHV sequence than IGLV sequence, which may in part explain the differences observed in SNP density between IGH and IGL. It is also worth noting that the difference in the fraction of SDs between IGH and the light chain regions would be greater if the 222 kb of novel sequence (comprised primarily of SDs) identified in IGH by our previous study (6) were also included. In addition to this, assessments of CHM1 SNP density across autosomal telomeres and centromeres revealed that the telomeric region on chr14 containing IGHV had both elevated levels of SNP diversity, and increased SD overlap, compared to analogous regions on other autosomes. This suggests that the genomic location of IGHV has also likely contributed to the increased genetic variation we observe in this locus compared to IGKV and IGLV.",

In comparison to the other two loci, we found IGKV to have the lowest locus-wide SNP density, nearly 6-fold lower than that observed in IGHV. Due to the large inverted duplication of the proximal and distal regions, over 80% of the IGKV locus consists of SDs with >95% sequence identity. This suggests that, unlike in IGHV, SDs may be responsible for sequence homogenization rather than an increase in SNP diversity. The fact that we found evidence of a large tract of sequence exchange between the proximal and distal IGKV units lends support to this notion. However, fully understanding the relationship between segmental duplication and SNP density in the human IG regions will undoubtedly require further sequencing and comparisons of additional haplotypes. We must also acknowledge the potential for confounding effects related to the use of mosaic reference sequences for this comparison (15, 23, 38) , which were generated from multiple large insert libraries constructed from diploid tissues from different individuals of different, or in some cases of unknown, ethnicity. However, because our findings are supported by existing V gene allelic variation data at the population level, it seems unlikely that the difference in variability between loci is due to the ethnic origin of the tissue.",

Given that SNP density within V gene coding regions in the CH17 haplotype was also higher in IGH compared to IGL and IGK, it could be speculated that mechanisms associated with an increased number of polymorphisms locus-wide in IGHV, could by default, result in greater IGHV gene diversity and a more variable expressed antibody repertoire. Intriguingly, in natural antibodies, the IG heavy chains are considered to play a more prominent role in epitope binding than IG light chains, although this is primarily attributed to the third complementarity determining region (VH CDRH3) not encoded by IGHV genes (55) . However, there are several examples demonstrating essential functions of IGHV germline-encoded variation in antigen specificity; for example, amino acids encoded by germline IGHV1-69 alleles have been shown to make important contributions to neutralizing antibody responses against influenza, hepatitis C, and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (10, 56, 57) . A recent mapping effort in two rat disease models with differing susceptibility to spontaneous hypertension revealed that the IGH region exhibited the highest sequence divergence genome-wide between these lines (58) , consistent with the results observed here. Whether increased genetic diversity in human IGHV is associated with a dominant role of the heavy chain in antibody function remains to be seen.",

Sequences corresponding to each of the mapped V, J, and C genes were extracted from the CH17 contigs, and alleles at each locus were assigned using IMGT V-QUEST (62, 63) . \"Novel\" alleles were defined as those not found in the the IMGT reference directory of IMGT/V-QUEST (that contains all functional (F), open reading frame (ORF) and in-frame pseudogene (P) alleles from IMGT/ GENE-DB) (64) . To search for potential variants in previously characterized RS and regulatory sequences, SNPs determined from alignments of the CH17 haplotype and assemblies generated previously by Kawasaki et al. (15, 23) (NG_000834.1, IGK proximal; NG_000833.1. IGK distal; NG_000002.1, IGL) were tested for overlap with 250 bp regions immediately up and down stream of functional and ORF gene exons. Since the original assembly of IGK conducted by Kawasaki et al. (23) , several additional clones from the RPCI-11 BAC library and a single clone from CH17 have been integrated into the GRCh37 assembly of the distal V gene cluster. In this study, however, to maintain consistency between assembly sequence sources, only clones reported in Kawasaki et al. (23) for the IGK distal region were considered for comparison. Exon coordinates from GRCh37/hg19 as determined by Vega annotations for each gene were downloaded from UCSC (www.genome.ucsc.edu; see Supplemental Tables 1 and 2), and SNP/gene region overlap was assessed using BEDTools version 2.1 (65) . For those genes in which a SNP was found to occur within the defined regions, sequences in question from the CH17 and reference assemblies (NG_000834.1, IGK proximal; NG_000833.1. IGK distal; NG_000002.1, IGL) were aligned, visually inspected, and compared to previously identified motifs (1).",

Base pair differences were collated based on pair-wise global alignments made between the NG_000834.1 proximal sequence and NG_000833.1 distal sequence from Kawasaki et al. (23) , as well as proximal and distal sequences from the CH17 haplotype. Global alignments and variant calls were carried out using \"run-mummer3\" and \"combineMUMs\" commands in MUMmer3.0 (68) . A sequence similarity plot was then generated for each pair-wise comparison using 10 kb windows with a sliding size of 500 bp, as reported previously (23) . Sequences, ~22.5 kb in length, from the region suspected to harbor a potential recombination event between proximal and distal regions, were extracted from each haplotype (proximal and distal) and aligned using ClustalW (69) within ebioX (http://www.ebioinformatics.org/ebiox/). Recombination/gene conversion analysis based on this alignment was conducted using the DSS method within TOPALi v2 (70, 71) . This method is based on comparing the branching patterns of two trees constructed using the first and second halves of sequence alignments within a given window of a larger alignment being analyzed; the fit between these two trees and the calculation of DSS is measured using the sum of squares. Windows in which trees differ significantly between the two halves are scored with high DSS values, and are thus candidate sites for recombination. The parameters used here for this analysis were as follows: a window size of 2.5 kb with a step size of 100 bp; the Jukes-Cantor substitution model for calculating distance matrices; 500 bootstrap iterations to test for significance; and the analysis was conducted in both forward and reverse directions along the alignment.",

The upper panel shows the tiling path of sequenced CH17 BAC clones, with segmental duplication annotations depicted below. In the lower panel, functional and ORF IGL genes annotated in NG_0000002.1 and the CH17 haplotype are depicted by filled boxes, with corresponding locus and allele names located above and below the respective representation. Genes that are annotated as ORFs are denoted by green (V genes) or grey (J and C genes) boxes with a magenta outline. Shared genes and alleles between NG_0000002.1 and the CH17 haplotype are indicated by filled green or grey boxes. IGLV alleles that, in the CH17 haplotype, are different from those in NG_0000002.1 are indicated by boxes with other colors (red for non-synonymous and blue for synonymous allelic differences). IGLJ and IGLC allelic differences are denoted by the labelling of allele names on the CH17 haplotype. A filled purple circles denotes a novel allele in the CH17 haplotype with a polymorphism resulting in a nonsense mutation (pseudogene). All novel allele names are shown in bold. The 11 kb insertion in the CH17 IGL path is indicated. The upper panel shows the tiling path of sequenced CH17 BAC clones, with segmental duplication annotations depicted below. The previously sequenced BAC clone, CH17-158B1, is noted by an asterisk. In the lower panel, functional or ORF IGK genes annotated in the NG_000834.1 (proximal) and NG_000833.1 (distal) assemblies and CH17 are depicted by filled boxes, with corresponding locus and allele names located above and below the respective representation. Genes that are annotated as ORFs are denoted by green (V genes) or grey (J and C genes) boxes with a magenta outline. IGKV genes and alleles that are shared between NG_000834.1/NG_000833.1 assemblies and CH17 are indicated by filled green boxes. IGKV alleles that, in the CH17 haplotype, are different from those in the NG_000833.2 (distal) and NG_000834.1 (proximal) assemblies are indicated by boxes with other colors (red for non-synonymous and blue for synonymous). Filled blue circles denote loci at which proximal or distal alleles were observed at the alternate locus (e.g., proximal allele at distal locus); and orange circles denote allelic differences between the haplotypes with respect to V-RSs. The 21bp indel polymorphism upstream of IGKV1-8 is indicated with a red arrow. The novel sequence extending into the gap in the CH17 IGK path is shown in red. Horizontal black arrows indicate IGKV genes in opposite orientation in the locus, according to the IGK IMGT locus representation (IMGT Repertoire, http://www.imgt.org) (1) Figure 3 . Detection of putative sequence exchange event between IGK proximal and distal gene clusters (A) Pair-wise alignments between proximal and distal segmental duplications in the CH17 haplotype and NG_000834.1 (proximal) and NG_000833.1 (distal) assemblies (Abbreviations: Ka, NG_000834.1/NG_000833.1 assemblies; prox, proximal; dist, distal). The region where Ka-prox and Ka-dist show stronger similarity than CH17-dist and Ka-prox highlights a potential region of sequence exchange between the two NG_000834.1 and NG_000833.1 assemblies (red box). Coordinates (GRCh37) for the proximal cluster are shown on the X axis. (B) Top panel shows a four-way sequence alignment of a 22.5 kb region from the proximal and distal units from within the red box in (A). Blue tick marks indicate bp SNP differences between the sequences. Upward pointing red arrows indicate boundaries of regions where the NG_000833.1 distal sequence aligns with a higher sequence similarity to the NG_000834.1/NG_000833.1 assemblies and CH17 proximal sequences than to the CH17 distal sequence, indicative of exchange between proximal and distal regions of the NG_000834.1/NG_000833.1 assemblies (sequence similarities: Ka-dist/ CH17-dist=98.7%; Ka-dist/Ka-prox=99.7%). A DSS recombination analysis ((70); see methods) using the same four-way sequence alignment is shown in the bottom panel. The two peaks with the strongest DSS values (downward pointing red arrows) correspond to the predicted breakpoints shown in the top panel based on sequence similarity values. The dotted line across the chart indicates the significance threshold based on the null distribution of DSS values calculated assuming no recombination. Genes Immun.
