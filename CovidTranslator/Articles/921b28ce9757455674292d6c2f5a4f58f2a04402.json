In both classes, the hairpin conformation is achieved after a conformational change is triggered by interaction with the target cell. This review will focus in particular on the properties of the more recently described class II proteins.",

This membrane protects the genetic material of the virus until it is delivered into the cytoplasm of a new host cell to initiate infection. Delivery takes place by fusion between the virus membrane and the membrane of the host cell. This membrane-fusion reaction is a crucial step in virus infection and is mediated by transmembrane (TM) proteins that are anchored on the virus surface. Virus membranes are relatively simple compared to hostcell membranes, and the process of virus-host-cell fusion is devoid of the additional regulatory and recycling proteins that are present in many cellular fusion processes 1, 2 . Therefore, understanding the molecular mechanism of membrane fusion catalysed by viral membrane-fusion proteins is important not only for understanding virus infection, but also as a paradigm for cellular membrane-fusion reactions.",

Other variations include viruses with fusion reactions which seem to be triggered by interaction with a single receptor 3 , by the binding of the receptor to a separate attachment protein 12 , by a combination of receptor binding plus low pH 13, 14 , or by endosomal proteolysis 15 .

HA is a trimeric type 1 TM protein that contains both the receptor-binding and fusion activities of influenza virus. It is synthesized as a fusion-inactive precursor, HA0, which is processed by host-cell proteases to produce two disulphide-bonded subunits -HA1 (328 amino acids), containing the receptor-binding site, and HA2 (221 amino acids), the TM subunit responsible for fusion (FIG. 1) . HA2 is maintained in a 'metastable' state at the virus surface 19, 20 .

After processing, the overall structure of HA is almost unchanged, but the N-terminal fusion peptide of HA2 becomes buried at the trimer interface within the \u03b1-helical stalk 22 (FIG. 3) . Virus fusion is triggered by low pH, which destabilizes the HA1 trimer contacts at the head, causing the globular head domains to dissociate. This movement allows a loop-to-helix transition of a polypeptide segment of HA2 that was previously buried underneath the HA1 heads, projecting the fusion peptide ~100 \u00c5 towards the target membrane, where it inserts irreversibly 23 . This initial change is proposed to result in a 'pre-hairpin intermediate' , an extended structure that is anchored both in the target membrane by the fusion peptide and in the virus membrane by the TM segment 11 . The C-terminal end of the long HA2 \u03b1-helix jackknifes back, reversing the direction of the viral-membrane-proximal segment of HA2, which then interacts in an anti-parallel fashion with the groove formed by the N-terminal trimeric coiled coil 23 . The final post-fusion conformation of HA2 is therefore a highly stable rod with the TM and fusion-peptide segments together at the same end of the molecule (FIG. 4) , a structure termed a 'trimer of hairpins' 11 . The stability of the post-fusion conformation of HA is considerably higher than that of the metastable prefusion form, and class I membrane fusion is believed to be driven by the energy that is released during the conformational change 19, 20, 24, 25 . Hairpin formation by HA2 is postulated to force the target and virus membranes into close apposition to trigger fusion, which occurs by the initial mixing of the outer lipid leaflets (termed 'hemifusion'), followed by mixing of the inner leaflets, opening of a small fusion pore, and widening of the pore to give complete fusion.",

Structural studies of the HA fusion peptide indicate that it adopts a boomerangshaped structure formed by a kinked amphipathic \u03b1-helix lying roughly in the plane of the outer leaflet of the membrane at the polar-aliphatic interface 26 .

For example, the HIV-1 inhibitor T20/enfuvirtide is a peptide that corresponds to part of the C-terminal helix of the envelope glyco protein gp41 (REFS 31, 32) . T20 blocks the interaction of the C-terminal segment of the fusion protein with the groove of the central coiled coil (FIG. 4) , and blocks virus fusion and infection. Importantly, small molecules that target crucial sites of interaction in the trimer of hairpins have also been shown to act as potent class I fusion inhibitors 33 . As small molecules can have higher bioavailability than peptides, they provide an important approach to develop more widely useful fusion inhibitors. Although, to date, the class I inhibitors have mainly targeted viruses such as HIV-1 that are triggered at the cell surface, small molecules can also target viruses that fuse within endocytic compartments 34, 35 .",

The polypeptide chain of the class II proteins follows a complex path, resulting in three globular domains -essentially constituted by \u03b2-sheets -organized so that the C terminus and the fusion peptide are found at the two ends of a rod-like molecule of ~120 \u00c5 in length (FIG. 2) . Domain I, which contains the N terminus and a conserved glycosylation site, is a \u03b2-barrel with an 'up-and-down' topology. Two of the connections between adjacent strands in this barrel are long and elaborated, and comprise the 'finger-like' domain II with the fusion loop at the tip of the molecule. Domain III, which lies at the opposite end of domain I, has an immunoglobulin-superfamily fold and is connected to the C terminus of domain I by an ~12 amino-acid polypeptide. The TM domain of SFV E1 and the two TM domains of TBE were proteolytically removed to generate the soluble ectodomains. The SFV E1 ecto domain, referred to here as E1*, retains part of the 'stem' region that connects domain III to the TM domain, although this flexible region is not visualized in the neutral pH structure.

Unlike the class I fusion proteins, which are trimeric in both their pre-fusion and post-fusion conformations, class II fusion proteins undergo an oligomeric rearrangement during fusion [56] [57] [58] , converting from the metastable prefusion dimer to a considerably more stable homotrimer conformation 59,60 (TABLE 2) . Formation of the targetmembrane-inserted homotrimer is required for class II virus fusion 61, 62 . Binding of protons in the acidic endosomal environment triggers a complete rearrangement of the surface of the class II virus particles. The alphavirus E2-E1 heterodimers or the flavivirus E-E homodimers dissociate 58, 63 , resulting in disassembly of the icosahedral scaffold followed by a quaternary reorganization into E1 or E homotrimers inserted in the membrane by the fusion loops. Importantly, as discussed below, the homotrimers seem to display lateral contacts between each other, forming a different type of surface lattice. In vitro studies using the ectodomains of both the alphavirus and flavivirus proteins showed that trimerization requires insertion of the fusion peptide into target membranes 64, 65 . Solubilization of the trimers from the liposomes using non-ionic detergent led to their crystallization 66, 67 and to determination of their threedimensional structure [68] [69] [70] .",

For example, although heterodimer dissociation exposes the SFV fusion peptide, this alone does not seem sufficient for membrane insertion. The fusion loop is solvent-accessible in the pH-7 form of the E1* ectodomain 38 . The crystal structure shows that in the monomeric form, the E1 fusion loop (which is longer than its flavivirus counterpart) folds back on itself, burying most of the bulky non-polar side chains. Its insertion into the target membrane apparently requires specific triggering by low pH and target-membrane cholesterol 64, 71 . This agrees with the cholesterol dependence of alphavirus membrane fusion, as discussed below. Once E1* has stably inserted into the target membrane, it then requires detergent for solubilization, similar to the membrane-inserted class I proteins. The structure of the SFV detergentsolubilized E1* homotrimer shows that the fusion peptide unwinds, and the bulky non polar side chains are exposed, presumably within a detergent micelle in the crystal.",

For both viruses, the action of cholesterol is more specific than its bulk effects on membrane fluidity or 'raft' formation, with the sterol 3\u03b2-hydroxyl group being particularly important for promoting membrane insertion, trimerization and fusion.

This system was used to select for SFV mutants that have increased cholesterol independence 80, 81 . These srf (sterol requirement in function) mutants have single amino-acid changes in E1, located in the ij loop at the tip (the srf-3 P226S mutation) or in the hinge region (the srf-4 L44F and srf-5 V178A mutations) of domain II (FIG. 2) . The molecular mechanisms by which the srf mutations alter alphavirus cholesterol dependence are not yet known. For srf-3, the location in the ij loop suggests that the mutation could directly modulate the cholesterol dependence of the adjacent fusion loop. For srf-4 and srf-5, the location in the hinge area suggests that these mutations might affect the inherent flexibility of this region, indirectly altering the angle of interaction of the fusion loop with the target membrane. To demonstrate the suggested membrane interactions of the proteins, the final fused membrane is diagrammed in cartoon form. The class I proteins are drawn such that the N-terminal half of the hairpin is blue and the C-terminal part is red, with the missing fusion peptides and transmembrane domains indicated for one of the three trimer subunits as blue and red stars, respectively. For HA2, the residues are coloured as in the neutral pH form displayed in FIG. 3 , and a membrane-proximal extended C-terminal 'leash' interacts with the central coiled coil of HA. In HIV glycoprotein 41 (gp41), the post-fusion structure is a six-helix bundle. The inhibitor T20 interacts at the site where the red helix is, effectively inhibiting the fusogenic conformational change. For the class II proteins, an elongated red star indicates the predicted location of the TM segment, with a red arrow pointing to the C terminus of one of the subunits in the trimer of the crystallized class II ectodomains, roughly showing the path of the missing 'stem' regions to complete the protein hairpin.

First, electron-microscopy studies of the membrane-inserted ectodomains of SFV and TBE show that insertion is highly cooperative and produces characteristic arrays of trimers organized in rings of five or six to form a lattice covering the liposome surface 67, 84 (FIG. 5) . Liposomes fully decorated with inserted SFV E1* display a fairly uniform diameter of ~120 nm, considerably smaller than the mean diameter of control liposomes without the protein. The surface-protein lattice therefore seems to control the curvature of the coated liposomes. Because hexagonal arrays of E1* trimers result in a flat lattice, as shown in FIG. 5, it is probable that rings of five E1* trimers are required to introduce the necessary overall curvature to make a fullerene-like 85, 86 , roughly spherical closed lattice at the liposome surface.",

            "text": "Second, the packing of SFV E1* trimers in the threedimensional crystals largely occurs through two-fold interactions between the fusion loops of adjacent trimers 68 . The trimer axes and the two-fold axis relating them intersect in space, making an angle close to the angle between three-fold and two-fold axes in an icosahedron. As in an icosahedron, the combination of these two operations (three-fold and two-fold about the corresponding symmetry axes) generates a five-fold axis also intersecting the three-fold and two-fold axes at the same point in space (at the centre of the body). The trimers in the crystals therefore interact through the fusion peptide in such a way that the contacts can be propagated -by repeating the observed trimer-trimer contacts through the fusion loops -to generate a closed ring of five E1* trimers, all associated by their fusion loops, just like the rings observed by electron microscopy. The fusion peptides in the five-fold rings form a 'crater' ~100 \u00c5 in diameter and 40 \u00c5 deep, with a base composed of five fusion loops and a rim composed of the remaining ten fusion loops. As all three fusion loops in each trimer are believed to interact tightly with the lipid heads, the resulting arrangement of trimers is such that it creates a dome-like distortion in the target membrane, which is postulated to be important in fusion, as shown in the model in FIG. 6. Therefore, electron-microscopy data and the crystal contacts provide support for two types of cooperative homotrimer interactions, producing rings of five and six trimers. We hypothesize that during fusion, five-fold interactions will occur between target-membraneinserted trimers at the side of the particle closest to the cell membrane. Such five-fold interactions would act at the fusion site to induce formation of a 'dome' in the target lipid bilayer, whereas the refolding of E1 to a hairpin would pull the TM regions toward the centre of the five-fold ring, forming an opposing dome in the viral membrane and inducing hemifusion (FIG. 6) . This 'lipid stalk' model for fusion is comparable to that proposed for the class I proteins 87 , and in keeping with recent studies which show that alphavirus fusion progresses through a transient hemifusion intermediate 88 . The six-fold trimer interactions might occur between trimers that do not directly interact with the target membrane and insert instead into the virus membrane. The more planar interactions of such trimers could have a role in the enlargement of the initial fusion pore by providing energy to flatten the viral membrane 89 . Although these models are currently speculative, they provide a starting point for thinking about the geometry of the fusion reaction. The left panel shows a negatively stained sample of E1 ectodomain homotrimers (E1*HT) reconstituted at a low lipid-to-protein ratio to produce a planar hexagonal lattice. On liposomes, the E1*HT is proposed to display a fullerene-like architecture, in which insertion of rings of five instead of six trimers allows the required curvature to form a closed sphere (see text). Images of the planar lattice such as that shown on the left were used to generate a three-dimensional reconstruction into which the atomic model of the E1*HT was fitted (right panel). Direct lateral interactions between the trimer heads are observed from the fitting, as shown in this top view. Interactions between the fusion loops of adjacent trimers could also occur through adjustment of the hinge region (indicated in FIG. 2a) . Figure How general is cooperativity? As discussed above, there is considerable evidence for fusion-protein cooperativity for members of the class I fusion proteins, particularly for the low-pH-induced influenza HA. Interestingly, however, recent data indicate that some class I virus fusion reactions might be mediated by as few as one or two trimers. Antibody-neutralization studies of HIV indicate that the target of neutralization is one trimer 90 , and detailed studies using viruses containing mixtures of wild-type and dominant-negative envelope proteins showed entry of viruses containing a single active HIV Env trimer 91 . Other class I viruses where fusion is triggered by receptor binding (murine leukemia virus) or by receptor plus low pH (avian sarcoma/leukosis virus) also showed entry properties that are suggestive of fusion mediated by a single trimer. By contrast, parallel studies of influenza HA fusion supported a requirement for eight or nine trimers 91 . Further investigations will be required to determine if viruses with fusion directly triggered by low pH generally require multiple fusion proteins, the importance of concerted and cooperative interactions of those proteins, and whether fusion proteins with triggers that involve receptor binding typically activate fusion autonomously. Implications and future directions Studies of the class I and class II fusion proteins indicate that, although their structures are very different, both classes refold during fusion to give analogous hairpin conformations, with the fusion peptides or loops and the TM domains at the same end of a stable protein rod. These observations indicate that the overall mechanism of membrane fusion is probably the same for both class I and II, indicating that there might be a universal membrane-fusion mechanism, applicable to proteins that are clearly not homologous. Although the structural and functional studies summarized here suggest an overall picture for class II fusion, many important questions remain and new questions can now be identified. For example, we do not understand the mechanism by which the class II fusion loop inserts into the target membrane, or the role of cholesterol in insertion. The current data indicate that insertion and fusion can be modulated by the ij loop and hinge region, but their mechanistic effects are unclear. We have a picture of the fusionprotein ectodomain before and after fusion, but we do not know how the fusion loop and TM domains are disposed in the fused membrane or how they might interact with each other. A series of conformational changes in class II fusion proteins can be proposed (FIG. 6) , but their order, kinetics and role in each of the steps of membrane fusion remain to be elucidated. We also do not understand how the refolding of the fusion protein to the trimer conformation takes place in the context of the whole virus particle, the fate of the companion protein (E2 in the case of alphaviruses) during this particle reorganization, and the role(s) of the observed five-fold and six-fold trimer interactions in the overall membrane-fusion process.",

Recent work indicates that exogenous domain III blocks class II membrane fusion and infection by binding to the fusion protein during the low-pH-induced conformational change 92 . Similar to the class I proteins, such inhibitors could prove important for dissecting the molecular mechanism of fusion and, ultimately, for developing novel antiviral strategies. Clearly, there is much exciting work to be done, and we look forward to future developments and discussions on the fusion of the class II viruses.",
