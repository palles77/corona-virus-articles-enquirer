ISG15 consists of two Ub-like domains and aids the immune system in neutralizing infections by numerous pathogens and plays an important role in defending cells against many viruses including influenza A. Recently, Ub was found to be a substrate for ISG15, which can be ISGylated on Lys29 and Lys48, while the former is more dominant. The discovery of such hybrid ISG15-Ub chains brought forward various fundamental questions regarding the nature and effect of this conjugation. To further investigate the role of hybrid ISG15-Ub chains, the pure homogeneous material of these chains is needed in workable quantities. By applying advanced chemical strategies for protein synthesis, we report the total chemical synthesis of a 231-residue ISG15-Lys29-Ub hybrid chain. During the synthesis we encountered insoluble peptide fragments, and therefore we developed a new reversible Acm based solubilizing tag to efficiently tackle this hurdle. This new Acm tag was compared with the known Arg based Acm solubilizing tag and was found to be more reliable in terms of incorporation and efficiency as demonstrated in the synthesis of the native ISG15-Ub hybrid chain.",

            "text": "Ubiquitin (Ub) is a 76 amino acid protein involved in many cellular events, e.g., trafficking, transcription, and proteasome degradation. 1,2 The covalent attachment of Ub to a Lys residue of a target protein requires three enzymes, E1, E2, and E3, and is known as ubiquitination. 3 Repeating this cycle on an ubiquitinated protein produces multiubiquitination either on different Lys residues or on the same site, eventually leading to different cellular signals. 4, 5 On the other hand, ubiquitin-like modifiers (Ubls) are a family of proteins similar in structure to Ub, yet different in sequence. This family includes SUMO 1/ 2/3/4 (small ubiquitin-like modifier), NEDD8 (neural precursor cell expressed developmentally downregulated protein 8) , and ISG15 (interferon-stimulated gene 15). 6 ISG15 has a similar structure to di-Ub, with two domains connected by a short linker. 7 Additionally, the covalent attachment of ISG15 to a Lys residue of proteins (ISGylation) demands its own set of three enzymes E1, E2, and E3. 8, 9 ISGylation is considered an essential element for neutralizing infections by numerous pathogens including influenza and coronavirus. 8, 10, 11 Moreover, ISGylation is involved in various other cellular functions including inhibiting proteasomemediated degradation and protein translation; it controls actin cytoskeleton dynamics and is involved in translesion DNA synthesis. 12 Subsequently, researchers are interested in studying ISG15 to acquire deeper insight on the ISG15 role in numerous cellular processes. For instance, what is the fate of ISGylated protein compared to diubiquitinated proteins? And the effect of protein ISGylation on protein stability is unknown. Specifically, the role of ISGylated proteins and ISG15 in cancer development is also not yet understood.",

To our best knowledge, there are no reports for the chemical synthesis or semisynthesis of ISG15-Ub hybrid chains. Producing ISG15 has been done only by expression, 14, 15 which also turned out to be challenging especially in handling the protein where mutations had to be introduced to enable their expression and perform biological studies with the protein. 7 Herein, we describe our route toward the chemical synthesis of ISG15-Ub hybrid chains. Despite the structural similarities of ISG15 to Ub, the synthesis proved to be extremely challenging. Our initial efforts toward the synthesis of the target protein were hampered by its hydrophobic nature and high tendency for aggregation. These factors heavily affected SPPS leading to deletions and eventually complete termination of the growing peptide chain. In order to overcome all the synthetic difficulties, state of the art chemical methods and strategies have been employed. 16 A key to our success was the development and application of a new Acm derivative to serve for cysteine protection and increase the peptide solubility.",

After analyzing the sequence of ISG15, made of 157 residues, we initially decided to divide it into three shorter peptide fragments, which can be prepared by Fmoc-SPPS. The synthesis of the second and third fragments (ISG15(29\u221259) and ISG15(60\u2212165), Figures S1 and S4) proceeded without complications. We did not encounter problems in the synthesis or in the following purification step. Contrary to this, in the synthesis of the first fragment, ISG15(2\u221228), we found that after coupling the first 14 amino acids, the fragment was poorly soluble and the HPLC showed broad, tailing peaks, without a major peak that corresponded to the product. On the basis of our previous experiences in the synthesis of difficult proteins, installing a side chain solubilizing tag (e.g., attached through a phenylacetamidomethyl (Phacm) linker to a Cys residue) could significantly improve protein synthesis. 17\u221219 Upon introduction of this solubilizing tag onto the temporary Ala11Cys mutation, we were glad to see that the synthesis of this fragment has improved, but to our disappointment, we found that this fragment (even with the solubilizing tag) was tailing in the column, rendering its separation and purification very challenging and its final isolation in a very low yield.",

However, since there are no additional positions suitable for its installation, we combined the first and second fragments and introduced a second solubilizing tag at the Ala40Cys temporary mutation site. The second solubilizing tag somewhat improved the purification step, but the SPPS itself still suffered from deletion and termination of the growing peptide chain possibly due to aggregation on the polymer support ( Figure S2 ), eventually leading to low yielding synthesis. Unfortunately, this issue cannot be strategically addressed as the beneficial effect of the used solubilizing tags materializes after the SPPS is completed but not during synthesis. This encouraged us to design a new solubilizing tag, which upon its installation would have an immediate effect on the solubility of the hydrophobic fragment, leading to a better tracking of the different coupling steps.",

Furthermore, it can positively contribute to the solubility of the peptide fragments and the later intermediates along the synthesis.

            "text": "Examining the reported cases for the expression of ISG15, it is established that Cys78 significantly contributes to the precipitation of the full ISG15 protein. 7, 25 Subsequently, we decided to introduce the Cys78Ser mutation in order to avoid the formation of the dimer form of the protein. This mutation is located in the loop region, connecting the two Ub like domains of ISG15; thus no impact on the biological activity is anticipated. The \u03b4-mercaptolysine containing Ub was prepared according the previously reported procedures. 26 The incorporation of the new solubilizing tags enabled the synthesis of the challenging ISG15(2\u221260) 3 (Figure 2A , Figure S3 ) on multimilligram scale. The peptide was synthesized on hydrazide substituted Trt resin, and after resin cleavage the crude peptide was subsequently converted with 4-mercaptomethylacetic acid (MPAA) to the corresponding thioester according to a modified variant of the recently reported conditions by the Dawson group. 27 The second fragment of ISG15, 4 (Figure 2A ), could be prepared without any synthetic difficulty bearing C-terminal hydrazide, using HCTU/HATU coupling reagents in NMP. 28 With sufficient amounts of the ISG15 fragments in hand, we proceeded to the first ligation (Figure 2A ). During our initial trials, we observed that despite using standard 6 M guanidine hydrochloride (Gn\u00b7HCl) buffer (pH 7.2) with tris(2carboxyethyl)phosphine hydrochloride (TCEP\u00b7HCl) and MPAA, the peptide fragments and the ligated product were very prone to aggregation and gel formation. This led to slow reaction time and to inhomogeneous concentration of the reactants in the ligation mixture. We found that lowering the protein concentration to 1.7 mM and adding boric acid (25 mM) significantly improved the solubility and minimized the gel formation. Unfortunately, the ligated protein, ISG15(2\u2212 157) 5a (Figure 2A) , eluted at the same retention time as fragment 4. In order to ensure full conversion, we used a substoichiometric amount of cysteine-fragment 4 and left the ligation to proceed overnight at 42\u00b0C. After no more cysteinefragment 4 could be observed by ESI-MS, the ligated protein ISG15(2\u2212157) 5a, with C-terminal hydrazide, was in situ transformed to the MPAA thioester by the addition of acetyl acetone (acac), TCEP\u00b7HCl, and MPAA, containing Gn\u00b7HCl buffer (pH 3), and overnight incubation at room temperature. 27 The full length ISG15 thioester protein 5b (Figure 2A ) was purified on semipreparative HPLC and gave the purified product in 28% isolated yield for one-pot NCL and thioester conversion.",

The product could only be isolated on an analytical HPLC instrument using a heated C4 column. After the deprotection of the Cys residues Bioconjugate Chemistry pubs.acs.org/bc Article and the desulfurization steps, all our efforts to obtain ESI-MS spectra failed. Similar phenomena were reported in cases of some highly hydrophobic proteins. 29, 30 The isolated final protein was analyzed on SDS\u2212PAGE with the Ub fragment, 6, and the full ISG15-thioester, 5b ( Figure  2F ). The SDS gel showed that the isolated final protein has a mass that ranged between 25 and 35 kDa, which corresponds to our final ISG15-Ub hybrid chain molecular weight. Moreover, we did not identify any band that corresponds to the presence of the Ub or ISG15 fragments along with the isolated final protein. Consequently, we performed Western blotting against both anti-Ub and anti-ISG15 antibody to further provide evidence for the purity of the final protein and show the recognition of antibodies toward our synthesized ISG15-Lys29-Ub hybrid chain ( Figure S8 ).",
