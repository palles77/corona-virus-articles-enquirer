The aim was to identify LRDs caused by CRVs. CRVs associated with LRDs in patients included influenza A and B viruses, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), human parainfluenza virus (HPIV) 1-3, human rhinovirus (HRhV), human adenovirus (HAdV), and human metapneumovirus (HMPV). Clinical information, including demographics, comorbidities, coinfections, and mortality were investigated. The endpoint of the study was set as January 31, 2012, or the time of death or loss to follow up.

Hospital-acquired infection was defined as symptom onset 3 or more days after hospital admission. 9 The presence of co-pathogens was defined as the isolation of pathogenic bacterial species, fungal species, or other opportunistic viruses, such as cytomegalovirus (CMV), from the respiratory specimen obtained within a month of detection of a CRV, in conjunction with consistent symptoms, and as confirmed by infectious disease specialists. 5 Proven or probable invasive fungal disease was defined according to the criteria of the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer/Invasive Fungal Infections Cooperative Group and the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases Mycoses Study Group Consensus Group in 2008. 11 A mixed CRV infection was defined by the isolation of more than two CRVs during the same episode. Mortality due to LRDs caused by CRVs was defined as death resulting from respiratory failure, with no period of complete recovery between the onset of illness and death within 30 days, and without a documented copathogen. 12 Overall mortality was defined as death from any cause within 30 days following diagnosis of CRV-LRD. An absolute lymphocyte count (ALC) of <200 cells/mm 3 blood within the 2 weeks preceding a CRV infection diagnosis was defined as lymphopenia, and an absolute neutrophil count (ANC) of <500 cells/mm 3 blood within the 2 weeks prior to a CRV infection was defined as neutropenia. 6 The dosage of corticosteroid use was classified into three groups according to the highest daily dose taken by the patient during the 2 weeks preceding a CRV infection: high-dose corticosteroid use was defined as \u22651 mg/kg/day of prednisone and its equivalent dose of corticosteroids: low-dose use was defined as \u22641 mg/kg/day of prednisone; and the third group received topical corticosteroids. 13 The grade of immunodeficiency was classified into three groups, including severe, moderate, and mild immunodeficiency. 14 Severe immunodeficiency (SID) was defined as the presence of two or more of the following: allogeneic SCT (alloSCT) within 6 months, or autologous SCT (autoSCT) within 3 months, preceding the diagnosis of a CRV infection; acute GVHD (grade \u22652); ALC <200 cells/mm 3 or ANC <500 cells/mm 3 within 2 weeks, before the diagnosis; and a pre-engraftment period or administration of immunosuppressive therapy \u22642 weeks prior to the diagnosis. Moderate immunodeficiency (MID) was defined as the presence of only one criteria of SID or two or more of the following criteria: an alloSCT within 1 year (\u22656 months) or an autoSCT within 6 months (\u22653 months), prior to the diagnosis of a CRV infection; ALC between 200 and 500 cells/mm 3 , or ANC between 500 and 1000 cells/mm 3 , within 2 weeks before the diagnosis; and administration of immunosuppressive drugs within 1 month prior to the diagnosis. Patients who met only one criterion of MID were regarded as having a mild immunodeficiency state.",

Seven (50%) of 14 patients with influenza-LRDs received antiviral therapy, and all received it within 48 hours following influenza-LRD diagnosis. However, early antiviral therapy within 48 hours after symptom onset was performed for only 3 (21.4%) patients.

Four (57.1%) of seven patients with HRhV-LRDs required mechanical ventilation, and the 30-day mortality rate for these patients was 14.3% (1/7). Co-pathogens isolated from respiratory specimens were detected in 33.8% (23/67) of patients with CRV-LRDs. The most common bacterial co-pathogen was Acinetobacter baumannii (n=7; 10.4%), followed by Pseudomonas aeruginosa (n=5; 7.4%) and Streptococcus pneumoniae (n=4; 5.9%).

            "text": "RSV infections have been reported to occur in 1.2-9.6% of adult SCT recipients. 5, 17, 18 The incidences and mortality rates of RSV-LRDs among SCT recipients were reported as 2.9-5.1% and 16.7-50%, respectively. 5, 6, 14, 17 These findings are consistent with the incidence (2.7%) and mortality rate (22.5%) of RSV-LRD observed at our center, in spite of the low rate of ribavirin treatment (9.7%). Known risk factors of RSV-associated mortality in SCT patients included pre-engraftment, lymphopenia, alloSCT <1 month previously, SID, and an older age (>65 years). 14, 19 The highest incidence of RSV occurred between January and April, which is consistent with our result that the majority of RSV-LRDs were detected between December and March. 20 Symptomatic HPIV infections have been reported to occur in 1.4-7.1% of adult SCT recipients in previous studies. 5, 21, 22 The reported frequency and mortality rates of HPIV-LRDs among SCT recipients were 0.05-8.1% and 11.8-46%, respectively. 5, 6, 9, 10, [22] [23] [24] The 30-day mortality rate of HPIV-LRD at our center, 26.3% (5/19) , was similar to that of previous studies, despite the low rate of antiviral treatment (36.8%). Since HPIV showed the highest cumulative incidence of LRDs at 100 days (23.5%; 95% CI, 3.3-43.7) and 1 year (69.2%; 95% CI, 45.9-92.5) following SCT, the performance of a laboratory examination is important due to non-specific respiratory symptoms. Independent predictors of HPIV-associated death that have been reported in the literature include steroid usage, cancer status, Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II score, LRD, infection immediately following SCT (<30 days), mismatched donor, the need for mechanical ventilation, and the presence of co-pathogens. 9, 22, 23 Similarly, high-dose steroid usage at the time of diagnosis was one of the independent predictors of death among SCT recipients with CRV-LRDs in the present study. Furthermore, the present study demonstrated that HPIV infections were most prevalent in the summer months, followed by spring, which had been reported previously. 9, 22 Previous studies reported that the incidence of HRhV-LRD among SCT recipients is rare (0-1.4%), and that HRhV-LRDs are associated with low mortality rates. 5, 25 In the present study, the incidence of HRhV-LRD was 0.7% (7/1038 patients) and the associated 30-day mortality rate was 14.3% (1/7 patients). These results are consistent with the preceding studies that HRhV may cause severe infections in SCT recipients, with high rates of progression to LRD and mortality. 18, 26, 27 Ison, et al. 28 reported that all 6 SCT recipients with pneumonia in whom HRhV was detected in BAL had significant coinfections and suggested that HRhV might be a cause of frequent superinfections, possibly through lytic infection or an indirect immunosuppressive effect. Our study also indicated that 42.9% (3/7) of patients with HRhV-LRDs were positive for the presence of copathogens.",

            "text": "In the present study, high-dose steroid usage and lymphopenia were shown to be risk factors for mortality in SCT recipients with CRV-LRDs. Lymphopenia was previously reported as a risk factor for mortality among SCT patients with LRDs caused by influenza or RSV. 6, 13, 19 Additionally, high-dose steroid usage during the 2 weeks preceding a CRV-LRD diagnosis was reported as an independent predictor of mortality among SCT recipients with HPIV-LRDs. 9, 23 It is likely that these two risk factors are associated with a decreased T-cell-mediated immune response. 22 Furthermore, high-dose corticosteroid use is known to be associated with a trend toward delayed viral clearance. 35 Conversely, a few previous studies reported that the use of corticosteroids exerted protective effects against the progression to pneumonia and requirement for mechanical ventilation among SCT recipients with influenza-LRDs, which was hypothesized to occur due to a salutary immunomodulatory effect. 13, 15 There are several limitations of the present study. As this was a retrospective study, there were no standardized guidelines for the screening and treatment of CRV infections. However, to overcome this limitation, only CRV-LRD cases were included. Due to the small number of cases, it was not possible to analyze the risk factors for mortality for individual CRV-LRDs. Another limitation was that it was difficult to determine whether the fatal outcome was solely attributable to the CRV or due to a combination of the CRV and co-pathogens. However, precise discrimination of the pathogen would likely have been meaningless, since damage to the respiratory epithelium as a result of a CRV infection may have been the key factor that facilitated the occurrence of superinfections. 9 Recent studies showed that viral nucleic acid was detected in the bloodstream more frequently among SCT recipients with LRDs caused by influenza, RSV, HAdV, and HMPV, and that this was associated with increased mortality rates. [36] [37] [38] Therefore, viral nucleic acid detection in the bloodstream of SCT recipients with CRV-LRDs could be used to predict disease severity, poor outcome, and the need for intensified antiviral treatment in the future.",

For SCT recipients with LRDs caused by influenza, RSV, or HPIV infec-tions, those receiving high-dose steroid treatment or those with lymphopenia, early antiviral treatment should be considered; especially considering the fact that no vaccine is yet available for RSV and HPIV. Furthermore, infection control measures, including hand hygiene and respiratory droplet isolation, which reduce the occurrence of new infections and transmission, are important for CRVs without a specific antiviral treatment option, such as HRhV and HMPV. Finally, in order to prevent LRDs caused by influenza, which is the only CRV with an available vaccine, the annual seasonal influenza vaccination is recommended for all SCT recipients.",
