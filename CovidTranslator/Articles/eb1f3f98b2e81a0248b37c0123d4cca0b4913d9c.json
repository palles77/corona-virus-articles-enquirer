SARS-CoV nucleocapsid (N) protein has been cloned sequenced and expressed in Escherichia coli strain. Purified N protein was used to measure the SARS-CoV specific IgG antibodies from 16 SARS-CoV infected patients' sera and from 131 control subjects using ELISA assay. Specific antibody responses to the purified recombinant N protein after 10, 20, and 30 days of disease onset were observed in 13 of 16 (81.3%), 16 of 16 (100%) and 16 of 16 (100%) SARS patients sera, respectively. Comparison of detection results with a commercially available diagnostic kit coated with a mixture of SARS-CoV viral proteins showed 9 of 16 (56.3%), 13 of 16 (81.3%), and 15 of 16 (93.7%) positive responses, respectively. None of 131 control sera gave positive reaction in either assay. This data suggests that the N protein of SARS-CoV is immunodominant and this ELISA based test assay for detecting the SARS-CoV N antigen may hold a significant value for SARS diagnosis.",

            "text": "Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) is a recently recognized febrile respiratory illness that first appeared in southern China in November 2002, and has since spread to several other countries. The disease was caused by a novel coronavirus, now provisionally named \"SARS-associated coronavirus\" (SARS-CoV) (Drosten et al., 2003; Ksiazek et al., 2003; Peiris et al., 2003) . The severity of this disease is such that the mortality rate appears to be 9.6% and diagnostic methods for SARS are urgently needed (Lipsitch et al., 2003; Riley et al., 2003) . The SARS-CoV is an enveloped virus of a positive single-stranded RNA genome \u223c29.7 kb in length and has 11 open reading frames. The genome organization is similar to that other coronavirus, where phylogenic analyses and sequence comparisons showed that the SARS-CoV is not closely related to any of previously characterized coronavirus (Marra et al., 2003; Rota et al., 2003) . The structural protein genes of SARS-CoV contain four major open reading frames; including the surface spike (S) glycoprotein, the small membrane (M) protein, the envelope (E) glycoprotein, the nucleocapsid (N) protein, and a set of accessory proteins whose number and sequence vary among different coronaviruses (Siddell, 1995) . The N proteins have been shown to be strong immunogens in several coronaviruses, such as murine coronavirus (Wage et al., 1993) , Turkey coronavirus (Akin et al., 2001) , porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome coronavirus (Casal et al., 1998) . It has been reported that N protein accumulates intra-cellularly even before it is packed in the mature virus (Collisson et al., 2000) and is the most abundant virus derived-protein throughout the infection, probably because its template mRNA is the most abundant subgenomic RNA (Hiscox et al., 1995; Keck et al., 1988) . These features make it a suitable candidate for raising antibodies for diagnostic applications.",

Interestingly, we found that 13 of 16 (81.3%), 16 of 16 (100%), and 16 of 16 (100%) SARS patients had a significant positive response to the N protein after 10, 20, and 30 days of disease onset, respectively. When comparing this result with a commercially available detection ELISA kit coated with a mixture of viral proteins (S, N, and E), prepared by Beijing Genomics Institute, Chinese Academy of Science, Beijing, China, we observed that the immunoreactivity with the SARS patient's antibodies were 9 of 16 (56.3%), 13 of 16 (81.3%), and 15 of 16 (93.7%) at 10, 20, and 30 days of disease onset, respectively, while none of the 131 control sera from symptom free and non-SARS patients gave a positive reaction in either assay (Table 1 ). This result showed that the IgG antibodies to N protein is commonly present in all 16 SARS patients sera and could be detected as early as 10 days of disease onset.

The results indicate that the ELISA based on the SARS-CoV N protein has high sensitivity and high specificity. Eighty-one percent of the SARS patients had a positive result 10 days after disease onset while 100% had positive results at 20 and 30 days post-infection. When comparing this result with the commercially available diagnosis kit using a mixture of viral proteins, only 56.3% of the sera were positive 10 days after disease onset while 81.3% and 93.7% were positive after 20 and 30 days, respectively. No reactivity was observed in the control samples in either assay. The difference in the positive response between these two assays may be due to the quantity of coated N protein or to the expression and purification procedures that has been used for the recombinant viral proteins. Our work suggests that the high specificity and sensitivity of nucleocapsid protein ELISA indicates that it has potential to be an useful option for the sero-diagnosis of SARS, and will be particularly in laboratories that lack BSL 3 facilities. However, the cross reactivity of this assay in patients with recent infection with human coronaviruses 229E and OC43 require to be studied more closely. Therefore, until further experience is accumulated with this assay, it is suggested that the nucleocapsid protein ELISA can be useful as a screening test, with positive results being confirmed by immunofluorescence or virus neutralization tests.",
