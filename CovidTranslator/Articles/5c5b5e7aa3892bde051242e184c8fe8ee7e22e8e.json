            "text": "Identification of host factors that are needed for Zaire Ebolavirus (EBOV) entry provides insights into the mechanism(s) of filovirus uptake, and these factors may serve as potential antiviral targets. In order to identify novel host genes and pathways involved in EBOV entry, gene array findings in the National Cancer Institute's NCI-60 panel of human tumor cell lines were correlated with permissivity for EBOV glycoprotein (GP)-mediated entry. We found that the gene encoding the \u24252 subunit of AMPactivated protein kinase (AMPK) strongly correlated with EBOV transduction in the tumor panel. The AMPK inhibitor compound C inhibited infectious EBOV replication in Vero cells and diminished EBOV GP-dependent, but not Lassa fever virus GPC-dependent, entry into a variety of cell lines in a dose-dependent manner. Compound C also prevented EBOV GP-mediated infection of primary human macrophages, a major target of filoviral replication in vivo. Consistent with a role for AMPK in filovirus entry, time-of-addition studies demonstrated that compound C abrogated infection when it was added at early time points but became progressively less effective when added later. Compound C prevented EBOV pseudovirion internalization at 37\u00b0C as cell-bound particles remained susceptible to trypsin digestion in the presence of the inhibitor but not in its absence. Mouse embryonic fibroblasts lacking the AMPK\u24231 and AMPK\u24232 catalytic subunits were significantly less permissive to EBOV GP-mediated infection than their wild-type counterparts, likely due to decreased macropinocytic uptake. In total, these findings implicate AMPK in macropinocytic events needed for EBOV GP-dependent entry and identify a novel cellular target for new filoviral antivirals.",

The viral glycoprotein (GP) is present on the surface of virions and is composed of a heterotrimeric complex consisting of GP1 that interacts with attachment factors and receptors and GP2 that mediates fusion between the host and viral membrane (2) (3) (4) (5) (6) (7) (8) (9) (10) (11) (12) . Several cellular adherence factors/receptors have been identified that mediate filovirus internalization, including TIM-1 on epithelial cells and several C-type lectins on antigen-presenting cells (2, 8, 9, 13, 14) . Upon internalization, Ebolavirus progresses through endocytic compartments with low-pH-dependent proteolytic processing of heavily glycosylated GP by cathepsins B and L (Cat B/L), generating a 19-kDa form (15, 16) . This processed GP interacts with Niemann-Pick C1 (NPC1) in the late endosome or lysosomal compartment (5, 6, 17) . Subsequent events that are poorly defined result in membrane fusion.",

Strong evidence supports a role for macropinocytosis in a variety of cell types as virion-associated EBOV GP interactions with host cells stimulate actin polymerization events, leading to membrane blebbing, lamellipodium formation, and macropinocytosis resulting in virus uptake (20, 21, 23) . In addition to actin polymerization, a variety of cell signaling molecules, including RhoC, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), Rac1, protein kinase C (PKC), CDC42, PAK1, and Axl, are implicated in macropinocytic uptake of EBOV in various cells (20, 21, 22, (25) (26) (27) .",

Not surprisingly, this critical sensor of metabolism has also been implicated in regulating replication of some viruses (31) . Two regulatory subunits, \u2424 and \u2425, as well as the catalytic \u2423 subunit make up the heterotrimeric AMPK complex, which is conserved in all eukaryotic species (32) . Anabolic processes in cells hydrolyze ATP to ADP or AMP. As these anabolic by-products accumulate, AMP binds to the \u2425 subunit of AMPK and causes structural changes and subsequent phosphorylation of Thr172 in the catalytic subunit, which is required for AMPK activity (33) . AMP and ADP binding also prevent dephosphorylation of the alpha subunit and subsequent inactivation of the AMPK complex by cellular phosphatases (34) . Both Ca 2\u03e9 /calmodulin-dependent protein kinase kinase (CAMKK) and LKB1 phosphorylate and activate AMPK, but there are undoubtedly other upstream kinases (35) . In general, AMPK activation causes a cellular switch from ATP-consuming to ATP-producing pathways such as fatty acid oxidation, glycolysis, and glucose uptake (28) (29) (30) 33) .",

For instance, macrophages from diabetic mice have reduced macropi-nocytosis, and leptin-enhanced AMPK activity increased macropinocytosis (38) . Another recent study implicated Rac1 as a mediator of AMPK-dependent phagocytosis (36) . Moser et al. extended this work, investigating virus internalization using an RNA interference (RNAi) screen of the Drosophila kinome, identifying the importance of AMPK activity for vaccinia virus (VV) uptake via macropinocytosis (39) . However, pathways activated by AMPK that lead to actin-dependent macropinocytosis remain poorly defined. With the recent appreciation of the importance of macropinocytosis for filovirus infection, we sought to determine if AMPK is involved in EBOV entry. In this study, we demonstrate that AMPK is required for efficient EBOV entry. Recognition of the importance of this critical cellular kinase for EBOV infectivity opens a new avenue for the development of filovirus antivirals.",

            "text": "We performed a large-scale bioinformatics screen called a comparative genomic analysis (CGA) screen to identify cellular genes important in EBOV GP-dependent transduction. Details of the screening approach have been previously reported (8, 22, 47, 48) . This screen utilized the NCI-60 panel of human tumor lines, and this panel of cells was redundantly evaluated for mRNA expression in gene array assays, providing mRNA expression profiles for each cell line. These gene array findings are available in the public domain (http://dtp.nci.nih.gov). The permissivity of the cell lines to VSV\u232cG-EBOV or to VSV\u232cG pseudotyped with its native glycoprotein G (VSV\u232cG-G) was determined by incubating each cell line with equal numbers of pseudovirions. The resulting percentage of cells that were EGFP positive was correlated with the gene expression data of each line by the COMPARE algorithm. Genes identified to correlate with EBOV GP-or VSV-G-dependent transduction were ranked by the Pearson correlation coefficient (PCC). Those genes within the EBOV GP listing that correlated with both EBOV GP-and VSV-G-dependent transduction were subtracted, yielding a subset of genes that were likely to be specifically involved with EBOV GP-dependent entry rather than downstream VSV expression events. Importantly, several previously identified EBOV entry factors including Axl, the C-type lectins, and integrin \u24241 correlated strongly with EBOV transduction in our screen (2, 9, 14, 20, (49) (50) (51) (52) (53) (54) (55) . In addition, several signaling molecules that previously were reported to be important for EBOV transduction/infection were also identified in this screen, including PI3K, phospholipase C (PLC), and PKC (20, 21, 23, 27) . As our screen was successful in identifying these pathways, we mined the results to identify additional signaling molecules important in EBOV entry. Intriguingly, the \u24252 subunit of AMPK correlated strongly with EBOV transduction (PCC of 0.489) (P \u03ed 0.0000875) (Fig. 1) . As AMPK has recently been reported to be important for VV uptake via macropinocytosis (39) and as macropinocytosis is an important mechanism of EBOV entry (20, 21, 23, 26) , we targeted this gene for further study.",

            "text": "A small-molecule inhibitor of AMPK inhibits EBOV infection. In our initial studies, the AMPK requirement for EBOV entry was explored in several cell lines derived from disparate tissues using compound C (also known as dorsomorphin) that is a membrane-permeable, selective inhibitor of AMPK (56) . SNB-19 cells, a neuroblastoma cell line, and the renal cell line 786-O are both in the NCI-60 cell panel and express abundant AMPK\u2425 subunit mRNA (Fig. 1, central nervous system [CNS] 4 and renal 3) . Vero, SNB-19, 786-O, and the cervical cancer line HeLa were incubated with compound C or vehicle control for 1 h. EBOV GP-pseudotyped VSV or LFV GPC-pseudotyped VSV that was used as a control virus throughout these studies was incubated with these cells for an additional 4 h. The drug and virus were removed, medium was refreshed, and viral transduction was analyzed by evaluating transduced cell EGFP expression via flow cytometry at 24 h. Compound C significantly reduced EBOV pseudovirion transduction in all cells tested although the ability of a 10 M concentration to block EBOV transduction varied between the cell lines ( Fig. 2A) . Additionally, this inhibition was specific to EBOV GP-dependent transduction as compound C had no effect on LFV GPC-dependent entry. As the viral core of both pseudovirion stocks was VSV, our findings suggested that this inhibitor was specifically interfering with EBOV GP-dependent entry into these cells. To more closely assess the effect of compound C on EBOV pseudovirion transductions, dose-response curves of the inhibitor were performed in Vero cells. In these studies, inhibitor was either removed after the first 4-h incubation of transduction (Fig. 2B) or maintained on the cells for the duration of the 24-h experiment (Fig. 2C ). Compound C inhibited EBOV pseudovirion transduction with a 50% inhibitory concentration (IC 50 ) of \u03f36 M, regardless of whether the drug was maintained or removed from the culture after 4 h. In contrast, the tested concentrations of compound C had no effect on LFV GPC-dependent entry. Maintenance of the inhibitor on the cells for the duration of the experiment resulted in greater levels of cell cytotoxicity, and, consequently, in most of our studies that used compound C, the inhibitor was removed following incubation during the initial 4 h of transduction.",

Infections were performed for 24 h in the presence of serial dilutions of compound C. The numbers of EGFP-expressing cells were assessed in these experiments. In a manner similar to our transduction studies, we found that the inhibitor was highly effective at blocking EBOV infection. Somewhat surprisingly, inhibition was more than 45-fold stronger than that observed in our transduction studies, with an IC 50 of 0.13 M. This enhanced sensitivity to compound C of our infectious virus compared to our transducing virions is likely due to the fact that VSV replication is reduced in the presence of AMPK, as recently reported (57) , and inhibition of AMPK activity may enhance replication of those VSV particles that are able to enter cells. This work provides strong evidence that AMPK activity is important for EBOV infection. Furthermore, as the only EBOV viral protein present in both the VSV transductions and EBOV infections was EBOV GP, these studies implicate AMPK activity in EBOV entry events. (58) (59) (60) (61) (62) (63) . Consequently, we next determined if EBOV GP-dependent infection of human macrophages requires AMPK. In these studies, we used a previously described, replication-competent, recombinant VSV with the EBOV GP and EGFP genes cloned into the VSV genome in place of the native G glycoprotein (EBOV GP/rVSV) (8) . Purified, in vitro matured human monocyte-derived macrophages (MDMs) from two donors were incubated for 1 h with DMSO or compound C and infected with EBOV GP/rVSV (MOI of 1) for an additional 4 h. Virus and drug were removed, and the cells were washed and maintained for an additional 24 h. Viral infection was analyzed by EGFP expres-sion using fluorescence microscopy. EBOV GP/rVSV readily infected MDMs, and compound C significantly reduced EBOV GPmediated infection, suggesting that AMPK is important for EBOV GP-dependent infection of a primary, physiologically relevant cell type (Fig. 4A ). The number of EGFP-expressing cells in the micrographs was quantitated by Volocity Image Analysis software (Perkin-Elmer), and an average of 452 cells were GFP positive in the control populations, whereas no EGFP-expressing cells were detected in the compound C-treated wells. Interestingly, the compound C treatment altered the morphology of MDMs, producing elongated cells; however, compound C cytotoxicity to MDMs was modest (Fig. 4B) .",

As our studies on AMPK had thus far involved a pharmacological inhibitor, we employed mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) lacking the \u24231/2 catalytic subunits of AMPK (AMPK\u24231/\u24232 \u03ea/\u03ea ) to extend and verify our observations (39, (64) (65) (66) . AMPK in these cells cannot become activated and is unable to phosphorylate downstream targets (39, 57, 64, 66) . Wild-type (WT) and AMPK \u03ea/\u03ea MEFs were infected with wildtype VSV (Indiana strain), vaccinia virus (VV), or EBOV GP/ rVSV, each of which expressed EGFP as a reporter gene (MOI of \u03f31). Virus expression was assayed at 24 h following infection by fixing the cells and analyzing EGFP expression using flow cytometry. AMPK \u03ea/\u03ea MEFs displayed significantly lower permissivity to VV than WT MEFs, as previously described (Fig. 5) (39) . Interestingly, EBOV GP/rVSV infection of AMPK \u03ea/\u03ea MEFs was even more reduced than infection of WT control MEFs, with less than 10% of wild-type infection in the knockout MEFs. This reduction in EBOV GP-mediated infection was specific for the glycoprotein, as VSV-G-dependent infection was equivalent in both WT and AMPK \u03ea/\u03ea MEFs, as previously reported (39) . These findings provided additional evidence that AMPK activity in the host cell was required for optimal EBOV GP-dependent entry.",

Incubation of host cells with VV and EBOV causes large actin protrusions and increased macropinocytosis (21, 23, 39, 67, 68) . To determine if AMPK was involved in actin polymerization in the presence of EBOV pseudovirions, we incubated Vero cells with VSV particles pseudotyped with EBOV GP (MOI of 200) or equivalent concentrations of VSV that did not contain a GP (Fig. 6A, No GP) in the presence and absence of 10 M compound C. After a 30-min incubation in medium with or without drug at 4\u00b0C to allow virus binding and synchronized entry, medium was removed, and prewarmed medium with or with- out compound C was added to cells for 0 or 30 min before fixation and visualization. Polymerized actin stress fibers were detected by Alexa Fluor 647-phalloidin staining and confocal microscopy. Polymerized actin staining in 6 to 12 Z-series were captured, analyzed, and quantified by voxel numbers using Imeris imaging software (Fig. 6A) . The amount of actin polymerization/cell appeared to be slightly higher at time zero in the presence of EBOV GP pseudovirions than with the no-Env pseudovirions although this difference was not statistically significant. However, as other investigators have previously found (21, 23) , the addition of EBOV caused significant actin polymerization during entry in cells at 30 min. Polymerization was inhibited by compound C. As a reduction in actin polymerization would be anticipated to result in reduced macropinocytosis, we evaluated the ability of both Vero cells treated with compound C and WT and AMPK \u03ea/\u03ea MEFs to take up high-molecular-weight dextran, a cargo commonly used to assess uptake by macropinocytosis. In our Vero cells, we also used EIPA, a specific inhibitor of the plasma membrane Na \u03e9 /H \u03e9 antiporter that is known to block macropinocytosis and EBOV entry, as a control (20, 69) . We found that both EIPA and compound C modestly, but significantly, inhibited fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated 70-kDa dextran uptake (Fig. 6B) . In a similar manner, dextran uptake by AMPK \u03ea/\u03ea MEFs was signifi-cantly reduced compared to WT MEFs (Fig. 6C) . In neither of these experiments was dextran uptake as profoundly inhibited by the absence of AMPK activity as EBOV infection, suggesting that either dextran uptake can occur in these cells independent of macropinocytosis or that other steps in EBOV infection in addition to macropinocytosis are regulated by AMPK.",

As dextran uptake was reduced in the absence of AMPK functionality, we next sought to determine if EBOV GP pseudovirion internalization was also reduced by the loss of AMPK activity. Additional inhibitors used to control this study included EIPA and CA-074. CA-074 is a cathepsin B inhibitor that allows virion internalization but blocks the proteolysis and subsequent fusion of GP in the late endosome/lysosome (15, 16, 70) . In a first series of experiments, Vero cells were incubated with effective concentrations of EIPA, CA-074, compound C, or the DMSO control for 1 h before addition of EBOV GP pseudovirions. Transduction was performed in the presence of inhibitors for an additional 4 h before the virus and inhibitor were removed and replaced with fresh medium. Transduction was assessed 24 h later. As expected, all three compounds inhibited EBOV GP pseudovirion transduction of Vero cells (Fig. 7A) . In a second set of experiments, these same concentrations of inhibitors were used in an internalization assay. Vero cells were incubated with EIPA, compound C, CA-074, or DMSO for 1 h before the cells were chilled to 4\u00b0C. Cells were then incubated with virus for an additional hour at 4\u00b0C to synchronize entry. The supernatant was replaced with prewarmed medium containing the inhibitor or DMSO for 1 h at 37\u00b0C. At times noted on the figure (0 min or 60 min), extracellular virus was removed from the cell surface by two 5-min incubations with trypsin. The treated cells were replated in fresh medium without inhibitors for 24 h. Cells that were treated with trypsin without the temperature shift displayed low levels of virus transduction compared to cells where virus was allowed to internalize for 1 h, demonstrating that the trypsin treatment removed surface-bound virions (Fig. 7B) . After 1 h of internalization in the presence of EIPA, transduction was low when the cells were treated with trypsin, indicating that the virions remained on the surface of cells. Interestingly, a similar finding was observed in the presence of compound C, demonstrating that AMPK is also required for EBOV internalization from the cell surface. As expected, cathepsin B inhibitor CA-074 had no effect on internalization of the pseudovirions from the cell surface, and, thus, under this second set of conditions, subsequent transduction was not inhibited.",

EBOV GP pseudovirion transduction or EBOV infection was inhibited in the absence of AMPK activity, and this inhibition was specific for the viral glyco-protein as compound C had no effect on entry of VSV pseudovirions containing LFV GPC. This finding implicated AMPK-regulated pathways in EBOV GP-dependent entry events. As EBOV entry has been recently shown to be mediated by actin-dependent macropinocytosis (20, 21, 23) , we compared actin polymerization in the presence or absence of compound C. EBOV pseudovirionstimulated actin polymerization was inhibited in the absence of AMPK. Consistent with this, EBOV pseudovirions remained on the surface of cells with defective AMPK activity. Thus, we propose that AMPK activity enhances EBOV infection by regulating virus uptake into cells via macropinocytosis. It is possible that AMPK regulates additional steps in EBOV entry and expression since EBOV was much more effectively inhibited by the loss of AMPK activity than high-molecular-weight dextran uptake, a cargo frequently used to assess macropinocytosis.",

Several recent studies hint at possible links between AMPK activity and the formation of actin-mediated lamellipodium formation and macropinocytosis (38, 39) . Rac1, PI3K/Akt, protein kinase C, and myosin light chain kinase (MLCK), which have either been previously identified to be involved in EBOV entry and macropinocytosis and/or were identified in our CGA screen, are known to be phosphorylation targets downstream of AMPK activation (36, (78) (79) (80) (81) (82) . Vero cells were incubated with the indicated inhibitor for 1 h before cells were chilled to 4\u00b0C. EBOV GP pseudovirions were then allowed to bind to the cells for an additional hour at 4\u00b0C. Surface-bound virus was either removed by trypsin treatment prior to shifting the temperature to 37\u00b0C (control, 0 min) or allowed to transduce for 1 h at 37\u00b0C in the presence of inhibitor or the DMSO control prior to trypsin treatment. After 1 h, cells were refreshed with medium not containing inhibitor. Viral transduction was determined 24 h later by EGFP expression via flow cytometry. **, P \u03fd 0.01; ***, P \u03fd 0.001. One possible means by which activation of AMPK may lead to altered macropinocytosis is by relocalization and altered function of components of the protruding lamellipodia. AMPK activation is known to phosphorylate the anticapping protein vasodilatorstimulated phosphoprotein (VASP) (37, 40, 83) . Unphosphorylated VASP prevents actin capping and enhances actin filament elongation by binding to the barbed end of actin, whereas actincapping proteins are critical in the formation of lamellipodia (84) (85) (86) (87) . Phosphorylation of VASP inhibits its anticapping activity, and sequestration or phosphorylation of VASP correlates with increased cell motility although how VASP is regulated at the tip of lamellipodia is not entirely clear (84, (88) (89) (90) (91) . Thus, a lack of AMPK-dependent VASP phosphorylation may explain the decreased motility observed in AMPK \u03ea/\u03ea MEFs and reduced lamellipodium formation (39) . Intriguingly, phosphorylated VASP has been observed at sites of EBOV entry (23) .",

Interestingly, here we show that EBOV transduction of both of these highly permissive lines required AMPK, suggesting that either the AMPK requirement is independent of both of these pathways, that AMPK can activate either pathway, or that AMPK is activated downstream from these pathways. Moser et al. speculate that one or more Rho GTPases may be activated downstream from AMPK activation (39) . As we have shown that Rho B and C enhance EBOV GP-dependent uptake (22) , our newest findings lend indirect support for this possibility.",
